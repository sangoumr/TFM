The terms under consideration included a bond exchange, which would mean a permanent loss for participating bondholders, along with measures to increase the likelihood that the bondholders would be repaid on the new debt, those people said. By improving the utilitys creditworthiness, Prepas borrowing costs would also go down. The total face value of Prepas outstanding debt is about $8.1 billion; of that, about $2.4 billion has been insured. The negotiations cover only the remaining $5.7 billion. Prepa and its bondholders have been in restructuring talks for more than a year, and during that time its creditors agreed not to take any legal action to enforce their claims. The agreement was scheduled to expire at midnight on Tuesday, but people with knowledge of the talks said they expected that a deal would be announced early Wednesday. ",2015-09-02T03:22:22+0000

In the solo inging, a 2010 piece based on unscripted speaking, her task is to talk. Its a relentless practice in which language, more than movement, becomes the choreography. In her latest work, To Being, she shifts her focus from the voice to the body to explore the precariousness of a dancer moving ceaselessly in performance. Her underlying question: How can we give more when all we feel is that weve met our limit? The work, which also includes the dancers Julian Barnett and Molly Poerstel and sound by Tian Rotteveel, delves even more deeply into her research practice known as nonstopping, which means moving but never arriving. The Chocolate Factory, however, has arrived: This treasured performance space celebrates its 10th anniversary with the premiere of To Being (Sept. 9-19) and the reprisal of inging (Sept. 23-26).",2015-09-02T16:57:27+0000

But the 2010s have given Rio a chance to add a cosmopolitan edge as host of last years World Cup and next years Summer Olympics, twice making it the center of the world. The new Rio is taking shape in fits and starts: The downtown port area is in the midst of an impressive overhaul of public works, exhumed historic sites and new museums. And with it, energy has been flowing toward more central, bustling neighborhoods, away from the traditional South Zone destinations of Copacabana and Ipanema  though their beaches still give a party on the sand like no other.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said in a statement released late Tuesday that eight years of effective bans on most exports, three major conflicts and tight restrictions on materials entering Gaza had shattered its ability to export and produce for the domestic market, ravaged its already debilitated infrastructure, left no time for reconstruction and economic recovery, and accelerated the de-development of the Gaza Strip. According to the agency, Gazas 1.8 million inhabitants rely on coastal aquifers as their main source of freshwater, yet 95 percent of this water is not safe to drink. Moreover, the unemployment rate exceeds 40 percent, and more than two-thirds of Gazans do not have reliable access to adequate supplies of food. A United Nations report in 2012 contained similar warnings, but it appears that widespread destruction caused by last summers conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants may have accelerated those trends. Israel and Egypt heavily restricted the movement of people and goods into Gaza after the militant Hamas group seized power of the territory in 2007. ",2015-09-03T00:20:22+0000

More than 10,000 of the kits have undergone testing for DNA and other evidence, an effort that has cost the state millions of dollars. So far, 21 convictions have resulted from the evidence. But officials warned that the work of investigating and prosecuting cases still had years to go and would cost millions more. At a news conference with Gov. Rick Snyder, state and local officials said the tests had produced 2,616 matches with DNA samples in the F.B.I.s national database, with evidence of 477 serial rapists and links to crimes in 39 states and the District of Columbia. An investigation by Michigan State University researchers, funded by the Justice Department, pointed to a chronic lack of resources, rapid turnover in the department and a sense of triage in a high-crime city as contributing to sexual assault cases not being treated seriously enough.

So voluminous is this scholarly outpouring that few are able to keep up with it, although some historians continue to grapple with the subject as a whole.

With blue-collar identity now more a matter of cultural style than of occupational history, the term is perfectly slippery, such that the assertions that Gov.

The initial review, conducted by the Office of Congressional Ethics, found that his staff appeared to have researched a potential campaign opponent, prepared materials for the campaign, used information from the congressional office for campaign purposes and discussed campaign matters during official meetings, in the lawmakers district office and at a staff retreat. Mr. Honda has denied that he formally broke the rules, but his aides have conceded that he could have done a better job separating political and government business.

us,Colorado: Pro-Marijuana Activists Pull Back on Ballot Measure,"Pro-marijuana activists campaigning to allow the drug to be used legally in adults-only businesses like nightclubs or bars said on Thursday they were withdrawing a ballot measure that would have put the issue before voters in Denver in November. Activists said they were pulling the initiative because they believed they could reach a compromise with city officials and business groups that would result in local legislation to allow some limited social use of marijuana in Denver. When Colorado voters in 2012 became the first in the nation, along with Washington State, to legalize marijuana for recreational use, they did so with a caveat: No public use. But advocates said the restrictions on public use were too strict and had prohibited marijuana everywhere except private homes and a handful of marijuana-friendly bed-and-breakfasts scattered around the state. The ballot proposal would have allowed people to eat edible marijuana or inhale vaporized forms of marijuana indoors, but would have relegated smoking to outdoor areas blocked from public view. Organizers said that it was still too early to know what might be included in a compromise ordinance, and that if the effort stalled, they might reintroduce the ballot measure next year.

But Althea Gibson (1927-2003), above, broke the color barrier nearly two decades earlier, in 1957, becoming the first African-American woman to win that tournament as well as the United States Nationals (the precursor of the United States Open). This documentary from Rex Miller traces the life of Ms. Gibson, the daughter of a South Carolina sharecropper who as a young child moved with her family to Harlem, where she progressed from paddle tennis on the streets to tennis at the Cosmopolitan Club and on to Florida A&M with the help of the bandleader Buddy Walker, the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson and two African-American doctors, Hubert Eaton and Robert W. Johnson. In the 1950s, she emerged as the queen of a sport that was still highly segregated and went on to win 11 Grand Slam titles, including six in doubles.

But the only divinity is that of the operator at the central office, where all news is gathered and tapped out. The man who perfected this instrument, Mr. Frederick W.H.

us,"The Wake, by Paul Kingsnorth","What happens after the end? Since the portrayals of world-destroying deluges in early writings (Gilgamesh, the Matsya Purana, Genesis, the Timaeus), narratives of apocalypse have structured our understanding of time and history. Religious eschatology looks to the end of days as a prelude to the absolute finality of the kingdom of God. Secularized as the Singularity, a similar idea drives the imagination of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and cybernetic doomsayers, who believe we are approaching a technological punctum beyond which humanity as we know it will no longer exist. In the face of economic crisis and anxiety about climate change, postapocalyptic science fiction, long a genre staple, is undergoing one of its cyclical peaks of popularity. Our screens and pages are crowded with survivors, grimly coping with the aftermath of plagues, wars, natural disasters, zombie attacks and alien invasions.",2015-09-04T14:36:18+0000

We were a despised minority when Asian immigrants threatened 19th- and early-20th-century white labor, yet since the Cold War weve been described as a model minority, valorizing the promise of American meritocracy. The capricious ease with which those labels get swapped highlights how our precarious social position rests on our perceived utility: as cheap labor, as anti-Communist soldiers, as overachievers meant to success-shame other communities of color. In doing all of this work, Lee argues, Asian-Americans have redefined not only immigration politics and racial categories but also the very essence of what it means to be American.",2015-09-04T14:36:29+0000

Penny started the series in 2005 after two decades as a CBC radio host, and its popularity caught her by surprise. Its difficult to learn from success. Ive learned more from my mistakes, she told the author and critic Joel Yanofsky in 2013. Fortunately, Im capable of manufacturing my own problems. In her 20s and early 30s those included a battle with alcoholism, and later a five-year bout of writers block that was, according to Yanofsky, mainly spent watching Oprah, eating gummy bears and lying to everyone, including her husband, about how well her writing was going. Things have improved since then. Now I know that if Im not in the top five on the Times best-seller list, Im going to feel like a failure, she said in the same interview. No worries here! But that doesnt mean Pennys life is challenge-free: In the past few years shes had to care for her husband as he slides into dementia. I find now that the writing is a safe harbor, she told The Vancouver Sun last month. Its a place I go to that is mine. You have to wonder if Penny had her husbands condition in mind when she quoted Yeatss The Second Coming in the new book  thats the poem about things falling apart and the center not holding, which concludes, And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,/Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?

(HBO) WILD (2014) Reese Witherspoon, in an Oscar-nominated performance, portrays Cheryl Strayed, who copes with the aftermath of her heroin use, her marital infidelity and the death of her mother by hiking the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, spanning more than 1,000 miles, from the Southern California desert to the forests of Oregon. Her routine  walking, thinking, pitching her tent at night and packing it up in the morning  is punctuated by montages of memories and encounters in the wilderness, mostly with men. Some are scary; others are kind; but almost all are intrigued by the presence of a solitary woman so far from civilization.  Wild may be full of natural beauty  Yves Blangers cinematography unostentatiously captures the infinite colors and vistas of the West  but it is also a celebration of the power of art, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about Jean-Marc Valles adaptation of Ms. Strayeds memoir, from a script by Nick Hornby. And the film has its shortcomings, he added, with too much montage in the middle and too much voice-over at the end, and maybe not quite enough detail about some of Cheryls relationships. But you wouldnt want a movie that celebrates imperfection, improvisation and the importance of mistakes to be slick or seamless. What makes its heroine worth caring about  what makes her a rare and exciting presence in contemporary American film  is not that shes tidy or sensible or even especially nice. Its that shes free.",2015-09-05T05:00:03+0000

Mr. Anderson said he believed the girl was 17 and above the age of consent in Michigan when they met online and subsequently had a single sexual encounter in December. Mr. Anderson, a resident of Indiana, pleaded guilty to fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and probation, but he was told that he would spend the rest of his life on the states sex offender registry. He was also ordered not to use the Internet or smartphones for five years, forcing him to abandon computer science studies at a community college. Mr. Andersons lawyer said he hoped that a new judge would grant his client a special status under Michigan law for youthful offenders, which would mean he would not be required to be on the states sex offender registry.

The duchesss first child and the kings first granddaughter was born at 2:40 a.m. at 17 Bruton Street, London, house of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore, the Duchess of Yorks parents. She became the third heir in the line of succession to the throne, ranking after the Prince of Wales and her father. She is expected to be christened Mary Victoria Elizabeth, respectively after Queen Mary, who will be the childs principal godmother; after Queen Victoria, whose name it has become the custom to keep in each royal generation, and after her mother, the Duchess of York. The last name will probably be that by which the child will be known, and thus a famous name in British history will be revived in the Royal family.

Pinter has since died, but his masterly and enigmatic dramas, as spare as his advice to actors, endure, although New York is perhaps due for a revival of Old Times (an acclaimed English production in 2013 starred Rufus Sewell). The 1971 play is about a couple who are visited by an old friend of the wifes whose stories from the past startle and confuse, setting up a classic Pinter power struggle that manages to be both brutal and elusive at once. In this new production, the Oscar nominee Clive Owen makes his Broadway debut opposite Eve Best (who starred in the Broadway revival of Pinters The Homecoming) and Kelly Reilly (True Detective, the Donmar Warehouses After Miss Julie).

In exchange, the state of Maine agreed to drop charges that he was littering when he spilled celebratory Champagne on the mountaintop and that he was traveling with an oversize group. Baxter State Park, the location of Katahdin, has said that so many hikers were breaking the rules, it might move the Appalachian Trail out of the park. That matter, which was not part of the case against Mr. Jurek, remains a question. Walter McKee, Mr. Jureks lawyer, said that while Baxter was hoping the charges might limit the number of hikers, as a result of the attention, there will probably be more people on the trail and in the park. R. Christopher Almy, who prosecuted the case, said the $500 fine  up from the normal $200  reflected the seriousness of the charge. ",2015-09-10T00:20:37+0000

us,Inside the List,"The Plague: Is there any way, at this point, to separate Jonathan Franzens work from his polarizing public image? Most readers will recall that Franzens fame problem began in 2001, when he openly squirmed after Oprah Winfrey picked his novel The Corrections for her book club, then escalated through no real fault of his own when media outlets (including The Times) hailed his 2010 follow-up, Freedom, as a masterpiece. Both were best sellers, but they also fostered an enthusiastic backlash among people who objected less to Franzens writing than to Franzen himself, as an emblem of literary ambition and elitism. (Laura Miller put her finger on this in a recent essay for The New Yorkers website: Franzens persona, she wrote, has its own audience, one that seems to derive great pleasure from hating it. Although his fiction is the occasion of his fame, it is now no longer necessary to have read any of it to have an opinion about Franzen.)",2015-09-11T14:00:04+0000

Mr. Walker, an independent, said that the expansion could save the state about $100 million and bring 20,000 or more residents into health care coverage, and that he did not need legislative approval. The Republican-controlled Legislature, in filing a lawsuit and seeking a temporary restraining order, said Mr. Walker had violated the State Constitutions separation of powers provisions. The expansion will, among other changes, increase federal reimbursement to 100 percent from 50 percent for medically necessary travel for Medicaid-eligible Alaska Natives and American Indians receiving care in Indian Health Service facilities, which is a major medical expense and care concern in rural Alaska. The Alaska Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision, issued last week, not to halt the plan while the Legislatures lawsuit proceeds. ",2015-09-11T14:16:20+0000

I need to talk to her. The longing to corroborate ones own feelings with the facts of an artists life  the assumption that the glory she saw in the work reflected a glory in its maker  is a primal one, Didion suggests. But there is a paradox inherent in the encounter with art: Even as it may touch us acutely, it is essentially mysterious. It carries only a trace of its maker, and this is style.

That rejection at 19 led him to London to try his luck auditioning for the Drama Centre there. He had prepared an Iago monologue, had gone over it hundreds of times, but he was still nervous. He had been replaying the words of a director from one of the other drama schools, who had told him that he could recognize an actor from the way he enters a room. I still hate that, said Fassbender. Before the audition, he was trying to get the directors words out of his mind. I went to the urinal, and as I was pissing, I saw that someone had written Hi, Cookie! on the wall. Those words were staring at me, as I stood there. I had just finished playing the Cook in a production of Mother Courage, and I had done it with a Scottish accent. Cook; cookie. Ill do the Iago monologue in a Scottish accent, I decided, even though that wasnt how I had prepared it. After the audition, Fassbender was asked why hed chosen that accent, to which he answered something about it being a way to bring mischief into the piece, which seemed true enough. Its funny.

But in fact, high-end timepieces are doing just fine. Last year, Switzerland exported a record $24.3 billion worth of them (which says nothing of the equally booming vintage business). And while the Apple watch, which launched in April and sold an estimated 2.5 million units in its first quarter, is likely to affect those numbers, most traditional producers are taking their smart competition in stride. After all, they survived the ravages of the 1970s, when quartz technology made 60,000 watchmakers obsolete. Indeed, the Swiss are in the midst of a horological renaissance in which dedicated collectors wait years  and pay millions  for timepieces that make up for their lack of digital functionality with analog elegance and a promise: Given regular servicing, theyll run in perpetuity.",2015-09-11T22:08:58+0000

The security firm Kroll reported that video shot by Officer Raymond Tensings body camera contradicts his central claim, that his arm was caught in Samuel DuBoses car, and he was being dragged. It said Officer Tensing, who has been charged with murder, appeared to have his arm free, and the car had not moved, or had barely moved, when he fired at Mr. DuBose. Calling the shooting entirely preventable, the report faulted both men for needlessly escalating the situation before that point  Mr. DuBose by disobeying the officers instructions and restarting his car, as if to drive off. Kroll also said the university police were unsuited to street-level policing, especially off campus, and should consider narrowing their mission. ",2015-09-11T23:46:08+0000

Ms. Childs was among the revolutionaries of Judson Dance Theater in the 1960s, and like some of her fellow postmodernists she has found a more ardent audience  and more funding, presumably  in Europe than in the United States. But as the writer Suzanne Carbonneau notes in a program essay, Philadelphia has been good to her, with the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage supporting the reconstruction of her early works and giving them a handsome online platform, the exemplary archival project A Steady Pulse: Restaging Lucinda Childs, 1963-78.

(TCM) BREATHLESS (1961) Turner Classic Movies pays tribute to the director Jean-Luc Godard, starting with this New Wave classic about two erratic days in the lives of star-crossed young lovers  Jean-Paul Belmondo, as a French hoodlum on the lam after killing a cop, and Jean Seberg, as an American expatriate newspaper vendor  living in Paris. As sordid as the film is, and sordid is really a mild word for its pile-up of gross indecencies, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times, it is no clich  rather more a chunk of raw drama, graphically and artfully torn with appropriately ragged edges out of the tough underbelly of modern metropolitan life. The evening continues with Pierrot le Fou (1968), featuring Mr. Belmondo as an unhappily married man who abandons his bourgeois life for a crime spree with an ex-girlfriend (Anna Karina), at 10:15; Masculin Fminin (1966), about an aspiring writer (Jean-Pierre Laud) who becomes involved with a rising pop star (Chantal Goya) and her roommates, at 12:15 a.m.; Alphaville (1965), in which a private investigator (Eddie Constantine) is sent to rescue a scientist from a future world ruled by computers, at 2:15; and A Woman Is a Woman (1964), about an exotic dancer (Ms. Karina) intent on finding a man to father a child, at 4.

I recently posted a job on my colleges career network and received a rsum from someone in my graduating class. Ive never met this person, and I know him to have been a diligent student who won a prestigious fellowship during senior year. He would probably be a leading candidate, and by passing his rsum on, I would be implicitly giving my stamp of approval. The problem is that freshman year he sexually harassed and attempted to sexually assault a good friend of mine. A third party intervened before it escalated and brought her to me and another friend. She decided not to take the incident to any authority, and she eventually worked through the experience. The thought of working with the man who brought so much pain to a good friend is hard to swallow, but I do not know what the ethical thing to do is. It is not my story to share, and I do not want to bring the question to my friend for fear of opening old wounds. Am I allowed to share this information with the head of human resources? Can I take an act committed five years ago by somebody I never met and use it to determine his future job status? Is there a way to bring up my discomfort without outing him?

The wall opposite them was mirrored from floor to ceiling, and behind it, unseen in a darkened room, a half-dozen employees of the toy company Mattel sat watching through one-way glass. The girl, who looked about 7, wore a turquoise sweatshirt and had her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail. The woman, a Mattel child-testing specialist named Lindsey Lawson, had sleek dark hair and the singsong voice of a kindergarten teacher. Microphones hidden in the room transmitted what Lawson said next. You are going to have a chance to play with a brand-new toy, she told the girl, who leaned forward with her hands on her knees.

Dance, the voice of the body, is in a distinctive position to contribute to this conversation, and that is especially true this week. Beginning on Tuesday, Sept. 22, at the Joyce Theater, Camille A. Brown presents Black Girl: Linguistic Play, which explores the broad spectrum of black female identity. Ms. Brown is a sharp storyteller, and here she illuminates her theme with infectious spirit by borrowing from the ritual of childhood games (through Sunday, Sept. 27). Starting on Wednesday, Sept. 23, Jaamil Olawale Kosoko, a Detroit-born Nigerian-American artist based in Brooklyn, brings #negrophobia to Gibney Dance, in which he considers the erotic fear associated with the black male body through a personal and a social lens (through Saturday, Sept. 26). In very different ways, both elevate, celebrate and complicate the black body.

But the students have never been found, and only one, Alexander Mora, had been identified from a bone fragment that the authorities said was recovered near the dump. Attorney General Arely Gmez said Wednesday that advanced testing at the Medical University of Innsbruck in Austria had determined that another bone fragment from the site belonged to Jhosivani Guerrero de la Cruz, who was 20 when he disappeared. An outside panel of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said recently that the physical evidence at the dump did not support the hypothesis that the students were cremated there.

(Starz Cinema) THE PATIENCE STONE (2013) In this film directed by Atiq Rahimi and adapted from his 2008 novel, a beautiful young Afghan woman (Golshifteh Farahani) confesses her fears, resentments and dreams to her comatose older husband (Hamidrez Javdan), a guerrilla fighter with a bullet in his neck. The film mirrors an Afghan myth that had been told by women as a healthy expression of their stifled feelings in a male-dominated world,  Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, quoting the folklorist Richard M. Dorson. Mr. Rahimi uses universals (Man and Woman) as proxies in a battle that, as the story progresses, takes on an abstract quality, Ms. Dargis wrote. Yet while there may be truths in some universals, its hard to forget that this tale has its roots in a bitterly real world. (Image: Ms. Farahani and Mr. Javdan.)",2015-09-17T05:00:04+0000

But what else is it? The book feels like a take on a certain genre  and lets figure out what the genre is in a minute  but Im suspicious of that phrasing, a take, which is often used to draw a divisive line. It is said, for instance, that Margaret Atwood does a take on science fiction and therefore is a literary writer instead of a science fiction writer, and then we wonder why there are so few science fiction writers who write as well as Margaret Atwood, while the science fiction writers glare at us and order another round. This is bad. The Handmaids Tale is science fiction and should not be disqualified as such on the grounds that it has good sentences and makes you think, as does the work of Patrick deWitt. Therefore, Undermajordomo Minor is a terrific piece of genre writing, and thats that.",2015-09-17T09:30:04+0000

Wardaddy, and his motley crew (Michael Pea, Jon Bernthal, Shia LaBeouf and Logan Lerman)  fights its way across Germany in the spring of 1945 as the Nazis retreat toward Berlin in Hitlers suicidal last stand. Children are conscripted and uncooperative parents murdered. And while the Allies may have momentum, the Germans still have plenty of tanks, many superior to the Americans. David Ayer, whose drama is less an epic than a series of tense episodes, has a way of filming violence that is both intense and matter-of-fact, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Like many other post-Saving Private Ryan combat movies, this one emphasizes the chaotic immediacy of battle, staking its claim to authenticity on the unflinching depiction of bloodshed: Heads are vaporized by mortar rounds. Limbs are severed by bursts of automatic-rifle fire. Human flesh is charred by flames and shredded by shrapnel. But within this gore-spattered, superficially nihilistic carapace is an old-fashioned platoon picture, a sensitive and superbly acted tale of male bonding under duress.

Getting a witness to describe the face of a perpetrator is the more difficult and nuanced skill. Start by taking five or six minutes to pencil in the shape of a head of average proportions. A face tends to equal five eye-lengths across, while the width of a mouth is about the distance between pupils. Draw quickly: The movement of graphite on paper can be hypnotic.

For some time past Mr. Boucicault had conducted a school of dramatic art from which he turned out some of our most promising young actors and actresses. It had been noted within the last two or three years that the veteran was getting a little stiff in his movements, but the cheery voice and jaunty Irish manner never left him to the last.

Books are also on the way from Carrie Brownstein, Sinead OConnor and others. This is the era of the female act, the former Rolling Stone editor (and current president of Blue Rider Press) David Rosenthal told The Washington Post this month. Maybe that has caused overall a hunger for reading about female artists. Maybe it has. But Hynde told The Post that gender isnt a big part of the equation for her. A good book is a good book. A good song is a good song, she said. Let me hear it, let me read it. Im not very gender-driven. Hynde grew up in a fairly conservative family in Akron, Ohio, and managed, apparently, to hide the more lurid elements of her rock n roll lifestyle from her mother and father.

Details of the citys fall have not yet been made known, but there is every reason to suppose that the Russian army of occupation has withdrawn intact. For the last few days, as the HERALD indicated yesterday, the fate of Vilna had been in the balance. The enemy occupying Molodetchno and Vidsy, Vilna was practically cut off from all railway communication, and its evacuation, generally regarded as imminent, had doubtless been fully prepared for by the Russian high command. The fall of Vilna, says the Times Petrograd correspondent, will facilitate a further German advance along the northern routes and will increase Russias difficulties in the matter of transport, both of men and munitions. No official Russian statement has yet been issued, but even the German newspapers do not suggest that the army defending Vilna has been captured. Its escape may therefore be taken for granted, but its position is still a somewhat dangerous one, for an important enemy force threatens its flank from the east.

Mr. Esseghaier, who is from Montreal, had repeatedly said he would not participate in the trial because he recognized only the laws of the Quran. Two psychiatrists concluded that Mr. Esseghaier probably has schizophrenia but differed on whether he was fit to stand trial. But Justice Michael Code of the Ontario Superior Court found that the man was not delusional at the time of the plotting. The judge also rejected Mr. Jasers defense that he had been entrapped and played along with the agent only to get money to feed his drug addiction. ",2015-09-24T00:13:01+0000

us,Inside the List,"His and Hers, Part I: You could think of Lauren Groffs third novel, Fates and Furies  new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 7  as a sort of Gone Girl minus the murderous psychopathology. Both tell the story of a marriage first from the husbands somewhat complacent perspective, then change course midway to reveal a wife far more active and vengeful than expected. But Fates and Furies is also, as the title suggests, a meditation on classical ideas of destiny and human agency, with the golden boy Lotto (short for Lancelot) representing submission to the Fates while his wife, Mathilde, rides with the Furies and shapes reality to her liking. I asked Groff which view she endorses, if either. I wobble between action and somewhat optimistic fatalism, she replied by email. In the middle of the night, I side more with Mathildes pragmatic anxiety; during the slow, hot Florida daylight hours, Im a little sunnier, a little more like Lotto. I thought, going into the book, that I was 89 percent Lotto, and this book is in some ways an elaborate apologia to my husband for often being wrapped up in my writing to the exclusion of actual life. But Mathilde is a terrifying sister of my heart, and I find myself in her in equal measure. Its not exactly Flauberts Madame Bovary, cest moi. In truth both Lotto and Mathilde, cest moi. I am both of them and neither of them in equal measure, and their lives and ambivalence and desires have elements of mine, all snarled up in this one big wild knot.",2015-09-25T15:31:50+0000

Like those shows, Quantico features an attractive cast with a bit of something for everyone: a tough Southern belle (Johanna Braddy), a compromised Mormon (Brian J. Smith), a complex Muslim (Yasmine Al Massri) and a conservative gay recruit (Tate Ellington). Then theres the no-nonsense mentor (Aunjanue Ellis), who immediately gives them a test: Find out a dark secret about a classmate within 24 hours or get sent packing. With its plot twists, flashbacks and Olivia Pope-like back story, Quantico feels like a Shonda Rhimes creation (Greys Anatomy, Scandal). If great TV takes many hands to make, competently O.K. TV like Quantico takes even more  it doesnt do much to hide its borrowings, James Poniewozik wrote in The New York Times.

On one occasion he shudders in his core; mostly he is just plain worried. What concerns him, a concern he is eager to transmit to us, is the rapid spread of computer, Internet and telephone technologies and more specifically what those technologies are doing to our minds. Forever glued to screens of one kind or another, clicking compulsively on the links others provide for us, we are losing the ability to concentrate, growing more itchy and agitated by the day, allowing our consciousness to be fragmented and dispersed. Our very selfhood is under threat as we are invited to think of achievement as a collective, rather than individual goal, a contribution to Wikipedia rather than a distinctive personal statement. At every step the Internet or GPS navigator puts us at a remove from the world and from our fellow human beings, deprives us of the agency we enjoyed when we had to go out and find things for ourselves rather than have them suggested to us. Rewired, as neuroscientists have now demonstrated, to adapt to the fitful back and forth of the web, our brains are no longer fit for the sustained attention that literature requires. Fewer young people are choosing to study the humanities. Fewer great works of art are being produced. There is a real risk of individuality being submerged in system. To make matters worse, a vast majority of people seem entirely happy with this state of affairs, to the point that anyone questioning the value of the new technologies is immediately deemed a Luddite if not a dinosaur.

Ian is horrified by Jessies working-class habits. Maurice, on the other hand, sees in her a target for his charm. Their unlikely, uneven friendship provides the movie with a thin, wobbly dramatic peg, but it turns out to be just enough for Mr. OToole to show the younger guys out there  the Leos and the Brads and, for that matter, the Daniel Craigs  how the thing is done properly, A.

Ties between Japan and China have been frayed over their wartime history and disputes over maritime territory. The Japanese foreign ministry declined to identify the detainees, both men, whose detention was first reported by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun. Asked if Japan had sent spies to China, a government spokesman said: As a nation, we absolutely do not do that. I want to say the same thing to all countries.

According to the newspaper, one man was taken into custody near a military facility south of Shanghai, and the other near the North Korean border.

Growing up entirely in a digital era, they are more private, sensible and cautious than their Millennial elders. Perhaps thats because they are being raised not by high-flying boomers but by Generation X, which one Times article calls a relatively small, jaded generation that came of age in the post-Watergate, post-Vietnam funk of the 1970s, when horizons seemed limited. Much of the current helicopter-parenting phenomenon, it has been speculated, is a result of these Gen-Xers overcorrecting with their offspring for the strange and often jarring empty spaces that characterized their own 1970s childhoods. Back then, I think it is safe to say, parenting as a verb  a life-defining, life-consuming activity  had not been invented, even as the world had become more treacherous for children to navigate. It seems appropriate, then, that one of the best books I have yet read about growing up in the 1970s is a graphic novel for middle-grade readers: Sunny Side Up, by Jennifer L.

Mr. Yellen is also, happily, still with us. He has restructured his book to focus on the relationships among the patriarch, Mayer Rothschild, played by Robert Cuccioli, his wife and their five sons.

Ornstein goes for the jugular in the febrile outer movements, shot through with Russian folk material and rhythmic fire, but offers respite in the achingly tender Andante Lamentoso. His nervous, simmering String Quartet No. 2, written around 1929, is another interesting document of Ornsteins late Romantic style, but its the Quintet that now ought to be picked up by intrepid performers and presenters and given its due in the chamber music canon.
