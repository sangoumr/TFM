us,What Makes Us Angry? How Queens Defines the 'Quality of Life',"THE ""quality of life,"" this season's municipal mantra, means different things to different people. A month ago, The City surveyed Manhattan, interviewing dozens of residents, merchants, police officers and district managers of community boards to seek examples of quality of life issues. A journey through Queens reveals similar psychic desires, for order, cleanliness and a nonviolent environment. But the decidedly unscientific survey shows some different emphases, in some cases reflecting immigration -- overcrowded houses, and auto shops turning up on residential blocks. In addition, livery cabs triple-parked outside their bases are grating nerves. Illegal dumping is prevalent. East Queens, partly suburban, has beefs, but the west can list more. Soon, The City will look at Brooklyn and The Bronx. ASTORIA HEIGHTS, ASTORIA LONG ISLAND CITY 1. AIRPLANE NOISE Especially heavy in bad weather when incoming-flight path over Astoria Heights is used more. 2. NOISE Comes from heavy traffic from trucks headed to Triborough Bridge. 3. AUTO THEFTS AND BREAK-INS A major concern. Many residents have taken radios out of their cars. 4. ILLEGAL DUMPING The lot under the Hell Gate Bridge, like most deserted areas, is a dumping spot. 5. HOMELESS ENCLAVES Homeless people congregate, and live in, parks under the Triborough Bridge, making families in area uneasy. There are sanitation problems, too. 6-7. LIVERY CABS On Steinway Street and 23d Avenue and Broadway and 37th Street, livery cabs double-park and triple-park, tying up traffic and blocking access to sidewalks and crosswalks. 8. GRAFFITI Buildings along the 31st Street elevated subway tracks -- from Ditmars Boulevard to Queens Plaza -- are covered with bright-colored graffiti, although a cleanup program involving youthful offenders is having an effect. 9. PROSTITUTION Streetwalkers congregate in the area around Jackson Avenue and 23d Street. 10-12. ILLEGAL DUMPING In July, a trailer was found with tons of rancid meat at (10) 48th Street and Barnett Avenue. Other dumping spots include (11) Skillman Avenue from 35th to 39th Street and (12) the Queens-Midtown Expressway from 42d to 48th Street. 13. WINDOW WASHERS A persistent problem at 31st Street and Bridge Plaza North and South, although enforcement efforts are thinning the ranks. 14. NOISE Loiterers play loud radios at 43d Avenue and 43d Street. 15. EYESORES At Greenpoint Avenue near Queens Boulevard merchants display their wares too far into the sidewalk.

But White Flower Farm's stately catalogue has always devoted itself exclusively to the most refined perennials, bulbs and shrubs -- horticulture's aristocrats. Coming upon annuals in the pages of White Flower Farm is a little like finding Elmore Leonard in The New Yorker.

The Politics of Art","Edward Lucie-Smith's RACE, SEX, AND GENDER IN CONTEMPORARY ART (Abrams, $39.95) is a defensive book. Attacking the effect of political correctness on discussions of African-American art, for example, Mr. Lucie-Smith writes: ""One purpose of this constantly shifting terminology seems to be the exclusion of generalist critics such as myself, who readily fall into some newly dug linguistic pit and can then be dismissed as racists."" Apparently intending to hold the ground of esthetic value against the intrusion of recent writing on issues of race and sexuality in the visual arts, the author, an English critic and curator, adopts a position antagonistic to these categories and to the political debates underlying them. For example, Mr. Lucie-Smith chides feminist artwork for a lack of eroticism, asserting, in a generalization typical of this book, ""The female sensibility seems less preoccupied with eroticism than with the problem of difference."" The chapter on ""Minority Sexuality"" praises the work of some gay male artists for its uninhibited eroticism but dismisses more political work: ""Gay art, like art which protests against racial discrimination, is now something which contrives to put itself beyond the reach of criticism because it is essentially an art of victims."" ""Race, Sex, and Gender in Contemporary Art"" combines an appreciation of estheticized eroticism with a blunt critique of feminism, multiculturalism and political art.MIGNON NIXON",1994-09-04T05:00:00+0000

us,American Football Conference,"Teams are listed in order of predicted finish. A.F.C. EAST BUFFALO BILLS 1993: Finished 12-4. Lost, 30-13, to Dallas in the SuperBowl STRENGTHS: A high-energy, experienced offense with talent at all the skill positions. Running back Thurman Thomas is still the most versatile running back in the league. And Bruce Smith is still one of the most respected pass rushers. WEAKNESSES: Quarterback Jim Kelly is battling tendinitis in his throwing shoulder. He's been beaten up in the last four years and has weathered most of it. Tackle Howard (House) Ballard went to Seattle as a free agent. His replacement, Jerry Crafts at 6-6, 351 pounds, is as big as a luxury liner, but is inexperienced. OUTLOOK: The Bills are confident that they can make it back to another Super Bowl. They said the same thing last year. And the year before that, and the year before that . . . Take them seriously. MIAMI DOLPHINS 1993: Finished 9-7. STRENGHTS: The secondary is strong with cornerback Troy Vincent, returning from a knee injury, and the free-agent acquisitions of cornerback Tyrone Braxton and safety Gene Atkins. WEAKNESSES: The rushing attack isn't going to send shivers through anyone. Running back Terry Kirby was a pleasant surprise as a rookie last year. But they need more from him, Keith Byars and Mark Higgs to have a decent threat in the rushing department. OUTLOOK: Everyone wants to see how quarterback Dan Marino returns from the torn Achilles' tendon that sidelined him for most of last season. If Marino returns to form, the Dolphins stand a good shot at Making the Super Bowl. INDIANAPOLIS COSTS 1993: Finished 4-12. STRENGTHS: The linebacking corps has a mixture of youth and experience and is the cornerstone of the defense. Watch Tony Bennett, a free agent from Green Bay, as a pass rusher. First-round pick Marshall Faulk has put some teeth in the rushing attack. WEAKNESSES: It's fair to say that Jim Harbaugh doesn't have the gun that Jeff George had at quarterback. The problem for Harbaugh is no one is sure what type of quarterback he is after being browbeaten for most of his seven years in Chicago. We'll soon find out. OUTLOOK: If Faulk can take some of the pressure off Harbaugh, like Thurman Thomas does from Jim Kelly in Buffalo, then the Colts can do some things. How much can they get accomplished? Who knows. But as long as Faulk is in the mix, it should be fun to watch. NEW YORK JETS: 1993: Finished 8-8. STRENGHTS: The offense could be a powerhouse. Running back Johnny Johnson and tight end Johnny Mitchell are gamebreakers. Receiver Rob Moore is developing into a big-play man. Linebacker Mo Lewis might be the most underrated player at his position in the league. WEAKNESSES: Rookie cornerback Aaron Glenn, who will start opposite veteran James Hasty in the secondary, could be liability because of his lack of experience. The Jets still don't have a dominant pass rusher on the defensive line. OUTLOOK: For the Jets to make a run at the playoffs two players must stay healthy and have Pro Bowl-caliber years -- quarterbck Boomer Esiason and defensive end Jeff Lageman. NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: 1993: Finished 5-11. STRENGTHS: Running back Marion Butts could be the switch that turns on the lights for the Patriots' offense and take pressure off second-year quarterback Drew Bledsoe. The secondary won't be pushovers now that cornerback Ricky Reynolds and safety Myron Guyton have been added. WEAKNESSES: The Patriots' defense finished No. 22 against the run last season, which bothered Coach Bill Parcells to no end. Perhaps one of those monster linebackers, Vincent Brown and Willie McGinest, can plug up those holes. OUTLOOK: The only thing standing in the Patriots' way of being a consistent winner is time. They're a fairly young team that needs time to build experience and confidence. They'll be better than 5-11 this year. A.F.C. CENTRAL HOUSTON OILERS 1993: Finished 12-4. STRENGTHS: The offensive line remains strong, anchored by veteran center Bruce Matthews. The secondary is also tough with safety Bubba McDowell and cornerback Cris Dishman. Running back Gary Brown was a splendid surprise last year rushing for 1,002 yards in just eight games. WEAKNESSES: The Oilers took a big hit in the pass-rush department with the departures of defensive ends William Fuller and Sean Jones. That kind of talent depletion isn't easily filled. OUTLOOK: Quarterback Cody Carison was a very capable backup to Warren Moon. Now, Carlson is the starter. There's a big difference. Moon had run that offense for 10 years. Carlson knows it, but how well can he run it week in and week out? PITTSBURGH STEELERS 1993: Finished 9-7. STRENGHTS: Barry Foster is a big-time running back who is used to carrying the load. A pair of Pro Bowlers, linebacker Greg Lloyd and cornerback Rod Woodson, give Pittsburgh one of the fastest defenses in the league. WEAKNESSES: The receiving corps doesn't give defenses nearly as many headaches as it should. They're hoping first-round pick Charles Johnson can rectify that situation. OUTLOOK: When Foster went down with an ankle injury last year so did the Steelers' offense. They need Foster healthy if they're going to have a chance at making the playoffs. CLEVELAND BROWNS 1993: Finished 7-9. STRENGTHS: The Browns ranked No. 12 in defense in the league last year and a big part of that was tackle Michael Dean Perry. Safety Eric Turner, who had five interceptions last year, should help the defense. WEAKNESSES: Whether it's Vinny Testaverde or Mark Rypien at quarterback, it doesn't matter. The Browns aren't going to get any sparks from the position. OUTLOOK: The Browns have always promised to find a role for mighty mile running back Eric Metcalf. They're promising again this year to make him a prominent part of the offense. That would be an entertaining diversion from another possible quarterback controversy. CINCINNATI BENGALS 1993: Finished 3-13. STRENGTHS: A defense that can boast six No. 1 picks, including this year's numero uno, Dan (Big Daddy) Wilkinson. With Wilkinson and Danny Copeland, a first-rounder in 1993, at the tackles, the Bengals have the makings of one of the most dominant defensive fronts in the league. WEAKNESSES: The offense finished 27th in the league last year and the same group returns intact. The offensive line is porous. Quarterback David Klinger is still stumbling around in the dark. Running back Harold Green is a bright spot. But how much can one man do? OUTLOOK: Last year, General Manager Mike Brown called his team ""The gang that couldn't shoot straight."" The same can still be said of the offense, but the defense can draw a bead and knock out anyone. Unfortunately for Cincinnati, it takes three units to make a whole team. A.F.C. WEST LOS ANGELES RAIDERS 1993: Finished 10-6. STRENGTHS: A corps of receivers that could qualify for the Olympic sprint relay team. The defense has some emerging stars in linemen Chester McGlockton, Anthony Smith and Nolan Harrison. The secondary is solid with cornerbacks Terry McDaniel and Lionel Washington and safety Eddie Anderson. WEAKNESSES: The lack of a rushing attack kept them from beating the Bills at Buffalo in the playoffs last year. The Raiders have added Harvey Williams from Kansas City as a way of beefing up the deficiency. Ty Montgomery will start at halfback and Napoleon McCallum is the fullback. OUTLOOK: The Black and Silver won't have many occasions to be black and blue this year, because they'll be the ones handing out the licks. With the speed they have they should run right past a lot of teams. The key will be whether quarterback Jeff Hostetler will be able to find those fleet-footed receivers. DENVER BRONCOS 1993: Finished 9-7. STRENGTHS: The offense took a giant step forward with the addition of speedy receivers Anthony Miller and Mike Pritchard. They're joining quarterback John Elway, running back Rod Bernstine and tight end Shannon Sharpe, who had 81 receptions last year. WEAKNESSES: The defense finished 19th in the league last year and lost cornerback Tyrone Braxton. Free safety Steve Atwater can only do so much. Free agents Ray Crockett and Ben Smith will start at the corners. OUTLOOK: The only thing that can stand in the Broncos' way this year is their defense. If it can hold their own, the offense will stand tall. With Miller and Pritchard as targets, Elway could be in for another big year in terms of numbers. But he'd rather have a shot at a Super Bowl championship and the Bronocs have a fighting chance. KANSAS CHIEFS 1993: Finished 11-5. STRENGTHS: The defensive front seven, which includes linebacker Derrick Thomas, defensive end Neil Smith and tackles Joe Phillips and Dan Saleaumua, is one of the toughest. Quarterback Joe Montana is 38 years old, but when he's healthy and on, he's still one of the best. WEAKNESSES: Greg Hill, the first-round pick, is going to be asked to handle the rushing load, because as good as Marcus Allen is he's not you enough to carry the ball 200 times a season. OUTLOOK: Quarterback Steve Bono was one of the smartest moves the Chiefs could have made. ONe good lick, like the one that knocked him 9out of the A.F.C. championship game at Buffalo last season, and Montana is on the shelf for a while. Bono knows the offense and can run it. The Chiefs are going to be in the thick of the playoff race. SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 1993: Finished 6-10. STRENGTHS: Defensively, the Seahawks can display some of the best players in the league at their positions. Defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy and linebacker Rufus Porter are great pass rushers and safety Eugene Robinson is a big hitter. Quarterback Rick Mirer is beginning to emerge and running back Chris Warren has put together back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing seasons. WEAKNESSES: Receiver Brian Blades, who had 80 catches and three touchdowns last year, needs a counterbalance. The Seahawks acquired tackle Howard Ballard to shore up their offensive line, but they lost tackle Andy Heck. OUTLOOK: The Seahawks are a mystery team. They have a collection of fine, young players, but they don't seem to be able to get it together to build a consistent winner. With Kennedy and Mirer, the Seahawks have the cornerstones for success. But the team remains an undeveloped project. SAN DIEGO CHARGERS 1993: Finished 8-8. STRENGTHS: Defensive linemen Leslie O'Neal and Chris Mims give the Chargers defense its bark and linebacker Junior Seau gives it the bit. Natrone Means was a pleasant surprise as a rookie, rushing for 645 yards. WEAKNESSES: The offense has been depleted of explosiveness by the departure of running back Marion Butts and receiver Anthony Miller. Quarterback Stan Humphries is workmanlike and gets the job done, but with fewer weapons to work with he's going to have to work magic this year. OUTLOOK: The chargers aren't nearly as good as they were two years ago when they won the A.F.C. West. They're also a much different team with the loss of Rod Bernstine, John Friesz, Butts and Miller. They'll have a difficult time getting anywhere in this division, especially with the Raiders, Chiefs and the Broncos sitting on top of them.",1994-09-04T05:00:00+0000

Consumer confidence eased for the second month in August, and the housing market is still heading down -- as people kick themselves for missing those rock-bottom mortgage rates. As for the unemployment rate, it's coasting along at 6.1 percent -- about where it's been for four months after plunging early in the year. But the slowing trend showed up in a report that just 179,000 payroll jobs were added in August -- fewer than expected. And inflation? Nowhere on the horizon: average hourly earnings rose just 2 cents last month -- nothing to set off a spending spree. Given all this, it seems unlikely that the Federal Reserve will feel the need to raise interest rates again at its policy meeting this month. But you never know.",1994-09-04T05:00:00+0000

This is the life she led with her brother Albert, and this is the life she has continued to lead since his death.

Despite the efforts of readers, writers, editors and critics -- and, in recent years, literary historians and scholars -- no one has yet succeeded in defining just what that vein is. Common sense tells us that science fiction has a special relationship to the ideas and products of modern science. But specifying the relationship has proved difficult; we obviously cannot accept as science fiction every story that acknowledges the existence of electricity and the internal combustion engine. In the absence of a persuasive definition, the label ""science fiction"" has remained largely a marketing tool, deployed by publishers, distributors and booksellers to attract a loyal but limited body of readers.",1994-09-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
Small Wonders","The Flemish artist Petrus Christus painted in prosperous 15th-century Bruges, then a ducal seat, during roughly the same period that the more renowned master Jan van Eyck operated his studio. Although historical records show Christus was a successful and wealthy painter, admitted to the highest circles of society, quite soon after his death toward the end of the century his art was all but forgotten. In the 1820's he was rediscovered, only to be brushed aside in this century by art historians like Max Friedlander and Erwin Panofsky as a weak hanger-on of van Eyck. PETRUS CHRISTUS: Renaissance Master of Bruges (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Abrams, $60) teases out the obviously derivative elements of Christus's small oeuvre from his perhaps minor but nonetheless significant contributions to Renaissance Flemish panel painting. As Maryan W. Ainsworth, a senior research fellow at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, shows in her scholarly essay, Christus married his intimate knowledge of illumination techniques to the new medium of oil painting. His often diminutive, richly detailed panels shimmer with color. Ms. Ainsworth's painstaking examination of the artist's technique, aided by scientific analyses of the underpaintings, quite conclusively distinguishes Christus's slightly dreamy artistic sensibility from that of the what-you-see-is-what-you-get realism of van Eyck. However, in her zeal to restore Christus's status as an original artist, the author sometimes glosses over his obvious deficiencies -- Christus's portraits (which, although expertly executed, do tend to look alike) are described as ""consistent in their physiognomy."" However, while the book sometimes plunges the layman deep into the arcane world of art conservation with its abstruse terminology, it does succeed in bringing to life not just the work of Christus, but also his richly adorned (and beautifully painted) world of the 15th century's wealthy and devout.SIRI HUNTOON",1994-09-11T05:00:00+0000

A Hard Day's Disk","WHAT The CD-ROM version of ""A Hard Day's Night,"" the first Beatles movie, which turned 30 this year. In 1964, the film blazed a trail for rock video (the film critic Andrew Sarris has called it ""the 'Citizen Kane' of jukebox movies""). The CD-ROM version, released last year, was the first feature film to be squeezed in its entirety onto a compact disk.A MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR The disk, available for Macintosh and for Windows, contains more than just the complete 90-minute film. It also has the full script; 166 screens of trivia-filled written commentary about the making of the film and about its principals; the movie's trailer; two shorter, earlier films made by its director, Richard Lester, and a videotaped interview with Mr. Lester. The software on the disk also allows the viewer to search for any word in the film or commentary (""lad,"" for example, appears in the script three times).TELL ME WHY Of all the movies available for conversion to CD-ROM, this one was chosen because it's a musical (people with multimedia computers want multiple media, including music, in their software), because it's the Fab Four (who are still a favorite of collectors, the trivia-obsessed and scholars) and because of the black-and-whiteness. Mr. Lester chose black and white film to lend a documentary quality to the movie's scripted version of two days in the lives of the Beatles. Color video, when digitized, requires at least twice as much computer power and disk storage as black and white. The movie, stored digitally in a computer-video format called Quicktime, plays back on a typical computer screen at 2 by 2.75 inches. The disk's publisher, the Voyager Company in New York, turned this limitation into an advantage, filling the rest of the screen with other elements, like the commentary. The CD sells for $39.95 at computer software stores.BWOOONNNNNNNGGGG! Voyager also exploits what may be the most famous chord in rock history, which opens the title tune: a G major chord over D with a suspended 4th, according to ""The Beatles Complete Scores"" (Hal Leonard, 1993; $59.95). George Harrison strummed it on a prototype of the Rickenbacker 360, a 12-string electric guitar. Bruce Eder, a film and rock critic who prepared the commentary that scrolls alongside the video, writes that the slightly dissonant chord ""sets up the entire movie -- the conflict between old and new, the expectations of the old versus the young, and the sense of a new culture, rock-and-roll culture, defining itself against the grain of post-war society.""

Bosley Crowther, reviewing the film in The New York Times, called it ""a whale of a comedy."" But it helps if one digs mid-60's British humor. (Interviewer: ""What would you call that hairstyle?""

us,Business Diary: September 4 - 9,"COMPANIES Is Ford a Monarchy or Not? (Check Back in a Few Years) ""There are no crown princes,"" Henry Ford 2d once said. Hmmmmm. Was it pure coincidence, or pure merit, that put the founder's grandson on top for a generation? Or, in true kingly fashion, was he exempting himself but saying family ties would carry no weight in the next generation? So it's been for over a decade, with commoners running the show after 75 years of monarchy. The catch is, the princes and their cousins own the place, or enough of it to call the shots. So everyone's been scanning the family tree for the one true heir. Two possibilities: Edsel 2d and William Jr. Both became directors in 1988, creating an instant horse race. It was neck-and-neck until last week, when William Jr., 37, was named to head the powerful finance committee. Is all now crystal clear? One observer called it ""excellent preparatory ground for his becoming chairman,"" while others thought Ford's managers were merely appeasing the family. American Express, Off Its Perch As revolving credit rolled across the land, American Express, with its high annual fees and schoolmarmish insistence on paying off balances every month, started falling behind. The public wanted credit, not cachet. So last week American Express got off its perch and offered its first card with no annual fee. What's more, the Optima True Grace Card -- no, salvation is not included -- offers a ""true"" grace period before the interest monster starts chewing, rather than having interest start on the day of purchase for those who keep a balance. It had to have some gimmick. Ozzie and Harriet They Aren't One wonders what the Haft family dinner table was like in happier days. Were there battles over who sat at the head, who got the biggest piece of pie? If so, that past was small-potatoes prelude; the squabbles get bigger by the day. Let's see: when last we tuned in to this executive-suite soap opera, Herbert Haft had fired a son and a wife and installed another son, Ronald, as Dart Group's president. But now Ronald, in an effort to oust his father as chairman, exercised options to increase his voting power to 44 percent. To get control, though, he'll need other family members' support; remembering the past, they may just nibble their own pie. In a truce last week, Dart decided a group of outside directors would run things for a while, and stockholders liked that idea fine. Just look below. Inching Away From Bhopal For a decade now, the names Bhopal and Union Carbide have been stuck together with the glue of nightmare. A gas leak from a Carbide pesticide plant in 1984 killed 4,000 and caused lingering health problems for thousands of others, making it the worst industrial accident in history, so that glue will hold in memory for decades more. But now at least the business bonds have been severed. Last week Carbide sold its stake in the plant to a Calcutta company, with the $90 million in proceeds set aside for thousands of victims and survivors. More than $20 million will go for a 500-bed hospital to be built in Bhopal. Barbarians at Old Gates The 90's must be sadly short of takeover battlegrounds, because two of the biggest dealmakers of the age are now forced to refight a battle from the glorious 80's. Kohlberg, Kravis, led by Henry Kravis, bought a Florida company called Walter Industries in 1987 with the investment-banking help of Leon Black. But things soon got messy: after Walter was forced into bankruptcy, Mr. Black -- now calling himself an empire builder in the Warren Buffett mold -- started buying its debt. But Kohlberg, Kravis now says Mr. Black is using confidential information to help him grab the company, and last week it filed suit to try to stop him. THE ECONOMY Car Buyers: Yes, Still There Car buyers didn't disappear, they just took July off -- mainly because the cars weren't there. After July's weak sales, car makers blamed low inventories, while others sniffed cooling economic winds. But Detroit was right: in August the cars were back in showrooms -- and buyers showed up. Figures out last week showed a 10.3 percent rise from the previous August. The auto industry is counting on more of the same; a quarter of the vehicles on the road are at least a decade old, and enough is fast becoming enough. What's That? Inflation? The statistics gods must have decided that things were getting too quiet, that people were getting too blase about inflation. For last week, out of the blue, came word that producer prices took a 0.6 percent leap in August, the biggest monthly rise in nearly four years. Yes, one month's data mean nothing; no, rising producer prices don't automatically mean higher overall inflation. But the markets have to react to something, so stock and bond prices plunged on the news. So if inflation does in fact appear, does that mean the Fed rate increases have failed? Not really, for economists say it takes six months or so for rate tinkering to make itself felt. Is the Fed's Voice Cracking? We hear it all the time: the Fed does this, the Fed's about to do that. And the image that comes to mind is either of Alan Greenspan, the chairman, or of a monolithic body, acting in resounding unity. It ain't necessarily so. Alan Blinder, the vice chairman, made some remarks recently that suggested that Fed interest-rate policy was not all sweetness and harmony -- that he might be a bit less willing to raise rates when unemployment is high. This naturally caused an uproar, because when the Fed mops its brow, a million fans go on. So last week, Mr. Blinder rushed back into line, denying any policy differences. One moral, he said: ""If you are on a central bank board, you ought to keep your mouth shut."" Health Care: No Band-Aids If a dike has two holes, it does no good to fix just one. That was the argument used by Representative Jim McDermott last week as he urged Congress to do nothing on health care this year, saying a piecemeal approach would make things worse. Uninsured patients are ""the leak in the dike,"" he said. ""Either you fix the dike or you face the flood. And without universal coverage, the flood is uncontrollable health care costs."" His is a potent voice on the issue, for Mr. McDermott had gathered wide support for his own plan, a sweeping ""single payer"" system -- Government pays the bills. INTERNATIONAL Statistics Don't Lie, People Do Finally, someone said it. Ever since the first economic statistics bubbled forth from that primordial computer, politicians have twisted them, put bows in their hair, buried them or shouted them -- always making the facts fit their fancy. But Brazil's Finance Minister, Rubens Ricupero, recently spoke a rare, glorious truth when he said of economic data: ""What is good, we take advantage of. What is bad, we hide."" And though it was all too redundant: ""I have no scruples."" An uncontrollable urge to come clean, a yearning for a new era of honesty? Hardly. After a TV interview, he thought the cameras were off. They weren't. Brazil has a new Finance Minister. Bank of Cards in Mexico Things have been hopping in Mexico since Nafta, and Carlos Cabal Paniche was in the thick of it, creating the nation's No. 4 bank and making deals to buy big American food companies. But the bubble burst last week: the Government took control of the bank, a warrant was issued for Mr. Cabal's arrest on charges that he fraudulently lent himself up to $700 million, and Mr. Cabal was nowhere in sight. Now, as one Mexican consultant put it, ""A lot more questions are going to be asked"" about cross-border deals. What Is a Car Anyway? Surely the oddest skirmishing in the auto wars with Japan is the endless bickering over whether those odd hybrids that make suburbanites feel as if they're on safari -- ""sport-utility vehicles"" -- are meant for people or cargo. They didn't become such hot sellers by hauling hay, but Customs still slapped a 25 percent ""cargo vehicle"" tariff on two-door imports (vs. 2.5 percent for cars). Last week, though, a Federal court ruled that a two-door Nissan Pathfinder was wrongly classified as a cargo vehicle. So, Ford Explorer and your rugged friends, watch out: you may not have a lock on this market for long.",1994-09-11T05:00:00+0000

Pataki have bobbed and feinted in a round of preliminary recriminations. But as the general election campaign for governor of New York got under way in earnest this week, the commercials cut straight to the chin. Page 1. NEW YORK CITY A SCHOOL ATTEMPTS TO RETURN TO NORMAL On the sidewalks outside Sheepshead Bay High School in Brooklyn, where one student shot another earlier this week, the debate was about guns and violence, safety and education. Some students talked about fear and distrust, unreported incidents, security guards carrying weapons. Administrators urged calm in front of a half-dozen television cameras. The police, who were everywhere, predicted a quick return to normalcy. Suddenly, all debate halted. A detective burst from an unmarked car, raced into the school and emerged with a student. Page 27. A TASTE OF INFAMY FOR FAMOUS RAY After decades in which pizza makers have battled one another for the right to call themselves Ray, the drug bust at Famous Original Ray's Pizzeria on Third Avenue near 43d Street was causing strains. Even though the United States Attorney said that the crimes were limited to the one store and that no chain was involved, some of the Rays were worried. At his Columbus Avenue pizzeria, Rosolino Mangano was clearly shaken. Rosolino Mangano is the original and famous Rosolino. He is the man who by his own account put the Ray in pizza.

POLICE MERGER PLAN ADVANCES With the conditional approval of the Federal Government, Mayor Giuliani signed a memorandum of understanding with the New York City Housing Authority setting down the terms for a merger of the housing police and the New York City Police Department.

REGION RAIL WORKERS THREATEN ACTION Frustrated that negotiations for a three-year contract have dragged on for nearly three years, some employees at the Metro-North Commuter Railroad say they may disrupt operations with illegal job actions between now and Election Day, Nov. 8. Many of the 5,000 unionized employees are seeking pay parity with their counterparts at the Long Island Rail Road, who have historically been higher paid and who won significant raises after a brief strike earlier this summer. Page 28. TAX BREAKS FOR CARS USING CLEAN FUEL Two months ago, Connecticut staked out a new position among states with air pollution problems: it opened up its checkbook. Under a new law that energy experts say is only the second in the nation, Connecticut announced that any commercial fleet operator that wanted to convert vehicles from ozone-spewing gasoline to cleaner fuels like natural gas or electricity would get a tax break. For every dollar spent on conversion or on building alternative fueling stations, fleet owners could deduct 50 cents from their corporate profits tax. After the conversion, the new fuel would be exempted from the 31-cents-a-gallon state fuel tax. Page 28. MORE POLICE FOR SAME TAXES IN SUFFOLK The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J.

Half of the country's people are believed to be living in exile, and many feel they are forgotten by the outside world. 3 SOUTH KOREAN CRACKDOWN The South Korean Government has been cracking down on leftists at the very time when the death of the longtime leader in Communist North Korea would seem to improve the prospects of peace. 3 U.S. CHALLENGES TOKYO BIDS The United States sued 53 Japanese companies in Tokyo, accusing them of colluding on bids for work at a naval base in Japan.37 CONCESSIONS ON ULSTER Britain, bowing to Protestants, said it would hold a referendum in Northern Ireland before making any move to change its status, but it also lifted a broadcast ban on the Irish Republican Army. 4 Sweden's rightist leadership is likely to be voted out of office. 4 Some Germans are working to maintain American ties. 5 Vijaka Journal: The will to go home in Bosnia. 4 National 9-11 JURY AWARD IN VALDEZ SPILL A Federal jury in Anchorage ordered Exxon to pay $5 billion to 10,000 Alaska fishermen and thousands of others who said they were harmed by the Valdez oil spill. 1 MAKING HARD TIME HARDER Elected officials around the country are trying to make prison life harsher by taking away televisions, tennis and basketball courts, weight rooms, pornography and more. 1 NEW SIGNS OF GROWTH Industrial production and factory operating rates rose sharply in August, raising the possibility that the American economy might experience a new surge of growth and with it more inflation. 1 DISCOVERY'S HUMAN SATELLITES Two astronauts unhooked their lifelines to the space shuttle and flew free in the first untethered space walk in 10 years. 9 CHRISTIAN COALITION CONVENES As Pat Robertson's political group opened its convention, almost every Republican Presidential hopeful was on its list of speakers. 9 CAMPUS SUSPENSION OVERTURNED A Federal judge found that the University of New Hampshire had erred in suspending a writing professor for sexual harassment. 9 CNN GIVES CLOSING ARGUMENT CNN asked a Federal judge to disregard the network's original explanations for broadcasting recorded calls by Gen.

You reach the top of the hill, and suddenly the woods have dropped away and you are at the edge of the moor itself, with sweeping views of the Bristol Channel, slate gray, the blue line of the Welsh coast on the rim of the horizon and the great green flanks of the land tipping down to the sea. Turn away from the sea, and there are soft shoulders of moor in all directions, with Dunkery Beacon, the highest point in Somerset, rising to meet the swags of pewter-gray cloud.

Leaving the Brooklyn Bridge Behind","The Italian-born Joseph Stella (1877-1946) has long been acclaimed America's most important Futurist painter; his depiction of the Brooklyn Bridge remains his signature image. But the painting's success, writes Barbara Haskell, a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, was Stella's albatross. ""Heralded as 'the most successful piece of American modernism,' "" she writes in JOSEPH STELLA (Whitney Museum of American Art/Abrams, $60), ""it was also cited as an achievement Stella never surpassed."" Inspired by Walt Whitman, Edgar Allan Poe and Hart Crane, Stella imbued his Futurist paintings with spiritual significance; he was also, Ms. Haskell writes, ""alone among the Futurists in aligning the subject matter of technological life to a style that encapsulated the dynamism and speed which technology engendered."" Stella was always an outsider, even in the artistic community, and in the early 1920's he turned away from New York and from modernism, spending most of the rest of his life in Europe. There he executed paintings of symbolic landscapes and religious images that would dominate his work until his death -- work that was largely ignored. Indeed, one critic argued that it was easy to agree Stella had talent, but not so easy to agree on the use he made of it. What is clear, however, from this richly illustrated book is Stella's versatility: the superb draftsmanship of his early sketches of Ellis Island immigrants, the famous Futurist paintings, the fine collages never exhibited during his lifetime, as well as the later landscape and religious paintings. As Ms. Haskell concludes, ""It is perhaps only now, in a post-modernist era, that the baroque exuberance and unrestrained theatricality of Stella's art can be fully understood and embraced."" Her elegantly and persuasively written book makes one hope so.ROBIN LIPPINCOTT",1994-09-18T05:00:00+0000

When I sang the song at the start of each game, I just changed the words from ""the land of the free and the home of the Braves"" to ""the land of the free and the home of the Red Sox.""

us,Making the Library a Data Highway On-Ramp,"Early this month, Gary E. Strong took over as director of the Queens Borough Public Library. As State Librarian of California for the last 14 years, Mr. Strong oversaw a system that carried books in 100 languages. Last week, Mr. Strong sat for an interview at the Flushing Library. Here are some of his comments. Q. In what new ways will the Queens Library serve its members? A. We want to be sure that every branch is an on-ramp onto the information superhighway so that people can use the libraries from home computers, from schools, from offices or in the library itself -- that they have access equitably with all the people across the United States. Many people can't purchase home computers, or don't have that capability at their workplace. If you're a student who can't afford a computer, you're also disenfranchised. So the library can be a common ground, a leveling influence. Q. How will you start doing this specifically? A. We will initially train our staff to do that surfing, getting around the Internet, getting the answers in, very likely in the same way we've delivered them to the public before. Our on-line catalog, as we bring that out throughout the entire system over the next several years, will have an Internet connection in it, so that someone using our on-line catalogue can not only find out what is available in our collection but will have access to our resources in CD-ROM, and other connections that will definitely emerge. Q. What problems do you encounter when a library tries to serve a community as diverse as Queens? A.First and foremost, we're developing collections in many languages other than English -- and collections that represent not only the popular new material in those languages but the classics that stand up along Shakespeare, Milton and Chaucer. . . . One of things I've learned over the years is that people come to a library, particularly a new user, with very different backgrounds. The Russian population comes with a strong tradition of public library service. . . . Someone coming from a Central American country or other third world countries -- while there may have been libraries, they were often for the elite and educated in society. The practice in those countries is also that you don't borrow anything . . . because books are so scarce or because the contents of books were so controlled by the regimes in power. . . . So an initial step is to show how we use a public library in Queens. N.O.",1994-09-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Quitters Never Win,"Day 1: Wake up and put on nicotine patch to once and for all quit pack-a-day habit. Write a list of reasons: Live 15 years longer, have healthy children, be socially acceptable. Tear up list and make better one: Look younger, have fewer wrinkles, get more dates, spite enemies. Decide to go out and buy carrots, celery, gum, orange juice, fruit, sugar-free lollipops and rice cakes. Eat it all by 11 A.M., desperately craving cigarette. Try to work. Instead take all-day nap. Have a drink later with old boyfriend Peter, who says, ""Kissing a smoker is like licking a dirty ashtray,"" then drinks seven beers and a Cognac and comes on to me. Actually consider it, but can't face sex without a cigarette later. At 2 A.M., go out and purchase three packages of fat-free Entenmann's brownies. Day 2: Wake up sick from brownies and cold caught walking 14 blocks to get them at 2 A.M. Put on patch. Buy Sudafed. Take two. Feel better. Feel delirious. Take a nap. Try to work, but can't concentrate on anything but wanting to smoke. One hour on exercise bike: Oprah's ""Mothers Who Want Their Kids Taken Away"" puts problem into perspective. Read that schizophrenics and manic-depressives in mental hospitals commit suicide when their cigarettes are taken away. Decide never to have children. Ask brother the doctor for 65 more patches. Take another Sudafed. Is there a Sudafed group in the city? Day 3: Put on patch. Have breakfast with friend Vern, who says that after he quit smoking, his concentration didn't come back for two years. Scan obits for people who died of lung cancer and feel happy when they're in their 50's. Take a nap, dream I'm smoking and feel sad that I went off the wagon. Wake up and find I'm not but want to be. Take 100 deep breaths. Breathing is overrated. Take a walk and count how many stores on the blocks sell cigarettes. Get more patches in mail from brother, along with pictures of cancerous tumors. Try to work. See a movie with Peter in which all actors smoke. Eat two buckets of popcorn. Peter says: ""My cousin Janet quit in three days on Nicorettes. Try Nicorettes,"" though I told him I tried them and threw up, then went out and smoked two packs to get the taste out of my mouth. Don't invite him in. Read that nicotine's harder to quit than heroin. Take another Sudafed. Day 4: Put on patch. Think of smoking. Brother calls to say don't even think of smoking with patch on, someone's fingers fell off. Lunch with Andrea, who coughed every time I took out a cigarette for 15 years but now says, ""I can't hang out with you when you're like this, you're too intense."" Bump into old colleague Dave, who quit smoking and gained 29 pounds in four months but thinks it was the smart choice. Consider heroin. Try to work but realize it's impossible to be a freelance writer, a nonsmoker and thin in the same year. Sudafed losing its bite, check into Comtrex. Negotiate self-destructive behaviors: decide that taking sleeping pill, smoking a joint, getting drunk or having sex with Peter one more time is better than a Marlboro or Oreos, though not if done on the same night. Day 5: Put on patch. Feel depressed and edgy, sweating. Hand shaking while reading the paper, where tobacco company executives say nicotine isn't addictive. Buy a pacifier, pretending it's a cool rap toy, wondering why anyone expects morality from the people who plastered penis-faced camels all over the country. Think of 10 70-year-old smokers still alive. Dinner with novelist friend Kathy, who chain-smokes in my face while saying she thinks it's great that I'm quitting. On way home, try to buy a 25-cent loosie (loose cigarette) at local bodega but guy thinks I'm cigarette police. Take it as an omen. Try to think of one famous writer who doesn't drink or smoke. Day 6: Put patch on. Walk around city chewing. Do high-impact aerobics for three hours. Walk out of health club wanting cigarette. Stare at people smoking and wonder why they look so beautiful and happy. Think of money I'm saving from not smoking. Spend $46 on seven boxes of fat-free cookies, 27 cinnamon sticks and three Lean Cuisines. Snap rubber band around wrist 100 times. My father, an oncologist, says, ""You'll never do it,"" forgetting that when he quit his 35-year three-pack-a-day habit he gained 35 pounds and smoked a six-inch cigar every night. Decide neurosis is genetic. On stationary bike watch ""Saturday Night Live,"" which quotes tobacco company execs saying that the 400,000 annual smoking-related deaths aren't really dead. Neighbor complains bike makes too much noise. Do serenity exercises. Picture sitting on a tropical beach, where I'm happily smoking. Day 7: Put on patch. Have brunch with Peter, who says, while drinking six margaritas, that I've gained weight and need to learn more self-control. Make note to quit Peter. Read article about Bosnia, noticing only that soldier in picture is smoking. Eat more celery, fruit, salad. Polish off Oreos. Feel sick and bloated, dying for cigarette. Take off patch. Run outside. Bum cigarette from homeless person, who lights it. Puff slowly. Feel happy for the first time in six days. Stop coughing, calm down. Finish two articles. Go back outside, offer same guy $2 for two more cigarettes. Smoke them quickly. Feel nauseated, dizzy. Bump into Vern and Andrea, who say: ""We were just coming by to say how proud we are that you haven't smoked in a week! Congratulations!"" Feel guilty, defeated. Drink bottle of wine by myself. Fall asleep on couch with clothes on.",1994-09-18T05:00:00+0000

Say Cheese And Smile A Big Smile","WHAT The Polaroid 20 by 24 Land Camera, a 235-pound large-format camera that produces 20-by-24-inch color photographs in 70 seconds. Mounted on wheels, it stands five feet tall and is so unwieldy that a crew of three is needed to operate it. Introduced in 1978 by Edwin H. Land, inventor of the Polaroid Land Camera, the 20 by 24 has evolved from a novelty, intended to impress Polaroid shareholders, to an invaluable photographic tool.RAISON D'ETRE First, portraiture. The film used, Polacolor ER, renders flattering skin tones, making the camera ideal for portraits. Second, art. Working with instant exposure is similar to painting or sculpturing; the artist gets immediate feedback. This has attracted artists like Andy Warhol and Robert Frank. Also, because of its large print size and high resolution, the format is ideal for museums that want photographs of their collections. And third, sheer size.CAMERA OBSCURE There are only five 20 by 24 Polaroid Land Cameras in the world. Two -- one in Prague, the other in New York -- are available for rental. ""Our camera is by far the most accessible,"" said John Reuter, the studio director at the Polaroid Studio in lower Manhattan. ""Anyone who comes up with the rental fee can shoot pictures.""FLASHBULBS INCLUDED? Yes. The $1,100 rental fee buys eight hours of studio time, camera rental, lights and technical assistance. And $32 is added to the bill for each photograph taken.BIG SHOTS Although the 20 by 24 is often referred to as a cult camera, some artists have used it to create some mainstream images. Current examples: the September issue of Manner Vogue, with a series of portraits shot by the celebrity photographer Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, and the September issue of Harper's Bazaar, with a photo spread by the film director Tim Burton. Possibly the best known images are of William Wegman's Weimaraners.""ACTION!"" Shooting with the 20 by 24 may be the next best thing to being Steven Spielberg. Mr. Burton said in Harper's Bazaar, ""You need a cameraman and a crew, so it's sort of like making a movie, only without the studio executives hanging over your shoulder.""BIG ART Major museums have Polaroid 20 by 24 photographs in their collections: the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. ""What's most distinctive about these photographs isn't their size, but the esthetic involved,"" said Peter Gulassi, chief curator of the department of photography at the Museum of Modern Art.SAY CHEESE! The Industria Superstudio in Greenwich Village is the host today of ""Kids 4 Kids,"" to benefit the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Those who have paid $750 to attend will have the opportunity to take home a free portrait of themselves.SOMEBODY SAID ""FREE""? Anyone who would like to experiment with the 20 by 24 may submit a project proposal to Barbara Hitchcock at the Polaroid Artist Support Program, Polaroid Corporation, 575 Technology Square, Cambridge, Mass. 02139. Those who receive grants can use the camera for one day, free of charge. Polaroid selects one of every four of theirprints for its permanent collection.RENE CHUN",1994-09-25T05:00:00+0000

That's a ""healthy response"" to Pentagon cutbacks, said one consultant. But don't talk about health on, say, Long Island. In 1986, Grumman gave out 25,000 paychecks there, making it Long Island's largest private employer; those days are already history, of course, but the payroll will soon shrivel even more, to 3,800.

us,Haunted by History,"Haunting and heartbreaking, Shimon Attie's photomontages of Jewish street life in Berlin before the Holocaust are layered in metaphor. While doing archival research in Berlin in 1991, Mr. Attie, a San Francisco artist, found himself wondering what became of the Jewish community there. He projected slides of prewar German Jewish life onto housefronts standing today, using the original sites whenever possible: images of a Talmud school, Hebrew bookstore, kosher butcher, Jewish theater, Torah reading room, along with a religious book salesman and other Jewish residents, are juxtaposed with a mundane, modern railroad station, buildings, highways, cars and billboards. In an essay accompanying THE WRITING ON THE WALL: Projections in Berlin's Jewish Quarter (Edition Braus/Phillip Galgiani, P.O. Box 457, Prince Street Station, New York, N.Y., 10012, $30), Michael Andre Bernstein, a professor of English literature at the University of California, Berkeley, eloquently discusses Mr. Attie's photographic techniques and the emotional textures they render. Erwin Leiser, a German writer and film maker living in Zurich, provides a moving colloquial history of anti-Semitism in Berlin before and during World War II, when synagogues were set ablaze, Jewish-owned businesses were looted and tens of thousands of Jews were transported to concentration camps. Yet Mr. Attie's 30 reproductions need no explanation. Every page seems to prove that evil can't be erased, that stores, windows and lampposts bear their own witness and that Jewish ghosts remain forever ensconced in the streets where they were betrayed.

The inquiry into the crash, which killed 37 of the 57 people on board the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, focused on three principal areas: whether air traffic controllers relayed pertinent information to the pilots as quickly and fully as they could have whether the Charlotte airport's severe weather warning system was adequate and whether the pilots took appropriate evasive action quickly enough. While the board's conclusions will not be final for months, here are major pieces of information investigators have gleaned about the last 60 seconds before the crash. 1) :60 The plane is on final approach. The pilots of the plane have heard alerts for wind shear -- sudden, dangerous shifts in wind speed or direction -- for areas to the east of them; two pilots on the ground have decided to delay takeoff. Earlier, Capt. Michael Greenlee, the USAir pilot, had noted there was a ""chance of shear."" But reports from other pilots indicate smooth conditions, and the tower reports moderate winds.",1994-09-26T05:00:00+0000
