us,Screen: Many Lives of 'The Ski Bum':Work by Bruce Clark Begins Local Run Joseph Mell Plays the Ubiquitous Burt Stone,"Bruce Clark's ""The Ski Bum"" ought to have something besides a movie review. It ought to have something on the model of those book-review ads, compulsively readable, that promote a certain kind of unfashionably popular fiction just by listing the lives and loves of the characters.For example: BURT STONEhis money could buy him a mountain, but not the heart of his wife LIZ. Rich and restless, she hardly noticed that her daughter LISA already had the thoughts and the needs of a woman. But SAMANTHA noticed. Swinging hostess of Newday, Colorado's plushest ski resort, she kept a secret, but could she keep peace between Burt Stone and JOHNNYThe Ski Bum, who loved the freedom of the slopes, but wanted Samantha even more than he wanted to be free . . .And so on through a cast of dozens. Samantha's secret, by the way, is a Chinese husband named Otto, who works for Burt Stone, like everybody else in the moviewhich takes us into the story, which is a mistake. For ""The Ski Bum,"" it is much more fun to say who's in it than to tell what's going on.Often you can't really tell what's going on because of a penchant of the filmmakers for starting and stopping each sequence in the middle, without much thought for a beginning or an end. But it is an action of some importance, ultimately stranding Johnny in a lonely phone booth half way up the ski lift in the midst of a raging snowstorm. He has been trying without luck to make a date with Samantha, and his final situation, according to the distributor's plot synopsis (in many ways, better than the movie) is ""quietly symbolic of the emotional insularity of Western man today.""Almost everybody in ""The Ski Bum"" is first rate, much too good for the material, with special honors to Joseph Mell as the ubiquitous Burt Stone and Lori Shelle as his emotionally mature daughter. The only performance I didn't like was that of Zalman King, who plays his snow-bound Ski Bum as if he were searching for a viable relation between Hamlet and the Little Match Girl.",1971-12-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Mitchum and Brenda Vaccaro Star in 'Going Home',"At the age of 6, Jimmy Graham awakens in the middle of the night to hear his father beating his mother. A minute afterwards, she staggers down the stairs  her throat freshly cut  to die at the feet of the stunned child.Thireen years later, Jimmy, the obviously troubled product of county farms and foster homes, seeks out his recently paroled father with some vague ideas of revenge. Jimmy is seething with rage but, for most of ""Going Home,"" he is impotent, trapped by traumatic memories that allow him to do little more than write graffiti on men's walls: ""Beware of Harry K. Graham he killed his wife.""After this description of the beginning of ""Going Home,"" you will, I hope, be as surprised as I was to learn that it is apparently meant to be an optimistic movie. At the endafter some further melodramatic incidents that I'd just as soon forgetJimmy hits the road, the hint of healthy resolution on his face, older and maybe wiser, but, it would seem to me (if not the movie), sicker than ever.""Going Home,"" which opened yesterday at the Victoria and other theaters around town, is an exceedingly nasty movie. Based on an original screenplay by Lawrence B. Marcus, it is the first directorial effort of Herbert B. Leonard, the producer of ""Popi,"" that lovable, laughable family comedy set in rat-infested Spanish Harlem.Like ""Popi,"" ""Going Home"" exploits the sorrows of its characters as well as the intelligence of its audience, as much through ineptitude as through conscious decision.In the opening scene, for example, Mr. Leonard chooses to show us the unshowable: Jimmy's mother descending the stairs in a kind of death spasm. Actually she looks as if she just had a bad scratch. This might, I suppose, be interpreted as good taste, since we don't really want to see the blood spurting out. However, by cutting away from the horror on the child's face, which would be enough to set the film's premise, he also introduces a not-so-Grand Guignol effect that simply cheapens the drama.Even worse is Mr. Marcus's explanation of why the father, played by Robert Mitchum as if he were a high school football coach, took the knife to his wife in the first place: He was drunk.""Going Home"" is more objectionable, more pernicious, than other, much dumber movies because it appears to have some surface intelligence. The film was photographed on location in New Jersey and captures, visually anyway, the feeling of lives lived in trailer camps, bowling alleys, roadhouses and amusement parks. Also, two of its three major performers are exceptionally good.Mitchum has reached that point in his career where he doesn't seem to act as much as inhabit whatever film he's in, whatever role he's playing, whether it's an Irish school-master, an Australian sheepherder or, as here, a nice, well-meaning garage mechanic with a talent for bowling. I also liked Brenda Vaccaro as his mistress, a tough, understanding broad who knows, as we do, that Mitchum couldn't possibly hurt anyone, even when drunk.Unfortunately, Jan-Michael Vincent is impossible as the son, admittedly an impossible role that requires the actor to be simultaneously appealing and psychotic. He's very handsome and very young and he has a lot to learn about acting, including how to hiccup with conviction.",1971-12-02T05:00:00+0000

us,G.I.'s and O.J.'s In Vietnam,"The space measured about 5 by 10 feet, contained two stacked bunks, a makeshift small chair and plain boards arranged as shelves. A thin wood and cloth partition about 5feet high provided only a little privacy from the rest of the barracks, which housed about 40 men. One of the men whose space this was had invited me in to rap about the Army in Vietnam and how E.M.'s (enlisted men) deal with the nonwar war. Others had anecdotes to add, and shortly 10 men had crowded into the space. As the discussion be came more animated, one man pulled out a cigarette and began to roll it between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand. After a while, I began to recognize this as a characteristic gesture. With his right hand he pulled from his pocket a small, greenish vial filled with white pow der and poured it into the partially emptied cigarette. He lit up, took a deep puff and passed the O.J. (opium joint) around. Most of those in the group took a hit, but two or three, including Tom, the 20yearold host who had recently gotten himself off a 15vialaday habit, said, No.",1971-12-05T05:00:00+0000
us,Music,"THOSE who go to conservatories and professional music schools are much like students at medical schools. They are there for one purpose, to learn a particular skill, in their case, the art of per forming or composing. Medical students, however, have passed the college level and can concentrate on their field to the exclusion of other subjects. At conservatories, the budding musicians are normally at college level and required to take standard liberal arts courses. Since be coming a pianist, violinist, singer, or what have you, takes so much dedication and time, these students are apt to resent the other areas of learning, finding them irrelevant. The Manhattan School of Music is trying to do some thing about this, and they have instituted this fall a Unified Academic Program. It is an interdisciplinary program, already used in regular colleges and univer sities but, as far as David Simon, Manhattan's dean, knows, is new to music schools. We have a great abundance of talent here, Simon says, and with that talent goes a great deal of intel ligence. While the students are superior, they lack motiva tion. In trying to find what would most motivate them, we have changed the traditional role of the instructor. He doesn't tell the students what has to be learned any more. He meets with them and lets them about themselves, society, education. The instructor does not attempt to answer the ques tions, but suggests readings all kinds and lots of it, in cluding explosive literature. The students write papers and they go on field trips to hospitals, ghettos and similar places. We do not feel the program is experimental, but we do look on it as a safety device.",1971-12-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Hagmann's 'Believe in Me':Work on Drug Culture Begins Local Run Sarrazin Stars in Role of Expelled Interne,"Not hash, not horse, but speed is of the essence in Stuart Hagmann's ""Believe in Me,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters. Remy, an interne in a New York City hospital, and Pamela, an editor of children's books, middle class, and by drug-culture standards all but middle-aged, take to each other and take to amphetamines, and thereby lose their jobs, their money, and all their self-respect.Because it avoids most extremes of up or down or in between, ""Believe in Me"" also avoids some of the melodramatics that plague the drug movie and that tend to take the place of motivation with characters who are always allowed first causes, but rarely genuine motives. Addiction comes with a certain efficient flash (three diet pills, and Pam turns into a full-fledged, paranoid speed freak), but once arrived it settles in without too many predictable surprises or conventional crucial questionssuch as how Pam and Remy stay alive, or why.Given the flatness of her material, Jacqueline Bisset, an actress I normally worship just this side of idolatry, underplays Pamela to the point of indifference. But Michael Sarrazin, who does have some nice hospital bits before he is relieved of his residency, positively improves his chances in a performance that is genuinely understated rather than, as it is written, indistinct.""Believe in Me"" is full of plot hints dropped and never retrieved, and it seems to have been cutnot so much edited as maimed. When allowed some emotional range (as in a fine violent hallucination sequence by Kurt Dodenhoff, playing a teenage addict) Stuart Hagmann directs a rather decent movie. But such moments are too few, and in suppressing even pathos, the film also suppresses the other feelings that could have made it live.",1971-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Film of Vonnegut's 'Wanda June' Arrives,"In bringing Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s ""Happy Birthday, Wanda June"" to the screen, Mark Robson, the director who earlier gave us film versions of ""Peyton Place"" and ""Valley of The Dolls,"" was apparently attempting to make a movie, something with a lunatic heart and soul it could call its own.It's easy enough to understand what attracted Robson to the Vonnegut comedy, a modern odyssey's end about a Papa Hemingway type, a big game hunter, who comes home, after being lost eight years in the Amazon jungles, to find that he himself has become obsolete, and that his third wife, a former car-hop, has been college-educated into a woman of sense and sensibility. Its lines are funny, its outrage is genuine and its faith in the efficacy of adult re-eduction is most assuring.Instead of a movie, however, Robson has made a highly (and wrongly) mannered cinematic representation of the play. To see it is to observe what amounts to a religious service, a ritualistic exercise that tries, unsuccessfully, to evoke the spirit of a comedy that has been allowed to die in the limbo separating stage and screen.If the manner of the film is reverent (Vonnegut has not, as far as I can tell, altered his play to any major extent), the style is of a high artificiality that is completely beyond the range of the director and of at least half his cast, especially of Rod Steiger.As Ulysses (renamed Harold Ryan), Steiger achieves a new peak in acting that is humorlessly affected. Vonnegut is quoted somewhere as sayingrather apologeticallythat he doesn't write villains, and I assume that for all of Harold Ryan's nitwitted ideas about masculinity, about honor and killing and guns, and about the low estate of women, we are meant to sympathize with this mastadon at the moment of his extinction.Steiger's broad performance effectively massacres not only sympathy, but also the comedy that can still be fitfully seen behind the frantic pacing. The comedy is there, though almost lost, in the lines (""Educating a woman is like pouring honey over a fine Swiss watch  everything stops""), in the crazy set (an apartment that has a lion's roar as a doorbell), in the cuts to heaven (where everyone plays shuffleboard, including Pontius Pilate, and even in a few performances  of Susannah York, as Steiger's liberated Penelope, and William Hickey, as his private helicopter pilot, whose single claim to fame is that he dropped the atom bomb on Nagasaki during World War II.For the most part, however, Robson has permitted (or perhaps encouraged) his actors to behave in the sort of stylized manner that calls more attention to posture and to the reading of the lines than to what the postures and the lines represent. It all becomes very quickly fake and unfunny, like the boy who plays Steiger's son. My impression is that he's an old ham actor, somehow shrunk to child size without actually withering up, as might normally be expected.There is also a certain problem with Vonnegut's original text. His gags and jokes are meaner, funnier and more shocking than the humane impulses he would preserve, impulses that all of us good, decent, gentle, antiwar folk take for granted. That, I suppose, is as much our problem as it is Vonnegut's. So it goes.""Happy Birthday, Wanda June"" opened yesterday at the Columbia II.",1971-12-10T05:00:00+0000

But its stronger interests lie elsewhere; in the romantic intensity, sharp pathos or dark humor of episodes that involve the horse but are not so much about the horse as about the various people who own it, use and cherish or betray it. Whether in the dangers of a fox hunt near the beginning or in the darkness of the local mines where Black Beauty almost ends his days, the film creates an environment that is partly time and place, but is also the understanding of a privileged vision. There is some violence in Black Beauty and also a little sex, and I can't imagine that kids would mind. Thus, Black Beauty is perhaps sexy and violent enough for kids, but pleasant and pastoral enough for their parents. At neighborhood theaters.",1971-12-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: From Therapy to a Sad and Comic Marriage,"They meet at group therapy. He wants to expiate his guilt for all the broken female hearts and near-miss suicides that trail behind him like clouds of glory in his search for a right relationship. She would also like to escape her past. ""A failure in everything, in art as in life,"" after 10 years in group, she is still trying. She is Pandora Gold and he is Giggy Pinimba, both in their 30's, and on the grounds of emotional instability, intellectual incompatibility, and religious unsuitability (for starts) it should be clear that they are made for each other.At least, that is the premise of their movie, ""Made for Each Other,"" starring Renee Taylor as Panda and Joseph Bologna as Gig, written by Miss Taylor and Mr. Bologna, and directed by Robert B. Bean. It is the story of how two New Yorkers meet each other (or, more properly, fail to avoid each other), hurt each other, horrify each other's parents, and ultimately blunder their way into marriage. It is also comedy, uncomfortable comedy of a fairly unusual sort in that it locates the sources of everybody's vulnerability and does not disguise the misery of anybody's pain. Miss Taylor and Mr. Bologna (""Lovers and Other Strangers"") are a very serious comic team, and though their work virtually cries of warm humanity there are times when it seems somewhat closer to the clinic than to the heart.There are flashbacks from Panda's childhood and Gig's childhood, scenes from their previous affairsa pair of life histories that are often funny in detail but ultimately forbidding in mass. In a sense, we come to understand too muchso much that Panda and Gig lose some of the crucial element of surprise that really humanizes comic characters and take on a kind of rational complexity that by explaining, only seems to humanize them.Sometimes the aims of analysis and comedy work together perfectly, as in the nightclub act that Pandora has prepared for her artistic comeback, which she stages as an identity crisis. The audience is supposed to decide who she should be; she does a marvelously awkward rendition of ""Falling in Love Again"" from ""Der Blaue Engel"" (her German, not mine) and the audience loves her and decides she should be Rita Hayworth. This is a moment of real theater and a triumph for Pandora (and Miss Taylor), but such moments are more the exception than the rule.Nevertheless, ""Made for Each Other"" contains enough good writing for half a dozen better movies, and its performances do everyone proud. This includes all the parents, but especially Helen Verbit and Louis Zorich as Pandora's mother and her pandering dad, Norman Shelly as the doctor leading the marathon group, and Joseph Bologna as Gig, who finally chooses Pandora because with his other girls he's become impotent.But the film belongs to Renee Taylor, an intelligent actress and a fine comedienne who has mastered the art of seeming both ugly and beautiful at the same time, which is much of what her role and her movie are really all about.",1971-12-13T05:00:00+0000

us,' Nicholas and Alexandra' Depicts Fall of Romanovs,"It opens with a close-up so tight that the object seen is almost an abstract shape. It's a lamp in a bedchamber where a woman is giving birth to a son. The woman is the Empress Alexandra, the gently neurotic, German-born consort to Nicholas II, and her son is the hemophile czarevich, Alexis.Thereafter, for a little more than three hours, ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" keeps pulling back and back until its vision encompasses not only the last Romanov czar and his immediate family, but also cousins and uncles, family retainers, Rasputin, moderate politicians like Stolypin and Kerensky, revolutionaries like Lenin and Trotsky and Stalin, assorted proles and priests, the beginnings of World War I and, finally, the epic Bolshevik Revolution, which is still changing the look of this planet, and even Mars, where it recently made a soft landing.Sam Spiegel, the producer of the film; Franklin J. Schaffner, its director, and James Goldman, who adapted Robert K. Massie's huge, bestselling, carefully researched book, have made something much less than a great movie. However, ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" covers such an extraordinary period, events so bizarre, and a course of history so implacable, that I was fascinated even through its dopey failures.I have no way of knowing exactly, but most of these I would attribute to Mr. Goldman (""A Lion in Winter,"" ""They Might Be Giants""), whose job it was to dramatize a slice of history more complex than can be contained in any one film. Indeed, he hasn't really dramatized it. He has synopsized it, and popularized the rather sober documentations of Mr. Massie's book with fictional inventions of a sometimes ludicrous order.This is especially true of sequences dealing with the revolution, a subject dramatized with somewhat more passion and style by the Russians themselves in films I hope I need not mention. Thus we are introduced to cartoon characters  to an argumentative Trotsky, a ruthless Lenin and a ferret-eyed young man who says something on the order of: ""Hello. My name is Josef Stalin. . . ."" Mr. Goldman's dialogue does not exactly enhance these great moments of history.There is another problem with the film in that Nicholas and Alexandra are not really tragic characters, though the movie seems to pretend that they are. They are a nice, loving, fatally uninformed couple who, between them, were ultimately responsible for the death of something like 7 million subjects. One can be more or less hypnotized by the spectacle of their downfall, but it's difficult to be really moved by it.Curiously enough, there was some of this same confusion in attitude toward its subject in Mr. Schaffner's ""Pattorn,"" a much better and, ironically, a much more imperial film than ""Nicholas and Alexandra."" I, for one, miss here the marvelous, deep-focus photography that gave a panoramic sweep to Mr. Schaffner's film about the American general who was described as a 16th-century man in a 20th-century world. (Someone in ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" describes Russia as an 18th-century country in a 20th-century world  which may well prompt a few theses about the director's hang-up with people and things outside of their own times.)""Nicholas and Alexandra"" doesn't sweep. It jerksfrom vignette to great moment to vignette, some more effective than others. In the title roles, Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman, two young British performers, are, I think, immensely effective whenever the screenplay allows them to be. Mr. Goldman doesn't interfere with them to quite the same degree that he does the revolutionaries, although I was a bit taken aback when he has the czarevich turn on his father, after the abdication and while the family is awaiting execution, and berate him for having given away his family heritage.In addition to the two stars, I also liked Tom Baker's Rasputin, which is played as an outright rogue, and almost everyone in the supporting cast on the royalist sideHarry Andrews, Irene Worth, Laurence Olivier, Jack Hawkins and John McEnery who, as Kerensky, isn't exactly on the royalist side, but at least he is recognizable as a real character.The physical production is lovely  all that money can buyand since movie money is in such short supply these days, it may be as much the end of its line as Nicholas was of his. The film opened yesterday at the Criterion Theater, where, at the intermission of a preview performance, I heard someone remark: ""They've certainly inflated this story."" That's both unfair and incorrect. The problem with ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" is not inflation, but deflation, the attempt to cram too big a picture into too small a frame.",1971-12-14T05:00:00+0000

Second of all, by this business of age classifications. What purpose can It possibly serve to distinguish between 12  year  olds and teenagers, when even picture books are so often more sophisticated than socalled teenage novels? And third of all, by the continuing upsurge of socially significant books. Does a primer on ecology tell children more about marauding man than The Walrus and the Carpenter?

us,Screen: 'The Hospital',"""My God!"" shouts Dr. Herbert Bock (George C. Scott), the chief of medicine at a huge, modern New York City hospital that appears to be collapsing into premature ruins, ""the incompetence here is absolutely radiant!"" But, as his head nurse says, in the manner of someone who has seen Rome fall more than once: ""These things happen.""Among the things that happen in ""The Hospital,"" a very serious (in fact, perhaps, a little too serious), very funny melodramatic farce, are pilferage of equipment that amounts to piracy, a confrontation with a local action group that objects to the hospital's participation in slum clearance, a patient who dies after having been wrongly diagnosed, and a series of mysterious coincidences that threaten to push the mortality rate of the doctors and nurses higher than that of the ordinary Blue Cross subscribers.""The Hospital,"" is not, as you might be led to believe, the sort of pious, inside-institution literature that Arthur Hailey grinds out to satisfy the book clubs, if not the muses, nor is it really one of those malpractice horror stories that are so helpful in obtaining lecture tours for medical men.It deals in such horror stories, in grotesquely comic, inventive detail, but the ultimate concern of Arthur Hiller, who directed the film, and Paddy Chayefsky, who wrote the exuberant screenplay, is not the hospital but a social order that has grown so complex that it allows people to be forgotten to death, and is so full of awful contradictions that only escape, by one means or another, seems rational.Anyone who has seen or read Mr. Chayefsky's play (unproduced in New York). ""The Latent Heterosexual,"" must be aware that he is one of the few fine television writers (""Marty,"" ""Bachelor Party,"" etc.) of the 1950's who has continued to mature, to test his talent in rather brave, unpredictable ways that leave him open to disaster.Melodramatic farce is a pretty far remove from the slice-of-life things that Mr. Chayefsky once did so well. However, the writer's intelligence, and his only recently exercised gift for fantasy (which reminds me a bit of Evelyn Waugh's) save ""The Hospital"" from a couple of serious seizures that, toward the end, overtake the movie when it feels called upon to certify its serious purposes and to straighten out its peculiar plot. The latter involves, among other things, my favorite movie line of the year: ""God was admitted to this hospital last weekunder the name of Guernsey.""Mr. Hiller, who is a much better director than the scripts of ""Love Story"" and ""Popi"" could possibly indicate, works beautifully with Mr. Chayefsky, with whom he collaborated in 1964 on ""The Americanization of Emily."" It isn't simply that he obtains excellent performances from his stars, from Mr. Scott and especially from Diana Rigg, but he has perfectly cast the film down to roles that are so small they dependI suspectas much on natural mannerism as on acting talent.Although Mr. Chayefsky has written a very contemporary melodramatic farce, his political sympathies have their roots in the liberalism of 20 years ago. This is apparent in Mr. Scott's character, a once brilliant, now exhausted and suicidal doctor who is brought back to life and commitment by an improbable, immensely romantic one-night stand with Miss Rigg, a dropout from Boston's Beacon Hill who now lives in the mountains of Mexico where her father preaches ""the apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians."" Mr. Chayefsky has been responsible for some lovely lines in his life, but nothing quite to equal the monologue by which this marvelous actress seduces her co-star, by word and well-exposed leg.""The Hospital"" opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater.",1971-12-15T05:00:00+0000

us,' Garden of the Finzi Continis',"The garden of the Finzi Continis, owned by a rich, intellectual Jewish-Italian family, is a sylvan sanctuary in the ducal town of Ferrara in 1938. Outside its walls, the good gentile citizens of Ferrara parade Fascist banners and slogans and prepare for war, but these things are barely acknowledged by the Finzi Continis, who have their gardens and woods, a huge main house, a smaller but still imposing summer lodge, and a private tennis court.When the tennis club, observing Mussolini's new anti-Semitic laws, drops the Finzi Continis from its rolls, Micol Finzi Contini (Dominique Sanda) and her brother, Alberto (Helmut Berger), make a tentative gesture towards ending their aristocratic isolation. They invite friendsgentiles as well as Jewishinto their sanctuary to play tennis on long, lovely, hot summer afternoons. Micol is paid romantic court by Giorgio (Lino Capolicchio), the narrator of the film, a nice young Jewish boy, but she has midnight assignations with Malnate, a gentile whom she can never marry.There are no commitments in such liaisons, and although Micol and Alberto are fond of their friends, they are different from them, even from their Jewish friends. They are aware of something that is apparent to no one else. They are dying but will do nothing about it.""The Garden of the Finzi Continis,"" adapted from Giorgio Bassani's highly regarded novol (which I have not read), is certainly the best film that Vittorio De Sica has made in years, but the shabby habits he acquired when directing such things as ""Sunflower"" and ""A Place for Lovers"" keep intruding upon this new, much more ambitious work to render it less affecting than it has every right to be.Mr. De Sica's way with end-of-an-era romance is to shoot almost everything in soft focus, as if he didn't trust the validity of the emotions in what seems to be a perfectly decent screenplay. The film's mood of impending doom is not discovered by the viewer, but imposed on him, by a syrupy musical score and by a camera that keeps panning to and from the sky, and shots of the sun, seen through the same sort of treetops that hover over the actors in the world of Newport cigarettes.This is particularly frustrating because it has the effect of constantly reducing and denying the complexities of the characters and the performances. One suspects that Miss Sanda's Micol is a very special personwise, sensuous and possessed with some kind of awful foresightyet, in the context of popular movie fiction, she seems simply willful and cruel. Whan the movie means to hint, as it does that Micol and Alberto are something more than just fond siblings, it does so with such bluntness that any ambiguity seems merely arbitrary story-telling.All of the other major performances are similarly reduced in dimensionHelmut Berger's tubercular Alberto, who is literally dying; Fabio Testi's Malnate, a gentile as doomed as the Finzi Continis, and Lino Capolicchio's Giorgio, through whose eyes we watch the downfall of the Finzi Continis, aristocrats fatally anesthetized against the realities of the world around them.""The Garden of the Finzi Continis,"" which opened yesterday at the Plaza Theater, is a very melanoholy movie, but its sentiments are essentially those contained on Micol's 78 r.p.m. recording of Tommy Dorsey's ""Getting Sentimental Over You.""

us,Film: 'The Boy Friend':Twiggy Plays Polly in Russell Screenplay,"The problem of how to adapt a stage musical to the screen is commonly settled by default. More money, more cast, more orchestra, and locationsand suddenly you should have cinema where before you had theater. In point of fact you usually have nothing, not even an original cast album.Ken Russell doesn't settle things by default, and he understands, perhaps too well, that film is also theater. It follows that his version of Sandy Wilson's 1950's musical about the 1920's, ""The Boy Friend,"" is not so much an adaptation as almost total transformation  honorable transformation, for the most part.The movie concerns a down-at-the-heels British troupe who are doing a musical called ""The Boy Friend"" somewhere in the provinces, too far from London. One fateful day the leading lady catches her high heel in a trolley track and Polly, the mousey little assistant stage manager, must go on in her place. ""You're going out there a youngster; you've got to come back a star,"" cautions her boss.But Polly is not only shy, and mostly ignorant of her part; she is also desperately, transparently in love with Tony, the leading man. And on her day of torment, who should show up in the stage box but the great talkingpicture director, De Thrill. Of course nobody will play the play; everyone plays for De Thrillexcept Tony, who is too nice, and Polly, who is too simple.I do not wish to spoil anyone's pleasure by giving away the secrets of the plot (whom Tony loves; who finally gets the Hollywood offer; etc.), but you can imagine the pleasure Mr. Russell must have had in filming a musical that takes place onstage, backstage, in Polly's romantic imagination, in the film fantasies of De Thrill, in the eye of the beholder, and of course in the mind of the maker, Mr. Russell  whose meditation on the history of the movie musical from ""42nd Street"" to ""The Bandwagon"" (at least) this movie so very largely is.Therefore, ""The Boy Friend"" contains enough for 20 ordinary movie musicals. There are production numbers within production numbers and styles within stylesbeginning with the stage properties of the poor provincial troupe (which look elaborate enough to bankrupt all of Broadway) and proceeding to the kind of calculated excess in which, for example, one giant phonograph turntable spinning a geometric arrangement of chorus girls suddenly splits, amoeba-like, into two giant turntablesas if the first commandment of cinema were: ""Be fruitful all, and multiply.""You will say, ""Busby Berkeley."" But with Mr. Russell, what goes in as Busby Berkeley comes out feeling Venusberg in a road company ""Tannhuser""an arrangement that may not be to everyone's taste. I am surprised to find that it is rather greatly to my taste; partly because it is often as witty as it is elaborate, partly because it works its variations on the fully recognizable and still quite wonderful Sandy Wilson words and music, and partly because it is supported by a charming and energetic cast.As the central question in that cast Twiggy succeeds beyond all expectation. She dances well, sings well enough, acts with a natural grace, and offers a face that perfectly resists the sometimes exploitative exaggerations of Mr. Russell's camera.",1971-12-17T05:00:00+0000

us,A Benign Bond:007 Stars in 'Diamonds Are Forever',"""Diamonds Are Forever,"" the eighth James Bond movie, the seventh to be produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and the sixth to star Sean Connery, is a nostalgic journey down memory laneby jet, by helicopter, by hearse, by moon machine, and by bare foot across deep-pile rugs to king-sized beds in hotel rooms as big as Nevada.A lot of things have changed since ""You Only Live Twice"" (1967), the last real Bond adventure, but 007 has remained a steadfast agent for the military-industrial complex, a friend to the C.I.A. and a triumphant sexist. It's enough to make one weepy with gratitude. I mean, not everything must be mutable.""Diamonds Are Forever"" is also great, absurd fun, not only because it recalls the moods and manners of the sixties (which, being over, now seem safely comprehensible), but also because all of the people connected with the movie obviously know what they are up to.This includes Mr. Connery, who must reconcile himself to the fact that nothing becomes him as much as the character he wanted to leave; Guy Hamilton, the director, whose ""Goldfinger"" was the best of the earlier Bonds; Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz, who know exactly when a screenplay should make sense and when it's a waste of time, and Maurice Bender, the designer of the main titles that so brilliantly reflect the make-belive violence, vulgarity and humor of the film that follows.The story, which may or may not have much to do with Ian Fleming's novel published here in 1956, begins as a conventional diamond smuggling caper but quickly evolves into another one of the positively immortal Blofeld's schemes to dominate the world, this time by something that I can only describe as a death-ray-carrying, diamond-encrusted sputnik.The locales shift from London to South Africa to Amsterdam, before more or less settling down in Las Vegas, which, with its disposable facades, its arbitrary payoffs, its magnificent assortment of available women, and its implication that this is civilization's end, is the perfect setting for the kind of doomsdays that always threaten Bond's world.In addition to several Blofelds (all played by Charles Gray), the characters include a nice little old lady named Mrs. Whistler, who teaches school to South Africans when she is not smuggling diamonds to Europe; two gentle gunmen, who are fond of their jobs (and in love with each other); a mysterious Las Vegas millionaire named Willard Whyte (played by Jimmy Dean); a couple of butch beauties named Thumper and Bambi, and Lana Wood and Jill St. John, as the two principal women in James's life.The movie's momentum is such that one never has much time to react to its lack of reason, only to its sensations of speed and narrow escape, and to the splendor of its crazy gadgets and dcor. It may be that I've become jaded, or that I've forgotten the details of all but the last (and worst) Bond film (""On His Majesty's Secret Service,"" which featured a vivid sequence in which a man got chopped up by the blades of a snow-removal machine), but ""Diamonds Are Forever"" does seem comparatively benign. I'd almost call it a movie to play hookey for.It opened yesterday at the DeMille and other theaters around town.",1971-12-18T05:00:00+0000

In the 19th century, George Meredith had no more on which to justify admitting only Menander and Moliere to the empyrean of comic writers. Of course, there were the Roman adaptations of Plautus and Terence, but this was hardly the same as having a real play or even a complete scene by Menander himself.

us,The mental set of an elderly absolute monarch,"This is not a traditional biography that tells a political narrative from the cradle to the grave, for it jumps about with studied disrespect for chronology. Nor is it a modern study in psychohistory on Eriksonian lines, for it says nothing whatever about the subject's childhood or adolescence and nothing much about his subse quent sexlife. It is rather a neo romantic essay on personality con veyed in a series of dazzling vignettes of the King in his later years, a probe into the mental set and the motiva tional drives of an elderly absolute monarch in the early 16thcentury. Very stylish, very mannered, some what idiosyncratic, it is controlled and illuminated by a wide knowledge of the primary sources, and driven forward by a vivid historical imagination. It makes a good deal more sense than some of, the interpre tations of Henry's character and policies that have been put forward recently by more sobersided histor ians.",1971-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,' A Clockwork Orange' Dazzles the Senses and Mind,"On the soundtrack we hear Henry Purcell's almost comically elegant ""Music Composed for Queen Mary's Funeral."" On the screen we see a closeup portrait of Alex (Malcolm McDowell), who, for a moment, is uncharacteristically still. The face looks floodlit, as if caught by one of those automatic photo machines in a bus station.However, the eyes, one of which is ringed by false lashes, reveal an intelligence that is no less alive for being occupied, momentarily, with the kind of drug fantasies that Alex and his droogs are able to buy at the Kerova Milkbar, before going out into the London night in search of the old ultra-violence. There's always the chance they'll find a dirty old man to beat up, or some frightened devotchka for a malenky bit of in-out, in-out.Thus begins ""A Clockwork Orange,"" Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess's perversely moral, essentially Christian novel about the value of free will, even if the choice exercised is to tear through the night robbing, raping and battering the citizens until they lie helpless, covered with what Alex describes happily as ""the real red vino,"" or krovvy.In both English and Nadsat, the combination of Anglicized Russian, Gypsy, rhyming slang and associative words spoken by Alex and his teenage friends in what seems to be 1983, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a great deal more than merely horror showthat is, Nadsat for good. It is brilliant, a tour de force of extraordinary images, music, words and feelings, a much more original achievement for commercial films than the Burgess novel is for literature, for Burgess, after all, has some impossibly imposing literary antecedents, including the work of Joyce.The film, which opened yesterday at the Cinema I, is cast in the form of futurist fiction, but it is no spinoff from Mr. Kubrick's ""2001,"" nor is it truly futurist, if that means it is one of those things-to-come fantasies. More correctly it contemplates the nightmares of today, often in terms that reflect the 1950's and 1960's, out of which the Burgess novel grew. It is also  at least it seems to me  an essentially British nightmare (while ""2001"" was essentially American) in its attentions to caste, manners, accents and the state of mind created by a kind of weary socialism.The movie shows a lot of aimless violencethe exercise of aimless choicebut it is as formally structured as the music of Alex's ""lovely lovely Ludwig Van,"" which inspires in Alex sado-masochistic dreams of hangings, volcanic eruptions and other disasters.Alex is a terrifying character, but also an intelligent, funny and pathetic one, whose spiritual crucifixion comes when, having been jailed for murder, he is subjected to the Ludovico Treatment. Alex is one of the early guinea pigs in a rehabilitation program that involves the conditioning of his responses, via the nonstop viewing of sex, horror and atrocity movies. At the end of two weeks, he is left as dumb and defenseless as a defanged, declawed animal.Impulses to hate, anger, lust make him physically ill. He has become a model of good, ""as decent a lad as you would meet on a May morning,"" but, as his fundamentalist prison chaplain points out, he is without a soul.Under these circumstances, Alex's eventual return to his original ""free"" state becomes an ironic redemption, yet not much attention is paid to the fact that Alex the hood is as much a product of conditioning as was the denatured Alex, the product of aversion therapy.However, I won't quibble over the point. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is so beautiful to look at and to hear that it dazzles the senses and the mind, even as it turns the old real red vino to ice: Alex and his friends having a rumble with a rival gang to the tune of Rossini's ""The Thieving Magpie,"" or preparing a gang rape in the home of a definitely upper-class writer as Alex does a lyric soft-shoe (into the stomach and face of the writer), singing ""Singin' in the Rain."" That's the sort of thing that makes Alex feel all nice and warm in his guttywuts.McDowell is splendid as tomorrow's child, but it is always Mr. Kubrick's picture, which is even technically more interesting than ""2001."" Among other devices, Mr. Kubrick constantly uses what I assume to be a wide-angle lens to distort space relationships within scenes, so that the disconnection between lives, and between people and environment, becomes an actual, literal fact.At one point in his therapy, Alex says: ""The colors of the real world only become real when you viddy them in a film."" ""A Clockwork Orange"" makes real and important the kind of fears simply exploited by other, much lesser films.",1971-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Harold and Maude' and Life:Hal Ashby's Comedy Opens at Coronet Ruth Gordon, Bud Cort Star as Odd Couple","Harold is 20, very rich and very suicidal. Maude is 79, very poor and so full of a sympathetic life-force that she grieves for a small tree, suffocating in the city's pollution. Harold and Maude meet at one of the anonymous funerals they like to attend, fall in love while transplanting the tree, and marry on the eve of Maude's birthday.Even if this idea strikes you as immensely comic, you might well want to miss Hal Ashby's ""Harold and Maude,"" a comedy that pretends to be as thoroughly in favor of life as ""You Can't Take It With You,"" whereas it's quite as much about death as it appears to be.Like Harold, the movie is fascinated by the mechanics of simulated suicide  by hanging, by slashed wrists and throat, by a shot in the head, by drowning, by harakiri and, most hilariously, by immolation. Harold enacts them all, not really to kill himself (gulp, guffaw), but to get a rise out of his mother. When Mrs. Chasen comes from Harold dangling by the neck from a chandelier, her first reaction is to say something on the order of ""Now, Harold, I suppose you think that's funny.""Because Vivian Pickles is an actress who is particularly gifted at exaggerating understatements, many of Mrs. Chasen's reactions to Harold's bleak pranks are as funny as they are meant to be. There are, indeed, some other funny things in ""Harold and Maude"" (an airy confrontation between Maude and the cop who stops her for speeding in a stolen truck), but they are all terribly incidental to the movie's main concern, which is apparently that there is a time to live and a time to die (when you reach 80.)As Harold and Maude, Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are supposed to appear magnificently mismatched for the purposes of the comedy. They are mismatched, at least visually. Mr. Cort's baby face and teen-age build look grotesque alongside Miss Gordon's tiny, weazened frame.Yet, as performers, they both are so aggressive, so creepy and off-putting, that Harold and Maude are obviously made for each other, a point the movie itself refuses to recognize with a twist ending that betrays, I think, its life-affirming pretensions. These reach an embarrassed low when Miss Gordon sits down at the piano, in the railroad car where she makes her home, and sings a rousing chorus of a song that starts: ""Gimme an 'l'/Gimme an 'i'/a 'v' and an 'e'/l-i-v-e/Live!"" It's even worse than the scene in which Harold sets fire to himself by the swimming pool.The movie opened yesterday at the Coronet.",1971-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Star Spangled Girl' on the Screen,"It's been precisely five years since Neil Simon's ""Star Spangled Girl"" first was staged on Broadway like a decorative, sparkling, largely gag-filled Christmas stocking. But time and Hollywood have not done wonders for his exuberant but still essentially lightweight comedy. The movie version that turned up yesterday at the Ziegfeld and other houses around town, is, like the joke about a chop suey dinner, something that's only momentarily satisfying.Soon after the opening, when one of our impecunious heroes is slickly filching food from a supermarket, a viewer begins to hunger for fare more solid than the constant, if cheerful, repartee and frenetic, sometimes aimless, movement of its supercharged principals. Under the lacklustre direction of Jerry Paris, the frothy, comic idea of a pair of bright young liberal operators of an underground weekly involved, romantically and otherwise, with the square, cute, patriotic ""Star Spangled Girl,"" becomes a pedestrian affair despite all the running and shouting.The scene has been changed from San Francisco to Los Angeles, which really doesn't make things sunnier. The uninspired adaptation of Simon's antic is a basically contrived affair that may get a share of chuckles but not many hearty laughs. Mr. Simon's slight but effervescent jape has been reconstituted in the manner of a standard television situation comedy dependent on often banal sight gags that rarely are as funny as some of the film's rapidly delivered lines.Sandy Duncan, the pert heroine of commercials (""Noxema,"" etc.) and TV's ""Funny Face,"" is not especially comic as the Olympic swimming aspirant from Cypress Gardens, Fla., who, quite innocently, disrupts the lives of her bill collector-harried neighbors, Tony Roberts and Todd Susman, shoestring publisher and writer of ""Nitty Gritty."" Miss Duncan looks great in hot pants but her artificial, corn pone accent and bland expression hardly make her the convincing beauty who would churn the emotions of her opposite numbers.The curly-haired Tony Roberts is glib, flip and superficially precise as the driven publisher.And Mr. Susman, a frustrated dynamo, generates little but buzzing action. As a minimally effective gag, Elizabeth Allen plays their man-adoring landlady as a sporting type who drags a suffering Mr. Roberts along on her motorbike, surfboard and plane without speaking a word.The words constantly emanating from ""Star Spangled Girl"" often are funny but what this embroiled trio projects is rarely merry even during a holiday season.",1971-12-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Film by Cassavetes Takes Friendly Jabs,"""Minnie and Moskowitz,"" John Cassavetes's sixth and, in many ways, most ambitious film, is also his friendliest, in the dish-throwing, door-pounding, exclamation-pointed manner of a comic strip. Every frame depicts a bodily assault or an exchange of angry words, representing love.Because it means to be so friendly, and because Mr. Cassavetes has exercised imagination and discipline that lift the film out of the neo-realist rut of ""Husbands"" and ""Faces,"" I wish I liked ""Minnie and Moskowitz"" more than I do. It's as open and vulnerable as someone who tells an elaborate ethnic joke, in an accent that isn't very authentic, with a point that isn't very funny.The fact is that although I admired specific things about the film, I never laughed very much and only felt slight, distant tremors of the joy that, I assume, rocked everyone connected with the movie during its production.""Minnie and Moskowitz"" is a contemporary fairy tale about a youngish, eccentric, parking lot attendant (Seymour Cassel), who is essentially a middle-class Jewish prince in hippie disguise, and the very beautiful, mixed-up, middle-class gentile princess (Gena Rowlands), whose hand he wins in what is certain to be an idyllic, Maggie-and-Jiggs sort of marriage.They meet in a parking lot when Moskowitz steps in (and is immediately flattened) as he attempts to stop Minnie's blind date from beating her up. Thereafter, Mr. Moskowitz, when he isn't pushing Minnie around to prove how much he loves her, gets pushed around by people trying to protect Minnie. They scream at each other, share sudden moments of tenderness, and spend what seems to be an extraordinary amount of time ordering and eating in roadside lunch stands.Mr. Cassavetes's use of exaggerated slapstick gestures to underscore the loneliness and fears of his characters is more interesting in theory than funny or moving in actual fact. This may well have to do with the heavy literalness with which the supposedly comic brawls are photographed (people do get hurt that way), and with the apparent disparity between the characters and their environments.Minnie, for just one example, works at the Los Angeles County Museum and lives in a posh, book-lined duplex, yet she seems to have the mental equipment of Edgar Kennedy's bird-brained wife in those old two-reelers. It doesn't quite fit.To the extent that the material allows them to be, Mr. Cassel and Miss Rowlands are most appealing. However, all of the performances are quite special and this, I think, is Mr. Cassavetes's strongest point.As an actor, he appreciates actors and their mysterious art, as well as their awful dependency on the work of others. This explains why he casts his films so abundantly, using very fine actors in what are practically throw-away roles, or would be throwaway roles in the film of a less fond director.""Minnie and Moskowitz"" is loaded with small, sometimes lovely, sometimes odd-ball bits, by people like Tim Carey (as a nut in an all-night restaurant), Val Avery (as Minnie's aggressive blind-date), and even by members of the Cassavetes-Rowlands families. Two of the best performances of the film are given by the director's mother, Katherine Cassavetes, as Moskowitz's indulgent Jewish mum, and Mrs. Cassavetes's mother, Lady Rowlands, as Minnie's very starchy, WASPy parent.""Minnie and Moskowitz,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema II, does reverse one usual movie procedure in that it improves as it goes along, instead of falling apart. Like Minnie and Moskowitz themseves, the movie attempts to fight its way out of the lower depths, but it's not as lucky as its prince and princess.",1971-12-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Kidnapped':Douglas Cast as David of Stevenson's Work,"People who deplore the dreadfulness of new movies can take comfort in Delbert Mann's ""Kidnapped,"" which opened Wednesday at the RKO Twin 2 and Penthouse Theaters, and which is dreadful in a manner almost wholly reminiscent of the ways they made movies before, say, 1936. ""Kidnapped"" is loosely based on the Robert Louis Stevenson novel and on a sequel, ""Catriona,"" which includes further adventures of the 18th-century Scottish patriot Alan Breck and the coming to manhood and eventual marriage of Stevenson's young narrator, David Balfour.Far from trying to hype up the material of Stevenson's novels, the movie version of ""Kidnapped"" mostly depresses it. There is almost as much plot, but there are many fewer people and much less actionto the degree that you sometimes don't know what is happening because of the sheer immobility of what ought to be the moving pictures on the screen.Everything bespeaks low budget, in the sense that many of the shots making up individual sequences don't fit together and that some of the costumes don't fit at all. Except for the locations, which are real, and the color, which is color, the whole thing suggests the dim listlessness of the late late show edging toward the catatonia of 3 A.M.Lawrence Douglas is David, and Vivien Heilbron is his beloved Catriona, and under different auspices maybe they both can act. Several Stalwarts of the British stage and screen offer embarrassed cameos in ""Kidnapped,"" including Trevor Howard, Jack Hawkins and a loony faced Donald Pleasance. But real admiration goes to Michael Caine, who plays the swashbuckling Alan Breck with a refinement of indifference so sublime that it is often difficult to tell whether he has been rapt into stillness by his role or has merely mastered the art of sleeping with his eyes open.",1971-12-24T05:00:00+0000

Discerning parents can relax, finally. A good onein some ways a real beautyhas turned up at the Whitney Museum in the current series by new American filmmakers. Titled ""Hildur and the Magician,"" the 90-minute feature will be shown through Jan. 2.A group of California people, headed by Larry Jordan, the director-writer-photographer-editor, have emerged from a forest with a sensitive, lovely work that must have cost a dime. Exquisitely photographed (in good old black-and-white), threaded by a tactful narration and soothing music, the film gracefully pantomimes the tale of a kidnapped little princess, a wandering fairy queen and a bumbling magician.As an excursion into never-never land, the picture is never stiff, starchy or self-conscious. Nor are the players. Mr. Jordan has directed his cast, reportedly family and friends, well. Even the costumes show imagination and skill.Above all, the picture moves simply, clearly and interestingly, projecting an ethereal spirit. The catch is the lengthabout 30 minutes too much. But at the movie's best its texture and tone suggest Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"" and this is high praise indeed.

That way of life is far too closely bound, up with the idea of humanity and of all human culture for it ever to be alien, ever to be dis pensable, in any humane world.
