Every possible alternative milk  pressed from beans, grains, nuts and so forth  now beckon as vanilla and chocolate in the frozen food aisle. A newcomer, Wildgood, has taken a somewhat different approach, with a vegan frozen dessert that relies on olive oil. Its the result of eight years of trial and error by Sotiris Tsichlopoulos, who studied gelato in Italy and created an ice cream brand in Greece. Among the ingredients that help turn extra-virgin olive oil into a frozen confection are chicory root, pea protein and carob-bean gum. Its around 10 percent fat, and there are eight flavors: chocolate, vanilla bean, coffee, mango, mint-chocolate chip, sea salt caramel and the best of the lot, pistachio and chocolate-hazelnut. Perhaps using nuts helps with the texture because despite the olive oil, the end result has more of an ice milk lightness instead of the dense richness of a super-premium product.

The climate and soils of northern Sonoma County are ideal for producing world-class Bordeaux varietals, particularly sauvignon blanc, said Craig McAllister, the head winemaker. Bordeaux is the operative term here. The wine, in a clear Bordeaux-style bottle, displays more subtle fruit, notably citrus and pineapple, integrated with good acidity, than the grassy herbaceousness typical of sauvignon blancs from other regions.

A slim, gliding figure, with a mouth reddened from paan, or betel leaf and areca nut, the attarwallah produced his wares from carved bottles of colored glass that he carried in a black leather doctors bag. He showed us scents according to which season we were in.

In the monsoon, he brought us mitti attar, which imitates the smell of parched earth exhaling after the first rain (mitti means mud in Hindi). The perfumes came from the medieval Indian town of Kannauj, which is a 75-mile drive west of Lucknow and which, like its French counterpart, Grasse, has a tradition of perfume manufacturing several centuries old. Once he had drawn his perfume out on white cotton buds at the tips of long, thin sticks, the attarwallah lingered over his customers, telling stories of the various scents and reciting the odd romantic couplet of Urdu poetry.",2021-05-10T09:00:35+0000

Short as trees go, it has a hunkered-down look, its branches starting low to the ground and crooking and knotting as they rise. The most prized species make their home in the gullies and wadis of Dhofar in southern Oman and Hadhramaut in war-torn eastern Yemen, and along the cliffs and scarps of the Cal Madow mountains in Somaliland, whose 1991 declaration of independence from Somalia has gone unrecognized by the rest of the world. The Indigenous people of these regions brave snakes and scorpions to climb the trees and press a knife to the papery bark, just enough to break through the green skin beneath. Wounded, the tree begins to ooze, trying to heal itself, its viscous tears hardening into a resin that has been sought after and suffered over for nearly 5,000 years.",2021-05-10T09:03:04+0000

The ability to say Im beautiful  and to really, truly believe it  may not be a fundamental right, but it, too, is revolutionary in its way, reflective of contemporary upheavals in how we perceive race, gender, sexuality, ability and size.

us,The Joy of Black Hair,"IN FEBRUARY 1994, Ellin LaVar, then a 32-year-old Manhattan hairstylist, went to a clients house in Mendham, N.J., for a home appointment. In the kitchen, she prepared the womans hair for a wash by removing the extensions that she had previously put in, using her shears to snip the tiny stitches that fastened the wefts  individual strands of hair that are sewn together to create extensions  to her clients cornrows. Once she had taken those out, LaVar began to unravel the minuscule braids she had plaited months before, starting at the nape. Using her fingers, she carefully unwound them section by section, until all that was left was the womans natural hair. After her client took a shower in one of her four bathrooms, LaVar blow-dried her hair and, over the next hour, once again braided each section of the soft hair into thin cornrows. The womans hair was naturally fine and, because she often attended events, she was accustomed to this laborious, time-consuming process.",2021-05-10T09:03:20+0000

In Egypts Karnak village, beginning in the 16th century B.C., temples served as early shops and produced scented oils used for perfuming the living, embalming the dead, softening the skin and hair, covering up bad breath and easing sore muscles. In 17th-century Europe, apothecaries sold raw materials  plant oils, mineral powders  that enabled patrons to whip up their own potions to disguise concerns such as gray hair and wrinkles. And as the definition of beauty has evolved, so, too, has the function of the beauty shop. Today, when we tend to think of beauty in more holistic terms, the places that sell creams, powders and pigments are often more than merely points for picking up curative goods: They can be sanctuaries for gathering, broadening the mind, stimulating the senses and perhaps even stirring the soul. In a year when its been difficult to physically visit shops, their value has never been more apparent.

Joe Klein on Why It Still Matters.,"The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York said during a lecture at Harvard in 1986. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself. Moynihan, an apostle of complexity, lived at the intersection of those two truths, a place where he was free to become one of the most creative American thinkers of the late 20th century. He sensed, and then came to know, that the social problems of what was being called postindustrial society would be different from those that came before. He identified these problems, sometimes controversially. In so doing, he predicted the dislocations of the 21st century with uncanny accuracy. He did it with elegance and wit and  this may be a surprise  transcendent humility. His spot-on sense of what truly mattered deserves to be revisited now, if were to grope our way past the mess weve become as a society.",2021-05-15T09:00:04+0000

Americans have also had difficulty accessing dental care: A report last month by the CareQuest Institute for Oral Health, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, found that six million adults had lost their dental insurance because of the pandemic, and more than one in 10 had delayed getting care because of cost, lack of insurance, fear of exposure to the virus or a combination of those factors.",2021-05-19T09:00:06+0000

He details the history of barbecue back to its Indigenous roots in pre-Columbian days, and recounts how it became part of the culture of enslaved Africans. It was entrenched in Black community life, but was taken over by white cooks starting in the late 19th century, he writes. Part of this change was because of urbanization. Instead of pit-roasted whole hogs, smaller cuts of meat like ribs and brisket were used because they were easier to handle in restaurants, and chefs got involved. Now the recognition is improving, he says, but there is work to be done. The book is seasoned with profiles of Black barbecue notables and a smattering of recipes.",2021-05-24T21:07:00+0000

The executive chef will be Hillary Sterling, 42, the executive chef at Vics in NoHo for the past seven years where she became known for her take on Italian food. She was at A Voce Madison before that. Mr. Meyer named the new restaurant after an expression that can mean Here we are! or Weve arrived! in Italian, and, following suit, the menu will also be Italian with touches of France. Ms. Sterling said she would strive for simplicity, something that has increasingly informed her cooking. Pastas, like pappardelle with rabbit, will be essential, she said, but there will be no pizzas. Her wood-fired grill, a kitchen centerpiece, will sear vegetables, seafood and meats, like a crispy chicken with potatoes. The restaurant, on the second floor of a building at the center of the development, will seat 120, including outdoor tables on a terrace. A bar and lounge, where Ms. Sterling plans to serve aperitivo snacks, will have another 40 seats. Event space will take up part of the third floor. ",2021-05-25T17:35:06+0000
