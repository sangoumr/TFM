Andrea Fraser stood before a small TV watching Official Welcome, one of her landmark performances. Onscreen, she appeared in a tasteful black dress at the opening of her 2003 exhibition in Hamburg, Germany, making remarks from a lectern. She thanked the curators who had made her retrospective possible; she thanked her mother, who had flown all the way from California for the event. The crowd clapped on cue. But then the woman went rogue, as though a computer virus had infected her gracious-artist software. Thank you, Andrea, she boomed in a deep male voice, morphing into the first of more than a dozen art-world personae who take over the speech  a piratical dealer, a fawning patron, an artist best known for pickling a shark. Before its over, she has shed her dress and then her Gucci bra, thong and stilettos to address the audience fully nude. It takes a lot of courage to do what she does, she said, assuming the voice of an approving critic. She goes far beyond where most artists have the intelligence or audacity to operate.

us,A Furniture Designer Who Learned Under Raf Simons,"As a student at Belgiums LUCA School of Arts in the late 90s, Michal Verheyden counted the fashion designer Raf Simons as a mentor  he even modeled for Simons before launching his own line of handbags. Yet he graduated with a degree in industrial design, which he put to use when he and his wife, the designer Saartje Vereecke, bought their first home, in Genk, in 2009. After failing to find the sort of furniture theyd envisioned for the space, they started making their own pieces, and have been experimenting with clean-lined forms ever since. Verheydens latest collection, Archetypes, a 20-piece range that the Belgian gallerist Pierre Marie Giraud is showing at Design Miami, includes brass lamps, marble tables and a classic oak screen. It was inspired by the work of Donald Judd and Jean-Michel Frank, and, like them, Verheyden is interested in simple structures, but also in rich textures. If I design a chair, I want people to recognize its basic shape  but then I like to play with the materials, he says. Indeed, the collections benchlike sofa is strung with Manila cord and sits atop gouged oak legs evoking snakeskin, while a decorative brass bowl is polished smooth in parts but left rough and unfinished at its base. With his Tabula Runda writing desk, though, Verheyden plays with form as well: It contains two hidden drawers and legs that have been moved from the edges to the center, challenging our notions of just what an ideal table might be. As Verheyden says, The answer is always to look at something long enough to see how I might change it.",2019-12-03T16:00:07+0000

More than being interesting, its so interested, in the vicissitudes of victimhood and survival, in quiet and restraint. Its hard to explain how that interest reveals itself, except to say that the people playing cops, accusers and parents create this nexus of frustration, outrage, patience, doubt, empathy, determination and shame. One beautifully written and acted exchange follows another. Danielle Macdonald, Vanessa Bell Calloway, Dale Dickey, Elizabeth Marvel, Annaleigh Ashford, Bridget Everett, Eric Lange: The show lets them all do painterly work, shading even minor characters. Kaitlyn Dever, playing a spiky foster kid whom law enforcement chews up and spits out, is especially good at navigating post-traumatic stress with no GPS. And as a pair of detectives, Toni Collette is self-amusedly made of Kevlar and Merritt Wever is the closest acting gets to emotional stethoscope.",2019-12-05T10:00:19+0000

The countrys isolated southern island state has been so overlooked in the past, its even been left off maps of Australia. In recent years, however, Australians have changed their tune. Tasmania is experiencing a surge of weekenders and property buyers, driven by a newfound interest in its pristine nature, unhurried way of life and an increasingly diverse food and art scene that really started to take off with the arrival, in a Hobart suburb, of the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in 2011. The biggest transformation has taken place in the once-sleepy capital of Hobart, which now boasts a plethora of creative new restaurants and an edgy spirit, particularly during the winter Dark Mofo festival. (A highlight: the nude solstice swim in the chilly River Derwent.) Tasmanias profile is rising overseas, as well.

Created in 1795 by the Paris-based watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet, a favorite of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the mechanism (French for whirlwind) is perhaps the most esoteric and elegant watch complication ever conceived. Born of horologys obsession with maintaining accuracy to the millisecond, the tourbillon counteracts the effect of the earths gravity by constantly rotating the cage that holds the timepieces balance wheel, balance spring and escapement while the movement is running. The idea was to eliminate errors in rate  the loss or gain in time that would arise if the watch stayed too long in one position  by crafting an internal apparatus that continually turned on an axis. Such a marvel of intricacy must be witnessed to be fully understood: It is as transfixing as watching a heart beat. In this new incarnation by the Swiss company Vacheron Constantin, which has specialized in rarefied timepieces since its founding in 1755, you can stare at it all you want through the round porthole at the bottom of the blue lacquer dial or through its sapphire crystal back. Because the case is fashioned from stainless steel instead of the platinum or gold used for most tourbillon watches, this exemplar of late 18th-century ingenuity seems decidedly contemporary  and, perhaps, ever so slightly less beyond our grasp.

It also sells high-fidelity transcriptions of dishes from the chefs Ferran Adri, whose liquid olives are still blowing minds, and his brother, Albert, who fed recipes to the outstanding pastry department. Somehow, though, the most impressive foods are the most elementary: the gazpacho that shimmers with olive oil and sherry vinegar; the thick, dark hot chocolate that comes with churros just out of the fryer; the goblets of gin and tonics.

us,The Curious Case of the U.S. Governments Influence on 20th-Century Design,"THE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES was the first centralized foreign intelligence agency in the United States, the direct precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. Founded during World War II by order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the O.S.S. (or the Coordinator of Information, as it was originally called) was established to collect, analyze, and correlate information and data bearing on national security, to make such data available to the President and such other officials as determined by the President, and to perform related supplementary activities. And yet its role soon became much larger and more influential. The head of the O.S.S., Colonel William Wild Bill Donovan, quickly realized that the information produced by the global war, fought on multiple fronts and territories, needed to be painstakingly abstracted, graphically depicted and efficiently presented. The O.S.S. mission expanded to include not only information gathering through research and counterintelligence but also packaging and interpreting that information for the president and other key decision makers. Propaganda played a crucial role during World War II, with the O.S.S. leading efforts to demoralize the enemy and encourage resistance in Axis-controlled countries. They created a stamp bearing the face of Hitler rendered as a skull, produced radio broadcasts in German, spread pamphlets announcing a German generals resignation and made films for new military recruits, such as the Hollywood producer Darryl F.

This one tells the tale of a Volkswagen Beetle. Or, more precisely, it tells an origin story of a robot hero who can morph into a yellow car. That robot would be Bumblebee, once the metal partner of Shia LaBeoufs character in the various Michael Bay Transformers movies. Bumblebee is here reimagined as the sidekick of a 1980s Northern California teenager played by Hailee Steinfeld. Together, the pair defends the earth from evil robots. This movie was directed by Travis Knight, a filmmaker who built his career on stop-motion animation. He cut back on some of the profuse chaos that defined the earlier Transformers films, working off a screenplay by Christina Hodson. The result, Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times, is cleverly plotted, neatly allusive and has dialogue you can envision real people and, um, real Transformers speaking. Its springy yet coherent, he added, not, like previous films in the series, a digital-image blender set on high.",2019-12-13T06:00:07+0000

Before Bob Clark made A Christmas Story, the gift of holiday programming that keeps on giving, he directed this slasher film that has a decidedly deadlier take on the holiday. It follows a group of sorority sisters who start to receive disturbing phone calls at their house as they prepare to head home for the Christmas break. The caller then starts to stalk each of the girls, picking them off one by one in a bloody killing spree. Although A.H. Weiler dismissed the film as a whodunit that begs the question of why it was made in his New York Times review, the movie went on to become a horror classic. The film became influential in the genre for its use of first-person camera shots and its decision not to unmask the killer, serving as a flash point for other slasher movies like John Carpenters Halloween. It has also inspired a few remakes, including a version out in theaters now.",2019-12-14T06:00:06+0000

Altieri specializes in Rolexes, which almost always run on automatic movement, where the motion of a wearers wrist winds an intricate system of tiny gears and springs, resulting in a smoother, sweeping second hand. Altieri can make out a cheap quartz fake from five feet away, but recently he has seen more almost-perfect impostors, what he calls superfakes. To catch these, you need a 10x magnifying glass and lots of time. It really helps if you have a real one right next to it to compare, he says.

As a rock music fan, she strove to channel the D.I.Y. ethos laid out in the self-taught musician Viv Albertines 2014 feminist punk memoir Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys. The resulting pieces  a collection of youthful, boldly hued knits made from merino and lambs wool and adorned with the knitted names of beloved bands such as Devo and Joy Division  quickly found a following on Instagram. Last year, Holland won the British Fashion Councils Fashion Potential Award, and while the brands international profile is growing, she is committed to working with British and family-run businesses, both in the Pennine mountains of Yorkshire, where her yarn is milled, and in Hawick, Scotland, where her sweaters are crafted by hand. For recent collections, she has drawn inspiration from sources including Virginia Woolfs 1925 novel Mrs. Dalloway (which prompted woven slogans like melancholy and true self) and the color combinations found on old covers of The Paris Review. This season, a holiday in Greece was her starting point: While in Athens this past summer, she recalls, We stayed with friends in the historically anarchic suburb of Exarcheia. The collections standout piece, the Carrington cardigan, plays with the same fusion of tradition and rebellion.

Conversely, the more time they spent on nonscreen activities, like playing sports or hanging out with friends, the less likely they were to experience those problems.

us,Whats on TV Friday: The Two Popes and The Aeronauts,"THE TWO POPES (2019) Stream on Netflix. Holy men bond, quarrel and drink Fanta in this papal dramedy, which casts two seasoned British actors  Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce  as Catholic leaders with clashing social beliefs. Directed by Fernando Meirelles (The Constant Gardener) from a screenplay by Anthony McCarten (Bohemian Rhapsody), the movie focuses on the relationship between Pope Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and the future Pope Francis, Jorge Bergoglio (Pryce), during a period when Benedict was nearing retirement and Bergoglio was moving toward becoming his successor. The Two Popes is really three movies: a behind-the-scenes tale of Vatican politics, a mini-biopic about the current pontiff, and a two-man study of friendship, rivalry and major British acting, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. The first, though intriguing, is more puzzling than illuminating. The second feels a bit like a Wikipedia page, albeit one with first-rate cinematography. The third is absolutely riveting, a subtle and engaging double portrait that touches on complicated matters of faith, ambition and moral responsibility.",2019-12-20T06:00:12+0000

The popular rebellion in Chile  a country often held up as an example of success predicated on good behavior  is only the most extreme instance of a discontent that is either breaking out or simmering in almost every South American nation.

As I got older, that got harder to do. The 28-day cycle of her magazine work, too, was on her mind. Then, in 1990, a decisive moment presented itself. Cox was in New Yorks SoHo, having a drink with some industry friends at Jerrys, a favorite of the 90s fashion crowd. I said, Its amazing, Nelson Mandela has been released from prison after 27 years.

But Los Angeles has got to be as dark as it gets. Originally a Lifetime series, You picked up steam near the beginning of the year after its first season became available on Netflix. That season played something like Dexter crossed with a soap opera: It followed Joe, a killer, as he pursued a romantic obsession in New York City (the relationship didnt pan out). The new, second season moves the action to the West Coast. It gives Joe a job at a gourmet market and a fresh fixation: a co-worker played by Victoria Pedretti. The new location allows the showrunner, Sera Gamble, and her staff to add Southern California stereotypes to the generational and class formulas that draw Joes scorn, Mike Hale wrote in his review of the second season for The New York Times, and to throw the Hollywood melodrama into the genre blender along with the rom-com.

The climate is hotter, and much of the food and music can only be authentically consumed in the region itself. It is also a hub of Brazilian political agitation (the northeast, of which Recife is a de facto capital, was the only region to vote against the right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, in the last election). Visitors today will find a city that seems at first glance unlovable: One of the most famous songs about the city  and an example of a Recife music genre called manguebeat, or mangrove beat  is called Rivers, Bridges and Overpasses (Rios, Pontes e Overdrives), and thats what Recifes center looks like, to a large extent.

Stock prices have been buoyed by a mere whiff of optimism that the economy  despite occasional hiccups and dire prognostications by so-called experts  will keep chugging along. And the Federal Reserve deserves credit, too, for cutting interest rates despite scowls from a White House that wanted more. So far this year, the S&P is up 29 percent. But the market crept up gradually as investors felt their way through the turbulent year, interrupted only by a handful of short-lived retreats.

The first live-action movie based on the Pokemon franchise is sure to please fans of the video game series  less so film buffs. Tim (Justice Smith) arrives in Ryme City, where Pokmon and humans coexist, after his father, who is a detective, seemingly died in a car accident. He meets the fuzzy and adorable title character (voiced by an amusing Ryan Reynolds), who suspects Tims father may not be dead.

Guides there take tourists to peace walls, the tall barricades of corrugated metal and concrete erected during the sectarian conflict, known as the Troubles, that began in 1968 and ravaged Northern Ireland for three decades. The walls were built to divide Protestant and Catholic enclaves and to prevent people from killing one another as the spiraling cycle of attacks took hold. Today tourists from around the world visit the walls and take selfies. This type of tourism is more peculiar in Belfast than in some other cities shaped by a legacy of atrocity. You can visit the intact parts of the Berlin Wall, for instance, with the knowledge that the wall no longer serves its original purpose. In Belfast, however, the walls are still there to divide, their continued presence deemed necessary to prevent a resurgence of violence.",2019-12-30T20:43:55+0000

After 28 of them, weve reached the 1950s, and a 30-something Sheeran has just learned that a neighborhood grocer shoved his daughter. This younger Sheeran is still played by the 76-year-old De Niro; digital effects have been used to take years off his face, a technique thats applied to a few actors as the film moves through time. And its this curiously smooth De Niro who marches the daughter back to the store, throws the grocer to the curb and stomps repeatedly on his hand.",2019-12-31T16:31:29+0000

The chef worked at some good restaurants in his hometown, Chicago, after culinary school, and then got himself a two-year stint at Akelarre, a restaurant with three Michelin stars overlooking San Sebastin, where he fell in love with the local food. Now 37, he is translating his passion for Basque food into a restaurant, named in homage to Hemingway, another Midwesterner devoted to Spain. After he left Spain, Mr. Bartlow returned to Chicago, worked at Alinea and then came to New York, where he held a number of jobs over the years, most recently at Frenchette and Quality Eats. He describes the food at Ernestos as a hybrid  influenced by Spain, Paris and Frenchette. Still, its richly infused with Basque flavors and ingredients, like morcilla en croute, fried hake with roasted peppers, salt cod in a Basque pepper sauce, and rice with rabbit and snails. Im not Basque, but I studied there and have roots there, he said. I feel as though San Sebastin is my home base. Pintxos, Basque-style tapas bites, accompany drinks. The space, with windows on two sides, brick walls on the other, is dominated by a long bar. Adjacent to it on a side street, will be a cafe, opening in a week or so, for breakfast, pastries, sandwiches and, in the evening, pintxos from the open kitchen.
