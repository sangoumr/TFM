The architect David Rockwells company, the Rockwell Group, has given the space a richly elegant but subdued look with shades of gray as the dominant palette. The Peak experience involves entering through a dim, plush lounge for cocktails and bar snacks on the fifth floor of Hudson Yardss retail building. From there, an elevator speeds up and docks at a spacious lobby, with the restaurant to one side and private dining rooms and an event space opposite. The restaurant dips gradually from a curved, brass-trimmed 45-seat bar area to a 110-seat dining room, where sculptural light sticks hang from the ceiling and bare tables on a few levels afford views like a birds-eye of the Empire State Building. Does it remind you of Windows on the World? Of course, but with less grandeur and gilt. The restaurant is run by RHC, the English company that also manages Wild Ink in Hudson Yards. The executive chef, Christopher Cryer, who was in that role at the Seamores seafood restaurants, has created a fairly brief menu of sophisticated yet accessible American fare like Atlantic scallops with cauliflower pure, beef tartare, rigatoni with lamb sausages, roasted monkfish with littleneck clams, cauliflower steak, braised short rib, rotisserie chicken and a fried potato terrine. Local ingredients dominate. (Opens March 12)",2020-03-03T16:41:33+0000

Jenny Goldfarb, a vegan for nearly 10 years whose family was in the Jewish deli business in New York, decided that the taste of a hefty corned beef sandwich or a Reuben should not be on vegans no-fly list. She spent months in her kitchen experimenting with wheat, chickpeas, beets, tomatoes, spices, sweeteners and yeast, and finally, in 2018, began introducing the results in Los Angeles. Sarges Delicatessen & Diner in New York started serving her Mrs. Goldfarbs Unreal Deli Corned Beef in January. Its increasingly sold nationwide. The meat approximates the slightly crumbly texture of the real thing fairly well, and delivers its salty, somewhat smoky flavor. (Its also kosher.) Its a true departure from the usual burgers and sausages that vegan meat mimics. But whats missing is the fat, especially for those, like me, who do not prefer lean corned beef. Thus, its best in a sandwich dressed with mustard and coleslaw or in a Reuben, in the company of gooey Russian dressing, melting vegan cheese and a moist layer of sauerkraut.",2020-03-09T20:43:52+0000

us,A Watch Brought Back From the Brink of Extinction,"The worlds first high-frequency automatic chronograph was introduced in 1969 by Zenith, a Swiss watchmaker founded more than a century before in the town of Le Locle. Unrivaled in timing precision (to one-tenth of a second) with a barrel-shaped tonneau case displaying a round dial with three charcoal-tinted subdials, the El Primero was considered a mechanical marvel; its chronograph module used an entirely integrated caliber, not just one bolted to an existing automatic movement. But the El Primero wasnt on top for long: Just a few years later, quartz  an element that enabled watches to tell time even more accurately  threatened to make mechanical watches obsolete. Luckily, Zeniths chronograph, along with the company, was saved when, in 1988, Rolex used the elegantly slender, self-winding caliber to power an updated version of its classic Daytona, which turned the movement into a cult favorite. Fifty years after El Primeros debut, the company has released a timepiece that pays homage to the original 1969 model. Just two small tweaks were needed to bring it into the present: The hollow links of the original bracelet designed by the renowned Geneva firm Gay Frres have been rendered in solid steel; and theres now a sapphire crystal caseback, the better to fixate endlessly on a timepiece that helped fine horology take a leap into the future. $8,200, zenith-watches.com.",2020-03-10T15:00:04+0000

us,Whats on TV Thursday: Charlie Says and the Dixie Chicks,"CHARLIE SAYS (2019) 9 p.m. on Showtime. Mary Harron vacillates between prison and movie ranch in Charlie Says, her drama about the Charles Manson cult. Though she is best known as the director of the satirical serial-killer study American Psycho, Harron here pays relatively little attention to Manson himself (played by Matt Smith), instead focusing on three of his female followers (played by Hannah Murray, Marianne Rendn and Sosie Bacon). That trio tells the story here. The movie shows them both during their time with Manson and after the fact, in prison, where they recount their story to a graduate student (Karlene Faith, played by Merritt Wever). Its a tough, difficult story that, anchored by Guinevere Turners script, Harron recounts with lucid calm, compassion and intelligent interpretive license, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. She revisits some of the familiar locations, including the dusty California ranch where the Manson family set up house, and she carefully restages some of the murders. For those familiar with the horrific details of those crimes, the movie may seem wholly uninviting, but bear with Harron  she has something to say.",2020-03-12T05:00:06+0000

In his writing, Yanagi proposed a revindication of a provincial industry of handmade utilitarian objects that are indispensable to the daily life of ordinary people, that are used in commonplace settings, that are produced in large numbers, and that are inexpensive. He felt these folk crafts were fundamental to the restoration of beauty in a world drifting toward soulless mechanization. The people who made them, he wrote, have entered the way of salvation through unconscious faith. It is a path open to all. Craft, in Yanagis estimation, was not only an artistic movement but a moral one, nothing less than a way to save the world.",2020-03-16T09:00:24+0000

But the game malfunctions, leaving Bethany, another of the friends, in the real world and dragging in Spencers grandfather (Danny DeVito) and his old friend (Danny Glover). Whats more, the youngsters dont have the same avatars as before  which makes for some amusing and not-so-amusing performances. (Hart channeling Glover? Sure. Johnson playing DeVito? Not quite.)

The speediest speed readers claim as many as 30,000 words per minute, at which point research would suggest a significant loss of comprehension. It might be fine to skim through a user manual for an office printer, but dont skim Anna Karenina and expect to understand it. In this modern age, we always want to do everything faster, says Schotter, whose lab uses high-speed video to analyze readers eyes as they dart across text. Americas speed-reading obsession confounds Schotter; on average, people read twice as fast as they can comfortably listen. Reading is visually and cognitively complicated; its OK to reread a line because its confusing or, better yet, to linger on a phrase so beautiful that it makes you want to close your eyes.",2020-03-17T09:00:04+0000

The plot centers on a brotherly relationship between Davidsons character, a 23-year-old named Zeke, and Mo (Griffin Gluck), his ex-girlfriends 16-year-old younger brother, whom he walks through the finer points of the suburban slacker lifestyle. The story also involves small-time drug dealing and Mos pursuit of a crush (played by Oona Laurence). Though Davidson, Gluck and Laurence show star potential, Orley either boxes them into a too-conventional coming-of-age arc or gives them cloyingly charming characteristics, Kristen Yoonsoo Kim wrote in her review for The New York Times.

Jackson play men who join forces to subvert discriminatory housing practices in this historical drama. Set primarily before the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the film begins by introducing Bernard S. Garrett (Mackie), an African-American entrepreneur who moves to Los Angeles along with his wife, Eunice (Nia Long). There, Bernard meets Joe Morris (Jackson), a club owner with whom he teams up on an admirable scheme: Buying homes in white areas and renting them out to members of the citys black middle class. They do that with the help of a somewhat guileless white colleague (played by Nicholas Hoult). The characters are based on real people. Its hard not to root for them even if theyre obvious and underdeveloped, burdened with dialogue that too often sounds programmatic rather than embodied, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. The film, Dargis wrote, uses laughs, white racism and black righteousness to soft-sell a tale of inequality, heroic capitalism and eye-drooping mathematics.",2020-03-20T05:00:06+0000

His interest in Memphis  a design collective formed in 1981 that placed an emphasis on bold colors and wild abstraction  stems in part from a fascination with the boundary-pushing aesthetics of that decade. In particular, Kirkwood is drawn to the graphic glass vases made by Ettore Sottsass, the Italian industrial designer and father of the postmodernist movement. I found my first Sottsass vase about six years ago in Paris, he says. I was struck by its shape and color  it resembled something a child might build. Since then, the 39-year-old has amassed a collection of over a dozen vases. Several are assembled on a windowsill in his Soho studio to catch the light, and a few contain the sculptural flower arrangements he prefers from Londons Fjura. Sottsass pieces may not be practical or classically beautiful, but they can really hold a room, says the designer, whose spring collection is inspired by the relationship between architecture and nature in Los Angeles.

Today, the tubs might be more technologically advanced but the practice remains deeply soothing. Sitting in water is the ideal environment for calming the mind and body, says the New York-based facialist Nachi Kanemaru Glick, who grew up taking a nightly bath at her childhood home in Miyazaki, Japan. The water helps ingredients penetrate the skin, the heat releases tension and its a quiet time for meditation and self-reflection. Or as Deborah Hanekamp, a New York-based wellness expert and author of the book Ritual Baths (out March 24) puts it, We all feel one way before we get in the bath, and then a bit better when we get out. The right mix of products and atmosphere can easily elevate the average soak, says the British facialist Alexandra Soveral, who has a background in chemistry.

Walker (Octavia Spencer), a daughter of formerly enslaved sharecroppers, who became Americas first female, self-made millionaire in the early 1900s.

This documentary, the latest offering from Barack Obama and Michelle Obamas production company, draws a direct line between a Catskills summer camp and the American disability rights movement of the 1970s. Directed by Jim LeBrecht and Nicole Newnham, the film begins by focusing on Camp Jened, which was founded in the early 1950s and served as a community for campers with disabilities.

In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that the film unfolds from a perspective of lived experience.

Set in April of the year its named for, 1917 stars Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay as a pair of British soldiers sent on a dangerous mission to deliver a message to troops on the front line. Their journey, shot by Roger Deakins (who won an Oscar for his cinematography), is made to look as if it were filmed in a single long take. The round-faced Chapman brings loose, affable charm to his role, while MacKay, a talented actor whos all sharp angles, primarily delivers reactive intensity, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. This lack of nuance can be blamed on Mendes, who throughout seems far more interested in the movies machinery than in the human costs of war or the attendant subjects  sacrifice, patriotism and so on  that puff into view like little wisps of engine steam.",2020-03-26T05:00:07+0000
