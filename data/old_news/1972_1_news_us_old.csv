This is four or five times the number of works needed to demonstrate the scope of Mr. Chamberlain's gifts.

us,' Dynamite Chicken' Is Aimed at the Young,"Having described ""Dynamite Chicken,"" which landed at the Kips Bay yesterday, as a ""multi-media movie magazine inspired by the TV generation,"" Ernie Pintoff, its producer-director, has almost said it all.In this case, the medium is mostly the message. But the medium blithely overlooks stressing the points of a good number of its messages in favor of a succession of kaleidoscopic glimpses of youth's apathy or revolt against the Establishment. Like its pertinent four letter words and nudes, ""Dynamite Chicken"" may be fun and games on occasion but it's hardly a shocking revelation these days.Since it was aimed at the college circuits, where it has been shown for some time, ""Dynamite Chicken"" briefly employs the talents of practically everyone adored by the campus crowd, from Joan Baez to Andy Warhol, in skits, songs and on its sound track. And Mr. Pintoff, who's kidded our foibles in cartoons (the Oscar-winning ""The Critic"") on TV and on film, has been aided by a legion of filmmakers and entertainers in fashioning this ""contemporary probe of the mores and manners of the revolutionary era and a lot of other things.""But ""Dynamite Chicken"" often appears to be a lot of other things. The Ace Trucking Company, for example, projects authentic comedy in their version of filming a TV commercial. A nude unsuccessfully reading for the role of ""Cinderella"" is funny, not obscene, as is an imitation of Lyndon B. Johnson.The varied views of Black Panthers, hard hats versus intellectuals on the American Flag, Women's Lib, Malcolm X and Vietnam are offered straight and/or with tongue in cheek but only with spasmodic impact. There is little doubt that a torrid, strip-teasing ""nun"" is sophomoric stuff compared with the satiric thrust of Ron Carey's swinging ""priest"" miming to the beat of Lionel Goldbart's ""God Loves Rock and Roll"" or Joan Baez's tender rendition of ""Carry It On.""In short, while no one is chicken here, ""Dynamite Chicken"" is rarely dynamite.",1972-01-04T05:00:00+0000

us,'Glass Houses':Jennifer O'Neill Stars at Local Theaters,"Because of the monomaniacal intensity of the sexual hunger that motivates almost everyone in the film, Alexander Singer's ""Glass Houses"" looks very much like a put-ona rather high-class one, as a matter of factof the old-fashioned, soft-core pornographic movies that the more technical, less Freudian-oriented hard-core features have since rendered obsolete.Kim, as beautiful and rapacious a teen-ager as ever entered a middle-aged moviemaker's fantasies, has what used to be called an unnatural desire for her father, Victor, a bored Los Angeles businessman. Victor, however, is having an affair with Jean, who is no older than his daughter, while his wife holds neighborhood action meetings on ecology and sleeps with the local novelist.Meanwhile (and ""Glass Houses"" is big on meanwhiles, through lots of crosscutting between simultaneous sex scenes), Victor's business partner, Ted, is having an affair with Kim, who is always thinking of Dad, which is why she arranges for herself and Ted to accidently meet Victor and Jean at a weekend encounter group.Only professional ethics prevent me from telling you what happens next, but I can report that the climax involves some quite fancy editing and juggling of realitythe sort of thing that no self-respecting porno fan would put up with for more thanwell  10 minutes. (Porno fans are the most hopeful people in the world.)""Glass Houses,"" however, is not pornography, and it's not really as stupid as it sounds. It is a fairly intelligent, perceptive look at a group of rather shabby people whose emotions are no deeper, nor more complex, than the movie that records them.Mr. Singer, who created something of a stir with his first film, ""A Cold Wind in August,"" in 1961, has a certain talent for dealing seriously with characters who are not of the first interest (as he showed in the otherwise preposterous Lana Turner movie ""Love Has Many Faces""). The surface reality of ""Glass Houses""middle-class Los Angeles homes, with their dens and dishwashers, suburban motel rooms, air-conditioned officesgives the people a validity and interest that helps to neutralize, at least partially, the plain dumbness of their actions.The performers also are completely legitimate, especially Bernard Barrow as the father and Jennifer O'Neill (""Summer of 42,"" ""Such Good Friends"") as his lovely mistress, the sort of girl you might want to ask what she's doing in a place like this. Deirdre Lenihan plays the daughter with the kind of subtlety that I associate with movies on the order of ""Plushette's Sweet Revenge.""There are, further, hints of real intelligence in the script written by Mr. Singer and his wife, Judith Singer. I'm not referring to a parlor game that is introduced at one point, a sort of Monopoly spin-off in which, if I remember correctly, one player says to another: ""You forgot my snipers across the street from your supermarket."" That's funny in an easy, obvious way. But I think it takes real inspiration to have Miss O'Neill turn on her lover in high dudgeon, when he is embarrassed by her revealing the details of last night's sexual performances, and scream at him because of his uptightness: ""That's how wars start!""""Glass Houses"" is not great, nor very good, but it has its wits about it. It opened yesterday at theaters around town on a double bill with ""The Owl and the Pussycat.""",1972-01-08T05:00:00+0000

No fewer than seven national shrines in New York, Philadelphia and Washington were either seized or picketed by antiwar demonstrators in the waning days of 1971, and all emerged unscathed and with their prestige enhanced. In addition to the Statue of Liberty, the shrines included Independence Hall and the Betsy Ross House in Philadelphia, the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, the White House and the nation's Capitol in Washington. The Vietnam Veterans Against the War demonstrated at these national shrines to focus attention on their cause, a Park Service spokesman declared, and now that things have quieted downs the stature of the shrines in the minds of the public has seemed to increased. Tourists want to be associated with an event of historical significance and they are flocking to the Statue of Liberty and the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials so they can say, I was there a dayor a week or a monthafter the demonstrations.' In light of this, would the Park Service welcome new demonstrations?

us,' Eagle in a Cage':Exile of Napoleon Is Subject of Romance,"The esthetic question of how to create a historical romance can sometimes, at least in the movies, be parboiled down to the generally practical problems of (a) how to outface history and (b) how to introduce romance. There have been some good, even some great, movies built out of such evasive exploitation. But Fielder Cook's ""Eagle in a Cage,"" which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater and which purports to deal with Napoleon's ultimate exile on St. Helena, isn't among them.The film sees Napoleon during his last years as essentially a dashing figure, tall, lean, athletic, in wonderful shape except for the pesky stomach condition that is rapidly killing him. Despite certain consolations on St. Helena he keeps plotting his escape.He is driven partly by a need for action, partly by love of power, but mostly by that sense of personal destiny that may afflict some figures in history but that absolutely obsesses figures in movie history.It is a sense that is commonly shared by everybody else, by the great man's enemies (""I make you realize how small you are,"" Napoleon taunts his jailer, the petty Sir Hudson Lowe) as well as his admirers, and that tends to mess up every aspect of his life. ""That's right! Attack! That's your greatest talent, isn't it,"" complains the wife of his most loyal follower, Count Bertrand, when what she wants from Napoleon is a little tenderness in bed.Which brings up the subject of romance, the substance of the tempestuous days and torrid nights on St. Helena, skinny dipping with Mme. Bertrand (the conditions of Napoleon's incarceration sometimes suggest Acapulco  before it went commercial) or mastering the hot-blooded young Betsy Balcombe.Now, Betsy Balcombe, unlike Mme. Bertrand, was in fact the historical Napoleon's friend on St. Helena. But while the history books describe her as a spirited girl of 14, the movie makes her an emotionally precocious 16, played by an actress of 24 (Georgina Hale) with a kind of mature intensity that argues for at least 30 years' experience on the stage. No wonder there is so much fire between them  from their big seduction scene near the end to their incredibly portentous meeting near the beginning, with my favorite line in the movie: Napoleon's ""Have a bonbon.""It should be obvious that the film-maker's imagination working at this level will create roles to tax the most imaginative of actors. But from his awesome cast, with a few exceptions, what he generally gets is a fairly professional elaboration of clichs. Neither Kenneth Haigh's Napoleon nor Billie Whitelaw's Fanny Bertrand quite escapes the embarrassments of the dialogue. But both Georgina Hale and Michael Williams as the young Irish doctor, O'Meara, though inappropriate, seem reasonably alive.Sir John Gielgud, however, seems wholly alive; and if there is any excuse for ""Eagle in a Cage,"" it is surely in its indulging his portrayal of unreconstructed old age. He plays a Lord Sissal, an emissary from London with a plan for Napoleon's return to France at the head of a puppet government.Of course, the plan falls through, but before it does Sir John has filled the screen with his glorious grimaces, has wonderfully insulted his companion of years, Sir Ralph Richardson as Lowe, and has demonstrated that for the movies there is nothing in the pageant of human history to match the triumphant cackle from an old man's mouth, the malicious glimmer in his eyes.",1972-01-10T05:00:00+0000

Last season yielded one pip from France, ""Daughters of Darkness,"" with the old tooth-and-fang theme artistically coiled around a Lesbian fugue.And so, on Saturday, did ""The Vampire Doll"" from Japan, wedged in among all the samurai sword-swingers at the Bijou Theater. This one, too, works just fine, from the opening shot, as the color camera peers through a rainswept wind-shield to a remote country house, with stately, rumbling harpsichord music  or the Oriental equivalent.Twenty minutes or so later, several things are very evident, after the first visitor disappears and two comely young people drive out to find him. Somebody has had a good look at Hitchcock's ""Psycho.""Secondly, while the director, Michio Yamamoto, also has the master's economy, he tells his grisly story with a cool, taciturn detachment all his own. Don't be fooled by what seems a conventional staging. There is plenty lurking around the bend, some of it hair-raising.Finally, the picture is exceptionally well-written, with a denouement that is fascinating andwell, almost credible. The acting is on a par with the rest. Unfortunately, the theater could supply only the skimpiest of credits on Saturday, so credit can't be allotted proportionately.The English titles are finewhat you can see of them, through nobody's fault. For here again we have a case of white-lettered translations appearing time after time on white garb or light backgrounds.

us,Screen: Mizoguchi's 'Utamaro' of 1946:Late Director's Work Opens at New Yorker Artist Is Portrayed by Minnosuke Bando,"If you want to know how we really treat what people like to call ""the art form of our times,"" you may consider the case of one of that art form's very greatest practitioners, the late Kenji Mizoguchi, who made more than 40 movies after the advent of sound (his career in silents began in 1923), only seven of which have had theatrical release in New York City. Since these seven, beginning with the magnificent ""Life of O'Haru,"" all date from the few years before Mizoguchi's death in 1956, I suppose a significant step backward has been taken with the premiere of ""Utamaro and His Five Women,"" which was made in 1946 and which opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater.The year 1946 is important because postwar difficulties explain some minor flaws in the film's technical quality, and because the story created major difficulties with the American occupation authorities, who were not happy at seeing any Japanese historical subject matter. However, Mizoguchi's theme is profoundly egalitarian, and his story from the life of Kitagawa Utamaro (1753-1806), an artist famous for his life-like depictions of beautiful women, is in one sense a celebration of human freedom that goes beyond even the freedom of a popular art.In general, the film moves from constraint to freedom, from the painfully gorgeous procession of court ladies against a background of blossoming cherry trees with which it opens (""Like a Harunobu painting!"" exclaims a passer-by, thus identifying the style that Utamaro helped suppiant) to the veritable cascade of prints inspired by a single tragic passion with which it ends.But this movement is by no means simple. For the freedom of Utamaro the artist (Minnosuke Bando) is paralleled and in a sense surpassed by the greater freedom of his favorite model; the courtesan Okita (Kinuyo Tanaka), whose disordered lifeshe ultimately kills an unfaithful loverhas its own pathetic and wasteful grandeur.Yet Okita is wrong when she hopes to possess her lover rather than to rest content with some moments of his love. And Utamaro is right because he loves no one woman, nor all women, nor even the refinement of his art, but rather the vitality of the image that is always in movement, always passing out of view. Once he tries to create a real flesh-and-blood painting, a cartoon to be tattooed on the back of a beautiful courtesan. But the girl runs away, a love flight, taking her tattoo with herthe flesh-and-blood painting wholly subservient to the demands of actual flesh and blood.One could schematize ""Utamaro and His Five Women"" on a scale of relative freedom of will and desire. Such a scheme would be complex (there are five representative women, and several more men) and useful, for the film is, among other things, the exercise of an exceptionally active and intricate intelligence.But the beauty of Mizoguchi's filmmaking is even more strikingand not, of course, separable from the beauty of his conception. His subdued performances, his eye-level camera (in contrast with the straining for unusual perspective typical of so much Japanese moviemaking) photographing into a depth of field that is virtually a test of vision for the audienceeverything contributes to a reasonable balance that evokes a rich classicism. It is a classicism of open awareness, and it values every romantic impulse that it chooses not to follow, preferring instead to sttay with what it understands to be the sustaining rhythms of the world.",1972-01-11T05:00:00+0000

Especially how did they do it after the destruc tion of the second temple in 70 A.D. and the dispersion of the inhabitants? For then these people had no land, no church, no physical center and no visible machinery to keep them intact and whole. The obvious answer is that they were held by the strength of an idea, and that their allegiance to it transcended the power of kings and emperors to break it. What Mr. Rivkin does is define that idea and show how it developed and how it served under conditions and in ages beyond the com prehension of those who formulated it in the first place.",1972-01-14T05:00:00+0000

The 60-minute movie was assembled by Yolande du Luart and a team of other film students at the University of California at Los Angeles, where Miss Davis's outspoken utterances, as a teacher and a protester, first got her in hot, capitalistic water. The movie is being shown through Wednesday at the Whitney Museum.The picture opens with a glimpse of Miss Davis, already a controversial figure, high up and peering through bars at the local Women's House of Detention, as street supporters rally outside.The rest of the footage backtracks and fills in her explosive career as a political leftist. She is never at a loss for words, and we get a distinct impression of force and sincerity as she gives interviews, addresses political meetings, holds informal discussions and finally leads a crowd of protesters into the courtroom at San Rafael, Calif.And what is Miss Davis like close up? Handsome, almost strikingly so, with a graceful, informal demeanor and an easy, beautiful smile. Miss Davis also has a sense of humor, at least in the informal classroom scene where she analyzes the hierarchical dominance of one large American corporation.In the most winning moment of the film, we see her alone at night in her Los Angeles apartment. She is silent, purposefully scribbling with a pen, one arm casually propping her bent head.But Miss Davis is seldom silent, at least in this picture, once she gets going with a torrent of words, whether denouncing the United States Government or ""prison injustice"" in her homeland. Asked whether Communism has succeeded entirely in countries like Russia and Cuba, Miss Davis said that it would not ""as long as there's one capitalistic country left.""On the steps of Los Angeles City Hall, Miss Davis informs a roaring crowd, assembled to protest the arrest of Black Panthers, of a ""national conspiracy of genocide to murder every black in the land."" She asserts ""our constitutional right to bear arms to defend ourselves.""Whether or not you agree with Miss Davis's assertions, this film is impressive.The ProgramANGELA DAVIS: PORTRAIT OF A REVOLUTIONARY, a documentary by Yolande du Luart, 60 minutes.

us,' The Cowboys':Wayne Stars in Rydell Work at Music Hall,"""Is it going to be like this every day  even on Sundays?"" asks the exhausted 14-year-old cowhand at the end of the first day of their cattle drive through what John Wayne has described as ""400 miles of the meanest country of the West.""Answers the older boy simply: ""There ain't no Sundays west of Omaha.""No Western with a line as lovely as that one can be completely terrible, but you quickly realize that Mark Rydell's ""The Cowboys"" has no intention of being as honest as you would like it to be, and, indeed, as it might have been had Mr. Rydell and his screenwriters stuck to what seems to have been their original idea. This is a Western seen through the eyes of a group of boys, 11 through 15, who, by a stroke of the kind of glorious fortune that visits young boys in juvenile fiction, suddenly find themselves as real cowhands in a real cattle drive in the Old West.""Gee willikers,"" one is tempted to expostulate, ""what a capital opportunity for adventure!""It all starts when old Wil Anderson (John Wayne), whose own sons have died after having gone mysteriously ""wrong"" in the distant past, finds that his regular ranch hands have deserted him to rush off on a gold hunt. Faced with the necessity of getting several thousand head of cattle to market, Wil takes on a dozen school boys as his hands.You immediately know that a numbingly contemporary, adult sensibility is at work when one of the boys turns out to be Jewish, when another turns out to be the half-caste son of a Mexican whore, and when Roscoe Lee Browne, whose diction is only slightly less melifluous than Sir John Gielgud's, turns up as the chuck-wagon cook. This cattle drive seems to have been organized not in desperation, but to conform to some odd Appellate Court decision.Even this might be tolerable, had the movie then allowed its youngsters some degree of juvenile reality, but they are constantly being wrenched into attitudes imposed on them by the adults. I was amused when the boys get into big Duke's liquor closet and become roaring drunk, and somewhat amused by their close brush with sex, in the forms of some extraordinarily pretty whores they just happen to come upon in the wilderness (on their way, no doubt, to a Miss Universe contest), but the finale, in which the boys slaughter a band of cattle rustlers, is simply ridiculous. It isn't that I believe children to be necessarily humane creatures (Mark Twain cured me of that myth), but that the brutality is all too easily, and witlessly effected.Wayne is, of course, marvelously indestructible and he has become, an almost perfect father figure, without whom ""The Cowboys"" would be even more ludicrous than it actually is, despite the fine Western camerawork of Robert Surtees and the excellent supporting performances by people like Slim Pickens, Bruce Dern (as an outlaw) and Colleen Dewhurst, as the exceptionally merry madame on a trail to nowhere.It is typical of the movie's little frauds that it makes a great point of having old Wil announce that he is 60 years old and not what he used to be, although big Duke is on the far side of 65, and showing it with style. So why, for heaven's sake, does the movie make him wear a toupee? ""The Cowboys,"" which opened yesterday at Radio City Music Hall, is so flecked with minor dishonesties that you come to recognize it as a sort of Formica Western, something that amounts to a parody of the real thing.",1972-01-14T05:00:00+0000

us,' Cisco Pike':Tale of Has-Been Rock Star Opens at Forum,"It's gotten to the point that whenever a movie starts with long-shots of its hero walking down city streets, which are photographed through zoom lenses, accompanied by soft rock music on the soundtrack, it takes all the discipline I can muster to keep from immediately walking out of the theater into my own streets and into my own life. The banality of such mood footage is usually an absolutely accurate indication of the banality of the drama that is to follow.Such is the beginning of Bill L. Norton's first feature film, ""Cisco Pike,"" the sad and solemn story of a has-been rock star (Kris Kristofferson) who is blackmailed by a crooked narcotics agent (Gene Hackman) into disposing of $10,000 worth of Acapulco gold in 53 hours.Although ""Cisco Pike"" is better than, say, ""The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart,"" ""Getting Straight,"" ""Making It"" and a couple of dozen other movies that start in the same way, it's not really that much better and, like those movies, it finally boils down to the terrible fact that the fiction in the foreground is no match for the realism of the found objects in the background. If you're like me, you survive these films by reading the mesages that enter the eye peripherally, as street signs and billboards, as the data on gasoline pumps, and as neon invitations to eat and drink, to enjoy, to park, to wash, and, especially, to try. All life, as Robert Frost did not say, is an accumulation of tries.Which is not to say much about ""Cisco Pike""because there isn't much to say about it except that Kristofferson seems to be a much more interesting rock performer than an actor, and that Karen Black, who plays his mistress, has become so familiar to movie audiences that it's now impossible to accept her as a dumb broad. She is too intelligent, and it shows. Viva, who was pregnant when the film was made, plays an eccentric Los Angeles character who is pregnant, with no huge amount of skill.Gene Hackman, who was named the best actor of 1971 by the New York film Critics for his role in ""The French Connection,"" would probably be more effective as the ratty cop if the movie were good which it isn't. ""Cisco Pike"" opened at a number of theaters here yesterday on a double bill with ""Machine Gun McCain,"" an Italian movie shot mostly in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, which also isn't much good, but at least it doesn't leave you with reading time on your hands.",1972-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,A 'Kingdom in the Clouds' for Children,"Xerox has done it again, importing a nice movie for children  a Hungarian-made live-action fairy tale called ""Kingdom in the Clouds.""Equipped with dubbed English, the picture played weekend matinees in Rockland County last week. Today and tomorrow it moves into numerous neighborhood showcases for early shows in Nassau, Suffolk, Queens and Brooklyn. Next weekend it blankets Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester.The Xerox Corporation again is to be commended for conscientiously putting some decent entertainment for children onto movie screens that seem to be getting bluer and bluer. Some of these features for youngsters from abroad, where producers at least bother, are wooden, unimaginative duds, baited with the label of a familiar fairy tale. By the time they get here, with slapdash English dubbing, they arc fast-buck horrors. The kids should picket.The Xerox film unit has been carefully selective so far. The second import in its series last November, ""The Magic of the Kite,"" was a charmer, made in Paris and Peking. So is this new one from Hungary  and where will Xerox shop next?On film, a live-action fantasy pitched to a young level can lumber like an uneasy elephant. This one moves at a simple, graceful clip as a noble youth of yore treks over the mountains to find a mythical kingdom of eternal life.By any standards, the picture is beautiful to look at, with lavish, exotic costumes and a stunning sweep of never-never land that blends deep, natural, panoramas and artistic interiors. The English dubbing is quite good, fortunately, as the handsome hero encounters such fairy-tale staples as a beautiful princess, a talking horse, a slimy, green-tinted witch and his arch-enemy, the Prince of Liars.The pace gets a little stiff and starchy inside the ornate palace, where royalty glides around like molasses. But the middle third clatters like a slam-bang Western, including some fighting that small boys should relish. No gushing blood here. Parents can relax.The musical score is lovely and lyrical on cue, and ripely thumping when it should be, with the horse-bound hero streaking away like good old Hopalong. Finally, the tale ends with a sensible, earthy twist that all ages might ponder: reality beats dreamland.Adults should enjoy this exotic eyeful, too. But let's rejoice that Xerox has stretched a hand overseas to the Budapest Film Studios and picked itself a plum for the children. This is their hour and a half.",1972-01-15T05:00:00+0000

I have long felt that ???ve Story"" was under ???ed by most American ???vie critics, and now I ???could have to add, by Is???li audiences as well. For ???en in the context of Israeli ??? production (not, from ???at I have seen, the artistic ???ry of the Middle East), ???ishke Goes to War"" must ???ape at least close to the ???ysmal bottom.Fishke doesn't exactly go war. He goes into the re???rves for a while so as not be separated from his pal ???hmil, like Fishke, a Ha???ic Jew, who has been ???ed up for training.Despite his total and pre???table ineptness Fishke ???kes a great soldier, and ???en the time comes for a ???aliatory raid against a ???nd of Arab guerrillas he ??? his friends get to in???de Jordan so as to bring ???ck the guerrilla leader ???ve.Much of what follows takes ???ce inside an Arab niglit-???b, where the raiders, aided a beautiful singer, a ???ewess from England, held force,"" collect their man. ???ey also fraternize a bit ???th the local talent, belly ???ncers mostly, and so as not to blow their Arab disguises the Israelis begin speaking in English. At this point the film's titles, which had been running in Hebrew and English, take off after some special logic of their own and become Hebrew and French.But for the most part ""Fishke Goes to War"" goes crazy in less engaging ways. Solo Moshe plays Fishke with a high-pitched voice, a mincing manner, and a standard skyward look of tender exasperation that is, I think, supposed to produce laughter, if only because it is so full of laughter-begging clues.I suspect a similar intention with the general treatment of the Hasidim, all of whom of are aggressively odd (if lovable) and who typically come not from Israel but from the old countryPoland, New York City, or the like.""Fishke Goes to War"" opened yesterday at the May-fair Theater, where it will play together with a live musical review starring Jo Amar.",1972-01-20T05:00:00+0000

The story is the flight of sugarcane plantation slaves to an island inhabited by earlier fugitives. The time is 1641.While the picture moves like molasses and the performances amount to crude, self-conscious pantomime, this Engish-subtitled movie, burning with sincerity, is curiously admirable, even haunting. And it does indeed suggest a larger human drama throbbing off-screen in the background.The players behave with a natural dignity. In their midst is a black youth named Antonio Pitanga, whose strong face conveys volumes. Add to this artlessness the simple eloquence of the dialogue, vivifying the cruelty, horror and despair of slavery.Finally, Mr. Diegues's dramatic microcosm is rooted with utter authenticity in the primeval landscape of a background that has been photographed with bleak austerity. You can smell Brazil. Above all, you can feel the people we see here and feel for them.The new film is double-billed with ""Angela Davis: Portrait of a Revolutionary"" at the New Yorker Theater.",1972-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,' To Find a Man' Explores Today's Youth,"Youth hasn't been wasted on the young in ""To Find a Man,"" the new arrival at Columbia II, which intimately scrutinizes the today life-style of New York's affluent adolescents. Under Buzz Kulik's crisp direction, the largely unknown youngsters here are surprisingly cool and efficient in concentrating on the script's thin, but major, premise that abortion is still more of a problem than, say, unsightly pimples.It makes for a hip, sometimes funny and occasionally poignant view of kids under momentary stress. But in stressing the trials of its two principals it is a good deal less than pointed about the all important painful business of growing up.The facets of the sophisticated high schoolers' characters and their awareness of sex are touched on seriocomically but only fleetingly as bright but blameless Andy tries to help pretty, sexy but vacuous Rosalind, whom he adores in his own fashion, get that abortion.To the credit of the with-it dialogue and natural performances, their efforts are starkly realistic and comic. Include among individual scenes that stick in memory a frantic visit to an orthodontist; their explicit and funny attempt at a pregnancy test, and a succession of trips to a city abortion clinic run like a supermarket, a private agency run casually and to a sympathetic, if blunt, doctor.Handling the comparatively brief adult roles with authority are Lloyd Bridges and Phyllis Newman, as Rosalind's newly rich, tense parents; Tom Ewell, as the physician; Tom Bosley, as an understanding druggist, and Antonia Rey, as Andy's dour but compassionate housekeeper.But ""To Find a Man"" really belongs to its young newcomers, principally through the extremely sensitive portrayal of Andy by a 16-year-old New Rochelle student, Darren O'Connor, and the persuasive characterization of the selfish and superficial Rosalind by 17-year-old Pamela Martin of Westport.They make this youth scene, filmed here and in Dobbs Ferry, refreshingly authentic and occasionally touching, even if ""To Find a Man"" leaves a viewer wishing they had all been involved in a bigger scene.",1972-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"French Charm of 'Smic, Smac, Smoc'","Charm in a movie is like bubble bath in a warm tub. A little of it is nice but an overdose can wither the hide of a hippopotamus. Claude Lelouch, the French director (""A Man and a Woman,"" The Crook""), traffics in so much charm that one is tempted to call for some kind of Federal controls. Save us, commissioner, before we shrivel to death!I say this right off because although I've never been one of Mr. Lelouch's boosters, I like almost everything I know about him, including the fact that he was one of the backers who made Abel Gance's epic ""Bonaparte and the Revolution"" possible. He is a generous and, apparently, an adventurous man. All of which leads me to his newest comedy, ""Smic, Smac, Smoc,"" which he dedicates to the Lumires, Louis and Auguste, and which he defines as the effort of objective reporters to describe ""a charming fiction.""It is that (I'm tempted to add, unfortunately)  about three comradely shipyard workers in the south of France, nicknamed Smic, Smac and Smoc, and their fairy-tale adventures when they attempt to give Smoc and his bride, a beautiful bakery worker, a proper wedding trip to St. Tropez in a stolen Mercedes. Actually about half of it (the first half) is delightful before it is overtaken by an acute attack of what a friend of mine used to call ""the elfins.""Yet the movie deserves our interest, and maybe ever our support. Mr. Lelouch, to whom the commercial cinema has been very good, has attempted to make a first-class film for something on the order of $30,000, shooting it in one week, in 16 millimeter, with synchronized sound and a small, excellent cast. His aim: to break the stranglehold of escalating production costs that not only limit the amount of production, but also effectively precensor the imaginations of filmmakers who feel they must appeal to the widest possible audience.""Smic, Smac, Smoc"" is itself no major breakthrough as entertainment. However, it represents such an interesting approach to moviemaking that I must admire it, as well as Mr. Lelouch and everyone connected with the venture. This incudes particularly Catherine Allegret, Simone Signoret's apple-cheeked daughter, who plays the bakery girl with the kind of sweetness one hasn't seen much of since silent-movie days, and Amidou, who plays her intensely passionate, Algerian bridegroom who, on their wedding night, seems to have a slight, comic, but momentary pang about a future life without the jolly putains who have sustained him until then.Francis Lai, the man who has composed the music for all of Mr. Lelouch's films, also appears in the movie as a blind minstrel who plays an accordion and simply won't quit.""Smic, Smac, Smoc,"" which opened yesterday at the Festival Theater, is fairly runny with charm, but it is also a technically first-rate job of moviemaking.",1972-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,'Something Big':Dean Martin Stars in Caper of 1870 West,"""Something Big,"" directed by Andrew V. McLaglen and written by James Lee Barrett, is one of those Pop period Westerns that's difficult to dislike even though it's not really very good, and I suspect that the best place to see it is on 42d Street at the New Amsterdam Theater, rather than at any of the dozen or so other, perhaps fancier theaters where it also opened yesterday. Like being stuck on a subway, or bearing witness to a mugging on the other side of the street, watching ""Something Big"" is a group experience of a contemporary, if secondary, order.It's apparent that all of the various intelligence and talents who worked on the film kneew exactly what they were aiming at. That is, an 1870 Dean Martin Western that utilizes, makes a certain amount of fun of, but doesn't basically disturb the image of the television personality who might best be described as a GP-rated Perry Como.The plot of ""Something Big"" can't be outlined without ransacking it of every meaning, since what happens is all there is to it. Martin, a transplanted Pennsylvanian, is a sort of failed outlaw, looking for ""something big"" so he can go back to Pittsburgh and marry a girl he left behind five years before. The something big turns out to be a raid on a famous Mexican outlaw's remote treasury, an operation that requires a Gatling gun, and a woman whom Martin can trade for the gun.The film is not even as complicated as this brief summary might sound, but it involves some quite attractive performers including Brian Keith, Honor Blackman, Carol White [this West is very big on English women, which may be a comment on the recent day when English secretaries were industry status symbols), Ben Johnson, Albert Salmi, Joyce Van Patten and Judi Meredith.Mr. Martin grins his way through it, wearing an extremely handsome, well-cut suede coat. He is the centerpiece of a fiction that occasionally recalls the sentimentality of John Ford, with mock seriousness, as well as the inane cheeriness of those TV Westerns whose heroes never die, but just go into reruns.",1972-01-22T05:00:00+0000

For them as for Macbeth it is as tedious to go o'er as to turn back. Partners in an overdrawn account, they are guaranteed bankruptcy. The milieu, the moment and the man conspire to produce the inevitable result. In one sense they are people who never had it so good. But it is a good whose worth they keep picking at until it unravels in their hand. Their action is a kind of perversity to be sure, except that one can scoop up samples of it from bombed out Eleventh Street, in New York, to HaightAshbury on the West Coast. All this makes the book sound somber, and I'll not pretend that Mr. Stegner has provided a rosyglow ending or that he has exalted the indomitable spirit of man or however it is referred to. But its violent and lacerating ending is not the whole book. A good part of it is screamingly funny. The dialogue is sharp, aphoristic, bright. It makes one envious. I don't know people who talk like that, but I wish I did. Mr. Stegner makes it all sound natural and convincing. The structure of the novel is tight; the pace is quick.

Corral as among the leading first causes of world cinema. Students of history will remember the 1860's as traditionally signalling the end of the old, the birth of the new Japan. But for the movies it was a time of absolutely wholesale murder, largely on a freelance basis.""Tenchu"" (which means ""Heaven's Punishment,"" and is supposed to be the cry of the assassin while dispatching his victim) is the story of an uncouth samurai named Izo (Shintaro Katsu), attached to a leader of the Tosa clan, for whom he kills not wisely but too well. Such is his zeal and so spectacular is his record that the leader (Tatsuya Nakadai), fearing too much of the wrong publicity, dismisses him, cancels his sake-shop expense account, has him blacklisted and more or less conspires in his arrest as a common vagrant Izo ultimately gets a self-sacrificial revenge, but it comes only as an ironic postscript to a misspent life.""Tenchu"" suffers, as do a good many samurai dramas, from a hero with more character traits than character; and in general, despite its slickness and its commitment to violent action, it suggests a craft that is overburdened with wasteful detail. Too much mood setting, too much obviously effective wide-screen composition, too many beads of sweat on Izo's screwed-up faceit is not art cinema but it is very arty, and it is as far as I can imagine from the proportionate balance of such masters as Ozu and Mizoguchi.However, there are points of interest. These include two pleasant performancesone by Yujiro Ishihara as a friend of Izo, a gentle sane man to whom of course nobody listens; another by Mitsuko Baisho as the prostitute Izo frequents, who plays with a coarse but complex vitality that might grace a better movie.Along with its bloody murders, ""Tenchu"" offers one equally bloody suicide. It is performed by a disgraced aristocrat played by the late Yukio Mishima, the novelist. Mishima, in addition to writing, acted in some movies, and I gather he rather coveted such roles. This must have been one of the last before his suicide in earnestwhich indicated that the spirit of the old Japan is not dead, but only repeatedly dying.",1972-01-25T05:00:00+0000

us,"Elizabeth Taylor Cast as Caine's Wife, Zee","Although I've seen ""X Y & Zee"" only once (and have no intention of sitting through it a second time), I'm reasonably convinced that the original screenplay by Edna O'Brien (""Three Into Two Won't Go"") is a much more interesting study of an absolutely dreadful marriage, and of the sweet though not especially innocent girl who is brought into it, than anything in the movie that Brian G. Hutton has made from it. The film is coarse, noisy and, finally, stupid, like people at a nearby table who won't shut up.Zee (Elizabeth Taylor) and Robert (Michael Caine), a wealthy London architect, live on the edge of high-class despair and love every minute of it. Zee's face is still extraordinarily beautiful and she calls herself womanly, although she is probably just fat. It's hard to tell since she wears tent-like dresses that seem to have been designed for a restless grave. She also boozes constantly and plays the stereo at such a pitch that my first thought was that Robert was hanging around as often as he does only because he is deaf.He isn't, Robert likes confusion. He and Zee are blatantly unfaithful to each other, fight to physical knock-downs, and then make up in sudden moments of what pass for tenderness in your ordinary, upper middle-class, sado-masochistic relationships. All goes swingingly until Robert falls genuinely in love with Stella (Susannah York), who runs a boutique (and may thus quality as a hip equivalent to the old sewing machine girl).The story of ""X Y & Zee"" (my nomination for the dumbest title of the yearand this is only January) concerns Zee's fierce campaign to keep Robert, one way and another, which eventually necessitates her using (are you really ready?) her body, of which, of course, she has plenty to spare. Poor Stella, it seems, has tendencies.As directed by Mr. Hutton, who made one of my favorite idiotic action moves (""Where Eagles Dare""), ""X Y & Zee"" never misses an opportunity to overstate a line, a point or a mood, or simply to confuse the few things that, from the delicacy of the original (not televised) version of ""Three Into Two Won't Go,"" I take to be Miss O'Brien's sensibilities.Behind the posh, but essentially junky production values (lovely sets, good character actors, including superb Margaret Leighton wearing a lot of odd-colored wigs), one can gather hints of what ""X Y and Zee"" means to be about. It isif I read Miss O'Brien correctlya kind of case history of a series of individual conspiracies, each designed to overthrow a heart. The tactics may be murderous but the manners always civilized.For the film to make any sense, the performances must be on something like the same plane. Not necessarily at the same volume, but in the same world, Mr. Caine and Miss York do, I think, effect connections that are occasionally complex and moving. Their characters have histories and recognizable patterns of behaviorpasts that are as much apparent in gestures and modes of speech as in spoken exposition.There is, however, a great void in the case of the character the film cannot take its eyes off of. Miss Taylor is not a very interesting actress, but she need not seem as bad as she does here. Mr. Hutton allows her to play Zee as if she were the ghost of whores past, present and future, clanking her jewelry, her headbands, her earrings and her feelings behind her like someone out to haunt a funhouse.It is an unfortunately ridiculous performance, and you may have some idea of the measure of the imbalance that her presence effects when I say that I'm convinced the story might have had a different ending had Miss Taylor worn just one less Medusa ringlet, or even one less layer of eye shadow.",1972-01-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Winter Soldier':Vietnam Documentary Opens at Whitney,"""Winter Soldier,"" which opened at the Whitney Museum yesterday as part of its New American Filmmakers Series, is a documentary feature composed entirely of Vietnam veterans' testimony, most of which was photographed and recorded during hearings in Detroit, Jan. 31-Feb. 2, 1971, sponsored by the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.It includes occasional official newsreel clips, as well as still photographs supplied by the testifying veterans (including one Brownie snapshot of a triumphant, smiling G.I. standing at the head of a newly murdered Vietnamese), but it is most agonizing in its young, barely molded words and facesthe record of men trying to make some sense of an experience that to them clearly makes no sense. Yet something very important is missing from the movie and, by extension it seems, from what might be called the American character.The movie is an oral history, told by former United States soldiers, sailors and marines who, for the most part, admit to having participated in various atrocities without question. What is obviously missingand I suppose this is hardly news nowis some explanation as to how we could have managed to raise a couple of generations of people who could participate in the conduct described without experiencing the kind of sorrow that activates conscience. This, I assume, is the question that the film intends to raise.The other question, which is as much a moral question as a dramatic one, is what happened to change these men's minds, and when? At what point, for example, does a man, who could pose with the corpse of someone he has just shot, decide that he doesn't want to do this anymore? About halfway through ""Winter Soldier"" there is a moment that tells us about all the stories we are not hearing, when a clean-cut former G.I. recalls walking down a street in Cambridge and going out of his way to push a bearded student off the sidewalk. The student, he remembers, said simply: ""You make it very difficult for anyone to get to know you.""The former soldier then says something on the order of: ""I told my wife about this, and she helped me straighten my head out.""That is as close as ""Winter Soldier"" ever comes to providing an obligatory scene. The other conversions are unremembered. They take place silently, off-screen. All of which effectively limits the larger purposes of ""Winter Soldier,"" even for one who is sympathetic to its ends. I suspect that one of the reasons that what happened could happen is that we live in a culture whose slang, among other things, persists in referring to the mind as the head. We refuse to make distinctions that can, in the long run, recognize the difference between life and death.",1972-01-28T05:00:00+0000

These two outstanding works from the remarkable preRevolutionary period of the Russian avantgarde were acquired out of the big exhibition devoted to Russian modernism in the years 19081922 which opened at the Leonard Hutton Galleries, 967 Madison Avenue, in October, and is still having a marathon run (through Feb. 29). Needless to say, Mrs. Furtseva did not include the Hutton Galleries on her cultural tour of New York. She was, however, shown the two works now on view in the museum's first floor galleries.

Consequently the United States insisted on being allowed to inspect places in the Soviet Union from which suspicious seismic waves had originated.

Two such players, Fred Sherry, cellist, and Richard Fitz, percussionist, had been doing this for some time when it occurred to them that they might set up a permanent group of their own.

The four became the charter members, so to speak, of an organization called Speculum Musicae (Mirror of Music). They gathered other players around them, went through the red tape of getting incorporated and applying for grants. They gave couple of concerts last season at the Shakespeare Public Theater in the Village, appeared at Dartmouth College in its summer series and at Tanglewood during the Berkshire Music Festival and had some outoftown engagements this season.",1972-01-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Shorter Reviews,"To compare Flaubert and Joyce is hardly a novel idea; it's been going on since 1922, when Ezra Pound called attention to the resemblance in a review of Ulysses. Hugh Kenner and Harry Levin are among those who did it more recently. Mr. Cross's book is essentially a modest attempt to document points made by these critics, jtuctapos[ing] in a given chapter elements of a single book by each artist For examppie, expressionistic techniques for dramatically objectifying dreams and fantasies are studied through comparisons of the Circe episode in Ulysses and in Flaubert's La Tentation de Sainte Antoine. The early chapters contain rather vague discussions of moral issues and of authorial sympathy and judgment; Mr. Cross is more successful in the second half of his book where he illustrates the writers use of new techniques for a sustained and intensive probing of mental life. For the most part, however, he is merely providing further documentation of points already made by numerous others. In his final chapter he raises issues which would have made for a stimulating workFlaubert's and Joyce's attitudes toward language and culture.
