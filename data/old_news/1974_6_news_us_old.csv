This is the era Shirley Glubok documents in the latest of her Art of... series, employing her usual mixture of strong blackandwhite and sepia illustrations, accompanied by brief explanatory notes. It is a formula that has served her well in many of her previous books, particularly when  as in The Art of Ancient Egypt, The Art of Africa, for instancethe art involved was largely sculptural. But in this volume, where so many of the works discussed are paintings, the lack of color plates is a real drawback. And this time the notes seem all too brieftwo or three sentences about an artist and then on to the next subject, with no transitions, no connecting material. Certainly, Miss Glubok has covered a wide variety of artistic achievements in 48 pages, but even as an introduction to the period it seems unsatisfying, superficial. Perhaps the problem is that this time the subject matter demands a fuller treatment than the series format allows. ",1974-06-02T05:00:00+0000

Dell, of course, claims that they were first on the basis of having copies on sate in New York just after noon May 7, at a Fifth Avenue bookstore; Bantam had them on the trucks by noon in New York, in the stores somewhat later. Dell has since trimmed Its claims somewhat and a spokesperson there allowed that the two versions were virtually simultaneous. The question of who was on that is strictly for the record books, however (although at least one bookseller attributed Bantam's larger sales to its primacy), suffice it to say that they were both out fast, their people working around the clock, Bantam, the veteran at instant books performing smoothly.

Nigeria is under military rule, and by law politicking is not permitted, but ebullient Lagos residents talk long and loud about the proposed return to civilian rule in 1976.Three schools of thought on the subject are most often heard: 1. That the military should continue to rule. 2. That a civilian government should take over. 3. That the new government should consist of a combination of civilian and military leaders. Other current topics of conversationin English, the official language of this former British possession, and in various African languagesinclude traffic jams, housing shortages, the building boom and other indicators of a fastpaced, oilbolstered economic boom. In addition, people are talking about what promises to be the biggest of all African cultural celebrations, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, which is scheduled for November and December, 1975. Early indications are that as many as 100,000 visitors will come to this city of about a million people for the festival. Where are we going to put them? residents ask.

us,' One Eye' and 'O'Neil' Partners in Crime:The Casts,"""Dirty O'Neil"" and ""They Call Her One Eye"" arrived at local theaters yesterady to illustrate once again that a shallow, unappetizing double dish of crime, violence, ersatz sex and ersatz cops is certainly no better than one helping. For the record, ""Dirty O'Neil"" is American-made and ""One Eye"" is a Scandinavian, English-dubbed entry but neither does much for either girl-watching or crime-watching.Credit ""Dirty O'Neil"" with a rudimentary sense of humor about sex and cops, if not crime. Morgan Paull, as its titular, young, small-town police officer in California may be bored by his job but admits liking what he does, which is largely a dizzying series of quick dalliances with well-endowed local chicks. He may turn serious momentarily by knocking off three killers who have raped one of his willing girlfriends but in the end he is happily ready to return to the carefree amorous life.On the other hand, Christina Lindberg, has every reason to be grim as the ill-used, brunette beauty known as ""One Eye."" She's been rendered mute after having been raped as a child and things don't improve after she naively falls into the clutches of a notorious pimp (Heinz Hopf), who turns her into a dope addict and viciously blinds her to keep her in line.Naturally, Miss Lindberg can't be faulted for hating her ""clients"" and the malevolent boss and for becoming expert in karate and other handy talents, which she uses to destroy them systematically.Of course, Miss Lindberg, who is easy to look at, is constantly doleful since most of what occurs in ""One Eye"" is dreary. However, she brings one unique, cheerful fashion note to this rough, somber tale by wearing eye patches to match the color of each of the ensembles she appears in.

It's also reassuring: There's at least one place on earth today where, because of societal taboos, the pursuit of sex can still be a satisfactory, full-time avocation.The object of all the plotting and counterplotting in ""Malizia"" is Angela (Laura Antoneili), an extraordinarily gifted housekeeper who is not only pretty, young, gentle, wise and pliant (up to a limit) but also a first-rate cook, sewer and washer-up.Angela is almost too good to be true. She represents the sacred, the profane and the practical, especially to the head of the family, Don Ignazio (Turi Ferro), newly widowed and not at all sure he wants his dead wife's beneficent spirit hanging around the house, as the priest has promised. The spirit gets in the way of his pursuit of Angela. Antonio, the 18-year-old son, makes passes at Angela, and 9-year-old Enzino accepts her as a huge improvement over the mother he lost without visible unhappiness.The most deeply smitten is 14-year-old Nino (Alessandro Memo), who begins by presenting Angela with an anonymous rose every day. When his father announces his intentions of marrying Angela, Nino's courtship evolves into a curious cat-and-mouse game, though the roles of cat and mouse are reversed in midgame.Nino effectively plays on Angela's good heart to grab a quick feel or two, then uses these indiscretions to blackmail her into going about her housework fully clothed but without her bra. Underwear and its removal play a big part in Nino's fantasies, which somehow don't extend to consummated sex.There's a good deal of malice on Nino's part. This adds a dimension of cruelty to the comedy that expresses the intensity of the boy's frustrations, though it doesn't quite match the tone of the rest of the comedy. ""Malizia"" is at its best when it's examining the rituals of middle-class Sicilian life (a funeral where everything goes wrong and the corpse is almost burned up) and when it is leering at its sexually driven characters.Because Mr. Samperi has shot the film so close up, both literally and metaphorically. I suspect he's less interested in society than in psyches. ""Malizia"" is fairly murky in this department though the performers are true and precise.Miss Antonelli is angelic enough to be properly shocking when she begins to supply Nino with fetishes, and Turi Ferro is fine as the lustful but ever practical father. It's a role that became a principal resource for Italian comedy of this sort, which reached its peak in the nineteen-fifties and sixties, but is still nice to have around.",1974-06-06T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:' Herbie' Rides Again to Defend Landmarks,"Walt Disney Productions' ""Herbie Rides Again,"" which opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, is a movie that takes a firm stand for the defense of architectural landmarks and against real estate developers like mean, greedy Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn), the sort of man who, when he sees Rome's Colosseum, dreams of replacing it with a shopping center.The problem with comedies as witless as this is that the villains are much more appealing than the good guys. One winds up rooting for the fellows who would tear down the Plaza to put up a 100-story, glass-and-brass breadstick.""Herbie Rides Again"" is set in San Francisco and in that never-never land suggested by bad trick photography, when foreground objects have no visible relation to backgrounds. The film brings back the leading character of that earlier Disney box-office smash, ""The Love Bug."" Herbie, a 1963 Volkswagen sedan, is as bright and stanch as Lassie and 20 times as fast.In the course of the movie he has a major part in the successful campaign of a Nice Little Old Lady, to ward off Alonzo Hawk's wreckers to save her home; an old firehouse on top of a San Francisco hill.As played by Helen Hayes, the Nice Little Old Lady seems to be ineligible for sainthood only because of a minor technicality: she's still alive. She won't hear ill of anyone, she sees good in almost everything and she is able to converse with inanimate objects that, in addition to Herbie, include a retired San Francisco cable car and an ancient, upright music box.The film was directed by Robert Stevenson and written by Bill Walsh, who also collaborated on ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Love Bug."" There's nothing harmful about ""Herbie Rides Again""; it's simply not very good. All the technical and economic resources of the Disney empire cannot bring sincerity to a machine-made paean in praise of little-guy pluck.Of course, I felt the same way about ""The Love Bug"" and it earned $21-million in the United States alone. ""Herbie Rides Again"" may make only $15-million.",1974-06-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Woman of Ganges',"Stiff as uncooked asparagus, the figures who stalk through Marguerite Duras's ""Woman of the Ganges"" don't have to act, since the movie is narrated in English by two invisible women with lush French accents. ""Soch loff, soch dee-sire!"" they repeat, as they warble away about a middle-aged man who's returned to a seaside town to kill himself; there, he encounters a woman he loved long ago. The picture is playing at the First Avenue Screening Room today and tomorrow.Above a wintry beach, gulls wail obligingly, while the disembodied voices whimper as they evoke lost loves  ""Izzat rrreally her by ze edge of ze sea?""  and it becomes quite difficult to tell who's alive or dead in this movie. (All of the performers behave like zombies, but some are probably supposed to be ghosts.) It's also very hard to know who did what to whom in the past.Amid all the pacing through corridors, there's little spoken dialogue and barely any action. So it's an event when two characters bid each other good evening, when sand dribbles between someone's fingers, or when a muslin curtain stirs in the wind. There's some pretension to significant imagery here, but the result makes you want to yell or weep with boredom.Meanwhile, the narrators sluggishly state their passion for one another  ""You're so yonk, and I loff you ssso moch""  and some of the others say that they've lost their memories. Since Marguerite Duras neglected to give them any perceptible emotions, the response seems healthy.",1974-06-07T05:00:00+0000

The book is The Total Woman, by Marabel Morgan, a Miami, Fla., housewife (and proud of it), mother of two girls and a former beauty queen at Ohio State University. The book is a spinoff of a Total Woman course that Mrs. Morgan taught, which is now being given in 36 states by alumnae. The book's publisher; Fleming H. Revell, a small, venerable religious publisher out in Old Tappan, N. J., heard about tho course and asked Mrs. Morgan to write a book about it. Now sales are perking along quite nicely and the company admits it was surprised at the response thus far, 64,000 copies sold, 100,000 in print and sales at the rate of 35,000 a week. Mrs. Morgan's message for her gals, as she calls them, includes obedience to one's husband, as well as lots of praise and admiration (try oohing and ahhing over his muscles, for example, as one gal did) quoting from the Bible (frequently), Dr. David Reuben, Ann Landers and Calvin Cooligde and tossing off apothegms such as Sex is as clean and pure as cottage cheese, Mrs. Morgan ladles out advice and class assignments aimed at putting the sizzle back in one's marriage. Among the assignments: dress up in something exotically sexy and meet your husband at the door (Mrs. Morgan once employed a baby doll nightgown and white boots: Mr. Morgan chased her around the diningroom table). There is also advice on bringing up childrenMrs. Morgan is a disciplinarianand the final chapter urges a decision for Christ. Just to show that Christians don't have to be dull, one gal who took the Total Woman course at her local Southern Baptist Church was inspired to welcome her better half at the door dressed solely in black mesh stockings, high heels and an apron. He took one look and shouted Praise the Lord! If all this sounds tailored for the Bible Belt, it should be pointed out that the book is selling well in the New York City area. Mrs. Morgan's courses probably help publicize It, but it also spreads by word of mouth. Total Woman grads include singer Anita Bryant, Mrs. Jack Nicklaus and several Miami Dolphin wives.

us,A ThreeHorsepower tour Through Ireland,"BUS! The chilling cry was passed back by our daughter, who was on horseback up front, acting as outrider, as we trundled along an Irish road. My husband, who was walking behind dur caravan, a sort of roundroofed wagon, sprinted to the front and threw a halfnelson on Apaches head. I was on duty at the reins and I braced myself on the ledge that passed as the driver's seat, and shouted to our son, relaxing with comics inside the caravan. He leaped to the brakes. Then, like some Greek chorus, we all began to chant . . . Easy, Apache, steady now old boy, it's only another bus, while at the same time chivvying him and the caravan to the side of the road.The enormous bus, all glass and domed, bore down on us. Apache snorted, leaped forward and considered climbing the bank but was discouraged by the full weight of my husband hanging on his bridle. Apache then pondered a fast Uturn, but our daughter's friend, who was riding a horse at the rear, spurred forward to head him off. Poor Apache, trembling and snorting, finally stopped. By this time, so had the bus, 100 yards down the road, and a swarm of tourists from Australia were descending, cameras ready, convinced they had come upon real Irish tinkers, the gypsies of ballad and tale, making their colorful way through romantic County Wicklow.I am not sure we ever did convince those Australians that we wera middleclass, middleaged Americans who were on a week's tour with three youngsters in a rented horsedrawn vehicle.

us,Film: Poitier in 2 Roles:Stars in and Directs 'Uptown' Comedy,"""Uptown Saturday Night"" is the sort of film in which Harry Belafonte shows up as an all-powerful but somewhat befuddled black gang boss named Geechie Dan Beauford Geechie Dan looks eerily familiar though nothing like Mr. Belafonte. With those extraordinary, cotton-filled jowls, the pencil mustache and a manner of talking as if through a voice box lodged in his stomach, he is Marlon Brando's Godfather in burnt cork.Like the Belafonte performance, ""Uptown Saturday Night"" is essentially a put-on, but it's so full of good humor and, when the humor goes flat, of such high spirits that it reduces movie criticism to the status of a most nonessential craft.The star as well as director of ""Uptown Saturday Night"" is Sidney Poitier, a man ""whose way with comedy is reminiscent of Stanley Kramer's in ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."" It's less instinctive than acquisitive. He himself can't make anyone laugh but he knows people who can. Mr. Poitier has had the good sense to hire a lot of exceptionally talented and funny people, including Richard Wesley, who wrote the screenplay for ""Uptown Saturday Night.""The film combines blunt, rollicking observations on lifethe kind favored by black comedianswith the sort of fabulous narrative that has always been a staple of American comedy, from today's Woody Allen back through silent comedy to frontier literature.Until recently true black comedy (not to be confused with black humor) has been something of an unknown frontier for most Americans, who didn't have access to Harlem's Apollo Theater, Moms Mabley. Redd Foxx and the other headliners. Today, of course, Moms, Redd and the others are television headliners,"" and it's now apparent that a lot of the comedy of Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll (Amos and Andy) was a good deal more witty and accurate than it was fashionable to admit in the nineteen-fifties and sixties.""Uptown Saturday Night"" is an exuberant black joke that utilizes many of the stereotypical attitudes that only black writers, directors and actors can decently get away with. You've never seen so much eye-popping fear and unwarranted braggadocio used in the service of laughs. Yet the result is not a put-down comedy but a cheerful jape that has the effect of liberating all of us from our hangups.""Uptown Saturday Night,"" once it gets started (and that takes a bit of time), is abbut a pair of stupendously illequipped innocents, Steve Jackson (Poitier), a factory worker, and Wardell Franklin (Bill Cosby), a taxi driver, who set out to recover a winning lottery ticket contained in a wallet stolen during the pairs one and only visit to a fancy black after-hours club.The course of their search takes them through a gallery of rogues, dead-beats and affable con-artists: Sharp Eye Washington (Richard Pryor), a down-at-the-heels, doublecrossing private detective who takes their money and runs; Congressman Lincoln (Roscoe Lee Browne), the sort of phony, black-is-beautiful politician who wears Brooks Brothers suits in the privacy of his home; Silky Slim (Calvin Lockhart), a gang boss whose mythic nonchalance is matched only by his greed; The Reverend (Flip Wilson), a rousing orator who almost stops the film with a sermon about loose lips that not only can sink ships but also can get husbands into a peck of troubles.All of these performances are marvelously funny in their short takes, while Mr. Cosby is particularly good as the more skeptical of the two amateur sleuths. Mr. Poitier's intelligence and taste are most noticeable in the film's casting, in the leeway he gives his actors, and in his ability at times to make himself seem physically small and downright intimidated. For a man of his stature, that cannot be easy.The title of the film refers to neither a time nor a place (the setting seems to be Los Angeles, where, as far as I know, there is no uptown). It defines, instead, a film faritasy in which fun needn't have boring consequences, in which gangsters shoot it out without anyone's getting bloodied up, and in which it's possible to have a high old time without fear of a hangover.",1974-06-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Gravy Train,' American Style--Almost","This continues to be the year for romance between heterosexual males. ""The Gravy Train,"" which opened yesterday at the Beekman and Forum Theaters, focuses on a pair of brothers who are so devoted to each other that there has to be a scene in a massage parlor to show that they have any use for women.Two West Virginia coal miners (Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest) quit the jobs they loathe to make their fortunes through armed robbery. (Since they hate their factory as well as the work itself, it would have been interesting if their mutinous feelings had been further developed.) They're soon betrayed by their fellow hoods, and the battles within the small gang become the bulk of the picture.There are some substantial intentions here  above all, the effort to make a very American movie, to reflect the native condition. These rebellious workingmen also detest cops, though they're hardly liberal, and the film is sprinkled with racial hatreds.Throughout, there's too much moralizing about materialism: It's obvious that the greedy brothers are going to be punished for pursuing that gravy train, and much of the scrpt seems like a recipe for retribution. The chase scenes and shootouts aren't exciting, despite several falling bodies  whenever the plot sags, one of the supporting actors is deprived of all support, and he falls screaming from great heights. And, although this isn't the bloodiest movie of the month, it's exceptionally brutal  to a degree that numbs your response, makes you feel detached.Mr. Forrest, as a callow sadist who cackles whenever the bullets fly, and Mr. Keach, as a man of manic authority  whose yells of rage or pain evoke Marlon Brando howling ""Stella!""  are both fine, even though their parts don't give them much range.All in all, it's impossible to tell whom this movie was meant for. At moments, it seems to be aimed at mid-America. Yet that audience is sneered at when the brothers are caricatured as hicks in a swank city restaurant: It's supposed to be hilarious when they can't pronounce filet mignon or don't know what scampi are.Meanwhile, the preachiness of the script won't beguile those who like money or possessions; although this is meant to be an action movie, it comes off as an Awful Warning to the young men of America.",1974-06-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:Feminism Is Defended in 'Free Woman',"At the Paris Theater, an uncommonly engrossing and wise new German movie, ""A Free Woman,"" records the losing battle a divorced woman in her thirties fights in Munich to attain belated self-fulfillment. The die is cast in a briskly impersonal society geared to male dominance and early training for career women. This attractive, capable young woman, needing love and encouragement, determinedly sidesteps her former slot of housewife, studies voice and dance, takes on subordinate jobs and painfully maneuvers with her former husband (a cold fish who shrewdly remarries) for child custody.All this is quietly and beautifully projected by an unobtrusive camera and stunningly personified by the feeling, low-key performance of Margarethe von Trotta in the central role. The blond star also happens to be the wife of the gifted director, Volker Schlondorff, as well as his co-screen writer.They and the other performers and contributors have forged a fine, thoughtful and stimulating film that observantly mirrors a human condition, the traditional subordination of women with truthful, biting irony.

us,Screen: Politics and Sex,"Sexual hypocrisies and political dilemmas rarely flow smoothly onto the screen. But Lina Wertmuller excels in conveying both, in ""The Seduction of Mimi,"" which was made before her ""Love and Anarchy."" Her films are deeply political, and her characters dwell in realms where politics cannot be escaped  whether in Mussolini's Italy or modern Sicily. ""Mimi,"" a furious farce that won her the best-director award at Cannes in 1972, concerns a young laborer who lurches between the local Mafia and the Communists  when all he really wants is a personal life. The movie opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse.Mimi refuses to vote for the Mafia's candidate in his town's elections, hence he loses his job. He believes in the rights of working people, yet he makes a half-baked Communist because he's eager to earn well, to provide for his child. Meanwhile, he shuns the wife who displeases him in bed and falls violently in love elsewhere. He thinks of himself as ""a civilized man."" But when his neglected wife cuckolds him, all his energies surge into plotting vengeance against her lover  an obsession that has horrendous consequences for Mimi and puts him again at the mercy of the Mafia.In Mimi, Miss Wertmuller has created a sympathetic character who's also capable of barbarity, a likable person who can (and does) behave like a monster. It's her talent to be honest about cruelty; she also specializes in vulnerable people. Of course, the double standards of Sicily are stressed: a man is admired for having a mistress, yet he goes berserk when his wife hits the hay with another man; at the same time, none of his male friends would marry a divorced woman. Throughout, the bitterness is shot with comedy, while the macho code of revenge appears as a disease, and lunacies are committed in the name of ""honor.""Although Miss Wertmuller emphasizes that women are steadily humiliated in Sicilian society  while showing that men are also victims of their country's traditions  her own feminism seems inconsistent at moments. Some of her scenes and characters embody strictly male fantasies  such as the titillating fight between two prostitutes in ""Love and Anarchy,"" or the transformation of Mimi's girlfriend from a gutsy, independent person into an ideally patient, faithful, adoring handmaiden. And there's a passage of searing brutality when Mimi seduces the fat, aging wife of his own wife's lover. His disgust at the grotesque body  which is filmed from angles that make it all the uglier  makes you wonder if the director occasionally relishes the degradation of other women.But whatever Miss Wertmuller's commitments, ""Mimi"" is one of the best films of this season. And it's far more substantial than ""Love and Anarchy""  a movie that did absorb and touch me, even though I hardly believed a moment of it. (There, the insistence on love at first sight and the oozing innocence of the lovers seemed too artificial to swallow. Yet the absurd romanticism was enjoyable as well.) sistence on love at first sightIn both of the Wertmuller movies, the film maker's harsh judgments of people emerge in a style that's visually delectable. As Mimi, Giancarlo Giannini runs a range of moods from misery to delight or defiance and surpasses his performance in the other picture; a number of the same actresses (especially Elena Fiore and Mariangela Melato) are splendid. ""Love and Anarchy"" appears as the more commercial work: the splashy sex scenes sometimes seem like an apology for the political discussion. But in ""Mimi,"" politics and sex are so well balanced that all the raw emotions and the devastating jokes ring true.",1974-06-19T05:00:00+0000

We see him in a variety of settings around the world, rambling and philosophizing about energy (he was, as he does not hesitate to remind us, way ahead of the bandwagon on that question), television, architecture, democracy, mathematics, and social problems.There is some gibberish, like Mr. Fuller's suggestion that housing problems could be solved by finding something else for the middle-class to do and then moving the poor into skyscraper office buildings, and much that makes great sense, like his explanation of his work as ""not trying to imitate nature, just trying to find the principles she's using.""The most fascinating sections of the film are those that relate to Mr. Fuller's actual built work  his famous geodesic domes, his ""Dymaxion"" house and car of the nineteen-twenties, indications that he was far more serious about the implications of technology than the early modern architects of the period who talked about a machine-age architecture, but built essentially traditional buildings.The film will be shown at noon and midnight tomorrow and Saturday, and at 10 o'clock Sunday mornings for an indefinite period at the First Avenue Screening Room at 61st Street.",1974-06-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Segal Heads the Cast of 'Terminal Man':The Cast,"The oops-sorry school of medicine is featured in ""The Terminal Man,"" where the psychosurgery intended to make brain-damaged George Segal less violent only serves to make him more so. With a headful of wires and a tiny computer planted in his neck, he runs amok on the conviction that machines are taking over the world. But since the surgeon who operated on his brain is the kind of person whom you wouldn't allow to trim your nails, let alone cut your hair, Mr. Segal's mistrust of science seems quite rational. Based on Michael Crichton's novel, the movie was written, directed, and produced by Mike Hodges; it opened yesterday at Loews State and Tower East.The picture moves as slowly as a glacieran image that's reinforced by the repetitive shots of long, white hospital corridors, white bathrooms and home dcorin fact, it's a white-on-white movie. There's no suspense; the only frightening moments occur when you fear it may last forever, especially during the seemingly endless operation and an interminable manhunt. It's also a bit corrupting for the viewer, since the acting style is so muted that you start longing for a dash of violencethough when it comes, the camera slights the victim, and Mr. Segal mainly succeeds in ruining a perfectly good waterbed.George Segal's resilience, humor, and versatility have redeemed quite a few bad scripts. But this role gives him little chance to act, beyond making like a zombie and rolling his eyeballs back (there's that touch of white again). Still, it's rather refreshing when his bandaged head is covered by a blond wig that pays distinct homage to Harpo Marx.While this movie seems unsalvageable, it might have had some punch if we'd been told more about the Segal character's past, before his operation. Meanwhile, Joan Hackett's talents are wasted as a doctor who's merely required to look patient or perturbedalthough she is permitted an occasional worried smile. And a clumsy attempt to cash in on the shower scene in ""Psycho"" stresses the poverty of invention that withers this whole nonthriller.",1974-06-20T05:00:00+0000

As the book proceeds, it becomes clear that she believes absolutely in such a possibility. But in Flying it is not mere justification that Millett seeks. She is after absolution as well, empathy, approval and admiration, and her demanding neediness hounds the reader from the beginning to the end of this marathon essay in selfabsorption. She knows quite well what she is doing. There are few likely hostile thoughts about her work that have not been anticipated by the author. An arm raised to send Flying in flight across the room may be arrested by a sudden aside from Millett announcing disturbing visions of disgusted reader throwing the book on the floor.

us,"The King of Porn, ah-Corn:The King of Porn, ah-Corn","THE sharp, cheerlessly reassuring smell of disinfectant seeped through the balcony of the World the other afternoon. A half-dozen men, smokers all, sat there singly, trying to ignore both the smell, as depressing to the erotic instinct as a stop watch, and the loud conversation from the theater lobby. Several employes were bent on discussing coffee breaks or some other subject of equal importance, which made the screen dialogue difficult to understand. I very much wanted to hear. Not only had I paid five dollars to pass through a turnstile to get in, but I was anxious to see ""Memories Within Miss Aggie,"" a movie that one critic has described as being ""rich with intimations of 'Psycho,' and 'Images' and Faulkner,"" and whose director, Gerard Damiano, a former hairdresser and X-ray, technician, has been called the Ingmar Bergman of porn.That last must have been a typo. Corn is more like it.On the screen a small, intensely yellow-haired young woman and a young man of no evident passions frolic through the snow in a wildly unconvincing mime of rural innocence. The woman's pencil-thin eyebrows suggest an easier access to tweezers and urban fashion than provided for in the screenplay, but that could be dramatic license. The couple giggle, roll about in the drifts and toss snowballs at each other, though neither is very good. Each throws in the cautious underhand manner of the rookie pitcher on a team of Brownies. Finally the young man and the young woman fall into each other's arms, exhausted, prompting the following bit of Ingmar Bergman dialogue, spoken in ersatz Ethan Frome accents:She: ""I feel funny.""He: ""I do too.""She: ""I wonder why.""He: ""Being close, mebbee.""She: ""I feel funny.""Which, perhaps because it's where they began, leads them to an empty house where they take off their clothes and, in the words of still another critic, perform sex ""with feeling.""As a matter of fact, feeling is one of the things that is conspicuously absent in the porn parts of ""Memories Within Miss Aggie.""The actors work earnestly enough, but they don't seem to be interested. Even Harry Reems, the supporting star of Damiano's ""Deep Throat"" and ""The Devil in Miss Jones,"" seems to be tiring. This may be why he doubled as production manager on this new film and is listed as Herb Streicher in the credits, which may or may not be his real name. His fatigue may also have prompted him to wear the fake moustache he does in ""Memories Within Miss Aggie,"" as if he didn't want to be recognized. However, pasting a moustache on Harry Reems is like trying to disguise a camel by making him wear galoshes.""Memories,"" in one of its earlier weeks at the World Theater, was reported by Variety to be the second highest grossing picture in New York, topped only by ""Mame"" at Radio City Music Hall. This is depressing news for anyone seriously interested in the fate of movies, or even seriously interested in the liberation of pornography.""Memories Within Miss Aggie"" is an overcooked, guilt-stuffed cabbage of a movie, which, like ""The Devil in Miss Jones,"" pretends to seriousness through its synthetically solemn framing device.Miss Aggie (Deborah Ashira), a tall gaunt woman whose makeup isn't quite good enough to convince me she's the old lady she's supposed to be, wanders around her farmhouse in what I take to be upstate New York. The snowy landscape outside is photographed adequately by Harry Flecks, and I suspect it's the existence of the snow, not any Nykvist-like talent on the part of the cameraman that makes people compare Damiano to Bergman.Aggie has lived alone too long, as she tells us several more times than is necessary if we're over the age of 21 or even 6. She moves about the house grumpily, talking to a portly New York actor (Patrick Farrelly), who's presented as being a handyman but who just sits by the stove all day.Aggie has troubled memories of having done something ""bad"" when she was younger. When she thinks about it hard enough we, the audience, are treated to her fantasies, three in all, each with a different New York porn queen masquerading as Aggie's vision of herself.In the first one, in which the very worldly, very yellow-haired Aggie is supposedly deflowered, Aggie is played by Kim Pope. In the second fantasy, Aggie is played by an actress who looks so butch that only wide-angle close-ups can testify to the fact that she's not really Holly Woodlawn. In the third fantasy, and the only one that has a suspicion of humor or erotic style, Aggie (Darby Lloyd Rains) sees herself in an old-fashioned, turn-of-the-century bordello.When Aggie has gotten through her three fantasies, which are probably all that the budget would allow, Damiano lets us in on a secret that we could have been let in on at any earlier point in the film. That isare you readythat none of these things really happened, and that Miss Aggie, as crazy as a bedbug, put a carving knife through the skull of the man whose body she still keeps by the kitchen stove.Damiano, I'm afraid, is no Hitchcock, no Polanski, no Faulkner. He's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill moviegoer and sometime reader who doesn't hesitate to lift the cast-offs, the remnants, of other people's ideas, which are evidently all he is capable of lifting.It is significant that the only scene in the film that has any impact is the murder scene, not because it's well done but because the violence seems cruel to a much greater degree than any of the sex scenes have seemed erotic.Damiano's approach to sex is, if anything, anti-erotic, from Linda Lovelace's grotesque, nose-drooling accomplishments in ""Deep Throat,"" to the emphasis on guilt and repression in both ""Miss Jones"" and ""Aggie.""Although I hope I've an open mind on the subject, I think it's quite likely that there is no such thing as good pornography. If it's good, then it's not pornographic, Which is not quite the same thing as saying there isn't high class pornography. Some of the films made by the Mitchell Brothers in San Francisco, including ""Behind The Green Door,"" have a kind of slickness about themgood looking people and a lot of smooth, swoopy camera movements. However, these things are to serious movies what Andre Kostelanetz's arrangements are to serious music. In Damiano's case let's not get carried away and so confused by drabness that we start calling his ugly little movies art.If the man seems to have hit on a successful thing, it may well be because many people in his audience feel freer to enjoy the pure porn interludes if they're wrapped in a dreary moral fable with all of the psychological depth of a True Romance story.To a greater or lesser extent, most Americans are puritans, and from the evidence of his three most successful films, Damiano is one of the fiercest. Sex is bad. Sex is dirty. It is something to be disinfected, one way and another. If Damiano had written ""The Scarlet Letter,"" you can bet that Hester Prynne would have gone just as looney as poor old Rev. Dimmesdaleand died an even worse death.

It is indeed wild, and often hilarious. But much of it is blandly dull.The movie that opened here yesterday at the East-side Cinema is an outgrowth of a local theater ""happening"" five years ago. Audiences and reviewers acclaimed a package of video-taped satirical skits devised by two bright young men, Ken Shapiro and Lane Sarasohn that was beamed by several monitors in a small showcase.But ""The Groove Tube"" must have been infinitely funnier and certainly fresher in its original proportion, beamed from a home-screen exactly the size of its target. Now, bowdlerized and stretched out on a large, movie-house screen, the joke wears thin.Some of it is funny indeed, such as a kiddie show with a host-clown reading from ""Fanny Hill."" A methodical warning against venereal disease is outrageously funny. And so is a punctiliously scathing wrap-up of a typical, network newscast.But the torrent of ""commercials"" gets tiresome, especially one product extolling  and showing  human excrement. A ""hitchhiker"" prologue is flat, so are a ""sex olympics"" bit and several others.Mr. Shapiro, most prominently, and Mr. Sarasohn are also in the cast that includes Richard Belzer, Chevy Chase, Mary Mendham, Bill Kemmill and others.It's too bad ""The Groove Tube"" had to go Hollywood, or at least Wagnerian.

us,"Film: Streisand in 'For Pete's Sake':The Cast 'Truck Turner,' a Barrage of Shootouts The Cast","Some of the Brooklyn locations in ""For Pete's Sake"" are recognizably Borough Hall, Fourth Avenue, Grand Army Plaza and Prospect Park, while some are recognizably mock-ups built on a Hollywood backlot. It doesn't make any difference, however.""For Pete's Sake,"" a movie put together to honor its star, Barbra Streisand, is an often boisterously funny old-time farce. Its interest is not the truth that is a reflection of reality but an arm-twisting, gag-stuffed exaggeration of it. Or sometimes the method is diminution. When a bomb explodes to demolish an entire building, it's the equivalent of a hot foot in our dreary world.The movie opened yesterday at the new Astor Plaza, Orpheum and Columbia 2 Theaters.The story is about a young Brooklyn taxi driver named Pete (Michael Sarrazin) and mostly about his wife, Henrietta (Miss Streisand), nick-named Henry, a smart-mouthed, brassy girl whose confidence in herself is always unwarranted. When Pete decides he wants to go back to college to get his degree, Henry borrows $3,000 from a Mafia loan shark to invest in pork-belly futures, thus to finance their future.From the Mafia, Henry's downward path leads her to a more or less enforced membership in a call-girl operation, which proves short-lived when she accidentally breaks the nose of her first client, and finally to fronting for a gang of contemporary cattle rustlers. The latter provides the opportunity for one of the picture's most spectacular gags, the sort that is funny because of its predictability, not in spite of it.Without apology, Stanley Shapiro and Maurice Richlin, who wrote the screenplay, and Peter Yates, who directed it, make use of the most ancient devices of farce: outlandish disguises, sudden reversals in fortune, pratfalls, wisecracks. Some of their material is fondly familiar; some is in raucously bad taste.How long has it been since you've seen a movie in which a man has to hide in a closet when a husband comes home early, or in which there's a lazy, ill-tempered maid? That is, one who is black? ""For Pete's Sake"" courts disaster, but most of the time manages to sidestep it.Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Richlin, who wrote some very successful nonsex comedies in the late nineteen-fifties and early sixties (""Pillow Talk,"" ""Lover, Come Back""), have the good, glib form of the best of television's situation-comedy writers. The movie may not hold together as any kind of larger comic statement, but the laughs are self-sustaining throughout.The picture is also beautifully cast in its supporting roles, with Heywood Hale Broun as a libidinuos Brooklyn judge, with Estelle Parsons as Henry's hilariously greedy, self-satisfied sister-in-law and, particularly, with Molly Picon as a motherly Brooklyn madam named Mrs. Cherry, who congratulates Henry on coming to realize that sex is, after all, a business not a pleasure.Mr. Sarrazin, like most of Miss Streisand's leading men, isn't called upon to do much more than to be present, which he does well enough. The star herself barges through the movie with a self-assurance that is very funny, because it seems always on the edge of collapse, as when she finds herself pursued by a police dog that is able to read subway signs.Miss Streisand's comedy range is narrow, like a cartoon character's, but ""For Pete's Sake"" operates almost entirely within that range. She's at her best in this kind of farce. It manages to make her aggressiveness, undisguised in films such as ""The Way We Were,"" seem more like pluck.",1974-06-27T05:00:00+0000

And it is equally obvious when this liaison turns stormy and breaks up and our harried hero enters into another relationship, but this time as a wary lover not entirely committed to his affectionate partner.Unlike the strictly pornographic exercises on view hereabouts, ""A Very Natural Thing"" is sensitive and realistic in its approach, even though the homosexual bars, the local and Fire Island beach soires and artistic couplings are not in short supply. And its Manhattan, Fire Island and Cape Cod vignettes have been captured in pastel colors that are strikingly lovely and lend a documentary effect.Robert Joel, as the sorely tried teacher who has not yet emerged from the closet for fear that it will affect his job; Curt Gareth, as his eventually disenchanted lover, and Bo White, as the new light of his life are, to borrow from the title, impressively natural in roles that easily could have become caricatures.But aside from several scenes, especially one in which Mr. White awkwardly but poignantly meets with his estranged wife and their little daughter, ""A Very Natural Thing"" is not especially moving. The succession of ecstasies, tiffs, quarrels and searchings for meanings are, despite the essential honesty, the stuff of standard, not unusual, drama.",1974-06-28T05:00:00+0000

us,"Quiet, restful, joyfuland beautiful","There is an alternative to the sharpangled aggressive houses that are ruining the natural beauty of so many beach communities. It is the organic architecture that Frank Lloyd Wright advocated more than 70 years ago. The Fire Island house on these pages, designed by Thomas L. Moore for the Kevin Corrigans, is an object lesson in this organic, environmental style. The house is nestled almost imperceptibly into its surroundings, despite the fact that the site is only 85 by 180 feet. From the Saltaire boardwalk, it is almost invisible. The Corrigans had wanted a simple house in this beach community where Mrs. Corrigan had spent summers as a child. Since they were thinking simple, they had not thought architect until they had looked through the prefabricated house catalogues and even gone so far as to ask a local builder to draw up a plan. We were skeptical of architects, Mr. Corrigan said, because the builder had told us they doubled the cost of a house. But just down the boardwalk lived Tom houses in Saltaire (one of them for his own family) that the Corrigans admired. They were impressed by the sensitive siting of the three houses and the way Mr. Moore preserved the trees and island vegetation. The Corrigans started thinking designer and Mr. Moore worked out the plan for this onestory, wideeaved pavilion with two wingsone for the Corrigans' tour teenage children and one for the parentsand lots of deck space. After the house was built, it struck me that our land had not been all that interesting. The house actually enhanced the beauty of the site, Mr. Corrigan said. Windows frame woodland views as artful as Japanese scroll paintings. Decks wind around old trees. And two neighboring houses, both in the blatant lookatme style that has become so grating, have been subdued to abstract design backdrops to the Corrigans' unobtrusive house. Mr. Moore's design, which called for stock building materials and mostly builtin furniture, enabled the 1,650squarefoot house to be brought in for less than $40,000 two years agofurnished.",1974-06-30T05:00:00+0000

But it does point to the fact that many universities, particularly those in the Ivy League, have music departments that frown on involvement in the teaching of performance.

I remember a pleasant if subdued ride called the Greyhound and another whose name escapes me that was equipped with flat cars in which one reclined while being whisked in comparative silence (it had rubber wheels) through an almostenclosed tubelike run. But the real favorite was the Fireball, a monstrous device that plunged down the first hill at speeds purporting to top. 100 miles per hour and then went into a vicious bank through a tunnel that made one feel sure decapitation was just ahead.

us,What's Doing in BUENOS AIRES,"TWO WORLDSThe most striking aspect of Buenos Aires is the lingering aristocratic flavor of the wellkept parks, broad avenues, modern highrise apartment buildings and older Frenchstyle mansions in the Barrio Norte; literally the Northern Neighborhood. In contrast, south of the city center there is La Boca, the Little Italy section pressing against the harbor on the River Plate. Here the working class lives and works along cobblestoned streets, mingling after hours in cafes, cozy Italian restaurants and raunchy bars. The inhabitants' colloquial Spanish heavily laced with lunfardo, a dialect that can be traced back to the 19thcentury underworldis often difficult for other Argentines to understand. But wherever visitors wander, be it Norte, La Boca or any other section of this huge city of almost three million people, they'll find that the streets are safe at all hours. The climate is mild and the seasons are reversed; winter begins in June and summer in December. But it seldom freezes and never snows. The high temperatures in July and August areRESTAURANTS  As part of its policy to promote meat exports, the Argentine Government does not permit the sale of beef in Buenos Aires restaurants during the first two weeks of everytmonth. But when beef is available. La Cabana at Entre Rios 454 is still the best. For $10 a couple can enjoy charcoalbroiled steak or mixed grill, a side dish and a good red wine. Possibly the finest Continental food in town is served at the Claridge Hotel's restaurant at Tucuman 535, where the bill for two will come close to $20.. Excellent Argentine provincial dishes and good folk music (not tango) are available at El Chaleco Colorado at Cochabamba 240 in the San Telmo district. The price there, including wine, is about $8 a head. For a tasty lunch try any of the small restaurants on the Costanera, the parklined avenue along the River Plate. These are simple places, with picture windows facing the river. Cost, with wine:",1974-06-30T05:00:00+0000
us,Book Ends,"Rule Book. Howto books being popular these days what about a compendium of how to play over 400 sports? Consider it done sports fans. It's called Rules of the Game and will be published in October as the joint venture of a New Yorkbased publishing service called Two Continents, a London publisher of books for the American market called Paddington Press and another London editorialdesign firm called The Diagram Group. Rules of the Game was conceived by The Diagram Group, which had heretofore specialized in book graphics but hankered after doing complete books. A book on how to play all the world's major competitive games was one project they had simmering on the back burner. The hitch was, as it usually is, money, so now enter Paddington Press. This was founded about two years ago by John and Janet Marqusee, two Americans who fled the United States with their seven children for the supposed ampler amenities of London. The Marqusees and The Diagram Group got together and the Rules of the Game project came alive. A team of editorial people was formed under Ruth Midgley, the 28yearold managing editor, and they began collating the material collected by correspondence with sports committees the world over, representing over 2,000 replies from 21 countries. The task was to compress and simplify (and sometimes translate) pages and pages of tediously detailed rule books. The result will be several pages of simplified explanation of each sport (some sports require one page, some as many as six), accompanied by illustrations of players in action. Asked what was the most complicated sport, Miss Midgley readily replied, Ice hockey. The only sport that did not have any written rules turned out to be that old pub standby, darts; Miss Midgley's team codified the rules gleaned from oral tradition and received the Imprimatur of the sport's adepts in England. The book includes all those exotic Olympic sports such as whitewater canoeing, as well as dorfball (a Dutch basketballtype game which requires teams made up of six men awl six women), canoe polo, kendo and sleddog, pigeon and kayak racing. The next link in the publishing chain was Two Continents, a publishing service rather than a publisher, which takes a book in any stage from MS. to final book and produces, distributes, publicizes, handles accounts, etc.in short what a publisher does, except that the author pays the costs, plus an administrative fee, and receives something like 70 per cent of the monetary returns, plus all subsidiaryrights money. Two Continents, founded by Leonard Shatzkin, a veteran sales and production man, performs the bulk of its work for foreign publishers who want to publish in the United States or paperback publishers wishing to bring out a hardcover edition of an original title. Rules of the Game has a 100,000copy first printing, 30,000 of which has already been ordered for Australia.",1974-06-30T05:00:00+0000
