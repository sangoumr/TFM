The French director Claire Denis is known for making independent movies that tell intimate, personal stories. But on paper, her first English-language film, High Life, doesnt necessarily shout intimate. Its a sci-fi movie, for one thing, and it accordingly takes place in about the most vast setting possible: space. Robert Pattinson stars as Monte, a young man who has agreed to participate in an extraterrestrial mission in order to avoid the death penalty. Hes traveling on a spaceship as part of a small criminal crew, bound for a black hole in deep space. Also on the ship is a troubled doctor played by Juliette Binoche; other crew members are played by Lars Eidinger and the musician Andr Benjamin. Their mission is derailed, in part, by an unexpected birth. As is often the case in Deniss movies, High Life vibrates with low-key erotic energy that can feel exciting, a little dangerous, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. But, she added, too often the ideas here, visual and otherwise, feel haphazard  outer and inner space, Pattinsons head, sexual taboo, apocalypse now or maybe then  more like material for a vision board than a fully realized vision.",2019-10-03T12:17:43+0000

For us, though, back-to-school time is just one more reason to celebrate good books. This week, that includes books about school: Robert Pondiscios How the Other Half Learns, about a year in the life of the impressive but polarizing charter school network Success Academy, and Paul Toughs The Years That Matter Most, looking at college through the lens of a class system that reinforces its own rigid hierarchy. Theres also Samantha Powers memoir, The Education of an Idealist, which is less about school than about Powers on-the-job evolution as President Obamas ambassador to the United Nations. Two books this week tackle prejudice head-on  Ibram X. Kendis How to Be an Antiracist and Bari Weisss How to Fight Anti-Semitism  while Corey Robins The Enigma of Clarence Thomas upends some conventional wisdom about the Supreme Court justice. Finally, in fiction, we recommend new novels from some old favorites: Ann Patchett, Jacqueline Woodson and the British master Andrew Miller.

Still, he continues to make much of his work outside its bounds. While he produces most of his preparatory drawings in Berlin, his primary site of creation has remained in Westbury, a suburb of Johannesburg. There, using the plastered concrete wall of a vacant building as his canvas, he makes fleeting paintings (a shoal of small geometric shapes for the 2012 series School of Fish, a spiral staircase for the 2017 work Principle of Hope), and invites a performer wearing a mask  oftentimes the dancer Kevin Narain, a collaborator of eight years  to interact with the work, contorting his body to echo its shapes. He captures the dancers actions in a sequence of photographs and then scrubs the wall clean in less than 24 hours (although he leaves the vacant building as he found it, he also gives its owner a bottle of whiskey whenever hes in town). For Rhode, the ephemerality of the movements and the reactionary nature of graffiti art underline the overlooked poverty and injustice permeating urban slums in cities; often he will work with more than a dozen local collaborators on a single piece. My community are my studio assistants, he says.",2019-10-03T21:59:17+0000

The seventh season kicks off Friday, and picks up from there.

us,"In Berlin, a Creative Paradise Thats Easiest to Reach by Boat","Thirty years ago, when the Berlin Wall came down, the city was left with huge swaths of empty buildings in the former East: old German Democratic Republic embassies and factory complexes, some still riddled with toxic waste. It was both a daunting and heady opportunity for Berlin to reinvent itself and start over. Artists and musicians moved into abandoned breweries, warehouses and basements and slowly brought new life to neighborhoods like Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg and Pankow, which in turn attracted people from around the world. But now, thanks to rising rents, Berlins gentrified areas have become too expensive for many of its creative residents, and people have begun to move to farther-flung corners of the city. Three such neighborhoods are the historically industrial areas of Treptow-Kpenick, Rummelsburg and Oberschneweide, 10 or so miles southeast of the city center, where some of Berlins most pioneering artists now occupy a string of former industrial buildings along the Spree River. It is in Oberschneweide, too, that the Berlin gallerist Johann Knig, who represents several artists who have moved their studios to the area, is currently negotiating to take over and revive an old cable factory that will host artist studios and residencies. Although the areas landscape may look post-apocalyptic, with its giant weeds and empty power plants, strangely, the future here can seem positively Arcadian: Real estate is still cheap enough that artists are able to buy, rather than rent, their spaces. Here, four artists discuss how their work is shaped by the Spree.",2019-10-07T21:40:17+0000

Star-struck by his subject, Warhol offered Dylan a painting: a 1963 silk-screened portrait of Elvis Presley, of whom Dylan once said, Hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail. (The portrait, ironically, is taken from a publicity still of Elvis from the Western film Flaming Star, in which he looks very sheriff-like.) Dylan accepted the painting  but was then faced with the problem of maneuvering the nearly seven-foot-long canvas into his station wagon. Finally, he tied it to the roof with the help of his friend, the filmmaker Barbara Rubin. Later, when the artist asked Dylan about the painting, the musician admitted that hed given it to his manager. But if you gave me another one, Andy, I wouldnt make that mistake again, Dylan reportedly said. Only later did Warhol find out that Dylan had traded the canvas for a sofa. The painting now hangs in New Yorks Museum of Modern Art. The last so-called Ferus Type Elvis to appear at auction  Warhol made 23 of them in total  was sold at Christies for $53 million in May.

It denies basic human rights to all of its nearly 1.4 billion citizens. There is no freedom of speech, thought, assembly, religion, movement or any semblance of political liberty in China. Under Xi Jinping, president for life, the Communist Party of China has built the most technologically sophisticated repression machine the world has ever seen. In Xinjiang, in Western China, the government is using technology to mount a cultural genocide against the Muslim Uighur minority that is even more total than the one it carried out in Tibet. Human rights experts say that more than a million people are being held in detention camps in Xinjiang, two million more are in forced re-education, and everyone else is invasively surveilled via ubiquitous cameras, artificial intelligence and other high-tech means.",2019-10-09T20:46:52+0000

But a lesser-known, more local handle  Smallwaukee  may best capture the personality of this Wisconsin city of 600,000, which can feel like a small town in big-city clothing, embodying the advantages of both. The fortunes of the Bucks and Brewers are followed in unpretentious taverns that wouldnt feel out of place on a rural crossroads, and traditional meat-and-potato eateries are as patronized as the latest farm-to-table restaurant. The sleek new Hop streetcar line can take you to the Milwaukee Public Market, with its array of local foodstuffs, or within walking distance of the Santiago Calatrava-designed Milwaukee Art Museum, one of the most beautiful repositories of art in the world. Smallwaukee will grow very large indeed next July when the Democratic National Convention descends upon the city, with downtowns new Fiserv Forum as its epicenter. The conventions choice is sneakily apt. Terms like progressivism and democratic socialism, which add crackle and spark to todays national political conversation, are not academic concepts here.

Less common, though, is the layout of the couples building; to reach the home of Gohar, a Cairo-born artist, and Sosa, a Barcelona-born graphic designer and publisher who co-founded the interiors magazine Apartamento, you must first enter a former tenement built in the mid-19th century on a now-bustling stretch of Spring Street, just west of the Bowery, then walk down a narrow, dimly lit hallway that opens into a 400-square-foot courtyard densely planted with laurel and vivid green birch trees. At the opposite end, down a leaf-strewn brick path, youll find a four-story red brick structure. Dating to that same period, it is one of New Yorks so-called backhouses, the smaller residences that landlords erected in the 19th century behind the cover of larger buildings to increase rent revenue. Despite its origins, the building, which now has five units, is calm and oasis-like.

us,An Artist Who Works to Lana Del Rey and the Hum of Cable News,"Jacolby Satterwhite has spent the past decade making highly wrought digitally animated science-fiction worlds and irreverent modern dance pieces that draw on vogueing and martial arts. But he considers his two current shows, in New York and Philadelphia, to be the final draft, conceptually, of what I was trying to say for years. While Satterwhite has long been known as an art-world generalist, his fall exhibitions show him at his most direct. At Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, the exhibition Youre at Home brings together his digitally animated video series Birds in Paradise (2017-19), in which folkloric motifs and symbols of American consumerism tumble into a video-game world, and his 3D-printed objects, such as coin purses and jewelry boxes, based on drawings made by his mother, Patricia Satterwhite, before her death in 2016. Meanwhile, at the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, the show Room for Living features a group of works Satterwhite developed during his recently completed two-year residency at the museum. They include figurative sculptures inspired by virtual objects from his video series Reifying Desire (2011-14), in which Satterwhites own digitally animated avatar navigates a world where his mothers renderings of household items are realized. The residency has been a homecoming of sorts for the artist, who obtained his M.F.A. in the city in 2010 before moving to New York, where he broke through with his virtual and live-action performances at the Studio Museum in Harlem and the 2014 Whitney Biennial.",2019-10-10T22:01:20+0000

The ability to tell crossover stories is just one aspect of this seriess success. To keep longtime fans happy, the episodes are peppered with references from the comic books  adversaries with names like Deathstroke and Count Vertigo  but not so many as to confuse viewers who might not know the source material, Joe Rhodes wrote in The New York Times. But the time has come for Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) to hang up his bow. As the show enters its eighth and final season, Queen has left his home of Star City to protect the multiverse from impending crisis. ",2019-10-15T05:00:06+0000

The day I arrived, I was struck by how many American accents I heard and how many selfie sticks jutted out onto the narrow sidewalks near the canals in the Nine Streets. Nothing made tourists more visible than their fervent Instagramming and ever-present iPhones. Jogging in the Vondelpark, I saw a tourist crash a bike while videoblogging. From a hotel lobby on Keizersgracht, I watched someone climb onto a locked bike near the canal, take a photo on it and then go about her afternoon. Ask a local about the tourism in Amsterdam, and youre likely to receive an eye roll and a comment about how its out of control, as one cafe owner told me during my first week there. Last year, the city attracted almost 20 million visitors, but there are fewer than one million residents. In December, locals became so frustrated by tourist congestion that the city removed the I amsterdam sign near the Rijksmuseum, which reportedly generated upward of 6,000 photographs per day. Many of these photos very likely ended up on Instagram, where the hashtag #iamsterdam has been used 1.54 million times and counting.",2019-10-15T09:00:03+0000

One neighbor keeps a coop of racing pigeons  homing birds trained to fly in timed competitions (a bygone pastime of old Brooklyn)  on the roof, and when one of the buildings older tenants died about 15 years ago, it was revealed that she had painted every surface of her small apartment to resemble a traditional Polish dacha, complete with trompe loeil wooden shutters and a mural of dancing deer.",2019-10-18T17:00:17+0000

But while the citys food and wine scenes continue to flourish, its hotel options have remained limited. The opening of Dorp, a new hotel in the historic Bo-Kaap neighborhood in the city center, known for its colorful Cape Dutch and Georgian style houses, is set to change that. Conceived by the hotelier and clothing designer Gail Behr, who opened the plush old-world Grand Hotel in the South African seaside town of Plettenberg Bay in 2004, the intimate 30-room property is more of a club than a traditional hotel. Its old-fashioned without being cloyingly personal and intrusive, Behr says. Constructed from scratch with the help of the local designer Gregory Mellor, the building was devised to fit antique wooden doors, windows and slatted shutters that the team sourced from as far as India and Egypt. The interior  filled with oversize printed couches, antique cabinets, old books, wood-burning fireplaces and claw-foot bathtubs  was decorated by Behr herself. I was determined not to take the design too seriously, she says. The surrounding mountains cannot be competed with! Indeed, located on the gently sloping base of Signal Hill, Dorp has astonishing views of Table Mountain and the citys twinkling lights. One of the best places to enjoy the vista is the hotels rambling garden, created by the Cape Town-based landscape designer Leon Kluge and planted with ancient mission olive trees, gnarled guava trees and purple poppies. The garden is the prettiest place on earth, with millions of butterflies, dwarf Cape chameleons, birds and bees, Behr says. A light-filled cafe on the ground floor serves unfussy dishes like homemade scones, grilled cheese sandwiches and slow-roasted local lamb. But perhaps Behrs favorite space is the salon, a great homey living room brimming with couches covered in pink velvet and a playful dinosaur-printed toile by the British interiors brand House of Hackney, where she encourages guests to mingle. Already, she says, it is filled with interesting people collaborating  and playing a poker game at the same time. dorp.co.za  MARY HOLLAND",2019-10-18T21:09:41+0000

When the 12-part comic book series Watchmen came out in 1986 and 1987, it upended the traditional idea of what a superhero could be. In looking back at that comic for The New York Times, Adam Sternbergh wrote that Watchmen felt entirely new, given it meant considering heroes as fallible and complex humans, prone to the array of ugly and shameful emotions recognizable from the real world. Now, with superhero stories dominating the box office, this new series from the Lost and The Leftovers creator Damon Lindelof offers a new take on that comic, trading the originals Cold War themes for those of white supremacy. Regina King stars as Angela Abar, who works with the police as her masked alter ego, Sister Night, while Jeremy Irons and Jean Smart play older versions of original Watchmen characters Adrian Veidt and Laurie Juspeczyk.

Petite, silver hair cut distinctively in a short bob, Wilmers had brought a copy of the latest issue  Volume 41, Number 13  to a bright back room and a desk laden with current British newspapers and magazines. On the cover of The Sun, a photo of Taylor Swift adjoined the headline Migrants 3,500-ft Plunge: Falling Jet Stowaway Lands 3ft From Sunbather. On the cover of The Times, next to a close-up of a young woman delighting in a rainbow ice pop, ran the headline Oxfam Staff Still Offering Aid for Sex, Report Claims. Wilmerss copy of the L.R.B. featured no photos of women on its cover. Instead, a painting, unblemished by text, depicting an early summer evening in London: dirty pink twilight dissolving behind a stand of trees, deep, unnatural blue overtaking the sky, two silhouetted birds coursing above overground wires.

It was our brief age of innocence during Second Battalion, Third Marines deployment to Iraq in 2006. We had been largely unscathed by the true essence of war. Roadside bombs had left marks on a few of us. Concussions caused by grenades were joked about. Shrapnel left in the fleshy tissue of camouflaged buttocks were a source of hilarity. A Marine named Gabriel Odum had been shot on his first patrol, the bullet passing through his right hand and one lung, but a few lucky centimeters away from fatal. We believed we were invincible.

The film casts Murphy as the comedian Rudy Ray Moore, who at the crest of the blaxploitation era self-financed Dolemite, a 1975 crime action movie in which he starred as a pimp out for revenge. The original movie became a cult hit. (A typical scene involves an F.B.I. agent being kicked into the trunk of a Cadillac.) The biopic charts the lead-up to and the making of that movie, with the help of an all-star cast: Tituss Burgess, Keegan-Michael Key, DaVine Joy Randolph, Craig Robinson and Wesley Snipes play some of Moores associates, and Snoop Dogg and Chris Rock each make cameos. The movie has a loose, friendly, house-party vibe, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, and is intended as a comeback vehicle for Murphy. I didnt want to just pop back up, he said in a recent interview with The Times. I wanted a funny movie to remind them that they liked me. This movie turned out so strong that I figured this is a great way to come back.",2019-10-25T05:00:12+0000

This series is based on Tom Perrottas novel Mrs. Fletcher, which was published in 2017 and tackles themes of misogyny, sexuality and female empowerment. Like the book, the limited series follows Eve Fletcher, a divorced mom (Kathryn Hahn) in her mid-40s, and her son Brendan (Jackson White), an entitled jock starting his freshman year at college, as they embark on respective journeys of sexual enlightenment. While Brendan struggles to connect with his political-minded peers and confronts conversations about consent, Eve indulges in her newfound freedom by going down an internet pornography rabbit hole. Mrs. Fletcher is a very right-now show, Margaret Lyons wrote in her review for The New York Times. Its one of many short-run half-hour dramedies about a woman entering a new phase of her life who discovers new vectors of sexuality and self-actualization while also being treated shabbily.

David Simons breakout show The Wire articulated how the lives of ordinary people are shaped by the institutions they find themselves caught up in. The Deuce, which Simon created with George Pelecanos, has a similar theme. For three seasons the series has shown how changes in the pornography industry in the United States affected the people involved in it. The shows final season, which concludes Monday, jumped  to the mid-1980s, when VHS technology made it possible for people to watch erotic films easily at home. Some of the shows characters, like Candy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who went from prostitute to pornographic film director, seem to have prospered amid these changes, while others, like Frankie (James Franco),  have clearly suffered. But for the most part the message is clear: Everyone is trying to get by in a world controlled by forces stronger than any individual. ",2019-10-28T05:00:15+0000

In his New York Times review of John Carpenters 1978 slasher film Halloween, Jason Zinoman wrote that Michael Myers isnt like other movie monsters: He never speaks and offers no hint of a motivation for his killing spree. He is not a character so much as an absence of one, an abstraction in the middle of a mundane slice of suburban life. But this take on that film, directed by the heavy metal singer Rob Zombie, upends that idea by exploring Myerss back story and unmasking his motive to kill. It follows his childhood as a socially awkward, bullied boy with a stressful home life, which fuels his rage, leading him to enact his first murderous rampage on Halloween night at just 10 years old. Hes then locked away in a mental institution and breaks out 15 years later in an attempt to reconnect with his younger sister, whos now a teenager. In his review for The New York Times, Matt Zoller Seitz wrote that the case study part of the film re-establishes Mr. Zombies status as modern American horrors most eccentric and surprising filmmaker.",2019-10-29T05:00:09+0000

The canals must be deep and wide, Meendering says: Try eight feet deep and 20 to 40 feet wide. Consider geology and its potential effects on sedimentation. Plan a route across; Bourtange has five wooden drawbridges, but theyre too heavy and dangerous to pull up. Dont expect your moat to stop swimmers not wearing armor.

us,One Photographers Exploration of the Paranormal,"On a blustery October evening inside a chapel at Green-Wood Cemetery in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, the photographer Shannon Taggart guided an audience through a series of images: a circle of hands placed atop a dimly lit table; a woman holding what appeared to be a transistor radio, listening with eyes closed; orbs flashing across a starry night sky. The photographs were from her new book, Sance, the result of her 18-year exploration of Spiritualism, the religious movement based on a belief in the possibility of communication between the living and the dead that emerged from New York in the 1840s. The project, which she calls part documentary and part ghost story, comprises her own images of Lily Dale  the worlds largest Spiritualist community, founded in the mid-19th century on the shore of Cassadaga Lake in New York  along with historical photographs, narratives about her subjects and illustrated essays by the artists Tony Oursler and Andreas Fischer about the movements influence on art and culture.
