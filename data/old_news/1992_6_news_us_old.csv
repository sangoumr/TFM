us,RESULTS PLUS,"HORSE RACING Missy's Mirage Wins Again When the Shuvee Stakes for premier fillies was run at Belmont Park three weeks ago, Missy's Mirage outran Harbour Club and Versailles Treaty at a mile and one-sixteenth in a photo finish. For an encore yesterday, the same fillies competed in the $200,000 Hempstead Handicap and ran one-sixteenth of a mile more in rain and mud, and the order of finish was identical: Missy's Mirage, this time by three lengths over Harbour Club, who had a neck on Versailles Treaty. And the winner knocked three-fifths of a second off the stakes record. It was the third straight time that Missy's Mirage had beaten Versailles Treaty, and she did it by leading from start to finish on a sloppy track. The winner ran three-quarters of a mile in 1:084/5 , the mile in 1:333/5 and the mile and one-sixteenth in 1:47 flat, breaking the record for the race set in 1978 by Dottie's Doll and matched in 1988 by Personal Ensign. She paid $7.60 for $2 to win and earned $120,000. Missy's Mirage, a 4-year-old filly owned by the Middletown Stables and trained by Allen Jerkens, was ridden by Eddie Maple as she won for the fourth time in five starts this year. Versailles Treaty, owned by Cynthia Phipps and trained by Shug McGaughey, has now lost five straight close races. GOLF Glasson Takes Kemper by a Shot Bill Glasson, whose nine-year career has been marred by knee and back injuries, shot a bogey-free 68 to finish with an eight-under-par 276 after four trips over the TPC at Avenel course in Potomac, Md., to win the Kemper Open. He finished one shot better than John Daly, Ken Green, Mike Springer and Howard Twitty. Glasson won $198,000 with his fifth victory on the tour. (AP) Mucha Gets 2d Career Victory: It was a sweet homecoming for the former Michigan State golfer, Barb Mucha, yesterday. Mucha, fighting off a challenge by Dottie Mochrie, earned the second victory of her six-year L.P.G.A. career by capturing the Oldsmobile Classic in East Lansing, Mich., by one shot. Mochrie, who is now the tour's leading money-winner this year, closed with a five-under 67, but Mucha's 71 was enough to win with a 12-under 276 at Walnut Hills Golf and Country Club. (AP) Changed Fortune for O'Connor: Twelve days after surviving a helicopter crash, Ireland's Christy O'Connor Jr. finished with three birdies yesterday and then won a playoff with Zimbabwe's Tony Johnstone at the British Masters in Woburn. (AP) AUTO RACING No Gas, but Victory for Gant Harry Gant, Nascar's ageless wonder, crossed the finish line out of gas but won by nearly a full lap in yesterday's Budweiser 500 at Dover Downs International Speedway in Dover, Del. The 52-year-old Gant, who already was the oldest winner in any Winston Cup race, captured the 17th victory of his career and his first this season. Dale Earnhardt, coming off a victory a week earlier at Charlotte, ended up second. (AP) 4th Straight for Senna: Ayrton Senna won his fourth consecutive Monaco Grand Prix yesterday, ending Nigel Mansell's season-opening winning streak at five races. (AP) COLLEGE WORLD SERIES Miami Tops Fullerton State A two-run error by Fullerton State shortstop Nate Rodriguez keyed a three-run seventh inning that carried top-ranked Miami to a 4-3 victory over the fifth-ranked Titans in the second round of the College World Series at Omaha last night. Fullerton State (43-16) fell into a losers' bracket game tomorrow against Florida State (49-20). The winner of that game would face Miami on Wednesday. Florida State stayed alive on Sunday by eliminating California, 5-4. (AP) PRO FOOTBALL Sacramento Advances to World Bowl Cary Blanchard kicked a 46-yard field goal with 3:54 left to give the Sacramento Surge a 17-15 home-field victory over the Barcelona Dragons in a World League semifinal playoff game. During the Dragons' final possession, quarterback Scott Erney hit Thomas Wood for an apparent 60-yard touchdown but the play was called back for illegal motion on receiver Demetrious Davis. The Surge (9-2) will play the Orlando Thunder on Saturday in the second World Bowl in Montreal. The Thunder defeated Birmingham on Saturday night in the league's other playoff game.

In the second game, Brooks Kieschnick got the Longhorns started with a homer, then singled in an insurance run. Texas (48-16) had much success with the Sooners this season, beating them all five times they met. Kieschnick, the designated hitter-pitcher who earlier was named Division I player of the year by the American Baseball Coaches Association, hit his second homer of the series -- and his 10th of the season -- in the first inning.

us,The Smooth Move,"Moving day can be traumatic whether you are going across town or across the country. But it can be made easier by planning and by knowing the limits of a mover's services. Rates Rates for interstate moves should be fully negotiable. However, 39 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, regulate rates for moves within the state. Virtually all rates are based on weight and distance, so it may pay to get rid of large or heavy pieces. Insurance Since most homeowner policies do not cover household goods in transit, it is usually wise to accept the coverage offered by the mover. There are several options. Probably the best value is the coverage that pays the cost of replacing a damaged or lost item, after a one-time deductible of at least $250. Preparation Lessen your workload by leaving soft items like clothes inside drawers, and tape the drawers shut. Consider having the mover pack the breakables. Number all boxes, keep an inventory of their contents and give the mover a plan of the new home with the box numbers applicable to each room noted. Inventory Control Assign a family member or friend to check off each item as it is loaded onto the truck and again as it is unloaded. Prohibited Items Movers are unlikely to accept perishable foods or combustibles like cleaning fluids, paint or firewood. Valuables and irreplaceable items like jewelry, coin collections and family photos should be moved by you. Handy Box Pack a box of essentials like bed linens, favorite toys, paper plates, a coffeepot and easy-to-prepare snacks and load it onto the van last. This will help get you through the first few chaotic days. (Sources: American Movers Conference. The Relocation Report, published by Runzheimer International)",1992-06-06T05:00:00+0000

The ritual began again last week. True, White House officials acknowledged, China has not exactly been on its best behavior, having just tested a giant underground nuclear bomb, harrassed American reporters and failed to make any significant improvement in human rights. But, officials insisted, these were only signs that a ""world-class power struggle"" was under way in Beijing, with hardliners trying to sour relations between China and the United States and reformers trying to hold the line. It was incumbent on Washington, taking the long view, to support the reformers. Stuff and nonsense, said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. The President has made the same argument since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacres, and nothing has changed.

My mortgage is held by Chase Mortgage Corporation. When I called to discuss a way of reducing my monthly payments to avoid foreclosure, I was told such assistance is available only after a mortgage holder becomes delinquent. Apparently the mortgage had been sold to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and Chase must follow its rules when it comes to changes. It seems to me that since I would not qualify for a regular re-financing, the lender would be willing to do something to help me stay out of foreclosure. Is there anything I can do? . . . Terence Wall, Hillsdale, N.J. Answer: Probably not. Ken Mills, a spokesman for Chase Manhattan Bank, of which Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation is a subsidiary, said that it is not a Chase policy to wait until a mortgage holder has fallen behind in payments to assist with a loan payment adjustment.

For reasons that have more to do with his own clouded childhood than with matters of inheritance, Reisden impersonates the missing heir while secretly searching for his murderer. ""Someone killed Richard,"" he reasons. ""Now Richard wants to know why.""",1992-06-07T05:00:00+0000

This important book of photographs by Gay Block and interviews by Malka Drucker, an author of children's books, shows that these heroes share a streak of independence, as well as compassion, empathy, the ability to endure risk and an intolerance for injustice. Marion P. van Binsbergen Pritchard went to prison in Amsterdam for violating a Nazi curfew, shot and killed a Dutch policeman, smuggled Jewish children out of a German nursery and hid children, and sometimes entire families, in her basement; she saved more than 150 Jews from the Nazis. Now a 72-year-old psychoanalyst who lives in Vermont, she credits her liberal upbringing for her courage: ""I was treated with respect and consideration from the day I was born."" During the war Irene Opdyke, a nurse born in Poland in 1921, took a job as a housekeeper for a Gestapo major and hid 12 Jews in his attic and cellar. When he discovered the fugitives, she agreed to sleep with him if he kept her secret. Now living in California, she says she and her four sisters always cared for those in need and her mother ""never turned away anyone from her doorstep."" Dr. Ivan Beltrami was born in Marseilles in 1920. He joined the French Resistance in 1942 without telling anyone in his family. His older brother turned out to be the chief of another resistance network. Dr. Beltrami hid Jews in infirmaries and hospitals. He also killed Nazi collaborators, for which he says he has no regrets. His brother was arrested, tortured and almost killed, but when people congratulated him on his bravery, Dr. Beltrami recalls, their father said, ""Don't congratulate him; it was his duty!""",1992-06-07T05:00:00+0000

A1 JAPAN ON TRADE OFFENSIVE In a new strategy for confronting the United States on trade issues, an advisory Government council in Japan has turned the tables and accused the Americans of breaking a series of international rules. A1 SARAJEVO, SORROWFUL WASTELAND What is happening in Sarajevo, a European city that survived two world wars with only minor damage, is hard to grasp for many of the residents enduring it. After two months of civil war, the Bosnian capital is a skeleton of the thriving, accomplished place it was. A1 Russian rightists accuse their Government of betraying the Serbs. A6 ISRAEL REFLECTS ON 25 YEARS A historian, a writer, a lawmaker, a physicist, an Arab teacher and a citizen who braved mob violence offer thoughts as Israel marks the anniversary of the 1967 war. A10 CZECHS RIGHT, SLOVAKS LEFT News Analysis: Czechoslovakia's voters have demonstrated one of the hard truths reshaping Eastern Europe's politics. Just as the impulse for democracy once brought people together, the democratic process is now helping to split them apart. A7 NO ENVIRONMENTAL LOBBYISTS Fearing demonstrations against President Bush, the United Nations has drawn up plans to close the Earth Summit conference center to representatives of private environmental groups. A5 Mr. Bush wants to know who leaked an environmental memo. A5 CORAZON AQUINO'S LEGACY When Corazon Aquino yields the Philippine presidency, many in Manila's slums will be content to see her go. Six years after the ""people power"" revolution, the country is mired in poverty and corruption. A3 POWER STRUGGLE IN PORTUGAL Rivalry between President Soares and Prime Minister Cavaco Silva is assuming the dimension of a constitutional crisis in Portugal. A9 BLOW TO BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY In one of the most serious blows to the prestige of the royal family, the marriage of Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, was portrayed credibly as being on the rocks. A10 National A11-13, A16, B6 POLITICAL HIGH NOON IN TEXAS When President Bush and Ross Perot square off in Texas for the Presidency, it could take on elements of a barroom brawl.

(AP) ROWING Springer Wins 3d Olympic Trip Greg Springer, who once vowed never to pick up an oar again, won a third trip to the Olympics yesterday by winning the men's doubles rowing competition in the United States Olympic trials at West Windsor, N.J. Springer, who rowed in the 1984 and 1988 Games, had been involved in rifts with the United States Rowing Association over team selection and officiating. Policy changes and the chance to train with the former Soviet national coach Igor Grinko got Springer back into the sport. He and teammate Jonathan Smith were timed in 6 minutes 26.32 seconds, winning by more than 2 1/2 seconds. (AP)",1992-06-08T05:00:00+0000

us,In Their Natural Habitats,"Arnold Newman has been practicing the art and business of portrait photography for more than 50 years. Ambitious and innovative, he set his course in the early 1940's when he created ""environmental"" portraits, in which he situates his subjects in carefully ordered spaces where each element -- hat, easel or profile -- becomes crucial to the design and meaning of the whole. ARNOLD NEWMAN'S AMERICANS (National Portrait Gallery/Bulfinch/Little, Brown, cloth, $60; paper, $35) includes duotones of the 100 photographs recently acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, as well as essays by Mr. Newman and Alan Fern, the gallery's director. In his shots of some of this country's leading figures, Mr. Newman has avoided the studio and photographed his subjects in their own territory, allowing him to convey his sense of the person through his or her environment. He gives equal weight to the glass chandeliers, heavy desks, marble and other trappings of office; young John F. Kennedy looks vulnerable, framed by the weighty architecture of the Senate Office Building, while Richard M. Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson seem more aggressively in command. Scientists, composers and artists are portrayed more sympathetically, often in images echoing their work: the painter Horace Pippin, for example, is shown at the left of a West Chester, Pa., landscape in a photograph that evokes his naive style. There are only a few women in this pantheon, among them a kindly Eleanor Roosevelt, a voluptuous Marlene Dietrich and a dramatic Martha Graham -- each framed by the kinds of signifying objects that should delight social historians and semioticians.",1992-06-14T05:00:00+0000

Closely related to both the smooth fox terrier (the dog on the old RCA label) and the wire fox terrier (Asta in ""The Thin Man""). The Jack Russell is predominantly white and hence immediately distinguishable from its quarry, which it otherwise resembles in size and shape. Why? So it can negotiate the fox's terrain, then confront it in its den. A good terrier never kills (and rarely lays a paw on) a fox. Simply wouldn't be sporting. WHAT IT ISN'T: A Cavalier King Charles spaniel, a particularly effete-looking dog that in 1985 President Reagan surprised his wife, Nancy, with one of and that, along with finger bowls and Galanos dresses, came to epitomize the imperial 80's. The Jack Russell, a working dog in its native England with no particular connection to aristocracy and with as much of a taste for barn rats as for foxes, seems infinitely better suited to the anti-expectation, let's-get-that-tuffet-up-to-the-attic 90's.",1992-06-14T05:00:00+0000

But it was not until the 17th century, when so-called Castile soap became renowned, that Spain became associated with fine soaps. That soap -- pure, mild and gentle to the skin -- featured olive oil as a principal ingredient. It was long-lasting, snow white, free from impurities and had excellent antiseptic and cleansing properties. It is thought to have originated and been produced in Castile, although some accounts mention Seville as well.

I purchased the apartment as part of a condominium conversion plan five years ago and since then have seen ever-increasing city tax bills to the point where I now pay $2,500. The tax on my one room is higher than on many more valuable homes. For example, I recently read about a five-bedroom, single-family home in Forest Hills that sold for $500,000. Its annual tax bill was $2,822. A condominium apartment, which sold for $150,000, had a tax bill of $1,200 a year. Can this be correct? . . . Doris Brown, Manhattan Answer: Yes. The city's current tax laws result in wide variations in the tax bills of residences of the same value. Part of the inequity is due to the tax structuring system.",1992-06-14T05:00:00+0000

The estuarine sanctuary at the north end of the island and the state park at the south end are posted with warnings of the dangers of deer ticks and Lyme disease. Prudence Island is an extremely high risk area for Lyme Disease. Your readers should be warned. MARY BROWN LAWRENCE Summer Resident, Prudence Island, R.I. Roger Greene, Assistant to the Director of the State of Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, replies: Ms. Lawrence is correct that deer ticks are abundant on Prudence Island. However, research indicates that there are far fewer deer ticks within the well-mowed trails than in the wooded areas beside the trails. Therefore, the risk of coming into contact with deer ticks (and Lyme disease) while hiking the Prudence Island Trails is relatively low. Hikers can get to the most interesting places without ever leaving the mowed trails.",1992-06-14T05:00:00+0000

Lars Elstrup, a substitute, scored with 13 minutes left to give Denmark the victory over France, while Tomas Brolin scored a spectacular goal to lift Sweden over England. Denmark was a last-minute replacement for Yugoslavia after that country was banned from the tournament because of sanctions stemming from the civil war. The police and Swedish news media reported that more than 30 people, both English and Swedish, were arrested as youths battled with sticks, bottles, fists and feet in various parts of Stockholm following England's defeat. Four people were reported hospitalized from beatings and about 100 windows were broken. Today, the defending champion, the Netherlands, meets the World Cup holder, Germany, and the Commonwealth of Independent States faces Scotland. (AP) TENNIS Wheaton Upset by Eltingh at Manchester Third-seeded David Wheaton was upset by Jacco Eltingh of the Netherlands, who served 16 aces to beat Wheaton, 6-4, 6-4, in the second round of the Manchester grass-court tournament, a Wimbledon tune-up. Three of the aces came in the last game as Eltingh served out the match at love. Wheaton reached the Wimbledon semifinals in 1991, losing to Boris Becker. He is seeded 16th this year. ""I'll just keep on training hard the rest of the week,"" Wheaton said. ""It's going to take four or five days' hard work to get my game to where it should be."" Second-seeded Brad Gilbert coasted to a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Gary Muller. (AP) Fernandez Advances: Second-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez moved into the quarterfinals of the Eastbourne grass-court tournament with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Patricia Hy of Canada. Fernandez, ranked seventh in the world, fell behind by 1-3 in the first set but then took control, rushing the net. Lori McNeil eliminated third-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain, 6-0, 6-3, in just 53 minutes. The result was not a significant upset since McNeil is a fast-court specialist and Martinez excels on clay. Linda Harvey-Wild, who upset top-seeded Martina Navratilova on Tuesday, battled for 2 hours 19 minutes for a 3-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 victory over Larisa Savchenko-Neiland of Latvia. (AP) BOATING Frenchwoman Safe After a Capsizing Florence Arthaud, the 33-year-old French yachtswoman who was a favorite to win the solo Europe 1 Star trans-Atlantic race, capsized and was rescued at sea by a passing ship. Patricia Demoustier, Arthaud's personal assistant, said yesterday from Newport, R.I., that Arthaud was knocked unconscious Tuesday as the 60-foot trimaran, Premier 1er, turned upside down in the water. Arthaud reported that when she woke up, she found herself in the center hull cabin. ""She started shouting for her brother, and asking if there were people on board,"" Demoustier said. ""She was prepared to wait for two or three days to be rescued."" Demoustier talked yesterday by telephone to Arthaud on the Faust, the United States car-carrier vessel that picked up the French sailor within five hours of her boat's capsizing. Crew members saw her standing on the overturned hull of her boat and waving. Arthaud was sailing at 29 knots, a top speed for multihulls, when the boat flipped over. She was in 15th place in the race, which began June 7 in Plymouth, England, and was about 400 miles from the finish line in Newport. Of the 68 solo sailors who entered the race, nine have dropped out. A Frenchman, Loick Peyron, is expected to cross the finish line first by arriving today in Newport. EQUESTRIAN Matz Excels in Olympic Trials Michael Matz posted perfect rounds on both his horses yesterday at Gladstone, N.J., in the fourth of six show-jumping qualifying trials for the United States Olympic team. Matz, who leads the overall rider standing aboard Heisman with four faults and is second on Olisco with 8.5, could occupy two of the five qualifying spots for the Olympic team after the final trials today and Saturday. Matz would then qualify on only his higher-ranked horse. Anne Kursinski, a member of the 1988 silver medal team, could also place two horses among the top five. She is No. 3 aboard Top Seed with 12.5 faults and No. 5 on Cannonball with 20. Alice Debany of Bedford, N.Y., won yesterday's event in a jump-off with Jeffrey Welles, both of whom also completed faultless rounds. Matz did not compete in the jumpoff to rest his horses. Debany, riding The Natural, finished the seven-fence jumpoff course in 37.64 seconds. Welles, aboard Serengeti, crashed into a fence in the jumpoff and withdrew. ""I doubt I will make the Olympic team,"" said Debany, ranked No. 12 with 24.25 faults. Norman Dello Joio, David Raposa and Welles currently hold the other qualifying spots.",1992-06-18T05:00:00+0000

The vote appears to revive the treaty's chances of drawing more support in the 12-nation community. 1 CZECHOSLOVAKS CLOSER TO SPLIT Leaders of the Czech and Slovak regions agreed to begin preparations to split Czechoslovakia into two nations. Their regional parliaments are to make the final decisions. 3 HOPE OF AID RECEDES IN SARAJEVO Fierce fighting continued all around Sarajevo airport, dimming hopes that the United Nations will succeed in carrying out a plan to reopen the airport for a relief airlift. 5 U.N. SEEKING VIRTUAL ARMY The United Nations Secretary General says he wants as many countries as possible to make up to 1,000 troops each available on a day's notice for peace operations. 5 PALESTINIANS ARE FOREWARNED After Palestinian delegates to the Middle East peace talks embraced Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, Israel warned they would be arrested when they returned home. 2 HAITI SWEARS IN REPLACEMENT A former World Bank official was installed as President by Haiti's military-backed regime. The meeting was shunned by diplomats and supporters of the deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 3 UBZEKS COAX THEIR RAVAGED LAND Freed from the yoke of Soviet planners, independent Uzbekistan is reducing the sway of Czar Cotton and feeling its way toward a more rational use of its resources. 4 RUSSIAN RESISTS I.M.F. PRESSURE The International Monetary Fund ended a round of talks with Russia after failing to win compliance with several harsh demands for changes in its economy in return for billions in foreign loans. 4 The Fed and Russia set up an advisory group on modern banking. 4 U.S. and Russia reached an accord on the fate of a bugged embassy. 4 Boris Yeltsin was welcomed in Canada as a man of ""purpose."" 4 National 6-11 JUSTICES RULE ON NUCLEAR WASTE The Supreme Court struck down a central part of a Federal law aimed at forcing states to take responsibility for low-level radioactive waste generated within their borders. The decision was a victory for New York State, which has been unable to find a politically acceptable site for disposing of contaminated medical and industrial waste. 1 Cuomo said the ruling would put pressure on utilities. 10 CLINTON REBUTS JACKSON Governor Clinton said that he would not retract his criticism of the rap performer Sister Souljah and that if the Rev. Jesse Jackson wanted to align himself with her, ""then that's his business."" 1 Perot's offices in Dallas are a shrine to his life. 8 Perot seems headed for confrontation with a Senate panel. 8 Bush told executives he could best bring recovery. 9 APPROVAL OF DEPO-PROVERA URGED A panel of advisers to the F.D.A. recommended that the agency reverse itself and allow the marketing of the injectable contraceptive Depo-Provera. Approved for use in about 90 countries, Depo-Provera has been barred from the American market because of concerns that it may cause breast cancer in a small percentage of women. 6 The F.D.A. received worrisome reports on nicotine patches. 6 UNEMPLOYMENT BILL GAINS The Senate voted to automatically prolong unemployment benefits to the longtime jobless during periods of recession. A more expensive version of the bill has already passed in the House. The White House says President Bush will veto either version. 10 COST OF BARRING HOMOSEXUALS The Defense Department's policy excluding homosexuals from the armed forces costs the Pentagon at least $27 million a year, a Congressional study found. 6 SCIENCE PLEADS FOR COLLIDER Hoping to head off Senate agreement with a House vote to end financing of the Superconducting Supercollider, scientists said the demise of the project would be an abdication of leadership in physics. 11 VIOLENCE IN BOSTON Boston's Mayor said the unexpectedly large size of the crowd, roughly 20,000 people, was responsible for the disturbance in which 25 were injured in the area around an open-air concert. 6 Beliefs: Father's Day is here; many fathers aren't. 11 Weinberger pleaded not guilty to Iran-contra charges. 10 The crash of a Grand Canyon sightseeing plane killed 10. 11 A student was indicted on charges stemming from cheating. 11 Metropolitan Digest, 25 ARRESTS IN KIDNAPPING A married couple from rural northern New Jersey were arrested and charged with the kidnapping of Sidney J. Reso, the Exxon executive who disappeared April 29. The arrests came after officials spent two days following a convoluted trail of ransom notes. But law-enforcement officials said they had no information about the whereabouts of the 57-year-old president of Exxon International. 1 NEW WAYS TO TREAT ADDICTS Packing psychological exercises into hours usually reserved for leisure, drug seminars at places like Odyssey House in Manhattan are among a range of new approaches that experts are trying in the hope of making drug treatment cheaper and more effective. Many experts believe the ranks of drug users in the country could be thinned considerably if treatment were available for all. 1 Business Digest 35 Editorials/Op-Ed 22-23 Editorials 22 New Guido for the police.

us,Guidepost; To Help Hear the Phone,"New devices to help people with hearing problems use telephones are available from hearing-aid retailers and at some department stores and telephone-company retail outlets. Here is a sampling. ATTENTION-GETTERS An alternative to devices that make the phone ring louder is a tiny plug-in box that attaches to the phone and flashes a brilliant, pulsating light when it rings. Cost: around $30. Some new audio attchments, costing around $24, can convert the ring to a special frequency for people with high-frequency hearing loss. AMPLIFIERS New powerful volume amplifiers can make special telephones unnecessay for many people. They come in handsets that cost around $20 and plug into any phone with a standard modular receptacle. Battery-operated portable amplifiers, barely larger than a matchbox, clip or strap onto anyphone. They are about $15. THE WRITTEN WORD Fax machines that plug into phone outlets are ideal for people who can't type on normal message transmitters. The messages can be handwritten and sent to and received from any fax machine. The machines start at around $400. The phone company also offers a service called TDD, or text relay, but this requires some typing skill. TDD equipment costs $250 to $550. WHERE TO SHOP New York Telephone has a Communications Center for Disabled Customers at 204 Second Avenue (13 Street) in Manhattan; for information call (800) 482-9020 from anywhere in New York State. Information about manufacturers, distributors and special outlets elsewhere is available from (800) 332-1123, the tele-Consumer Hotline, an information service sponsored by various telephone companies and audio-aid suppliers.

Indeed, the very proliferation of books and other print-based media, so prevalent in this forest-harvesting, paper-wasting age, is held to be a sign of its feverish moribundity, the last futile gasp of a once vital form before it finally passes away forever, dead as God.",1992-06-21T05:00:00+0000
us,Prints of Tides,"No subject has inspired more exciting prints than war, and naval prints are the liveliest of all. A New York lawyer, Beverley R. Robinson, donated about 1,000 of them to the United States Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Md., before he died in 1951, forming the nucleus of a collection now numbering almost 5,000 pieces. NAVAL PRINTS FROM THE BEVERLEY R. ROBINSON COLLECTION: Volume One, 1514-1791 (United States Naval Academy Museum, Annapolis, Md. 21402-5034, $60) is the first of three projected volumes, fully illustrated, cataloguing the Robinson bequests. Sigrid Trumpy, the collection's curator, and Deborah F. Morrow-Pigg, the book's designer, have produced a handsome, sturdy slipcased volume. The dates in its title refer to battles, not to the print making, and the order of reproductions follows the same chronology; that may irritate some people, but the 268 prints and the technical and historical information accompanying them, including useful historical essays by Sari Hornstein, are mightily pleasing. The original lithographs, etchings, wood cuts and engravings, most of them hand-colored, range from postcard-size impressions to six-foot panoramas. In a few of these pictures the colors are as sumptuous as oils. One group of six panels forming a 3.8- by 4.4- foot print that records a siege of the port of La Rochelle, France, was made around 1630 by the great Jacques Callot, who could engrave myriads even on a tiny plate; it bristles with hundreds of vessels and thousands of land troops, each precisely depicted and quick with menace. A 17th-century Dutch engraving of 10 scenes on a single sheet records a whole war with England, including the treaty signing and the fireworks at the victory celebration. This book brings art -- and, even more compellingly, history -- to life. For no matter how fascinated a reader may be by the sheer brilliance of the art, after a few pages the hissing and gulping ocean, shouting men, groaning masts and drumming cannons fill the imagination. No movie could ever carry the mind so deeply into such shining, dreadful seas.",1992-06-21T05:00:00+0000

For example, those requesting the Northeast may pick New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania or the rest of New England. Then, a recording lists dates of shows for the following week (or further ahead if there are only a few in the week ahead), their locations, sponsors and number of dealers there, and telephone numbers for further information. The service says its listing contains all the major shows in an area and a sampling of smaller ones. In the summer, the service lists 8 to 20 shows a week for New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, for example, the service said. The sponsors, who notify the Hot Line of their shows, do not pay for their listings, according to the service.

A set of six rings is about $7. They're lightweight, fun to fiddle with (the rings turn one's finger into a plastic stack-the-doughnut toy babies play with), deliciously versatile, goofily cheery and unthreatening. David Spada, the New York artist who designed the rings, hopes they'll be worn by straight people as a universal ""pro-tolerance"" statement. WHAT THEY MEAN: A way for gay people to flaunt their wholesomeness. The rainbow is a stubbornly mainstream, almost Hallmark card emblem, a la unicorns and kittens.

A1 Palestinians in the occupied territories voice hope and caution. A14 Secretary Baker called for a quick resumption of the peace talks. A14 Rabin made clear right away who will be in charge. A14 Arab leaders see better chances for a peace accord with Israel. A15 ACCORD ON GEORGIAN REGION The leader of Georgia and the Russian President signed an agreement to end fighting in secessionist South Ossetia. Yeltsin then flew off to Turkey for a meeting that is expected to focus on ethnic fighting between Azerbaijanis and Armenians. A3 PANAMANIAN MAYOR'S ANGER For the Mayor of Panama City, the interruption of the American Presidential visit by police officers firing tear gas at protesters was a rare setback in a career that has taken her ever upward. A4 ROUGH WELCOME FOR U.S. ENVOY In his first week as Ambassador to Ireland, William FitzGerald has been hit by what a diplomat called ""the Irish Welcome Wagon."" A5 DISPUTING RECORD ON P.O.W.'S Senator Kerry took issue with almost two decades of statements by U.S. Administrations that all Vietnam War prisoners were accounted for when Washington and Hanoi signed a cease-fire in 1973. A7 A QUICK BILLION FOR RUSSIA The I.M.F. plans to lend $1 billion to Moscow to help pay for crucial imports in a simplified reform agreement that the fund hopes to complete in the next several weeks. A10 SARAJEVO SEEKS DELIVERANCE As the Serbian siege of Sarajevo intensifies and the city descends ever deeper into a nightmare, residents look desperately to the outside world for relief. A10 DE KLERK OFFERS CONCESSION President F. W. de Klerk said he would accept an investigation by foreign experts into violence in black townships, but the African National Congress rejected the concession and stepped up its campaign for an international boycott against South African athletes. A12 The London Zoo received a $1.85 million gift from Kuwait. A17 National A18-28, B10-12 DECISION ON SMOKING LIABILITY In an exceptionally broad decision, the Supreme Court opened the door wide to damage suits against the cigarette industry. A1 The ruling came nine years after a dying smoker brought suit. B10 JUSTICES RULE ON SCHOOL PRAYER In a narrow but decisive rebuff to the Administration, the Court ruled that a clergyman's invocation and benediction at a junior high school graduation in Providence, R.I., had transgressed the constitutional boundary between church and state. A1 The ruling happily surprised the couple who brought the case. B11 THE PRESIDENT ON GEORGE BUSH With the Communist menace vanished, the economy still weak and deepening social problems confronting the nation, a crisis of leadership threatens President Bush's re-election. And, during an Oval Office interview, he seemed keenly aware of that crisis as he made his arguments for another term. A1 INVESTIGATOR PEROT Ross Perot does indeed have a history of using investigators and threats against opponents. Now officials of the White House and the Bush re-election committee, who have not been shy about publicly discussing that history, are running the same sort of aggressive inquiry into his past that he has conducted against others. A1 Perot lashed out at a Republican ""dirty tricks crowd."" A26 News analysis: Will the ""spying issue"" burst Perot's bubble? A27 U.S. TRADE RULING FAVORS JAPAN The Federal trade agency ruled that Detroit's auto makers had not suffered significant harm from Japanese mini-vans and that tariffs on the imports would therefore not be imposed. A1 VAST RAIL SHUTDOWN Most freight railroads shut down in response to a strike against one of them, and they urged Congress to intervene. Amtrak was also hobbled, but many commuter lines, including those in the New York area, were not much affected. A18 Congress appeared in no hurry to step in. A18 New York commuters face another deadline tonight. A18 FETAL RESEARCH BILL DIES The House upheld President Bush's veto of legislation that would have allowed the Government to finance research on aborted fetuses. A23 WHO DISCOVERED H.I.V.? A former senior American health official said that the Government had been misled by Dr. Robert Gallo's claim to have been the sole discoverer of the cause of AIDS and that the United States now had a ""moral duty"" to give credit and the royalties to the French.

It is true that, during boom times, owners will order new ships. But few ships are sold for scrap during such periods. When the shipping market is strong and freight rates are high, an old bulker, with probably only a very small mortgage to support, is an efficient moneymaker, and there is no incentive to scrap it. Ships are not sold for scrap because of their age or because they are decrepit-looking. They are scrapped, during busts rather than booms, because that is the best deal owners can get for them at the time. SYDNEY P. LEVINE President, Shipping Intelligence Inc.

Many of them were gravely nonsensical screeds to the little girls the shy Dodgson loved to entertain, tease and photograph (in both clothed and unclothed states). Unfortunately, his letters to his beloved Alice Liddell, daughter of the dean of Christ Church and inspiration for the Alice books, were burned by her mother, who was made so uneasy by Dodgson's excessive attentions to her daughters -- and, presumably, his delicately erotic photographs of them -- that she refused him access to the dean's residence. In LEWIS CARROLL: LOOKING-GLASS LETTERS (Rizzoli, $27.50) Thomas Hinde, an English novelist and popular historian, has therefore had to make do with letters to Dodgson's lesser child friends, which are nevertheless the most amusing -- and poignant -- entries here: ""My dear Agnes, At last I've succeeded in forgetting you! It's been a very hard job, but I took 6 'lessons-in-forgetting,' at half-a-crown a lesson. After three lessons, I forgot my own name, and I forgot to go for the next lesson."" Interspersed with these are less captivating notes to publishers, relatives and recalcitrant illustrators. Perhaps the most charming things in the book are the copious illustrations -- dozens of Dodgson's haunting photographs, his whimsical sketches for the Alice manuscripts, the more famous John Tenniel illustrations of Alice, and various contemporary paintings.",1992-06-28T05:00:00+0000
