us,Screen: Von Stroheim:Cinema History,"IS Gulley Jimson, the rogue-painter in ""The Horse's Mouth,"" a genuine genius or a slippery con artist? Few of the other characters in the Joyce Cary novel are ever quite sure. If someone could certify Gulley's genius, they would gladly put up with his whims. Genius gives license to the most maddening arrogance, but without any certification, Gulley's friends must often suspect they are being swindled.Because most of us now believe that Erich Von Stroheim (1885-1957) was a genius, we tend to look sentimentally at his comparatively meager output as a director  nine films, including those that were never finished, that were finished by others and that were radically edited by others after he had completed them. It's easy to say that he was mistreated, ahead of his time, too honest to compromise and so on. All true, perhaps, but he was also, like Gulley Jimson, a con artist of gargantuan proportions, a man whose genius seems to have been nurtured as much by destructive turmoil as by the creative impulse.It's this dual nature of Mr. Von Stroheim that is brilliantly and economically evoked in Patrick Montgomery's excellent ""The Man You Loved to Hate,"" the feature-length documentary on Mr. Von Stroheim's career as a director and as an actor, which opens today at the Public Theater. The new film will be shown through Sunday, each day accompanying a different film as part of the Public's Von Stroheim retrospective.The title ""The Man You Loved to Hate"" is a play on the phrase ""the man you love to hate,"" by which Von Stroheim-the-actor was known starting in World War I. During the war, he gained fame playing German officers who pillaged and raped without conscience. In one memorable moment, the character he played tossed a small baby out a window in his lust to achieve the baby's mother.""The Man You Loved to Hate"" includes extensive and, generally, very good clips and stills from each of the nine films Mr. Von Stroheim directed, dozens of clips from those films in which he was an actor  everything from ""Birth of a Nation,"" in which he was an extra, to Renoir's ""Grand Illusion""  bits of a hilarious trailer for ""The Mask of Dijon,"" plus interviews with friends, working associates and his wife, whom he married in 1919, and Denise Vernac, the French actress he lived with from 1939 until his death.The great things about the clips Mr. Montgomery has chosen for his documentary is that they not only whet one's appetite for the films in the retrospective, but they also give one an accurate impression of the Von Stroheim style and the massive scale on which he worked in such minute detail. The pictorial quality of most of the clips is first-rate.The life of Von Stroheim-the-man, as recalled in interviews with such people as Hal Mohr, who shot ""The Wedding March""; Paul Kohner, the producer who later became Mr. Von Stroheim's agent; Samuel Marx, Leonard Spigelgass and the others, seems not to have been quite as terrible as legend likes to make the biographies of misunderstood geniuses. Both Mrs. Von Stroheim and Miss Vernac remember him with deep affection, and a lot of the others remember him with humor. There's one especially funny story about Mr. Von Stroheim's troubles with Louis B. Mayer and Mae Murray during the shooting of ""The Merry Widow,"" a series of ""disagreements"" that led eventually to a physical confrontation.""The Man You Loved to Hate"" is cinema history of both entertaining and high order.",1980-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 7 -Hour 'Hitler' by Hans-Jurgen Syberberg:Free-Form Meditation,"""OUR HITLER,"" Hans-Jrgen Syberberg's massive, seven-and-a-half-hour free-form meditation on the rise, fall and apparent immortality of Hitler, begins as a journey toward the stars. As we do at the start of most science-fiction films and before the opening credits of every movie released by Universal Pictures, we sail serenely into a dark, make-believe heaven brilliantly lighted by tiny electric lights. This voyage into the cosmos will also become, as the narrator reminds us, a journey toward the inner self.Like the dopey student in ""National Lampoon's Animal House,"" who, as he smokes marijuana for the first time, is suddenly aware of the universes contained within the atoms of his own little finger, Mr. Syberberg is not one who quickly dismisses his own insights, whether good, bad, indifferent or second-hand. As Mr. Syberberg is a film maker who shoots on what's called a one-to-one basis  that is, who uses every bit of footage he shoots  he seems to be a poet who's never tossed out a bit of scrap paper on which he's scribbled a rotten line.""Our Hitler"" is a movie that demands to be described in terms that cancel themselves out. It is both too much and too little, too obvious and too muddled, too heavy and too frivolous. The 42-year-old West German director, who appears to have poured his heart and soul into this film, is clearly a passionate man, but he is also woefully undiscriminating when it comes to evaluating his own work.Having seen the 102-minute excerpt from his five-hour television documentary, ""The Confessions of Winifred Wagner,"" which was shown at the Film Forum two years ago, I suspect that Mr. Syberberg is a reporter of sensitivity and intelligence as well as of unusual journalistic skills. He is not, however, an especially interesting poet or polemicist. He has an unfortunate gift for seizing on the paradox that doesn't quite balance, for images that say far less than someone else's words he's quoting and for comparisons that are almost comically inopportune.At one point in ""Our Hitler,"" he doesn't hesitate to draw a parallel between M-G-M's butchery of Erich Von Stroheim's original 42-reel version of ""Greed"" and the Nazi program to exterminate the Jews. To see such a parallel is not only to misuse history, but also to get it slightly wrong. After Mr. Von Stroheim's battles with M-G-M about ""Greed,"" the M-G-M butchers hired him back to direct his classic screen version of ""The Merry Widow.""The theme of ""Our Hitler"" is not so much the guilt of our parents, but the need for and the dream of Hitler that, he says, continues to live on in all of us. The principal setting of the film is a movie studio, and the film's not-so-impressive secondary theme is the power and meaning of Film itself. Like the very young Jean-Luc Godard, who once said  before he became interested in videotape  ""Truth is 32 frames a second,"" Mr. Syberberg has a mystical feeling about Film that I associate with the ravenous interest in the possibilities of movies expressed by Mr. Godard and others in the late 50's and early 60's.In many of its aspects, ""Our Hitler"" looks like something out of the early 60's. It seeks to discover new film modes, though it is completely incapable of getting rid of the old, often substituting style for content, though, unlike Mr. Godard, Mr. Syberberg has no spontaneous feeling for style.""Our Hitler"" is a collage film divided into four impressively titled sections  ""The Grail,"" ""A German Dream,"" ""The End of a Winter's Tale"" and ""We Children of Hell."" It is made up of cabaret turns in which actors satirize Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler, Gring and others; of still photographs and newsreel clips, of old radio broadcasts, of songs and dances, of excerpts from ""Mein Kampf"" and from the testimony of people who knew Hitler and from concentration-camp victims.This is more or less tied together by Mr. Syberberg's sweepingly generalized vision that has as its ultimate point that Hitler is immortal as long as the earth survives and that, indeed, his programs and policies live on in the Soviet Union, the United States, China, in East and West Germany and in the third world. Using Mr. Syberberg's methods, an equally serious (or unserious) argument can be made to blame Lincoln for the bombing of Cambodia.When one spreads responsibility so broadly, responsibility ceases to exist and becomes, instead, a pardon.""Life is a circus,"" Mr. Syberberg tells us in the first of the several dozen cabaret turns that stud the film, through which a pretty, pensive little girl, Democracy (played by the director's daughter), wanders worriedly, cuddling a toy dog that has a Hitler face, her head draped in long, loose pieces of film stock. Life is also film, he tells us, and makes a case for it as far as Hitler is concerned, suggesting that once World War II got under way, it became an unending newsreel movie for Hitler to watch nightly in his bunker.The set decorations in the studio sometimes evoke Hell, sometimes (with the help of excellent slide projections) Hitler's Chancellory, Berchtesgaden, the streets of Berlin, where the actors do their bits, their feet often obscured in fancily lighted fumes of dry ice. We see Hitler wearing a toga, rising from the tomb of Richard Wagner. We listen to him in the shape of a dummy arguing with his ventriloquist about his successes and failures. This Hitler is no madman. He is the devil in everyone.Several of these turns are as suprising and as stunningly effective as Mr. Syberberg means them to be, especially one in which Heinz Schubert, a veteran of the Berliner Ensemble, appears as Himmler, talking to his masseur about the great weight he carries as the Reich police chief and the awful burden of committing atrocities. Peter Kern also has a fine, spectacular sequence in which he plays Ellerkamp, Hitler's personal projectionist, who went on after the war to become a film distributor.It says something about the form of the movie, though, and about Mr. Syberberg's mastery of it, that the most riveting sequences are those that recall the texts of ""Mein Kampf"" and the memoirs of real people, like Hitler's valet, who reveals, among other things, that Hitler's breakfast consisted of two cups of warm milk, eight biscuits and the broken-up pieces of a bar of bitter chocolate. Hitler wore short underpants, no undershirt and, at night, a plain linen nightshirt. Fuzzy abstractions are no match for specific details.Fact keeps overwhelming Mr. Syberberg's poetic insights. They also trivialize his many film references to such things as Mlies, ""M,"" ""Citizen Kane"" and Eisenstein. A ""quote"" from ""The Great Dictator,"" with an actor imitating Charlie Chaplin imitating Hitler, distances us from reality too far to serve even a Brechtian point. It simply focuses our attention on the director and on what appears to be his limited imagination. The bits and pieces of verbatim concentration-camp stories we hear have the effect of making everything that has come before and after seem less substantial than the dry-ice fumes.More revealing of the film are the extended passages in which Mr. Syberberg has an actor read very, very long passages from the research material gathered for the film. I can't be sure if the trouble is in the original text or in the subtitles, but what we hear is a string of platitudes that eventually cover the movie with verbal sludge.""Our Hitler,"" which was given its New York premiere at Lincoln Center on Sunday, will receive three showings at Hunter College, Saturday and Jan. 26 and 27, all at 2:30 P.M.While watching the film Sunday night, it occurred to me that it really may not be fair to insist on looking at it in one long sitting, with only a 90-minute intermission. The film was meant to be seen in segments on television. Yet I suspect this marathon viewing probably helps it more than hurts it, making it seem more monumental than it might if caught in shorter takes. ""Our Hitler"" is an ambitious undertaking, but it slides recklessly over the surface of matters of profound importance.",1980-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Apple Game,' a Czechoslovak Comedy:Playing Doctor","VERA CHYTILOVA commences ""The Apple Game"" with a series of bloody, graphic close-ups of babies being born, which is certainly one way of letting her audience know this film means business. From there, she proceeds to tell the story of a Czechoslovak playboy obstetrician who lives with his mother, is fearful of starting his own family and romances the nurses in the delivery room while a chorus of expectant mothers scream and moan. Is this any setting for a romantic comedy? Certainly not, but ""The Apple Game"" turns out to be surprisingly lighthearted, all the same.Miss Chytilova's shock tactics and leaden ironies occasionally obscure the gentler merits of her movie, which was shown at the 1978 New York Film Festival and is the first new Czechoslovak film to make its American debut in a decade. Her story's two principals (Jiri Menzel, the Czechoslovak director, as the doctor and Dagmar Blahova as a sprite of a nurse who eventually gives him his comeuppance) are altogether winsome. And their courtship is outlined by Miss Chytilova with a full supply of eccentric charm.Mr. Menzel's dour, crabby obstetrician is also involved with the wife of a colleague, played by Evelyna Steimarova-Ytirova as a siren in red wool stockings who always manages to attract more attention than her lover might want. When the doctor spirits her off to a secluded spot that turns out to be the middle of a construction site, full of workers who are tickled to witness this tryst, he becomes far more disconcerted than she.Mr. Menzel, best known here for his direction of ""Closely Watched Trains,"" makes the doctor a hilarious fussbudget, a far more fully drawn character than might be expected to fit into the film's strict feminist scheme. Indeed, this fellow is designed to be a feminist's dartboard, affirming stereotypically wicked masculinity at every turn. Yet Mr. Menzel, and especially Miss Blahova, are so lively and disarming that personality supersedes politics much of the time.Nothing about the story, which ends on an ambiguous note that is merely vague, has the stridency or bluntness of the operating-room footage; that, perhaps, is the best reason why the film's opening is ill-advised. Miss Chytilova's main accomplishment here is in recalling the kinds of vibrant, offbeat characters associated with the Czechoslovak cinema of the mid-60's. It's a tribute to the comic vitality of her movie that its more commonplace didacticisms go unnoticed much of the time.",1980-01-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Talia Shire Is Menaced in 'Windows':P.S. Your Cat Is Frozen,"""WINDOWS,"" which opens today at the Baronet and other theaters, is the first film to be directed by Gordon Willis, the noted cameraman, but he should not, I think, be held responsible. The guilty parties are Michael Lobell, the producer, formerly of the garment industry, and Barry Siegel, the writer, who, between them, cooked up this frail melodrama and then hired Mr. Willis to direct it, instead of placing it decently in a garbage disposal unit.Everything about ""Windows"" is ridiculous; including the performances of Talia Shire as Emily, a young woman who is viciously attacked one night by an intruder in her Brooklyn Heights apartment, and Elizabeth Ashley as Andrea, the very rich, very psychotic lesbian poet who has hired the thug to do the deed. Andrea, madly in love with the colorless Emily, gets her thrills by listening to a tape recording of Emily's screams and groans.Before anyone rushes to his feather pen to write that I've ruined the movie by reporting too much of the plot, let me say that nothing could ruin this movie and that Andrea's part in the attack is revealed to the audience at the beginning. The movie attempts to generate suspense by making us wonder how Andrea will eventually lure Emily to a fate worse than death, plus maybe death, too. Unfortunately for us, Emily is so stupid that all Andrea has to do is call her up and ask her over, but then Emily has had a terrible shock, having just found her cat flash frozen in the fridge.How does Andrea keep up with Emily's comings and goings, her moods, her choice of television shows? Very simple. She buys a telescope, only slightly less powerful than the one at the Mount Wilson Observatory, through which she peers into Emily's uncurtained windows on the other side of the East River. The telescope is an important prop. It is, of course, a phallic symbol and it allows Andrea to watch Emily as Emily is watching ""Now Voyager.""""Windows"" has remarkably little pace of any kind, partly because anything of any interest happens off-screen and what happens off-screen is consistently, nuttily irrelevant. The camera-work, which Mr. Willis did for himself, is technically O.K. though it tends to rely on the kind of fancy lighting and camera angles that a less desperate director might have avoided.The supporting cast includes Kay Medford, who plays a lady next door, and Joseph Cortese as the cop who investigates Emily's attack and, for no comprehensible reason, falls in love with her. Though he's a couple of minutes too late to prevent Emily from keeping her possibly fatal rendezvous with Andrea, he does arrive before Emily's cat has defrosted. That's the sort of suspense movie ""Windows"" is.",1980-01-18T05:00:00+0000

Salutes The Glorious Gadget:Borodin Trio in Bronxville Wire Loose Somewhere,"THE message of ""Gizmo!,"" which is set forth in lofty sounding gibberish at both the film's beginning and its end, is that for every task, however simple or trivial, there is someone who'll go to phenomenal lengths to avoid it. In support of this theory, Howard Smith has constructed a paean to the most justifiably unheralded inventors in history, assembling crazy snippets and even crazier characters into a film guaranteed to make you smile.Not everything is quite so funny as the wet baby alarm, say, or the man who can play ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" on an air pump, or even the oft-repeated spectacle of someone in a homemade flying machine waving an ungainly pair of wings and going splat! But Mr. Smith, in this good-humored tribute to ingenuity gone wild, documents such a wide variety of weirdos that he's bound to offer something for everyone. Mr. Smith's interest, not strictly confined to inventors, is broad enough to embrace every species of harmless fanatic, from human flies to astronauts, just plain showoffs to real daredevils. Even the sheer scope of this enterprise is good for a chuckle or two.For ""Gizmo!,"" which opens today at the Manhattan I theater, Mr. Smith has combed numerous film archives and found footage of the following: A device that enables a German shepherd to power a washing machine. Goggles with windshield wipers. A whirling spaghetti fork that spatters food instead of spinning it, and a clock that says things such as ""It's 10 o'clock, Mother  go to market!"" when it ought to chime. A rubberized beard cover, to protect the wearer from the problem of wetness while he swims. A man who plays an instrument made out of a scraggly, hollowed-out tree branch and some bottle caps. A woman who, after careening along a high wire to which she's fastened by her teeth, announces ""At last I've found a safe way to cross Times Square!""The film clips in ""Gizmo!,"" most of which seem to come from the 30's and 40's, often show particular inventors at their oddest as they explain whatever their pet projects happen to be. It goes without saying that a man who, for example, has gone to the trouble of learning to exhale through his left ear  he uses this talent to blow up balloons  is strange. Mr. Smith uses a number of clips that show inventors speaking in a supposedly casual manner that only exaggerates their nuttiness. One man's explanation of how he learned to play ""The Trail of the Lonesome Pines"" by squeezing his hands together is even funnier than the musical interlude that follows.""Adios!,"" cries one adventurer to the camera, before embarking on a ""rocket flight"" that takes him 50 feet, instead of to the moon. ""Where shall I drop you?"" asks a pilot to two of his passengers, who are supposedly demonstrating commuting techniques of the future. ""Mount Vernon!"" they cry, and then one asks the other ""Say, have you heard the one about the traveling salesman?"" Before this authentic commuter talk can be continued, they are jettisoned by parachute out a trap door in the plane.Mr. Smith, a columnist for The Village Voice who also directed ""Marjoe,"" has assembled ""Gizmo!"" with a cheerful messiness and a certain amount of repetition that, in a 79-minute documentary, pose no problem at all. The bouncy musical accompaniment to a number of sequences, and the concluding footage of a skiier gloriously aloft on a glider rig, confirm that Mr. Smith's attitude toward his subject is essentially benign, even admiring, and certainly fond. His delight in the material steers him away from any cruelty, in a film with considerable potential for same, and lends the whole thing a feeling of friendly celebration.The Borodin Piano Trio, which immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union four years ago, will appear Sunday at 8 P.M. in Reisinger Auditorium of Sarah Lawrence College on Glen Washington Road in Bronxville, N.Y. The trio  Rostislav Dubinsky, violinist; Luba Edlina, pianist, and Yuli Turovsky, cellist  will perform Brahms's Trio in B major (Op. 8), Beethoven's Trio No. 2, in E flat major (Op. 70) and Ravel's Piano Trio.

us,Film: Japanese 'Sounds From the Mountains':Dissonance and Discord,"""THE Sounds From the Mountains,"" a Japanese family drama from the director Mikio Naruse, has a precision and intimacy that makes it reminiscent of Yasujiro Ozu's works dating from this same period, the middle 1950's. But Mr. Naruse's film also has a harshness that places it in the neighborhood of soap opera, which is something Mr. Ozu's films never hint at. The tension between these extremes, never resolved, is both the film's strongest point of interest and its most damaging liability.The family crises presented here are sometimes suggestive, by virtue of their deliberate tininess, of thwarted hopes, shifting values, great, terrible changes in the world outside. Just as often, Mr. Naruse makes them too tawdry to have this kind of reach. The most arresting thing about ""The Sounds From the Mountains"" is its constantly shifting mood, which travels from the emblematic to the commonplace, and back again. The film's ending, on a note of the most delicate, shapely irony, fulfills a promise that the rest of the drama doesn't entirely keep.Much of the time, Mr. Naruse's story takes the strangely self-defeating form of a polite tragedy. An upright, somewhat old-fashioned father is dismayed to discover that his daughter's marriage is a disaster, and that his son is matter-of-factly unfaithful to the most loving, devoted daughter-in-law any couple could wish for. The film, mostly set in the parents' household, concerns itself with the father's efforts to rectify problems that he cannot possibly solve, and with his growing realization that, for his children's generation, behaving well has lost its value.The father grows close to his daughter-in-law, even as she becomes more and more deeply estranged from her dissolute husband. In fact, Mr. Naruse suggests that their friendship may be the only truly tragic situation on hand. The father's marriage, which seems amicable but uninvolving for him, offers nothing like the depth of feeling he has developed for his daughter-in-law. Yet when he tells her, speaking of a country house he and his wife own, that ""I'll retire there and live there with my wife and then die there,"" his resignation is uncompromising, and complete. He cares about this young woman precisely because she, like he, lives by the old rules and cares about decency. The film concludes with the question of whether, for two such people, behaving dutifully may be worth more than simpler satisfactions.The rest of the film is devoted to the greed, obtuseness, drunken excesses and general cruelty of the other characters, except for the son's mistress, who makes rather an abrupt turnaround at the father's urging. Though much of this is beautifully played, its nastiness is startling, and perhaps too jarring, in Mr. Naruse's otherwise serene settings. Mr. Naruse's direction dramatizes, in its own way, the film's essential conflict, as it juxtaposes corrupt, lazy modern characters with the placid, immaculate world of their fore-bears. In the end, this approach is more illustrative than illuminating.""The Sounds From the Mountains"" has its premiere today at the Bleecker Street Cinema.",1980-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Coup de Tete,' Comedy From France:Child of Misfortune","FRANCOIS PERRIN (Patrick Dewaere) is a child of misfortune. He suspects that when he was a baby and in a public nursery, he was given to the wrong parent. ""There is every possibility,"" he says, ""that I am not me."" Now he works in a mill factory and is retained mostly because he's an excellent soccer player, though he's too hot-headed and independent to play on the factory's first-string team.Franois seethes with anger and frustration because he is, after all, bigger, brighter and better than the aspiring members of the petit-bourgeoisie who surround him. It's no surprise when, after injuring the soccer team's star player during practice, he is not only kicked off the squad but also dismissed from his job.""Coup de Tte,"" the new French comedy by Jean-Jacques Annaud, whose ""Black and White in Color"" won the Oscar three years ago as the best foreign-language film, is the fairy-tale account of the revenge of Franois on the citizens of a small town of not-so-harmless boobs. Shortly after being dismissed from his job and even being banished from his favorite pub, Franois is railroaded to prison on a rape charge, largely as the result of the perjured testimony of his former coaches. When the team loses several players in a bus accident, only Franois can save the day  which he does, but not as forgivingly as everyone initially assumes.""Coup de Tte,"" which opens today at the Paris, is not exactly a one-joke comedy, but it is the sort of single-situation comedy that, to succeed, must always take the unexpected route to the expected destination, something that Mr. Annaud does about one-third of the time. It's a nice movie that isn't as comic or as exuberant as it pretends to be, partly because Mr. Dewaere (""Going Places,"" ""Get Out Your Handkerchiefs"") is too sophisticated a screen presence to be entirely convincing as the thirtyish naf he plays here. It's the kind of role that Grard Depardieu, Mr. Dewaere's co-star in ""Going Places"" and ""Handkerchiefs,"" can handle with far more boisterous authority. Because Mr. Dewaere appears to be acting down to the role, he gives the impression of wanting to be cute, winningly boyish.Then, too, Mr. Annaud has no gift for disguising the mechanics of a comedy scene. He has the unfortunate gift of showing us too much, as in an elaborate, potentially hilarious sequence in which Franois and his sometime girl-friend wrestle amorously and noisily on a painter's scaffold just outside the bedroom window where the woman's husband is sleeping. The scene is almost funny in the way of a routine still being rehearsed and refined.There is another troubling aspect to the film that may only be a reflection of my awareness that Mr. Annaud, before he made his feature film debut with ""Black and White in Color,"" was a highly successful director of television commercials and movie trailers. Watching ""Coup de Tte,"" I had the distinct impression that the director was occupying himself too much with small details and not paying enough attention to their cumulative effect. The movie doesn't build to any satisfactory climax. It moves horizontally.There's even some confusion in basic exposition. Until late in the film, I was going on the assumption that Franois was actually guilty of the rape of which he was accused, though that turns out not to be so. Though this could be the result of my own failure of perception, I insist on taking the only honorable way out for a movie critic and I blame the movie.",1980-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Mozart,' Chronicle Of a Genius Growing Up:A Family of Letters","ON the 14th of November, 1777, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, then 21, wrote to his suitably upset father, Leopold:""I must admit that I enjoyed [sinning] prodigiously. I confess all these my sins and transgressions from the bottom of my heart, and, in the hope of confessing them more often, I am firmly resolved constantly to improve on the evil manner of life which I have begun. Therefore I beg for holy dispensation, if it can be managed; and if not, it's all one to me, for the game will go on all the same.""It's one of the many unexpected achievements of Klaus Kirschner's fine 1976 German film, ""Mozart  A Childhood Chronicle,"" that it conveys so much of the laughing spirit of this most debonair of geniuses while also seeing all of the humiliations and frustrations that are the givens for an artist who survives at the pleasure of his patrons. Maria Theresa once wrote to a thick-brained son suggesting that he find something for Mozart to do. It was a halfhearted recommendation because Wolfgang Amadeus and his family made her uneasy. ""They move around like beggars,"" she said with impatience, as if anyone with any gumption would just settle in one spot and open an empire.""Mozart  A Childhood Chronicle,"" which opens today at the Public Theater, initially looks extremely mild and modest, but don't be fooled. It's a wonderfully big, complex and moving film that should not be missed by anyone who has even a passing interest in the work of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and in the lives and relationships that were a part of his work.Mr. Kirschner, a German film maker otherwise unknown to me, has based his screenplay on that series of brilliantly un-self-conscious letters exchanged among the members of the Mozart family  Wolfgang Amadeus, his father, his mother and his older sister, ""Nannerl."" However, instead of making any serious attempt to illustrate the letters, he provides vivid, if spare, visual contexts for their contents, which are spoken on the soundtrack. The film, photographed in black and white and mostly in close-ups and medium shots, is uninhabited except by Mozarts and by a few key figures who can't be ignored. Yet the film is anything but empty.It is alive with the exuberance, the wit, the intelligence and the love of these four people who had the gift of writing letters the way most people talk. The contents of each letter are carefully answered in a succeeding letter, so that, at times, Mr. Kirschner can quietly dispense with the recurring image of one person's studying a piece of paper while another's voice is on the soundtrack.Toward the end of the film, when Leopold is scolding his son for a variety of things, including his lack of seriousness and for falling in with bad company, we are presented with a series of scenes in which Leopold and Wolfgang, in alternate close-ups, rail at each other in the most civilized tones. The effect is astonishingly moving and  dare I use the word?  cinematic.I should also point out that the film, which covers Mozart's life from age 7 until his early 20's, has a running time of almost four hours, yet it seems less than half that long.With the exception of the sequence in which Mozart's mother dies in Paris, Mr. Kirschner avoids the temptation to use the music to illustrate emotion. The music is there (quite a lot of it and one still wishes for more), but it doesn't exist to inform our feelings. There is sometimes a historical point to be made from the use of a particular selection. Mostly, though, the music exists without explanation, as it did in Mozart's head.The performances are properly reserved. This is not, after all, a film of surface confrontations. The three young actors who play Mozart look enough alike to have grown one into the other. Karl-Maria Schley, who is excellent as Leopold, suggests a youngish George Arliss. Ingeborg Schroeder, Nina Palmers, Elisabeth Bronfen and Dietlind Hbner are enchantingly pretty as the young women in Wolfgang's life.The film that ""Mozart"" will be compared with, I suppose, is Jean-Marie Straub's ""The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach,"" beside which ""Mozart"" looks as busy as a Ken Russell production. The comparison is really of no point. ""Mozart"" is not about music, but about the interior life that produced that music, about states of mind that are sometimes miraculously illuminated in those hundreds of family letters. ""I whistle my own tune,"" Wolfgang wrote his sister from Milan in September 1771, ""and no one answers me.""",1980-01-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Wenders's 'The Wrong Move':Nonwriting Writer,"WILHELM MEISTER (Rudiger Vogler) writes about what he experiences, not about what he observes. Perhaps because of this the young writer never seems surprised by the curious things people say to him. When he sets off to see the world, his mother says at the railroad station: ""Please don't forget me. I've always been fond of you."" Wilhelm's response is to think that he'd like to comb his hair when he's on the train.Wilhelm is always too busy responding to his own thoughts to look squarely at others. Nor does he question the chance alliances that are more or less thrust on him as, in Wim Wenders's 1975 film, ""The Wrong Move,"" he moves across Germany collecting a very odd assortment of acquaintances.These include Laertes (Hans Christian Blech), a jovial, menacing old man; and Laertes's traveling companion, Mignon (Natassia Kinski), a nubile, sexually forthright young woman who sometimes stands on her head to say ""thank you."" There are also Landau (Peter Kern), a poet, and Therese (Hanna Schygulla), a beautiful actress whom Wilhelm first sees from his train window as she passes in another train. When he encounters her the next day, on the street of a distant city, she suggests they make love, but Wilhelm is always Wilhelm. He politely declines because, as he explains, he's not ready for ""a new person.""""The Wrong Move,"" which opens today at the Harold Clurman Theater, is the fourth feature made by the talented young German director who has already been represented here by ""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,"" ""Alice in the Cities,"" ""Kings of the Road"" and ""The American Friend.""Like ""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,"" which is as successful a screen adaptation of a nouveau roman as I've seen, ""The Wrong Move"" was written by Peter Handke, who seems to have taken the form and some of the characters' names from Goethe's ""Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre,"" first published in 1795-96 in four volumes divided into eight books.Though it is never lightheartedly funny, ""The Wrong Move"" is an essentially comic picture of the young, intensely self-absorbed, would-be writer, the sort of fellow who says one morning to a companion, quite seriously, ""I intended to start writing today, but I dreamed so much last night it's impossible."" In this way once again Wilhelm spares himself the bother of getting down to a writer's business.Instead of writing Wilhelm drives across Germany with his mysterious friends, ever on the lookout for things to experience. There are occasional things to be experienced firsthand, as when the industrialist, who has put him up for the night, hangs himself the next afternoon. Mostly, though, Wilhelm's experiences are secondhand. They are his friends' remembered dreams and recollections of childhoods that may or may not be true.Truth, however, is not as important to Wilhelm as his reaction to whatever is happening or being said. There's a nice, lively moment late in the movie when Therese, who has been confiding to Wilhelm her troubles as an actress, realizes he hasn't been listening. ""I was listening,"" he says as she beats him furiously with one of his very thin manuscripts, ""but I kept thinking I was losing writing time.""Unlike the anxiety of the goalie, whose alienation is part of the universal system of things, Wilhelm's anxiety is largely self-imposed, something he cultivates as if it were an educational tool. The movie, like Wilhelm, deals in heightened experience through vivid colors and in the amplification of small sounds, while (also like Wilhelm) it pays no attention to the feelings and emotions of others.""The Wrong Move,"" an uncommonly beautiful film, was photographed by Robbie Muller, who has done all of Mr. Wenders's work, the grainy black-and-white ""road"" pictures as well as the elegant, eerie color movies.Mr. Vogler gives an extremely witty performance, being always dead-serious and impossibly assuming (by which I mean the opposite of unassuming), as a 20th-century version of an 18th-century German romantic. Also fine are Mr. Blech, Miss Kinski and the incomparable Hanna Schygulla, much more of whom can be seen currently in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ""The Marriage of Maria Braun.""""The Wrong Move"" is not a film to be casually recommended, though. It lacks the narrative desperation that illuminate ""The Goalie's Anxiety"" and ""The American Friend."" It is too chilly to be very involving. Yet it is another fascinating reminder of the very original work being done these days by Mr. Wenders and his German colleagues.",1980-01-25T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Guyana,' a Replay:Nervy Re-creation","""GUYANA  Cult of the Damned,"" which opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters, is a nervy, superficial re-creation of the events leading up to  and including  the mass suicide and murder of nearly a thousand people at Jonestown, Guyana, in the autumn of 1978. The movie, a Mexican-Spanish-Panamanian co-production, is an attempt less to understand what happened than to merchandise it. As such movies go, it is fairly efficient and of an ineptitude not often encountered, even in junk movies.Rene Cardona Jr., the movie's producer and director, also wrote the mush-mouthed screenplay with Carlos Valdemar, whom he hired, according to my program notes, to give literary form to his original story. Would that mean putting in commas, semicolons and periods? I can't be sure. I am sure, however, Mr. Cardona is a fellow with a lot of what  in Sinclair Lewis country  used to be called get-up-and-go. Among other things, he's the fellow who was responsible for ""Survive,"" the Mexican quickie about the Andean air crash whose survivors were accused of cannibalism.Mr. Cardona seems to have cast his latest picture from the names he found in a 1959 Hollywood gossip column. Gene Barry appears as the California Representative who goes to Johnsontown  the movie's name for Jonestown  to investigate the cult led by the Rev. Jim Johnson, played by Stuart Whitman. Yvonne De Carlo is the cult's public-relations officer, Bradford Dillman its physician, and John Ireland and Joseph Cotten are the two lawyers, not very friendly to each other, who accompany the Congressman to Guyana as the representatives of the cult's leader.The screenplay is so stingy with facts it could have been researched in a single afternoon in the bar of the Acapulco Hilton. The physical production is no better. There isn't much dialogue, but what there is sounds hastily postsynchronized. The film relies mainly on soundtrack narration by a Johnsontown cult member who plays no part in the movie we are looking at.Of the performers, only Mr. Whitman makes any sense. He's effective enough to make one wonder what he might have accomplished with a screenplay and direction bold enough to aspire to mere adequacy.",1980-01-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Brusati's 'To Forget Venice':Lives Re-Examined,"IF Franco Brusati's ""To Forget Venice"" were a more appealing movie, it might seem mysterious instead of obscure. As it is, Mr. Brusati's film requires a lot of deciphering, and plenty of patience, too. Whatever secrets lurk beneath this pretty and bewildering surface, they feel like more trouble than they're worth. Mr. Brusati offers extravagant amounts of smoke, but no evidence of a real fire.""To Forget Venice,"" which opens today at the Little Carnegie, has a solemn, pretentious air that marks quite a departure from Mr. Brusati's previous effort, the far more effervescent ""Bread and Chocolate."" A group of people, whose family connection is extremely puzzling, are reunited at a large country house where at least a few of them were raised. There, they confront memories of their past and in some ineffable way prepare to face the future.They see images of themselves as small children, and dance the tango. Then one of them dies, and the others are dispersed, and the house's sole remaining occupant eats a life-affirming picnic lunch. Freeze-frame and finale.The occupants of the house include two homosexual couples, Nicky and Picchio (Erland Josephson and David Pontremoli) and Anna and Claudia (Mariangela Melato and Eleonora Giorgi). Also in the group is Marta (Hella Petri), an aging opera star whom the others call Aunt Marta, although it is one of the film's lesser ironies that she is nobody's aunt.Marta and Nicky, who are brother and sister, must have had a traumatic upbringing, since they are such unhappy adults. But neither the setting nor the frequent flashbacks cast much light on the source of their troubles. Everything wrong with Anna, on the other hand, can apparently be traced back to her blowsy, sexually ravenous mother, also played by Miss Melato in one of the film's very few funny episodes. Miss Melato, a gifted comedian, spends most of her time here experiencing an anguish that the audience can never quite fathom. Mr. Josephson's principal task is to beam with wonder and amazement each time an impish ghost of Nicky as a small boy breezes by. Both of these fine actors give earnest, energetic performances that are undermined by the film's generally baffling tone.Mr. Brusati's fondness for self-important claptrap reaches its pinnacle in a flashback involving young Marta, a crystal ball, and a cast of masquerade characters with names like Wealth and Beauty, dressed in outfits that would be excessive even on Halloween. The rest of the film is more subdued, very handsomely photographed, and only occasionally given over to shots of glistening, dripping leaves in the forest and similar window-dressing.The film's occasional earthiness may help it hold the interest of a docile audience, but when it comes to the characters' sexuality, Mr. Brusati is at his most unclear. Heterosexual sex is made to seem grubby and disgusting; homosexuality fares no better, since it appears to be the principal factor in the characters' arrested development. Perhaps Anna and Claudia have simply been together too long, though, after 20 years. And maybe it's the duration of their love affair that holds them back, and not its sexual nature.Perhaps Nicky is merely hiding from himself by staying with Picchio, a much younger man. Perhaps the senile housekeeper is right in proposing that everyone bring galoshes to Venice  a trip that never takes place, and does nothing to explain the title, by the way  since Venice is full of water. Perhaps there's more to ""To Forget Venice"" than meets the eye. I can't tell. You decide. Bring galoshes.",1980-01-28T05:00:00+0000
