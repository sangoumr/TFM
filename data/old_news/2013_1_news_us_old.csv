One the one hand, it includes a real Democratic concession, which substitutes a top income rate threshold of $400,000 for the $250,000 threshold that President Obama had long insisted on. But at the same time, for liberals seeking progressivity and fairness, that should be the easiest possible concession to make. The $400,000 threshold still puts the top bracket close to where it was under Bill Clinton when you adjust for inflation, and that Clintonian definition of rich wasnt an implausible one: While the whining of the upper upper middle class (or, if you prefer, the not-that-rich rich) can be unseemly, there really is a big difference between a taxpayer making six figures annually and a taxpayer making seven or eight, and setting the top rate in the mid rather than low six figures is a way of acknowledging that the near-rich and super-rich do not occupy the same financial universe.",2013-01-01T13:32:14+0000

He created Nutcracker! in 1992, and, in 1995, Swan Lake which, as even nondance fans know, boasted a corps de ballet of virile male swans and enjoyed enormous international success. Mr. Bournes work remains extremely popular, particularly in Britain, where his company, New Adventures, has the kinds of lengthy runs and huge audiences more associated with Broadway than ballet. Sleeping Beauty, for example, opened Dec. 4 and runs through Jan. 26 at Sadlers Wells, where Mr. Bourne is an associate artist. There are good reasons for Mr. Bournes success. He is a masterly storyteller. He is brilliant at finding a kernel of emotional truth in, and a fresh approach to, familiar dance narratives that make them resonate in new ways.

Last week, thousands of Sunni Muslims took to the streets again, blocking Iraqs main road and trade link to Syria and Jordan. Mr. Maliki told Iraqi state television that some of the protesters demands were legitimate, like calls for jobs. But he added that the government had been patient long enough, and that protests should not continue indefinitely. In a statement from his office on Wednesday, Mr. Maliki said that the enemies of the political process, the armed terrorist groups and the remnants of the former regime were being given a chance to infiltrate the demonstrations, threatening national unity.

In other words, objects exist within a web of associations and relationships that are utterly personal, but also  at times  bewilderingly universal. Sasamoto, whose work was included in the 2010 Whitney Biennial, makes these connections visible through networks of cords and cables that demarcate lines across spaces and between repeated motifs like lemons and doughnuts. In her performances, she frequently wields a thick marker to draw whirlwind diagrams of coincidence or alliances, as if she were an unusually aggressive math teacher (the field in which she began her studies). The relentless pace of her narration is matched in her nimble and mercurial movements; her installations often act as room-size jungle gyms, from which she effortlessly folds, wraps or dangles her body, navigating around her audience.",2013-01-03T21:00:07+0000

(The scenarios being spun out tended to either envision extracting never-gonna-happen concessions from the Democrats across weeks of brand-destroying brinksmanship, or embracing a truly massive defeat on taxes as a the worse, the better step toward eventual conservative resurgence.) This confusion was obvious throughout, but particularly during the brief window on Tuesday when there was talk of House Republicans sending the bill back to the Senate with some amendments tacked on. If there had been any kind of strategically-plausible consensus about how conservatives actually wanted the compromise amended, then that gambit might have made some sense.

In actuality, the intellectual landscape is so fragmented that highly literate Americans may not know of this prolific Harvard historian, the recipient of two Pulitzers, a National Book Award, a National Humanities Medal and a Bancroft (the most important professional prize for American historians). Bailyns most influential work probably still is his Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (1967), which forever changed views of our nations beginnings. But my favorite is The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson (1974), a superb portrait of the last royal governor of Massachusetts, a conscientious but obtuse public servant whose inability to grasp his subjects resentments led to his becoming the most hated man in the colonies.

us,Displaced Persons,"Life Goes On is both a very good first novel and a chilling reminder of the Nazis success at destroying Germanys rich literary culture for a generation, if not longer. The author, Hans Keilson, wrote this lightly fictionalized account of his life about 80 years ago, when he was in his early 20s. To give just one example of how much the world has changed since then: Keilson tells us in an afterword that the impetus to start the novel was the fury he felt after hed been turned away as a patient by the powerful Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute. (A few years later, the institute would be taken over by a cousin of Hermann Goering, and most of its analysts would flee to Palestine.) The publisher, the great S. Fischer Verlag, accepted the novel for publication in December 1932. The extremely poor and extremely elated Keilson took his advance and went skiing for the first time in his life. When he came back, the Reichstag was on fire, the Nazis had begun arresting Communists, and the publisher told Keilson to change his ending, which had a Communist twist. The novel appeared, with the altered ending, in 1933. It was banned in 1934. And that is the story, Keilson explains in the afterword, of the last debut by a Jewish writer from the old S. Fischer Verlag.",2013-01-04T17:03:05+0000

The most plausible recent example of such a bargain is the deal that George H.W. Bush struck with Congressional Democrats in 1990, which brought him so much grief and helped inspire a generation of Republican resistance to tax increases: That compromise promised to cut $500 billion from the deficit over five years, which (per my back-of-the-envelope adjustments for inflation) is the equivalent of about $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over ten years today. $2.5 trillion isa big number  but its only slightly more than the combined deficit reduction promised by last years debt-ceiling deal and this months tax increases combined  and that combination, of course, has only put a very modest dent in our long-term deficit problem.",2013-01-07T17:35:31+0000

As prepared in Alba, fillet of beef is hand cut and dressed with olive oil, lemon and maybe anchovies and shavings of white truffle. But the evening before the tasting, I had a different type of carne cruda, also perfect with dolcetto, at Commerce, in the West Village. Harold Moore, the chef and a partner, seared beef deckle and served thin slices, still raw in the center, over charred mushrooms, with a light salad garnish, a shot of spice and a drizzle of ponzu, a citrus-flavored soy sauce. He calls the dish toro because its similar to his preparation for seared tuna. Cant find a butcher who sells tasty beef deckle, the rib cap? A hunk of fillet will do just fine.

(HBO) THE THREE STOOGES (2012) Will Sasso stars as Curly, Sean Hayes is Larry, and Chris Diamantopoulos is Moe (pictured above, from left) in this fictionalized origin story for the mostly lovable fools, and paean to the art of the eye poke, from Peter and Bobby Farrelly. Divided into episodes, the tale follows the Stooges from infancy  when theyre tossed out of a speeding car at the feet of a nun, Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David)  to adulthood, when theyre forced to try to save the orphanage in which they were reared from the faltering economy and other calamities. Jane Lynch plays the Mother Superior who sends them out into the world, where they meet a femme fatale (Sofia Vergara) and her lover (Craig Bierko); the handsome guy from the Old Spice commercials (Isaiah Mustafa); and some of the cast of Jersey Shore. The three leads in The Three Stooges play dumb very well, particularly Mr. Sasso, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. She added: Much of the pleasure in The Three Stooges comes from watching and hearing (the boings and thumps are terrific) grown men smack each other silly in Rube Goldberg-like formations and without suffering so much as a single black eye, enduring psychological damage or, as bad, being forced to change. Like Wile E. Coyote and those inflatable clowns that bounce back after every punch, the Three Stooges take plenty of hits but keep on coming.

He also wanted to end coverage for more than 6,000 19- and 20-year-olds. Marilyn Tavenner, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told Mr. LePage in a letter that the cuts would violate a provision of President Obamas health care law requiring states to maintain Medicaid eligibility levels. But Ms. Tavenner did approve a separate plan to end Medicaid coverage for Maine parents earning more than 133 percent of the poverty level. Mr. LePage had hoped to save more than $20 million from the cuts. ",2013-01-09T01:41:28+0000

The relief director, John Ging, told reporters afterward that he feared that many residents in the isolated states, South Kordofan and Blue Nile, might be dying of malnutrition and disease, while others were subsisting on roots and leaves. This is 2013, and to think that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are living in such desperate and deplorable circumstances, and we cant get in to help them as humanitarian organizations, its just not acceptable, Mr. Ging said.

Where on earth have elections been so free as in Iran? he said in a speech in the holy city of Qom, reported by the state-run press. Watch out for your words not to dissuade people. His statement, coming five months before the vote for a successor to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, appeared to reflect the ayatollahs concern about repeating the chaotic aftermath of the 2009 election, in which Mr. Ahmadinejad, his favored candidate, won by a suspiciously lopsided margin that opponents said was fraudulent. Postelection protests escalated into the most serious challenge that the Islamic government had faced since it took power in the 1979 revolution. Mr. Ahmadinejads two challengers have remained under house arrest for the past few years. ",2013-01-09T02:20:31+0000

The stars and directors of contenders like Lincoln, Argo, Zero Dark Thirty, Silver Linings Playbook and Django Unchained have been making the rounds to drum up support. For some of them by Thursday afternoon it will be time to pack up the borrowed finery and the studio-approved talking points, and go home. For others it will be the next leg of the race: a six-week sprint to a finish line that involves potentially hefting a gold statuette on Feb. 24 and delivering an embarrassing (or sweet, or funny, or ideally, all three) acceptance speech. As a primer for those left standing  and entertainment for those following along  here are some memories of Oscar experiences from previous winners and nominees, excerpted from interviews at premieres and galas this season.

Design is escaping from functionalism, Ms. Beyerle said. Young designers are critical of industrial production. Included are projects by newcomers like Julien Carretero from France (his ladder, above right, which is made from oak excavated from a medieval Dutch city wall, will appear in a section devoted to concepts), but also work by established designers who have turned away from modernist strictures. Among the veteran offerings are Maurizio Galantes Cactus sofa for Cerruti Baleri (above left) and Studio Makkink & Beys Birdwatch cabinet (above center).

Of course, the accusation could be gossip; though I dont think it is. What is the best thing to do in this situation? NAME WITHHELD",2013-01-11T16:21:19+0000

(TMC) MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) Michelle Williams, above, in an Oscar-nominated role, steps into the pumps and pencil skirts of Marilyn Monroe, and Eddie Redmayne plays Colin Clark, a documentary filmmaker who claimed to have spent an intimate interlude with her in 1956 while they were making The Prince and the Showgirl. This film, an adaptation of his diaries, also features Kenneth Branagh, in another nominated role, as Laurence Olivier, Monroes co-star and director, whose infatuation and ego clashes with Monroe caused him to call her the stupidest, most self-indulgent little tart Ive ever come across. When the shoot went from bad to worse, he told her: Just be sexy. Isnt that what you do? Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, He didnt get Monroe, and she is similarly out of the grasp of this movie, adding: Ms. Williams tries her best, and sometimes thats almost enough. Shes too thin for the role, more colorlessly complected than creamy, but she whispers and wobbles nicely. Still, Ms. Dargis said: The problem isnt Ms. Williams or the serviceable work of the director, Simon Curtis, but a script by Adrian Hodges that hews faithfully to Clarks clichs. Instead of the complex woman familiar from the better books about her, the film offers a catalog of Monroe stereotypes: child, woman, smiling exhibitionist, shrieking neurotic, the barefooted free spirit and, lamentably, the martyr teetering in heels toward her doom. The tragic Monroe is obviously dramatic, but the intimations of disaster dont fit a movie that works so hard to be breezily, easily likable. ",2013-01-11T17:17:07+0000

The agreement was announced last summer by officials from the city, the Police Department and the Justice Department, after two years of investigations and negotiations. But in a sign that the matter may be far from settled, Judge Susie Morgan of Federal District Court acknowledged in her order that the city intended to file a motion to withdraw from the deal. In a statement, Mayor Mitchell J. Landrieu said he wanted to hold off on the pact because he objected to the millions of dollars the city may have to spend under a separate agreement pertaining to the city jail, which is currently being negotiated. We asked the judge to hold off on executing the police consent decree until the price tag of the prison consent decree is clear, Mr. Landrieu said. ",2013-01-12T05:17:03+0000

The hiring is in addition to the more than 8,100 combined hourly and salaried jobs Ford created in the United States in 2012, as the company increased production capacity and expanded engineering, manufacturing and other areas to meet the growing demand for its vehicles, the company said. About 1,000 of the positions are hourly jobs brought back to Ford plants in the United States from other locations, including Japan and Mexico. Ford said it was more than halfway to the 12,000 new jobs it committed to deliver in the United States by 2015 as part of its 2011 contract with the United Automobile Workers. As we expand our product lineup of fuel-efficient vehicles, we need more people in critical areas, such as in a range of engineering activities, vehicle production, computer software and other I.T. functions, to ensure we deliver the vehicles people want and value, Joseph R.

Mr. Pattinsons portrayal of a passionate, potentially dangerous husband capable of sexual rough play shifts the story into another world, said Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times. Mr. Condon works in that world fluidly, gilding it with a necessary sense of humor  Bella and Edwards white honeymoon bed glows as portentously as an altar for a sacrificial virgin  and imbuing it with a love and a gift for melodrama. He slathers on the music (melodrama comes from song or music drama), lets Ms. Stewart rock and the emotions roil. He resurrects the awkward teenage yearning that enlivened the first Twilight movie, but also transforms that initial, crude hunger into something deeper. Mostly, he brings Bella toward her happily-ever-after by giving this movie over to her, her dreams and her desires, as in a cosmic montage sequence worthy of The Tree of Life, but, you know, shorter. Edward may finally change Bella, but its Mr. Condon who resurrects her.",2013-01-12T06:00:06+0000

Over the course of their brief reunion, Hannah and Annie reveal the present while they talk about the past, and the film explodes with jittery, hand-held flashbacks to match their buried emotions.

us,Learn How Calipash Differs From Calipee,"The excuse for buying a dictionary of culinary terms, even if you already have one, is that the vocabulary keeps growing. Umami, for example, which The Diners Dictionary: Word Origins of Food & Drink says was coined in 1908, is still relatively new to the English-speaking world. And dulce de leche, the Argentine milk caramel, first appeared in English in 1923 but was not more commonly used until a good 80 years later. These are just two of more than 2,000 words or terms crammed into this compact volume. There are some surprising gaps, like acai, the popular Amazonian berry; or vadouvan, a kind of curry thats showing up on menus more often; or guanciale, the Italian cured pork cheeks. The perspective is more British than American, but what is offered is useful and fascinating. For example, who knew that there were not one but two terms for turtle meat: calipash and calipee, which refer to different parts of the animal? And that lambs wool was a warmed spiced beer with apple that Samuel Pepys mentioned as a nightcap in 1666?",2013-01-15T18:19:21+0000

Instead of filled bonbons, its signature is a small flavored square, the Nama, vaguely truffle-like and alluringly creamy. Green tea, bitter dark, mild milk and white are some of the options, all made with fresh cream from farms near the factory in Hokkaido, Japans northernmost region. The sliver of a boutique sells less than half of the varieties Royce makes, but they include novelties like potato chips covered with fromage blanc, cocoa-dipped marshmallows and flat chocolate squares called Prafeuille with gooey fillings of honey, berries and caramel. Ken Romaniszyn, the companys American partner and an owner of Lady M Cake Boutique uptown, said Royce, which was founded in 1983 andhas stores all over Asia, is poised to add two more shops in New York in the spring, on 40th Street opposite Bryant Park and on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village.

Its also made without the high-fructose corn syrup that is in most Heinz ketchup. Mutti, with headquarters in the Parma area, is an Italian giant that makes only canned tomato products. Its line has just been introduced in the United States and includes tins of juicy baby plum tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, tomato pure and rich, crushed tomato pulp  all worth having in the pantry, especially in winter.

The cheeses, called Hudson Flower, then age for about a month in Murrays caves. The smooth, tangy interior acquires a mellow, satiny rim, which is flattered by the edible, fragrantly piney herb-dusted rind.

In this lesson, students will become familiar with the layout of the NYTimes.com home page and learn how news and opinion articles are labeled and organized for clarity. Then students will carefully consider the difference between fact and opinion and create guiding questions to help discern between the two when reading a news or opinion piece from any news source. Finally, they will use their guiding questions to compare two pieces on the same news event, separating opinion from fact on the sentence level. ",2013-01-17T20:40:15+0000

The best you can say about the pictures Ginsberg took during two periods in which he dabbled in the medium  the 50s and early 60s and the 80s and 90s  is that they are the works of a competent amateur. The bigger disappointment, however, is that much of the history that Ginsberg lived through and did so much to alter as a countercultural activist is missing. ",2013-01-17T20:55:41+0000

Mariusz Kwiecien sings Belcore, Nemorinos swaggering rival, and Ambrogio Maestri is the potion-peddling salesman Doctor Dulcamara. Maurizio Benini conducted and Bartlett Sher directed this Great Performances at the Met presentation, which Anthony Tommasini, writing in The New York Times, called handsome and insightful. The productions contemporary element comes from showing the main characters engaged in a triangle of desire, distrust and gamesmanship, he said, adding: In her village Adina is like a prima donna, something Ms. Netrebko easily conveys.

After several hours of heated debate, 265 members of the 300-seat Parliament voted to set up a committee to determine whether Mr. Papaconstantinou should face criminal charges for tampering with the list or breach of duty. A 12-member committee of lawmakers has until Feb. 25 to submit its proposal to Parliament, which will then vote on whether to indict the former minister. Mr. Papaconstantinou has denied accusations that he removed the names of relatives from the list. Proposals to broaden the investigation to include other politicians were rejected.

us,Kenya: Study Details Poachers Toll," One of the worlds most closely watched elephant populations has been heavily hit by ivory poachers, scientists in Kenya said this week. In a study published Wednesday, scientists with the group Save the Elephants said that the proportion of illegally killed elephants in the Samburu area of northern Kenya had risen to more than 50 percent of all deaths and that the number of older elephants (which usually have the biggest tusks) declined drastically. Ivory demand and prices have reached a point at which poachers are willing to target well-protected, closely monitored populations, said Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the Elephants. This is now being replicated in other protected areas across Africa. Scientists estimate that tens of thousands of African elephants are being slaughtered each year, more than at any time in decades, to meet the rising demand for ivory in Asias rapidly growing economies.

He is the only English king, after the time of the Normans, who has never been placed within a royal tomb, Peter Ackroyd writes in Foundation, his rambling, affectionate new history of the remote English past. In September, archaeologists from the University of Leicester dug up a parking lot at the long-razed Greyfriars site and found, well preserved as if by a carefully wrapped shroud, the bones of a man whose skull had been hacked open and whose spine was curved, as Richards was said to have been.

Her most recent novel, How Should a Person Be?, is told from the perspective of Sheila, a young playwright eager to make art and attain fame, who is not to be confused with the author  at least not completely. For the Sheila of the novel, being famous is synonymous with being blessed. In a religious context, youre blessed because God watches over you, but in the secular context the biggest thing that could watch over you is everybody, Heti explained.

us,Louise Glcks Metamorphoses,"Poetry has always been the handmaiden of mythology, and vice versa. Sometimes poets are in the business of collecting and tweaking existing myths, as with Ovids Metamorphoses and the Poetic Edda. Other times poetry applies a mythological glamour to stories and characters from history, legend or even other myths (the hero of the Aeneid is a minor character from the Iliad). Then there are poets who equate the idea of myth with the supposedly irrational essence of poetry itself. Here is Robert Graves in 1948: No poet can hope to understand the nature of poetry unless he has had a vision of the Naked King crucified to the lopped oak, and watched the dancers, red-eyed from the acrid smoke of the sacrificial fires, . . . with a monotonous chant of Kill! kill! kill! and Blood! blood! blood!

He had told Allen Ginsberg he planned to marry her  the finest woman Ill ever know  once she had unshackled herself from her truck-driver husband, who, according to Joyce Johnson, was accustomed to slapping her around to keep her in line. In the meantime, Kerouac began an affair with Adele Morales (later to become the second Mrs. Norman Mailer). His failure to keep the rendezvous with Pauline, however, had nothing to do with affection for Adele; rather, he had overslept after a night of sex games with Luanne Henderson, whom Jacks muse Neal Cassady had married when she was 15, and who, according to their friend Hal Chase, was quite easy to get . . . into bed. The tryst had been engineered by Cassady, who was hoping to watch, Johnson says, to show Luanne, by then 18, how little she meant to him. Two days later, Kerouac called on Ginsberg and found Luanne covered with bruises from a beating Neal had given her. Johnson describes Kerouac as shocked by the sight; nevertheless, they all went out to hear bebop, partly financed by money stolen by Cassady. In response to being jilted, Pauline confessed her affair to her husband, who tried to burn her on the stove. Kerouac described her in his journal as a whore.

But the time they spent looking at themselves differed, depending on the day. Sunday Downtown was a time for leisurely strolling and reflecting on what they saw in the mirror.

But last week, a short poem, The Revolver, caught his attention. I said, Hey, this is as pertinent today as it was then, so I brought it to the librarians, said Mr. Gullerud, 83. After consulting with experts, the staff of the universitys Rare Book and Manuscript Library concluded that it was a genuine, unpublished and unknown work.

us,The Liberal Hour,"I naturally preferred my own version of President Obamas second inaugural to the speech he actually delivered yesterday, but the substance of the two was roughly similar. The president clearly feels that his re-election both reflects and ratifies a larger leftward shift in American politics: His address reached backward to ground this new progressive era in the American past, offered explicit nods to the demographic groups and constituencies whose present-day growth has made it possible, and then sketched out an agenda suited to a more left-of-center future  climate change legislation and green industrial policy, a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, the universalization of gay marriage, new gun control laws, etc. It was not a speech designed to co-opt opponents of this agenda, to put it mildly  particularlythose opponents whose control of the House of Representatives will make this agenda difficult to implement. But those of us who watched his negative, joyless re-election campaign and assumed that this president would begin his second term as a lame duck were only half-right. While theres still good reason to think that Obamas biggest legislative accomplishments are in the rearview mirror, the fact that he could win a clean victory despite the grim economic backdrop seems to have given him more confidence in the staying power of his coalition, and the continuing short-term impediments to his agenda in Washington seem to have liberated him to play for the longer term instead.",2013-01-22T23:34:11+0000

That experience left me with the lifelong desire to explore the power of religion to transform lives or destroy them. I became interested in Uganda, an intensely religious country that attracts many American missionaries and much funding from United States faith-based organizations. The American evangelical movement in Africa does valuable work in helping the poor. But as youll see in this Op-Doc video, some of their efforts and money feed a dangerous ideology that seeks to demonize L.G.B.T. people and intensifies religious rhetoric until it results in violence. It is important for American congregations to hold their churches accountable for what their money does in Africa. ",2013-01-23T01:11:19+0000

Interaction designers by training and novices to the fashion world, the two have started a clothing label that essentially eliminates the need for the creative vision of one person. Instead, theyve created software that puts that power in the hands of consumers, a process Huang calls fashion design for the Instagram generation. Shoppers logging on to constrvct.com can upload a photograph that will later be translated into a print, choose from a variety of basic silhouettes (the sheath dress is currently the most popular), then plug in their measurements. Three weeks later, a dress arrives in the mail, a time scale Huang estimate will be cut by two-thirds once the partners raise the funds to bring production in-house. Soon, pre-existing images will be available for selection, with royalties going to the artists who created them. And plans are afoot to add further customizing options like neckline, sleeve and hemline choices. We dont even need to make a pattern, Huang says. We can make the dress directly from the 3-D model.

The piece starts by acknowledging a connection that social conservatives often have reason to point out: The biggest reason why blue states often have lower out-of-wedlock birth rates than more conservative states is that the blue states have higher abortion rates, and the relative stability of the blue model of post-sexual revolution family life  which is really the upper middle class blue model, in which serial monogamy in your late teens and twenties is followed by late marriage and parenting  depends on a willingness to abort as well as a facility with contraception. But where pro-life writers like myself tend to raise this point in order to cast doubt on the comforting-but-dubious idea that liberal policies will inevitably lower the abortion rate, Cahn and Carbone invoke it to cast doubt on the idea that one can simultaneously be opposed to abortion and in favor of stable two-parent families. After all, if a willingness to abort helps keep out-of-wedlock birth rates low among well-educated blue staters, then surely opposition to abortion can plausibly be held responsible for the steady rise in single parent households in the rest of the country  and especially in white, conservative-tilting middle America:",2013-01-24T16:04:46+0000

Known as the Banana King, because of the wealth he earned as a fruit importer, Mr. Kekhman in recent years has seemed to focus more on the arts than on business. Officials with the Interior Ministry told the news agency Interfax that it had uncovered evidence that between 2010 and 2012 leaders of the Joint Fruit Company had used falsified contracts with fictitious businesses to obtain large loans from major banks. Investigators said Mr. Kekhman was not a target of the investigation. The Joint Fruit Company filed for bankruptcy last year after creditors sought repayment of the loans. Mr. Kekhman issued a statement saying that he was outraged by the fraud allegations against company officials and that he was cooperating with law enforcement. ",2013-01-25T04:13:34+0000

Until then, it was normal for clerks and bureaucrats to take two- or three-hour breaks in the middle of the workday. Many of them went home for lunch, took a nap, then returned to their offices, working into the evening to make up for lost time. The siesta used to be commonplace in Spanish-speaking countries, but the tradition was already waning as Latin Americas economies developed throughout the 80s and 90s. As companies and governments modernized, they adopted the same schedules as their counterparts in other countries.

Even mothers could not recognize the weathered corpses of their sons. In order to increase the chances that they would receive proper burials, soldiers bought customized name tags made of metal or wood. When pinned on the lapel or worn around the neck, a tag could help bring the dead soldier home.

The ostensible purpose of our trip was to fish the biggest remaining sockeye salmon run in the world and at the same time to make a case for opposing what would be the continents largest open-pit mine to be built atop said salmon run. But the more I tried to establish a narrative about this man, the more he broke up my effort with a kind of wilderness attention deficit disorder. No sooner had he hunched over to differentiate the identities of the shades of sage and white in the blooming tundra than he would hear the call of a ptarmigan. This in turn would lead to a discourse on the connection between migrations and snow melt and the desperation of grizzly bears in particularly snowy years. He was so profoundly knowledgeable, and everything he said felt incredibly nuanced and relevant. But at the same time his accounts were often tedious and circular and without any point that an impatient New Yorker could discern. ",2013-01-25T16:42:54+0000

The Church of England has raised concerns that it could be forced to conduct same-sex marriages against its will, but Ms. Miller said the bill would exempt clergy who have a conscientious objection from having to carry out the ceremonies.

In 2011, Germany temporarily held back half its contribution and threatened to hold back future funds in protest against inefficiencies, thefts by some grantee countries and infighting among the funds top executives. Other contributions dried up, forcing the fund to cancel a planned round of grants. Since then, both the funds executive director and inspector general have departed, and it was run for one year by a Brazilian banker; he devised an overhaul of the grant-making process that is to take effect next month. In November, Dr. Mark Dybul, the Bush administrations global AIDS czar, became the new executive director. The fund recently announced that it cut its operating expenses by 5 percent in 2012 while still making 26 percent more in grants than it did in 2011. Of the grants that had been audited, Dr. Dybul said, only 0.5 percent had been lost to fraud. The fund plans a new fund-raising round for later this year.

(Sundance) SECRETARY (2002) Maggie Gyllenhaal, right, portrays Lee Holloway, a repressed young secretary with masochistic tendencies and a stint in a mental hospital who blossoms during spanking sessions with her boss, E. Edward Grey (James Spader), a grim lawyer who prefers the typewriter to the computer. Spelling mistakes result in corporal punishment, and soon Edward, like a cruel Pygmalion, is telling Lee how to dress, answer the telephone and even eat. But his instructions help shape and direct her life  and his advances set her aflame. Secretary, directed by Steven Shainberg and adapted by Erin Cressida Wilson from a novella by Mary Gaitskill, could be seen as a slap in the face to orthodox feminist thinking, since the concept of sexual harassment doesnt seem to occur to anybody. Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. I prefer to see Secretary as a wacky new-wave romantic comedy in which two lonely people locked inside their private fantasies discover a miraculous erotic harmony. In todays post-Freudian, do-your-own-thing era of free sexual expression, the movie stands to be a wholesome self-help fable about the unlocking of shame and its magical transformation into pleasure and personal liberation.

Ten other defendants received suspended sentences. One of the six, Dr. Harmut Hopp, fled to Germany in 2011, and the German government has denied Chiles requests for his extradition.

He died in prison in 2010 while serving a 20-year sentence for the sexual abuse of 25 minors at the sects compound.

The result was the revolutionary Model T, a lightweight, durable and fast automobile that cost $850 at a time when the average car sold for more than $2,000. Soon the company was producing 1,000 cars a day. Taking its cue from the meatpacking industry, the company established the first automobile assembly line and controlled nearly half of the American car market. Ford, above with the Model T, also paid a $5 daily wage to reduce turnover, with strings attached. Immigrant workers had to attend the companys English-language schools, and inspectors from the sociological department would delve into their private lives. As Ford became one of the richest men in the world, he found his hatred for the wealthy elite increasing; he allied himself with the common people. But as his ego expanded, so did his anger. Ford blamed Jews for the countrys problems, bullied those who worked for him and displayed withering cruelty toward his only son, Edsel, who died at 49  a death many blamed on the unrelenting stress of trying to please his father.",2013-01-29T16:18:12+0000

Its lurid green-and-black cover featured a busty woman clutching a pistol, and its plot included the requisite car chases, explosions and sexual conquests. Unlike most paperbacks, though, this one attracted the attention of intelligence officers and diplomats on three continents. Set in the midst of Syrias civil war, the book offered vivid character sketches of that countrys embattled ruler, Bashar al-Assad, and his brother Maher, along with several little-known lieutenants and allies. It detailed a botched coup attempt secretly supported by the American and Israeli intelligence agencies. And most striking of all, it described an attack on one of the Syrian regimes command centers, near the presidential palace in Damascus, a month before an attack in the same place killed several of the regimes top figures. It was prophetic, I was told by one veteran Middle East analyst who knows Syria well and preferred to remain nameless. It really gave you a sense of the atmosphere inside the regime, of the way these people operate, in a way I hadnt seen before.",2013-01-30T10:00:50+0000

us,Tune in To | Rachel Zeffira,"Rachel Zeffira is nothing if not a lateral thinker. When she was 17, a bureaucratic error nearly resulted in her deportation from Britain and caused her to lose her place at a music school in London. So Zeffira, who is from Canada, reinvented herself as a 26-year-old substitute French teacher (a language I dont speak) and stayed in England until she raised enough money to continue her studies in Verona, Italy. Years later, when she and her bandmate from Cats Eyes, Faris Badwan (the frontman of the Horrors), were looking for a venue to play their first gig, she used the contacts shed made in Italy to secure an appearance at a Vatican Mass attended by several cardinals. I told them we were a choir, she says. They thought our backup singers looked a little too sexy. At the last minute we had to rush out and buy opaque tights and shawls. In her latest example of creative adaptation, the classically trained soprano and multi-instrumentalist has melded sacred music with a baroque pop sensibility on her debut solo album, The Deserters. It was released late last year in Britain (the North American release, on Paper Bag Records, is scheduled for March) and is earning rave reviews, with the BBC memorably describing it as tummy meltingly wonderful. Dreamy, seductive and sparse, The Deserters has a quiet lushness thats markedly different from the girl-group-tinged sound of Cats Eyes, though Zeffira hesitates to specify how. I like to leave it to the listener to describe the music, she says. I dont like it to be spelled out.",2013-01-30T14:00:04+0000

Pope Benedict, Marxist?","Like his predecessor John Paul II, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on the German phenomenologist Max Scheler, and wove a keen understanding of philosophical history into encyclicals like Fides et Ratio, Pope Benedict XVI also seems quite comfortable engaging in philosophical debate. Judging by his interactions with Jrgen Habermas, among others, one might assume that the Pope stands for a political and theological conservatism quite at odds with Marxist tradition. Yet they, and indeed Benedict himself might be surprised to find that, as a post at First Things explains, he evidently has his admirers on the left. Four Italian Ratzingerian Marxists of the Old Left have issued a manifesto hoping to enlist the Pope in their fight against a consumerist-inflected secularism. Strange bedfellows? Maybe not, considering that a few close readers of Benedicts 2007 encyclical Spe Salvi have noted that the Pope cites Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno to help refute the plausibility of the thesis that, with the waning of theistic belief, man himself is now called to establish justice.",2013-01-30T16:19:33+0000

Aleksei Pushkov, a Parliament member, said that Russia could afford to fight crime on its own.

Helen Mirren, left, portrays Rachel Singer, a celebrated Mossad operative who, with two other agents; her ex-husband, Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson); and David Peretz (Ciaran Hinds), captured and killed the Mengele-like Nazi fugitive Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen). Eventually the accepted account of Rachels actions begins to erode. Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas and Sam Worthington play the agents as young adults. The claustrophobic, unspoken bonds and rivalries that link Rachel, David and Stephan in their younger and older incarnations are overshadowed by Vogel and everything he represents, and a finely observed study of desire under duress gives way to a breathless and pedestrian globe-trotting thriller, A.

Given that we live in a time of eroding aesthetic boundaries and categories, when many curators are experimenting with integrative approaches in international biennials and commercial galleries, it seems past time for the folk-academic division to soften. It undoubtedly has at some institutions, especially those with modest collections. ",2013-01-31T13:00:09+0000

While military service is not a prerequisite to serving as defense secretary, previous secretaries who have served in the military have all been officers. I have no opinion on whether his enlisted background will make Mr. Hagel a better steward of the huge Pentagon bureaucracy and budget.

us,Short on Letters and Long on Hue,"These days we claim to want the natural, the simple, albeit with a Wi-Fi connection. Perhaps that explains building names like Azure, Platinum, Indigo, Jade and Blue. You could call it the Crayola method of apartment-house naming. Certainly the names are more down-to-earth than, say, the old-style Parc V and Capri. ",2013-01-31T23:02:29+0000
us,Feeling Right at Home on the Fringe,"The Outsider Art Fair, a wonderfully eccentric jewel in the crown of New York art fairs, has a renewed radiance. For the first time in its 20-year history, it occupies a building retrofitted for art: the clean, well-lighted spaces of the former Dia Art Foundation. This places it in the western reaches of Chelsea, once again confronting the world of contemporary insider art with irrefutable proof that the most lasting work comes from unstoppable emotional necessity, an especially useful lesson for the moment.

us,Addictive Soy Sauce With Ruinous Power,"You shouldnt think of the title of John Dies at the End as a spoiler in the conventional sense, thought there is a character named John and, well, you know. This movie, written and directed by Don Coscarelli and based on a novel by Jason Pargin (writing under the pseudonym David Wong), is not really about John (Rob Mayes), in any case, and is either entirely spoiler-proof or completely self-spoiling. It lays waste to linear narration, thematic coherence, psychological plausibility and just about everything else you might expect to encounter. It zigs, zags and trips over its own feet and on its own home-brewed hallucinogens. Its a ridiculous, preposterous, sometimes maddening experience, but also kind of a blast.
