us,Innocent Beauty,"During the mid-15th century, a Dominican cleric named Fra Angelico was assigned the task of decorating the priory of San Marco in Florence. In FRA ANGELICO AT SAN MARCO (Yale University, $60), William Hood, a professor of art history at Oberlin College, explores how the artist's piety was translated into a series of frescoes and an altarpiece that have long been cherished for their rich colors and innocent beauty. Mr. Hood argues that Fra Angelico brilliantly reconciled vastly different artistic influences. Outside of the cloister, the Renaissance was developing in Florence, and with it a host of new artistic techniques. However, Mr. Hood writes, Fra Angelico was constrained by centuries-old Dominican artistic traditions. With the aid of many well-chosen illustrations, more than 100 of which are reproduced in color, Mr. Hood shows how the artist selected, altered and combined various stylistic conventions to create his work. Fra Angelico's isolation from the artistic tumult of Florence gave him a certain independence, Mr. Hood maintains; the artist incorporated only those techniques that furthered his own purposes. With his careful research and vibrant, entertaining prose, Mr. Hood explicates Fra Angelico's paintings so that they seem fresh and luminous, and the reader can view the frescoes as vehicles for spiritual transformation.",1993-07-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Results Plus,"AUTO RACING Pepsi 400 to Earnhardt Dale Earnhardt dominated yesterday's Pepsi 400, holding off Sterling Marlin and Ken Schrader on a dramatic final lap at Daytona International Speedway. Schrader, who started last in the 41-car field, got to the lead on Lap 51 of the 160-lap race and battled at or near the front the rest of the 400-mile event. But Earnhardt, seeking his sixth Nascar Winston Cup championship, controlled the race, leading more than half the laps. Earnhardt, who took the lead for the final time on Lap 132, was just ahead of Schrader, with Marlin close behind him, at the start of the final trip around the 2 1/2-mile oval. As the leaders drove off Turn 2 and onto the backstretch, Schrader went to the high side and tried to get past the leader, but Earnhardt's car was loose and the two banged together, giving Marlin a chance to move up alongside Schrader. That's the way it finished, with Earnhardt's Chevrolet Lumina crossing the finish line about two car lengths ahead and Marlin's Ford Thunderbird just in front of Schrader's Chevy. Earnhardt averaged 151.755 miles an hour in the race, which was slowed by six caution flags for a total of 23 laps. He won $75,940. (AP) BOXING Moon Defends Flyweight Title Sung-kil Moon of South Korea successfully defended his World Boxing Council super flyweight title yesterday by winning a split decision over Carlos Salazar of Argentina in a bloody 12-round bout in Seoul, South Korea. Confusion marked the seventh round when a towel was hurled into the ring. Moon's trainers denied they hurled the towel. Moon was bleeding from a deep cut near his right eye, and the referee checked him and allowed him to continue. Two judges scored the fight for Moon, 116-111 and 116-112. Another gave it to Salazar, 115-114. (AP) GOLF Price Still in Control Nick Price retained a two-shot lead in the Western Open at Lemont, Ill., after the day-late second-round finishers posted their scores yesterday morning. Price had a 135 total, nine under par, after a 71 on Friday. Greg Norman, four times a runner-up in this event, gained a share of second place after 36 holes, but Grant Waite's bid collapsed under a final-hole double bogey. Norman and Waite, a New Zealander and a recent winner of the Kemper Open in Maryland, were among the 51 players who were stranded by darkness Friday night after second-round play was interrupted by a 3 3/4-hour storm delay. They marked their positions and returned to the still-wet Dubsdread course at Cog Hill shortly after daylight to complete their rounds. Waite, who had three holes to play, was eight under par for the tournament and was only one back of Price's 36-hole pace. Waite, however, bogeyed his first hole, the 16th, and chopped up the 18th. He missed the green, chipped well short of the pin and three-putted for a double bogey. That finished off a 71 and dropped him back to 139, four off the pace going into third-round play this afternoon. Norman was seven under par with two holes to play when he returned, and he parred in for a bogey-free 68 that tied him for second at 137. ""I played solid, but I'm not making the putts I'd like,"" said Norman, who didn't make a putt longer than 10 feet. Half his four birdies came on par-5's which he reached in two. ""The course is squishy,"" he said, ""and the greens could be bad by the end of the third round."" They could be much more squishy by that time. The weather forecast called for more thundershowers.

Fleming started chest compression and Jason Hamilton performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on Raymond Henzler, 63, when they found him lying in a fairway adjacent to the seventh green. ""I just reacted to a situation,"" Fleming said. ""The guy's helpless. It's not a question -- you just go out and do those things. It wasn't even a decision,"" she said.

Life Before Unisex","Before barbershops turned into beauty salons and stylists became celebrities, a good barber could be measured by the number of shaving mugs he had on display over his sink. In turn-of-the-century America, men personalized their mugs to reflect their place in the world. When you went in for your twice-weekly shave, your barber plucked your shaving mug off the shelf. You stepped up into the oak and leather barber chair, a throne for the middle class, and were pampered in a manner that would soon be nearly extinct. Today, shaving mugs are collectibles, selling for as much as $3,000 apiece. Barber chairs are cold chrome. The neighborhood barber is unlikely to have worked his way up from apprentice. In THE VANISHING AMERICAN BARBER SHOP: An Illustrated History of Tonsorial Art, 1860-1960 (Windmill Publishing Company, 2147 Windmill View Road, El Cajon, Calif. 92020, paper, $16.95), Ronald S. Barlow bemoans the loss and gives scavengers some hints about how to make money from the remnants. He pays tribute to a gentlemanly era of high-quality tools and pride in a job well done, but the book itself is a slapdash effort, too long in some places, too short in others. Mr. Barlow, the author of ""The Vanishing American Outhouse,"" includes a rapid history of the barber's profession, and the book is nicely illustrated, with vintage photographs and excerpts from barber-school manuals and barber-supply catalogues. ""The Vanishing American Barber Shop"" makes a persuasive case for barbering as an everyday art in its twilight. But the book leaves the impression that it is basically a shopping list for collectors.",1993-07-11T05:00:00+0000

She argues that the ""problem is that the injury of rape lies in the meaning of the act to its victim, but the standard for its criminality lies in the meaning of the act to the assailant."" That is, it may look, smell and feel like rape, but if the rapist doesn't think it is, it isn't.

us,BUSINESS DIARY,"COMPANIES Apple Computer, All Alone and Shrinking Fast Apple Computer was, and is, a one-of-a-kind company. But while uniqueness was its glory when it burst forth from that proverbial garage, its separateness now is an increasing liability. As Microsoft and Intel barrel ahead in creating a standard for business computing, Apple is going it alone -- and showing the scars. John Sculley, who just gave up the chief executive's reins, has even pondered a merger with I.B.M. or A.T.& T. Last week, Apple revealed its latest wound, saying it would cut 2,500 workers, or 16 percent of its payroll. And the new chief executive, Michael Spindler, froze the pay of those who remain -- unless they're vice presidents or higher, who got a 5 percent cut. When Apple announces its earnings this week, the job-cut damage could hit $300 million, and mean a quarterly loss. Many eyes now are on the fruits of a joint venture with I.B.M. and Motorola, a line of computers due next year. [ Page 10. ] New Hope at Northwest Air The airline industry has been on a pendulum in recent years. Saddled with high costs, airlines have swung in and out of bankruptcy, with bankrupt carriers, out for quick cash, igniting repeated fare wars. But last week Northwest just may have taken a step toward breaking that cycle, striking a deal with its pilots that could head off what had seemed a likely bankruptcy. The pact involves big concessions from both sides -- pilots give up $365 million in pay and work-rule changes over three years, but the unions could end up owning 37.5 percent of the company. Now the machinists need to go along, and the Administration is watching keenly -- Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, in fact, called managers and labor leaders to Washington to push things along. Any pact would put pressure on the industry's Big Three -- American, United and Delta -- to cut costs, too. And if the pact holds, of course, the bad news for travelers is that fare-war bonanzas are a bit less likely. Euro and Disney Don't Mix How do you say ""Magic Kingdom"" in French? Maybe the answer is that you don't. Euro Disney said last week that it lost $87 million in its latest quarter -- more than expected -- and saw no end in sight to the bad results. Europe's decidedly unmagical economy these days just doesn't seem to fit Euro Disney's script, and the resort even expects a loss for the peak summer season. To top it off, it now appears that completion of the resort's second phase, a movie-based theme park, will be delayed another year, until 1997. You Break It, You Pay for It If you run a company badly, you should pay -- right out of your own pocket. That was New Jersey's message last week as it sued three dozen former executives and directors of Mutual Benefit Life, saying their mismanagement had plunged the insurer into insolvency and that they should be liable for $1 billion in losses. Mutual Benefit was taken over by the state in 1991, after years of heavy investment in real estate and other speculative ventures, and most of its 700,000 policyholders are still waiting to be made whole. There are some big names among those sued: Richard Furlaud, former American Express chairman; Leon Hess, owner of the New York Jets, and Christopher Bond, the Missouri Senator. For Keating, Double the Pain Elderly investors whose savings vanished after they bought American Continental junk bonds would probably like to pull out Charles Keating's fingernails one by one, sloooowly and paaaainfully. But they'll have to be satisfied with this: Last week a Federal judge in Los Angeles, deciding that sentencing guidelines just didn't fit crimes so ""staggering in proportion,"" doubled the recommended amount. She sentenced Mr. Keating, 69, who is already serving a state prison term, to 12 years and 7 months in Federal prison for defrauding investors. She also ordered him to pay $122.4 million in restitution to the Government, but it'll be hard getting blood from this particular stone: Mr. Keating insists that he's broke. But lest we forget that no man could wreak such havoc alone, here's the last word: ""What happened,"" asked a lawyer for bondholders, to ""all the public officials who looked the other way?"" A Farewell to The Post? Has anything been clear at The New York Post lately? An odd parade of would-be owners come and go with dizzying frequency. An editor-for-a-day sets up shop in a diner. Rupert Murdoch saves the day -- then doesn't quite. For now, though, this much is clear: Mr. Murdoch, unable to strike a deal with the unions to cut costs, pulled the plug on Friday. Now, with no new bidder in sight, the paper has no owner but the bankruptcy court, which is unlikely to keep publishing at a weekly loss of $300,000. So, after 192 years, is this an obituary? Again, unclear. ""It's over,"" said Mr. Murdoch's spokesman. But a lawyer for the paper's creditors said, ""Murdoch has not closed the door."" So at press time on Friday, the muddle was as thick as ever. THE ECONOMY When in Doubt, Buy a Car The economy still looks shaky, and on the horizon loom higher taxes, not high times. But some things cannot wait. Americans have to have their wheels, and when the old car starts to wheeze -- you know, the one you would have traded in two years ago if it hadn't been for the recession -- it's off to the showroom. So while most economic signposts point downward, car sales keep climbing, with Detroit's Big Three last week reporting a 10 percent rise in June. Imports fared less well, though, as drivers increasingly turn to domestic models, with Chevrolet's Cavalier steadily gaining ground and Honda's Accord, the king of the road a year ago, falling further behind. Today's buyers are determined to root out the best value, and these days they are finding it in Detroit. If It's Hot, This Must Be the Mall Is there anything good about a heat wave? (Or are you too hot to think about it?) Answer: It could just help the economy. Look at it this way: last week an index showed that retail sales rose 5.6 percent, the fourth straight monthly increase, with leading department stores showing the biggest gains. And that was for June. Just think what the July numbers will bring. After people hide in air-conditioned movie theaters until the managers eject them, where do you think they go? Why, the air-conditioned mall, of course. And what do they do in that one-climate-fits-all oasis? They whip out their little plastic cards, and they spend, spend, spend. Those July numbers, if we survive to see them, could go through the roof. The Rich Get Healthier It's no surprise that the rich are healthier than the poor, but a Government study out last week shows that the rich, by comparison, are rapidly getting even healthier. In fact, between 1960 and 1986, the inequality in death rates more than doubled, according to the data, published in The New England Journal of Medicine. It reached the point that those with family income below $9,000 had more than triple the death rate of those above $25,000. And it's not just that affluence buys more health care -- that's always been true. Much of the difference lies in the tendency of more affluent, better-educated people to take better care of themselves, whether through diet, exercise or quitting smoking. Remember Gold? It's Back Gold is hard to define. Is it more like a pork belly, or more like cash in the mattress? It's both, of course, which makes investing in it tricky indeed. Beyond its jewelry value, at politically stormy times people see it as a haven for cash -- on the theory, presumably, that governments come and go, but gold is forever. It fell out of favor in recent years, though, partly because there was just too much gold around after Russia dumped tons of it on the market when the Soviet Union collapsed. But suddenly, because of falling production, there's less supply than the market demands, and gold has rallied and is a hot investment again. Last week, in fact, it neared the $400-an-ounce level, for the first time in almost three years, after being as low as $325 last fall. It may soon be time to search the dresser drawers again for those old gold rings and cash them in. The Name's Chicago, Pardner What if the New York Stock Exchange were called, say, the Northeast Stock Exchange? Sounds imprecise, doesn't it? A bit mushy even. Not the strong, crisp image the times demand. That must have been what the folks at the Midwest Stock Exchange were thinking last week when they went back to a name they'd used in simpler times: the Chicago Stock Exchange. In 1949, the exchange took the Midwest name after absorbing regional exchanges in St. Louis, Cleveland and Minneapolis-St. Paul. But since then, the city's name has gained global force with the rise of powers like the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. And now the stock exchange, the nation's largest outside New York, hopes to cash in on some of that new magic. INTERNATIONAL The World Still Has Problems Leaders of seven powerful nations put their heads together in Tokyo last week to tackle the world's economic problems. The problems survived, pretty much unscathed. The mighty seven did agree to a quick $3 billion in aid to Russia, but that aid was mainly just a rearranging of prior commitments. What's new is that it will get to its target more quickly, and its focus will be on transforming state companies. And newly private industries, President Clinton predicted, his finger solidly on the domestic pulse, will eventually provide ""a huge new market for American goods and services."" The leaders also vowed to ""curb protectionism in all its manifestations"" -- a hot topic as America and Japan haggle over their hefty trade imbalance.",1993-07-11T05:00:00+0000

It Was the Pits Rusty Wallace, with the aid of a quick pit stop, won the Slick 50 300, the inaugural Nascar Winston Cup race, yesterday at New Hampshire International Speedway yesterday in Loudon, N.H. The crew of the Penske Racing South team took advantage of the last of six caution flags in the 300-lap race as Wallace went into the pits second to Davey Allison and came out in front. The green flag came out for the final time three laps later, on Lap 274, and Wallace kept his Pontiac Grand Prix in front the rest of the way as pole-starter Mark Martin got past Allison to take the runner-up spot on the 1.058-mile oval. Most fans in the crowd of more than 60,000 were on their feet as Wallace, who has walked away from two crashes this season, took the checkered flag for his fifth victory of the year and the 26th of his career. (AP) Tracy Beats Fittipaldi and Mansell to Finish: Paul Tracy slipped past Nigel Mansell on the 15th lap and led the rest of the way for his second career Indy car victory, beating Penske teammate Emerson Fittipaldi and Mansell to the finish line of the Cleveland Grand Prix by about 30 seconds. Tracy had won the pole but lost the advantage to Mansell immediately, while several cars farther back in the field collided on the hairpin turn at the start. The collision ended the day for the local favorite, Bobby Rahal, and Roberto Guerrero, but no serious injuries were reported. After a five-lap caution flag was lifted, Tracy soon regained the lead from Mansell on that same hairpin turn and led for the rest of the 85-lap race on the 2.369-mile, 10-turn temporary road course at Burke Lakefront Airport, averaging 127.913 miles an hour.

The Atlanta-based carrier said the projected layoffs stemmed from an expected decline in flights. Delta, the nation's third-largest airline, is struggling to return to profitability after posting losses of more than $1.2 billion in the last two and a half years.

Dancing is Good for the Crops","Shadeh, the word for dance in the language of the Tewa, a Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, translates literally as ""to be in the act of waking up."" The extraordinary images in NATIVE AMERICAN DANCE: Ceremonies and Social Traditions (Smithsonian Institution/Starwood, cloth, $45; paper, $24.95), edited by Charlotte Heth, a music scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles, illustrate how dance serves as a means for ethnic and spiritual awakening. Dance fuses past and present for peoples as diverse as the Aymara in Bolivia, where youngsters still perform the Qhashwa on frosty nights to protect the potato crop, and the Kiowa in Oklahoma, where veterans of Operation Desert Storm perform dances at meetings of the Black Legs Society. Unfortunately, the accompanying essays, written by scholars and curators, fail to match the impact of the photographs and presume a working knowledge of American Indian cosmology and history. The authors tend to dwell on esoteric matters, like variations in costume. The best essays, like that on Northern Plains dances by Lynn Huenemann, an Indian education official in Iowa, make a point of quoting performers, who tell how dancing can heal sickness and protect crops; their words make the magical seem part of everyday life. As a Lakota singer and dancer explains: ""Going to dances is good fun, and also, dancing can make your disposition good. If someone does not do this, I do not know why he is on this earth.""",1993-07-18T05:00:00+0000

In the Nov. 23, 1985, hijacking of the flight from Athens to Cairo, gunmen seized the plane and forced it to land in Malta. When demands for fuel were rebuffed, they shot five passengers in the head. Two women, an American and an Israeli, died. The 58 other passengers were killed in an inept storming of the plane by Egyptian commandos.

Perhaps the story of the two brothers, both kings, who found that their wives were unfaithful, took bloody vengeance, and set out into the world to travel until they found someone less fortunate than they were. They encountered a demon who kept a woman in a glass chest with four locks; she came out while he slept and showed them 98 rings she had collected from chance lovers and insisted on having sex with the princes to make it a round 100. The princes decided that the demon was more unfortunate than they were and returned to their kingdoms. There the elder brother, Shahrayar, still angry over his wife's betrayal, instituted a reign of terror, marrying a virgin each day and handing her to his vizier for execution at dawn. The vizier's daughter Shahrazad, a woman both wise and learned, beseeched her father to give her to the king. On the wedding night, the bride asked that her younger sister, Dinarzad, might sleep under the bed, so that when the king had ""finished with Shahrazad,"" the younger girl, as the sisters had agreed, might ask Shahrazad to tell a story to while away the time until dawn. When dawn came, the story was not finished, and the curious king stayed execution for a night. Shahrazad continued to tell tales, which gave rise to other tales, all of which were unfinished at dawn. The king's narrative curiosity kept Shahrazad alive, day after day. She narrated a stay of execution, a space in which she bore three children. And in the end, the king removed the sentence of death, and they lived happily ever after.",1993-07-18T05:00:00+0000

'Read This,' Panted the Overworked Hack","Lee Server's DANGER IS MY BUSINESS: An Illustrated History of the Fabulous Pulp Magazines (Chronicle, cloth, $27.50; paper, $17.95) takes a nostalgic look at the predecessors of the modern comic book -- publications like Weird Tales and Ranch Romances, fiction periodicals printed on cheap stock whose low quality gave the genre its name in the 1920's and 30's. Mr. Server covers everything from soft-core pornography, in which breasts were never breasts but ""creamy bonbons,"" ""firm little tiddlywinks"" or ""perky pretty-pretties,"" to hard-boiled detective thrillers, in whose vernacular guns never fired but ""belched chow-chow,"" ""coughed ka-chow"" or ""sneezed ker-choob."" Also included are superheroes, mad scientists, vivisectionists, deformed maniacs and giant amoebas -- the creations of the hack writers who routinely produced as many as 15,000 words a day. Mr. Server has chosen well from the magnificent covers of the pulps -- lurid temptresses slipping stilettos from their garter belts, insane scientists plunging hypodermic needles into the arms of helpless beauties, nefarious aviators dodging the tracers of ace pilots.

us,Sweat -- Manual Laborers of the (Mostly Third) World: A Gallery of Portraits,"The eyes do not invite pity. Smiling or quizzical or unblinkingly direct, they give little away -- neither what they have seen nor what they have endured. The worker in a motorcycle factory in Madras, India (below), may look like an enigmatic Darth Vader, but the protective mask is of his own devising. After polishing a gearbox part, he blasts metallic debris free with pressurized air, and safety masks are not a standard issue. By comparison, the peasant women of the sea in Galicia, Spain (opposite, top), have an almost idyllic job. Every October at low tide, they wade into the water near the coast, harvesting shellfish for two to three months. A tea picker in a plantation high in the mountains of Rwanda (page 35) may labor in an area that is strikingly beautiful. But it can get cold and wet up there, and a child has to work like an adult filling his basket with tea leaves. In Brazil, a new class of migrant labor has arisen, known as boias-frias, or cold food, so named because workers in the cities are picked up by truck in the morning and taken to sugar cane fields, where they have a cold meal at lunchtime; at night they are driven back to the cities. The women have one of the hardest jobs. Following carts from which stalks are dropped, they chop the sugar cane and then plant the cuttings in trenches. To salute these and other laborers of the world, the Brazilian-born photojournalist Sebastiao Salgado recently completed an epic project: ""Workers: An Archeology of the Industrial Age."" With an accompanying catalogue published by Aperture, the exhibition of 250 photographs is traveling to several American cities at the same time that it is being shown in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Six years in the making, ""Workers"" documents the often fearful, sometimes wondrous and always elemental nature of sweat-from-the-brow labor.",1993-07-25T05:00:00+0000

Unlike other sins, however, despair is by tradition the sole sin that cannot be forgiven; it is the conviction that one is damned absolutely, thus a repudiation of the Christian Saviour and a challenge to God's infinite capacity for forgiveness. The sins for which one may be forgiven -- pride, anger, lust, sloth, avarice, gluttony, envy -- are all firmly attached to the objects of this world, but despair seems to bleed out beyond the confines of the immediate ego-centered self and to relate to no desire, to no thing.

In a lopsided final, the top-seeded Spanish team, led by Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez, dominated the unseeded Australians, who were seeking their first title since 1974. Martinez, ranked sixth in the world, beat Michelle Jaggard-Lai, 6-0, 6-2, to put Spain ahead. Then Sanchez Vicario, No. 3 in the world, defeated Nicole Provis, 6-2, 6-3, to give Spain an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the best-of-three series. Spain won the title for the first time in 1991, defeating the United States in the final. (AP) Mansdorf Wins Newsweek Classic: Amos Mansdorf of Israel used a strong baseline game to stymie seventh-seeded Todd Martin, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5, in the championship of the $625,000 Newsweek Classic in Washington. Mansdorf, seeded eighth and ranked 29th in the world, won for the sixth time in his career and for the first time since 1990. He earned $84,000 for the victory. (AP) Gustafsson Solves Stich: Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden overcame Michael Stich's remarkable run of success in his home country, outlasting the German, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 6-4, to capture the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart. In the last eight months, Stich has reached the finals of five tournaments in Germany, winning three titles, including the Grand Slam Cup in Munich. (AP) SOCCER Bolivia Stuns Brazil in World Cup Qualifier Brazil, one of the giants of international soccer, was jolted by Bolivia, 2-0, yesterday in La Paz, Bolivia, in a South American World Cup qualifying match. Bolivia, which has not made the World Cup since 1950, scored twice in the final three minutes in what is surely the country's biggest soccer victory. Brazil, which won the World Cup in 1958, 1962 and 1970, had gone 22-0-6 since it beat Chile, 2-0, in 1954 in its first World Cup qualifying game. The victory moved Bolivia to the top of the South American Group B standing with a 2-0-0 record. Brazil is 0-1-1, having tied Ecuador in its previous game. Also in Group B, Jose Herrera's goal early in the second half lifted Uruguay to a 1-0 victory over Venezuela in San Cristobal, Venezuela. The winner of Group B advances to next year's World Cup finals in the United States. The second-place finisher will play against either Canada or Australia for another spot in the finals. (AP) GOLF Azinger Triumphs in New England Classic Paul Azinger, hitting his shots with exquisite precision, fired a three-under-par 68 yesterday to win the New England Classic in Sutton, Mass., by four strokes. His total of 16-under 268 for the four rounds was one shot off the tournament record set in 1985 by George Burns. Azinger won $180,000 to pass $1 million in winnings for the year, second over all on the PGA Tour to Nick Price. (AP) Archer Beats Colbert in Playoff: George Archer shot a record-tying eight-under-par 63 to force a playoff, then parred the third extra hole to beat Jim Colbert and win the Senior PGA Tour's First of America Classic in Grand Rapids, Mich. Archer, 53, is the first back-to-back winner on the Senior Tour this year. He also won last week's rain-shortened Ameritech Senior Open. On the third extra hole, the 398-yard par-4 18th, Archer hit his tee shot under a tree on the left side of the fairway, but made a daring second shot and was able to scramble for a par. (AP) Thirty Years Later, Charles Returns to Scene of Victory: Thirty years after winning the British Open on the same course, Bob Charles of New Zealand claimed the seniors' version with a birdie at the final hole in Lytham St. Annes, England. Charles carded a 74, three-over par at the Lytham and St. Annes course in rainy and windy conditions to finish four rounds seven-over at 291. He won his first British Senior Open by stroke over Gary Player of South Africa and Tommy Horton of England. (AP) AUTO RACING Teammate's Mishap Gives Prost Victory Alain Prost of France won the German Grand Prix in Hockenheim after trailing for most of the race until hard-luck teammate Damon Hill blew a tire on his Williams-Renault with two laps remaining. It was Prost's seventh Formula One victory this season and 51st over all -- extending his career record on the circuit. (AP) HORSE RACING Liver Stand by a Nose in Evan Shipman Liver Stand prevailed by a nose over Excellent Tipper in the $60,000-added Evan Shipman for New York-breds at Belmont yesterday. Bill Of Rights finished another four lengths back in third in the field of five. Under Jorge Chavez and 117, Liver Stand held a narrow advantage throughout to cover the 11/16 miles in 1:423/5 over a fast track. The Stanley Shapoff-trained colt earned his second victory of six starts this year and $39,720 for owner Mine Hill Stable. The winner returned $22.80, $7 and $4 for $2 across the board.

The $140,000 Ferrari Testarossa, the prize for anyone setting a world record in Sestriere, Italy, at Europe's highest track -- 6,000 feet -- went unclaimed yesterday for the fifth consecutive year. Plenty of big names tried, including Sergei Bubka, Kevin Young and Quincy Watts. But it was Jackson who came the closest to winning the car as he won in 12.97 seconds, just 0.05 off the world record of 12.92 set by Roger Kingdom in 1989. Running against a headwind of 1.6 meters a second, the Welshman became only the third man to break the 13-second barrier. He broke his European record of 13.04, set last year in Cologne, Germany. Bubka won the pole vault, clearing 19 feet 1/4 inch. He barely missed at a world-record attempt at 20-1 3/4, hitting the bar with his arms after clearing it with the rest of his body. Young, an American, won the 400 hurdles in 48.20. Watts, another Olympic champion from the United States, won the 400 in 44.13 seconds, the third best time of the year.

""It shows that I can beat the good players when they play bad,"" Pernfors said after dispatching the world's second-ranked player. Courier, 22, in his first tournament since losing the Wimbledon final to Pete Sampras, turned in a lackluster third-round match after defeating a fellow American, Jeff Tarango, in his opening match on Tuesday. ""Everything was wrong,"" Courier said. ""Mikael played very well and let me beat myself."" Pernfors's upset, a surprise in a tournament that was holding close to form, came in the early afternoon, just before heavy rain forced a short delay in play. Another upset followed the delay, with Todd Martin, seeded 13th, eliminating third-seeded Boris Becker, 7-5, 7-6 (7-3). (AP) Haarhuis Knocks Out Brugera: Paul Haarhuis ousted the top-seeded Sergi Brugera by 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 yesterday to advance to the quarterfinals of the Dutch Open clay court championship in Hilversum, the Netherlands.

The defending champion, Jay Haas, and Davis Love 3d each shot 65's, and Scott Gump, Michael Allen and Neal Lancaster shot 66's. Bradley, who joined the PGA Tour this year and has missed the cut in three of his last five tournaments, got off to a quick start with birdies on the first three holes and four of the first five. Haas won last year with a 21-under-par 263 and tied for third in 1991 over the 7,006-yard Tournament Players Club at Southwind.

Goetz had nine birdies and five bogeys. Johnson, of Wales, had only one bogey and claimed a share of the lead by sinking a 10-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole. Nine golfers, including the Hall of Famer Pat Bradley, were bunched at 69.

Lewis was third in 10.22 behind another American, Jon Drummond, who led for most of the race before a sellout crowd of 14,797 at the Gateshead International Stadium and finished in 10.12. Christie and Lewis were guaranteed $150,000 apiece. Christie, 33 years old, was faster out of the blocks than Lewis and was a meter clear of his 32-year-old rival at the line after overtaking Drummond in the last 20 meters. Calvin Smith, a former world record-holder, was fourth in 10.33. Lewis said he was affected by a slow start, but Christie said Drummond's stunning speed off the blocks inspired him to victory. It was the first time Lewis and Christie had met since the 1991 world championships final in Tokyo, which Lewis won in a world-record time of 9.86, with Christie fourth in a European-record 9.92. Both marks still stand. Despite Christie's triumph, Lewis holds a 12-2 lead in their head-to-head races.
