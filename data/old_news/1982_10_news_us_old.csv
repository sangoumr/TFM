Now we want to put my house, which I owned with my first husband, into our joint names. But we're concerned that we may lose the right to claim the $125,000 exclusion on the house should we later sell it. Is our concern justified? A.

Answer: The Westchester County Rent Guidelines Board says you appear to have a legitimate complaint. The rent for any parking spaces reserved for rent-stabilized apartments is regulated by the same guidelines that govern the apartments themselves. As with apartments, these rents cannot be arbitrarily readjusted before the new guideline adjustment date. The current guidelines, which are still in effect because the board has not yet agreed on new ones for the year that began Friday, are 12, 15, and 18 percent for one- , two- and three-year leases, respectively.

STUTTGART, West Germany -One thing that can be said for certain about the past weeks' turmoil in West German politics is that the iconoclastic and uncompromising Greens are steadily gaining influence and, in their refusal to strike a deal with a more established party of any stripe, threaten to become a destabilizing force in the new era of German politics emerging today. But it was also clear in these confused weeks that it is not too late for the mainstream parties to regain the confidence of the younger generation - not by using Green vocabulary and not by the politics-as-usual that often passes for leadership in West Germany but by plain-speaking and realistic leadership. We Germans need to strip our politics of the moralism and emotionalism that marks both the Greens and the mainstream parties.","The Greens are a loose coalition of environmental, feminist and antiwar groups who base their views on the futurist literature associated with the international scholars' and businessmen's Club of Rome and its concern for the limits to growth. The Greens feel that the mainstream parties do not address the real problems of West Germany and believe that a fundamental change is needed. Romantic and nonmaterialist, they attract young people who share their criticism of industrial society and deep, sometimes fanatical aversion to nuclear energy - although the Soviet SS-20 missiles pointing toward German cities do not seem to be regarded as a threat.",1982-10-03T05:00:00+0000

THE HOW,WHEN AND WHY OF TELLING CHILDREN ABOUT SEX","PARENTS hope their children will exercise good judgment about everything. Considerable effort goes into providing children with the information and values necessary for good judgment in such matters as school work, chores, dressing, driving and friendship, but sex education is frequently given scant attention. Nevertheless, parents have the expectation that the same thoughtful process will be used with respect to decisions regarding sexuality.

It has been done with the help of live-wire salesmanship and a brash young discipline called acoustical science, whose lack of consistent success in solving the basic problems of music-listening in enclosed areas still does not argue convincingly for its maturity. Not that these scientists have been deprived of experimental opportunities. I myself, while not attempting to mark every sparrow's fall in this particular field, have been able to attend the openings of more than 20 halls in various American cities, most of them new structures but about a third of them remodeled older theaters. In a few instances, such as Philharmonic (now Avery Fisher) Hall, the New York State Theater and Chicago's Orchestra Hall, corrective surgery in several expensive stages has been deemed necessary to remedy acoustical defects. All this building and rebuilding activity has been episodic, coming in surges whose periodicity probably could be charted by a good astrologer or stock-market analyst. Last month, for instance, was a particularly active time, with champagne being broken across the bows of no less than five important halls - six, if you count the acoustical retouching of the New York State Theater.",1982-10-03T05:00:00+0000

Unemployment is high, even though it is lower than the national average. In August, the latest figures available, Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 7.7 percent, while the nation's was 9.8 percent.

The covers of other, more mainstream periodicals, such as Good Housekeeping, Delineator, Collier's and Ladies' Home Journal, to name a few, were often intriguing, stylized paintings by leading illustrators. By today's standards, these covers had only a minimum of typography to interfere with the integrity of the art; their purpose was more esthetic than commercial. At this time many cultural, satirical and political journals with relatively small circulations were also being published, particularly in Germany and France. Their covers employed innovative typographical designs and illustrational approaches, reflecting the graphic concerns of the avant-garde and the contributions of such painters as Juan Gris, George Grosz, Salvador Dali, Joan Miro and Fernand Leger.",1982-10-10T05:00:00+0000

us,ROUNDUP OF THE USUAL SUSPECTS,"WHENEVER I think about how I started writing, I quickly focus upon the house I lived in from the age of roughly 7 to the time, less than a decade later, I was sent off to boarding school. ''To the manor born,'' not ''manner,'' is how I always thought Hamlet's phrase was written - thus shifting the emphasis to heritage, the silver spoon, and away from heredity, the shiver of sperm. The house still stands, a Southern-colonial affair, red brick, white pillars and close to an acre of lawns and eclectic gardens: a vine with figs; a cork tree; a tree that bloomed with hard, pink berries, like French peppercorns; a eucalyptus, whose long leaves moved like canoes across the surface of the pool. California. When we bought the house - from the actress Mary Astor - there were lemon groves on three sides, stretching for blocks. The air, of course, smelled lemony and even looked gilded with reflected light. The neighborhood kids would help pick the fruit, at least from the lower branches, and pack the harvest into wooden crates that sprang up overnight at curbside in front of the mansions. We used to bite holes in the skin and suck out the juice and pulp, licking our wrists for salt.

us,SONNY MAE MORTGAGES IN THE HOPPER,"ABOUT 300 Westchester and Rockland County home buyers will obtain fixed rate, 25- to 30-year, m ortgages at 13 5/8 percent interest by the end of the month, and 15 m ore will get similar loans within a year. But first, they have to f ind moderate priced houses - and that, apparently, isn't easy. The money is available regardless of income through a special state program that provides loans at about 2 percentage points below the present normal commercial interest rate. Half the borrowers will have to make only a 10 percent down payment and the other half, a 20 percent down payment. But the maximum price of a home eligible for such a mortgage is $71,460, except for ''target areas'' selected by county officials as neighborhoods needing investment. In these areas, the maximum house price is $87,340. One-sixth of the funds will be used for mortgages on new construction of single-family homes only. The limits in this category are higher - $84,240 in most areas and $102,960 in target areas. The mortgages became available in August from a $220 million bond issue in June by the New York State Mortgage Agency, a quasi-public body informally known as Sonny Mae. The agency allocated $33.6 million to Westchester and Rockland, which are treated by the state as a single unit. The agency buys up old mortgages from banks, and the banks use the funds to issue new mortgages, which have to be approved by the agency. Fourteen banks in the two counties are participating in the program. Woody A. Pagan, first deputy director of the agency, said Sonny Mae had approved 55 bank loans for a total of $2.5 million by the end of September. By the end of October, he said, he expects it to approve $22 million in loans. About 17 percent of the funds will be issued gradually over the following 10 months for mortgages on new construction, he added. Susan Steward, director of the White Plains Housing Information Service, who has helped about 25 families make loan aplications, said it was ''almost impossible to find a house for $72,000'' in Westchester. She argued that a limit should be set locally, not in Washington. Mr. Pagan explained that the limits were set in Washington because Sonny Mae bonds are tax-exempt. He said the agency would try to get the limits raised before new bonds are issued, probably in November. The new bonds are expected to provide Westchester and Rockland Counties with an additional $25 million for loans, he said. The program has two objectives: to put new money into old neighborhoods and to help first-time home buyers. In the old neighborhoods, or target areas (which make up 20 percent of the program), any buyer is eligible; in other neighborhoods, only first-time home buyers are eligible. The target areas, largely low-income neighborhoods, were chosen by officials of the Urban County program, part of the County Department of Planning. Mr. Pagan said that even with the higher limits in those areas - designed to attract new residents -there had not been enough applicants for loans. ''In New York City,'' he said, ''middle-class people are sometimes attracted to poorer areas. But in Westchester, people don't seem to want to do that. For the people who already live there, even if you cut the interest rate to 13 5/8 percent, it's still too high.'' Westchester had a hard time qualifying for the money, according to Mr. Pagan. The Federal guidelines are complex and they did not seem to suit the county. Mount Vernon, which has many low-income areas, did not have a single neighborhood that qualified when the program first came out, Mr. Pagan said. Areas where incomes were low often turned out ''to have nothing but garages and parking lots, and there were no singlefamily homes to lend money for,'' he said. One couple who decided to invest in a target area - Dennis and Gayle Verzi - found a two-bedroom, 50-year-old Cape Cod house in New Rochelle that they could buy for $44,500 with a 10 percent down payment. They expect to move there from an apartment in Queens in November, a few weeks before the birth of their first child, who is due around Christmas. ''It's not a depressed area, just an older area,'' Mr. Verzi said. ''The people who picked it as a target area just want to keep it from getting depressed.'' Mr. Verzi, who is 29 years old, is coordinator of physical medicine and rehabilitation at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Yonkers, and his wife, who is 24, is a hairdresser. ''O UR problem was that we just finished paying off our education loans and we haven't been able to save anything yet,'' Mr. Verzi said. ''I'm doing fairly well financially, and my wife has an income potential, but we wouldn't be able to buy without the program because we haven't got enough for a big down payment.'' Robert and Sally Goehrke, both 26, also moved to a target area, the Battle Hill section of White Plains, ''because there isn't much around at $80,000 or $90,000,'' Mrs. Goehrke said. The couple moved from their one-bedroom White Plains apartment into a 50-year-old Dutch colonial, which they bought for $84,000. They, too, move in anticipation of a new baby, due early this month. Mr. Goehrke is a marketing manager for Clairol products, and Mrs. Goehrke is a pharmacist. ''This is just perfect,'' she said, ''and there's no way we could afford it if we had to pay 16 percent interest. Our costs will be about $1,000 a month, including taxes, and they would be about $150 more without this loan. We just could not have done it.'' The target areas are in Mount Vernon, Yonkers, New Rochelle, White Plains and Port Chester. Lawrence Salley, director of the Urban County Program in Westchester, said he is working with Sonny Mae officials to expand into Peekskill, Ossining Village, Tarrytown, North Tarrytown, and the Fairview section of Greenburgh. Most of the applicants so far have been young people, mainly married couples, according to David J. Dalrymple, assistant vice president of the People's Westchster Savings Bank. He said the bank had about 70 loans ''in the pipeline,'' accounting for $3.2 million of the bank's $4 million in available funds for the Sonny Mae mortgages. Without the bond issue, borrowers at his bank would pay 16 percent and 3 points (a one-time fee of 3 percent of the mortgage), Mr. Dalrymple said. The Sonny Mae rules set the rate at 14 percent, with no ponts, or 13 5/8 percent and 2 points.

If the public and Congress are to be persuaded to do away with the partial deregulation and market disorder provided by the Natural Gas Policy Act, some misconceptions must be laid to rest. Concern about a fly-up of gas prices in 1985 under N.G.P.A. is exaggerated. Although the current price of oil is somewhat higher than framers of N.G.P.A. anticipated in 1978, the average price of natural gas has also risen substantially and unexpectedly. One reason is ''category creep'' - an increase in production of gas in higher priced categories and a decline in production of lower priced gas. In addition, prices of ''deep'' gas, now free of controls, have been bid above levels that would clear the market in 1985.",1982-10-10T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Purple Decades',"Here's almost 20 years of Tom Wolfe's electric prose, 20 classic pieces, including ''The Pump House Gang'' (California surfers and their culture), ''The Last American Hero'' (Junior Johnson, Southern moonshine delivery driver turned stock car racer), ''On the Bus'' (Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters' cross-country LSD bus trip), ''These Radical Chic Evenings'' (Leonard Bernstein's trendiness), ''Mau-Mauing the Flak-Catchers'' (the fun of extorting poverty program cash from whitey in the 60's) and memorable hunks of both ''The Right Stuff'' and ''From Bauhaus to Our House.'' Nothing new, but a sampling rich enough to prompt a close look at Wolfe. Who is he and what is he up to? ''Only a language experience.'' That's what Walt Whitman once called ''Leaves of Grass,'' and that could also suggest Mr. Wolfe's distinctive Americanness and hint at one valuable part of his achievement. What he conveys is excitement or shock in the face of anomaly, and he does so by deploying various devices of verbal intensity and oddness. He will repeat a tag and repeat it and finally work it to life: ''the right stuff,'' ''burned beyond recognition,'' ''the good old boys,'' ''just like that.'' He likes shock assonance, as in ''rat shacks,'' ''rot bog,'' ''black gas,'' ''an utter shuck,'' ''wavy gravy,'' ''the pick of the litter'' and of course ''flakcatcher.'' He will weasel himself into the reader's own intimate space with expletives and street-corner familiarities: ''Hell, yes!''

Like many other books from the pen that brought us ''Jailbird,'' ''Slapstick'' and ''Welcome to the Monkey House,'' it's a riot of randomness. At age 12 young Rudy, schoolboy, fires off an unaimed round from a rifle belonging to his father's gun collection and accidentally kills a pregnant woman named Eloise Metzger, who's vacuuming her living room several blocks away when hit. Jailed for the deed, both Rudy and his eccentric father are viciously beaten by the police. (The cops bathe Rudy in ink and display him in a cage to selected visitors, who are encouraged to punch him out a little: ''I was regional theater.'') Lawsuits from the bereaved Mr. Metzger ruin the Waltz family financially (Rudy's father is heir to a drugstore chain fortune), and Midland Cityites bestow a mocking nickname on Rudy - the nickname that gives this work its title.

The two Presidents, 50 years apart, are cast as the chief villains in the economic dramas of their respective eras, offering up optimistic forecasts in the teeth of dire economic portents. In one sense, the dual portrait is overdrawn: Their guilt has been much exaggerated, since in both cases the seeds of the problem were planted much earlier and germinated far beyond the boundaries of the United States. In President Reagan's case, he followed Republican and Democratic Administrations that had failed to cope with the raging inflation induced by Vietnam and the OPEC oil price shocks. His predecessors - and the leaders of most of the Western world - had inconsistently tapped on the monetary brakes, hoping to stop inflation but afraid of causing a major recession. President Reagan, however, slammed on the brakes, sending interest rates soaring, with severe consequences for the United States and the rest of the world.",1982-10-17T05:00:00+0000

us,'Bech Is Back',"SINCE 1970 Henry Bech has been one of John Updike's several alter egos. In ''Bech: A Book,'' Bech was the author of three novels and a miscellany and was beginning to find that leading the literary life was easier than writing. He was also a bachelor afraid to commit himself to marriage, and the fact that in this respect he was the opposite of Updike may have made him all the dearer to his creator. But in ''Bech Is Back'' his dry period has stretched to 13 years, and though the descriptions of poor Bech's collisions with rare book collectors, Third World cultural attaches and sexual hostesses in the Commonwealth countries may be funnier than ever, they are sadder. He is running out of stalling tactics. At last he relinquishes his timidities, marries his mistress, finishes a long-awaited, bestselling book called ''Think Big'' and exchanges his shyness for disillusion, thereby becoming a formidable literary figure. Henceforth if Bech gets into serious trouble he will be in the news, not merely quietly extinguished as a man or as an artist. And in accomplishing this ambiguously welcome transition, he is like Updike, which - though Updike evinces no undue interest in the books Bech writes -should keep him available for the future.",1982-10-17T05:00:00+0000

The King, who is the leader of an Arab League delegation, did not specifically define what he meant by ''coexistence,'' nor did he mention Israel, but a senior State Department official said that his choice of words was important. Mr. Reagan said the meeting with the delegation was ''an important milestone'' toward ''a common objective, a just and lasting peace in the Middle East,'' and emphasized the importance of a negotiating process. (Page 1, Column 6.) Elections in Northern Ireland strengthened the political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Incomplete returns gave Sinn Fein two more seats, for a total of five, in the 78-member assembly. The gains were widely regarded as a pyschological victory for the party, which entered only 12 candidates, all in urban areas where Roman Catholics are concentrated, which campaigned on a slogan of ''a ballot in one hand and a gun in the other.''

In two weeks, more than 400,000 students nationwide will work through the 2 1/2-hour test, hoping their scores will endear them to colleges. Critics are already denouncing the examination for mismeasuring students' abilities, while the College Board, which sponsors the S.A.T., defends its fairness. Data released this year show that after a 20-year decline, scores rose slightly. Scores in New York City, announced last week, continued an increase begun two years ago, though they still hang 35 points below the national average. Explanations of increases are as controversial as explanations of declines. Black students improved more than white students, for example, though blacks averaged 100 points below the norm - a sign of educational deprivation to some, of intellectual inferiority to others.

Miss Switzer ran in the Boston Marathon eight times - the first in 1967. That year, however, she was an uninvited, unwelcome guest because women were barred from the event. To Miss Switzer, the inclusion of the 26-mile-385-yard race in the Olympics is ''not just another event'' for women. It is, instead, a symbol of the strides women have made in the last decade, when they have broken through psychological, sociological, physical, financial and legal limits to improve their performances dramatically and shatter long-held perceptions about the roles of women in sports. ''The thing that excites me the most is the lack of a sense of limitations,'' said Miss Switzer, who is 35 years old. ''When I was first running marathons, we were sailing on a flat earth. We were afraid we'd get big legs, grow mustaches, not get boyfriends, not be able to have babies. Women thought that something would happen to them, that they'd break down or turn into men, something shadowy, when they were only limited by their own and society's sense of limitations.",1982-10-29T05:00:00+0000

Brezhnev, which was one of the harshest statements the Soviet leader has made about United States policy. Konstantin U. Chernenko, the Politburo member, said that Moscow remained committed to an improvement of relations with Washington in addition to its current efforts to end its bitter dispute with China.

After all, it was a Dane - Hans Christian Oersted - who first discovered the relation between electricity and magnetism back in 1820, and yet another Dane - Valdemar Poulsen - who invented magnetic recording at the end of the last century. Poulsen's primitive device, using piano wire magnetized by the voice current from a telephone, emitted only feeble sounds and could not compete for popular acclaim at the time with Edison's blaring tin horn. Still, it established the principle of recording sound in the form of electrically induced magnetic patterns; and though scarcely remembered today, Poulsen knew a moment of glory when his invention was shown at the Paris World's Fair of 1900 and caught the fancy of the visiting emperor of Austria. It is ironic that Franz Joseph, that venerable monarch who so resented the intrusions of modernity into his ancient realm that he never spoke on the telephone or rode in a motor car, thus became the first ruler to preserve his voice through the medium of electrical recording.",1982-10-31T05:00:00+0000
