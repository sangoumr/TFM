Arnold Weinstein's adaptation of Ovidean love and frolics is tactful almost to the point of chastity. But like its predecessor it has charm, originality and imagination.

To some extentper haps to a large extentthe Grimm fairy tales are more suitable for the Sills treat ment than Ovid. They con tain more variety within their scope and have a vital sense of grotesquerie that adds enormously to their dramatic impact. There is surely a sensu ality to Ovid, but a sensu ality that is here lost in a pink cloud of good humor; it does mean that a valuable part of Ovid's insights go begging for a voice.

The Yankees soon bought some acreage in the Bronx and built The House That Ruth Built, a marvel of its day, which apparently is over. According to the Yankees and the football Giants, Yankee Stadium is no longer ade quate for their needs. Not long ago, Mayor Lindsay announced that the city would purchase the ball park, renovate it, improve surrounding access roads and parking facilities and lease it back to the Yankees under terms that would make the structure a direct revenue loser for the city, as is Shea Stadium. Among the figures mentioned were $24million, said to be the basic cost of purchase and improvement, and $300,000, the annual loss. City officials claim, however, that the loss in indirect revenue would be far greater if the two teams, particularly the Yankees, were allowed to leave.

us,Sweetback': Does It Exploit Injustice?:' It's a Funny Old World',"THERE'S a very short, practically subliminal sequence in Melvin Van Peebles's new film, ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,"" in which a jaunty black shoeshine man polishes the shoe of his white customer by riding it with the seat of his pants. With his rear end more or less pointed at the face of the customer, the shoeshine man glides, half-dancing, back and forth across the toe of the shoe, mocking the shoe, his customer, himself, the conventional gestures of joyous sexual transport, and about 400 years of American social and economic history.The shoeshine man grins the traditional good-darkie grin and the customer laughs, mostly with embarrassment. The white man knows he's being made a fool of, and yet his shoes are being shined. The black man is completely aware of the spectacle he's creating, but he's performing the service for which a contract was made, while maintaining a franchise, ever so shaky, on his own sovereign independence.""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,"" however, is not about the shoeshine man. The film, which Van Peebles dedicates to ""all of the black brothers and sisters who have had enough of The Man,"" is about a black man who refuses to go on role-playing, who, quite literally, stands up to assert himself. Sweet Sweetback (Van Peebles), having been raised from childhood in a black, Southern California whorehouse, is the establishment's Lucky Pierre, the indefatigable star of its nightly exhibitions who, through no fault of his own, is forced to beat up a couple of white cops and then escape to the Mexican border.The movie is the story of Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Flight, accompanied by lots of soundtrack song, a journey made eventually intolerable not only by the hardships and the duplicity (of even white counter-ulturalists like the Hells Angels), but by the simplistic sensationalism of the treatment and the eye-disorienting visual style that substitutes film school technical complexities (such as the superimposition of double, triple and quadruple images) for dramatic content. Instead of dramatizing injustice, Van Peebles merchandizes it. With the exception of perhaps a dozen scenes, the movie is composed almost entirely of the sort of fancy montages with which television the goal. Still to be found are a director and a choreographer to guide a cast of about 25.HAPPY JOURNEYArvin Brown, who has just directed the remarkably successful revival of O'Neill's monumental ""Long Day's Journey Into Night,"" was 24 (six years ago) when he staged his first full-length play for the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven""Long Day's Journey into Night."" Included in the cast then were Mildred Dunnock and Frank Langella and, Brown recalls, ""I was scared to death. I can never be grateful enough to Millie for the warmth and support she gave me then.""In the years since, he has become artistic director of Long Wharf and during his regime, which began with the 1968-69 season when Long Wharf's fortunes had touched bottom, he has succeeded in raising the theater to national status: mounted two world premieres of Gorky plays never done before in English, ""Country People"" and, this season, ""Yegor Bulichov,"" in which Morris Carnovsky played the title role, as well as Robert Anderson's latest, ""Solitaire Double ""Solitaire."" In September, at the invitation of the Edinburgh Festival, he takes Long Wharf to Scotland where it will present the Anderson play prior to its New York entry and a revival of ""You Can't Take it With You,"" with which Long Wharf will launch its new season.A man standing no more than 5 feet 5 inches, with thinning hair and a soft, gentle manner of speaking, Brown's assumption of the director's mantle is attributable in part to the fact that from childhood he knew he wished to be involved with the theater. But, as he grew older, he also knew he could not be an actor. ""Actually,"" he says, ""my original aim was to be a writer-teacher."" With that in view, he took his bachelor of arts degree at Stanford, received a Fulbright in theater research techniques which he utilized at the University of Bristol in England. There he did his first directing, then took a master's degree from Harvard on a Wilson Fellowship and finally took off to the Yale Drama School. He was only months away from the Yale degree when two of his schoolmates, Harlan Kleiman and Jon Jory, raised $125,000 and launched Long Wharf, taking Brown with them. Brown took charge of the children's theater. It was at the end of that first season, in 1965, that he got his shot at O'Neill.His approach to ""Long Day's Journey"" then was pretty much what it was for the current edition, which stars Robert Ryan, Stacy Keach and Geraldine Fitzgerald. ""I try to get the material out of the actor rather than lead an actor to the material,"" he says. ""Especially in a play like this you can't have a concept. You try to find out what in an actor resembles the role he is playing and then help him develop it out of himself. I don't believe in imposing an abstract idea on an actor. I try also to develop a rehearsal atmosphere, by which I mean I want my actors to feel free to expose themselves. In this way they make mistakes that I can see. Only the director can have a sense of the total structure of the play. If an actor has a sense of the structure, then he's not sufficiently involved in his own work."" And, thinks Brown, his own involvement with writing helps him to understand better how words are put together, how and what the playwright wished to achieve.Will Long Wharf lose him to the allure of the big time? At this writing, hardly, Brown has no wish to leave the comforts of his home base, the support of a growing audience, the loyalty of the group of actors he has formed around him or the house he has by the sea. And his wife, the talented Joyce Ebert, a member of the Long Wharf company, feels much the same way. ""Besides,"" says Brown, with a happy smile, ""she really likes keeping house and we want to have a family. You can't do that too well when the two of you are running off in all directions.""TOURIST TIPAs the season of the itchy feet begins to engulf us, theater buffs bound for England this summer should keep the Chichester Festival in mind.

On May 19 Lucienne Hill's translation of Jean Anouilh's ""Dear Antoine"" gets under way with Edith Evans and Joyce Redman.

Neither the looselyversified scout manuals and ecological gospelsongs of the moment, nor epigrammatic modes of moralizing landscape descending from Robert Frost, nor the constantly refocusing, relentlessly uncaptioned snapshots of the unarranged that some poets have learned to take from William Carlos Williams, provide models for Ammons's intense and profound imaginative excursion.",1971-05-09T05:00:00+0000

A coelacanth may be rare, but one can marvel at the fact of its survival without going damp in the palms with particular emotion.Sharks, however, are something else, often observed but, until comparatively recently, little known, the subject of all sorts of old-wives tales, a symbol for everything from shylocking to every man's fate worse than death, an implacable, terrifying, disinterested power, an Old Testament tribulation, as well as a force of extraordinary grace, beauty and serenity. Those of you who share my perhaps neurotic, weekend skindiver's fascination with sharks will not, I think, be able to resist the quite jolly, sometimes awesome, new documentary movie that opened yesterday at the Festival Theater.""Blue Water. White Death"" is the filmed record of the voyage undertaken 18 months ago by Peter Gimbel, the underwater photographer who took those extraordinary pictures of the sunken Andrea Doria some years ago, and several other hearty, quite lunatic skindivers in search of the great white shark, which is apparently the shark that has given all of its cousins such unpleasant reputations.This is the same voyageoff South Africa, Mozambique, Ceylon and Australia  that Peter Matthiessen documents, on a more introspective level, is his new book, ""Blue Meridian.""In its form, ""Blue Water, White Death"" is a rather conventional documentary of romantic experience, with much of the ingenuous Rover Boys tone of Bruce Brown's ""The Endless Summer."" It contains a certain number of self-conscious re-enactments of things that actually happened during the voyage, more than one blush-red sunset and, on the soundtrack, snatches of folk songs with lines like ""I'm gonna go/ Where the chilly winds don' blow.""It also contains some of the most beautiful and (there is no other way to describe it accurately) breathtaking underwater footage I've ever seentruly remarkable, free-swimming encounters by Mr. Gimbel and his associates with sharks gorging themselves on newly caught whales, with barracudas, with fat, pushy groupers, and, finally and triumphantly, with the great white sharks off the southern coast of Australia.I must admit that I'm not terribly familiar with the animals of marine photography, but it does seem likely that this climactic sequence is unique. The divers, suspended in frail aluminum cages, captured close-up shots of the great whites as they soared around, under and over them, occasionally dashing in for a go at the bars of the cages, sometimes threatening to carry the cages off into the open sea, sometimes just butting the cages in frustration.Why, in heaven's name, do people do this sort of thing? In his book, Mr. Matthiessen quotes Mr. Gimbel as saying:""Danger doesn't interest me . . . but I'm curious and I think everybody's curious to find out just what their limits, are under situations that exert a certain amount of stress on them.""To this Mr. Matthiessen adds: "". . . this search has no real end to it but death. Still, I don't think this is a 'death wish' unless dread of death is the same thing. It is as if, by confronting death over and over, he (Gimbel) might end some awful suspense about it, or dissipate it in some way. . . .""The movie doesn't speculate. It shows, and what it shows is a group of men (and one woman, Valeric Taylor of Australia) pursuing a crazy curiosity to its outer limits. It also shows their exhilaration after their dives, and in these scenes in the flat terminology of their mysticism and in the excitement on their facesit communicates the indefinable reason why.""I got the liver scared out of me at one point,"" Mr. Gimbel reports after an especially dangerous dive. Somehow the language is not equal to the event, but then the meaning of the event is so private that perhaps no language is adequate.Mountain climbers, free-fall parachutists, spelonkers, surfers, skin divers and the like are a very mysterious breed, and if ""Blue Water, White Death"" does not explain Mr. Gimbel and his friends, it at least describes them, rather as if they were Hemingway characters in fantasies imagined by Walter Mitty, with dialogue out of Harold Teen.However, the heart of the film is its action, recorded with immense technical skill, and it is so pure that it's as poetic as anything I've seen on the screen in a long, long time.",1971-05-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"A Portrait of John Christie, the Murderer:London Crime Recalled in '10 Rillington Place'","Early in the morning of March 9, 1950, after a good night's sleep, Timothy John Evans, a 25-year-old Welshman with the mind of a child, was executed for the murder of his infant daughter, Geraldine. It was also believed that Evans had murdered his wife, Beryl, whose body was found alongside Geraldine's in the wash-house at 10 Rillington Place, London, but the child's murder was the only one for which Evans was prosecuted.Three years later, the Evans's landlord, John Reginald Christie, a former policeman who had been the chief prosecution witness at the trial, was himself arrested and charged with the murder of his wife, Ethel, whose body had been discovered under the floor-boards at 10 Rillington Place. Ethel wasn't the only one stashed away at that shabby address. Investigation revealed five more bodies, hidden in kitchen cupboards and buried in the back yard, and before Christie was hanged on July 15, 1953, he confessed to all of these murders, as well as Beryl's.Christie never admitted to having strangled the Evans baby, but a later inquiry into the murders, and into the two trials, resulted in a posthumous pardon for Evans, and Britain's abolition of the death penalty.This is the real-life case on which Richard Fleischer, the director, and Clive Exton, the scenarist, have based ""10 Rillington Place,"" using Luduvic Kennedy's book of the same title as their source material. It is a solemn, earnest polemic of a movie, one with very little vulgar suspense, shot largely on the actual locations, with actors, including Richard Attenborough (Christie) and John Hurt (Evans), made to look like facsimiles of the real people, with all kinds of authenticity in everything from chamber pots to courtrooms.Ironically, for a movie that is so meticulous, at least in superficial details, ""10 Rillington Place"" carries very little dramatic conviction, and evokes hardly any emotion except the one relating to the barbarity of capital punishmentwhich is not enough to sustain this sort of entertainment enterprise.The problem with the film is very much the problem with the actual case, which involved small, unimaginative people in some sordid events, and which became interesting and significant only in its ultimate ramifications.Christie was a mass murderer, all right, but a very dull onemad as a hatter, of course, but so inhibited he could only effect a very tentative sexual congress with a woman who was at the point of death. That he was successful, as long as was, in his dreary pursuits of orgies, was not due to a lunatic brilliance but to incredible luck and to the incredible stupidity of the people around him.Attenborough plays Christiequite properly, I thinkwith a nasty, spinsterish fussiness, and absolutely no passion. Poor Evans, to whom the film seems to give most of its attention, is played by Hurt (in what I assume to be the director's conception) as a fairly normal fellow whose only need is a remedial reading course. By largely ignoring Evans's limited mental capabilities, the movie creates a credibility gap that is impossible to bridge.Although Fleischer refuses to senationalize the subject with the sort of lurid details that gave a film like ""The Honeymoon Killers"" so much of its fine, gruesome impact, he isn't above using common cinematic tricks, like a quick cut from an execution by hanging to a shot of the real murderer, safe in his home, suddenly doubled over with a back ache.Watching the film is, thus, rather like listening to someone tell an obscene story by using only nice euphemisms for dirty words and acts. ""10 Rillington Place"" would probably have been more effective, more moving even, had it admitted its essential vulgarity, and let us draw our own pious conclusions.",1971-05-13T05:00:00+0000

But, a bit belatedly and without over-reaching, it comes in on target agreeably, with ample chuckles.The spice is the presence of the star, playing it cool and subdued but properly brisk, as an earthbound widow from New Jersey who presents herself to a stunned but imaginative C.I.A. Dispatched to Mexico City, she winds up a prisoner in a mountain fortress in Communist-dominated Albania.Slender as the picture is, it meshes disarmingly on three counts. There's good old Roz, who is simply darling.There is the compactness of C. A. McKnight's script, nicely flavored by some pointed, wry dialogue. Add the picturesque backgrounds of Mexico City and Wyoming (doubling for Albania) in good color. Except for one good, ugly scene of a bullet removal, the rough stuff is relegated off screen, under Leslie Martinson's trim direction.Finally, there is the general tone of wry, warm sensibility, sidestepping cuteness and outright burlesque. The star has fine support from Nehemiah Persoff, Harold Gould, Albert Paulson, John Beck and Dana Elcar. As her cynical sidekick in sleuthing.

us,' The Night Digger',"As a study of understated tensions, vague psychopathic sexuality and somber moods, the British-made ""The Night Digger,"" which came to local theaters yesterday, proves to be more polish than persuasive drama. It begs for empathy for its tortured principals, but despite the clearly dedicated contributions of Patricia Neal, Roald Dahl, her scenarist-husband; Pamela Brown and a young newcomer, Nicholas Clay, the strain on credibility is a good deal more notable than the impact on the emotions.Miss Neal is portraying a cured one-time victim of a stroke. She is eminently qualified by her victory over her own actual traumatic experience. So is Mr. Dahl, who helped her recover and whose script gives her and the rest of the cast sensible lines to speak.But Miss Neal, cast as an intelligent, sensitive spinster enslaved to the demanding, blind mother who adopted her at an early age, does not appear to be the type who would fall for a strange, shifty young man who has insinuated himself into the household.Suffice it to say that Miss Neal is suspicious, frightened and resentful of the ominous young intruder, Nicholas Clay, from the moment of his arrival. And while it is made evident that he's the sick, mysterious fiend who's raped, killed and buried a half-dozen girls in nearby roads that are being paved, Miss Neal's apprehension grows without knowledge of the facts.Even though it's indicated that she eventually is aware something unusual is troubling him, Miss Neal decides to help, falls in love, escapes her mother's dominance and spends a brief, romantic idyll with him before it all ends in tragedy. One can understand her yearning for happiness, but the turnabout is sudden and hardly in keeping with her adult character. Her delineation is tense but properly underplayed, and Nicholas Clay's portrayal is generally low-keyed but strong. But a viewer needs a clinical elaboration beyond brief vignettes about his being a eunuch.""The Night Digger"" previously bore the ironic title, ""The Road Builder"" and it stems from a poetically labeled novel, ""Nest in a Falling Tree."" Unfortunately it cries for more conviction rather than a catchy tag.",1971-05-13T05:00:00+0000

To begin with, it promised an eye witness account of the murder trial of the Black Panther Minister of De fense, Huey P.

In fact, no requirements of any kind except that you be 16 or older and capable of riding an unassisted bicycle.

us,Film 'Ivan Denisovich' Best at Long Distance,"Although the newspaper ads have been announcing Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ""One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,"" what opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse is a movie by Casper Wrede, of which Solzhenitsyn's novel is the source and not the finished product. Actually the confusion, which would make perfect sense to any publicist, is to a degree supported by the film, for it is not merely a close adaptation; it has, much of the time, the look and, indeed, the feel of a careful, tasteful, rather sumptuous illustrated edition.Ivan Denisovich (Tom Courtenay) is a political prisoner, a poor peasant who, while in the Russian army during World War II, escaped from a Nazi P.O.W. camp and for his pains was sentenced by the Stalinist government 10 years as a spy. He is now in his last two years, a seasoned prisoner in an especially harsh Siberian labor camp, where the film, like the book, follows him from before dawn until after dark through the depressions and successes of one unexceptional midwinter day.But I doubt whether anything really gets into the movies as ""unexceptional."" And though the movie protests the modesty of its intentions (through the services of a fairly obtrusive voice-over narration) and honorably avoids all of the easier rhetorical excesses, it nevertheless strains toward a certain expansiveness, a range that it is one of the chief glories of Solzhenitsyn's novel never openly to assume.For where the novel sees through the eyes of its Ivan Denisovich, whose rough, crafty, decent pragmatism saves it from most pretensions, the movie chooses mostly to look at himand though Tom Courtenay is an actor who knows how to preserve his privacy in front of a camera, the result is that what had been ""point of view"" in the book becomes in the movie something less meaningful and more grandsomething like ""image of man.""I think this is why, despite some really estimable performances (besides Courtenay, I especially liked Espen Skjonberg as the tough and admirable work-gang boss Tiurin), the film tends to be happier the further it gets from its peopleor, while it is with them, the more it can understand them as exemplars of the human condition and the less as individuals.""One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich"" is thus a movie that looks uncommonly good in long distance, as in the emergence of the prison camp, rather as a bright galaxy in a dark void, that begins the film; or in the stunning shots of the prisoners and the guards trudging across the flat snow-covered landscape from prison camp to work site in the morning and back again at night.Such sequences, however, with their excellent cinematography (by Sven Nykvist, a veteran of recent Bergman films) and their intelligent exploitation of realistic locations (in Norway, near the Arctic Circle), carry the aura of an almost official view of high quality, as if this were how an important movie made from an important novel ought to look.At its best, for example, in depicting the brick-laying that makes up the actual work day of Ivan Denisovich, or at its worst, in the stiff-upper-lip gentility of the dialogue in Ronald Harwood's screenplay, the movie means to expose a universality in its comprehension of individual experience. But at its best, and even at its worst, both the excellence and the ineptitude seem to derive from virtues and vices that are largely academic.",1971-05-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Guess What We Learned . . .':Avildsen's Work Boils Stereotype Enemies Two Suburban Families Fight Sex Education,"When John G. Avildsen's ""Joe"" opened last year, some critics detected a certain ambiguity in the quality of its contempt for its hardhat hero. In ""Guess What We Learned in School Today?,"" an earlier Avildsen that opened yesterday at the Loew's Cine, there is no such ambiguity, merely stupid hatred, but there are ineptitudes and unrewarding obscurities enough to sink the movie.Deep inside ""Guess What We Learned in School Today?"" is a burlesque horror story about two suburban husbands, Roger Manley and Lance Battle, who fight to maintain their families' purity and the American Way of Life against the evil incursions of pot, Communism and the carnal knowledge to be unleashed should be education be taught in the local schools by one Dr. Lily Whitehorn.As you will have noticed, the film makes rather a thing of its personal names, and since Manley learns to his own distaste that he is homosexual and Battle has for the last 10 years been impotent, the irony sits heavy on each identification. Lily Whitehorn, a lanky spinster speaking truth, betrays herself only by an occasional Freudian slip (""wildly"" for ""widely"") into the kind of movie ""Guess What We Learned in School Today?"" should have been content to remain.The movie it keeps trying to be, however, is an amalgam of social satire and sane sex propaganda and it succeeds with neither. It attacks mostly easy enemies (uptight cops, super patriots, militarism, brand names, etc.) and it defends nothing at all except good appetites and therapeutic pornography.This is where I feel a certain doubleness of intention in ""Guess What We Learned in School Today?"" For where it ambitiously produces everything it despises (Lance and Roger have elaborate on-screen fantasies and a whole slew of playable character quirks), it scarcely presents what it admires and time and again it comes to look like a series of blackout skits from the more inhibited edges of an exploitation movie.Because I happen to like some exploitation movies and to deplore the pious simplicities of this film, I can salvage from it only the memory of a few good women who might have been put to better use: Rosella Olson (Mrs. Manley) for her fine body, Jane MacLeod (Mrs. Battle) for her plump and pretty face, and Yvonne McCall (Dr. Whitehorn), whose fantastic freckles and big wide grin constitute the only real point of attraction in ""Guess What We Learned in School Today?""",1971-05-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Dirtymouth' Traces Bruce on Screen,"At the time of his death in 1966, Lenny Bruce was prohibited from giving public performances in New York. Earlier he'd been deported from England, canceled in Australia (after he told a rude story about the Crucifixion), and busted on various charges (usually for obscenity, several times for narcotics) in Philadelphia, Miami and San Francisco, among other places. Following his death, however, life, as it has a way of doing when it's too late, suddenly looked up for the man who had died a pauper.A filmed record of one of his last appearances (""Lenny Bruce"") was released in 1967. The next year, the New York Supreme Court reversed a criminal court's ruling and found his nightclub act to have had redeeming social valuewhich might have amused Lenny, who thought redeeming social value a rather silly criterion to be judged by.At least two legitimate plays on his life have been in the works; Albert Goldman is writing what a friend of mine is sure will be the definitive biography, and one feature film has actually been made. The movie is called ""Dirtymouth"" and it opened yesterday at the Penthouse and R. K. O. 59th Street Twin Cinemas.""Dirtymouth"" is a very bad movie that can't quite make up its mind whether Bruce, played by Bernie Travis, who vaguely resembles the star, was a young Tom Edison, ahead of his time, or the sort of mad doctor who must be punished for tampering with the secrets of the universe. Quite early in the film, a worried nightclub patron, who has been listening to one of Bruce's milder monologues, says with the awe of someone who has just seen an atom smashed: ""There's no telling where a thing like this could lead!"" Later on, one of the star's admirers states flatly: ""Lenny Bruce is the past, the present and the future!""The truth of the matter is that Bruce was a very good, if not great, comedian, who was sidetracked, and who was very much a product of his time, the uptight 1950's. One of the ironies ""Dirtymouth"" seems bent on not recognizing is the fact that, five years after his death, the words that Lenny was prosecuted for using are now to be heard in any number of neighborhood movie houses. The revolution that Lenny spearheaded has come and almost gone. Society hasn't collapsed into a gibbering mess, but then it hasn't been completely liberated either.""Dirtymouth,"" which covers Bruce's career from the late 1950's until his death of an apparent overdose of narcotics, talks quite a lot about the comedian's brilliance while demonstratingin its choice of material and in the performancethat he wouldn't have made a decent second banana to Pal Joey. Herbert S. Altman, the writer-director-producer, has, in addition to hiring more bad actors than I can remember seeing in one film in 20 years, tried to make his simple little screenplay look a good deal more complex than it is.In what can only be called misguided attempts at pure cinema, Altman, several times, tries to find the movie equivalents to Bruce's narrative style. He dramatizes Bruce's story about how Jesus was arrested in Miami (because He carried no identification), and he presents us with montages showing us the judges and the district attorneys, who prosecuted Bruce on various occasions, in grotesque, musical comedy make-up. It doesn't really work. I suppose that legal reasons may be responsible for the brush-off the film gives to the star's drug problems, as well as to other areas of his private life.""Dirtymouth"" has so little on its mind, so little to offer, that while I was watching it yesterday morning at the Penthouse, I wondered if, perhaps, it wasn't watching me. Bad movies prompt paranoid fantasies.",1971-05-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Corruption and 'The Cop':Boisset Work Opens at Cinema Rendezvous,"Despite a certain exploitable political notoriety (alleged suppression and then censorship by the French Government, which would seem to scare too easily), Yves Boisset's ""The Cop,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvous, is in fact a routine revenge melodrama notable mostly for the predictability of its episodes and the frequency with which those episodes fail to follow one another in meaningful or even logical sequence.Cops are of course involved, and one does tend to exceed one's office by killing deserving thugs for personal vendetta but the idea is completely traditional, and it used to be treated with more passion, intelligence and courage in American movies 20 years ago.Boisset's cop begins his plunge when a young colleague is killed by a gunman, one of a pair who have just assassinated an underworld chieftain, a real rat, who may have a finger in the police department. The Cop, Inspector Favenin, has been absolutely straight, but he goes quietly obsessional in hunting and eliminating the killer of his pal. In this he is a parallel of the other gunman, Dan (John Garko), also seeking revengefor his best friend, for his best friend's sister, and ultimately for the victim of Favenin.In the moral system of ""The Cop"" there are good crooks and bad crooks, but cops are neither good nor bad but only, for one reason or another, subject to corruption. Favenin is corrupted by his feelings; Dan, however, is ennobled by histhough both men pursue analogous courses of action to comparable goals and between them they leave the world a better, if considerably emptier place, by the end.Because its cops are such sealed creatures, working in dark suits in dark places and enclosed rooms (Dan, on the other hand, has a place in the country and lots of horses) they have the potential for a kind of interest that the film never wholly realizes but that it does recognize by observing them in a program of tense profile close-ups that look like serious style and that must go back, for antecedents, at least to Hitchcock's ""Blackmail"" (1929).With little going for him, with scarcely a clue for a characterization, Michel Bouquet does wonders in sustaining and intensifying his Inspector Favenin.

us,"' When Eight Bells, Toll,' Melodrama by MacLean:Anthony Hopkins Stars in Adventure Tale","Yesterday I learned something: there is a certain kind of movie that is best seen from the middle, which is the way that fate (and the opening of several other films on the same day) dictated that I see ""When Eight Bells Toll,"" the newest and possibly the silliest action melodrama yet written by Alistair MacLean, the author of ""The Guns of Navarone"" and ""Where Eagles Dare.""The film, which opened at the Penthouse and a number of other theaters around town, is a handsome, technically elaborate movie variation on a plot that you may have first encountered at the age of 8 in one of the early adventures of Tom Swift or the Hardy Boys  the one about ships carrying gold bullion disappearing at sea without a trace.""When Eight Bells Toll"" has to do with a secret cove on the coast of Scotland, a band of cutthroats who really do cut throats, an adventuress with a foreign accent, and a British Admiralty sleuth who spends a good deal of his time in a wetsuit scaling anchor chains, sheer cliff faces, the villains and the adventuress.By entering such a film in the middle, one is immediately relieved of a number of burdens. The plot makes no sense whatsoever, and thus it is impossible to identify with anyone in particular. Like the frontier wife who, according to Abraham Lincoln, came out of her cabin one day to find her husband in mortal combat with a bear, we carry impartiality to its outer limits. We urge: ""Go it, man. Go it, bear."" The action of the filmincluding helicopter crashes, pursuits at sea, underwater explorations of sunken shipsbecomes so unattached to emotional need, so pure, so abstract, that it can be enjoyed in the manner of a wild but well-turned syllogism.Unfortunately, I made the mistake of staying over to see the film from the beginning. When it is watched in some sort of rational sequence, the movie collapses in a heap of failed attempts to be both plausible and stylishthe first being beyond Mr. MacLean's interest, and the second being beyond the talents of Etienne Perier, a director whose every shot and cut is predictable.The cast includes Anthony Hopkins, as the frogman who has the distinctive good looks of an Argosy illustration, and Nathalie Delon, whose performance, as the adventuress, evokes all the mystery and enchantment of Bella Darvi's performance as the physicist in Samuel Fuller's ""Hell and High Water.""",1971-05-27T05:00:00+0000

It all stems from the fact that Professor Terzi and his associates are about to come up with a wonder heredity drug and shed new light on the criminal factor in chromosomes.Unfortunately, Dario and Salvatore Argento, the producer and director-writer, who previously were represented here by another sample of the genre, ""The Bird With the Crystal Plumage,"" have drawn mere surface portrayals from a scurrying cast, who only occasionally generate some tension.

us,Burton Portrays 'The Villain' of the London Underworld,"""The Villain"" is a sadistic London mob chief who loves his Mum and remains faithful to her by sleeping with his boyfriend, the mob's pimp, who doesn't mind being occasionally beaten upwhich probably makes this otherwise conventional underworld movie sound more interesting than it ever is.The film, which opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and West Theaters, is the first theatrical feature of Michael Tuchner, a television director who seems to have learned his craft by studying the films of Henri Verneuil, the French director who seems to have learned his craft by imitating (badly) good American gangster films of the thirties. In its payroll heists, its car chases, its beatings and in its final confrontation, the movie employs gestures that in other, better films, such as ""Get Carter,"" seemed classic, but here are only second-hand.In the title role, Richard Burton, grown somewhat fat and soft, like a potato that's been left too long on the vine, reads his lines well while keeping himself at a safe remove from them, as if he didn't want to be identified with the part. Ian McShane, looking lean and handsome and ratty, all at the same time, has good moments as the ambivalent pimp, a man who will do just about anything to survive, and Cathleen Nesbitt is the East End Mum, who spends most of her time in bed, sipping tea and looking unnaturally regal.

us,Gangsters in a British Style: Grissom Gang' Opens at 2 Theaters Here Story Takes Place in Missouri of 1930's,"""Its morals,"" wrote Leonard Mosley in London's Daily Express 23 years ago, ""are about on a level with those of a scavenger dog. Its aim is lascivious. Its dialogue is cheap and suggestive. Many of its scenes are revolting.""Mr. Mosley was writing about a British attempt to make an American gangster film out of James Halley Chase's ""No Orchids for Miss Blandish."" I never did see that film, which caused something of a scandal in England but was generally ignored by critics when it opened three years later. However, I've no doubt that the same sort of knee-high dudgeon will greet Robert Aldrich's film version of the Chase novel, which opened yesterday at the DeMille and Juliet I Theaters under the title of ""The Grissom Gang.""You don't really have to think very much about ""The Grissom Gang"" to call it offensive, immoral and perhaps even lascivious, although to me, that word, when it is applied to an aim, is more of a promise than a threat. ""The Grissom Gang,"" like so many Aldrich films, especially ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"" and ""The Dirty Dozen,"" carries lurid melodrama and violence to outrageous limits, for what often seems like the purely perverse hell of it.There is, however, lurking around the edges of the film, if not actually on the screen, the suspicion that Aldrich is such an uncompromising (maybe even revolutionary) moralist that he can only make his points in terms of action so grotesque that it challenges easy, safe compassion, sympathy and credibility.As I say, this is only a suspicion, but it's enough to make an ultimately unsuccessful film like ""The Grissom Gang"" a lot more interesting than nicer, more obviously high-minded movies.I've not read Chase's novel, but the film that Aldrich and Leon Griffiths, his screenwriter, have made from it looks like a Big Little Book version of ""Sanctuary."" The pictures are vivid and blunt and the prose could hardly confuse a slow-reading 8-year-old, for whom the film is definitely not intended.The setting is rural Missouri in the early 1930's, before the repeal of Prohibition, and the story has to do with the kidnapping of a rich, frizzy-haired Kansas City girl (Kim Darby) by a gang of small-time hoods led by a homicidal old lady with a definite mustache (Irene Dailey) and her simpleminded son (Scott Wilson). He's the sort of young man who still counts the number of cookies he eats, as if the total number of cookies eaten in a lifetime were among the accounts kept in heaven, complains to Mom when the girl he wants to rape pushes him away, and giggles a lot when he shoots a friend in the face.If that doesn't put you off, then the manner in which Aldrich dramatizes his redemption theme certainly will: his Temple Drake, after going through a purgatory of humiliation and fear, discovers the meaning of love in the devotion of her idiot Popeye.One of these days, Aldrich is going to make a movie that is as great as it is full of sensation. Everything in ""The Grissom Gang"" is carried to an excess that draws attention to itself, and helps to deny what I hesitate to call its serious intentions.The period detail is quite marvelous and overdone, like the Rudy Vallee record on the soundtrack, the use of fly swatters, the costumes (including Miss Darby's white satin, Jean Harlow evening dress), the shots of gang members sitting around the poker table in shirtsleeves and gun holsters. Everybody sweats constantly, and nobody dies off-screen, always on-screen, in what the newspapers of the day used to describe as a hail of bullets.What's worse, Aldrich lets his performers, especially Miss Dailey and Wilson, behave as if they were in ""The Beverley Hillbillies."" They mug without shame, although I did like Miss Darby, an actress whom I haven't always admired in the past, as the sullen, quite pathetic victim, and Connie Stevens, as a beautiful and dim-witted moll any hood would be lucky to call his own.It may be, of course, that Aldrich's strengths are his excesses, which have a kind of disembodied energy in them, but in ""The Grissom Gang"" these excesses seem to contain a certain contempt, not just for the sensibilities of his audience (which I don't care about), but for his characters, whom, I think, he wants to take seriously. It's a very mixed up movie but one that is worth thinking about.",1971-05-29T05:00:00+0000

This Czechoslovak import about three farm youngsters and a helicopter is scenic but a bit contrived and precious. The kids themselves should spot this soon enough. The color is only fair.""My Side of the Mountain,"" tomorrow at 3 P.M., is first-rate viewing for the youngsters, as a spunky boy proves he can live alone in the Canadian wilderness. The tone is gentle but sturdy, the color and the settings are lovely and young Teddy Eccles is an appealing hero.""The Big Store,"" Monday at 11 A.M., is not tip-top Marx Brothers, but this 1941 romp does let the four clowns run wild frequently and hilariously.

us,' Escape From the Planet of the Apes' Proves Entertaining,"Nobody is going to believe it, but I must say anyway that Don Taylor's ""Escape From the Planet of the Apes,"" which opened yesterday at the Astor, the Juliet 2 and the 34th Street theaters, is one of the better new movies in town, and better in a genrescience-fictionthat at the crucial middle level where the history of movies is made, if not written, has recently been not so much bad as invisible.""Escape From the Planet of the Apes"" takes place more or less in the present, 2,000 years before the end of the world by nuclear explosion set off during a battle between human beings and their masters, gorillas (""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" 1970).Three scientists, pacifist chimpanzees, escape the general destruction by traveling back through time in the very space ship with which Colonel Taylor had made his surprising journey forward not so long before (""Planet of the Apes"" 1968).They thus bring with them not only the knowledge of mankind's doom, but also its very seed, for Zira, the female chimpanzee, is pregnant with the child whose name will eventually appear in the sacred histories as the first in rise up against the tyranny of people and assert the supremacy of the apes.As movie premises go, I think this is quite beautifulthough I am sure that in one variation or another it has been used beforeand its development in ""Escape From the Planet of the Apes"" does it considerable justice.Allowing for certain probable impossibilities (the film is much stronger in fiction than in scienceno drawback so far as I'm concerned) there is enough thought to support the kind of dramatic inevitability this particular form needs and allows.As in most monster movies, the subject finally is human guiltbut here rendered richly ambivalent, because the monsters are scarcely monstrous and the guilt is a function of unassailable strategic intelligence.It follows that the heavy, Dr. Otto Hasslein (Eric Braeden), should be the United State's President's science adviser. Though sinister, he, like the other human beings in the film, maintains a degree of credibility unusual in the movies, or in life.As the chimpanzee Corneliusagreeable, short-tempered, a bit too proud of his mind  Roddy McDowall seems to have evolved a performance designed as a tribute to the late Edward Everett Horton. Kim Hunter plays his wife, Zira, rather in the manner of your maiden aunt from Peoria, and like McDowall's, her characterization is hugely successful.Don Taylor's direction seems composed in equal parts of efficiency and tact, and with this material alone he earns his place among the just for every easy irony he avoids. There are certain remarkable moments (for example, the first shot of the chimpanzees' hotel room, especially prepared for their welcome to Los Angeles), but more often there is a sense of decent professionalism un-attracted to spectacular devices.By conservative estimate, the President of the United States turns out to be a weighty idiot in 90 per cent of all science fiction filmsand he seems to be in almost 90 per cent of all science fiction films.But in ""Escape From the Planet of the Apes,"" William Windom's President is allowed to be urbane, wise, articulate and astute. And though I'm sure I'll never see his like again, I'll remember him as not the least of this film's graces.",1971-05-29T05:00:00+0000

Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the bestknown opponent of ending the draft, articulated this con cern in a recent speech: It is unwise to insulate from the horrors of war middle and upper class Americans who might lead the pretest against sense less foreign adventures.

us,Screen: 'The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus',"If you recall last year's Off Broadway ""Chicago 70,"" which was put on by the Toronto Workshop Company at the Martinique Theater here, you're hereby apprised that the 16mm. color film version on view at the Film Forum through next weekend is essentially the same improvisational dramatization. It includes excerpts of the 1969-70 trial of the ""Chicago 8"" with infusions of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" juvenile classroom recitations and pseudo-radio broadcasts. The film version, labeled ""The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus,"" is decidedly true to its title as ""circus,"" ""conspiracy"" and justifiable polemics, but it is rarely moving as movie drama.Basically, a moviegoer is affected by what he sees and even if the truth, like the politics of our time, is both tragic and comic, it has to be strongly visualized as well as declared on screen. There is a great speaking of minds from the actual record in ""The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus"" but, unfortunately, there is not a great deal to stir the hearts or the eyes of the uninitiate.As noted, the polemics as well as the confusion of a baffled Judge Julius J. Hoffman facing the taunts and life-style (and the psychedelic dress) of the disparate likes of Abbie Hoffman, Bobby Seale, Allen Ginsberg (reciting some of his explicitly sexual poems) and Country Joe McDonald singing his anti-Vietnam rock, are forceful and to the point.One is also Impressed that maintaining law and order before defendants and attorneys who are trying to stress that the court is not their idea of law and order any more than is Mayor Richard J. Daly's rule of Chicago strikes effective notes for both the Establishment and a younger generation divorced from it.Kerry Feltham, the director, who has employed practically the same cast that George Luscombe used in the play, has drawn forthright declamations from all of them, both black and white. And, it must be noted that, while it is sometimes confusing, different actors are sometimes switched to play the same role, such as Judge Hoffman's, and do prove their versatility.The cast, to name a few such as Mel Dixon, Jim Lawrence, Peter Faulkner, Neil Walsh and Diane Grant and not to slight the others, are Yippie, hippie and serious enough to project authentic dedication to their art and dialogue. But like the documentary ""Breathing Together: Revolution of the Electric Family,"" seen here last month and also dealing with the trial, ""The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus,"" which was photographed on sets with a mirror background, is generally as static as a photographed play.What the Toronto Workshop Company has to say is obviously ingenious theater even if it is political and perhaps partisan. But it is, sadly enough, good rhetoric that does not add up to an exciting or innovative film.",1971-05-31T05:00:00+0000

us,Paris: Screen Seizes on Inbreeding,"PARISWhat is ""in"" in French films? The answer is: inbreeding, especially that very essence of inbreeding: incest. It occurs in at least three recent French productions: ""Bof,"" ""Les Maris de l'An Deux"" and ""Le Souffle au Coeur."" The last two have been leaders at the box office for weeks, while the first was rewarded with a ""Succs D'Estime,"" a phrase that might be freely translated as: financial failure.Arts AbroadLouis Mail's ""Le Souffle au Coeur""a French expression designating a slight heart condition that adolescents sometimes experience passinglydescribes the sentimental education of a teenager in a middle-class provincial milieu in the fifties, when France was still embroiled in her Indochina war. Adults whom only the magic word ""career"" can extract from their apathy, homosexual Jesuit educators, equivocal boy-scout friendships, youngsters playing practical jokes or losing their virginity in brothelsin short Mr. Mall has conjured up a dinosaur one had thought long since extinct: The Grande Bourgeoisie.The result is that the nature of the subject has contaminated the work: the film is well made, polite, unimaginative, studded with society jokes, dry as an insect and quite boring. Perhaps, it was to jolt the spectator out of his tedium that Mr. Mall introduced incest. It is committed by the mother, a ""foreigner"" with Bohemian inclinations, and her yet unspoiled son. The scene is brief, and it is immediately erasedfrom incest to palimpsestby a scene of ""normal"" love-making and a hearty family laugh; still, it ought to have alarmed the French censors, and their intervention ought to have made the movie into a scandal, that is, into a success.Unfortunately, they saw nothing wrong. Indeed, ""Le Souffle au Coeur"" was selected to represent France at the Cannes Festival. And so the indispensable uproar would never have occurred, had it not been for the help of that dowdiest of institutions, French television.Michel Pollac invited Mr. Mall, Alberto Moravia and Professor Grass to discuss incest on his weekly literary television program, ""Post-Scriptum,"" one of the few lively shows currently on the TV screen. Mr. Pollac's great discovery had been that while books are always dull, writers can be hilariously funny, when assembled in herds. In fact, he had at last come upon a satisfactory substitute for the wrestling matches on which television networks throughout the world have been relying for years. The show's deficiencies were themselves a reflection of today's cultural scene: It was numerically dominated by representatives of the New Left, who tend to be as stereotyped in their reactions as Mr. Mall's bourgeoisie. Whenever an independent opinion was voiced, its utterer was hooted down and showered with sarcasms.Something less foreseeable happened: the management of French television, in the name of morality and of the good French public, took a series of measures that eventually amounted to suppressing ""Post-Scriptum"" (thereby indirectly but efficiently launching ""Le Souffle au Coeur""mention of which was forbidden on the airon the road to popular success). This ill-inspired, dangerous decisionthe act of censorship is always more harmful than that which is censoredis in line with the inexorable evolution of French television, once the most creative in the world, toward conformism, an evolution inherent in the systematic, deliberate shift of all responsibilities and powers from creators to civil servants.""Les Maris de L'An Deux"" (""The Spouses of Year Two of the French Revolution""), another official entry of France at Cannes, did not need the odor of scandal to become a hit.It had Jean-Paul Belmondo. ""Les Maris"" is a tongue-in-cheek, cloak-and-dagger movie, aimed at family audiences, a genre at which the French are curiously adept and of which ""Fanfan La Tulipe,"" starring the late Grard Philippe, is the classic. Fights, escapes, pursuits against a background of amiable Terrorthe episodes flit by so quickly and so weightlessly that the incestuous love of a brother and a sister passes almost unnoticed. But then, we see them no more closely together than riding on the same horse, and there are so many surprising events to take in, not the least of which is the reconstruction, for budgetary reasons, of 18th-century Nantes in 1970 Rumania.It is difficult to imagine a amusing, tender and amoral film than ""Bof,"" an exclamation meaning somthing like: ""So What?,"" used to express one's smiling indifference to everything from lateness at an appointment to the collapse of values in the Western world.The film illustrates this new paganism. It begins, deceptively enough, at a portrayal of working-class life. A young man become a delivery boy, lugging crate upon crate up steep backstairs. He marries a salesgirl, his mother dies, his father, jobless comes to live with him . . . We begin to realize that the film's maker, Claude Faraldo, has something else in mind than social realism when the father asks his son to let him sleep with his wife, ""only from time to time, of course."" This poses no problem. In fact, nothing does.As every student of surrealism knows, fantasy is effective only when embedded in a context of credibility. Mr. Faraldo intelligently lends both verisimilitude and humor to his anarchist's daydream by putting it in sharply observed proletarian existence and by deriving the most preposterous mischief from the exquisitely drawn affection between father and son. ""I live off you, I sleep with your wife, I've killed your mother.""""Bof"" went almost unnoticed: the censors had neglected to object. If this trend toward increasing liberalism on the part of the Censorship Commission (appointed by the Ministry of Culture) continues, it will soon become necessary to convince the public that talent is the worst of all obscenities.",1971-05-31T05:00:00+0000
