The Giants held on to beat the Redskins, 17-14, but their season was over when the Packers Nick Collins intercepted a Jay Cutler pass with 10 seconds left at Lambeau Field. The Bears-Packers game was closer than a lot of people expected (the betting line kept rising during the week and settled around 10 points). Lovie Smith stuck to his word and played his starters the whole way in a 10-3 loss. The Bears knew heading into the game that they had nothing to play for, but led into the third quarter as the Packers struggled to run the ball and do much of anything on offense. The Giants did their job; it wasnt pretty, but they survived the loss of Rich Seubert to injury and finished 10-6. Now the question turns to Tom Coughlins future. But how can you fire a coach who won 10 games? The Giants are not known for such impatience. Toni Monkovic The live analysis of the game, by Mark Viera, is below. Pregame: ",2011-01-02T19:48:35+0000

The office of Serbias war crimes prosecutor said in a statement that the painting was estimated to be worth over a million euros ($1.3 million) and that Mr. Hadzic had probably tried to sell it, The A.P. said. The painting was not named or described further, and it was unclear if it was stolen. A Modigliani painting from 1917, Nude Sitting on a Divan (The Beautiful Roman Woman), sold at Sothebys in November for $68.9 million, an auction record for the artist.

Bhutans art is largely restricted to veneration within the temples and monasteries, so it is little known in the West and hard to gain access to even inside Bhutan.

Disney Theatrical Productions announced its worry-free winter 2011 exchange policy for the two musicals as an experiment to allow greater flexibility at the box office. Policies for Broadway plays and musicals vary for those who want to exchange tickets for another date; this pilot program is meant to help Disney evaluate how many theatergoers might use and appreciate such a policy as well as to offer peace of mind for those worried about making their shows when, say, a blizzard looms. People have busy lives and need more flexibility when the unexpected happens and plans change, David Schrader, executive vice president of Disney Theatrical Productions, said in a statement. We recognize the time is right to reduce restrictions and put more power in the hands of the customer. Customers who exchange tickets would not be able to receive a full or partial refund if a refund were offered for a specific performance. The policy covers a traditionally slow-selling stretch for many shows and comes during a time when tickets are relatively available for Mary Poppins and to some extent for The Lion King, which is the bigger hit.",2011-01-02T22:57:36+0000

Before his imprisonment, Mr. Amiri was subjected to three months of intensive interrogation, the report said. The report could not be verified, and much that has been reported about Mr. Amiris case has been confusing and contradictory. American officials said Mr. Amiri was a C.I.A. informer who voluntarily defected to the United States in 2009. When he returned to Iran, he said he had been abducted and tortured by the Americans, and Iran said he was a double-agent sent to spy on the C.I.A. ",2011-01-04T05:57:58+0000

When Giridharadas pushes the Naxalite  What does one fight have to do with the other?  the man answers with a striking notion: globalization is reducing people to their specific economic task, stripping them of their humanity, just as caste had done. And software engineers in gated communities have become the new Brahmins. Giridharadas follows the curve of this argument, allowing it to seduce us.

Does a certain star have nerves of steel or a killer instinct? Are they soft? Weak-minded? Descriptions such as these are thrown around disguised as absolutes, even though clutch play is often hopelessly tainted by perception bias. All it takes is one big shot to create a legend. Once a player establishes a reputation as a clutch scorer, it typically follows him to his grave, regardless of what that pesky legitimate evidence indicates. ",2011-01-07T19:33:38+0000

I stand by all of those arguments, but I also agree with Daniel Foster that the filibuster reform proposal the Senate Democrats are putting forward looks pretty reasonable. Essentially, for the filibuster to work as Id like it to work, it needs to be available as a check on temporary majorities without becoming a routine tactic for obstruction, which is how its increasingly employed. Ultimately, restoring this balance requires more collegiality, comity, and good manners: Theres no rule you can change that explicitly limits the filibuster to particularly sweeping and controversial pieces of legislation. (I mean, no reasonable rule, since I suppose you could imagine a provision stating that 60 votes shall only be required for cloture when Gallup shows that a majority of Americans oppose the legislation in question, or something similarly implausible.) But the revisions the Democrats are contemplating  which would limit the filibuster to substantive measures (no filibustering motions to proceed) and require actual speechifying from filibustering senators  would at least make the filibuster feel more extraordinary than it does today. And that seems like a step in the right direction.",2011-01-07T20:01:52+0000

Shes a 16-year-old schoolgirl, and an astonishing phenomenon. Until now, there has only been one woman to crack the top 100 in chess rankings, and thats Judit Polgar, by far the most impressive player in the history of womens chess. Polgar, from an amazing chess-playing Hungarian family, peaked at no. 8 in the world and most recently was ranked 49. But Polgar is 34 and is unlikely to surge to the top of the rankings, while Hou Yifan is young enough that she could end up in the top few players worldwide over the next 10 or 15 years. (While Hou Yifan is the womens chess champion, she still has a lower ranking than Polgar, who does not compete in womens tournaments. Heres the piece by my Times colleague and chess columnist Dylan McClain about Hous triumph.)",2011-01-09T00:43:03+0000

The group, consisting of 61 writers from publications like Time, The Village Voice and The New Yorker, gave the best supporting actress award to Olivia Williams for her role as a political wife in Roman Polanskis The Ghost Writer. She creamed her competition, getting substantially more votes than Amy Adams and Melissa Leo for The Fighter or Jacki Weaver for Animal Kingdom. The Ghost Writer also placed in the screenplay and director category, which may mean that it has a better-than-a-dark-horse chance at the Oscars (a dappled horse?). The society does reveal its final tally, an unusual openness in the world of trophy-giving. For a closer look at what their numbers mean, check out The Hollywood Reporters take. As Tim Appelo notes there, if Ms. Williams does win an Oscar, she will have to hand it over to Mr. Polanski  as she promised she would  because hes got a pretty clear vision for his performers. He acts the scene for you, she said. And if you dont copy what he does, he goes, No! Like this,  pause, movement, intonation, the works.

The deepwater rigs in the Gulf of Mexico were steadily drilling, with no suggestion of any impending calamity, and oil was flowing from the vast finds in offshore Brazil. Circumstances looked particularly prospective to a geophysicist named Jim Farnsworth, who works for Cobalt International Energy, a company that held a group of leases 50 miles from the mouth of Angolas Cuanza River basin. It was at that site, he had come to believe, that an enormous basin of oil lay, beneath an obscuring layer of salt, in rocks deep below the bottom of the sea. The industry had been over this territory a decade earlier; a few scattered wells were drilled into the Cuanza basin, and then, having found little oil, the companies plugged them. In seismic images, you could still see the pipes, running through the sediment of the ocean floor.",2011-01-14T15:37:44+0000

Where once the well crafted short story in the revered tradition of Henry James, Anton Chekhov and James Joyce was the predominant literary model  an essentially realist tradition, subtle in construction and inward rather than dramatic  now the more typical story is likely to be a first-person narration, or monologue: more akin to nonliterary sources like stand-up comedy, performance art, movies and rap music and blogs. Such prose pieces showcase distinctive voices as if fictional characters, long restrained by the highly polished language of their creators, have broken free to speak directly and sometimes aggressively to the reader  as in boldly vernacular stories by Junot Daz, Chuck Palahniuk, Edwidge Danticat, George Saunders, John Edgar Wideman, Denis Johnson and T. C. Boyle, among others.

Bernard-Henri Lvy (also known as BHL), though less noted for his wit, likes to play up to his reputation as a comic figure, popping up here, there and everywhere in his fine white shirts, opened halfway down his chest, holding forth on everything from Jean-Paul Sartre to jihad in Pakistan, and generally acting out the role, in a somewhat theatrical fashion, of the great Parisian Intellectual.",2011-01-14T16:58:21+0000

We, the viewing audience, dive into Kevin Durants past to watch an apparent time traveler pretend to inform Durant of his eventual N.B.A. fate. In the lack of real purpose, were left to focus solely on the commercials aesthetic, which is as bizarre as it is false.Its silly to ask how we - along with our mystery traveler - are transported to Rockville, Maryland circa 2005. After all, beyond a typical suspension of disbelief that accompanies the commercial medium, television ads are typically constructed in a serialized manner. In Television Culture, media scholar John Fiske described the serialized form as an infinitely extended middle, and in a sense, thats where these spots take (and leave) us. The year 2005 isnt a beginning in any sense for Durant, and were not privileged to see the process by which our traveler makes his way into Durants past. Theres also no real attempt at ending or closure, marking the images we see as some sort of enduring middleness, a journey which we join in progress.

Last week the Public Theater and others held a developmental workshop for his new musical, Giant, adapted from Edna Ferbers epic novel about love, oil, and ranching among Texas alpha males and the women who love them. The Public and the Dallas Theater Center had already announced that they were pursuing a co-production of Giant, which had its world premiere at the Signature Theater in Arlington, Va., in 2009. Oskar Eustis, artistic director of the Public, said in an interview that Dallas Theater Center was planning to mount its production of Giant next winter. How fast well go from Dallas to New York City depends on how much progress we make on the show between now and then, Mr. Eustis said. It seems safe to say that 2012 is likely for the New York run of Giant. Mr. LaChiusa wrote the music and lyrics, while the book is by Sybille Pearson (a Tony nominee for best book for the 1983 musical Baby). Michael Greif (Next to Normal, Rent) is the director. In addition to Giant, the Off Broadway theater company Transport Group is preparing to start performances in March for a revival of Mr. LaChiusas Hello Again, a musical featuring a series of interconnected love stories through the 20th century. And Transport Group also plans to stage the world premiere of another LaChiusa musical, Queen of the Mist, starting in October.

us,Now Showing | Juergen Teller in Berlin,"Juergen Teller has not one but two exhibitions in the German capital these days. Paradis, at Johann Knig Galerie in Berlin Kreuzberg, shows large-format prints of a naked Charlotte Rampling with an equally naked Raquel Zimmermann, rambling about the Louvre and posing alongside the Mona Lisa and a marble Napoleon. Originally published in the French magazine Paradis in 2009 and shown at Lehmann Maupin in New York the same year, the images have lost none of their beauty or inherent shock factor. Tellers other, much smaller, show in Berlin is equally revealing. Located in an ingeniously designed third-floor space run by the Berlin-based 032c Magazine, the exhibition comprises new work that Teller has simply called Men and Women. An image of a naked Vivienne Westwood, broadly grinning and with her legs splayed, presides over the show like a regal cross between Annie Sprinkle and Marie Antoinette, while next to her the photographer William Eggleston, photographed at home in Memphis, and Tellers own 9-year-old son, Ed, photographed in the gym of a hotel in the Maldives, seem goofily adrift. Its really a show about impotence, remarked a guest at the opening on Saturday night. In the middle you have Vivienne, all powerful and sexual, and to the left and to the right you have an old man who cant really do it anymore, and a young man who cant do it yet. No word from Teller himself whether he subscribes to the same interpretation  when pressed for a quote during dinner after the opening, Teller simply pointed to a David Hamilton photograph on the wall and said, I like those breasts.",2011-01-18T14:00:17+0000

The book, written with Hope Edelman, will celebrate their profound bond, give candid insights into the actors lives and relationship, examine the triumphs and challenges and inner and outer stages of the journey of a father and son. (It will also discuss The Way, a coming film directed by Mr. Estevez and starring Mr. Sheen.) The release from the Free Press did not immediately mention if Along the Way would also address that other, prodigal Sheen sibling.",2011-01-19T14:33:23+0000

There were occasional, notable exceptions  Stanley Cavells work showed how the meaning of ones words and the meaning of ones life might coincide  but then Cavell was long considered to stand outside the real business of philosophy. Even more fatally, students were introduced to the history of philosophy as a series of epistemological puzzles decontaminated from troubling concerns about what it means to be human, a question that had moved the great philosophers of the canon as surely as any thoughtful 18-year-old.",2011-01-20T23:35:13+0000
us,The Philosophical Novel,"Can a novelist write philosophically? Even those novelists most commonly deemed philosophical have sometimes answered with an emphatic no. Iris Murdoch, the longtime Oxford philosopher and author of some two dozen novels treating highbrow themes like consciousness and morality, argued that philosophy and literature were contrary pursuits. Philosophy calls on the analytical mind to solve conceptual problems in an austere, unselfish, candid prose, she said in a BBC interview broadcast in 1978, while literature looks to the imagination to show us something mysterious, ambiguous, particular about the world. Any appearance of philosophical ideas in her own novels was an inconsequential reflection of what she happened to know. If I knew about sailing ships I would put in sailing ships, she said. And in a way, as a novelist, I would rather know about sailing ships than about philosophy.",2011-01-20T23:35:14+0000

Western mediation efforts had failed. Ahmet Davutoglu, the foreign minister of Turkey, offered to step in. It was a complicated role for Turkey, not least because Bosnia is, like Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country and Serbia is an Orthodox Christian nation with which Turkey had long been at odds. But Davutoglu had shaped Turkeys ambitious foreign policy according to a principle he called zero problems toward neighbors. Neither Serbia nor Bosnia actually shares a border with Turkey. Davutoglu, however, defined his neighborhood expansively, as the vast space of former Ottoman dominion. In six months, Davutoglu told me in one of a series of conversations this past fall, I visited Belgrade five times, Sarajevo maybe seven times. He helped negotiate names of acceptable diplomats and the language of a Serbian apology for the atrocities in Srebrenica. Bosnia agreed, finally, to name an ambassador to Serbia. To seal the deal, as Davutoglu tells the tale, he met late one night at the Sarajevo airport with the Bosnian leader Haris Silajdzic. The Bosnian smoked furiously. Davutoglu, a pious Muslim, doesnt smoke  but he made an exception: I smoked; he smoked. Silajdzic accepted the Serbian apology. Crisis averted.

The prime minister denies all wrongdoing. According to ANSA, Cardinal Bertone said the Roman Catholic Church urged greater morality and legality in public life, especially from those holding public office. His remarks were seen as lending support to centrist politicians who seek to oust Mr. Berlusconi. In a television interview on Wednesday, the minor, Karima el-Mahroug, denied that she had sex with Mr. Berlusconi or asked for money in exchange for her silence, as wiretapped phone conversations published in the Italian news media this week suggested.

But clear understanding could be found in the left lapel of the collections jackets. These were doubled: a white, navy or fur second layer buttoned to the inside of the jacket and folded around on top, duplicating the true left lapel. Graphically, the effect was a contrasting sweep across the chest, almost a sash, reminiscent of military regalia. According to Van Noten, this sort of construction has its origins in the military uniforms for which lapels were first invented. Often one would be buttoned across the neck for extra warmth, but because that interrupted the shape (particularly a problem if any battle medals happened to be hanging there), a second lapel was needed to cover the chest.",2011-01-21T16:00:42+0000

As virtually any clown can attest, no one owns the idea of making a balloon dog, and the shape created by twisting a balloon into a dog-like form is part of the public domain, the gallery says in its federal complaint.

The original crossover martial artist, a local child star turned celebrated creator of Jeet Kune Do, the art of the intercepting fist, Lee made only a handful of films after his international breakthrough. (He died in 1973 at the age of 32.) But kung fu classics like Fist of Fury (1972) and Enter the Dragon (1973) are the stuff of countless homages and imitations, and Lees life and career have been chronicled in dozens of books and films. While the Hong Kong martial arts drama has long been in decline, its only fitting that the latest stirrings of a revival are connected to Lee: the most popular kung fu screen hero of the moment is none other than Lees mentor, Ip Man.

From President Obama, we heard a reasonably eloquent case for center-left technocracy and industrial policy, punctuated by a few bipartisan flourishes, in which the entitlement issue felt like an afterthought: He took note of the problem, thanked his own fiscal commission for their work without endorsing any of their recommendations, made general, detail-free pledges to keep Medicare and Social Security solvent (but without slashing benefits for future generations), and then moved swiftly on to the case for tax reform. Tax reform is important, of course, and so are education and technological innovation and infrastructure and all the other issues that the president touched on in this speech. But it was still striking that in an address organized around the theme of American competitiveness, which ran to almost 7,000 words and lasted for an hour, the president spent almost as much time talking about solar power as he did about the roots of the nations fiscal crisis.",2011-01-26T04:46:18+0000

The treatment, platelet-rich plasma therapy, or P.R.P., involves centrifuging a persons own blood until it contains a concentrated mix of plasma cells and growth factors and then injecting the resulting substance directly into the injured tissue. In theory, the distilled growth factors (a protein or substance that helps stimulate growth) should speed healing and improve the tissues health, which has happened in the lab. When scientists surgically created lesions in animal tendons and other tissues, P.R.P. therapy nudged the injured tissues to rapidly create new collagen and blood vessels. Meanwhile, testimonials from professional athletes suggested that the shots work in humans as well. Today, recreational athletes reportedly clamor for P.R.P. to treat everything from tennis elbow to back pain, even though the procedure rarely is covered by insurance and can cost $1,000 a shot. It has buzz, said Dennis Cardone, a clinical associate professor at New York Universitys Langone Medical Center who has written about the use of P.R.P. in sports medicine.",2011-01-26T05:01:44+0000

Peter Carter, Britains ambassador to Estonia, said at the unveiling of the $14,000 sculpture that Mr. Connery was without a doubt, an icon, adding: He is variously known as James Bond or the sexiest man of the century.

Although his work certainly feeds off late-20th-century energies, McElroys cosmopolitan, erudite fiction needs to be received on a wider bandwidth that also registers signals from other disciplines and earlier literature. The sudden shifts between his paragraphs, for instance, recall Braque and Picassos collage techniques, while many of his thematic obsessions overlap with those of modernists like Woolf, Bergson and Nietzsche. Reading Night Soul  a collection of 12 clever and oblique short stories  is, in fact, a little like being a member of Marlows audience in Heart of Darkness.

us,Ways to Teach About the Unrest in Egypt,"Egypt, the most populous country in the Arab world, erupted in mass protests in January 2011, as the revolution in Tunisia seemed to inflame decades worth of smoldering grievances against the heavy-handed rule of President Hosni Mubarak. After 18 days of angry protests, Mr. Mubarak resigned and turned over all power to the military on Feb. 11, 2011, ending his 30 years of autocratic rule and bowing to a historic popular uprising that has transformed politics in Egypt and around the Arab world. The announcement, delivered during evening prayers in Cairo, set off a frenzy of celebration, with protesters shouting Egypt is free! The popular protest, peaceful and resilient despite numerous effort by Mr. Mubaraks legendary security apparatus to suppress it, ultimately deposed an ally of the United States who has been instrumental in implementing American policy in the region for decades.Overview from the Times Topics page on Egypt, updated Feb. 11.",2011-01-31T17:14:35+0000
