us,Scores Feared Dead as Two Jets Collide Over Southern Germany," BERLIN, Tuesday, July 2 -- A Russian passenger airliner collided with a Boeing 757 cargo plane over southern Germany late Monday night, exploding in a fireball and apparently killing everyone aboard both planes, the police said. The Russian plane, a Tupolev Tu-154, and the Boeing 757 crashed into one another at 11:43 p.m. over the state of Baden-WAurttemberg in southwest Germany, said Wolfgang Wenzel, a state police spokesman in TAubingen. Initial reports varied about how many passengers the Russian-built Tupolev was carrying, but at least 97 people are believed to have died in the huge fireball, which lit up the night skies over one of Germany's favorite summer vacation spots, Lake Constance, on the border with Switzerland. According to the German television channel NTV, the Tupolev, operated by Bashkirian Airlines, was traveling between Barcelona and Moscow with as many as 150 passengers aboard. The plane had just made a stop in Munich, the television reported. The TU-154, a mainstay of aviation in the former Soviet Union, can carry up to 164 passengers. It is used on both domestic and international flights. More than 1,000 were built and most are still being flown, with just a few converted to freight use. Other reports suggested that the Tupolev was carrying 95 people. The Boeing was reported to be carrying cargo from Bahrain to Brussels with two pilots as its crew. Both pilots, thought to be working for the DHL delivery service, are believed to have been killed. The planes were flying at about 40,000 feet over Lake Constance, and burning wreckage was strewn over a 20-mile area near AUberlingen, 135 miles south of Frankfurt. ``I saw a flash of light so enormous that it lit up everything,'' Alfred Knoedler, one witness, told German television. Early this morning, police officers with dogs and infrared cameras were searching the area in the dark looking for survivors, the police said. The area is mostly agricultural fields and patches of forest, with widely scattered towns and farmhouses. Dozens of people flooded police stations in the area with calls describing how they had seen a large ball of fire in the sky at the time of the crash, Mr. Wenzel said. Some told the police they had seen pieces of burning wreckage falling through the sky. Three bodies have been found, the police said, adding that several houses, a school and a farm were on fire.

The incident, apparently raising the fear of possible terrorist activity, drew members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force -- along with city police -- to the site, a former landfill in Brooklyn, off Fountain Avenue and near the Belt Parkway. About 4:30 p.m., two armed men crawled under a locked gate at the landfill, which closed in the 1970's but is being cleaned up, said Charles Strucken, a department spokesman. He said the two threatened the guard with a gun before they were joined by two other intruders who entered a trailer operated by the private contractor. The four took two computers and a photocopy machine, and then broke into the contractor's Jeep Cherokee. Mr. Strucken said the four men then drove off, crashing through a locked gate.

Still, the semiconductor industry remains depressed from its highs. Sales in May were 10.5 percent lower than in the period a year earlier, when companies netted $12.7 billion from chip sales. The industry has only begun to rebound from two years of slumping sales. The trade group said that Asian chip makers, particularly those based in China, were benefiting from growth in contract manufacturing. The Asia-Pacific region, however, was the only one to experience growth from last year -- a rise of 22.4 percent. Sales in the Americas, Europe and Japan declined more than 20 percent in each region, the group said. Andrew Zipern (NYT)",2002-07-02T05:00:00+0000

The Englewood, built in 1941, was shifted around Massachusetts half a dozen times before the DreamWorks team spotted it on eBay, bought it for $35,000 and trucked it to Illinois. The diner's mahogany interior, said Dennis Gassner, the movie's production designer, suited the Depression-era plot. Sold twice again after the shoot, the Englewood rests in Eliot, Me., and is scheduled to open in the fall as the Down East Diner.

No, it was not Betsy Ross. It was Mary Young Pickersgill, a professional flag maker who was hired by the United States Army to create a 30-by-42-foot flag in 1813. A year later, it flew over Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore, inspiring Key to write the poem that became the anthem. Since 1927, Pickersgill's 1793 harborside house has been open to the public as the privately financed Star-Spangled Banner Flag House, and it is now expanding. On June 17, ground was broken for a $3.5 million War of 1812 Museum, designed as an extension of the house by RCG Architects of Baltimore. Its centerpiece will be a 30-by-42-foot glass wall with a baked-on ceramic pattern of 15 broad stripes and 15 bright stars. The Pickersgill flag belongs to the Smithsonian Institution, which is restoring it.

Now on his own, he has undertaken big jobs, including major new projects at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh and at Castle Clinton in Battery Park. But Mr. Pfifer, 49, is also a father of two and can think small. He describes the minimalist playhouse of wood and woven steel scrim, below, which he created this year for a family with a home on the South Shore of Long Island, as a garden folly. It seems to change, he said, with the time of day, the season and the color of the light, and its walls shift in the wind like a sail. The top two slabs, made of boatlike mahogany, are 12 by 16 feet and float on steel cables that climb to 18 feet. The ground floor is open, the middle level slightly enclosed, and the top, he said, is ''total release.''

She appeared in 17 shows on Broadway including, ''How to Succeed in Business'', ''Sweet Charity'', ''Tenderloin'', ''Juno'', ''I Remember Mama'' and such revivals as ''The Pajama Game'', ''My Fair Lady'' and ''Brigadoon''. She performed for several summer seasons at the Guy Lombardo Jones Beach Theatre, at the New York City Center and in Las Vegas. Renowned choreographers Agnes DeMille, Michael Bennett, Jack Cole, Alvin Ailey, Bob Fosse, Joe Layton, Graziella Danielle and John Butler chose Mickey, not just for her talent, but for her professionalism and reliability. Television choreographer, Robert Pagent, needed dancers for the grueling weekly ''Voice of Firestone'' and ''Bell Telephone'' television shows. They needed to be versatile and able to adapt to the quick study and limited time required. Pagent hired Gunnerson consistently for those shows during what were called the ''Golden Years'' of television. Miss Gunnerson married Stanley Page and they would have celebrated their 47th wedding anniversary this year. Page's career as a singer spanned a similar lengthy period of performing on Broadway and around the country as well as on television. Many stage colleagues became her lifetime friends. Mickey's other interests included environmental concerns and a love for animals. Many stray or abandoned dog or cat was given a comforting and caring home by the Pages. She also volunteered as a tutor for immigrants to help them master English as their second language. Her hobbies included scuba diving and skiing. Mickey Gunnerson was the epitome of so many of those somewhat anonymous stage performers backing up the bright stars and musical numbers that make the magic of the theatre come alive for all of us. Her impressive career is what ''A Chorus Line'' was all about. In addition to her husband, Stan, her sister, Gunhilde Brandt of Morehead City, North Carolina survives her. Friends may call Monday July 8, 2002 and Tuesday July 9, 2002 from 2 to 4 & 7 to 9 PM at Joseph W. Sorce F.H. Inc., 728 West Nyack Rd., West Nyack, NY (845) 358-4433, www.sorcefuneralhome.com. A Memorial Service is planned for July 13, 2002 at 11:00 AM in the Clarkstown Reformed Church in West Nyack, Rockland County, New York. Should you wish to remember Mickey, a contribution to Hi-Tor Animal Care Center, 65 Firemans Memorial Drive, Pomona, New York 10970, would be appreciated.",2002-07-06T05:00:00+0000

Decontamination work had already begun on 33 sites in 18 states, including one in Edison, N.J., that manufactured Agent Orange during the Vietnam war, and others from Montana to Florida. But the fund is hundreds of millions of dollars short of what it needs to remain on schedule, and the administration has decided not to pay to continue those cleanups. By refusing to push for renewing the corporate taxes that supported the fund, Democrats said, the administration is abandoning the fundamental precept of the Superfund -- that the polluter pays -- and is unfairly shifting more of the cost of cleanups to taxpayers.

As Max Kozloff writes in NEW YORK: Capital of Photography (The Jewish Museum, New York/Yale University, cloth, $50; paper, $35), the New York we know through photographs is an ''American city visualized by Jews,'' with gentiles like Berenice Abbott and Edward Steichen among the few distinguished exceptions. The book features more than 100 photographs of New York's inhabitants, but it is not truly a documentary project. It is more about the social and psychological essence of the city than about the details of specific historical moments. Kozloff, the former executive editor of Artforum, outlines the economic and cultural forces that drew Jews to photography. He also attempts to define the Jewish sensibility that he sees in the best of these photographs. His arguments can be hard to follow. He writes that Jewish photographers were especially sensitive to a feeling of alienation (or a feeling of community, depending on the picture), while most gentile photographers were not. The evidence he cites is difficult to see in the images themselves. The book's reproductions are thoughtfully arranged. The photographers made their pictures. Now we can argue about what it all might mean. Jake Miller",2002-07-07T05:00:00+0000

Lies, whispered, of friends' indiscretions; instances of envy &#151; when we hate the people we love; peccadilloes; filched office supplies; inflated expense accounts; violent obsessions of all kinds; reckless speeding; a fender bender whose scene we left; the belt from Macy's we slipped into our own belt loops (they're the easiest thing to take); a copy of Montaigne, nineteenth-century edition, never returned to the library; a kiss stolen from someone else's lover; a night out of state upon a tanned mattress when the energy of adultery seemed so persuasive that we concealed from ourselves all memory of our spouses; gifts never sent; allegiances never acknowledged; inexplicable cruelties to people with bad luck; inexplicable cruelties to friends; the waiter we upbraided that time; we cheated at cards; we cheated at tennis; we cheated at backgammon or at chess or at some board game of our childhood; we tripped that guy in the backfield and then waltzed in for the goal; we took things for granted, took privileges for rights; we demanded things in no way due us. And then with some of us there are worse crimes, crimes unspeakable, though we might write of them, like robbery, battery, or rape. We fell into coercion or abuse or full-scale embezzlement or even murder, the murder of innocents, perhaps; we committed crimes of rage so that afterward we couldn't sleep, couldn't forget, couldn't think straight, and whispered to ourselves, revisiting these instances of our transgression.

They stand out high and undoubtable, four miles or so off the coast of Lewis, surrounded by tide-rips in the Minch, with black cliffs five hundred feet tall dropping into a cold, dark, peppermint sea, with seals lounging at their feet, the lobsters picking their way between the boulders and the kelp and thousands upon thousands of sea birds wheeling above the rocks.

us,Just-High-Enough Art,"Sam Mendes loves games. Real games like cricket and soccer and backgammon, but also the subtler puzzles that take the form of plays and movies. He thinks about his work -- whether it be reconceiving a musical like ''Cabaret'' for the Donmar Warehouse, his London theater, or directing a movie like ''American Beauty,'' for which he won an Academy Award his first time out -- as a kind of contest, bound by rules of intelligence, insight and strategy. He is not an accidental person, hoping luck will win the day. Mixing instinct, research and some large thematic idea geared to resonate with a wide audience, Mendes carefully gauges everything from the mood-capturing potential of his new film, ''Road to Perdition'' (''I hadn't seen a gangster movie in a while'') to the best way to attract a crowd to the plays of Arthur Schnitzler (have the star, Nicole Kidman, be naked just long enough to be both appropriate to the character and still scandalous). Having run a theater for the last decade, Mendes, who is only 36, thinks like a studio head even when he's directing. Which means that he tries to win for both teams: commerce and art.",2002-07-07T05:00:00+0000

For diversion and entertainment, Americans could follow the Gary Condit sex scandal or watch &quot;reality TV&quot; shows like Survivor . Newspapers devoted front-page reports to such issues as road rage, a man bitten by a shark, and the revelation that overage kids were playing Little League baseball. The biggest issue in the airline industry involved something called &quot;economy class syndrome.&quot; Essentially this referred to rather obese people sitting in coach class and fretting that during long flights their legs became stiff.

A tax accountant by trade, Jerry became one of a small nucleus of inside executives at Continental Grain Company, where he worked in excess of 35 years. Upon retiring in 1999, Jerry and Cindy relocated from Scarsdale, where they had lived 25 years, to Cordillera Colorado. In Cordillera, Jerry had planned to continue his consulting and investment activities, while taking the time to enjoy a life of skiing and golfing in the Colorado sunshine.

Born in Washington DC in 1912, he received his medical degree from George Washington University in 1935. Following his internship at Gallinger Hospital, he completed his residency in 1938, at the Baltimore Eye and Ear Hospital, acting as assistant surgeon to Dr. Lee Cohen, a pioneer in the field of reconstructive surgery. After an additional two year course of study at Bellevue Hospital in NYC, Dr. Ogus was selected as Chief of Plastic Surgery at Halloran Veterans Hospital in Staten Island, where he remained until joining the U.S. Air Force as a Flight Surgeon in 1942. Dr. Ogus began his private practice at offices at 502 Park Avenue, NYC, and established his home some blocks away at 993 Park Avenue. During the 26 years of his active practice, he was a member of the staff of the LeRoy Hospital, the Wickersham Hospital and the St. Clare Annex. Known for his generosity, Dr. Ogus served as consultant and surgeon to the St. Clare Free Clinic in addition to contributing to many medical charities. A career member of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Dr. Ogus was elected a Fellow of the American Society of Facial and Plastic Surgery in 1963. Upon his retirement, he continued his studies at the London School of Economics. During the following years, he and his beloved wife, Pat, maintained homes in both Rancho Santa Fe, CA and Cascais, Portugal, where they enjoyed memberships in both social and charitable groups. Sharing a thirst for adventure, he and Pat traveled extensively throughout the European and Asian continents. During his lifetime, Dr. Ogus was known for his generosity and caring manner.

us,Transposing the Power of 'Tosca' to the Big Screen,"The great Italian operas of the 19th century were the Hollywood movies of their time: grand popular spectacles brimming with sex, violence and outsize emotion, and dedicated to the passionate marriage of sight and sound. Perhaps because of their close genetic relationship, the two art forms have rarely mixed well. The bold theatrical gestures and distended, improbable plots of opera often look disproportionate -- either shrunken or grotesque -- when captured on camera. With notable exceptions, like Ingmar Bergman's 1975 adaptation of ''The Magic Flute'' (which in any case is neither 19th century nor, strictly speaking, Italian), filmmakers have trouble negotiating the distance between the singers and the audience. At opera performances, we view the action from a fixed distance (usually determined by how much we can pay for a ticket) and are drawn into the action by means of a series of aural and visual illusions: the perspectives of the set, the volume of the orchestra, the modulation of the singers' voices.",2002-07-12T05:00:00+0000

us,In the Game of the Father,"Andrew M. Cuomo lives with his wife, Kerry, and their three young daughters in a 100-year-old clapboard house in Bedford, in the northern suburbs of New York. The Cuomo home abuts a 600-acre nature preserve, so that except for the roar of Interstate 684 to the west -- a constant annoyance to Andrew, though not to Kerry, who found the house in less than a week while Andrew stayed in Washington -- it has the feeling of a retreat, far from everybody and everything. The Cuomos were gathered in the dining room there a few Sunday mornings ago, five of them seated around a long platform of a table, large enough to seat 15 people, covered with platters of scrambled eggs, French toast and bacon. It was 9 a.m. Cuomo appeared to have just awakened, and he poked at his scrambled eggs and swirled his cup of coffee while Kerry tended to the girls. The house itself is remarkable, not only for its rustic charm, which is considerable, but also for what it displays: the walls along the stairway to the upstairs bedrooms are lined with the kind of historical artifacts you might expect to find under glass at the National Archives. There is the handwritten letter to Kerry, signed ''Grandma,'' from Rose Kennedy. There is another one from Uncle Jack, written from the Oval Office. ''This one is great, from my father to me,'' Kerry said, narrowing her eyes as she tried to make out the scrunched handwriting of Robert F. Kennedy. ''This is June 1963. 'Dear Kerry. Thank you for coming to the office this morning. It was a historical day not just because of your visit, but because 2 negroes over the opposition of Governor Wallace were registered at the university -- it happened just a few minutes ago.

His new novel, REVENGE (Random House, $23.95), set between 1980 and the present day, is a retelling of the swashbuckling classic ''The Count of Monte Cristo.'' Dumas's chestnut might not be the greatest novel ever written, but it certainly has one of literature's greatest plots, and Fry takes full advantage of it, using the elements that work and altering the narrative to suit his own thematic purposes. The 17-year-old Ned Maddstone is, at the story's opening, almost disgustingly perfect. The adored only son of an old-school Conservative politician, he is in his last year at Harrow. He is a star cricket player, his school's ''head boy,'' bound for Oxford; newly in love with a beautiful and brilliant girl, he is a powerful focus of envy among his fellows, although he is far too modest and diffident to realize it. Three jealous rivals arrange to have him arrested for marijuana possession. In police custody, he finds himself at the center of a political scheme involving I.R.A. terrorists. A scandal is impending, and a poisonous government agent, to save his own career, arranges for Ned to be spirited away to an insane asylum on a distant Scandinavian island. There he languishes for many a long year. But as readers of Dumas will predict, he eventually makes a dramatic escape, returns to London in disguise and descends on the terrified men responsible for wrecking his life. Fry has worked in any number of clever references to Dumas -- some of the characters' names, for example, are anagrams or near anagrams for their counterparts in ''Monte Cristo'' -- but the book is both a highly readable thriller and a viable novel in its own right. Fry has his own ideas about revenge, ideas that diverge from those of Dumas, and he keeps us guessing right up to the story's unpredictable ending. Brooke Allen",2002-07-14T05:00:00+0000

One result: the number of children orphaned by AIDS in Africa will double by 2010 to about 20 million, or nearly 6 percent of all those under age 15.

It even delivers. Billing itself as ''fresh Mexican doing the Cal-Tex twist,'' it's a far cry from what my Mexican-American mother cooked in Texas. But I've been there three times, and have every intention of going back. The chicken Tinga burrito ($6.45) is generous and filled with grilled breast of chicken with chipotles, tomatoes and onions. There was enough left over for lunch the next day. The place will make nachos with almost any topping you want ($2.95 plus 90 cents for each topping, black beans and chopped cactus among them). My daughter, Carmen, asked for nachos with rice, even though I told her they're just not done that way, but they did them that way for her. ''We had someone come in and ask for a quesadilla with the cheese on the side the other day,'' said Dana Crowe, one of the owners. You can eat in at about 10 formica tables, and you can bring your own liquor. There is a bright mural on the wall in the style of Diego Rivera, with figures from Carmen Miranda to pre-Columbian men and women. Neither Mr. Crowe nor his partner, David Fishman, had previous restaurant experience, which shows in occasionally uneven service or long waits for takeout. But they are getting help from Ken Sofer, owners of Benny's Burritos in Manhattan, who went to art school with Mr. Crowe, and his influence shows in the fresh ingredients and the attention to authentic Mexican flavors like cilantro and the Habanera hot sauce from Mexico at the tables.

She was the first woman employed as a lawyer by Sullivan & Cromwell, a law firm in New York, where she continued to work during the Second World War.

Following her husband's death in 1965, she returned to the New York area, where she resumed work as a lawyer, first at the Vera Institute in New York and later at the Legal Aid offices in Bridgeport, CT. She lived for many years in nearby Southport where she also served as a volunteer at the Pequot Library. Mrs. Osborne is survived by her sons John S.

us,Metro Briefing: New Jersey," TRENTON: DEATH SENTENCE OVERTURNED The New Jersey Supreme Court, citing a trial judge's error, reversed a Camden man's death sentence yesterday, but upheld his conviction for murder. The man, Daron Josephs, now 30, was convicted in April 2000 of murdering two other members of a marijuana-distribution ring in 1995. The unanimous ruling by the seven-member court threw out the death sentence because the judge improperly instructed the jury. Under state law, an accomplice cannot be sentenced to death. Yet the jury was told to consider first whether Mr. Josephs committed the murders directly, and then consider whether he was an accomplice. The high court decision said the jury should have been instructed to consider those issues at the same time, which Mr. Josephs' lawyer argued could have reduced the likelihood of his client receiving the death penalty.

us,Song & Laughter; Billie Steals His Heart,"IT was her record of ''Easy Living'' that made me fall in love with Billie Holiday. This was in the era of 78's, when we absorbed our take-home music very differently from LP's and CD's, repeated hearings leading to intimate acquaintance. It was Lester Young's buoyant, dancing tenor sax that grabbed me on the flip side, ''When You're Smiling.'' But on ''Easy Living,'' eight haunting tenor bars notwithstanding, it was Billie: the husky warmth of her sound, the lilting thrust of her phrasing (oh, that bridge!), the impassioned identification she brought to Leo Robin's lyrics, making it poetry, and all aided and abetted by Buck Clayton's muted trumpet obbligato -- two voices melding into one musical stream. That was some 55 years ago, the disc long since worn out, but after many reincarnations (classic Holiday has seldom been out of catalog) and hundreds of hearings, the thrill is not gone.",2002-07-16T05:00:00+0000

The man, Daron Josephs, now 30, was convicted in April 2000 of murdering two other members of a marijuana-distribution ring in 1995. The unanimous ruling by the seven-member court threw out the death sentence because the judge improperly instructed the jury. Under state law, an accomplice cannot be sentenced to death. Yet the jury was told to consider first whether Mr. Josephs committed the murders directly, and then consider whether he was an accomplice. The high court decision said the jury should have been instructed to consider those issues at the same time, which Mr. Josephs' lawyer argued could have reduced the likelihood of his client receiving the death penalty.

But the inquiry, by the Royal Society, stopped short of recommending mass vaccinations, saying instead that vaccinations should be used ''as a major tool of first resort'' when foot-and-mouth has already appeared, to prevent it from spreading to healthy animals. Last year, Britain suffered its worst outbreak of the highly contagious disease in decades, eventually slaughtering some six million animals at risk of infection, but ruling out vaccinations, which makes animals ineligible for export.

Fresh raw peanuts should still be slightly damp to the touch and will smell like earth and new-mown hay. Like their close cousin, edamame, green peanuts should be boiled in salted water until soft, about 45 minutes. Shelled, they make a refreshingly different summer nibble with a flavor between a chickpea and a sweet English pea, with a tannic kick. In the Southeast, they are popular at outdoor events like minor league baseball games, where spent shells and dribbles of peanut brine are not much of a problem.

The indictment of William Hovan, 49, of Trumbull, Conn., came after the grand jury heard testimony from some of the 45 passengers who were injured in the rollover crash. The indictment was sealed because Mr. Hovan had not yet been arrested, said District Attorney R. Michael Tantillo of Ontario County. The state police said Mr. Hovan, fatigued from extended periods of casino gambling, fell asleep as he drove three church groups back to Waterbury from Niagara Falls. Mr. Hovan denied falling asleep and blamed a road bump or blown tire. He will remain free until his arraignment in county court on July 30, when the charges will be unsealed.

us,"QUICK BITE/Wall Township; The Skates Are Gone, but a Drive-In Rolls On","The movie ''American Graffiti'' is itself an oldie, released in 1973. The movie reached a few years further back, to 1962, when a date meant cheeseburgers and malts served curbside by a waitress on roller skates. But there is no need for manufactured nostalgia, as the real thing is still there, at the Circus on Route 35 in Wall, a few miles inland from Spring Lake. It has been owned since its founding in 1954 (as shown here) by Richard Friedel and his wife, Barbara. The food is fast, but it is cooked to order with top-notch ingredients: real roast beef, soft-shell crabs from Maryland ($7.59, served on a soft roll). All baking is done by Barbara Friedel, who says that her chocolate cream pie and fudge cake (both are $2.79 a slice) are the two most popular desserts. From the classic cheesesteak on garlic bread ($4.39) to a club sandwich made with the Jersey classic, pork roll ($4.39), there is something for everyone on this menu; if your children cannot find something to eat here, you are in trouble. Don't drive away without sampling the onion rings ($2.89). They are crispy, greasy, salty and real, not the onion-flavored Styrofoam rings found most places. On a busy summer weekend the Circus crew slices up more than 200 pounds of Spanish onions each day. The only disappointment with the dining experience here may be with your waitress's footwear: no wheels, just ordinary white sneakers. ''Girls on skates lose more food than they serve,'' Mr. Friedel said. Even so, your food will be served on an orange wire tray hooked over the driver's side window; it's fun to dine this way at least once a decade. Beverly Savage",2002-07-21T05:00:00+0000

These are high in fiber, which slows their absorption, preventing a rapid rise in blood sugar.

us,A Matter of Attitude,"Harold Lloyd (1893-1971) will always be remembered as the surprised-looking fellow hanging from the clock in ''Safety Last.'' For many that's all he is; Lloyd comes in last in the holy trinity of silent film comedians, after Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. HAROLD LLOYD: Master Comedian (Abrams, $45) seeks to restore his reputation. Jeffrey Vance, co-author of this book, is not only an ardent fan but also a good critic; he notes, for instance, that despite the signature round horn-rimmed glasses, Lloyd never played exactly the same character. What linked his roles in films like ''The Freshman'' and ''The Kid Brother'' was ''a comic attitude'' that combined ''determination, optimism, ambition and ingenuity.'' Lloyd's hits in the 1920's made him richer than the loopy millionaires he sometimes portrayed, though his appeal quickly waned in the era of sound. The book, written with Suzanne Lloyd, the star's granddaughter, includes a fascinating interview from 1969 in which Lloyd discusses his methods and motives. The book's photographic editor, Manoah Bowman, has chosen astutely from Lloyd's personal trove of crisp black-and-white images. Even in stills, his decency and charm come through.

Virginia Fields. The survey, conducted last month, found that only one agency, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, attaches voter registration forms to applications given to the public, as required by law. And only four agencies had the forms available in their offices. Ms. Fields said voter registration was especially urgent in view of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's call for nonpartisan elections, which might help Republicans and independents. But she did not suggest that the limited availability of forms was intended to hurt Democratic registration.

The deal will enable Bunge, which is based in White Plains, to create a processing capacity in Europe, where demand for soybean-based livestock feed has risen since the epidemic of mad cow disease. Bunge paid $454 million for its stake in Cereol and will assume its debt and offer to buy the remaining 45 percent of the company that is publicly traded, at 32 euros a share, if the deal is approved by both European and American regulators. Shares in Cereol rose 0.1 euro, to 31.5 euros. Separately, Bunge reported second-quarter profit more than doubled because of increased sales to feed and food makers, and declines in the value of the Brazilian real and Argentine peso that lowered production costs in those countries.

Kepco, which provides South Korea with most of its electrical power, said profit in the first half was 1.5 trillion won ($1.3 billion) compared with 890 billion won in the first half of 2001. Profit for the second quarter was 718 billion won ($613 million) compared with 481 billion won last year. The company said sales for the quarter totaled 4.9 trillion won, up 8 percent from the second quarter of last year. A six-week strike forced Kepco, more than 50 percent government-owned, to abandon plans to sell six thermal power plants, but the company still hopes to sell at least one of its major subsidiaries in the next few months.

He married Diana Vaughan Marvin on November 15, 1947 and they lived in New York City, summering in Hallowell, Maine. In the mid-1960s he joined a textile consulting firm, soon becoming a partner, from which he retired in 1974. At the time, the Gibsons changed their primary residence to Hallowell, spending winter months in New York. Mr. Gibson was a member of the Harvard Club and a director of the English Speaking Union. He also served as his Harvard class agent. He became a Director and served a term as President of the Pine Tree State Arboretum, a nonprofit organization in Augusta, Maine. He was a generous benefactor of that organization and volunteered many hours of his time there. He was also a member of the Hallowell Tree Board, among other voluntary activities. The Gibsons were active stewards of the family property known as the Vaughan Woods. They donated a conservation easement to the Kennebec Land Trust that forever protects the woods. George Gibson is survived by his three children, George L. Gibson and his wife, Linda Johns, of New York City, Ellen Vaughan Gibson of Roslindale, MA and David Hallowell Gibson and Susan Gibson of Ballston Lake, New York; and his sister and brother-in-law, Eleanor and Amor Hollingsworth, of Westwood, MA; and by a number of nephews and nieces. Memorial contributions may be made to the Pine Tree State Arboretum or the Kennebec Land Trust. A memorial will be held at a later date.

Seeks Ruling On Copyright Law,"The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit yesterday that seeks to overturn a key provision of a 1998 copyright law that prohibits the creation or distribution of tools that unlock digital copy-protection schemes. The suit asks a federal judge in Boston to rule that the law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, is unconstitutionally broad because it prevents researchers from studying the effectiveness of Internet filtering software or studying the workings of software that is protected by digital locks. The A.C.L.U. is representing Ben Edelman, 22, who served as an expert witness in the organization's successful challenge of the Children's Internet Protection Act earlier this year. Mr. Edelman says filtering software, like the program distributed by N2H2, blocks educational and health Web sites as well as the pornographic sites it is intended to block. He wants to crack the locks on software and publish the list of blocked sites. To do that, he needs to break through N2H2's copy-protection technology, an act that could be seen as a violation of current copyright law. The lawsuit argues that the law must be overturned because it would be within Mr. Edelman's constitutional rights to perform his research. Amy Harmon (NYT)",2002-07-26T05:00:00+0000

(The state Department of Environmental Protection numbers also counted 33 closings in 2000 but came up with 154 for 2001, using a different counting method). The added numbers were the result of tests falling on days after rains, which can wash pollutants into waterways, rather than increased pollution, according to Clean Ocean Action, and the addition of Winward Beach.

Then there is Mack's of Stone Harbor, just a couple of blocks south of the border with Avalon on what is known as Seven-Mile Island. Stone Harbor and Avalon have gotten uppity reputations of late, but Mack's is as down home as they come. Try the Wildwood, a simple $17 wonder with sausage, onions, green peppers and extra cheese. The crust is thin, but holds the toppings with just the right amount of firmness. On the other hand, it is not as stiff as the cardboard-like stuff you get at chain pizza joints. You may have to do the old head-back, slide-a-wedge-down-the-gullet trick, but that is the way pizza was meant to be eaten, especially at the shore. The tomato sauce on Mack's pizza is not the usual bland stuff but nicely spiced with oregano and a little garlic. The isn't just a few blotches of white, but covers the entire pie, and there are accompanying pools of grease. The veggies are fresh and the sausage is cut before your eyes. One extra at Mack's is the see-through rotating brick pizza oven. It cooks the pizza evenly, which is all-important in a thin-crust pie. It also keeps the oven tenders from burning their forearms, so you always have a smile coming from your server. Mack's is not one of those new-fangled pizza palaces that has arugula-and-hearts-of-palm salads and pastas you've never heard of. It's pizza and nonalcoholic drinks and that's it. At Mack's, that's enough. If it's not crowded and your children are lucky, they'll get a piece of dough, not crayons, to play with. Robert Strauss",2002-07-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Sonnets and More -- or Less,"There are no traces of the conventional sonnet in Gerald Stern's AMERICAN SONNETS (Norton, $22) -- these poems are lightly metered, unrhymed and without octave-sestet divisions or 14-line limits. The one trace of the form is thematic: sonnets have always been tiny courtrooms for poets to present their claims to what they love. Stern, moreover, who is not the first American poet to usurp the name while forsaking the form (one thinks of Lowell and Berryman), has always been a love poet. But a note of loss has altered the longing for his beloved world into a kind of pre-emptive grief. This sequence of 59 love poems is nearly a continuous elegy. If you love Stern you go to his poetry for its signature gestures -- exuberance for the useless, ecstasy over the discard, a wild need to surround the whole world with a poem. But his work's strength is its understated (and often ignored) intelligence. The ''struggle to describe the smell of / snow in 1940, mixed as it was with / coal fumes and the rawness of locusts,'' from the poem ''You,'' just about summarizes his whole career, going back to his 1973 collection ''Rejoicings,'' where he confessed his desire to ''close the whole world in my grip.'' Stern is still making his inventory of the American sublime and finding it in string beans, a woman whose breath smells like peanuts, Band-Aids, cigars, Woolworth's, incinerators and the singing group the Ink Spots. ''American Sonnets'' records the sudden and chastening difference measured by more than a quarter-century's experience of ''what my ignorance cost and what my stubbornness.'' J. T.

Critics of omitting stock options from income statements have said that the practice, widely used by software companies, inflates profits by understating expenses. It also encourages executives to use improper accounting to bolster the value of their options, some investors have said. Currently, rules require only an estimate of option costs in accounting footnotes. Shares of Computer Associates rose 60 cents, to $8.70.

She served as president of the Weston High School ParentTeacher Organization in 1996-1997, working closely with parents, teachers, the Board of Education and the school administration. Her doctorate in Community Psychology and her understanding of group dynamics served her well in her tenure with the PTO.

She facilitated seminars with parents and teachers in the school system to help them better understand effective communication skills. The high school also asked Kristine to assist in some difficult and sensitive mediations and conflict resolutions at school. Additionally, Kristine ran a parenting group for mothers of younger children in Hurlbutt Elementary School who asked her to facilitate a group after attending seminars which she conducted. A member of the Academy of Family Mediators, Kristine opened an office for mediation services in 1999 and in addition to mediating family conflicts, she mediated discrimination cases as a certified mediator for the U.S. Postal Service and mediated cases through the Dispute Settlement Center.
