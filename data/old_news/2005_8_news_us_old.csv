Revenue rose 8 percent, prompting the bank to raise its half-year profit forecast. Japan's banks are increasing fees from asset management and securities underwriting to become more competitive with global banks like Citigroup, which has a market value four times that of Mizuho. Profit from lending has lagged as Japan's central bank kept interest rates close to zero since 2001 to combat deflation.

He acknowledged using a scheme to defraud nine people of a total of $70,000 to $100,000. That is the value of car loans that Mr. Gidron, 66, admitted he took over and failed to properly repay. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Mr. Gidron must repay the loans if he is to receive one to three years in prison when he is sentenced next month. In addition, Mr. Gidron owes about $800,000 in unpaid state and federal taxes incurred during his recent probation violations. A spokesman for the State Department of Taxation and Finance, Tom Bergin, said that Mr. Gidron owed more than $13 million in unpaid taxes, but would not say how much he had repaid, citing privacy laws. State tax collectors have closed Mr. Gidron's four car dealerships, he said. A number of powerful New Yorkers went to court to support Mr. Gidron yesterday, including former Mayor David N. Dinkins.

Consumer prices were up from 3.8 percent in June. The Bank of Thailand has raised its benchmark interest rate six times since August to curb inflation and stem the baht's decline. The central bank governor, Pridiyathorn Devakula, left, wants to keep increasing rates to dampen rising consumer prices and attract overseas funds to finance a widening current-account deficit. Thailand began reducing diesel subsidies on June 1, and on July 13 eliminated the remaining fuel price support, ending 18 months of efforts to protect the economy from rising oil prices that had cost the country 92.1 billion baht ($2.2 billion) since January 2004.

The Board of Trustees of Skidmore College and the entire Skidmore family deeply mourn the death of Arthur Zankel, father of Skidmore graduates, trustee emeritus, generous benefactor, loyal friend, and honorary degree recipient. As a trustee, Art brought a wealth of experience, a quick wit, and an incisive mind to bear on the challenges facing the College. As a member of our investment committee, he helped us to build and invest our resources wisely, fueling an unprecedented period of growth in the College's programs and reputation. That same passion and wisdom was evident in his philanthropy at Skidmore, which included significant contributions to provide scholarships and to underwrite programs such as the summer residency of the Boys Choir of Harlem. In addition, he endowed a professorship--the Zankel Chair in Management for Liberal Arts Students, which reflected his belief that liberal arts majors often end up practicing much more management and business than they expect--and a lecture series--the Zankel Lectures, which serves as a forum for the discussion of business issues from a broader societal and ethical perspective. Art leaves an impressive legacy of generosity, commitment, and integrity that will inspire and empower generations of Skidmore students and faculty. He will always be a part of the fabric of our community and we send our deepest condolences to his wife, Judy; his sons, Kenneth (Class of 1982), James (Class of 1992), Mark, and Thomas; his brothers, Martin and Jeffrey; and his grandchildren.

Prosecutors suspect that the woman, identified as Sabine H., a dental hygienist who has been unemployed for years, killed the infants soon after giving birth to them between 1988 and 1999. Their remains were discovered by an acquaintance of the woman who found small human bones in a sand-filled aquarium and several flower pots and boxes in the shed. A state prosecutor said it was still unclear how the infants had died. News reports said the woman is the mother of four living children, ages 20, 19, 18 and almost 2, and is pregnant again.

Also named in the lawsuit, first reported in The Boston Globe, are St. Martin's Press, which published the book in July 2002; the book's editor; and Mr. Burroughs's literary agent. The lawsuit contends that portions of the book concerning the Turcotte family, whose name in the book is changed to Finch, are fictional and were written to sensationalize it and improve its marketability. The lawsuit contends that Mr. Burroughs, above, has publicly identified the Finch family as the Turcottes.

Dozens of parents, teachers and students filled a room at the Department of Education's headquarters in Lower Manhattan to complain about unclear rules concerning what police officers and safety agents are allowed to do when students misbehave. One student said he was handcuffed and searched for reasons he was never told. Many parents and teachers complained about a lack of enforcement of rules that already exist. Officials said a modified code of discipline was expected to be ready next month. Susan Saulny (NYT)",2005-08-04T05:00:00+0000

In ""Let the Good Times Roll,"" she talks to an unseen cameraman named Dave (Ms. Dodge in reality) whom she met when they each mistakenly turned up at the same desolate and windy spot in the desert looking for an outdoor rock concert. Back indoors, she proceeds to tell Dave in extraordinarily vivid detail a long, convoluted and hilarious story about a night of kinky sex, drug consumption, abjection and mystical enlightenment she had shortly after she heard of the death of Kurt Cobain.

us,The Listings: Aug. 5 -- Aug. 11; PIANOS IN THE PARK,"Brad Mehldau and Jason Moran, jazz pianists in their 30's, have both been upheld as auspices for the music's future. They are strikingly different musicians; Mr. Mehldau, above, has a fluid and expressively romantic style, while Mr. Moran favors jagged, delirious polyphony. But they have things in common, too: both emerged as sidemen in high-profile quartets; each came to prominence at the helm of a head-turning trio; and each has forayed fruitfully into nontraditional solo piano. They also have similarly broad-minded approaches to repertory. (Mr. Mehldau performs songs by Radiohead and Nick Drake; Mr. Moran has interpreted Afrika Bambaataa and Bjork.) Mr. Mehldau's most recent album, ""Live in Tokyo"" (Nonesuch), is a solo recital that blends judicious pop offerings with archaic songbook standards, employing a touch that runs from sprightly to somber; he'll play solo here, with his usual ambidextrous grace. At the opposite end of the stylistic spectrum is Mr. Moran's Bandwagon, which has lately been a quartet with electric guitar, but performs here in its original trio incarnation. ""Same Mother"" (Blue Note), the band's latest meteorite of an album, brings an avant-garde mutability to many shades of the blues. In performance, the group tends to walk a razor's edge; its rumbling crescendos should make for a rousing concert closer. The opener is a trio led by Eric Lewis, a percussive and probing young pianist who recently emerged from under the wing of Wynton Marsalis to pursue his own career.

Now imagine it fronted by a guy with punk attitude, a def poet's way with words and some ripping yarns to tell. That frontman is Craig Finn of the Hold Steady. Since moving to Brooklyn a few years back, Mr. Finn, above center, has continued to draw inspiration from his adolescent antics in the Upper Midwest. But his Minneapolis of the mind is no artistic and agricultural idyll. Just like that city's other punk rock bard, Paul Westerberg of the Replacements, Mr. Finn fondly describes a cold and agitated milieu. It's a place where Catholic kids go bad, skip catechism class to sniff OxyContin in caves on the Mississippi Riverbanks, and race drunk down frontage roads. Mr. Finn's singular ranting bark combines Bruce Springsteen's passion with a kind of slacker stream of consciousness. Like the Boss, he's drawn to the darkness at the edge of town. On his band's 2004 album, ""Almost Killed Me"" (French Kiss), he observed militiamen cooking up a batch of crystal meth, and growled: ""There's a war going down in the Middle Western states/The Kevlar vests against the crystal flakes."" On this year's ""Separation Sunday"" (French Kiss), he follows characters with code names like Charlemagne and Casanova as their lives blur from kissing and coke to Born Again reminiscence. In the blush of youth, Mr. Finn's twisted but optimistic hood-rat chick tells him: ""I ain't gonna do anything sexual with you/I'm kinda saving myself for the scene."" But as Catholics like Mr. Finn might say, we start out with original sin -- and there's lots more where that came from.

That frontman is Craig Finn of the Hold Steady. Since moving to Brooklyn a few years back, Mr. Finn, above center, has continued to draw inspiration from his adolescent antics in the Upper Midwest. But his Minneapolis of the mind is no artistic and agricultural idyll. Just like that city's other punk rock bard, Paul Westerberg of the Replacements, Mr. Finn fondly describes a cold and agitated milieu. It's a place where Catholic kids go bad, skip catechism class to sniff OxyContin in caves on the Mississippi Riverbanks, and race drunk down frontage roads. Mr. Finn's singular ranting bark combines Bruce Springsteen's passion with a kind of slacker stream of consciousness. Like the Boss, he's drawn to the darkness at the edge of town. On his band's 2004 album, ""Almost Killed Me"" (French Kiss), he observed militiamen cooking up a batch of crystal meth, and growled: ""There's a war going down in the Middle Western states/The Kevlar vests against the crystal flakes."" On this year's ""Separation Sunday"" (French Kiss), he follows characters with code names like Charlemagne and Casanova as their lives blur from kissing and coke to Born Again reminiscence. In the blush of youth, Mr. Finn's twisted but optimistic hood-rat chick tells him: ""I ain't gonna do anything sexual with you/I'm kinda saving myself for the scene."" But as Catholics like Mr. Finn might say, we start out with original sin - and there's lots more where that came from.

But stop and watch for a few minutes and you will be hooked by the funniest performance artist to appear in a New York art gallery since Alex Bag. In each of two 15-minute videos, Ms. Kahn, above, plays a hapless, badly dressed and coiffed character named Lois, who seems to be teetering on the brink of real insanity as a result of too much California-style hedonism and New Age philosophy. In ""Let the Good Times Roll,"" she talks to an unseen cameraman named Dave (Ms. Dodge in reality) whom she met when they each mistakenly turned up at the same desolate and windy spot in the desert looking for an outdoor rock concert. Back indoors, she proceeds to tell Dave in extraordinarily vivid detail a long, convoluted and hilarious story about a night of kinky sex, drug consumption, abjection and mystical enlightenment she had shortly after she heard of the death of Kurt Cobain. She speaks with such goofy, deadpan earnestness and verbal inventiveness that you wish she would go on for another hour. Somebody, please, give these women money to make a feature-length movie!

us,Jazz Listings,"PIANOS IN THE PARK Brad Mehldau and Jason Moran, jazz pianists in their 30's, have both been upheld as auspices for the music's future. They are strikingly different musicians; Mr. Mehldau, above, has a fluid and expressively romantic style, while Mr. Moran favors jagged, delirious polyphony. But they have things in common, too: both emerged as sidemen in high-profile quartets; each came to prominence at the helm of a head-turning trio; and each has forayed fruitfully into nontraditional solo piano. They also have similarly broad-minded approaches to repertory. (Mr. Mehldau performs songs by Radiohead and Nick Drake; Mr. Moran has interpreted Afrika Bambaataa and Bjork.) Mr. Mehldau's most recent album, ""Live in Tokyo"" (Nonesuch), is a solo recital that blends judicious pop offerings with archaic songbook standards, employing a touch that runs from sprightly to somber; he'll play solo here, with his usual ambidextrous grace. At the opposite end of the stylistic spectrum is Mr. Moran's Bandwagon, which has lately been a quartet with electric guitar, but performs here in its original trio incarnation. ""Same Mother"" (Blue Note), the band's latest meteorite of an album, brings an avant-garde mutability to many shades of the blues. In performance, the group tends to walk a razor's edge; its rumbling crescendos should make for a rousing concert closer. The opener is a trio led by Eric Lewis, a percussive and probing young pianist who recently emerged from under the wing of Wynton Marsalis to pursue his own career.

Investigators said the cockpit and flight data recorders, sent to France, had been successfully downloaded despite damage. The co-pilot, who landed the plane, has been interviewed by investigators but what he said has not been released. Investigators said there was no indication that the aircraft was hit by lightning.

Judge George B. Daniels of Federal District Court in Manhattan wrote in the decision, dated Thursday and released yesterday, that ""there is no substantial similarity"" between ""The Da Vinci Code"" and Mr. Perdue's books ""Daughter of God"" and ""The Da Vinci Legacy."" Both of those books ""involve the unprotectable idea of a mystery thriller set against a religious backdrop,"" Judge Daniels said, but ideas and general literary themes are not protected by copyright. ""Daughter of God"" is more action-packed, ""with several gunfights and violent deaths,"" the judge said, while ""The Da Vinci Code"" is ""an intellectual, complex treasure hunt"" that features clues and puzzles more than ""any physical adventure."" A spokeswoman for Doubleday, Mr. Brown's publisher, said the company was pleased with the decision.

Ireland has no extradition treaty with Colombia, but British authorities said the men would be extradited if they crossed into Northern Ireland.

Imagine that! In recent years, theater chains have adopted the practice, long common in other countries, of warming up the crowd with advertisements. Not advertisements for other movies -- those previews have been a cherished ritual of cinema for decades -- but spots pushing cars, cosmetics and soft drinks. Like television ads, these movie-theater offerings take advantage of the captivity of the audience: they typically run after the posted starting time for a given feature, when everyone has settled in with their Twizzlers and their Pepsis. It was this erosion of the temporal boundary between entertainment and hucksterism that infuriated the public: we pay to see the movie, not to be subjected to invitations to spend more money on something else. And in the face of protest, some exhibitors relented -- a little. In New York, the Loews chain announced that, while it would stop short of pulling the ads, it would institute a measure of truth-in-advertising when listing show times, informing ticket buyers of exactly when the movie itself would start.",2005-08-07T05:00:00+0000

Paul Thomas, who directed Ms. Samson in the remake of ""Miss Jones,"" the 1973 hit that was part of pornography's first venture into the mainstream, agreed that the aesthetics of such films had changed over the last 30 years, and not entirely for the better. ""If the original came out today, I think the sex would have been found lacking,"" said Mr. Thomas. (He is not Paul Thomas Anderson, director of the pornography-theme feature ""Boogie Nights""). ""Most porno put out today is simply a collection of the raunchiest, most extreme sex scenes possible, with no pretense of a story."" Now Vivid Entertainment is betting that a story -- along with a famous title, a contemporary dosage of sex scenes and the presence of the pornography superstar Jenna Jameson as the Devil -- will sell DVD's of the first remake of ""The Devil in Miss Jones,"" which it will release on Sept. 21. (Ms. Samson plays the new Miss Jones.) At $250,000, the production was Vivid's most expensive yet; marketing plans call for simultaneous release in the United States and Europe (in five languages) and a billboard in Times Square. Steven Hirsch, the company's co-chairman, said he expected to sell more than 100,000 copies of the new version domestically in the first year, or 10 times more than the average Vivid film. ""It's a name that everybody knows,"" Mr. Hirsch said. ""It's a compelling story. The story is updated, but it still pays homage to the original.""",2005-08-07T05:00:00+0000

Long-time Minnesota philanthropist and Carlson Companies co-founder Arleen Martin Carlson died August 4 at her home in Minneapolis. She was 93. Arleen was preceded in death by her husband, Curtis L. Carlson. Together, in 1938 on a borrowed $55, they founded the Gold Bond Stamp Company which was the precursor of global travel, hospitality and marketing giant Carlson Companies. Carlson brands today include Radisson, Regent, T.G.I. Friday's, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, Carlson Marketing Group and others. Arleen Martin was born March 10, 1912, in Aberdeen, South Dakota, the only child of Charles and Nellie Martin, who later moved to Minneapolis. There, Arleen attended the University of Minnesota where she met Curtis Carlson. The two were married in 1938. A founding Carlson board member and civic leader, Arleen embodied the Carlson family spirit of faith, persistence, hard work and inclusiveness. In 1999, she donated $10 million to the University of Minnesota, continuing a long family tradition of giving to the institution. To date the family's gifts to the school exceed $46 million, and the University's Curtis L. Carlson School of Management is named in their honor. Continuing a long tradition of support for United Way, in 2000 Arleen made a personal gift of $1 million to the United Way's Century Legacy program. Survivors include two daughters: Carlson Foundation President Barbara Carlson Gage and husband Edwin ""Skip"" Gage, Carlson Companies Chair and CEO Marilyn Carlson Nelson and husband Dr. Glen Nelson; seven grandchildren: Christine Gage, Geoffrey Gage and wife Kelly, Richard Gage and wife Britt, Scott Gage and wife Gina, Curtis Nelson and wife Margie, Diana Nelson and husband John Atwater, Wendy Nelson and partner Daisy Mitchell; 14 great-grandchildren and three step-greatgrandchildren; brother-in-law Warren Carlson; sister-in-law Elaine Carlson, and numerous nieces and nephews.

This seventh novel by the acclaimed Turkish writer is an eerily prescient tour of his country's divided soul. Ka, a poet, has been in exile for 12 years but returns to Istanbul for his mother's funeral. Posing as a journalist, Ka also makes his way to Kars, a decaying city, to investigate a wave of suicides among schoolgirls forbidden to wear their headscarves. Trapped by a snowstorm, Ka witnesses clashes between Kurdish separatists, political Islamists and secular government officials. The Book Review named ""Snow"" one of the 10 best books of 2004; our reviewer, Margaret Atwood, called it ""an engrossing feat of tale-spinning"" and ""essential reading for our times.""",2005-08-07T05:00:00+0000

During the early years of her marriage, Dale and her husband, Taylor, moved from Boston to a farm in Lincolnville, Maine, where they restored the 19th century farmhouse, barn, and outbuildings and raised livestock. In 1983 the family moved to Chestnut Street in Camden. Following the birth and rearing of her four children, Dale resumed her formal education, earning a B.A. with honors in anthropology from the University of Maine in 1993. Dale's energetic zest for life, curiosity, and ability to connect with people of every stripe was legendary. Her work as an anthropologist, her love of of textiles, and her readiness for adventure fostered her world-wide travels. Dale was a memorable catalyst, and her life story speaks to her ability to attract people and make things happen. Dale's generosity and passion created opportunities for the countless people people that crossed her path. Professionally Dale independently produced the documentary for the MBPN series True North titled Acadian Yarns. Broadcast in 1999, the work examined a women's cooperative in the St. John valley in northern Maine. In 2002, after three years of research in New Mexico, Dale co-wrote with C. Stewart Dody and Herbert Benally the book Photographing Navajos. The publication featured original photographs taken on the Navajo Reservation in the early 1950's by John Collier Jr, and gave historical interviews with the original subjects and their descendants. This publication culminated in a traveling exhibition titled Photographing Navajos: On The Reservation, which pre viewed at the Albuquerque Museum in 2001-2002. Dale also wrote a chapter called Maine Yarns: Wool Textiles among Acadian Women in the Saint John River Valley that was published in 2005 in the edition Of Place and Gender: Women in Maine History. Recently, Dale initiated a project for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh to create a permanent exhibition showing the original photographs of the 1938 Belcher Islands Expedition with the Hudson Bay area and the local Inuit population as they currently exist today. A memorial in her name has been established at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Perhaps the greatest testament to Dale lies in the facing of her own illness. Dale charged full steam ahead, anxious to experiment with the most aggressive treatment options available, and relishing each day with her signature optimism, courage and style. She exceeded every expectation of her medical team, and along the way garnered the love and awe of a vast network of devoted friends that includes the many Midcoast Maine families who shared child-raising years with the Mudges, members of the Navajo nation, knitters from a rural cooperative in the St. John Valley, anthropological colleagues, members of her extended family, childhood friends, and recent acquaintances. Dale is survived by her husband of 35 years, Taylor Mudge, and her four children: Webster of New York City; Matthew of Portland, Oregon; Samuel of Seattle, Washington; and Sarah of New York City. A service in her memory will be held on September 10th at 1 o'clock at the the Rockport, Maine Opera House. Contributions in her name may be made to the Tanglewood 4-H Learning Center in Lincolnville, Maine or to the Dale Mudge Fund, Carnegie Musuem of Natural History, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",2005-08-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Inside the List,"McCARTHY HEARING: ""I sent one boy to the gas chamber at Huntsville."" That's the plain-spoken first sentence of Cormac McCarthy's new novel, ""No Country for Old Men."" But if the postings on McCarthy-obsessed Web sites are any indication, not all his fans are happy with it. ""No Country for Old Men"" is set in Texas, and the bummer about McCarthy's opening line is that, as Web critics have pointed out -- and as the director of the Texas Prison Museum, Jim Willett, confirms -- Texas has never executed anyone in a gas chamber. ""That's a hell of an error,"" one fan wrote. ""I mean, the very first sentence of the book."" (When asked about the line, McCarthy said through his publicist at Knopf, ""I put it in there to see if readers were on their toes."") McCarthy, whose propulsive novel enters the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 8, is no stranger to this page. While none of his first five novels sold more than 3,000 copies in hardcover, his sixth, ""All the Pretty Horses"" (1992), was his breakthrough -- it stayed on the hardcover list for more than five months. The next two books in his Border Trilogy -- ""The Crossing"" (1994) and ""Cities of the Plain"" (1998) -- made the list for 12 and 7 weeks, respectively. Critics seem to agree that if ""No Country for Old Men"" probably isn't McCarthy's best book, it's his most accessible. As one fan wrote on cormacmccarthy.com, ""It's obvious to me that McCarthy has an account at Blockbuster, he's seen 'Pulp Fiction,' 'One False Move,' 'Natural Born Killers.' "" Another wrote, ""I think the book deserves the Pulitzer Prize.""",2005-08-07T05:00:00+0000

Earlier, such stories would have been set in obscure corners of the world, like the imaginary land where Lemuel Gulliver encountered the Lilliputians.

He was the son of Ilo Browne Wallace and Henry Agard Wallace, the latter a former Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President of the United States. H.B. received a BS from Iowa State College in 1938 where he studied genetics. In the manner of many extraordinary Americans, H.B. carried on his family's tradition of philanthropy, scientific research and community service. His revolutionary breakthroughs in the science of poultry breeding have greatly boosted the international effort to feed the earth's burgeoning human population. Putting together a staff of geneticists, immunologists, nutritionists and management specialists, he directed their pursuit of both basic and applied research. Upon retiring to Scottsdale, AZ in 1985, H.B. developed a passion for arid lands and in particular the Sonoran Desert. Combined with his support of the McDowell Sonoran Land Trust and the Desert Foothills Land Trust, he placed a conservation easement on 80 acres of his undeveloped property to ensure its lasting protection. He has created a unique botanical center housing one of the world's largest non-commercial collection of cacti and succulents. The Wallace Desert Gardens has served as a free research facility for scientists, ecologists, educators and students from universities, non-profit organizations and agencies. H.B.'s passion for scientific research was undiminished from his college days. He has granted millions of dollars to numerous universities and foundations for research in the fields of mercury-related illnesses, cancer, heart disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). H.B. was a strong believer that the future of America rested with its young people. His interest in the youth of America was evidenced in generous support of the Belin-Blank International Center for Gifted Education and Talent Development, an innovative program which uses sophisticated assessment tools and technology to provide scholarships and coursework. He initiated the Rural Schools Program for Gifted Students at the Belin-Blank Center. He felt children from rural schools should have the opportunity to have their talents developed without limits because of school size and geography. Gifted students from rural areas should be provided with scholarships to attend Belin-Blank Center. His support led to the formation of the H.B. Wallace Research Symposium, this Symposium has been internationally acclaimed as the research conference in gifted education. He gave support to many other national and international schools, including Russia and the Cayman Islands. Henry had been honored to receive a Doctorate of Science from Cumberland College in Williamsburg, KY. He was also in the Veterans Hall of Fame and received the ALS Campaign Medal for ""service before self"" in the fight against Lou Gehrig's disease. Henry leaves his wife, Jocelyn, his sister, Jean Wallace Douglas, his children, Henry (wife Cindy and children Jenelle and Kristin), Joan Myers (husband Bernard Lopez and children Raymond Buetens and Julian Buetens), Linda Wallace Gray (husband John), Diane (husband Jeff Yusem and daughter Heather), and his stepchildren, Juliet, Eric, Thomas, Clarice, Marshall, Angus and Alex (wife Robin) Gilchrist. Henry was a visionary, an eccentric, irascible and gentle man who was able to ""chop"" immediately an unworkable plan. He was able to adhere like the strongest glue to an idea whose time had not yet been recognized by the rest of us. Reclusive but enjoying individuals, agnostic but honoring goodness, he always maintained his integrity of heart, brain and soul.

What are his storytelling techniques? Questions like these will be explored in a three-day academic symposium beginning on Sept. 9 at Monmouth University in West Long Branch, N.J., The Associated Press reported. The organizer, Mark Bernhard, a Pennsylvania State University conference planner and a self-described Springsteen nut, said he expected the event to be attended by more than 270 educators, music historians and Springsteen fans. After days of rain, mud and music, on Monday, Aug. 18, 1969, the 30,000 fans remaining from the 400,000 who had swarmed to Bethel, N.Y., heard Jimi Hendrix, backed by the Gypsy Sun and Rainbows Band, close the Woodstock Festival. Now that historic moment in rock, never available commercially in its entirety, according to Billboard, is to be issued on a double-disc DVD. The set, ""Jimi Hendrix Live at Woodstock,"" is to be released by Universal Music and Experience Hendrix on Sept. 12 in Britain and Sept. 13 in the United States. The DVD includes a documentary, ""The Road to Woodstock""; a contemporary news conference; and other material. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER",2005-08-08T05:00:00+0000

But given the repeat of the very problem that two years of retooling was supposed to resolve, the verdict is necessarily mixed.

CBS's numbers benefited from the absence of the low-rated Monday edition of ""Rock Star: INXS,"" which was broadcast on VH1, its Viacom sibling. A ""Two and a Half Men"" repeat took its place at 9:30 and drew 9.95 million viewers, far more people than have watched ""Rock Star"" on recent Mondays. For the week that ended on Sunday, CBS was No. 1 in total viewers for the 10th week in a row and also edged out Fox among adults 18 to 49.

That's no shock, given Ms. Hill's platinum sales record, but two other new albums on the chart reached surprisingly high. Teairra Mar, a 17-year-old R&B singer, is at No. 5 with her debut album, ""Roc-A-Fella Presents Teairra Mar"" (Roc-A-Fella); that album, which includes the hit ""Make Her Feel Good,"" sold 69,000 copies in its first week. And ""Kidz Bop 8"" (Razor & Tie), a compilation of toddler-friendly versions of pop hits, sold 67,000 copies to reach No. 6. Last week's No. 1, the 19th volume in the ""Now That's What I Call Music!"" pop anthology series, fell to No. 2, and Mariah Carey's ""Emancipation of Mimi"" (Island/Def Jam), an enduring summer hit, holds at No. 3. Young Jeezy, a rapper from Atlanta, slipped two spots from last week, landing at No. 4 with ""Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101"" (Def Jam). BEN SISARIO",2005-08-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"Arts, Briefly; The Rolling Stones Enter Political Fray","Mick Jagger is giving the White House a bit of lip. Treading political terrain covered already by artists including Eminem, Green Day and Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones' new album includes a song railing against well-connected contractors and the war on terrorism. In the song, ""Sweet Neo Con,"" Mr. Jagger sings, ""How come you're so wrong / My sweet neo con? / Where's the money gone / In the Pentagon?"" according to lyrics provided by a band representative. The rock band, still one of the most successful touring attractions in the business, has touched on political themes before, in such classics as ""Street Fighting Man."" But the new song, which also references Halliburton, the energy-services company that employed Dick Cheney before he became vice president, comes at a time when the nation's sharp political divisions have left the recording industry uncertain about how to handle sensitive topics. The Rolling Stones may not find out how fans respond to ""Sweet Neo Con,"" from their forthcoming ""A Bigger Bang"" album, unless they perform it on tour. Virgin Records, the Stones' label, is not promoting the song to radio stations. The N.F.L. plans to broadcast some of a taped Stones' concert in the pregame show before the New England Patriots take on the Oakland Raiders on Sept. 8, but it will not be selecting ""Sweet Neo Con,"" said to Brian McCarthy of the N.F.L. ""We're not asking them to throw passes or discuss politics,"" Mr. McCarthy said. ""We can draw from an extensive list of songs."" Fran Curtis, a spokeswoman for the band, said, ""People can disagree and still be friends."" JEFF LEEDS",2005-08-11T05:00:00+0000

Joe was born on July 16, 1915, in Yonkers. In 1935 he was hired as a radio announcer by WMCA, beginning an association of three decades. In the army, 1945-46, he served in Germany where he wrote and starred in ""The Joe O'Brien Show"" on AFN. For WMCA he hosted the popular ""Gallegher and O'Brien Show,"" 1949-58. Joe's theater work included directing and acting for the Great Neck Community Theatre and the Hampton Playhouse, NH; in 1957 he co-founded the Cricket Theatre in New York, where he directed plays including Bernard Kops' The Hamlet of Stepney Green and Jean Anouilh's Ardele. As one of the WMCA Good Guys he was a major presence in Top 40 radio of the 1960s, and (with his imaginary sidekick ""Benny"") maintained wide popularity in his morning time slot.

While online sellers are warning of shipping delays of one to two weeks, Carrie Thornton, the book's editor, said copies could begin to arrive in stores beginning tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon the book ranked No. 3 on the best-sellers list on the Barnes & Noble Web site and No. 2 on Amazon.com. Written by the humorist Mark Leyner and Dr. Billy Goldberg, a New York physician, the book was initially published in a $12.95 paperback edition, rather than in hardcover. In addition to the title question (the answer to which will not be revealed here), the book tackles puzzlers like why asparagus makes urine smell (and why you're more likely to smell that smell in France than in Britain), what causes an ice cream headache and why old people grow hair on their ears.

us,JUELZ SANTANA & KANO,"Juelz Santana, a wildly charming Harlem rapper, is to be the headliner at a trans-Atlantic hip-hop concert that could be one of this summer's most exciting musical afternoons, with a few big ifs: if the weather cooperates, if the crowd cooperates, if the performers cooperate. A protg of Cam'ron, Mr. Santana, above, raps almost without rapping: instead of a conventional stanza, you get a series of barked-out phrases. He loves to issue outlandish statements, sometimes repeating himself just to make clear his disdain for the rules of the genre. The latest in a long line of his great mixtape hits is ""There It Go (the Whistle Song),"" in which he is accompanied by a mechanical rhythm and wolf whistle; expect a riotous performance, as long as he shows up. (Somewhere a bookie is working out the odds.) He is to be joined by Kano, one of the brightest lights of the London hip-hop offshoot known as grime. Where other stars of the genre spit frantically (and thrillingly) to stay atop the jagged beats, Kano barely seems to break a sweat; his smooth but tricky delivery creates the seductive impression that the music is bending to match the rhythms he makes with his mouth. (With DJ Cameo and others, tomorrow at 2 p.m., East River Amphitheater, East River Park, Grand Street at the East River, Lower East Side, www.goldspotmusic.com; free.) As it happens, this is only one of three concerts celebrating grime this weekend. Kano is to be the headliner at what looks like a great party tomorrow night at the Knitting Factory, along with a DJ set from Diplo. (At 10, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $12.) And tonight at the Knitting Factory, the grime kingpin Wiley is the headliner at a concert featuring his crew, Roll Deep, alongside DJ A-Trak, DJ Ayres and others. (At 11:30 ; $12.)

us,Adventures Outside the Classical Canon: Pathfinding Composers,"It is hard to know, anymore, exactly how to define contemporary Western classical music. How recent does a work have to be? For that matter, how Western does it have to be, with, for example, the stimulating incursions Chinese composers have made in the United States? And does the term ""classical"" even retain any significance as the music returns to its roots, in a sense, becoming ever more saturated with pop gestures and idioms? However you choose to define it, ""serious"" music seems livelier and more variegated today than it has in many a decade, a trend the classical music critics of The New York Times are eager not only to acknowledge but also to encourage. And so, with rough justice, we present for your consideration and listening pleasure critics' selections of CD's by a handful of composers who we think deserve broader recognition, however disparate the starting points. They are Olivier Messiaen, Luciano Berio, Alfred Schnittke, John Corigliano and Stephen Hartke. Some are alive, some dead, and there is little to unite them in terms of age or nationality. But you have to start somewhere, and all at least helped set the table for 21st-century music; some are still partaking of the feast. JAMES R. OESTREICH",2005-08-12T05:00:00+0000

Whatever your dance ambitions, the Battery Park City Parks Conservancy's ""Dancing Through the Decades"" program tomorrow evening should satisfy. Felix and All the Cats, a 10-member swing band led by Felix Endico, above, will perform a mix of standards and original compositions from the group's newest album, ""At the Rainbow Room,"" as Bill Kline and Katrine Bangsgaard demonstrate basic steps and call the Charleston, the Lindy Hop, the Twist and the Hustle. All told, it's more than a hundred years' worth of American social dancing and centuries of cumulative musical experience, including the 83-year-old trombonist Eddie Bert, a Benny Goodman alumnus, and the 84-year-old bassist Leonard Gaskin, a Brooklyn native who played with a Who's Who of musical legends on West 52nd Street in Manhattan in its jazz heyday. Mr. Kline and Ms. Bangsgaard, both 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center instructors, are also husband and wife, but neither a partner nor experience is needed for interested participants. The conservancy encourages all ages and a communal atmosphere, and large portions of the evening will consist of free-style dancing. So hustle up a few neighbors, dig out those dancing shoes and swing till the sun sets.

Name tags also help us to evaluate and interpret work we have not seen before. So to withhold the name of the artist deliberately, as Triple Candie is doing in its current show -- and as it did with a different artist last summer -- is a provocative gesture. Like last year's, this year's artist is well known, said the gallery co-directors, Shelly Bancroft and Peter Nesbett, but for the occasion has done something much different from what he or she is best recognized for. In a style you might call urban arte povera, the artist has evoked a gritty metropolitan ambience.

For more than half a century, this Lithuanian-born artist has been making intensely personal films (now videos) that testify to the creative durability of Romanticism even as they furnish a richly textured portrait of his adopted home, New York City. Among Mr. Mekas's many achievements, one of the finest remains ""Lost, Lost, Lost"" (1976), a beautifully constructed diary film consisting of material from three decades, beginning in 1949 and ending in 1963. At once rough-hewn and delicate, marked by jagged edits and held together by the lyrical voice-over of Mr. Mekas, above, this portrait of the artist initially presents him as a young, displaced person trying to carve out room for himself within Brooklyn's immigrant community. It wasn't until Mr. Mekas moved to downtown Manhattan and joined a wilder, woollier tribe, whose members included Allen Ginsberg, Ken Jacobs and LeRoi Jones (before he became Amiri Baraka), that the filmmaker breathed more sympathetic air. Mr. Mekas might never have found a paradise to match the one he lost when he fled Lithuania during World War II. But to watch ""Lost, Lost, Lost"" is to think that for a time, downtown New York, with its cheap rents and band of bohemians, was as close to heaven as a young artist could get. ""Lost, Lost, Lost"" will play at Anthology Film Archives, which Mr. Mekas helped found and continues to assist in running, in a newly preserved print. (The film will be shown today through Aug. 18 at Anthology, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212)505-5181.) MANOHLA DARGIS THE LISTINGS: AUG. 12 TO AUG. 18",2005-08-12T05:00:00+0000

Budget appropriations over all will increase to $621.3 million for fiscal year 2006, up from $615.2 million this year, according to the institution's federal budget, released this week. But money for revitalization, planning and construction of facilities will drop to $99.5 million from $126.1 million. Officials said much of the drop is due to the completion of costly renovations of the Patent Office building, built into last year's budget, and that they actually received $9 million more for facilities upkeep than they had requested. Still, the budget announcement comes on the heels of a report by the Government Accountability Office that detailed a ""broad decline in the Smithsonian's aging facilities,"" including water leaks, asbestos problems and other maintenance concerns that threaten collections. The Smithsonian estimates that it will need $2.3 billion over the next nine years to address the problems. Next year's budget may leave the museum complex running behind.

According to the police, Officer Griggs was arrested on Wednesday night lugging trash bags full of marijuana, heroin, cocaine, cigarettes, rolling papers and other contraband into the jail. The scheme, prosecutors said, involved a jailed drug dealer, Jibreel Williams, who placed orders over the telephone to his girlfriend, Janie K. Singletary, in suburban Orange. Officer Griggs then picked up the drugs and contraband at Ms. Singletary's home and smuggled them into the jail, prosecutors said. Officer Griggs has been charged with official misconduct and drug possession and conspiracy. Mr. Williams, 25, and Ms. Singletary, 31, face similar charges. All three remain in jail.

As a kid I used to take pajamas, and mix and match them to try to come up with a super costume. This was the first time I dressed up as Superman as an adult. I was taking pictures with young and old alike, people coming up and saying 'Hey, Superman, can I have your picture? Hey, Superman, can I have your autograph.' There were little kids there saying 'Can you fly? Can you run real fast? Can you do tricks of strength?' It was sort of intoxicating: you're just wearing spandex for the most part, and people still had that respect. There's a lot of reverence for Superman in Metropolis.""

This strange nude undergarment -- part girdle, part armor -- reshaped his cast of runway models into an army of walking dress forms upon which Galliano pinned a lesson in fashion history. Galliano's strategy was to draw attention to what goes on behind the seams (even punctuating the statement with wrist corsages made from pincushions). And indeed, his collection ultimately served as a reminder that the real beauty of haute couture is on the inside.

But eventually, he settles down and spins out the story of the man who went from the dole to boxing's biggest crown. Richer, however, is the tale of Max Baer, the conflicted champion whom Braddock defeated for the title. A playboy haunted by the death of at least one opponent, Baer fought for money and fame more than pride and family. His Jewishness, glanced at in Howard's film, became a rallying point (and a marketing tool), especially in his bout with the Nazis' hero, the German fighter Max Schmeling.

us,UP FRONT,"Francine Prose, the author of 13 books of fiction -- and the review of a biography of Eudora Welty on Page 21 -- says she thinks of herself as ""a novelist who happens to do other things."" Along with plenty of book reviewing, those things include journalism and critical essays, travel writing, translating and editing, and, in the past few years, art criticism. In a recent conversation, she explained that she has always followed her own curiosity when deciding what to tackle next, whether it's a novel about religious devotion (""Household Saints"") or a fictional dissection of academic politics (""Blue Angel""). She hasn't steered away from difficult subjects -- her novel ""A Changed Man"" features a sympathetic skinhead and a self-absorbed Holocaust survivor -- and she seems to thrive on the pressure of deadlines: her biography of Caravaggio is coming this fall; ""Reading Like a Writer"" (""about learning to write by reading great literature instead of attending another writing workshop"") is scheduled for next year; and she's deep into another novel. Although she never met Welty and their lives are vastly different, Prose (a married New Yorker, the mother of two sons) understands how frustrating it was for Welty to have been pigeonholed as a kind of mythic Southern maiden aunt: ""You get stuck with a label -- social satirist is mine -- and it's hard to be seen in a different way. I was surprised to learn that the supposedly reclusive Eudora Welty traveled more widely and had a better social life than I do."" The Editors",2005-08-14T05:00:00+0000

Born February 18, 1917, in New York City, he was the son of George Justus and Mabel Porter Detmold. A 1938 graduate of Cornell University, where he captained the fencing team and coached its saber men, he earned the AB, AM, and PhD degrees there before joining the Army during World War II. Commissioned in Ordnance, he was sent to the Chinese Language School at Yale University before overseas assignment to the X Force of the Chinese Training and Combat Command, serving in Ramgarh, India, along the Ledo Road into Burma, and in China's Yunan Province. At war's end, Lieutenant Detmold returned to Cornell as Instructor in English and Assistant Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, before moving up Cayuga Lake to teach English at Wells College in Aurora, NY. After completing a course in higher educational administration at Columbia University's Teachers College, he became Dean of Gallaudet College in Washington, DC, which awarded him an honorary LittD degree in 1996. Meanwhile, he carried on an avocational career in non-commercial theatre, directing more than 200 productions with college students and amateur actors in community theatres. He also designed Gallaudet's first theatre building. Realizing the dramatic power of sign language, he directed a series of classical dramas in sign language, including Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, Oedipus the King, The Trojan Women, Iphigenia in Aulis, and Medea. The student actors in these critically acclaimed productions, with the support of the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Foundation, went on to form the world-renowned National Theatre of the Deaf. After retiring, Mr. Detmold moved to St. Augustine in 1976. He leaves his wife, Louise, a son and daughter-in-law, Christopher and Dorrit, of St. Augustine; two stepsons, Eugene Y. Willis III and Dr. Amos Johns Willis of Fredericksburg, VA; a granddaughter, Maya, and great-granddaughter, Zoe, of Newport News, VA; a brother, John, of Leeds, MA; six nephews and five nieces.

This first novel by the founding editor of Zoetrope: All-Story is fantasy fiction for wealthy, young, soulless Manhattan-dwelling women with Lady Chatterley tendencies. Brodeur's two heroines, sporting red lipstick, blas anti-intellectualism and a yen for slumming, click their heels and return -- gratefully -- to a time preceding the women's movement. Before whisking her rapidly regressing girlfriends off to the country, Brodeur takes a few potshots at city types; for example, ""hipsters from the art world"" who have ""unwashed hair, scuffed shoes and untucked shirttails."" Couldn't we be a tad more specific? Hooked up to an iPod playing the Arcade Fire? Dutifully on their way to the Film Forum? Chortling over Vice magazine? We're supposed to side with the smug, well-heeled heroines against artsy types, as well as against all modern urban men who can't put up shelves or chop wood. Convinced that feminism ruined dating, the women wish all men were like their farmer friend, Cooper: ""He holds doors and carries things, and it never feels patronizing. It feels natural."" To convert sushi-nibbling sissies into bacon-scarfing alpha males, the women start a retreat on Cooper's farm. There the gentlemen repair fences and the ladies play damsels in distress (literally, in a game where they pretend to get lost). Predictably, the men develop great tans, the women are enveloped in strong arms, and readers learn why 1960's-era feminists are appalled by the ""Sex and the City"" generation.",2005-08-14T05:00:00+0000

Bankrolled by mob associates, this 1972 crime against celluloid starred the hapless LINDA LOVELACE (ne Boreman) as a good-time gal with a bizarre anatomical anomaly.

Today, Halifax is better known for its lobster, which you can fill up on from morning (lobster eggs Benedict anyone?) till night and still have enough cash left for a sail around the harbor on a tall ship. A vibrant student population - six universities with more than 30,000 students - gives the city of 115,000 a youthful, bohemian feel, too.

us,The Listings: Aug. 19 -- Aug. 25; 'PRECIOUS MOMENTS',"Mall culture, with its peculiar poignancies, is the theme of ""Precious Moments,"" a smart, sad five-person group show organized by the artist Josh Kline. Liz Rywelski, a member of the Space 1026 collective in Philadelphia, sets the tone with two large series of photographic portraits, of which she is the subject. She had the pictures taken in photo studios of Kmarts and Wal-Marts across the country. At each store, she told the staff a story, real or invented, about her life, then let them style the image they felt was most ""her."" In some, she looks like a schoolgirl, in others like a matron, in still others like a country-western star. And in all of them, she is a passive screen on which other people can project tastes, expectations and fantasies. Brian Belott deals in found-fantasy, too, but in a more hands-on way. He collects packets of lost or abandoned snapshots from junk shops and trash bins, chooses those that interest him, and arranges them in cheap albums by theme: dozens of pictures of televisions, say, or middle-American dining rooms decorated for holidays. Although there's an occasional hint of a narrative, people rarely appear; he lets their snapshots of the things they value, and an illusion of individuality common to us all, speak for them. Shana Moulton raises illusion to the spiritual plane in a video titled ""Whispering Pines No. 5"" (above), in which she plays a New Ager named Cynthia, who performs rituals of regeneration while wearing an American Indian blanket. Or rather an electric blanket -- mall-bought, no doubt -- printed with American Indian motifs. But for true mall realness, you must turn to two other artists. From Walead Beshty comes a picture of a boarded-up ""dead mall,"" only a few years old and already killed by the competition. And from Michael Smith, the show's senior artist, there is an unnerving document of a mall of yesteryear. In his photographic cartoon strip, ""The Biggest Building in the World,"" dated 1982-2005, the artist appears wandering through an indoor plaza, in a self-contained and inviting commercial ecosystem, that turns out to be the main concourse of the World Trade Center.

In the first episode, Mel's most recent screening was a disaster, he can't get an appointment with a certain celebrity dentist, and his wife found women's undies in his car. ""Greg the Bunny"" stars the title character, a multitalented puppet, in short film homages. The first is ""Bunnie Hall,"" with Greg in the Woody Allen role. In this version, he not only knows how to ""speak lobster""; he falls in love with one. Finally, ""The Festival"" is a dark comedy about an obscure small-town film festival and the peculiar characters who are part of it.",2005-08-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"36 Hours in Halifax, Nova Scotia","HALIFAX is a harbor city steeped in maritime history. Founded in 1749 as a British naval and military base, it originally served as a strategic counter to French bases elsewhere in Atlantic Canada -- and many years later as an assembly point for shipping convoys during World Wars I and II. Today, Halifax is better known for its lobster, which you can fill up on from morning (lobster eggs Benedict anyone?) till night and still have enough cash left for a sail around the harbor on a tall ship. A vibrant student population -- six universities with more than 30,000 students -- gives the city of 115,000 a youthful, bohemian feel, too. As a result, it's often compared to that other hilly town on the ocean, San Francisco, but you'll find that Halifax's blend of fair-trade coffee bars, wharfside lobster shacks and public gardens is special.

us,The Listings: Aug. 19 -- Aug. 25; JALEEL SHAW,"A decade ago, a young musician like Jaleel Shaw would probably be touting a major-label recording debut. But the market for new jazz artists has roughly followed the same trajectory as the Internet bubble, and so Mr. Shaw, above, has instead been compelled to announce his arrival with ""Perspective,"" a CD on the Barcelona-based label Fresh Sound New Talent. Musically, this may not be a bad thing; the album is a showcase for Mr. Shaw's stout, self-assured alto saxophone playing and his smartly conceived original compositions, without the taint of commercial pressure. ""Perspective"" also introduces a strikingly cohesive ensemble of Mr. Shaw's peers, including the drummer Johnathan Blake, a childhood friend from Philadelphia; the guitarist Lage Lund and the bassist Vicente Archer, fellow graduates of the Berklee College of Music; and the pianist Robert Glasper, who released his own Fresh Sound album before signing with Blue Note Records this year. Altogether, these musicians are stewards of a next-generation jazz mainstream that's inspired, not constrained, by timeworn traditions. Mr. Shaw's sound on alto saxophone can variously suggest Cannonball Adderley, Jackie McLean or his mentor, Bobby Watson -- it's brawny and full-bodied, but capable of quicksilver actions -- and his improvisational method is surefooted and exploratory. His songs range in tone from ""The Heavyweight Champ,"" an intricately boppish charger, to ""Miss Myriam,"" a melancholy ode in waltz time. On these originals and a few choice covers (like ""Grand Central,"" a barnburner memorably recorded by Adderley and John Coltrane), Mr. Shaw's crew provides evidence of jazz's vigorous health -- and the upside of independence.

us,The Listings: Aug. 19 -- Aug. 25; KATE BURTON,"When it comes to dishing out brittle dialogue in a drawing room, Kate Burton talks the talk better than any American actress of her generation. Whether playing a grandiloquent Victorian actress in ""The Elephant Man"" or a quip-dispensing Sapphist in David Mamet's ""Boston Marriage,"" Ms. Burton has never been less than fluent in the ornate language of epigrams. What sets her apart, though, is her gift for finding psychological grit in linguistic sparkle, a trait most happily in evidence in Mark Brokaw's production of W. Somerset Maugham's ""Constant Wife"" for the Roundabout Theater Company, which closes Sunday. As the title character in this 1926 tale of marital infidelity, Ms. Burton (above with John Dossett) turns the manners in comedy of manners into potent, all-conquering weapons. Like her Hedda Gabler (on Broadway in 2001), Ms. Burton's Constance Middleton comes across as the brightest, most forward-thinking person in a roomful of dim relics. Intelligence and a wicked sense of humor were what finally destroyed Hedda, in Ms. Burton's rendering of her. They are what allow her Constance to triumph, while illuminating unexpected Shavian ironies in Maugham's droll charting of the intersection of economic and sexual power in the early 20th century.

The designer, Marc Ecko, was granted a permit several weeks ago for a block party that was to celebrate the coming release of a video game he designed in which characters spray-paint their graffiti tags throughout an imaginary city. City officials opposed the permit, in part because the program included a demonstration in which famous graffiti writers planned to paint mock subway cars. City officials feared that this would incite crime. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has implied that the permit hinged on the demonstration's being dropped from the block party program. Mr. Ecko said he had no plans to do so. Jim Rutenberg (NYT)",2005-08-19T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: Aug. 19 -- Aug. 25; SUFJAN STEVENS,"You could say that the indie folk singer-songwriter and banjoist Sufjan Stevens believes in state's rights. That is, this Detroit native and questing Christian, now living in Brooklyn, believes in every state's right to be the subject of a gentle, exhaustive album. His second offering in this monumental project, ""Illinois"" (Asthmatic Kitty), is a 22-song swing through Prairie State history. Of course, historical tidbits like the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, homesteader hardship and the relative debating talents of Lincoln and Douglas mostly provide a jump-off for self-reflection. A man of his times, the 30-year-old Mr. Stevens, above, is both a legitimate history buff and a Google tourist. He is imbued with an outward-looking, Copland-esque musical vision and a narcissistic idea of the surveyable self reminiscent of Walt Whitman, though his lyrics can have an emo overreach and his compositions tend to forge into the folksily baroque. But his quiet, assured voice and pained personal revelations keep things intimate. At his best, Mr. Stevens has our pleasure in mind, as when the humorously titled ""Come on, Feel the Illinoise"" slides out of its complex meter into a simpler rhythm. When Mr. Stevens's lyrical approach succeeds, as in his account of a friend's death from bone cancer, falling on Casimir Pulaski Day, it can be breathtaking. When it doesn't, it can be a trifle maddening, especially when the melody is indelible. An antifolk aria about John Wayne Gacy disingenuously turns a falsetto lament for the killer's victims into an inward-looking recrimination. But such indulgences are forgivable for an emotional cartographer who promises so much.

The announcement, made late Thursday, came two days after the Grammy-winning rapper canceled the 12-date European leg of his Anger Management tour, citing exhaustion and unspecified medical issues. The tour was scheduled to end with a Sept. 17 performance at Slane Castle in Ireland. Since releasing his first album in 1999, Eminem has kept a demanding schedule. He has since produced three other solo studio albums (including the best-seller of 2002, ""The Eminem Show,"" which has sold 9.4 million copies), two albums with his rap crew D12, and a soundtrack to his semi-autobiographical film, ""8 Mile."" Last month, the rapper, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, denied reports that he planned to retire from recording and touring. Paul Rosenberg, his manager, said at the time that Eminem's current album, ""Encore,"" was ""the close of the first chapter of Eminem the recording artist."" He added, ""To speculate beyond that is just a guess."" Eminem's current tour, with 50 Cent, had suffered from lackluster box-office sales, compounded by what analysts regarded as high ticket prices and the historically weak track record of live rap concerts. Before the news of his medication dependency, Interscope Records, the label that distributes his albums, was in the early stages of planning an Eminem greatest-hits package, intending to release it the next few months; it is now unclear when the project will be completed.

Her father, Edmund Lillienstern, died when she was nine, and she came to the United States at age 13, with her mother, a U.S. citizen by birth. Eva spoke no English when she arrived, but became fluent in the language by the time she finished high school and went on to Barnard College. During WWII, she completed the program at Columbia-Presbyterian School of Nursing, worked for a year at the Hospital and then began a long association as a public health nurse with the Visiting Nurse Service of New York. She took graduate courses at Teachers College, and in 1952, to pursue her abiding passion for constitutional law, she entered the Columbia University Law School. After her first year, she took a leave of absence to accompany her husband for a year in Boston. She returned to New York with a five-week-old baby, the first of her four sons, and decided then to be a full-time homemaker. She lived with her young family for a time in London, St. Louis, and New York City before moving to Garden City where she resided for the past 38 years. As a proud homemaker, she was a devoted wife and a loving mother to her sons. She was admired for her sharp wit and her directness; and her significant contributions to school, church and community, coupled with a strong sense of loyalty and fairness, endeared her to all who knew her. In 1973, she returned to work with the VNS. She became a respected grievance representative for her fellow nurses, and served as a member of the executive committee of their Union in the UFT. These were roles she relished, both for the pursuit of causes she judged to be just, and to express more fully the camaraderie she felt with her colleagues. After retirement, she resumed all those activities which her declining health allowed. She was a prodigious reader, a prolific writer and a devoted gardener. She was also a talented cook who was wellknown for the Stollen and an endless variety of cookies she baked and distributed every Christmas. She was greatly loved, and will be held fast in memory by her many friends & her extended family; by Sidney, her husband of 52 years; by her sons, Michael (Reina), Andrew (Elizabeth), Robert and Christopher (Dione); and by her grandchildren, Laura, Amy, Julie, Lilly and Meredith.

His forays into social history, including the rise of the populist Fleet Street ""New Journalism,"" are never less than riveting. Looming over Hattersley's account is the shadow of Queen Victoria's insolent grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm, whose fecklessness triggered the Big Bang of August 1914, which toppled the Russian and Austro-Hungarian dynasties, not to mention his own.

But the term seems to fit ""LET ME HOLD YOU,"" a collaboration between the singer OMARION and the rapper BOW WOW, formerly known as Lil' Bow Wow. (After a few years, the adjective seemed to refer less to his age than to his stature; perhaps that's why it was retired.) The song sneaked up the pop charts and stuck around near the top; in a less competitive season -- one without MARIAH CAREY, say -- it could have been a candidate for song of the summer. As it is, it's just another delectable also-ran. Bow Wow delivers shockingly polite pick-up lines, rapping, ""When you cry, I wanna feel your pain/ No secrets, no games."" Even better is the lithe chorus from Omarion, a former member of the black boy-band B2K, who began a solo career with a CD called ""O"" (Sony/BMG).",2005-08-21T05:00:00+0000

Google her name and you'll find thousands of entries, but most of them will steer you away from her and directly to her work -- as a theater critic and as one of the country's most respected reviewers of mystery and crime fiction. She lectures frequently and doesn't actually swear off interviews, but when we recently asked her to talk about herself, her first reaction was typical: ""Couldn't I wriggle out of this?"" Stasio is smart, funny and, even after 17 years of writing the Book Review's crime column, ""kind of passionate"" about what she does. ""I've always been analytical,"" she says. ""I loved algebra in school."" So it's natural that she's less interested in writing ""thumbs up, thumbs down"" reviews than in figuring out why a book works -- or doesn't. She started out as a fan of classical puzzle mysteries, then fell for hard-boiled writers like Chandler and Hammett. These days, she's a particular champion of small-press mysteries, which are often foreign imports or reprints of classic novels from earlier eras. The mystery field continues to unfold new riches: ""There are so many moving parts, so many subgenres and categories, with new ones turning up all the time."" In a special essay this week, she turns her attention to one of the newest -- what's come to be known as the chick-lit mystery.",2005-08-21T05:00:00+0000

Their jeremiad against the income tax and the I.R.S. knocks off David McCullough's ""1776,"" which spent 10 weeks in the top spot. Boortz and Linder's plan is to nix the current income tax system (and the filing of tax returns) and install in its place a 23 percent retail sales tax on new goods and services. It's a big idea, and a pretty small book. (""Yes, we know,"" the authors write in their preface. ""This book seems rather short. It's not 300 pages long. Well, that's exactly as it should be. So take it to the cash register and buy it anyway."") When Boortz and Linder appeared on Neil Cavuto's Fox News program, Cavuto didn't think their tax plan had much of a chance in the real world: ""You work,"" he said to Linder, ""in a body that I don't think will do diddly on it."" By the end, though, Cavuto and the authors were trading jokes about who was richer, and whom the proposed tax plan would hurt most. ""It's going to nail you, Neil,"" Boortz said to Cavuto.

The narrator, John, is joined in Lisbon by his dead mother, who warns that ""the dead don't stay where they are buried."" As they wander the city, Berger, who is also an art critic, shows off his keen eye: the city's tiles, he writes, ""draw attention to the visible"" even while they ""insist upon the fact that they are covering something up."" But once John leaves Lisbon for Geneva, Krakow and other cities and other ghosts, Berger the critic gives way to Berger the sentimentalist, and the narrative descends into tedium. As he hangs out with former lovers, a teacher, a sculptor friend and even Rosa Luxemburg, it becomes impossible to tell who's alive and who's dead or why they've returned, and more difficult to care.

The announcement that Dana Reeve, the widow of Christopher Reeve, has the disease -- coming just two days after Peter Jennings died from it -- has many Americans wondering if they should get tested with a CT scan.

The verdict may reflect the fact that Merck was facing an extremely capable lawyer, while its own lawyers committed blunders that alienated the jury.

ABC broadcast repeats of ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" (5.37 million viewers, then 7.56 million), a new episode of the reality-variety show ""My Kind of Town"" (5.79 million) and a ""Desperate Housewives"" rerun (5.68 million). But CBS had the most-watched program of the night: its repeat of ""60 Minutes"" drew 10.18 million viewers. The second part of CBS's mini-series ""Living With the Dead"" drew 7.68 million viewers from 9 to 11 p.m., but was in fourth place among the 18-to-49-year-olds. The mini-series, originally broadcast in 2002, is based on the life and work of the medium James Van Praagh, played by Ted Danson. Mr. Van Praagh's otherworldly profession is also the basis of one of CBS's fall series, ""Ghost Whisperer,"" but in that series the character based on him is played by a woman, Jennifer Love Hewitt, above.

ABC's primetime lineup was a broadcast of a ""Monday Night Football"" preseason game, in which the Dallas Cowboys beat the Seattle Seahawks: over three hours, the game placed second to CBS in households and viewers. For the week that ended on Sunday, CBS was No. 1 for the 12th week in a row: meaning, the network has won every week of the summer season. CBS was also first in the 18-to-49 demographic. Its indomitable charge was led by the week's top two programs, ""Without a Trace"" and ""CSI."" KATE AURTHUR",2005-08-24T05:00:00+0000

Healdsburg was a farming community and in many ways still is, though prunes, which dominated the fruit crop until the 1970's, have now been supplanted by grapes. In fact, it is just a short drive from the center of town to three Sonoma County wine locales, the Alexander Valley, the Dry Creek Valley and the Russian River Valley, that are filled with wineries but lack the weekend crowds of neighboring Napa. Mid-September marks the start of crush, the grape harvest, so fall visitors will see bustling vineyards and undoubtedly smell fermenting grape juice. But these days Healdsburg is about more than wine. Over the last few years, new shops and high-end boutique hotels have made it a destination for all things culinary.",2005-08-26T04:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: Aug. 26 -- Sept. 1; 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS',"When the seven actors in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" take their final curtain call on Sunday afternoon, Broadway will be losing a big bright light. David Mamet's hilariously obscene autopsy on business, American style, has one of the best ensemble performances you can find anywhere (the play won the Tony Award for best revival this year). As these furious, trapped real estate salesmen compete to sell worthless land to suckers, the exhilaration on the part of the audience becomes palpable. The characters' desperation, scarily evident behind the comic turns in Joe Mantello's knife-sharp production, seems so familiar. This must be America, right? The three opening arias of what is really a tragic farce begin with Alan Alda's Shelly Levene literally pleading for his life before the impassive office manager (Frederick Weller), who is privy to a list of potential buyers the salesmen aim to delude. Mr. Alda is all supplicating hands and bared teeth as he tries to conceal his anxiety behind a wall of jokes and a skull's grin. He and Mr. Weller are followed by Gordon Clapp, as an insidious spider who ensnares Jeffrey Tambor in a plot to steal the list. As the shocked prey, Mr. Tambor is compulsively watchable and soon neatly tied in. The crescendo of the first act is a bitingly funny, surreal sermon by Liev Schreiber (Tony Award No. 2), who gets into the skin of the snakelike supersalesman Richard Roma. The forlorn patsy is Tom Wopat, his studly Broadway musical past nowhere evident here as Roma hypnotizes him in a hell-red parody of a Chinese restaurant designed by Santo Loquasto and filled with (symbolically?) empty fish tanks. Because of these shrewd introductions by the playwright -- who dedicated the 1983 ""Glengarry"" to Harold Pinter -- the audience is primed for the knockout second act set in the real estate office, which Mr. Loquasto has transformed into a foreboding sea of gunmetal desks. A cop, Jordan Lage, is interviewing each salesman behind a closed door. It's like a mad tennis match, with the dialogue volleying among seven players, some leaving and then re-entering the game. As the cast lobs its lines, watch Mr. Lage and Mr. Schreiber joust for power; Mr. Clapp turn on Mr. Schreiber; Mr. Alda instantly impersonate a satisfied buyer as the quaking Mr. Wopat tries to wriggle out of a contract. In this darkness, Ricky Roma speaks. ""I swear it's not a world of men,"" he says, ""there's no adventure to it."" But there is great theatrical adventure in this ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" and it's not to be missed. (From left, above, Mr. Tambor, Mr. Lage, Mr. Wopat, Mr. Alda, Mr. Weller, Mr. Schreiber and Mr. Clapp. Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.)

Along the way, the show zigzags all over the map, including a fine Elizabeth Taylor portrait by Andy Warhol; a collage about beauty and commerce by the feminist Martha Rosler; poignant faux film stills by Cindy Sherman; and a large photograph of a naked young woman on a motorcycle appropriated from a biker magazine by Richard Prince.

us,The Listings: Aug. 26 -- Sept. 1; CHARLIE PARKER JAZZ FESTIVAL,"The death of Charlie Parker, above, a half-century ago closed the book on an outsized jazz talent. But in the months and years that followed, new footnotes kept cropping up, as a generation of musicians strove to emulate both his dazzling saxophone heroics and his gargantuan narcotic habit. Fifty years of hindsight have reaffirmed the singularity of Parker's genius; this summer, Uptown Records released a newly discovered live recording, ""Town Hall, New York City, June 22, 1945,"" that added luster to an already luminous discography. Musicians have long been aware of the futility of the task; today's jazz mainstream is bebop-tinged but rarely Parker-shaped, so that even the 13th annual Charlie Parker Jazz Festival shows no trace of simulacra. The lineup tomorrow at Marcus Garvey Park includes two alto saxophonists who have each absorbed Parker's style into his own: Bobby Watson, a commanding soloist schooled in hard bop; and Soweto Kinch, a bracing young player who also draws on myriad contemporary sources. The concert Sunday in the East Village features an excellent post-bop piano trio fronted by Geri Allen; a probing quartet led by the powerhouse drummer Cindy Blackman; and a group led by the pianist John Hicks and featuring the tenor saxophonist David (Fathead) Newman, who studied with Parker's mentor but mainly eschews bebop for rhythm and blues. Both concerts will feature Odean Pope's Saxophone Choir, an audacious assemblage of nine saxophones plus a rhythm section. The group's aesthetic connection to Parker is circuitous but deeply inscribed.

The system appears to be appealing to the audience, as a two-hour episode of ""Dance"" put Fox in first place among total viewers and 18-to-49-year-olds, as well as in a tie for first in households with NBC. The second hour of ""Dance"" outpaced its first in Nielsen's estimates: 7.07 million viewers watched the 8 p.m. hour, but 8.71 million tuned in at 9 p.m., bringing up its average. NBC had the most-watched program of the night, however: the 10 p.m. ""Law & Order"" repeat (9.17 million). Over its run, the ratings for ABC's ""Brat Camp"" have decreased significantly since its premiere in mid-July. Wednesday's finale drew 6.27 million viewers, 4 million fewer than the debut drew.

Healdsburg was a farming community and in many ways still is, though prunes, which dominated the fruit crop until the 1970's, have now been supplanted by grapes. In fact, it is just a short drive from the center of town to three Sonoma County wine locales, the Alexander Valley, the Dry Creek Valley and the Russian River Valley, that are filled with wineries but lack the weekend crowds of neighboring Napa. Mid-September marks the start of crush, the grape harvest, so fall visitors will see bustling vineyards and undoubtedly smell fermenting grape juice. But these days Healdsburg is about more than wine. Over the last few years, new shops and high-end boutique hotels have made it a destination for all things culinary.

Skeptics should head to the Howl! Festival on Sunday, when a range of performers, including the Butoh Rockettes, above, will bring Japan's expressionistic post-World War II dance form to the Manhattan streets. Just don't expect strict adherence to tradition. The artist Matthew Flower and the dancer and choreographer Shizu Homma will present a Butoh fashion show, which Ms. Homma describes as ""not quite fashion show and not quite Butoh."" Bo Akiko Nishijima will perform a ""Butoh-cat piece that speculates on the future."" And the Butoh Rockettes will present satirical chorus work, which nonetheless maintains ties to the form's traditional existential quality. The troupe's director, Celeste Hastings, has studied with a host of Butoh masters and will dance the more traditional ""In Runes,"" a layered, political solo inspired by her film of the same title, which ruminates on the earth. Another soloist, Catherine Hourihan, will perform her Butoh-influenced ""Neverness,"" incorporating images projected onto her body and trying to explore the world's interconnectedness. These solos will kick off the ""Dance of Darkness,"" which the curators Bradley Eros and M.M. Serra describe as a showing of Artaud- and Butoh-inspired films. The evening is part of Howl!'s Avant-Garde(n), a series of public programs in East Village community gardens. ""The avant-garde is not finished,"" said Paul Bartlett, one of the event's producers.

The automaker, which expects its health care costs to total nearly $6 billion this year, has been in talks with the U.A.W. since April to try to pare some of the union medical benefits that Mr. Wagoner blames for hurting its ability to compete with Asian rivals. The union has also told G.M. that it wants the carmaker to take back as many as 7,000 workers from the Delphi Corporation as part of three-way talks aimed at helping Delphi improve its financial situation. Delphi, which was spun off by G.M. in 1999, employs about 24,000 U.A.W. members. A G.M. spokesman, Stefan Weinmann, said he was unable to comment on whether compensation for Mr. Wagoner and other executives had been discussed in G.M.'s negotiations with the U.A.W.

The first to make an impact is ""The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell: An Accidental Soldier's Account of the War in Iraq,"" by John Crawford, which enters the hardcover nonfiction list this week at No. 12. Crawford, who ended up in Iraq after joining the Florida National Guard to help pay his college tuition, turns out to be a bracing writer. (""My M-249 squad automatic weapon fired 850 rounds a minute, and if that didn't stop whatever was after me, then I had a problem that nothing would solve."") Crawford thinks the war in Iraq is a mistake. But as he put it, memorably, to Terry Gross recently on National Public Radio, he believes it's too late to stop now: ""I liken it to getting in a bar fight. Occasionally, you know, you get drunk and you get in a fight because you think some guy's eyeballing you in the bar. And you wake up in the morning, and you say, 'Wow, that guy didn't deserve that at all.' But the morning is the time for regret.

""I live in a large Victorian house on Westminster Road and a year ago I was standing on the porch with a friend and associate, Christine Siracusa, when we decided to do 'To Kill a Mockingbird,""' said Claire Beckman, 44, the producing artistic director of Brave New World, a Brooklyn-based company in its second season. ""My fear about the play was that it is so much of an outdoor story, that involves trees, porches, porch swings, tree swings and kids running around. I couldn't imagine doing it inside.""",2005-08-28T05:00:00+0000

Marianne Moore even once spent a month helping Ford come up with names for the car that was eventually christened the Edsel. (Moore's suggestions included ""The Intelligent Whale,"" so you can't say the company didn't get its money's worth.) Yet while poets have excelled at a number of sidelines, they've done some of their sharpest work in a genre that's often overlooked: the personal letter. Not all great poets are great letter writers, of course, but the correspondence of Pope, Keats, Rilke and many others is more than simply an interesting supplement to the poetic canon; without these letters, poetry as we know it wouldn't exist.",2005-08-28T05:00:00+0000

The watch was a prototype in the office of Herms's chairman, Jean-Louis Dumas. He was telling me about Martin Margiela, whom he had hired to design the Herms women's collection and who had hit upon the idea of making a very long leather watch strap that curled twice around the wrist. It reminded me of the watches on wide leather wristbands that I'd worn in my teens in the north of England during the early 1970's, when my bedroom was wallpapered with Roxy Music posters. It also evoked the raw elegance that I loved in Margiela's clothes. As soon as the watch went on sale, I dashed into Herms. The women's style looked clunky on my skinny arm, but the men's was perfect -- so big that the watch face covered the entire top of my wrist. Much as I loved it, the Cape Cod didn't seem like the most practical purchase. My wrist felt smothered by its bulk, and the double strap was so conspicuous that I thought I'd soon be bored by it. I've since worn the Cape Cod every day. The heft feels so comforting that other watches appear alarmingly light, and only the Cape Cod reminds me of Bryan Ferry.

The decision, by Judge Jed S. Rakoff in Federal District Court in Manhattan, came in a lawsuit filed April 19 by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act. In response, the Pentagon released transcripts of tribunals held at Guantnamo in late 2004 to determine whether all the detainees were correctly classified as enemy combatants, as military officials maintained. The Pentagon blacked out the prisoners' names, arguing that publishing them would violate their privacy and could expose them and their families to reprisals.

Their formal induction will take place in New York on Nov. 15, during the CBS telecast of the association's awards show from Madison Square Garden. Unlike pop or rock groups, bands rarely achieve superstar status in modern country music, but Alabama (with Randy Owen, Teddy Gentry, Jeff Cook and Mark Herndon) was a notable exception. In the 1980's and 90's, the band amassed 42 No. 1 country singles. Mr. Campbell, a native of tiny Delight, Ark., was a recording, movie and television star in his late-1960's heyday. Mr. Bailey, who died in 1982, never grew beyond 4-foot-10 because of polio, but he was both a giant and a tragic figure in country music; the reasons for his departure from the Opry in the early 1940's have long been shrouded in controversy.

The rate of growth was the lowest since the first half of 2002. Higher oil costs and state controls on fuel prices to curb inflation are slashing margins at Chinese refiners and making some gasoline retailers limit sales, prompting shortages. ""The refiners are being squeezed,"" Philip Niem, Asian investment strategist at Barclays Bank in Hong Kong, said. ""Crude oil prices are increasing so rapidly, it's hard for the Chinese government to keep up."" Snopec's refining business had an operating loss of 1.3 billion yuan, swinging from a profit of 4.3 billion yuan a year earlier. The profit from processing each barrel of oil fell to $2.32, from $4.07. Profit from oil exploration and production jumped 69 percent, to 17.8 billion yuan.",2005-08-30T05:00:00+0000

The latest monthly decline in new home sales follows a 2 percent fall in June and a 4.6 percent drop in May. Australia's housing market has been coming off the boil in the last year as heated markets led by Sydney pushed up prices and reduced home affordability. The housing association's chief economist, Simon Tennent, said the decline in new home sales was still in line with an orderly slowdown that is creating pent-up demand for housing in Australia. But the July survey also showed that homebuying in some regions of Australia had all but stalled, Mr. Tennent said. In the major states of New South Wales and Victoria, new home sales fell 12.3 percent and 5 percent respectively, partly because of high land costs. These declines were partly offset by a 7.5 percent rise in Queensland, a 17.4 percent increase in South Australia and a 10.5 percent rise in Western Australia.",2005-08-30T05:00:00+0000

The businessman, Owen Larman, who remains at large, was described by the authorities as the leader of a fraud ring that operated for six years. Prosecutors said Mr. Larman bought the buildings, often shells without plumbing, heating or interior walls, then convinced acquaintances to buy the properties or act as straw buyers in false transactions at inflated prices. He paid the buyers, then used high appraisal reports and photos of other buildings to resell them, prosecutors said. No charges were filed against the buyers, prosecutors said, because some were unwitting and those who seemed to understand the fraud had already been punished with ruined credit ratings.

The aide, Ntfonjeni Dlamini, told Agence France-Presse that he was shocked to find Princess S'khanyiso Dlamini ""amongst the people"" on the eve of Swaziland's reed dance, in which tens of thousands of bare-breasted maidens dance before the king in a stadium. Swazi newspapers claimed that other girls at the party were also beaten, including the reigning Miss Swaziland beauty queen. Separately, a top Swazi official told the German news agency DPA that his country's citizens were offended by international ridicule of the reed dance and other Swazi customs. King Mswati, 37, has been frequently criticized for taking a teenage girl as his ninth wife in violation of his own ban on sex -- he paid a fine of one cow as punishment -- and for other excesses, like his recent purchase of a half million-dollar luxury sedan, in a nation where a quarter of the population depends on foreign donations for food.
