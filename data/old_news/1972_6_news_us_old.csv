us,A Suspense Melodrama of 'Fright':British Import Proves a Tale of Cruelties Ian Bannen Has Part of Homicidal Maniac,"Peter Collinson's ""Fright"" is a describably dreadful English suspense melodrama, set in an old but not quite empty mansion, about a homicidal maniac, who sneaks in, and the terrorized babysitter who can't sneak out.The arbitrary cruelties in the screenplay by Tudor Gates, one of the eight writers who collaborated on ""Barbarella,"" include a rape, a baby held hostage with a piece of broken glass at its throat, some slashings and the splitting of a skull, as well as lots of cross-cutting between scenes in the house and scenes of the would-be rescuers having the kind of car trouble that only a desperate writer would borrow from a Keystone comedy.Collinson, who has made some bad movies in his short career (""The Penthouse"" and ""The Italian Job,"" among others), bottoms himself with the dreary affectations in ""Fright."" Leaky faucets sound like footsteps, TV sets suddenly scream in the night, faces are seen reflected on pendulums, fractured through frosted windows, and so on. It's like being drunk without joy. Most of the movie seems to have been photographed with the camera about three feet, nine inches off the floor, a technique sometimes employed to create the feeling of menace instead of, as here, the suspicion that everything is being audited by a midget.Susan George plays the baby-sitter, Ian Bannen the maniac and Honor Blackman the baby's mother. Though good actors, they're hopeless in these frankly fake, sadomasochist circumstances. Perhaps because the film has been rated PG (parental guidance suggested), the camera usually looks away just before the blood begins to spurt. I suspect that's the sort of discretion that only the mother of a film censor can fully appreciate.",1972-06-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Final Comedown' Arrives:Story of a Black Revolt Is at the Victoria Leader's Role Is Taken by Billy Dee Williams,"Normally you should allow at least two years between the time something happensan assassination, a trend, a major shift in the national consciousnessand the time you begin seeing movies about it. That leaves one year for the thing, whatever it is, to penetrate the collective consciousness of the movie industry (a phenomenon known as cultural lag), and another year for production, post-production, distribution and everything else it takes to bring the never-before-revealed to your silver screen.Thus, youth-rebellion films, the spirit of '67-'68, appeared with some regularity in 1969-70. But black-rebellion films, dealing with an altogether scarier and less popular subject, have been more erratic in coming, and they have come mostly under the protection of a certain academicismthe nostalgic 1930's dramaturgy of Jules Dassin's ""Up Tight,"" or the cinematic pyrotechnics of Melvin van Peebles's ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasss Song.""Oscar Williams's ""The Final Comedown,"" which opened yesterday at the Victoria and Apollo theaters, has less exalted models, but it seems as slavishly rooted to convention as any of its predecessors. Essentially it is the story of how a gentle, handsome young black man (Billy Dee Williams) is radicalized by social injustice and finally drivenby a process never quite made clearto lead a kind of violent revolt in which young people all over share.The revolt is a pretty bloody affair, in fact, a shootout in which everybody loses, and black heroes and white cops fall like files. Its sources lie very much in the tradition of the Western, especially the Italian Western, and it is the climax to a plot full of personal relations that never avoid the clichs of urban soap opera.If it had become, from these elements, a good genre film, ""The Final Comedown"" could have represented an interesting adaption. But it is a bad genre filmwholly exploitative of both its dramatic forms and its social situation.It is of course a very angry movie, in the sense that everybody is almost always very angry. But it takes time out for some young-love exploitation, and a brief glamour tour of soul food and black fashions, and even a glimpse at the problem of air pollution and the plight of the American Indianand I think that any movie with so many concerns must have too little really on its mind.Its technique is slick, but ineffective. I think I might like virtually al the cast under different circumstances. But for a film in which nobody converses, and people even in their most private moments, only make speeches at one, another, it seems useless to discuss performance.",1972-06-01T05:00:00+0000

We have a beautiful country estate, where a middle-aged financier becomes obsessed with a houseguest, a wide-eyed Lolita type. Watching, in agony, is the man's older daughter, with an acute father complex.Watching all three, with a wise sneer, is a young farmer, biding his time.Up to about midpoint, it works pretty well, the British way  clipped dialogue, restrained expressions over coffee and tea and a civilized atmosphere. The music is pretty and soothing, likewise the rustic color photography, taking a few peaks into mod London.The set-up is serenely arranged by the director, John Mackenzie. The acting of Clifford Evans, Felicity Gibson, Jennifer Hilary and Peter Egan is quite good. Trouble is, once the friction surfaces, the film goes nowhere, leaving the cast to mill around and stare at one another in disillusion, lust or both. That civilized facade becomes a thin cover-up for some infantile behavior.It's too bad someone like Franoise Sagan, of the sardonic swizzle-stick, or Iris Murdoch, with her grotesque irony, didn't stir up a more interesting sexual brew.

us,The Screen: Suggested by Thurber:'War Between Men and Women' at Music Hall Lemmon Has Role of a Man Going Blind,"Watching ""The War Between Men and Women"" is like being in a haunted house in broad daylight. The movie is described as having been ""suggested by the writings and drawings of James Thurber and including 'The Last Flower'"" (a construction that I'm sure would have amused the late humorist and grammarian for at least 14 minutes).However sunny it looks, it is really eerie, something all wrong and out of joint, a comedy about a man going blind, and about a child with a traumatic stammer. It's the sort of movie in which Dr. Joyce Brothers, apparently playing herself at a literary tea, is heard saying ""There's nothing wrong with paranoia if you don't take it seriously.""What, you might wonder, Is up? Who's making fun of who? These are legitimate questions if you've ever had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Brothers make Sweeping Statements about masturbation on N.B.C. Radio.Confusion, as they say, reigns (or is it rains?) in ""The War Between Men and Women,"" which pretends to be about Thurber, but isn't (it's about a fictional character named Peter Wilson who writes Thurber's books and draws Thurber's cartoons), and which utilizes Thurber's work but whose comic pole is located somewhere south of ""Make Room for Daddy.""Gag: At a cocktail party Peter Wilson (Jack Lemmon) drops his glasses into a pitcher of martinis. Since he can't see to fish them out, he must drink the contents of the pitcher. Everyone else stands around seemingly shocked.Gag: Peter and Terry (Barbara Harris) are out walking a pregnant dog who begins to give birth in the middle of the street as the couple hover over her. Peter, to policeman: ""She's in labor."" Policeman: ""Well, don't let her stay there. Drag her over to the gutter and take the dog with you.""Only a cockeyed sense of fair play prompts the recollection of these gags in detail. Some people may find them funny. Others, I assume, will grieve, remembering the precise, no-nonsense world evoked through Thurber's prose, as in his praise of the semiblindness that allowed him to see ""a gay old lady with a gray parasol walk through the side of a truck."" Practically unknown in Thurber's world are cheap wisecrackers and even, cheaper sentimentalists. It is, instead, inhabited by sweet wives who drive husbands mad by finishing their sentences, by grandmothers who fear that electricity is dripping all over the house from empty sockets, and by a cat who, at 35, spends all her time in bed, staring.In ""The War Between Men and Women,"" Melville Shavelson, the director, and Danny Arnold, who collaborated on the screenplay with Shavelson, complete the job of ravaging Thurber country begun with their short-lived television series, ""My World and Welcome to It,"" which was also about a fictional cartoonist, though he wasn't going blind.Shavelson and Arnold have helped themselves to some details of Thurber's life, as well as to his works, to make a comedy that alternates between being smart-alecky and as sweet as your average Doris Day Show. They've mixed up Thurber's thoughtful appraisals of women, children and dogs with the misogyny and sulky skepticism of someone like W. C. Fields. What's worse, since much of the story has to do with Wilson-Thurber's hiding his blindness from his wife, they've given him the kind of idiotically noble character that won't even wash anymore in soap opera.Lemmon is not terribly funny, but he is vigorously myopic and looks ageless, neither young nor old, though a bit beat, as Wilson-Thurber. Jason Robards does a long walk-on as Miss Harris's first husband, the father of the brood of children Lemmon inherits by marriage, a man whose undependability towards his family seems to inspire the creation of Thurber's ""The Last Flower,"" which I always thought was about war.Although she hasn't the unbaked-cookie shape to be completely convincing as a Thurber woman, Miss Harris is so lovely and intelligent that I believed her completely. I also believed some other small moments in the film, like the little boy who, when asked what he is afraid of, answers desolately: ""Everything."" The children are, otherwise, movie monsters. Robert Dranko is credited with having designed the animation for several sequences in which the Thurber people come to cartoon life. They are so fine they make everything else seem just that much worse  clumsy and literal.",1972-06-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Top of the Heap' Examines Black Cop With Problems,"""Top of the Heap,"" which opened yesterday at the Forum Theater, was written, produced and directed by Christopher St. John, a young black actor who had a feature role in ""Shaft,"" and who now stars himself as a Washington cop with problems.Conditions in general must present any black cop with problems enough, but St. John's cop also makes up his ownwith an attitude of un-relaxed rage for his world and, for himself, a hyperactive fantasy mechanism that keeps going off at the drop of a symbol (usually phallic) and that transports him into dreams of public grandeur or private sexual bliss.There are, of course, explanations for both the aggressive anger and the eager retreat, and everybody around the cop works very hard to apply them. They include a mother's death, the decision not to attend her funeral, no money, no promotion to sergeant, a teen-age daughter starting on dope, a demanding wife, a more demanding mistress, and the assorted friends and enemies who see black first, policeman second, and man hardly at all.But the cop's reactions, and the intensity of his unreal emotional life, are still in excessof anything that provokes them or anyone who misguidedly tries to lay them to rest. And it is only because of this excess that ""Top of the Heap"" occasionally manages to develop a measure of genuine interest as a movie, to break out of the already deadly stereotypes of black-white confrontation film, to become ironic, sometimes fantastic, and even comic.I suspect that Christopher St. John may some day make and act in very good funny movies. The general drift of this one, unfortunately, is toward pathetic tragedy.At the times when he passes into another level of consciousness the cop sees himself as a heroic astronaut (except when he sees himself as a tropical lover) occupying spaces that are suspiciously white-on-white, annexing the moon and immediately littering it with food wrappers, conducting his own one-man welcome celebration.Not all this material is equally successful. Much of it isn't any good at all. But some of it is quite intricately good. And it suggests an actor (writer, producer and director) who has ideas, and sufficient command over his own very powerful presence to work those ideas into the kinds of metaphors that are for film among the basic signs of life.",1972-06-03T05:00:00+0000

So too is the experience shared by Bri and Sheila in ""A Day in the Death of Joe Egg,"" Peter Medak's English film adapted by Peter Nichols from his play which ran on Broadway four years ago.Bri (Alan Bates), short for Brian, is a teacher in a boys school in Bristol, a man who embraces failure and loss with humor that is the wit's end of despair. His wife, Sheila (Janet Suzman), is the sort of woman who, as she says, tries to make life work, as if it were a troublesome washing machine that won't go unless it's at a tilt. Largely because of Sheila, their house is stuffed with second-order lifegoldfish, birds, plants, two cats named Sidney and Beatrice Webb, one of whom, Beatrice, acts as host to a colony of errant fleas.More importantly, Bri and Sheila are the parents of a 10-year-old daughter, Joe, variously referred to as ""a living parsnip,"" ""a wegetable,"" ""no trouble at all,"" ""crackpot"" and ""my blossom.""Joe is a spastic whose brain is so damaged that she is incompletely helpless, a lump of life whose eyes float in their sockets like the twin bubbles in a carpenter's level. She is unable to talk or move, or do anything except lay about, slumped over in a wheelchair.""A Day in the Death of Joe Egg,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is a difficult movie to describe properly. It is beautifully acted, funny, moving, but infinitely depressing.The play was presented as a kind of domestic, one-set, cabaret theater, with a jazz combo at the side of the stage to accompany Bri and Sheila in their direct confidences to the audience, in their song-and-dance turns, and in their burlesqued reminiscences of life with Joe, with the idiot doctors who attended her, and with one C of E vicar, imitated by Bri, who tried to sell them a laying-on-of-hands ceremony.Although Mr. Nichols has not changed the play's text much except to add several subsidiary characters and scenes that take the film outside the house into Bristol and to the seashores, ""A Day in the Death of Joe Egg"" is now completely naturalistic.The only distance left in it is anything but Brechtian. lt is the distance that Bri and Sheila take as they stand apart from themselves, apart from their wounded egos, as they play little games in which they give Joe the imaginary identity of a bright, fractious child, and through Joe, alternately rail at and caress each other.One immediate and major effect of this naturalism is to transform the film into a love story, but one that doesn't quite fit the shape of the plot that Mr. Nichols has devised, which is that of the dissolution of a marriage.I suspect that ""Joe Egg"" has always been first and foremost a love story, though it was difficult to recognize on stage through the cabaret turns that gave it a kind of epic form. Remove those vauderville bits and you have the profoundly felt experience that Mr. Nicholas has taken from his own life but changed in significant ways.The first child of the playwright and his wife was a spastic daughter, described by Mr. Nichols when interviewed here tour years ago as ""a meaningless accident.""""We used to make up fantasies about the child, but we are not the parents in the play,"" he said. ""We put our child in a home, which, of course, is what the parents in the play should have done."" Instead of despairing, the Nicholses had two more children, both normal.In projecting his story into fiction, Mr. Nichols succeeds in making us believe in the love between the parents so completely that it's impossible to believe that their life together is collapsing, as the play wants us to, which may be why the film seems more depressing than it need be.""A Day in the Death of Joe Egg"" is worrisome indeed, difficult to recommend, since it isn't grand enough to go much beyond its special experience, but easy to admire in isolated instancesBates's rages at God (""a manic-depressive rugby footballer""), his imitation of the swinging churchman (met on a banthe-bomb march) singing ""Animal Crackers in My Soup,"" Miss Suzman's beautiful soliloquy about the day Joe knocked down some toy blocks, all of the supporting performances, especially Joan Hickson's as Bri's purposefully dim, self-centered mother, a woman who can be counted upon to say of sleep: ""Two hours before midnight are worth two after, I always say.""",1972-06-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'The Green Wall',"Armando Robles Godoy's ""The Green Wall"" is probably the first, truly native Peruvian feature most of us have ever seen, since only three or four Peruvian features have been made in the last 25 years, none of which, to the best of my knowledge, have been shown in New York, at lease outside Spanish language theaters.It is a sincere, solemn movie, technically first-rate and terribly well-meaning, about a young Lima salesman who, with his wife and baby son, abandons city life to hack a farm out of the jungle. Robles Godoy, who himself did just that for eight years, mixes a liberal social conscience with a mystical appreciation for rugged individualism and the beauties of nature, which usually evoke a Bach cantata on the soundtrack. On the other hand, the horrors of city lifeslums, flat tires, telephones that don't work, cripples, government bureaucracy  evoke modern jazz, which says a lot less about flat tires and whatnot than I suspect the director thinks it does.Julio Aleman, a leading Mexican actor, and Sandra Riva, a nonprofessional Peruvian actress, are quite fine as the reasonably courageous, modern pioneers. That their love for each other, their child and their land is not more deeply felt is the result of the kind of overly imaginative directorial approach that, on one occasion, puts the audience into the body of a snake in the grass. Robles Godoy substitutes ornamentation (eccentric camera angles, filters, freeze frames, soundtrack music) for a rigorous style that might have communicated some sense of what the movie is all about.Although ""The Green Wall"" comes to us via festivals in Chicago and Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia, where it was reportedly acclaimed, I found it dull, and maybe even a little less humanistic than it pretends.It could be that stories about people fleeing civilization don't appeal to me. Such gestures are romantic, but less important than trying to make civilization work, than the changes and accommodations that must be effected if somehow we are all to survive.",1972-06-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Pat Boone Plays Preacher-Hero in 'Cross and Switchblade',"A Baptist-owned feature movie like ""The Cross and the Switchblade"" prompts two questions as it shows how a street minister brings two New York City gangs to Christ. Is it convincing? And how hard does it hit? Answers: convincing and hard enough. I liked it.Don't expect blistering, savage realism, although the story is based on the work of the Rev. David Wilkerson, a veteran of local slums. Rather methodically, the picture moves to a predictable conclusion, as the persistent preacher-hero, played by Pat Boone, converts the two bloodied gangs with nothing more than a five-minute speech.""I really don't dig this scene at all,"" says the one holdout. Neither did this preacher's son, though I dug most of the rest.The earnestness of the project goes without saying. Nor is it the least bit amateurish technically. Don Murray (who once made an admirable Norman Vincent Peale in a pulpit movie), is co-author of the script, which has a pungent, savvy edge and some amusing dialogue. As director, Mr. Murray neatly conveys the harsh slum atmosphere with some sharp vignettes of drug addiction and the festering hatred between the two gangs. The color photography is excellent, and a brisk soundtrack of rock hymns does no harm at all.With persuasive simplicity, Mr. Boone is obviously saying what he feels throughout the film. Three of the youngsters can really actErik Estrada as a gang leader, pretty Jackie Gircux, who has an astonishing scene of drug-craving agony, and Jo-Ann Robinson, as an impish tomboy.

us,'Black Belly of the Tarantula' and 'Weekend Murders' Teamed,"Every few weeks there ought to be a film with a title like ""The Black Belly of the Tarantula"" just so you know imaginations are alive and kicking in movieland. It will help if film and title have no relation to each other. Or, if there is a relation, it should be strained, as in Paolo Cavara's ""The Black Belly of the Tarantula,"" which actually sports one hairy tarantula and several smooth bellies, but for the most part deals with the not so exotic killing of some beautiful young women in Rome.There is a plot, which makes very little sense and ultimately doesn't matter anyway, and rather too much visual style, and dubbing at the usual low level that often makes Italian action movies in English seem worse than they are. Mr. Cavara has an interesting sense of his city, which is cool, malevolent, almost deserted until the final frames. But his sense of drama is very weak, and everything good he can do with his camera seems to betray him as soon as an actor appears in front of it.On balance, however, the pleasures probably outweigh the pains, and, as long as you are not too much of an old prude about watching five and a half sadistic murders, you may find ""The Black Belly of the Tarantula,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, a mildly inoffensive diversion.But ""Weekend Murders,"" on the same bill, is wholly offensivewhether more for the spinelessness of its total submission to the zoom lens or for the effrontry of its 10-second quotation from the rabbit hunt in ""Rules of the Game,"" I find it difficult to decide.It is set in an English country house, and it has to do with who wants to eliminate whom among a group of ravenous relatives gathered together for the reading of a rich old man's will. Its elements are wholly conventionalgreat house and gardens, creepy cousins, creaking doors, bungling policeand it is clear that with all its ersatz eccentricity it means to invoke the favored aura of British mystery tales. But under Michele Lupo's heavy direction and with the glowering faces of a cast that includes Anna Moffo, Marisa Fabbri, Orchidea de Santis, and Quinto Parmaggiana (I mention the names for atmosphere only), it feels more like a mad closet drama about the violent takeover of some minor Italian dukedom.",1972-06-08T05:00:00+0000

Snug in his orange shag compartment, Hugh Hefner confidently surveyed his holdings and plumped down $280 for Marvin Gardens. His secretary, Bobbie Arnstein, rolled next, won second prize in a beauty contest and collected $10. Then it was my turn, and with monopolies coalescing all around me, I needed to deal. Hefner and his girl friend, Barbi Benton, sitting side by side on the facing banquette, had most of the attractive properties, but I was wary of dealing with either of them. Early in the game Barbi had lured me into a bad bargain, giving her the pale blue Oriental Vermont Connecticut monopoly on which she was already building a Levittown of little green houses. Then Hefner had persuaded me to take his Water Works (which along with my Electric Company would give me 10 times the roll of the dice if anybody ever landed on one, which they never did) in exchange for my Short Line Railroad (which along with the three other railroads he soon assembled gave him $200 every time somebody landed on one, which they always did). But now Hefner had Tennessee Avenue, which I needed to go with my New York and St. James. For five minutes we haggled over our chicken bones until finally he induced me to part with Virginia Avenue and $700. Only as the Big Black Bunny made its final approach to Chicago's O'Hare Field did I realize that I'd made my third mistake. Hefner's properties now sported not green row houses but phalanxes of big red hotels which marched the board like the coastline of Miami Beach. And I was rounding Go, heading right for them. As the plane came to a halt in front of its hangar, the issue was still in doubtthere were those who felt that Hefner's resources were overextended and his cash supply dangerously lowbut from the sunshine yellow of Ventnor Avenue to the deep purple of St. Charles Place, the Hefner Empire looked well entrenched.",1972-06-11T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Burglars',"For the first five minutes, about as long as the main title credits last, Henri Verneuil's ""The Burglars"" suggests a degree of technical competence, of simply knowing what to do next, that is rare enough in movies these days to perhaps make up for any lack of real qualityat least to the level of passable entertainment. But by the second five minutes, technical competence has become technical quirkness, and before a quarter of an hour has passed ""The Burglars"" reveals itself as yet another international caper filmthis time, set in Greecethat does nothing very well and almost everything in excess.The excesses start early, with the caper, which takes place at the beginning rather than at the end of the movie. It is a jewel theft and it involves opening a safe with the aid of a handy attach case that contains an X-ray vision TV camera, TV screen, tape recorder, three kinds of computers, miniature hand drill, metal-working vise, keys-made-while-you-wait machine such as you find in your local hardware store, and an instruction booklet. Such a machine might excite the envy of James Bond's armorer, or the delight of Rube Goldberg. But what it does for Henri Verneuil is to fill up a great deal of film time with a device rather than with an action, and that is exactly the method by which all of ""The Burglars"" has been made.The devices extend to an endless (and pointless) car chase, a warehouse full of grotesque toys, an automated harbor-side granary, a spicy nightclub, and a spicy meal in a Greek restaurant  take out 10 minutes to photograph and explain the local cuisine. There are also two murders. The only reason for the first murder is to justify the second, so I suppose they belong in the category of mechanics as well.Under Verneuil's direction, characters resolve themselves into a collection of emphatic mannerisms  the way a cigarette is lit, a nervous habit with the hands  which, together with the wooden English-speaking voices dubbed for most of the cast, tends to make people into things: cleverly automated, but things nevertheless.There is, of course, a plot. The plot pits a good crook against a bad cop and places a million dollars worth of emeralds in the balance. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays the crook, Omar Sharif plays the cop, and Dyan Cannon plays an enigmatic woman attached to both of them. I was especially taken with Miss Cannon's part, which seems not so much a role as a succession of brief guest appearances requiring mainly that she smile and walk and wear clothes.""The Burglars"" opened yesterday at the Loew's State I and Columbia I theaters.",1972-06-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Spy Melodrama:Johnson's 'Groundstar Conspiracy' Opens,"""The Groundstar Conspiracy,"" which opened rather modestly at neighborhood theaters Wednesday, is an espionage melodrama of such skill and intelligence that I should rank it not too far below Hitchcock's ""Frenzy"" among the few genuine pleasures in recent movies. It is equally rare in being an action film that appreciates the value of action, and of retreat from action; and if you tend (as I do) to yawn through most chases, terrors and moments of peril, it may come as a salutory surprise to learn again that there may after all be some point to dangerous excitement generated on the screen.The film opens with an explosion triggered by the theft of secret data from a space project somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. The thief survives  just barely  but his memory does not. And when he has been pieced back together by the doctors, and analyzed and shocked and tortured almost to death, he still does not know who he is or where he came from or who hired him to sack and steal from Project Groundstar.He has no more than a face and bodypretty much courtesy of the surgeonsa voice, unaccountably a few words of Greek, and the fleeting memory or dream of a young woman swimming in a sunlit ocean. But he also has an enemy, a man named Tuxan, security officer of the project; ruthless, humorless, wholly manipulative. And he has a friend, an unattached young woman put in his way by Tuxan, who suspects that she may be able to expose his prey.The story that develops among these three is very rich (and slightly incredible), and there is some point in not revealing it because in ""The Groundstar Conspiracy"" to be surprised by what comes next really does contribute to understanding and delight. In this respect, in its concern with memory and in the beautiful precision of its editing, it looks a little like a popular variation on the great remembered-time mysteries of Alain Resnais (""Muriel,"" ""La Guerre Est Fini,"" etc.) or Chris Marker's science-fiction short ""La Jete.""That is the stylistic universe of ""The Groundstar Conspiracy."" But its physical worldthe stark, gorgeous land and seascapes of the locations on Vancouver Island and the mainland of British Columbiaare like nothing else I have seen in the movies.As the steely, overbearing Texan, George Peppard is so efficiently hateful that it may be difficult to realize that he is also very good. Michael Sarrazin as the hapless alien, Welles, creates an unusually complete character, playing against the pathos and hysteria inherent in his role. And Christine Belford, very lovely and virtually new to movies, brings a kind of sensible grace to a figure that is necessarily part improbability and part dream.I have seen only two films directed by Lamont Johnson. One, ""The McKenzie Break,"" was perhaps the best under-publicized movie of 1970. In its own way, ""The Ground-star Conspiracy,"" equally underpublicized, seems just about as good. Mr. Johnson begins to look like one of the ornaments of the industry, and I think it more than time that he was discovered.",1972-06-23T05:00:00+0000

Mayer and Sam Goldwyn; of sessions with t h e European expatriate colony (Werfel, Schoenberg, Reinhardt); of the contemptuous way talent was treated (Scott Fitzgerald). Behrman had a juicy subject, it seemed to me, when he began to write about Hollywood's fatal attraction to psychoanalysis, but it was a vein he opened without delving further. Except for this backwater, the rest is vintage Behrman, a pure distillation, clear and light, delicious to savor and just as flavorsome taken an long draughts. read the book at one sitting because each chapter enticed me to read one more before shutting up shop.

us,Film: Thriller With Etruscan Touch,"""The Dead Are Alive"" may not be the best promotion for the annual Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. But the background of this horror-thriller is certainly fascinating. Furthermore, the plot has a group of neurotic worldlings commuting from festival rehearsals and an ornate Spoleto villa to the equally picturesque Etruscan ruins in the same area, where a growling, off-screen presence is hacking young couples to death.The catch to the picture is the rather slapdash direction of Armando Crispino. But there, is nothing wrong with the intriguing plot, concocted by the director and a colleague, once the suspense has hit its stride.This takes a while simply because the characters are generally such a nasty, repugnant lot, ranging from an alcoholic young archeologist, glumly played by Alex Cord, to a paranoid conductor, deftly done by John Marley. Who really cares if they are being bumped off right and left? And we do mean bumpedhacked and slashed to a recurrent, deafening tape of Verdi's Requiem. An Etruscan demon-god is supposed to be running loose after thousands of years, but don't you believe it.And don't be fooled by the minor characters and loose story strands that seem to be dangling like loose spaghetti strands. In the last reel, the plot gathers them up tightly for a gripping, perfectly logical dnouement. The story, with those intriguing Spoleto and Etruscan trimmings, would have made an excellent whodunit novel.Samantha Eggar, Nadja Tiller, Horst Frank and Carlo De Mejo are among the glaring or hissing cast. The director stages one good brake-screeching car chase through the cobbled Spoleto streets, and his climactic showdown in a dark church is fine.

Apparently because he feels himself a misfit, Danny befriends Ben, the leader of the pack of rats trained by the late Willard (who was murdered, none too soon, at the end of the first film).Danny seems to reason that fate has given them both raw deals, equating his own infirmity with Ben's rotten luck to have been born a rat.After Ben and his friends have been out ravaging the city, chewing up citizens for food and sport, running amok among the Cheerios in The Best of Everything supermarket, Ben can always return to Danny for the affection denied him elsewhere. Rats, says ""Ben,"" need love.The way in which you respond to ""Ben"" will depend on a number of variables, including how you feel about the possibility of Los Angeles shutting down, trick photography, dreadful acting by a dreadful cast, the decline and fall of Phil Karlson (""The Phenix City Story"") as a director and a screenplay that never has the courage to acknowledge its comic impulses.At least, I assume that there's a comic impulse at work somewhere when Danny sits down at the piano and, while idly tickling the ivories, composes a song for his friend.""Ben . . ."" sings Danny, looking off into the creative artist's middle distance, ""The two of us need look no more/Ben/We've both found what we've been looking for. . . .""It doesn't scan too well, but ""Ben"" idiotically aspires to a certain realism.

us,"Screen: Mud People Go Home Again:'Savages,' Film by Ivory, Views Civilization","The Mud People, a primitive jungle tribe with strict protocols and lax morals, stand ready for the ritual execution of last year's consort to their high priestess. Suddenly, arching over the trees, they see a high-flying croquet ballseemingly possessed of magic properties to lead them, so they cannot choose but follow. They approach the grounds of a deserted country estate, timidly enter the great house, discover stairs, paintings, toy trains, books, speech and clothes. By mid-afternoon they have become rich exurbanites, semi-civilized, much like the rest of usexcept that their style of dress is elegant 1930's, not all of them wear shoes and they worship a croquet ball.This is the situation of James Ivory's ""Savages,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet Theater and which treats the rise and fall of a civilization, no special civilization, in 24 hours. By evening the savages are exchanging gossip and manipulating great affairs of state and commerce over dinner; near midnight the sacrificial consort drowns himself in the swimming pool; later there are wild orgies in the basement; before dawn the people have rediscovered mud, and the first daylight finds them running back into the forest, following croquet balls they have hit with their own mallets.Nothing is changed, but much has been touched, for ""Savages"" is the work of a sensibilityor several sensibilitiesrefined almost to the point of invisibility. And each time you think how clever such a movie might be, the movie becomes that clever, or a bit cleverer. Two minor examples: the wonderful Art-Deco title cards to accompany the savages' early silencewith meaningless titles like ""Tribal elders are often distinguished by pebbles in their teeth, though such is not the case here""; and the untranslated German voice-over narration, perhaps to bring scholarly authority to the savages' superior powers of adaptation.But in less minor matters the film is not so satisfying. Both its idea of savagery and its idea of civilization are fairly precious conceits, and they lead in the long run to a piling of artifice upon artificea method of satire, but in this case, without a satirist's passion or even his point of view. Almost every moment in ""Savages"" seems like part of a superb movie that has not been quite put together. And I think that the lack has more to do with the strength or range of very basic concepts, rather than with technique or local insights, which are often marvelous.But whatever is missing from ""Savages,"" we are left with a good dealfrom the almost lyrical direction, to the always intelligent screen writing, to the lush and delicate photography. The cast is large, drawn mostly from the New York stage and, for what it has to do, very nearly faultless. I especially like Anne Francine's distinguished hostess, Thayer David's overbearing capitalist, Sam Waterston's and Lewis Stadlen's decent young men, Ultra Violet's indecent young woman, Paulita Sedgwick's sensitive girl, and Kathleen Widdoes in top hat and tails dancing a number called ""Stomping on a Spaniel.""",1972-06-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Dennis Reardon's 'Happiness Cage' Is Better Suited to Stage,"Dennis Reardon's play, ""The Happiness Cage,"" belongs on stage, not before a camera, with its moralistic concern, its theatrics and its stomach-turning plot all colliding uneasily and starkly magnified. Pulled in close as a movie, with the small cast now clumping around the rooms and corridors of huge Veterans Hospital in Frankfurt, it seems a brilliant contrivance but a contrivance nevertheless.With an expansive prelude and the huge, half-empty premises added, Mr. Reardon's work is still essentially the same as his original play, justly acclaimed Off Broadway. What right has anybody, even the United States Armythe playwright is askingto fiddle around with a human brain?The goal in this hypothetical drama is better soldiers, better, happier men. The patientsor victimsare three veterans, virtually imprisoned and awaiting their turn in the operation clinic. An electric wire bored into the skullwe get it in grisly detailwill produce a well-adjusted, well-controlled human robot.Now seen at mercilessly close range, the action seems far-fetched and bizarre, for all of Mr. Reardon's ferocious indignation and sincerity. The scenarist, Ron Whyte, and the director, Bernard Girard, have not betrayed the playwright. The pros and cons of the experiment are grippingly argued by Christopher Walken, as the brightest of the patients; Joss Ackland, as a conscience-bent surgeon and Ralph Meeker, as an ice-cold major (in the play, a general).The story and that plot resolution simply don't hold up, as X-rayed by the camera. What does sustain is the freezing horror of the hospital atmosphere, conveyed by the dialogue and two piercing, brilliant performances. We weren't sold on the plastic shrewdness of the young hero, voiced by Mr. Walken. But Ronny Cox as a stricken Texan and Bette Henritze as a very surprised hospital aideboth from the original playare wonderfully effective. And the play's the thing.",1972-06-29T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Come Back Charleston Blue,' Sequel to 'Cotton' in Harlem","A good deal of frenzy, if not conviction, is constantly generated by ""Come Back Charleston Blue,"" which crashed into the De Mille Theater and the 72d Street Playhouse yesterday with all the energy of a block party run amok. As the successor to ""Cotton Comes to Harlem,"" which introduced us two years ago to the cool exploits of the novelist Chester Himes's ultra hip black detectives, Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones, the film presents new adventures that are only occasionally funny or incisive.Since it was filmed in Harlem with Mark Warren, a black TV director, making his movie debut, and with a largely black cast headed by Godfrey Cambridge and Raymond St. Jacques, repeating their roles as those slick sleuths, a viewer might expect a lucid, intimate view of the black man's experience, seamy or otherwise. But a convoluted plot and dialogue that is often too ""in"" for the uninitiated serve to make only some parts of ""Charleston"" better than the whole, frenetic business.One finally gets the idea that Peter De Anda, seemingly a fashion photographer, is out to wrest Harlem's dope operations from Maxwell Glanville, who plays the black, Harlem representative of a white gang chief, portrayed by Leonardo Cimino. It's clear, however, that Coffin Ed and Grave Digger are cynically aware and will set things straight, their way, man, even if it means bucking their black captain, Percy Rodrigues, and the other local cats.Intense is the word for the performances of the principals, who don't have much of an opportunity for deep portrayals. Raymond St. Jacques again is a man with a low boiling point. Godfrey Cambridge again is happier with his lot, but just as fast with a gun or a quickly tossed quip.Jonelle Allen, of Broadway's ""Two Gentlemen of Verona"" and ""Cotton,"" gets her face rubbed with a grapefruit in James Cagney style as De Anda's girlfriend, and the rest of the cast is in and out of the action with perplexing speed. Who's Charleston Blue? A rough razortoter apparently rubbed out in 1932, who's still adored by Minnie Gentry, as a genial dowager hipped on the numbers game.Auto chases, gunfights, explosions, dope pushers and users operating in shocking and comic fashion are the essence of this caper. But random vignettes such as a bang-up, bloody debutante ball, someone dressed as a nun riding a motorcycle, or a junkie floating in ecstasy along Harlem's streets stick closer in memory than the over-all farcically sociological picture presented by ""Come Back Charleston Blue.""",1972-06-30T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Candidate,' a Comedy About the State of Politics, Opens:Robert Redford Plays Senatorial Hopeful Chronicle of a Doomed Campaign Is at Sutton","There is something perverse and puritanical in the way many liberal Americans regard the political system. If a candidate wants to win, he must be suspect. Ambition in itself is bad. Like athlete's foot, it's not a sin, but it is unseemly. We put great store by the kind of modesty that insures defeat and that, only then, is revealed to be a form of arrogance. The best man should lose, or he isn't the best man. This is the Catch-22 of American politics.We all know that men who run for public office hoping only to improve the tone of the campaign, to raise the real issues, usually fail  and look terrible on television, which may be even worse. We suspect that only winning counts, yet we also fondly believesince we've seen it demonstrated often enoughthat the system is so corrupt that no good man can win without either being hopelessly corrupted or turned into a bewildered cipher.That pretty well describes what happens to Bill McKay (Robert Redford), the liberal young California Democrat who campaigns for the United States Senate in ""The Candidate,"" one of the few good, truly funny American political comedies ever made. The film, which opened yesterday at the Sutton, was directed by Michael Ritchie (""Downhill Racer"") and written by Jeremy Larner, the young novelist (""Drive, He Said"") who was a speech-writer for Senator Eugene J. McCarthy during McCarthy's campaign for the 1968 Democratic Presidential nomination.""The Candidate"" is a loaded movie. It simplifies political processes. It turns McKay's Republican opponent, the long-time incumbent who looks as trustworthy as Warren G. Harding and is named, meaningfully, Crocker Jarman (Don Porter), into an idiot. It is also, at heart, extremely glib and gloomy but no more glib and gloomy, I think, than it has an inalienable right to be under the current circumstances.As McKay, in a self-mocking mood, says toward the end of his campaign, when the slogans, catchwords and clichs are becoming thoroughly muddled in his exhausted head: ""It's the basic indifference that made this country great.""The film, beautifully photographed by V. J. Kemper and John Korty, himself a talented young director (""Crazy Quilt,"" ""Funnyman""), looks smashing. It's as nervous and frenetic as the campaign it records through disasters and triumphs, at awful fund-raising dinners with jokey masters of ceremonies (one such dinner is attended by Senator Hubert H. Humphrey), and on dismal handshaking tours when the candidate gets slugged, is asked to autograph a bra and is accosted by a wildly sarcastic ghetto black who wants to know what McKay is going to do for his dog.""The Candidate"" is serious, but its tone is coldly comic, as if it had been put together by people who had given up hope. This is especially apparent in the progression of McKay (Redford's best performance to date), who begins as a politically uncommitted, liberal lawyer, fighting local battles for civil rights, ecology and such, and in the course of the campaign becomes, not corrupted, but rather neutralized, defused.""What do we do now?"" he asks when it's all over. It's a funny line that includes just a hint of doom, nothing as specific and immediate as a diagnosis of terminal cancer. The doom is farther off yet it will be no less fatal. The character suggests a young Kennedy or a Tunney, and he actually does have the sort of appeal that turns conservative old women into instant activists. However, in the course of the film the character takes on its own fictional life, and that is practically unheard of in movies of this sort, which usually rely on real-life identification.Almost as good as Redford are the members of the supporting cast, including Peter Boyle as McKay's campaign manager, Don Porter as the beautiful old incumbent, Allen Garfield as an ad-agency genius and Melvyn Douglas as McKay's father. A crucial and sad moment in the film is the television debate between the candidates, when McKay belatedly tries to talk about ""issues"" and simply flounders around. ""I wonder if anyone knew what I was trying to say,"" he asks his father. Answers Douglas with pride: ""Don't worry. It doesn't make any difference.""",1972-06-30T05:00:00+0000

Number Four, ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,"" arrived yesterday. It's not bad, as apes and 20th Century-Fox go, at least hand in hand.There's the plot, with a talking chimpanzee befriended by a circus owner and finally leading a swarm of enslaved hairy-clad pals in revolt in a futuristic world of icy-veined humans. The series' writer, Paul Dehn, nimbly continues the story from the predecessor, weaving in just enough crisp philosophizing on both sides to command attention.Furthermore, J. Lee Thompson's direction furiously propels the action in a compact chromium-and-glass settingand wait till you see that last battle royal. Don Murray, Hari Rhodes and Ricardo Montalban do well on the erring human side. But yesterday's audience at the New Embassy cheered the perservering apes and so did I. At 'em, boys!Can an ape look foxy? Roddy McDowall, who steals the picture as their articulate leader, certainly does, with those piercing eyes blinking through a shaggy hide.
