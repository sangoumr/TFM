Ms. Whitman is now almost even in polls with Jerry Brown, the Democrats major candidate, who also is the states former governor.

The installation  a commission for Lever House  pits paper and pencil against the soaring, glass curtain wall of Gordon Bunshafts modernist icon. But if its a David and Goliath matchup, then Haendel comes out on top. After all, a modernist glass tower has, relative to its size, a thin skin and these drawings seem to take direct aim at that vulnerability. Cracks  both literal and figurative  are the leitmotif: smashed glass, shattered light bulbs, arresting images of broken eggs, snaking power cables and a gigantic fingerprint fractured into dash marks. Haendel takes pleasure in toying with the conventions of display  the drawings are hung on two specially built and intentionally unfinished walls  and his use of tacks and staples is a delightful affront to the works inherent fragility.

Originally created in 1986 by the environmental artists Peter Richards and George Gonzales and newly restored, Wave Organ, which is part of the Exploratorium, is a 10-minute walk toward the Marina and out onto a jetty. Approaching the white and gray stone multi-layered structure I felt like I had been transported to a Greek island if not for the amazing view of the Golden Gate Bridge. I stepped out on to the granite and marble stones (which I later learned were donated to the project from an old Gold Rush era cemetery that was demolished to make way for a housing development), tilted my ear onto one of the numerous PVC pipes sticking out of the floor, and began to hear poetically eerie sounds. Each pipe makes a different sound depending on the tide. I then sat in a 3-sided room, listening to the music bounce off of the walls while seagulls dipped in an out of view.

Four months later, Spotanski wrote his bishop a 10-page memo on the abuse crisis, which he read aloud to Gregory in the bishops private study. In part, the memo was a blistering attack on the American hierarchy, from Bostons Bernard Law on down, for their dreadful negligence, cover-ups and excuse-making. In part, it was a blueprint for action: To have any chance of restoring their credibility, Spotanski wrote, the American bishops needed to invite victims from decades past to come forward and act swiftly on their claims, adopt strict nationwide standards for handling new allegations of sex abuse, and then turn over as much responsibility as possible for implementing the rules to an independent board of laypeople (and parents), who could issue annual reports and hold recalcitrant bishops feet to the fire.",2010-05-04T18:18:10+0000

The Department issued a stop-work order and an Environment Control Board violation this weekend to Elizabeth Houston Associates, the owner of a building on Houston Street near the Bowery on which Mr. Fairey recently installed a mural connected with his show at Deitch Projects in Soho. The mural was pasted onto a structure built on top of the original wall, preserving another mural by the Brazilian brothers known as Os Gemeos. According to Ryan Fitzgibbon, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, the violation was issued for installing the structure and the mural without a permit. She said the Environmental Control Board court would hold a hearing soon on the violation; if it stands, it could carry a penalty of up to $25,000. She added that the Department was also considering issuing a violation for illegal advertising on the grounds that the mural constituted an advertisement for the Deitch Projects show. But Daniel Killinger, a managing director of Goldman Properties, an affiliate of Elizabeth Houston Associates, said that Goldman did not see the mural as an advertisement. We see it as a continuation of the history of the art thats always been on that site, he said, referring to the Os Gemeos mural and a previous mural designed by Keith Haring.

The Broadway production of the play, which opened last week after transferring from Londons West End, collapsed almost as rapidly as its namesake: though its cast included Norbert Leo Butz (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Speed-the-Plow) and Gregory Itzin (24) as the Enron executives Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay, as well as Marin Mazzie (Kiss Me, Kate) as a composite Enron employee, it was shut out of most major categories. Stephen Kunken was nominated as a featured actor in a play, but its lack of a nomination for best play likely sealed its fate.

The company archives  from a coffee maker to candlesticks  now reside at the Yale University Museum of Art. Kaufman  who with his wife and business partner, Taffy Dahl, founded Donald Kaufman Color in the 70s  has long been the go-to guy for architects and decorators looking for that elusive shade of not-quite-gray-not-quite-white or flaming red. Take a tour of Philip Johnsons Glass House or grab a drink at the Julian Schnabel-designed Gramercy Park Hotel and you get the picture. But for four days this week, instead of making other people look good, Swid and Kaufman will bask in the spotlight as artists in their own right, when they show their personal work at Gallery 9E in Chelsea. Unsurprisingly, Kaufman  whose work has been in museums like the Whitney and the Hirshhorn, but who hasnt had an exhibition in over 30 years  is a painter. His series of gouaches on paper, he says, are inspired by architectural color samples. And true to form, Swid is more object-oriented, layering pieces of old books, cellophane, legal files and other found materials into three-dimensional reliefs. ",2010-05-06T15:47:55+0000

But no more: Ms. Perkins, who was nominated for three Emmy Awards in her five seasons on Weeds, is leaving the series, The Hollywood Reporter said.

The new suspects carried passports from Britain, Australia and France. The case has put an unwelcome spotlight on Israel, whose intelligence service, the Mossad, is widely believed to have ordered the killing. The Dubai police released extraordinary security video of the killers in February, along with their passport information, which in many cases was obtained fraudulently from dual citizens living in Israel.

Mr. Polanski, who fled the United States before sentencing in 1978, and his lawyers have asked the Los Angeles County Superior Court to provide them with transcripts of testimony by Roger Gunson, the original prosecutor in the case. In court filings, Mr. Polanskis lawyers have said Mr. Gunson described a plan under which Judge Laurence J. Rittenband intended to use Mr. Polanskis time in prison for psychiatric evaluation as his punishment in the case. In their brief on Thursday, Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley and Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said that the testimony should remain sealed and noted that the authorities in Switzerland, where Mr. Polanski is being held pending possible extradition, have not requested transcripts of the sealed testimony.

Spies had read about A Tool to Deceive and Slaughter, as the piece is called, on a Reuters financial blog. Thats a strange-enough place for a collector to learn about art, but Spiess interest seems even more curious given that the blogger Felix Salmons write-up of the pieces sale was titled The Uncollectible Artwork. Even if Spies won the object, created by a young artist named Caleb Larsen, his ownership would be tentative: the technical innards of A Tool to Deceive and Slaughter carried a program that would relist the thing on eBay every week, forever. Indeed, the terms and conditions for submitting a bid clearly stipulated that the device must be connected to the Internet, constantly trying to resell itself at a higher price to someone else.",2010-05-07T18:33:44+0000
us,The Plural of E-Mail,"Ashley Mergen asks: ""What is the proper plural of e-mail? When referring to snail mail, you would not say, 'I received a hundred mails,' but rather, 'I received a hundred pieces of mail' or 'I received a hundred mailings.' However, when referring to e-mail, one would say, 'I received a hundred e-mails.' Correct?""  The plural form of e-mail is, indeed, e-mails, even though there's no corresponding plural of mail as mails. This mismatch has rankled seekers of grammatical consistency over the years, but it has nonetheless settled into standard usage.  First some terminology. Nouns that can form plurals are called ""count nouns."" Mail, historically, is what is known as a ""mass noun""  a noun that can't be enumerated and thus resists pluralization, much like mud and milk, patience and poppycock. Some nouns can be either count or mass, depending on the context. General Sherman used war as a mass noun when he said, ""War is hell,"" while Benjamin Franklin used it as a count noun when he said, ""All wars are follies, very expensive and very mischievous ones.""  Many mass nouns have spawned countable spinoffs over time. Coffee is usually an undifferentiated mass (""Get me some coffee""), but in modern use it can also be treated as a count noun denoting a cupful of the beverage (""Get me a coffee"") or a variety of the bean (""We serve the finest Arabica coffees""). The Stanford linguist Arnold Zwicky has dubbed this process ""countification.""  When the word e-mail first made its appearance in the early 1980s (often capitalized as E-mail), it was simply a shortening of electronic mail, and so it worked grammatically much like the mass noun mail. To itemize mail into its constituent parts you need to find a workaround like pieces of mail or letters. Similarly, individual pieces of e-mail came to be called e-mail notes or more commonly, e-mail messages. (Single terms like e-notes or e-letters never caught on.)  By the late '80s, e-mail message was slowly but surely shortened to e-mail. In the archives of the magazine InfoWorld, the earliest use of e-mail as a count noun that I can find is from July 20, 1987, in an advertisement for International Data Group (IDG). ""Jane Lawrence, editor of IDG's PC Business World, receives an E-mail from [Ann] Wujcik requesting information,"" the ad reads. Though the magazine generally preferred e-mail message, by 1992 even InfoWorld's publisher Robert Metcalfe was using the short form: ""I have to admit I am now getting so many E-mails I can only read all and answer a few of them.""  The countable kind of e-mail(s) made further headway over the course of the '90s, despite complaints that it strayed from the founding model of mail, and by the turn of the millennium it had become widely accepted in mainstream usage. (The mass-noun version never went away, of course.) What happened? My theory is that the e- prefix no longer felt like such a transparent abbreviation of electronic, allowing e-mail to cast off the bonds that kept it close to mail of the snail variety. The word's new unitary feel was further strengthened by the trend of spelling it as email, without the hyphen. (The New York Times style guide continues to stick by hyphenated e-mail, and even advises using the older, longer form of the noun, e-mail message.)  The countification of e-mail mirrors some other recent developments in tech-talk. Unwanted e-mail, known as spam, is usually treated as a mass noun (just like the canned meat after which it is named), but individual spam messages now often get called spams. And the word blog, while always countable, has taken a new semantic turn: some use it to mean a single post to a Web site, rather than a whole site consisting of such posts. A recent survey by the Copyediting newsletter finds that most writers and editors reject this usage of blog as improper, but who knows? In a decade's time, it could be as unremarkable as countable e-mails.",2010-05-07T18:33:44+0000

Mr. Polanski, who fled the United States before sentencing in 1978, and his lawyers have asked the Los Angeles County Superior Court to provide them with transcripts of testimony by Roger Gunson, the original prosecutor in the case.

On the other you have the monstrously successful American Idol, whose ratings have seen worrisome declines this year amid complaints about a ho-hum lineup of contestants. Put the two phenomena together, as happened on Wednesday night, and you should have a high-wattage hit. But instead, the pairing just made the week worse for both parties. Hours after Lady Gaga appeared on the show to perform her songs Bad Romance and Alejandro, she was on Twitter complaining about how she was presented on the show. FOX POORLY + AMATEURLY edited+cut my performance/musical arrangement on idol, Lady Gaga wrote. She also provided a link to the Web site PerezHilton.com, where she said the full unedited performance could be found. Even in its shortened form, Lady Gagas performance was not much help to American Idol, which posted its worst Wednesday-night ratings since 2002.

us,"The Sound of Julie Andrews, Onstage in London"," Julie Andrews, right, sang with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at Londons O2 Arena on Saturday night in what was her first vocal performance in 13 years and her first stage appearance in Britain in more than 30 years, BBC News reported. The 74-year-old Ms. Andrews  whose voice was damaged in 1997 by surgery to remove throat polyps  mostly spoke during the performance, singing occasionally when accompanied by other vocalists and, in one case, the enthusiastic audience. She opened with Getting to Know You, from The King and I, and faded into the background as five other singers took over. That song began a tribute to Rodgers and Hammerstein, throughout which Ms. Andrews told stories about her work on stage and screen while video clips of her performances were shown above the stage. Though it was obvious that Ms. Andrews would not be hitting the high notes that helped define her career, she reassured her fans that she could still sing the hell out of Ol Man River. The audience, in turn, cheered for her rendition of My Funny Valentine, her one solo of the evening, and participated in a boisterous Do-Re-Mi singalong. During the second half of the show, Ms. Andrews narrated Simeons Gift, a childrens book she wrote with her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton, while the supporting cast played the books characters. And a finale of classics from South Pacific and The Sound of Music drew the last of the nights many standing ovations.",2010-05-09T22:41:20+0000

us,Betty White Helps Boost Ratings of SNL,"All it took to reinvigorate a 35-year-old comedy show was the presence of an 88-year-old woman. On Saturday, after more than 70 years in show business, six Emmy Awards and one improbable Facebook campaign, Betty White, left, got her shot at hosting Saturday Night Live. With her, the show had its highest ratings in a year and a half, according to preliminary Nielsen figures provided by NBC. Despite Ms. Whites opening monologue, which made distinctions between her generation and that of the SNL fans who pushed for her to host, she seemed at home on the show. She appeared in every sketch, playing, among others, an inadvertently naughty muffin mogul and a loopy census interviewee. The Mothers Day-themed episode, which brought back the past cast members Molly Shannon, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch and Ana Gasteyer, was also a rare occasion on which the mostly male SNL cast took a back seat to its women: Ms. Shannon and Ms. Gasteyer appeared in their NPR parody, Delicious Dish; Ms. Rudolph made a return appearance as Whitney Houston; and Ms. Poehler was temporarily reseated at the Weekend Update desk. The musical guest was Jay-Z.

In the original Newsweek article, published online in April, Ramin Setoodeh, a Newsweek contributor, wrote: While its OK for straight actors to play gay (as Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger did in Brokeback Mountain), its rare for someone to pull off the trick in reverse. Of Mr. Hayess performance in Promises, Promises, Mr. Setoodeh wrote: Frankly, its weird seeing Hayes play straight. He comes off as wooden and insincere, like hes trying to hide something, which of course he is. In her response, published on Newsweek.com, Ms. Chenoweth wrote: This article offends me because I am a human being, a woman and a Christian. For example, there was a time when Jewish actors had to change their names because anti-Semites thought no Jew could convincingly play Gentile. She added: Audiences arent giving a darn about who a person is sleeping with or his personal life. Give me a break!

Now, after so many bowls of feijoada, a young class of chefs is mixing cuisines and techniques and taking Brazilian cooking to a higher level. Checho Gonzles, 44, the heavily tattooed chef at the year-old restaurant Aj (Rua Bela Cintra, 1709; 011-55-11-3083-4022; entrees $17 to $27), fuses the flavors of his native Bolivia with the classics of Brazilian cooking. (Each of his knuckles is inked with the image of a popular local bar snack.) The meat stew cozido, for example, is made with tender chunks of picanha braised in red wine, and the caipirinhas are flecked with bright red aj peppers from the mountains of his homeland. At Marakuthai, tucked away in a house in Jardins (above; Alameda Itu, 1618; 011-55-11-3062-7556; entrees $20 to $29), the 21-year-old Renata Vanzetto takes inspiration from Thai food for her cooking, which is based on fresh local fruit and produce, for dishes like shrimp in curry sauce with coconut-crusted banana. And at Ka (Avenida Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek, 279; 011-55-11-3045-0043; entrees$22 to $37), a high-design Jardins hot spot, Paulo Barros uses Amazonian ingredients like star fruit and bacuri to localize his French-Italian menu.

A frustration voiced a lot these days  by art directors, writers, bloggers and others  is that people arent actually creating new things today. They are repeating, mimicking, collecting, downloading, endlessly commenting upon  activities that may be interesting andthat may reflect the present moment but are not about creating anything. One could even argue that they are the opposite of creativity and produce the feeling of being in a prison. Of course, when you consider the very real problems that many people in the world face, like hunger and shortages of medicine, these sorts of complaints sound silly. But creativity in the arts and in applied arts like fashion obviously does matter, and the ways that people insist on being outside the prison are interesting.

The series was barely renewed for its third season after Comedy Central sought to lower its budget, and Ms. Silverman, right, and her fellow producers said they would walk away from the show if they did. Ultimately a deal was struck in which Logo, the gay-theme cable channel, helped pick up some of the production costs.

It sold 117,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and is the bands third album to open at No. 1. But mothers  or those who shop for them  may have helped a number of other acts reach high on the chart. The Christian soft-rock group MercyMe opened at No. 3 with The Generous Mr. Lovewell (INO), which had 88,000 sales; Live at the Troubadour (Hear Music), by Carole King and James Taylor, bowed at No. 4 with 78,000; and sales of Mr. Bubls Crazy Love (143/Reprise) nearly doubled from the week before, to 29,000, lifting it seven spots to No. 15. Also on this weeks album chart, the pop-country band Lady Antebellums Need You Now (Capitol Nashville) holds at No. 2 with 97,000 sales, and Justin Biebers My World 2.0 (Island) falls one spot to No. 5 with 64,000. Last weeks top seller, The Adventures of Bobby Ray (Rebel Rock/Grand Hustle/Atlantic) by the 21-year-old rapper B.o.B., dropped to No. 12, giving it the dubious distinction of being the first No. 1 this year to fall straight out of the Top 10 the following week.",2010-05-12T22:13:33+0000

Forced landmarking has the effect of imposing the governmental idea of mission on the congregation, the churchs pastor, the Rev. Dr. Robert L. Brashear, said in an interview on Wednesday. There is a profound church-state issue here. Religious liberty has not been well served by this decision. Dr. Brashear estimated that it would cost $11 million to $12 million to restore the church, which has been closed about two years because of physical deterioration. The congregation, which has dwindled over the years, has been meeting at the nearby Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew.

us,Colleges Seeing No Downturn in Freshman Acceptances,"One measurement that selective colleges use to compare themselves is their respective admissions yields: the percentage of applicants offered acceptance who ultimately decide to enroll. A few institutions  including Harvard, Dartmouth, Cornell and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  have begun to report those figures for the freshman class that will take its seats next fall, and so far none have experienced any downturn in the midst of the sluggish economy. At Harvard, for example, more than three of every four applicants who received an acceptance letter had committed by the May 1 deadline to enroll, a slight increase over last year. (The university said it still expected to offer acceptance to as many as 75 applicants on its waiting list.) At Dartmouth, the yield for the new freshman class was 55 percent, an increase of seven percentage points; the increase was so large that the college said it might not have room for anyone on its waiting list. North Carolina said its yield was 53.3 percent (compared with 53.9 percent at this time last year). But that figure is likely to rise, as it does not include all responses to the nearly 350 wait-list offers the university made and whose replies are due next week. Cornell said its yield rate was relatively flat, 49 percent, as was that of the University of Pennsylvania, at 63 percent.

The post recounted how the real estate lawyers requested a $2,500 retainer and said that the total fee probably wouldnt exceed that amount. In the end, however, the fee was $6,450  including $60 for sending me this courtesy e-mail: I hope everything is O.K. Take your time.",2010-05-13T16:37:44+0000

G.D.P. is an index of a countrys entire economic output  a tally of, among many other things, manufacturers shipments, farmers harvests, retail sales and construction spending. Its a figure that compresses the immensity of a national economy into a single data point of surpassing density. The conventional feeling about G.D.P. is that the more it grows, the better a country and its citizens are doing. In the U.S., economic activity plummeted at the start of 2009 and only started moving up during the second half of the year. Apparently things are moving in that direction still.

During the campaign, when his former Chicago colleagues were asked to detail Barack Obamas intellectual evolution, many of them described him in these terms. But they knew Obama, at best, only partly exhibited this tradition.

By the time the economy began melting down some months later, her series of collages, ""The Figures,"" started evoking a more collective state of mind.

In her work, missing assets fall through Swiss-cheese-like holes and risk tolerance appears as complicated as a Pentagon PowerPoint. According to Pines, the piece she created for this issue of the magazine, above, titled, ""Corporations,"" isn't just about the way accounting practices are ""wacky on such a large scale for so many businesses.""

The theater and film designer Santo Loquasto created the costumes for the original Ragtime and for this seasons revival, and several of the costumes in both productions bore similarities. Costume designs that substantially duplicate work from a previous production are not eligible for Tony Awards, according to the Tony rulebook, but no one involved with Ragtime or the Tony Awards made a determination about Mr. Loquastos designs before they were announced on May 4 as among the four nominees for best costume design for a musical. In a statement on Thursday, Tony Award Productions  a joint venture of the Broadway League and the American Theater Wing, which oversee the Tonys  said that the revivals costume designs were too similar to the original designs to be eligible. We learned this too late to remove the costumes from consideration by the nominators but feel that we cannot allow the designs to remain in contention this year, and we must regretfully withdraw them from consideration as a nominee in the best costume design of a musical category, according to the statement. There will be no replacement made for the nomination, and voters will vote for one of the three remaining nominees. The other nominees are Marina Draghici for Fela!, Paul Tazewell for Memphis and Matthew Wright for La Cage Aux Folles.",2010-05-14T05:20:29+0000

If so, reports Chase Davis of California Watch, Mr. Kelly, a Democratic candidate for Attorney General who used to be charged with protecting security and privacy on Facebook, may soon be confronting some backlash. And while high-tech politicians are not much of a novelty these days, Mr. Kelly is among the first to emerge from the lightly regulated world of social media, where companies that collect and disseminate huge amounts of personal data from millions of users have been the focus of highly publicized privacy and security controversies.A Vineyard-Centric Bike Trail Is Born | One mile down, 43 to go.The Vine Trail in Napa is taking off thanks in large part to the leadership of Chuck McMinn of Vineyard 29, who spent 25 years in Silicon Valley at Intel and running start-ups. At a cost of roughly $1 million a mile, it will take years to complete the full length from the ferry terminal in Vallejo north to Calistoga. Mr. McMinn is applying the same energy to this project as he did to leveraging his high-tech skill and start-up fearlessness to build a gravity-flow winery with microturbine technology allowing it to generate its own electricity with extreme efficiency. Vineyard 29 became one of the hottest high-end wine brands. Then he turned his attention to philanthropic projects like the Vine Trail. It turned out that Mr. McMinns vision and expertise were the exact requirements to build the low-tech Vine Trail, which Mr. McMinn hopes to see finished within 10 years. ",2010-05-14T06:21:57+0000

us,The Mets Japanese Reliever Has an Immersion Progam in Spanish,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - Before Hisanori Takahashi left Japan for the United States to play baseball for the Mets, he did a little light studying of English words and phrases from a CD he bought, so by the time he arrived at spring training he was able to wish teammates and reporters a good morning in their native language and express his thanks.  At the time, Takahashi assumed that one of the keys to his adjustment to a new country would be to learn the new language of his teammates. What he did not realize was that perhaps he was studying wrong language. For Takahashi, the native language of his closest teammates, the ones he has spent the most time with during games, is not English, but Spanish. Since opening day on April 5, the left-handed Takahashi has been stationed in the bullpen, where he is surrounded by six other pitchers, all of whom grew up speaking Spanish in places like Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Puerto Rico. He has picked up almost as much of their language as English, and lately Spanish seems to be gaining dominance.  ""He can really speak some Spanish,"" said Pedro Feliciano, a reliever from Puerto Rico. ""His English is good, too, but I think in the last few weeks he has learned a lot of Spanish words.""  Since his fellow Japanese reliever Ryota Igarashi was injured April 20, and soon after went to Florida for rehabilitation work, Takahashi was forced into a kind of bullpen Spanish immersion program. Now that he could be replacing Oliver Perez in the rotation, his next Spanish lessons may come in the dugout.  ""The English is a little bit ahead of the Spanish right now,"" Takahashi said through his interpreter, Yoichi Terada. ""But only a little bit ahead.""  Of course, since this is baseball, a vocation dominated by young men, some - but certainly not all - of the words Takahashi is learning are of the crude variety. Takahashi never could have predicted it that within three and a half months of his arrival in the United States, he would be able to hurl slang like a Caracas cabdriver.  ""He hears some words in the bullpen and asks me about them,"" the Venezuelan relief pitcher Fernando Nieve said with a smile. ""Some bad words. But it's the same with us in English. That's what we learned first, too.""  Before a recent game in St. Louis, Takahashi was standing near the dugout with the Dominican reliever Jenrry Mejia as they waited for batting practice to begin. At the urging of a reporter, Mejia looked over at Takahashi and said, ""Habla Espaol?"" and Takahashi replied without hesitation.  Mejia laughed and shook his head, then repeated the words in English to the reporter, words that could not be used in front of children or a television camera.  But Takahashi, who regularly greets his Latino teammates with proper Spanish salutations, is also learning language suitable for mixed company. He has a little black book that he takes with him to the bullpen. The book is primarily used to study the tendencies of opposing hitters, and when he is finished pitching he will write the results of each pitch, each at-bat in the book.  He also has a section in the back where he writes down new phrases he has learned in Spanish, like buen trabajo (good work), buena suerte (good luck) and even the saucier and even the saucier cllate, which means shut up.  When Takahashi and Terada went to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic in March to get his work visa, they came back raving about one aspect of the city. ""Cerveza Presidente,"" Takahashi said, referring to the popular Dominican beer.  As far as baseball terminology, many of the words like fastball, slider and bullpen are universal, so Takahashi has not had trouble with them. When catcher Rod Barajas, who is fluent in English and Spanish, goes to the mound, he speaks to Takahashi in English, and there is an understanding. But so far, those conferences have not been complicated.  ""Luckily, I haven't had a serious situation yet with all the infielders coming to the mound to discuss the situation,"" Takahashi said. ""Maybe that will come. But in Japan, when those situations came up, I wouldn't listen anyway. I didn't care about what they were saying.""  Takhashi's obvious sense of humor and his willingness to learn has endeared him to his teammates, especially in the bullpen, where they appreciate the circumstances he is facing. Feliciano, who played in Japan in 2005, is facile at languages and can speak some Japanese with Takahashi. But he knows it can be lonely at times.   ""I went through that in Japan, and I don't want him to go through the same thing,"" Feliciano said. ""No matter where you are from, I want everyone to be bullpen buddies.""  Or, as Takahashi might put it, compaeros del bullpen.",2010-05-15T16:47:53+0000

us,Downtown Theater Company Faces Eviction,"The Metropolitan Transit Authority has threatened to evict the experimental media and theater group 3-Legged Dog from its Lower Manhattan building. The authority notified the group on Friday that it would begin eviction proceedings on Monday if 3-Legged Dog did not pay the more than $306,000 it owes the authority in back rent and interest. The group signed a 20-year lease in 2002 for space at 80 Greenwich Street, now known as 3LD Art & Technology Center, agreeing to pay $21,666.67 per month there after its former location at 30 West Broadway was destroyed in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, The Wall Street Journal reported. Kevin Cunningham, 3-Legged Dogs executive artistic director, confirmed that the company had fallen behind in payments when foundations withdrew financial support because of the recession. He also said the theater had been forced to spend its own money on building maintenance, including asbestos abatement, without reimbursement from the authority. Though he said he had offered to negotiate a payment plan, the two companies have been unable to reach an agreement. The authoritys spokesman, Jeremy Soffin, told The Journal, I dont know how anyone can justify letting this tenant rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in back rent at a time when state cuts and deteriorating tax revenues have forced the M.T.A. to lay off station agents and cut service.",2010-05-16T22:27:52+0000
us,The Big Bang Theory Gets Syndication Deal,"Prepare to see The Big Bang Theory on television a lot more often. Repeats of the popular CBS sitcom have been picked up by the cable channel TBS and by local stations owned by Fox in what is believed to be one of the most lucrative TV syndication deals ever, executives announced Saturday. The parties would not disclose the terms of the deal, but Variety reported that it set a record price for a cable off-network sitcom purchase. Warner Brothers, the producer and distributor of Big Bang, said stations interest in the series had risen steadily as it prepared to sell the repeats, in part because there are few traditional, multicamera comedies that attract a broad audience. Big Bang, which features Jim Parsons (above, with Mayim Bialik) is now in its third season and the highest-rated sitcom on television among adults aged 18 to 49. The repeats will start being shown on local stations and on TBS in the fall of 2011. TBS may schedule the episodes at 10 p.m. so that they lead into Conan OBriens coming talk show on that channel.",2010-05-16T22:29:35+0000

On Monday, the president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, had said he would appoint a new prime minister in an effort to end the longstanding rift within the government. That move immediately drew support from the United Nations special representative for Somalia, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah. Somalia has been without an effective central government since 1991, when the former government was toppled by clan militias and later turned against each other. The current transitional government, which was formed in a 2008 deal brokered by the United Nations, has failed to restore security and been weakened by constant attacks, roadside bombs, corruption, disputes, suicide bombers and piracy.

Bono and the Edge of U2 wrote Boy and a dozen more songs for the show, their first Broadway musical, which has suffered production delays because of financial problems but is expected to begin performances in New York this fall. Reeve Carney, the singer-frontman of the band that bears his name, is set to play Peter Parker and Spider-Man on Broadway, though he did not act in character while performing Boy at a luncheon honoring the musicals director, Julie Taymor. In the musical, Peter Parker sings the number after his love interest, Mary Jane, has been abducted and his super-powers are gone. Before the luncheon, Ms. Taymor described the financial stakes of the musical as extraordinarily high, saying Spider-Man would need to be a huge audience hit on par with her Disney musical The Lion King to cover its significant costs and ultimately turn a profit. But she sounded a note of confidence, adding: Im not doing this for a small audience. Im doing it for a world audience.",2010-05-19T01:05:39+0000

Mr. Holley said Ms. Lohan would be back in the United States by Friday evening.

On May 6, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of United States District Court in Manhattan granted a motion ordering the filmmaker, Joe Berlinger, to turn over the footage from his movie Crude as part of a lawsuit accusing Texaco, now owned by Chevron, of polluting the Amazon rain forest in Ecuador. The companys lawyers argued that the footage would show misconduct by the other side; Mr. Berlingers lawyers argued that his work should be protected under reporters privilege. The judge agreed that Mr. Berlinger enjoyed the privilege but ruled that it could be outweighed if the material was not confidential and likely relevant to the case. In a contentious hearing on Wednesday over whether the judge would stay his decision, Judge Kaplan made it clear he believed the chances of overturning were slight. In a 20-page opinion issued on Thursday, he wrote that he would not grant the stay but would delay the deadline for enforcing the subpoena from Friday until May 24, allowing all parties time to present arguments to the court of appeals.

Though Mr. Reubens, right, 57, is generally much more low-key than his impish, bow-tie-clad alter ego, his impending date with Broadway stirred a little Pee-wee style exuberance within him. I can hardly believe it, he said Wednesday evening in a telephone interview. Honestly, Ive been pinching myself. In January, Mr. Reubens revived The Pee-wee Herman Show at Club Nokia at L.A. Live in Los Angeles, the first time in several years that he had played the character for a sustained period. In New York, The Pee-wee Herman Show is scheduled to begin performances on Oct. 26 at the Stephen Sondheim Theater (the rechristened Henry Millers Theater).",2010-05-20T21:24:50+0000

Its a minimalist line aiming for friendlier prices in a world saturated with them. The standout piece among those presented was the print scarf dress, and I liked the crisp look of the trench skirt and the flattering cut of the slim pants. The kelly-green trench dress was cute, too. Though I saw connections to the Jil Sander aesthetic, past and present, those design values can be found in many placesUniqlo, Calvin Klein, Banana. Last year, I bought a Jil Sander pre-season draped-front dress in navy cotton jersey for about $590. Ive gotten lots of mileage out it, and its probably less money than some of the Navy pieces. So what am I getting? Were all making those kinds of decisions about clothes. Is a $200 pair of leggings or pants really worth it or will I trade up to something with a little more design? Will I stick with a trusty designer label and just buy less? Clearly a task before the team designing Navywhich is not Raf Simons team for the main Jil collectionsis to create smart, useful pieces that are a skip ahead of the lifestyle miasma.

us,Fraught,"W.F. Young asks: ""Long ago I developed the expectation that on encountering the word fraught, I'd find it associated with a prepositional phrase, 'with [something].' Now, in old age, I find that expectation dashed, often. Can you say what it was based on and anything about when, how or by whom it was undercut?""  Here we have a case of a very old word undergoing a rapid shift in contemporary usage. In Middle English, fraught (an etymological cousin of freight) was a verb meaning ""to load (a ship),"" and the identical form could serve as a past participle meaning ""laden (with)."" While the verb dropped out of the language almost entirely, the past participle stuck around, typically followed by ""with"" and an object -- often a burden, whether real or figurative.  Fraught as a standalone adjective meaning ""distressed, anxious, tense,"" without an accompanying prepositional phrase, is a 20th-century innovation. When the word cropped up on William Safire's radar in 2006, he offered a line from ""King Lear"" as a putative early example: Goneril tells her father to ""make use of that good wisdom, whereof I know you are fraught."" But Shakespeare did use fraught with a preposition, whereof, and an object, wisdom, so it is in fact very much in line with the usage of the era. Lear was surely in a distressed emotional state, but that wasn't what his daughter was driving at.  By the nineteenth century, the metaphorical extension of the word had developed a new twist. Instead of the traditional phrasing, fraught with followed by an object (something usually unpleasant or unfortunate), the object could appear before fraught in a hyphenated compound, such as danger-fraught, pain-fraught or war-fraught. Thus if a moment was fraught with emotion, it could just as well have been described as emotion-fraught or in time as emotionally fraught, signaling the implied object in the adverb.  The first glimmers of fraught without even a hint of an object start appearing in the 1920s and '30s. The earliest example I've found so far comes from a 1925 serialized story by Henry Leyford Gates about a flapper named Joanna. In one installment Gates writes, ""It was Joanna who at last broke the fraught silence."" The lyrical phrase fraught silence, perhaps evoking pregnant pause, shows up again in books from1934, 1946 and 1958. Another early use is in George O'Neil's 1931 novel about the poet John Keats, ""Special Hunger"": ""For Keats this was a singularly fraught circumstance."" Circumstances, along with anxiety-ridden situations, issues and relationships, would soon become familiar companions for fraught.  Standalone fraught picked up steam in the 1960s, attracting the notice of dictionaries and usage guides, but the last couple of decades have seen an even stronger uptick. In the texts collected in the Corpus of Contemporary American English from 1990 to 1994, only about 9 percent of the instances of fraught do not take the preposition with. From 2005 to 2009, however, the rate jumps to a whopping 30 percent. The usage has become a journalistic commonplace, as in the recent New York Times headlines, ""For New Stadium, a Fraught Coin Flip"" and ""Opera Companies' Fraught Seasons."" No doubt about it, we're living in fraught times.",2010-05-21T22:07:50+0000

The collector, Craig Robins, asserts in a lawsuit that he sold a Dumas painting through the David Zwirner Gallery in Chelsea in 2004 with an agreement that the sale remain confidential. But the gallery, which took over representation of Ms. Dumas in 2008, told her about it, Mr. Robins says, causing her to add his name to the blacklist. In court testimony, Ms. Dumass former dealer confirmed that the artist maintains a blacklist of collectors and dealers whom she believes to be speculating in her works. Mr. Robins says that the Zwirner gallery promised to help get him off the blacklist and to sell him new paintings but failed to do so. The gallery has denied the claims. Mr. Robins sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the gallery from selling three paintings in a show of new work, paintings that Mr. Robins contends he should have the right to buy. But Judge William H. Pauley denied the request for the restraining order, in part because Mr. Robins provided no written evidence of his claims against the gallery.",2010-05-21T22:48:41+0000

The players, who are not related, were suspended by the league in 2008 because they tested positive for bumetanide, a diuretic banned by the league because it can mask steroids. The substance was in StarCaps, a weight-loss supplement that the players admitted taking. The players claimed in court that they were employed by the Vikings and therefore governed by Minnesotas drug testing policies, which are at odds with the N.F.L.s policy in some ways. Earlier this month, Gary Larson, a Minnesota district court judge, said that the N.F.L. was the players employer and that they were beholden to the leagues drug policy. On Friday, Larson said that the league could not suspend the players while they appealed that decision to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. ",2010-05-22T02:23:36+0000

Surely the only Palme winner to feature sex between a princess and a thrashing catfish, Boonmee is a fantastical tale about a dying man whose past lives  and ghostly relatives  enraptured some critics while turning others off. The speculation that it might appeal to the jury president, Tim Burton, along with some of his more discerning fellow jury members, proved true. ",2010-05-23T22:05:41+0000
us,The Green Ogre Stumbles,"Shrek Forever After was No. 1 at North American multiplexes over the weekend but failed to meet even cautious expectations, probably because of franchise fatigue and pushback from consumers over the rising cost of 3-D tickets. The movie, from DreamWorks Animation, brought in an estimated $71.3 million, far from chump change but sharply below opening tallies for the franchises previous two movies, which did not have premium-priced 3-D tickets to prop them up. DreamWorks expects positive word of mouth and a lack of competition from other family films to help Shrek Forever After blossom into a substantial hit, much as the studios How to Train Your Dragon overcame a soft opening weekend. DreamWorks always expected the fourth Shrek to have a weaker debut than Shrek the Third (more than $122 million opening; $799 million global total), partly because of the franchises age. Last week analysts lowered expectations for Shrek Forever After based on prerelease surveys. Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen & Company, wrote that those surveys pointed to an opening below the $110 million to $140 million range we think the film needs to hit in order to meet investor expectations. Other analysts had lowered expectations to $75 million to $90 million. Iron Man 2 was second over the weekend with $26.6 million, for a new total of $251.3 million. Robin Hood was third with $18.7 million ($66.1 million total). Letters to Juliet was fourth with $9.1 million ($27.4 million total), and Just Wright was fifth with $4.2 million ($14.6 million total).",2010-05-23T22:16:32+0000

In his first solo exhibition with the Los Angeles gallery Blum & Poe, which opened on Saturday, the artist not only tinkers with scale, moving parts and myriad materials, but also grapples with big life issues like mortality, renewal and the passage of time. The centerpiece of the exhibition is a monumental kinetic sculpture called Orrery, a reference to apparatuses that represent the motions and phases of the solar system. A larger-than-life figure of a woman, at once benign and sinister  is she Mother Time, perhaps?  sits at a spinning wheel made of recycled plastic bottles. Everything about the sculpture is circular, interconnected and eternally spinning  the womans ears, fingers and the bun on her head; the spinning wheel and the circular platform on which she sits. Even the pattern on her dress, a motion illusion designed by a Japanese psychology professor, seems to spin. The effect is hypnotic as both viewer and figure cycle between the material and cosmic worlds.",2010-05-25T20:15:23+0000

us,Star-Driven Shows Helped Broadway Sales,"Broadway productions grossed a total of $1.02 billion during the 2009-10 season, which officially ended on Sunday, with premium-price tickets for star-driven shows like A Steady Rain, Hamlet and A Little Night Music (above, with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Lazar) increasing box-office sales despite a 3 percent decline in attendance compared with the previous season, according to new data from the Broadway League. The overall gross of $1.02 billion was a slight improvement on the $1 billion gross for 2008-9, although the latter figure did not include box-office sales for the now-shuttered musical Young Frankenstein. That shows producers did not provide weekly grosses to the Broadway League, an industry group of theater owners and producers that collects and publicly releases weekly box-office data. Factoring in Young Frankenstein, the 2008-9 season could have grossed up to 1 percent more money than the 2009-10 season, said Charlotte St. Martin, executive director of the Broadway League. Total attendance at Broadway shows during the 2009-10 season was 11.9 million. The seasons financial gains despite audience losses can be explained partly by the success of some plays and musicals that sold a portion of their best seats at a premium, for $300 or more, while other shows struggled to fill seats.",2010-05-25T22:19:11+0000

The Twitter message drew an apology from the student and a statement by the university that it was deeply distressed.

The tweet included a link to a YouTube video of Mr. Cormans speech, given on May 16 at the Class Day ceremony for the School of General Studies, in which Mr. Corman shared a story that seemed to come from his firsthand experience about a student who challenged a Star Trek-theme question on an exam. Mr. Oswalt has told a similar anecdote in his stand-up routine. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Mr. Oswalt said that Mr. Cormans actions reflected a lack of respect for comedians. In peoples heads they think that comedians cant possibly make up their own material, Mr. Oswalt said. They must get it out of joke books. In a statement Peter J.

Maya, as she is called, was nine months pregnant (to the day), and while she was onstage rapping about some some some I some I murder, some I some I let go  in a black skintight, body-stocking dress, transparent except for polka-dot patches that strategically covered her belly, breasts and derrire  she began to experience contractions. As the pain hit, Maya was performing with the male titans of rap (Jay-Z, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, T.I.) and she later told me that she thought all the free-floating testosterone caused her to go into labor. While American rappers today tend to celebrate sex, wealth and status, Maya, who grew up listening to the politicized rhymes of Public Enemy, takes international dance beats and meshes them with the very un-American voice of the militant rebel. In contrast to, say, Bono or John Lennon, with their peacenik messages, Maya taps into her rage at the persecution of Tamils in Sri Lanka to espouse violence: while youre under the sway of the beat, shes rapping, You wanna win a war?/Like P.L.O.

It would restrain 15 named individuals from a variety of activities, including weapons possession, trespassing and witness intimidation. It would also keep suspected gang members from associating with one another in a 100-block swath of the city and impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. In other Bay Area cities, like Fairfield, civil liberties groups have attacked such injunctions as violations of constitutional rights. In Oakland, opponents argue that an injunction would do little to curb crime and much to prompt racial profiling. A report in The Bay Citizen said that a series of at least four killings put law enforcements focus on the north Oakland group.

The top two vote-getters, regardless of party affiliation, or lack thereof, would face each other in the general election. Voters ultimate choice could be two Republicans or two Democrats, but it is likely that they would be the best-known or the wealthiest of the original field. Supporters say the measure would empower moderates and increase turnout. The states $19 billion deficit, high unemployment and low morale may help the measures chances; polls show a majority of voters favor it. [The New York Times]",2010-05-27T12:29:53+0000

The novel, with the working title Project X, is expected to be set in the present day and take Bond to at least three exotic locations around the globe. It is scheduled for publication in May 2011. Mr. Deaver, the author of The Bone Collector and Garden of Beasts, said in a statement that he was thrilled to be asked by representatives of the Ian Fleming estate to write the book. The novel will maintain the persona of James Bond as Fleming created him and the unique tone the author brought to his books, while incorporating my own literary trademarks: detailed research, fast pacing and surprise twists. The book will be published by Hodder & Stoughton in Britain and Simon & Schuster in the United States. More than 100 million Bond books have been sold. ",2010-05-27T22:18:20+0000

us,Letters: Cass Sunstein Wants to Nudge Us,"The libertarian nudging espoused by Cass Sunstein sounds like a happier and more effective way to get things done than the paternalistic dictatorialism so pervasive on all sides of todays legislative and policy divides. Where Sunsteins notion involves understanding and leveraging human nature to promote essential behavior change, the governing mantra on topics like safe cellphone use, resource conservation and health care reform consistently seems to hinge on the imposition of iron-fisted mandates backed by punishments for noncompliance. This isnt to argue that both pleasure and pain cannot have a role in affecting widely distributed individual actions. But social and environmental-marketing case history is replete with successes that came because policy makers clearly perceived the true strategic value of inspiring people to do the right thing before pulling out the big Draconian stick. In the world of governance, I think the technical name for that approach is leadership.JEF LOEBSan Francisco",2010-05-27T23:03:31+0000

Birth control would be legally denied them until 1967. Next door, in Switzerland, women would not be enfranchised until 1971. Such repressive circumstances account for both the fierce, often wrathful urgency of Beauvoirs book and the vehement controversies this founding text of feminism aroused when it was first published in France in 1949 and in the United States in 1953. The Vatican placed it on the Index of Forbidden Books. Albert Camus complained that Beauvoir made Frenchmen look ridiculous. On these shores, the novelist Philip Wylie eulogized it as one of the few great books of our era, the psychiatrist Karl Menninger found it pretentious and tiresome, and a reviewer in The Atlantic Monthly faulted it for being bespattered with the repulsive lingo of existentialism.",2010-05-28T00:11:53+0000

In January 2009, as Brandeiss finances eroded badly during the recession, its trustees voted to transition the museum  founded in 1961 and the repository of works by de Kooning, Warhol, Lichtenstein and other major artists  into a teaching center and gallery, followed by an orderly sale or other disposition of its works in order to raise money for the school. In a telephone interview Jehuda Reinharz, the Brandeis president, said the university was now working with Sothebys, which approached it a year ago, to find ways to make money by lending works from the collection or entering into partnerships with other institutions. He said the university would be committed to using some of the income to benefit both the museum and the fine arts program. The income from any kind of partnership or lease would generate fewer dollars, but on the other hand wed still be the owner of the art, said Dr. Reinharz, who last year announced his plans to step down as president as soon as a successor was named. A group of the museums benefactors sued the university in July 2009 to prevent any sales, and that lawsuit is proceeding. While Dr. Reinharz would not rule out the possibility that selling might still be necessary at some point, he said it was now unlikely. RANDY KENNEDY",2010-05-28T06:14:00+0000

Sometimes I have the sneaking suspicion that Lord enjoys exaggerating his own role as the guileless young man, so as to push some hero or villain into higher relief. And he certainly knows how to grab a reader, beginning his portrait of another one of his friends, the Viscountess of Noailles, with this wealthy patron of the arts on her deathbed, shrieking, I dont want to die, a tragic figure in a Parisian mansion hung with her peerless collection of work by Goya, Degas and Picasso.

The musical had received strong reviews at the Gielgud Theater but its producers, who include Cameron Mackintosh, said a confluence of factors had contributed to its closing. In a statement, they wrote: Cameron and the U.S. producers have decided not to recast Hair when the Broadway company finish their London engagement. The fall in tourism, the ash cloud and the election has caused a drop in audience figures, which has also affected shops, restaurants and hotels across London. Meanwhile, another of Mr. Mackintoshs West End productions may soon gain another familiar American face.

us,Judge Urges Resolution in Use of Obama Photo,"A federal judge on Friday encouraged the parties involved in a dispute over Shepard Faireys Hope poster of Barack Obama, which is based on an Associated Press photograph, to come to a resolution, suggesting that The A.P. was likely to prevail in court. Mr. Fairey filed suit against The A.P. last year seeking a judges declaration that his poster was protected from copyright infringement claims. The A.P. then filed an infringement suit against Mr. Fairey, who has acknowledged that the poster was based on a photograph of Mr. Obama taken in 2006 by Mannie Garcia, a freelance photographer. On Friday, Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York said in a hearing that whether its sooner or later, The Associated Press is going to win the case. Though Mr. Garcia has said that he was not working for The A.P. when he took the photograph, lawyers for The A.P. presented evidence at the hearing, including human resources forms and other documents, that Mr. Garcia was employed by the news service at that time and that the photograph was a work for hire. Geoffrey S. Stewart, a lawyer for Mr. Fairey, said, Mr. Fairey would of course be happy to resolve his differences on an amicable basis with The A.P., but it does not appear The A.P. is interested in it. Dale Cendali, a lawyer for The A.P., said, The A.P. was very encouraged by the hearing today and remains committed to vindicating the rights of photojournalists everywhere. George Carpinello, a lawyer for Mr. Garcia, had asked at the hearing to be removed from representing the photographer, but said in an interview that he would stay on and hoped to meet with The A.P. next week.",2010-05-28T22:18:40+0000

It did not appear that the former director, Sylvestre Larack, was under arrest as of Friday evening, but he remained in isolation at the judicial police headquarters and he was not free to leave, the official said. After the inmate deaths in Les Cayes, Mr. Larack had been promoted to run the countrys largest prison, the national penitentiary in Port-au-Prince. Last Sunday, The New York Times published a report on the killings at Les Cayes, indicating that the authorities had shot unarmed detainees and then sought to cover it up. This provoked the Haitian president, Ren Prval, to establish a joint Haitian-United Nations commission of inquiry, and Mr. Larack, who was found last month to have lied to police investigators about the killings, is being questioned once again.

The four killed Cai Qianwen in October 2009 by shoving him down a mine shaft, according to the court in Yunnan. They then approached the mine owner and asked for $42,500 in compensation, saying they were relatives of Mr. Cai. The owner called the police. Two assailants were given suspended death sentences, and two others were sentenced to 15 years in prison. It is unclear whether the case is related to the arrests in late 2009 of nine people in Sichuan Province who were accused of killing or helping kill mentally challenged people in mines to extort money.

As we remember the heroes who laid down their lives for freedom, let us also spare a thought for a hero of the mind, who passed away some days ago at the age of 95. When I first encountered Martin Gardners columns in Scientific American as a schoolboy many years ago, my reaction was one of awe. Here was pure intelligence incarnate, I thought, coming up with puzzles of mind-bending difficulty month after month and explaining the ideas behind them with crystal clarity. I was convinced that Martin Gardner was the smartest man in the world. The profusion of his writings, their quality and the sheer length of time that he kept on producing them, month after month, were just mind-boggling. When he retired from Scientific American in 1981, I was convinced that no one could fill his shoes. Although I much admired Douglas Hofstadter, who replaced him, and was a great fan of Gdel, Escher, Bach I just knew that no one else could keep this up for as long as Martin Gardner had. And so it proved to be. It is a tribute to Martin Gardners oeuvre that the final considered impression that he left is not very different from the one seen through the eyes of a hero-worshiping adolescent.",2010-05-31T13:49:30+0000
