The chamber elections this week were the first polls in the country in which women were allowed to run. There were 17 women among the 71 candidates in the elections, and the two, Lama al-Sulaiman and Nashwa Taher, were part of an alliance that swept most of the 12 seats on the chamber's board. Women could neither vote nor run in the kingdom's first nationwide municipal elections, earlier this year. But the chamber elections are thought to be a prelude to voting by women in municipal elections in 2009. Hassan M. Fattah (NYT)",2005-12-01T05:00:00+0000

George Pataki responded to the fatal shooting of Officer Dillon Stewart this week with a call for reinstating the death penalty. That is unlikely to save the lives of officers who find themselves facing violent suspects. Most potential cop killers are not the kind of people likely to consider the consequences of their worst impulses.

And both the late actor's relatives and the authorities are at a loss, if not quite spellbound. The thief used a concrete saw to cut through terrazzo and sidewalk, then carted off the 300-pound, five-pointed pink star bearing Peck's name and the motion-picture logo, both rendered in brass. It was not the first caper involving a star's star, said Johnny Grant, the civic figure known as the mayor of Hollywood: James Stewart's and Kirk Douglas's stars were once lifted from a storage area by a construction worker. And Gene Autry's star, according to legend, once disappeared to the wilds of Iowa. All three stars were quickly replaced, as was Peck's, which was unveiled again yesterday afternoon. Mr. Grant said the thieves had very likely struck sometime before the middle of November, though no one could pin it down. ""It is bizarre,"" said his widow, Vronique Peck. ""It reminds me that the word 'fan' comes from 'fanatic.' "" She said she had visited her husband's star with their grandchildren a year ago and appreciated its importance to tourists.

There were several dozen year-round residents living on Alta, a fishing hole 75 miles north of Vancouver. The locals were intrigued by the sound made by the western hoary marmots at the lake, so they called the area Whistler. The 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley in California inspired a group of Vancouver businessmen to build a ski resort and bid for the Games. London Mountain was rechristened Whistler Mountain and opened for skiing in 1966. A dozen years later, an area used as a dump was transformed into a European-style town. Now there are 115 places to stay -- from ski chalets to luxury hotels -- almost 100 bars and restaurants and 200 places to shop. Those Olympic dreams? They'll come true in February 2010 when events like skiing and sledding are held in and around Whistler. Now is a good time to visit, before the gold rush starts. BOB MACKIN",2005-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Prosecutors have charged that the brothers, whose real last name is Lorenzo, used their rap label, Murder Inc., to wash $1 million in narcotics profits for a Queens drug dealer,cocaine kingpin Kenneth McGriff. Lawyers for the two men have said that Mr. McGriff helped provided a service to the record label, now known as The Inc., keeping at bay ""the street element"" and anyone who might have sought to extort money from the company.

us,ROY DeFOREST,"Back in the 1970's, regionalism was a dirty word. In the thoroughly global outside-is-in art world of today, it is barely a word at all. But the artists at whom it was aimed -- postwar Americans working outside New York and Los Angeles -- continue to suffer from its fallout. The singular greatness of Jim Nutt and Peter Saul has only recently started to come into focus; the achievements of H. C. Westermann, Robert Arneson and Joan Brown are less fixed in art world consciousness than they should be. Ditto for Roy DeForest, who is showing new paintings for the first time since 1997 at the George Adams Gallery in Chelsea. At 75, Mr. DeForest is painting pretty much what he has painted for years: dogs, men in hats or headdresses, and supernatural beings against a flattened terrain. Angular, masklike, brusquely rendered, they all seem shamanistic and slightly crazed; their bright, staring eyes imply the ingestion of hallucinatory substances. Mr. DeForest continues to favor dense compositions and oppressively bright colors unrelieved by much in the way of white. (The white goat in ""Goat Daze,"" above, is an exception.) His signature technique persists: tiny dollops of paint, whose culminating twists suggest chocolate chips but also thumbtacks, with their points facing out. His new works have become slightly more structured: compartmentalized into patchworks of portraits, friezes and pictures within pictures, as if the artist had a new appreciation for classic American folk art. They are also more inventive and sensuous in their handling of paint. The bristling textures have diversified -- new additions include mosaiclike sections of dried acrylic paint -- and the clearer composition increases their impact. These works have a blatant, consummate ease. If Mr. DeForest's goal is to transfer the ecstatic experience of the world from his creature-subjects to his creature-viewers, it has never been more clearly or radiantly stated.

Its music was rugged swing and harmony and texture and sweeping, singable tunes, acoustic jazz full of a reason for being.

In ""Prone,"" above, which opens tonight at the Kitchen, he's gone small. Seating (so to speak) is extremely limited, with audiences splitting time between inflatable mattresses arranged within the dancers' space and chairs set up around the performance area. Lying on their backs, viewers can watch the action unfold as reflected in a mirrored ceiling or rely more on their peripheral vision. The choreographer, always interested in perception and spatial configuration, has experimented with mirrors before; in 2003's ""just two dancers"" at Dance Theater Workshop, audience members used hand-held mirrors to watch various sections of the dance. Likewise, in ""Prone,"" viewers are expected to become active participants and decision makers, figuring out how best to watch the dancers Luciana Achugar, Levi Gonzalez and Eleanor Hullihan. Don't let those mattresses fool you; Mr. Jasperse demands just as much from his audiences as he does from his dancers. ""Prone"" is danced to a commissioned score by Zeena Parkins, performed live. Mr. Jasperse is both visual and lighting designer, with Joe Levasseur. If the choreographer's previous works are any indication, all of the artistic elements will more than pull their own weight.

us,DAMIAN MARLEY,"Bob Marley's youngest son, Damian Marley, 28, has been working at his music career for longer than a minute. His album ""Halfway Tree"" (Universal) won the 2002 reggae Grammy Award without causing much of a popular stir. But this year Mr. Marley, above, had a big hit with the rueful social critique ""Welcome to Jamrock."" Absent any trendy braggadocio or bullying electronics, the song is a throbbing throwback to the observational political style of Jamaica's pre-dancehall days. But this retro ploy isn't a sign that the hip-hop-savvy Mr. Marley is stuck in the past. Rather, he has proved to be a step ahead of a game saturated with booty beats and gruff toasters, both righteous and clownish. He saw an opening in reggae for the sort of incantatory agit-prop that would remind people of his country's continuing exploitation at the hands of drug traffickers, opportunistic government sellouts and, of course, hedonistic tourists. The radio and remix crowd ate it up. Its haunting vocal sample, taken from an Ini Kamoze song -- ""Out in the streets, they call it murder"" -- resonated not only with Jamaican poverty but also with the strife of the disenfranchised, from Iraq to the American South. That pointed, ghostly refrain became the DJ segue of the summer. The song still had traction as the Katrina tragedy unfolded, when another passage seemed to voice the collective frustration of places like the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans: ""To see the sufferation sicken me/ Them suit no fit me/ To win election they trick we/ And they don't do nuttin' at all."" (Mr. Marley plays on a bill with X-Clan. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street.

us,'STANDARD GAUGE: FILM WORKS BY MORGAN FISHER',"The Whitney Museum of American Art continues to journey down avant-garde memory lane, with a retrospective devoted to Morgan Fisher. Like the films of Owen Land (a k a George Landow), the subject of a recent museum retrospective, Mr. Fisher's work falls under the rubric of structural film in that it calls attention to its own materiality as well as to the conditions of its production and reception. One significant difference is that like many filmmakers who work in the shadow of Hollywood, the Santa Monica-based Mr. Fisher has long explored the space that segregates art cinema from industrial moviemaking. A film like the one-minute-30 second-long ""Wilkinson Household Fire Alarm"" (1973), an eye-blink homage to Marcel Duchamp, is more obviously engaged with conceptualism than with studio manufacturing. Yet many more of Mr. Fisher's films explore the divide between art and industry directly, including his autobiographically inflected 1984 short ""Standard Gauge,"" above, in which he traces the history and uses of 35-millimeter film through discarded bits of celluloid and a voice-over that waxes both pedantic and poetic. This dialectical engagement continues in the 2003 short ""( ),"" in which the filmmaker shows his editing skills to bravura effect by stringing together insert shots -- those discrete images of, say, a newspaper headline or a pointed gun that fix your attention on narrative details and actions -- that he has lifted from other movies. Although Mr. Fisher includes clocks and dice in his entrancing cavalcade -- which ebbs and flows like a series of unfinished stories -- what seizes the imagination are all the hands clutching weapons and knees, flying across typewriter keys and cooking and serving. Here, from the detritus of the movie industry, Mr. Fisher has created singularly, authentically handmade art. (""Standard Gauge: Film Works by Morgan Fisher 1968-2003"" runs through Feb. 12 at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Kaufman Astoria Studios Film and Video Gallery, second floor, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street; information: (800) 944-8639) MANOHLA DARGIS THE LISTINGS | DEC. 2--DEC. 8",2005-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Paul Weinberger, chairman of the Lowe London office, resigned on Thursday to join Sir Frank at the new agency. Sir Frank, left, who founded Lowe in 1981, retired at the end of 2003 and agreed with Interpublic not to poach Lowe clients or employees for two years. The Web sites of the trade publications Advertising Age and Campaign reported that Sir Frank's new agency would open with the Tesco account, the largest handled by Lowe London; Mr. Weinberger has for many years supervised the creative part of the account. The loss of Tesco, which spends $75 million on advertising, would be a blow to Lowe, which has lost assignments from clients like Century 21, HSBC, Macy's and Unilever in Britain and the United States. Interpublic has installed new management at Lowe in an effort to turn around the agency. ""Interpublic remains committed to Lowe and the path it is taking,"" Michael I.

Peppered with Henrik Drescher's exuberantly creepy mixed-media illustrations, the book takes a geographic joy ride through the international imagination, finding folk monsters like the Ovda of Finland, which tickles its victims, and the Adaro of the Solomon Islands, which likes to throw poisonous flying fish at people for no reason. More familiar characters are found in Fantasy Encyclopedia (Kingfisher, $24.95, ages 9 to 14), by Judy Allen, with a foreword by Jonathan Stroud, which takes a more comprehensive approach to cataloging creatures from ancient mythology to modern fiction. Lavish illustrations by John Howe, Nicki Palin and Patricia Ludlow complement photographs of cultural artifacts and document a few nonimaginary subjects, including the Romanian tyrant Vlad the Impaler, who sounds just as unnerving as the boggarts, trolls and basilisks roaming through the book.",2005-12-04T05:00:00+0000

But don't hate Paul Zollo, an editor at American Songwriter, for fulfilling the dream first and confirming what you've suspected all along: that Petty is an undeniably fascinating guy to talk to. Sure, there is some dead air in these interviews, but it's abundantly offset by Petty's indelible stories of his Florida upbringing by a father who liked to poke alligators in the eye for fun, and the time the supposedly laid-back Petty became so frustrated with a recording session that he punched a wall, shattered his fist and spent eight months retraining himself to use his left hand. And the chapter devoted to Petty's memories of a bassist who eventually died from a heroin overdose may be the most chilling deglamorization of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle since ""Sid and Nancy.""",2005-12-04T05:00:00+0000

Looping round the complex, mechanised route, Landy's furniture, record collection, clothing and even his car were first inventoried and then systematically dismembered, divided and shredded. The work attracted considerable press attention and provoked a powerful public response. Landy's emphasis on destruction was seen as a challenge to the champions of consumerism and as a strong commentary on the seductions of acquisition and ownership. The setting, the bare interior of a store stripped of its lighting, counters and displays, was central to the work's meaning (Figure 1).

Both singers have been the objects of considerable hype, but while I haven't heard them together live in an opera house, there are indications that they're at least partly as good as their billing. Mr. Villazn has an ardent blood-and-guts Domingo-esque delivery; what people seem to be asking is just how big the sound is in the opera house. (It seemed perfectly adequate to me in recital last year.) Ms. Netrebko's ""Sempre Libera"" aria album struck me as a little bloodless and machinelike, but on the recording of their ""Traviata"" in Salzburg this summer, which came out earlier this month, she seems if anything overemotional. It's a tossup whether you want to spend the money for the ""Traviata"" recording -- on which Thomas Hampson does not do much to further his case as a Verdi baritone -- or on one of the few tickets left for ""Rigoletto,"" a show that spotlights the baritone even more: CARLO GUELFI appears in the title role. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000.",2005-12-04T05:00:00+0000

Lawrence's ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" in 1959, Henry Miller's ""Tropic of Cancer"" in 1961 and William S. Burroughs's ""Naked Lunch"" in 1962. The Evergreen Review, begun in 1957, expanded America's literary, political and psychic palette, providing the first widespread domestic access to political figures like Che Guevara and Malcolm X and literary figures like Jean Genet, Eugne Ionesco, Harold Pinter and the Beats.

us,Inside the list,"MAKING BOOKER: John Banville's Booker Prize-winning novel, ""The Sea"" is No. 28 on this week's extended hardcover fiction list, and it seems unlikely to climb much higher -- making it the third Booker selection in a row, after DBC Pierre's ""Vernon God Little"" (2003) and Alan Hollinghurst's ""Line of Beauty"" (2004) not to rise into The Times's top 15. The last Booker winner to make a deep impression on this country's readers was Yann Martel's ""Life of Pi"" (2002), which spent three months on the Times list in hardcover. Banville's novel is selling well in independent bookstores -- if this week's list were based only on sales from indie booksellers, omitting the chain stores, ""The Sea"" would move up 20 spots to No. 8. Banville's novel has taken a beating since the Booker announcement. (Writing in The Independent of London, Boyd Tonkin said the jury made ""the most perverse and perhaps the most indefensible choice in the 36-year history of the contest."") Banville didn't help his case when he said, while accepting his award, ""It's nice to see a work of art winning the Booker Prize."" Banville, at this point, may feel some sympathy with Pierre, who accepted his 2003 Booker by commenting, ""As Lloyd Bridges said, 'I think I picked the wrong week to give up sniffing glue.'

The trial began on Sept. 21. Ayhan Surucu, the youngest brother, had confessed to the murder and claimed that he had done it without any help. According to Seyran Ates, a lawyer of Turkish descent, it is generally the youngest who are chosen by the family council to carry out such murders -- or to claim responsibility for them.

That's because almost all the books that made our weekly choice of recommended titles automatically landed on the year-end list. Last year we trimmed the list to 100 and have done so again this year. Why? Simply put, the longer list had become unwieldy -- a dauntingly expansive grab bag rather than a concise guide to exceptional books. Not that limiting the number to 100 is an ideal solution, or that the results are authoritative. On the contrary, the choices are wholly subjective. Had each member of our editorial staff drawn up a separate list, no two would be identical. What we present here, then, is a rough consensus.

Even during the last nine months of her life, after she was discovered to have myelodysplastic syndrome, or M.D.S., a particularly virulent blood cancer, she continued to persevere in the belief that she would be the exception. M.D.S. is technically a precursor to acute myeloid leukemia. On average, its survival rates across the generational cohorts are no better than 20 percent, and far worse for a woman in her early 70's who had had cancer twice before. It wasn't that she didn't know that the biological deck was stacked against her; as someone who prided herself on her ability to grasp medical facts, she knew it only too well. In the immediate aftermath of her diagnosis, she went online to learn all she could about M.D.S. and despaired as the fact of its lethality sank in. But that despair was almost the flip side of a lifelong confidence in her ability to defy the odds. ""This time, for the first time,"" she told me, ""I don't feel special.""",2005-12-04T05:00:00+0000

I was disciplined: I never wore the clothes out of the house, and I never snipped off price tags.

Most children of poverty attend schools that focus on basic skills and test preparation. Without advocates, the potential of these children is not often realized.",2005-12-04T05:00:00+0000

us,'Ice'," To someone who lives in the temperate north, the event seems simple enough. When the air turns cold, the water in ponds and brooks, lakes, rivers, ditches, and water glasses freezes on top. If the air stays cold, the ice on top gets thicker. It may get thick enough, in lakes and ponds at least, that as the Christian knight told the disbelieving Saracen in Sir Walter Scott's novel The Talisman, a horse could carry you ""over as wide a lake as thou seest yonder spread out behind us, yet not wet one hair above his hoof."" To the Saracen, this preposterous claim was evidence that the knight belonged to a nation that loves to laugh. ""Neither the Dead Sea,"" he scoffed, ""nor any of the seven oceans which environ the earth will endure on the surface the pressure of a horse's foot."" He was misinformed; several of the Earth's seas and many thousands of its lakes and ponds can take the pressure of a horse's foot in winter, and more besides. Yet there are things that happen when a body of water turns to ice that seem almost as improbable, when you find out about them, as the knight's claim, made under a knot of palm trees by a plashing fountain, seemed to the Saracen.

Its three-week total stands at nearly $230 million, making it already one of the top-grossing movies of the year. ""Aeon Flux"" (Paramount), starring Ms. Theron and directed by Karyn Kusama (""Girlfight""), opened at No. 2 with $13.1 million. It was the only new film in wide release this weekend, but the studio did not screen it in advance for critics, so it had a one-day head start over the widely unfavorable reviews it received on Saturday. ""Walk the Line"" (Fox), the Johnny and June Carter Cash love story, dropped one spot to No. 3 with an even $10 million, bringing cumulative sales over three weeks to $68.7 million.

The museum, which housed a collection of memorabilia from Tarkovsky and Eisenstein, had been in the Kino Center, a huge building in central Moscow that was constructed in 1980's for the Soviet Filmmakers' Union, but since 1991 has been gradually taken over by casinos, restaurants and strip clubs, and also has a commercial movie theater. The director of the museum, Naum Kleiman, said earlier this year that he had been served with eviction papers, and it closed down on Thursday. ""We have to say goodbye to these quarters,"" he told the newspaper Izvestia. ""It's the past, which has now ended up in the hands of people who are strangers to film."" The Russian Filmmakers' Union last year sold its stake in the building to a company said to be linked to Nikita Mikhalkov, the Oscar-winning director and the chairman of the union, a connection that raised eyebrows in Moscow. Mr. Mikhalkov recently announced that he was taking a break from his position with the union to complete several film projects. The museum's collection is being moved to Mosfilm Studios, and is to have screenings at a government-run cultural facility, but still hopes for a new permanent home.

The W.T.O. said that its dispute-settlement body found that the method used by the United States to calculate countervailing duties against Canadian lumber was inconsistent with international trade rules. The ruling follows another by the W.T.O. in August concluding that the United States had not demonstrated that Canada subsidizes its lumber producers. Not all W.T.O. decisions have gone in Canada's favor, however. Another panel concluded last month that the laws used by the United States to impose the duties on Canadian exports meet the trade pact's terms. Ian Austen (NYT)",2005-12-06T05:00:00+0000

Among adults 18 to 49, its margin of victory was even greater: ABC's overall rating in that age group more than doubled second-place CBS's. That network had a football spillover into prime time on the East Coast, helping ""60 Minutes"" draw the most viewers from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. But the first part of CBS's ""Pope John Paul II"" movie did not fare as well. The pope tale (shown too late to obtain an exact tally of viewers) was beaten not only by ABC but also by NBC's ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" (11.81 million) and ""Crossing Jordan"" (12.44 million). NBC did not do as well with the post-sweeps return of ""The West Wing"" at 8 p.m., which brought in an audience of a mere 7.22 million. KATE AURTHUR",2005-12-06T05:00:00+0000

Haas of San Francisco. Peter was an early champion of the vision of the Skirball Cultural Center meant to explore the connections between four thousand years of Jewish heritage and the vitality of American democratic ideals. Through his active participation, he deepened his own understanding of the bridge between his Jewish heritage and that of the democratic America he loved so very much. During the past decade as a member of the Board, Peter helped refine the Skirball Cultural Center's mission and guided the Center's growth as a cultural and educational institution into the largest of its kind in the world. His commitment to the institution paralleled his dedication as a businessman, civic leader, and philanthropist to help create a more civil society for all. As a driving force in the growth of Levi Strauss & Co., his unprecedented devotion to corporate responsibility made him a role model for business leaders worldwide. His generosity to the community as a supporter of social causes helped improve the lives of millions of workers, children, and the poor.

Prosecutors charge that he falsified time sheets to claim he was working for the city when he was really working for Cicatelli, which holds city contracts for H.I.V. and AIDS programs. From 1997 to his dismissal last year, prosecutors claimed, Mr. Nolte stole $30,000 in city salary. Over the same period, they said, he made more than $100,000 from Cicatelli. Mr. Nolte, 63, was fired after a baby suffocated under a pile of toys in a city-licensed day care center in Queens. He pleaded not guilty to grand larceny and fraud. His lawyer, Elizabeth M.

O'Keeffe, who died in 1986, married Stieglitz, the photographer and art collector, in 1924 and was based in New York when she painted the cityscape. The Tennessean of Nashville reported this week that Fisk expects to raise $16 million to $20 million by selling ""Radiator Building"" and Marsden Hartley's abstract ""Painting No. 3"" (1913) and will use the money for new buildings, the university's endowment, faculty positions and security for the remaining 99 works in the 101-piece Stieglitz collection, which had remained intact for 56 years. The collection also includes works by Picasso, Toulouse-Lautrec and Czanne, is housed at the Carl Van Vechten Gallery on the Fisk campus. Within Nashville's artistic community, reaction to the sale of two of the crown jewels of the Stieglitz collection was mixed. University president Hazel O'Leary, a 1959 Fisk alumna who was President Bill Clinton's first Secretary of Energy (1993-97), told The Tennessean that the decision to sell the pieces was difficult but necessary for the private college to remain competitive. Fisk also filed court papers in Nashville to verify its legal right to sell the pieces under O'Keeffe's original deed of gift; the Tennessee attorney general, Paul Summers, has approved the sale under certain conditions, two of which are that Fisk must use its best efforts to sell the paintings to Tennessee residents, and that the buyer or buyers must assure Fisk that the public will be able to view the pieces.

Like Jasper Johns's paintings based on a standard map of the United States, they are paintings in the form of maps and not maps in the form of paintings. Measuring as large as 9 by 12 feet, the paintings are textured by innumerable hand-painted place names, laced by roads and borderlines and punctuated by all kinds of signs and symbols. Sometimes you find nongeographical information, like statistics from the last presidential election covering Gulf of Mexico waters in a map of Florida (above). Stylistically, the paintings have a zany, Outsider-like quality, though Ms. Scher is in fact a successful graphic designer whose rsum includes record album covers, a stint as art director for Time Inc. and logos for corporations and nonprofit groups. But though the Howard Finster-like navet is a sophisticated act, the paintings still look as if they were made by someone who lacks a clear grasp of the real world's geographical makeup. But then again, who does not have that chronically disoriented feeling that uncharted territories are growing at a faster rate than our ability to map them?

us,"Arts, Briefly; NBC's Novelty Beats the Repeats","For the first time in a long time, ""Law & Order"" was Wednesday's most-watched show, with an estimated audience of 12.07 million. But the episode, a typical New York story in which real estate led to murder, gained that distinction because its popular Wednesday rivals were repeats. ""Law & Order"" helped NBC garner the most viewers over all, but ABC drew the largest number of 18- to 49-year-olds. Its repeat of ""Lost"" (10.97 million) was followed by an ""Alias"" rerun (6.44 million). The spy show performed as well after ""Lost"" as it did in its Thursday time period, when it was showing new episodes. On UPN, the finale of ""America's Next Top Model,"" in which the shy and awkward Nicole Linkletter, right, was crowned the winner, brought in 6.35 million viewers.

For the last nine years, this narrow, second-story club has touted a seven-foot Baldwin with pedigree: it was the house piano at the beloved Greenwich Village club Bradley's for 18 years, and before that a possession of the alto saxophonist Paul Desmond. Another acquisition at roughly the same time -- a five-foot Yamaha that had belonged to the singer Carmen McRae -- made the Jazz Gallery one of the very few clubs in the city with two good pianos. This bounty was quickly put to practical use, with a duo series that has been a distinctive feature of Jazz Gallery programming. Next week, as part of the organization's 10th-anniversary season, the series returns with five piano pairings, each promising a slightly different chemistry. Tuesday night will feature Jason Lindner (above right) and Luis Perdomo (left), players known for percussive fluency and a command of Latin rhythm. On Wednesday, the versatile hard-bop veteran George Cables meets a highly regarded newcomer, Danny Grissett. Thursday's program pairs Orrin Evans and Gerald Clayton, who both balance traditional grounding with contemporary vision. The series will conclude with the experimentalists Amina Claudine Myers and Vijay Iyer, next Friday; and Mr. Clayton again, this time with the urbane elder Kenny Barron, Dec. 17. Before the run even begins, an uptown site, Merkin Concert Hall, will offer the latest installment of its own duet series (see Kenny Werner and Jean-Michel Pilc, below), so piano enthusiasts have something going every night next week.

New Yorkers have been able to order some out-of-state wines online or by telephone, but vineyards or businesses in other states have had to make arrangements with retailers or distributors in New York. That can drive up costs, increase delivery time and leave many wines, particularly from smaller vineyards, unavailable to New Yorkers.

A spokeswoman for the Buildings Department, Ilyse Fink, said two violations were issued to the landlord, Daniel Guaman, one for illegally converting the one-family house into a two-family dwelling, the other for installing a bathroom and a stove gas line in the basement without a permit. The maximum fine on each violation is $2,500. Juan Diaz, 27, a nephew of Mr. Guaman's, called the relatively light violations proof that housing conditions did not cause the deaths. ""Even if the house was 100 percent legal, those kids would have died because the boy was playing with a lighter,"" Mr. Diaz said. Prosecutors said they had not determined whether criminal charges would be filed. Corey Kilgannon (NYT)",2005-12-10T05:00:00+0000

us,The Rise of Illiterate Democracy,"The nonfiction best-seller lists these days are often full of partisan screeds labeling Democrats as elitist traitors and Republicans as conniving plutocrats. But look over on the fiction side, and politics appears almost nowhere. Some critics read Philip Roth's ""Plot Against America"" as an allegory of the current White House, and there have even been a few blunt and appalling political fantasies, like Nicholson Baker's ""Checkpoint,"" a brief dialogue between a man who wants to assassinate George W. Bush and a friend who wants to talk him out of it. But unlike the ubiquitous nonfiction tub-thumpers, today's novels rarely take the grubby business of ordinary politics, past or present, as a subject, let alone an activity in which their authors might participate. Contemporary party politics, which once inspired writers as different as James Fenimore Cooper, Mark Twain and Robert Penn Warren, is terra incognita. The separation of church and state is hotly contested; the separation of literature and state seems to have become absolute.",2005-12-11T05:00:00+0000

The directive grew out of a survey of the local police in which 356 departments reported that they were already using various mechanisms to keep juveniles picked up on minor violations from going to court. But 40 more departments that responded had no such programs, according to the survey, creating a disparity in the treatment of juveniles within the state. Even those that did have such programs, state investigators said, had little documentation, formal guidelines or enforcement. Officials provided no details on which communities have the programs and which do not. The guidelines direct the police to use ""station house adjustments"" that in the past have informally been in effect for youths when they are arrested for the first time for ordinance violations, petty disorderly-conduct charges and other minor infractions.",2005-12-11T05:00:00+0000

us,After the Victorians," In 1900 there was published in Vienna one of the most extraordinary and revolutionary texts ever to come from a human brain. Die Traumdeutung (The Interpretation of Dreams) expounded the theory on which all subsequent psychoanalysis was based, even or especially those psychoanalytical theories which reacted most violently against it: namely, that the human mind consists of what might be described as two layers. With the outer layer, of our conscious mind, we reason and form judgements. In reasonable, well-balanced individuals, the pains and sorrows of childhood have been worked through, put behind them. With the unhealthy, however, neurotic or hysterical individuals, there is beneath the surface of life a swirling cauldron of suppressed memories in which lurk the traumas (the Greek word for wounds) of early experiences. Under hypnosis, or in dreams, we re-enter the world of the subconscious and with the care of a helpful analyst we can sometimes revisit the scenes of our early miseries and locate the origins of our psychological difficulties. The author of this world-changing book, Dr Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), was a happily married neurologist, born in the Moravian town of Freiberg, but for most of his life resident in Vienna, hub of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where his consulting room in Berggasse 19, Vienna IX (from 1931), and his celebrated couch, on which patients lay to recite their sorrows, became a totemic emblem of the century which was to unfold. The need to return to some forgotten, irrational, dark place of our lost past became compelling, personal and collective, as the hysteria of the twentieth century reached its crescendo-point and as Dr Freud, a Jew, though a non-believing one, packed his belongings and took his family to live in London for the last year of his life, following the Anschluss, the joining together of Germany and Austria into a Great Germany, Grossdeutschland. He had already had the honour of having his books burned in Berlin in 1933, and in 1938 they were burned in Vienna. ",2005-12-11T05:00:00+0000

In October, though, Iraqis went to the polls and ratified a Constitution that committed itself with equal strength to both democracy and Islam.

At the same time, it declared Islam the basic source of law and the official religion, and it decreed that no law could contradict ""the provisions of the judgments of Islam.""

It was only after turning to journalism, ""involuntarily but gratefully,"" that he found his calling. Now a freelance writer, he has been literary editor of The Spectator and a columnist for The Sunday Telegraph. Wheatcroft's strengths are those of an ""involuntary"" writer -- of someone, that is, who set out with no particular mission or political agenda. The extent of his interests is reflected in his books, which include: ""The Randlords,"" an account of the South African mining magnates; ""The Controversy of Zion,"" about Zionism's impact on the Jewish people; and ""Le Tour: A History of the Tour de France."" And as someone who is not given to polemical flights, he is unusually common-sensical, quick to perceive when one of his subjects has failed to keep his feet on the ground. Wheatcroft brings that common sense to his Page 1 review of Robert Fisk's ""Great War for Civilisation.""

Poverty, whether stacked up or spread out, whether in the middle of a city or out in the suburbs, is corrosive and dangerous and will not go away just because the rent is a little lower. Public-housing directors miss an opportunity with every project they build or tear down.

It has been known since the mid-1990's that mutations of the MC1R gene are responsible for hair color -- and fair skin and freckles -- in about 70 percent of redheads. But when Jeffrey S. Mogil and his colleagues at McGill set out to find a genetic link to pain inhibition, MC1R wasn't at the top of their list of targets.

It's the country's ""Joy of Cooking,"" a volume given to brides on their wedding day. ""The Silver Spoon"" has now been translated into English, and the result -- a big, well-marbled slab of a cookbook -- is catching on with American readers; the book is No. 13 on this week's extended hardcover miscellaneous list, available on the Web. (The only other cookbook on that list is ""Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook,"" at No. 8.) ""The Silver Spoon"" gives good value. It weighs in at 1,263 pages and has some 2,000 recipes, but it sells for $40. It's also full of surprises -- put the cheese on your pasta before the sauce, the authors advise -- and, happily, it hasn't been stripped of its Italian character. (There are piles of recipes here for things like buck's horn plantain, hard to come by in this country.) The classics are covered back-to-front -- there are 23 risotto recipes -- but ""The Silver Spoon"" also works in some interesting margins; you'll learn three ways to cook a calf's head, and methods for making both heart and eel kabobs. The authors can be sticklers. The recipe for costata alla fiorentina begins: ""Those who wish to serve authentic Florentine T-bone steaks should follow the rules of the Articles of Association of the Florentine T-Bone Steak Academy, founded in 1991 by representatives of the Florentine Butchers' Association.""

What tidier way to show different sides of one character, explore possible life paths or test the limits of nature and nurture? Dermansky does all that, but her twins (who take turns at narrating) transcend the gimmick in a brainy, emotionally sophisticated bildungsroman-for-two. Chloe, the elder by four minutes, longs for a life of her own, independent of her clingy sister, Sue, who envies her (Chloe is an eighth of an inch taller) and thinks she's smarter and prettier. Sue adores Chloe, whose every gesture toward independence sends her into paroxysms of jealousy. On their 13th birthday, she wheedles and bullies Chloe into getting tattoos -- with each twin bearing the other twin's name. ""Sue thought tattoos would prove to the world that the bond we shared went deeper than DNA,"" Chloe explains. ""The funny thing was, the tattoos made us different. When we died, it would be easy for a forensic scientist to tell us apart. . . . After we got our tattoos, we were never really and truly the same."" Both twins are obsessive, vulnerable, ambitious and hungry for love, but these qualities take on different forms. Chloe keeps her room in perfect order, setting herself apart from her untidy sister, while Sue vomits up her meals in an effort to stay the same weight as Chloe, who intently counts her calories. Yet as they mature and their circumstances change, they find themselves swapping roles. Most teenage protagonists have to learn what it means to be themselves, but Sue and Chloe have an extra task: learning what it means to be -- or not to be -- each other.",2005-12-11T05:00:00+0000

EST at Coney Island Hospital in Coney Island, NY, from organ failure after a long bout with senile dementia. He was 86. A decorated member of the NYPD and veteran of the United States Armed Forces from 1941-1945, Mr. Alcindor received three commendations for outstanding police work as a patrolman in 1961 and then as a lieutenant in 1966 and 1978. In addition, he was awarded a medal at City Hall by New York City Mayor Abraham D. Beame. An avid musician, Mr. Alcindor brought his talents on the trombone to the New York Transit Authority Police Band, even playing at the 1962 Democratic National Convention. His musical talents also led to his involvement in one of the most famous events in U.S. history, as Mr. Alcindor was in attendance as a band member when Marilyn Monroe serenaded President John F. Kennedy with ""Happy Birthday"" at Madison Square Garden on May 19, 1962, an event, according to his son, he never forgot. Born in Brooklyn, NY, Mr. Alcindor attended Franklin K. Lane High School where he teamed with legendary Knicks coach Red Holzman on the school's handball team that captured the city championship. He followed that up by attending the Juilliard School to pursue his career ambitions of becoming a musician. Hopeful of one day playing with the Count Basie Band, Mr. Alcindor enjoyed working with some of the musical giants of his time, including Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey, Kenny Durham, Al Gray and Tito Puente. He also had a stint playing with the Benny Carter Band in the late 70's and early 80's. Married for 53 years, Mr. Alcindor's wife, Cora, passed away eight years ago.

Son of the late Rhea and Joseph T. Marder, D.D.S., Jerry was an advertising executive, real estate investor, buffalo rancher, avid Long Island fisherman, jazz buff, and family man. A former Executive Vice-President of Grey Advertising (now Grey Global), he was born in N.Y.C. in 1926.

He spent 30 years at Grey, managing accounts for clients including Macy's, Proctor & Gamble and Revlon. A pioneer in government advertising, he managed campaigns for the U.S. Navy, Joint Recruiting Advertising Program, and U.S. Department of Transportation. After his retirement in 1986, he was instrumental in the rebirth of Miami's South Beach and served on the boards of LIM and Lesley College, among others. With his brother, he built (by hand) and ran BelleAir Farms, a buffalo ranch in Northeastern PA, home of ""Buffalo Belle"" brand bison.

us,Neutered Narrative Syndrome,"Page Six points out what students of the darkened rooms have known for a while  that if you make a film that is actually about something, you might actually end up offending someone. Steven Spielbergs Munich finds itself in a seemingly endless spanking machine. Varietys critic Todd McCarthy panned the movie and now its editor, Peter Bart, hops in, saying the film takes such pains to avoid advocacy that it neuters its narrative. The Carpetbagger is familiar with Neutered Narrative syndrome and has heard that the treatment is both prolonged and painful. Mr. Bart also pipes up about Mr. Spielbergs decision to stay in the weeds rather than swan for an Oscar, and asks the eternal question of whether it is best to lay low or lobby. The question is not settled, but you get the feeling that Mr. Bart thinks a hail of For Your Consideration ads in Variety is the way to go. So what if all it does is salve your A-List star in a B-List clunker? Its all well spent.",2005-12-13T08:15:50+0000

us,A Challenge for Bill OReilly,"After Sundays column about Bushs arrival at the Pearly Gates, I thought I would be pilloried for heresy, sacrilege and who knows what else. And here and there I was.But so far Ive received fewer outraged letters and letter bombs than I had expected (the device is actually an old one: In 1516, Erasmus wrote of Pope Julius II meeting St. Peter  and being sent away). And I did hear from two prominent evangelicals who said they agreed entirely with what I wrote  they think that its absurd for the focus of religion to be boycotting Target or telling people how to greet each other, particularly when there are more urgent problems like, for example, genocide.As one put it in an email: Every time I see the Fox News Channel talking about the War on Christmas, I find myself thinking , or saying out loud, sometimes yelling, What about the War on Poverty and AIDS !?!  (and I could add genocide, trafficking, etc.) You are right on in your column today and I hope to go public soon in saying so.By the way, my main complaint isnt with Bush. As some readers noted, Bush hasnt waged the Christmas campaign, and in fact the White House Christmas cards angered some conservatives because they didnt use the word Christmas or show a religious scene. My problem with Bush is celebrating Christmas by putting up trees and holding parties, while cutting funds to stop genocide.The coverage of the war on Christmas at Fox is also about hypocrisy, but is more blatant at a time when there are so many more important things to cover. Frankly, Foxs campaign seems to me to be more about ratings than anything. Ranting gets viewers, particularly if its ranting at the usual suspects  like liberals. I just wish that Fox would send a camera crew to Darfur and cover something that genuinely violates tenets of not just Christianity but every religion. And thats genocide.So heres a challenge for Bill OReilly: If you want to do something journalistic, come along with me on my next trip to Darfur. Youll have to leave your studio and deal with people who, if they dont like you, will shoot you in a moment. But youll also have the chance to take a genuinely important and overlooked story and bring it into peoples homes. So come on, Bill. Whatll it be? More ranting from your studio? Or real journalism?",2005-12-13T15:13:32+0000

Mr. Cruz, 34, was convicted of second-degree murder last month for fatally shooting German Cabrera on a Chelsea subway platform in February. Justice Carol Berkman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said that Mr. Cabrera, 26, had to some degree provoked Mr. Cruz's anger by taunting him by telephone about the affair. But she said it would have made more sense for Mr. Cruz to be angry with his wife, since ""she was the one who was unfaithful."" Anemona Hartocollis (NYT)",2005-12-14T05:00:00+0000

Son of the late Rhea and Joseph T. Marder, D.D.S., Jerry was an advertising executive, real estate investor, buffalo rancher, avid Long Island fisherman, jazz buff, and family man. A former Executive Vice-President of Grey Advertising (now Grey Global), he was born in N.Y.C. in 1926. He attended Fieldston School, Cornell University and graduated from the Columbia Business School (1950). During WWII, he was a radio officer in the U.S. Maritime Service and U.S. Army Transport Service. He served during the Korean conflict as a 2nd Lt. in the U.S. Army. He spent 30 years at Grey, managing accounts for clients including Macy's, Proctor & Gamble and Revlon. A pioneer in government advertising, he managed campaigns for the U.S. Navy, Joint Recruiting Advertising Program, and U.S. Department of Transportation. After his retirement in 1986, he was instrumental in the rebirth of Miami's South Beach and served on the boards of LIM and Lesley College, among others. With his brother, he built (by hand) and ran BelleAir Farms, a buffalo ranch in Northeastern PA, home of ""Buffalo Belle"" brand bison. His first marriage to the late Barbara Sand Marder ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Joan Kron, the author and Allure editorat-large; son, Jonathan Marder and his partner Gregory Grimes of NYC; daughters Susan Zelouf and her husband David Zelouf, M.D., of Merion, PA and Jane Martin and her husband Matthew J.

The company canceled rehearsals on Tuesday and yesterday, but refused to sign an interim agreement proposed by the union. The company said that it had not suspended any performances and would try to resolve differences to avoid a strike. Without at least an interim agreement, Ms. Kallas said, the dancers plan to perform this morning for a group of students, but not during the evening as scheduled. Dancers are seeking a new contract with the company in an effort, they say, to protect their jobs, safety and health. Among other issues, dancers want more control over rehearsals and how management handles dismissals.

In his garish films like ""Pink Flamingoes"" and ""Hairspray,"" he has also shown a keen instinct for finding the sweet spot where rock and schlock merge in ecstatic, trashy musical expression. It should come as no surprise that his antidote for depression surrounding this season's rampant commercial greed is to revel in its excesses -- and to subvert its pieties. This year, he has put together a live musical revue inspired by the wonderfully weird songs on his new collection of scavenged holiday nuggets, ""A John Waters Christmas"" (New Line). The director himself will be on hand offering his insight and reactions to songs like a Baltimore DJ's local hit ""Fat Daddy (Is Santa Claus),"" as well as a vanity recording of ""Happy Birthday Jesus"" by someone named Little Cindy, and the novelty cut ""Santa Claus Is a Black Man"" by AKIM & the Teddy Vann Production Company. Joining Mr. Waters in his celebration are two perfect co-conspirators. The Trachtenberg Family Slideshow Players -- the father, mother and daughter act (above, from left, Tina Pia Trachtenberg, Rachel Pia Trachtenberg and Jason Trachtenberg) who are performing their own holiday send-up, from Dec.18 to Dec. 23 at Performance Space 122 -- will sprint over from that earlier gig to add their hipster family values to Mr. Waters's mix. The singer-songwriter Kimya Dawson, who, with her erstwhile band, the Moldy Peaches, used to dress in a bunny suit, has often posited the worldly wisdom of children. Aside from her own always quirky adult musings, she brings to this wacky assemblage her distinctive insight into the minds of little misfits.

us,The Listings: Dec. 16 -- Dec. 22; 'BINGO',"Over the last few years, theater producers -- especially on Broadway -- have increasingly aped their counterparts in film, adapting beloved movies, casting Hollywood stars and incorporating computer technology into their designs. But there are still some things that are considered too lowbrow for even the Great White Way. Sequels, for example. Revivals may be a theater staple, but don't ever expect to see ""Death of a Salesman II: Biff Strikes Back"" on a midtown marquee. Selling popcorn is another no-no. Despite being a profit center for the movie business, popcorn is frowned on by theater people because of its loud, crunching sound, as well as the difficulty of cleaning the kernels off the floor. But those aren't the only reasons that most producers and owners ignore this potentially lucrative concession: according to several Broadway insiders, theater would sacrifice a certain snob appeal if ticket-buyers were licking the butter off their fingertips in the middle of the second act. But some theater owners are starting slowly to change their ways. Since the beginning of the fall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music has sold popcorn in the lobby, but not allowed ticket buyers to bring it into the theater. And in the production of ""Bingo,"" an Off Broadway musical about a clique of ladies (above, from left, Liz Larsen; Liz McCartney; Janet Metz, seated; and Klea Blackhurst) dead serious about the game, every audience member receives a bag, making this otherwise forgettable show perhaps the first popcorn musical in the history of New York.

Someone is selling several personal effects of Bobby Fischer, the former world champion, on eBay. Most of the collection (one example, above), according to the list on the site, consists of chess books and magazines, many of them foreign, some of them inscribed by Mr. Fischer with his name. Also included are an original manuscript for Mr. Fischer's ""My 60 Memorable Games""; 20 small handwritten notebooks detailing the openings played by some of his top competitors; and legal papers surrounding his attempt to copyright a chess move. In all, the seller says, the trove includes about 16 cardboard boxes full of material. The minimum bid is $15,000, and at least one has been received, from the Netherlands. The auction, which started last Friday, ends on Monday. The seller said the material was bought at a flea market six years ago and evidently came from a storage locker that Mr. Fischer rented in Pasadena, Calif. The contents were seized for nonpayment of rent. Mr. Fischer went into a tirade about it several years ago in a radio interview with a Philippines radio station, saying the seizure was illegal.",2005-12-16T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: Dec. 16 -- Dec. 22; COMPOSERS AND CHOREOGRAPHERS,"Dance and music are (mostly) inextricably linked, yet students of both art forms often have little to do with one another, even when they are studying at the same school. Thirteen years ago, Juilliard decided to do something about that and asked aspiring choreographers and composers to create short works together, to be performed at a lunchtime concert, open to all, but mostly attended by students and friends. This year, the school is offering two additional free evening performances, giving a bigger audience the opportunity to find out whether another Stravinsky-Balanchine pairing is in the making. ""Music and dance are created together in every culture except ours,"" said Pia Gilbert, the music division supervisor of the project. ""What the students tend to find out is that we use some of the same means of expression, even if our instruments are quite different."" The 12 students work together for two weeks -- playing music and dancing for one another -- before pairing off. Then they spend about two months making a six-minute work. ""Six minutes is not an insignificant amount of time for students to get a real sense of how an idea can come to fruition,"" said Elizabeth Keen, the dance division overseer. Laura Careless (above with Andrew Murdock), a third-year dancer who is collaborating with Jonathan Keren, a post-graduate composition student, said: ""To work with a composer so closely has really been eye-opening. If you understand another kind of process, it can help you find ways of working that you wouldn't necessarily find on your own."" (Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Peter J.

us,The Listings: Dec. 16 -- Dec. 22; TIM BERNE'S PARAPHRASE,"There may not be a jazz musician more in tune with the notion of rugged individualism than the alto saxophonist and composer Tim Berne. More than 25 years ago, Mr. Berne released the first album on Empire, his own label. He has trafficked in the above-ground music industry since then -- recording for the Polygram imprint JMT, and, more fleetingly, Columbia Records -- but nothing seems to satisfy him more than self-reliance. Since 1996, Mr. Berne has channeled his autonomy through Screwgun Records, which he runs out of a brownstone in Brooklyn. The label faithfully mirrors its founder's ethos of hardscrabble abstraction: until recently, Screwgun CD's came in industrial brown cardboard, with graffiti-like scribbles by the graphic artist Steve Byram. ""Pre-emptive Denial,"" the label's 16th release, bears more colorful packaging but leaves the music raw; its source material was a bootleg of Mr. Berne's band Paraphrase, performing in the East Village just seven months ago. Dividing evenly into two 25-minute tracks, the album follows the sort of wide exploratory arc that has long typified Mr. Berne's compositional voice. The catch is that Paraphrase is a free-improvising trio, shaped as much by the sensibilities of Drew Gress, the bassist, and Tom Rainey, the drummer, (above left, with Mr. Berne, center, and Mr. Gress). Appearing in Mr. Berne's native Park Slope next week, the musicians will see their work supplemented with spontaneously arranged projections by Mr. Byram and another artist, Jonathon Rosen. This cross-disciplinary experiment could succeed or fail; either way, it should jibe with Mr. Berne's intrepid ideals. (Wednesday at 8 and 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. www.screwgunrecords.com)",2005-12-16T05:00:00+0000

Thousands of fans, some from as far away as Florida and Ohio and many who had to get out of bed by 4 a.m. even to get near the stage, drank, cheered and waved worshipful signs despite a cold drizzle. Bound for Sirius Satellite Radio, Mr. Stern addressed his fans for the last half-hour of his show, before the festivities moved to the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, which was surrounded by a phalanx of 20-something men spilling out into the street and trying to get a glimpse of the self-described King of All Media as he arrived atop a double-decker bus. Martha Stewart, who also has a show on Sirius, introduced Mr. Stern. The move to Sirius takes Mr. Stern outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, which has levied more than $2 million in decency fines on his old bosses at Infinity Broadcasting and the stations that carry his program.

Dozens of villagers used pails to collect the fork-tailed drongos, which range through much of sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, in preparation for ""feasting on mysterious manna from heaven,"" Wilfred Lipita, the country's director of animal health, was quoted as saying in news reports. A Malawi newspaper, The Nation, reported that one resident was found with 700 of the birds and that one dead bird appeared to have been banded in Israel. Officials warned residents not to eat the birds because of the risk that the flu virus might be present. In most of the human cases reported in Asia, the disease was contracted while preparing fowl for slaughter or by handling infected birds.

Things took a surprising turn in the very last moment of the show: Donald Trump asked Mr. Pinkett whether he thought Rebecca Jarvis, the other competitor, should also be hired, and Mr. Pinkett said no. The audience booed, and the show was over, although a heated debate about Mr. Pinkett and Ms. Jarvis continues on Internet message boards. The two-hour episode drew 12.85 million viewers, which was a season high for this installment of the series. Compared with last season's two editions, however, the ratings for this conclusion were down in double-digit percentages. But with CBS in repeats, NBC was able to score a rare Thursday win in the 18-to-49 demographic for the night. In total viewers, CBS won: reruns of ""CSI"" (17.68 million) and ""Without a Trace"" (15.06 million) drew larger audiences than ""The Apprentice"" in every half-hour from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. KATE AURTHUR",2005-12-17T05:00:00+0000

A lightning rod for attention even before it opened, the film has earned plaudits from critics' groups along with predictable sneers, and provoked argument over its gay bona fides. That ""Brokeback"" is a landmark is a matter of empiricism; its merits as a work of art are a matter of taste. What has gone missing is that this is also that rare American film that seamlessly breaches the divide between the political and the personal, the past and the present. Here, against the backdrop of the great American West, that mythic territory of rugged individualism and the Marlboro Man, is a quietly devastating look at masculinity and its discontents.

The city was quiet, the streets soft with the heat. It was the summer of the dress code battle between the tourists and the guards at St. Peter's Basilica. The tourists wanted to wear shorts and halter tops; this was in violation of the Vatican dress code (slacks, shirts with sleeves), and the guards wouldn't let them in. There were arguments at the entrance, and angry words. Soon a Roman compromise was achieved: No one lost face; everyone got what they needed. The vendors in St. Peter's Square were allowed to sell paper shirts and pants for a euro apiece. The tourists would put them on over their clothes, walk past the guards, and tear the paper off as they entered the dark cool of the church. ",2005-12-18T05:00:00+0000

""The Beatles: The Biography,"" by Bob Spitz, lands at No. 15 on the hardcover nonfiction list, while ""John Paul the Great,"" Peggy Noonan's breezy remembrance of that pope, climbs to No. 21 on the extended list. Spitz's account charts the trajectory of John, Paul, George and Ringo from their bleak Liverpudlian boyhoods through dazzling superstardom and their ultimate breakup. It's actually one of a whole shelf of Beatles books out now, albeit the only on the list. Most of the others are about Lennon, 25 years after his murder. ""John,"" by Cynthia Lennon, who was married to the Beatle from 1962 to 1969, paints the picture of a man wounded by the deaths of family and friends, and tells the difficult story of the domestic front during Beatlemania. ""If there is to be a balanced picture of Dad's life, then Mum's side of the story is long overdue,"" Julian Lennon, the couple's son, writes in the foreword.

The unexamined life may not be worth living, but it can be worth reading about -- especially if it takes place at 740 Park Avenue, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. In a sprawling book brimming with detail about the building's ashlar-patterned Indiana limestone facade, co-op board and mortgage interest, and yet stingy on insights into its inhabitants, a group that has included Jacqueline Bouvier, John D. Rockefeller Jr., Saul Steinberg, Henry R. Kravis and Ronald O. Perelman, Gross tells the story of a building ""conceived in 1929 as the most expensive, the most exclusive, simply the best apartment house in the world."" Gross, who has written for New York magazine and Vanity Fair, describes how 740 went from a 1930 co-op to a 1936 rental building and then back to a co-op in 1953, and throws in gobs of real estate porn: descriptions of winding marble staircases, marble-floored vestibules and, best of all, huge, untrammeled living space. Non-New Yorkers might glaze over at his Genesis-like recitation of quickie marriages, offspring and Reno divorces of dozens, if not hundreds, of the building's residents, ranging from Marshall Field III to Jerzy Kosinski, who wrote ""The Painted Bird"" while living there. And even sophisticated New Yorkers may balk at the way Gross covers emotional terrain (one divorce becomes ""inevitable,"" he writes casually, when money runs low). Finally, the book's thematic organization -- ""Old Money,"" ""Oil Money,"" ""New Money,"" ""Borrowed Money"" and ""Other People's Money"" -- precludes a narrative flow, as Gross skips frantically across the decades.",2005-12-18T05:00:00+0000

That ""Brokeback"" is a landmark is a matter of empiricism; its merits as a work of art are a matter of taste. What has gone missing is that this is also that rare American film that seamlessly breaches the divide between the political and the personal, the past and the present.

Pigment tests and scientific analyses of the illustrated manuscript have revealed that the illustrations of A.D. 586 were repainted after it entered the Medicis' Laurentian Library in the 16th century, where it remains today. The oversized book, originally produced in a Syrian monastery, includes the first dated pictorial representation of the Crucifixion. Tests revealed, among other things, that in the repainting, Jesus's curly red hair was restyled as black and straight. The findings were presented at a conference this month at the Max Planck Institute organized by Gerhard Wolf, director of the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence, and Massimo Bernab, who teaches at the University of Pavia, in Italy. Mr. Bernab said the discovery would force scholars to re-evaluate this significant monument of early Christian art and subsequent attitudes toward it. ELISABETTA POVOLEDO",2005-12-19T05:00:00+0000

In Nielsen estimates, CBS was No. 1 in total viewers by a large margin; a new episode of ""Cold Case"" at 8 p.m. was the most-watched program of the night, with 15.29 million viewers. But Fox attracted the 18-to-49-year-olds on Sunday. Its spillover of the Washington Redskins' slaughter of the Dallas Cowboys began the night with a victory in that demographic, and Fox never gave up its lead. From 7 to 10 p.m., the network won every half-hour among adults 18 to 49: ""The Simpsons"" was its highest-rated entertainment program. NBC placed fourth for the night in both total viewers and 18-to-49-year-olds. In place of ""The West Wing"" at 8 p.m. was a Tom Brokaw special about soldiers from the Iraq war. It fared even worse than the political drama usually does during that hour, drawing only 6.04 million viewers.

Prosecutors said that writings were found on him when he was arrested indicating that he had been aware of a nationwide search for him since the assault. He was charged with aggravated assault and carrying a weapon onto school property, but those charges were dropped after he waived extradition to face charges that include sex abuse, robbery, burglary, arson and kidnapping. He is accused of posing as a firefighter so he could attack the Chelsea woman. MATTHEW SWEENEY (NYT)",2005-12-20T05:00:00+0000

The translator, Noureddine Malki, 46, was surrounded by federal marshals during a brief proceeding before Chief Judge Edward R. Korman of Federal District Court.

A noted specialist in foreign banking and securities law, he represented government-owned and private European, Asian and Latin American banks and companies, as well as helped usher in commercial relations between the United States and Germany. He was fundamental to the establishment in New York of many foreign banks, including the Bank of China and Credit Anstalt. Mr. Gruson was a pioneer in international law, and helped inaugurate Shearman & Sterling's German practice. He was very instrumental in developing the firm's foreign associate program in which many well-known lawyers and business executives participated, including the General Counsel of the Frankfurt stock exchange. Born in 1936 in Berlin, Mr. Gruson received his legal education in Germany (University of Mainz, Freie Universitat, Berlin, Dr. Jur. 1966), and in the United States (Columbia University, MCL; LLB). He joined Shearman & Sterling in 1965 and was elected to partnership in 1973. A respected academic, he was the author and co-author of several seminal books in international banking and lectured widely. He was a visiting fellow at numerous international universities.

A few months later, however, the Nassau County district attorney, Denis Dillon, announced that he would retry Mr. Kogut. Mr. Dillon has not said whether he will seek retrials of the other two men, John Restivo and Dennis Halstead. ""Justice was finally done after 20 years,"" said Paul Casteleiro, Mr. Kogut's lawyer.

According to a civil case that is winding down in Los Angeles Superior Court, a pair of good seats for the Oscars, which have a face value of $700, went for as much as $40,000 this year and could cost up to $60,000 for next year's event, which takes place on March 5. In the case, which pitted the academy against various ticket brokers who allegedly sold or tried to sell tickets to the Oscars, an investigator for the academy who solicited tickets was told by a broker he should consider: ""a pair of Oscar tickets ($30K) total. For a little more, they could turn this into a once-in-a-lifetime experience that they will both cherish forever. Also, please note that the price will increase significantly next year, probably to $30K per person."" The academy has reached a negotiated settlement with most of the defendants and will be sending out a letter, as it does every year, reminding them and others that Oscar tickets may be used only by the lucky few who actually are eligible to receive them.

One of the more vivid slams on its prospects  he sets some kind of record for use of boxing metaphors in a single item  comes from Jeffrey Wells at Hollywood Elsewhere. Its funny, and effective, but once you jump down the hobbit hole of Oscar prognostications as the Carpetbagger has, you find out that there is no end to the deconstruction and analysis. He will be in need of serious deprogramming by the time the actual awards roll around in March, including spending a month with dial-up access only and some really good books from the Western canon to regain parts of his I.Q. Lets skip the Pride & Prejudice (or any other Jane Austen) just to speed the process. (For those who are interested, Wells suggests in our comments section that the Carpetbagger has tagged him as a terrorist. Thats just plain silly.

His wife and daughter think Timothy Treadwell is an absolute freak and that the Carpetbagger needs to let go of his inner-bear, but we cant stop looking. Whatever happened to those cute little foxes, anyway. And History of Violence continues to creep up the list. As the supposed prohibitive favorites pick up ack-ack of one kind or another, David Cronenbergs look at the downside of redemption starts to look pretty damn smart.

There are a few hardy souls, and one windy one in particular, but for the most part, its a little quiet in here. Perhaps its because the Carpetbagger has dubbed some of the contributors Rugrats. Maybe I need to think of another honorific, something that clearly communicates the heft and interests of our contributors, something like  Baggies. Send thoughts about that if you have them. So anyway, Zimmergirl, a sassy contributor, who admits that she didnt read the Carpetbaggers prolix missive from yesterday about scalpers and the Oscars, sounded as if she wouldnt go if she were paid. She has a friend  dont we all? who went to the Oscars and it did not go well: She had to sit up in the nosebleeds (there really arent nosebleeds at the Kodak) and her only comment from the entire night (it was a disappointing Oscar ceremony where the worst possible film won, nothing new there) was that Julia Roberts has a weird nose.

Brokeback, the first gay romance to make a bid for mainstream respectability, has already won the top awards handed out by critics in New York and Los Angeles and copped seven nominations for the January 16 Golden Globes, often a key indicator as to which way the Oscar wind might be blowing, the story says. There is a reminder down low in the story that Munich must not be counted out and of course, the caveat remains that many early leaders in past Oscar races came up lame before the finish line. Like many, the Carpetbagger is exceedingly fond of Brokeback Mountain  he held hands with a friend during some of the more rugged parts, but that was just in the spirit of male bonding  but wonders whether the demographics of the Academy, which skew toward the ancient, will accommodate a full-on, smack-on-the-lips cowboy love story.

Once they were there, however, they had to convert part of the money back to animals so that they could be sacrificed, because the tithe had to be animals and first fruits, not money.

us,The Listings: Dec. 23 - Dec. 29; FELIX SCHRAMM: 'COMBER',"Destruction and creation have long gone hand in hand in modern art, sometimes indistinguishably, as in Jean Tinguely's self-destroying machine from 1960 called ""Homage to New York."" A recent entrant to the destruction-creation field is Felix Schramm, a young German sculptor whose large environmental sculptures made of lumber, drywall, paint and other Home Depot-type materials give the impression that part of a house has undergone some violent calamity. For his first New York solo exhibition, Mr. Schramm has produced a room-filling, tilting and disheveled configuration of walls and corners (above). It looks as though parts of an existing house had been ripped off, mixed up and slammed into the gallery by a passing tornado or -- as the title, ""Comber,"" suggests -- by an ocean wave. The effect is viscerally physical and art-historically resonant. Cubism, Kurt Schwitters's ""Merzbau,"" Gordon Matta-Clark's architectural deconstructions and the junk sculptures of John Chamberlain and Nancy Rubins all come to mind. There is no obvious narrative or symbolic intention, but because Mr. Schramm uses the forms and materials of vernacular residential construction, his installation can't help but call to mind real-world anxieties about threats to our safety -- political, meteorological, seismic and otherwise. The home is no longer a protective haven from the unpredictable flux of modernity and neither is the art gallery. It is impressive that Mr. Schramm achieves all this not by acts of real destruction or deconstruction but by carefully calibrated design and assembly.

us,The Listings: Dec. 23 - Dec. 29; 'ECLIPSE: VISIONS OF THE CRESCENT AND THE CROSS',"Abdel R. Salaam came to dance almost accidentally as a student and athlete at Lehman College in the 1970's. But it didn't take him long to ponder why his college dance teacher talked about the predictability of black students like Mr. Salaam recycling Alvin Ailey in their choreography classes. Why then, he wondered, was it permissible for white students to redo Twyla Tharp? Mr. Salaam likes to think about what lies behind accepted truths. Twenty years ago he founded a company, Forces of Nature, that blended traditional West African and modern dance in distinctive ways, well before that choreographic technique became fashionable. The lithe, stretched bodies of late-20th-century modern dance surged through dance that told the stories of the creation of the world and of black American myths, with intensity and an appreciation for the power of ritual. Now, he and his vibrant company will tackle the historical and cultural conflicts and confluences, as he puts it, of Christianity and Islam in ""Eclipse: Visions of the Crescent and the Cross""(above). Mr. Salaam, who has described himself as ""an ecumenical Muslim,"" combines ballet, hip-hop, martial-arts techniques and even Irish dancing with his more familiar African-contemporary mix in the new work, a journey that begins with the ancient Moors and winds its way through history up to the teaching of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. The score ranges from music by M'bemba Bangoura and Paul Winter, with whom his troupe has performed, to Gregorian chants and Islamic prayers. And the list of guest artists leading the multiracial cast reads like a Who's Who of black modern-dance performers, among them Sarita Allen, Dyane Harvey and Nathan Trice. (Forces of Nature will present the premiere of ""Eclipse: Visions of the Crescent and the Cross"" on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at Aaron Davis Hall, City College, 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100, www.forcesofnature.org; $25 to $45.)",2005-12-23T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: Dec. 23 - Dec. 29; ROY HARGROVE BIG BAND,"Of all the young musicians to emerge during jazz's major-label prospecting boom of the late 1980's and early 90's, few have stayed in the game like the trumpeter Roy Hargrove. Since his discovery by Wynton Marsalis in 1987, Mr. Hargrove, above, has ranked among his generation's leading proponents of hard bop, with fruitful detours into symphonic strings, Cuban groove and neo-soul. He caused a minor stir in 2003 with the RH Factor, an electric project trafficking in soul, gospel and R & B, along with a sprinkling of organic hip-hop; the group's debut, ""Hard Groove"" (Verve), featured guest turns by the singers D'Angelo and Erykah Badu and the rappers Q-Tip and Common. At the same time, Mr. Hargrove toured in a postbop band with the pianist Herbie Hancock and the saxophonist Michael Brecker, and he never stopped working with his longstanding acoustic quintet. If it all suggests a double life, that's not far off the mark: Mr. Hargrove's forthcoming album, ""Reflections and Distractions,"" will feature one disc of hard bop and another of RH Factor groove. (The album is scheduled for release in late-February on Verve.) Next week Mr. Hargrove will bring his sharp and assertive trumpet playing, along with his less heralded arranging skills, to yet another ensemble: a 17-piece big band stocked with colleagues like the saxophonist Ron Blake, the trumpeter Darren Barrett and the drummer Greg Hutchinson. The setting will lend the engagement a historical tone -- Mr. Hargrove first convened his big band 10 years ago in the space that is now the Jazz Gallery -- but the music should leave nostalgia behind. (Wednesday through Dec. 30 at 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $25.)",2005-12-23T05:00:00+0000

And Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly hands Spielberg a big fat A, calling the film a thriller that seeps into your central nervous system. According to Slates David Edelstein, Munich is the most potent, the most vital, the best movie of the year.

us,For Your Manipulation,"In myriad ads offered For Your Consideration  and the Carpetbaggers, incidentally, who channels as a member of the Academy to inhabit the collective mind of that body  George Clooney is offered as a candidate for best supporting actor in Syriana. As my colleague Ed Wyatt pointed out after seeing the movie, who exactly is he supposed to be secondary to? The movie opens on his surprisingly beefy mug and balances on his shoulders for much of the rest of the way. Yes, it is a movie that has an ensemble that is played through a prismatic narrative, but in acting terms  give or take a smashing Matt Damon assist  the movie belongs to him. Let us stipulate that Mr. Clooney is a Good Guy who makes Wonderful Movies about Important Topics. Yes, he is a triple-threat wonder this year who will be doing laps to the podium, but what, beyond studio artifice, has him competing in a supporting role? Call it the Traffic effect. Benicio Del Toro, a leading mans leading man, won best supporting actor in 2000 because he was pitched that way. Now the Carpetbagger was born at night, but not last night, so he knows that the awards are subject to the wiles of marketing and manipulation, but heres hoping that Clooney gets his due for writing, producing, and directing more quality in a single year than most filmmakers accomplish in a lifetime. And if the Academy is just going damp in the pants to give gorgeous George a supporting nod, why not give it to him for his turn as Fred Friendly in Good Night, and Good Luck, where he ably and honorably supported his star, David Strathairn?

The company had also planned March performances at the Joyce Theater in New York. The dancers' union, the American Guild of Musical Artists, said it had filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the ballet with the National Labor Relations Board, seeking a reinstatement of the dancers' work schedule. The decision to eliminate the shows came one week after the ballet canceled its production of ""The Nutcracker,"" which was expected to make enough money to help finance the 2006-7 season.

It was the nineteenth-century equivalent of a flat tire, except this was the winter of 1926. The Whites had no money. They were moving from the high desert chill of Las Animas, Colorado, to Littlefield, Texas, south of Amarillo, to start anew. Bam White was a ranch hand, a lover of horses and empty skies, at a time when the cowboy was becoming a museum piece in Texas and an icon in Hollywood. Within a year, Charles Lindbergh would cross the ocean in his monoplane, and a white man in blackface would speak from the screen of a motion picture show. The great ranches had been fenced, platted, subdivided, upturned, and were going out to city builders, oil drillers, and sodbusters. The least-populated part of Texas was open for business and riding high in the Roaring Twenties. Overnight, new towns were rising, bustling with banks, opera houses, electric streetlights, and restaurants serving seafood sent by train from Galveston. With his handlebar mustache, bowlegs, and raisin-skinned face, Bam White was a man high-centered in the wrong century. The plan was to get to Littlefield, where the winters were not as bad as Colorado, and see if one of the new fancy-pantsers might need a ranch hand with a quick mind.

The thing is, it all happened so fast, was over practically before it began, that we can almost be forgiven for misconstruing her as a cultural simulacrum: a blip on the monitor, a media invention, an adorable incarnation of a feminine ideal of the reluctant or unwitting nymphet, rather than a flesh-and-blood creature with needs and wishes (not to mention raging demons) of her own. The lightning speed with which Sandra Dee was first heralded and then discarded may have been just another example of the ""now you see her, now you don't"" phenomenon endemic to the fever-dream of Hollywood, but it also suggests the dark ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" side of the American manufacture of celebrity -- the ruthlessness that drives it and the despair it feeds off. She went from being discovered in 1956, at 12, to winning a Golden Globe Award in 1958, to being hailed by The Motion Picture Herald in 1959 as the ""Number One Star of Tomorrow,"" based on her promising pigtailed debut in the sterling weepie ""Until They Sail"" as well as her performance in ""The Reluctant Debutante.""

The interesting thing about Hunter has never been his soporific movies, like ""Island of Desire"" or ""Lust in the Dust,"" or even his treacly 1957 hit single, ""Young Love."" It's himself. In his memoir, Hunter provides a mesmerizing account of his Candide-like journey through Hollywood. Never a gifted actor, Hunter, who grew up in Southern California, rode his all-American looks to a seven-year studio contract with Warner Brothers, which signed him up at age 23 and transformed him almost overnight into a teeny-bopper idol. The twist, of course, was that Hunter, like any number of Hollywood leading men, was gay. He soon chafed under a rigid studio system that seemed designed to wring any lingering vestiges of spontaneity out of filmmakers and actors, though it had some advantages. It offered not only a steady salary, but protection from scurrilous rags like Confidential magazine, which sought to out the stars of the day. Hunter offers shrewd assessments of the studio moguls Jack Warner and Harry Cohn, as well as hilarious anecdotes about working with Natalie Wood, Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner. After Warner Brothers cut him loose, Hunter's career stalled, but how sorry can you feel for someone who was whizzing around Capri and hanging out with Ingrid Bergman in his mid-20's? His foray into Tinseltown's past should help revive his name, but not, one suspects, his films.",2005-12-25T05:00:00+0000

His last No. 1 was ""To Make You Feel My Love,"" which reached the top of the Billboard country chart in 1998. Mr. Brooks, left,, has released more than 25 singles since then, many of which failed to crack the Billboard Top 40. That's a marked contrast to the beginning of his career: he racked up 13 No. 1 singles from 1989 to 1993. Billboard and Radio & Records, the leading radio trade papers, calculate country singles charts based on the number of times songs are played the previous week at reporting stations, with a weighting system based on each station's market size. On Billboard's Dec. 31 country singles chart, ""Good Ride Cowboy"" is No. 3 with a bullet, meaning it has had a big increase in radio plays.

Hungary had been pressing for the return of the books, and a Russian government council had advised the culture ministry to return them, the news agency RIA Novosti reported. The 134 books, taken from the Sarospatak College of the Hungarian Reformist Church, are among countless paintings, archives and other items taken as trophy art from Germany and Eastern Europe. They have been kept in Nizhny Novgorod, a city where numerous paintings that once belonged to Jews living in Hungary are also held. The Duma must take another vote on the bill next year, but that is considered a formality. A number of stolen cultural treasures were also returned to Russia last week. The Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB, presented Patriarch Aleksy II of the Russian Orthodox Church with 74 icons from the 18th and 19th centuries that had been smuggled out of Russia and were seized in a joint operation with agents from Cyprus.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   WITTING, CHRIS J.","WITTING--Chris J. A pioneer in the early days of television, business executive, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and community leader, died peacefully at his home in Syracuse, NY on December 19. He was 90 years old. Witting retired as chairman, chief executive officer, and director of the CrouseHinds Company (now known as Cooper Crouse-Hinds) in 1982. Under his leadership, beginning in 1965, annual sales at Crouse-Hinds grew from $50 million to almost $900 million, and the company became listed on the Fortune 500. New product introductions and acquisitions over the years helped to transform the modest electrical equipment firm into the world leader in aviation lighting products in the mid-70s, with subsidiaries in South America, Europe and Australia. Witting was known for his belief in the power of individuals and positive thinking. His management style was to empower his employees, delegating responsibility and giving them every incentive to improve their skills and advance. He was often quoted as saying, ""Everyone should be Number One in something. It doesn't matter what that is. Since you spend most of your life working, you may as well be the best in your field."" A firm believer in the importance of giving back to the community, he was both an industry and civic leader. He served as president of the Manufacturers Association of Syracuse, chairman of the board of trustees of Syracuse University, and a member, board member, and director of numerous other groups, including the Everson Museum, Metropolitan Development Association of Syracuse and Central New York, and Syracuse Symphony Orchestra. In 1973 the Syracuse Herald-American named him ""Man of the Year."" His contributions were recognized with numerous awards. He held honorary degrees from Clarkson College, LeMoyne College, and Syracuse University. In 1996, Representative James T. Walsh (N.Y.) paid him tribute in Congress, calling him ""a true civic leader, a man who has not only led the way for manufacturing interests in Central New York, but has touched the lives of thousands of his fellow citizens with his philanthropy, his counsel, and his encouragement."" Witting began his career as a public accountant at Price Waterhouse in New York City. He worked his way through college, earning a B.S. from NYU in 1941. That same year, Price Waterhouse assigned him to Camp Shows USA (later USO Camp Shows), for which he directed all financial work as treasurer and comptroller. During his tenure as executive vice president, Camp Shows had 10,000 entertainers working in all areas where servicemen and women were stationed during World War II. A leading figure in the early years of television, Witting developed the Allen B. Dumont organization from a six-man group to 800 personnel, operating wholly owned stations in New York, Pittsburgh, and Washington, DC, as well as a TV network relationship in 58 cities. Dumont became the first commercial operating television network in the country, with regularly scheduled news broadcast from Washington, DC to New York City. Witting is credited with having brought Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Jackie Gleason, Dennis James, and Bishop Sheen to network TV. He left Dumont in 1953 to become president of the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. While he was at Westinghouse Broadcasting, every Westinghouse radio and TV station was rated number one in its market. Witting later joined the parent company in Pittsburgh, as group vice president in charge of the electronic components and consumer products divisions. In 1964 he moved to the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. (ITT) in New York City, serving as second in command to the president and chairman, Harold Geneen. At ITT Witting directed the world headquarters marketing, manufacturing, and technical activities, as well as two subsidiaries, ITT Export Corp. and Distributed Products Co. He remained active long after his 1982 retirement, operating his own investment company. He devoted his efforts to helping others achieve business success, not only investing in local companies, but also endowing the Witting Chair in Entrepreneurship at Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management. Throughout his long life, Witting enjoyed the outdoors, camping, hiking, and doing chores on his property. Nearly every day he rose before dawn to go jogging, accompanied by one of his beloved dogs, no matter what the weather. For some 35 years he made sure that family members stayed close by hosting an annual reunion at his home for the extended Witting clan, who traveled from all parts of the country to be there. He also maintained a cottage in New Jersey for use by his family. It was a Sears house that he built himself after returning from Europe at the end of World War II. He is survived by his devoted wife, Marshia (Pullman) Witting, sons Leland Witting and Chris Witting Jr., daughters Anne W. Kuhn and Nancy Witting, seven grandchildren, and five greatgrandchildren. He was predeceased by his first wife, Grace (Orrok) Witting, and his brother, Nicholas Witting Jr. Funeral services private. Burial St. Mary's Cemetery, DeWitt. There are no calling hours.

Nielsen will now have a live viewing total, along with a second total representing those who watched a show the day it was recorded and, beginning in early January, those who watched within a week. First-day glitches in the new system delayed the compilations too long for inclusion here, but the more traditional methods showed that for the last broadcast of ""Monday Night Football,"" above, on ABC, viewers were ready for some football. With little competition, ABC easily won on Monday night in both total viewers and the 18-to-49 demographic. On Saturday night, NBC's annual broadcast of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" on Christmas Eve (4.4 million viewers) was good enough for only third place.

Constance Keene was a treasured member of our family of Steinway Artists for fiftytwo years. Early in her career she was proclaimed an exceptional interpreter of Rachmaninoff, and with her success in the Naumburg Competition of 1943 her career was launched. She appeared in recital, in duo recital with Abram Chasins, to whom she was married from 1949 until his death in 1987, and with the leading orchestras of the day. Ms. Keene was a featured participant in Steinway & Sons' Centennial concert at Carnegie Hall in 1953. An acclaimed teacher at the Manhattan School of Music, Ms. Keene was also an indefatigable traveler, serving on juries of the major piano competitions and conducting master classes around the globe. Our fond memories of Constance will continue to enrich us, as will her recordings and the artistry of her celebrated pupils. We convey our love and heartfelt condolences to her husband Milton.

Today, after difficult adjustments to globalization and the precipitous devaluation of the peso from around 3 to the dollar to nearly 11 over 12 years - often cited as a cause for a spike in crimes like kidnapping and robbery - the city remains a teeming, vibrant and joyful place.

MICHAEL WHITE'S ORIGINAL LIBERTY JAZZ BAND,"When the clock strikes 12 tomorrow night, it will mean the end of a year that most New Orleans natives would rather forget. But forgetting isn't common practice in that city, especially where culture is concerned; many of its best and brightest were haunted by history well before Hurricane Katrina raised the stakes. In the early 1960's, one such individual, the tuba-playing jazz advocate Allan Jaffe, formed the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, an ensemble trafficking in New Orleans jazz and stocked with veteran musicians. Now under the stewardship of the trumpeter John Brunious, a lifelong member, and the bassist Ben Jaffe, who upholds his father's mission, the band has been touring almost incessantly since being displaced. This week's Jazz Standard engagement culminates in a New Year's Eve package, complete with barbecue dinner and Champagne toast. Across town, Champagne and New Orleans polyphony will also pour forth at the Village Vanguard, where the Original Liberty Jazz Band has played more than a dozen New Year's Eve engagements over the years. This year's installment will be more poignant than most, of course: although the musicians all survived Katrina, the band's clarinetist and leader, Dr. Michael White, a prominent historian and scholar of New Orleans culture at Xavier University of Louisiana, suffered the incalculable loss of his collection of antique instruments, documents and rare recordings. A tinge of defiance will accompany the jubilation of the music, which serves not only to usher in a new year but also to highlight the process of renewal that jazz, at its best, is all about. (The Preservation Hall Jazz Band plays tonight at 8, 10 and 11:45, and tomorrow at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $35; $125 to $175 tomorrow, including a three-course dinner.

Get there early for a good seat or reserve a table, but avoid the front row unless you are willing to bear the brunt of Murray Hill's leers and merciless one-liners.

The Godfather of Soul spent the first part of 2005 recovering from prostate surgery and fielding lingering questions about his much publicized 2004 marital strife and domestic abuse problems. It was reality TV fodder all the way. Now, this hard-living 73-year-old reportedly has in the works both a ""Ray""-like biopic and a documentary (produced by his wife, Tomi Rae) called ""Life on the Road With Mr. and Mrs. Brown."" If his legendary stage show has lost some of its kinetic kick -- those legs don't shuffle and split as they used to -- Mr. Brown's huff and growl are as percussive as ever. His band still freezes and blares at the slightest signal from its leader, and he still falls to his knees as the spirit dictates. Shows in recent years have included overenthusiastic dancers, as well as a drooping sequence in which Mrs. Brown wails a few Janis Joplinesque numbers. The rhinestone-bedecked main attraction may stick stubbornly to his biggest hits, but who can argue with a searing rendition of ""It's a Man's World,"" a buoyant ""I Feel Good"" or a stripped-down ""Sex Machine""? The pleading showstopper ""Please, Please, Please"" seems to be a live rarity now, but maybe the mood will strike. For his part, Mr. Brown knows that among other achievements, he continues to be the most sampled man in the rap biz. To trade on his legacy, all he needs to do is to keep making it funky and, of course, stay on the scene.

The House of Steinway & Sons deeply mourns the passing of the eminent American pianist Constance Keene, in New York City on December 24, 2005 at the age of 84. Constance Keene was a treasured member of our family of Steinway Artists for fiftytwo years. Early in her career she was proclaimed an exceptional interpreter of Rachmaninoff, and with her success in the Naumburg Competition of 1943 her career was launched. She appeared in recital, in duo recital with Abram Chasins, to whom she was married from 1949 until his death in 1987, and with the leading orchestras of the day. Ms. Keene was a featured participant in Steinway & Sons' Centennial concert at Carnegie Hall in 1953. An acclaimed teacher at the Manhattan School of Music, Ms. Keene was also an indefatigable traveler, serving on juries of the major piano competitions and conducting master classes around the globe. Our fond memories of Constance will continue to enrich us, as will her recordings and the artistry of her celebrated pupils. We convey our love and heartfelt condolences to her husband Milton.

us,36 Hours in Mexico City,"WHEN the Spaniards arrived in the Valley of Mexico in the 16th century, they found the sprawling Aztec city of Tenochtitln, destroyed it and built a new one on top of it. But they never really succeeded in burying the past. Mexico City became the largest city in the Western Hemisphere, a nexus of Latin American art and political thought. Today, after difficult adjustments to globalization and the precipitous devaluation of the peso from around 3 to the dollar to nearly 11 over 12 years -- often cited as a cause for a spike in crimes like kidnapping and robbery -- the city remains a teeming, vibrant and joyful place. Even the skies are blue again because of new laws that restrict auto use. Despite all the layers time has imposed, from the colonial past to the present day of ""nuevo cine Mexicano"" and ""techno-rave en Espaol,"" even a weekend visitor will still feel the spirit of the old Aztec capital ever present alongside the new.

us,Closing Time; Iskandariya,"It was not a scorpion I asked for, I asked for a fish, but maybe God misheard my request, maybe God thought I said not ""some sort of fish,"" but a ""scorpion fish,"" a request he would surely have granted, being a goodly God, but then he forgot the ""fish"" attached to the ""scorpion"" (because God, too, forgets, everything forgets); so instead of an edible fish, any small fish, sweet or sour, or even the grotesque buffoonery of the striped scorpion fish, crowned with spines and followed by many tails, a veritable sideshow of a fish; instead of these, I was given an insect, a peculiar prehistoric creature, part lobster, part spider, part bell-ringer, part son of a fallen star, something like a disfigured armored dog, not a thing you can eat, or even take on a meaningful walk, so ugly is it, so stiffly does it step, as if on ice, freezing again and again in mid-air like a listening ear, and then scuttling backwards or leaping madly forward, its deadly tail doing a St. Vitus jig. God gave me a scorpion, a venomous creature, to be sure, a bug with the bite of Cleopatra's asp, but not, as I soon found out, despite the dark gossip, a lover of violence or a hater of men. In truth, it is shy, the scorpion, a creature with eight eyes and almost no sight, who shuns the daylight, and is driven mad by fire, who favors the lonely spot, and feeds on nothing much, and only throws out its poison barb when backed against a wall -- a thing like me, but not the thing I asked for, a thing, by accident or design, I am now attached to. And so I draw the curtains, and so I lay out strange dishes, and so I step softly, and so I do not speak, and only twice, in many years, have I been stung, both times because, unthinking, I let in the terrible light. And sometimes now, when I watch the scorpion sleep, I see how fine he is, how rare, this creature called Lung Book or Mortal Book because of his strange organs of breath. His lungs are holes in his body, which open and close. And inside the holes are stiffened membranes, arranged like the pages of a book -- imagine that! And when the holes open, the pages rise up and unfold, and the blood that circles through them touches the air, and by this bath of air the blood is made pure . . . He is a house of books, my shy scorpion, carrying in his belly all the perishable manuscripts -- a little mirror of the library at Alexandria, which burned.",2005-12-31T05:00:00+0000
