us,Books of The Times,"In 1972, the linguistics specialist J. L. Dillard published an important and provocative book called Black English: Its History and Usage in the United States. In it he argued persuasively that what appears to the speaker of Standard English to be bad English spawned by ignorance and cultural deprivation is actually a language with its own coherent grammatical structure, capable of generating a range of expressions just as complex and sophisticated as any other tongue, including Standard English. Now, in AllAmerican English: A History of the English Language in America, Professor Dillard attempts to broaden the gauge of his analysis. He argues, in the spirit of H. L. Mencken, that American English is a language distinct from British English  a language that had already undergone a sea change by the time the Mayflower colonists reached these shores, and a language that has continued to be transformed throughout American history by contact with tongues that British English never encountered in its native setting. But unhappily, Professor Dillard's new thesis doesn't quite support a book of the length of AllAmerican English (which is onethird notes and bibliography in any case). It looks a little like Son of Black English, with details and anecdotes to pad it out. And a somewhat sickly offspring at that.",1975-05-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Antonioni's First:'Story of Love Affair' in Comeback at 25,"The years haven't been kind to ""Story of a Love Affair"" (""Crnanca Di Un Amore""), Michelangelo Antonioni's first feature, made in 1950, but they have at least given it historical importance in view of the highly personal, hugely better films he made afterward, from ""L'Avventura"" to ""The Passenger.""With hindsight one can see here, the beginning of a style that this idiosyncratic Italian Marxist would go on to develop into what became virtually a genre all its ownthe film about people disconnected from each other and the world around them. I doubt that if we saw ""Story of a Love Affair"" today, without the benefit of hindsight, we would do much more than snicker between extended yawns.The story and much of Mr. Antonioni's treatment of it recall the kind glossy soap-opera movie that was immensely popular in Europe a quarter of a century ago, before Europeans discovered the edifying joys of television drama. It's about the impossible love of a poor auto salesman (Massimo Girotti) and his former sweetheart (Lucia Bose), who has married a rich Milan textile manufacturer and moved bag and baggage into the upper classes, where she's lonely but very happy to be over-dressed.The pair, who had earlier parted full of guilt when they did nothing to prevent the accidental death of Mr. Girotti's fiance, are reunited, first in fear, then in love, when Miss Bose's husband starts looking into her past. The fact that the affair is renewed as a result of the husband's groundless suspicions is an irony that is not to be taken lightly in a film that is completely without intentional humor.""Story of a Love Affair,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Studio, has a number of easily identifiable Antonioni moments, some quite fine, such as the scene in which the lovers are reunited after seven years, and another, photographed in the stairwell of an office building, when the pair ascend from one floor to the next only to reach an absolute impasse in their relationship. The trouble with the film is not that their problems are mini. To paraphrase Claude Chabrol, there are no small problems, only small films. In a better movie we might be able to take seriously Miss Bose's inability to cast aside her life of luxury, and Mr. Girotti's inability to see her for the bore she is. But ""Story of a Love Affair"" is tacky. It seems to share Miss Bose's fascination for high society, which, as shown in the movie, means playing bridge all afternoon and throwing fur coats on floors.The Cast",1975-05-01T05:00:00+0000

In a way, it seems even more startling than women's sexual freedom did when that first broke into print. In the light of the morning atter, it did not seem extraordi nary that women could write, and feel, about sex with as much detachment as men did. But for a woman to take to the road, not hitchhiking but pushing a cart all across Ohio, a female Don Quixote with a 4yearold daughter for her Sancho Panzathis is really a radical departure. Emma Benson, the heroine of Diane Vreuls's Are We There Yet?, is one of that tribe of women who have set up housekeeping squarely in the center of despair and somehow seem to thrive in it.

When this was part of Colonel Edward R.

She asked if it was true. On April 20, magnesium and sulfur were referred to as trace elements used in minute quantities by plants and the use of Epsom salts was not recommended. Dr. Norman J. Curtis, an agronomist caught our error and makes this correction. He writes, Magnesium and sulphur are major elements for both plants and animals. Magnesium is the only mineral found as the core of chlorophyll. Magnesium Is low in soils in some parts of New York State, including the area around Gloversville. Sulfur is necessary for the assimilation of nitrogen. The use of Epsom salts does hasten ripening and improved flavor If the soil is low in magnesium.

But The Notebooks of David Ignatow, his working journal and a rude chart of the poet's course, is no song of triumph. It is, instead, one long litany of despair, a bitter jeremiad against the work he is compelled to do, the unrelenting cruelty of his father, the obligations of wife and family and the frustrations of trying to write in an unsympathetic environment.

The legendary mistral wind from the north blows frequently, but the natives complain about it snore than visitors, who find the dry air pleasant. The region's poet laureate, whose name was Mistral, called Provence the empire of the sun. It was a Greek colony, then Rome's first province outside. Italy, hence its name.

Mount Ararat, which is in eastern Turkey, rises to 16,946 feet, but it is some 870 miles from the nearest point on the canal. A simple trigonometric exercise reveals that at that distance any surface feature less than about 500,000 feet high would lie below the horizon. The writer probably had in mind the impressive emergence of Mount Sinai in the Sinai peninsula as one approaches or departs from the canal through the Gulf of Suez. Perhaps the local legend that Mount Sinai, rather than Mount Ararat, was the true landing site of Noah's Ark contributed to the cofusion.",1975-05-04T05:00:00+0000

If I'd scored, I would've been a hero, he said to himself, staring into the darkness beyond the bus window. If, if, if. He's still staring. During the National Hockey League season, Thore Robert Nystrom, born in Sweden, raised in Kamloops, British Columbia, lionized in the Nassau Coliseum, with flowing blond hair, black eyebrows and a scarred square jaw, led the Islanders with 27 goals. But in 13 playoff games against the New York Rangers, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Flyers, the 22yearold right wing has taken 41 shots without scoring. That might or might not be a Stanley Cup record. But thankfully, the N.H.L. hasn't yet turned a computer loose in its dusty archives. Thankfully for all those people who really don't care.

us,'Day of Locust' Turns Dross Into Gold,"Detail: A middle-aged man, coatless, sits in a canvas deck chair in a small, untended garden. It is hot and sunny but not really bright. The man stares at a large lizard, which stares back. When an orange falls from a tree, the noise it makes as it hits the ground suggests that the earth deep within is hollow.Detail: A young woman, whose blonde prettiness is drugstore chic, watches the movie screen with the rapt attention of someone expecting a miracle. Suddenly she sees herself on the screen, transformed, as one of a group of harem girls in old Baghdad. For a brief moment she is the center of everything. Then it's over. Says the young woman to her escorts as she leaves, the movie theater: ""They ruined it.""Detail: A cockfight in a suburban garage late at night. One of the handlers, a middle-aged dwarf, picks up his bleeding, dazed bird. He strokes it. He licks the blood from its neck. Tenderly. Then he sends it back into the ring to be butchered.Detail: An androgynous child of, perhaps, 12, with peroxide hair, dressed in short, Buster Brown pants and shirt, knocks on a window to get the attention of the man within. The man turns. The child does a grotesque imitation of Mae West's ""Come up and see me sometime.""The place is Los Angeles in the late nineteen-thirties, when the Hollywood movie studios were booming and when California was still the promised land, filling up daily with more and more young hopefuls, with aging con arttists, with Okies, the old and the ill who wanted to die in the sun. It is the setting for the huge, in many ways remarkable film that John Schlesinger has made from Nathanael West's small, classic novel, ""The Day of the Locust.""""The Day of the Locust,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema 1, is less a conventional film than it is a gargantuan panorama, a spectacle that illustrates West's dispassionate prose with a fidelity to detail more often found in a gimcracky Biblical epic than in something that so relentlessly ridicules American civilization.In its scope, in its fascination with second-rateness as a way of life, in the boldness with which it dwells on shabby details, the film reminds me of murals that used to turn up from time to time in early Franklin D. Roosevelt-era post offices. Having been commissioned by the Works Progress Administration, furious, politically committed artists would produce views of American life that seemed to eat away at the walls of the buildings meant to contain them.""The Day of the Locust"" is like this. It is a Hollywood epic that uses Hollywood sleaziness as a metaphor for nothing less than the Decline of the West. The movie is far from subtle, but it doesn't matter. It seems that much more material was shot than could be easily fitted into the movie, even at 144 minutes.Its narrative focus is uncertain. Are we seeing the story through the eyes of Mr. Schlesinger, the film's director, or of Tod Hackett (William Atherton), the young Yale graduate and apprentice scenic designer who moves through the film participating in events but not doing much about them? What Tod doesn't see, Mr. Schlesinger doesn't hesitate to show us. The film's pivot, Homer Smith (Donald Sutherland), a creepy, sexually repressed accountant from the Middle West, remains a mysterious cartoon of a character throughout.Yet the film works without wasting time on these usual psychological underpinnings, in the way that mural art can. It is reality projected as fantasy. Its grossnessits bigger-than-life quality  is so much a part of its style (and what West was writing about) that one respects the extravagances, the almost lunatic scale on which Mr. Schlesinger has filmed its key sequences: a soundstage disaster (when a set representing the Waterloo battlefiefd collapses during the filming of the film within), and the climactic riot, when a Hollywood premiere turns into an event on the order of the Crucifixion.In such a panoramic movie the performers have a way of being reduced to being the functions of the director and the screenwriter (Waldo Salt). The characters don't change. They don't become something else during the course of the film. They already are what they always will be. This is tough on actors, but Mr. Schlesinger has used this beautifully, with one possible exception.This is a movie that has been ideally cast as much as it is actedby Mr. Sutherland, Mr. Atherton, Burgess Meredith (as a rummy old vaudeville hoofer), Geraldine Page (though her sequence is superfluous), Jackie Haley (as the androgynous child) and Billy Barty (as a mean-tempered dwarf). Only the figure of Karen Black, playing the bit-player, the tough, doomed to-fail aspirant to stardom, softens the film with something like pathos.""The Day of the Locust"" doesn't need it.",1975-05-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Witty Lynn Redgrave Spices 'Happy Hooker',"""The Happy Hooker,"" which arrived yesterday at the Plaza and other theaters, is not to be confused with ""The Life and Times of Xaviera Hollander,"" the pornography film that played the World Theater some months ago. ""The Happy Hooker"" is not pornographic.The movie is a cheerily amoral New York comedy about greed and lust in the land of opportunity. It's based on the book of the same name by Miss Hollander, who was once named Secretary of the Year in her native Netherlands and then went on to become one of Manhattan's most successful madams, written in collaboration with Robin Moore and Yvonne Dunleavy.In the title role the film has the enormously talented Lynn Redgrave slim, chic and irrepressibly comic as a young woman who strides confidently up the primrose path to wealth and ill fame.I haven't read the book, so I have no idea how the movie's Xaviera compares with the original. I suspect that this one is the result of the happy collaboration of Miss Redgrave, William Richert (the producer of ""Derby""), who wrote the screenplay, and Nicholas Sgarro, who directed the film. Individually and collectively they've had the good sense to put on instead of put down.Miss Redgrave's Xaviera isn't one to fret about bygones or missed opportunities. She has the resilience of Little Orphan Annie with none of the fabricated innocence. She's a woman who always listens to herself. Early in her career, when a man she thinks she loves walks out on her, leaving her with an envelope full of large bills, she says the hoary old obligatory line rather huffily: ""You make me feel like a whore."" As soon as she has said it, however, you are aware that she realizes, with wickedly shrewd self-perception, that this is her call in life.Moralists may object to the fact that the film steers carefully clear of any of the seamier aspects of big-time prostitution. We are given the impression that Xaviera refused to pay for police protection and that she did so because of her scruples. When thrown in the overnight lockup with a bunch of tough streetwalkers, Xaviera's girls are as shocked as debutantes forced to hitchhike to the ball.""The Happy Hooker"" doesn't deny degradation so much as it airily ignores it in the interests of comedy.The film, which never quite gets around to Xaviera's deportation from this country in 1972, is told in flashbacks cued by her arrest and arraignment for running her brothel. Her memories are uncluttered by feelings of remorse. At one point she tells us with Miss Redgrave's touch for comic solemnity: ""True. I'd gotten myself into a business that wasn't very romantic, but because I liked it, I was able to bring something special to it.""Mr. Sgarro has brought something special to the film by surrounding Miss Redgrave with some of New York's best actors, including Elizabeth Wilson, Lovelady Powell, Nicholas Pryor, Tom Poston, Conrad Janis and Trish Hawkins, with an assist from abroad by Jean-Pierre Aumont. Among other things, the film is a fine advertisement for local talent.Having been derived from such unlikely subject matter, ""The Happy Hooker"" is doubley surprising. It's a witty work. Lynn's mother and father need not be embarrassed.",1975-05-09T05:00:00+0000

When we first see him, in and behind the opening credits of the French film ""The Secret."" David is strapped to an operating table and water is dripping onto his forehead with maddening regularity. David is being tortured. By whom? What for?The suspense is terrific for approximately seven and a half minutes. After that you may want to make a rude noise or ask for your money back.""The Secret,"" which opened yesterday at the Paris Theater, proves that anybody, including Robert Enrico, who directed this film, can come up with a promising beginning for a suspense melodrama. It's the middles and the ends that cause all the problems.""The Secret"" is the sort of movie that arbitrarily withholds information. It also depends on its characters to make unlikely, possibly lunatic decisions to string out the running time.Furthermore, it leaves its actors high and dry, looking totally foolish. In addition to Mr. Trintignant, these include Philippe Noiret and Marlene Jobert, who play a married couple that befriend the possibly crazy David. They hide him in their country house near Carcassonne. They give him a gun with which he can better terrorize them, in between those moments when his pathetic story of conspiracy prompts them to attain new heights of idiotic charity.Like most people who go to movies, I'm as willing as the next person to suspend belief.

The American composer's recent works, such as Ancient Voices of Children and the Makrokosmos series for amplified piano, have been greeted in rhapsodic terms not often applied to modern music. To Eric Salzman, writing in Stereo Review. Crumb's works add up to some of the most poetic and atmospheric music written in this century. The New Yorker's Andrew Porter was bowled over, like just about everyone else. Alan Rich confessed in New York magazine, after hearing Pierre Boulez lead the New York Philharmonic Ancient Voices: I'm not sure mere words on paper can explain why Crumb's music makes sense; but it remains for me as powerful and moving contemporary creation as I know. Over and over, in comments on the music, a few significant words keep turning up: poetic, atmospheric, mysterious, evocative. Harold C. Schonberg summed it up The Times: In recent years George Crumb has been talked about, and praised, more than any other composer of the American avantgarde. Although Crumb takes the stance of mystical poet rather than scientist, he has become a pivotal influence in American musical development during a period when scienceor at least the apparatus of sciencehas lorded it over art and intimidated many artists.",1975-05-11T05:00:00+0000

Christina Stead is best known here for The Man Who Loved Children, a book which rocks on the torrential conversation of its hero. Her huge tale of a Paris bankinghouse, the recently reprinted House of All Nations, accumulates in telegraphic sentences, like one enormous financial communique. In her other hooks the style is clear 19thcentury England, as a gifted Australian might still hear it sounding across the waters to a broader continentrambling but precise, baroque with ideas but never obscure in the expression of them, and never mincing into the wrong poetry. Yet in all her work them are two alternative voices, the one a cataract carrying everything before or, as some think, a massive garrulitythe other witty, tender or caustic in the small way, shyly interpolated, even exquisite. This latest novel, brief as it is, raises the same questions as the big ones. And the same answers. Why is Stead's originality so hard to define? Because there's so much of it.

Since then she has painted unceasingly and exhibited regularly. Her work has been reproduced in books, magazines and newspapers without recess even during the years when other prominent figurative painters of her generation vanished beneath the tide of American abstraction. Critics who have found their greatest pleasure in mutilating the corpse of the American tradition Isabel Bishop stands for, have given her their respect not because longevity has placed her in the position of grande dame of American painting but because the seriousness of her art could not be dismissed even when figurative painting seemed most demod.",1975-05-11T05:00:00+0000

One infers from it that her book will examine the creative work of women, and define what it is that makes their poems, their novels, their paintings recognizably female quite apart from any clues offered by the subject matter. Such recognition we know can take place. Dickens spotted instantly that George Eliot's Scenes of Clerical Life was the work not of the pottering old clergyman suggested by George Henry Lewes but of a woman. He supported his opinion with a few reasons, but clearly what heand only he for some considerable time  had spotted was the female imagination.

But with all respect to the research on the historic background of the bloodsucking undead, this ""Dracula"" is more scholarly than chilling and hardly a competitor of the late Bela Lugosi and other ersatz Draculas.""In Search of Dracula,"" according to the film's distributors, was produced and directed by Calvin Floyd, an American working in Sweden. With the aid of Christopher Leethe Dracula of a succession of British-made adaptations of the legendas the off-screen narrator and on-screen Dracula, the film courses through Dracula country in Transylvania, Rumania, Hungary and Germany to trace authentic sites and Dracula facts and folklore. Bram Stoker, in case you did not know, never set foot in Transylvania; bat fears and worship date back to antiquity, and the prototype for Dracula was Prince Vlad, a 15th-century Transylvanian who delighted in impaling his enemies with such cruelty that he was stamped a vampire.There are contemporary fiends too, including the German who was the model for the film ""M,"" starring Peter Lorre.A cinema aspect is added to the current somber proceedings by excerpts from other vintage films such as F. W. Murnau's 1921 version of Dracula, ""Nosferatu""; the 1930 Bela Lugosi ""Dracula"" and a couple of silent films featuring, respectively, Mr. Lugosi and Lila Lee, and that noted vamp, Theda Bara.As a veteran ""Dracula,"" Christopher Lee is menacing in brief impersonations of the vampire and the vicious Vlad and in intoning varied facts and hearsay about stakes through heart, sex, religion and the real Dracula castle. ""There are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamed in your philosophy,"" he warns classically.

The Catskill Mountains cover about 4,280 square miles in four New York State counties  Sullivan, Ulster, Greene and Delaware. Included in the region is the 232,423acre Catskill Forest Preserve with its magnificent scenery. Because of the Catskills' abundance of hiking and horseback trails, creeks and rivers for fishing, historic sites and campgrounds, small inns and guesthouses, a visitor need never even go near the de luxe resorts that have for so long helped make these mountains one of the most popular recreation areas in the East. On the other hand, no guest at the big resorts ever has to leave them for want of something to do, for on the grounds of these selfcontained enclaves are such enticements as 24houraday tennis, outdoor and indoor swimming pools, badminton courts, walking trails, pitchandputt greens and golf courses. They lavish on their guests three sizable meals a day and lots of entertainment, with TV and movie stars performing in onthepremises nightclubs. At one time the large resorts in the southern Catskills catered almost entirely to the Jewish trade, but this has changed. Americans of all ethnic and religious backgrounds now flock to the large hotels, one reason being that their extensive facilities attract conventions and the conventioneers come back to vacation with their families. Many of these resorts offer free camp activities for children, who are kept busy while their parents play elsewhere.",1975-05-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Popeye Doyle:'French Connection II' Is Very Different,"Popeye Doyle is not dead. He's alive and treacherously hooked on heroin and pursuing drug dealers (on foot, pantingly) through Marseilles in ""French Connection II,"" John Frankenheimer's fairly stylish spinoff from Billy Friedkin's enormously successful 1971 original, ""The French Connection.""Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle, the hard-nosed, quick-tempered, narrow-minded New York police officer, was just about the only identifiable human amid all the spectacular wreckage in the first film.Popeye hasn't gone soft or genteel in ""French Connection II."" If anything, he appears to have become a bit more of a magnificent boor as he charges around the Marseilles waterfront, belting a lot of the bad guys (as well as a few of the good ones by mistake), wondering dimly why no one understands good English and behaving, in general, like an upper-class Frenchman's nightmare of an American tourist run amok.Although the producers of ""French Connection II"" would like to emphasize that this is an entirely new film, with no real connection to the first one, they aren't above associating the two through the title and the use of the central character, whose individuality depends more on Mr. Hackman than it does on the material supplied by the screenwriters.The two films are exceedingly different The Friedkin picture was as much a hallucinogenic portrait of life in that New York half world shared by the police and criminals as it was a superior suspense melodrama. ""French Connection II"" is nowhere near so complex, though it's still entertaining.In these further adventures of Popeye Doyle, the American detective is the entire subject of the film. Marseilles, its inhabitants and its ways of life provide the exotic backgrounds and raw materials for the movie's various specialty numbers, principally chases in which Popeye and his French counterparts attempt to nab drugdom's Mr. Big, the character played by Fernando Rey, who disappeared at the end of ""The French Connection.""The concerns of ""French Connection II"" are not much different from those of old Saturday-afternoon movie serials that used to place their supermen in jeopardy and then figure ways of getting them out. The difference is in the quality of the supermen and in their predicaments.Popeye is a colorful and interesting  though hardly noble  character, and when the Marseilles drug people kidnap him, forcibly create a heroin habit in him, and then release him, you have a very special kind of jeopardy that the film and Mr. Hackman exploit most effectively. The perverse intensity and the anguish in these sequences recall some of Mr. Frankenheimer's best work in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Seconds.""The supporting cast includes Bernard Fresson, as Popeye's worried French associate, and Cathleen Nesbitt, as an ancient charwoman in the hotel where Popeye is held prisoner. In one brief, beautiful scene, the old woman, herself a ravaged addict, tenderly advises the drugged American not to rave and shout, while at the same time she is stealing his watch.",1975-05-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Nichols's 'Fortune' Is Old-Time Farce,"Though it is set in the nineteen-twenties, Mike Nichols's very funny, manically scatterbrained new movie, ""The Fortune,"" is an epic version of those old two-reel comedies that I associate with Saturday afternoon moviegoing in the thirties, with stars like the Three Stooges, Vera Vague, Ernest Truex and Charlie Chase.It's a marvelous attempt to recreate a kind of farce that, with the notable exceptions of a handful of films by Blake Edwards and Billy Wilder, disappeared after World War II.The characters in ""The Fortune"" are motivated by greed first and lust second, usually when it's inconvenient. They think big but act small, often the victims of their own short tempers. Nobody is permanently injuredneither physically, by going to sea in a leaky trunk, nor emotionally, by learning that one's lover has been plotting murder all the while.""The Fortune,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet, has the short focus and the comic self-absorption of two-reelers in which all of the world's problems might be reduced to the difficulties inherent in moving a piano from one room to another.Nicky (Warren Beatty), who uses mounds of Vaseline on his hair and wears a Ramon Novarro mustache, and Oscar (Jack Nicholson), a failed embezzler who often looks like one of the Stooges, are attempting something much more grand than piano-moving, though they are always interrupted by problems as petty as a doorway that's too narrow.In the screenplay by Adrien Joyce, which is less important as a coherent narrative than as the frame for a collection of comedy routines. Nicky and Oscar are out to separate Fredericka Quintessa Bigard (Stockard Channing), known to them as ""the mouse-bed heiress, from her family and then from her money. This involves Oscar's marrying her (because Nicky, who is supposed to be her lover, is already married to someone who remains a long distance off-screen) and then transporting her from New York to Los Angeles, where the pair attempts to murder her.Farces about attempted murder can be a little bit nervous-making when the intended victim is as appealing as Miss Channing, a Nichols discovery of major importance. She's a fine-grained, robust, comic talent who keeps the film in proper balance by being just as intently lunatic as her two co-stars.Miss Channing's Freddie, speaking in a horsy, upper-crust accent, delivers lines filched from True Romances with a gravity that's as funny as anything in the film. ""The scales have dropped from my eyes,"" she says primly as she listens to Nicky and Oscar fighting over her future inheritance. Or, with a deep sigh as the two men ignore her to pursue some other minor point: ""Je n'existe pas.""Mr. Beatty's role is less flamboyant than Mr. Nicholson's, but he plays straight with determined comedy style. Mr. Nicholson is nothing short of superb, being the obligatorily dense member of the con-artist team, the sort of man who, after being arrested for a murder he doesn't realize he hasn't committed, immediately adopts police jargon to oblige his captors. ""Then,"" he says helpfully, ""we carried the victim out of the house and put her in the pond,"" which happens to be a bird bath.Though it's only 95 minutes long, which is virtually a short subject these days, ""The Fortune"" does have sequences that sag, and there are moments when it's obvious that farce is not exactly the native art of any of the people involved. One occasionally is aware of the tremendous effort that has gone into a particular effect, though that doesn't spoil it for me. The endeavor is nobly conceived in an era that has just about abandoned farce in favor of parody, satire, situation and/or wise-crack comedy, all of which Mr. Nichols already can do withperhapstoo great an ease. ""The Fortune"" will probably be compared to ""The Sting,"" because of the overlapping of the eras and the con-man theme. Incorrectly, though. ""The Sting"" is an adventure. ""The Fortune"" is farce of a rare order.",1975-05-21T05:00:00+0000

Jonathan agrees so that he can buy a newly ""hot"" Pissarro and receive Internal Revenue Service approval of all the other stolen masterpieces in his private collection.Jonathan isn't above murder-for-pay or underwriting art thieves but he draws the line when a pretty student offers to sleep with him in order to get a B-minus in his course. Jonathan is that sort of guy: vaguely scrupulous.""The Eiger Sanction"" is full of people with divided loyalties and peculiar names that recall the somewhat fresher inventions of Ian Fleming. It moves around this country and in Switzerland as if it had a Eurailpass good for the world. I suspect that one shouldn't inspect the plot too closely, but it passes so quickly most of the time you don't notice it.One of the film's two major sequences is set in the American West, where Jonathan goes to freshen up his mountain climbing techniques and where he murders an old enemy by leaving him to starve in the middle of Monument Valley. This is patently silly. Everybody knows you couldn't starve to death in Monument Valley. You'd be rescued before sunset by a Hollywood movie crew.The other major sequenceand it's a stunning one if you've been able to sit through everything elseis an attempt to scale a Swiss mountain peak known as the Eiger. Jonathan has gone on the climb because one of the other members of the expedition is the second assassin he's after. Which one is it? He doesn't know but you can possibly guess by reading the cast list carefully. What is more important than mystery is the spectacle of the climb, which looks difficult and very beautiful.The rest of the movie is the kind of tongue-in-cheek nonsense that Mr. Eastwood, who also directed the film, laboriously intended. Supporting the star are George Kennedy, as an old mountain-climbing buddy who calls Jonathan ""old buddy"" all the time: Vonetta McGee, as Jonathan's black girlfriend who also hustles as a courier, and Jack Cassidy, as a swishy courier who owns a dog called Faggot.",1975-05-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Distraction Stalks Inspector Clouseau,"In Paris, Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers), illustrious hero of ""The Pink Panther"" and ""A Shot in the Dark,"" pounds the pavement as a common gendarme. Demoted, Kicked downstairs. Stripped of his prerogatives to interfere with the more important affairs of justice. But talent will out.Strolling one day along an avenue on his beat, Clouseau comes upon a blind organ grinder and his monkey outside a bank. Clouseau has a long and profoundly solemn exchange with the organ grinder about the business arrangements the man has with the monkey (or ""minkey,"" as Clouseau pronounces it).All the while, through the bank window, we witness the hold-up that Clouseau, with his usual preoccupation with the nonessential, doesn't see. When the bank manager runs out to the sidewalk calling for help, he's the one that Clouseau clubs, not the organ grinder who was, of course, the lookout.Blake Edwards's ""The Return of the Pink Panther"" brings back Inspector Clouseau in the superbly awkward figure of Peter Sellersriding, walking, falling, driving, slipping and stumbling to success. His dignity is challenged from time to time, but his faith in his nonexistent deductive powers remains unshaken.Clouseau is the very special slapstick triumph of Mr. Sellers and Mr. Edwards. He's not stupid in any ordinary sense. He simply allows himself to be too easily distracted by details of secondary importance. He's like a child who has just learned to read. No set of instructions on an aspirin botle would be without interest to him.When Clouseau is at hand, innocent objects become potential weapons of destruction, often his own. It has something to do with the intensity of his distraction. You can imagine him getting fatally entangled in a ball of yarn.""The Return of the Pink Panther"" is not to be muddled with ""Inspector Clouseau,"" the feeble Bud Yorkin spinoff with Alan Arkin in the title role, made in 1968. It is, rather, a glorious throwback to the two 1964 Sellers-Edwards collaborations. ""The Pink Panther"" and ""A Shot in the Dark.""""The Return of the Pink Panther,"" which opened yesterday at three theaters, is again introduced by the marvelous Richard Williams cartoon character who upstages all of the title credits and is, in effect, everything that Clouseau is not  urbane, witty, sly, quick-witted, graceful.When Clouseau suavely salutes a passing lady by raising his billy club, he misses his hat and hits his eye. This time Clouseau is saved from the injuries that can be suffered on the street by the disappearance of the fabled Pink Panther diamond, the national treasure of the emerging, mythical Middle Eastern country of Lugash. They are the same diamond and the same country that Clouseau saved in the first film.Should you want to analyze the screenplay by Frank Waldman and Mr. Edwards, which probably isn't wise, you'd find it bears a distinct likeness to Alfred Hitchcock's ""To Catch a Thief."" Clouseau is called in to solve the new theft by the grateful government of Lugash, while the prime suspect, Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the retired jewel thief, joins the case to clear his name. Sir Charles, known as the notorious Phantom, is repeatedly referred to by Clouseau as Sir Charles Phantom, the notorious Litton.Somewhat complicating matters are the presences of Clouseau's superior, Chief Inspector Dreyfus, hilariously played by Herbert Lom with the fury of the demonically possessed; Sir Charles's wife, Claudine (Catherine Schell), who seems to be enjoying herself no matter how outrageous the circumstances of the slapstick, and Cato (Burt Kwouk). Clouseau's Oriental servant, who sometimes hides in the refrigerator, the better to surprise his employer with an unexpected karate chop.The screenplay is funny but even better are the sight gags that are a kind of inventory of everything Clouseau has been unable to master in his long, irrelevant career  monkeys, magnifying glasses, vacuum cleaners, sauna baths, door bells, dance floors, false mustaches, kneehole desks and four-wheeled vehicles, all kinds and models.When Clouseau takes the wheel, the vehicle is inclined to balk, like a donkey, or to give up, to fall apart, as if suddenly stricken with an acute case of engine fatigue.",1975-05-22T05:00:00+0000

us,"Movie:'Cornbread,' an Urban Tragedy, Arrives","""Cornbread, Earl and Me,"" which opened yesterday at the Penthouse, 59th Street Twin II and 86th Street Twin II theaters, is so much a tract for virtue that a feeling of guilt becomes inescapable in pointing out its shortcomings as a movie.After all, it's not every day that we get films that persist in extolling truth and decency even while making a bloody display of the unfairness of life. And judging by the warm-weather fare of the recent past, it isn't likely that this spring and summer will offer too many films that  like ""Cornbread""can appeal to youngsters on a wholesome ethical plane while telling a story that bears some resemblance to life, and death, on real city streets.Part urban tragedy, part courtroom melodrama, ""Cornbread"" is the story of Cornbread Hamilton a black teenage basketball star about to leave his less-than-ideal neighborhood for college and obviously destined for a big-money professional career. The boy, however, is shot down by the police, who are pursuing an apparent psychopath, who has just left a woman all but dead.It's an all-too-familiar case, one in which the patrolmen involved  one white, one black  speak of something shiny, perhaps a gun, in the running youngster's hand. And it is one in which police superiors bring very real pressures to bear on adults and children in an effort to make certain that no contradictory evidence is offered after Cornbread's parents retain a lawyer to clear their dead son's name.Inasmuch as this is a movie that reinforces one's commitment to truth-telling, it must now be said that what detracts from it is a certain unevenness in the acting and a slapdash air about the climactic inquest that contrasts unfavorably with the careful and occasionally slow-moving construction of the early part of the film.Making his movie debut as Cornbread is Keith Wilkes, a pleasant personality but unlikely to win as an actor the accolade that he has just won for his feats with the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Associationrookie of the year.",1975-05-22T05:00:00+0000

""Lepke,"" which opened yesterday at the Loews State 2 and Cine Theaters, covers most of Lepke's life, from the delinquent years of his adolescence in Brooklyn through the delinquent years of his adulthood in Brooklyn, as the head of the outfit called Murder, Inc.The cast of characters includes such other ""name"" hoods of the nineteen-thirties as Lucky Luciano, Albert Anastasia and Kid Twist Reles, all of whom have turned up in earlier, better gangster films. This one is different only in that it gives the Jewish side of the underworld story.""Lepke"" was produced and directed by Menahem Golan, the Israeli film maker (""Kazablan""), mostly in and around Los Angeles. A mature Tony Curtis plays Lepke as well as the limited concerns of the screenplay allow. Vaughn Meader, the impressionist once so closely identified with the Kennedy-era Camelot, appears briefly as the late Walter Winchell, while Milton Berle plays Lepke's father-in-law, a man who apparently puts on old-man make-up in the morning the way some women wear lipstick and eyeshadow.
