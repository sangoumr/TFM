Revolutionary changes have occurred in all these areas, and the introduction of new medications is only one aspect. Yet Freud's ""Standard Edition"" appears to remain the lifeblood of psychoanalysis. The new dynamics of psychiatry, based firmly in medicine, can only improve our capacity as physicians to reduce suffering and heal the ills, if not the souls, of our patients. WILLIAM G.

It is encouraging to see that, when the quality of one's final days -- as depicted by Blackwood's recollection of her wedding -- is potentially high, a few months can provide a lifetime of fond memories to a loved one.

Wisely, Michael Olmert, in THE SMITHSONIAN BOOK OF BOOKS (Smithsonian, $45), does not try. He provides, instead, an amiable summary of some of the more remarkable events in the history of the written word, beginning with the earliest examples of writing (produced in the Middle East, in the fourth millennium B.C., on clay tablets) and concluding with the profound impact of computer technology on publishing and reading. ""The book as we know it,"" Mr. Olmert notes, ""is pushing its 2,000th birthday,"" having taken its present form in Rome when someone first folded sheets of papyrus into a semblance of pages. For much of its history the book has been a handmade object, often a work of art, as many of the reproductions here demonstrate -- of early Middle Eastern and Far Eastern religious texts, glowing pages from the Irish Book of Kells and majestic 15th-century Bibles, including Gutenberg's 1455 masterwork. Mr. Olmert, a magazine journalist, is particularly fascinating in describing the impact of the printing press in Europe, the lives of the first printers and designers and the phenomenal growth of the industry: between 1455 and 1500 a staggering 10 million copies of books were printed. But finally the book is most affecting not in its summaries but in its incidentals, such as the wonderful description by James Boswell of Samuel Johnson, sitting at the dinner table with a book ""wrapped in the table-cloth . . . from an avidity to have one entertainment in readiness, when he should have finished another.""

Quebec Makes 'Em Quiver The Quebec Nordiques, perennial Adams Division doormats, moved into first place last night when Andrei Kovalenko connected on an overtime goal to give the Nor diques a 3-2 victory over the Bruins in Boston. Kovalenko got his 15th goal of the season at 1 minute 35 seconds of overtime. Claude Lapointe passed from the left boards to the left side of the slot, where Kovalenko one-timed a 30-footer to the left of goalie John Blue. The Nordiques, 6-1 in their last seven games, have 54 points, a point more than Montreal. They had just 52 all last season. Boston, 1-5 in its last six games, had its seven-game unbeaten string against the Nordiques broken. (AP) North Stars 6, Penguins 3: Ulf Dahlen scored three goals and Russ Courtnall added two more as Minnesota, taking advantage of the absence of Mario Lemieux, defeated the Penguins on Pittsburgh ice. Dahlen registered his third career hat trick and the first by a North Star in 41 games this season. On Wednesday night, Lemieux left Pittsburgh's game against Boston in the second period, complaining of a stiff back. He has since been ordered by doctors to rest his back until Jan. 25, and last night he watched from a private box as the Penguins' six-game unbeaten streak came to an end.

Dineen notched the Flyers' first goal at 5:43 of the first period off a scramble in front. Dineen had just two goals in his previous 20 games and 2 points in his last eight contests. His hat trick last night leaves him with 11 goals for the season. (AP) Blues 3, Flames 2: Brendan Shanahan, suspended by the league earlier in the day for a stick-swinging incident, scored on a 15-foot slap shot with 2:02 left in overtime to give St. Louis the victory at home. Shanahan was suspended for six non-game days without pay for hitting Minnesota's Mike Craig in the face with his stick on Dec. 22. In last night's game, Shanahan took a pass from Nelson Emerson in the right circle and fired the puck past goalie Mike Vernon to give the Blues consecutive victories for the first time since Oct. 31. (AP) Oilers 3, Blackhawks 3: Steve Larmer's second goal of the game with 5:38 left in the third period earned host Chicago the tie. Larmer took a pass from Michel Goulet, who had circled the Oilers' net as goaltender Bill Ranford was shoved into the net, and jammed the puck over the goal line. It marked the 11th straight season that Larmer, playing in his 843rd straight game, has scored 25 goals. (AP) N.B.A. Spurs Cast a Spell Dale Ellis scored a season-high 33 points and David Robinson added 16 as the San Antonio Spurs won at home over the Utah Jazz, 109-99, the Spurs' third victory over the Jazz this season. San Antonio, in second place in the Midwest Division, pulled within four games of Utah. The Jazz's six-game winning streak was stopped. (AP) Trail Blazers 113, Rockets 91: Cliff Robinson scored 21 points and Portland took advantage of the Rockets' 19-point fourth quarter for a road victory in Houston. Portland won its third straight victory, and the Rockets lost their sixth game in a row. Portland didn't lead until it went on 19-8 run over the final 7:13 of the third quarter. Houston went scoreless for 2:40 during Portland's run. (AP) Hawks 100, Bucks 94: Stacey Augmon scored 20 points, including two key baskets to keep Atlanta comfortably ahead in the final minute, and Kevin Willis added 18 points and 14 rebounds as Atlanta won in Milwaukee to end a four-game losing streak.

Getting It All Together","More than 80 years ago Braque and Picasso began to experiment in collage, incorporating the detritus of everyday life -- newspapers, train tickets, torn fragments of paper -- into artwork. Their work sowed the seeds for a radical transformation of painting, the meaning of which is still being explored by artists today. In COLLAGE, ASSEMBLAGE, AND THE FOUND OBJECT (Abrams, $85), Diane Waldman follows the unfolding of collage as both a medium and a process in art, from Cubism and Dada through the work of such different artists as Vladimir Tatlin, Richard Hamilton and David Wojnarowicz. The author, the deputy director and senior curator of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, notes how the distinctions between found object and painting have blurred, as in the work of Anselm Kiefer, who incorporates items such as lead, straw and clothes into grim, monumental works about human destiny and guilt. In a new twist on the found object, artists like Sherrie Levine incorporate reproductions of previous masterpieces into their own creations. Finally, Ms. Waldman proposes that the connections between art and life suggested by the first collagists have deepened, with artworks being treated not as sacred relics but as part of the mishmash of the ordinary world from which, as Duchamp suggested, it is possible not just to create art but also simply to ",1993-01-10T05:00:00+0000

Painting Her Way In","In their attempts to magnify the accomplishments of women, some feminist scholars at times refuse to recognize the privileges that made those accomplishments possible. In BERTHE MORISOT'S IMAGES OF WOMEN (Harvard University, $45), Anne Higonnet declares that ""Morisot became a painter despite being a woman,"" then argues that the painter's association with the Impressionist movement was an extraordinary feat. However, this thoroughly researched study shows that such was not the case. Morisot (1841-95) profited from her upper-middle-class origins -- for example, she studied painting under Corot with the support of her mother. Her marriage in 1874 to Eugene Manet, the brother of the painter Edouard, made her socially and professionally a member of Impressionist circles. Little wonder that Morisot showed her work in all but one of the Impressionist exhibitions. Ms. Higonnet, who teaches art history at Wellesley College, devotes very little space to Morisot's style or technique, instead focusing on the sociopolitical forces that shaped her paintings. Even though the 1894 painting ""Julie Dreaming"" boldly depicts a sensual, languid adolescent, Ms. Higonnet writes, overall Morisot's work ""reflected a middle-class ideology of domestic femininity."" This observation seems fair, even though Ms. Higonnet then argues that Morisot wished to be freed ""from the cultural constraints of gender."" The author's unstable definition of the painter's relationship to her sex, and of the place of the female artist in 19th-century France, is disappointing and ultimately irritating. It is a pity that ideology should be put to work toward a belated recognition of Berthe Morisot; her talent alone should suffice.",1993-01-17T05:00:00+0000

It's true that archeologists are excavating graves from the fort along present-day Alameda Street, and that the Pima County Courthouse is an amiable example of Spanish Colonial Revival kitsch. But in general, downtown Tucson has papered over its Hispanic origins, with a few exceptions. There are two downtown districts, both within walking distance of El Presidio Park, that bring Hispanic Tucson vividly to life. In one, directly north of the park and also called El Presidio, it's possible to walk Tucson's evolution from a Mexican to an American town in one block; the other is a compact neighborhood of more than 150 plastered adobe houses called the Barrio Historico.",1993-01-17T05:00:00+0000

I have recently been asked to pay these arrears and my suspicion is that yet another 13th assessment will be requested soon. The regular maintenance also goes up every January. Can you tell me whether these assessments are legal? Am I obligated to pay them? . . . M. Williams, Manhattan Answer: Yes. Common charges, according to Richard Siegler, a Manhattan lawyer, are generally imposed by the board of managers to defray the operations of the condominium, and they are borne by everybody in proportion to their interest in the condominium. He said the common charges could be changed as often as necessary to insure that the expenses were paid. They can be added to the regular monthly assessment or tacked on as a special assessment.",1993-01-17T05:00:00+0000

Here are excerpts from some early reviews. ""More than Nijinsky, he is Vestris, who was known as 'the god of the dance.' "" Olivier Merlin, Le Monde (Paris), June 21, 1961 ""To innate romanticism Nureyev adds a variety of gifts. Technically he is endowed with a neat figure, natural turn-out, exceptional elevation, impeccable turns and beats, strong but sensitive feet (rare in a man) and a suppleness laced with a fiery dash of Slav temperament which permits him more grace than most men could get away with. When he makes one of his great loping runs like a cheetah caught behind bars, he seems to be made of more elastic material than normal humanity."" Alexander Bland, The Observer (London), Feb. 23, 1962 ""As to his beats, we have not, I think, seen their like before. Soft, without strain, without vestige of hurry, with the feet fluttering as though motivated by a bird's wing rather than by a man's muscle, his entrechats are beyond description."" A. H. Franks, The Dancing Times (London), March 1962 ""A pop dancer -- that's what we've got -- a pop dancer, at last. What the telly did for art, what Billy Graham did for religion, Nureyev has done for ballet. . . . Pop dancers, like pop singers, have got to have a gimmick or some special thing about them, like tears or a wiggle or a half-starved little-boy look; and I think Nureyev's thing is that even when he is behaving in a withdrawn and gentlemanly way you feel that he may suddenly snarl and bite you in the neck."" Richard Buckle, The Sunday Times of London, May 20, 1962 ""Nureyev, with his shock of unruly hair, his sullen expression, seems indeed, at first glance, like a beatnik in ballet tights. . . . But there is nothing crude or gauche about this animal. He is catlike in both his elegance of action and his enigmatic expression. The discipline of a premier danseur appears to cloak a creature of wild and beautiful movement impulses."" Walter Terry, The New York Herald Tribune, June 10, 1962 ""From the very beginning of the 'Flower Festival' pas de deux Mr. Nureyev showed why he has been an object of dance attention during the past year. It is because of his extraordinary personality projection, which is the result of a natural stage instinct developed with the most careful calculation, and because of the unusual quality of his dance movements. He has an acute consciousness of every part of his body from the top of his head to the tips of his fingers and toes; he knows that every little inflection of it counts and he sees to it that the audience is made aware of each inflection.""

Papageno, for one, may have a connection with the bird-men of Egyptian hieroglyphics, but surely those fierce-looking figures are not meant to be Papageno-like dunces.

us,Maya Angelou: 'On the Pulse of Morning',"A Rock, A River, A Tree Hosts to species long since departed, Marked the mastodon, The dinosaur, who left dried tokens Of their sojourn here On our planet floor, Any broad alarm of their hastening doom Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages. But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully, Come, you may stand upon my Back and face your distant destiny, But seek no haven in my shadow. I will give you no hiding place down here. You, created only a little lower than The angels, have crouched too long in The bruising darkness Have lain too long Face down in ignorance. Your mouths spilling words Armed for slaughter. The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me, But do not hide your face. Across the wall of the world, A River sings a beautiful song, Come, rest here by my side. Each of you, a bordered country, Delicate and strangely made proud, Yet thrusting perpetually under siege. Your armed struggles for profit Have left collars of waste upon My shore, currents of debris upon my breast. Yet today I call you to my riverside, If you will study war no more. Come, Clad in peace, and I will sing the songs The Creator gave to me when I and the Tree and the rock were one. Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your Brow and when you yet knew you still Knew nothing. The River sang and sings on. There is a true yearning to respond to The singing River and the wise Rock. So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew The African, the Native American, the Sioux, The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheikh, The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher, The Privileged, the Homeless, the Teacher. They hear. They all hear The speaking of the Tree. Today, the first and last of every Tree Speaks to humankind. Come to me, here beside the River. Plant yourself beside me, here beside the River. Each of you, descendant of some passed On traveller, has been paid for. You, who gave me my first name, you, Pawnee, Apache, Seneca, you Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then Forced on bloody feet, Left me to the employment of Other seekers -- desperate for gain, Starving for gold. You, the Turk, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot, You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought, Sold, stolen, arriving on a nightmare Praying for a dream. Here, root yourselves beside me. I am that Tree planted by the River, Which will not be moved. I, the Rock, I, the River, I, the Tree I am yours -- your passages have been paid. Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need For this bright morning dawning for you. History, despite its wrenching pain, Cannot be unlived, but if faced With courage, need not be lived again. Lift up your eyes upon The day breaking for you. Give birth again To the dream. Women, children, men, Take it into the palms of your hands, Mold it into the shape of your most Private need. Sculpt it into The image of your most public self. Lift up your hearts Each new hour holds new chances For new beginnings. Do not be wedded forever To fear, yoked eternally To brutishness. The horizon leans forward, Offering you space to place new steps of change. Here, on the pulse of this fine day You may have the courage To look up and out and upon me, the Rock, the River, the Tree, your country. No less to Midas than the mendicant. No less to you now than the mastodon then. Here, on the pulse of this new day You may have the grace to look up and out And into your sister's eyes, into Your brother's face, your country And say simply Very simply With hope Good morning.",1993-01-21T05:00:00+0000

When disorder of the most extreme sort came during World War II, Mr. Wigner's abhorrence of the Nazi plague contributed to a crucial application of physics to warfare: in 1939, he and Leo Szilard drove out to Albert Einstein's summer hideaway on Long Island and persuaded him to write the letter to President Roosevelt that initiated the Manhattan project, the development of a fission weapon. The project itself brought together a brilliant quartet of Hungarian physicists -- Eugene Wigner, Leo Szilard, Edward Teller and John von Neumann -- all of whom, save Szilard, embraced conservative politics after the war.

us,A Pose for Everybody,"To judge from the hype still being produced about Jean Cocteau -- as if, nearly 30 years after his death at the age of 74, he were still orchestrating his own public relations campaign -- the poet, playwright and film maker was a brazen self-promoter. To be fair, this teen-age runaway turned bohemian darling did strike a pose before the cameras of almost every major photographer who crossed his path: Robert Doisneau, Arnold Newman, Paul Strand, Irving Penn, Philippe Halsman. As shown in the collection JEAN COCTEAU: The Mirror and the Mask (Godine, cloth, $40; paper, $24.95), Cocteau invariably affected a neurasthenic vulnerability -- the latter-day Rimbaud look -- but the effect of that look changed radically over the years. At first it glamorized a sexy young dandy (in an anonymous vacation snapshot taken when he was 26), an elegant artiste (in a Man Ray portrait taken when Cocteau was 33) and a stylish prankster (in Berenice Abbot's gangster-with-gun shot, taken when he was 38). But Cocteau's fame caught up with him, and the photographs became less about him and more about the elements of his much-cultivated image: the veined hands, the troubled eyes, the tense mouth. Of Cocteau's later portraitists, only Cecil Beaton and Jacques-Henri Lartigue picked up on how small he seemed to feel, how defeated by the world around him. The introduction by the book's editor, Julie Paul, the owner of a New York City art gallery, and the sketch by Francis Steegmuller, the author of a biography of Cocteau, are informative, but they tend to enforce the myth of Cocteau -- the unflappable showman, the quintessential celebrity -- that the photographs themselves do a lot to undo.",1993-01-24T05:00:00+0000

Mize pulled away from a tightly bunched pack with a 10-foot birdie putt on the 15th hole at Tucson National and won the Northern Telecom Open by two strokes. Five other men had led or shared the final round lead before the steady Mize assumed control on the back nine. He retained the top spot with a 10-foot par putt on the 17th, then assured the victory when he lashed a 4-iron approach to within 6 feet of the flag on the 18th. Jeff Maggert, frequently a contender but not yet a winner since coming up from the Ben Hogan Tour two years ago, was second alone at 273 after a 67. Maggert had the lead alone until he three-putted from the fringe on the 15th. He parred in and could do nothing but hope Mize would stumble. (AP) SKIING Slalom to Austrian",1993-01-25T05:00:00+0000

The Pistons nearly overcame a 16-point Phoenix lead in the final seven minutes, but Terry Mills's 3-pointer spun out as the final buzzer sounded. Detroit is now 0-10 in games in which Dennis Rodman didn't play. He missed last night's game with a strained calf muscle. The Suns led by 109-93 with 6 minutes 45 seconds left, but had to fight off a furious Piston rally to hang on for the victory. The Pistons went on a 23-10 run, and Gerald Glass's tip-in with 35 seconds to play pulled them within 119-116. Kevin Johnson made one of two free throws with 14.8 seconds left, but Joe Dumars hit a 3-pointer with 7 seconds left to make it a 1-point game. Johnson was fouled again, and again made one free throw, giving Detroit a chance to go for the victory, but Mills's shot just missed. (AP) Hawks 117, Kings 106: Dominique Wilkins scored 38 points and Kevin Willis had 30 points and 17 rebounds as the Hawks rallied in the third period to beat Sacramento at Atlanta. Wilkins, scoring at least 30 points for the fourth time in five games, hit a fallaway jump shot with 4:07 to play in the third to give Atlanta a 73-72 lead it never relinquished. The victory was the 100th for Bob Weiss as coach of the Hawks and was Atlanta's seventh in its last 10 games. (AP) N.H.L.

Boston's Adam Oates forced overtime with his 30th goal of the season by beating Patrick Roy on a rebound with 42 seconds remaining in the third period after Blue had been pulled for an extra skater. Ronan, a native of Boston, drove toward the Bruins' net on the decisive play, putting the puck behind Blue for only his fourth goal in 37 games this season.

Moore, who played for the United States Olympic team at the Barcelona Games, was playing just his second game with the American team. He got the tying goal off a give-and-go with Jean Harbor and Mike Sorber. Mark Strudal had put the Danes ahead in the 29th minute off a mixup by United States defenders and goalkeeper Tony Meola, but Bruce Murray tied the score 14 minutes into the second half with his 20th international goal, the most in United States history. Strudal's goal came when he beat two United States defenders, then caught Meola off his line and lobbed the ball over him from about 10 yards out. (AP) TRACK AND FIELD Powell Matches His Own Indoor Best Mike Powell produced his best indoor long jumps and Henry Neal upstaged Dennis Mitchell in the 60-meter dash as Americans muscled in on a Britain-Russia meet yesterday in Glasgow, Scotland. Roger Kingdom, whose 1992 season was wrecked by injury, cruised to victory in the 60-meter hurdles, and Michael Johnson rallied to win his first 400-meter race of the season. Powell, the world outdoor record-holder but a rare performer indoors, matched his personal best indoors with a leap of 26 feet, 5 3/4 inches on his third attempt. He improved that to 26-8 1/2 on his fifth jump, then sailed 27-5 1/4 on his final attempt. Only world indoor record-holder Carl Lewis, Robert Emmiyan and Larry Myricks have jumped farther indoors.

us,"IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
Making Faces","A caricature is a portrait with an attitude, a likeness meant to provoke recognition by its distortions. Although its purpose is often nothing more than to be a visual prank, caricature at its best has often been an acerbic and accessible form of social and political criticism. In THE SAVAGE MIRROR: The Art of Contemporary Caricature (Watson-Guptil, paper, $29.95), Steven Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, and Gail Anderson, the deputy art director of Rolling Stone, present an overview of contemporary caricature, tracing its evolution from 19th-century France through its powerful resurgence in the United States from the mid-1950's to the mid-1970's. The authors explain the roles that editorial preferences, design fads and technology have played in creating the current scene, which they seem, almost in spite of themselves, to find disappointing. For Ms. Anderson and Mr. Heller, caricaturists have great power -- and perhaps even a duty -- to address the issues of the day, to use their skills to rouse the public. Today the subjects of caricature are less likely to be political figures than celebrities, who menace our sensibilities more than our freedom. As the book amply illustrates, in changing from pen to airbrush, caricature has gone from inspired anger to dextrous hipness. Ms. Anderson and Mr. Heller clearly believe that a caricature should communicate an idea; as they survey contemporary caricature, they see ""little gems of mild distortion"" rather than a savage mirror that confronts society with its sorry reflection. This profusely illustrated book provides an excellent introduction to its subject, and the authors are persuasive in their arguments for the importance of caricature.",1993-01-31T05:00:00+0000
