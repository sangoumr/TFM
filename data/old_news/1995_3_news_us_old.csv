He attacked several Democratic opponents for what he called a ""stunning flipflop"" on a measure they voted for a year ago, and other Republican senators criticized President Clinton's opposition, as well. On Tuesday, Mr. Dole suddenly postponed the vote on the amendment when it became clear that he had just 66 of the 67 votes needed. The decision to have the final vote today came after apparently unsuccessful attempts to reach a compromise that would keep Social Security trust funds off limits to budget cutters. ""There is no reason a balanced budget amendment could not pass with nearly 80 votes in a matter of a few minutes -- if they're willing to protect Social Security,"" said Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat.

A New York Chronicle","No one would survive a ride on the subway if live and let live were not part of the New Yorker's creed. For the addicts, artists and other types that the Village Voice columnist Guy Trebay has met roaming the boroughs, that credo is more than a coping mechanism, it's a way of life. Yet in the face of the familiar urban plagues -- crack, heroin and AIDS -- Mr. Trebay's subjects remain fiercely optimistic, like the woman on East Third Street who planted a formal garden next door to a haven for drug addicts, or the artist who hung the trees in a vacant 125th Street lot with empty Ripple wine bottles. These and other bypassed New Yorkers find sympathetic commentary in Mr. Trebay's collection of Voice columns, IN THE PLACE TO BE: Guy Trebay's New York (Temple University, cloth, $49.95; paper, $19.95). Portrayed in Sylvia Plachy's haunting photographs, Mr. Trebay's subjects hold forth in the city's distinct vernacular. The author does not use his role as chronicler to moralize. There are no politics or preaching in his candid takes on a venereal disease clinic, a crack hot line or a homeless woman who lives in the 145th Street subway station. This is a frank and engaging look at a city that teaches its inhabitants not to make eye contact. HANNA RUBIN",1995-03-05T05:00:00+0000

In the 1960's, the hologram reached the general public as a portrait medium, then spent decades gathering dust in trinket shops in the form of eyeball key chains and unicorn stickers.SEEING TRIPLE: The hologram's optical sleight of hand is appearing on album covers, greeting cards, cereal boxes and even California drivers' licenses. Just about everyone carries one around on a credit card. It made the cover of Sports Illustrated with an image of a poker-faced Michael Jordan that broke into a smile when seen from a certain angle.

WELL, NOT QUITE To both its proponents and critics, the slotless slot machine, as it is known, represents something of an artful high-tech dodge of state laws that prohibit slot machines in New York, even on Indian reservations where casino gambling is allowed. They provide the individualized, fast-paced and uncomplicated gambling that slot machine users crave. But because they have no levers, do not require players to insert money and do not return money -- a player's winnings or losses are recorded on computer -- the terminals don't seem to fit the legal definition of a slot machine.

us,Business Diary: March 5-10,"Americans Can Still Get 100 Pennies for a Dollar The plunging dollar and peso have, it seems, matched headline for headline lately, which could lead a casual observer to think this country's woes match Mexico's. That's silly, of course. For starters, while Mexico's currency has lost half its value in a few months, the dollar, after falling for a decade, has lost far less. But the bigger point is that America is big enough, ultimately, not to care that much. We buy 90 percent of our stuff right here, and that spending won't be seriously affected by what happens across the ocean. So while Alan Greenspan hinted at raising rates again, which arrested a dollar slide last week, some economists say it would be foolish to go through such hoops that it lands us in recession. Look at it this way: it's not that the dollar is low, said Paul Krugman, a Stanford economist, but that ""the yen and the mark are getting ridiculously high.""",1995-03-12T05:00:00+0000

Witness","The photographer Dorothea Lange, best known for her images of the Depression, was born Dorothy Nutzhorn, but later dropped her father's name (he had abandoned the family), adopting her mother's maiden name and amending Dorothy -- because it didn't sound beautiful. DOROTHEA LANGE: A Visual Life (Smithsonian Institution, cloth, $55; paper, $24.95) includes scholarly essays and personal remembrances about Lange (1895-1965) -- the feminist heroine; the wife, lover and mother; the photographer of Japanese internment camps for the War Relocation Authority. There is also an interview with Ansel Adams, with whom Lange worked. (The editor, Elizabeth Partridge, as a youngster knew Lange intimately.) The longest and most interesting essay, by Sally Stein, who teaches art history at the University of California, Irvine, focuses on Lange's disability -- a lifelong limp as a result of childhood polio -- and its influence on her portraits. Lange often dropped down to focus on hands in relation to torso, or even lower to the position of the legs and feet. The most fascinating texts in the book, however, are Lange's, in a chapter entitled ""Dorothea Lange: Her Words and Images,"" and that of her oldest son, Daniel Dixon. He writes that his mother ""never described herself as an artist"" but as ""a 'witness,' an 'observer.' "" Lange was an artist, and the many photographs included here, some of her best known as well as more obscure images, bear witness to that fact.ROBIN LIPPINCOTT",1995-03-12T05:00:00+0000

But the action was tempered by the first signs of trouble in the Republicans' promise to compensate for the tax cuts by cutting spending. Party leaders had to concede that they were hard pressed to win support for even a first modest round of reductions. Republicans have insisted that they would pay for the tax cuts with equivalent reductions in spending so the deficit would not be worsened; they have not specified how they would do so. LOBBYING FOR THE ARTS: The country singer Garth Brooks was among 350 musicians, actors, artists and cultural leaders who lobbied in the Capitol to divert Congress from its determination to cut Federal subsidies to the arts.

us,PICTURING THE WORLD,"Founded more than 100 years ago to educate Americans about the rest of the world, National Geographic has evolved from its earnest beginnings into a publication dependent on dramatic photography to hold its large readership. Two hundred forty-five images, primarily from the last 15 years, have been assembled in NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC: The Photographs (National Geographic Society, $50). Although technology and personal vision have changed the style of the magazine's photography, the belief in photography as what the book's author, Leah Bendavid-Val, calls ""the ultimate eyewitness"" seems stronger than ever. Ms. Bendavid-Val, a senior editor at National Geographic Books, writes that the use of color portrays ""foreign scenes more accurately and graphically than black and white."" Undermining this notion of truth in color is the book's striking cover, a portrait of a young Afghan refugee, her face framed by a loose rust-colored scarf, set against a soft green background that accentuates her hazel eyes. The book jacket claims her eyes ""speak volumes about war and fear""; but to the viewer her fearful expression could just as easily have been caused by an intrusive telephoto lens. Whether or not the photographs succeed in the impossible task of conveying the truth about war or famine or sea turtles, they are the products of extremely enterprising men and women, highly skilled in their craft, rich in resources and driven in their quest for great shots.

For Castro And Friends","WHAT: The Trinidad, a handmade Cuban cigar produced in a factory in Havana called El Laguito. But unlike other Cuban cigars, this one isn't for sale. The Trinidad is made expressly for President Fidel Castro to give out to visiting dignitaries. This distribution system, combined with limited production and illicit appeal, has made it the ultimate status symbolSPECS: The Trinidad is seven and a half inches long. To add to the cigars' mystique, they are packed in unmarked cedar boxes, each containing 100 cigars, rather than the customary 50.SON OF COHIBA: Before the Trinidad existed -- and even its date of birth is a state secret -- the Cohiba was considered the finest Cuban cigar. Like the Trinidad, the Cohiba was made for Mr. Castro's private stash. But over the years, this cigar acquired an almost mythical reputation that stimulated great demand on the market, and in 1983 it was made available to the public. Shortly thereafter, the Trinidad replaced the Cohiba as the holy grail of cigars.LIFE STYLES OF THE RICH AND FRAGRANT: Last October in Paris, Cigar Aficionado magazine held a charity event that it modestly called ""The Dinner of the Century."" After a lavish meal and a sampling of Trinidads, an auction was conducted. Several lots included Trinidads, and the final one, listed on the program as ""The King's Ransom,"" consisted of 300 rare Cuban cigars, 100 of which were Trinidads. A Hong Kong businessman $200,000. All cigars were donated by Mr. Castro, and much of the proceeds went to benefit Cuba's Medical Relief Fund.BARGAIN SPECIAL? Dennis Overstreet, a cigar dealer in Beverly Hills, Calif., says it is possible to obtain Trinidads for considerably less. ""You don't have to know Fidel to get Trinidads,"" Mr. Overstreet said. ""But you do need to go to the factory in Cuba and know a friend of a friend to get them. A typical deal might be to purchase four boxes of Cohibas for an exorbitant price, say $2,000, and receiving 25 or 50 Trinidads as a gift.""'BALDERDASH!' Even that limited access is open to dispute. ""There are only 100 Trinidads in Los Angeles,"" said Thomas Hinds, the owner of Thomas Hinds Tobacconist in Los Angeles. ""I know, because I purchased them at the Paris auction. What you have to realize is that 90 percent of the Cuban cigars that come into this city are counterfeits brought in through Tijuana by smugglers."" Of course, it is illegal to bring Cuban cigars into the United States (although, curiously, it is not illegal to smoke them).CROSS FIRE: ""Look, if Michael Ovitz wants to give somebody 50 Trinidads, somehow they will miraculously appear on his desk the next morning,"" Mr. Overstreet said. ""And you can be sure that they won't be counterfeit."" But Mr. Hinds insists that only Mr. Castro really has access to Trinidads.JUST OUR LUCK: Last April, a delegation of former United States ambassadors traveled to Cuba to assess the impact of the trade embargo. ""We visited with Mr. Castro for three hours,"" said William J. vanden Heuvel, a former deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, ""and afterwards, we all received a box of cigars. But no Trinidads. They were all Cohibas.""RENE CHUN",1995-03-19T05:00:00+0000

(Helen and Kurt Wolff/Harcourt Brace, $18.95.) These tales by a Polish writer, which turn on the longings and workings of memory, are rooted in the highly idiosyncratic history of Gdansk.

Earlier in the week, 102 Republicans in the House broke ranks with the leadership on the proposed $500 tax credit for families with children. The combined developments suggest trouble for Speaker Newt Gingrich. SPENDING CUTS -- The Senate Appropriations Committee slashed $13 billion from hundreds of Federal programs as a way to reduce the budget deficit and pay for disaster aid to California. The measure cleared the committee by unanimous consent after Democrats agreed to hold their amendments, and their rancor, for the Senate floor. WELFARE REFORM -- The House approved one of the most important items on the Republican agenda, a measure to undo six decades of Federal social-welfare legislation. The vote, almost entirely on party lines, was 234 to 199. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION -- The Senate voted to repeal a communications tax break intended to bolster minority ownership of cable and broadcast companies. The repeal, passed on a voice vote, is a blow to the entertainment giant Viacom Inc. The company's plan to use the 17-year-old tax break to defer nearly $500 million in Federal taxes on the sale of its cable systems propelled the provision into the spotlight. On another issue, Deval Patrick, Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, told a House panel: ""This Administration is committed to the goal of expanding opportunity for all Americans in education, employment and the economy generally.

us,Wrapped Up in Art,"The first book jackets, devised in the 1830's to protect bindings from London's soot and fog, were made of thin kraft paper and covered all sides of the volume. Traditionally book designers have believed that fine bindings were a book's ultimate esthetic virtue and the jacket was mere wrapping and advertising. As late as the 1950's, the American Institute of Graphic Arts refused to exhibit jackets at its annual book show. However, as Steven Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, and Seymour Chwast, the director of the Pushpin Group, a graphic design company, show in JACKETS REQUIRED (Chronicle, paper, $19.95), ""book jackets emerged as one of America's more vital graphic media and became a proving ground for eccentric design."" Many of the jackets depicted in the book are creased and torn and look as if they have been moldering on shelves for decades. It is fascinating, and often surprising, to see the original jackets for contemporary favorites like ""A Farewell to Arms"" or ""Of Mice and Men"" or ""Appointment in Samarra,"" but the real standouts are more obscure items like A. H. Bolton's orange and blue design for Maximilian Foster's ""Crooked"" (1927), whose ""art moderne-inspired perspective of skyscrapers evokes the big-city life that comes shattering down on the novel's protagonist."" It turns out that you can tell a book by its cover, as Mr. Heller and Mr. Chwast demonstrate with Eugene Thurston's jackets for the Mystery League and Alvin Lustig's for New Directions, with a stately, eerily lighted ""Paul Bunyan"" by Rockwell Kent and with such forgotten classics of shading and perspective as the jacket for ""Hacking New York"" (1930), in which ""the quintessential moderne cityscape sets the stage for the tale of a literary cabdriver.""

In a way, it is. Each vial contains a one-milliliter dose of a product known as gp120, which has cost its manufacturer, Genentech, $100 million and untold grief. Is gp120, as some scientists believe, a crucial first approximation of the desperately needed vaccine to prevent AIDS? Or is it, as others say, nothing more than expensive dishwater? No one knows. Neither Genentech's product nor a similar vaccine made by Chiron Biocine has yet been tested enough to tell. So far, no vials have passed through the enormous steel doors to the loading dock beyond and from there into syringes and into the arms of the 10,000 volunteers whose bodies alone can answer the question. Instead, the vials sit and wait, with nothing to interrupt their silence but a workman's boom box, which suddenly sings out from the loading dock: ""Who'll Stop the Rain?""

It's true that Wright's design often doesn't display art to excellent advantage. But occasionally a show comes along in which art and architecture reinforce each other, creating the unified experience Wright envisioned. For me, the Guggenheim's current retrospective of paintings by Ross Bleckner is such a show.
