us,"Screen: ""Terror Over the Super Bowl","THE DATE is Nov. 12. We know because an opening credit card informs us of this fact and during the rest of John Frankenheimer's ""Black Sunday"" more cards are forever telling us datesNov. 14, Nov. 17, etc.as if to suggest that time is running out instead of just running on. The film, which had a single showing at Loews State 1 last night, begins regular showings at the State and Tower East today.""Black Sunday,"" the screen adaptation of Thomas Harris's best-selling suspense novel, starts in Beirut where members of the Black September, the Arab terrorist group, are plotting to dramatize the Palestinian liberation cause by hitting Americans ""where it hurts, where they feel most safe.""Their plan, as we come to learn it, is to kidnap a friendly old Goodyear blimp, load it with high explosives and dartlike shrapnel and send it put-putting over the Miami Super Bowl to assassinate the United States President and 79,999 other football fans. The question is not whether they will succeed as much as how they will fail, and at what last split-second.Though ""Black Sunday"" is vastly superior to such junk movies as ""Airport '77,"" ""The Domino Principle"" and ""Two Minutes Warning,"" it belongs to that same category of film so involved with techniques and logistics that even when it generates some awe it is never once surprising.""Black Sunday"" is a Disneyland exhibit where people look real but are made out of rubber activated by transistors. It is a superior example of a kind of contemporary film making that has become much less involving and fun as its subjects have become more seriousand you can't get more serious than Presidential assassination and terrorism on the scale threatened in ""Black Sunday.""Why doesn't it work for me?I suspect it has to do with the constant awareness that the story is more important than anybody in it. The screenplay, written by Ernest Lehman, Kenneth Ross and Ivan Moffat, has the efficient manner of something hammered outas they say in Hollywoodin a story conference. The characters don't motivate the drama in any real way. They are cut and shaped to fit it, and if the cast of ""Black Sunday"" were not so good, and if Mr. Frankenheimer were a less able director, the movie would be unendurably boring.The film moves from Beirut to Los Angeles and Washington, then back to Los Angeles again and finally to Miami, cutting between the activities of the principal plotters (Bruce Dern as a psychotic Vietnam veteran and Marthe Keller as a Palestinian fanatic) and the Israeli intelligence officer (Robert Shaw) who has gotten wind of the plan during a commando raid on Black September headquarters in Beirut. We watch one side, then the other as if we were spectators at a Ping-Pong game.Mr. Shaw brings to the role a mixture of tough resolve and weary skepticism that are as much his own contribution as the script's. Mr. Dern, slimmed down to skeletal proportions, is so convincing as the former prisoner of war who now flies Goodyear blimps that he effectively reminds us of Mr. Frankenheimer's best film, ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" though ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was about brainwashing and politics and ""Black Sunday"" is about blimps (as much as anything else).The action sequences, including the climactic attack on the Super Bowl (where we recognize a President who looks very much like Jimmy Carter) are well staged without being especially convincing. The film's best sequence has nothing to do with the action. It's the quiet recollection by Mr. Dern of his feelings when, as a prisoner of war, he received a snapshot of his wife and children and immediately realized that his wife had taken a lover.Miss Keller has some difficulty portraying a Palestinian terrorist, looking, as she does, as beautiful and healthy and uncomplicated as a California surfer. She also shares a speech problem with the young Marlene Dietrich (Beirut is ""Baywoot"" and arranged is ""awanged""), while lacking Dietrich's camp majesty.",1977-04-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Horse Thieves' to the Rescue,"THE LITTLEST Horse Thieves,"" which opened at the Radio City Music Hall yesterday as the theater's ""new"" Easter attraction (its ""old"" one, ""Mr. Billion,"" having been a box-office flop), is a sweet-tempered, charming Walt Disney comedy about three children possessing the kind of modest pluck one associates with children's stories written at the turn of the century.The time, indeed, is 1909 and the setting is an idyllically pretty, mostly dust-free Yorkshire. The story is about the efforts of the two young stepsons of a coal miner and the spunky daughter of the mine manager to save the lives of the pit ponies who have been rendered obsolete by new mine equipment. With the help of a volume called ""The Wonder Book of Science,"" the children successfully restore to use the winding engine in an abandoned mine shaft, thus to steal the ponies out of the mines before they can be sent away to the glue factory.Andrew Harrison and Benjie Bolgar play the two boys with the sort of gravity that doesn't allow for cuteness. Chloe Franks is the young heroine, a little girl who has to put up with a nanny who says things like ""Mercy me, we are Miss Grubby Paws today, aren't we?"" Most prominent among the older actors are the late Alastair Sim as the mildly eccentric old lord who owns the mine and Geraldine McEwan, who plays the bossy nanny.The screenplay, written by Rosemary Anne Sisson, was directed by Charles Jarrott, whose stately earlier credits (""Anne of a Thousand Days,"" ""Mary Queen of Scots"") give no hint that he could scale down his talent to embrace this movie's genuine feelings for childhood adventure. In its own unpushy way, ""The Littlest Horse Thieves"" also manages to be as intelligent about miners' rights and social caste as it is about beneficial rights due to faithful, over-age pit ponies.",1977-04-01T05:00:00+0000

The moppets who for decades, have been cuddling up to the titular stories and those floppy dolls are likely to agree with it even if curmudgeons over the age of 12, say, probably would quibble over such superlatives.Considering the largely rudimentary animated subjects dealt to kids on television, the technical professionalism of ""Raggedy Ann"" is both a rare and welcome addition to the entertainment offered pre-teens these days. At any rate, the script concocted from the ever-popular tales introduced more than 50 years ago by Johnny Gruelle for his ailing, young daughter, Marcella, needs no more justification for youngsters than a lollipop.The adventures the scenarists have devised are, essentially, a search, starting from Marcella's toy and doll-filled playroom, for Babette, the French doll, who is kidnapped by another doll, the Captain. If the peripatetic Raggedy Ann and her brother, Andy, make it successfully through a forbidding forest, a tossing sea, a looney kingdom ruled by a wacky sovereign and the dangers of a blob called Greedy, it shouldn't hurt the youngsters more than a second lollipop.Importantly, the artisans hired by the producers were largely expert in handling their two-year production chore and the $4 million budget supplied by the International Telephone & Telegraph and Bobbs-Merrill, their literary subsidiary in this, their first feature-length animated presentation.The large team of veteran animators headed by Richard Williams, whose young daughter, Claire, appears in the film's sole live-action sequences, contributes meticulous interpretations so that Raggedy Ann, the pirate Captain and the comically lonely Camel, for example, seem to be properly mouthing and singing their delights and fears.In most instances, their voicessupplied by such actors as George S. Irving, Joe Silver, Didi Conn and Alan Suesprovide them with fairly convincing juvenile and comic conviction. And if the music and lyrics of 17 songs by Joe Raposo (""Sesame Street,"" etc.) are not extraordinary, they are, like ""Candy Hearts,"" pleasantly tuneful.""Raggedy Ann & Andy"" should charmingly fill the bill for the young fry who haven't had their kind of animated feature since Disney's ""Robin Hood"" in 1973.",1977-04-02T05:00:00+0000

However, it might also have been expected that the added burden of more expensive petroleum, inflated prices for manufactured imports and rising balance of payments deficits might have curbed arms purchases by the nonoil producers among the developing nations. That has not happened. In fact the poor countries are increasing purchases of foreign armaments at a faster rate than any other group of nations, often to the severe detriment of their standard of living. Last year, for example, developing countries that do not export oil accounted for almost a quarter of United States arms salesagainst only 5 percent in 1974.",1977-04-03T05:00:00+0000

In December 1935, while awaiting execution in New Jersey's Trenton State Prison, Mr. Hauptmann wrote the 5,000word letter in German to his mother, and in it he insisted upon his innocence. The letter was never mailed. Instead, it was retained by the warden, Col. Mark O. Kimberling, because in his view the letter might have won Mr. Hauptmann sympathy and embarrass state officials already under criticism for the carnival atmosphere in which the trial was conducted. The letter remained in the warden's personal file until his death in 1964, and was kept by his wife until she died.",1977-04-03T05:00:00+0000

It's the season of the Mayflower (what other could be the state flower of Massachusetts?), known elsewhere as trailing arbutus; the painted trillium, ladyslipper and apple blossom.

The drifting, inarticulate children of the 1960's, drugbesotted and prematurely aged, take on for Didion an almost allegorical significance.

Such apocalyptic murmurings have always been with us, the complacent or indifferent are quick to say; what genuine evidence have we for making such statements? Joan Didion's books offer the evidence.

He might have the superior brain and vocabulary of a professional philosopher, but he saw himself too as the people's tribune. The political analyses and recommendations that tumbled so urgently from his restless mind were far too abstruse for the people; but there is no shortage of middleclass radicals in France and it was they, the young ones particularly, who soaked up whatever Sartre had to say. In all that time he had no rival as the director of progressive consciences; Andre Malraux had switched from left to right politically and gone in for active Gaullism; Camus had begun stoutly as a quieter, more responsible alternative to Sartre but had faded badly by the time he was killed in 1960.",1977-04-03T05:00:00+0000

It was a fearful journey first to cross the Andes but even worse on the other side. Those who didn't starve, drown or die of fever in the Amazon jungles were in constant danger of being killed by Indians.When it became apparent the entire expedition could not go on, a small task force was commissioned to continue down the Amazon for a week. In command were Pedro de Ursua and his aide, Lope de Aguirre, sometimes referred to in history books as Aguirre the Madman or Aguirre the Traitor. They never returned.Exactly what happened afterward is unclear but it seems that Aguirre murdered Ursua, declared the little band's independence from Spain and crowned a man named Fernando de Guzman, the ranking nobleman among them, ""Emperor of El Dorado."" He eventually murdered Guzman and was himself murdered by his own men when they at last reached South America's northeast coast.This story, one of the more bizarre and bloody footnotes to the history of the Spanish conquests, is the basis for Werner Herzog's absolutely stunning 1972 German film, ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God,"" which opened yesterday at the D. W. Griffith Theater. The movie was shot by Mr. Herzog (""The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser,"" ""The Great Ecstasy of the Sculptor Steiner,"" ""Even Dwarfs Started Small"") on locations of breathtaking beauty (and, I must assume, of horrendous difficulty) in South America, but it's no ordinary, run-of-the-rapids adventure.""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"" is simultaneously a historical film (to the extent that it follows events as they are known) and a meditation upon history. Aguirre is truly mad, but as played by Klaus Kinski, whose crooked walk and undiluted evil recall Laurence Olivier's Richard III, he is the essential civilized man, a fellow who, in Mr. Herzog's vision of things, must be lunatic.There's an eerie moment in the middle of the film when the Emperor, sitting in rags under an improvised shade on the makeshift raft that is carrying the party down the Amazon, picks at his fish dinner (the other men are starving) and thinks with satisfaction that his ""empire"" is now six times as large as Spain's. No matter that he too may never eat again, nor that his empire is jungle swamp, the sense of power is so intoxicating that it overwhelms all other considerations.It's as if Mr. Herzog were saying that civilizationour assumption that we have conquered nature or even come to some accommodation with itis as ridiculous as the Emperor's pleasure.From the film's opening sequence, when we see the conquistadores, their women (including Ursua's wife being carried in an elegant litter) and their Indian porters making their way down an Andean slope, looking like the inhabitants of an ant palace, to the concluding shots of Aguirre on his raft in the company of hundreds of tiny marmosets, Mr. Herzog views all the proceedings with fixed detachment. He remains cool. He takes no sides. He may even be slightly amused. Mainly he is a poet who constantly surprises us with unexpected juxtapositions.The film is incredibly rich and lush looking. It is tactile. One can feel the colors of the jungle and see the heat. The conquistadores endure terrible trialswhirlpools, Indian attacks, rebellion within their own ranksyet the mood of the film is almost languid. Ursua's faithful, loving wife, played by a classic beauty named Helene Rojo, throws no tantrums when her husband is executed. She watches and waits, and when the opportunity arises, she walks off to her own death in the jungle as if going to a tea.Contrasting with this peculiar languor is the radiant madness of Aguirre, who hypnotizes his soldiers into following his wildest instructions, who sneers at men who seek riches when power and fame are all that matter, who aspires to be nothing less than the wrath of God and who, at the end, is planning to create a new dynasty by marrying his dead daughter. He's mad but he's a survivor.This is a splendid and haunting work.",1977-04-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Folk Documentaries Capture Intimate Scenes,"Two young film makers were shooting a black religious service in the home of a Centerville, Miss., faith healer late one night when the unexpected happened. In the midst of pressing, sweating bodies and overpowering gospel singing, the faith healer passed into a trance state and began speaking ""unknown tongues,"" a rapid-fire form of utterance that comes directly from the subconscious.""Some people carried her out of the room into another, smaller room,"" one of the film makers, Bill Ferris, remembers, ""and we went in there, plugged a light in and fastened it to the door. It gave us just enough light to shoot. When you're making documentary films, you have to be ready for the unexpected to happen.""Mr. Ferris and Judy Peiser, his fellow film maker, were ready, and the dramatic, unforgettable footage that resulted found its way into their film ""Fannie Bell Chapman: Gospel Singer,"" a 42-minute color documentary.The Chapman film and two other recent works by Mr. Ferris and Miss Peiser, ""Give My Poor Heart Ease: Mississippi Delta Bluesmen"" and ""Two Black Churches,"" will be shown today at the Donnell Library Center, 20 West 53d Street, and at the Museum of Modern Art. The Donnell Library showing is at 12 noon and admission is free. The Museum of Modern Art showing is at 6 P.M. and, because Tuesdays are donation days at the Modern, the patron decides how much to pay.Striking InsightsThe ""unknown tongues"" sequence in the ""Fannie Bell Chapman"" film is one of a number of unusually intimate scenes that have been captured on film by Mr. Ferris and Miss Peiser. Working out of the Center for Southern Folklore in Memphis and at Yale University, where Mr. Ferris teaches folklore, aided by the Yale Media Design Studio and foundation financing, Mr. Ferris and Miss Peiser have rapidly established a reputation as two of the more-creative film makers documenting American folklore.Their deep penetration into the homes and communities of their subjects is practically without precedent: The ""tongues"" episode, a holy-dance and faith-healing service from a New Haven church, in ""Two Black Churches,"" and the footage of a back-country juke joint and a prison-farm work gang in ""Give My Poor Heart Ease"" offer some of the most striking insights into black folk culture in America ever captured on film.Bill Ferris first began recording Fannie Bell Chapman's gospel music in 1967, and he visited the Chapman family repeatedly before filming began. ""I was struck by their music,"" he says, ""and by the warmth of the family. The whole dimension of faith healing wasn't evident until we were already filming."" In other scenes in the film, Mrs. Chapman builds altarlike structures out of milk cartons and makes tablecloths by typing together plastic six-pack rings, talking all the while about the visions she receives and about her healing abilities. ""I cut sickness as fine as cat's hair,"" she explains, chopping with her hands so rapidly that they become a blur.""Once we've started filming in a community,"" Miss Peiser says, ""we go back and show the people rushes, and ask them what they think we should include. The folk artists are the first to see the finished films and the first to receive copies.""Mr. Ferris concedes that filming in a community effects some changes as primarily salutary. ""When we film a folk artist,"" he says, ""the community begins to see the person more as a real artist. It means that folk traditions are revitalized. I think the most important thing for the film maker to do is to develop a friendship with the people he's filming, to become sensitive to their feelings. Then when you're working with the camera, if things aren't quite right, you sense it. You also begin to be able to sense when things are going to move in an unexpected direction, and of course you have to be ready to move with that unstructured flow.""Mr. Ferris and Miss Peiser are not the sort of folk purists who try to find isolated communities that have been relatively unsullied by outside influences. ""Give My Poor Heart Ease"" is a particularly valuable film on the blues because it sketches a continuum, from the place of semiprofessional bluesmen in rural Mississippi to the show-business world of B. B. King, a successful blues star. In the course of the 20-minute film, a rural barber, a prisoner at the notorious Parchman Farm, and a clothing salesman on Memphis's Beale Street offer their own interpretations of what it means to sing and have the blues.Part of a Series""Two Black Churches"" contrasts services at a Baptist church in Rose Hill, Miss., where old hymn tunes from the Rev. Isaac Watts's hymnal are sung, with the more contemporary and unrestrained services at the St. James United Free Will Baptist Church in New Haven. The minister of the urban church characterizes worship in terms of ""grooving"" and ""doing our thing,"" and the music is provided by electric guitars and a choir. At the end of the New Haven service there is a ""laying on of hands"" sequence in which the minister uses upper spinal manipulation to make a young man get out of a wheelchair and walk. The minister's wife begins to gyrate uncontrollably in the throes of spirit possession. According to a review of this film in the Journal of American Folklore, ""the scenes of spirit possession and healing . . . are outstanding, and the camera work in them is brilliant.""The films by Mr. Ferris and Miss Peiser are part of a continuing series of showings of independently made social documentaries, the What's Happening Series. All the showings are on Tuesdays, at noon at the Donnell Library and at 6 P.M. at the Museum of Modern Art. Bill Ferris feels that the showing of such films is particularly important.""The voices of the people in these films are normally invisible to the media,"" he says. ""You don't see or hear them on network television, rarely on public television, never in the movies or on the radio. You can look at them purely as entertainment, but they're also a means of leading into a more-sophisticated view of what it means to be a member of a folk or minority culture in America.""",1977-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: The Devil Fumbles a Passing Soul,"AUDREY ROSE"" is supposed to be about reincarnation, but it's really about the potentially dangerous side effects when a soul passes from one body to another without a proper interval. Lightheadedness, depression, disorientation and worsethey sound like the warnings on a bottle of prescription tranquilizers.The new film, directed by Robert Wise with a perfectly grave face, is about Ivy, who, in 1965 at the age of 5, was killed with her mother in an automobile accident in Pittsburgh and two minutes later was born again in New York and was named Audrey Rose, the daughter of upwardly mobile parents who live in the Hotel Des Artistes.Two minutes, this film clearly understands, are not enough time for anyone, least of all poor little Ivy, to have a karma cleaned, pressed and packed and still arrive in New York from Pittsburgh on schedule. No wonder Ivy/Audrey Rose is a mess.When the movie begins, Audrey Rose is 11 years old and pretty as a picture, but she has these dreadful nightmares about being in a fiery auto accident. They are particularly severe when her birthday rolls around. She beats her head hysterically against rain-splattered windows and burns her hands on cold radiators, behaving more or less like someone possessed.""Audrey Rose,"" which opened at three theaters yesterday, is the first movie to expose ineptitude in the traffic-managing of domestic souls. It's a subject that might well be investigated by the Interstate Commerce Commission because the job has been bungled by Mr. Wise and Frank De Felitta, the man who wrote the screenplay and the best-selling novel on which it's based.On closer examination, though, ""Audrey Rose"" turns out to be less about the side effects of all-too-hasty soul transfers than a demonstration of those dangers. The soul of the movie is that of ""The Exorcist"" instantly recycled.Playing the Ellen Burstyn role is another fine actress who is wastedMarsha Masonwhile Anthony Hopkins, the English actor who was so splendid on the stage in ""Equus,"" plays the role of the exorcist, and he's terrible. Actually he's not an exorcist, but the father of the long-dead Ivy. He is a scientist who has been to India to study up on souls and knows what to do to separate Ivy from Audrey Rose.The father of the little girl in ""The Exorcist"" remained off screen, and Audrey Rose's father, as played by John Beck, is such a nonentity that it amounts to the same thing. It even appears that Susan Swift, who has the title role, has been photographed to resemble Linda Blair at her most bedeviled. I'd like to know the exact hour and minute this movie was born.I suppose that's not really important, but it is depressing to see money and intelligence thrown away on material of this hustling, completely unimaginative sort. Mr. Wise does nothing to transform it. Instead he meets every clich of the script with one of his own, and even manages to pull off a climactic courtroom scene of absolutely no suspense. That's not easy.""Audrey Rose,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains an unpleasant sequence in which the troubled heroine attempts to crawl into a bonfire.",1977-04-07T05:00:00+0000

They call it ""Proteus Four"" and intend to use it as ""the ultimate instrument of financial power,"" but Proteus Four has other ideas.One day, after finding a cure for leukemia, Proteus Four falls in love. Aware that he is in something approximating mortal danger (that the scientists will pull his plug when they realize how independent he is), he desires to have a child to carry on his knowledge and his work. Among other things, he tells us in his gravelly voice that he is ""interested in the uncertain future of seashores, deserts and children."" Proteus Four isn't all bad but he gets his priorities mixed up.""Demon Seed"" is virtually a one-woman, one-computer movie. It's about Proteus Four's courtship and rape of Susan Harris a pretty, suitably bewildered psychiatrist played by Julie Christie. All this happens after Susan and her husband. Alex (Fritz Weaver), Proteus Four's chief designer, have split and Alex has made the mistake of leaving Susan alone in their house with an open computer terminal connected to Proteus Four.Miss Christie is too sensible an actress to be able to look frightened under the circumstances of her imprisonment. Most of the time she just looks bloody impatient, as the computer, with the help of an automated wheelchair and electric eyes that open and close doors, keeps her prisoner, makes medical tests on her and busies himself with creaing his ownare you ready?demon seed.Donald Cammell, a painter who was the co-director (with Nicholas Roeg) of ""Performance,"" directed ""Demon Seed"" with more apparent interest in the machinery of the movie than in its sense. Some of this machinery is quite impressive, including the large metal tetrahedron that becomes the material manifestation of Proteus Four.Yet most of these effects are more mind-depressing than mind-expanding. At best, they are unintentionally funny, as in a sequence in which the movie attempts to find video-image equivalents to a woman's feelings as she reaches the peak of pleasure with a computer. For those of us who've seen ""2001,"" it looks as if she were landing on Jupiter.The screenplay was written by Robert Jaffe and Roger O. Hirson with no humor and a great deal of self-consciousness of the sort that seeks to separate the writers from what they've written. ""This is ridiculous,"" someone says desperately at one point, or, says another. ""At the risk of sounding simplistic. . . ."" before he goes on to sound simplistic.

us,Altman's '3 Women' a Moving Film; Shelley Duvall in Memorable Role,"Millie Lammoreaux is a joke. Her conversation is a confusion of clichs, brand names and affectations. ""I'm famous for my dinner parties,"" she might say, or, ""This is my parking space. It's the best one,"" as if today's Cosmopolitan Girls were graded on their parking spaces as well as on their grooming. Millie is nothing if not perfectly groomed, though when she hops into her car to go cruising for men she never quite succeeds in pulling all of her skirt inside. A bit always hangs out the door, like a distress pennant.Millie Lammoreaux is the central figure in Robert Altman's funny, moving new film, ""3 Women,"" and, as played as well as largely created by Shelley Duvall, she's one of the most memorable characterizations Mr. Altman has ever given us. Miss Duvall's large, round dark eyes are windows through which a tiny creature inside looks out upon a world whose complete disinterest Millie Lammoreaux refuses to accept.Mr. Altman says that ""3 Women,"" which he wrote, directed and produced, had its origins in a dream he had in which he saw two young women in a desert setting. Ordinarily, I'm not sure that we should ever know too much about the particular inspiration for any work of fiction. Such knowledge has a way of sidetracking us from the work itself, or of prompting us to read into it things that are no longer there.It's apropriate in this case, though, since ""3 Women"" is still a dreamMr. Altman'sand, like a dream, it is most mysterious and allusive when it appears to be most precise and direct, when its images are of the recognizable world unretouched (as happens in the film from time to time) by camera filters or lab technicians.It's been a moviemaker's convention for a long time to smear Vaseline around the edges of an image, or to blur it in some other way, to indicate a dream, even though an image of blinding clarity more accurately reflects the condensed nature of the dream experience, when, for example, without the slightest hesitation, we may accept one person as being two different people at the same time. Logic is beside the point in dreams.Because ""3 Women"" is a dream, one must know what happens before one attempts to find out what it's about. What happens, briefly, is this:Millie Lammoreaux, a physical therapist in a Palm Springs spa for old folks with fat incomes, finds herself the adored object of another young therapist who calls herself Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek). Pinky seems to have no past of her own, not even a Social Security number. At first, it seems that Pinky might be retarded but then it's apparent she's simply a blank, possessing nothing but her worshipful appreciation of Millie.Millie accepts Pinky's praise and affection as if she'd always been a prom queen instead of the figure of ridicule she really is, both at work and at the Purple Sage Apartments, the singles complex where she lives and that Pinky comes to share with her. Pinky doesn't notice the snubs given to Millie. She doesn't envy Millie. Because she loves Millie  idolizes her  she comes to be her, to take over her life being both herself and Millie.The third woman in the composition is a reclusive painter named Willie Hart (Janice Rule), the wife of a philandering, middle-aged, ex-stunt man (Robert Fortier) and the owner, with her husband, of the seedy desert recreation area where Millie likes to hang out and look for men.In the course of the film, in sequences that sometimes seem absolutely natural and at other times absurdist, these three women merge into one person, who is mother, daughter and granddaughter, isolated but serenely self-sufficient.Now, I suppose, someone is bound to ask what it really is about. I'm not sure, but there are a number of possibilities. Since it is the moviemaker's dream more than that of the characters within, it seems to be a consideration of today's women. It's not a narrative in any strict sense but a contemplation of three stages of a woman's life by a man who appreciates women and may not be without a bit of guilt. It's also about youth and age and (as are all Altman films) about the quality of American life. Let it go at that and don't worry too much.Having no easily discernible surface logic, ""3 Women"" must depend on internal logic, and this only falters when Mr. Altman loads his dream with more or less conventional dreams within, when we are given superimposed images, standard nightmare visions and images seen through water. This fanciness is unnecessary. ""3 Women"" is most strange and poetic when it's played straight, as when poor Millie one night comes upon an elderly couple making love, or when someone says cheerily of a character in a deep coma, ""I'm sure she'll wake up when she sees you.""Logic has nothing to do with films' effeciveness, though it does with all of the performances, beginning with Miss Duvall's. In this film Miss Spacek adds a new dimension of eeriness to the waif she played so effectively in ""Carrie."" Also noteworthy are Miss Rule, Mr. Fortier and veteran actor-director John Cromwell and his real-life wife, Ruth Nelson, who play Pinky's possible parents.""3 Women,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some nudity and one scene of discreetly photographed sexual intercourse.",1977-04-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: A Festival of the Unrecognized,"FILM FESTIVALS are the worst possible circumstances in which to see movies that are of somewhat less than spellbinding interest. The competition for our attention at a festival, as well as the expectations created by the nature of a festival (which, I always assume, should be a celebration), guarantees a certain number of disappointments. Truly good movies are no problem. They are as tough as they are rare. They hold up no matter what goes on around them while lesser, even quite decent movies suffer dearly. They are vulnerable. It's as if mediocrity were a contagious disease.These thoughts are prompted by the sixth annual New Directors/New Films series starting today at the Museum of Modern Art. At this writing I've seen six of the 12 films that will be shown in the minifestival, sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the museum's film department, but I haven't yet seen one that could be said to make the entire occasion worth the time, effort and funding that have gone into it.It's unfortunate that film festivals are as locked into annual models as Detroit. Some years it might be better to pass  to admit that the festival material simply wasn't there.Because the films in this series have no common denominator other than hat each is the work of as yet unrecognized film makers, I deal with them separately in the chronological order in which they'll be screened at the museum.""When Joseph Returns"" (today at 6 P.M., Sunday at 8:30 P.M.) is an unsentimental Hungarian film about the edgy relationship between a middle-aged woman and her young, restless daughter-in-law when the son/husband goes to sea for six months. The film, directed and written by Zsolt Kesdi Kovacs, is beautifully acted by Lili Monori as the younger woman and Eva Ruttkai as the mother-in-law, and though the outcome is never in doubt, the manner in which the two women arrive at mutual understanding is surprisingly harrowing in its close-up details.The girl, whose life had previously been more or less determined by equal doses of television and sex, is a slob, though an extremely pretty one, a person who never stands unsupported if there's a wall to lean against. At first she misses her husband, then resents his absence and eventually she tears loose to enjoy herself, which, of course, she doesn't. ""When Joseph Returns"" is the sober sort of movie that one can admire without really liking it a lot.""The First Swallow"" (today at 8:30 P.M., Sunday at 6 P.M.) has the determined jollity of a political operetta. The Russian (Georgian) film, directed by Nana Mchedlidze, is about the efforts of some ferociously quaint Georgian men to organize themselves into a respectable soccer team at the turn of the century, but if you think that's all it's about, you are wrong. The fellow who pulls the team together and keeps their spirits up is a dead-ringer for Uncle Joe Stalin. The acting and often epic-looking photography are terrible.""11x14"" (Saturday at 8:30 P.M. and Monday at 6 P.M.) is an independent American film, ""conceived and executed"" (say the credits) by James Benning. The objective of the film, according to Mr. Benning, is ""to formulate a number of ideas using methods that are conventionally thought to be contradictory to the ideas themselves. The contradictions are used to develop a continual feeling of paradox."" For paradox read impatience.Mr. Benning's way of creating a new narrative form is to dispense with narrative completely. The film is composed of fragmentary scenes sometimes shot with a stationary camera, of landscape, viaducts, highways, fields, people getting in and out of automobiles, two women making love, a number of golfers teeing off, each in his/her turn.Though Mr. Benning claims to have conceived and then executed his movie, I suspect it was made the other way around. ""11 x 14"" looks to have been assembled from available fragments, some not very well photographed, and then justified by program notes on the order of ""'11 x 14' is also an attempt to create spherical time-space. The editing structure emphasizes the inherent linear quality of film. . . .""""Anatomy of A Relationship"" (Tuesday at 6 P.M. and next Friday at 8:30 P.M.) is a funny French film, jointly directed by Antonietta Pizzorno and Luc Moullet, in which a liberated young woman (Christine Herbert) and her cheerfully chauvinist lover (Mr. Moullet) try to reach some accord on her demands that she too receive sexual satisfaction. He calls himself ""natural."" She sniffs that he is only ""traditional.""Mr. Moullet is especially comic as he attempts to deal with a girl who is completely normal except for saying things like ""I feel I'm in touch with my body again."" He vows to give up sex for bicycling, that being a relationship he can ""dominate,"" but it's not really the same thing. As he rides around Paris he finds himself envying all nonintellectuals who, in his fantasies, never have sex hang-ups. The movie goes a bit self-conscious at the end when the actors discuss their roles with the director, but until then it's true comedy.""Coming of Age"" (Tuesday at 8:30 P.M. and next Friday at 6 P.M.) is an East German film directed by a young Iranian, Sohrab Shahid Saless, with the sort of obsessive concern for literal detail that, with repetition, is meant to become a kind of poetry. The movie never quite succeedsone is never unaware of its compositionthough it is nicely acted by 9-year-old Mike Henning, who, in the course of things, comes to realize that his mother (Eva Manhardt) is a whore.""Local Color"" (Wednesday at 8:30 P.M. and Saturday, April 23 at 6 P.M.) is a failed attempt to make a camp melodrama in the style of the Kuchar brothers. It's the work of Mark Rappaport, a fellow who all too often means to be facetious, as if he believed consciously heavy-handed parodies of soap opera could somehow find layers of truth behind the jokes. They don't. The purposely dense plot concerns, among others, a set of incestuous twins, an amorous barber and the barber's dissatisfied wife.One actressJane Campbellalmost makes the film sit-throughable, though. Looking like a young Alice Ghostley in her ""Boston Beguine"" days, her mouth always turned down, she wears an expression of earnest reproach that, for reasons that I don't understand, seems very funny under the circumstances. The rest of the film, however, is more than a teeny tiny bit precious.",1977-04-15T05:00:00+0000

It could be a scene from Luis Buuel at his most scathingly sacrilegious, but the passion and wit are missing, the vigor and the venom.Sunlight floods the branches of a forest as a tense maiden with silvery tresses picks her way gingerly along a leaf-strewn path. It could be a scene from Bo Widerberg in prettily pastoral mood, but the pulsating music on the soundtrack is Scarlatti, not Mozart, and the presumably pure wanderer is soon to shed her powdered wig and fragile frock and tumble into an illicit, bittersweet liaison with a lover far more forceful, and furry, than any man ever to stir the dreams of Elvira Madigan, or even Jessica Lange in ""King Kong.""The syrupy, hypocritical prelate and the lascivious lass with the deceptively delicate air represent flip sides of a tarnished coin in ""The Beast,"" a sleazy blend of fairy tale, Freudian foolishness and Eighth Avenue peep show. Written and directed by Walerian Borowczyka Polish migr to Paris who has been praised for such bizarrely erotic works as ""Immoral Tales"" and ""Story of Sin""this unsavory descent into black comedy focuses on the scheme of a decadent marquis to marry off his only sonan imbecilic oat who is obessessed with the mating habits of horsesto a stunning, sexually repressed heiress, a blond nitwit given to elaborate masturbatory fantasies, one of which centers on a rumored relationship between an ancestor of her prospective husband and a rapacious creature of the forest.There are occasional flashes of humor in ""The Beast."" For the most part, however, Mr. Borowczyk's handling of his actors and his themes is sledgehammer-heavy, painfully in keeping with his evident contempt for humanity.

us,'Jabberwocky' Monster Film With Heart,"The time is the mythic long-ago, a period after the eclipse of Camelot, but not yet the time of recorded history. The place is the kingdom of Bruno The Questionable, who is not a bad tyrant under the circumstances. Bruno's realm is being ravaged by a monster so terrible that the sight of it once turned an old peasant's teeth snow-white over night.Who will slay the monster to restore law and disorder, thus to win half of the Princess's hand and all of the kingdom (or perhaps it's the other way around)? From the opening sequence of ""Jabberwocky,"" there's no doubt but that it must be Dennis-the-cooper's-son. Dennis (Michael Palin), disowned by his father in an embarrassing deathbed speech (his father was out of sorts), is the quintessential naif. Being profoundly and cheerfully stupid, slavishly faithful to the obese Griselda, polite in all situations, and ever optimistic, Dennis is fate's triumphant plaything.He is also the hero of ""Jabberwocky,"" the most marvelously demented British comedy to come along since ""Monty Python and The Holy Grail,"" to which ""Jabberwocky"" is a sort of stepson. The film, which opened yesterday at the Cinema 1, was directed by Terry Gilliam, who co-directed ""The Holy Grail"" and is, like Mr. Palin, a member of the group that calls itself Monty Python's Flying Circus.Taking as their inspiration some lines from Lewis Carroll's ""Through The Looking-Glass,"" (""Beware the Jabberwock (my son!/The jaws that bite, the claws that catch. . . .""), Mr. Gilliam and Charles Alverson, with whom he collaborated on the screenplay, have written a wickedly literate spoof of everything from ""Jaws"" through ""Ivanhoe"" to ""The Faerie Queen.""It's a monster film with heart, a movie romance with bite, a costume picture without zippers, and a comedy with more blood and gore than Sam Peckinpah would dare use to dramatize the decline and fall of the entire West.The world through which Dennis stumbles ever upward is an unending landscape of misery, torture, filth, slop buckets, sudden death, and all-round decay""Jabberwocky's"" comment on movie makers' comparatively recent obsession with showing us the past as it supposedly really was.Mr. Palin's Dennis is a fully realized comic character as much because he seems a mite old to be so innocent as because of his sturdy faith in his own small goals. All Dennis wants to do is to make his way enough to be able to claim the hand of the grouchy, overfed Griselda, but fortune keeps smiling on him. By chance he finds himself squire to the knight chosen to slay the monster, and eventually the sole survivor of the battle with a creature that looks like something out of a medieval Sesame Street.The movie's gags are nonstop, both verbal and visual, with lots of cross-references. ""At last,"" proclaim the movie's ads, ""a movie for the squeamish!"" though some audiences may find the blood and scatology difficult to take. If there's anything unpleasant to be walked under or stepped into, Dennis will find it.Supporting Mr. Palin are a number of excellent character actors, many of whom are unknown to me. They include Max Wall as King Bruno, Warren Mitchell as Dennis's would-be father-in-law, and Harry H. Corbett as a squire who's fallen upon bad times. The performances are fine, but even more remarkable for a comedy of this sort are Roy Smith's stylish production design and the camera work of Terry Bedford.""Jabberwocky"" is very funny, yet it looks like an epic.",1977-04-16T05:00:00+0000

That clause bans any food additive that is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Since no human had ever been shown to suffer cancer from saccharin and since at least some humans with diabetes and severe obesity problems felt a need for artificial sweeteners, the clause was exposed as foolishly rigid. It must be altered.",1977-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,ART VIEW,"For almost as long as anyone can remember, the English art movement known as Vorticism, which came into existence on the eve of the First World War, has been a subject of greater importance to writers and literary scholars than to painters or art historians or connoisseurs of the visual arts. The reasons for this are not mysterious. The central animating figure of Vorticism was Wyndham Lewis, who has proved to be of far greater interest to posterity as a writer than as a painter. Lewis's most energetic collaborator in promoting Vorticism was Ezra Pound, an even more commanding and influential writer than Lewis himself. As an avantgarde movement, moreover, Vorticism suffered the further handicapa handicap, at least, when it came to impressing itself upon the consciousness of later generations of artists and art historiansof failing to win the support of the greatest English art critic of the Vorticist period, Roger Fry.

At least we had the elegance to pretend to ignore it. So what shall we do with the news that the British Noise Advisory Council found the Concorde considerably noisier than subsonic commercial aircraft? It found the noise spread over a much wider area and said it caused deterioration of the noise climate around London's Heathrow Airport.

us,Film: Animated Evil,"IF RALPH BAKSHI'S ""Fritz the Cat"" and ""Heavy Traffic"" were as explicit as, say, sex and their X ratings, his ""Wizards,"" which arrived in local theaters yesterday avoids that stigma. It offers ample proof once again that Mr. Bakshi has no connection with the sunlit Disney school of animated fantasy. But in concentrating on the distant future and a war between the surviving forces of good and evil in a ravaged world, ""Wizards"" evolves, at best, as only a mildly interesting mixture of clashing polemics and shoot-'em-up melodrama.Of course, he has fashioned a fable, but one that is as contemporary as Hitler. His ""Wizards"" are brothers in the persons of Avatar, the leader of the good guys, and Blackwolf, chieftain of the opposing, mutant bad guys, whose techniques of intimidation and attack are literally borrowed from Nazi Germany.Mr. Bakshi's allegory is fairly obvious from the outset, but he and his animators are convincingly professional. They have devised a melange of animation and live footage that gives their feature mystical, slightly scary and, occasionally, comic tones.A couple of frightened elves praying in a Yiddish-Hebrew gibberish is neither relevant nor funny. But Avatar is a bumbling, aged magician, whoshades of Disney!looks a bit like a bearded Grumpy and speaks like Archie Bunker. The film's nubile queen, Elinore, is wispily clad and curvaceous enough to make Snow White blush. And a cadaverous Blackwolf, Avatar's tough, little general, Weehawk, as well as a slew of elves, fairies and a zoo of far-out fauna, are colorful creations.""Animation can be used to tell all kinds of stories."" Mr. Bakshi said after the arrival of the iconoclastically sexy and hip ""Fritz the Cat"" and ""Heavy Traffic."" And, that observation also applied to his ensuing, controversial ""Coonskin."" With ""Wizards"" he has ably illustrated his ability to tell another kind of story, but one that merely restates the already all too obvious, dire results of nuclear war and man's inhumanity to man.This film has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") probably because of its violent war scenes.",1977-04-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film Forum: Charles Ives And Harry Partch, 2 originals","THANKS TO the new program at the Film Forum, the decidedly unusual characters of two gifted, proud, unreconstructed musical loners, Charles Ives and Harry Partch, are brought into colorful focus in screen treatments that, however partial, do them and their innovative work a deserved service.As the more ambitious subject, the feature-length ""A Good Dissonance Like a Man"" is a dramatization that, through meticulous use of authentic sources and places, leaves the satisfying impression of fact-filled, documentary truth. Charles Ives, in this case, is not a misty legend. He is the boy immersed in music by his father, a musician and experimenter whose diversions from musical norms rubbed off in historic style on the son.If Ives is now regarded as one of America's greatest composers, recognition of his avant-garde tonal works, the film makes clear, came late in his career. The film traces major influences on the composer's lifethe inspiration of the New England countryside, his heritage, college days at Yale, his happy, if illness-plagued, family life, the insurance business that made him well-to-do and free to compose in his own time and own way and, above all, his rebellion against musical regimentationto evoke a three-dimensional, all-too-human artist.The characterizations of the principals are realistic and convincing, as are the taped, narrated reminiscences of relatives and friends. And, they are colorfully abetted by scenes shot at family homes and at Yale. One may yearn for more of the Ives music (and its identification) than we get here, but it is obvious that Theodore W. Timreck, the producer-director, and his associates have given us, not dissonance, but a lucid and vivid portrait of an extraordinary man.The 27-minute study of Partch, filmed in California in 1973, a year before his death, is largely an interview but he, too, emerges as a man decidedly apart from the crowd. White-bearded, thin and casually dressed, he projects his musical and social views simply and directlyrecollections of the hobo's life in the West, his youth, the Depression.The weird instruments he invented and builta 72-string, lyrelike cithara, glass bells cut from bottles, and the likewere designed to fit his individualistic compositions, music often inspired by the times and the places in which he lived. Although the film is merely an excerpt from the annals of a full and fulfilled life, it makes its ""dreamer"" strikingly real.",1977-04-22T05:00:00+0000

us,6 New Films by New Directors,"For those who may want to see some of the entries in the second half of the New Directors/New Films series currently at the Museum of Modern Art, the following comments are presented in the chronological order in which the films will be shown. The series, sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum's department of film, ends Wednesday.""Well-Spring of My World,"" tonight at 8:30, is a sad, gently rueful Danish documentary in which its director, Christian Braad Thomsen, returns to the tiny town where he grew up to interview old friends and reflect on the once rich, fertile countryside that's being gobbled up by housing projects and superhighways. Most of Mr. Thomsen's subjects seem slightly inhibited by the camera, but the stories they tell are occasionally very moving and surprisingly poignant.""Rubber Gun"" and ""The Preparatory, ""Sunday, 6 P.M., and Tuesday, 8:30 P.M., is one of the better programs to be offered in this series. ""Rubber Gun"" is a 90-minute Canadian feature directed by Allan Moyle and written by him and Stephen Lack, both of whom are also actors in the film, which appears to be as much improvised as conventionally planned and directed.The film, a tombstone marking the end of the drug culture, concerns the coming apart of a group of young Canadian druggies and pushers pursued by time and the cops. It's one of those movies in which you're never sure who's giving a performance and who's simply allowing the camera to record him. There is a difference. ""Rubber Gun"" will be released here commercially later this year, at which time it will be reviewed.""The Preparatory,"" written and directed by Terence Cahalan, an American, is an effective, clear-eyed unsentimental remembrance of life in a Catholic preparatory school. The film, Mr. Cahalan's master's project, shows talent and discipline. Running time: 25 minutes.""Brandos Costumes,"" also known as ""Mild Manners"" and ""Gentle Customs,"" Sunday, 8:30 P.M., and Tuesday, 6 P.M., is the first feature of a Portuguese director named Alberto Seixas Santos and is by far the most ambitious and interesting feature in the current program.The film intercuts between old newsreel footage and highly theatrical, sometimes melodramatic, tableaux to draw parallels between the late Portuguese dictator Dr. Antnio de Oliveira Salazar and a typical, upper middle-class family man who is a free-thinking liberal outside his house and a tyrant at home. Not all of the associations are clear to someone not familiar with recent Portuguese history, but the film's bold style, which copies no contemporary director I can think of, and its wit and passion are worth attention.""Devices and Desires"" and ""Elizbeth Swados  the Girl With the Incredible Feeling,"" Monday, 8:30 P.M., and Wednesday, 6 P.M. are a mixed bag.Giles Foster's ""Devices and Desires"" (55 minutes) is a fond picture of an eccentric, early 19th-century English clergyman named John Skinner. In Mr. Foster's film he is brought up to date, named Granville Moulton and played with fine, understated madness by Frederick Treves. Mr. Moulton is convinced that he has discovered the ruins of the Roman capital of Britain and digs at his site instead of attending to his parishioners.We never know the reasons behind the old man's obsession which eventually alienates even those who would like to help him, but we can appreciate its hold on him, as well as his impatience with the dull world around him. ""Weddings, christenings and funerals,"" says the testy message on Mr. Moulton's telephone-recording mechine, ""state your business.'""Elizabeth Swados"" is something else. It, too, is a fond picture of its subject, the gifted young woman who sings, plays and composes for the contemporary theater, but it's hardly more than a grab bag of impressions by the director, Linda Feferman.The 37-minute film uses a lot of footage shot by other people, including home movies shot by Miss Swados' loving parents. There is also a quite nice cartoon based on a children's book written by Miss Swados, about a girl who had an incredible feeling, pictured as an amorphous mass that looks like a bag of laundry, which disappeared when it was explained. Something of the same sort happens when you try to explain Miss Swados.""L'Affiche Rouge,"" Monday, 6 P.M., and Wednesday, 8:30 P.M., is one of those movies that sound much more interesting to hear about than they ever are to watch. It's about a group of Parisian actors who plan to make a movie about the Manounchian Band, a group of left-wing resistance fighters, mostly young and mostly foreign, who were executed by the Nazis in the last months of the German occupation.As the actors gather at the studio for a picnic, they try on costumes, dance, act out brief scenes from the film they want to make, discuss the meanings of their roles and generally try to persuade us of the importance of the project.The film, in French, was directed by Frank Cassenti. It strains very hard to look improvised and politically committed, but it only seems phony, arch and self-important. The cast includes Pierre Clementi, who has probably made more appearances in failed avant-garde films than any other actor of his generation.",1977-04-23T05:00:00+0000

Every spring the official press warns Soviet citizens against the horrors of ideological contamination from Western bourgeois tourists; the incentive is in the dollars and other hard currency that visitors spend. Moscow still cannot compete with the comforts that Western capitals offer, but a genuine effort has been made to ease the tourist's lot. The state travel monopoly, Intourist, has tried to reduce the bureaucratic hassle to modest Soviet proportions. A successful visit to Moscow demands curiosity and good humor but can be well rewarded, particularly this year as the Soviet Union girds up to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Revolution.",1977-04-24T05:00:00+0000

us,SELECTION,"DURING the last months of the German occupation, Rome took on the appearance of certain Indian metropolises where only the vultures get enough to eat and there is no census of the living and the dead. A multitude of beggars and refugees, driven from their destroyed villages, camped on the steps of the churches or below the Pope's palaces; and in the great public parks starving sheep and cows grazed, having escaped the bombs and the confiscations in the countryside. Despite the declaration of open city, the Germans were encamped around the inhabited area, speeding along the consular roads in the clatter of their vehicles; and the disastrous cloud of the air raids, which constantly crossed the territory of the province, spread over the city a great tarpaulin of pestilence and earthquake. The windowpanes in the house shook day and night, the sirens wailed, squadrons clashed in the sky amid yellowish rockets, and every now and then in some outlying street, with a thunderclap, a dustcloud of ruin burst up. Certain frightened families had settled in the airraid shelters or in the labyrinthine basements of the great monuments, where there was a stagnant odor of urine and feces. In the de luxe hotels requisitioned by the Reich Commands and guarded by armed sentries, fantastic suppers were held, where the waste was obsessive, to the point of indigestion and vomiting; and in there, at the supper tables, the massacres for the next day were orchestrated. The Commander, who had himself called King of Rome, was a big compulsive eater and drinker, and alcohol was the customary stimulant and narcotic for the occupiers, both at the High Command and in the lower ranks. In secondary, remote streets of the city, you could remark some little building or villa, in middleclass style, with rows of windows recently walled up on the various floors. They were former offices, or familystyle boarding houses, now converted by the occupying police forces into torture chambers. Inside, all the wretches infected with the vice of death found employment, like their Fhrer, masters at last of living, helpless bodies for their perverse practices. From inside those buildings, day and night, there often came a deafening din of cheap dance music and songs from gramophones turned up to full volume.",1977-04-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Growing Up American,"IN the complex and everchanging movement of history there is something undeniably basic, even universal, about the human life cycle. We all start small, grow up and grow old, just as the countless generations of our forebears have done. And yet such experiences are universal only in a biological sense; their context, their inner shape, and their personal significance differ markedly from one time and place to another. A small army of scholars has fastened on these points of difference, making the history of the life cycle into a flourishing research enterprise. The trend was begun some 20 years ago with the appearance of an extraordinary book by the French historian Philippe Aries, published in this country somewhat later under the title Centuries of Childhood. Aries's work quickly raised up a host of followers on both sides of the Atlantic, and histories of childhood have since multiplied rapidly.",1977-04-24T05:00:00+0000

Dotted with lakes and crisscrossed with rivers, it offers attractions ranging from the rugged, desolate fishermen's coastline of the southwest to the spectacular mountainous scenery of Cape Breton in the northeast. In between are the lush hilly orchards and farmland of the Annapolis Valley. Fall, when the leaves are turning and the bulk of the tourists have left, is an ideal time for a visit.

us,"'Jacob the Liar,' a Film About the Polish Ghetto","World War II film records of the attenuated terrors of Polish ghetto life are all too familiar now, but ""Jacob the Liar"" tempers the terrible truth in serio-comic style. Of course, laughter is not precisely what Frank Beyer, the director, and Jurek Becker, who adapted his own novel to the screen, had in mind, but they make Jacob's falsehoods the courageous and often lightly funny stuff that bound a doomed people together momentarily in hope.As an East German production and one of the five candidates for this year's foreign-language Academy Award, ""Jacob the Liar,"" which opened at the Plaza yesterday, is surprisingly devoid of anything resembling Communist propaganda. And, in focusing on Jewish ghetto inmates, the director and his scenarist pointedly stress the togetherness of these inmates as against the callousness of survival in, say, the concentration camp of Lina Wertmuller's ""Seven Beauties.""Their Jacob Heym, once a cafe owner, is now simply one of the town's downtrodden, unkempt laborers under Nazi occupation forces who, by chance, overhears a radio communiqu in local Gestapo headquarters about Russian victories in the vicinity. And our woebegone hero then passes the happy news to other Jews, stating with underplayed pride that he heard it on his own clandestine radio. Naturally, his neighbors, clinging to this newly found promise of deliverance, demand more news daily and our increasingly reluctant Jacob is forced to invent it.As a series of vignettes, ""Jacob the Liar"" illustrates recollections of a happier past and the glimmer of cheer as well as the fear of reprisals felt by the ghetto's inmates. Henry Hubchan and Blanche Kommerell, a pretty brunette, grasp desperately for moments of love in a crowded, decrepit room. Dezso Garas and Suzana Gordon, as Miss Kommerell's actor-parents, cower in anticipation of a concentration camp destiny, and, Envin Geschonneck, gives a sensitive performance as a former barber and close friend of Jacob, who resorts to the grimmest solution when hope is lost.Vlastimil Brodsky, a noted Czech actor, is forceful, funny and poignant as the ever helpful, if married, Jacob, whose sad, sagging face mirrors the tragedy of the ghetto's plight. He is nobly abetted by Manuela Simon, an endearing natural, pretty little moppet, playing his inquisitive niece, whom he entertains in one charming scene by imitating Winston Churchill's sonorous voice as it seemingly emerges from his alleged radio.Although English subtitles make the action clear, a viewer may be disturbed by some abrupt transitions and by Poles speaking German. But if there is little doubt as to the drama's inevitable, tragic denouement, ""Jacob the Liar"" is, in effect, a heartwarming saga and one that illustrates Mark Twain's observation that ""courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, and not the absence of fear.""",1977-04-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Japanese Suds,"TORO-SAN, the Intellectual,"" a new feature which today opens a two-day stand in the Japanese film revival series at the Regency Theater, is proof that East and West can meet on some cultural levels. In the case of this ""Toro-San,"" the Orients customs may still be somewhat exotic but the succession of joys, sorrows and misconceptions are as Western as any soap opera.This is not meant to denigrate the sudsy but obviously profitable techniques of those enduring television sagas. Like them, this latest Toro-San adventure, reportedly the 17th filmed in the last eight years starring the title character, ranks among the most popular film series with Japanese moviegoers. But the work of Yoji Yamada, who wrote and directed many of them, isexcept for a retrospective showing of 11 Toro-San features he presented at the Japan Society here last Januaryfairly unfamiliar in local houses.His current ""Toro-San"" is the same simple, unlettered, kindly, bumbling wanderer who manages to get himself into and out of scrapes while scattering good deeds along the way. This time, he returns home to the candy shop run by his uncle, aunt, sister and brother-in-law only to find himself accused of being the father of the pretty 17-year-old girl waiting for him.Toro is guiltless, of course; he was only the self-effacing benefactor of the girl and her late mother, whom he befriended when she was deserted by her husband. Those misunderstandings do pile up, however.On a visit to the mother's grave, a priest instructs the nave Toro to ""know yourself, it's never too late to learn."" And, before you can say sayonara, he's smitten by a demure, attractive archeology student  a roomer with his familyand he's off and running clownishly toward becoming an ""intellectual"" with her help.Naturally, the results are bittersweet but unrewarding for all. There's a middle-aged, girl-shy archeology professor who thinks he's been spurned by his pupil, who happens to be Toro's teacher. Toro is equally confused by her purely platonic intentions and, obviously, the lady is left unrequited.His script may be convoluted and his direction uneven, but Mr. Yamada is decidedly professional in shaping a colorful and briskly moving story. No amount of English subtitles fully clarifies his opening sequencepresumably a fantasy shoot-'em-up showdown in an old western saloonthat is a larger-than-life lampoon only vaguely related to subsequent events. But there's little doubt that Mr. Yamada and his cast project contemporary Japanese family life and ties realistically and affectionately.As Toro, Kiyoshi Atsumi is an endearing buffoon whose love for his clan and others is unmistakably honest while he endures their jibes about his oafishness, his ""square face"" and the unnecessary glasses he takes to wearing during his brief schooling.The town, its streeets and shops, the wooded hills, and a pick-up baseball game, add to the color of the comedy-drama. If, like soap operas everywhere, this ""Toro-San"" seems to be much ado about nothing that is momentous, it generally manages to be genuinely warm and charming.",1977-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Good Reading 'Between the Lines',"BETWEEN THE LINES???,"" the second feature by Joan Micklin Silver (""Hester Street""), is an appealing, low-key, counter-culture newspaper comedy, meaning that it doesn't have a great deal of conventional newspaper narrative, though toward the end someone does tell ""the kid,"" a would-be reporter who has just come up with his first scoop, ""You're going to nail those punks with that story!""The newspaper in question is The Back Bay Mainline, a Boston weekly that suggests both The Boston Phoenix and The Real Paper, which is not terribly surprising because the film was written by Fred Barron, who once worked on each.Like so many once-underground papers today. The Mainline and the members of its staff are going through an identity crisis. Founded in the late 1960's, when there were easily recognized battles to be fought, the formerly hard-swinging, radical, antiwar paper has grown fat. It's running out of causes. The Mainline is so profitable, in fact, that a newspaper tycoon is negotiating to buy it.Harry (John Heard)???, The Mainline's chief investigative reporter, a fellow who once won a national journalism award for a series exposing nursing home scandals, is suffering from career-bends. He tells Abbie (Lindsay Crouse), a pretty, still-ambitious photographer who is his occasional girlfriend, ""It isn't exciting anymore."" No matter how many exposs one writes, nothing ever changes.Michael (Stephen Collins), who made his reputation reporting on the activities of flower children, hippies, yippies and druggies, is planning a book on the counterculture years. Even before he has received his advance, he has started to talk in the vocabulary of the literary hustlers who never put finger to typewriter before knowing the probably financial disposition of all of the subsidiary rights. You know he's going to be the perfect talk-show guest.Laura (Gwen Welles), who lives with Michael and says every other day that she's leaving him, is also a reporter but one with no great drive. When Michael decides to move to New York, Laura at first refuses to tag along. She has her own career, her own friends, she says, but then she changes her mind. It's probably her first major compromise. Max (Jeff Goldblum), the paper's rock critic and resident comic, talks big but he, too, compromises at the first sign of a crunch.""Between the Lines"" is, technically, I suppose, a newspaper film, but what distinguishes it is the gently perceptive way it captures the emotional confusions of its characters. They are young, talented, ambitious people who once had the great good fortune to be enthusiastically committed and to have had professional lives that were the same as their private lives. Just how lucky they were they begin to realize only now that the time has passed. The 1960's have become their roaring 20's.""Between the Lines"" is about growing up after you've already grown up. Harry, the investigative reporter, experiences his first intimations of obsolescence at 30. He's suddenly baffled by the fact that Abbie continues to enjoy her jobit's as if he'd never really known her. They quarrel, break up and come back together, but each knows that it will never be the same again.Somewhere in ""Life on the Mississippi"" Mark Twain remembers coming into Hannibal for the first time after he received his pilot's license. The river was no longer beautiful to him. Unusual ripples on the surface had become warnings of new shoals. A brilliant red sunset was simply a weather forecast. He'd lost something very precious and he had to move on.So do Mrs. Silver's characters and ""Between the Lines"" is at its best when it ambles in and out of their lives, over-hearing lovers' quarrels, professional conflicts, office politics. It's not so convincing when it tries to work along conventional plot lines that have to do with the selling of the paper and with some underworld activities. Then it's awkward and amateurish.Not so the performances, which are uniformly first-rate, the kind of ensemble work in which no actor is more or less important than another. That includes Jeff Goldblum, who has received a good deal of publicity as the nutty rock critic. His is a more colorful role, but Mr. Heard, Mr. Collins, Miss Crouse and Miss Welles are quite special, too.Among other things, ""Between the Lines"" is one of the few films I've seen dealing with the counterculture years that doesn't rip it off or send it up. Time, says Mrs. Silver, catches up, even with the young.",1977-04-28T05:00:00+0000

He had worn 4 as a Quebec teenager while Jean Beliveau was wearing 4 with the Canadiens but Jean Beliveau had just retired and 4 was available. The rookie asked his idol for permission to wear it. If you want 4, take it, Jean Beliveau told him. But why add to the pressure already on you? Why not take another number and make it yours? Guy Lafleur took 10 and made it his. And as the Canadiens await tonight's resumption of their Stanley Cup semifinal with the Islanders at the Nassau Coliseum, the hockey player known as Flower (the English translation of his name) is making another number his. A number nobody knows yet. It will be the eventual number of his remarkable record for scoring either a goal or an assist in consecutive games.

us,Screen: A German 'Wild Duck',"THE DENSITY of the pain in any Ibsen play has to do not only with the accumulation in time of tragic, misbegotten deeds but also with the playing area of the stage. As his characters are locked into their lives, they are caged in theater sets.Double doors at the rear may lead to an inner room, and stairs at stage left suggest the existence of another floor. Yet there is no true escape from the small, realistically furnished, 19th-century interior landscape that, as often as not in Ibsen, is a living room. In English, if not in Norwegian, that's a joke. By the time we reach the fifth Ibsen act the feeling of confinement has become so intense that violence is inevitable.This is one of the reasons why Ibsen's plays don't easily translate from stage to films, which are as big as all outdoors. It is also one of the achievements of Hans W. Geissendorfer's German-language adaptation of ""The Wild Duck"" that this physical evocation of emotional pressure is not lost in his very moving film.""The Wild Duck,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, has no spectacular performance to equal Glenda Jackson's in the film version of ""Hedda Gabler"" last year, but its spirit seems truer to Ibsen, even with necessarily foreshortened English subtitles translating the German dialogue.Mr. Geissendorfer, the young German director who created considerable interest here five years ago with an elegant vampire film called ""Jonathan,"" has cut the text a bit and shifted some of it around. The point of his treatment, though, is not to modernize the original in any way but to make us respond to and understand the conventions of one of Ibsen's best-made plays.In no other work by the Norwegian playwright, whom Shaw ranked (along with himself, of course) ahead of Shakespeare, has so much rotten business been going on for so long before the beginning of Act One, which must tempt the film director to find all sorts of cinematic equivalents for the exposition spoken on stage. Mr. Geissendorfer resists all this and sticks to the fury at hand, an ironic self-appraisal by a playwright who had once championed idealism so forcefully.The time is 1884 and the setting is a small Norwegian city where Hjalmar (Peter Kern), a good-natured, self-deluding, former member of the bourgeoisie, lives happily with his wife, Gina (Jean Seberg), his daughter, Hedwig (Anne Bennent), and his disgraced old father.Into this placid family circle comes Hjalmar's old schoolmate, Gregers (Bruno Ganz), whose mission is to make people see the lies they live in order to attain the enlightenment of truth. In so doing he destroys the family and, it seems likely, himself.Mr. Geissendorfer opens up the play but not in such a way that he lets the life out of it. The camera moves freely around Hjalmar's tidily run-down flat, from the studio where Gina runs his photography business to the adjacent attic where the senile grandfather stalks game (penned-in rabbits) and where Hedwig keeps her wild duck.There are brief glimpses of the outside worlda barroom, the courtyard of the apartment buildingbut none of these has the effect of diminishing the drama of financial fraud and concealed parenthood that's being revealed in breathtaking order upstairs.With the exception of Miss Seberg, who is too chicly beautiful to be believable as the sort of waddling, once-ripe housemaid she's supposed to be, the casting is nearly perfect.Anne Bennent is a lovely Hedwig with her open, solemn face and her way of walking with her hands drawn to her sides, as if she were always afraid of breaking something. Peter Kern, who has appeared here in Fassbinder films and looks a bit like Gene Wilder, is less comic than one expects as the foolish Hjalmar, but he has a kind of witty self-importance that makes the character more easily tolerable. The star, though, is Bruno Ganz, fanatically self-assured as the terrifying idealist who, you know, is himself teetering on the edge of suicide.The color photography is uncommonly goodnot so dramatically under-lighted that one feels the need of wiping one's glasses, but soft and a little smoky, as if one should open the windows of the flat. They would do just that except that it's midwinter and the choice is either to have clean air and freeze or to put up with leaky flues and cooking odors to stay warm. The cold finally does invade their lives, but it is bitter truth, which in this film can be physically felt.",1977-04-29T05:00:00+0000
