Jackson, who sustained a career-threatening hip injury while running the football for the Los Angeles Raiders three months ago, was released last month by his baseball team, the Kansas City Royals, after the team doctor concluded that the outfielder's career might be over. During the two-week waiver period that followed, no team showed an interest in taking on his $2.4 million Royals contract with no guarantee that he could play. But then Jackson was up for bids, and the Chicago White Sox spoke up. The team will pay him as little as $700,000 for one year or, if his hip and his hitting hold up, as much as $8.15 million over three years. But the deal could mean more to Jackson than any White Sox pay check. Since his football days are over, the end of his baseball career might also have meant an end to his endorsements, which reportedly bring him about $5 million a year.",1991-04-07T05:00:00+0000

Originally the space reflected the building's 1930 vintage: there was a narrow pantry and almost no place to work. Spear removed the wall between the pantry and kitchen to make room for a breakfast area, and replaced the dark vinyl floors with bleached wood. She also added a central work island with cabinets above it.

The downtown area, once deserted after hours, now teems on weekends with crowds gathered at the spruced-up Plaza Park for festivals or free concerts.

And there are some memorable one-liners. For example, here's Brooklyn Dodger Manager Charlie Dressen: ""Just hold them for a few innings, fellas. I'll think of something."" Umpire Bill Klem: ""It ain't nothin' till I call it."" Mickey Mantle: ""All I have is natural ability."" Ernie's another natural, with a plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame. His first major-league broadcast was a Dodgers-Cubs game at Ebbets Field on Aug. 4, 1948, when he filled in for Red Barber. Since then Ernie has broadcast for the New York Giants, the Baltimore Orioles and, since 1960, the Detroit Tigers. What no one can understand is why the Tigers' management is cutting Ernie loose following the 1991 season. Are they nuts? No one in baseball does a better play-by-play. They expected criticism, but not the blast they got from fans all over the country. One theory holds that the Tigers management wants to jazz up the team's image and feels that Ernie, at the age of 73, has become old hat. They see the Detroit Pistons raking it in at their suburban Palace, entertaining a full house at every basketball game with rap music and light shows, and they think, yeah, that's the way to go. What the Tiger bosses must fail to realize is that baseball moves at a much different tempo. Rather than razzle-dazzle, it's heavy on tradition, nostalgia, stats comparing new stars with the old greats. It has a sense of humor and an image epitomized by Ernie Harwell and his comfortable down-home Georgia delivery. What makes baseball so popular is what ""Ernie Harwell's Diamond Gems"" is about: the kind of stuff fans love to read and talk about, presented by a guy you can listen to all night. If we didn't have a written language, I think Ernie Harwell would be known as one of our great tribal storytellers -- if he isn't already.",1991-04-07T05:00:00+0000

The fireworks will have to be considerable to compete with the Paris showings last month. The clothes shown here, by some of New York's top designers, were selected from previews before the French collections took place. They illustrate the fresh thinking taking place on this side of the Atlantic too. In general, hemlines will still be on the short side, but not as much as in the past. Nevertheless, most remain above the knee. Curving silhouettes are almost every designer's choice -- lines that mold to the bosom, torso and waist. Leggings finish off a suit as often as a skirt does. Louis Dell'Olio for Anne Klein is even planning ""a major statement"": stretch-velour leggings that are made all-in-one with high-heel pumps. Pull them on and the bottom half of an outfit is totally complete. The exceptions are slouchy pants suits, all mannish tailoring on the first take, but -- like those of Isaac Mizrahi (see page 70) -- revealing very feminine stuff underneath. Plenty of the fall drama will come from color, combinations thereof and unexpected uses of fabric. Tweed, for example, is a favorite for evening as well as day.

Others couldn't do without a luxurious bathroom or an organized closet or a spectacular view. Even gardeners make choices based on how they live: Early risers, for example, might plant morning glories. Setting limits often promotes creativity as well. Some of the most renowned architects have done their best work on a shoestring. And some of the most interesting collections have been assembled by antiques lovers with tight budgets and a selective eye. Selectivity, in fact, is emblematic of the 1990's.

A groundswell of outraged demands for Mr. Gates's resignation began last month after television news shows broadcast a videotape of white police officers brutally beating an unresisting black motorist. Mayor Bradley eventually joined the chorus, but noted that he was powerless to remove the Chief. The Bradley-appointed Police Commission came up with a compromise of sorts last week, putting Mr. Gates on a two-month paid leave. This would give the commission time to determine whether Mr. Gates's ""style, rhetoric and conduct contribute to police abuses,"" said the head a libertarian group that is pushing for the Chief's ouster.

Adding a Cylinder for Kick","Since the earliest automobiles, most cars have had two, four, six or eight cylinders. An even number of cylinders allows the up-and-down motion of each piston to be offset by another piston. An engine with an odd number of cylinders tends to vibrate more. Nevertheless, a few companies have used engines with three or five cylinders. Honda's new four-door Vigor comes with a five-cylinder engine (right) so as to pack more horsepower in a small engine compartment. Honda engineers dampened the vibration by careful timing of each piston's stroke. Their design also incorporates hydraulic devices at points where the engine is attached to the car's frame. The all-aluminum engine displaces 2.5 liters and produces 176 horsepower. By contrast, the Honda Accord has a 2.2 liter four-cylinder engine that produces 125 horsepower.",1991-04-07T05:00:00+0000

In rejecting him for the post -- the vote, along party lines, was 8 to 6 -- Democrats on the panel cited his continuing membership in a country club that excludes blacks and Jews. They also noted that several of his civil rights rulings had been reversed on appeal. One of the Democrats, Senator Joseph R.

Mr. Kloske, who is the Commerce Department's top export official, told a Congressional panel that he had expressed strong misgivings about allowing Iraq to import such ""dual-use"" products as computers and chemicals, and then tried to bog down such exports in red tape after the State Department ignored his warnings. One official who declined to be identified said that John H. Sununu, the White House Chief of Staff, had put in motion a demand for Mr. Kloske's resignation.

Still a Wonder","It has been compared to the bow of a ship, to a locomotive and, of course, to a flatiron. New Yorkers today know it only by its famous nickname, but when the Fuller Building -- as it was called originally -- was erected in 1903, it was one of the new century's wonders. Many ridiculed the architect Daniel Burnham when its triangular shape began to rise out of the construction site on East 23d Street, but the building quickly began to attract photographers. In FLATIRON: A Photographic History of the World's First Steel Frame Skyscraper, 1901-1990 (American Institute of Architects, $29.95), Peter Gwillim Kreitler, a photographer and collector, has assembled a superb collection of their images. Edward Steichen's moody, rain-soaked portrait is beautifully reproduced, as is Alfred Steiglitz' delicate snowscape. The Photo Secessionists presented the building as a natural phenomenon looming out of the bustle of the city. Later photographers saw it as a triumph of modernism. By shooting it from an oblique angle, the Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius made the building appear to tilt, revealing the avant-garde character lurking beneath its neo-Renaissance friezes. Alongside the familiar images in Mr. Kreitler's collection are little-known finds, like the haunting night view of the Flatiron lit up like a luxury liner, a host of lesser buildings trailing in its wake.",1991-04-14T05:00:00+0000

It was New Jersey's first victory away from the Meadowlands since Jan. 26 in Miami, and its first victory at the Capital Centre since March 17, 1986. Earlier this season, the Nets snapped a road losing streak at 34 games -- a league record since broken by Sacramento -- by winning at Phoenix on Nov. 23.

The victory kept Utah one game behind San Antonio, which won at Houston, in the race for first place in the Midwest Division. Both teams have two games left.

The Bonesmen had forewarned their alumni, President Bush among them, in a letter expressing the sort of anti-elitist feelings that have diminished the cachet of college secret societies generally. Letting women in, they said, might help change that. Well, maybe. In the meantime, however, the Rev. Sidney Lovett, secretary of the Bones's parent organization and apparently on its orders, nullified the selection of new members and shut the club down for the coming year.

us,Business Diary/April 14-19,"COMPANIES Judging from the rally in banking stocks last week, it would appear that defaults and delinquencies are a receding worry. But not necessarily. Several banks, including Chase Manhattan and some regionals like First Fidelity, posted sharp gains in their first-quarter profits -- a product of cost-cutting, the slowing growth of bad loans and falling interest rates. Falling rates enable banks to make money on the spread between what they pay depositors and what they charge borrowers, whose rates are not adjusted as quickly. These spreads are now their widest in years, bankers say, because they need to earn more on their good customers to make up for all the bad ones. But these benefits didn't buttress all banks. Chemical Bank, NCNB and Manfacturers Hanover all saw earnings slip. And Citicorp suffered the most. Its profits plunged 70 percent in the first quarter, to a bare $70 million. While bad real estate loans were the bane of bankers early in the downturn, souring consumer loans are a worry as the recession matures. They were to blame for the disappointing quarter at Citicorp, the nation's largest issuer of credit cards and home mortgages. So why the stock rally? The earnings held none of the surprises -- dividend cuts and big additions to loan loss reserves -- that accompanied earlier quarters.",1991-04-21T05:00:00+0000

Here are some of Mr. Gorbachev's statements, and some responses from Japanese businessmen whose funds he sought. He Said ""If we don't halt the disintegration of the state -- of the economy, the law, and relations between republics -- the country could fall into the chaos that gives birth to dictatorship. Despair and hopelessness are a serious threat to the progress of civilization. Advanced countries help themselves by helping others."" -- Mr. Gorbachev, speaking to the Japanese parliament. ""These are stormy times, and it is not easy to hold the wheel of the ship steady. Let's not lose time. Don't hold back from taking part in these great projects. Our Far East and Siberia have resources, but they lack the infrastructure to develop them. I appeal to Japanese companies to consider helping develop the region."" -- Mr. Gorbachev, speaking to business leaders. They Said ""The economic conditions and infrastructure in your country are inadequate. . . . Our countries have to resolve their political problems and your country must lay the groundwork for the transition to an orderly market economy. Long-term investment will require economic and political stability."" -- Gaishi Hiraiwa, president of Keidanren, the biggest Japanese business trade group. ""I don't think Japanese business people will be attracted by the Soviet Union without having normal and good relations between our two countries.

Moreover, the fantastic icons in the church's crypt, with their strangely austere yet intricate patterns and distorted mirror reflection of the world, provided a psychological clue, however opaque, to what was going on behind the white colonnades of the party headquarters in the 1970's and 1980's.

us,Just a Ragpicker of History,"As one of the intellectual demigods of the 20th century, Claude Levi-Strauss, the structural anthropologist who formulated intricate methods for analyzing myths and kinship systems, has had his share of believers and disbelievers. While his admirers have enthusiastically welded his theories onto their various fields -- literary criticism, philosophy, history -- his critics, many in anthropology, have claimed that his mathematical and linguistic-based models for cultural behavior are too rigorous to account for all the contingencies of social life. In CONVERSATIONS WITH CLAUDE LEVI-STRAUSS (University of Chicago, $19.95), the French anthropologist discusses his controversial career with the French journalist Didier Eribon and ruminates on other subjects ranging from Picasso to racism. He also reflects on his past, including his early years in New York when he became friends with Andre Breton and Max Ernst, and his election in 1959 to the chair of anthropology at the College de France. Mr. Levi-Strauss, 83 years old, is revealed as something of an iconoclast. Sartre's existentialism, he says, proves that ""a superior intellect may talk nonsense if it wishes to predict the course of history."" Anthropologists are ""the ragpickers of history,"" and Mr. Levi-Strauss himself has ""a neolithic mind. I'm not the kind of person who can . . . make what I've acquired bear fruit."" He adds later that he ""would have liked to be a playwright."" Yet the same idealism that perhaps inspired his attempts to organize the mysteries of the human mind systematically is evident: ""I am more and more penetrated by the feeling that the cosmos, and man's place in the universe, surpasses and always will surpass our understanding."" Even Mr. Levi-Strauss' disbelievers will find in this book, fluidly translated by Paula Wissing, a remarkable display of unfettered candor and insight.",1991-04-21T05:00:00+0000

The Met's trustees and its artistic director, James Levine, no doubt believe that history will prove that influence to have been benign. Perhaps so, financially. But the Met, which once could pride itself on being known internationally as a ""singer's house,"" is now at least equally renowned for the empty lavishness of its productions.

us,Aquarius Redux,"Described in retrospect by one of its originators, J. M. Jamil Brownson, as located ""somewhere between Marshall McLuhan and MTV,"" The San Francisco Oracle -- published 12 times between September 1966 and February 1968 -- was a spectacular emblem of the dream decade. But this wild tabloid of poetry, protest, mystical speculation and visionary tracts, decked out in psychedelic graphic art in neon colors, was printed on ordinary newsprint; the few copies of originals that survive are more fragile than butterfly wings and as costly as rubies. Now Allen Cohen, an editor of The Oracle, and a group of ingenious printers have brought out THE SAN FRANCISCO ORACLE FACSIMILE EDITION (Regent Press, 6020-A Adeline, Oakland, Calif. 94608, $175), a large-format reproduction of the entire run of the paper, bound in a sturdy volume. This is an admirable feat. The fantastic graphics of The Oracle, many wrapped around pages or double spreads of text, were mostly printed in black and white, but many glowed in deep reds, fuchsias, blues, oranges and yellows produced in a printing process now extinct. Regent Press has brought them back to life through what must have been maddeningly laborious handwork on the press; here indeed is the old Oracle in all its Oriental opulence. Open any page and you are back on the streets of Haight-Ashbury in a time when that tiny urban spot was the Olympus of the newborn world. The prophets were young then: Gary Snyder, Alan Watts, Timothy Leary, Allen Ginsberg, Lew Welch -- whole ranks of them are here proclaiming their new testaments under hypnotic graphic banners created by Hetti McGee, Rick and Ida Griffin, Bob Branaman and many more, some nameless but still unforgettable. In the politically treacherous and drugged chaos that was Haight-Ashbury, it is no wonder The Oracle dropped dead young; it seems a miracle that it lived even a short time. It's good to have it back.",1991-04-28T05:00:00+0000
