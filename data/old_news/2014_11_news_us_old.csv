It was a throng typically Parisian, typically proletariat, which filed through the massive stone gates of the cemetery at Bagneux to the section where most of the soldiers who have died in the great military hospital of Val-de-Grce lie buried. Perhaps half of the women were hatless. Many carried children in their arms. By half-past two oclock in the afternoon the street in front of the cemetery was an unbroken phalanx moving toward the gates. At half-past four, when the autumn sun was disappearing behind the trees, the stream was still coming from Paris.  The New York Herald, European Edition, Nov. 3, 1914",2014-11-02T13:43:22+0000

John Spinello, above, inventor of what became Operation in 1965, is able to afford a $25,000 dental procedure because of a crowdfunding campaign begun by his fellow game inventors Tim Walsh and Peggy Brown. The campaign, which began Oct. 22 at crowdrise.com, raised over $31,000 by early Sunday. The experience, Mr. Spinello said by phone from Bloomington, Ill., has been mind boggling. Its really rewarding to have people calling me right now from all over the world, he said. You cant put a price tag on it. Mr. Spinello, 77, invented the buzzer game while studying industrial design at the University of Illinois. He sold his idea to a toy invention firm for $500, and it was then licensed to Milton Bradley. Through the years there have been various riffs on the character, including Homer Simpson, SpongeBob SquarePants and a version with 21st-century ailments like headphone headache and gamers thumb. Though Mr. Spinello still owns the patent for the game, he said he receives no royalties. In recent years, the recession hurt his trucking warehouse company, and he and his wife have filed for bankruptcy. In addition to the donations at Crowdrise, money has also been raised through the sale of signed copies of the game and $3 Dear John thank-you letters at iloveoperation.com. Hasbro, which owns Milton Bradley, has pitched in by agreeing to buy the original prototype from Mr. Spinello. Calls requesting comment from Hasbro were not returned. Mr. Spinello said he hoped any leftover money would go to saving his home. But, he added, he would be grateful for a decent smile and the ability to chew.",2014-11-02T22:35:45+0000

The Montpelier Foundation announced on Saturday that the money would be used to further restore the mansion to its original 1817 appearance and provide more context about the lives of Madisons slaves. Part of the gift, $3.5 million, will support reconstruction of the mansions south yard, where the familys domestic servants lived and worked. The plans include three slave quarters, two smokehouses and a detached kitchen. The rest of the money will go toward restoring, researching and refurnishing the home, including purchasing items authentic to the time period or the home; much of what was there has been dispersed over the years through family members or sales. Dolley Madison sold the property in 1844 after her husbands death, and Montpelier had various owners until it was purchased in 1901 by William duPont. In 1984, it was bestowed to the National Trust for Historic Preservation by Marion duPont Scott, following her death in 1983.

Lately several cases of severe and stubborn sickness have been attributed to some unknown witch, and for that reason pillows and feather beds were opened and carefully examined. The bunches formed inside are called crowns, wreaths, chickens or any imaginable thing. A case a few days ago of this description happened. A hot fire was made, and the crowns and such put in the fire, but would not burn; even the feathers would not be scorched; but while wondering about it, they had suddenly disappeared.

Over the weekend, as the Republican advantage seemed to solidify, a number of writers made the point that the G.O.P.could probably win the Senate without making the kind of inroads that would bode well for their chances of winning the White House (or even keeping the Senate) two years hence. This years midterm map is unusually unrepresentative of the country as a whole, the Washington Posts Patrick Egan noted, and so tonights outcomes dont tell us that much about the future; the G.O.P. is winning more on second-term disillusionment than on any positive vision or agenda, two the partys pollsters argued in the same newspaper, and isnt showing any signs of expanding the electoral map into blue territory.The upshot (if you will) of these patterns, my colleague Nate Cohn suggested, is that Republicans are poised to retake the Senate without winning over many voters who supported President Obama in 2012  an outcome that would indicate theyve made little progress in attracting voters they would need to take back the White House.",2014-11-04T17:59:07+0000

Kaspersky, who was born in Novorossiysk, Russia, graduated in 1987 from the Russian Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science with a degree in computer technology and mathematical engineering. In 1989, while working for the Soviet military as a cryptographer, he discovered a virus in his computer and began to study and treat it. He did the same for another colleague who had found a virus in his computer. By 1991, Kaspersky had moved to a private company, where he and his colleagues developed a program called AntiViral Toolkit Pro. That was the prototype for what became the Kaspersky Anti-Virus, now sold by Kaspersky Lab, the company that he founded in 1997. Based in Moscow, the company now has 30 regional offices and works in nearly 200 countries. The company became a sponsor in Formula One with the Ferrari team in 2010 and has expanded into one of the teams major sponsors and technical partners. Kasperskys software is used in the Ferrari computer system and he plans additional projects within the series. Kaspersky is a racing fan and he occasionally drives sports cars on racetracks for fun. As part of an occasional series focusing on famous and unusual Formula One fans, Kaspersky spoke recently with Brad Spurgeon of the International New York Times. ",2014-11-06T09:44:04+0000

Their work is rarely glamorous, and especially for those just starting out in the profession, it can be grinding and repetitive. Jason Luckasevic, hired out of law school in 2000 by a firm in Pittsburgh, passed the bar exam on his first try and was quickly sworn in to practice. The ceremony, such as it was, took place on a Thursday in a clerks office, rather than in a courtroom in front of family and friends, because his bosses needed him to get started. The following Monday morning, he drove to Johnstown, about 90 minutes away, where he spent the day taking depositions from former employees of an enormous steel plant that had exposed them to asbestos. Late that afternoon, he climbed back into his Honda Civic and headed home. He repeated this routine for the next six months, five days a week, racking up some 400 depositions and about 20,000 miles on the road.",2014-11-06T09:58:05+0000

us,B. J. Novaks Book With No Pictures and More,"Have your kids gone meta? Do they call their neighborhood jungle gym a play structure? Do they mix and match their dress-up garb  a tiara here, firefighters boots there  with a sense of mischief that might, unnervingly, be termed ironic? Have they spotted the clown at the neighbors birthday party removing his wig and slinking out the side door? Theyre probably not ready for the labyrinthine tricksterism of David Foster Wallace or Spike Jonze. But on the evidence of a recent spate of highly self-conscious picture books, it would seem that the suspended-disbelief state of early childhood is adapting to the wink-wink, nudge-nudge sensibility of our moment. Its not surprising. There has long been a strain of subversion in picture books  think of Maurice Sendak and Tomi Ungerer, among others  alongside the dominant anodyne snuggliness of the form. Now, sophisticated cheekiness appears to have gone mainstream. These five specimens of reinvention deftly pop the bubbles of their own illusory worlds, drawing attention to the artifices of their norms and aiming to teach children to become not just book lovers but pint-size consumers of text. The best of these books, luckily, manage to find fresh magic in demystification, and to delight kids while spinning the heads of their grown-up companions.",2014-11-06T17:59:17+0000

On one level, the book is about duality: As Jude and Noah wrangle over who will go to a prestigious art school and vie for attention and approbation and even, for a short time, the affections of the same boy, each narrator struggles to become whole, to become something other than merely half of one. Although Nelson portrays the relationship between the twins, their oneness, as comforting, more often it is claustrophobic  perhaps contributing to the books tense, almost breathless feel. One of their favorite games is to divide up the world between them, choosing and bartering the sun or the trees or the oceans.

Some of these children emerged without any sign of the infection; others, like Adelina, were marked and strangely scarred, their hair changing in color. These children, known as malfettos, are considered to have no social value and are persecuted by the government. Adelinas own father, who regarded her as worthless, was preparing to sell her off to a business associate as a mistress to complete a deal. She decided to escape rather than accept this fate, and in the process accidentally killed her father.

us,Russia: Putin Defends Soviet-Nazi Pact," President Vladimir V. Putin has revised his opinion of an important piece of Soviet history, calling the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that Moscow signed with Nazi Germany to divide up Eastern Europe not so bad. The Soviet Union signed a nonaggression treaty with Germany, Mr. Putin said during a meeting with historians on Wednesday, according to a Russian transcript of the meeting that the Kremlin released Thursday. People say: Ach, thats bad. But whats bad about that if the Soviet Union didnt want to fight? Whats bad about it? While the Soviet Union is accused of dividing Poland, he said, Poland actually seized part of Czechoslovakia when Germany attacked that country. Serious research should show that those were the methods of foreign policy then, Mr. Putin said. Five years ago he had called the very same pact immoral. The statement is likely to increase security concerns in Eastern European states, which have been jittery about Russias intentions ever since it seized Crimea in March. Mr. Putin signed a law in May mandating five years imprisonment for anyone convicted of trying to rehabilitate Nazism. ",2014-11-07T00:47:54+0000

The company did not acknowledge wrongdoing. In 2011, The New York Times published an article documenting an unusual pattern in the growth of Biotronik devices in some Western states.

They simply heard the terrific crash of the heavy guns, and within a few seconds they and their guns ceased to exist. The enemy had been surprised by an armored train  the first which the British had sent to the firing line. The armored train has now supported our artillery for several days.

But it may have reached its happy apotheosis with The Secret History of Wonder Woman, new at No. 12 on the hardcover nonfiction list, by the Harvard historian and New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore. It struck me that Wonder Womans origin story borrows from all the conventions of feminist utopian fiction, Lepore said in a recent interview with Comic Book Resource (the premier online comics magazine). I had never noticed that tie before, and I dont think comics fans or comics historians necessarily noticed it, either  mainly because theres not a great deal of overlap between comics historians and readers of feminist utopian fiction. Among other things, Lepores book traces the pervasive bondage scenes in Wonder Woman to suffragist politics, and locates the comic at an important point on the timeline of feminism. People often think of the womens rights movement as having taken place in waves, she told Comic Book Resource. Theres a first wave that ends with the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, and a second wave that begins in the 60s, and in between those two waves, its as if theres nothing going on. But once you lift the veil on the secret history of Wonder Woman, right there in the middle in the 1940s, theres Wonder Woman, inspired by the feminism of the first half of the century, and an inspiration for the feminism in the second half.",2014-11-07T16:51:56+0000

Parson Mason Weemss Life of Washington rolled off the presses in Philadelphia in 1800, mere months after the death of the father of our country, with Weemss stated goal to inspire young Americans to emulate the great mans shining example. We have that book to thank for the compelling image of the rambunctious 6-year-old George chopping down his fathers best cherry tree, then fessing up to his misdeed with the immortal words: I cannot tell a lie. The irrepressible parson, we now know, invented the scene out of whole cloth, which is certainly a tad ironic. Yet less cavalier authors than Weems have wrestled with the question of whether, or to what extent in the seemingly special case of a biography for young readers, a touch-up job might be in order.

Plato, not the most liberal of men, suggested that the work of storytellers should be carefully examined and what they do well we must pass and what not, reject. His purpose was to moralize literature; others, over the centuries, have offered equally noble motives. Ibn Khaldun, the great Arab historian, reported that in the seventh century, when Muslim soldiers invaded Persia, they discovered an extraordinary number of books; wishing to carry them off as loot, they asked Omar bin al-Khattab, second caliph of the Muslims, for permission. Omars answer became legendary and was applied to other book destructions: Throw them in the river! If they hold a guide to the Truth, God has given us a better guide in the Holy Quran. And if they hold nothing but lies, may God rid us of them. In our own time, the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, forced Google and Twitter to remove content objected to by his government or risk blackouts, arguing that these regulations do not impose any censorship at all on the Internet. . . . On the contrary, they make it safer and freer.

While Robinson was writing Gilead, her own Pulitzer winner, and two subsequent novels about Iowa church people and their descendants, Smiley was shaking off the Heartland-Author tag with novels about real estate and tax evasion (Good Faith), Hollywood (Ten Days in the Hills) and a military wife transplanted from Missouri to San Francisco (Private Life). With a short biography of Dickens, she invited us to see her, like him, as a writer whose work is defined by its energy and range rather than its settings and subject matter. With a whistle-stop tour of 100 novels (Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel), she lined up with Henry James and John Updike as a writer who offsets her own fiction with spot-on commentary about other peoples work.

It was first performed in January 1941 before a freezing audience of prisoners and German guards. The reception was said to have been respectful if bemused. As the critic Alex Ross later explained: By 1941, this composer no longer wanted to hear time being beaten out by a drum  one, two, three, four; he had had enough of that in the war.

Since July, Mr. Childs, the director Sally Plass and a team of interns have recorded about 50 hours of interviews with 20 Off Broadway leaders, including the actors Fyvush Finkel and Arthur French, the Chelsea Theater Center founder Robert Kalfin, the Playwrights Horizons founder Robert Moss and the Pan Asian Repertory Theater founder Tisa Chang.

Thats the low estimate for an original illustration from A. A. Milnes 1928 book The House at Pooh Corner to be sold at Sothebys London next month. The drawing, signed by the artist E. H. Shepard, depicts Winnie-the-Pooh playing a game of Poohsticks on a bridge with Christopher Robin and Piglet. It has been part of a private collection since 1975, according to the Sothebys London sale catalog. The illustration is expected to fetch 100,000 to 150,000, or about $159,000 to $238,000, and is one of several drawings by Shepard that the auction house will feature at its English Literature, History, Childrens Books and Illustration sale on Dec. 9. Other items include drawings by Beatrix Potter and Edmund Dulac, a copy of Peter Pan signed by J. M. Barrie, and presentation copies of uncorrected Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets proofs signed by J. K. Rowling. Pooh has proved to be a lucrative draw at previous auctions. In November 2008, an original Shepard sketch of Pooh and friends sold for about $50,100 at a Bonhams auction. A month later, the Stanley J.

While looking for a subject to research, Zion noticed a grant proposal, never funded, that another graduate student had written on the subject of drug delivery. One possibility mentioned in the proposal was the development of a kind of insulin that would automatically respond to changes in blood-sugar levels, becoming active only when needed to maintain healthy levels around the clock. If it worked, the sugar-sensitive version could transform the lives of the six million people with diabetes in the United States who use insulin. No longer would they have to test their blood-sugar levels multiple times per day and try to calculate how much insulin to take. The self-regulating insulin would curtail high sugar levels, which raise the risk of long-term complications, and eradicate, or at least reduce, the most dangerous short-term complication: hypoglycemia, when sugar levels fall so low that they can cause confusion, unconsciousness, seizures and even death.",2014-11-13T09:58:04+0000

McCone said last night [Nov. 14] that the depth of the schism between the Soviet Union and Communist China is greater than generally believed and that the problems of repairing it appear insurmountable. In his first public address since taking office more than three years ago, Mr. McCone admitted that the fall of Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev was a distinct surprise to us. But he also said the ouster was an equal surprise to the Soviet party Presidium. They didnt know they had the strength to remove him until they sat down to their final meeting on Oct. 14, Mr. McCone said. The C.I.A. director gave his agency credit for predicting Communist Chinas first nuclear explosion almost to the day. To defeat the ultrasophisticated security apparatus in every Communist country, he said, required the use of highly refined technical devices. In analyzing recent events in the Soviet Union, Mr. McCone said the Russian people resented their governments tremendous expenditure on military hardware while they were forced to go without. He said this internal problem was created by the Soviets spending beyond their resources.  New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Nov. 16, 1964",2014-11-14T15:07:37+0000

He fitted me with headphones and the Oculus Rift, as the companys flagship product is called, a blocky set of black maxigoggles with an internal screen positioned inches from the eyes.

Cleese also appeared in a couple of non-Python movies on the list: Clockwise at No. 80 and, with his Python sidekick Michael Palin, A Fish Called Wanda at No. 87.

The man in charge of the Igorrote village, Truman Hunt, had served as a medical doctor during the war and stayed on, eventually rising to become the lieutenant governor of Bontoc Province.

Back then he was to be found in only one full-length biography, William Edward Farrisons William Wells Brown: Author and Reformer (1969). Published by the University of Chicago Press in the twilight of the second Reconstruction and at the dawning of African-American studies, it depicted Brown as a representative black American. In the absence of the biographical scholarship coming after 1969, Browns colleagues remained ill defined.

If ever the professional debut of a major playwright was a greater fiasco, John Lahr writes in his new biography of Williams, piquantly subtitled Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh, history does not record it. Five years and a lot of crummy jobs later, Williams clawed his way back with a play that would make him famous, The Glass Menagerie, whose premiere almost proved an even bigger disaster. Laurette Taylor, plucked from a long alcoholic oblivion to play Amanda Wingfield, was found an hour and a half before opening curtain in an alley outside the stage door, soaking wet in the rain and all but dead drunk.

Christopher Hickey, director of the F.D.A.s China operation, said that it had filled the gaps by bringing in experts temporarily, but that short-term workers often lack deep knowledge of trends that years in the country provide. About 15 percent of Americans food is imported, including 80 percent of seafood and 50 percent of fresh fruit, and an increasing share of it is coming from China.

New rounds of vaccination will be conducted in December in both areas. The two paralysis cases in South Sudan were in a displaced-persons camp where revaccination is relatively easy, the W.H.O. said, while testing suggests that the one case in Madagascar did not spread far. Vaccine-derived polio paralysis is a rare but small risk inherent in oral vaccine, so the polio eradication campaign is trying to introduce injectable vaccine wherever it is safe and practical. The injectable vaccine contains a killed virus that cannot mutate. But it provides less protection than the live, weakened virus in oral vaccine, is more expensive and is much harder to give. Only 279 cases of polio have been detected in the world this year, almost all of them in Pakistan or in Pakistani families in Afghanistan. ",2014-11-15T01:32:02+0000

Second came his wife, Marie-Hortense Fiquet (1850-1922). The exhibition Madame Czanne, opening Wednesday and running through March 15 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, will present 23 of the 29 images of her that Czanne is known to have made. They dont give much away. Far from idealized as a woman or a beloved mate, she usually appears stiffly reserved, a dignified enigma. In fact, not a lot is known about her. She was 19 and working as a part-time artists model when he, 11 years older, met her and started an affair that produced a child, Paul (1872-1947). Czanne kept the relationship and the child a secret from his wealthy parents for fear of their disapproval but eventually married Hortense, in 1886. His letters to friends suggest that he regarded her as a shallow and irritating person. He excluded her from his will, leaving everything to their son. Yet he painted her repeatedly over more than 20 years. Go figure. (212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.) ",2014-11-15T21:28:10+0000

Fans rushed to catch fleeting glimpses of stenciled graffiti, sculptures, videos and performance art touching on subjects like fast-food wages, animal cruelty in the meat industry, civilian casualties in Iraq and hypocrisy in the art world  and perhaps the anonymous artist. Eventually Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg condemned Banksy for defacing public and private property; some members of the press claimed that the New York Police Department was hunting him.

Its real value is as an educational tool, or an exercise in empathy. Aside from occasional fuzzy Polaroid pictures that appear at the top of the screen, Depression Quest is a purely text-based game that proceeds from screen to screen through simple hyperlinks, inviting players to step into the shoes of a person suffering from clinical depression. After reading brief vignettes about what the main character is struggling with  at home, at work, in relationships  you try to make choices that steer your character out of this downward spiral. The most important choices are those the game prevents you from making, unclickable choices with red lines through them, saying things like Shake off your funk. As your character falls deeper into depression, more options are crossed out. You cant sleep; you cant call a therapist; you cant explain how you feel to the people you love. In the depths of depression, it all feels impossible.",2014-11-19T18:15:00+0000

Marilyn B. Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in September that 7.3 million people were enrolled. ButBloomberg News reported Thursday that the figure included nearly 400,000 people with stand-alone dental plans, prompting the administration to revise the enrollment figure to 6.7 million as of Oct. 15. The discrepancy was discovered by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which had asked for the enrollment records. About eight million people had signed up for health plans by May, according to the administration, but many are no longer enrolled. At the time, the Health and Human Services Department broke out the number who had signed up for dental but not medical plans, saying that 1.1 million people had done so. In a statement, the Department of Health and Human Services said it still estimated that a total of 9.1 million people would have medical coverage through the exchanges by the end of next year. The mistake we made is unacceptable, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the departments secretary, wrote on Twitter. ",2014-11-21T02:11:46+0000

By now, in other words, Bascombe is as familiar as your next-door neighbor, having staked his place not just in suburban New Jersey but in contemporary literature. So I was startled to learn, while talking to Ford at an event last spring, that the character was originally named not Bascombe but Slocum. I had a working notion, Ford explained in a follow-up email, that Frank was figuratively a man sailing alone around the world  like Joshua Slocum, who wrote Sailing Alone Around the World, a book I loved. But when Ford sent his manuscript for The Sportswriter to the poet Donald Hall, a longtime friend and mentor, Hall reminded him that Joseph Hellers novel Something Happened also had a protagonist named Slocum. So I was stuck, Ford said, with a finished novel narrated by a character I didnt have a name for. This was very vexing, I hardly need say. Id always felt a characters name was totemic. Ford set out to rechristen his protagonist, deconstructing Slocum and deciding he required a two-syllable, trochaic name that emphasized its vowels rather than its consonants. I had a friend who had a middle name that was like Bascombe, he said, but I didnt want to steal my friends name. So I rejiggered it into Bascombe  a name Id never heard before but that sounded persuasive. I was actually surprised at how easily I made the transition from one loyalty to another. It was instructive.",2014-11-21T15:52:34+0000

But Genoways argues that the industrial system behind those little cans is inextricably linked to a variety of social problems: animal cruelty, water pollution, food-borne illness, worker exploitation, a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment, government corruption and largely unchecked corporate power. Once celebrated with some irony by Monty Python, lovely Spam, wonderful Spam looms as a sinister force in The Chain, a hidden source of misery in the nations heartland.",2014-11-21T18:09:54+0000

He turns out to do it in a slow and deep-voiced manner, beneath whose calm avuncularity you can detect anxiety, even mania, bubbling but never quite erupting  although I could have sworn I heard him, in the silence at the end of CD 30, racing out the door to buy a years supply of those Thayers Slippery Elm Throat Lozenges the hero Slothrop sucks, or perhaps to check himself into the books White Visitation mental hospital.",2014-11-21T18:09:54+0000

Goes Gender-Neutral, Recognizing Female Veterans "," When the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States secured its congressional charter in 1936, veterans were usually men and the spouses of those who fell in battle were widows. That, of course, is now very different. (Indeed, even during World War II several hundred thousand women served in the United States military, including nurses and members of the Womens Army Corps.) Now, more than 15 percent of active-duty United States service members are female. So the V.F.W. is changing, too, winning congressional approval to alter the wording of its charter. No longer is it a national association of men who served in wartime; it is one of veterans. And it is no longer to assist widows  rather, surviving spouses. The changes, approved at the national convention, were made in bills just passed by the House and Senate. We didnt change our congressional charter to be politically correct, the V.F.W. National Commander, John W. Stroud, said in a statement. We changed it because being an eligible service member or veteran is whats important to our great organization, not ones gender.

Its discovery within such a short time in three European countries, the warning said, suggests that wild birds may have spread the virus. The warning said the virus posed a significant threat to poultry farmers in countries along the Black Sea and East Atlantic migratory routes of wild birds. While H5N8 has not affected humans, the warning said it was related to H5N1, the bird flu that caused an epidemic in 2005-6, causing the deaths of nearly 400 people and the culling of hundreds of millions of birds.

us,The Militarys Rough Justice on Sexual Assault,"Col. Don Christensen, the chief prosecutor of the United States Air Force, sat in economy class on a flight to Venice and studied the folder of the sexual-assault case that would ultimately end his career. It was August 2012, and he was en route to Aviano Air Base to try a court-martial. Looking over the case, he could see why the judge advocate general, or JAG, at the base had requested him. Christensen had prosecuted more sexual-assault courts-martial than any other lawyer in the Air Force, and this case called for someone with experience. There would most likely be generals testifying. The accused himself was a senior officer. Even Christensen had seldom handled cases involving men of high rank. There was a simple reason for this: Victims were reluctant to report such officers, who enjoyed their own set of rules in the military justice system.",2014-11-26T15:21:59+0000

He tells someone hes writing a book about a dead army commanded by a living general  an allusion to Kadares 1963 novel, The General of the Dead Army, in which an Italian officer returns to Albania after the Second World War to disinter the bones of his soldiers. Hes also obsessed with the Albanian legend of Konstandin and Doruntine, which goes like this: When his sister Doruntine marries and moves far away, Konstandin promises his mother he will ride to fetch her for weddings and funerals; when he and all his brothers are killed, his ghost does the job, delivers his sister to the church and leaves her at the gate, saying, You go on, I have something to do here. This story would be the basis for Kadares novel The Ghost Rider, and by the end of Twilight of the Eastern Gods the narrator has become a sort of Konstandin figure himself. The Albanian dictator Enver Hoxhas schism from the U.S.S.R. is occurring, and the narrator knows his days in Moscow are numbered. Hes become a ghost in the city, and its become ghostly to him.

When he wasnt behind the mixing board at SST Records, the label founded by Black Flags Greg Ginn, he was likely to be roller-skating the boardwalks  or behind the lens of his Nikon, photographing the skate ramps, the beaches, the house parties. Bruised and bloodied and tanned from the days skating, everyone would head to see whichever band was playing that night, and then Spot would stay up late in the darkroom afterwards.

Its a sweet and wholesome image, and a far cry from a photo that ran around the same time on the cover of New York magazine, depicting Brooke in full makeup with a haughty stare while her mother grasped her shoulders. Meet Teri and Brooke Shields, the cover read. Brooke is 12. She poses nude. Teri is her mother. She thinks its swell. Shields doesnt mention that article in her book, which is subtitled The Real Story of My Mother and Me, but she does talk about the media uproar surrounding Louis Malles 1978 film Pretty Baby, in which she played an underage prostitute, and all of the racy jobs that followed. There was a sense of fury and a need to assume that I was a victim, she writes. There was a firestorm, and Mom took most of the heat. Although Shields writes frankly and painfully about her mothers chronic drinking and poor career decisions, the book  which was prompted, she says, by her reaction to The New York Timess obituary after Teri Shields died in 2012  is mostly tender. It is not a Mommie Dearest tale. But Im not holding her up on a pedestal, either, she writes. It is simply my turn to tell the story as I saw and felt it.",2014-11-28T19:19:56+0000

It marked the beginning of the sixth season of opera in German. The house had a brilliant appearance when the curtain rose on the first act of Wagners Flying Dutchman. Although it rained in torrents all the evening, the ladies appeared in their rarest toilettes, and the boxes literally blazed with diamonds. Mrs. Astor was in white pink brocade, and occupied a box with Miss Marion Longdon and Mr. Ward McAlister. Miss Longdon wore pale yellow with a long boa of ostrich feathers. In an adjoining box sat Mrs. William C. Whitney in a dcollet dress of pale green and silver, with diamonds in her hair. Mrs. Paran Stevens wore a brocade toilette, and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt wore white brocade and pearls. On the stage interest centred chiefly in Theodore Reichmann, the popular Viennese barytone, and in Fraulein Sophie Weisner, the soprano, who made their debut in this country as Senta and Vanderdecken. Reichmann scored a great and instant success, thanks as much to his admirable and artistic acting as to his rich and sympathetic voice. Fraulein Weisners success was less emphatic, although, like Reichmann, she was warmly applauded. The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 1, 1889",2014-11-30T14:44:57+0000

Geoffrey Rush is Lionel Logue, the speech therapist who helps Bertie conquer a debilitating stutter. And Ms. Carter is Elizabeth, his wife and staunch support system, who cant quite stomach Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), the divorced American who leads Berties older brother, David (Guy Pearce), to abdicate as Edward VIII. It isnt exactly Pygmalion, not least because Mr. Hooper has no intention of satirizing the caste system that is one of this movies biggest draws, Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, said of the film, which received 12 Oscar nominations and won four.

During the recent fighting in this region, and more particularly on Thursday, the Germans have sustained enormous loss. After a multitude of charges by the Russian cavalry, the state of the fields and roads rendered the use of automobiles absolutely impossible. The Russians have consequently garaged a large number of their machines at Lodz, whither they are also sending hundreds of transport and ammunition wagons captured from the enemy. The prolongation of the struggle in the neighborhood of Lodz is probably due to the feverish activity on the German strategic railways on the Silesian frontier. The enemy is bringing up troops with all possible speed, and it is estimated that 50,000 men, or nearly half the garrison of Breslau, were despatched north-west to Czenstochowa to join the newly-formed army in that region. Another great battle is to be expected somewhere between Lodz and Kalisz. The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 1, 1914",2014-11-30T18:48:40+0000
