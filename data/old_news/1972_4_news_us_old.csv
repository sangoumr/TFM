us,Little-Known Canadian Films Screened,"Any film series devoted to scheduling new and relatively unknown work is likely to have both its peaks and its valleys. In this connection, the Independent Cinema of Canada program that opened yesterday at the Film Forum may perhaps represent the bottomless abyss.Not that all 10 of the films are bad; 3 are even modestly good. But those that are bad are very very bad, and in ways that I had thought to have seen the last of more than a decade ago.The films run from 2 to 35 minutes, and, selected by the Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Center, they come from Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver. They are not all very recent and at least one, Martin Lavut's ""At Home"" (1968), has been seen here before.""At Home,"" a study in domestic clutter, succeeds, through a succession of gently mounting absurdities, in becoming a fairly funny movie. Humor is an aim shared by none of the other Canadian films, though both John Straiton's pleasant montage of old Edward Muybridge photographs, ""Animals in Motion,"" and Bob Conway's satiric ""Skin Deep"" display civilized virtues.But everything else on the program is either a lifecycle myth and/or a moral meditation about war and industrialization and similar forms of depravity.

For, to transpose Russian skazki into a nonSlavic tongue is no less difficult than translating Russian narrative poetry, since the language of these talesthe fairy tales, ciallyis so rich in spontaneous prose rhyming, narrative cadence, striking turns of phrase, as well as in extensive and effective, as well as affective, use of dialogue.

The earliest organisms obtained the nitrogen they needed from ammonia, a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen. Then organisms evolved that took in nitrogen in excess of their needs and released molecules of nitrogen gas into the atmosphere as a waste. Today this ability to release unused nitrogen is mostly confined to certain bacteria and some very primitive algae, but they do the job on such huge scale that nitrogen, which is essential for all life, including our own, is constantly recycled into and out of the atmosphere and with oxygen now accounts for 99 per cent of the bulk.",1972-04-02T05:00:00+0000

For example, of every $6 paid in for bodily injury coverage only $1 goes out for net economic loss suffered by accident victims. Furthermore, the higher the claimthat is, the more serious the injury  the smaller the percentage of the claim paid out. In other words, if you're going to have an accident have a minor one. This is a thorough look at the current auto insurance crisis which has companies canceling policies right and left, leaving people to pay wildly high rates to get reinsured. Mr. Sullivan discusses various proposals for reform, such as nofault.

(Ages 12 to 15)","What happens when the passions of friendship synthesize into a sexual experience is the nub of Isabelle Holland's new novel. The Man Without a Face is about need: the need of a 14yearold adolescent whose mother Is on her fifth marriage, whose older sister is a case study in viciousness, whose father is an enigma and whose own driving ambition during the summer in which the story takes place is to escape the female clutches of his family and enter a middlebrow prep school once the summer ends. As he must first pass the school's entrance exam, the young man hires an older man with a scarred face, dogmatic manner and a history of mystery to cram some knowledge into his head. The studentteacher relationship, at first, is strained. Neither one is able to accept the other as a wounded soul with an ego that needs replenishing. Eventually, they open to each other; the teacher becomes a surrogatefather figure to the young man, and the young man becomes a hopeofthefuture and memoryofthepast figure to the teacher. Their sublimated love leads to the expected  a sort of homosexual Summer of '42 sexual experience (carefully not described in the book). This all sounds as though it might be accompanied by rain on the roof and a Wurlitzer organ, but the story is told with understanding and freshness by Miss Holland and consequently seldom sags into soap opera. It does, however, sink toward the end, when some hardtobelieve justification is thrown in, alas, and the organ music pipes full blast.",1972-04-09T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Tomorrow':Adapted Faulkner Tale Directed by Anthony,"Jackson Fentry (Robert Duvall) is a young Mississippi cotton farmer who is so taciturn that he almost seems to be catatonic. He's the kind whose daddy, and his daddy before him, for generations, have worked the same soil. His life is a self-contained, unending series of sunups to sundowns, working, eating, sleeping, making do with an existence that promises nothing except the minimal satisfaction of surviving it, day by day.One morning, a sickly, pregnant woman named Sarah Eubanks (Olga Bellin), once pretty but now worn out, wanders by, abandoned by her husband, headed no-where. Jackson nurses her in her pregnancy, marries her on her deathbed and begins to raise her son, who, like his mother, brings out a capacity for love in Jackson that he never suspected to exist.This, briefly, is what Joseph Anthony's new film, ""Tomorrow,"" is all aboutthe survival and endurance of love under circumstances that authors, Easterners, Northerners and the well-meaning, socially conscious bourgeoisie everywhere find intolerably poetic. It is also pretty much what the original William Faulkner short story (from the collection called ""Knight's Gambit"") is all about, although the Horton Foote screenplay is less an adaptation than an enlargement, in the playwright's dumbest, television-fake literary style of the 1950's.""Tomorrow"" is not one of Faulkner's most interesting works but at least he had the good sense to keep Jackson, Sarah and the boy always two steps removed from the readeras bareboned but mysterious figures recollected only in the reminiscences of the various narrators. Because there is no such cinematic equivalent, Mr. Anthony and Mr. Foote are forced to deal with the characters directly, in close-up, providing them with manners, attitudes and, worst of all, with the kind of mopey, under-the-chinaberry tree dialogue that only Tennessee Williams, and occasionally William Inge, ever wrote well.Mr. Foote's attempts at pretty po' fo'k dialogue come very close to the ludicrous, as when a wistful Sarah, about eight months pregnant and failing fast, smiles bravely and says: ""There's nothing wrong with me that a little sunshine won't cure."" My favorite speech, however, is one she's forced to deliver during a heavy rain. ""It's a good thing we don't live on the delta,"" she says, being an incurable Miss Bright Eyes. ""We'd have to get on top of the house, and float away . . . but I don't think I'd like to travel by water.""Miss Bellin has to talk too much, and Mr. Duvall, who is such a good actor that he seems entirely different from one film (""The Godfather"") to the next (this one), has to talk too little. When he does talk, however, something very peculiar happens, but I'm not sure whether it's because of the dialogue given him, the cracker accent he affects or perhaps the bad balance of a post-synchronized soundtrack. Whatever the reason, the voice sounds as if it had been supplied by a ventriloquist.Even if the movie's intentions are decent, as reflected in the accurate look of the production, filmed in Mississippi, the effect is mostly patronizing.""Tomorrow"" opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse.",1972-04-10T05:00:00+0000

us,"A Funny Farce:' Loot,' Based on a Play, Opens at Baronet","The plot of ""Loot,"" the film version of the late Joe Orton's second play, a very bitter, very funny farce, should be got out of the way as quickly and as sanely as possible:What the undertaker tactfully refers to as Mr. McLeavy's ""first bereavement"" is Mrs. McLeavy, whose newly embalmed body, dressed in her beloved Woman's Army Service uniform with sensible shoes to match, lies in a coffin in the parlor of Mr. McLeavy's seedy hotel, located in the suburbs of what seems to be an especially ghastly English provincial city.Upstairs Mrs. McLeavy's nurse, Fay, who looks like a marvelous, life-sized Kewpie doll and who walks like the sort of French maid you might describe as saucy, is trying to persuade Mr. McLeavy to become her eighth husband.Downstairs Mrs. McLeavy's son, Hal, who hasn't quite cleared the homosexual hurdle, and his best friend, Dennis, who has, are trying to hide the loot from their bank robbery in Mum's coffin, which means stuffing Mum into the dumbwaiter, upside down. Meanwhile, the premises are crawling with a crooked policeman, Mr. Truscott (""You surround the property,"" he says to his men. ""I'll surround the house""), disguised as a member of the Metropolitan Water Board.Everything goes so systematically wrong that there has to be a happy ending for just about everybody but Mr. McLeavy, the very dumb, Roman Catholic innocent who may, just possibly, be the only character in the script with whom Mr. Orton was unsympathetic. ""I've raised a ghoul at my own expense!"" he cries when he learns Hal has been tampering with Mum's corpse.At another point, the mourning husband demands to be able to open his wife's coffin. ""She's my wife. I can do what I like with her."" Says the shocked policeman, who is about to divide the bank loot with Hal, Dennis and Fay: ""Indeed not, sir. Conjugal rights should stop with the last heart beat!""I quote this dialogue at some length because there are still enough examples of Mr. Orton's displacements of conventional attitudes to make the movie ""Loot"" quite funny. However, Silvio Narizzano, the director, in making a movie out of the one-set play has not simply opened it up, he has also put it on the rack.He has stretched it out with no great imagination, not only by showing us all of the action that takes place outside the hotel, but by making a movie, that is, by cross-cutting between scenes of simultaneous action and by breaking up individual scenes into close-ups, medium shots and long shots. The effect, which is as deadening to Orton as to Feydeau, is one of constant, nearly fatal interruption.This sort of thing puts a very real strain on the performers, who are being rediscovered with each shot, even if they haven't actually been off-stage. In spite of these handicaps, I liked them all, including Lee Remick as the nurse whose Irish brogue tends to come and go according to the length of any speech; Richard Attenborough as the policeman who often sounds like Margaret Rutherford; Roy Holder as the androgynous son who looks like Rita Tushingham; Hywell Bennett as Dennis, and especially Milo O'Shea as poor old Mr. McLeavy.However, while watching ""Loot,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet, one is likely to mistake Mr. Orton's contempt for church, state, the judiciary, the police, and heaven knows what else for the second rate satirist's contempt for feeling. The good satirist wears his heart not on his sleeve, nor any other place else so obvious, but in his style.",1972-04-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Culpepper Cattle':Hero Quits Trail Drive to Help Pacifists,"Dick Richards's ""The Culpepper Cattle Co.,"" which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is an overly handsome Western that means to be considered realistic. Photographed in a style vaguely reminiscent of the finest record-album art a few years back, when American rock stars wanted to look like Wyatt Earp, it has the rich grainy surface of Mathew Brady, but underneath its soul is mostly Fred Zinnemann, brought up to date.Set in Texas sometime after the Civil War, it concerns the adventures of young Ben Mockridge (Gary Grimes) who has signed on as cook's helper in a cattle drive led by one Frank Culpepper (Billy ""Green"" Bush) to market in Colorado. Along the way, Ben learns many lessons, experiences much violence (almost everybody the Culpepper people meet, they killwith reason), shoots his first man, and finally takes a stand. He elects to leave the profit-hungry Culpepper and his cattle drive in order to defend a sect of religious pacifists from a cruel landowner who wants to destroy them for trespassing.He does his duty but the sect leader (Anthony James), by a script-written fiat of pure contrivance, also lets him down. Ben thus discovers that his own way is neither quite God's nor Mammon's, but something individualistic, in-between. To the sound of a massed choir singing ""Amazing Grace,"" he rides off alone, into the distance.The central quality of ""The Culpepper Cattle Co."" is a kind of arty, laconic simplicity. But all the really good Westerns of the recent past, from ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"" to ""Rio Lobo,"" have tended toward a high degree of complexitynot of surface texture, but of meaning  and their view of human relationships have suggested worlds within worlds of moral and passionate responsibility.In this respect, ""The Culpepper Cattle Co."" seems mostly vacant behind its facade of atmospheric realism. And its performances, though very competent (I especially liked Billy ""Green"" Bush and Raymond Guth, who plays the cook Ben is apprenticed to), have absolutely nowhere to goremaining no more than vignettes that one may value or not, like very minor art objects, for their authenticity.",1972-04-17T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Coming of Age in Quebec:Jutra's 'Uncle Antoine' Opens at the Paris Wide-Eyed Young Man Is Main Character,"""My Uncle Antoine,"" Claude Jutra's French-Canadian film set in Quebec's asbestos mining country in the 1940's, is about the coming of age of Benoit (Jacques Gagnon), a wide-eyed, comic-faced young man who lives and works in the general store of his uncle, boozy old Antoine (Jean Duceppe), who doubles as the community's undertaker.Like most 15-year-old boys in this kind of literature, Benoit is shocked by the awareness of marital infidelity (when he himself has yet to find someone to be faithful to) and disturbed by revelations of failed dreams (when his dreams haven't even been sorted out). He is also absolutely fascinated by female breasts, no matter what the age of the body to which they're attached.Whenever the opportunity arises, Benoit makes a grab for Carmen, the little girl who works for his uncle and lives in, or he peeks at Alexandrine, the notary's ancient (30-ish) wife who orders her black lace corsets from the general store's catalogue.The seasons pass, from summer to fall to winter, a young couple marries, a friend dies, and Benoit grows up to the point where he can finally be seen in one of those frozen frames that now say too little by assuming too much.When I first saw ""My Uncle Antoinc"" several weeks ago, I had the dim impression that I'd seen it all before, even though I hadn't. When I actually did see it for the second time, at its Paris Theater opening yesterday, I understood why.It's not only because ""My Uncle Antoine"" explores familiar emotional landscapes, but because it explores them as if by guided tour. Shot by picturesque shot, narrative detail by narrative detail, the film is so calculated to evoke humor, nostalgia, sadness and regret that it leaves very little room for self-discovery.As the zoom lens (which Jutra never tires of using) bosses the eye and tells it where to look, the film keeps bossing the emotions in such ways (close-ups of the pensive Benoit are a favorite Jutra device) that even the quite charming performances, by professional actors and amateurs, finally seem as studied and mechanical as the film itself.Occasionally individual scenes come spontaneously alive. There is a lovely, very tentative seqeunce in which Benoit's aging aunt, beautifully played by Olivette Thibault, and her husband's young assistant, played by Jutra (who gives probably the film's best performance) begin a love affair while sitting at a dining room table doing the store's accounts. At such moments, we share with the characters the sense of surprise so often missing from the movie.The film's most moving sequence occurs when a father, returning to his home from the logging country, discovers on a snowy country road the abandoned coffin containing the body of his son, of whose death he was ignorant. It is, I think, a measure of what's wrong with the film that this scene involves a subsidiary character and takes place off-screen.",1972-04-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: On Middle East:' A Wall in Jerusalem' Traces Jewish Role,"Frederic Rossif's ""A Wall in Jerusalem,"" which opened yesterday at the Mayfair Theater, attempts recounting the Jewish involvement in the Middle East from sometime before Theodor Herzl's Zionist proposal of 1896 until just after the June war of 1967. A documentary composed almost wholly of newsreel footage, it is clearly and deeply sympathetic to a pro-Israeli position. But it is at pains to avoid partisan simplifications and it is by no means a propaganda film.It is, of course, patently impossible to push 70 years of tremendously eventful history into 90 minutes of newsreel clips. And the effect is not helped by the sometimes maddening factual omissions in the narrated texttranslated from the French, and quite beautifully read by Richard Burton. But what doesn't get shown and what doesn't get said aren't really the issue. For even if it were a much less good film than it is, ""A Wall in Jerusalem"" would deserve attention for the fascination of the material it does include, all of which is opposite and most of whichat least to meis unfamiliar.The arrangement of ""A Wall in Jerusalem"" is simply chronological and I much prefer the early to the later historypartly because I know less about it but partly because the film that illustrates it has already acquired some of the dim loveliness that time gives to old movies. There are glimpses of the oldest Zionist settlements, the building of Tel Aviv after World War I, Sir Herbert Samuel (first British high commissioner) ceremoniously celebrating with both Jews and Arabs, a bit of Jewish vaudeville, the Palestinian sunlight on the deserted streets of the old cityprelude to the account of an Arab uprising in Jerusalem.Of course ""A Wall in Jerusalem"" pays its tribute to the Diaspora: East European ghettos in film going back to the turn of the century, Nazi Germany, World War II, the postwar immigrant ships taken by the British virtually at the shores of Palestine.Mr. Rossif's approach to these matters is tactful and intelligent and as reticent about the details of mass suffering as it can decently be. But he is best with the images of Palestine and Israel, valuing both the pioneer Jews and the traditionalist Arabs. And he has succeeded in what seems crucial to such a film, in invoking and understanding the intangible spirit of a place, rather than merely illustrating the stages in a manifest destiny.",1972-04-19T05:00:00+0000

No doubt, the New Windiness will run its course in Lime, too, but in the meantime composers are enjoying a new license to spin out modest materials to neoWagnerian lengths.

It is people who make up the culture and history of their land. If one's reason for going to Europe is to eat at a fancy restaurant or look at a river, it might be better to stay home. On the other hand, if the traveler is drawn by something new and strange, wants to step out of his own culture, regards communication not as a barrier but as a challenge, and goes to meet the European people, then he will have invested his time and money wisely.",1972-04-23T05:00:00+0000

With equal shame they remembered China, which had also met silence when it urged the League to stop Japan. If the world had acted promptly and in concert, would Japan have conquered Manchuria and gone on to wage general war against China and then against others? Would Italy have attacked harmless Ethiopia? Would Germany and Italy have made war against Spain by sending arms and men to support Franco's revolution?

us,Screen: 'A Full Life' and Hani Imprint,"Among Japanese directors younger than the generation of the great mastersOzu, Mizoguchi, Kurosawa  now either dead or partly inactive, I doubt that there is any more widely and affectionately esteemed than Susumu Hani (born in 1928), who entered movies by way of the documentary and now has eight feature films to his credit. Of these only three, comparatively early works, have opened here. But now Hani's first feature, ""A Full Life,"" made in 1962, is being introduced at the New Yorker, to play with Ozu's ""A Tokyo Story."" Together they make a very long, demanding and wonderfully rewarding double bill.Hani's work seems to waver between the expression of a decent, optimistic and slightly deadly liberal humanitarianism (as in ""Bwana Toshi,"" 1965); and the exploration of an intense, personal, somewhat idealized eroticism (as in ""The Inferno of First Love,"" 1968). From their titles the more recent Hani films (""Aido, Slave of Love,"" ""The Grand Adventure of Love""both unreleased here) would seem to lean toward the latter concerns. But ""A Full Life,"" in very responsible ways, balances the claims of public and private interests, and even makes its meaning from a conflict that perhaps remains unsettled  profitably unsettledin the director's mind.The public interests are political, the growth of a leftist activism against the signing of the United States-Japanese security pact in the spring of 1960. Into all this wanders the heroine (played by Ineko Arima), a young Tokyo housewife, a former actress, who is leaving her husband and wants to return to the theater because she needs the income and doesn't really know anything else to do.Essentially the film follows the passage of her days  visits with friends, meetings with her husband, tryouts, a few menial acting jobs, discontent, frustration, involvement with a number of men including the director of her troupe (played by Koshiro Harada), who happens to be her destiny.Making the most of its episodic structure, ""A Full Life"" is in fact over-fullof people, personal vignettes, and all the urban activity sometimes quite enviable activity, that merely demonstrates the emptiness underneath. When the actress finally wins her happiness, it is only at the cost of her freedom. But freedom, like its loss, is a condition open to question, and subject to level upon level of ironic contemplation.In Hani's treatment, such contemplation is not always exciting, but it is never less than interesting and often funny, and endlessly alert to the great modern city with its false promises and real satisfactions. Sometimes ""A Full Life"" is too fashionably handsome (in the early 1960's movies tended toward striking composition) and sometimes it is too schematic. But it keeps opening up into lovely modest discoveries about its people and the worlds they shape to their own needs and desires.The cast is very fine, with many superb minor portraits. Only Ineko Arima has what I guess you'd call a major role, and she achieves an understated tour de force in turning a performance into a subtle personality.",1972-04-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Chabrol Misses:' Ten Days' Wonder' Has Orson Welles in Lead,"Because the four Claude Chabrol films most recently released in this country  ""Les Biches,"" ""La Femme Infidle,"" ""This Man Must Die"" and ""Le Boucher""  have been such elegant works, even when a couple of them turned out to be considerably less substantial than was first apparent, there is an almost irresistible urge to give intellectual status to the banality of his latest film, ""Ten Days' Wonder.""I won't try, however. The task would be about as much fun as writingor readinga monograph on the Manichean dualism evident in the gumshoe oeuvre of Ellery Queen.The name Ellery Queen isn't exactly a wild association. ""Ten Days' Wonder"" is an English-language adaptation of the Queen novel about a domineering father, his beautiful young wife, the adopted son who has fallen in love with the wife, and the blackmail plot that threatens the pair.The location has been shifted from a drab small town in the United States to an 80-room villa on a magnificent private estate in Alsaca. The characters' names have been changed to Chabrol's favorite Paul, Hlne and Charles, for no purpose I can think of (except, perhaps, as a vain bid for good luck), and their manners, dress and eating habits have been more or less upgraded by the imposition of a certain bizarre, upper-class chic.Old Theo (Orson Welles), the billionaire lord of the manor, has not only chosen the place where he wants to live, but also the time, 1925, which was, for him, a very good year. Thus his lovely Hlne (Marlene Jobert) is required to wear flapper frocks, bob her hair and drive an ancient Rolls, while his son, Charles (Anthony Perkins), when he's in residence at home, affects knickers, and plaid socks and sweaters for croquet, and old-fashioned, stiff-colared tuxedos for the formal family dinners.It all begins promisingly when Charles comes out of what seems to have been a drug-induced bout of amnesia in a sleazy Parisian hotel. ""I woke up with blood all over me,"" he tells his friend and former professor, Paul (Michel Piccoli), the Ellery Queen character, revealing a bit of information that is never referred to again. Paul agrees to return to Alsace to try to help Paul, who is afraid he is going to kill someone.Almost at once, the film becomes a pretentiously preposterous who-is-doing-it (the blackmail, that is), with great hunks of what sounds like dumb Queen dialogue shooting up from the cloudy depths like the suddenly loosened timbers from a ship that's just sunk.Unlike ""La Femme Infidle"" and ""Le Boucher,"" the best of recent Chabrol, which investigated the responsibilities and the penalties of love in terms of characters of great feeling, ""Ten Days' Wonder"" is mostly plot, and not a terribly good one at that, its fairly predictable dnouement depending on a rudimentary awareness of bedside Freud and a vague recollection of the Ten Commandments.Everybody in the cast looks uncomfortable, particularly Welles, who either has had a very bad make-up job or has let his nose turn gray. Perkins gives one of his youthfully manic performances in a bad cause, and Miss Jobert seems mostly pretty and puzzled. Everybody gets to speak his share of thankless lines, but maybe Piccoli has more than the others. Even in a so-called suspense melodrama, it must be difficult to keep a straight face while saying something like ""There is no place among men for gods like you.""I used to think that Chabrol was the only director who could be trusted to use the zoom lens properly. Not so. He's gone so giddy with it here that ""Ten Days' Wonder,"" as it zooms in and out of scenes, takes on the rhythm of an unexcited heartbeat.",1972-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen,"Although its producer, David Gil, insists that ""Journey Through Rosebud"" is ""the first totally honest and objective portrait of the contemporary American Indian on film,"" it takes a great deal of wishful interpretation to avoid seeing the movie as an invasionrather than as an illuminationof a social problem.The film, directed by Tom Gries (who once made a very good, very somber Western called ""Will Penny""), is as well-meaning and boob-brained as its hero, Danny (Kristoffer Tabori), a principled young draft-dodger whom we first see as he wanders lonely as a cloud across a hilltop singing ""America the Beautiful."" He doesn't actually wander. He struts (it seems as if he knows there's a camera near), and he throws up the movie's ironies like a bulldozer plowing through daffodils.Danny, who is looking for sanctuary, hitchhikes into Rosebud, the South Dakota Sioux reservation. He stays around to marvel at their rituals, including the kind of tribal dances that must always look picturesque to the outsider, and to sympathize with their frustrations as represented by Frank (Robert Forster), a young Sioux Vietnam veteran whose life has been pretty much reduced to beer drinking and small gestures of defiance towards the white sheriff and the Indian agent.After one arbitrary thing and another, Danny suddenly finds himself acting like a token offering, the feeble, unwitting victim of an assault that the movie seems to mean as a setting to rights of the massacre at Wounded Knee.Among the few unembarrassing things in the film is the performance by Mr. Forster (""Justine,"" ""Medium Cool""), who is such an easy, unaffected actor that he doesn't look out of place among the large number of real Indians who are in the supporting cast, and whom the camera treats as if they were holy relics. Victoria Racimo, who is pretty and looks faintly Eurasian, plays Forster's former wife, an Indian militant who is required to say things like ""I'm an Indian and I'm going to walk in beauty like the medicine men say.""It is, I suppose, as much a comment on the dopily earnest tone of the film itself, as on the state of socially conscious filmmaking, that much of ""Journey Through Rosebud"" sounds like a parody of Black Consciousness movies and television plays usually made by humorless whites.""Journey Through Rosebud,"" which opened yesterday at the Murray Hill, is described as the first motion picture to be made entirely on an Indian reservation. This information I will file with my list of other firsts, including the fact that Samuel Fuller's ""Hell and High Water"" was the first movie about a submarine ever photographed in Cinema-Scope. Contemporary Indians have been better treated by educational television in documentaries that may or may not have been filmed entirely on the reservation.",1972-04-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Whifney Film Program,"Both Rawn Fulton's ""Sun River"" and Larry Jordan's ""Sacred Art of Tibet,"" which opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum, deal in relations between the Western mind and Eastern forms of social spiritual organization.The experience behind ""Sun River"" is Mr. Fulton's two years of Peace Corps service in rural India. The impetus behind ""Sacred Art of Tibet"" is a San Francisco showing of Tibetan art objects and Mr. Jordan's intention to suggest their significance on film.""Sun River"" seems to me the more nearly successful, partly because it is the more personal and, for obvious reasons, the more active of the two movies. It makes use of a very rapid montage technique, sometimes slowing down to give a moment or a gesture full play, sometimes speeding up to present a sequence in a succession of images so compacted that passing time achieves a kind of rich lyrical density for the eye.The method is neither startling nor especially new. But it works beautifully for the sort of highly knowledgeable in-depth travelogue that ""Sun River"" very largely is.The objects in ""Sacred Art of Tibet""statuettes of the Buddha, scroll paintings, the intricately detailed cloth-mounted paintings known as tankasare each offered on display, each briefly identified by a Tibetan lama (resident in Berkeley, Calif.), and each followed by little film essays meant to be somehow expressive of its significance.But whatever Larry Jordan intended to have going on in his movie, I don't think that anything much does. A statuette on a revolving pedestal remains a statuette on a revolving pedestal; and the camera ranging over parts of a scroll painting expresses nothing so much as the incapacity of the partial, moving image ever properly to comprehend a still whole.""Sacred Art of Tibet"" manages neither to teach nor to delight, and it seems to remain always on the outside of the ways of understanding it claims to celebrate.",1972-04-28T05:00:00+0000

Mainly they sit around jawing about the rigors of Army life.It is truly embarrassing to watch this slapdash, sloppy and utterly superficial movie, based on fact and purporting to show the tensions and bravery of the 10th Cavalry, most of them former slaves, under white command at Fort Davis, Tex. Only the fort seems real.Let's modify that. So do the burning eyes of Isaac Fields, as a tough black sergeant. Curiously impressive, too, is the rudimentary acting of Rafer Johnson, underscored with his natural dignity and stoical silences. A few whites, such as Cesar Romero, as the fort commander, and Barbara Hale bring up the rear with some dignity.But the general acting, keyed by Janee Michelle, Robert DoQui and Lincoln Kilpatrick as the marital triangle, and the dialogue, the direction and even the music, which sounds like a Cotton Club revival, are plain painful.

us,Poitier Directs 'Buck and the Preacher',"""Buck and the Preacher,"" Sidney Poitier's first film as director as well as star, is a loose, amiable, post-Civil War Western with a firm though not especially severe Black Conscience. The film is aware of contemporary black issues but its soul is on the plains once ridden by Tom Mix, whom Poitier, astride his galloping horse, his jaw set, somehow resembles in the majestic traveling shots given him by the director.The movie, which opened yesterday at the DeMille and Columbia II Theaters, is about a trail guide named Buck (Poitier), who devotes himself to protecting former slaves seeking to homestead in a West infested with bounty hunters. With what I suspect is the complete co-operation of Poitier, the film is stolen almost immediately by Harry Belafonte as a bogus preacher of the High and Low Order of the Holiness Persuasion Church.Belafonte has mellowed considerably as an actor since his matinee idol days in things like ""Island in the Sun"" and his performance here seems limited only by the simple material. His Preacher is a high-spirited con artist with bad teeth, a patulous eye and some dark memories that give the film its few moments of dramatic distinction.""Buck and the Preacher"" is otherwise a perfectly ordinary example of the kind of Western that seeks to prove that the West was not lily-white. The movie West, of course, has never been completely lily-white. There have always been a certain number of Indians horsing around, scalping, drinking, shooting, getting shot, and being poorly dealt with by just about everybody, including the movie makers. For the most part, however, blacks showed up on the frontier only as servants or, occasionally, as outcasts and loners, most notably in Ford's ""Sergeant Rutledge"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance."" If they do nothing else, these new Soul Westerns may serve to desegregate our myths, which have always been out of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.",1972-04-29T05:00:00+0000

The authorities are aware of the $30 forgeries now being peddled around most of our major campuses. One of these forgeries was offered to me for inspection by a sweet young thing from U.C.L.A. and, so help me, I could see no difference between her pass and mine. Another warning: the pass now has a space for the stamp of the first station from which the pass is used.

us,Twenty Million ItalianAmericans,"THE persistent myth of a monolithic ItalianAmerican subculture called the Mafia presents a set of dilemmas for ItalianAmericans. To the average person in this country, the SicilianAmerican norm is seen as identical with Mafia in a selflocking stereotype. ItalianAmericans are offered a bigoted choice of two identities somewhat paralleling the two imposed on blacks. Blacks could be childlike, laughing, Uncle Tom figures or sullen, incorrigible, violent, knifewielding criminals. Similarly, the nativistic American mentality, born of ignorance and nurtured by malice, insists that ItalianAmericans be either/or creatures. They must be either spaghettitwirling, operabellowing buffoons in undershirts (as in the TV commercial with its famous line, That'sa some spicy meatball), or swarthy, sinister hoods in garish stets, shirts and ties. The incredible exploitation of The Godfather testifies to the power of the Mafia myth today.",1972-04-30T05:00:00+0000

It is the product of centuries of education, of frozen culture, customs and forms, Let one American who has spent most of his adult life in Paris reassure the tourist that he need not penetrate the French home to understand French life. Skillfully skimming the surface is almost sufficient. The alternative is to marry a French man or woman. Note at a cafe, for instance, the relations between the sexes. They are remarkably the same in the home. There is a communication that explains at least in part why French feminisme has (so far) never assumed the violent proportions of suffragette and women's lib movements in England and America.",1972-04-30T05:00:00+0000
