us,U.S. Retaliates on Latest Asian Export: The Flying Roach,"Imagine a New York City cockroach with chutzpah. It has wings, a preference for bright lights and a sex drive so lusty it can produce 75 million offspring a year. That's the Asian roach, Blatella asahinai, and it has been vacationing in Florida this winter since arriving on cargo ships from Asia. It is expected to move north. Killing cockroaches is big business - American consumers spend $2 billion a year in the effort - and flying cockroaches are expected to stimulate the market. Most current insecticides are effective against the newcomer, but scientists fear it may develop resistance to chemicals, as has its cousin in New York, the German roach. Entomologists at the Agriculture Department's Research Service in Gainesville, Fla., are developing compounds designed to attract Asian roaches. These attractants could be combined with toxic chemicals or substances that render the roaches sterile, the scientists said. The center has already contributed to the success of several commercial products including hydramethylnon, found in Combat bait trays, and hydroprene, the cockroach birth control. American Home Products, maker of Black Flag insecticides, is doing its part by providing consumers with all the information they could possibly want -and more - on the new insect pest.",1987-04-01T05:00:00+0000

The 76ers led, 83-80, with 2:36 remaining in the third quarter but outscored the Cavaliers, 10-5, over the rest of the period and then went on a 9-0 run to take a 102-85 lead with 8:32 left. (AP) Bulls 101, Bullets 75: Michael Jordan scored 36 points as Chicago clinched a playoff berth. The Bulls took control with a 16-0 surge in a six-minute span during the second quarter to go from a 34-31 deficit to a 47-34 lead. Jeff Malone led Washington with 22 points. Chicago led, 31-26, at the end of the first quarter, with Jordan scoring 16 points. (AP) BOXING Defending Champion Advances: Kenneth Gould, the defending two-time welterweight champion, scored a 5-0 decision over Derrick Rolon in a preliminary bout yesterday at the United States Boxing Championships in Buffalo. Rolon, 18 years old, of Elizabeth, N.J., was a National Golden Gloves quarterfinalist at 147 pounds in 1986. The tournament, conducted by the United States of America Amateur Boxing Federation, uses Olympic-style scoring based on how many punches hit with the white part of the gloves. The tournament is the first of four major amateur boxing competitions this year, leading to the 1988 Olympic trials. (AP) TENNIS Connors Advances: Second-seeded Jimmy Connors survived a first-set tiebreaker loss and rallied to win the second set before his opponent, Todd Witsken, dropped out because of the flu in an opening-round match of the $315,000 Volvo Chicago tournament last night. The 34-year-old Connors advanced, 6-7, 6-2, 2-1, when Witsken of Carmel, Ind., retired. In other first-round action, third-seeded Tim Mayotte of Bradenton, Fla., took just 53 minutes to oust Derrick Rostagno of Brentwood, Calif., 6-1, 6-1. (AP) Mandlikova Beats Smylie: Top-seeded Hana Mandlikova of Czechoslovakia defeated Australia's Elizabeth Smylie 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, in a bitter battle last night to advance to the second round of the United States Women's Indoor championships at Piscataway, N.J. It was the first time the two have met since Smylie upset Mandlikova in the third round at Wimbledon in 1985. Earlier in the day, Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia and Australia's Wendy Turnbull scored second-round victories, but seventh-seeded Melissa Gurney was upset. Gigi Fernandez of Puerto Rico, unseeded and ranked 56th in the world, reached the quarterfinals with an unexpectedly easy 6-3, 6-0 vitory over the 17th-ranked Gurney. Sukova, who is seeded second, dominated Ann Henricksson with big serves to advance to the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-3 victory, while the 34-year-old Turnbull took the last six games in defeating Kathrin Keil, 6-4, 6-1. Fourth-seeded Lori McNeil won a first-round match, defeating Susan Rimes, 6-0, 6-4, while Barbara Potter cracked 14 aces in a 6-3, 6-2 triumph over Pilar Vasquez of Peru.

It appeared to be the most important and successful rebel operation in recent years. Page A1 The Pope labeled Chile a dictatorship and insisted that the Roman Catholic Church must struggle to bring democracy to the nation. John Paul II spoke to reporters aboard a plane carrying him to South America. A1 William Webster will be questioned about Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d's handling of the Iran-contra affair at hearings next month on Mr. Webster's nomination to be Director of Central Intelligence. A6 A third embassy guard was arrested Sunday on suspicion that he violated regulations against social contacts with Soviet women, the Pentagon said. The enlisted man has not been charged with espionage. A1 All nations must support ''glasnost,'' Andrei D. Sakharov told Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over lunch. ''A more democratic, more open country is safer for the world as a whole,'' he said. A1 Moscow has asked for help from several Western nations in fighting terrorism and has suggested that treaties be negotiated to provide for the return of terrorist suspects, according to diplomats. A3 Israeli officials were divided in their assessment of reports that Moscow would soon permit large-scale Soviet Jewish emigration directly to Israel and more freedom of religion for Soviet Jews. A9 A3 A Socialist Party convention in Italy opened yesterday, paving the way for the possible formation of a new government. Five parties of the governing coalition are struggling to rearrange their alliance. A5 Chirac assured in Reagan talks A7 Peace reigns along Artic border A11 Senators urge diplomacy in Latin America A12 National A14-22 The House easily overrode the veto by President Reagan of the $87.9 billion highway bill, leaving the Senate as the battleground for a major test of Mr. Reagan's power in his final 22 months in office. A1 A $38.3 billion housing bill was approved by the Senate. The bill, which rejects the efforts of the President to cut housing programs, would break a seven-year deadlock in Congress over housing policy. A14 Credit for discovering the AIDS virus will be shared by researchers from the U.S. and France, President Reagan and Prime Minister Chirac announced. The unusual agreement ends a festering scientific dispute. A1 Japan may deny visas to foreigners who are known to carry the AIDS virus and are considered ''likely to spread the virus to many people.'' A spokesman said the country does not plan to screen all foreigners. A18 A hospital faces loss of funds from Medicare and Medicaid because of the transfer of uninsured poor patients to other hospitals. The Government has begun an investigation into five such cases at the hospital in San Pablo, Calif. A17 Public employers may search employees' offices, desks and files without warrants or probable cause, the Supreme Court ruled. But it rejected the idea that there are no limits on such searches. A15 The Justice Department renewed its attack on a local affirmative action plan in the District of Columbia in spite of last week's Supreme Court decision upholding the legality of such programs. A14 Students at black colleges are bearing the brunt of Federal grant cutbacks and are falling deeply into debt to finance their education, according to a new study. A19 The cowboy and his spirit survives.

Despite the defeat, the Bullets clinched a playoff spot because Cleveland, ninth in the Eastern Conference ,lost. Boston went on an 11-2 run that made the score 76-66 with 3:14 to go in the third quarter.

The number of games shown by the two outlets, a reversal of the pattern of recent years, results from a court ruling over conflicting contracts the Yankees signed with SportsChannel and WPIX. ''This is our first year as the primary broadcaster of Yankee games and we wanted to establish our own identity,'' said Larry Wahl, a spokesman for SportsChannel, when asked why Rizzuto and White were dropped. Harrelson, who broadcast games for both the White Sox and Red Sox before moving to the front office, had a nine-year major-league playing career that ended in 1971.

The actions came six weeks after Brazil stopped interest payments on the debt. The move will cost BankAmerica $40 million in first-quarter net income, while Morgan will lose $20 million and Manufacturers $18 million. Talks with Brazil begin next week, and the banks predicted an accord. [ Page D1. ] Topps plans to go public again, three years after going private. The baseball card and bubble gum concern intends to sell 4.5 million shares, or a 31 percent stake, for $15 to $18 a share, giving its current owners a paper profit of more than $140 million.

us,Q&A,"Q.We don't like the color of the newly renovated cabinets and counter tops in the kitchen and bath of our co-op. Since they are new, it is senseless to replace them. Can we paint them another color? A.You can paint them with any good quality alkyd enamel, but once painted they will have to be repainted regularly. Also, no paint will hold up for long on counter tops if you cut or scratch the surface when preparing food, or if you scrub with abrasive cleaners. If you do paint, make sure the surfaces are perfectly clean.Lightly sand all surfaces thoroughly to give the slick surface some ''tooth'' so the paint will bond better. Q.When I had my house treated for termites the exterminators drilled holes in the concrete floor of the basement to inject chlordane into the soil. They filled the holes with half-inch-thick plugs of cement and sand, but after the first heavy rain the plugs were loose and the basement was full of water. The exterminators then packed the holes with tightly rolled plastic, driving it down three or four inches; they poured in volcanic ash and again plugged the final half inch with cement and sand. But the plugs still work loose and leak. What should have been done? A.It sounds as if the holes were never properly patched or filled. Instead of using half-inch cement plugs, the holes should be filled with poured concrete that is at least as deep as the thickness of the concrete floor (usually four inches). A latex binder should be added to the new concrete to assure a solid bond between the new and the old. Q.Eight years ago I had front steps built outside my house, made with brick risers and limestone treads that are two inches thick. All four treads have developed hairline cracks and I am afraid freezing and thawing will cause them to widen. Is there a filler that I can use that will not be unsightly? A.Chances are that any patching material or filler will be visible, but how visible is hard to tell. You can experiment in one corner with a white patching cement or with a white epoxy cement to see if the patch is objectionable. Remember, however, that hairline cracks are almost impossible to fill without first cutting them out wider; this, of course, will make the patches even more noticeable. You may be able to fill them with a brush-on epoxy coating in clear or white, but test this in a corner, also.

Teltscher advanced to today's semifinal, in which he will face third-seeded Tim Mayotte. Bill Scanlon will play the second semifinal against the winner of the Mel Purcell-David Pate match. Mayotte, of Bradenton, Fla., played almost-errorless tennis to dispose of Peter Fleming of Glen Cove, L.I., 6-2, 6-3.

Teltscher's victory marked the first time the native of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., was able to beat Connors in 16 meetings dating to 1979. Connors raced to an early 2-0 first-set advantage with a break in the opening game. But Teltscher put aside his serving problems by breaking Connors in the sixth and eighth games for a 5-3 advantage, then took the first set when Connors hit a return into the net. Connors, who plays out of Sanibel Harbour, Fla., then lost the opening serve of the second set en route to a 4-0 deficit.

Page 1 Two more marines are implicated in violations of security rules at the United States Embassy in Moscow, raising concerns that they may have allowed Soviet agents to enter the building, Representative Les Aspin said. 1 News analysis: Soviet-Israeli ties are so explosive an issue that any Israeli government seeking to resume an alliance with Moscow will face political obstacles that could stall the budding Soviet-Israeli detente. 3 Hungary denounced Rumania in an expansion of a long-smoldering dispute between the two European allies of the Soviet Union. The dispute centers on the right to identity of about 2 million Hungarians who live in Rumania. 5 Vigilante groups in the Phillipines get support from many military and Government leaders, including Corazon C. Aquino, even as fears have grown that a new form of anti-Communist armed terror has taken root in this violent nation. 5 In Chile, the police used tear gas and water cannons to battle anti-Govern ment protesters as Pope John Paul II was saying a beatification mass in a large public park. 3 Greece may seize church property within six months, under legislation approved by Parliament. The decision sharpened a fierce dispute between the Greek Orthodox church and the state. 3 Japan is talking about 'Iwate shock,' a phrase symbolizing the strong, widening opposition to the Prime Minister's plans for a new 5 percent sales tax, that started in Morioka and the rest of Iwate Prefecture, a rice-growing center. 2 Far-right Afrikaaners have established an electoral stronghold in Nylstroom, about 80 miles north of Pretoria. The Conservative leader, Andries P. Treurnicht, is assured of another victory there. 4 Portugal's government falls 2 New split over P.L.O. amity effort 28 Palestinian aid blocked in Beirut 28 NATIONAl 6-8, 14 A stampede to raise the speed limit on highways in largely rural states to 65 miles an hour was not being followed in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where all three Governors have made clear their opposition. 1 On Wall Street, a grand flourish in the stock market capped off a tumultuous week. The Dow Jones industrial average tallied its largest single-day advance ever, pushing up nearly 70 points just five days after it plummeted almost 60 points. 1 Lack of unity in the Republican Party has been revealed by the overriding of the President's veto of the highway bill, Senate Republicans said, raising concern about their effectiveness as a minority. 14 The unemployment rate edged down to 6.5 percent in March but job growth slowed sharply, the Government reported. The data were on the whole less robust than expected, analysts said. 7 Space station plans were scaled back by the President, who approved a delay in the projected date for manning the station for research, a decision designed to cut the project's rapidly rising estimated costs. 6 When Dallas voters go to the polls Saturday they will be deciding the most costly and perhaps the most wide-open mayoral election in the city's history. Four wealthy, probusiness contenders are politely vying for the job. 6 Smoking restrictions in Beverly Hills limit it in most restaurants, retail stores and at public meetings under a new law. The ordinance was passed unanimously by the Beverly Hills City Council last month. 6 Indictments against neo-Nazis in Arkansas may be issued soon, officials say. A Federal grand jury has investigated terrorist activity by right-wing extremist groups for months. 7 Use of child labor in New England appears to be increasing, a response to a shortage of workers created by demographic changes and an economy with growing opportunities in low-skilled hourly jobs. 7 A storm snarled the Deep South with its first April snow accumulation on record, closing schools, disrupting power to thousands and dropping more than a foot of snow on Appalachia. 8 Lightning tied to rocket failure 6 F.B.I. investigates Thiokol 6 Regional 29-31, 50 Revision of New York's tax code -lowering the maximum tax rate on wages to 7 percent from the current 9 percent - was agreed to today by leaders of the State Legislature and appeared virtually certain to become law. 1 Jersey has the lowest unemployment rate among industrial states, the Department of Labor said. Massachusetts had held the number one spot for 36 months, but in March, its rate was 3.9 percent, while New Jersey's was 3.7 percent. 1 Siphoning of funds from the Intrepid Air-Sea-Space Museum was disclosed by investigators. They said labor racketeering by a Manhattan gang called the Westies defrauded the museum of extensive funds. 1 An upstate hotel may be a shelter for homeless men from New York City. If the plan goes ahead and weathers opposition, up to 600 men would live and work at the Catskills resort. 29 No stay on the Baby M ruling will be granted pending an appeal, a three-judge appeals court ruled in refusing Mary Beth Whitehead's request. The judges said they did not want to disrupt the child's life. 29 More AIDS patients in hospitals in New York City are taking up beds that Federal health planners said would not be needed for AIDS victims until 1990, private and municipal hospital officials said. 31 A setback for the 63d Street subway tunnel came when Federal officials said they would not release money for the project's completion until the Transit Authority proved it would meet fire safety standards. 31 ''Black cars'' take over from taxis 29 Rise in values spurs rescue of buildings 29 Ethics money may be denied 30 TV mouse roars back at Mayor 31 Scalia on the law and morals 32",1987-04-04T05:00:00+0000

us,IT'S TIME TO USE THE SPADE AND TROWEL,"THE rush is on to plant, rake, feed and seed. Even though the weather is ''iffy'' at times, April is the month to put the garden in order. Rake, feed and seed bare spots in lawns. But tender vegetables and annuals should be kept waiting until next month; this means delay planting of peppers, tomatoes, eggplants and seed of beans, especially limas, corn, squash and melons. Flowering plants such as impatiens, marigolds, coleus and petunias also need warmer soil and nights until they can be set out. Roses. Clean up and remove any of last season's leaves, prune and feed all rosebushes; start the spray program to discourage diseases. Weeds. A perennial problem, they are best conquered before the plants appear. This means putting down pre-emergent weed controls on lawns especially to control crabgrass. For lawn grasses the most common pre-emergent weed controls are benefin, bensulide, trifluran and siduron. These materials should be put down when the forsythia blooms and before lilac fades. Trifluran is also now packaged under several trade names for use on garden borders and utility areas where it can prevent unsightly weeds from sprouting. But read the rate/caution label carefully before application, as some ornamental plants are particularly sensitive to pre-emergent weed control.

Player and Bob Charles were joined by the tandem of Bruce Crampton-Harold Henning in shooting six-under-par 66 totals that provided 9 points apiece for the International team. Peter Thomson and Roberto DeVicenzo shot a 68 to add 5 points to the team total as the Internationals earned 26 of 34 points awarded and moved to within 5 points of victory over the same eight-man United States team that won the inaugural Chrysler Cup event 68-31 a year ago.(AP) Boxing Curry Retains Crown: Donald Curry successfully defended his United States Boxing Association junior middleweight in Las Vegas, Nev., yesterday when his opponent, Carlos Santos, was disqualified for excessive head-butting by Referee Carlos Padilla at 2:25 of the fifth round of a scheduled 12-round bout. After two warnings, Padilla deducted a point from Santos for butting in the fourth round. And when Santos was guilty of the same infraction a round later, Padilla stepped between the fighters and signaled the judges to deduct another point. When Santos lowered his head against Curry and opened a cut on the champion's right brow in the fifth round, Padilla waved an end to the fight, disqualifying Santos. Curry's record goes to 27-1. Santos is now 30-3.

The outpouring of literary work is so great as to obscure itself, too great to be attended to with the kind of care a slenderer production would allow. It is a novelty to treat the writing of poetry as an academic subject, but to do it merely expresses the cultural expectation that every worthy enterprise should take the form of learning. Out of this assumption comes the privileged place of the universities themselves, which function, like the medieval cities they have often been built to resemble, as the protectors and sponsors of arts and skills and crafts, as the guarantors of extraordinary freedom to those intent upon some business of their own that has no established place in the outside world.",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN,"WILHELMINA HOLLIDAY, touring a museum in Vienna years ago with her husband, was taken with the work of Clara Peeters. Returning to the United States, she attempted to find out more about Peeters. What she found was not only that Peeters was absent from H. W. Janson's ''History of Art,'' but that no other woman artist was included either. Today there is a painting by Peeters hung in the dining room of Mrs. Holliday's Georgetown house. ''Still Life of Fish and Cat,'' acquired about 10 years ago, is indeed the work of a talented person working within the Dutch still life tradition (Peeters was a contemporary of Rembrandt). You could lift this oyster out of the painting; it is so convincingly rendered that you instantly remember the touch and taste of the real thing. The cat stretched above the assortment of food is not a cat anyone would have wanted then or now. Beauty is tempered by an almost chaotic lushness: The ubiquitous cat and prey are pushed to an intensity that makes the modern eye wonder about this painter's wish to comfort with the conventions of the time. Perhaps she felt a kinship with DeHeem, whose paintings of flowers, lush yet teeming with bugs and snails fallen to the tables beneath them, mock any simple ideas of beauty.",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

Sure enough, no editor or agent recognized the book, not even the publisher who had originally brought it out, and no one thought it was worth publishing.

In his celebrated 1893 essay on the West, Frederick Jackson Turner wrote: ''And now, four centuries from the discovery of America, at the end of a hundred years of life under the constitution, the frontier has gone.'' But the frontier had not gone; in fact, it's still here, according to Murray Melbin, only it's not geographic but temporal. It's the night. Like the Old West, the night is at once romanticized and feared, the realm of both fraternity and lawlessness. The prime denizens of darkness, Mr. Melbin observes, are the same people who first went West: young men with few social obligations. ''Night as Frontier'' documents this increasing colonization of darkness. In 1946, Seven-11 stores were open from 7 A.M. to 11 P.M.; by 1978, 82 percent of the 6,599 Seven-11 stores were open around the clock. Citing various sources, Mr. Melbin, a professor of sociology at Boston University, notes that in 1972, Americans averaged 7.83 hours of sleep a night; by 1984, the average had dropped closer to seven. O.K., but is any of this surprising or insightful? Mr. Melbin's one intriguing conclusion - that night people hate day people - rests on a dubious study in which, among other projects, Mr. Melbin's scrupulous undercover research team sprinkled Boston streets with house keys attached to tags with an address 90 miles away and the request ''Please return.'' Having already learned that night folk were more likely to give directions to strangers than day folk were, the researchers were surprised to find that night people returned fewer keys. Mr. Melbin's explanation is that night people help only their own kind; they didn't return the keys because they assumed that they belonged to day people. Why they should assume this is not clear. I can think of other explanations. Perhaps night people are smarter than day people and concluded that a house key with an address on it was too weird to take seriously.",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

These 20 morally urgent, intellectually rigorous essays by the psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton encourage us to hope for the future, even though nuclear weapons pose an unprecedented threat of total destruction. The demonstrated capacity of mankind for evil and ''our misguided relationships to technology'' - both of which Dr. Lifton has explored at length in his books on Vietnam, Hiroshima and the Holocaust - have never led him to despair, but to some lessons for our time. The Nazi doctors at Auschwitz taught us that professional healers may participate in mass murder by creating another self (a ''double'' in the literary sense of the term). Survivors of Hiroshima, having been immersed in death, experienced an ''emotional desensitization'' that, in another form, allowed the creators of the bomb to inure themselves psychologically to the horrors they wrought. Vietnam veterans often transformed their ''psychic numbing'' into ''animating guilt'' - inarticulate rage became principled opposition as they bore witness to the human waste in an unwinnable war. Understanding victims and victimizers helps us understand that ''unlimited atrocity'' in which we could become both: the self-extermination of the species in nuclear holocaust. The ''imagery of extinction'' pervades our lives and our literature, as Dr. Lifton argues in persuasive essays on such seemingly disparate subjects as religious cults, the strategic defense initiative and contemporary theater. Having diagnosed our fears of futurelessness, Dr. Lifton prescribes an end to our dependency on and worship of nuclear weapons. For only if we heed his measured call to disarmament can we reaffirm human continuity - the ordinary cycle of life and death that, in the past, gave us faith.",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"BEDSIDE MANNERS: The Troubled History of Doctors and Patients, by Edward Shorter. (Touchstone/ Simon & Schuster, $9.95.) The centuries-old, ever-shifting relationship between doctors and patients ''resembles an intense, stylized and changeable dance'' in this study, Fitzhugh Mullan said in The Book Review last year. The author, he said, ''provides us with a solid historical analysis of our medical system and a provocative diagnosis of our current status.'' LIFE AND FATE, by Vasily Grossman. Translated by Robert Chandler. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $10.95.) Completed in 1960 and smuggled out of the Soviet Union, Vasily Grossman's novel ''is a passionate onslaught against state-sponsored political terror,'' whether of the Stalinist or Hitlerite variety, Ronald Hingley said here in 1986. Its hero, Viktor Shtrum, is a Soviet nuclear physicist who becomes the target of an anti-Semitic witch hunt in the early 1940's. Grossman's ''account of Soviet life - penal, military and civilian - is encyclopedic and unblinkered,'' the reviewer said. ''Love affairs, divorces, the problems of acquiring a ration card or a residence permit - they are all here, the tragic and the trivial side by side.'' AFTER THE NIGHTMARE: Inside China Today, by Liang Heng and Judith Shapiro. (Collier/Macmillan, $8.95.) Liang Heng, a writer, left China as a dissident student in 1981 and returned four years later with his American wife, Judith Shapiro, to note the changes in his homeland, his family and his friends. Last year our reviewer, Carolyn Wakeman, called this account of their journey ''a moving catalogue of victims 'sacrificed on the altar of Mao's revolution,' '' and ''a compelling glimpse of the society that is being rebuilt on the ashes of the Cultural Revolution.'' HANDLING SIN, by Michael Malone. (Pocket, $4.95.) Raleigh W. Hayes, a 45-year-old member in good standing of the Thermopylae, N.C., Civitan Club, sets out on a sort of literary scavenger hunt that takes him and a circus of supporting players through the Southern states. Michael Malone's novel is a ''hilarious success,'' A. C. Greene said here in 1986. His ''twists and turns and surprises are downright phenomenal, verging on genius. There are entire chapters in this book that are funny, sentence by sentence.'' BOSTON BOY, by Nat Hentoff. (Faber & Faber, $7.95.) Nat Hentoff's book is a memoir not only of his youth but of the Boston of the 1930's and 40's, and of the Savoy Cafe, where he encountered the world of jazz and jazzmen. The work ''should be appreciated not only by adults who grew up through the fires of their own rebellion, but by those restless young people who are now bringing their own views and questions to the world they are inheriting,'' Dan Wakefield said here in 1986. SWORD AT SUNSET, by Rosemary Sutcliff. (Tor, $4.50.) Rosemary Sutcliff's historical novel reinvents King Arthur, and the result, while far from the accepted legend, is ''an expression of the purest affection for the Arthur of her heart,'' Robert Payne said in The Book Review in 1963. ''He is a living presence who moves in a brilliantly lit and fantastic landscape only remotely connected with ancient England. And why not?'' THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW, by Wade Davis. (Warner, $4.95.) In 1982 the author, a graduate student at Harvard University, went to Haiti to investigate voodoo sorcery and the potions that can reduce the body's metabolic rate. This chronicle of his adventures ''smacks of show business,'' Jim Haskins said in these pages in 1986. But he called the writing lyrical and the story ''a romantic, highly readable combination of Haitian history, folklore and culture, not to mention pharmacology and ethnobotany.'' HERBS AND APPLES, by Helen Hooven Santmyer. (St. Martin's, $4.95.) This nostalgic, semi-autobiographical novel by the author of ''. . . And Ladies of the Club'' follows the fortunes of an Ohio schoolgirl who dreams of becoming an author. The character ''emerges as a capably drawn addition to the thoughtful tomboy breed of heroines - those appealing protofeminists who have long kept energetic girls glued to the page,'' Ann Hulbert said in The Book Review in 1985. A LESSER LIFE: The Myth of Women's Liberation in America, by Sylvia Ann Hewlett. (Warner, $10.95.) The claim that women can ''have it all'' is to blame for the impossible choices facing them in the conflicting worlds of home and the wage market, the author asserts. She uses women's ''powerful, personal . . . poignant stories'' to back her case, Sylvia A. Law said here last year. But ''problems of sexism run deep and strike close to home. An analysis that feminists are responsible for the impossible choices confronting women and all people today is comforting, particularly to those who have no interest in change. It is also wrong.'' CLARA'S HEART, by Joseph Olshan. (Ballantine, $3.95.) Joseph Olshan's first novel is about the complex relationship between a young boy and the middle-aged Jamaican woman who works as a governess-housekeeper for his wealthy New York family. In 1985 our reviewer, Howard Fraser Mosher, described it as ''sensitive and often comical.'' LETTERS TO JUDY: What Kids Wish They Could Tell You, by Judy Blume. (Pocket, $4.50.) The author offers a sampling of her young readers' letters asking advice on topics including sex, drugs, crushes, problems with parents and other worries. ''The book is not a how-to manual,'' Elizabeth Winship said here last year, ''but one compassionate and popular author's way to help parents see life through their children's eyes.'' BAD MANNERS, by Maggie Paley. (Penguin, $3.50.) Maggie Paley's first novel consists of telephone dialogue among four best friends, women in their late 30's. This is a ''mean and funny'' book by ''a practiced observer of modern mores,'' our reviewer, Susan Braudy, said in 1986. ''Read it, and wince while you laugh.''",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

Health care in the United States is already rationed, Howard Hiatt argues; the country urgently needs a fairer apportioning of resources that will never be limitless. Those whose bills are paid with the help of private or Government health insurance get more than their share, he contends, while more than 35 million Americans - one-third of them children -are left to scramble for medical attention. ''Jumbled policies and blinkered initiatives are literally killing many of us,'' Dr. Hiatt insists in this clear and persuasive book. The United States spends $450 billion a year on health, but ranks 17th among nations in low infant mortality, 16th in life expectancy. Dr. Hiatt, a professor of medicine at Harvard University Medical School and its School of Public Health, prescribes health insurance for all. He suggests regional control, as in Canada, perhaps by state agencies. Everyone would have a doctor who is a general practitioner, as in Britain - where people live slightly longer than Americans and most physicians get along without six-figure incomes. He is candid about British deficiencies, notably long waits for nonemergency services, and the fact that ''many fewer Britons with kidney failure between fifty and sixty-five years of age, and almost none over that age, are begun on dialysis.'' But he says choices are unavoidable. A universal health system, Dr. Hiatt maintains, could reduce wasteful practices, such as unnecessary surgery and superfluous visits to specialists. His priorities for redirecting the resulting savings include improving community care for the poor, home care for the elderly, preventive medicine, research and medical scholarships.",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT,"CRUSADE: The Official History of the American Cancer Society. By Walter S. Ross. (Arbor, $18.95.) Within memory of many Americans the word ''cancer'' was once almost taboo. In obituaries the deceased ''died of a long illness.'' Everyone knew that meant cancer, but it was not polite to say so. The American Cancer Society has been a major force in erasing that taboo, in bringing cancer forcefully to public attention, in convincing physicians that some cancers can be cured, others prevented, and that many lives can be saved by trying. In ''Crusade: The Official History of the American Cancer Society,'' Walter S. Ross asserts that the society has become the largest, most influential, most effective private voluntary health organization in history. Mr. Ross, formerly the director of special publications at the society and the author of several books, concentrates on its achievements, since its inception in 1913, in promoting early diagnosis, early treatment and major national efforts at preventing cancers. Its greatest accomplishment came in challenging the powerful American tobacco industry by finding proof that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and other health complications and persuading the Federal Government to act on the evidence. The book's subtitle should alert the reader to a strong partisan bias; there are few hints that the society's policies have ever been flawed. With that caveat, however, the book is well worth reading. It shows what great feats can be achieved by a band of volunteers mobilized by dynamic leaders.",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

Originally, Mr. Bernstein was to have given over his entire program to Ives, pairing the comparatively conventional Second with the monumental Fourth. Instead, Schubert's Ninth has been substituted for Ives's grandest and most intractable symphony. That is a shame, but for the moment Ives is saved from slipping further toward the semiobscurity that was his lot before a few dedicated Ivesians thrust his music into public attention some 30 years ago.",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

The increase, started by Citibank, was the first in nearly three years. The prime's importance has faded and is now mostly symbolic, and most analysts said the increase will not be fully felt at the consumer level for some time. The increase means that the supply of available credit is tightening as businesses expand, which could signal a stronger economy in months to come. * * *",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

The Soviet writer, best known in America for his novel ''The Master and Margarita,'' completed in 1934, six years before his death, what the play's accomplished translator, Mirra Ginsburg, calls a ''pessimistic comedy.'' Like much of Bulgakov's work, it was not heard of again until the 1960's, when he enjoyed a measure of rehabilitation by the Kremlin. Since this production is a premiere, comparisons are not possible, but with all due gratitude, one comes away feeling there is more to the work than can be found at the Ohio Theater.",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Prepayment Penalties,"Question: I own shares in a co-op in New Jersey. When the building was converted in 1981 the sponsor took back a $2.5 million mortgage for 10 years at 11 percent interest, which he subsequently sold to Dollar Dry Dock Savings Bank of New York. The mortgage calls for a prepayment penalty of 5 percent up to the fourth year and subsequent penalties which would decline by 0.5 percent annually. I understand that prepayment penalties are illegal in New Jersey. Are such penalties legal in New York? D. S., Montclair, N.J. Answer: The location of the property in question, not the location of the bank holding a mortgage, determines which state's banking laws apply. The New Jersey banking law that prohibits prepayment penalties covers individual mortgages taken on single-family homes or buildings with up to six units. According to Roger Wagner, of the New Jersey Department of Banking, this rule would not extend to mortgages taken by co-ops.",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

But what about less clearcut cases, where a woman charging rape had dated the accused, or where a man thought the victim's protestations were merely a matter of playing hard to get? Simple rape -where the accused is known to the victim and no actual force is used - is unfairly treated by the criminal justice system as a private dispute rather than a prosecutable offense, Susan Estrich argues in this well-researched call for reform. The early common-law approach, developed to protect men against false accusations by vindictive women, rested squarely on proof of the woman's resistance. As Ms. Estrich, a professor at Harvard University Law School and herself a victim of rape, points out, this leaves rape victims in the untenable position, unique in criminal law, of having to prove their innocence rather than have the state prove the rapist's guilt. Reform of rape laws, a key item on the feminist agenda, made few changes. The author would shift the legal focus to the intent of the accused rapist, asking not whether the woman was raped but whether the man raped her, an approach that negates the need to examine the victim's sexual history and gives less credence to how strongly she resisted. Ms. Estrich also makes a strong case for negligence liability, to punish men who honestly but unreasonably believed that a woman had consented to intercourse. Readers willing to follow an exhaustive study of the development of rape law, with 40 pages of footnotes, will be rewarded with a persuasive argument for legal change.",1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Question Box,"QUESTION: Has anybody ever played for all four major league teams in New York City - the Mets, the Yankees, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants? It's never happened, and the person who probably came closest was Sal Maglie, who pitched for the Giants, Dodgers and Yankees in New York before ending his career in 1958, four years before the Mets were born and the first year that the Dodgers and Giants were no longer home teams in New York. Others like Maglie who played for all three New York teams were Fred Merkle, first baseman, and the following pitchers: Waite Hoyt, Burleigh Grimes, Johnny Allen and Bobo Newsom. Only Casey Stengel ever suited up for the four New York teams - as a player with the Giants, as a manager with the Yankees and Mets, and as player and manager with the Dodgers. QUESTION: With 90 victories in 1984, 98 in 1985 and 108 last year, the Mets have achieved 90 victories for three years in a row. When's the last time a team did that? Only four years ago, if you exclude the 1981 season, when a strike curtailed the baseball season and no team won more than 66 games. Skipping 1981, the Baltimore Orioles ran off six straight seasons of 90 victories or more, from 1977-1983. (Even in the strike season, they won 59 of 105, a pace of 90 victories.) The last National League teams to reach 90 victories three or more seasons in a row were Philadelphia and Los Angeles in the period of 1976-78. The record for consecutive years with 90 or more victories belongs to the 12 straight from 1947-58, with a high of 103 in 1954, when they finished second to Cleveland. QUESTION: Suppose Rickey Henderson opens the Yankee season with a single, and on the first pitch to Don Mattingly, Henderson bolts for second base as Mattingly hits a chopper over the pitcher's mound. Both the shortstop and the second baseman hesitate because they are unsure who should cover the base, and that allows the ball to continue to bounce toward second without being fielded. If the ball strikes Henderson just as he reaches the base and then ricochets past the shortstop into short left-center field, will Henderson be allowed to take third base - and perhaps even score - or is the ball dead and the runner out for being hit by a batted ball? If Henderson was in contact with the ball and the base at the same time, there's no basis whatsoever for denying him whatever bases he can get on the play. Under a rule designed to protect a fielder from being interfered with on a play, a runner between bases who is struck by a batted ball will be called out automatically whether he deflects the ball accidentally or intentionally, and the ball will be deemed dead as the batter is awarded first base as well as a base hit. But a runner on a base who is struck in the same manner is not automatically out; he can only be called out if an umpire judges that he intentionally deflected the ball to hinder a fielding play, and in that case, the umpire would call the batter out as well. Since the deflection by Henderson was unintentional, then the ball would remain alive and play would continue. Had the ball bounced off Henderson to the shortstop instead of going into the outfield, then the shortstop could have thrown to first base in an attempt to retire Mattingly on a play in which the runner would have deserved as much of an assist as the fielder. QUESTION: How many Canadian-born players are in the major leagues, and have any ever played with the two Canadian teams? As the season opens, there are three players on major league rosters who were born in Canada, and only one is with a Canadian team: Rob Ducey, a rookie outfielder with his hometown Toronto Blue Jays. Ducey is the third native Canadian to play for the Blue Jays, following Dave McKay, an infielder with Toronto from 1977-79, and Paul Hodgson, an outfielder in 1980. The most recent Montreal Expo player from Canada was Doug Frobel, an outfielder from Ottawa who previously played for Pittsburgh and was traded by the Expos last season to the Mets' farm team in Tidewater, where he batted .249 with 11 home runs. Frobel had joined the pitchers Claude Raymond (1969-71), Larry Landreth (1976-77) and Bill Atkinson (1976-79) as the only Canadian Expos.",1987-04-06T05:00:00+0000

Page A1 A U.S.-Canada accord on acid rain will be considered by President Reagan, he said. This marks a significant concession by Mr. Reagan to Canadian demands that he take the acid rain problem more seriously. A1 Salvadoran guerrillas dominate a mountain zone in Chalatenango Department, showing new attention to working with peasants. It is one part of El Salvador where the American-backed Government is not winning the war. A1 South Korea's economic growth has had profound effects on the way people live. Along with prosperity, Koreans now face a worrisome gulf between the haves and the have-nots and the resulting political tensions. A1 A secret U.S.-Japan agreement permitting the United States to take nuclear arms into Japan is explicitly referred to in a document uncovered by Japanese Communist Party members who searched in the Library of Congress. A3 The Pope arrived in Argentina, where he offered a kindly lecture on political responsibilities to the country's leaders. Politics is not expected to occupy as much of his agenda in Argentina as in Chile. A3 Israel's President, in West Germany, began the first visit to that country by an Israeli head of state. Chaim Herzog visited the memorial at the site of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. A12 In Beirut, relief supplies arrived in the Palestinian district of Shatila. It was the first big shipment allowed since the siege of the area by Shiite Moslem militiamen began five months ago. A14 NATIONAL A22-33, D30 Texaco suffered a court setback when the Supreme Court ruled that it should not have been excused by a lower court from posting a bond of more than $10 billion while it appealed a damage award that the Pennzoil Company won against it. A1 Jack Kemp will run for President, he announced. The New York Republican Congressman promised to support a weapons shield in space, ''freedom fighters'' abroad, free enterprise and traditional family values. A22 Children should be taught about sex and AIDS in school and at church, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said. He recommended that sex education begin in kindergarten. A23 Wheat farmers have been hard hit this year, particularly in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri by rains that followed other hardships. As a result many will be unable to plant the crops that qualify them for Federal aid. A22 Chicago's mayoral race has changed since a major challenger to Mayor Harold Washington withdrew on Sunday. ''We've got a horse race now,'' said an alderman who opposes the mayor's re-election. A22 Anti-C.I.A. protesters went on trial on charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst last November. They plan to use the proceedings to draw attention to the agency's actions. A26 Many teen-agers are being exploited by door-to-door sales organizations that hold them in virtual servitude, physically abuse them and cheat them of commissions, a Senate subcommittee was told. A25 A new Bureau of Prisons Director has been named, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d announced. J. Michael Quinlan, 45 years old, has been with the Bureau of Prisons for 16 years, most recently as deputy director. A31 CBS gave its ousted chairman, Thomas H.

Thomas E. Dewey Thruway when it suddenly collapsed on Sunday. A1 The collapsed bridge's design is common for bridges spanning small bodies of water, according to structural engineers. The steel plate girder design can be found in dozens of other bridges on the Thruway. B5 The bridge detour meant more traffic than usual on the narrow, normally quiet roads of Fort Hunter, N.Y. ''Every car that goes from Buffalo to New York is driving by my house right now,'' one resident said. B4 Two jail officers were dismissed and nine others - including an Assistant Deputy Warden and a Captain -were transferred as a result of a fight at a Brooklyn jail on March 24. B1 A Queens lawyer was sentenced to five years in Federal prison, given five more years on probation and ordered to pay nearly $413,500 in fines and restitution for placing two secretaries in ''no-show'' Assembly jobs.

us,Q&A,"Q. Is it possible to make fuel from old tires, and if so how? A. Several recycling companies have developed procedures for turning scrap tires into high-energy fuel for use in generating electricity. For example, Waste Recovery Inc. of Dallas shreads worn out tires into small pieces about two inches square. The steel wire mesh that remains on the surface of the tire chips is then removed by magnets. The resulting fuel chips, which have traces of whitewall and tread and resemble piles of coal, are used mainly as an additive in other types of fuel. An old tire contains the energy equivalent of 2.5 gallons of oil. Fuel derived from tires has a higher energy value and lower sulfur content than many forms of coal when mixed with other forms of fuel in a boiler or cement kiln. The fuel is burned mainly in the pulp and paper industry to produce steam for electricity or processing. To avoid polluting the environment, plants that burn tire-derived fuel must carefully regulate the amount of this fuel use. Turning tires into energy reduces the need for landfills and eliminates the environmental hazards of stockpiled tires. The Oxford Energy Company is building a waste tire incineration in Westley, Calif., that will burn whole discarded tires to generate steam to drive a turbine and electrical generator. Q. How are magnets manufactured? A. Magnets can occur naturally, such as in the case of lodestone, a strongly magnetic variety of the mineral magnetite. Or magnets can be produced by placing a material such as carbon steel or other alloys in a coil and applying an electric current to the coil. This magnetizes the material. Bar magnets and horseshoe magnets, which are made of steel, retain their magnetism for a long period. Their magnetism is reduced, however, when they are heated or banged.",1987-04-07T05:00:00+0000

The Dallas management was fined $5,000. Rod Thorn, the N.B.A.'s vice president for operations, said an investigation into Motta's charges had found no basis for concluding that Fitch had done anything wrong. Fitch has called Motta's comments ''irresponsible.'' Motta said last week that it seemed the Rockets wanted to get out of the same playoff bracket with the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference. If the Rockets were to finish fourth or fifth, they would meet the Lakers as early as the second round; if they finish sixth or seventh, however, they would not have to face the Lakers until the Western Conference championship series. The Lakers have already clinched first place and the home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. Motta made the observation after watching a game between the Rockets and the Phoenix Suns. Houston got within 2 points in the fourth quarter but had its best players on the bench. ''Houston looks like they're messing around,'' Motta said. ''They look like they're manipulating.'' Motta first complained to Thorn and then made his views known in an interview published by The Dallas Morning News. The league said the suspension would be served tonight for a game against Utah. ''I thought there was an injustice in the situation, I addressed it, and then I let it die,'' Motta said after the suspension was announced. ''I'll abide by the commissioner's decision on any punishment that he decided to delve out on me.''",1987-04-08T05:00:00+0000

Mann's description of the characters who inhabit ''Parsifal'' as ''an assemblage of extreme and repellent oddities'' is, if anything, an understatement. The magician Klingsor, who emasculates himself in a vain effort to gain entry into an order of celibate knights, is only the most obviously crazed member of a crew whose sick misadventures we are expected to take with the deepest seriousness. And yet, ''Parsifal'' somehow emerges from this spiritual and psychological miasma not as gruesome nonsense but, thanks largely to its transfixing music, as a mythic drama with characters whose counterparts may be recognized all around us today in both the religious and secular worlds.",1987-04-08T05:00:00+0000

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: WEDNESDAY, APRIL 8, 1987","INTERNATIONAL The Fed's chairman, Paul A. Volcker, warned of recession and other ''substantial risks'' to the economy if the U.S. relied on a further fall in the dollar to trim its record trade deficit. Instead, he said, the U.S. should cut its budget deficit. Mr. Volcker's remarks were seen by some analysts as an attempt to focus attention on American shortcomings and thus to minimize the chances of a trade war. [ Page A1. ] The dollar's decline is a central issue as the U.S. and its major trading partners open talks in Washington. Amid pessimism about the outcome of those talks, the bond market plummeted and the stock market followed. [ D1. ] Japan will spend $34 billion to stimulate its economy, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party said. The program, if enacted, would accelerate public works and provide larger outlays for housing and thus represents an about-face from the austerity programs of Prime Minister Nakasone. The U.S. has hoped that economic growth would lead the Japanese to buy more U.S. goods. [ D1. ] COMPANIES A group of investors withdrew its uninvited offer for Gencorp after the company made a higher offer for 54 percent of its stock. The bidders - the partnership of Wagner & Brown and AFG Industries - may make $75 million before expenses. [ D1. ] Filofax, the maker of looseleaf address-book-and-diaries that most emphatically do not fit in one's pocket, went public in London, offering four million shares at about $1.93 each. The company sees considerable opportunity for expansion overseas. [ D1. ] Texaco won some temporary relief from a Texas appeals court, which issued an order preventing Pennzoil from seizing any Texaco assets until after a hearing in Houston on Monday. The ruling permits Texaco to continue ordinary business activities, but restricts it from any major sales or transfers of assets, as its appeal of a judgment won by Pennzoil continues. [ D5. ] Avon said it would buy Giorgio, the Beverly Hills perfumery that turned a single fragrance into a $100 million-a-year business. The price is $185 million. [ D5. ] International Aero Engines delayed introduction of the engine that Airbus had wanted for its A340 airliner. [ D5. ] MARKETS The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 44.60 points, to 2,360.94, driven by a sharp decline in the bond markets and renewed fears about a lower dollar. Analysts said that profit taking by institutions also contributed to the slide. [ D1. ] Bond prices declined sharply. Many traders were betting that this week's meetings of financial leaders from industrial countries would not halt the slide of the dollar. [ D19. ] The dollar traded in a narrow range in the U.S. after falling in Tokyo to a new 40-year low against the yen. Gold prices rose. [ D20. ] Silver futures closed at a two-year high, brushing off late selling in Europe. Gold futures, soybeans and oil advanced. [ D20. ] THE ECONOMY Americans borrowed $1.77 billion more in consumer credit than they paid off in February, an increase far below the gains of last year, the Government reported today. [ D5. ] TECHNOLOGY Researchers are eager to test their acid-rain remedies, drawing on the $2.5 billion that President Reagan has pledged for development of commercial technologies.

But it will be several years before the new signals can be received at home.

us,Q&A,"Q. A roof leak caused a 12-inch corner of our bathroom wall and the wallpaper to swell and bubble out. The leak has been repaired but the wallpaper remains puffed out. Can we repair it? A. Usually even after the wall has dried, the gypsum board (if it is drywall) or the plaster has to be replaced, so the ''bubble'' might be part of the wall. However, if the wall is flat, you should be able to paste the paper back down. Slice the middle of the bubble with a razor, then wet the paper to make it soft. Work some wallpaper adhesive or thinned-down white glue behind the paper on each side of the slit and press the paper flat against the wall with a damp sponge. Sponge off all paste that oozes from the slit; rinse the sponge thoroughly and wipe off again. Q. I would like to redo the Formica counter tops in my kitchen. Can I paint or re-cover them? What do I do about the silver trim between the back edge of the counter and the vertical backsplash? A. You can paint the counter top surfaces with a good enamel, but this usually doesn't last long and has to be redone fairly frequently. You can install new plastic laminate over the old surfaces, but you must first remove the sink and all metal trim at the corners and the edges. Sand the old plastic lightly, then clean thoroughly. Put the new plastic on with contact cement; replace the sink and the moldings at the edges and along the bottom of the backsplash. Q. For years I have had a problem with my toilet. There is a good swirling action but the bowl is very slow to empty. I have adjusted the ball in the tank so there is plenty of water in the bowl before it is flushed. I have also cleaned the small openings under the rim. A pipe goes to the roof for venting; might this need cleaning? Any other suggestions? A. The vent line might be clogged or partly blocked, interfering with proper flushing; it should be checked. If it is clear, and if you are sure the tank fills to its maximum, there is probably a partial blockage in the toilet or in the waste line. Usually, blockages can be cleared with a ''snake'' or a power auger. Or you can use one of the drain-cleaning tools that employ water pressure. If that doesn't work, the bowl might have to be taken up to check the waste line and to clear completely the trap built into the bowl.",1987-04-09T05:00:00+0000

Now, four musicians from Senegal's third major tribal group, the Fulani, are making their first appearances in the United States, playing music that can be traced to the 11th century. The Fulani, originally a nomadic tribe that has now settled throughout West Africa, have their own troubadour tradition, with histories and praise songs and dance tunes for the royal court and for social occasions. Musicians are known as bambaados, and they play the xoddu (five-stringed fretless guitar), the riti (one-stringed fiddle), drums, gourds and bamboo flutes, solo and in ensembles. The music revolves around short, tightly wound riffs in unexpected combinations; to an American ear, the music suggests both the Arab-influenced music of North Africa and, with its fiddle and raw-voiced singing, American country-blues. The dancing, of course, will have to be seen. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; tickets are $12 and $15. Information: 206-1050.",1987-04-10T05:00:00+0000

This is the kind of hot-blooded, fun-loving moment that Susan Seidelman, who also directed ''Desperately Seeking Susan'' and ''Smithereens,'' manages best. In fact, Ms. Seidelman plays with clothes, knickknacks, pop tunes and crazily single-minded characters better than almost any other film maker around.

us,"FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 1987","Markets The dollar plummeted to a new low against the yen just a day after the U.S. and its economic allies pledged to stabilize currency rates. The decline followed statements by Treasury Secretary Baker that were interpreted by traders as an endorsement of further declines. Early today in Tokyo, the dollar was trading as low as 142.90 yen, after falling to less than 144 yen in New York. [ Page A1. ] A quicker system for reacting to currency fluctuations was agreed upon at the Washington meeting of the Group of Seven, officials of the U.S. and its six trading partners suggested. They also hinted that they had narrowed the secret exchange-rate range for the yen and the dollar that they set in Paris six weeks ago. [ D2. ] Treasury yields rose above 8 percent for the first time in 13 months. Traders were dismayed that the meeting of finance officials in Washington did not produce more vigorous plans to prevent the dollar's decline. [ D1. ] The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 32.96 points, to 2,339.20, battered by the sharp increase in interest rates. [ D5. ] Concern about high gasoline inventories persisted, as prices of crude oil and petroleum products moved slightly lower. [ D1. ] INTERNATIONAL Treasury Secretary Baker implored commercial banks to sustain the third world by developing new alternatives for borrowing. His remarks reflected growing concern that banks were shying away from loans to the developing world and thus endangering economic growth there.$ [ D1. ] COMPANIES Bic is being sued by people who say their lighters exploded, causing burns, and in some cases, death. Bic settled one case last fall for $3.25 million, but hundreds of suits are pending. Bic has refused to discuss the claims against it.

Democrats joined to pass the plan, which was approved 230 to 192, with no Republican support.

The remarkably inexpensive menu carries seven rustic pastas, a half-dozen meat and poultry entrees and a smattering of appetizers and desserts. The limited wine list is budget priced, too. The cooking can be a little heavy handed at times, as in the cappellini in a colorful sauce combining sun-dried tomatoes, capers, artichokes, garlic, pine nuts and olives - a surfeit of olives threw it off balance ($10.95). Soothing penne in a tomato and shallot sauce spiked with vodka was better ($8.95). A cursory sampling of the menu was enough to reveal, however, that the staff is earnest and eager to please. Add to this the delightfully relaxing ambiance and you have a special little corner worth noting when you are in the neighborhood. C. J.

Wilson refused. He was convinced that any British official could only want to meet him in order to rope him into the British propaganda machine. He was acutely isolationist: his Anglophobia, which in any case had been fairly acute, was increased by the reflection that England had once again managed to drag America into a dreadful and totally unnecessary war, and he had no wish to meet any representative of that country. However, once the war was over he evidently decided that he was no longer in any danger of being inveigled into pro-British activities, and asked me to lunch at the Princeton Club in New York.",1987-04-12T05:00:00+0000

I had been in Washington during the war years, and my friend the Russian composer Nicolas Nabokov, who, like his cousin Vladimir, was a friend of Wilson's, thought that he might like to meet me (I had expressed my intense admiration for ''Axel's Castle'' and ''The Triple Thinkers'') and talk about Russian literature and other topics. Wilson refused. He was convinced that any British official could only want to meet him in order to rope him into the British propaganda machine. He was acutely isolationist: his Anglophobia, which in any case had been fairly acute, was increased by the reflection that England had once again managed to drag America into a dreadful and totally unnecessary war, and he had no wish to meet any representative of that country. However, once the war was over he evidently decided that he was no longer in any danger of being inveigled into pro-British activities, and asked me to lunch at the Princeton Club in New York.",1987-04-12T05:00:00+0000

But unlike ''hard'' luxuries, such as silver, fine cabinetry or antiques, they are commodities of the immaterial sort, and where they are lacking, they can be nurtured through design. The noisy apartment can be quieted; the dark one, brightened; the small one, made to appear larger, and the one with no view, given scenery of its own. SILENCE",1987-04-12T05:00:00+0000

And only Prince would conclude, after verses filled with deadpan alarmism, ''Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby.'' On his double album, ''Sign o' the Times'' (Paisley Park/Warner Bros. 25577, LP, cassette and CD), the one-man studio band from Minneapolis dispenses ambitious music, commercial know-how, calculated eccentricities and wacky obsessions, all thoroughly entangled. By now, his audience expects no less. In some ways, Prince has retrenched for ''Sign o' the Times.'' It's harder-edged, less orchestral and more danceable than his last two albums, ''Around the World in a Day'' and ''Parade.'' After his movie-video-record blockbuster, ''Purple Rain,'' whose soundtrack sold more than 10 million copies, those albums (and the film ''Under the Cherry Moon'') did comparatively poorly. But on ''Parade,'' especially, Prince was testing new musical territory - and now, moving like an inchworm, he's letting his tail catch up with his head.

us,IMPORTANT POINTS FOR SPRING PLANTERS,"PLANTING is the first thing to consider now. Soil has dried out from the deluge earlier this week and there will be a rush until the end of May to get things into the ground. First to be set out are container-grown plants, particularly those with woody stems and perennials; these plants will need special attention. Gallon containers hold about three quarts of soil and roots wind around and around this confined area as they grow. Before plants are set in the ground, this root mass must be released - loosened and cut through with a knife. Though this may seem drastic, this deed accomplishes two things: new root growth and better water uptake. The plants initiate new roots as soon as they are set in the ground and these succulent roots are able to absorb water more efficiently. Those who plant container-grown plants must water these new plants often, every three to four days, to be sure the initial start is secure, especially with dry summer months ahead. When woody plants or perennials are shipped, damp sphagnum is used to wrap roots. These plants also need careful planting in a wide deep hole, which has been improved with a good soil mix. Fan the root mass out, firm gently, be sure plants are set at the proper height in the ground and water them in. Seedlings should be kept indoors until the soil is warmer and the weather more settled. QUESTIONS/ANSWERS NEW BASIL",1987-04-12T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCES. By Jonathan Miller. (Elisabeth Sifton/Viking, $25.) In this valuable contribution to a longstanding debate, Jonathan Miller marshals his two decades of theatrical experience and his considerable knowledge of art and science to make the case for messing around with the classics. As the director who peopled ''Rigoletto'' with New York mobsters and ''The Merchant of Venice'' with 19th-century bankers, Mr. Miller is not a disinterested observer. But his book is far more than an apologia for his own innovative productions. It is also a practical look at the problems of staging the texts of authors who are no longer around to explain what they meant, and a philosophical inquiry into whether art can ever really be ''timeless.'' Mr. Miller's main point is that plays and operas are written for audiences who share the writer's understanding of the world, and that, as time goes by, this shared understanding disappears, never to be regained - even through meticulous historical research. Thus the most traditional, most reverent presentation of a classic play cannot help being, in fact, a revisionist reading. His arguments are buttressed with illustrations ranging from Renaissance paintings to visual paradoxes, all helping to show that what you see isn't necessarily what there is. Mr. Miller's radicalism stops short, however, when it comes to mixing media. He eloquently explains how ''most novels are irreversibly damaged by being dramatized'' and why ''televising Shakespeare or opera is . . . an exercise in media cross-dressing.''",1987-04-12T05:00:00+0000

A1 Eduard Shevardnadze has sharpened his diplomatic skills since Secretary of State George P. Shultz last visited Moscow, officials said. The Soviet Foreign Minister was then unfamiliar with Soviet-American issues. A8 News analysis: Arms proposals that President Reagan decided to back away from had a mixed reception in Moscow. Reversing position on his own previous offers has minuses and pluses for the Soviet Union. A8 Chad's victory over Libya showed that the weapons and tactics used by industrial nations are not necessarily appropriate for inexperienced and poorly trained troops of less developed countries. A1 South Korean constitutional changes will no longer be debated until after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, President Chun Doo Hwan ordered. His decision will likely sharpen the country's political tensions. A1 The flight of Salvadorans to the U.S. by the hundreds of thousands each year has made the migration to the north one of theirmost determined of its kind in recent history. A1 The immigrant's world: low pay and overcrowded housing A6 In South Africa, a new protest law forbidding demonstrations on behalf of political detainees may be defied by church leaders. They were proceeding with plans for a prayer service, possibly the decree's first test. A7 India's Defense Minister resigned under pressure from politicians unhappy with his investigation of kickbacks in the awarding of a defense contract. The move was a blow to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. A3 In Cambodia, appeals for the trust of the Khmer people have been made by both sides in the country's unending war. Support may be flagging and desertions rising in both camps, radio broadcasts suggest. A10 Israeli settlers attack Arabs in West Bank A3 Senegal's isle of slaves A4 Chile after the Pope's visit A6 Governor election a setback for Nakasone A9 Campaign seeks genocide trial of Khmer Rouge A11 Soviet astronauts solve a docking problem A13 NATIONAL A14-16, A20, B9 Texaco filed for protection from its creditors in Federal Bankruptcy Court as a result of its bitter legal dispute with the Pennzoil Company. Texaco is the largest company ever to enter bankruptcy proceedings. A1 Requiring employee benefits from employers is becoming an attractive idea to members of Congress who are unwilling to raise taxes for social programs. The idea draws support from liberals and conservatives. A14 The speed limit is routinely violated and seldom enforced along the open roads of the West. In areas where such regulations seem irrelevant, few people expect changes if the speed limit is increased as allowed by the Federal highway law. A14 Some believe the Devil is a force that tempts humans, a New York Times-CBS News Poll found. Some followers of the Rev. Jim Bakker said the Devil is responsible for trouble in the nation's television ministry. B9 A report of drug use by Julian Bond, the former state senator, and a public retraction of the allegation have become the focus of broad controversy. Mr. Bond's former wife had told the police he abused cocaine. A20 Job security for auto workers will be the top goal when the United Automobile Workers open contract negotiations with the nation's two largest au-tomobile companies this summer, the union's president said. A16 Derailment drama ends in Pittsburgh A14 Navy cites a shortage of sailors A14 L.A. council election is seen as a test for mayor A15 Crimes in U.S. decreased slightly in 1986 B9 WASHINGTON TALK B8 White House's new communications chief Enlisting youth in public service REGIONAL B1-5, B7 Arresting small-time drug dealers is the focus of recent police operations that have sparked debate on whether attacking neighborhood drug marketplaces is the best way to fight illegal narcotics. A1 Stop-smoking programs thrive as smokers from across the city flock to them in anticipation of May 7, when smoking will be prohibited in public indoor areas in the state and restricted in many other places. A1 A chemical smell caused a walkout of workers seven weeks ago from Uretek Inc. in New Haven. But company officals say the smell, similar to that of turpentine or cleaning fluid, is harmless. B1 A school principal was censured in Brooklyn for borrowing $6,000 from a teacher and insisting that it be considered a political contribution. A disciplinary panel called the action ''highly inappropriate.'' B4 A bill that tightens ethics rules for state legislators is ''a step backward'' and should be vetoed by Governor Cuomo, leaders of the state's Bar Association said. The Legislature passed the bill last week. B2 A detention center for illegal aliens with criminal backgrounds will be renovated and the system for holding them will be revised. The center in Manhattan has been criticized in Federal studies. B3 A hospital defended its care of Andy Warhol.

us,Key Events in the Pennzoil-Texaco Dispute,"Jan. 3, 1984: Pennzoil board endorses a Memorandum of Agreement to buy 43 percent of Getty Oil, including one billion barrels of crude oil reserves, for $5.3 billion. Jan. 4: News release about merger is issued by Getty and Pennzoil. Texaco's president, Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., asks a Getty investment banker if the formal papers have been signed. He is told they have not been signed but that lawyers are working on them. Jan. 5: Texaco's board plans a $10.1 billion offer for Getty. Jan. 6-9: Getty's board votes to accept the Texaco offer, and Getty issues a news release. Pennzoil learns of Texaco deal and sends telex to Getty demanding it abide by its pact with Pennzoil. Jan. 10: Pennzoil files suit in Delaware to block the merger. Feb. 7: Chancery Judge Grover C. Brown rejects Pennzoil's plea for an injunction, but notes that Pennzoil might be able to establish in a trial that a contract had existed between Pennzoil and Getty. Feb. 8: Pennzoil files a new suit against Texaco in Houston, seeking damages for interfering in its deal. July 9, 1985: Jury trial begins, with New York laws to apply. Nov. 19: Texas jury rules for Pennzoil with the largest damage award in history: $10.53 billion, plus interest. Of that, $7.53 billion represents the amount Pennzoil suffered by not acquiring Getty and $3 billion is awarded as punishment. With interest, the total is about $12 billion. Texaco's net worth is $13.5 billion. Dec. 10: Texas State Judge Solomon Casseb enters judgment, affirming the jury's award. To stay the order while the case is appealed, Texaco, under Texas law, would have to post a bond of more than $12 billion. Texaco says that could force it into bankruptcy. Dec. 17: Texaco seeks an injunction in Federal court in New York to block Pennzoil action. Texaco says the judgment violated Federal law because it prevented Texaco from pursuing appeals. The court issues a temporary restraining order. Jan. 5-6, 1986: Texaco and Pennzoil hold settlement talks. Jan. 10: Federal Judge Charles Brieant in New York rules for Texaco on bond question, says Texaco could post $1 billion bond instead of $12 billion and also raises questions about fairness of the Texas trial. Feb. 20: The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York partly upholds Judge Brieant's ruling. It finds the bond would violate Texaco's right to due process but rebukes Judge Brieant for raising fairness questions. In Houston, Judge Casseb denies Texaco's motion for a new trial in damage award case. March 25: Top officers of Pennzoil and Texaco agree to resume talks. April 24: Texaco appeals the damage award to the Texas Court of Appeals. Pennzoil reacts coolly to Texaco settlement proposal. June 23: United States Supreme Court agrees to hear Pennzoil's appeal of the Federal court's bond decision. July 31: Companies argue before Texas First Court of Appeals. Jan. 12, 1987: U.S. Supreme Court hears bond arguments. Feb. 12: Texas Court of Appeals upholds award for Pennzoil, but trims judgment to $9.1 billion, including interest. March 30: Texaco asks Texas appeals court to reverse decision. April 6: U.S. Supreme Court rules against Texaco in bond case and invalidates New York Federal appeals court decision lowering Texaco bond to $1 billion. April 10: Texaco files legal documents in Texas saying that it could not afford to pay a bond of more than $1 billion. Pennzoil, in a separate filing, says it wants ''full security.'' April 12: Texaco, after failing to reach a settlement with Pennzoil, files for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy laws. Texaco, meanwhile, makes a final settlement offer to Pennzoil's chairman, J. Hugh Kiedke.",1987-04-13T05:00:00+0000

''I'm very happy this day came,'' Clemens said at a news conference. ''I don't have any hard feelings.'' The Red Sox refused to disclose details, but the pact was reported to be for about $2 million. Lou Gorman, Red Sox general manager, said it included incentive clauses. Clemens, 24 years old, led the major leagues with a 24-4 record in 1986 as the Red Sox won the pennant. In his 1987 debut against Toronto Saturday, he lasted only four innings, giving up four runs. He left the game with Boston trailing, 4-1, and the Blue Jays won, 11-1. Clemens earned $220,000 plus $120,000 in bonus incentive money in his second full season with the Red Sox in 1986. He had asked for $2.4 million for two years.

With ''Black Maria,'' Mr. Jesurun has moved a step beyond ''Deep Sleep'' and ''White Water,'' the previous plays in his theater-movies-television cycle. This time, the audience is surrounded by movie screens, four of them as walls and one as ceiling. There are no live actors; the ''play'' is entirely on film.",1987-04-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 1987","COMPANIES Texaco's stock price fell in very heavy trading as the large oil company moved to reassure the business community in the wake of its bankruptcy filing. Texaco stock was the day's most-active issue, dropping $3.375, to $28.50, on volume of 12.6 million shares, and Texaco bonds fell in lighter trading. Meanwhile, the shares of its rival, Pennzoil, plunged $15.25, to $77, amid uncertainty about how much the company might eventually collect from its high-stakes legal battle with Texaco. [ Page D1. ] Pennzoil's rejection of a $2 billion settlement with Texaco was probably a historic gamble, and many analysts feel it has lost an important bargaining chip. [ D1. ] Pennzoil is unlikely to succeed if it tries to challenge Texaco's bankruptcy filing, lawyers and bankruptcy experts said. [ D5. ] I.B.M. reported a surprising rise in first-quarter revenues, though net income dropped 23 percent, to $785 million. The results were far better than most analysts had predicted, and I.B.M. stock surged $2.625, to $147.625, amid hopes that a flood of new products later this year will pull I.B.M. out of a two-year slump. [ D1. ] The head of the troubled Mellon Bank resigned. There were indications that J. David Barnes, chairman and chief executive, had been forced out, and analysts speculated that the move was largely at the urging of the Mellon family. [ D1. ] Merrill Lynch's earnings increased 25 percent, and revenues grew similarly. Merrill, the first brokerage house to report results of a buoyant first quarter, was hurt by rising costs but helped by the new tax law. [ D23. ] Chemical and Irving Trust reported lower earnings, citing the change in the status of their Brazilian loans. While Wells Fargo also put its Brazilian loans on a cash basis, it reported higher earnings, helped by its Crocker acquisition. [ D22. ] Wedtech sued two big accounting firms, charging that they had failed to disclose ''pervasive fraud'' by Wedtech's former management. The suits seek $70 million in damages from KMG Main Hurdman and $35 million from Touche Ross. [ B1. ] GAF requested additional data from Borg-Warner, whose stock price rose above the offer, totaling $4.23 billion, from Merrill Lynch Capital Partners. [ D8. ] A $242 million loss at U S Sprint hurt earnings at its two parent companies, GTE and United Telecommunications. [ D23. ] Two possible bidders for Dome Petroleum have emerged. Analysts believe Royal Dutch/Shell Group and British Petroleum are interested in the assets of Canada's troubled oil giant. [ D10. ] Dillard agreed to buy 31 stores in Texas, Arizona and Tennessee from Allied Stores for $255 million. [ D5. ] MARKETS The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 51.71 points as a wave of selling battered a stock market already reeling from a weaker dollar, fears of inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates. Reflecting the market's recent volatility, the Dow lost 2.2 percent of its value, falling to 2,287.07, for its fourth-largest point drop ever and the biggest since it fell 57.39 points on March 30. [ D1. ] Prices of notes and bonds dropped sharply, hurt by heavy selling of mortgage-backed securities and fears that the Fed was tacitly encouraging higher short-term rates by failing to counteract higher overnight rates. [ D23. ] The dollar dropped again against most major currencies as traders awaited a report due today on the U.S. trade deficit. In New York, gold rose $4.25, to $436.75. [ D24. ] Energy futures advanced amid late buying by traders who had sold short. Oil was under pressure because of reports that OPEC members were exceeding their production quotas. [ D24. ] THE ECONOMY Tariffs against some Japan electronic products will almost certainly go into effect on Friday, according to senior White House officials. They predicted that the action would lead to a ''difficult'' trade situation with Japan. [ D7. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS Blue Cross/Blue Shield is feuding with local hospitals in several areas. As both sides expand beyond their historic roles, cooperation is giving way to competition. Business and Health. [ D2. ] Canada's stock market has surged after a dormant 1986, with gains outpacing those on American equities exchanges. Experts attributed the gains to a stronger Canadian dollar and to demand for precious metals and forest products. Market Place. [ D12. ]",1987-04-14T05:00:00+0000

Although plenty of new architecture has come to this old part of London in recent years, no building has arrived with the hoopla that has surrounded the new headquarters for Lloyd's of London, the insurance marketplace. The 12-story Lloyd's building on the corner of Leadenhall and Lime Streets designed by Richard Rogers, who with Renzo Piano designed the Beaubourg Center in Paris, would seem at first glance as unsuitable to the City as any work of architecture could be. Where most of the buildings in the City are of masonry, Lloyd's is of glass and metal. Where most of the buildings are lavish in their use of traditional ornament and decoration, Lloyd's is a high-tech extravaganza, a sleek array of pipes and pods and frames and towers and tubes. Since the building began construction in 1981, it has been called everything from an Erector set to an oil rig.",1987-04-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q.Does beer have any nutritional value? A.Beer made from barley malts, rice or corn contains small amounts of protein, minerals and vitamins, according to Dr. Joseph Owades, director of the Center for Brewing Studies, a beer research concern in San Francisco. Barley malts provide beer with protein, minerals and vitamins, while corn and rice impart carbohydrates, Dr. Owades said. One 12-ounce bottle of beer contains one gram of protein, or 2 percent of the recommended daily allowance. It also contains between 1 and 2 percent of the recommended daily allowance of B vitamins, the same amount found in a slice of bread. In addition, beer contains trace amounts of calcium, magnesium, phosphate and potassium. Dr. Owades noted, however, that alcoholic beverages should not serve as substitutes for foods in the four basic food groups. Q. How can scientists distinguish between air pollution that is man-made and that which occurs naturally? A.Scientists use radiocarbon dating techniques to determine whether airborne contaminants, which cause such environmental pollution as urban smog, come from naturally occurring sources, such as vegetative emissions, or from fossil fuel emissions that are produced by cars, power plants and factories. The technique is similar to that used by archeologists to determine the age of artifacts. Scientists collect particle samples on glass fiber filters and combust these particles to measure the amount of carbon 14 they contain. They can distinguish between naturally occurring contaminants and those produced by humans because fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum contain no living carbon 14.",1987-04-14T05:00:00+0000

A.It sounds as if there may be a problem with the plaster. If bare plaster is powdery, something is wrong with it and it won't hold paint for long. You can try taking all the paint off those walls, using a nonflammable semipaste remover; wash with detergent and let dry completely. Apply an alkyd-base primer-sealer and let dry several days.

us,On Fixing Constitution And Spilling Gravy All Over the Preamble,"Warren E. Burger retired last year as Chief Justice of the United States to devote full time to his chairmanship of the commission that is leading the celebration of the bicentennial of the Constitution. He still retains chambers at the Supreme Court, and the other day he paused while working there to discuss the accomplishments and frustrations of the bicentennial effort thus far and to look back on some of his years on the Court. Q: Do you miss not being on the Court? A: I don't believe in the carry-off theory, that you stay there until you're carried off. Q:fe,r10: But you were Chief Justice a long time. A: Yes, for 17 1/2 years, which is longer than anybody in the 20th century had served. It might be different if I had simply moved into this grand office here and had nothing to do, but I'm busier than I have ever been in my life. Q: No regrets? A: No regrets whatever. There is a need to fill the gap that's resulted from our - I mean all of us - having taken this Constitution for granted. That includes lawyers as well as nonlawyers. I was in very, very active practice in the private sector for 21 years and I had just one constitutional case in all that time when I represented a young Negro who was head of the Young Communist League and I was volunteer counsel. He was in court because he was arrested and improperly persuaded to enter a guilty plea to a charge of indecent exposure, and he had ineffective assistance of counsel. This was an offense for which normally you would get a slap on the wrist and a $50 fine and a 10-day suspended sentence, and as I recall this, he got 364 days. A group of us from the big law firms formed a little committee and included the legal counsel of the electrical workers union. That was a divided group. And we got it reversed in the Supreme Court. Now the ordinary affairs of life don't bring constitutional questions, so we've all taken it for granted too much. Now we are going to try to break through that. Q: Speaking of a Constitution that is now 200 years old. Some people would like to amend it. But you have said that a new constitutional convention to consider new amendments would not be a very good idea. Why? A: It would be a grand waste of time. If you have a tire go flat on your car, you don't throw the car away. If your carburetor isn't working, if it's too lean, you don't throw the car away. You fix it. Q: And this car is pretty good after 200 years? A: For 200 years this car has not been just pretty good. It is not perfect, as Franklin said, but the best thing of its kind that was ever put together. Here these extraordinary guys took and did the impossible, and it has worked. Q. Getting back to the celebration and the many events planned, what are the plans so far for a session of Congress and a session of the Supreme Court in Philadelphia? There seems to be some confusion about that. A. I don't think there is any session of Congress in Philadelphia. And there has been something amounting almost to misrepresentation about the Court's position.",1987-04-16T05:00:00+0000

''We often found that clients didn't want traditional floral-patterned bone china,'' Mr. Patino said. The designers like the idea of having mismatched dishes and flatware for an eclectic, rather than a homogeneous, look. For the sandblasted glass Candice candlestick holder, far left, they wanted a hard material to look soft and fluid, so they devised a draped effect. Nine inches high, the piece costs $125. Mr. Patino and Mr. Wolf live in an apartment whose windows are laid out in grids, and that gave them the idea of the Windows flatware, below, with open, not solid, handles. A five-piece place setting is $75 in plain stainless steel, $100 with a matte black finish. Looking at Vincent Palladini's collages of layers of different-sized grids, the designers developed their Gridlock Black dinner plate, the dark one at bottom left.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: THURSDAY, APRIL 16, 1987","THE ECONOMY The U.S. economy is showing signs of fragility, after performing better than expected in the first few months of 1987. The Goverment reported that industrial output in March fell 0.3 percent, its biggest drop in 10 months, and that retail sales rose a paltry 0.2 percent. Most private analysts are expressing increasing fears about a financial and political climate that they believe could eventually tip the world economy into recession. Their concerns include the dollar's decline, the American trade and budget deficits, trade disputes and inflation. [ Page D1. ] Secretary Baker said Japan had reached a ''watershed'' in its relations with Washington. In a speech to the Japan Society, he criticized Tokyo for maintaining policies that contributed to the dollar's decline. [ D1. ] Japan formally warned the U.S. that an imposition of American tariffs, expected tomorrow, would result in a Japanese protest to GATT. [ D8. ] The dollar rebounded slightly after a six-day drubbing, lifted by the same kind of comments from prominent officials that had contributed to its fall. In New York, gold dropped $8.50, to $442.50. [ D20. ] Western Europe's export-driven economies are being hurt by the dollar's drop. Auto, oil, chemical and machinery companies have been affected, and many top exporters warn that the worst is yet to come. [ A1. ] Some Japanese experts voiced deep concern that a continued decline of the dollar could harm both the Japanese and American economies. [ D14. ] A variety of American companies are finally reporting an upturn in exports, 19 months after the U.S. and several allies acted to lower the dollar's value. [ D14. ] A House panel cleared Representative St Germain of allegations that he used his influence to amass a personal fortune. The House ethics committee's 1,405-page report showed only minor transgressions of House rules by the Rhode Island Democrat. [ D5. ] A New York State law that curbs hostile takeovers initially cost shareholders at least $1.2 billion, a Federal study concludes. [ D15. ] MARKETS Stock prices recovered in brisk trading on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 29.97 points, to 2,282.95, after giving up 86 points in the preceding two sessions. A firmer credit market helped the stock market. [ D1. ] The Treasury bond market began to recover, encouraged by a modest rise in the dollar, weak economic data and the belief that bond prices had declined too far, too fast. [ D18. ] Yields on C.D.'s, bank money-market accounts and money-market mutual funds all rose for the recent week. [ D19. ] Energy futures advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange after an industry report showed lower inventories. [ D20. ] INTERNATIONAL The Philippines dealt a setback to the global debt situation. It is seeking to renegotiate its debt restructuring accord to obtain the same favorable interest rate won by Mexico and Argentina. [ D1. ] COMPANIES Earnings rose 25.7 percent at A.T.& T., thanks in part to cost cutting, but analysts said the company had yet to overcome many of the problems that have caused disappointing results since the 1984 divestiture. Nynex and Ameritech earnings were flat. [ D1. ] Digital Equipment rose 81 percent, while Apple climbed 6 percent. [ D4. ] CBS profits nearly tripled because of a strong performance at the company's record unit and reduced interest expense. But the broadcasting unit's performance remained lackluster. [ D1. ] Earnings rose at two banking companies, Continental Illinois and Security Pacific, while First City Bancorp of Texas posted another loss. [ D4. ] Coca-Cola's earnings rose 15 percent. [ D2. ] A new debate on foreign ownership of Canadian businesses may be a result of TransCanada's bid for Dome Petroleum. [ D15. ] A $8.4 million payment authorized by Guinness' ex-chairman to a company director during a takeover was ruled unlawful. [ D4. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS A Texaco-Pennzoil deal could come at almost any time, many legal experts say. According to lawyers close to the case, a quick settlement would allow Texaco to wrap up its bankruptcy status without much delay. Talking Deals.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, APRIL 17, 1987","THE ECONOMY The President's budget director warned the Fed not to raise interest rates, saying such action could cause a recession. The Reagan aide, James C. Miller 3d, seemed to be positioning the Administration to blame the Fed if a recession occurs in 1988, an election year. Paul A. Volcker has indicated that the Fed might have to consider pushing up rates to combat the dollar's slide. [ Page A1. ] The F.C.C. voted to raise the monthly telephone access fee to $3.50, from $2, for residential and small-business users. The commission said the increase would generally be offset by a further decline of at least 15 percent in rates for long-distance calls. [ D1. ] The F.C.C. adopted tighter curbs on the broadcast of explicit language about sex and body functions. [ A1. ] Housing construction fell 3.2 percent in March, the biggest decline in six months and the first since November. [ D1. ] Factories, mines and utilities operated at 79.2 percent of capacity last month, off 0.5 percent. [ D3. ] Business sales climbed a record 4.4 percent in February, while inventories rose a small 0.2 percent. [ D3. ] The U.S. will allow patents for animals, clearing the way for inventors to patent life forms created through gene splicing. [ A1. ] COMPANIES A. H. Robins filed a plan to satisfy creditor claims by allotting $1.75 billion for women who contend they were injured by using its Dalkon Shield birth control device. Lawyers for a class of the Dalkon Shield claimants said they would fight the plan, which was filed in bankruptcy court. [ D1. ] A swindle scheme involving fraudulent promissory notes for Indonesia with a face value of $3.5 billion was disclosed by investigators. The authorities said the scheme was run by a Middle Eastern businessman who has previously been linked to the P.L.O. [ D1. ] G.M. will scrap its executive bonus system in favor of a stock option plan, The bonus plan, in effect since 1918, has long been criticized by consumer activists and labor leaders. [ D1. ] Bic said it had 42 lawsuits outstanding that were brought on behalf of people burned or killed by fires allegedly caused by malfunctioning disposable butane lighters that it made. [ D3. ] Net income fell 21.4 percent at American Express, but last year's first quarter included a large one-time gain. [ D2. ] Two tobacco conglomerates, Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco, showed strong gains for the quarter.

Jason McManus was named as his successor. [ B5. ] Agents arrested 16 stockbrokers on charges of selling cocaine and trading it for stocks and information. [ A1. ] MARKETS The jittery stock, bond and currency markets calmed following a comment by Treasury Secretary Baker that ''a further decline of the dollar'' could be ''counterproductive.'' The dollar strengthened against the yen and the West German mark. Gold rose modestly in New York after falling $4 to $6 an ounce in Europe. [ D1. ] Stocks ended mixed in pre-holiday trading.

[ D4. ] Treasury issues continued to recover, with intermediate maturities showing some of the best gains of the day. [ D10. ] Grain and soybean futures prices rallied, lifted by expectations of wheat sales to the Soviet Union.

The Bulls' Michael Jordan scored 17 points and missed the last 18 minutes with an apparently minor thigh injury. Jordan, who scored a regular-season career-high 61 points Thursday night, was forced out because of a bruise suffered in the 117-114 loss Thursday night to Atlanta. He had scored at least 50 points in each of his previous three games before last night. Boston improved its record to 58-23, one game ahead of the Hawks. The teams play at Boston Garden in the season finale tomorrow, with the winner getting a homecourt advantage throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs. An Atlanta victory would give the Hawks the same record as Boston, but their 4-2 head-to-head edge would give them the homecourt edge. Chicago finished the regular season at 40-42.(AP) Horse Racing Lac Ouimet Wins: Lac Ouimet scored an easy five-length upset victory on wet footing yesterday in the $177,300 Excelsior Handicap at Aqueduct.

Now I don't know why it is that one fairly ordinary, fairly normal family, consisting of one academic (father), one writer (mother) and two teen-agers, one male and one female, both rather preppy-looking, should have struck so many immigration and customs officials, at so many borders, as worthy of their full attention, their exhaustive third-degree audit, their exclusive Unlimited Length Delay Program, their Special Reserve Grudging Admittance with implied reproach: All right, we'll let you in this time, but we don't trust you.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"To non-weavers, the term interlacing sounds a bit cryptic. The noted textile designer Jack Lenor Larsen and the writer Betty Freudenheim unravel it in INTERLACING: The Elemental Fabric (Kodansha International, $60), a richly illustrated volume that, in contrast to so many books on design, has a distinctly anthropological bent. Interlacing refers to the kind of fabric construction common to weaving, plaiting and braiding, in which each element passes over and under elements that cross its path. ''Almost as elemental as fire,'' write the authors, it is an extremely ancient technique that has spanned a panoply of objects and cultures. The book, which is an appreciation of interlacing as well as a description of it, covers everything from little girls braiding pigtails as a fledgling act of childhood adornment, to the hundreds of exquisite and practical variations - Czechoslovak bobbin lace, Guatemalan corn dollies, East African beer stirrers, wedding baskets from Burkina Faso and the legendary Panama hat. Though the book is at times a bit technical for a general audience, the photographs, in particular, many in color, are an accessible and enticing introduction to the subject, as is the excellent bibliography. Only Mr. Larsen's voluminous personal experiences, fleetingly alluded to in the text, are missing. What was the dean of New York textile designers doing in Vietnam, for example, designing interlaced sea-grass mats?",1987-04-19T05:00:00+0000

For those who gave up college mathematics for what seemed more liberal arts, Rudy Rucker's new book, ''Mind Tools,'' is a dazzling refresher course. As in past works, like ''The Fourth Dimension,'' he rekindles the wonder that can come from contemplating logarithms, exponential curves and transcendental numbers. Refreshed in the basics, readers get a tour of such fascinating, if faddish, worlds as fractals, Turing machines, cellular automata, Godel's theorem and catastrophe theory. This will be familiar fare to readers of Martin Gardner, Douglas Hofstadter, Morris Kline, Michael Guillen and other artful expositors. But Mr. Rucker, the author of a dozen books of science and science fiction, connects mathematics' five domains - number, space, logic, infinity and information - in unusual ways, and ''Mind Tools'' is an absorbing map of his complex mind. Sometimes he is annoying. When he meditates on mystical, universal meanings of one and zero he seems to be spinning dogma for his own Pythagorean cult. But his very open mind never takes itself too seriously, and in the end Mr. Rucker provides an interesting and rigorous argument for his belief that there will never be an explanation for the universe that is any less complex than the universe itself.",1987-04-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"NEWS SUMMARY: SUNDAY, APRIL 19, 1987","INTERNATIONAL 3-17 U.S. negotiators will 'intensify' their efforts in Geneva to resolve remaining differences with the Soviet Union on the possibility of reducing medium-range nuclear missiles, President Reagan said. Page 1 Military buildups in Central America have civilian leaders worried about long-term prospects as weak governments deal with increasingly strong armies in their countries. 1 The President knew of weaknesses in the American Embassy in Moscow that made it vulnerable to Soviet espionage, an official said. Three years ago, Mr. Reagan saw a slide show about the embassy's problems. 1 In Athens, a dispute about Greek and its proper form has been renewed. Some favor ancient Greek and some the 19th-century Greek called Katharevousa. ''The language has become impoverished,'' one professor said of modern Greek. 1 A Catholic abbey in the Netherlands run by the Rev. Arthur Baeten attracts outsiders visiting the ''rebellious'' abbot. He offers sanctuary to dissident Catholic priests and laymen at odds with the Vatican. 1 In Tokyo, few fear a trade war will result from the United States decision to impose tariffs on some Japanese products. Instead, the action has raised questions about whether a hard-line Japanese trade policy could backfire. 11 Argentina's leaders will negotiate with rebellious infantry officers who are demanding an amnesty for security forces accused of past human-rights abuses. The move is intended to end the crisis peacefully. 17 The Philippine Army ended a mutiny led by renegade soldiers apparently loyal to the former President, Ferdinand E. Marcos. The mutineers tried to free comrades who were being held after an earlier uprising. 12 Castro says harmony is up to U.S. 3 Vietnamese voting with a choice 4 Tougher line urged in Sri Lanka 6 Book looks at U.S.-Manila policy 12 Fanfani heads 46th Cabinet 14 NATIONAL 20-27, 38-39 Minority enrollment in colleges and universities appears to have stagnated. The latest Federal figures show that blacks have a smaller presence on American campuses than they did six years ago. 1 Frequent fliers on airlines are angry over recent decisions by many carriers to increase mileage levels needed to win free trips or better seats to popular destinations like Hawaii and Western Europe. 1 A tax-exempt group paid friends of two of the organization's leaders thousands of dollars. The friends of Carl R. Channell and Daniel L. Conrad, officers of the group, received money raised for conservative causes. 24 George Bush is biding his time while some of his potential rivals have declared their candidacies recently in much publicized events. But the Vice President has been appealing to supporters for funds. 27 Former foes back Chicago's Mayor, Harold Washington, as he consolidates his political power with the City Council. Mr. Washington's re-election is a large factor in attracting old opponents. ''I can count,'' one said. 22 Near Denver, toxic chemical fears unnerve a middle-class community. Parents believe the chemicals have caused sickness and death among their children. But Government officials say there is no evidence. 26 Volunteer firefighters are declining in number at departments across the country. They have become victims of Americans' peripatetic way of life and the social and economic pressures that have changed the fabric of Main Street. 20 Dispute over screening of aliens 20 Report Bakkers got $4.8 million since 1984 20 Silver lining for Golden Gate's 50th 21 Plan to restore authority 23 REGIONAL 28-36, 40-41 An escaped prisoner surrendered to a police officer who found him resting on a porch in Milford, Pa., 18 miles from the prison. The convicted hijacker was exhausted after 30 hours of trekking through a cold drizzle. 28 A court criticized a prosecutor from Brooklyn in a unanimous ruling. The decision found that repeated references to race could have prejudiced a jury against a black defendant and denied him a fair trial. 28 New York State's emission testing for cars remains one of the most ineffective in the nation and in some cases is hampered by fraud, according to Government documents and interviews with Federal and state officials. 30 Tunnel officers exposed to car fumes for 10 years were 88 percent more likely to die from heart disease than men in the general public, apparently due to the carbon monoxide, a Federal report says. 30 Touched by deaths in a tragic fire, young men at a Harlem apartment building repeatedly struck by tragedy in the last year make a special effort to help others, including the young children who live at the plaza. 32 Queens' murders rose 25.1 percent in 1986, the biggest percentage increase of any of New York City's five boroughs.

us,Brown-Bagging It,"THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND MAY rely on a retinue to carry her impedimenta, but the rest of the world's women must tote the works themselves. For many women, the tote bag is an office away from the desk, a portable dressing table, a locker room, lunch pail, library, shopping cart, travel bag or an amalgam of all these. Such is life today that women often go about hoisting two at once -one for the personals, the other for work. The truth of the matter is that the tote bag is today's indispensable accessory. And there are ones for every budget. In summer, straw versions traditionally are popular. The Gap stores always stock their roomy canvas tote priced at $19.50. Plastic pressed to look like leather is tough and resilient, as are leathers imprinted to resemble even more luxurious ones. This past year, alligator was the overwhelming favorite fake in either of these materials. The real was also remarkably successful, despite its high price tag. This season, ostrich is the favored leather, real or impersonated. Once again, bags made of the real stuff are prohibitively priced, but as is true of alligator, they can last a lifetime. This season, too, tawny tones are the most fashionable and popular. Brown-bagging it has never been more chic.",1987-04-19T05:00:00+0000

Off to the right, lower and more massive, are the western towers of Westminster Abbey, each wearing a prickly crown of four spires. When the afternoon sun is just so, the scene is magical. The surface of the river, faceted by wavelets, is luminous with a bitter blue-silver light. The sky is silvery, too, except in its higher reaches. There the mists reflect the tawny coloring of the Westminster limestone, and the air around the palace seems brushed with gold.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"BILLYBALL. By Billy Martin with Phil Pepe. (Doubleday, $16.95.) Given the stormy reputation of its author, a former manager of the New York Yankees, this book is surprisingly mild in tone and substance. The stated purpose of the volume is to present Billy Martin's views on managerial strategy and tactics. Some of the chapters do indeed discuss aspects of the craft - when to bunt or hit-and-run, how best to utilize one's personnel, what the strengths and weaknesses of current major league managers are and so on. Unfortunately, such topics pop up more or less randomly, with little rhyme or reason in the sequence of subject matter. If the book has any theme at all, it is not managerial decision-making but a chronological account of Mr. Martin's career, both as player and manager, accompanied by his opinions on such things as the players' current economic power, Commissioner Peter Ueberroth's positive influence and drugs in baseball. Fans who crave more of Billy Martin should enjoy ''Billyball''; those who prefer a more structured and systematic presentation of managerial strategy would be better off reading ''Weaver on Strategy,'' co-written by the Baltimore Orioles' former manager, Earl Weaver.",1987-04-19T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"A LIFE IN MOVIES: An Autobiography. By Michael Powell. (Knopf, $24.95.) The author of this intelligent and superbly written autobiography, the British film director Michael Powell, is known in this country chiefly for the cult ballet movie ''The Red Shoes'' (1948), though some consider the subtly erotic tale of Anglican nuns in the Himalayas, ''Black Narcissus'' (1947), and the benignly decadent, self-reflexive ''Peeping Tom'' (1960) even better. What is perhaps most fascinating about this book is Mr. Powell's obvious intention of chronicling the entire history of British and American cinema through his own career. And he almost succeeds. The first part of the book offers an affectionate paean to silent film making, which he learned at the side of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Rex Ingram in the 1920's. He then moves on to his struggle to establish himself as a director in England in the 30's and to the powerful films he made during World War II with the screenwriter Emeric Pressburger, ending with an insightful portrayal of the rapacious creativity of postwar Hollywood. The co-stars of this autobiography are the legendary British moguls Mr. Powell worked for, such as Alexander Korda and Arthur Rank, but we also get incisive portraits of the likes of Laurence Olivier and Alfred Hitchcock along the way. Though success makes him swagger a bit now and then, Mr. Powell is remarkably egalitarian in an industry that thrives on self-promotion, giving elaborate credit to everyone who has ever worked for him. Alas, this is also the book's chief weakness: this closely-printed, 700-page volume covers only the first half of his life, up to the late 1940's. Now an octogenarian, Mr. Powell seems to want to get everything down all at once, including all the trips he has ever taken and apparently everyone he has ever known. Despite the occasional longueurs caused by the tyranny of his total recall, one looks forward to hearing about the rest of his eventful life.",1987-04-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Gooden Case: Sharing Blame,"A few thoughts concerning Dwight Gooden. 1. The Mets' organization should be rebuked for letting a gem become tarnished. 2. Davey Johnson, the manager, should be dismissed - or at least given a stern reprimand - for being blind to the plight of his star pitcher. It's impossible to believe that he was looking when Gooden was having pitching problems. He and the pitching coach were only concerned with his ''push-off'' off the mound. What nonsense. What blindness. 3. The sportswriters don't come off too well in this either. After the story broke, they all said ''there were rumors.'' What did they do about that? Did they track them down? Did they go to management? What did they do? 4. I hope that Gooden returns and performs as he did in 1985 -for his sake, not the Mets'. Doubleday, Wilpon and Cashen simply don't deserve to benefit at the box office from Gooden's comeback. 5. A personal note. As a fan nearing 60, I hope that Gooden returns in style. I figure he is the last baseball player whose career I will get involved with -rooting for him as if he were family. RICHARD WALDSTEIN Manhattan",1987-04-19T05:00:00+0000

The resignation paves the way for a shake-up of the entire army high command. Page A1 By resolving the military mutiny, President Raul Alfonsin achieved a triumph that was a watershed in Argentina's long and often frustrating struggle for democracy, officials said. A14 China's birth rate is rising again as the country's monumental and controversial birth control campaign loses its grip, experts say. Growing rural wealth seems partly responsible. A1 A computer will be shipped to Iran following a decision by the Reagan Administration to permit export of the $900,000 system, officials said. The decision overrode objections by the Defense Secretary. D1 News analysis: South Korea's crisis of confrontation between the Government and opposition leaders has been exacerbated by President Chun Doo Hwan's decision to end debate about altering the electoral structure. A8 West German peace marchers returned for annual Easter demonstrations that have been held since 1959. This year, Ronald Reagan's enthusiasm for abolishing medium-range missiles has made him the demonstrators' ally. A6 Neo-Nazis have increased efforts to prove their contention that the wartime diary of Anne Frank is a hoax. The attempts to discredit the diary follow the publication of its most complete version. A10 Many Mexicans are returning home from the United States, propelled by new immigration legislation. For the Mexican Government, the change in traditional patterns of migration is a social and economic challenge. A4 Army role in contra case studied A2 P.L.O. chiefs are making up A3 In Libya, a wary middle class A3 NATO commander wants missiles A6 Sri Lankan guerrillas kill 15 A8 Composer seeks to leave Soviet A11 Tanzania plants the three R's A12 NATIONAL A18-27 Karl Linnas was deported last night to the Soviet Union, where he faces a death sentence as a Nazi war criminal. His departure came after the Supreme Court refused to block his deportation, ending years of litigation. A1 Oil development in an Arctic refuge for wildlife was recommended by Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel. Mr. Hodel said that the plan offered the best hope for a major onshore oil strike within the United States. A1 Country music is on the rebound after half a decade of slumping sales and stifled creativity. Record sales of country music, which had slumped to $175 million annually, have climbed above the $200 million level. A1 Commercial use of television news is creating rising concern. The use of video news releases, which are produced by public relations firms but look like news reports, cause some to worry about misleading viewers. A18 A Colorado law allowing deadly force to be used by homeowners against intruders is creating controversy. ''The law, in my estimation, is a legal loophole for murder,'' said an assistant district attorney in Denver. A19 Evacuations of Japanese-Americans by the United States government during World War II was wrong and their detention ''deplorable,'' the Solicitor General told the Supreme Court. But he argued that it was too late for the victims to sue. A24 A Federal agency will investigate its own operations following allegations of impropriety. Top officials of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may have had improper contacts with electric utility companies. A18 Michael Deaver sought to overturn his perjury indictment. The former White House aide depicted the special prosecutor as a vindictive person who was intentionally distorting truthful testimony. A23 A search for new ''solar systems'' is under way. Discovery of one would buttress theories that life exists elsewhere in the universe. C1 Milwaukee school rights case A20 Labor adopts a novel tactic A21 A fight to visit the dead A22 Plan to save Louisiana wetlands A27 WASHINGTON TALK A26 Profile: Esther Coopersmith REGIONAL B1-4 Simplified telephone rates were proposed by the New York Telephone Company. Under the new system, calls within New York City and within sections of Long Island and Westchester County would be billed at the same rate. A1 Dozens of hospital patients died from missed diagnoses, emergency room errors and medical and nursing mistakes in 18 private and public hospitals in New York City from 1983 through 1985, a report says. B3 Two pandas arrived at the Bronx Zoo recently, and will make their first public appearance to New Yorkers on April 30. Their arrival marks the culmination of seven years of negotiations with the Chinese. B1 Some fear a waterfront development will destroy a slice of New York's past on the East Side. Opponents of a luxury apartment plan say it would put a wall between the river and two older apartment complexes. B1 Mel Miller criticized the Governor for vetoing the ethics bill that passed the Legislature. But Mr. Miller said he would try to negotiate a bill Mr. Cuomo could approve. B4 Seven people were killed by a fire in Camden. Three adults and four children died and another child was critically injured by the blaze that swept through a brick rowhouse.

us,Q&A,"Q. What is the clear, tart liquid that sometimes forms on the top of yogurt? A. This liquid is whey, the thin watery part of milk that separates from the curds, the thicker, white portion, when milk is fermented to make yogurt, according to Michel Saintain, a researcher at the Dannon Yogurt Company. The whey consists mainly of water and a small amount of potassium and calcium, while most of the protein and calcium is contained in the curds. The longer fermentation lasts, the more whey migrates to the top of the yogurt container. Mr. Saintain said the whey can also be shaken out of the heavier yogurt protein during shipping, especially when trucks are used, he said. Manufacturers can control fermentation through refrigeration. ''If we didn't stop the fermentation after a short period of time, we would create some type of cheese,'' Mr. Saintain said. Q. What is smoke and what gives it its color? A. Smoke is a suspension of tiny, solid particles in a gas. Smoke contains minute particles of ash, carbon and other products of combustion that are suspended, but not dissolved, in air. These particles are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye but appear as a continuous flowing medium.

While Sunday's had to do with a romantic woman who presents a watch to a practical engineer ''with a soft spot for me,'' the other ad's underplayed headline is: ''She'd told me at the beginning I would know when the time was right to whisk her away for a weekend.

The 6-to-3 ruling, which sustained an Indiana law, was an important victory for companies seeking takeover protection. Under the law, a company could deny voting rights to those making tender offers or to any investors who increase their holdings above a certain level.

[ D1. ] MARKETS Stock prices rallied strongly on Wall Street as concerns on interest rates and inflation eased. The Dow Jones industrial average nearly equaled its best point gain ever, rising 66.47 points, to 2,337.07, a performance that had its roots in a firmer bond market and computerized trading.

us,Boxing Changes Made,"Jose Torres, the chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, said yesterday that, starting in mid-May, a boxing manager and a promoter who are related to one another will no longer be permitted to be associated with a match involving a fighter to whom both have rights. Torres said that a fighter in that instance would then have the option of securing another manager or negotiating on his own with the promoter. Another rule change that Torres said the commission expects to effect by mid-May would forbid a manager who has rights to both fighters in a single bout to negotiate for both men. These changes, Torres said, grew from the investigation by Joseph Spinelli, the state's Inspector General, following the World Boxing Association heavyweight title fight last Dec. 12 between Tim Witherspoon, then the champion, and the challenger, James (Bonecrusher) Smith. Smith, who replaced Tony Tubbs after Tubbs said he had a shoulder injury, knocked out Witherspoon in one round as part of Home Box Office's heavyweight unification series. Tubbs, who was promoted by Don King and managed by King's son, Carl, had asked that the bout be postponed so that he would not lose his chance to fight for the title. He has brought an $11,425,000 suit against both Kings. Witherspoon, who was managed by Carl King and promoted by Don King, has also brought a suit that includes the Kings as defendants.",1987-04-22T05:00:00+0000

People in Fresh Meadows, transcending the usual grumbles of other neighborhoods, oppose providing even the most elemental social services in their community. What is there to fear from a half-dozen infants? New York City urgently needs decent care for increasing numbers of abandoned, abused and neglected children. Some are infants, the boarder babies, who have languished for months in hospital cribs because of an acute shortage of foster homes. The city, criticized for being slow to find suitable homes, recently earned praise for progress. It includes putting some temporarily into group homes. The Human Resources Administration's plan to lease a family-sized house in Fresh Meadows was part of that effort. No more than six babies at a time would be placed in the house, all under age 2; the average stay would be three months. Who could possibly object? Fresh Meadows residents find reasons that make little sense: ''People . . . coming all kinds of hours; the mothers, people who work there changing shifts, people visiting.'' In fact the home would be no more disruptive than a large family or a neighborhood play group. The opposition sounds racist. City officials have tried to address even that mean irrationality. The babies are to be taken to a neutral site for visits - if any - with relatives or prospective foster parents. In any case, the city would open the home on a temporary lease, pending exhaustive review procedures that give community residents ample opportunity to voice their concerns.",1987-04-23T05:00:00+0000

A1 Sri Lanka attacked bases of two Tamil guerrilla separatist groups in the north, killing 80 people, in reprisal for two terrorist bombings that killed at least 237 people. A14 An ex-CIA official is a principal in the criminal investigation of the Iran-contra affair, the special prosecutor said. The former official, Thomas Clines, worked with Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. A10 Iran has sentenced a U.S. engineer, Jon Pattis, to 10 years in prison, saying he had spied for the Central Intelligence Agency, Teheran officials announced. A11 Moscow's latest offer on short-range arms was criticized by a senior Washington official, Kenneth L. Adelman.

us,Q&A,"Q. Our bathrooom tiles were painted blue by the previous owner. The original tiles were white and, although old, seem in good shape. The blue paint is chipping off where it gets wet, and we want to remove it all. Are we better off using a paste paint remover or a heat gun? A. I favor a semipaste remover that is water washable and nonflammable. A heat gun might cause tiles to crack or harm the grout or the cement that holds the tiles in place. A remover may be more expensive, but it is usually faster. Lay it on in thick layers over a few square feet at a time. Give it time to soften all the old paint, then scrub with a stiff brush and detergent solution. Q. I recently put a layer of unfaced insulation over 25-year-old insulation in my attic. The paper vapor barrier on the old insulation has deteriorated, and now the new insulation shows signs of condensation on its surface. I don't want to put down a new vapor barrier. Is there a paint that I can apply to the ceilings below to keep moisture out of the attic? A. Yes, some paints will act as vapor barriers. One nationally sold latex type is Glidden's Insul-Aid. Other products that will work as vapor barriers are shellac-based sealers like B-I-N and Enamelac (both can be thinned with alcohol). Most high-gloss alkyd enamels (not latex) also act as vapor barriers. Q. Our house is in an area with a high water table. The previous owner installed perforated drainpipes in a ditch around the interior perimeter of the basement and connected these to a sump. However, the water-collecting trench at the base of the walls is always wet, sometimes overflowing and flooding the floor. I have read that it is best to install these drain lines in an excavation around the outside footing. But waterproofing contractors I have called in merely want to replace the existing system. Who is right? A. There is no definite right or wrong. In most cases digging around the outside is best, if the job is done right. However, this is a lot more expensive than interior installation. And in 9 cases out of 10, installing the drains on the inside works almost as well - again, if the job is done right, which it seems yours was not. The drainpipes are not large enough or were not put deep enough, or the angle of slope toward the sump may not be steep enough. If a knowledgeable contractor rebuilds the system properly, I think this should do the trick.",1987-04-23T05:00:00+0000

Sixteen top-flight jazz pianists are to play a marathon of solos and duets tomorrow and Sunday at the Parsons auditorium to raise money for a piano scholarship in the New School's Jazz Department, which is now completing its first year. The performances each day are to be a continuous series of pianistic musical chairs from 2 to 7 P.M. The first pianist each day will play 20 minutes as a soloist and then will be joined by a second pianist for 10 minutes of duets. The second pianist will then play 20 solo minutes, after which still another pianist will appear for 10 minutes of duets and subsequent soloing - and so forth for five hours. Tomorrow, the pianists will be Sir Roland Hanna, Dick Wellstood, Derek Smith, Hilton Ruiz, Roger Kellaway, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Hal Galper and James Williams. On Sunday, Dick Hyman, Herman Foster, Tommy Flanagan, Jaki Byard, John Hicks, Barry Harris, Joanne Brackeen and Ken Werner will play. Tickets can be bought at the box office, 66 Fifth Avenue. Admission is $20 for each day. Patron's tickets at $100 include admission to both concerts and the opportunity to socialize with the pianists in the musicians' room when they are not playing. 14th Annual Birthday Tribute to Duke Ellington, St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street (935-2200). The first celebration of Duke Ellington's birthday, April 29, at St. Peter's Church was organized by the Rev. John Gensel in 1974, barely a month before the great jazz composer, pianist and bandleader died at the age of 75. Since then, St. Peter's birthday celebration has been an annual event, an occasion for paying tribute to the Duke and hearing his music. This year's celebration, which is to be held on Sunday, has a slight twist - the High Society Quartet, led by the drummer Bill Eldridge, will play a program of compositions by the Duke's alter-ego, Billy Strayhorn. ''In effect,'' as Mr. Gensel points out, ''Billy Strayhorn will be paying tribute to the Duke.'' The celebration will also include some little-known Ellington compositions played by the Ellington scholar and pianist Brooks Kerr and performances by the baritone saxophonist Joe Temperley, who occasionally substituted in the Ellington band for Harry Carney and who now carries on the Carney role in the band led by the Duke's son, Mercer. Musicians in the audience will join in a jam for the Duke at the end of the concert, which is to start at 7 P.M. There will be a free-will offering.",1987-04-24T05:00:00+0000

In such a world retrospection would be visionary, and events would be rescued from seeming entropy, from mere accident and mere loss.

us,NEW & NOTEWORTHY,"FATHERHOOD, by Bill Cosby. (Berkley, $6.95.) The television star's humorous reflections on parenting include thoughts on the care and feeding - as well as the naming, the dressing, the educating and the letting go -of children. Last year our reviewer, Karen Ray, said the book's message is ''that children are often exasperating and that fatherhood is both rewarding and difficult -with emphasis on the difficult.'' THE HOUSE IN PARIS, by Elizabeth Bowen. (Penguin, $6.95.) An illicit love affair blossoming in a French boarding house has tragic and long-lasting consequences for several sets of characters in this novel by the Irish-born author Elizabeth Bowen (1899-1973). In 1936 our reviewer, Edith H. Walton, said the work is ''so perfect of its kind, so witty and so subtly exciting, that even those with robuster tastes can hardly deny its excellence.'' Scenes involving children, she added, ''are almost miraculously good; they are sheer delight. . . . Actual pain and ecstasy break through the fragile, elaborate structure of Miss Bowen's craftsmanship.'' KEEPING HOPE ALIVE: On Becoming a Psychotherapist, by F. Robert Rodman. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) While this memoir was intended as a guide for prospective psychotherapists, F. Robert Rodman ''writes so well of his experiences . . . that the book should have wide appeal,'' Dava Sobel said in The Book Review last year. ''Accounts of his patients sparkle with his candid reactions. . . . He has the ability to define monumental concepts in psychiatry - schizophrenia, transference neurosis - in a sentence or two without trivializing them.'' A FALL FROM ALOFT, by Brian Burland. (Norton, $6.95.) Bound for public school in England, 13-year-old James Berkeley leaves his home in Bermuda in 1942, serving on a freighter that must cross submarine-infested waters. In 1970 one reviewer found the novel ''tightly and superbly crafted'' and praised its ''unsentimental, unlovely, and altogether harrowing exposure of adolescence.'' Norton has also reissued the second novel in Brian Burland's Bermudian trilogy, A FEW FLOWERS FOR ST. GEORGE ($6.95). SATURDAY NIGHT: A Backstage History of ''Saturday Night Live,'' by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad. (Vintage, $8.95.) The authors trace the evolution of NBC's ''Saturday Night Live'' program, which achieved cult status in the mid-1970's, and show how the pressure of trying to maintain that popularity affected its creators and stars. ''The book is packed with the kind of behind-the-scenes information that reveals the world behind the hoopla,'' Ellin Stein said here last year, ''besides having a special interest for those fascinated with the mechanics of production.'' NO MARBLE ANGELS, by Joanne Leedom-Ackerman. (Saybrook/Norton, $7.95.) These nine stories are variations on the theme of separation - barriers created by age, race, sex and class. The author writes with honesty and compassion, Jill McCorkle said in these pages in 1985, and ''her dialogue is sharp and accurate, drawing the reader close to the conflicts that produce full-bodied characters deserving of the emotional impact they evoke.'' ALL THE OLYMPIANS: A Biographical Portrait of the Irish Literary Renaissance, by Ulick O'Connor. (Owl/ Holt, $10.95.) The turn-of-the-century Irish literary renaissance was a remarkable phenomenon and produced a galaxy of greats, including the likes of Wilde, Shaw, Yeats, Joyce, O'Casey and Synge. Ulick O'Connor's ''biographical portrait'' of the literary revival ''captures the excitement and the spicy flavor quite splendidly,'' Desmond Rushe said in The Book Review in 1985, ''and a delightfully vivid portrait it is.'' GODBODY, by Theodore Sturgeon. (Signet/New American Library, $3.50.) God reveals Himself to the residents of a small American town in this novel by Theodore Sturgeon (1918-1985). Told in a series of first-person testimonies, the ''modern-dress version of the Gospels, or, to be more accurate, of the Second Coming, is a fitting coda to Mr. Sturgeon's career,'' Gerald Jonas said here in 1986. ''It takes risks that only a mature writer would take, and it is more successful than it has any right to be.'' REDISCOVERING AMERICA: John Muir in His Time and Ours, by Frederick Turner. (Sierra Club, $10.95.) John Muir (1838-1914), the Scottish-born naturalist and conservationist who dedicated his life to preserving America's wilderness areas, is the subject of Frederick Turner's biography. In 1985 our reviewer, John Tallmadge, called it ''imaginative, beautifully written,'' and its style ''masterly and loving.'' Another publisher, Penguin, has reissued MY FIRST SUMMER IN THE SIERRA ($6.95), a diary-memoir written by Muir in the summer of 1869, which he spent in the Sierra Nevada. In 1911 our reviewer found in the record ''some of that quietly joyful stuff of which pastoral poetry is made,'' and said the book is ''charged with the awe that dwells in mountain silences.'' AMMIE, COME HOME, by Barbara Michaels. (Berkley, $3.50.) Ruth Bennett's college-age niece brings a visitor home to their 150-year-old house in Washington's Georgetown section - an archeology professor who's an authority on black magic. ''When the seances get going and the ghosts walk (and talk), the ectoplasm grows thick enough for even nonbelievers to take notice,'' Martin Levin said here in 1968. THREE FARMERS ON THEIR WAY TO A DANCE, by Richard Powers. (McGraw-Hill, $4.95.) This first novel by Richard Powers consists mainly of the unnamed narrator's extended meditation on a 1914 photograph by August Sander of three young German men going to a dance. In 1985 our reviewer, Marco Portales, said the author's ''writing engages, and his re-creation of the characters' thoughts captures postmodern, fragmented 1980's consciousness well.''",1987-04-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"FADED GLORY, VANISHED HOPES By John Logue. 230 pp. Boston: Little, Brown & Company. $16.95.    DREAMS of bygone glory dominate the lives of a diverse group of Alabamians in John Logue's intriguing novel, set in the capital city of Montgomery in 1967. The populist Governor, Jesse Stuart, recalls his youthful hopes that his gifts as a baseball hero would lift his family from rural poverty. A cynical newsman, Jack Harris, yearns for the passion and commitment that had distinguished his coverage of the famous bus boycott. A black clergyman, James Boone Jr., guiltily regrets his loss of faith; his parishioner, Arabella Jackson, whose son has died in Vietnam, wants to bury him on a beloved hillside, now annexed to the city's whites-only cemetery. In covering this dramatic story, Jack Harris runs into an even more explosive one: the Governor is secretly selling criminal pardons to secure his family's fortune before news of his mortal illness becomes public.   There is material here for several novels. Mr. Logue, who is the creative director of Southern Living magazine, nicely catches the inky ambiance of the newsroom before the computer terminal took over, and he has created a persuasive narrative voice for Jack Harris, the editor-narrator. Yet the author allows Harris to tell only portions of the story, disconcertingly shifting in and out of third-person narration in ways that sever the dramatic links his complicated tale requires. Moreover, perhaps his experience as the author of three mystery novels has led Mr. Logue to take technical shortcuts in which violent action substitutes for acuity in characterization.   The story is set precisely in January 1967, yet the mood of the novel seems distinctly late 1970's. Harris walks in front of Martin Luther King Jr.'s church on Dexter Avenue, musing about ''a movement now as forgotten as the river,'' without mentioning the great Selma march past that very spot not two years before. Boone complains that the burial of a black soldier shouldn't cause an uproar because ''nobody here wants to think about this war anymore,'' a sentiment that seems totally wrong for Alabama in 1967. Similarly, the police are stern with the surprisingly small number of redneck opponents of the soldier's burial and astonishingly courteous to the black mourners.   As the soldier's family watches his internment, an angry white family scrambles in the clay to remove a coffin from the adjacent plot. Having failed to rouse a violent protest, they have obtained a court order allowing them to open the grave rather than allow their mother to be buried near a Negro. Despite the historical discontinuities of the mood, Mr. Logue has written a powerful epitaph for the social conflict that still gripped Alabama in 1967.",BOATS AGAINST THE CURRENT,1987-04-26T05:00:00+0000

Washington and Los Angeles Rams do not chose until the second round No. of Projected Teams Picks 1st Pick Comment Tampa Bay 16 Vinny Testaverde The Bucs will spend other picks Buccaneers Miami QB trying to improve a poor defense. Indianapolis 11 Cornelius Bennett He is supposed to be better than Colts Alabama LB Lawrence Taylor was at this point. Buffalo 13 Rod Woodson He has it all for the position, and Bills Purdue DB the Bills need every bit of it for a poor defense. Green Bay 13 Alonzo Highsmith He's a tough inside runner for a Packers Miami FB team that couldn't run. San Diego 12 Brent Fullwood The Chargers want to rely less Chargers Auburn HB on their passing game, and he would make it possible. St. Louis 14 Reggie Rogers The Cardinals need a pass Cardinals Washington DE rusher to make the secondary even more effective. Detroit 10 Jerome Brown In a run-heavy division, they have Lions Miami DT to be able to stop it, and Brown excelled at Miami. Houston 14 Shane Conlan Other needs may be greater, but Oilers Penn State LB he's too skillful and smart to pass up here. Philadelphia 10 Danny Noonan The Eagles are determined to Eagles Nebraska DT help defense early, which means taking the highest-rated player left if they don't trade down. Pittsburgh 13 D.J. Dozier The Steelers' running game has Steelers Penn State RB fallen off badly, and they need a breakaway threat. New Orleans 12 Harris Barton Rueben Mayes showed he was Saints North Carolina OG too good a runner last year not to have a quality line in front of him. Dallas 12 Shawn Knight The Cowboys' line has gotten Cowboys B.Y.U. DT old; it's time to rebuild. Atlanta 12 Kelly Stouffer If they don't start developing a Falcons Colorado State QB quarterback for the future, they will have no future in the playoffs. Miami 12 John Bosa The Dolphins need everything on Dolphins Boston College DE defense but nothing more than a quick pass rusher. Los Angeles 10 John Clay He's big, over 330 pounds, and Raiders Missouri OT that's the way Al Davis likes his linemen. Minnesota 11 Tony Woods A reach here, but the Vikings Vikings Pittsburgh LB need defensive help, and he can also play as a down lineman. Cincinnati 14 Jason Buck The Bengals failed to generate Bengals B.Y.U. DE much pressure on quarterbacks, and weak defensive ends were part of the reason. Seattle 13 Mike Junkin With no defensive instant-impact Seahawks Duke LB players left in the draft, Seattle may have to go for a longer- range project. Kansas City 12 Kenny Flowers How many years have the Chiefs Chiefs Clemson RB been looking for a running back? The search continues. Houston 14 Haywood Jeffires A burner to match Ernest Givens Oilers N.C. State WR would make it awfully tough on opposing secondaries. New York 13 Jeff Bregel It's no secret the line has been Jets U.S.C. OG flirting with trouble, but a 280- pounder from a run-oriented offense should ease the sting. San Francisco 13 Roger Vick He has good hands, and that's 49ers Texas A&M FB the kind of fullback Bill Walsh likes in his offense. New England 11 Rod Bernstine The running game fell off Patriots Texas A&M TE precipitiously last year, partly because they nad no blocking tight ends. Cleveland 10 Ricky Nattiel Defensive line is a bigger need, Browns Florida WR but a big, fast receiver will help a developing passing game. San Francisco 13 Dave Croston With three starting linemen 33 or 49ers Iowa OT older, it may be time to start looking for replacements. Chicago 11 Mark Ingram The Bears' quarterback situation Bears Michigan St. WR is bad enough, without prolonging the shortage of good wide receivers. Denver 11 Terrence Flagler The Broncos' inability to run in Broncos Clemson RB the Super Bowl was typical of their problems all season. New York 12 Nate Odomes He's a pure cover player, ideal Giants Wisconsin CB for man-to-man defenses, which would enable them to pressure quarterbacks even more. Washington 11 Alex Gordon The strength of Washington's Redskins Cincinnati LB defense has been front and 30th pick back, and it's time to find a versatile linebacker to help out. Los Angeles 9 Ron Morris With Jim Everett developing at Rams S.M.U. WR quarterback, the Rams need a 47th pick speedy receiver to match Ron Brown on the other side.",1987-04-26T05:00:00+0000

Now, after some experience, architects have a much better sense of what attracts people than they did in the 1950's, when Lever House and the Seagram Building were among the only skyscrapers in town with outdoor space dedicated to public use. The most successful and active areas, open-air or enclosed, have proved to be those that offer a mixture of attractions - food, seating, architecture, sunlight, air-conditioning, shops, cafes, fountains, art or gardens. Here, three Times writers sample these public spaces around town. RESTAURANTS From the marmoreal opulence of the hall in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue to the leafy expanse of the Park Avenue Atrium (between 45th and 46th Streets) opportunities for dining, or simply noshing, have blossomed in Manhattan in recent years. The resounding commercial success of the Citicorp Center in midtown, completed 10 years ago, with its buoyant food bazaar on the ground level, underscored the demand in this frenetically paced town for informal drop-in restaurants that satisfy time-pressed office workers and at the same time humanize potentially sterile public spaces.",1987-04-26T05:00:00+0000

Alex Justin is an ordinary New York teen-ager who lives with his family in Stuyvesant Town in the 1950's when we first meet him in these pages. Ordinary - but for one thing: he is an extraordinary baseball player who makes it onto the farm teams, into the majors and, 30 years later, to the perfect play that he dreamed about all his life. As we follow Alex through four decades, it soon becomes clear that although Peter Gethers has framed his story knowledgeably and colorfully around the national pastime, he is more interested in the dreams of men and women, those who seek perfection and recognition - as he calls it, ''getting blue'' -and those who shy away from it. Mr. Gethers, who has written a previous novel, ''The Dandy,'' and is a co-author of ''Rotisserie League Baseball,'' writes excellent descriptions of farm-team life in a Southern town where Alex meets the young players he will grow old with. The range of characters is, like that of war stories, wide: the Deep South fundamentalist who has a hopeless predilection for getting hit by pitched balls, the superb young black outfielder, the Midwestern pitcher who is too cynical to be carried away by the spirit of the game. In effect, the women serve as mere accessories, except perhaps Alex's wife, who learns that she too is a person unto herself. The story is lined with violence and inordinate clinical accounts of sexual encounters, to the point where thighs and sighs, thrashing and bashing, obscure what begins as an intelligent and sensitive treatment of a man who discovers for himself that nothing fails like success. For all its wool-gathering and bed-rumpling, ''Getting Blue'' is a good, fast read. Mr. Gethers may not have homered, but he has hit a very nice double.",1987-04-26T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Reagan's vision of a Strategic Defense Initiative may never be achievable in space but it has packed a powerful diplomatic punch. Moscow has shown itself willing to pay a high price in reducing offensive arms to slow the program down. But now the dream and the punch are fading, fast. Congress expects to cut the Star Wars funding request in half. Equally devastating, a group of leading American physicists now concludes that it would take 10 years even to assess whether critical Star Wars components would work.",1987-04-26T05:00:00+0000

For a long time, of course, boards of trustees and audiences snobbishly demanded foreign conductors, which shut out Americans from the major orchestras.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"RUNAWAY. By Lucy Irvine. (Random House, $18.95.) Very early in Lucy Irvine's account of how she dropped out of schools and into communes, hitched rides through Britain, Western Europe and the Middle East, scrounged meals and relied on the kindness of strangers, this reader got the uncomfortable feeling that hers was less the tale of an adventuresome young woman than that of a disturbed adolescent. Although many teen-agers feel ready to tackle the world on their own, what kind of parents let them do it? In the author's case, being allowed to leave school at age 13 sets the pattern for a series of increasingly dangerous journeys, interrupted periodically by stays at her father's hotel in the Scottish Highlands. These pastoral interludes hardly restore her equilibrium, since her chief task seems to be to serve pastries to male guests. The ultimate, predictable brutality befalls her at a deserted lakeside in Greece where, naively, she has assumed she was being taken to swim. Unable to repress this trauma, she makes her way back to England and a psychiatric hospital. There, a partially drawn curtain discloses characters in a familiar setting: seductive father, rejected mother, a marriage that failed long before it ended. To the narrator, all this seems forbidden territory, best avoided by another escape, this time into the classroom and her teacher's bed. Ms. Irvine writes a frank and lively, if overwrought prose (tension bursts off the tongue in ''snappy bubbles,'' ''chunks . . . crack off'' the parents' marriage, and so on). By the end of the book, she has joined forces with a man who wants a ''wife'' to share a yearlong exile on a tropical island. That adventure furnished material for the author's previously published ''Castaway,'' a more disciplined, focused work than this one.",1987-04-26T05:00:00+0000

''I practically lived on those spleen-filled buns when I was a student,'' he said, sighing with nostalgia. ''They're the best street food of the city.'' But warning us that guasteddi might be a little harsh for our unschooled palates, he told us we could eat a highly refined version in a restaurant called Harry's Bar. When we got to Palermo we phoned up Harry's but were told they didn't serve the dish. I think we would have let the matter rest there, if, during our wanderings in The Vucciria, a maze of alleyways lined with food stands that is one of the great markets of the Mediterranean, we hadn't seen men hungrily lining up to buy guasteddi and then devouring them with gusto on the spot.",1987-04-26T05:00:00+0000

The myth is so alluring it can survive even the most scaled-down atmosphere. On a typical New York night, for instance, David Leavitt, Meg Wolitzer and Gary Glickman - all novelists in their 20's and the best of friends - are likely to be having dinner at their favorite restaurant, a dingy, hole in the wall in the West Village. ''Even as we sit there,'' Glickman says, ''I sometimes wonder, 'Is this it? Is it the Cafe de Flore?' '' As Hemingway might have said, isn't it pretty to think so?",1987-04-26T05:00:00+0000

Now, after some experience, architects have a much better sense of what attracts people than they did in the 1950's, when Lever House and the Seagram Building were among the only skyscrapers in town with outdoor space dedicated to public use. The most successful and active areas, open-air or enclosed, have proved to be those that offer a mixture of attractions - food, seating, architecture, sunlight, air-conditioning, shops, cafes, fountains, art or gardens. Here, three Times writers sample these public spaces around town. PLAZAS AND ATRIUMS Direct sunlight is perhaps the most obvious attraction of the International Paper Plaza (behind the office tower at 1166 Sixth Avenue, between 45th and 46th Streets). On the right spring day, many New Yorkers simply bask here, often in the company of fusilli al pesto from Plums, the carry-out charcuterie at the back of the plaza.",1987-04-26T05:00:00+0000

President Reagan is expected to tell Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone this week that the restrictions might be lifted. Page A1 In a Japanese gesture to Washington, Mr. Nakasone instructed Japan's Fisheries Agency to re-examine plans to conduct whaling in the Antarctic for research purposes. A3 Bihar is India's poorest state, with an annual per capita income of $111, lower than in the poorest countries of the world. It is also the country's most corrupt, violent and lawless state. A1 Emigration of young Irish people has resumed on a scale that experts describe as a national crisis. ''Let us not fool ourselves that what is happening in Ireland today is any less than disaster,'' one Irish emigrant said. A1 The Icelandic Prime Minister lost the majority of seats in Parliament in a general election, he conceded. A left-of-center feminist party will have the balance of power in negotiations to form a new cabinet. A7 Brazil's finance minister resigned. Dilson Funaro, who was largely responsible for Brazil's decision in February to suspend interest payments on its $68 billion foreign-bank debt, said his decision was irrevocable. D1 The effects of the Chernobyl disaster on health will continue into the next century. Radiation exposure could cause mental retardation and genetic defects, but some problems may not become evident for 50 years, experts said. A8 Changing attitudes in Europe A9 Environmental and economic crises are interlocking problems that threaten humanity, a United Nations commission warns. The commission concluded that environmental protection and economic growth are inseparable. B12 An arms dealer may have conspired to defraud the Government during the Iran-contra affair, officials said. The special prosecutor is considering criminal conspiracy charges against Albert Hakim, an Iranian-born arms dealer. A2 Poles to free 9 prisoners A3 London Journal A4 Curfew ended in Sri Lanka A6 Arafat lauds P.L.O. unity A9 NATIONAL A12-16, B6-9 Disarray in the alien amnesty plan has caused confusion across the country for many of the referral networks for the immigrants, interviews show. The legalization process for some aliens is to begin next week. A1 Building black support is difficult for all the Democratic presidential hopefuls in the South, where blacks make up a large portion of the vote. But in the 1988 campaign, the task presents unusual problems. A1 George Bush's image problems hamper his campaign for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination. ''Mr. Bush brought this on himself by displaying an excess of caution,'' one former aide to the Vice President said. B8 W. Wilson Goode is favored to win renomination for Mayor of Philadelphia less than a month from now and go on to reelection in the fall despite accusations of incompetance. B9 The farm workers' union is troubled by a financial crisis that could halt its operations, its lawyers said. It is already bedeviled by membership losses, a fall from political favor and organizing difficulties. A14 At one church, sermons and rodeos both take up the minister's time. The Cowboy Church in Fort Worth is a blend of rodeo ambiance and evangelical Christianity that has gained a loyal following. A12 The Rev. Jerry Falwell may resign Tuesday as head of the PTL Club, the troubled television ministry, he said. Mr. Falwell said he was under pressure from ministers around the country to withdraw. A12 What is the Midwest? The question gets many different answers from researchers. ''Everybody knows the Midwest is out there, but there's very little scholarly work on precisely where,'' one professor said. A13 Earthquake threat posed in Pacific Northwest A12 States Vying for Supercollider A16 N.R.A. board survives move B7 Casey in critical condition B9 WASHINGTON TALK B6 Planning for hearings on Iran REGIONAL B1-5 Some welfare officials are ineligible to hold their positions, city officials said. Almost half of the top managers of New York City's welfare system may not qualify for their jobs under the Civil Service rules. A1 The oldest undercover agent in New York State is an 81-year-old retired social worker who took on a fictitious identity to help flush out payoffs in the nursing home industry. ''The mystery excited me,'' she said. A1 Some rescuers have become victims of a collapsed apartment building in Bridgeport, Conn., after days of tension and anguish. Some volunteers have pushed themselves to exhaustion and then begged to go on working. B1 Debris from collapse site studied B2 The Y.M.C.A. would build a tower on the West Side of Manhattan under a plan being advanced by the group. Neighbors oppose the tower, which would rise above the West Side Y.M.C.A., adding a copper peak to the Central Park West skyline. B1 Rebuilding subway cars will cost $1.7 billion by 1991, when more than 4,000 are expected to have been overhauled. The Transit Authority considers it a wise investment. Others regard the program more warily. B1 A law firm's narcotics investigation resulted in the dismissal of three employees, but the chance for criminal convictions has been harmed because the firm did not immediately alert authorities, officials said. B2 The corruption scandals are an issue in a special election in south Queens, where candidates are seeking to replace Gerdi E. Lipschutz, a former Assemblywoman. The scandals have haunted Queens Democrats for more than a year. B3 Meese aides warned on Wedtech B2 Holocaust victims memorialized B3 Limits on F.B.I. files asked B4",1987-04-27T05:00:00+0000

The Crampton-Moody pair combined for a best-ball 64 and completed 72 holes at 251, a tournament-record 29 under par on the Onion Creek Club course. Their total broke by four shots the 72-hole record of 255 set last year by Don January and Gene Littler. It was the eighth victory for Crampton, 51 years old, in his brief Seniors tour career, and the third for Moody, 53. Each collected $60,000. Bobby Nichols and Butch Baird came on with a last-round 62, 8 under par, and finished second at 255. In the Legendary Champions competition for players 60 and older, Jerry Barber, 71, and Doug Ford, 64, scored an easy seven-shot victory.(AP) Haas Rallies, Takes Playoff: Jay Haas ran in a 60-foot birdie putt to force a playoff, then sank a 2-foot par putt on the first playoff hole of the Houston Open to deny Buddy Gardner his first PGA Tour victory. Gardner, who got his fourth runner-up finish, chipped out of a bunker to within 3 feet of the cup on the par-3, 177-yard first playoff hole at No. 16. Haas, in winning his sixth tour event and earning $103,000, chipped off the fringe on his second shot, then sank a 2-footer after Gardner missed his short par putt.(AP) Hockey Canada in Playoffs: Canada gained the playoff round of the world championships by beating Finland, 7-2, yesterday. But Sweden, which needed a point from its game against the Soviet Union to guarantee a place in the last four, lost by 4-2. The two results forced the International Ice Hockey Federation to decide whether to obey a court order restoring West German victories over Finland and Canada that the federation had taken away because the Germans had used an ineligible player. Canada's victory over Finland guaranteed that it qualified, along with the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. If the Finns were allowed to keep the points awarded them after throwing out the West German victory, they would be tied with the Swedes and advance on the strength of beating them, 4-1. Otherwise, Sweden would advance. (AP) Auto Racing Four Straight for Earnhardt: Dale Earnhardt charged past a spinning Geoff Bodine with only 17 laps left and raced off to his fourth straight victory, taking the Sovran Bank 500 at the Martinsville (Va.) Speedway. Bodine appeared to have the race well in hand, leading Earnhardt by about 5 seconds as he tried to end a 26-race victory drought. But on lap 484 of 500 on the half-mile oval, Bodine got tangled up with Kyle Petty in the second turn.(AP) Horse Racing Ms. Eloise Wins on Late Charge: Ms. Eloise made her patented late run work to perfection for the third straight time when she came from last in the field of eight to register a three-quarter-length victory in the $230,800 Top Flight Handicap for fillies and mares 3 years old and up at Aqueduct. Carrying 116 pounds under Robbie Davis, Ms. Eloise went a mile and an eighth on the fast track in 1:50 1/5. Beth's Song, the second longest price in the field, was runner-up a length ahead of Clemanna's Rose. Ms. Eloise earned $138,480 for Margaret E. Grimm with her fourth victoryin seven starts this year.

Last year the unaffiliated, Class A Bees gave Derrel Thomas, Mike Norris, Daryl Sconiers, Steve Howe, Fernando Arroyo, Darryl Cias and Ken Reitz a chance to attract the scouts, but none got a return call to the majors. Reitz and Sconiers are now back in San Jose, where they've been joined by Charlie Moore, Steve McCatty and Roger Erickson. Warren Brusstar quit the team last week, and he had his reasons: a 20.77 earned run average, 14 hits, 3 walks, a hit batter and 2 wild pitches - all in four and one-third innings. Meanwhile, the Marlins, like the Bees a Class A haven in recent years for last-gasp big-leaguers, have become a way station for Dennis Martinez, one of those man-without-a-team free agents. Martinez, who could be headed back to Montreal after May 1, joined Miami a week ago and got some quick work -eight innings in two games, with no earned runs yielded.",1987-04-27T05:00:00+0000

Results were helped by reduced raw material and energy costs; lower salaried staffing levels and by a change, in the method of accounting for pension costs, effectively July 1, 1986.

us,Why the Dollar Ought to Drop,"Some say the dollar is too weak. Others say it is too strong. In either case, the dollar's steady march downward that began two years ago has now brought it back to 1980 levels. Paul R. Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology international economist and former staff member of the Council of Economic Advisers, argues that the dollar will - and should - continue to sink. Q. How much more will the dollar fall? A. It will fall perhaps as much as another 20 percent. And it will take something like that for the U.S. to be able to balance the trade deficit. Since the last time we had balanced trade, which was in 1981, a number of the aspects of the world economy have become more adverse: lagging growth in Europe, the third-world debt crisis, increased competition from new sources and the loss of the superior technology the U.S. once had. All this means the dollar has to fall even further to offset some special advantages we no longer have. Q. What happens if the dollar doesn't fall by that much? A. The big danger is the trade balance fails to show improvement and, in the short run, protectionist pressures get out of hand. But, we have no options. Sooner or later the dollar will fall. The world will not allow the U.S. to borrow infinite sums of money. And the longer we wait, the more debt that will be built up, the further our competitive decline will have come and the harder the fall when it comes. Q. What are the inflationary risks of a falling dollar? A. There is no avoiding inflation. We are beginning to see some of that, and it's been pretty mild so far. If we don't pay the inflationary costs, we will pay them later - with interest. It's hard to think of a better time to accept it than now when the underlying inflation is low. And if inflation goes back up, the Federal Reserve may feel it has to tighten monetary policy. I hope they won't do that, but I can understand their nervousness. Q. And recession? A. The risks of recession come if the dollar doesn't come down. If we go staggering along with only modest improvements in our trade balance and if the rapid growth we've seen in domestic demand does not continue forever, which it will not, we do run the risk of recession. Q. Do you think that the world's central banks will act jointly to support the dollar?",1987-04-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q.What does a sievert measure? A.The sievert is an international measurement of tissue damage caused by the absorption of radiation. It accounts not only for the amount of radiation absorbed at a point in the body but also for the damaging ability of that radiation based on its distribution, according to Dr. Roland A. Finston, director of health physics at Stanford University. In the United States, the standard unit of absorbed radiation dosage is the rad, or radiation absorbed dose, which is equal to energy absorption of 100 ergs per gram. The typical chest X-ray supplies one-tenth of a millisievert. A millisievert is one-thousandth of a sievert. The sievert unit is equal to 100 rads of X-radiation or gamma-radiation absorbed into soft tissue. For other types of radiation, one sievert may be produced by less than 100 rads. The distinction is necessary because the damage caused by radiation in living tissue is proportional not only to the amount of energy absorbed but also to the type of radiation exposure. Some kinds of radiation are more damaging than others. Q.Why do beavers build their dams? A.Beavers build dams in order to maintain a supply of water that will hide the entrance of their burrow and allow for food storage. They place long sticks, beginning in the middle of the channel, parallel to the current and hold them in place with rocks and mud. Extensions are built to each shore. The dam holds the water level constant so that the submerged entrance to the beaver lodge will keep terrestrial predators out. The resulting pond also makes it easier for the beaver to pull limbs and twigs for food and constructing the dam.",1987-04-28T05:00:00+0000

The currency was lifted by supportive comments from President Reagan and a collapse in precious metals that eased fears of inflation. Some analysts predicted near-term stability for the dollar, although many remain bearish for the longer haul. In New York, gold fell $17.50, to $445 an ounce. [ Page D1. ] The precious metals markets had their wildest day in years. Silver was especially volatile, swinging from a high of $11.25 to a low of $7.20, before ending at $7.80. [ D1. ] The stock market ended lower despite a valiant effort to rebound. After being down 42 points in early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average wound up losing 4.83 points, at 2,230.54. Trading was enlivened by mining issues, which swung wildly and ended sharply lower. [ D14. ] ''Short interest'' on Nasdaq stocks rose 6.1 percent, to 197.9 million shares, for the month ended April 15. [ D30. ] Bond prices staged a dramatic comeback after plunging in earlier trading. The Fed had been expected to inject reserves into the banking system to drive down the Federal funds rate. But rates rose after the Fed did not act, which traders took as a positive sign because it would help the dollar and make Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors. [ D25. ] THE ECONOMY A study finds that the world economy would be helped little by the policies of Treasury Secretary Baker and those of Japan and West Germany, according to officials familiar with the research. In effect, the work concludes that the international coordination that Secretary Baker has sponsored - as a means to resolving currency turbulence, trade imbalances, uneven growth and third world debt - will not produce the 3 percent growth with low inflation that the major nations say is needed for global prosperity. [ D1. ] President Reagan assailed a trade bill amendment offered by Representative Gephardt as a ''dangerous'' proposal. He said the provision, which would require retaliation against nations with large surpluses, could disrupt the world trading system and jeopardize relations with some major trading partners. [ D8. ] An auction of mortgages on low-cost housing was called off by the Administration. An official warned that the sale could lead to displacing low-income families from their homes. [ A1. ] COMPANIES Lotus signed a 10-year agreement with I.B.M. to design software for the computer company's largest models, starting with a version of Lotus 1-2-3 for the System/370 mainframes. The move is critical to Lotus in its battle with Microsoft, the maker of the operating system for I.B.M. PC's. The new alliance might have a devastating effect on Ashton-Tate, the No. 3 software maker. [ D1. ] Texaco's activities will be monitored by 26 of its creditors, including Pennzoil. The creditors, which were appointed to two committees by a Federal trustee, will also work on a plan of reorganization for the oil company. [ D1. ] GAF withdrew its hostile offer for Borg-Warner, deciding not to top the $4.23 billion bid by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners. GAF expects a pretax profit of more than $190 million on its Borg stock. It also plans to buy back up to three million of its own shares. [ D1. ] Chrysler expects a final accord to acquire American Motors in the next 10 days. The auto maker, which also reported a 24.4 percent drop in first-quarter income because of marketing and retooling costs, disclosed several cost-cutting moves. It also said that it would expand production at the recently acquired Lamborghini. [ D2. ] Goodyear Tire and Rubber posted a first-quarter profit of $284.2 million, compared with a loss of $212.7 million a year earlier. The nation's largest tire company attributed the improvement mainly to the sale of several non-tire businesses. [ D2. ] Burlington Industries was accused of taking illegal steps to manipulate its stock price in order to thwart a takeover bid from Dominion Textile and Asher B. Edelman. [ D5. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS The dollar's downward march will - and should - continue, argues Paul R. Krugman, an economist at M.I.T. He predicts that the currency will fall another 20 percent. Talking Business. [ D2. ] The recent buffeting of newspaper stocks has divided analysts.

Mr. Walsh gave his strongest indication that he would seek indictments. Page A1 A senior arms adviser was rebuked by the Reagan Administration for criticizing its arms control strategy. Edward L. Rowny's comments could complicate talks with the Soviet Union, Administration officials said. A1 Kurt Waldheim assailed a U.S. move to bar him from entering the country, calling the decision ''incomprehensible.'' The Austrian President said he had a ''clear conscience'' about his wartime activities. A1 U.S. studied Waldheim data A6 News analysis: James Baker's ideas for addressing pressing economic problems were praised when first announced. But signs of economic deterioration have caused the Treasury Secretary to be seen as a man with nothing new to offer. A1 Italy's Parliament was dissolved by President Francesco Cossiga, who said he saw no chance of putting to-gether a majority to govern the nation. The Government then ordered elections for June 14. A3 The contras killed a U.S. citizen in an attack, the Nicaraguan Government said. Benjamin Ernest Linder of Portland, Ore., is the first American civilian reported to be killed by the Nicaraguan rebels. A3 In Zimbabwe, abolishing white seats in Parliament is being approached cautiously by Prime Minister Robert Mugabe in his drive to turn the multiparty democracy into a one-party state.

The shooting of the high-school football player has led to assemblies on youth violence and calls for hard-line strategies against crime. A1 A political scientist was rejected as a nominee for the National Academy of Sciences. Samuel P. Huntington was turned down after an internal struggle over whether his work amounted to equations used to dress up political opinions. A1 Paul Laxalt will run for President. The former Nevada Senator, who was President Reagan's closest friend in Congress, announced that he was a candidate for the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination. A22 Kemp has campaign shakeup A23 Congress may call films propaganda under a 45-year-old law, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-to-3 decision. The Court rejected the claim that classifying some foreign films as ''political propaganda'' violated the First Amendment. A28 New rules to protect farm workers were issued by the Labor Department. The rules require that clean drinking water and sanitation facilities be provided on large farms to nearly 500,000 fieldworkers. A22 Jim Bakker's salary was cut off by the leadership of the PTL television ministry and he will not be allowed to return to the group, officials said. The Rev. Jerry Falwell agreed to stay on as the ministry's chairman. A22 Jim Wright favors a larger bailout for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation than he had originally sought. The Speaker of the House said the thrift industry's problems were greater than he had realized. D1 ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' will be re-released by Disney, accompanied by a large promotional effort. The film has won a place in movie executives' hearts.

A1 Columbia will receive $25 million from the chairman of the Metromedia Company, officials from the university said. The gift from John W. Kluge, a Columbia graduate, will be the largest in the school's history. B1 The Mafia has infiltrated industries and unions, Federal prosecutors said at a racketeering trial of 12 men. ''It is fundamentally a case about the Mafia of the 1980's - the mob gone corporate,'' one prosecutor said. A33 A program to train minority youths should be undertaken by business leaders, Governor Cuomo said. He said that he hoped the leaders would comply out of ''love,'' but that the program would also be in their self-interest. B1 Man in the news: Harold T. Shapiro was high on the list of candidates to be the new Princeton University president, although few thought he would take the job. But Dr. Shapiro will become the university's 18th president. B2 A legislator's use of public funds is being questioned in New York. Allegations against State Senator Leonard P. Stavisky have come to light at a time such practices are being investigated by the Manhattan District Attorney.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 1987","THE ECONOMY The House approved a restrictive trade bill amendment, reflecting disarray over the direction of a new trade policy. The measure, proposed by Representative Gephardt, requires retaliation according to a rigid formula against countries such as Japan, whose large trade surpluses with the United States have grown, in part by shutting out American products. The measure was passed by a close 218-to-214 vote, suggesting that it may be abandoned in a final House-Senate compromise. But supporters said its approval meant that the final bill would be tougher, in any case. [ Page A1. ] Prime Minister Nakasone of Japan arrived in Washington for talks to defuse the trade dispute with Washington. [ D4. ] The volatile index of leading indicators rose 0.4 percent in March, the fifth increase in six months. At the same time, the February increase was revised downward by nearly one-half. The latest figures seemed to suggest that the economy will accelerate only slightly in coming months. [ D1. ] Sales of new homes slumped 3.6 percent in March, while the nationwide median sales price climbed to a record $101,500. [ D8. ] MARKETS Merrill Lynch said it had lost $250 million on bonds that plummeted in value when interest rates surged. Wall Street executives could not recall an occasion when a securities firm lost so much in so short a time - apparently in little over a week. Merrill attributed the loss largely to unauthorized trading by a senior official, who was dismissed. But executives at the firm said that supervisory lapses and errors in judgment had contributed. [ A1. ] Bond prices plunged in tandem with the dollar when the House passed the Gephardt amendment. The bellwether long bond lost more than 2 points. Market experts said the vote raised fears that Japanese investors may reduce their participation in next week's $29 billion quarterly Treasury refunding. [ D1. ] The dollar fell sharply against the yen in U.S. trading, and dealers said that traders feared Japanese retaliation on trade. In New York, gold dropped $1.25, to $450.50. [ D22. ] Silver futures advanced, while gold contracts closed lower. [ D22. ] The stock market scored a strong gain despite an upward swing in interest rates and an undercurrent of nervousness. A surging technology sector and solid earnings reports pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up by 22.30 points, to 2,254.26. [ D12. ] Yields were mixed for consumer money products. Rates rose on certificates of deposit, but were unchanged for bank money market accounts. For money-market mutual funds, the seven-day yield fell and the 30-day yield rose. [ D19. ] The S.E.C. will ask Congress for the authority to regulate, for the first time, the securities operations of commercial banks. [ D2. ] COMPANIES Ford's quarterly earnings more than doubled, exceeding the combined first-quarter profits of its domestic competitors. The performance exceeded analysts' estimates, and Ford's stock surged by $6 in heavy trading, to $87.75. Analysts said the results reflected Ford's model mix, effective cost-cutting measures and the weaker dollar. Meanwhile, union leaders said they expected Ford to share its good fortune with workers in coming contract talks. [ D1. ] Texaco reported a 64 percent drop in earnings, citing depressed oil prices and the ''direct and indirect costs'' of its legal fight with Pennzoil. But Texaco's stock rose as the earnings report was overshadowed by speculation about the activities of the two committees of creditors that will monitor Texaco during its bankruptcy proceedings and by rumors of a Texaco-Pennzoil settlement. [ D1. ] Burlington accused Paine Webber of leaking inside information to several parties, including Asher B. Edelman and Dominion Textile, to induce them to take over the textile producer. [ D4. ] Donald J. Trump has sold his stake in UAL for a profit of about $80 million, a source close to the New York developer said. [ D4. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS A.T.&T. learned that deal making can be unpredictable in Europe, in part because of the importance of politics there, when it lost out to Ericsson in a three-way competition to acquire France's second-largest telephone switching company.

us,Q&A,"Q.The ceilings in my house are covered with old, yellowing 12-inch-square tiles. I do not want to paint them, but would like to cover them to give the appearance of a smooth plastered ceiling. Can I plaster over them or cover them with wallpaper that will conceal the seams, or do you have other suggestions? A.Ceiling tiles are quite porous and have a fuzzy, textured surface, so plastering is impossible. A wall covering would be equally impractical. Your best bet is to put up a ceiling of gypsum board (dry wall). You may be able to nail these up over the tiles, but you would get better results by taking the tiles off and then putting up the dry wall. Cover the joints with joint cement and the perforated tape sold for this purpose. Q.The cedar shakes on our house get blacker with mildew every year. We have been told of companies that wash this off with a powerful spray, but this might ruin some brittle shakes. Besides, we feel that after the washing we would have to stain or treat the shingles again. Aside from its ugliness, is this mildew causing any harm, such as rotting the wood? A.Mildew can harm wood shingles and structural members inside the wall. It should be cleaned and the fungus killed with a mildewcide. Mix about one part fresh liquid laundry bleach to four parts water. Throw in a handful or two of trisodium phosphate (TSP) or a similar cleaner. Scrub this on, let dry and rinse with lots of water. Repeat if necessary. As for treating the shingles with stain or a clear preservative, this should be done periodically anyway. It helps protect the wood from checking and discoloration, and a water-repellent stain or preservative helps keep moisture away so there is less chance of the mildew's returning. Q.The front wall of our brick fireplace stretches to the ceiling and in several places we have noticed a powder that looks like salt coming out of the brick. It is unsightly, and I am afraid to hang anything on the wall or to put a clock on the mantel because it might be damaged by the white powder. Can you tell us what might cause this problem, and what can be done? A.The white powder is efflorescence, caused by moisture that leaches out alkaline salts in the masonry. You can remove it by washing the brick with a mild acid solution, such as one part muriatic acid (sold in paint stores) and five parts water. However, it may come back. A permanent cure requires solving the moisture problem outside. A missing or cracked cap at the top of the chimney, defective flashing or caulking where the chimney meets the house wall, or mortar joints that need tuck pointing in the outside brickwork are common reasons for your moisture problem. Q.An old brass chandelier turned black, so I cleaned and polished it with brass polish and soap-impregnated steel wool. The metal had a nice shine, so I sprayed it with a clear lacquer to keep it from tarnishing. However, the lacquer dried with a dull finish, rather than a high gloss. What went wrong? A.There are two possibilities. The spray lacquer might have been semigloss, rather than high-gloss. Or when spraying, you might not have held the spray can at the right distance. Directions usually say 8 to 10 inches, but this can vary among brands. If you hold the spray too far away, the fast-drying lacquer begins to set up while still in the air, creating a slightly fuzzy, dull finish. Holding the spray can too close can do the same, because you might overspray work that is still wet. Spray on lacquer in several thin coats, not one heavy coat, and keep the spray can moving all the time.",1987-04-30T05:00:00+0000
