''We've tried to give it a home look, and make it more contemporary, change it a bit from the country look it used to have,'' said John Braden, the designer of the elaborate set that allows the show's hosts, David Hartman and Joan Lunden, to work and be seen in different seating situations.

''If the chairs are not comfortable, we look self-conscious,'' said Mr. Hartman, who is tall. Other areas included in the redesign were ''a single-chair confrontation'' area near the fireplace for serious interviews, and further afield, a sofa grouping for ''celebrity'' chitchat. There's also a metal spiral staircase, carpeted, leading to nowhere but meant to give the impression that the ''house'' has a second floor; a mock greenhouse addition to the living room that is full of seasonal plastic flowers; a grandfather clock; a small library with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books and such tsatskes as a china zebra's head, what was once a Bible stand and is now topped with a wooden eagle, and a kitchen for Julia Child, still being decorated.",1981-06-04T05:00:00+0000

''American Buffalo'' is as reductivist as ''An American Tragedy'' is expansive. Instead of a big story and torrents of grand prose, Mr. Mamet's play provides only an inconsequential anecdote and declarative sentences of one-syllable words.

If some of the kitchen's efforts are lackluster, most of the dishes offered are skillfully seasoned with onions, coriander, crushed roasted peanuts and fiery chilies, mellowing garlic and cooling cucumber and the highly perfumed juices of lemons and exotic Kaffir limes.

The distinction is not incidental. As the Museum of Modern Art's John Szarkowski - one of the few to compare Heinecken's and Rauschenberg's work - noted in ''Mirrors and Windows,'' Rauschenberg's prints absorb photographs, while Heinecken's allow a ''precipitate of fact'' to cling to them.",1981-06-07T05:00:00+0000

With ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' however, the Duke has finally had a posthumous Broadway success, a revue in which his music, most of it from his earlier period - the first 25 years of a 50-year career as a band leader and composer - is used as the basis of a show that has no dialogue. ''Sophisticated Ladies'' is all singing and dancing and, for an Ellington fan, it provides an opportunity to hear a significant part of the Ellington repertory which the Duke neglected in his later years played with a verve that reflects the early Ellington spirit and is much more in keeping with the music than the occasional reorchestrations that the Duke later made of the more popular of these early works.",1981-06-07T05:00:00+0000

INTRODUCTION","At the time of her arrest in 1937 on false charges of terrorism, Eugenia Ginzburg was 31 years old, an idealistic member of the Communist Party and a teacher of history at the University of Kazan.

For many of those years, she worked outdoors at hard labor in temperatures of minus 40 degrees centigrade. And yet, the German novelist Heinrich Boll notes in his introduction to the second volume of her memoirs, ''Within the Whirlwind,'' to be published tomorrow, ''this astonishing woman ... never lost her sense of humor (as) she was shunted about between a number of hells and a few dots of 'heaven.'

us,Baseball Notebook;          Foster Makes Big League Hits,"Glenn Sample, the baseball coach at the University of Cincinnati, is also the official scorer for the National League at Reds games. During the baseball strike, he agreed to let the major leaguers use some of the equipment at the school to work out at Nippert Stadium. A lot of players declined for fear of getting hurt, but George Foster showed up for yesterday's workout along with Dan Driessen, Dave Concepcion, Ron Oester and Ken Griffey. Pete Rose of the Phillies, who lives in Cincinnati, was there on Monday but absent yesterday. ''Foster hit some that are still rolling out in the stadium,'' said Sample. ''It's 345 feet down the left-field line at the field and 365 feet down the right-field line. It's a bigger park than Riverfront Stadium.'' Foster, who was batting .297 and tied with Dave Kingman and Mike Schmidt for the league lead in home runs with 14 when the strike hit, said, ''It's important to be ready all the time. You're able to stay physically ready, but the mental part is more difficult.'' Sample doesn't mind chasing the balls and he also lets his players throw batting practice. ''It's a thrill for the college players,'' said Sample. ''It's like you are a scientist and Albert Einstein comes in and says hello.'' If the baseball strike is not over by Friday, Steven Freifeld, first grade teacher at the Marion Street School in Lynbrook, L.I., is in big trouble. ''Read 150 books by June and I'll treat you to a Yankee game,'' Mr. Freifeld told his 23 students last January in an effort to spur them to good reading habits. Eleven completed the assignment and 7-year-old Christine Miller plowed through 259. So Mr. Freifeld kept his part of the bargain by arranging a trip to Yankee Stadium for Friday, the last day of school, and he even arranged with the Yankees to flash a message on the scoreboard paying tribute to ''Lynbrook Marion Street First Graders, All-Star Readers.'' Yesterday, however, the teacher said he was finding it hard to explain to first graders the complexities of free-agent contracts. ''One child said he'd kill me or kill the Yankees,'' said Mr. Freifeld. ''I told them we'd go to a movie instead. I'm still hoping for a short strike.'' The strains of ''Take Me Out To the Ball Game,'' ''Orioles Magic'' and ''Wild Bill's Fight Song'' could still be heard on the jukebox at the Olympic Lounge in Memorial Stadium in Baltimore Monday night. That's because Wild Bill Hagy and other diehard Orioles fans were determined not to let the strike stand in the way of their postgame drinking and revelry. Hagy is the Birds' self-appointed cheerleader, who gained fame from his right-field seat in the 1979 World Series. As ''Wild Bill's Fight Song'' explains in its country music fashion: ''They had no one to lead their cheers until Wild Bill had too many beers.'' And Monday night he was leading an anti-strike party, originally scheduled to be held after the game the Orioles were supposed to play against the Texas Rangers. ''It's the fans who pay the bill,'' said Hagy. ''I think we should have a voice and that's why we're calling this anti-strike rally.'' The Mets announced yesterday that the weekend series between their Tidewater Class AAA affiliate in the International League and the Yankee-affiliated Columbus Clippers in Norfolk, Va., would be broadcast over WMCA in New York, Saturday night (7:30) Sunday (2 P.M.) and Monday night (7:30). The Mets regular broadcasters - Bob Murphy, Ralph Kiner, Steve Albert and Art Shamsky - will handle the play by play, but the club didn't say which ones would be making the trip. The Tides, currently in Toledo, are two games behind firstplace Columbus. ''We were preparing for the weekend, so I guess we have about 120,000 frankfurters in the refrigerator right now, plus beer and ice cream, which will hold for a couple of weeks at least,'' said Larry Kieran, manager of the Harry M. Stevens catering service at Shea Stadium. The Stevens people also handle the Astrodome in Houston, Fenway Park in Boston and Candlestick Park in San Francisco. They say they don't make enough in their other operations at the race tracks, Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands or Madison Square Garden to make up the slack. Then there is the problem of the scorecards that were printed up and delivered for the games over the weekend. They are not good anymore, but they will probably bring 10 times their face value at some baseball collectors' shows in the future. It's hard to tell how much the Mets are losing in revenue. Last year's attendance was 1,178,000, the second worst in the club's history. This year's attendance of 349,474 after 25 home games was slightly improved over last year's 225,569 at the same point. But at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, where crowds of 50,000 a game are not uncommon, it is estimated that the Dodgers are losing $225,000 per game.",1981-06-17T05:00:00+0000

ON THE HOTTEST DAY OF '81, THE MERCURY RISES TO 93","If some like it hot, they were not saying so yesterday, the hottest day of the year, and many were downright uncomplimentary about the accompanying smog and humidity. The temperature in Manhattan rose to a high of 93 degrees at 2:40 P.M., and the temperature-humidity index of 86 at 2 P.M. matched the highest reading for all of last summer. ''Comfort is shot,'' one meteorologist said. From a distance, Manhattan seemed in the morning to be a city packed for shipping, engulfed in gray textured air. Weather experts said the condition was caused by a temperature inversion - a condition in which the air at higher altitudes is hotter than below, acting as a lid on pollution. Then the Sun Came Out Ozone and carbon monoxide levels were high throughout the city, and the State Department of Environmental Conservation issued a recommendation that those with respiratory problems reduce activity. Some of the smog cleared by midday, revealing the sun not to be a 15-watt light bulb, after all. But temperatures climbed to new high points for the year throughout the New York metropolitan area, including high readings of 97 in Newark and 89 in White Plains, the United States Weather Service reported. Cool ocean breezes gave some relief to shore communities and most of Long Island, but air movement on the streets of Manhattan proved as refreshing as a blast from a 1,400-watt hair blower. Even those profiting from the mugginess complained. ''What good is getting rich if you die of the heat?'' asked Paul Ramirez, a street vendor who was doing a land-office business in sodas and Italian ices on the Avenue of the Americas. Fans Are a Hot Item Sales of air-conditioners and fans were up predictably at stores throughout the metropolitan area. Sandals and perforated oxfords and slip-ons were ''selling like mad'' at the Bellmore Bootery in Bellmore, L.I. At the McDonald's in Tarrytown, N.Y., customers began what manager Andy Campbell said was a perennial seasonal change: ordering less to eat and more to drink. Mr. Campbell said another way he knew that summer had unofficially arrived was that he had to begin policing the ''No Shirt-No Shoes-No Service'' regulation. The Island Recreational store in Central Islip, L.I., was doing an extraordinary business in above-ground swimming pools and swimming pool supplies, according to the manager, Kevin Claeson. And those who own swimming pools went on the alert for attempts by slight acquaintances to invite themselves over. Municipal pools throughout the suburban area were unusually busy. Officials in New York City, where the pools have not yet opened, said they were worried that people would open fire hydrants despite a prohibition in the water-conservation program, submerging the program. Too Hot for Firemen The city had crews of maintenance workers on patrol, looking for open hydrants. ''Spray caps'' have been installed on about 1,000 city hydrants, to let some water come out, but only a fraction of the million gallons a day that would otherwise gush forth. In the Bronx, firemen suffering from heat exhaustion called in extra crews to help battle a blaze that engulfed 12 stores at Longwood and Westchester Avenues. In the evening, commuters -many with ties loosened and jackets over their arms - made their way to parking garages, subways, trains and buses with trepidation, facing a sultry trip home on the hottest day of the year.",1981-06-17T05:00:00+0000

The resolution was agreed to on Thursday by the United States and Iraq. Jeane K. Kirkpatrick, the chief American delegate to the United Nations, said Israel deserved condemnation for not using all diplomatic means to deal with its concern that Iraq would build a nuclear bomb. She said, however, that ""nothing in the resolution will affect my Government's commitment to Israel's security."" (Page 1, Column 6.) Iraq intended to build a nuclear bomb, according to a former inspector for the International Atomic Energy Agency. The former inspector, Roger Richter, told a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that international safeguards would not have detected Iraq's secret production of plutonium, which is needed for a bomb. He also said that his concern over the agency's constraints on inspection of the Iraqi nuclear reactor led him to report to the State Department last year. He said that on the basis of available information, Iraq had an ""aggressive, coordinated program"" to develop the ability to make nuclear weapons in the next five years.

Trends, we believe, should emerge naturally, as a result of some common sensibility that unifies artists and places them in their cultural context.

us,EXPOSING THE LIBYAN LINK,"Five years ago, two former operatives of the Central Intelligence Agency made a deal with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to supply the Libyan strongman with explosives for huge sums of cash. They also hired former Green Berets to set up a secret training school to teach the Libyans the latest techniques in assassination and international terrorism. As a cover for these operations, the two men, Edwin P. Wilson and Frank E. Terpil, operated several seemingly legitimate export companies. To head one such company, they hired another former C.I.A. employee, Kevin P. Mulcahy. For a long time, Mulcahy let himself believe that the entire operation was really part of an unofficial but approved American intelligence operation being carried out by an ''old-boy'' network of former Government workers, intelligence agents and Green Berets with strong and lasting connections to Washington officialdom. In this, the second of a two-part series, Mulcahy discovers that the Qaddafi connection is illegal and not an intelligence operation, and, at considerable personal risk, goes first to the C.I.A. and then to the F.B.I. Seymour M. Hersh, a former reporter for The New York Times, is at work on a book about Henry Kissinger to be published by Summit Books. By Seymour M. Hersh hortly before midnight on a muggy Washington Sunday in September 1976, Kevin P. Mulcahy, a former C.I.A. analyst who was then in the export business, telephoned the duty officer at agency headquarters in McLean, Va.

Israel, using American-supplied planes, had flown over the territories of two friends of the United States (Saudi Arabia, ''protected'' by American Awacs aircraft, and Jordan), bombed Iraq's nuclear installation, and returned uneventfully. Israel, whose Prime Minister boasts that he operates outside any known framework of international conduct, claimed the right of pre-emptive selfdefense even though it is the only Middle Eastern country both to have a nuclear arsenal and not to have signed the nuclearnonproliferation treaty. Having devastated southern Lebanon, waged openly declared war with American weapons on the Palestinian people, overtly threatened and intervened in the lives of millions of Arabs, Israel has become an outlaw state. Yet it continues to be America's major strategic regional asset, receiving no less than 43 percent of the current foreign aid budget.

The Metropolitan Opera was floundering toward financial disaster and possible extinction. In that first Mozart season of 1966, the younger audience had virtually dried up, partly owing to a widespread perception that all music antedating that of the Beatles and Bob Dylan was pointless, not only socially and politically but even, according to the hipper academics, esthetically.

It all derives from the Chinese passion for food, of course. Not even the French and Italians are such natural-bred, analytic, argumentative food critics as the Chinese.

Mr. Klein's venture is causing a tumult of speculation among Milan's fashion designers, who, with characteristic contradiction, agreed that his arrival would affect them not a whit, that he was doing it solely for image and, finally, that the Italian woman is a ''znob'' and would rather buy American any day of the week than something made by an Italian. Next, Gianni Versace, viewed by his fellow designers with suspicion and envy, decided to pull out of the Fiera Campionaria, a complex of buldings where the Milanese show in the fall, and to present his collection in his own showroom. After threatening to go on at the same time as several other designers, he finally reached a compromise and agreed to dates that did not conflict.",1981-06-30T05:00:00+0000
