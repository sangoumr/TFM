us,Film : 'Katzelmacher' Hypnotizes and Amuses,"Erich, who's becoming pudgy, wears a perpetual frown as if it were a fashion accessory. Marie, his pretty, romance-minded friend, clings to his arm as proudly as if Erich were an Olympics champion and not a petty hood.Paul, who's also getting fat, is proud of his hair, which he carefully combs whenever a lock might be out of place. Helga, who loves Paul, chatters too much and every now and then needs to be slapped into silence. Gunda has no guy but she hangs out with the others, hoping, probably, to pick up a castoff.Lower middle-class layabouts, they sit onor lean againstthe railing outside a Munich apartment house in various positions of boredom. They bicker. They brood. Mostly they just stare into space, lined up all in a row like the crows in Hitchcock's ""The Birds.""As they walk into or out of the frame, the camera rather ostentatiously refuses to follow them. Instead, it continues to stare straight ahead at the railing, as if mocking the world-weary attitudes it's been recording so patiently.Occasionally the scene shifts to the corner pub where Erich and Marie and Helga and Paul, sometimes with Gunda and Franz and Rosy, play cards. Sometimes they pair off to make love quickly and perfunctorily in barren rooms, only to return to the railing.Nothing much changes. Nothing changes, that is, until Elisabeth, who lives across the way, rents a room to a Greek worker named Jorgos. The rumors begin to fly. Jorgos is said to be a sexual wonder. Gunda reports a chance meeting in the park with Jorgos as an attempt at rape. The other young men feel threatened. Something has to be done.This is more or less the form of ""Katzelmacher,"" Rainer Werner Fassbinder's second feature film, made in 1969 before he went on to become virtually a one-man German New Wave. ""Katzelmacher""a slang term for troublemakeropened yesterday at the New Yorker as part of the theater's continuing Fassbinder festival. It is, with ""Effie Briest,"" one of the two remaining Fassbinder festival films not to be missed.I've described the style of the film in some detail because it is so hypnotic and eventually so comic. Mr. Fassbinder, even in those early days when the influence of Godard was still apparent, was a complete original, one of the few directors who could make a deadpan film about lethargy, greed and small-mindedness that is simultaneously funny and tough, sympathetic and caustic.His characters, with the possible exception of Jorgos (played by Mr. Fassbinder), who never says much, are either slobs or dimwitted, and though they are totally self-absorbed and given to parroting clichs, they are sometimes capable of the unexpected gesture, as when Marie decides to leave Erich for Jorgos. Paul frets when Helga becomes pregnant; he considers murdering her, or, at the least, of aborting the child. When she loses it anyway, he decides to marry her.The static camera, the exaggerated mannerisms of the actors, the jump-cuts, the repeated themes and variations of scenes, all recall Godard, but the major influence on the film appears to be Mr. Fassbinder's early work in the theater.The screenplay, in fact, is an adaptation of a Fassbinder play, but having seen the film twice I find it difficult to imagine it as anything except an extraordinarily stylish film. It's quite unlike anything else I've seen, with the exception of another early Fassbinder film, ""Recruits at Ingolstadt,"" which was also adapted from a theater piece.Unlike some of the later Fassbinder works, there's little ambiguity about what the director is up to here. ""Katzelmacher"" is scathing about the postwar German economic boom that has, of course, been so kind to the film maker himself. More importantly the flim is an early glimpse of his dazzling talent and the talents of the stock company of performers and technicians who, with him, have created a body of film work unique in any country in recent years.",1977-06-04T05:00:00+0000

Considering the lack of experience of both Mr. Allison and Thomas J. Tobin, the director, the film is something of a technical achievement.It really looks and sounds like a 50's movie. The color is just garish enough and the actors all a bit too prettylike studio contract players in the 50'sand it repeats its few ideas so many times that even the most dimwitted third-grader can get the point.""Fraternity Row"" comes out firmly against bigotry, hypocrisy and hazing in its story about a fraternity pledge named Zac (Gregory Harrison) who attempts to change the system from within, though his girlfriend, Jennifer (Nancy Mergan), remains properly skeptical. The movie also comes out firmly against the tactics of the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy when his charges were made against non-Communists. At the same time it displays great affection for the dopier rituals of the day, including solemn ceremonies in which a young man would publicly give his fraternity pin to the young woman of his choice (""With this pin I pledge thee my heart. . . ."").The actors are all very attractive under the circumstances, which at best, are facetious and, at worst, embarrassing. They include Mr. Harrison, Peter Fox (as an upper classman), Miss Morgan, and, most effective of all, Scott Newman (Paul's son) as the fraternity's cheerful sadist.

It was first published in 1955 when the obscurity of the author, the immensity of his book and his lack of a major publisher would have been enough to assure its being ignored. But it was also ignored because Thompson's committed approach and the fact that in many ways Morris himself was a political failure had little appeal to the readers of the 1950's. It was, after all, a period when consensus historians were generally revered better to be safe than sorryand when ambitious young men were on the slick road to making it. Now our attitude towards failure is much more sympathetic: we are interested, I believe, in those who offer alternatives, who seem to be on the margins of history but nevertheless may have a far firmer grasp on what really matters than those who embody a flashy, meretricious and very often transient success.",1977-06-05T05:00:00+0000

In some respects geography is indeed new. During the 1960's many geographers adopted a more theoretical, approach than was characteristic of their efforts in the past, employed statistical and mathematical techniques in their research, and made effective use of computers, automated mapping devices and satellite photography. Yet not all geographers adopted the methods and modes of thought indicative of the new geography of the 1960's, and the science of spatial organization proclaimed then did not replace the traditional pluralism of the discipline.",1977-06-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Gutman's Wit And World War I,"THE MARCH ON PARIS 1914of Generaloberst Alexander von Kluck  and His Memory of Jessie Holladay,"" which opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art, is the wittiest, most appealing film yet made by Walter Gutman, the stock-market analyst, art critic and patron, painter, philosopher and lover of beauty who, at 74, is one of the more exuberant of independent American filmmakers.In his program notes for the film, Mr. Gutman would have us believe that the making of the movie was really just an excuse to take a trip to France last summer in the company of Jessie Holladay Duane, whom he describes as ""a beautiful young woman who, curse the fates, is a half century younger than me (sic). . . ."" Don't you believe it. The film is much more complicated than that.It's a meditation on loveidealized sexual love, love of war and Mr. Gutman's own love of the beautiful women he appreciates with the intensity of an obsessed collector. The form of the film is free, almost haphazard, though sophisticated in its intent.The inspiration is a book written by Alexander von Kluck (whose name prompts some Gutman jokes), the German general who led the advance on Paris in 1914 and who was turned back at the outskirts of Paris by, among other things, the ""taxicab army.""It is Mr. Gutman's fantasy that von Kluck, some years before 1914, met and had an idyllic affair with a young American woman (Miss Duane) as he was reconnoitering the northeastern French countryside disguised as a painter. The film cuts back and forth between scenes of this affair, chastely mimed and set with no embarrassment at all in contemporary landscapes and scenes detailing von Kluck's drive on Paris, complete with military maps and lengthy quotations from von Kluck's memoirs.Did von Kluck fail because he was bemused by memories of his lost love as he drove his armies through France toward Paris? Probably not. I don't think that's the sort of thing that would appeal to Mr. Gutman's sense of history, though at one point he suggests that the American Civil War could have been over in two years if the Union's Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock had not made the unfortunate decision to go on the wagon. Hancock without booze, says Mr. Gutman, lacked the necessary boldness. Von Kluck was not a great general, drunk or sober.In ""The March on Paris"" Mr. Gutman is not especially concerned with causes and effects. Mostly he is recalling for us his feelings about the war he remembers as a little boy, a war, he says, almost crossly, that few people know anything about any more. He evokes those feelings in still photographs, newsreel footage and drawings, and especially in the recurring images of Miss Duane, whose dark-haired beauty, by seeming so fresh, immediately suggests something so impermanent that it must already have disappeared in the time it took to process the film.Miss Duane is a far cry from earlier Gutman hercinesthe aggressive circus performers and ""strong"" women he so lovingly presented in films such as ""The Graps-Picker's Daughter"" and ""Unstrap Me."" When he photographs her walking through a wheat field, chest-high, we see her as the director doesdesirable, ripe, but also a bit self-conscious, squinting into the sun, quite puzzled about the project she has somehow become a part of.""The March on Paris 1914"" is most personal, original and charming, the best film by far in the Whitney's current season.",1977-06-08T05:00:00+0000

And the current stop of ""Journey Into the Beyond"" at local theaters yesterday is another illustration of the commercial value of filmed things that go bump in the night.

Or, for that matter, when ""the great Issah,"" an African witch doctor, performs the dual feats of bloody eye cataract surgery and rain-making.Although the squeamish, who are warned in advance, may not take to the ""psychic"" abdominal surgery, performed, it seems, without anesthesia or antiseptics, both in the Philippines and in Brazil, they are treated to a variety of less traumatic events. Included among these are the ""psychic"" healing done by a couple of Italian practitioners as well as religious occurrences such as statues and madonnas and humans with unexplained stigmata or tears.""Is there life after death?"" the film's ads teasingly inquire.

us,Screen: 'Rollercoaster' on Track:Suspense Melodrama Stars Widmark and Fonda,"""Rollercoaster,"" which opened at theaters all over town yesterday, is effective pop entertainment that, like an amusement-park ride, deals in the sensation of suspense for the foolish fun of it. It is not, as you might suspect, one of those not-quite-all-star, group-jeopardy movies (""Earthquake,"" ""The Towering Inferno"") in which disaster strikes in the first reel and continues to pick off actors for the next two hours or so.""Rollercoaster"" is a suspense melodrama of the sort that Alfred Hitchcock does best and most wittily (and sometimes most cruelly), and one wonders what he might have made from the material that James Goldstone, the director, treats benignly, as if he didn't want to rattle the teeth of the very young or those of the somewhat older crowd who wear detachable replacements. The Sensurround sound effects, though noisy, are more amusing than scary.The screenplay has the air of something assembled through the good old Hollywood process of, first, treatment, then screenplay, followed by suggestions, counter-suggestions, compromises and rewrites. In whatever manner it was written, it accomplishes what it sets out to do. With a minimum of wasted energy it dramatizes the attempts of various safety officials and law officers to apprehend an extortionist who has been sabotaging roller-coasters from coast to coast.There's no mystery to the audience about the identity of the fellow, played by Timothy Bottoms, a cool young man who carries on a cat-and-mouse game with his prinicipal adversary, a Los Angeles safety inspector played by George Segal.""Rollercoaster"" opens with one quite spectacular rollercoaster crash, but after that it's mainly concerned with tracking the killer from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh to Chicago, to Richmond and then, for the grand finale, back to Los Angeles for a rollercoaster ride that features a 360-degree loop.Considering the material, Mr. Goldstone rather resolutely refuses to allow the rides themselves to dominate the film. As if to emphasize that this is a man-hunt movie instead of a series of cinematic simulations of roller-coaster rides (like the one featured in ""This Is Cinerama,"" which made a number of non-fans queasy), he continually cuts between his subjective camera, mounted on a speeding roller-coaster and the point of view of people on the ground (including us, who always expect the worst).It is just one of the various intelligent options he has exercised to make a movie of such good sport, and one that makes few unreasonable demands on our credulity. The actors, including Richard Widmark as a gritty Federal agent and Henry Fonda as a safety executive, take their roles with the sort of graceful gravity that never betrays the nature of the film.""Rollercoaster,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), treats its mayhem so discreetly that, indeed, one has to look fast on a couple of occasions to know exactly what dreadful event has taken place. The fun is not in the violence, which is almost nonexistent, but in its possibility.",1977-06-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Gods of the Plague,' 1969 Fassbinder Film, Is Quintessential American Gangster Movie","""Gods of the Plague"" (Gotter der Pest), this week's new Rainer Werner Fassbinder film, was made in 1969, the year he also made his second film, ""Katzelmacher,"" which is still one of his best, as well as his first. ""Love Is Colder Than Death,"" which has not yet been released in this country. ""Gods of the Plague"" opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater on a double bill with ""The American Soldier,"" a 1970 Fassbinder film that had its premiere here in January 1976.I mention this chronology because the New Yorker Theater's Fassbinder festival is presenting so many of the director's films in such short order that keeping them straight can be as difficult as sorting out which plots go with which titles of Frank L. Baum's Oz books.Although ""Gods of the Plague"" is described as a sequel to ""Love Is Colder Than Death,"" which I haven't seen, it makes an appropriate companion piece to ""The American Soldier,"" a comically dead-panned contemplation of American gangster films of the 30's and 40's. Where ""The American Soldier"" comes close to parody, though, ""Gods of the Plague"" is absolutely straight, which is not to say that it's realistic or that its narrative is important for itself. ""Gods of the Plague"" is a distillation. It's as if Mr. Fassbinder and his actors had taken a half-dozen Bogart films, mixed in an equal number of Cagneys and Robinsons, added a few Rafts and maybe one or two Monogram melodramas for flavor, boiled them until the stock was almost entirely reduced, and then used the residue to make this film in which gestures and attitudes, characters and events, have the formality of an art that's been dead for 200 years.""Gods of the Plague"" is the quintessential American gangster film if the quintessential American ganster film had been adapted and updated to accommodate a bunch of small-time Munich hoods for whom the holdup of a rather ordinary suburban supermarket is ""the big job."" If ""The American Soldier"" is about movies, ""Gods of the Plague"" is one of the movies it's about.Its hero is Franz (Harry Baer), a taciturn ex-con whose release from prison opens the film. When he goes to a restaurant with his girlfriend for his first taste of freedom, he orders Spam and eggs. He likes Spam and eggs, he says. Joanna (Hanna Schygulla) asks what it was like in prison. ""No worse than on the outside,"" says Franz. His joylessness is profound, and it's consistent with his vision of a world in which everyone is an inmate.The plot of ""Gods of the Plague"" is not quite as complex as that of ""The Big Sleep,"" but it helps to have some program notes, because Mr. Fassbinder, aping Franz's taciturnity, doesn't waste time on explanations. Franz drifts from woman to woman, becomes implicated (wrongly) in his brother's murder, resumes a relationship with a black hood nicknamed Gorilla (Guenther Kaufmann), who actually murdered his brother, and agrees to participate in the supermarket heist to finance an escape to a paradise that may or may not be Greece.It's a world of perpetual gray, of chance meetings, faithlessness, revenge, informers and crooked cops. People talk but they don't communicate. Someone says something and there's a 10-second delay before there's any response, as if the person spoken to felt that if he waited long enough there'd be no reason to answer. Everyone is mannered, even Franz's loony mom, who is not unlike the mom in ""The American Soldier."" Occasionally it recalls Jean-Luc Godard's ""Breathless,"" but where Mr. Godard's characters have dreams, Mr. Fassbinder's have been sentenced to life imprisonment and know it.""Gods of the Plague"" is the work of a very young man who has just discovered the secret pleasures of angst. It's full of the movie associations that once so amused Godard, Truffaut and Chabrol, and it's impeccably performed by members of the Fassbinder stock company.",1977-06-11T05:00:00+0000

Although the resolution did not specify the arrangement of the thirteen stars on the Blue Union, it is interesting to note that the first flag flown thereafter by the Continental Army used the design created by Betsy Ross about a month before the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776. The Betsy Ross flag followea a design suggested by George Washington wherein the thirteen stars were arranged in a circle, indicating that no colony should take precedence. Obviously the design took hold, as is evidenced by the minutes of the State Naval Board on May 29, 1777, recording payment to Elizabeth Ross for fourteen pounds, twelve shillings, and two pence for making ship's colours, thus leading to the adoption a month later of the flag which has served our nation for 200 years as a symbol of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.",1977-06-14T05:00:00+0000

LEVINE's ""A Bridge Too Far,"" the film version of Cornelius Ryan's best-selling book about the disastrous Allied push into the Netherlands in September 1944, proves that there's life in the Old War yet. The movie is massive, shapeless, often unexpectedly moving, confusing, sad, vivid and very, very long.Directed by Richard Attenborough and acted by a cast of thousands, including some very expensive stars, ""A Bridge Too Far"" is certainly equal to Darryl F. Zanuck's ""The Longest Day,"" the film version of the Ryan book about the 1944 Allied invasion of Normandy. In saying that, however, I should admit that this sort of film seems to me to have less to do with the art of movie-making than with the logistics of transportation, housing, food, actors' schedules, demolition, military cooperation and morale. One watches it not so much in admiration as in awe.Unlike ""The Longest Day,"" which recalled one of the Allies' most stunning victories, ""A Bridge Too Far"" recalls one of their most tragic and costly defeats, when, in an attempt to conclude the war before the end of 1944, the English and Americans dropped 35,000 troops behind the enemy lines in the Netherlands to secure five bridges over the Rhine into Germany.The plan was the brainchild of British Field Marshall Bernard L. Montgomery, usually a cautious man, and it would have worked if intelligence reports had been heeded, if the weather had been perfect, if one German army had been surrounded and if luck had been with the attackers.Instead, just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong. At the end of the operation, which was supposed to last four or five days but went to nine, the Allied casualtieskilled, wounded and missingwere more than 17,000, compared to an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 in the Normandy landings.If one doesn't quite grasp the import of this in the film it's because, after a couple of hours, scenes of tanks, buildings and bridges being blown up, of shells exploding, of soldiers being mutilated and of other carnage are all pretty much alike, no matter who ultimately wins the day. Missing is some point of view more particular (and more historical) than the idea that war is hell.What Mr. Levine, Mr. Attenborough and William Goldman, who wrote the screenplay, have successfully brought off, though, is, in the initial sequences, the orderly exposition of what Operation Market Garden was all about, and, in the following sequences, an effective illustration of some of the things that went so wrong. The film is technically a wonder. The shots of the paratroop drops are breathtaking and, if one knows anything about the problems of such filmmaking, the very fact that all the color shots match so well is a major accomplishment.""A Bridge Too Far,"" which opened yesterday at the Rivoli, also seems to me to demonstrate the wisdom of a policy that, until now, I've been inclined to scoff at, that is, the decision to cast star actors in so-called cameo roles. These dozen or so stars are as much the means of such a filmas necessary to narrative coherenceas the screenplay. Not many moviegoers, I suspect, would be able to keep track of the cascading incidents without the aid of the immediately identifiable actors who enact them. Their familiar faces are visual program notes.In addition, some of these actors are very good. Anthony Hopkins is fine as the British officer assigned to capture the bridge at Arnhem and whose troops, without any support whatsoever, hold one end of the bridge for nine days before being overtaken. James Caan stars in a furiously effective episode about a sergeant who forces a doctor, at gunpoint, to operate on his wounded captain. Laurence Olivier and Liv Ullmann give recognizable emotions to Dutch civilians caught in the crossfire, and Edward Fox is quietly but brilliantly funny as a gung-ho British officer.Some of these stars have more to do than others. Elliott Gould is on and off like a station break. Gene Hackman scowls a good deal as the commander of the Polish paratroopers and Gen. James M. Gavin, played by Ryan O'Neal, appears to be growing mysteriously young, having been played by Robert Ryan in ""The Longest Day.""Not all of the episodes are star-studded. There's an eerie moment early in the film when paratroopers come upon the newly liberated inmates of a mental hospital, wandering through a forest like smiling, catatonic ghosts. At Arnhem, in the midst of a German attack, a little old woman, whose house has been taken over by the British forces, frets about the disorder and unseemly noise.If ""A Bridge Too Far"" finally leaves one exhausted instead of exhilarated, this has to do not only with length, but also with the nature of a particular operation that failed. The scale of the failure is impressive, but it doesn't ennoble.""A Bridge Too Far,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") includes some graphic battlefield footage that, under the circumstances, could not easily have been avoided.",1977-06-16T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: Bittersweet, Uneven Slice of Parisian Life","""TOUCHED IN THE HEAD,"" the French comedy-drama that arrived at the Jean Renoir yesterday, leaves a disturbing feeling of youth being wasted on the young. As a bittersweet, somewhat comic diary of a small slice of the lives of four Parisian adolescents, it is despite its obvious good intentions, a roughly drawn portrait whose parts are a good deal more memorable than the whole.Perhaps the muddy black-and-white print, an often muddled sound track and shimmering, sometimes illegible English subtitles can be held partly accountable for the unevenness of this 1974 first feature by Jacques Doillon. It is clear, however, that he is a compassionate observer and critical of the social forces involving the young baker's assistant, his provincial girlfriend, his auto-mechanic pal and the uninhibited Swedish girl who brings temporary emotional upheavals and liberation into their orbit.Since it focuses largely on the room in which the baker's assistant has locked himself as a protest against the boss who has dismissed him, ""Touched in the Head"" has a constricted, shabby look. But since the others join him in what is essentially a lark, they become a mnage  quatre that is decidedly unusual, if not strikingly dramatic.They are, with the exception of Ann Zacharias, as the pretty Swedish catalyst, a basically aimless, callow group still bound by their lower-class social mores, despite this extraordinary fling.As the baker, Christophe Soto is mostly glum but still tender with the shy Roselyne Villaume, whom he seems to love but who, naturally, is confused and hurt when he also makes it with the liberated Miss Zacharias. And Olivier Bousquet is just as frustrated as the apparently unrequited member of the triangle. Miss Zacharias, on the other hand, contributes a charmingly natural performance as the understanding siren, who gives them a momentary glimpse of a more exciting existence.They may be temporarily ""Touched in the Head"" but their sincere, occasionally humorous story remains as fragmentary and inconclusive as their free-wheeling, somewhat juvenile capers.",1977-06-17T05:00:00+0000

Nick Noltt, a blue-eyed blond fellow who appears to have been cloned (clufsily) from Robert Redford's press clippings, plays Frank Hardy.While scuba diving off Bermuda, Jackie and Nick come upon the remains of a sunken vessel that turns out actually to be two. One is a World War II ammunition ship, with a $2 million cargo of morphine intact, and the other an 18th-century French merchantman that was apparently hauling something that someone has to callat least once in a review such as thisa king's ransom in precious jewels.Also figuring in the adventure is a gruff but honorable scuba diver, a role played by Robert Shaw with so much colorful crustiness that if he were a boat, and if crustiness were barnacles, he'd immediately sink. Lou Gossett plays the leader of the bad guys, all of whom are black, which may or may not have sociological significance. I doubt it. As a local beach rat, Eli Wallach looks as if he had been gotten up for a hard-time party.The story, as well as Peter Yates's direction of it, is juvenile without being in any attractive way innocent, but the underwater sequences are nice enough, alternately beautiful and chilling. The shore-based melodrama is as badly staged as any I've seen since Don Schain's ""The Abductors"" (1972), which is to remember incompetence of stunning degree.""The Deep,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a lot of gratuitously unpleasant moments, including a scene in which Miss Bisset is massaged with chicken blood (against her will), a life-and-death fight on an outside elevator that I still can't figure out and another fight in which one man breaks the neck of his opponent, accompanied by an exceedingly noisy ""click"" as the bone is snapped.",1977-06-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Exorcist II: The Heretic' Is Heavy Stuff,"Linda Blair may be the least fleet-footed actress Hollywood has produced since the incomparable Joan Crawford attempted to keep up with Fred Astaire in ""Dancing Lady."" Seen tap-dancing, as she is on two occasions in ""Exorcist II: The Heretic,"" the chubby-kneed Miss Blair appears to be stomping on live cigar stubs. The rest of the movie is even heavier and more lugubrious.Given the huge box-office success of the William Peter Blatty-William Friedkin production of ""The Exorcist,"" there had to be a sequel, but did it have to be this desperate concoction, the main thrust of which is that original exorcism wasn't all it was cracked up to be? It's one thing to carry a story further along, but it's another to deny the original, no matter what you thought of it.I thought it was something even less than good, but this new film, which opened yesterday at the Criterion and other theaters, is of such spectacular fatuousness that it makes the first seem virtually an axiom of screen art. It was written by William Goodhart (with no reference that I could see to Mr. Biatty's original conception, which may be his wish), and directed by John Boorman, a man who makes films (""Leo The Last,"" ""Deliverance"") just fuzzy enough to seem complex, thus to invite closer scrutiny.""Exorcist II"" is a fancified exercise in what might be called ""simultaneity,"" which simply means it contains lots of crosscutting between scenes of simultaneous action, in this case involving characters who are supposed to be in telepathic communication. It all looks very busy, though not much happens.Mr. Goodhart's screenplay picks up the exorcised Regan (Miss Blair) four years after the startling events in Georgetown. Father Lament (Richard Burton), a failed exorcist himself, is commissioned by an old friend, a Cardinal (Paul Henreid), to investigate the original exorcism conducted by the late Father Merrin (Max von Sydow), whom we see in flashbacks alive and, all things considered, fairly well.When Father Lamont cooperates with Regan's psychiatrist (Louise Fletcher) in some experimental work involving ""synchronized hypnosis"" (when the therapist joins the patient in the latter's trance), all hell breaks loose again, though the being that Father Lamont sees still in possession of Regan is no longer identified as the devil. He's now called ""Bazoozoo, king of all the evil spirits of the air."" Even the mythology of the movie is second-rate, less mysterious than opportunistic, as if designed to offend the fewest possible people.""Exorcist II"" begins by looking foolish and slowly becomes a straightfaced film of the absurd. The fight for possession of Regan's soul entails several trips to Africa, two to Rome, and finally a climactic one to the same Georgetown house that figured in the first film.Mr. Boorman's strength, however, is not in his narrative or in his handling of actors, all of whom (especially Miss Blair and Miss Fletcher) look extremely ill at ease. It's in his sets and dcor. I especially liked the psychiatric clinic in a large New York hospital, which looks like the Charles Jordan Fifth Avenue shoe store without the shoes, and the mirrored terrace of Regan's New York penthouse that contains a pigeon cote that seems to be a homage to Louise Nevelson. Everything else, including two immolations, is cold mashed potatoes.",1977-06-18T05:00:00+0000

Initiated in the summer 1976, the project was sponsored by McHugh and Hoffman, Inc., broadcasting consultants, and KPR Associates, a firm of social psychologists. Trendex, Inc., a polling organization, was enlisted to conduct a national survey for statistical support. As with any study of this kind, the conclusions must be handled gingerly. They are useful tools for verifying observations already suggested by common sense and a casual acquaintance with the facts. But they can also become rationalizations for selfinterested tinkering, aimed more at ratings quantity than at content quality but more about that later. In the area of common sense, the study finds that, continuing a pattern set in the early 1960's, the TV audience has become even more selective in what it chooses to view. Conventional broadcaster wisdom once maintained that the audience was an inert lump. Get it to tune into one channel and it would stick with that channel for the evening. In the past few years, however, the ratings charts have demolished that theory. Massive switching from one channel to another, perhaps several times in the course of an evening, has become commonplace. Remotecontrol tuning devices help, of course, but it is also being discovered that the use of TV listings, prereviews and advanced feature articles in the determining program selection has become more widespread, complex and entrenched. This development represents an important key to most of the other conclusions.   ",1977-06-19T05:00:00+0000

And it is here in 1977 that the Quebec Government is trying to reassert French cultural and political power after more than 200 years.

us,Chagall And Art: A 'Homage',"As the world's most renowned living artist, Marc Chagall, who will be 90 on July 7, is proof that Hippocrates wasn't precise in observing that ""life is short and art is long."" And Harry Rasky, the Canadian writer-producer-director of ""Homage to ChagallThe Colours of Love,"" which had its premiere yesterday at the Little Carnegie, is lovingly true to his title in projecting a fairly justifiable admiration of the now legendary man and his immense artistic output.If he ignores critical apathy toward some of Chagall's later work, his unabashed ""Homage"" is, perhaps, more of a tribute to the range and detail captured by the color camera eye, and often poetic dialogue, than it is to extensive analysis or all-inclusive biography.But as a dedicated professional known for such documentaries as ""Tennessee Williams' South"" and ""The Wit and World of G. Bernard Shaw,"" Mr. Rasky, with the aid of appreciative narration by James Mason and Joseph Wiseman, portrays Chagall as an all-too-human figure, as memorably lively and colorful as some of his noted spirited, if mystical, paintings.Tracing Chagall's life through his art from Czarist Vitebsk, where he was born, to his present, flower-filled sanctuary in Provence's sunlit St. Paul de Vence, makes for a color-drenched odyssey that obviously includes a good deal more than the ""Fiddler on the Roof"" or the Metropolitan Opera's immense ""Sources"" and ""Triumph of Music"" murals that most easily come to mind.The succession of dream-world-like paintings teeming with Vitebsk Jewish elders, roosters, donkeys and levitated lovers featuring Bella Rosenfeld, his late first wife, who often served as his model, are minutely inspected and annotated. But this happy, post-1910 Parisian period is balanced by the likes of the fairly moody ""L'Exode,"" which reflects his shock and sorrow for Jewish persecution in his figure of Christ on the cross dominating masses of Jews.There are, of course, a variety of paintings, murals and mosaics on religious and other themes stretching from the United Nations Building stained glass windows to the museums in Jerusalem and Nice and Chagall's own garden in St. Paul. But these, and notably the close-up views of his paintings on the ceiling of the Paris Opra, are a credit to photographic expertise. More important, from a moviegoers' view, is the fact that the white-haired but robust Chagall is engagingly wise, natural and unassuming in seemingly unrehearsed, carefully considered answers translated from the French by his wife, Vava, the former Valentine Brodsky whom he married in 1952. They are, it is also more obvious on film than in words, both a serenely contented couple and in love.The recently closed exhibition of some of Chagall's finest paintings at the Pierre Matisse Gallery here deserved the praise it received. And, although this ""Homage,"" which was televised in Canada on March 30, may be specialized biography stemming from Chagall's autobiography, the Bible and other sources, it is an affectionate and visually beautiful celebration of both the man and his art painted with what Andr Malraux termed ""the colours of love.""",1977-06-20T05:00:00+0000

As if the rough wasn't thick enough, the greens slick enough and the bunkers treacherous enough, now there is the hazard of a crank call warning that the tournament leader will be shot with a bullet from out of the woods while he's putting. That's the hazard that Hubert Green had to defy in winning the Open, and no matter how much he brushed it off later, he had to be thinking about it every time he crouched over a putt, Not that a touring pro would wear a bulletproof vest. It would restrict his putting stroke, to say nothing of his backswing. But from now on, golfers, like athletes in other sports who have had their lives threatened, might be the target of some crank who is betting on somebody else to win. Shake him up, Break his concentration. But perhaps Hubert Green proved what some golf people have suspectedthat making a short putt to win the Open is more serious than any crank call. And when he had won, Hubert Green didn't even flinch when he was asked if he felt he had survived rather than won.",1977-06-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Mon Affaire' Cheats on Laughs,"IF HALF A DOZEN LAUGHSsome of them solidspaced over nearly two hours were enough to qualify a film as outstanding comedy, ""Pardon Mon Affaire"" would merit designation as a hit. But as it stands, something on the order of half a dozen consecutive days of 90-degree temperatures and matching humidity plus a resolution of the Concorde dispute sufficient to touch off a wave of uncritical Francophilia will be necessary to blind audiences to the schizophrenic lopsidedness of this French movie, which opened yesterday at the Baronet.The work of Yves Robert, who directed ""The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe,"" ""Pardon Mon Affaire"" is basically a standard-issue French infidelity comedy  built around Jean Rochefort as Etienne, the bumbling middle-aged civil servant who takes one look at a model named Charlotte (Anny Ruperey) and decides the time has come to cheat on his wife, Marthe (Daniele Delorme).Having no previous experience at infidelity, Etienne manages to make an inadvertent assignation with his receptionist; to make an idiot of himself on horseback after he discovers the model likes to ride; to find himself in Brussels while the model is waiting for him in London; to lure her to what he believes is a vacant apartment only to discover that he has brought her to his own birthday party; and to wind up on television when he takes refuge from the model's husband on a Paris window ledge.It's thin stuff, but it has its amusing moments, including the pursuit of Etienne's wife by a student whose ardor is matched only by his utter humorlessness.What makes ""Pardon Mon Affaire"" a lopsided film is its concern with Etienne's friendsBouly, who cheats regularly on his wife and is devastated when she leaves him; Simon, the doctor who is henpecked by his mother, and Daniel, who turns out to be a homosexual.When they are simply adjuncts to the story of Etienne, they serve a useful purpose. But ""Pardon Mon Affaire"" seems to be trying to say something about the lives of these three other men and beyond that, about the friendship of all four. Unfortunately, it either lacks the time or the insight. Whatever the reason, the result is an unbalanced film, torn between the silly and the serious, doing total justice to neither.This film is rated PG (Parental Guidance Suggested"").

us,Film: 'New York' In a Tuneful Era,"ROBERT DE NIRO is an actor of too much furious intelligence and humor to be contained very long by the ritualized conceits of ""New York, New York,"" Martin Soorsese's elaborate, ponderous salute to Hollywood movies of the 1940's and early 50's in the form of a backstage musical of the period.Seeing Mr. De Niro as Jimmy Doyle, a talented, selfish, womanizing saxophonist, a variation on the sort of role that Tyrone Power played more than once, is to watch a man running to catch a train, only to pass right by it. The movie can't keep up with him.Nor, eventually, does it well serve Liza Minnelli as Francine Evans, the Helen Forrest-Kitty Kallenlike singer whose career, for a brief period of time, coincides with Jimmy Doyle's in the last years of the big-band era. Miss Minnelli doesn't outrun the film. With her apparently whole-hearted cooperation, the film uses her, especially toward the end when she's placed front-and-center to perform a series of evocations of her mother, Judy Garland, that are effectively eerie without being in the least bit moving.""New York, New York,"" which opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld, means to recall the lost sights and sounds of post-World War II movies with affection and wit. Indeed, the good will is immense in the early scenes that establish the characters of the saxophonist and the singer, who meet as cute as Tyrone Power and Alice Faye ever did, and who become a ""boy-girl"" act after she, a nonlooker, saves his first audition by singing with him.The big-band sounds are right, as are the sets and costumes and especially the movie conventions. ""New York, New York"" knowingly embraces a narrative line as formal and strict in its way as the shape of a sonnet. Even the sets are meant to look like back-lot sets, not the real world. When Jimmy and Francine walk down a New York street, it's that New York street so many of us grew up with, the one that abruptly terminates in a row of brownstones because, after all, there was only so much studio space.Yet, after one has appreciated the scholarship for about an hour or so, admiring Mr. De Niro's manic intensity and Miss Minnelli's way of desperately throwing out comic lines as if they were failed lassoesthings that are often funny in themselvesone begins to wonder what Mr. Scorsese and his writers, Earl Mac Rauch and Marik Martin, are up to.""New York, New York"" is not a parody,"" but the original genre is really not interesting enough to have had all of this attention to detail spent on it. It's not that the movie runs out of steam long before it has gone on for two hours and 33 minutes, but that we have figured it out and become increasingly dumbfounded. Why should a man of Mr. Scorsese's talent (""Mean Streets,"" ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."" ""Taxi Driver"") be giving us what amounts to no more than a film buff's essay on a pop-film form that was never, at any point in film history, of the first freshness?Even more disturbing is the movie's lack of feeling for the genuine feelings that those old movies were meant to inspire.Toward the end of the film, when Miss Minnelli is being photographed in such a way as to recall Miss Garland (in ""The Man Who Got Away"" number from ""A Star Is Born""), or being dressed in the black tights and mandarin jacket that her mother favored late in her career, it seems that nothing is sacred. That suspicion is confirmed by the film's title song, a new number written by John Kander and Fred Ebb that is not to be confused with the classic from ""On the Town,"" written by Leonard Bernstein with Betty Camden and Adolph Green.The three other new Kander and Ebb songs are not objectionable, and the dozen or so old songs are fine, including those sung by Miss Minnelli and one, ""Honeysuckle Rose,"" sung by Diahnne Abbott (Mrs. De Niro), in what appears to be a recollection of Billie Holiday. Mary Kay Place, one of the great attractions of ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,"" has some good moments as another band singer, and Lionel Stander and Lenny Gaines are among the more prominent supporting players.""New York, New York"" is not a disaster of the order of Peter Bogdanovich's ""At Long Last Love.""

us,"Film: 'High Street,' A Tour de Force:'Benji' Movie A Sequel","A CHILLING AND VOLATILE depiction of agony, profound rage, grief and madnessthe hideous legacy of Nazi inhumanity in Brussels during World War IIseizes the eye and wrenches the heart in ""High Street,"" a Beligian-French film that opened yesterday at Quad Cinema 3.A tour de force by the French actress Annie Cordy constitutes the visual and emotional centerpiece of this prize-winning film based on case histories of people who carry through life the ineradicable psychic wounds inflicted as an almost careless byproduct of the captivity and murder of six million Jews.Miss Cordy portrays Mimi, a deranged woman who attends more than operates a fish stand, who lives in a cruel yet understanding symbiotic relationship with a mysterious silent man, and who rails at her neighbors, the clergy and the tourist buses that stop near her pauper's flat in a lower-class section of Brussels called the Marolles.She is an embarrassment to the clergy, a scold to the churchgoers, an unexceptional case to medicine, an object of derision and abuse to some of her neighbors and a disquieting lunatic to the passengers aboard the tourist buses whose arrival ignites some of her most unsettling outbursts.To David Rheinhardt, an expatriate American artist who lives in an adjacent quarter of the city, this traumatized woman who calls his name is, at first, an inescapable aberration in the local landscape, then an irresistible riddle who propels his art from the abstract to the real as he seeks to fathom it.And finally, as he moves beyond art to an involvement in her life through pity and protection, he gains a measure of her trust. But there is no eradicating the wounds inflicted one night in 1943, when Gestapo agents and German troops seized David Blum, her Jewish husband, and left her with a dead child amid indifferent neighbors.In the climactic image of this haunting film, David Rheinhardt is seen venting his agony and rage against the windows of one of the tourist buses. They are not, of course, what the insane Mimi has perceived them to bevehicles that will someday bring David Blum home. He will never come home. They are metaphors of indifferenceof life perceived at a remove, in passing, by creatures whose anatomy qualifies them as people, but whose failure to rise up, to speak out in the face of vile outrage excludes them from the ranks of humanity.For all its power, ""High Street"" is not a movie without faults. Not all the performances are up to the standards set by Miss Cordy and Bert Struys, the mysterious man who cares for her. Secondary roles are sometimes amateurishly rendered. And in its will not merely to reach out to the emotions, but to seize them with barbed talons, the narrative is warped. The cause of Mimi's traumahinted at to the audience in brief, rapid flashbacks cut into her bouts of madnessis withheld from David Rheinhardt long beyond the time when reason tells us he would have learned the entire story.Nevertheless, ""High Street"" is an extraordinary movie, as shrill and emotional, perhaps, as its central character, and for the same good reason. It has something to say worth saying for as long as there is any danger that mankind may forget the awful sins of the past.",1977-06-23T05:00:00+0000

Eddie Stanky succeeded Frank Lucchesi, who succeeded Billy Martin, who now is in jeopardy as the New York Yankees' manager. But not many people know that three years ago Billy Martin, then the Rangers' manager, was thinking about moving upstairs into the Texas front office and hiring Frank Robinson as his successor in the dugout. Instead, the Cleveland Indians selected Frank Robinson as the major league's first black manager. Now the Indians have discharged Frank Robinson, one of the early black teenagers to be scouted after Jackie Robinson had broken baseball's racial barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers under Branch Rickey, who cherished Eddie Stanky for his intangibles as second baseman.

Though outraged by many of the past year's developmentsespecially the legalization of the Communist Partythe diehard Francoites in the military and elsewhere were deftly outmaneuvered and held at bay; the widely feared rightist coup was forestalled.",1977-06-23T05:00:00+0000
us,Film: Rameses vs. Priests In 'Pharaoh' From Poland,"""PHARAOH,"" Jerzy Kawalerowicz's Polish-made dramatization of an ancient struggle for power, which opened yesterday at the Thalia more than a dozen years after it was completed, is as much of an enigma as the Sphinx's smile, for its important issues remain simple, obvious and unresolved. The picture is a stately spectacle of evil men triumphing over good intentions with a Cecil B. DeMille-like cast of thousands in panoramic battles or demonstrations.Like such veterans as Andrezj Wajda and Aleksandr Ford, the 65-year-old Mr. Kawalerowicz, remembered for his 1962 mystical 17th-century drama ""Joan of the Angels?"" again illustrates his fascination with history in ""Pharaoh,"" which he helped adapt from a 19th-century Polish novel. In the film, he focuses on a young, handsome, socially conscious sovereign of an Egypt threatened by its neighbors and dominated by its covetous priests.Rameses' entanglements with his machinating priests, who refuse to relinquish their grip on the people or their secreted treasure, evolves as a series of largely orotund declamations that smack more of debate than drama. If further explanations seem needed for the film's abrupt passages, perhaps they can be attributed to the cutting of a lengthy work.Mr. Kawalerowicz's cameras, moving through authentic, picturesque locales in Luxor, Cairo and Bokhara in Uzbekistan, have captured the vivid colors of Egypt's mammoth temples, pyramids and statuary and the dun desert wastes on which those thousands of extras, lined up in military array, clash to the sounds of roaring voices, horns and drums.Despite the slowly measured pace of his early sequences, the director has elicited grimly sincere but occasionally emotional performances from some of his principals. George Zelnik, as the beleaguered heir to the throne and as the ill-fated Pharaoh, is confused, driven and torn by his desire for supremacy, by an inherent solicitude for his subjects and by the destructive cabals of his priests and foreign powers.Piotr Paulovski is moodily forbidding as the austere, conniving high priest Herhor, who is aided by, among others of his order, the oily, manipulative Stanislav Milski. And, Christine Mikolayevska, as the tragic Hebrew concubine and mother loved by Pharaoh, and Barbara Bryl, as the Assyrian priestess, who seduces him, are not only obviously decorative in near-nude portrayals but also fairly convincing in their involvements with him.Their ""Pharaoh,"" dubbed into English of varying accents is an impressive sweeping, if fairly familiar, picturization of a historical past, even if its humans and their conflicting causes are not fully realized.",1977-06-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Clanking 'Matatabi',"KON ICHIKAWA, one of Japan's top-flight and veteran directors known here principally for such contemporary subjects as the World War II ""Fires on the Plain"" and ""Tokyo Olympiad,"" is artistic but unclear in his period drama, ""Matatabi,"" which arrived yesterday as the final offering in the Regency Theater's Japanese film series. His saga of wandering gangs of the 1840's may shed light on a little-known facet of Nipponese history, but his script is as circuitous as his peripatetic principals.The existence, actions and, above all, strange ethical codes of these so-called ""toseinin,"" or errant, peasant swordsmen for hire, are made fairly clear with the aid of an off-screen narrator and English subtitles. And it is also evident that they are dependent on the local, petty 'bosses"" they protect, and on their laws, by which they live.The three young, unkempt peasant swordsmen in ""Matatabi"" adhere to the ritualistic demands of their code as they earn their keep by beating a rival gang of gamblers. But the going thereafter is as complicated as a maze.Moreover, these complications smack of contrivance as Genta, one of the ""toseinin,"" discovers that his father, who deserted the family for more exciting, profitable fields, is now planning to undermine Genta's gambler-boss. This leads not only to patricide, according to the code, but also to ostracism from the local gang. And, on and on, to the final decimation of the once cohesive trio into one aimless wanderer.The director makes an interesting point of stressing the power of a code that could bind such lower-class young men in loyalty to the death for a mere pittance of patronage. And, as in previous films, he has captured eye-catching scenes of picturesque beauty, as well as the prescribed, fairly constant vignettes of often gory action.He has also elicited tender sequences between Ichiro Ogura, as the driven Genta, and Reiko Inoue, as the young farm woman who leaves her husband for him. If Isao Bito and Kenichi Ogihara also display nuances of genuine emotion as members of his brotherhood, they are, in the main, wanderers through a complex series of foggy, seemingly unfinished adventures.",1977-06-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Vulnerable Work by Visconti,"THE VERSION of Luchino Visconti's ""Conversation Piece"" that opened yesterday at the D. W. Griffith Theater is virtually the same film I saw and reviewed when it was shown at the 1975 New York Film Festival. There is one difference. The festival film was in English, while the Griffith version is in Italian with English subtitles.One might be tempted to believe that the Italian language version is the original though, as it so often the case with Italian films with international casts, there really is no original version. At least some of the actors in each versionItalian, French or Englishare dubbed by other actors for the postsynchronized soundtrack.It is important to point this out because a number of observers tended to blame the mostly unfavorable critical reception to the film in 1975 on the fact that the festival showed it in English. Having just seen the Italian version, I stand by my original review, though the Italian dialogue, translated by subtitles, does have the effect of slightly distancing some of the screenplay's banalities. It is thus easier to see the film as an old man's musings, which are sad because they are so impotent, and because the film that contains them is so vulnerable.The following an excerpts from my original review, which appeared Sept. 27, 1975.""Conversation Piece"" is a disaster, the kind that prompts giggles from victims in the audience who, willingly, sit through it all feeling as if they were drowning in three inches of water.The film continues to explore concerns that occupied Mr. Visconti in both ""The Leopard"" and in his later, much less successful screen adaptation of ""Death in Venice."" The barbarians, the forces that represent social and political change and that acknowledge their physical passions, are attacking a citadel of the intellect, a place where reason has reigned at the cost of any possibility of love or commitment. It's one of Mr. Visconti's more dubious propositions that a person of taste and intelligence must always sleep alone in sterile splendor.In ""Conversation Piece"" the citadel is the handsome old Roman palazzo owned by the Professor (Burt Lancaster), an aging, American-born, Romanbred art historian who devotes his life to his books, his paintings by Old Masters, and his stereo recordings of Mozart. His life is turned upside down when his house is invaded by the real world as represented by a rich, pushy, overdressed marquesa, played by Silvana Mangano, the wife of a Fascist industrialist, her teen-age daughter (Claudia Marsani), her young German lover (Helmut Berger) and her daughter's lover (Stefano Patrizi).The members of this rampaging horde of four are supposedly so vital and so fascinating that they are able to persuade the Professor to lease to them his upstairs apartment for a year, though to anyone watching the movie they seem less interesting than a group of ordinary, run-of-the-play dress extras. Part of it has to do with what they say and the way we hear it.The screenplay is by Mr. Visconti and his longtime associates, Suso Cecchi D'Amico and Enrico Medioli and is said to be based on ""an idea"" by Mr. Medioli, which may well have once been a one-set play, the kind that has carefully timed entrances and exits and makes frequent use of the telephone to pass on information to us, if not people offscreen.""Conversation Piece"" is a movie made up of one part chitchat (""May I use your telephone?), one part unwanted confessions (""I threw myself into the student movementdeeper than most"") and one part lumpy aphorisms (""The way of progress is destruction"").As in bad plays, everyone always means exactly what he says and never has to think a second before saying it. There is no feeling for the complexity of the mental processes, for the mysterious ways in which the mind works. This, of course, wouldn't be bad if these people had the wit and insight of George Bernard Shaw characters, but they don't.As the invaders ultimately destroy the old professor, they also are the undoing of the German gigolo who, we are asked to believe, was once politically committed until ravaged by the bourgeoisie. Possibly some other actor could have handled this part, but Mr. Berger (who played the title role in Mr. Visconti's ""Ludwig"") is such a lightweight he can function no more than as an ideogram for decadence.Miss Mangano is grotesque in a grotesque role, while Miss Marsani, as her daughter, acts as if she'd seen too many ""Gidget"" movies.Mr. Lancaster, fine old professional that he is, is awful, adopting that humble, ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" manner he uses when employed in what he apparently thinks is serious movie-making. ""Conversation Piece"" is the kind of fatuous film that the professionally pragmatic Burt Lancaster, the action movie hero, would snort at and leave in the middle of.",1977-06-24T05:00:00+0000

Of course, things could be worse: Consider, for example, the fact that this Thursday one of CBS's old warhorse soaps, The Guiding Light, celebrates its 25th anniversary on television. Add to that quarter century the 15 years the program spent on radio before moving to television and we're talking about marathon run of 90 years. Thus, by comparison with the longtime devotees of The Guiding Light, my fouryear romance with The Young and the Restless is a mere soap bubble amid the galaxy of suds.

I wrapped a thick wool blanket about my shoulders and went to a turret window where once, they say, Richard the LionHearted had stood. Presumably his view was the same as minefields stretching forever outside the castle, fields as green and as rich as emeralds. Here, the armies of Protestants and Catholics once fought violently, but on this day nothing but a strong chestnut horse and an impudent little donkey grazed and nuzzled symbiotically. In the moat, swans glided through mossy shadows. Old women clattered across cobblestone streets no wider than goat cart, hurrying home with net shopping bags filled with immense artichokes, wedges of camembert, liters of wine.

Reggie regarded the ball with distaste. It would not have been easy to catch it, and Reggie played it safe, letting it drop in front of him for a single. In the crowd 55,039, one of the biggest in the American League this year, were some of Reggie's best friends and severest critics. They said, Boo! On the bench was Billy Martin, one of Reggie's best friends and severest critics. He said nothing audible outside the dugout, did nothing visible from the stands. In Boston last week Reggie's languid approach to a single enabled Rice to stretch the hit to a double, and the Yankees' practically peerless leader sprang from the dugout, removed Jackson from the game in full view of network television, and when Reggie demurred the manager endeavored to slug him. Since then Martin came this close to becoming the Yankees' former leader but had a hearttoheart with George Steinbrenner, the club's principal owner, whereupon peace and concord settled upon the best team money can buy.",1977-06-27T05:00:00+0000

us,'Empire of the Ants' A Snail's-Pace Film,"BERT I. GORDON seems to be fascinated by the Animal Kingdom. Last year he conjured up a menagerie of mammoth voracious rats, chickens and bees for ""Food of the Gods,"" a film inspired by an H. G. Wells story. Now Mr. Gordon has come up with a man-hungry colony of giant insects in ""Empire of the Ants,"" also derived from a work by H. G. Wells. The movie swarmed into local theaters yesterday; unfortunately, the insects and the people in this mlange of ersatz science-fiction and dull adventure deserve one another.There are some ""15,000 different species of ants,"" an off-screen narrator tells us, whose industry and intelligence are astounding. But these king-sized insects don't appear to get much competition, intellectual or otherwise, from the covey of humans who figure in this picture. The humans are a group of prospeceive buyers conned to undeveloped acres apparently in the vicinity of the Everglades, where some of the film was shot.In any case, salesmanship soon gives way to special effects as the ants, keening and racketing like helicopters, start stalking and decimating the group as the humans try to escape via a river and the swampy, jungle-like terrain. If credulity isn't strained at this point, it certainly is when the humans finally make it to a village and sugar refinery controlled by, you guessed it, sugar-loving ants.As a laconic charter boat skipper, Robert Lansing seems to be more level-headed than the rest as he leads this largely ill-fated party out of a frightening mess. But the human's fright is seen as play acting, and the account of their progress over a gory trail is slow and repetitive. And, aside from some multifaceted ant's-eye views of humans, the special effects are artificial and unexciting.This ""Empire of the Ants,"" as Albert Salmi, in the small role of the village sheriff, puts it, is ""hard to believe.""This film is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") probably for its occasional bloody scenes and its ant attacks, but these simulated terrors are not likely to shock viewers past the age of, say, 10.",1977-06-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Egos Beset Chekhov's 'Sisters',"THE THALIA THEATER, under its new management, has been maintaining one of the most original, unusual and, sometimes, odd programming policies of any theater in New York. In recent months they've allowed us to see a filmed recording of Laurence Olivier's extraordinary Chichester Festival production of ""Uncle Vanya,"" Josef von Sternberg's last film, ""Anatahan,"" and the huge Polish epic called ""Pharaoh.""When you drop into the Thalia, the chances are you'll find something out-of-the-ordinary, a film that isn't likely to turn up in any cricuit house. It might not be great or even good, but it will be rare.Such is the Thalia's newest program, which opened yesterday. It's the 1965 videotape version, transferred to film, of the Actors Studio Theater production of Chekhov's ""The Three Sisters"" as it was staged by Lee Strasberg. The production was originally done in 1964 in New York, where it received more or less mixed notices, and later went to London, where theater people behaved as if we'd sent them a red-white-and-blue stinkbomb.As it looks now, we had.Yet it's a fascinating footnote to the history of the New York theater and, especially, of the Actors Studio. This production is virtually bulging with the self-assurance of an organization that thought it could do anything if everyone, just sweated and fretted long enough. Never have I seen a ""Three Sisters"" half as long, nor four actresseswho play the three sisters and their sister-in-lawwho seem less likely to become victims of anything except a natural disaster on the order of a majormagnitude nine on the Richter scaleearthquake.The cast includes some fine performers, as well as some not-so-fine, but what wrecks the production is the aggressive tone, for which, I assume, Mr. Strasberg was responsible. Everything is too literal, too calculated, too coarse, too busyeven the pauses rattle the screen. The accents don't match, some are out of Topeka, Kan., some out of Broadway and some out of the Yiddish theater. It's less a production than a convention of actors on fire for what they think is a good cause.Two performers who come close to achieving some kind of unity of style and feeling are Kim Stanley as Masha, the middle sister, and Kevin McCarthy as Vershinin, the unhappily married army officer who, briefly, lights up the lives of the sisters in the dreary Russian provincial city where they are forever marooned.Geraldine Page, one of the best actresses we have, seems misdirected as the oldest sister, Olga. Sandy Dennis as Irina, the youngest, acts as if she were afraid her upper teeth were going to pop out. The recurring gesture of a hand reaching up to the mouth evokes not emotional desperation but severe orthodontic panic.Shelley Winters, as the arriviste sister-in-law, Natalya, who methodically dispossesses the sisters, is out of control from start to finish. She's as pushy as a waitress in a hamburger joint who wants to get the customers out by closing time. James Olson has some decently theatrical moments as Baron Tuzenbach, Irina's suitor. No one else need by mentioned by name.The film quality is not at all bad considering the videotape origins, but Paul Bogart, who directed the taping, favors too many close-ups that have the effect of isolating actors when they are, in fact, part of an ensemble. It is, however, a fitting metaphor for a production in which each actor seems so occupied with his own performance that he's incapable of communicating with someone no more than a foot or two away.",1977-06-30T05:00:00+0000
