The book starts with salads, mostly as the center of the plate, and then goes on to simple pastas like one with canned tuna, capers and tiny tomatoes. There are sections on eggs, chicken, fish, various meats (beef dishes are mostly steaks) and desserts. To keep the ingredient count to five, Mr. Oliver bakes with self-rising flour and premade puff pastry and relies on prepared Asian condiments and sauces. With coconut milk and curry paste, youre on your way to soup.

The dish for which Mr. Arellano, 24, is best known at his compact market stall is braised beef noodle soup, a Taiwanese specialty. It comes in a deep bowl filled with slices of beef, bok choy, pickled cabbage and his hand-pulled noodles, an art that he has managed to perfect.

Though rumors of Harris gearing up for a presidential run in 2020 are becoming noisier by the minute (when Stephen Colbert asked her on Thursday if she would run, Harris coyly said, I might), she told me the memoir is not meant to help lay the groundwork for such a campaign. At the expense of sounding immodest, she said, the book is really about the work Ive done already thats had national impact, and what I hope to come from it.

The dramatic volcano would have been an obvious choice of subject for Gall, whose work has focused on nature  from formal gardens to underground caves  for more than three decades. But there, in the ancient city of Syracuse, a surprising fascination emerged: As I walked through all the narrow streets, she says, my gaze was drawn upward to a swirl of moving color, which turned out to be laundry hung out to dry from balconies. Over the next two years, Gall traveled to seaside cities in Italy, Cuba and Croatia, capturing the movement and forms of hanging laundry and, later, kites. Inspired by the nonrepresentational paintings of Kandinsky and Mir, she pared away all but the essential details, developing abstract compositions against clear blue skies. The resulting series  now on view at Julie Saul Gallery in New York City  is transformative: In image after image, whirling, wind-tossed dish towels, dresses and denim conjure the shapes and colors of blooming poppies and flocks of birds.

Small talk was made and pleasantries exchanged, but I couldnt help noticing that there was not much eye contact. At first I attributed this to normal self-consciousness, but as the day progressed it occurred to me that it might be a kind of honesty: He wouldnt do me or himself the disrespect of offering a charm performance. He simply said it was nice to meet me and suggested we get a bite at a nearby Cuban restaurant. Once there, he looked over the menu for not long at all before ordering the eggplant steak and then, as if on impulse, an empanada de guayaba and a cafe con leche. He would drink the coffee but would have the empanada boxed up to share, he said, with his students.",2019-01-15T10:00:03+0000

What was Salvation Taco is now under the management of Alex Stupak of Empelln, Taqueria and Al Pastor. (Mr. Stupak took over Salvation Taco last year after April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman, who ran the restaurant, left amid a sexual harassment scandal over Mr. Friedmans treatment of employees.) Though Mr. Stupak has a casual Al Pastor taqueria in the East Village, he says this latest restaurant is not merely a spinoff. Its an evolution, he said. Its bar food inspired by Mexico and also by fun lowbrow American food like corn dogs. Theres also waiter service here. Mr. Stupak said that he had resisted offers to turn Al Pastor into a fast-casual place in airports and food halls, and that he felt this project suited him better. The sprawling space, designed by Glen Coben in conjunction with Mr. Stupak, has a long bar, high-top tables and a pub atmosphere, with dark green walls, vintage photos and tufted leather in one area, with another bar and a game room beyond. Its now less fiesta and more tavern, Mr. Stupak said. The menu will feature tacos, as well as fried-chicken sandwiches, broiled oysters with hoja santa and bacon, Chihuahua cheese sticks, pork fried rice and crunchy corn masa ice cream bars.

We have to radically reorient ourselves and start talking about rehabilitation, restoration and how we end crime. And if we do that, were going to come to very different choices than weve come to in this era of overincarceration, where the response to everything is punishment.",2019-01-16T10:00:01+0000

Founded in the early 16th century, it served as Guatemalas capital for almost 300 years, until 1773, when it was abandoned by crown officials following a series of devastating volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and floods. In the mid-1800s, agriculturists took note of Antiguas rich volcanic soils, and the city thrived once again, as a center of coffee and grain production. It was during this period that its canary-colored Santa Catalina Arch, built in 1694 as a walkway for nuns, received its domed clock tower, becoming Antiguas most iconic monument. In 1979, Unesco designated Antigua a World Heritage Site, ensuring the protection of its architectural and cultural legacy.",2019-01-21T10:00:07+0000

The hike, through a broad valley in the Eastern Highlands called Glen Derry, carried me past groves of Scots pines and over a series of streams, some of which, lined with slick steppingstones, made for precarious crossings. All the while, two rows of smooth, eroded mountain peaks enclosed me in an amphitheater of muted colors: hazel-hued heather, golden grasses.

Remarkably, Athill didnt use the pages to complain, an instinct that would have been easy to understand, but instead to sing the praises of the written word and the people who make it their mission to tell stories. What she less overtly advertised, though, was her fiercely independent life. Athill died last week at the age of 101, and her words, at several critical points in this readers life, provided a lifeline. Perhaps her greatest legacy was her refusal to cede to societal expectations as she carved out a persistently unusual world for herself in which the demands of femininity  marriage and children, specifically  were rethought and redefined.",2019-01-29T14:54:25+0000

But it also means something more poignant: the end of your characters journey. (At least until the shows reboot.) While television characters are immortal in a way  living on even after the show is done  when the story reaches its conclusion, so, too, does the time an actor has spent getting to know the characters in that world.

On Jan. 27, 2017, less than a week after The Salesman, Farhadis seventh feature film, was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language movie, President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, more commonly known as the Muslim ban. Under its terms, citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Iran among them, were barred from entering the United States for 90 days  apparently the time it would take the new president to figure out what the hell is going on. For Farhadi, a connoisseur of human particularity whose nuanced, open-ended films about the cultural fault lines within Iran have been embraced by audiences around the world, Trumps order was an offense both moral and intellectual. In a statement released two days later, he announced his decision to boycott the Oscars and also alluded to the history of reciprocal humiliation that lay behind present-day American-Iranian hostilities. Given the circumstances (the collective punishment of an entire religious group), that reciprocal showed extraordinary equanimity  not that anyone who had seen the film for which Farhadi was nominated, a painstaking psychological inquest into the rival claims of reciprocally humiliated parties, would have been surprised.",2019-01-31T10:00:02+0000

Early in January, she announced to her 830,000 followers that she would be holding a series of four-hour, $165 seminars in several American cities, a chance for fans to meet Calloway and imbibe some of her wisdom on true creative fulfillment. What followed was a fiasco: Early seminars failed to deliver promised amenities, and Calloway turned out to have sold tickets to some events without having located venues for them. A muckraking Twitter thread materialized, scorning Calloway as a scammer; she promptly canceled and then uncanceled the tour, all while zapping out flurries of alternately self-flagellating and self-justifying posts on Instagram Stories.",2019-01-31T10:00:03+0000

Amid all the dazzle and dizzying prices though, the towns roots endure: Swiss, snowbound and sports-obsessed. Tourist life remains old-fashioned, revolving around the ski lodges and the storied Kulm, the slope-side Suvretta and the buzz-filled Badrutts Palace, the grand hotels where heavy Alpine furniture never goes out of style; piano players still serenade the lounge-dwellers and old- and new-moneyed denizens alike sip champagne under dim chandeliers.",2019-01-31T10:00:14+0000
