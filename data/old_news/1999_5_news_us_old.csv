Through this program, Hofstra students and faculty travel to the Roosevelt Study Center in Middleburg in The Netherlands every summer. Mr. deVries had been instrumental in arranging loans of Dutch art to the Hofstra Museum and in creating a hybrid tulip named for the University.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  THURSTON, BENJAMIN EASTON, COLONEL","THURSTON - Benjamin Easton, Colonel. September 13, 1903-April 14, 1999, Seattle, WA. Col. Thurston was born in Minneapolis, the only son and first born of James Siddall and Mary Winston Thurston. His mother crusaded for child labor laws and was an opium addict, and the children raised themselves. Ben won an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY, class of 1926, for which he was class historian until his death. Following remote postings of the small peace-time Army of the 1930's, he instructed in English, history, mathematics and chess at West Point. He was stationed at Schofield Barracks at the time of the Japanese attack in December 1941. From 1942-44 he and his family lived in numerous Army bases training newly recruited troops. In 1944 he was appointed battalion commander of the 376th regiment of the 94th division. His battalion was in the European campaign in Patton's army and fought through the Brittany peninsula. They were near Dijon, where the two allied forces joined-those fighting toward the east from Normandy, and those of the FrenchAmerican forces fighting up the Rhone river. They were heavily involved in the Battle of the Bulge, fought through the Alsace campaign, and were among the earliest units of forced crossings of the Saar and Rhine rivers. He was wounded in combat three times. He received three Purple Hearts, three Bronze Stars, the Silver Star, and French Legion of Honor. In 1947 he joined the army of occupation in Europe, serving 4 years in Hoechst, Frankfurt, Berlin and Heidelberg. His duties included organizing defenses for Berlin during the airlift. Col. Thurston, fluent in French, was appointed senior American military advisor during the development of NATO in 194950, working with General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, who was then and during the war the Commander in Chief of the French Army. In 1955, after the development of mutually adversarial relations between him and the Army, Col. Thurston retired. In the 1970's he wrote his wartime experiences from a notebook he secretly kept during WWII, describing techniques used by this frontline midlevel commander to meet the needs of combat situations, such as preventing frozen feet and counting personnel after a messy night time skirmish, Ugly Duckling, 3rd Battalion, 376th Infantry Regiment, WWII, Europe. Ben married Elizabeth Gay Baxter, also of Minneapolis, in 1933. The marriage was happy and they jointly endured the rigors of military life. However, long separations, the trauma of wartime life, and frequent relocation had their effects and in 1959 the marriage was dissolved-surely also a casualty of the war. Following retirement, Ben participated in numerous endeavors, including grade school and high school teaching and uranium prospecting. Traumatic stress disorder, controlled but always present since the war, was a problem which he faced courageously. Chess was a life-long pursuit at which he achieved national rank and was Arizona Grand Champion. Following his divorce, Ben showed typical resolve in recovering his marital status. A considerable number of shortlived marriages were contracted, found unsuitable, and annulled. In 1963 he married Hazel Turman and made a truly loving life with her until her death. His loving children are Dr. Laura Thurston Gutman, Benjamin Easton Thurston, Robb Olmstead Thurston, Eleanor Turman Williams, Ralph Turman and, recently deceased, Jerry Turman. Grandchildren are Paula Gutman, Catherine Gutman, Laura Thurston Newberry, Stephen Thurston, Michael Thurston, Cindy Williams Knotts, Chris Turman, Linda Turman and (deceased) Susan Turman. A spirit of humility and service informed all aspects of his life and in every situation he sought to think of those least able to assert themselves. An example: his will stipulated that the gravediggers should have a fine meal and drink following his burial. He was an avid scholar, collecting wonderful quotations in English, French and Latin, and used them with great wit and skill. Truly he was a great man.",1999-05-02T05:00:00+0000

The many styles of over-the-shoulder contour bags (far left) are an alternative to the backpack, with the box shape most popular. Its three-inch-wide strap has multiple pockets and closes in front with industrial Velcro, so the bag never has to go over the head. Saddlebags with a tie belt (below) are gracing young bodies as well. Also seen around town is the apron bag (right), a Canal Street find for under $20.

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Put On Your Fireflies, We're Going Out!","Barry Yourgrau's sinuous, laconic fictions defy routine description. Reviewers find themselves resorting to imaginary amalgams -- two parts Borges, one part Kafka, a dollop of Andre Breton -- in trying to describe the snapshot-quick, surrealist prose doodlings that Yourgrau, the author of ''The Sadness of Sex,'' specializes in. In HAUNTED TRAVELLER: An Imaginary Memoir (Arcade, $23.95), his fourth book, Yourgrau presents us with 44 episodes that relate one man's wanderings through moody, fantastical landscapes -- a weird and airy travelogue, springing from the narrator's possession by what Baudelaire called the ''horror of home.'' Yourgrau's narrator takes us to flower-strewn islands where women wear mantles of drugged fireflies, to a lofty kingdom presided over by a chief who wears a ''turban of dyed cobwebs'' and aboard tramp freighters crewed by gorgeous but reticent cross-dressing women. As the narrator (who fancies himself a sort of nomadic po te maudit) confesses, ''I might traverse a whole world, pacing from one wall of my room to the other.'' In one dispatch, ''Map,'' he asks a barefoot woman where he might find the X on his map, and she responds by asking where he thinks it is. '' 'Why, somewhere over there,' I tell her, pointing. She nods at this, with the show of a strange, unamused smile. 'Yes,' she says. 'Tonight. That is where it is. But last night. . . .' She raises a worn hand, and indicates an entirely different direction.'' Ultimately, Yourgrau's vignettes add up to a strangely sublime collection that speaks less to travel than it does to alienation -- and to the restless yearnings of the human heart.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; To Be Appreciated Someday,"That an incredible trove of paintings by Vincent van Gogh has survived intact since his suicide more than 100 years ago is truly a family affair. ''Its very existence is cause for wonder,'' according to one of van Gogh's grandnephews, ''for it was utterly worthless when it was created.'' Seventy of these paintings are the subjects of VAN GOGH'S VAN GOGHS: Masterpieces From the Van Gogh Museum Amsterdam (National Gallery of Art, Washington/Abrams, $37.50). Richard Kendall's graceful essay walks the reader through van Gogh's surprisingly ordinary life as a little-known artist who ultimately made extraordinary paintings, and also his tender relationship with his brother Theo, who worked for Paris art dealers and always supported Vincent financially and emotionally. John Leighton, director of the Van Gogh Museum, gives a fascinating account of the provenance of these paintings, which Vincent gave to Theo over the years and which, following Theo's own sudden death six months after Vincent's, went to Theo's wife, Johanna, and their infant son, Vincent Willem, who eventually established the museum. Johanna made it her life's work to promote van Gogh's paintings, generating interest in part by publishing volumes of the brothers' correspondence. Leighton astutely comments that the melodrama of the van Gogh legend originated here, with Johanna's sentimentality about her dead husband and his belief in his brother. And it is impossible to read fragments from the letters (laced throughout Kendall's essay) without the knowing wink of hindsight. When Vincent moves from Paris to Provence he writes to Theo, ''I am getting an eye for this kind of country.'' Indeed, Provence was where he unleashed his approach to color and composition, creating his most fiercely original and famous works. In another letter Theo notes, after receiving a shipment of paintings, ''They have something so striking and so near the truth . . . they will undoubtedly be appreciated someday.'' Hilarie M.

Dobard present the fascinating theory that slaves created quilts coded with patterns to help one another flee to freedom. Though Quakers and other congregations, black fraternal organizations and American Indians helped slaves to escape, Tobin and Dobard state that ''far from being passive victims waiting to be rescued, enslaved blacks never ceased in their struggle for freedom.'' What seemed to be their simple quilting was much more: ''Since it was the law that slaves were not allowed to be taught to read or write, other methods were needed to insure successful efforts for escape.'' Quilts were set out in windows or on fences in front of slave cabins to signal trustworthy slaves to take particular actions. Despite its clunky academic writing and the lack of a much-needed index, ''Hidden in Plain View'' is mesmerizing. In 1994 in the Old Marketplace of Charleston, S.C., Tobin met an elderly black quilter, Ozella McDaniel Williams, who alluded to the role of quilts in the underground railroad to freedom. Tobin, who teaches women's studies at the University of Denver, and Dobard, a quilter and art history professor at Howard University, devoted themselves to cracking the code of the quilts. The Underground Railroad Quilt Code, they write, comprises 10 patterns. The Monkey Wrench pattern quilt, for instance, told slaves to begin their escape preparations by collecting tools for their journey; the Tumbling Boxes pattern indicated that it was time for ''packing up and moving on.'' Five square knots indicated distance and invoked the protection of God and the ancestors, something the slaves needed most of all. Andrea Higbie",1999-05-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; The Freelancer,"By the time he was 28, Anton Chekhov had published more than 500 short works of fiction, about half of them comic stories and farces. This apprentice writing, dashed off while he was ''chasing two hares at once'' -- his medical career and his modest literary pursuits -- has usually been regarded as negligible stuff, cut to the requirements of Moscow's popular magazines, which paid the young writer a few kopecks a line. Harvey Pitcher endeavors to correct this judgment in the 40 stories he has translated and assembled in CHEKHOV: The Comic Stories (Ivan R. Dee, $26). While a few of the earliest pieces are little more than sketches, most of these tales offer far greater pleasures, among them penetrating social satire and trenchant character analysis. In one, for example, a man of supposed high ideals rents a country house from a captivating young female, whose charms delight him until he is presented with a bill for the extras he took for granted during his long stay. In another, a lowly civil servant, kept awake at night by worries about how to use an exclamation mark, realizes that in 40 years of writing documents he ''couldn't remember a single line expressing delight, indignation or anything of that kind.'' In story after story, Chekhov displays techniques -- especially the use of a few telling details to suggest a whole -- that he would later employ to stunning effect. ''Everything I've written to date is nonsense,'' Chekhov wrote in 1888. This collection reveals how delicious such ''nonsense'' could be. Philip Gambone",1999-05-09T05:00:00+0000

The Renault Winery, besides encompassing 32 acres of vineyards and a restaurant, also houses a wineglass museum, with about 500 glasses. The oldest glass is Italian, from the 13th century, says Joseph Milza, owner of Renault. The rarest is a handpainted wineglass made for a single dinner in 17th-century France. And the most striking are nine French flutes from 1894, called Eiffel tower glasses. About 16 inches tall, they were probably made for drinking Champagne, he said, appropriate because one of Renault's specialties is blueberry champagne. The glasses can be viewed in cases in a couple of rooms that are the assembly point for vineyard tours, $2 a person, which are offered daily from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. (and from 11 on Sundays). The winery also serves lunch daily and a wine-tasting dinner Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Renault Winery, 72 North Bremen Avenue, in Galloway; (609) 965-2111.",1999-05-09T05:00:00+0000

At Baladi, the new, and only, Egyptian restaurant in Montclair, Nancy, the blond belly dancer (from Manhattan not Egypt), can be counted on to dazzle on Friday and Saturday nights. Our son Miles, who is 5, was enchanted with Nancy, but not enchanted enough, apparently, to accept her invitation to dance. His 13-year-old brother, Paul, felt likewise. As no one else was invited to join her, we were free to concentrate on the swords that replace the chandelier and that she used to slash the air and, luckily, nothing and nobody else. All this and hummus too. ''My heart is in Egypt,'' says Neamet el-Sayed, 41, the owner and chef, who was born in Cairo and now lives in Hoboken. Baladi (pronounced balla-DEE) is Arabic for ''countryside,'' which Mr. El-Sayed approximates most glamorously. Under filmy dark blue tents, diners are served traditionally lamb-based Egyptian meals, among them mozza dani, apricot-braised lamb shank. For those who prefer their little lambs scampering safely with Mary, Baladi offers such entrees as samek bofteak (pistachio-crusted catfish with dried limes, baby okra and tahini) and vegetable tajine (sauteed artichokes, zucchini, butternut squash, chickpeas and potatoes with juniper essence and saffron couscous with dried cherries). Hummus (chicpea puree with tahini, lemon juice and garlic), baba gannouj (charred eggplant puree) and kebda (pan-seared calves' liver with pickled vegetables), all served with hot puffy pita triangles, are little meals masquerading as appetizers. Our dessert, konafa - dense Belgian chocolate topped and bottomed with crispy shredded phyllo - was as mesmerizing as Nancy's shimmies and shakes.

Three Lichtensteins shout from the entry. Upstairs, in the master bedroom, a red Rothko glows next to a glowering black-and-white Kline. There's art everywhere -- masterworks hung within inches of other masterworks. It's impressive, beautiful and telling. Ovitz loves his collection, but it is also a tool with which to dazzle, to impress. When a prospective employee, a young, talented Hollywood agent with a solid client list, asked Ovitz recently why he should come to work for him, Ovitz replied, ''Because I have a Picasso and you don't.'' Perhaps he was joking but probably he was not. ''Perception,'' Ovitz will say, again and again, ''is everything.'' So while he treasures his Picasso and likes to tell stories about how his white-on-white Rymans compelled Sean Connery to back the play ''Art,'' Ovitz's paintings are also meant to be advertisements.

us,"Now Playing in Los Angeles: 'Have Warehouse, Will Remodel'","With fast growth and turnover among young creative companies in new media, animation and advertising, there is a surge in warehouse remodeling in Los Angeles. Competition to top one another is high. See-and-be-seen is the theme at the new Marina del Rey home of Ground Zero, a five-year-old advertising agency, featuring glass-topped desks and a processional ramp that leads through an open, converted warehouse to a reception desk at the back. ''Having to walk through the entire space before you get to the beginning reflects our approach -- to peel away the outer layers of a brand to get to its soul,'' said Kirk Souder, a Ground Zero partner. Shubin & Donaldson Architects turned the building, a former sound stage, into an industrial-chic space with a bow-truss ceiling and meeting rooms (left) partitioned by ribbed plastic and steel walls. The ramp (below) begins in the parking lot and leads up the side into the second level before dropping. Ground Zero is a raw, more democratic (no one has his or her own office) variant of the TBWA/ Chiat/Day offices in Playa del Rey, also a village within a warehouse.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Moonstruck,"Struck by love, Norris Lamb, a middle-aged postmaster in a small English village, embodies Eudora Welty's observation that ''a sheltered life can be a daring life as well. For all serious daring starts from within.'' In Carrie Brown's unconventional and eloquent novel LAMB IN LOVE (Algonquin, $21.95), Norris -- who ''knows he is a victim of a delicious assault, a caress from a lion's paw'' -- sets out to win Vida Stephen after he comes upon her ''dancing in the moonlight in a ruined garden'' on the night of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Vida, who is 41 and plain, is dedicated to caring for Manford Perry, a 20-year-old retarded man who is unable to speak, in the mansion owned by his peripatetic father. Norris is too shy to declare himself directly, so he engages in an unusual courtship whose resolution hangs suspensefully in the balance until the very end. Along the way, he is surprised by his growing affection for Manford, whom he begins to see as Vida sees him: not damaged, but uniquely engaged with his world. ''Lamb in Love'' is, in fact, a book about seeing. Carrie Brown reveals her characters not as others perceive them but as they are able to see one another, and as they come to understand themselves. Norris and Vida are full of depth and longing, passion and poetry, that continually startle and delight. ''You have to have imagination to love anybody,'' Vita concludes, as you do to write a novel as magical and satisfying as Brown's. Linda Barrett Osborne",1999-05-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Art for Religion's Sake,"While the enormous talents of the folk artist Edward Hicks (1780-1849) are often celebrated, it was his mission as a religious servant that inspired his illustrious allegorical series of paintings, ''The Peaceable Kingdom.'' In THE KINGDOMS OF EDWARD HICKS (Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center/Colonial Williamsburg Foundation/Abrams, $39.95), Carolyn J. Weekley, director of museums at Colonial Williamsburg, deftly chronicles Hicks's early training as a decorative painter, his journey into the Quaker world and his lifelong struggle to reconcile his spiritual beliefs with his material needs. Hicks's mother died when he was a toddler. Unable to support the child, his father sent him to live with family friends who raised him as a Quaker. As a teen-ager Hicks was apprenticed to a local stagecoach shop to learn decorative painting. He became a Quaker minister in 1811. He received no pay for this position and supported his family with his decorative painting, a practice that stood in direct contradiction to the utilitarian views of the Quakers. Increasingly Hicks's views diverged from those of the Quakers, and under the guidance of his cousin Elias Hicks, a Hicksite faction was formed. There was much animosity between the Hicksites and the orthodox Quakers, which had an irrevocable effect on Hicks. His many versions of the ''Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings symbolically reflect the urgency of that discord as well as his desire for peace between the two divisions. Using Isaiah's prophecy ''The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb . . .'' as a blueprint, Hicks's paintings, in varying degrees, mirror his personal agony about religious tension. Weekley has compiled a scholarly history of Hicks as both minister and painter, and of the turmoil these conflicting vocations wrought on his own kingdom. Amy Todd",1999-05-16T05:00:00+0000

Appetizers should be smallish, a mere tweak of the taste buds (though it would also be appropriate to have lower prices, to match the smaller portions). Duck foie gras (barely cooked, tremblingly soft) was nonpareil, adorned with lentil salad, onion, arugula and other lightly dressed greens. Almost as enchanting was a savory tart (with excellent thin crust) layered with wild mushrooms and rampions in a luscious Gruyere cream sauce.

us,"No Starch, Please","If women can iron the kinks from their hair and creases from their clothes, why not wrinkles from their skin? At the Miano-Viel Salon, 14 East 52d Street, a facial technique introduced last month by Alla Katkov, a Russian woman with smooth, poreless skin, requires a tiny iron used with some force. Unlike some facials that leave skin red and blotchy, the Rejuvenating Facial Iron is meant to offer immediate, if temporary, smoothness -- good for a last-minute glow before going out. Ms. Katkov begins the treatment with a shoulder massage and minty-smelling masks. Before you can say ''weird science,'' she straps sheets of sheer plastic across the face and neck, turns off the lights, and rolls a tiny warm phosphorescent plastic iron up and down, from upper chest to forehead, causing a sparking sensation on the skin. ''This is the holo-electron neon iron,'' she says, and its electric impulses remove lines. It sounds like hokum -- and indeed it may be the mask's hydrating effect that eliminates lines -- but when she strips off the plastic the face resembles that of a well-rested 8-year-old.

It also includes cultural centers and events, jazz clubs and jazz and blues festivals and short biographies.

If you call the first ''Star Wars'' film ''Episode IV,'' you enclose the audience, as Horace understood, in an already onrushing vehicle.

In life, Elvis Presley was the king of contradictions: svelte and bloated; druggie and Nixon admirer; rebel and mama's boy; and, as Erika Doss, a professor of fine arts at the University of Colorado, Boulder, suggests in ELVIS CULTURE: Fans, Faith, and Image (University Press of Kansas, $24.95), a visual as well as an aural icon. Post-mortem, Presley seems omnipresent: Graceland, his home in Memphis, is the second most visited American residence after the White House; at last tally there were 525 official Presley fan clubs in 44 countries (contrasted to only 65 at the time of his death, in 1977), including the Snorkeling Elvises out of Key West, Fla., and there may be as many as 20,000 Elvis impersonators, or ''Elvii,'' as they are known. Doss interviews the most avid collectors of Elvis detritus, like Paul MacLeod of Holly Springs, Miss., who curates a museum of 10 million Presley items, and Kim Epperly, who maintains a dollhouse-sized ''Miniature Graceland.'' With images ranging from velvet Elvises to graveside offerings, the book itself is a remarkable Presley artifact. However, Doss presents a muddled tautology that the meaning of Presley's ''multivalent'' image is ultimately what we read into it. By focusing on Presley's face almost to the exclusion of his voice, she sidesteps how the dead legend speaks most directly to his legions of fans. Eric P. Nash",1999-05-23T05:00:00+0000

In Kate Christensen's breezy and confident first novel, IN THE DRINK (Doubleday, $22.95), Claudia -- who is now Swarthmore educated, living in Manhattan and on the verge of turning 30 -- still has some work to do in the superego department. Barely able to afford her studio apartment on her salary as a ghostwriter for a Park Avenue socialite-novelist, Claudia still can't control her spending sprees at Bloomingdale's. She frets about being single but lunges constantly at her longtime crush, a lawyer named Billy Snow, by whom she is sure to be rebuffed. To say nothing of her predilection for nips of vodka in the evening, the random swig from the bottle of gin stashed in her underwear drawer or the beers she might drink on the street while walking to a friend's apartment. While most of these attributes are common to the blithely miserable, self-aware but immature urban women who have become increasingly popular in recent literature, Christensen sends Claudia on a slacker odyssey that encompasses situations far more alienating than fielding nasty interoffice E-mails or gaining 10 pounds. With few and selfish friends, an evil boss, unavailable parents and a mean cat, Claudia takes her only comfort in impulsively grabbing what the city has to offer, and we're not talking about opera at the Met -- her city means East Village dive bars, a diet of chow mein and hot dogs and sex on the Christopher Street piers.

But if you're looking for buxom blondes dressed in nothing but their bare essentials, you'll be disappointed with Code, a sleek, upscale style magazine for African-American men that will hit newsstands in June. A California-based monthly, whose first issue features Samuel L. Jackson on the cover, it is aimed at readers 25 and up. Leaning more toward GQ than Maxim, Code will cover serious issues, ranging from police brutality to racism in the workplace. Columns like Bar Code and Dress Code offer advice on mixing martinis and picking out the perfect tie. The magazine's ideal demographic was on view at the New York launch party last Tuesday at Metronome, jammed with Salomon Smith Barney investment bankers and celebrities like the model Tyson Beckford and the actor Malik Yoba. ''We're not just performers, athletes or criminals,'' said Quincy Troupe, the poet, who is Code's editorial director. ''We're far more complex, and this magazine gives us an opportunity to redefine the black man's image, the way others look at us and the way we look at ourselves.''

Mr. Kobler had over 100 patents to his name, was a pioneer in the field of sound recording and developed the first automated teaching machine called the ''Talking Typewriter''. Mr. Kobler was born and studied in Vienna, Austria where he later on had a patent office. His escape from Nazi Austria in 1938 was arranged by the film actress Gloria Swanson, documented in her autobiography, ''Swanson On Swanson''. In the U.S. he became European Manager of Engineering in Ms. Swanson's firm, Multiprises, Inc. Subsequently, Mr. Kobler became Vice President of Thomas A. Edison Industries and was appointed Director of Thomas A. Edison Industries Laboratories. Mr. Kobler invented the ''Voicewriter'', a remote-controlled dictation device which was installed in large institutions such as hospitals for the dictation of patient records. He invented the ''Rapidial'', the first phone to store and automatically dial frequently used numbers. Mr. Kobler developed several teaching machines, the first in the early 1960's. His ideas about the didactic power of technology were consummated by his ''Talking Typewriter'' proving consistently successful even with autistic and retarded children, despite the fact that the machine to teach reading & writing was designed primarily for very young children. In 1970, Mr. Kobler moved to Switzerland, where he lived for 25 years. In 1995, he took up residence in Florida.

From before the first vote that day until long after the last, she met with her friend Harold Ickes on the second floor of the White House, in the family quarters, to weigh whether for the first time to promote herself rather than Bill Clinton for public office. Hillary Clinton felt flattered that Democrats were begging her to run for the Senate from New York, an idea she had laughed off when Representative Charles Rangel, the mischievous Manhattan Democrat, first suggested it in a Chicago church last October. She was delighted with the shift under way in her public image, from passive victim to political heavyweight. After all her policy work and speechifying, it had galled her to watch her popularity spike upward in the past year as she turned her lapidary smile to the world and suffered through the revelations of her husband's affair with that woman.",1999-05-30T05:00:00+0000

Someday the New Madrid Fault will put my hometown on the front pages -- the last major earthquake to hit southeast Missouri was so strong that it changed the course of the Mississippi River -- but until now the only time Sikeston made news was after an event nobody likes to talk about: one Sunday morning in the winter of 1942, a man named Cleo Wright was dragged through the streets by an angry mob, doused with gasoline and burned to death.",1999-05-30T05:00:00+0000

While Robinson may not have been the greatest ballplayer the Negro leagues produced -- think of him as a prewar Elston Howard -- he did have a prime view for some of baseball's most remarkable and all-but-forgotten moments during his career with the Kansas City Monarchs. He recalls the details of games played half a century ago as vividly as if they happened yesterday. Unclouded by sentiment, he recounts his ragged barnstorming tours against washed-up white Hall of Famers like Grover Cleveland Alexander and Hack Wilson (''Hack was happy to get the work, happy to get paid to keep playing'') and how he and the great Satchel Paige came to an uneasy truce on pitch selection: ''The truth was that he didn't have any kind of a curveball.'' Robinson analyzes the swing of the mighty Georgetown Grays slugger Josh Gibson as expertly as if he had a Telestrator and Super Slo Mo. ''The only way you could get him out was to watch the way he moved at the plate,'' Robinson recalls. ''If he leaned over too far, you could pitch high and tight on him. . . . And if he kind of stands straight up, you can break the ball down and away.'' Robinson's use of the language, at once poetic and unvarnished, is a joy, as when he recalls the most dreaded base stealer of the Negro leagues: ''I'm convinced that catcher's hell is papered with pictures of Cool Papa Bell.'' When Robinson talks about race, he does so with chilling immediacy. ''Back when I first went to Texas, I heard that one left-handed pitcher did get killed. I forgot his name now. Some guy shot him down. Happened right on the field they said. He'd struck out about 10 of their players.'' Robinson died in 1997 at the age of 87 after completing ''Catching Dreams'' with Paul Bauer, an Ohio rare-book dealer. But by using his last years to immortalize these stories, he contributed as much to the game with a tape recorder as he ever did with a bat or glove. Allen St. John",1999-05-30T05:00:00+0000

A few lucky people, writers mostly, get to turn it over and follow the strands to show us how the picture is created. This is what Mike Lupica does brilliantly in SUMMER OF '98: When Homers Flew, Records Fell, and Baseball Reclaimed America (Putnam, $23.95). Lupica is primarily interested in the two biggest stories of the 1998 baseball season -- the home-run hitting of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa and the near perfection of the Yankees -- but he finds fresh ways of telling us history we have already lived through, giving us Joe DiMaggio and Chuck Knoblauch side by side at the Yankee home opener, McGwire with the Maris family in St. Louis, McGwire with his manager, Tony La Russa, in Oakland, then reunited with the Cardinals. The book feels a little bit like a collection of Lupica's columns in The Daily News, held together by the strong thread of his relationship with his three sons and his father. For Lupica, baseball is still about (in Donald Hall's lovely phrase) ''fathers playing catch with sons.'' His sons, who range from 6 to 10 years of age, are discovering the joys of baseball much as their dad did, through a combination of radio, television and loving late-night notes from a parent-fan. The best moments in ''Summer of '98'' come when Lupica finds father-surrogate figures whose relationship to their ''offspring'' reveals a lot of character. For example, he shows us Sosa as a scrawny teen-ager, remembered by the scout who signed him, and Kerry Wood (the Cubs rookie who struck out 20 batters in his fifth start) through the eyes of his high school coach, who still speaks to his former charge almost every day. In contrast, THE PERFECT SEASON: Why 1998 Was Baseball's Greatest Year (Villard, $19.95), by Tim McCarver and Danny Peary, reads like a series of McCarver monologues snatched off the air from his television game analyses, replete with his dreadful puns. The book covers a wide range of the season's many outstanding achievements. There are moments of tremendous insight; McCarver is probably the best baseball analyst in broadcasting today, and it is hard to imagine hearing him over an extended period without learning something new about the game. He is nothing less than stunning in his insights into pitching, generously spread throughout the book. But over all ''The Perfect Season'' feels diffuse and unfocused.
