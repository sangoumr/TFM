us,Screen: Allusive 'WUSA':Newman Stars in Tale About Radio Station,"Booze in his thermos, a garment bag slung over his shoulder, out of the morning strolls Paul Newman, itinerant radio announcer, to offer his services to WUSA, patriotic hate station broadcasting from New Orleans.To Newman comes Joanne Woodward, a wandering harlot with a heart of gold, a loving nature, a carved-up face, a certain vulnerability, and a fund of moral rectitude deep enough to float a generation of movie whores. And to them both comes Tony Perkins, shy social worker engaged among the black poor in a mysterious research projectwhich he learns too late is a fraud designed to discredit welfare, a fraud perpetrated by Pat Hingle, power-mad master of WUSA.Thus Stuart Rosenberg's ""WUSA,"" which opened yesterday at the Penthouse and Plaza theaters, sets the stage for what it clearly intends as a major understanding of social forces at work in Americareactionary social forces, and in the South.If it were an ordinary bad movie (and it is a very bad movie), ""WUSA"" might, in spite of the distinguished names, and less distinguished presence, of its leading actors, be dismissed with no more than a nod to the tension between Rosenberg's ponderously emphatic direction, and Robert Stone's ponderously allusive screenplay. I suspect Stone wins out, for ""WUSA"" feels more like poor theater than poor moviemakingso, that it continually suggests a failed version of ""The Balcony,"" even though it strives to fall short of ""The Manchurian Candidate.""But at least in its ambitions, ""WUSA"" is not an ordinary bad movie. For in its climax, a huge white-power rally sponsored by WUSA, it means to hold a mirror up to middle America, to show the hate behind the innocence, the chaos implicit in the call to law and order.So, while Perkins stalks the auditorium catwalks with high-powered rifle, like the shade of Laurence Harvey (who is also in this movie, but in another role), Newman prepares to purge himself, to tell the country what it is like it is, when all hell breaks loose after the firing of the would-be assassin's bullet.In this sequence, during which Newman explains Vietnam to a panic-ridden, rioting mass of the thin-lipped pinch-faced silent majority, ""WUSA"" has its crucial image, and, presumably, its rational. But in this sequence it displays most brazenly the utter gratuitousness of all its images, the bad faith that informs its self-righteous view of Southern demagoguery, the poverty not of mainstream America but of its own ideas about mainstream America.Despite its obsession with collecting evidence, and its handy school of pseudo-documentary, ""WUSA"" fights unreal battles with an unseen enemy. Lacking either the grace of art of the vitality of guerrilla theater, it can offer only the coarsest nourishmentand only to the elaborately self-deceived.",1970-11-02T05:00:00+0000

Cassius Clay' Begins Run:Kiley Is Narrator of Evslin Script 'Computer Wore Tennis Shoes' Also Opens.,"By means of film clips, voice-over narration, and even a few instructional skits, ""a.k.a. Cassius Clay"" attempts to trace the career of Muhammad Ali (also known as Cassius Clay) from the early years until not quite recently enough to include Ali's return to the ring and last week's technical knockout of Jerry Quarry in Atlanta. It is difficult to imagine a dull movie from this material, and ""a. k. a. Cassius Clay"" isn't dull. But it also isn't as interesting as it might have been with more of Ali and his opponents, more of Malcolm X, more of Cus D'Amatoand rather less of Richard Kiley's pointedly inconclusive narration.Jim Jacobs, the director, and Bernard Evslin, the writer, cast their film as a kind of photo-journalism, so that it commits not only the minor sins of the genrefor example, the editorial stop shotsbut also the major sin of trying to turn its subject into a phenomenon, the embodiment of a trend, when in fact that subject offers in its own right the terms of a significant dramatic essay. Paradoxically ""a.k.a. Cassius Clay"" becomes more ordinary as it becomes more profoundin dealing with Muhammad Ali's convictions, his draft resistance and what it proposes is his importance for radical youth.But in treating the changing styles of a man who is always producing more or less lovely copy for the press, the film does pretty well. And whenever it enters the ring, of necessity, it does very well indeed.I don't know anything about boxing, and I don't even know what I like. But I am moved by Muhammad Ali's supple body and flashing feet, and by what seems the slightest and most dazzling excess of gesture at the moment before the opponent falls or before he staggers to the ropes, his face, almost unaccountably, a bloody mess.The best things in ""a.k.a. Cassius Clay"" concern the first Clay-Liston fight, where in the manner, the stance, the mere presence of the two men, a contest as if between two world orders seems to be taking place. Clay is, of course, brash and boastful and victorious. But Sonny Liston, throughout his training, the conferences, above all the prefight medical examination, suggests a grandeur, a kind of desperate invulnerability, like nothing I had seen in a movie before. It is as if the last of the great battleships, knowing its end was near, had transformed all its armament into one superb doomed image of invulnerability.",1970-11-04T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Owl and the Pussycat' Bows on Screen,"In any compilation of the modern world's 10 most unrewarding stunts, the casting of Barbra Streisand in a straight comedy, especially one as flimsily fabricated as ""The Owl and The Pussycat,"" must rank close to Charles A. Stephens's 1920 attempt to ride over Niagara Falls in a barrel, which turned out to be fatal.Miss Streisand survives ""The Owl and The Pussycat,"" but largely on goodwill, and because even though she never sings, it's possible to remember what happens when she does: through the force of a mysterious, implacable talent, she goes a long way toward making one agree that she isas she proclaimed in ""Funny Girl,"" with an immense desire to pleasethe greatest star.Without a song, she simply isn't.There is still that immense desire to please, but it now seems rooted in belligerency, rather than vulnerability. As Doris Waverly/Wadsworth/Wellington (nee Wilgus), a very improbable New York hooker with a heart of gold, Miss Streisand, the straight comedienne, lacks one essential feature, namely a heart. The performance, which may owe a lot to the manner in which it was written (by Buck Henry) and directed (by Herbert Ross), is mostly cold and edgy and aggressive and loud. There are odd, but only occasional moments  when she suddenly smiles a genuine smile, or when she is listening to someone other than herself (for a change)that recall, if distantly, the real, feeling, thinking performer whose soul is in her music.The screenplay, based on Bill Manhoff's 1964 Broadway comedy (which I did not see), is a fable that lost its innocence some seasons earlier, about the fanciful hooker and the mousy intellectual (George Segal), a Doubleday clerk who, anticipating literary fame, has changed his name from Fred to Felix.In order to be good theater, the discovery by Felix and Doris that they are good for each other need not be as surprising as metaphysical revelation, but it should, at least, be funny. The humor in ""The Owl and The Pussycat,"" however, has to do largely with sarcasm, insult and the sort of logic that has Doris announce: ""I may be a prostitute, but I'm not promiscuous.""Paradoxically, although the tone of the film is vaguely anti-intellectual, a lot of the humor also depends on language. Much is made of the fact that Doris doesn't understand words like despicable, esthetic, assimilate and intrinsic. Then, reaching for the real boffs, the screenplay has Doris utter some ordinary, if vulgar, four-letter word. On second thought, this may be a perfectly valid comic ploy in a society that takes obscene words, either written on placards or shouted, so seriously that they have become, in effect, political weapons. We are, indeed, a sensitive people.The movie is not without its appealing moments, and most of these belong to Mr. Segal, who manages to retain his innate dignity and comic style, even when he is required to over-react as the quintessential nebbish so dear to the heart of Old Broadway. There is also a moment, right at the end, when Miss Streisand responds to him with something like dignity but, for the most part, the sense of the performance is communicated by her long, claw-like fingernails. This pussycat is a full-grown predator.""The Owl and The Pussycat"" opened yesterday at the Loew's State 2 and Loew's Cin Theaters.",1970-11-04T05:00:00+0000

us,'Bullet for Pretty Boy' Recalls an Era,"Larry Buchanan's ""A Bullet for Pretty Boy,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, recounts the criminal career of Charles (Pretty Boy) Floyd from the time when he, a decent fellow, accidentally kills a lout who had insulted his bride and shot his father, until he in turn is killed by Federal agents, also decent fellows, sent to stop his embarrassing bank robberies. I don't believe the movie is especially true to life, but it surely is a lot nicer.I don't know how you can make a murderous gangster movie full of mostly nice guys, and I'm not sure that Larry Buchanan knows how either, but he has tried. Pretty Boy (Fabian Forte, ex Fabian) gulps a lot every time he kills somebody (almost never on purpose), and none of his friends and neighbors turn him in when he hides out with themeven though he carries a handsome reward if caught, and if not caught poses a threat to the friends and neighbors.Both Ruby (Astrid Warner), the girl he marries and leaves behind, and Betty (Jocelyn Lane), the girl who picks him up along the way, really love him, and they fully understand each other's feelings. When Pretty Boy guns down the treacherous brothers of the nice madam with whom he sometimes lives, she also understands and, although upset, doesn't blame him for a minute.""A Bullet for Pretty Boy"" is not, therefore, ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" though there are many pointed references to the Depression so as to place the action in time, and also many ballad-type songs, so as to make it timeless.Actually, the film looks a little as if they had taken the members of the cast of, say, ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" and put them in costume and given them old cars to drive and told them to play it for real. For real it isn't. The bank robberies at first resemble trips to the super-market (express check-out) and later, when Pretty Boy gets a gang of his own, with girls, they resemble young people's outings. When somebody gets shot he crumples down in a grotesque posture and rolls up his eyes and plays deadthe way kids might on the playground or in an amateur theatrical.Thus the appeal of ""A Bullet for Pretty Boy,"" which is pretty minor, is in a sense a function of its several insufficiencies. I liked all the cast, though I couldn't reasonably praise any of them, except for Michael Haynes as an old-time bank robber with whom Pretty Boy serves a brief apprenticeship. Both Miss Lane and Miss Warner are very lovely. Miss. Warner especially, who plays the tragic wife in the manner of the girl next door, ought to be everybody's girl next door. In her performance, as in so much else in the movie, there is an awkward innocence, an utterly inappropriate charm.",1970-11-05T05:00:00+0000

I don'tknow what sort of book Halper thinks he has writ ten, but they were not in his account wonderful days at all. As he remem bers the period it was a time of great poverty, mean housing, shabby existence and long, uneasy waits for literary success. It was also a time of dou bledealing, deceit, traitorous behavior, of the wasting away of literary promise and the early death of friends. The thin narrative thread on which this memoir hangs has to do with his betrayal by his literary agent, the man who was, by his own ad mission, one of his closest friends. What is missing from these recollections is pre cisely any sense of joy, of youthful ex uberance. There is almost no mention of the New Deal, of the growing trade union movement, of the feeling by many that there was a new world to be made and they were the ones to make it.",1970-11-06T05:00:00+0000

In one's head, on cue, mingled strains of Appalachian Spring, Rodeo and Billy the Kid strike up. No! Cut!

us,Screen: Girls (and Boys) in Pursuit of Rock Stars,"""Groupies,"" a film by Ron Dorfman and Peter Nevard, opened yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema. Dorfman and Nevard are young men, without previous major credits. But as practitioners in the art of funky documentary  I'm not really sure what to call ""Groupies""they demonstrate skill, taste, tact and a very good eye for the main chance.Unlike almost all other young documentary filmmakers they have a subject that does not simply cry out to be left alone. How you respond to the film will depend in large measure upon how you are disposed toward that subject. I am rather intrigued.Groupies are, of course, the young (mostly) women (mostly) who pursue rock stars with the announced purpose of getting them to bed. Like true fans in general they differ from most of us in knowing on a short-range basis and with frightening clarity exactly what they want. And like fans in general they show remarkably few illusions about their obsessionswhich are, nonetheless, obsessive for all that.But they want a good deal more than most fans doand some of them get itand so they become interesting less for the intensity of their longings than for the range of their experience.Sometimes that experience is unusual, as with the plaster casters, who contact rock groups so as to make plaster casts of their favorite membersin what amounts to a groupie-cottage industry. Sometimes the groupies themselves are unusual  like Goldie and Chaz, a couple of San Francisco drag queens, male groupies, who in their enthusiasm, petulance, and pathos out-perform their female models.I didn't much care for the male-groupies, particularly Chaz, a sad kid, to whom the film devotes disproportionate attention. Since the essence of groupiness seems to have less to do with starry-eyed devotion than with conscious self-promotion, homosexual parody merely overplays a role that is half parody to begin with.For the real function of ""Groupies"" is to display fantastic personality  in its foul-mouthed, clever, patient, anxious, ugly, beautiful, self-aware girls. Everybody is always on camera; everybody has a story (anything from last night's conquest to total life history) that she tells almost compulsively  and from this eager collaboration between medium and messenger grows a vitality that is its own sufficient reward.Dorfman and Nevard, to their honor, treat the groupies as exploitable originals rather than as understandable phenomena. Consequently their film is more like show-biz than like mock sociology. And in this setting, the girls emerge as rather complicated individuals who are often nutty and sometimes unpleasant but rarely dull, and who are perhaps less pitiable than the evident disorder of their lives would suggest.Among the girls I especially admired was tough, vulgar, aggressive Brenda, whose approach to her quarry (and whose contempt for the easy-to-get) would surely terrify all but the most secure. Miss Harlow, a frizzy-haired plaster-caster, and Lixie, a very pretty assistant, contribute long and revealing monologues. Andrea Whips Warhol's name, like her act (a moderately maniacal strip), is one of the less interesting of the film's put-ons.At the other extreme stands, or rather, placidly sits, Iris, who puts nobody on. Iris is beautiful, with that kind of pug-nosed, flat-planed facial beauty you see only in American girls. And her function apparently is to make men, even the wordly wise stars of rock, fall hopelessly in love with her. In so far as ""Groupies"" deals with the mechanism of sexual attraction, Iris, who explains nothing, explains it all.""Groupies"" contains many sequences showing rock groups in rehearsal and in actual performance. I suppose the film couldn't have been madeor soldwithout such sequences, but they do not seem much to the point. Curiously, the least relevant is by far the besta performance of ""Delta Lady"" by the superb Joe Cocker and the Grease Band.",1970-11-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:'Where's Poppa?' Aims to Remove Bachelor's Momma:Reiner Directs Comedy That Stars Segal Other Features Begin Their Runs Locally,"Sometimes you settle for half a loaf. In movie comedy, even a quarter of a loaf will pass for a feast. So if ""Where's Poppa?"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet Theater, doesn't succeed all the time, or even most of the time, it succeeds often enough, if only by energy and will, to satisfy a taste for comedy that has not had much nourishment this season. And occasionally, when invention, which is in long supply, and execution, which isn't always, get properly together, ""Where's Poppa?"" becomes a desperately funny film.The situation will seem familiar enough to post-Oedipal America. George Segal plays a small-time New York lawyer, a dutiful son who lives at home with his ancient mother (Ruth Gordon), whom he would dearly love to dump forever into an old people's home. If he can't do that (and his father's dying request says he can't), he would like to scare her to death. And if he can't do that, and he can't because she is unscarable, he is almost willing to drop her fragile body from an apartment windowso that the mess she would make on the sidewalk below might at least signal an end to the mess she is making of his life.To speed her on her way, or to get her out of the way, he hires for her a wish-fulfillment nurse (Trish Van Devere), with whom he immediately falls in loveI mean, within the first 10 secondsand whose lovely presence moves Segal, and the film, to the resolution toward which he, and it, had been tending. The resolution itself is nothing much, and I gather that at this stage the story has been monkeyed withor at least cut short of a few final indignities.But for most of its length ""Where's Poppa?"" deals with an exceptionably viable mixture of local jokes and black comedy that works as well as it does because everybody in the film possesses either enough good humor or outrageous imagination to promote his own worldview.A kind of benign individualism applies to everybody (except Miss Gordon)even down to a cheery troop of black youths lounging in Central Park, so they can mug all passers-by, except young women, whom they rape.All the performances, except that of Miss Gordon, who continues to play old age without conviction, are pretty good. But Trish Van Devere, whom I had never heard of, proves a commedienne of a complexity, precision and gentleness exactly to balance the broad cruelties of ""Where's Poppa?"" Carl Reiner's direction also balances those cruelties, and he is absolutely at his best with such magical absurdities as the first meeting between George Segal and Miss Van Devere.Like most New York comedy, ""Where's Poppa?"" means to score points in its incidental treatment of how we live. But unlike most such comedy, it actually scores a few  as when on Central Park West a Negro lady hails a cab, which almost stops but then drives on to pick up instead a wildly gesticulating giant gorilla.",1970-11-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Ursula Andress Appears in 'Perfect Friday' Film,"Lady Dorset (Ursula Andress), a smashing blonde and an absolutely hideous housekeeper, wants money, or, at least, an attentive lover who is very rich and doesn't mind if she cheats a little. Her husband, the Earl of Dorset (David Warner), doesn't mind if she cheats a little. Neither does he mind a messy house nor even an alcoholic nanny, and he needs money for clothes and fornication. Mr. Graham (Stanley Baker), their friend at a nearby branch of the Metropolitan Bank of England, has become bored with his job. He has access to the moneyand a plan.The Dorsets and Mr. Graham form a relationship, united not only by greed and lust, but also by a code of dishonesty that is as firm as the Rock of Gibraltar. Their elaborate scheme to steal 300,000 from the Metropolitan Bank works, up to a point, as does their movie, ""Perfect Friday,"" which opened yesterday at the Forum and 72d Street Playhouse Theaters.The big caper movie, however, belongs to the most rigid, most uninteresting of genres, and I find it difficult to understand why so many directors, including a man as talented as Peter Hall (""Three Into Two Won't Go""), are eventually attracted to it.Perhaps it has to do with the economics of moviemaking, with the type of movie that can be expected to make a profit on its investment, granted a certain minimum degree of quality. Or, it may simply have to do with the same kind of impossible challenge that might prompt a lyric poet to try his hand at haiku.In ""Perfect Friday,"" Mr. Hall and his script writers observe all the conventions of the genre, up to and including the final obligatory twist that must always be a variation on failure. It's this obligation to fail that makes the caper movie, ultimately, so tiresome. Without it, the movie is left open-ended, without shape, but with it, the movie can only hope to be a basic exercise.Within these very important limitations, Mr. Hall has made an intelligent and quietly funny film about three eccentrics, who are as attractively written as they are played. Miss Andress has something of an edge over her two co-stars, being able to appear as often in the buff as in a lot of rather crazy high styles.Her Lady Dorset also is given some of the film's most characteristic lines, as when she and Mr. Graham are sharing a picnic supper on a small hill overlooking an ordinary field, a highway, a construction crane and a housing development. She is such an inveterate liar that she can't help but say, quite seriously: ""Isn't this a strange, pretty place?"" As in life, it's not the big caper but the small deceptions that count in ""Perfect Friday.""",1970-11-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen:'Count Yorga, Vampire' and 'The Crimson Cult' Bow at Local Theaters","One of the nicest things about movies, and rarely mentioned by film estheticians, is that they constitute the only art form that you can begin experiencing in broad daylight and finish experiencing in darkest night, giddy with the guilty realization that dusk has fallen without you. I suppose the same claims can be made for matinee theater and grand opera, but you plan for those and know what dislocations to expect But the movies, despite the line-forming mania of the Upper East Side cinema managers, ought to be something you duck into to avoid the fresh air and the sunshineand the hours you lose must be freely given, squandered without thought of moral reward. Three hours seems about the right amount of time to wasteenough to outlast the longest sunsetand by uncanny chance, three hours is about how long it takes to sit through the double bill of ""Count Yorga, Vampire"" and ""The Crimson Cult,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.Enthusiasts of the genre will not need to be told what these films are about (""The Crimson Cult"" is a British witch movie), and others probably won't care. I should be hard-pressed to defend ""The Crimson Cult"" on any grounds other than affection for the subject and for some of the cast, but not so hardpressed to defend ""Count Yorga,"" which has snatches of seedy insight into the paraphernalia of vampirism and, in Robert Quarry, the best chief vampire I have seen in years. But the special appeal of ""Count Yorga"" may well be its Los Angeles locale; and of ""The Crimson Cult,"" the last performance of the late Boris Karloff.He plays a Professor Marshe, an ancient beneficent believer in the black arts, and his role holds no surprises. But Karloff himself, cadaverous and almost wholly crippled, acts with a quiet lucidity of such great beauty that it is a refreshment merely to hear him speak old claptrap. Nothing else in ""The Crimson Cult"" comes close to himthough there is Barbara Steele in greenface playing Lavinia, a glamorous 300-year-old and a monumental cast that lists no fewer than seven-party girls, plus several sacrificial virgins.Virginity is not at issue in ""Count Yorga, Vampire,"" for the beds from which the Count summons his doomed lovelies generally belong to their boyfriends. However, the other elements are traditionally in orderbeginning with dockside landing of a crated coffin (but marvelously, at the Port of Los Angeles, followed by a long ride in a red pick-up truck through the city's streets and freeways) and not quite ending with a wooden stake through the heart (a makeshift stake, fashioned out of a kitchen chair, in this plastic world, the only available piece of wood).Count Yorga's ambience is pure Hollywood, and the seamy elegance of Robert Quarry's performance as a mysterious medium who has a handy supply of spirits of the dead lying around down-stairs exactly compliments that ambience. Bob Kelljan's direction, often resourceful, does especially well by Quarry's disdainful civilityparticularly toward Dr. Hayes (Roger Perry), his principal adversaryduring their long, tense conversations that are the greatest pleasure in the movie.There are other pleasures. Count Yorga's rented mansion features a gothic basementcomplete with three toothsome female vampires breathing heavily in diaphanous gowns while waiting to do their master's bidding. If you do choose to lose an afternoon, it is good to lose it in the company of such as thesewho sleep away whole days in sensual darkness.",1970-11-12T05:00:00+0000

The National Park Service tem porarily postponed a compli cated rescue operation after Warren Harding, 46 years old, shouted from his perch more than 2,000 feet above the Yosemite Valley floor that he and Dean Caldwell, 27, would go on. They had 1,000 feet to go to reach the top, and Mr. Harding esti mated they could make it in five days if the weather held. The Park Service said the climbers had requested that they be rescued on Wednes day and then refused help today. Members of the climb ers ground party said help had not been requested. All but four members of an 18 man team of expert climbers flown by helicopter to the top of the mountain yesterday were ordered withdrawn. But rangers said the operation was so dangerous that if the climbers get in trouble later and request help it may not be justified to risk the lives of 20 men for two. Mr. Harding, who led the first ascent of El Capitan 12 years ago, and Mr. Caldwell were in the fourth week of their climb up a sheer cliff called The Wall of the Early Morning Light.

The elements are not hard to list: magic, fantasy, bookish learning, poetic touches, naturalistic de tails, intellectual gamesmanship and an irony that toys with all of them. The ingredients are not isolated for study, how ever. They blend and mingle to make their own composition. At some points the reader will think of Scheherazade and her tales, of New Testament parables, of Tal mudic glosses on Scripture, of the writings of Isak Dinesen, with their exotic and foreign touches. Since Borges is a learned man, his stories are packed with references to books and au thors and outoftheway learning. One of his famous stories, The Approach to al Mu'tasim, opens with a deadpan, biblio graphical paragraph: Philip Guedella in forms us that the novel, The Approach to alMu'tasim, by the Bombay barrister Mir Bahadur Ali is a rather uneasy combina tion of those Islamic allegories which never fail to impress their own translators. We are later told that the book has been issued in England by Gollancz with an introduc tion by Dorothy L. Sayers.

us,'Scrooge' Varies Ritual In Version at Music Hall,"It is Christmas Eve, the kind pictured most often on Hallmark's less imaginative greeting cards: an old English street, snow, carolers are singing, people bustle by with packages that look like props. Ebenezer Scrooge sits in his counting house, counting out his money. His clerk, good, loyal, optimistic Bob Cratchit, works in the next room, happy to have a candle to warm himself by.The clock strikes seven and Bob hesitantly asks for his wages. Scrooge is not surprised, but he is, nevertheless, appalled. He screws up his face so that it has more folds than a prune. He squints his eyes as if he'd just been tear-gassed. ""The trouble with you, Crachit,"" he says, using a high, nasty falsetto, ""is that all you think of is pleasure!""One of the pleasures of ""Scrooge,"" this latest movie adaptation of Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" (the first, I think, to be a musical), is the very outrage of Albert Finney's marvelously hokey performance as literature's most easily salvaged misanthrope.Mr. Finney walks more or less bent into an L-shape. He works his mouth as if trying to dislocate a troublesome raspberry seed, lodged between two front teeth. He snarls and giggles and, at one point, threatens to repossess the puppets of a street impresario who owes him money. When the time comes, he even dances enthusiastically at his own funeral, not knowing, of course, that it is his funeral, thinking, instead, that it is some belated civic demonstration in his honor.In Mr. Finney's performance, and in those of one or two others (especially Alec Guinness's as Marley's Ghost, done entirely in battleship gray), ""Scrooge"" has something of the free-wheeling quality of one of those London pantomimes. It is absurd, sentimental, pretty, never quite as funny as it intends to be, but quite acceptable, if only as a seasonal ritual.Except for the undistinguished Leslie Bricusse score, which persists in orchestrating the obvious (Scrooge's two big numbers are ""I Hate People"" and ""I Love Life""), the movie that has been directed by Ronald Neame, from a screenplay by Mr. Bricusse, is a surprisingly faithful adaptation, including flashbacks to Scrooge's youth that seem to be more extensive (and more Freudian) than I remember similar sequences in other adaptations to have been. These sequences also give Mr. Finney the opportunity to walk upright from time to time.There is one sequence that might, conceivably, worry very small children, a rather livid and supposedly comic descent into Hell, during which Marley's Ghost helps fit Scrooge with his eternal chains. For the most part, however, the movie is a fairly literal translation of the Dickens morality tale, dramatizing the enduring old Protestant ethic that them that has canby spreading it aroundget into Heaven.Dame Edith Evans, looking very stately and old, plays the Ghost of Christmas Past, who escorts Scrooge back to his youth. Kenneth More, dressed in a costume that makes him look like a Christmas tree and photographed in such a way that he looks almost as big as the Rockefeller Center tree, is the Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows Scrooge all the fun he is missing by being a beast. And Paddy Stone is the deathlike Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Scrooge's guide to what will be if he doesn't mend his ways.David Collings is a very pleasant Bob Cratchit and Richard Beaumont is Tiny Tim. I'm not all that fond of the original Tiny Tim or ""A Christmas Carol"" to begin with, so it's a measure of the general decency this film that I didn't have any urge to swat the kid.Mr. Neame has directed the movie with all of the delicacy possible after a small story has been turned into a comparatively large, conventional musical. The settings  London streets and interiors, circa 1860 (updated from the original 1843)are very attractive, somewhat spruced-up variations on the original John Leech illustrations.This adaptation, however, is very properly titled, for the movie belongs to Mr. Finney. Even Scrooge's fingernails are dirty, and while I don't think that Dickens intended to equate greed with unwashed hands, he probably would not have objected.""Scrooge"" opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall as the Christmas attraction, approximately five weeks early. The last ""A Christmas Carol"" to play the Hall, a version produced by Joseph L. Mankiewicz in 1938, was unveiled three days before Christmas. When the next version opensI estimate in 2001it may be on the Fourth of July.",1970-11-20T05:00:00+0000

In a show of 40 of Avery's drawings, dating from 1933 to 1962, now on view at the Borgenicht Gallery, 1018 Madison Avenue, there are several brilliant examples of the artist's use of the short hand techniques by which children set down their vi sions of the world: fir trees sketched in with nothing more than continuous, zig zagging lines, hens wobbling on their sticklegs, hills that look like rows of turtles rather than elements of to pography. Not all the draw ings in the exhibition, how ever, are in the comic vein; there are a number of stun ning landscape and nude stud ies which testify to the force and variety of Avery's drafts manship. But the comic draw ings serve to underscore the breadth of Avery's consider able gifts. Known primarily as a painterone of the most determined and steadily pro ductive of the realist painters of the forties and fiftiesand as a formidable colorist, Avery emerges from the pres ent show as a superb and engaging draftsman.",1970-11-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Thoroughly Romantic Rosy:Thoroughly Romantic Rosy,"IF it's true, as one reviewer has written, that every frame of David Lean's new film, ""Ryan's Daughter,"" is ""a work of pure and undiluted genius,"" there are, according to my calculations, approximately 276,480 works of pure and undiluted genius in the 192-minute movie, which should put ""Ryan's Daughter"" on a par with such other repositories as the Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum and the Hermitage.This is a rather staggering amount of Art to be contained by any single movie, but since ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" in 1957, all of David Lean's films have been statistically impressive. They have become longer and longer (""Lawrence of Arabia"" ran just 20 minutes short of four hours); they are very expensive (something over $10,000,000 each, with every dollar on view on the screen), and they collect awards of one sort or another by the bushelful. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Dr. Zhivago,"" the two earlier collaborations between Mr. Lean and Robert Bolt, his scriptwriter on ""Ryan's Daughter,"" won a total of 13 Oscars, which are almost enough to stock a Hollywood souvenir shop.Most important, at least for the people who finance Mr. Lean, his recent films have found huge, and hugely appreciative, audiences. ""Dr. Zhivago,"" which was badly received by most critics, has earned something like $38,000,000 in the United States alone. I have an idea that ""Ryan's Daughter,"" which has been reviewed with a good deal more kindness than I think it deserves, will do almost as wellfor reasons that have a lot less to do with art (the real, lower-case kind that enriches and enlarges one's perceptions) than with the state of mind of a large portion of the audience at this juncture in movie history. That audience really is tired of movies of unmotivated violence, of sex without ordering inhibitions, of equivocal motives and ambiguous realities. It dreams of a world in which there is still a moral order, in which, in fact, crimes can still justify their punishments.""Ryan's Daughter"" is, in outline, a respectable, never-meant-to-be love story, set in 1916 on the wild west coast of Ireland where, except for a small British garrison and the high rate of unemployment, the ""troubles"" in Dublin seem extremely remote. Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles), the daughter of Kirrary's publican, is a sweet, responsive girl whose dreams have been shaped by Byron, Beethoven and Captain Blood, and by pulp fiction on the order of something titled ""The King's Mistress.""Married to a nice, dull, middle-aged schoolmaster (Robert Mitchum), a man who prefers to press wildflowers to Rosy herself, she falls passionately in love with the real-life equivalent of one of her fictional heroes. This is the new commander of the British occupation force, a beautiful, lame major (Christopher Jones), who has been posted to Ireland after being wounded on the Western Front. The major never says very much, but he looks great (like a magazine illustration of a hero), he suffers periodic seizures that appear to be epileptic (but are really memories of life on the front), and he provides the deprived Rosy with her first orgasms.It is no news, I think, that Mr. Lean is one of the great technicians of the movies, and one's memories of later Lean films are mostly of beautifully photographed locales (Ceylon, Syria, Finland) and of extraordinarily well choreographed eventsthe blowing up of the bridge in ""River Kwai,"" the capture of the train in ""Lawrence"" and the beginning of the Russian Revolution in ""Dr. Zhivago."" There is a stunning storm sequence in ""Ryan's Daughter,"" but I suspect that the extraordinary event that one will remember most vividly is Rosy's sexual awakening. As the major makes love to Rosy in a magical forest, dandelions lose their seeds, the sun peers through the leaves to make an effulgent sign of the cross, and the trees themselves go through a little series of ecstatic shudders.This kind of scenic grandeur does not define depth of emotion (it simply substitutes for it), but it does define a universe so responsive to Rosy that her moods actually dictate the weather. Rosy's love affair with the major obviously cannot come to any good end, since it contravenes not only the marriage sacrament but also political loyalties, but there can't be too much despair for Rosy because, after all, she inhabits a system that acknowledges her, and in which there is promise of salvation for every transgression. At a time when the real world seems to be coming apart at the seams, when rewards and punishments are hopelessly muddled, this is a most reassuring concept, one that may also be responsible for what Mr. Lean likes to describe as the ""identification"" that audiences feel with his films.""Ryan's Daughter"" is not a stupid film. It is full of all of the sheer technical wizardry that money can buy. It is, by design, canny and shrewd  I have no doubt that the theme from the schlocky Maurice Jarre score, which sounds very Mediterranean, will turn out to be immensely popular with disc jockeys and may, like ""Lara's Theme"" from ""Dr. Zhivago,"" evolve into the film's biggest selling point. This background score is numbingly pretty, but few of us, I suspect, are completely immune to the effect of such calculated prettiness, at least in small doses.In this connection, I'm reminded of a statement made by Mr. Bolt in the course of a radio interview last summer. In talking about today's youth and their anti-intellectualism, he said, according to the transcript: ""Your gut reaction to a thing is utterly unreliable, and anybody with any degree of detachment, who has lived any length of time, knows that this is so. . . . Let us say that the subject, for a moment, is sympathy. One can be moved to tears by a Victorian painting of a little orphan in the snow, clutching a starving dog on the steps of the mansion house. And there is nothing intrinsically deplorable in being so moved. But a moment's reflection, a moment's taste, a moment's educated perception shows that you've been taken for a ride, that nothing has been said, that your reaction and your tears are largely self-indulgent.""It does seem to me that ""Ryan's Daughter"" is somewhat like the Victorian, painting Mr. Bolt describes. It aims at a gut reaction that is not intrinsically deplorable, but is really rather self-indulgent. It is quite possible to go excavating around in the film, as one friend of mine has done, to find all sorts of clues to larger meanings. One scene, showing the fishermen of Kirrary walking up the beach hidden by their boats, which they carry over their heads, has been interpreted as symbolic of man's primordial emergence from the sea. That may well be, but it hasn't much to do with the rest of the film, and, indeed, in a movie so full of other soapy gestures, this sort of interpretation seems no more artistically valid than most objects normally found on a beach.There are a number of undeniably good things in ""Ryan's Daughter""the quality of Freddie Young's photography, even when the uses to which it is put are something less than admirable; the performances of Mr. Mitchum (restrained, but full of presence) and of Miss Miles, who has a curious ability to seem a positive stick one minute and a full-blown beauty the next; even Mr. Lean's affection for the ""well-made"" film with a beginning, middle and end.In Dickens (as in Mr. Lean's lovely adaptations of ""Great Expectations"" and ""Oliver Twist""), one accepts the well-made plot, with all of its conventions like coincidental meetings, overheard conversations, and such, because they are not only devices, but the manner of a specific kind of fictional life. Mr. Bolt's screenplay never quite achieves that sort of independent reality. When Michael, the village idiot (played by John Mills in make-up as grotesque as Quasimodo's), standing troll-like under a bridge, just happens to overhear Rosy and her major saying their good-byes after a tryst, one's first reaction is to snicker, not to panic for the sake of the lovers.Mr. Lean further stretches our sense of identification by casting Christopher Jones as Rosy's love-object. He is, I think, a decent enough actor but he simply hasn't the weight to balance that of Mr. Mitchum, nor is the character written with much perception. Limping around the beaches with Rosy (everybody in the film seems to walk peculiarly, but that may be because they do a lot of walking in sand), he looks and behaves like an actor out of a summer stock production of ""Journey's End.""It is significant, but not especially encouraging, that people tend to speak of Mr. Lean's work in very painterly terms. One man recently characterized the director's movies as ""broad canvases,"" and John Mills has been quoted as saying that watching Mr. Lean in the cutting room is ""like watching a master painter at work."" There are in ""Ryan's Daughter"" a lot of canvas, paint, brushstrokes, tones and planes of vision. However, the art it represents belongs to that school of very classy calendar art supported by airlines, insurance corporations and a few enlightened barber shops. It doesn't transfigure the world. It embalms it.POSTSCRIPT: I first saw ""Ryan's Daughter"" at a press preview at the Ziegfeld Theater, where the audience reaction tended toward rudeness. Five days later, I returned to see it with a paying audience that stood patiently in line around the block before getting into the theater. The members of that audience loved the movie even before they entered the lobby, and, from the reverence with which they greeted the movie itself, they also loved it while seeing it.The movie is playing on what is called a ""reserved performance policy,"" two shows a day on weekdays, three on weekends. Patrons may purchase the unreserved seats prior to the performance, but if they arrive an hour early to make sure of obtaining tickets, they cannot enter the theater until the earlier show has let out.As a result, at least at the 5 P.M. showing I attended, close to 1,000 people were in a cue down 54th Street to Sixth Avenue, up Sixth to 55th Street and around that corner. Once we did enter the lobby, we were greeted by a large sign asking: ""Tired of standing in line?"" It was a plug for the Walter Reade Theater's new VIP Club, which allows a patron, for an annual fee, to circumvent any Walter Reade theater line for immediate seating. My only question is, what happens if everybody, by some fluke, becomes a VIP?",1970-11-22T05:00:00+0000

It is also, of course, more erotic.""Bwana Toshi,"" unfortunately, belongs to Hani's humanist side. And if its point of view suggests the decency and good wishes of, say, an adult United Nations Children's Fund greeting card, that suggestion is wholly intentional  and, I guess, not wholly dishonorable.Toshi (Kiyoshi Atsumi) is a technician who travels by ship and truck to deliver and construct a base camp, a prefabricated house, for a Japanese expedition engaged in ""discovering the secrets of East Africa."" When he arrives, he learns that the expedition, struck by sickness, has temporarily moved onand he is left to build his house as best he can. He sets about engaging help, and despite his rudimentary Swahili (the first man he tries to hire hires him instead and Toshi spends a day herding cattle), he succeeds in getting an assistant (Hamisi Salehe), whose relationship with him forms the modest central action of the film.That action, nobody will be surprised to learn, is the educationthrough humiliation  of Toshi. Whereas many years ago movie heroes went to Africa so that they might become men, Hani's very modern hero goes to Africa so that he can become a mensch. A lot has been lost in the process, and not just the Fuzzy-Wuzzies. For in achieving the spirit of international cooperation that finally gets Toshi's house built, the film flattens human understanding into something too optimistically simple. Although it is full of admiration for black Africa, ""Bwana Toshi"" does also rather dangerously condescend toward that countryif only in the eagerness with which it stacks all the cards against the Japanese outlander.For reasons that I don't understand, but that seem to have nothing to do with irony, Hani has put into the hands of all peaceloving Africans (the film's crises follows when Toshi shows himself ""violent"" by striking a man) an absolutely terrifying collection of sharp-pointed spears and bows with needle-thin arrows.There is a secondary theme in ""Bwana Toshi"" that is more interesting, and that has to do with what I guess should be called ""vanishing Africa."" Not merely vanishing wild Africa, though there is much of that, especially in an excursion to the mountain home of the few remaining great apes, but also the curious effect of having almost everyone Toshi first goes to for advice or help politely turn and walk awayso that Africa seems to keep vanishing before our very eyes. Eventually Toshi is accepted by his helperswho are indeed his hostsbut before that happens the movie seems funnier, wiser, and more encouragingas if there were a more privileged life hidden behind the mysterious shyness of all those figures in the landscape.",1970-11-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Floating Weeds':Ozu's Sensitive Work Lifts the Every-Day,"From 1923 until his death, Yasujiro Ozu (1903-1963) made more than 50 movies. He is frequently discussed in film magazines; he has received important retrospective showings at the Museum of Modern Art; and by admirers of Japanese cinema he is usually ranked with the greatest directors, Mizoguchi and Kurosawa. But just one of his films, ""Ohayo"" (""Good Morning,"" 1959), had been released here until yesterday, when ""Floating Weeds"" (1959) opened at the New Yorker Theater  which makes it two.For the absence of Ozu from American theaters the reason is usually given that he is so quintessentially and inseparably Japanese in his subjects and his moods that translation would not be worth the effort. Such myths die hard, but I should like to help in killing this one, for whatever quintessentials may be hidden, enough can be seen by any eyes with a head behind them, to certify Ozu as perhaps the most accessible and surely one of the most enjoyable Japanese directors for Western audiences.His subjects are not strange. Indeed, they constitute an anthology of the ordinary: scenes from contemporary bourgeois life; problems of growing up, getting married, settling in a job, retiring, facing death; middle-class homes, bars, snack shops, and streets so bright and closely knit that they seem an urbanist's dream. There is no other director so sensitive to the privileges of daily living, and it seems to me that this sensitivity translates into excellent Western idiom. Even Ozu's titles translate well: ""Late Spring,"" ""Early Summer,"" ""An Autumn Afternoon,"" ""Tokyo Twilight,"" ""The Flavor of Green Tea Over Rice.""Ozu is, however, very special in his technique, which by the end of his career, had become very modest, lucid and lovely. Habitually shooting from a low angle (the position of somebody sitting on a tatami mat, as all the critics point out), rarely moving his camera, Ozu never fades or dissolves but always cleanly cuts between long-held shotsso that his films suggest not so much the rhetorical manipulation of classical montage as the retention and appreciation of the uniqueness of each separate moment.Activity within the frame is also restrained: a family at dinner, kids studying, a young couple kissing, banners fluttering in the wind (a favorite and wonderfully exhilarating Ozu shot)as in ""Floating Weeds,"" to announce the arrival of a troupe of actors.The actors have come to a seaside town to play, without much success, traditional drama. The leader of the troupe (Ganjiro Nakamura) had years before made a local woman (Haruko Sugimura) his mistress, and now they have a grown son, who knows his father only as ""Uncle."" While the troupe fails, its leader devotes his days to his boyuntil his present mistress and leading actress Machiko Kyo) discovers his secret and in revenge plots to have the troupe's ingnue (Ayako Wakao) seduce the young man and thus, by some form of strict middle-class logic, ruin him.The revenge doesn't work (the boy and the girl merely fall in love), but the troupe disbands, and the leader stands ashamed before his son, until he again deserts the boy's motherto take up a new and more precarious life on the road with his mortal foe, whose loyalty he grudgingly accepts.The story is a bit more melodramatic than most Ozu, but its interest really lies in its affectionate intimacies rather than in its larger passions. The scenes between father and son, between old lovers (who have forgotten everything and get all their fond memories wrong), among the members of the troupe  these are where ""Floating Weeds"" comes most characteristically to life.And in the humor or sadness or generic truth of its vignettesthe actors at their make-up; a heroically dreadful theatrical performance; an old woman's hard shrewdness in the face of difficult circumstances; rain at night over the village rooftopsthe cinema of Ozu provides the justification for its gentle and unassumine forms.",1970-11-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Uneven Drama,"Paul Almond's ""The Act of the Heart,"" the second film by the young Canadian writer-director who made his debut last year with ""Isabel,"" is a very personal, very civilized movie that finally, like its haunted heroine, comes to indescribable grief. It's not a successful movie. Its failuressometimes of simple dramatic coherence  are indefensible, but its successes are of an intelligence that is all too rare in this zoom-rock movie age.The film, which opened yesterday at the Murray Hill Theater, is a kind of Holy Ghost story set in Montreal, in winter, among people who live in upper-middle-class houses, like music, play hockey, belong to community associations and seem, in general, to be coping rather well.One girl, however, is different. She is Martha (Genevieve Bujold), a very pretty, pure thing who tutors for her room and board, sings with a local choral group and, in her rather matter-of-fact secret life, dreams romanticaly of Jesus. Martha, a Protestant who marvels at Roman Catholic rituals (of which she has no more real knowledge than most Protestants), falls in love with an Augustinian monk, Father Ferrier (Donald Sutherland), a sensitive, compassionate young man to whom Martha comes to represent the engaged life he is denied.It's a curious love, since it involves her sexual desires as well as her envy of his monastic life, which has, in effect, removed him from what are, to her, the terrors of the real world.Their relationship is lovely and sad and safe, until the monk, in what one feels to be a positive gesture, decides to leave the church and set up housekeeping with Martha. For her, however, his act of renunciation has an inevitably fatal resolution.That a certain extraordinary doom awaits Martha is apparent early on in the movie. Mr. Almond has a way of moving his camera as if he were shooting a mystery story. It seems constantly to suggest unseen presences, and to invest objects with an importance that the characters themselves seem to miss. There are enigmatic encounters, as when Martha goes out of her way to pique the sexual curiosity of a strange, middle-aged man who sits opposite her in a hospital waiting room.At another point, while chattering on about the possible joys of single existence (devoted to something better than a man), she is really inviting a grief-stricken woman-friend to make love to her.Until that point in the film at which it becomes evident that Martha is mad as a hatter (or, at least, so particular, so eccentric, that she is beyond our comprehension), the movie is unequivocally good. Mr. Almond's script, which is about levels of love, eventually becomes something of a mess, as did the one he wrote for ""Isabel,"" but he knows how people talk, how to dramatize conventional versions of love and tenderness, and how to place people in some honest relationship with their settings.He is also a gifted director of actors. Miss Bujold (Mrs. Almond) is lovely in a very mysterious role, and Mr. Sutherland is absolutely right as the fairly mod monk. Equally good are all the supporting players, especially a little boy named Bill Mitchell, a nonprofessional whose work must be credited to the sensitivity of the director.Even with so many things going for it, ""The Act of the Heart"" that concludes the film, and that is not, I feel, arbitrary (it must be the reason the film was made), is not supportable. Self-immolationI can't avoid saying it any longerdemands a grand, tragic logic if it is to be meaningful. Otherwise its the sort of act that makes a banal news story on Page One Monday and is forgotten by Wednesday. There is no grand tragic logic in ""The Act of the Heart.""

us,Glen Campbell and Namath in 'Norwood',"Now that Joe Namath's second movie appearance is in circulation, Paramount has hastily dusted off his first one and rushed it into the circuit theaters and all in vain.The name of the thing is ""Norwood."" It stars Glen Campbell. The first scene shows Glen and Broadway Joe as hitchhiking ex-Marines. They split up and Joe sails out of the picture, grinning and sitting between two cuties in a flashy car.Back he sails in the final reel, as a grinning host to his old pal on his Arkansas farm, where Namath lives with his grandma and pappy. A fine-looking blonde in a bikini slithers around at his elbow. And Joe, ever the genial host, welcomes Glen and his friends. They include a pregnant girl, Kim Darby; a midget, played by Billy Curtis, and an ""educated"" (carnival) hen called Joann.Big Joe has little to do and he does it well. But the picture is a showcase for the guitar-playing Campbell. And it is an entirely shapeless affair that simply bumps him around the country.A pity, too, for he is a pleasant, natural actor  ""True Grit"" proved that  and he sings a clutch of guitar ballads easily and winningly.But the film's curious mishmash quality can't be pinned on Jack Haley Jr., who directed, or Marguerite Roberts, who adapted a Charles Portis novel. While the picture looks edited through a meat grinder, the source must have had something, judging by picaresque bits and pieces.Take, for instance, the amusing, touching Greenwich Village chapter that is plunked into the picture, then yanked out inconclusively involving Campbell, who is fine here, with Tisha Sterling as a wistful, up-tight student. This beautiful girl is simply wonderful in her small role.Instead, the prolonged home stretch centers on Campbell's attraction to the chattering Miss Darby (Miss True Grit), who looks like a chipmunk with a permanent wave. In an early sequence, Carol Lynley looks and sounds as hard as nails. And such languagein a G-rated picture!The record album, for those who care, is the thing here.

She carries in her capacious hold only stuff not per ishable: marble, sisal, hemp and, when she is lucky, cases of brandy. She creaks her way from port to port; anywhere, in fact, where her home office thinks there is a dollar to be made. Her crew too are rel ics, gutted husks of humanity, working through biological tropisms away from pain toward the fulfillment of bodily needs. They drink, they whore, they fall into animal forgetfulness. And in be tween they do only as much work as allows them to lurch from one state to another. They are marine existentialists, men for the moment. For them 5,000 years of cul ture fall away in a moment. They emerge from the ship when in port as from a cave, and with spear and club seek women, Intoxicating beverages, physical pleasure. It is not a case of sitting in judgment on their existence. No one has the formula for the good life, and Mr. Appleman, a poet and teacher, is not so arrogant as to suggest one.
