ReplayTV, however, recently introduced a new version of its machine that allows users to set it to skip advertisements and to transmit recorded programs to other people over the Internet.

Mr. Reeves, based in London, and Mr. Marinelli, based in New York, designed most of the furniture in RM/MR, and their aesthetics match as neatly as their palindromic initials.

Miss Walter joined CAMI in June of 1946, only a few days after she had escaped from war-torn Europe and arrived in New York. Her extensive background and experience in classical music made her an enormous asset to the company, and in 1963 she became a vice president. During her fifty-two-year tenure here, Nelly Walter helped to build the careers of such artists as Leonard Bernstein, Renata Tebaldi, Cesare Siepi, Mirella Freni, Teresa Berganza, Giulietta Simionato, Irmgard Seefried, Montserrat Caballe, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo, Leontyne Price, and many others. Despite her stature and success in the music business, she remained intensely private and always maintained that her job was to keep the spotlight on her artists. She worked harder and kept longer hours than many of her coworkers who were decades younger. When she retired in May of 1998, she was ninety-seven years old. She celebrated her 100th birthday this past January. Nelly Walter set an example of professional excellence and personal integrity for all of us who knew her.

us,A House Whose Rooms Serenely Climb the Walls,"It took nearly 30 years for Wall House 2 to make the leap from blueprint to reality. By September, when it was completed in Groningen, the Netherlands, its architect, John Hejduk, a former dean of Cooper Union's architecture school, had been dead more than a year. The house, with rooms suspended from a wall, had more than 12,000 visitors in one month, said Steven Hillyer, the acting director of Cooper Union's Architecture Archive and curator of ''Wall House 2: John Hejduk,'' an exhibition of 40 photographs, illustrations and architectural models opening on Tuesday at Cooper Union. Mr. Hejduk designed more than 40 Wall houses, but No. 2 (known as the Bye House for its original client) is the only one that has been built. ''Life has to do with walls; we're continuously going in and out, back and forth, and through them,'' Mr. Hejduk wrote in Progressive Architecture magazine in 1974. ''A wall is the quickest, the thinnest, the element we're always transgressing.'' Muted, saturated colors define the curvy rooms. The bedroom is green, the dining room and kitchen are lavender, and the living room is yellow. The studio is terra cotta. Niek Verdonk, a Dutch architect, and Thomas Mller, a German architect, executed the design of the house, with its stucco walls, which cost $600,000 to build. It is to be sold with a proviso that the public can visit it one month a year. Through Nov. 30 at Cooper Union, East Seventh Street at Third Avenue. Free. Information: (212) 353-4220.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  YOUNGKEN, HEBER W., JR.","YOUNGKEN-Heber W., Jr., 88. An internationally known educator, researcher, and university administrator, died October 22 at his home in Peace Dale, RI. He was the son of noted pharmacognocist Heber Wilkinson Youngken and Clara Eastman Youngken. Youngken devoted his life's work to the field of pharmacognosy and natural products chemisty. He was the author and co-author of over 180 publications dealing with the sources, chemistry, and pharmacological characteristics of plants. He was the author of ''Pharmacognosy,'' J.B. Lippincott, PA, 1951, second ed. 1965, a textbook, (with R. Pratt), and ''Organic Chemistry in Pharmacy,'' J.B. Lippincott, PA, 1949 (with Wilson, et al), among other texts. His writings appeared in numerous national journals including the ''Journal of Natural Products'' and the ''Herbalist.'' He also contributed to research findings in the field of drugs derived from marine organisms. Youngken was the recipient of numerous awards, including the American Pharmaceutical Association Newcomb Award in Pharmacognosy, and achievement awards from the American Society of Pharmacognosy. Youngken served on review councils of the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, and was a principal researcher of numerous grants for studies in the field of natural products. He was a member of the revision committees of the ''United States Pharmacopeia'' and the ''National Formulary'', and frequent consultant to members of the drug industry on botanical drugs. Youngken came to Rhode Island in 1956 as the dean to establish, organize and develop the University of Rhode Island College of Pharmacy after 15 years in the pharmacy faculty at the University of Washington in Seattle. Under Youngken's leadership the URI pharmacy college grew in teaching, research, and service from 9 faculty and 135 students to 33 full term and 18 part time faculty with more than 600 undergraduate and graduate students at his retirement in 1981. Its faculty and graduates have gained worldwide recognition for excellence in pharmacy research and the related health sciences. He was a visiting professor at the University of London, 1970 and the University of Cairo, Egypt, 1977, '79, '81, and '85. Nationally prominent in pharmaceutical education and research, Youngken chaired or served on various committees representing the American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA), the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), the Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences, the American Society of Pharmacognosy (former president), the Society of Economic Botany, and many others. In 1953 he published one of the first papers in the United States to promote the concept of clinical pharmacy and the student externship programs. In 1958, he founded the Pharmacy Clinic at URI for continuing pharmacy education, now dedicated in his name. In 1994, the medicinal plant garden at the University of Rhode Island was dedicated to Youngken. A new faculty chair at URI, known as the OmarYoungken Distinguished Chair in Natural Product Chemistry, was created in his honor in 2001. Youngken served in the US Navy during World War II in North Atlantic convoy escort duty, later achieving the rank of Captain in the US Navy Reserve. He held degrees from Bucknell University (AB), the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy (BS), and the University of Minnesota (MS, PhD). In 1982 he received an Honorary DSc from the University of Rhode Island. Youngken is survived by his wife Daphne Goodwin Youngken, two sons, John Ronald Youngken of New York City and Richard Charles Youngken of Wakefield, RI, and two granddaughters, Kelly Goodwin Youngken of Arlington, VA, and Abigail Bouldin Youngken of Greensboro, NC.

Mr. FitzGerald, 56, has been running the five and a half miles from his home in London's Chelsea district to Unilever's headquarters, where a chauffeur hands him a briefcase and a business suit. A former pack-a-day smoker, he started running in the 1980's while working for Unilever in South Africa. A pulled hamstring almost made him quit the 1997 London Marathon, until a runner dressed like an octopus passed him. Mr. FitzGerald figured that if the octopus-clad man could finish, so could he. This year, Mr. FitzGerald has an added incentive: $2 million he raised from corporations to be donated to children's charities. ''I'm looking forward to participating, and hopefully to finishing,'' he said. Suzanne Kapner",2001-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Since Sept. 11, the Mojave Airport -- an aviational salvage yard in the desert about 100 miles north of Los Angeles -- has been filling up with unneeded planes. Six or seven land daily, and sometimes twice that many, the mute mechanical victims of hard times and public fear. At the moment, there are about 200. In most cases, their fuel tanks have been drained and their cabins sealed like tubular tombs, a storage procedure the industry calls ''pickling.'' All shined up with nowhere to go, the planes, in their stillness, are spooky. When stock markets drop, no one knows where the money goes -- it vaporizes. But when thousands of flights are canceled, the castoff energy takes a physical form. The loss in this image is palpable, the loss of raw human activity. They seem almost dejected, these planes, like grounded children. They long to please us, to show what they can do. And maybe, should things pick up again, a few will get that chance. Their fuel tanks will be refilled and their hatches unlatched, and their masters will strap themselves into their cockpits. And they'll soar. For now, though, they sit, and you sense that it's hard on them. Walter Kirn",2001-11-04T05:00:00+0000

On Dec. 8, a Warner Brothers employee filed a report on a property called ''Everybody Comes to Rick's,'' which the studio released in late November of the following year, drastically altered to reflect the demands of the time, as ''Casablanca.'' Everybody knows the story of how Rick, a cynical nightclub owner whose credo is ''I stick my neck out for nobody,'' rediscovers his essential nobility and sacrifices self-interest to the greater good. The basic story line would become a staple of wartime American cinema -- the film historian Thomas Schatz said it ''signaled the wartime conversion of Hollywood's classical narrative paradigm'' -- and would help make Humphrey Bogart one of the top movie stars of the era. In retrospect, ''Casablanca'' can also be seen as a metaphor for Hollywood's own heroic contribution to the war effort.",2001-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Some of his designs are kinetic, with roofs that open and close or sunscreens that move with the light. Although he is inspired by great building of the past -- Gothic architecture, late-19th-century railway stations and the bridges of engineering greats like Frei Otto and Robert Maillart -- Calatrava will often explain his design ideas with a physical movement, say the flapping of a wing or the folding and unfolding of two hands in prayer.

Of course, Mr. Pugliese owns the place, one of three such grills (the others are in Marlboro and Madison), which he describes as ''upscale fast-food restaurants.'' And when he says fast, he means fast. That's because there are no waiters or waitresses. The only wait involved is the 8 or 10 minutes it takes to be served freshly cooked ribs, or the time it takes to prepare roasted or grilled chicken, hamburgers and salads, plus sandwiches, pitas and finger foods, plus desserts like tiramis or baklava. The tab ranges from $6 to $7 for an average meal, up to $48.99 for a LaRosa Feast No. 5: ''4 whole chickens, 8 large side dishes and 10 corn bread.'' Eat-in customers -- ''a lot of locals,'' Mr. Pugliese says -- can sit in any of 15 booths in the 2,000-square-foot restaurant.

It comes from ''The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson,'' a four-year-old episode of the Fox show. During a family trip to Manhattan, Homer finds himself on a cartoon version of the plaza between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. There, waiting for a traffic officer to remove the boot from his pink family sedan (while his family is taking in a Broadway musical about the Betty Ford Center), Homer meets a vendor selling an exotic delicacy called Khlav Kalash. He buys some, washing it down with many cans of crab juice. When all that crab juice takes its inevitable toll, Homer runs up 107 flights of stairs, only to discover that the men's room in Tower 2 is out of order. But that's not the only surprise: Tenement-style clotheslines are strung between the two skyscrapers, and the windows open to reveal surly New Yorkers yelling at each other to shut up.",2001-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Our tour guide is a photographer named Aurora del Valle, who tells the story of her life as she reconstructs it with the help of old pictures and family gossip. She learns that her mother died during childbirth and that she was only 5 when sent to live with her paternal grandmother, one of many bigger-than-life women who would instill a sense of independence in her despite the inchoate feminism of 19th-century South America. (Her maternal grandmother figured prominently in Allende's previous novel ''Daughter of Fortune.'') As Aurora slowly uncovers the tales of her family's sordid past, we witness her own unhappy marriage and eventual self-discovery. Allende doesn't probe the inner life of every character to its deepest layer, but she musters enough grace and poise to give us complex histories in the simplest lines. It adds up to a book about transformation -- of people and nations and of the rights of women. Andrew Ervin",2001-11-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Fewer Students Suspended," The number of public school students suspended for bad behavior has dropped by almost 80 percent this school year, a change the Board of Education attributes to the somber mood in classrooms since Sept. 11. Schools have reported 1,455 suspensions from early September to mid-October, down from 6,910 for the same period last year. Some of the steepest declines were in Manhattan, where schools were more directly affected by the terrorist attack. FRANCINE GOLDSTEIN, the board's director of student support services, said that students were more subdued this fall and teachers more reluctant to suspend those who misbehave. But some teachers theorized that principals were afraid to suspend students because Chancellor HAROLD O. LEVY had ordered districts to try to cut suspension rates. Although a new state law allows teachers to remove disruptive students from the classroom temporarily without formally suspending them, only 110 such removals were reported.

The equivalents are approximate, but they certainly beat guessing when the recipe is for brownies and your pans are all pie plates. An even more useful feature is a hidden measuring tape, which comes in handy for measuring unmarked pans. The magnet costs $4.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street), (212) 787-2000; and $6.50 at Broadway Panhandler, 477 Broome Street (Wooster Street), (212) 966-3434.

us,World Business Briefing | Europe: Britain: Acquisition By WPP Continues,"Faced with intractable opposition from British regulators, the WPP Group said it would proceed with its $637 million acquisition of the Tempus Group. Martin Sorrell, left, WPP's chief executive, argued that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks had a material adverse change on Tempus's business of buying advertising space for clients. He tried to invoke an escape hatch that would have allowed WPP to abandon the deal. But regulators ruled against him and last week dismissed his appeal. At that time, Mr. Sorrell said he would appeal a second time, but yesterday WPP notified regulators that it would drop its case. In published remarks yesterday, members of the regulatory body, known as the Takeover Panel, agreed with Mr. Sorrell that the events of Sept. 11, ''were exceptional and unforeseeable.'' But they said WPP had failed to show what effect those events had on Tempus's business, beyond the general slowdown in the advertising industry. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)",2001-11-07T05:00:00+0000

It would have connected the last bit of Europe to the first bit of Asia, but the design was rejected by the Turkish sultan, who thought it technologically impossible. Five hundred years later, the bridge has finally opened -- in a small town in Norway. The Norwegian artist Vebjorn Sand saw Leonardo's tiny drawing of the bridge in 1995. ''I just fell in love with the design,'' he said, ''and was amazed that it had never been built.'' Mr. Sand persuaded the Norwegian Public Roads Administration to build a 190-foot timber version of the bridge so pedestrians could cross a highway in the town of As. The bridge (above, before teak and stainless steel railings were added) was built by the architect Knut Selberg of Trondheim and the Moelven Group structural engineers at a cost of $1.47 million. ''I am very proud of the result -- taking a sketch from Leonardo da Vinci and translating it into a modern laminated wood-arch construction,'' Mr. Selberg said. He called it ''an interpretation of the original.'' Queen Sonja opened it officially last week. Mr. Sand said that the bridge was the first civil engineering scheme by Leonardo to be realized. Its elegant, pressed-bow form is based on an engineering principle that was not generally accepted until the 1800's. Mr. Sand now wants to put a Leonardo bridge on every continent. The bridge, he said, ''has a Renaissance man's dual way of thinking and at the same time touches on something eternal.'' PETER HALL",2001-11-08T05:00:00+0000

us,One Way to Put an Annex on a Fairy Tale Castle,"In 1997, when Aaron Parker, an architect in Minneapolis, was hired to design an addition to the American-Swedish Institute there, he flew to Stockholm to look at how things were built. He saw curvy, sloped roofs ''of wood, cedar shakes and thatch,'' he said. Mr. Parker designed a 65,000-square-foot addition (the left part of the model, right) emulating those rooftops. Some see the roofs of Swedish public buildings in it, others the thatched roofs of Swedish barns. The institute's turreted and spired building, finished in 1908, was originally the home of Swan Turnblad, the publisher of the Svenska Amerikanska Posten, a newspaper in Swedish. In 1929, Turnblad transformed it into an institute for Swedish arts and science. ''It's an extraordinarily well-ordered Palladian plan, disguised as a fairy castle,'' said Mr. Parker, who teaches architecture and urban design at the University of Minnesota. The addition, which will include a rooftop garden planted with grass, is estimated to cost $18 million. Half of the money has been raised, the architect said. He hopes the institute, at 2600 Park Avenue, will break ground next year. ELAINE LOUIE",2001-11-08T05:00:00+0000

His devotion to his career and his conviction that he was a man of destiny were far stronger than any class or tribal loyalty. There have been politicians of high duty and honour &#151; Edward Halifax and Alec Douglas-Home immediately spring to mind &#151; who did see life through spectacles much bounded by their landed background. But Churchill was emphatically not among them. Apart from anything else, he never had any land beyond his shaky ownership (and later only occupation) of the 300 acres surrounding Chartwell, the West Kent house only twenty-four miles from London which he bought in 1922 and just managed, with financial subventions from friends, to cling on to for the remaining four decades of his life.

Mr. Hands will take 70 members of his team with him, and the deal is expected to be completed by March of next year.

In that period he made Nomura, Europe's leading private-equity investor, into Britain's biggest pub landlord and bought luxury hotels and German real estate. Nomura will invest in the new fund, for which Mr. Hands wants to raise $2.7 billion, the people close to the discussions said, adding that the details of the arrangement were still being negotiated.

Under Mr. Buffett, Berkshire has been raising prices in its flagship insurance operations to improve profits after several years of bigger-than-expected losses. General Re's top credit ratings and ample capital may allow it to benefit more than most insurers from the ability to raise rates since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which caused an estimated $70 billion in insured losses, analysts said.

Its hundreds of grainy black-and-white images by Shepard Sherbell depict a land that was always raw, uncomfortable and so full of powerful contrasts -- the best and worst of the world -- that few would assume it could offer solace. Sherbell set out to portray the end of the Soviet Union. He offers ample evidence of the detritus that attests to the failure of the Soviet empire: the rusting hulks of ships or factories; the urban developments thrown up to house millions, littered with discarded pipes or even the carcasses of nuclear missiles; the vast factories whose architecture screams ''Planned!'' and whose workers struggle to keep production going; the fallen statues of Soviet heroes like Lenin or Feliks Dzerzhinsky, founder of the organization that became the K.G.B. Yet Sherbell's keen eye has also discovered why this most enduring of authoritarian systems did not, after all, prevail. Even the most ruined faces that gaze out from these vistas of destruction glisten with unvarnished human emotion, hinting at the vast cultural achievement that will always be Russia's, though it is merely glimpsed here.

If the nihilistic glare of the models this time spoke to the surreal nature of the shows, occurring as they did while bombs were falling on Afghanistan, usually it can be read as a mirror of the audience. That audience, which could conceivably witness up to 250 shows a season, does its best every six months to bead and feather the dull routine of it all. But as editors lined up in their front-row seats this time, many turned to the left or turned to the right and asked, Is this the only way for fashion to register change? Like the closing of the stock market and the grounding of the nation's airlines, the halt to the runway shows in New York on Sept. 11 was a historic first. But before fashion picks up exactly where it left off, is there some way to rethink New York's industry and its role in this new world?",2001-11-11T05:00:00+0000

In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the magazine published ''Remains of the Day,'' a special issue that focused on that loss. Today, exactly two months after the attack on New York, the magazine looks away from the towers' destruction and ahead to the city's future. This issue's subject is rebuilding -- and not just of physical structures but also of psyches, families, institutions and communities. In a series of manifestoes, writers lay out their blueprints for a better New York. In ''Let Us Count the Ways,'' New Yorkers remind us why the city inspires such love. And some of the city's musical stars contribute original songs, commissioned by the magazine and inspired by this moment: a soundtrack for a city full, even now, of possibilities.",2001-11-11T05:00:00+0000

Now she's running a more modest operation, a lunch spot called the Garden Caf, in the Y.M.C.A.-Y.M.H.A. in Princeton. She says she can make a good soup out of almost anything, and that is what she does. ''I research a lot of soup recipe books, but I swear some of my best soups come out of the blue,'' she said, citing one of her more popular creations as a mixture of some leftover carrot-ginger, split pea and lentil soups. Customers have been asking her for the unnamed soup ever since. She prepares two soups each day, making the unassuming one-room cafe across from the Y's day care center a popular stop for lunch. The menu depends largely on how Ms. Alegria and her son Blake Varr feel that morning, but a few items like chicken, egg and tuna salads, are almost always on the menu. The chicken salad, served on white, wheat or a croissant, consists entirely of breast meat, poached then shredded and prepared with fresh onions, celery, carrots and spices, many of which have traveled with Ms. Alegria from the Union Square market in Manhattan.A $5.25 combination price buys half a sandwich and bowl of soup.

Since the end of the cold war, course descriptions have shifted to address issues relevant to a seemingly safe world, and federal spending on international education has dropped in real dollars. Since the 1960's, foreign language study has declined sharply. And despite the fact that there are 1.3 billion Muslims in the world, the majority of undergraduates at American universities have been exposed to only a limited range of courses about Islamic history, politics and culture, with the number of academics in these fields relatively small.

The connection is on average; an individual's I.Q. cannot be gauged this way.

Loving husband of Gaye, devoted father of Bill, Amelia, Jack and Julia, beloved grandfather of Stacey, Lydia, Anna and Zachary and brother of Judy and Donald. Friend and colleague to many as Vice President at JP Morgan and partner at Morgan Lewis G&A. Born February 2, 1930 in Sanford, Florida, Bill graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951, and Columbia Law School in 1958, after military service as an officer in the US Naval Reserve. Bill began a 26-year career at JP Morgan & Co. in 1958, first as legal counsel, then as Vice President serving the banking needs of many of America's largest companies. Bill interrupted his career at Morgan in the mid 1960s, heeding the call of John F. Kennedy for public service. He led the Latin American Lending Division of the US Agency for International Development. Bill was the first head of the workout department of Morgan in the 1970s and was named a director of Penn Central when that company emerged from bankruptcy. In the mid-1980s he created and led the bank's leveraged buyout activities. Bill's vigorous independence of mind, pragmatic approach to business and ability to find humor in almost any situation impressed all with whom he came in contact. From long standing business relationships grew many fast friendships. At the suggestion of a bank colleague, Bill met his second wife, Gaye McIntosh, just over 20 years ago. In 1986, Bill left JP Morgan to become partner in the leveraged buyout firm of Morgan Lewis G&A. After 7 years of creative and successful deal making, Bill and his family moved to Vero Beach, Florida to be close to his Florida roots.

Raffio on May 12, 1984 in St. Catharine's Church. He was the devoted father of Brian Michael & Caitlin Alexandra and stepfather and fatherin-law to Kerri & Chris Kelly of NYC.

us,'J. R. R. Tolkien'," The dominant literary mode of the twentieth century has been the fantastic. This may appear a surprising claim, which would not have seemed even remotely conceivable at the start of the century and which is bound to encounter fierce resistance even now. However, when the time comes to look back at the century, it seems very likely that future literary historians, detached from the squabbles of our present, will see as its most representative and distinctive works books like J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings , and also George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm , William Golding's Lord of the Flies and The Inheritors , Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five and Cat's Cradle , Ursula Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed , Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot-49 and Gravity's Rainbow . The list could readily be extended, back to the late nineteenth century with H.G. Wells's The Island of Dr Moreau and The War of the Worlds , and up to writers currently active like Stephen R. Donaldson and George R.R. Martin. It could take in authors as different, not to say opposed, as Kingsley and Martin Amis, Anthony Burgess, Stephen King, Terry Pratchett, Don DeLillo, and Julian Barnes. By the end of the century, even authors deeply committed to the realist novel have often found themselves unable to resist the gravitational pull of the fantastic as a literary mode.

The results, reported at the American Heart Association meeting in Anaheim, Calif., were from a Phase 2 trial. The company, based in Cheshire, Conn., is planning a larger Phase 3 trial. The drug, pexelizumab, is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits inflammation that can occur when the blood is passed through the heart-lung machines often used in bypass surgery, said Dr. Jane C. K. Fitch, chairwoman of the anesthesiology department at the University of Oklahoma and an author of the studies. ''This is one of the first things available that may be able to prevent this,'' she said. In a study involving 914 bypass surgery patients, 3 percent treated with the drug had heart attacks or died in the 30 days after the operation, compared with 9.3 percent for those receiving a placebo. However, when smaller heart attacks were included, the drug did not show a statistically significant improvement over the placebo, something the company had previously reported.

Teachers earned $232 million in per-session pay last year, up from about $95 million two years earlier, court papers say. Under the teachers' contract, the per-session rate is about $33 an hour. In the ruling on Thursday, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan found that the additional hours worked amount to ''vital components of the education experience'' and should be rewarded as such.

us,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Equipment Maker Reports A Loss,"Applied Materials, the world's largest supplier of chip-making equipment, posted a fourth-quarter loss and warned that it might do so again this quarter, as chip companies delayed orders for new tools. Applied Materials lost $82 million, or 10 cents a share, on sales of $1.26 billion, and said it expected revenue to decline to about $1 billion this quarter. Excluding a $149 million restructuring charge, the company earned 3 cents a share, a penny less than analysts had expected. Adopting an accounting rule that revises the timing of the recognition of revenue, the company restated its sales and earnings for the entire year, making comparisons with the 2000 results difficult. During the fourth quarter last year, the company earned 77 cents a share on sales of $2.92 billion. James C. Morgan, above, the chief executive, said the economic downturn had led to delays in the introduction of new chip-making technologies just as the industry needs them most.

The ruling reduced the statewide standard of proof to that already used in New York City, where a tenant need prove only that a landlord knew his property was built before lead-based paint was banned in 1960, that lead paint was peeling and that a young child lived in the building.

us,'In the Shadow of Our House'," If you had lived long on our street, and drunk late at our parties, you would know that before retiring and moving to Texas, Odie Dodd had been a government physician in Georgetown, Guyana. Squawking through the hole in his throat where his larynx had been before the cancer, Odie would have told how Jim Jones had asked him to the People's Temple to vaccinate the children. How malaria, cholera, bacterial meningitis slept in the jungle underbrush. How his truck had overheated along the rutted jungle road and he'd arrived a half-day late. How he was the first to find the bodies, though. Families. Limbs intertwined. Mothers sprawled over children as if sheltering them from some imminent hardship. Scattered on the dirt around them, dixie cups that had held the grape punch and cyanide. And already, of course, the smell. The uninterrupted whine of insects. At a party, Odie's hand would flatten his silver comb-over, and he'd say he hadn't known where he was for a time. That he'd wandered outside the compound and crouched in the shade of the jungle, the insect whine growing louder. In his daze, he glanced up into the canopy and for a moment it seemed it would descend on him. His scalp prickled. He called out. The feeling, he would say, was as in a dream when you know a terrible thing is about to happen but you are helpless to prevent it. But of course the thing had already happened. And then, if Odie had sipped enough scotch, and his wife Ruth had not yet touched his elbow to leave, he would have pulled you aside and asked the question he always asked of us: why was he spared? Later it would occur to you, as it did to Dennis Lipsy, that Odie had not been spared. And sometimes, when you are at the edge of sleep, witnessing calamities befall your children or your own can't-find-the-brake veering into oncoming traffic, Odie's fleshy hole appears.

Like the &quot;geological upheavals&quot; a traveler might discover in a landscape where recently only a flat plane could be seen, they mark our lives as uneven, uncertain, and prone to reversal. Why and how? Is it because emotions are animal energies or impulses that have no connection with our thoughts, imaginings, and appraisals? Proust denies this, calling the emotions &quot;geological upheavals of thought.&quot; In other words, what changes the Baron's mind from a flat plane into a mountain range is not some subterranean jolt, but the thoughts he has about Charlie Morel, a person who has suddenly become central to his well-being, and whom he sees as inscrutable, undependable, and utterly beyond his control. It is these thoughts about value and importance that make his mind project outward like a mountain range, rather than sitting inert in self-satisfied ease. ",2001-11-18T05:00:00+0000

My mother had insisted on going with him, and taking the baby too, because she thought it might be the last she'd see of him. She was 25, he was 30. There was no direct route; they had to travel north to Chicago, change stations and catch a second train westward.

His meteoric rise from rookie cop at Manhattan's 14th Precinct during the '60s to Lieutenant Detective in the early '70s, during which he led a massive crackdown upon organized crime involved in pornography, resulted in the William Sherman book entitled Times Square, which chronicled the harsh realities behind the lights and glitter of Broadway during the Koch administration.

On film, he uses it to project a Chamber of Commerce faith that people will listen to him no matter what he has to say -- which works when he plays characters whose complacent authority makes them slightly insufferable, like the brain surgeon Michael Hfuhruhurr in ''The Man with Two Brains'' (1983) or the dentist Frank Sangster in Mr. Martin's latest movie, ''Novocaine,'' a black farce from what can only be called the James M.

The Hut was one of several assets in a Harleston dynasty of land and slaves. (Other family estates were named Rice Hope and Richmond.) Few records have survived from William Harleston's youth. Even his birth date is in question &#151; the year is known, but there is no record of the day &#151; as though it had been clipped from memory. A genealogy states that he was one of five children, with three older sisters, Hannah, Sarah, and Constantia, and one younger brother, John. As a boy growing up on The Hut, a one-thousand-acre rice plantation with about sixty slaves, William would have passed his youth in ways appropriate to his class and sex: he hunted deer and fished, was schooled in classics and mathematics by private tutors, and attended the glittering society balls held every winter in nearby Charleston.

There, a tall obelisk marks the beginning of the city. It was erected in 1830 to commemorate the completion of the first proper highroad across the Karst, connecting Vienna with its seaport on the Adriatic. Now the monument is peeling and neglected, and its setting is suburban, but when it was new, it told the grateful traveller that his journey across the wasteland was over, and he was reaching a haven of imperial order &#151; an up-to-date Mediterranean outpost of the empire of the Habsburgs. The young Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Joseph Maximilian came this way in 1850 and thought the Karst a cursed desert, but he saw the distant appearance of the obelisk as a symbol of hope, and urged his coachman to get a move on.

Almost always unfamiliar, though, was the return address itself. These old acquaintances of mine, these ghosts from my past, had moved away from the places where I had known them, some very far. One of the few letters from the state of New York had been mailed from a men's penitentiary. Sometimes the writer wrote PERSONAL On the envelope, or PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL. &quot;I hope you will remember my sorry ass,&quot; the letter from the inmate began, &quot;now that it has landed in jail.&quot; ",2001-11-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Boy Detective Gets Wise,"The pseudonymous Jay Russell's new novel, BROWN HARVEST (Four Walls Eight Windows, paper, $14.95), is crammed with ruses and red herrings, but the biggest mystery is why nobody ever thought of its ingeniously entertaining premise before. That treasured and familiar literary character, the boy detective, has grown up, traded his innocence for cynicism and morphed into the rumpled antihero of a 21st-century noir. The former smartest kid in town -- and more recently, a computer hacker and convict -- has come home for the funeral of his childhood love. But as he careers through streets named Milne and Exupry, he discovers his once sleepy town transformed into a hotbed of high-tech crime, corruption and, most jarring of all, chain stores and biscotti stands. It isn't long before he's locking horns again with his youthful nemesis, Roach Blackwell, only this time in a software war. Russell knows all the tics and twists of his genre, and his delight in playing with them is infectious. His protagonist knows all too well that his old town and its denizens have secrets to hide -- his father, the former chief of police, is a corrupt drunkard, his tomboy best friend was the local bad girl. But as he peels back layer upon layer of awful truth, he finds (as boy detectives and jaded gumshoes alike must) something noble and redemptive mixed in with the grime. Like the director David Lynch, Russell has an affection for both the heartbreakingly pure and the unspeakably seamy -- and a natural talent for mixing the two into a sweet-and-sour cocktail. If he occasionally goes in for cheap potshots at the world of boulangeries and carpal tunnel sufferers, he can be forgiven for the sincerity of his disgust and the sharpness of his wit. In his hands, sex, violence and mayhem aren't a problem -- they're the bracing, all-American antidote to bored consumerism. Mary Elizabeth Williams",2001-11-18T05:00:00+0000

These were photographers who, whatever their claims of artlessness, knew what they were looking for. Emptiness for Evans and Frank, a matter of a place that in some essential way fended off its inhabitants.

A report by Grant Samuel & Associates determined that the bid by AngloGold, which values Normandy at 1.46 Australian dollars a share (76 cents), ''is neither fair nor reasonable,'' Normandy told the Australian Stock Exchange. But Bobby Godsell, AngloGold's chief executive, is asserting that since last week, when Newmont offered 1.70 Australian dollars a share, a drop in its stock price has lowered the value of its offer. The difference between the bids now is marginal, Mr. Godsell said, adding that Normandy's response ''is potentially misleading'' for its shareholders.'' Becky Gaylord (NYT)",2001-11-20T05:00:00+0000

Damaged or not, they may be impossible to throw away because of their sentimental or intrinsic value. In most cases, however, specialists can bring them back to almost-new.

The cost is $20 to $25 a piece, depending on the damage. Mr. Jochec works with porcelain and ceramics, too. Expect a wait of 10 days to two weeks for crystal and longer for complicated porcelain work. If silver, brass, copper or bronze goods are damaged, Paul Karner of Restoration and Design Studio, 249 East 77th Street, removes dents and scratches, and solders and replates.

Mr. Menem was released from house arrest this week after the Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors had insufficient evidence to back their assertion that he led a conspiracy to sell arms illegally to Croatia and Ecuador between 1991 and 1995 when he was in office. Mr. Menem is expected to be challenged by at least three powerful governors, and his leadership of the Justicialist Party, founded by Juan Domingo Pern in the 1940's, is being contested by one of his former vice presidents. ''If there is a solution for Argentina's crisis it passes through the Peronist party and, more modestly, through me,'' he said. Clifford Krauss (NYT)",2001-11-23T05:00:00+0000

us,'A Hero of Our Own'," Early in the afternoon of August 4, 1940, Varian Fry crossed the ramp at La Guardia Airport to board a Pan American Airways Boeing B-314 to Europe for what would turn out to be the greatest adventure of his life. His wife and a small group of friends were there to see him off. As he walked toward the water where the seaplane was docked, sunlight danced off Fry&#8217;s glasses, mirroring the delight in his eyes. A slender man, above-average height, with dark brown hair and green eyes, he sparkled, pressed and immaculate, eager to be on his way. Over the gangplank, onto the Clipper, and belted in, Fry sank back finally to wave farewell to his wife and friends through the tiny window. His destination was Marseille, a large, dirty port city near the southernmost tip of France that had become the last stop for many thousands of refugees from Hitler. From there, they hoped to embark to the United States, Britain, Canada, Mexico, Cuba&#8212;any country without a Nazi presence. By the time of Fry&#8217;s trip, Marseille was jammed with penniless, bedraggled exiles from all over Europe struggling to emigrate. Long before he left New York, he was aware that most were failing at these attempts, that some were already interned in French concentration camps under primitive and inhumane conditions. His mission, once he arrived, was to assist in any way he could, a handful of people, the intellectual elite of Europe, whose names had been given him by various leaders in American arts and sciences. Fry left behind his wife of nine years, Eileen Hughes Fry, who had expressed a hope that he would return with a French child for them to adopt. He had taken a four-week leave of absence from his job as an editor at the Foreign Policy Association&#8217;s Headline Books. Naively thinking his mission to save the refugees could be accomplished in that short time, he had purchased a return Clipper ticket for August 29. Just before he left New York, worried whether he had the correct clothing, Fry went on a last-minute shopping spree, buying items that he imagined necessary for a month on the Continent. Taped to his leg were a list of two hundred names, the most endangered refugees, and three thousand dollars in cash. As European representative for the Emergency Rescue Committee (ERC), an ad hoc group organized days after the fall of France, his mandate was to help German and Eastern European refugees obtain the visas and other documents they needed to escape from France. Just before he left, Fry&#8217;s conversations with his wife revealed how little he understood public opinion in America regarding the European war and its refugees. He did not realize that it would be nearly impossible to mobilize Americans to support both refugee rescue and the liberalization of U.S. immigration policy. Eileen tried to explain the state of mind of the American people, but he never got it. Fry, who cared deeply about the well-being of all people, could not comprehend the narrow, selfish isolationist viewpoint of a majority of Americans who wanted neither to fight in the war nor to help its victims. This inability to understand American attitudes would hurt and hinder him during his year in Marseille as he came up against them repeatedly while he was dealing with American officials. In some ways, Varian Fry was a likely candidate for the job he had undertaken. He spoke good French and some German, was Harvard-educated, and had a liberal Protestant background with a strong family emphasis on helping others. His paternal grandfather, Charles Reuben Fry, had been a prominent social worker and &#8220;child saver.&#8221; Varian Fry was also a passionate antifascist who would now be able to act on his beliefs. Despite his political predilection for this work, however, his personality did not lend itself to his becoming a foreign emissary. He was outspoken and undiplomatic, and often anxious and moody. In addition, the leadership of the ERC, and Fry himself, had doubts about sending him to Europe because of his lack of experience in this type of political work. In the end, however, he was the only volunteer, and therefore the one to go. His antifascism had been reinforced on a visit to Europe five years earlier, during the summer of 1935, when he witnessed Nazi storm troopers beating Jews on the streets of Berlin. His memory of this incident, of a victim&#8217;s &#8220;hand nailed to the table beside the beer mug,&#8221; influenced his decision to volunteer for the mission to Marseille. Haunted by what he had seen in Berlin, Fry wrote about it. Working at a series of editorial positions from 1935 on, he tried desperately but unsuccessfully to bring public attention to the coming Holocaust. Even front-page articles he wrote for The New York Times about the storm troopers&#8217; brutality and its aftermath did not bring condemnation of Nazi actions. The majority of Americans were not interested. With isolationists dominant in American society, Fry and others with like views were generally ignored. Since September 1939, Germany had vanquished the nations of Europe, including, during the April, May, and June 1940 &#8220;Blitzkrieg,&#8221; Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway, and Luxembourg. &#8220;The enemy is aiming for the heart of France,&#8221; wrote Russian &#233;migr&#233; Victor Serge, &#8220;and Paris is threatened.&#8221; In New York, as they waited for the inevitable invasion of France, Fry and other politically concerned people were frantically trying to figure out how to help their European friends. Fry became involved in a number of different groups that were forming. He lunched often at Child&#8217;s restaurant on Fortieth Street in Manhattan with the dashing and mysterious Karl Frank (aka Paul Hagen) and his second wife, activist-heiress Anna Caples. (It was at these meetings that the groundwork was laid for the formation of the Emergency Rescue Committee.) He joined the American Friends of German Freedom, which Frank had created along with the progressive theologian Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr. When Frank first arrived in New York in 1935, he had read Fry&#8217;s New York Times article about the Nazis beating Jews in Berlin and sought out the young journalist. A psychoanalyst and &#8220;professional revolutionary,&#8221; Frank had been a communist militant in Austria during the twenties, then head of the German Socialist Party in Prague. Niebuhr, formerly a pacifist, was now urging &#8220;Christians to support the war against Hitler.&#8221; Fry also met the daring and glamorous Buttingers. From 1934 to 1938, Joseph Buttinger led the underground Austrian Socialist Movement, then emigrated to the United States with his wife, Muriel Gardiner, the scion of a wealthy American family.* As other bright politically concerned young people gathered around the locus of the Franks and the Buttingers&#8212;including Ingrid Warburg, of the influential banking family, and Eileen Hughes Fry&#8212;Fry became involved in yet a third group, the International Relief Association (IRA). Founded in 1934 by Albert Einstein to aid refugees from Hitler, this group operated independently in Europe for a time. On June 14, 1940, German forces, which had been bombing on the outskirts of Paris, entered the city and marched triumphantly down the Champs Elys&#233;es to the Arc de Triomphe. As French citizens cried tears of &#8220;heartbroken rage,&#8221; Fry and his circle across the Atlantic were also grief-stricken. France fell days later, on June 22 Article Nineteen of the Franco-German Armistice called for France to &#8220;surrender on demand&#8221; to the Nazis all Germans who sought asylum &#8220;in France as well as in French possessions, colonies, protectorate territories, and mandates.&#8221; &#8220; &#8216;Germans&#8217; included Austrians, Czechs, and, in practice, any others whom the Nazis chose to terrorize . . . no one doubted that the Gestapo would soon start tracking down these old enemies.&#8221; At that time, how the French would respond to Article Nineteen was unclear, and as a result all refugees in France felt at risk because the Nazis could demand they be surrendered. When Germany conquered France, the country was divided into &#8220;unoccupied&#8221; and &#8220;occupied&#8221; zones, with the unoccupied sector under a nominal French government headquartered in Vichy. This government, led by Marshal Henri-Philippe P&#233;tain, immediately forbade expressions of French nationalism, such as the national anthem, &#8220;La Marseillaise,&#8221; and substituted &#8220;Work, Family, Fatherland&#8221; for the French motto of &#8220;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.&#8221; *Gardiner has claimed to be the model for the underground hero &#8220;Julia,&#8221; described by Lillian Hellman in her memoir Pentimento. In New York, Fry and his friends, horrified that refugees in France might have to be handed over to the Germans, were appalled by Vichy&#8217;s plans to rid France of its foreigners, particularly Jews. Germans and other European exiles who had fled Hitler were now outcasts in the country where they had sought refuge. They had chosen France for asylum over Belgium and Switzerland. Refugees in Belgium were often pushed back and forth over the French-Belgian border, nor was the Swiss government much better; it was stingy with permits allowing refugees to remain. Although it was difficult for refugees to gain entry into France, once inside, it was easier for them to remain. Unfortunately, after the fall of France, the Vichy government passed legislation preventing refugees from leaving the country. Vichy, if it so decided, could then surrender them on demand to the Germans. As a result, antifascists, writers, &#8220;degenerate&#8221; artists, scientists, labor leaders&#8212;most of them Jewish&#8212;were trapped in France, waiting for the Germans to pounce. Since, from the spring of 1940 on, there were fewer and fewer passenger ships sailing from Europe until &#8220;points of departure . . . narrowed almost to Lisbon and the British ports,&#8221; the refugees&#8217; dilemma was how to get from France to Lisbon, and then to a free nation. This was one of the chief questions considered by Fry and his friends in New York as they held meeting after meeting. But there was no resolution, no plan of action. On June 24, the American Friends of German Freedom wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt asking for her support, which she gave. A day later, the group held a fund-raising luncheon at the Hotel Commodore in Manhattan. Radio commentator Raymond Gram Swing spoke on the plight of the European refugees. Fry, an organizer of the luncheon, was moved by Swing&#8217;s eloquence. Reinhold Niebuhr asked the two hundred guests to donate money, then led a discussion about resolving the problems of the refugees. Many spoke out, including Erika Mann, Thomas Mann&#8217;s daughter. Everyone agreed that a new organization was needed, an amalgam of Einstein&#8217;s IRA and the American Friends of German Freedom, whose sole purpose would be to help the European refugees. Finally, Fry thought, some action. The Emergency Rescue Committee was born that day. Although most of its members were journalists, religious leaders, and activists from the traditional American left, Fry&#8217;s background was more intellectual and humanitarian. His instincts were the same as the other founders of the ERC, but his political agenda was always second to his strong desire to help people. The leaders of the ERC, including Fry, met again a few days after the luncheon, at Ingrid Warburg&#8217;s apartment on West Fifty-fourth Street, to discuss the desperate need to send someone to France to see what was actually going on. Fry said he would consider volunteering if no one else could be found. The ERC took shape with an office at 122 East Forty-second Street and several new members: Methodist minister and University of Newark president Dr. Frank Kingdon; New School for Social Research president Dr. Alvin Johnson; perennial presidential candidate and socialist Norman Thomas; and other leaders in the arts, education, religion, labor, and the media. Kingdon became the committee&#8217;s chairman, David F. Seiferheld was its treasurer, and Mildred Adams its secretary. Harold Oram, a socialist militant who had raised funds for Spanish Civil War refugees in the thirties, would oversee fund-raising, and Ingrid Warburg volunteered to be Kingdon&#8217;s assistant. A national committee to boost the fledgling organization&#8217;s profile included writers John Dos Passos and Upton Sinclair; the presidents of Yale University, Smith College, and the University of Chicago; and journalist Dorothy Thompson. In late June, Fry wrote to the president and received an answer from Eleanor Roosevelt: &#8220;The President has seen your letter of June 27,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;He will try to get the cooperation of the South American countries in giving asylum to the political refugees.&#8221; By early July, lists were being compiled of endangered refugees, including not only Jews but communists, leftist political activists, religious war objectors, and other outsiders. The ERC was still seeking a representative to send to France. &#8220;In the end,&#8221; Fry wrote, &#8220;I volunteered myself.&#8221; He had no &#8220;experience in the underground&#8221; and made his offer &#8220;out of impatience at delay,&#8221; as well as his real desire to do some good. &#8220;I believed in freedom,&#8221; he wrote later. &#8220;I remembered what I had seen in Germany. I knew what would happen to the refugees if the Gestapo got hold of them. . . . It was my duty to help them. . . .&#8221; Despite Kingdon&#8217;s conservative tendency toward safety first, action later, the ERC moved ahead and appointed Fry, an unknown quantity, as its European representative. He would travel to France and meet with as many endangered refugees as possible, helping them acquire visas and other necessary documents so they could escape Europe before they were arrested and turned over to the Nazis.

Pakistan was passed over as a terrorist-cradling rogue nation. But war changes everything, and Gen. Pervez Musharraf was now our partner against the terrorists in neighboring Afghanistan. This was Powell's first face-to-face meeting with the Pakistani strongman, and he was impressed with what he found. Like Powell himself, Musharraf was a pragmatic military man, brimming with self-assurance, equally at ease talking tactical soldiery or political strategy, a man given to thinking three or four steps ahead.

And yet, in the dozens of books about her, specific details of that presidency have been largely excluded. Even more striking, and of greater consequence, is the fact that the histories of John F. Kennedy's presidency are comparably flawed, missing as they do the story of Jacqueline Kennedy and her crucial role. In an effort to fill the gap, I have tried to tell her story in those years with as much attention to the presidency as to the events of her private life. The role of Jacqueline Kennedy is probably less understood than any other part of the Kennedy presidency; equally, her personal story cannot be grasped without seeing it in the context of the unfolding events of one of the twentieth century's most dramatic presidencies. Her life was changed by historical events in ways she had never anticipated. She, in turn, influenced certain of those events in ways that until now have remained largely unexamined.

us,Too Late the Potoroo,"Sometimes extinction is like an execution. There is a time and place, and someone does the deed. The last of the great auks, for example, was clubbed to death off the coast of Iceland on June 3, 1844. A bird collector named Rollo Beck shot 9 of the last 11 hawks known as Guadalupe caracaras on Dec. 1, 1900. The last passenger pigeon died in the Cincinnati Zoo on Sept. 1, 1914. Other species, however, have simply faded into the Darwinian twilight. In A GAP IN NATURE: Discovering the World's Extinct Animals (Atlantic Monthly, $34.95), Tim Flannery has collected the stories of many of the world's now vanished creatures. Each page is an obituary for one of them, giving the concise facts of its life and death. Peter Schouten's graceful accompanying portrait of each of the deceased gives readers a face that says even more about the finality of extinction. The criteria for inclusion in the book -- among them, extinction between 1500 and 1999 and sufficient material to sketch from -- results in a collection of obscure animals from far-flung places (I did not know a bilby from a Bavarian pine-vole or a potoroo from an 'o'o). These species vanished for any number of reasons, including volcanic eruptions and avian malaria. Humanity has been a major factor, out of ignorance more often than malice. Only recently have we even realized a species could disappear. The naturalist Thomas Molyneux, describing the remains of an Irish elk in 1697, wrote, ''No species of living creatures is so utterly extinct, as to be lost entirely out of the World.'' Readers of ''A Gap in Nature'' will know otherwise. Edward McSweegan",2001-11-25T05:00:00+0000

I stepped into Elsie's Submarines, and was warmly greeted by an older fellow in a black knit cap. Elsie's is quite narrow, so it was hard to miss him. He sat at one of the four tables for two, sipping from a giant mug of tea. I nodded hello, and walked to the deli display case. Now I was confronted with a list of 25 regular submarine sandwiches, 12 specialty subs, 6 other sandwiches, salads, soup, chili, mac-and-cheese and desserts. Sandwiches ranged from $2.45 for half a veggie sub to $6.95 for a whole Red Bank Reuben. I ordered the chicken parm. I always order chicken parm. I also picked up a root beer, one of six varieties of Elsie's Own bottled sodas. The cow print on the bottle's label was an obvious tribute to Borden's Elsie the Cow. During my Plainsboro days, I lived just down the road from the tombstone of the original Elsie (1932-1941), whose real name was You'll Do Lobelia. Elsie's Subs opened its doors in 1959. Forty-two years later, I enjoyed my chicken parm and root beer. The older gentleman -- his name is Harry -- struck up a conversation with me. We talked about the Taliban, the Count Basie Theater and Elsie's tuna wrap. (Harry pronounced it ''good.'')

She passed away on Wednesday, November 14 at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, following surgery to repair a broken hip. Mrs. Williams was born in Panama to Audrey and Samuel Clarke. She came to the United States as a child and attended high school and college (New York University) in New York City. She was married to Michael D. Williams, then a medical resident, on March 12, 1944. The couple had two children (Saundra and Steven) and lived together, happily, until Dr. Williams' death in 1989. Dolores Williams took an active role in her children's educations and social lives. She served as President of The Metropolitan Chapter of Jack & Jill, as well as President of the Parent Teacher Association of The Columbia Grammar School, where her son was a student. Having remained at home to shepherd her children through their pre-college years, Mrs. Williams went on to teach at The Modern School, an independent school in Harlem. Following her retirement, she continued teaching as a volunteer tutor at P.S. 180 in Manhattan and in the after school program of The Church of the Masters. In keeping with her motto, ''Do something for somebody,'' Mrs. Williams was deeply committed to the concept of volunteerism and to her involvement in civic and charitable projects. She was an enthusiastic volunteer for The Harlem School of the Arts. Having served on the Board of the institution, she later taught a class there in African History and Culture. She was also a docent at the Studio Museum in Harlem. In the early 1970's she served as President of the Manhattan, Bronx, Westchester Women's Auxiliary to the National Medical Association. Under her leadership, the New York Auxiliary hosted the 1973 NMA Convention, sponsored seminars focused on issues of black women's health and raised a substantial fund for financially disadvantaged African American medical students. Mrs. Williams played a leadership role in founding The Group, a fundraising organization which has contributed impressive sums to not-forprofit institutions, including The United Negro College Fund and The Harlem School of the Arts. Up until the time of her death, Dee remained active in several social organizations, including the Alumni Chapter of the Metropolitan Chapter of Jack and Jill and the New York Hillbillies. She enjoyed playing bridge, loved music and dancing, summers in Sag Harbor, entertaining at home and, especially, spending time with her grandchildren.

Furthermore, for hundreds of photographers from around the world Edith served as a kind of surrogate mother, always ready to provide a home away from home.

He arrived in Vichy-controlled Marseille on Aug. 15, 1940, with $3,000 taped to his leg and a charge from the organization he worked for, the Emergency Rescue Committee, to help save some 200 endangered refugees, mainly artists, writers and intellectuals, from the Nazis. He expected to stay a month, but quickly realized that the job was much larger and more complicated than he or his sponsors had imagined. Those fleeing the Third Reich numbered in the thousands, and the French authorities were cooperating with the Germans by refusing to issue exit visas. Getting anyone out would require subterfuge and deceit, a willingness to take risks and break laws. Fry was up to the job. He stayed for 13 months, until he was thrown out of the country, and assisted approximately 2,000 people, among them an all-star lineup that included Hannah Arendt, Marc Chagall, Max Ernst, Andre Breton, Arthur Koestler, Alma Mahler Werfel and Max Ophuls. Along with a television film broadcast earlier this year, Sheila Isenberg's book ''A Hero of Our Own'' helps rescue Fry from obscurity. And with its stories of desperate exiles, menacing Nazis, forged documents and midnight escapes through the mountains, it reads at times like the script for some old Hollywood movie.

The cause of death was pulmonary fibrosis. She was born in NYC on June 9, 1921, the daughter of the late William Lightfoot and Mabel LaVie Schultz. Her father was the founder and longtime CEO of Shulton, Inc, the makers of Old Spice. She was raised near Morristown, NJ, and attended Miss Beard's School there. She studied at the Juilliard School and graduated with a concentration in music from Sarah Lawrence College in 1943. An accomplished pianist, she became a professional cabaret singer against strenuous family opposition. Adopting Suzanne Gilbert as her stage name, she performed at the Stage Door Canteen, the American Theater Wing and the Biltmore Hotel, among other popular World War II night spots. A member of the Belle Haven Club and the Greenwich Country Club, Mrs. Rigg was well known in Greenwich as a philanthropist to both public and private causes. Throughout her life she was a serious student of both French and Italian, and was a member of the Alliance Francaise in Greenwich. She was an avid traveler, especially to Europe, and an enthusiastic tennis player. Until very recently, she was an active participant in the Fred Astaire ballroom dance competitions, where she won numerous first place awards. Mrs. Rigg was descended from Francis Lightfoot Lee, a signer of the Declaration of Independence from Virginia. Her brother, George L. Schultz, predeceased her. She is survived by three sons, William L.S. Rigg of Williamsburg, VA, Geoffrey B. Rigg of Greenwich, and Douglas G. Rigg of Mill Valley, CA.

Considered a child prodigy, he was offered a scholarship to Harvard which was not accepted because his parents felt he was too young. He attended Stuyvesant High School, and then left for France where he soon found work as a journalist for a major Paris newspaper. After returning to the U.S. he received his B.A. magna cum laude in 1961 and M.A. in Mathematics in 1962 from Columbia University. In 1966, he received his Ph.D. in Literature and the History of Ideas from Columbia where he was a recipient of a Ford Foundation Fellowship and President's Fellowship (1964-66). Dr. Plotkin taught at Columbia College and held professorships at SUNY Buffalo and Yeshiva University where he was Director of the Humanities Division. He has published several books on the philosophy of religion, including Faith and Reason, and Judaism and Tragic Theology which won the Best Book in America Philosophy and Religion Award from the American Philosophical Society in 1974 and from the American Library Association the same year. Dr. Plotkin is also the author of the Milton study, Inward Jerusalem, which explores the philosophic activity of Paradise Lost. He was for several years a contributor to the Encyclopedia Britannica, and for a number of years wrote book, art and film reviews for a variety of national magazines, including Commentary, Film Quarterly and Musical America. One of the last of the ''great romantics,'' he has had numerous poems published in the Minnesota Review, the Cimarron Review, and North American Review, among others. In the early 1960s he was one of three founders of Meridian Books, the first quality paper-back publishing company in America and he served as the firm's editor until it was sold. In 1980 Dr. Plotkin conceived his brainchild, Comtex Scientific Corporation, one of the first to put research data online to telecommunications networks, a company which he took public in 1981. Though ill since his retirement from both the academic and business worlds, he continued to write until he died. He is survived by his beloved wife Kathy Lyles Plotkin, of New York City (also a writer) and his beloved son Avi of Haines, Alaska, his child from a previous marriage.

The moratorium lapsed on Oct. 21. Some governors and state officials have argued that millions of dollars are lost in taxes every year when people shop on the Internet. Others, including online retailers and technology companies, say taxation of online transactions could impair Internet commerce -- particularly during the current recession.

But its operating profit was somewhat stronger than analysts had expected, and there was some evidence that Telekom's downward spiral might have hit bottom. The company continued to be burdened by depreciation costs associated with its investment in third-generation wireless licenses as well as losses at VoiceStream, its wireless company in the United States. But earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation were up about 20 percent over the previous year, at 4.08 billion euros. Operating profit in the wireless division, before interest, taxes and depreciation, more than doubled, to 807 million euros. Profits also seemed to have stabilized in the fixed-line business, which had been hit hard by competition in long-distance service. But analysts remained cautious about declaring that Telekom's turnaround had begun. Deutsche Telekom's chairman, Ron Sommer, above, has said he will reduce debt to 50 billion euros by the end of next year. Edmund L. Andrews (NYT)",2001-11-29T05:00:00+0000

A fierce competitor of Sony and Microsoft in the booming game console business, Nintendo said it had sold 510,000 GameCube machines, which would set a record for the biggest console introduction in the United States. The company has shipped 740,000 of the systems, which sell for $200, about two-thirds the price of Sony's PlayStation2 and Microsoft's Xbox. Nintendo has begun pumping 125,000 more machines a week into the market to keep up with demand. But the biggest surprise, analysts said, was the sharp increase in sales of Nintendo's less expensive hand-held game systems during Thanksgiving week. The GameBoy Advance sold 310,000 units, compared with 145,000 the previous week. Sales of GameBoy Color jumped to 504,000 from 35,000, spurred largely by steep price cuts at two retail chains.
