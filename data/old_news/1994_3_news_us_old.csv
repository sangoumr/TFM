A1 PALESTINIANS RIOT OVER KILLINGS Rioting broke out almost as soon as the Israeli Army lifted curfews in the occupied territories, suggesting that Palestinian fury over the massacre of Muslims in Hebron is not about to subside. A1 RAGE AND ROADBLOCKS Paradoxically, everyday conditions have become even more harsh for Palestinians in the territories since a Jewish settler gunned down Muslim worshipers there last week. A8 Israel's right wing is torn over whom, or what, to blame. A8 President Clinton said ending talks would mean the gunman won. A8 WHERE SPIRE AND MINARET COEXIST The accord hammered out by Bosnia's Muslims and Croats would face its real test in towns along the Zujevina River, which seem much the same except for the minaret rising over one, the spire of a Catholic church over another. A10 Envoys said the Serbs must be persuaded to accept the accord. A10 Fewer troops than anticipated may be needed to enforce a pact. A10 MEASURING RUSSIA'S MISERY Moscow Journal: As Russia conducts the first census of the post-Communist era, respondents do not take kindly to questions like, ""How much money do you make?""

A1 NATION OF ISLAM'S ENIGMA Louis Farrakhan, a preacher who says there is no shame in hatred, is a man of contrasts. While his bodyguards project militancy, his dark suits and bow tie are out of a chamber of commerce meeting. A1 REDUCING CANCER PAIN Millions of adults and children with cancer suffer unnecessarily because doctors fail to treat the pain aggressively, experts said in releasing new Federal guidelines. A1 SOLZHENITSYN'S PROTECTORS Even after Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn announced that he was returning to Russia, from which he was exiled in 1974 for his descriptions of Stalinist terrors, the town of Cavendish, Vt., still guards the Nobel laureate's privacy. A14 COURT HEARS A SENATOR ARGUE For the first time in more than 20 years, a member of Congress argued a case before the Supreme Court as Senator Arlen Specter tried to persuade the Justices to let him sue the Navy for closing the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. A16 CAPITOL HILL TITAN Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia spurred the White House, unions and other groups to action, to defeat a constitutional amendment to require the Federal budget to be balanced.

The move will complicate the coming visit by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 1 The United States condemned China's action. 4 ANGER AT ARAFAT Palestinians have turned against the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, Yasir Arafat, and against the peace negotiations with Israel following the massacre of Palestinians by a Jewish settler. 1 PREVENTION IN JERUSALEM Israel sent security forces into Jerusalem and kept Jews from the Western Wall, their holiest site, seeking to prevent violence on the first Friday of Muslim prayers since the killings in a Hebron mosque. 3 The P.L.O. said Israel had to do more before talks could resume. 3 FROM YELTSIN, CONCILIATION President Yeltsin of Russia denounced the amnesty that set his enemies free, but he made comments about the economy that were seen as conciliatory toward the lower house of Parliament. 5 BOSNIA PEACE EFFORT THREATENED The United Nations military commander for Bosnia said that he feared the peace effort in Bosnia was losing momentum as Bosnian Serbs continued to violate the cease-fire conditions. 5 Croatia's leader formally backed the pact with the Muslims. 5 U.S. PLEDGES AID TO UKRAINE President Clinton met with Ukraine's President in Washington and promised to double United States aid to the former Soviet nation, to $700 million a year. 5 SOUTH AFRICA HOLDOUTS YIELD The Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and an alliance of white separatists reversed their position and registered to put their names on the ballot in South Africa's first multiracial elections. 4 North Korea threatened to break its agreement for inspections. 4 New U.S. pressure on trade does not seem to spur Japan change.39 Tokyo Journal: Slowdown on Japan's high-tech fast track. 4 National 6-10 CLINTON AIDES SUBPOENAED Ten senior White House and Treasury officials received subpoenas for testimony and documents related to an inquiry into a failed Arkansas savings and loan as President Clinton talked with the White House lawyer about his resignation. 1 MITCHELL WON'T SEEK RE-ELECTION George J. Mitchell, the son of a janitor and an appointee to the Senate who became majority leader in less than a decade, startled Washington by saying he was retiring. 1 FEW RESULTS AT G.O.P.

But imagine yourself faced with its 500 robes, meant to be layered in a subtle array of fabrics, colors and designs, each appropriate to a particular season, occasion or mood -- and each, if improperly chosen, the social equivalent of wearing a sealskin coat to a Greenpeace rally. Small wonder, then, as Liza Crihfield Dalby points out in KIMONO: Fashioning Culture (Yale University, $30), that modern Japanese women, who may wear their national costume only a few times a year, can be turned into fashion victims by traditional dress that is ""woven of meanings as much as it is of fiber."" Ms. Dalby, an anthropologist whose 1983 book, ""Geisha,"" described her year as an apprentice in a Kyoto geisha house, acquired her initial learning the hard way -- by attempting to master the skills of ""professional kimono wearers."" That sort of devotion may well be required to stick with some of the essays in her new book, which covers ""such diverse topics as political hierarchy, the esthetics of color, the sociology of gender and the logic of formal systems"" as it traces the history of an ""elegantly anachronistic"" garment that continues to maintain a firm grip on ""the Japanese heart, mind and purse."" Less diligent readers will be content with a parade of intriguing drawings, woodcuts and photographs, and a number of chapters -- particularly those on the shift from native costume to Western clothing (""The Kimono Discovers Itself"") and the kimono in modern Japan (""Women Who Cross Their Legs"") -- that demonstrate, in illuminating detail, Ms. Dalby's belief that while innocents may wear their hearts on their sleeves, we all reveal something of our personality there.

Last year our reviewer, Anthony Heilbut, called the book a ""heartfelt, illuminating study."" CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS By May Sarton. Norton, $8.95. In this 1975 novel, a marriage disintegrates, much as the Government has, in an atmosphere of deception and disillusionment. Poppy Whitelaw, a 50-year-old suburban housewife, superficially blames the Watergate scandal for her departure, instead of her own failure to measure up to her standards. The author has ""suggested a radical solution to the human-bondage-in-marriage status,"" Doris Grumbach said here. ""It is a daring leap."" Norton has also reissued Ms. Sarton's KINDS OF LOVE ($9.95), in which an elderly couple move to the New Hampshire town where they have spent their summers, finally embracing the place and its people fully.

us,Poet of Prague,"Josef Sudek (1896-1976) was a one-armed Czechoslovak photographer with legendary vitality and a poetic sensibility. His long career began with the avant-garde movement that emerged, along with the Republic of Czechoslovakia, at the close of World War I. As the 237 reproductions in JOSEF SUDEK (Takarajima/Distributed Arts Publishers, $125) make clear, the photographer's work reflects little of the social and political turmoil endured by his homeland. His romantic, ironic and occasionally surreal images are rooted instead in art and music. Lugging heavy tripods and cameras over his shoulder, manipulating equipment, film and cloth with one hand, he found sustenance for his vision on his native ground -- in Prague, the Bohemian countryside, his cramped studio -- and never left Czechoslovakia after 1926. Mists, dark shapes, vapor-coated windows and tangles of brush dominate his imagery. Sudek's beloved country seems to have been a dark and muddy place, and the music that inspired him must have been rather melancholy. Between the wars, his commercial work included product advertising and magazine assignments and ranged from modernist constructions of Czechoslovak ceramics to majestic photographs of Prague's ancient cathedral. His later work, better known here, often turned inward, resulting in images like the still life of an egg, its stark beauty glowing against a muted ground of a glass pane. At the same time, however, he took up the panorama camera, producing expansive horizontal landscapes and views of Prague streets. Zdenek Kirschner, the chief curator of prints and photography at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague, knew Sudek for 25 years before his death. His text provides an informative overview of the photographer's life as well as comments on specific photographs. ROSEMARY RANCK",1994-03-13T05:00:00+0000

So it fit their vision nicely last week when Martin Marietta agreed to buy Grumman for $1.9 billion. As its Pentagon contracts dried up, Grumman tried to make it in the real world, but could never quite manage. It can't be that much of a loser, though, because suddenly Northrop got into the act, raising the ante by offering $2.04 billion for it. That's $60 a share, but Grumman stock leapt to $64.75 on Friday -- yes, a bidding war's brewing. What's up? Clearly, even with shrinking budgets, there's still money in high-tech weaponry, and Grumman can be a big plus.

Portraits of the Artist's Homeland","Toward the end of his life, when he was nearly blind, James Joyce wrote to his son, Giorgio: ""My eyes are tired. For more than half a century they've been staring into nothingness and finding a beautiful nothing."" In JAMES JOYCE: Reflections of Ireland (Macmillan, $35), the Irish literary critic Bernard McCabe expertly combines excerpts from Joyce's books with images from the British photographer Alain Le Garsmeur to convey that ""beautiful nothing,"" the special blend of the real and the imaginary that was characteristic of the Joycean universe. Mr. Le Garsmeur's images -- at once remote yet immediate -- evoke the paralysis of the lives portrayed in ""Dubliners,"" the quiet irony that makes the characters so sympathetic in ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"" and so oddly heroic in their ordinariness in ""Ulysses"" and ""Finnegans Wake."" The Bog of Allen, through Mr. Le Garsmeur's lens, is a barren, wind-swept expanse of loneliness -- the burial place of Michael Bodkin, the model for Michael Furey in ""The Dead"" and the inspiration for the beautiful poem ""She Weeps Over Rahoon."" Fittingly, Mr. McCabe reprints both the poem and the ending of ""The Dead,"" Joyce's greatest short story. In the combination of the text and two photographs of the bog -- a wide-angled image of beach and sky, and a close-up shot of broken bits of seashells and sand -- Mr. McCabe and Mr. Le Garsmeur fix the meaning of Stephen Dedalus's question in ""Ulysses"": ""Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?"" The juxtaposition suggests the Joycean insight that the simplest occurrence has cosmic implications. JOELLE ZOIS",1994-03-20T05:00:00+0000

In Michigan last week, the three ideas converged with a vengeance. Shattering the traditional method of financing public education, the state voted to shift most of the burden from property taxes to sales taxes. It will also triple the cigarette tax, to 75 cents a pack, to help pay the bills. Together, these taxes will raise about $2 billion. A key goal of the plan is to smooth out the disparities among school districts. The poorest now pay $3,200 per student each year, while the richest pay $10,400 (that's nothing compared with New York, though, where the high is close to $46,000). Each district will now get at least $4,200, and wealthy districts will face spending limits.

The author describes the tortured inner world she lived in for years, unable to accept human contact and yet longing for it. Detailing her fitful progress toward an independent life and also including advice for families of autistic people, the book offers ""fascinating testimony to an intelligence undimmed by mental turmoil,"" Daniel Goleman said here last year. OPERATION SHYLOCK: A Confession By Philip Roth. Vintage International, $12. In this novel, a writer who just happens to be named Philip Roth and who is recovering from a breakdown discovers that another man is impersonating him quite successfully in Israel. His confrontation with his doppelganger forms the substance of the plot, which involves both men in Israeli politics and a debate over the future of the Jews. Last year our reviewer, D. M. Thomas, said: ""Despite the seriousness of its theme, the book carries the feeling of creative joy. One feels that Mr. Roth feels that he's let rip."" Vintage has also reissued two of the author's earlier books, both with autobiographical elements. MY LIFE AS A MAN ($11) concerns the obsessive and disastrous early marriage of a writer named Peter Tarnopol. Mr. Roth ""can be not only funny but lyrical,"" Morris Dickstein said here in 1974. GOODBYE, COLUMBUS: And Five Short Stories ($11), Mr. Roth's first book, comprises the now famous love affair of Neil Klugman and Brenda Patimkin, as well as various meditations on American Jewish life. In 1959 The New York Times's reviewer, William Peden, called the author ""a keen recorder of an indecisive generation.""",1994-03-20T05:00:00+0000

A fan leaped from the right-field seats, ran over to Jordan and hugged him. On Jordan's first at-bat in the eighth against left-hander Rich Rodriguez, he hit a chopper to third baseman Jerry Browne, who tried to backhand the ball,but couldn't. Jordan was credited with a hit.

I learned that in the Middle Ages, it was firmly believed that the Talmud instructed Jews to use the blood of Christians in the ritual of making matzoh, the unleavened Passover bread, and so the manuscripts of the Talmud were often burned by princes on advice of the church. In the required course in literature, we were studying ""The Merchant of Venice."" The ""enlightened"" teacher made a point of telling us that Shylock's crassness and anger were not an innate characteristic of Jews; it was the unfortunate cast that centuries of obedience to the Talmud had given their character.

us,An American Original,"If anyone deserved the title American Original, it was Isadora Duncan (1877-1927). She was the preternatural free spirit, the one who dreamed up modern dance as a thing of powerful simplicity and economic means aligned with great music, the one who beat a barefoot path for the likes of Ruth St. Denis and Martha Graham to follow. Live free, dance free, be free was her guiding principle. Although many luminaries of her day have described the power of Duncan's dancing, no shred of film footage exists; she steadfastly avoided the movie camera, believing that the absence of an audience would alter her art. The remarkable drawings and photographs in LIFE INTO ART: Isadora Duncan and Her World (Norton, $40) give a vivid sense of Duncan; for example, Abraham Walkowitz's spare, brilliant watercolors and line drawings depict her on stage with her marvelously long curving neck stretched heavenward and her feet kissing the ground. The text -- by Duncan's grandniece, Doree Duncan; Carol Pratl, a dancer and teacher; and Cynthia Splatt, the author of ""Isadora Duncan and Gordon Craig"" -- is, while graceful, a hit-and-run affair that gives minutiae nearly equal rank with major events and screens out such material as Duncan's besotted, suicidal states of mourning. For the grainy details of truth that bring a reader close to this mesmerizing figure, there's still no book to compare to Francis Steegmuller's ""Your Isadora."" There one finds Gordon Craig, the actor and theatrical producer, commenting to Duncan on a photo of her and their daughter, Deirdre -- on how it misses perfection because mother is not looking down at daughter, but straight ahead at the camera. The same photo in ""Life Into Art"" sheds no such specific light. DONNA PERLMUTTER",1994-03-27T05:00:00+0000

Rather, you enter through a carriage drop-off. Kykuit (Dutch for lookout) was Nelson Rockefeller's bequest to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which came as news to family members still living on the property. Consequently, tours of the house and its Italianate gardens will be carefully restricted and chaperoned, lending what small frisson of excitement there is to peering at modest 1970's-styled interiors, complete with reproduction Chippendale furniture and a connoisseur's collection of china. Only a few curtained windows look directly out at the glorious river view. No matter, for it is the formal gardens, with their parterres, boxwood hedges, romantic arbors and linden allees that make the visit so otherworldly. Some 20 fountains account for the ever-present trill of water; every perspective is punctuated with a modern sculpture. But if breathtaking landscapes don't appeal, there are the cars, the oldest a road coach from 1892. The Rockefellers used Kykuit only on weekends. The public is luckier. It will be able to book reservations any time from April to October.",1994-03-27T05:00:00+0000

When the Federal Reserve nudged its rates higher last week, though, big banks like Citibank, Chase and Chemical quickly matched that quarter-point increase in their prime rates. But in the glass-is-still-half-full department, remember that 6 1/4 percent is still a long way from the 11 1/2 percent rate in early 1989 -- not to mention the harrowing 20 percent levels of the early 80's.
