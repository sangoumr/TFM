The program examines the debate over whether college students licensed to carry firearms should be allowed to bring them into class, but its jumping-off point is an attack 50 years ago at the University of Texas at Austin. Charles Whitman, after killing his wife and his mother at their homes, went to the schools signature tower and killed 14 more people, three inside and the rest sniper-style from the top of the structure. One of the men who helped end his rampage was an armed civilian, providing Ms. Hall with an avenue to discuss whether armed students might have stopped some of the more recent campus shootings in the United States. It is, of course, a polarizing issue, one that the program explores from both sides.",2016-08-03T15:12:50+0000

Twenty One Pilots is an amalgam of the sounds made by two decades of the disintegration of arena-size guitar rock. Its platinum 2015 album, Blurryface, is adventurous and ambitious; while remaining resolutely pop at its core, it aspires to rocks pomp without losing sight of how rocks energy now largely exists in other genres. The result is an album that nails familiar dynamics but with different inputs: nerdy rapping, Sublime-esque reggae-rock, head-bashing dance music, pop-punk, emo and industrial, with more than a dash of Broadway theatricality. The duo will headline a pair of shows at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday, Aug. 10, and Thursday. (thegarden.com.)",2016-08-03T15:14:12+0000

Elsa Lanchesters lips were painted redder than her auburn hair for 1935s The Bride of Frankenstein; the makeup artist on the film based her look on a 3,300-year-old bust of Nefertiti, who announced her power by blackening her eyes, reddening her lips and dyeing her nails with dark henna. But when Lanchester appeared on screen as the Bride  Shes alive!  her overdrawn mouth looked dark as hell: Et voil, the modern gothic lip was born. Robert Smith of the Cure, whose lipstick emphasized not the Cupids bow but the corners of his mouth, giving him the moue of a dissatisfied cannibal, was said to inspire the almost-black goth lip of the 1990s; he only, in fact, wore the 60s designer Mary Quants Crimson Scorcher. But what are facts when it comes to what we see? Color depends on perception, and our perception, so dependent on lighting, changes over the years the way light does over the course of a day.

Together the chefs, who met working at Per Se, have created a menu that centers on the islands most elemental staples, re-envisioned as haute cuisine. Red snapper, which in Hawaii is often served simply with ginger and soy sauce, is baked in a sourdough crust and cracked tableside; backyard fruits like mountain apples and guavas are prepared with traditional French techniques; and lowly starches like taro, sweet potatoes and breadfruit are given center stage. This is not meant to be intellectual food, Kajioka says. We really want to represent Hawaii  just in a different way.",2016-08-09T21:46:51+0000

A sort of unearthly physics, these can make select individuals functionally immortal, even as exotic generators churn forth monstrous vector-scrambling storms that disintegrate enemy soldiers down to component atoms. At the core of the technology is the high calendar. More than just a measurement of time, this calendar shapes the mathematical base of the exotic effects. Yet by changing the calendar and thus the underlying math of reality, dissidents can cripple hexarchate technology  a heresy to those in control, who punish dissenters by destroying them whole planets at a time.

That was good enough for Alabama disc jockey Tommy Charles, who started a national Ban the Beatles movement after the original comment. He announced in Birmingham that he accepted the apology, and, in a grand gesture, called off the planned Birmingham bonfire of Beatles records.

At the end of each chapter are some easy recipes for using your homemade creations. Its a cautious book that stresses safety over shortcuts. The techniques may have been passed down by generations of nonnas, but they knew what they were doing: Preserving Italy by Domenica Marchetti (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $23).",2016-08-15T15:48:40+0000

When he wasnt leading seminars or puttering around his comfortable home in a wooded neighborhood five minutes from the Bucknell campus in rural Lewisburg, Pa., Nega traveled abroad for academic conferences and lectured on human rights at the European Parliament in Brussels. He was very much concerned with the relationship between democracy and development, says John Rickard, an English professor who became one of his close friends. He argued that you cannot have viable economic development without democratization, and vice versa. A gregarious and active figure on campus, he rooted for the Philadelphia Eagles and the Cleveland Cavaliers, campaigned door-to-door for Barack Obama in 2008 and was known as one of the best squash players on the Bucknell faculty. He and his wife, an Ethiopian-born optometrist, raised two sons and sent them to top-ranked colleges, the University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon.
