His brain seems full of targeted ads. He accosts a businessman on a cellphone: Dude, whats up? Maxim Magazine, am I right?

Most dont, I think, but among those who did, theres always the question of how, if at all, to bring up the subject in mixed company, whether in the hopes of eliciting either laughter or shock, followed by sexual intrigue mixed with pity. Its easy enough to sell out an evangelical Christian childhood, and plenty of other pens have been given over to the subject of whether its a good idea to raise children in the expectation of being swept up by the Raisin Bran scoop of heaven; I have no wish to dwell on the question of whether I ought to have been taught about the Rapture. No one consulted me beforehand, and I cant see why I should be asked to provide an opinion on the subject now. I was roughly as afraid of the Rapture as I was of being the last person in the house who left the basement at nighttime and had to turn the lights out before I went up the stairs  it felt variously real and ridiculous depending on how close I was to being alone. Afternoons where I was the first person to come home after school and the neighborhood seemed slightly emptier than usual were ideal for Rapture practice, for seeing if I could gin up sufficient panic and remorse at the prospect of being unscooped; playing DC Talks cover of I Wish Wed All Been Ready sometimes helped, but more often than not just made me even more self-conscious of having to trick myself into getting in the mood.",2020-02-11T10:01:00+0000

Cheese, made from cultured milk, was being produced in present-day Iraq around 7,000 B.C., and the Chinese are thought to have started making sake from fermented rice a couple of millenniums later. Over the past decade, chefs and diners have been drawn to all manner of fermented produce, as well as to fermented staples like kombucha and kimchi, sourdough and cider, for their tangy flavors and presumed digestive health benefits. Perhaps surprisingly, so have artists, though for their own reasons. In response to a report that a Chinese factory was making soy sauce out of fermented hair, the Miami-based artist Nicolas Lobo fermented some of his own in 2012. During last Decembers Faena Festival, part of Miami Art Week, the installation artist Emeka Ogboh served a craft ale with notes of lime and pepper meant to nod to the citys diversity of dwellers that hed brewed in the hopes of sparking conversation about immigration and globalization. And Arden Surdam, who lives in Los Angeles and works primarily in photography, is currently collaborating with microbiologists from University of California, San Diego, to develop a bioreactor that will use fermentation to desaturate the pigmentation and decrease the potency of harmful algae blooms.

While it may not have garnered any Academy Award nominations, this comedic drama from Lulu Wang netted a Golden Globe for its star, Awkwafina, and was among the highest-grossing indie movies of 2019. Based on an experience from Wangs own life (or, as the film puts it, based on an actual lie), The Farewell casts Awkwafina as Billi, a young, creative New Yorker who learns that her overseas grandmother (played by Zhao Shuzhen) has a terminal illness. Billi travels with her parents to the northern Chinese city of Changchun, where her grandmother lives, but not before reluctantly agreeing to terms set by the rest of the family: Nobody is permitted to tell the matriarch about her illness. What follows is a bittersweet story that plumbs family relationships and cultural differences. The film has a loose, anecdotal structure and a tone that balances candor and tact, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. Much of the charm and power of this story  about events leading up to a wedding thats also a fake funeral of sorts  come from the palpable sense that it genuinely happened to someone.",2020-02-12T06:00:06+0000

The sequel continues the story of the teenagers Lara Jean (played by Lana Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), whose happily-ever-after ends up being complicated by the fact that, well, theyre in high school, and theyre human. When dealing with a franchise, especially one that was as successful as the first film, you really want to follow up with something that isnt just exactly what the audience would want, Centineo said in a recent interview with The New York Times. But they also obviously want the new recipe to spark the same kind of joy that the original did in its devotees. Or, as Centineo put it: Chicken soup for the soul, baby. Thats what we want.",2020-02-13T06:00:05+0000

On these islands, and on the Caribbean-facing coasts of Central America, styles mingled and migrated, and art had both religious and diplomatic functions; one extravagant gold pendant here, in the shape of a bird with splayed wings and zigzagging necklaces, traveled from Panama all the way to the Antilles. As the Met begins renovations of its Rockefeller Wing, the Caribbean offers its curators a priceless model of how to think about world cultures: never pure but in constant motion and constant contact, diffracted across time and oceans.

THE STRANGE LOVE STORIES OF OGDEN WHITNEY (New York Review Comics, 112 pp., $19.95), edited by the comics aficionado Dan Nadel and the cartoonist Frank Santoro (Pittsburgh). As detailed in Nadels afterword, Whitney was born in 1918, illustrated and invented assorted superheroes (including the Flash and his own, absurd Herbie Popnecker) in his 20s, and served in the Army during World War II. He found later happiness in his 1958 marriage, presumably inspiring the delirious, daftly satisfying romance comics of the early 1960s. Anne Whitneys death in 1970 precipitated his end: He died five years later in a psychiatric hospital in the Bronx.

Clay, Mud and Timber","UNTIL LESS THAN a century ago, the Ayoreo peoples of Paraguay lived nomadically in the Chaco, a hot, dry region of savannas and thorn forests covering nearly 200 million acres spread across western Paraguay, southeastern Bolivia, northern Argentina and a small fringe of southern Brazil, a region once known by the Spanish as the infierno verde, or green hell. The Ayoreo were resourceful in building their modest shelters: Depending on the materials available to them, they might construct a low dome of leaves over branches cut from quebracho (ax breaker) trees, dig the hot earth out from underneath until they reached the cooler subsoil, then mix that excavated dirt with cactus sap, spreading the resultant thick paste between the leaves of the roof above to waterproof it. Settled into the hollowed ground beneath the dome, the interiors were cool and dim, a reprieve from the forests hostility. These shelters dont get recognition for being green or eco-friendly, says the 50-year-old architect Jos Cubilla, whos based in Asuncin, Paraguays capital, a slow-paced riverside city built at the point where the Chaco in the west meets the iridescent meadows and forests that unfurl across the countrys east.

After retirement, he became interested in the fates of those who had been in his class, who saw the 1950s give way to the unrest and transformative changes of the following decade.

us,Earrings That Flicker With Balletic Grace,"When the choreographer George Balanchine debuted Jewels in 1967 at the New York City Ballets new home at Lincoln Center, it was considered the first full-evening abstract ballet. Cynics speculated that, with sparkly costumes and three acts titled Emeralds, Rubies and Diamonds, he was trying to attract a glitzier crowd for the relatively proletarian dance company. But he insisted his inspiration came from the gems in the Fifth Avenue windows of Van Cleef & Arpels, the Parisian jeweler run by Claude Arpels. Claudes uncle, Louis, had been the first Arpels to recognize the elegant symbiosis between gems and the ballet, commissioning the now 124-year-old maisons signature ballerina clips in the 1940s. Van Cleef & Arpels has continued to reference dance throughout its history, most recently with these earrings made in the dangling rounded-pendant balletti style, inspired by the jewel-toned ball gowns worn by women during the Italian Renaissance. While both pairs feature diamonds and pearls, one suggests spring, with a confection of rubies and pink sapphires, and the other gestures toward fall, with emeralds, yellow sapphires and black spinels. Both dance and spin weightlessly in the light, alive with effervescent grace. Price on request, vancleefarpels.com.",2020-02-18T18:00:08+0000

In time, I would acquaint myself with the Civil War-era sisters growing up in genteel poverty in Louisa May Alcotts 1868-69 Little Women (after Beth dies, there are three); and after that, the many geometries of women, sisters and friends, as well as meddling aunts and ineffectual mothers, in the 19th-century novels of Jane Austen. In my marked-up Keds, Id let myself into an empty suburban house after school with my own key, settling down to a package of peanut-butter crackers and a book that seemed to offer three choices of who to be  books so immersive I forgot about watching Mary, Laura and Carrie on television reruns, or those other sisters who immediately followed on channel 13, Marcia, Jan and Cindy.",2020-02-19T14:00:11+0000

To create the works, the 65-year-old artist provides written or illustrated instructions for viewers, inviting them to pose with wooden furniture, plastic buckets or ballpoint pens in unusual, sometimes physically strenuous, positions. The resulting contortions, which Wurm records in photographs, are at once humorous and discomforting: One sculpture comprises a performer pressing their forehead against a stack of three oranges; in another, a spectator is asked to plank their body atop a set of midcentury stools.",2020-02-19T15:00:09+0000

This spring, a new group of young designers, mostly from the British Isles, who have come of age in destabilizing times, have built their collections around declarative, visionary shapes that jettison old ideas about symmetry and balance. Consider the voluminous dresses of Richard Malone, the Irish designer committed to sustainable sourcing and limited production; his red, blue and green confections, made of jersey regenerated from fishing nets and plastic bottles, billowed out from diagonal seams, spilling across the runway in an evocation of rising seas and melting glaciers. Then theres the work of the York, England-based Matty Bovan, whose Hope and Fear collection featured unnerving sculptural forms  like oversize collars and inverted hoop skirts that alluded to dystopian courtiers  swathed in nostalgic Liberty fabrics that didnt so much conform to the body as they did create a protective shield sitting loosely around it.",2020-02-20T17:00:07+0000

What happened is simple enough: In the Minnesota woods in the summer of 1861, Lindberghs grandfather, a recent immigrant from Sweden, got his arm caught in a sawmill. The wound was horrific; the mans beating heart was visible through the hole in his side. He was expected to die. But he refused.

As a result of recent reports received from Soviet Russia, and on account of domestic political exigencies in London, Rome and Tokio, the representatives of those three capitals went as far as possible last week towards the inauguration of their new policy, pending the return of M. Millerand.",2020-02-23T10:00:03+0000
us,24 Tense Hours in Abraham Lincolns Life,"Less than two weeks after delivering his second inaugural address, Abraham Lincoln wrote that he expected the speech to wear as well as  perhaps better than  any thing I have produced. But, he added, I believe it is not immediately popular. He was right on both counts. The speech, barely more than 700 words, is now considered one of the most important in American history. But on the day it was delivered, March 4, 1865, with the Union on the brink of victory in the Civil War, Lincoln had trouble placating his own party, much less his political opponents. And he opted to write words that addressed slavery in grand, religious terms, rather than itemizing the practical ways in which the country would have to begin moving forward. In Every Drop of Blood, Edward Achorn addresses sweeping issues about the war and the precarious state of the nation by narrowing his lens to the 24 hours around the inauguration and the many notable characters around the president that day. Below, Achorn discusses the hostility toward the president, the diaries of Southern women, how Stanley Kubrick is like Lincoln and more.",2020-02-23T10:00:04+0000

They became such a thing everyone did, says Hernandez, and we kind of like to do the opposite. That meant focusing on refining their own aesthetic language and producing elegant clothes that look the way a good idea feels: pleasurably counterintuitive, accessible yet complex, at once inevitable and original. Often the pair achieves this sort of tension by balancing the conceptual with the casual. Its no surprise, then, that when they did decide to collaborate, it was with Birkenstock, the nearly 250-year-old German shoe company whose legions of fans include many a fashion person, perhaps because the iconic chunky sandals can always be relied upon to offset a look that threatens to come off as too dressed.",2020-02-23T10:00:09+0000

Its also drought-resistant, nutritious, gluten-free and better for the soil than the commodity crops like corn, wheat, soy and rice that have become Africas agricultural staples. Once fonio is winnowed and dried, the tiny grains (much smaller than quinoa) can be steamed and used in various ways. (Care must be taken so it doesnt clump and get gummy, and reheating can be tricky.) The book concentrates on traditional African dishes, with ingredients like cassava, okra, baobab leaf and red palm oil. But for wider appeal, like that of quinoa, it needs more recipes like his excellent roasted salmon with cheesy fonio grits. For me, fonio is more like polenta or cream of wheat than quinoa.

War for the Planet of the Apes, the most recent one of those, completes the story of Caesar, the chimpanzee revolutionary played by Serkis. It hinges on a rivalry between Caesar and an angry human colonel played by Woody Harrelson. (Caesar spends much of the series proving that he has more humanity than the humans in it, who want to wipe out his species.) The motion-captured, digitally sculpted apes are so natural, so expressive, so beautifully integrated into their environment, that you almost forget to be astonished by the nuances of thought and emotion that flicker across their faces, often seen in close-up, A.O.

That apprenticeship led to another at Lacroixs headquarters in Paris, during which time Sialelli studied fashion at Studio Berot. After graduating in 2010, he spent four years working on Nicolas Ghesquires and Alexander Wangs design teams at Balenciaga before moving to Acne Studios, Paco Rabanne and, finally, Loewe, where he led mens wear under the creative director Jonathan Anderson until late 2018.

Shechet carved the wood  a sturdy piece of walnut, stripped of bark and cut into a smooth half-cylinder  five years ago, and then left it in her yard. She rediscovered the log, which she described as homely and gorgeous, only recently, drying it in her wood kiln to rid it of bugs. On top of the wood, now encased in metal cladding that the artist referred to as its steel suit, the ceramic pieces form an awkward embrace.
