Despite the photograph, despite the newsreel, despite television, the portrait drawing has kept its place in the hierarchy of human activities. In terms of the mass market, there is no demand for it. Gone are the times when newspaper editors hired the best painters to provide ''an artist's impression'' of the main event of the day in time for the next morning's paper. Publishers are sparing with their favors. Private commissions at the highest level are few. But, all this notwithstanding, the portrait drawing has done rather well.",1986-08-01T05:00:00+0000

In demanding jazz tunes, he reveals his dazzling speed, his shimmering sense of melody and his command of the vibraphone's percussive side - with four mallets, he can sound like a Balinese gamelan. Mr. Hoggard's current engagement promises to be a powerful one, since his quartet includes the drummer Pheeroan Aklaff, the bassist Lonnie Plaxico (an alumnus of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers) and the brilliant pianist Geri Allen.

U.S. companies said they were pleased to end the dispute, which underscored the U.S.-Japan battle for the fast-growing $25 billion world market. [ Page A1. ] The settlement could mean a $2 billion increase in annual sales for American industry. [ D5. ] House conferees accepted limits on I.R.A. deductions as part of their bargaining position on tax revision legislation. [ D1. ] The Senate voted to repeal the so-called windfall profits tax on oil. The surprise move was expected to run into opposition in the House. [ A10. ] Weakness in the manufacturing sector was evident in a monthly survey of purchasing managers that featured gloomy reports in most categories.

Maps. 368 pp. New York: Columbia University Press. $30. IN the 18th century the most dazzling jewel in the crown of France was the city of Paris, the scene of rapid social mobility and fusion, where the nobility and the bourgeoisie shared the same turf with merchants and shopkeepers, artisans and laborers. Paris spawned a heterogeneous society that was permeated by the written word. Parisians of all stripes, educated or not, burned with the fever to write on many topics, including themselves. ''Infected by the craze for life in the great city,'' one aspirant wrote, ''the disease overcame me, and I became an author too.'' People distributed broadsheets, posters, pamphlets and treatises throughout the city. Literate Parisians (around 66 percent of men, 62 percent of women) transmitted news to less literate cohorts, bridging the gap between elite and popular culture. In this heady milieu, a glazier, Jacques-Louis Menetra, wrote and rewrote ''Journal of My Life'' between 1764 and 1802.

The modern Samoans in Albert Wendt's stories are dutiful Christians, their children training to be government clerks on the mainland. But the shades of ancient island gods and ancestors still swirl around their heads, binding them to the mysteries - of nature, mortality and clan honor - that form the background for these gentle but powerful tales. In ''Prospecting,'' several villagers and their European boss pan for gold and unearth the skeletons of a whole town whose inhabitants were slaughtered in a long-ago battle. The prospectors fall into deep grief, which is assuaged only when their boss agrees to bury the skeletons, with complete funeral rites, in their own churchyard. Mr. Wendt also makes room in the teeming Samoan universe for private, solitary rites of passage. In ''The Balloonfish and the Armadillo,'' he describes the hardened pain of a middle-aged man whose father was wrenched away from him as a child. The pain now manifests itself as a chronic migraine he envisions as a spiky Samoan blowfish inflated to its full, menacing size. After his father's death, the hero uncovers the truth about him - reading through his letters, hurling books into a bonfire - which makes it possible to continue his own life. Mr. Wendt generously dusts his stories with ironic, knowing playfulness. In ''I Will Be Our Saviour From the Bad Smell,'' a village is suddenly enshrouded by an abominable smell which unsettles everyone but the hero, for whom the Bad Smell is a precious gift.",1986-08-03T05:00:00+0000

The postwar years marked the rise of such directorial talents as David Lean (''Brief Encounter,'' ''Great Expectations''), Carol Reed (''Odd Man Out,'' ''The Third Man'') and the Powell-Pressburger team (''Black Narcissus,'' ''The Red Shoes'').

Just think of the first time you beat a grown-up at chess or in some other way demonstrated that older and wiser don't necessarily come as a matched set. The Bright Kid as Hero is not, of course, confined to science fiction (think of Dickens and Twain), but he seems to have a natural tropism for the genre, perhaps because so much of the science fiction audience is comprised of Bright Kids or grown-ups wistful for their Orphan Annie years, when ''Tomorrow'' was a tune they could completely believe in.",1986-08-03T05:00:00+0000

(Actually, the story largely ends about 1970, with President Reagan added occasionally as a postscript.)

TRAVELS By Yehuda Amichai. Translated by Ruth Nevo. Bilingual. 137 pp. New York: The Sheep Meadow Press/Persea Books. Cloth, $13.95. Paper, $9.95. YEHUDA AMICHAI'S ''Selected Poetry'' is a retrospective of his life's work thus far, the artistic record of his own highly personal 30-year war on forgetfulness and silence. Mr. Amichai is an essentially autobiographical poet with the rare ability to characterize the complex fate of the modern Israeli, the private individual inevitably affected by the public realm of war, politics and religion. In a way, the poet is like one of Emerson's ''representative men'' transferred to Jerusalem and updated for the second half of the 20th century, a prophet who shuns the traditional role and speaks in the guise of an ordinary Jewish citizen concerned with his people and his place. One of his achievements is to bring to life the individuals behind the blind statistics, to register the human implications of history. Speaking about his own richly felt inner life, he ends up telling the tale of his tribe.",1986-08-03T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"SHALLOWS. By Tim Winton. (Atheneum, $14.95.) Australia is so far beyond the exclusive claims of either the Old World or the New that it may be impossible to live there as anything but a stranger. In this fine second novel by Tim Winton, the 1984 winner of Australia's Miles Franklin Award, a young woman named Queenie Coupar, fifth-generation inhabitant of an Australian whaling town called Angelus, abandons her job as a local tour guide and joins a group of foreign environmentalists who have come to shut down the town's commerce. Thus, for reasons buried and unnamed, she alienates herself from even the common strangeness of her own people. Her grandfather, Daniel, who raised Queenie as his own daughter, broods on the distant lies surrounding his wife's death and nurtures the bitterness of a youthful rebellion that came to naught. Queenie's husband, Cleve, is generally despised as dim and ineffectual. During his night watch on the town pier he reads a journal written a century and a half earlier by Daniel's ancestor - a whaler and maritime deserter who speaks to Cleve's evolving comprehension of the things which make men guilty and survive. Mr. Winton is not always in control of the material. His metaphors are relentlessly literary, from the symbolism of the whales to the sexual sterility of ruthless and decadent tycoons; and the narrative sometimes lingers over pastoral moments while cascading across crucial ones -such as Cleve's search for the journal's missing years - in fewer than two pages.",1986-08-03T05:00:00+0000

There is not much to connect ''Star Trek,'' say, with ''Gilligan's Island,'' or ''The Honeymooners'' with ''Lost in Space.'' At some level, however, they have all become imbedded in the popular culture, even if scarcely an adult can be found who will ever admit to watching anything as vacuous as ''Gilligan's Island.''

IT suited someone to title this book, ''Home: A Short History of an Idea,'' but it is about comfort and the source and spread of domesticity as much as it is about ''home,'' a word which stands for a loosely bagged collection of concepts more complex and distantly historical than this book is prepared to deal with. Nor is it about an idea, really, because there is no treatment of what people have thought about private housing, or the homeland, or alienation or nationality or personal identity. It is devoted to social practices, not social theories. There is little analytic penetration of its principal notions, either, although a term like ''comfort'' badly needs it. Rather the book treats of cultural values like privacy as they became current, or conditions such as cleanliness as they began to be striven for, of feelings toward what is called the cozy or the snug, of relations of intimacy as they were increasingly sought, as well as of the significance of materials, building types, and furnishings in the service of what would become ''home, sweet home'' - including its female rulers, the habits they encourage, the objects they enshrine in their domain.",1986-08-03T05:00:00+0000

When the Kwakiutl Indians found a riverside meadow ''where people gather abundant berries and make good life,'' they named it ''Having Everything Right.'' Kim R. Stafford borrows that name for any encounter of person and place that heals or transforms our lives. These beautiful, sensitive ''essays of place'' celebrate the Oregon country where Mr. Stafford lives and teaches. He blends natural history, Indian myths, pioneer folklore and modern working-class yarns with a pilgrim's spirituality and a poet's intensity. Mr. Stafford, who directs the Oregon Writing Project at Lewis & Clark College, is particularly attracted, as were Thoreau, Whitman and the Beat poets, to eccentrics and outcasts, the people he calls ''local saints.'' We meet, for example, Abe Johnson, the ''bird man of Cline Falls,'' who lives in a shack surrounded by elaborate feeders made of old auto parts and who, like a shaman, coaxes magpies and chickadees to land on his shoulder and pluck food from between his lips. In other essays a place is the central character. In ''A Few Miles Short of Wisdom,'' Mr. Stafford visits the Big Hole National Battlefield in southwestern Montana, where 800 Nez Perce once besieged a troop of United States Cavalry for 36 hours before withdrawing silently in the night. Mr. Stafford finds the spirit of the place on the field, where he discovers small tokens left by generations of Nez Perce who have come by night to honor the dignity of their ancestors.",1986-08-03T05:00:00+0000

But the right-handed-hitting outfielder was shocked to be traded to the Minnesota Twins on Jan. 16 in the deal that brought Tim Teufel to New York and then he suffered a shoulder injury that limited his playing time in spring training. Except for a game on April 29 in Yankee Stadium in which he slugged a home run and four singles, the 6-foot-4-inch, 195-pound rookie saw little action and was sent to Toledo on June 20 with a .156 batting average in 64 times at bat. He was recalled to the Twins four days ago after hitting .294 with five homers and seven stolen bases in 32 games. ''To be productive I just need a chance to play every day,'' he said from Minneapolis. ''And I don't think the Twins called me back to sit on the bench. I felt frustrated this spring, but I'm fine now and I think I'm on an upswing. I'll admit I expected things to be a lot different for me this season, but I'll have to persevere: I've still got confidence in my ability. So far the highlight of my career was that game at Yankee Stadium against Ron Guidry.",1986-08-04T05:00:00+0000

The New York Summer Festival combines the all-day Motown concerts-in-the-park of the Southern Queens Summer Festival with the intimate nightclub performances of the New York Folk Festival, and throws in some arts-and-crafts exhibits and children's games as well. The two festivals, each in its sixth year, are being fused with the help of Folkworks, a production company, and will run through next weekend. Tonight at Speakeasy, a revival of star performers of past folk festivals will feature Tom Intondi, David Massengill, Nikki Matheson and Dave Sear. Shows are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and admission is $6. The club is at 107 Macdougal Street at Bleecker, near the West Fourth Street-Washington Square subway station. Tomorrow, a ''Sixties-Eighties'' picnic at Roy Wilkins Park in St. Albans, Queens, will run from noon to 7 P.M. Featured are Eddie Kendrick and David Ruffin, the former lead singers of the Temptations, known for such hits as ''My Girl'' and ''The Way You Do the Things You Do''; also on the bill are Tommy James and the Shondells.

The measure, which would be binding on the Reagan Administration if incorporated into final legislation, was approved by the unexpectedly large margin of 234 to 155. [ Page 1, Col. 6. ] Another huge car bomb exploded in the mainly Moslem sector of Beirut, killing 17 people and wounding 90 others. It was the seventh terrorist bombing in Lebanon's capital since July 28, and it was followed by two hours of artillery and rocket exchanges across the city's dividing line. The shelling inflicted more casualties in residential areas. [ 1:1. ] Insights from a Soviet defector helped prepare President Reagan for his meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Geneva last November, according to American officials. The officials said the defector, a former K.G.B. official named Oleg G. Gordiyevsky, had provided Mr. Reagan with important insights into the Soviet leader and Soviet policy. They said Mr. Gordiyevsky had advised Washington that Soviet leaders, while relentless in trying to expand their nation's influence, were ready to bargain seriously. [ 1:2. ] An envoy's comment that U.S. policy toward South Africa lacked credibility was ''distorted'' and taken out of context, the State Department said. The envoy, Terence A. Todman, who is black, is Ambassador to Denmark. Mr. Todman, a career foreign service officer who President Reagan was reported to have been considering as a new envoy to South Africa, made the remark Thursday in a news conference in Copenhagen.",1986-08-09T05:00:00+0000

There was no joy in this announcement, nor any justice. Ferrara and two colleagues in the stewards' stand disqualified Allumeuse for a foul clearly committed by another horse. It was not even a close call. Allumeuse was 5 yards away from the incident. It is difficult, though not impossible, to see how the stewards blundered so badly.

The degree to which farmers have already been hurt by months of high temperatures and scant rainfall is apparent from the accompanying tables, in which all figures are estimates.

RETHINKING 'CAREER' HIGH SCHOOL ADMISSIONS","NEW YORK CITY has eight ''educational option'' public high schools, each emphasizing a broad career area. Although these institutions - from Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers in Manhattan to Clara Barton High School for the Health Professions in Brooklyn - are required to admit students of varying ability, the Board of Education says it is concerned that they have become unfairly selective, skimming off too many promising applicants who would otherwise go to the neighborhood high schools. At the eight ''option'' schools, 25 percent of the entering students read above their grade level, 50 percent are average readers and 25 percent read below grade level. Under admissions proposals the board has approved pending hearings next month, 50 percent of the students at the ''option'' schools would be selected at random from the tens of thousands of applicants each year, and 50 percent would be chosen by the schools. (The plan would not affect the four ''specialized'' institutions, such as the Bronx High School of Science.) Jane Perlez, a reporter for The New York Times, discussed the proposals with Margaret Nuzum of the Educational Priorities Panel, a group that supports them, and Saul Bruckner, the principal of the career-track Edward R.

Gorbachev, giving foreign policy-making a more pragmatic bent, according to Western diplomats and Soviet officials. The framing of major decisions, which Andrei A. Gromyko had largely appropriated to the Foreign Ministry in the past, has been shifted to the Communist Party's Central Committee, with Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the former Ambassador in Washington, in a key role. [ Page 1, Column 3. ] Efforts to heal a rift in the P.L.O. have made some progress, according to three factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization that recently held a meeting in Moscow. The assessments were made public in Beirut after the meeting. The Kremlin is said to have been pressing the P.L.O. to close ranks in preparation for a possible Middle East peace conference, in which the Russians would like to take part. [ 8:1. ] National The Senate moved toward approval of a scaled-down $295 billion military programs bill that makes a major reduction in President Reagan's antimissile research program. The Senate was forced into a rare Saturday session because of the push to complete major legislation before the scheduled start of the three-week summer recess Aug. 15. In a separate matter, Republican and Democratic leaders came to a procedural agreement to allow votes on both sanctions against South Africa and military to Nicaraguan rebels.

In Meudon, not far from Paris, the birds, the butterflies and the hares for which he felt a watchful tenderness may flock to the garden of the house that he maintained for 40 years.

Esteemed by some critics, ''The Flood'' has never been popular. ''Its world premiere on June 14, 1962, by way of a CBS telecast, was the only event during Stravinsky's 80th birthday year that did not bring him ovations,'' Lillian Libman writes in her memoir, ''And Music at the Close.'' She continues: ''As for Stravinsky's score, it was so surrounded by Breck Golden Showcase commercials, and a hodgepodge of documentary film clips, eulogies, flood legends, and rehearsal excerpts, plus an introductory minor epic rivalling the speech of Polonius in pomposity, no amount of concentration could afford it a fair hearing.'' The press was generally negative. ''The hour as a whole was enough to retard the progress of the arts in this country by a great deal,'' wrote The New York Times. ''Literature, music, art objects, and by implication their creators, were made to seem insufferably pretentious, disorganized and dull.''",1986-08-11T05:00:00+0000

Yet there is nothing particularly girlish about the music Puccini has provided her: it demands remarkable stamina, and a temperament more endemic to a Tosca than a Susanna.

us,The Arm on Reagan,"Was Ronald Reagan used, and was the White House staff manipulated, by Michael Deaver in landing a $2-million-a-year group of accounts with the South Korean Government? The White House Counsel, Peter Wallison, thinks not; I think so. 1. While representing Philip Morris in its efforts to penetrate the lucrative South Korean cigarette market, Mr. Deaver - in Seoul last summer - approached Kim Kihwan, the Korean President's confidant, with a pitch for the Government's business. He also assured Richard (Dixie) Walker (the right-winger, not the right fielder) that President Reagan had decided to extend his appointment as Ambassador to South Korea. Ambassador Walker knocked himself out to help Mr. Deaver. 2. On Oct. 1, 1985, the eager-to-please Ambassador Walker called Mr. Deaver in Washington. According to the thorough reporting in the Far East by Martin Tolchin and Stuart Diamond of The New York Times, Ambassador Walker says Mr. Deaver suggested that Dr. Kim meet President Reagan in the Oval Office. I suspect the South Koreans were led to believe that the Deaver magic could bring this about. 3. Ambassador Walker that day cabled Gaston Sigur of the National Security Council on the C.I.A. ''back channel,'' circumventing the usual State Department communications. In that cable, which has been read to me, Ambassador Walker said that Dr. Kim was on his way to Washington carrying a letter about Korean-American trade from the Korean President to the U.S. President, and that having him deliver the letter in person would dramatize its importance. Mr. Deaver's hand was concealed: at first, Ambassador Walker tried to hide his own role in setting up the meeting but, when recently reminded by the White House of his cable's existence, called The Times back later with the painful truth. 4.",1986-08-14T05:00:00+0000

In most cases the stuck-on felt can be removed by spreading a light film of salad oil or lemon oil over the area and letting it soak for about an hour, then rubbing it off with a clean dry cloth.

The key problem, according to these sources, is how to build a structure that will effectively entomb the still-warm reactor but not trap so much heat that a new fire or explosion could occur. [ Page 1, Column 1. ] A strategy that would constrain tests of space-based weapons by the United States and the Soviet Union for up to 10 years has been suggested by five former American policy makers. The former officials, who served in the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations, recommended that the United States follow what is called a ''restrictive'' interpretation of the 1972 treaty limiting antimissile defenses. They also said the United States should continue to abide by the numerical limits on long-range nuclear weapons in the unratified 1979 treaty on strategic arms. [ 1:5. ] National House and Senate negotiators struggled over the final details of legislation designed to make monumental changes in the Federal income tax system. The basic principles and elements were locked into place as the rest of Congress began the summer recess. But six of the 11 Senate conferees objected to one aspect or another of the package, and House members were holding out for more favorable treatment of middle-income taxpayers. [ 1:6. ] A self-sufficient path to space is abandoned as a goal of the space shuttle with President Reagan's order that NASA get out of the commercial launching business, aerospace experts said.",1986-08-17T05:00:00+0000

David Halberstam examines the recent history of four important news-gathering organizations - The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, Time Inc. and CBS - in what Richard Rovere, writing in these pages in 1979, called an ''important and admirable book.'' It is, he said, ''a prodigy of research and tendentious but sharply focused narrative and analysis.'' For a different perspective on the press, Quill/Morrow has reissued THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY ($7.95), in which Jody Powell, former press secretary to President Carter, takes aim at the White House press corps. ''It is a lively performance, full of spleen and not a little gall,'' Lester Bernstein said in The Book Review in 1984. LOVE ALWAYS, by Ann Beattie. (Vintage, $5.95.) A main character in Ann Beattie's third novel is Nicole Nelson, a 14-year-old soap opera star who comes to spend the summer in Vermont with her Aunt Lucy. ''Miss Beattie is one of the most graceful writers we have,'' Alice Hoffman said here last year; ''at times her prose is nothing short of exquisite. It is such sheer pleasure to read the dialogue in 'Love Always,' we almost don't care what the characters say to one another. But when we really do listen, the absence of desire is more than unsettling - it's chilling.'' THE LIFE OF HENRY BRULARD, by Stendhal. Translated by Jean Stewart and B. C. J. G. Knight.

He looks as if he had been blown in by the wind (the wind of good fortune, among other zephyrs), toddling at a tilt, like a rowboat rocking in a high tide. A bowler rakishly covers his brow, and, as we soon discover, the bowler is his brow. That hat is as integral to his face as are his eyes and mouth, both of which are also in perpetual comic motion.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"TUG OF WAR: The Battle for Italy, 1943-1945. By Dominick Graham and Shelford Bidwell. (St. Martin's, $24.95.) The tug of war in the title of this fine military history is not, as one might suppose, between Allied and German forces, but among rival Allied commanders, primarily the British and Americans. Dominick Graham, a professor of history at the University of New Brunswick, Canada, and Shelford Bidwell, author of ''The Chindit War'' and other historical works, take both a psychological and a tactical look at a campaign ''full of examples of the pitfalls of coalitionary war, and [that] offers an insight into Anglo-American relations at a period fraught with mutual dislike and suspicion.'' American and British commanders, the authors write, ''despised each other for lack of drive, attacking in insufficient strength and lack of appetite for combat.'' Even where animosity was absent, personality played a part: Mr. Graham and Mr. Bidwell describe Dwight Eisenhower, commander of Allied forces in Europe, and Sir Harold Alexander, the British commander in chief, as ''easy-going'' and ''malleable,'' and write that ''neither could make a military plan and stick to it through political and military vicissitudes.'' The book is a triumph of organization; the numerous threads of suspicion, intuition, logic and military necessity are displayed clearly, and their countless points of intersection analyzed. The result is a remarkably lucid account of a complicated campaign. The war in Italy, begun with the vain hope of an uprising by the Italian Army against the Germans, saw, among other things, a sit-down strike by British troops, was hampered at many points by weather and geography as much as by the enemy, and throughout was viewed by the Allied governments as little more than a diversion; the war in the Pacific and the invasion of Europe were the important things.",1986-08-17T05:00:00+0000

Weitzman recalls that she, like many other women, was ''enthralled.'' Here was a way to avoid long, messy trials and acrimonious battles over who was to blame for a failed marriage. The partners became equals under the law. Eventually all states except North Dakota enacted some kind of no-fault law. The results were dramatic, but unexpected. Within the first year after divorce, women and children suffered a 73 percent drop in their standard of living, while men experienced a 42 percent rise, Dr. Weitzman reported in ''Divorce Revolution: The Unintended Social and Economic Consequences for Women and Children in America,'' a study of the effects of the California law. Today, legislators, women's groups and others are citing these and similar statistics in their efforts to modify the laws. Earlier this month, Governor Cuomo signed two amendments to New York's ''equitable distribution law.'' Dr. Weitzman and other experts last week discussed the economic consequences of divorce at the American Bar Association's annual meeting in New York. Excerpts follow.",1986-08-17T05:00:00+0000

Once or twice they have a winged look, as if they were fragments of Greek sculpture, and just occasionally they can be read as human figures, or pairs of figures. There are times, too, when they look like Abstract Expressionist paintings that have gone on the rampage in the third dimension.

us,Q&A,"Q. What causes men to go bald more often than women? A. Men go bald because of three factors: the secretion of normal male hormones, a sex-linked inherited trait and advancing age, according to Dr. John F. Romano, a dermatologist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Dr. Romano said that when male sex hormones such as testosterone break down in the body, their byproducts cause hair follicles to degenerate and inhibit the formation of new hair. Because of the inherited trait, some men have hair follicles more susceptible to the breakdown of the hormones, leaving them predisposed to balding. With age, the condition becomes more pronounced, Dr. Romano said. Doctors are almost certain of the link between baldness and male hormones because of studies performed in the Middle East during the 1940's that showed a complete lack of baldness in men who had been castrated before puberty, when males begin to produce large amounts of hormones, Dr. Romano said.",1986-08-19T05:00:00+0000

As cedar wood ages, the aroma is lost because surfaces dry and the pores tend to get sealed with dust and dirt. In most cases sanding with fine sandpaper and then vacuuming and wiping down with a dry rag is all that is needed to restore the cedar's aroma. If this doesn't help, then cedar oil may be your best bet. Q. I am looking for a door hinge designed to raise the door slightly as it opens to permit the door bottom to clear a thick carpet on the side toward which it opens. Do you know where I can locate such hinges and can you tell me if installing them would require any modifications to the door or the door frame? A. Door hinges of this type, commonly referred to as rising butt hinges, are sold in many large hardware stores and building supply houses. If they don't have them, they should be able to order them for you. You can also order them from some mail-order houses, including Constantine's, 2050 Eastchester Road, Bronx, N.Y. 10461, telephone 800-223-8087. Q.

The film, which chronicles the severe midlife crisis of a Munich man who is an architect, paints a picture of modern-day West Germany that isn't very pretty -cold, inhuman, meaningless, aggressive, obsessed with its past and uncertain of its future. Even sex, which the film's characters pursue indefatigably, is largely second-hand. Leering salesmen stare lecherously at a woman trying on new outfits, a cabdriver asks his passenger to undress so he can ''just look,'' men stare at pictures of nude women in magazines while watching television. Like work, love and success, sex is ultimately unfulfilling. These characters, like many of the restless young Americans of the 1960's, would have understood Mick Jagger when he sang, ''I Can't Get No Satisfaction.''",1986-08-22T05:00:00+0000

In the past, the Feelies have been one of rock's more reclusive bands, disappearing for years at a stretch; with the release of their second album, ''The Good Earth,'' they are back on the club-and-concert circuit.

''The research is remarkably thorough,'' he said, ''and nothing he has found .c.c. shakes his optimism.'' Indeed, the tone is one of ''satisfaction or fulfillment.'' THE OLD GRINGO, by Carlos Fuentes. Translated by Margaret Sayers Peden and the author. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $5.95.) ''Sensual and mind-pleasing'' is how Earl Shorris described Carlos Fuentes's novel in these pages in 1985. The tale is an imaginative conclusion to the life of Ambrose Bierce, the American writer who vanished in Mexico in 1914. The author, he said, ''takes the reader into the mythical, sexual, political, economic, moral maelstrom of inter-American relations.''",1986-08-24T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE BAY OF SILENCE. By Lisa St. Aubin de Teran. (Franklin Watts, $15.95.) This disturbing novel of mystery, obsession and madness begins symbolically in Sestri Levante, a strange haven on the Italian Riviera also called ''the two-faced place.'' There a promontory divides two bays, the Bay of Fairytales and the Bay of Silence, which gives this novel - Lisa St. Aubin de Teran's fourth - its title. The novel, like one of its two main characters, is ''obsessed by twos,'' by truth and secrets, by speech and silence, by madness and dual and dueling definitions of reality. Twins, alter egos and schizophrenia add to the double weave of the book's fabric. The story is told in alternating narratives by a husband and wife who first honeymooned in Sestri Levante 13 years earlier and return to put their fractured lives back together. William is a graphic designer whose bitter childhood taught him that ''rock bottom is always lower than you think.'' Rosalind is a beautiful, strange and dreamy actress who ''grew up used and abused and neglected; almost starved by affluence.'' As an adult she becomes promiscuous yet detached, floating in a ''sea of non sequiturs,'' her dual nature alternating between a need for stability and a need for change. The couple have twin girls and then a baby son. The infant's mysterious death coincides with his mother's schizophrenic breakdown, and leads to the troubling climax of the book. All the details of menace and decay are told in a voice of confidence and control that is distinctly this novelist's (her previous novels include ''Keepers of the House'' and ''The Slow Train to Milan'').",1986-08-24T05:00:00+0000

For instance, Alec McCowen is to be found in John Dexter's West End revival of T. S. Eliot's ''Cocktail Party,'' and Faye Dunaway is a short walk away, displaying her considerable emotional range in Harold Pinter's production of a play called ''Circe and Bravo.''

It will run for 90 minutes, although it is doubtful that even the few viewers on hand then will get past the first 10 or 15. ''Born in Flames,'' part of Channel 13's ''Independent Focus'' series, looks very much like a home movie. Friends, colleagues and relatives ham it up. Meanwhile, there is a solemn scenario, whose purpose a character in the film tries to explain. ''It is the story not just of women's oppression,'' she says heatedly, ''it is the story of sexism, racism, bigotry, nationalism, false religion in the black and state-controlled church, the story of environmental poisoning and nuclear warfare.''

Others are among the most successful examples of what can be produced by machine for the mass market. Despite such diversity, design in general is moving in simpler directions. Architects are taking a more purely modern approach, getting their inspiration from those masters who epitomize clean lines and spare spaces. Interior design is getting simpler, too.

I plan to sand and clean the surfaces thoroughly, apply a coat of a stain-killing primer or sealer, then apply two coats of oil-base enamel. I don't know if the old finish is varnish or lacquer, but I cannot do the job if the old finish must be removed first. Also, if painting over the old finish will cause problems, I won't do it. Will the sealer I plan to use as a first coat keep the new paint from peeling? A. If you sand thoroughly and make sure all wax, polish and soil is cleaned off, then you should have no problem with paint peeling, as long as the varnish or other finish is sound and sticking firmly. In other words, if the varnish (or lacquer) underneath lets go, it will take the paint off with it. Using the stain-killer as a first coat is a good idea because that is the best way to make certain the stain color won't bleed through the paint. The sealer will also help insure a good bond when the paint is applied. Q. My apartment is on the top floor of an old five-story apartment house and the roof is tarred, making summer heat a problem. Is there a coating I can apply to the roof surface to help reflect away the heat, and will coating the windows with a reflecting material also help? A.

So upsetting is this downward trend that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. issued a self-evaluation a year ago actually suggesting, among other things, that some working people might feel more comfortable joining independent associations rather than their industry's union. Has the labor movement lost that much of its drive and vision, critics of the report asked.

The first of these books gives us an excellent picture history of that brutal and complex conflict. We see the prelude to the war, its very first days, the atrocities committed by both sides, the battles and the heroism of the combatants; at the end we see the smug smiles of the victors and the tragedy in the faces of the vanquished. Most of the pictures are photographs; by far the most artful are the posters, and the Republic, which lost the war to the Nationalists, gets the best of it here. There is a photograph of a Nationalist pilot at his cockpit controls as he prepares to drop his bombs. Man, that unruly beast, bears accurate witness to his own crimes. One of the finest posters esthetically, a dissolute face alongside bottles of wine, reads: ''A drunkard is a parasite. Let's eliminate him.'' In a striking photograph, volunteers of the anti-Stalinist revolutionary group P.O.U.M. are lined up ready to depart for the front. On the far left, standing head and shoulders above the others, is George Orwell. The final chapter contains a remarkable painting by Xavier Bueno titled ''The Spanish Soldier'' and inscribed ''To my friend . . . who died in defense of Madrid.''

Costs vary according to a boat's comfort and what its owner believes it is worth, but generally a week's charter will cost around $2,000 for two people, $4,000 for four, $5,000 for six and much more for larger, more luxurious craft. These rates include the crew (a skipper and cook and, on larger boats, one to three assistants as well), all meals and, often, an open bar. The high season runs from mid-December to the end of April; outside that period, rates are generally about 10 percent less.

KARAJAN'S FOURTH CYCLE OF BEETHOVEN'S NINE","Complete recordings of Beethoven's nine symphonies, like complete recordings of Wagner's ''Ring,'' tend to occupy a special niche in the hearts of music lovers and record producers alike. As the procrustean bed of Romanticism, the very salt of the musical earth, the Nine are considered the backbone of any serious record collection. From a marketing point of view, they form an ideal product. Unlike Brahms's four symphonies, of which there are too few to give the buyer the thrill of purchasing a really substantial chunk of history, or Mahler's 10 (if one includes, as Kubelik and Haitink have, the unfinished 10th), which are simply too long to yield a manageable package, and still debatable as to musical value, Beethoven's nine symphonies strike the happy balance of aggregate length and unequivocal respectability. Like complete editions of Shakespeare, therefore, The Nine are released in boxed sets conspicuous for their dignity - sober gilt lettering on the outside, cover embellishment usually incorporating a suitable portrait of the composer or a soulful one of the maestro in question, and a substantial book of essays within.",1986-08-31T05:00:00+0000

us,WHEN TV LOOKS AT THE SHADOWY WORLD OF DRUG ABUSE,"Television, as has been remarked, does not necessarily tell us what to think, although it does tell us what to think about. Accordingly, the drug problem is now on the national agenda. Television both reflects the agenda and helps shape it; the relationship is almost symbiotic. Drugs are now a legitimate preoccupation of Congress and the White House; the networks, therefore, are preoccupied, too. And yes, there is a chicken-and-egg question about television and the national agenda, although the question does not apply to all issues. Men and women who run for office, especially in an election year, may promote issues because the promotion looks good on television. At the same time, television may promote some issues itself. When it does, however, fervor and interest on the part of office-holders rise. If television is worried about an issue, political constituents must be worried. Politicians react to television; television reacts to politicians. It is one way the agenda is shaped, and it is not an entirely bad way to shape it.",1986-08-31T05:00:00+0000

So the production was canceled. On other occasions, the authorities themselves have intervened to ban black protest theater, or to restrict the size of the audience that might see some works deemed to be subversive or inflammatory. ''We are sandwiched,'' said Matsemela Manaka, one of South Africa's best-known black playwrights, ''between the state and the climate inside the country.''
