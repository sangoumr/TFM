Sam Patch, who enjoyed brief fame for jumping off waterfalls before plunging to his death over the Genesee Falls in 1829, was a decidedly minor figure in American popular history. Making him the subject of a 361-page novel is a risky business -especially when the story is told by Sam's pet bear, Bruin. Luckily, Bruin is very likable. Honest, loyal and brave, he has a knack for knockabout, punning narration, well suited to his creator's (perhaps debatable) vision of Jacksonian America as a place where people jes' natur'ly jumped off waterfalls, shot b'ars in public places and fell down drunk a lot. Unluckily, Bruin also tends without warning to start sounding like a furry Wittgenstein: ''Was [Sam] saying . . . that the old quantitative, spatial way of looking at things was as primitive and false as the related error of thinking that we in fact do endure?'' A 500-pound bear who writes that way might be funny in some contexts, but William Getz takes him seriously. Set in a world where the men all talk like Mike Fink on his keelboat, the effect is jarring - Davy Crockett meets Davy Hume. Something else slows the fun of ''Sam Patch''; like Bruin's faithful, bedraggled she-bear (whose ''low, plaintive whine'' opens the book), its women are generally sad and dependent. A heroine as bold as Sam (or Bruin) could have helped justify the novel's considerable length.",1986-11-02T05:00:00+0000

It is, however, this admixture that makes him, in many of his books, a true representative of a Japan which was, like Mishima himself, violently Westernized, and yet remained distinguished by certain immutable characteristics. The way in which, in Mishima, the traditionally Japanese elements rose to the surface and burst in his death make him, furthermore, a witness to and - in the etymological sense of the word - a martyr of the heroic Japan to which he had returned, so to speak, against the tide.",1986-11-02T05:00:00+0000

Although a few of Bridge's first disks featured Mr. Starobin's work, the guitarist and his wife, Rebecca, who runs the label's business side, were intent on keeping Bridge from turning into a vanity press. Thus, Mr. Starobin's recordings account for less than a third of the label's catalogue, and Bridge's first CD's are devoted to electronic and orchestral works by Tod Machover, and to two installments of an ''American Pianists'' series.

us,New Wing Conquers the Los Angeles County Museum,"In the vast flurry of postwar museum-building in America, one building had to come out at the bottom of the pile, and it is probably the original complex of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Indeed, this is arguably the least distinguished major museum building in the country. Designed by William Pereira and completed in 1965, it is a complex of three fussily decorated boxes placed around a central court, an arrangement that over the years has proven neither practical nor attractive. The buildings are an unhappy mix of corporate modernism and small-time, provincial glitz, and they do not display art very well, either. Moreover, their lack of sophistication belies the importance Los Angeles now possesses on the national art scene. The museum is a relic of an age, less than a generation ago, when Los Angeles was something of a cultural backwater.",1986-11-02T05:00:00+0000

But last week, at a mine workers' convention here, Rich Trumka, the 37-year-old lawyer who is now the union's president, took steps that will probably mean a return to the fold.",1986-11-02T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION: IN SHORT,"TO BE A SLAVE IN BRAZIL: 1550-1888. By Katia M. de Queiros Mattoso. (Rutgers University, $35.) We have grown accustomed to thinking about slavery as a singularly brutal institution, the slave as commodity, totally subjugated to the will of a master. Historical research, however, has unveiled a far more complex story, albeit one rarely made available to a general reading public. Katia M. de Queiros Mattoso's book was written for a popular audience, in laymen's language and without scholarly references and footnotes. A masterly text, nicely translated from the original French (1979) by Arthur Goldhammer, ''To Be a Slave in Brazil'' traces slavery in Brazil over 300 years, from the capture of slaves in Africa to the abolition of the institution in 1888. Ms. Mattoso, a social historian of Brazil, describes in rich detail the day-to-day lives of that country's slaves. She reconstructs their lives from a lode of official and private documents - government regulations, police and tax records, licenses, wills, estate inventories, manumission papers, religious archives, marriage contracts and dowry statements. What emerges is a stunning tale of social and economic relations, of extraordinary cruelty occasionally mitigated by human circumstance and of class and regional diversity based on types of economic activity. The book discusses the demography of slavery and European immigration, and the attribution of status according to shadings of color, education, language and skill. Brazil's famous law of the ''free womb'' (1885) theoretically freed all children born to slave mothers, but only to be servant-wards of the master or the state.",1986-11-02T05:00:00+0000

A decade ago, I sped wildly through Madrid at the wheel of a Volkswagen station wagon with one of my best friends stretched out in the back stricken with a heart attack; colleagues, we had shared the stresses, and joys, of the reporter's existence in Saigon and Beirut, the same type-A, roller-coaster life style. It didn't take much analysis to realize that if I didn't do something about taking care of the one body God gave me I would probably meet a similar fate. (My friend recovered and is doing fine.) So I started to run. The first time around the block in suburban Madrid - in tennis shoes - I thought I wouldn't make it. But, as any jogger knows, the beginning is the most daunting part, and soon I was making a 25-minute trot down my street in Aravaca, through the underpass of the highway leading to Avila and Segovia (past a ferocious but mercifully chained yapping watchdog), left past a cemetery (visited on the weekends by black-creped families bearing bright flowers) and along a broad open space of hayfields to the walls of the Zarzuela Palace, where King Juan Carlos and his family resides. (Palace is a misnomer: It's really a mock-Tudor country house enveloped in an oversize park inhabited by deer.)",1986-11-02T05:00:00+0000

A.In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun appears lower in the sky as it heads toward its winter solstice - the time when the sun is farthest south of the Equator, according to Sherwood Harrington, an astronomer with the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. Because the earth's axis is tilted about 21 degrees, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun in winter. As a result, the sun appears lower in the sky, Mr. Harrington said. At the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun; to people who live there, the sun appears higher in the sky. Q.What is mitral valve prolapse, and what dangers does it pose? A.Mitral valve prolapse is a common heart condition in which the mitral valve, between the left atrium and the left ventricle, is deformed. Normally, the mitral valve prevents blood from flowing back from the ventricle to the atrium instead of on to the rest of the body. A deformed mitral valve has excessive motion and moves past the normal ''closed'' position, thus allowing backflow of blood. The condition affects about 15 percent of the population but is most common in women. For the most part, the condition is innocuous, according to Dr. Richard H. Kay of New York Medical College. But he said mitral valve prolapse had been associated with heart murmurs, palpitations, infections and other conditions.",1986-11-04T05:00:00+0000

One of the best is Leoncavallo's ''Zaza'' (1900), a typically steamy verismo tale of an actress, her mother, her old lover, her new lover and the latter's wife and daughter. But if the operatic world takes up ''Zaza'' again, as the New Jersey State Opera did in a well-rehearsed and creditable revival here this evening, it will take some thought to decide precisely what to perform.

In private talks outside the meeting, they are expected to take up these Soviet-American issues: Arms Control 1. ''Star Wars'': The Soviet Union and the United States are talking about a commitment to adhere for 10 more years to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. They differ about how to interpret the treaty and how much research would be allowed on the ''Star Wars'' space-based missile defense program. At the Iceland meeting, the Soviet Union said it wanted to limit research on space-based systems to the laboratory. Since then, the Soviet Union has hinted that it may take a more flexible position, and American officials want to follow up these hints. It remains to be seen whether the United States will agree to strict limits. The United States is insisting on the right to interpret the ABM Treaty in a loose way that would allow testing and development of space-based systems. Amerian negotiators of the 1972 treaty do not believe that this loose interpretation is valid. 2. Medium-Range Missiles: In Iceland, the two sides agreed to eliminate all American and Soviet medium-range missiles from Europe. The Soviet Union would be allowed to keep 100 warheads on medium-range missiles in Asia and the United States 100 warheads on medium-range missiles within its own territory. The Soviet Union now inists that such an accord be linked to a resolution of the dispute over ''Star Wars.''",1986-11-05T05:00:00+0000

There are other flagstone floors in the house that I did not coat with linseed oil at the time and I would like to do these now. However, I have forgotten whether I used boiled linseed oil or raw linseed oil. A.If you are going to use linseed oil for this, then boiled oil is better rather than raw (raw oil may not dry properly). However, I would not recommend either. Linseed oil is subject to mildew, especially if applied too heavily, and it will darken with age. Also, if the excess is not thoroughly removed from the surface it may get sticky and will attract and hold dirt. You're better off using a penetrating sealer formulated with synthetic resins. Sold in paint stores and by dealers who sell flagstone, there are a number of these products on the market to treat and seal (and darken) the stones the same way linseed oil will, but they are easier to apply and will generally last longer. Q.I recently wallpapered a large hall with a ''string-type'' wall covering. Although I tried to avoid it, some shading occurred. In addition, there are stains along the edges or seams, even though I used the vinyl paste recommended by the manufacturer (apparently the edges of the paper soaked up more of the adhesive). Is there a stain, paint, dye or other material I can use to eliminate this shading and discoloration without ruining the texture of the paper?

us,Jackson a Free Agent,"October has been a special month in Reggie Jackson's career because he has made a name for himself -Mr. October - by producing significant hits in postseason games. November has become significant too, however, at least in a five-year cycle. For the third time in his career, Jackson filed yesterday for free agency. He did it first in 1976, leaving the Baltimore Orioles for the Yankees, and he did it again in 1981, leaving the Yankees for the California Angels. The Yankees didn't want to keep him five years ago and the Angels apparently aren't interested in re-signing him now. His age - 40 - and his 1986 performance - .241 average, 18 home runs, 58 runs batted in - are two reasons teams might shy away from signing him. Another possible reason: He is a Type A free agent, which means that a team that signs him would have to give up its first- or second-round choice in the amateur draft next June. . . . The Angels also announced that Ruppert Jones, the 31-year-old outfielder who is a former Yankee, would not be offered a contract next season. Jones batted .229 with 17 homers and 49 r.b.i. in 126 games with the Angels last season. . . . Other players who filed for free agency yesterday were Doug DeCinces, Jackson's Type A teammate, who hit 26 homers and drove in 96 runs; Terry Forster, whose option the Angels chose not to pick up; Larry Herndon of Detroit and Lynn Jones of Kansas City.",1986-11-08T05:00:00+0000

The Juliette of Gounod's gloss on Shakespeare's tragedy was a young and comparatively green Italian soprano, Cecilia Gasdia, while her lover was the veteran Alfredo Kraus, a distinguished Spaniard who may be the finest exponent of French opera among active tenors. Both singers were new to their parts in this house; in fact, it was Miss Gasdia's Metropolitan debut.

us,"MENCKEN: DON'T BE SO BULLHEADED. LOVE AND KISSES, DREISER","WHEN H. L. Mencken and Theodore Dreiser met in 1908, Mencken was a young, ambitious journalist from Baltimore and Dreiser, in his late 30's, was just reaching the end of a long abstinence from the writing of fiction, brought about in part by the poor reception accorded ''Sister Carrie'' in 1900. The two men corresponded until Dreiser's death in 1945, and the letters record a fruitful literary collaboration - the initially better-known Dreiser opened doors for Mencken; Mencken the critic gave Dreiser a theoretical structure that both supported and fed on the novelist's renewed output, beginning with ''Jennie Gerhardt'' in 1911. But as the excerpts below suggest, the men's friendship was also fraught with conflict. Mencken often criticized Dreiser's writing, and Dreiser was equally critical of Mencken's editorial leadership of two prominent periodicals of the teens and 20's, Smart Set and The American Mercury. The two men also disagreed on such issues as the nature of Soviet Communism and the political significance for America of the Great Depression. Most of the 1,200 letters the two men are known to have exchanged between 1907 and 1945, many of them previously unpublished, will be issued in January by the University of Pennsylvania Press as ''Dreiser-Mencken Letters,'' edited by Thomas P. Riggio, an associate professor of English at the University of Connecticut. The Power of ''Jennie Gerhardt'' Baltimore, April 23rd. [ 1911 ] Dear Dreiser:-",1986-11-09T05:00:00+0000

For some label heads, the transition might seem jarring; for Mr. Hurwitz, it made perfect sense. ''There will never be another Ellington record or another Weill record like these,'' he said proudly.

Indeed, it's hard to imagine an era in which this film's very premise - that a rich white boy could masquerade as black in order to collect a scholarship to Harvard Law School - wouldn't have raised a few hackles somewhere. But ''Soul Man'' is funny, and although it's a hit with predominantly white audiences, blacks who come to see it appear to be laughing too. They are easily disarmed by a film that has less to do with racism than with ambition, and that works so hard to make sure that its audiences, like its characters, never think.",1986-11-09T05:00:00+0000

Q. Is it a good idea to help young children with their homework every night, or does it encourage dependency? A. Most experts believe that a parent should be involved with a young child's schoolwork on a daily basis. They suggest that the best way is to talk over the day's activities with the child. Since independence is the ultimate goal, the parents of a very young child may want to look over his homework with him, but they should expect the child to answer the questions himself. If the child is anxious or puzzled about what to do, parents can help him review the instructions and think through the process in order to get the answer.",1986-11-09T05:00:00+0000

From December 1941 until March 1943, when it finally seemed that the Allied forces would prevail, George Orwell wrote a weekly commentary for the BBC on the progress of World War II. His reports were broadcast to India by Indians and purported to provide an Eastern perspective on the war (though by the end of 1942 Orwell had decided to put his name on them). The series was conceived as part of an effort to counter Axis radio propaganda, which was exacerbating already difficult British-Indian relations in the attempt to woo India away from the Allies. It must have been a tough job for a man of Orwell's beliefs and temperament despite the knowledge that subjugation to the Axis powers would hurt India far more than a few years of continued British rule. He had to submit to the censor, follow the British Ministry of Information's guidelines on a number of issues and skirt the delicate questions of Indian independence (which he wholeheartedly supported) and Britain's crackdown on the Indian Congress leaders. He had to overcome his strong distrust of the Soviet Union and present it as an admirable ally; he had to use wartime euphemisms like calling retreat the ''strategic sacrifice of territory'' - the newspeak he later warned of in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four.'' Though the bulk of his commentary is detailed analysis of the situation on various fronts, battle by battle, Orwell does touch on the issues of propaganda and censorship, presaging the themes of much of his later writing. W. J. West, who edited an earlier volume of Orwell's literary broadcasts, has included those portions of the commentary scripts that did not make it past the censor; they include Orwell's reports of political dissent within wartime England.",1986-11-09T05:00:00+0000

A few bars into R.E.M.'s encore, the band's vocalist, Michael Stipe, stopped singing and went to help lift a stunned-looking girl from the crush of people near the stage. Mr. Stipe went backstage with the girl, who apparently had fainted; he returned to announce that she might have a broken rib, then ended the show with a subdued version of the Velvet Underground's ''Femme Fatale.'' (Chris Hansen, Madison Square Garden's head of security, said Friday that the girl had had an asthma attack.) It was an uncomfortable ending for a superb concert. R.E.M., a four-man band from Athens, Ga., is the pride of rock's alternative circuit; it built a reputation in clubs and on college radio before more commercial outlets began paying attention. The band's songs pile idiosyncrasy on eccentricity. They take the guitar riffs of 1960's folk-rock and garage-rock, assemble them in asymmetrical ways - with unexpected shifts of key, odd-length verses and choruses, extra bridges - and then add Mr. Stipe's lyrics, delivered in a grizzled voice.",1986-11-09T05:00:00+0000

This is from ''Living UpCountry'' (Yankee). Auctions make for entertaining drama as well as bargains. In the most common variety of summer auction, somebody has died and his estate is being settled; the auction converts all wordly possessions, no matter how precious or mundane, into coin of the realm. Weepy kin are apt to be dispersed among the crowd, watching memories sold to disrespectful strangers, but the general atmosphere is apt to be celebratory. A carnival: hot dog vendors, cars parked on the grass, cheerful citizens sitting in lawn chairs facing the front porch. In the house, a squad of muscled teenagers wrestles stuff out the door in no particular order. Kitchen range, rocking chair, pickling crock, mattress, chain saw. Each is duly made the property of the highest bidder; when the contents of the house are sold, sometimes they sell the house.

IN 1983 Derek Freeman published his book ''Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth,'' in which he claimed to have exposed what he has called a wholesale deception unmatched in the history of the behavioral sciences. He was referring to Mead's fledgling field study that won popular fame as ''Coming of Age in Samoa'' (1928). Systematically demolishing Mead's methods, findings and characterization of Samoan culture, Mr. Freeman drew a portrait of an aggressive, violent, sexually inhibited Samoa that contrasted dramatically with Mead's version. His purpose in this had less to do with understanding Samoa than with the unmasking of the ''cultural determinism'' supposedly perpetrated by Franz Boas on all of American anthropology - and on the public at large. By undermining the details of Mead's classic case illustrating how culture can shape the experience of adolescence, Mr. Freeman professed to be restoring the balance in the nature-nurture debate.",1986-11-09T05:00:00+0000

Now help is on the way. Under the newest five-year extension of the Federal Higher Education Act of 1965, part-time students pursuing undergraduate degrees, no matter what their age, will be in line for Federal benefits through the awards known as Pell Grants. The new benefits take effect in the 1989-90 academic year, when the maximum Pell Grant will be $2,700 a year. (It will grow $200 a year thereafter, to $3,100, in 1991.) As they are for full-timers, grants are restricted to students whose family income is under $30,000. In addition, the new law provides nontraditional students with more aid through College Work-Study and Opportunity Grants, which will be raised from a maximum of $2,000 to $3,000 a year.",1986-11-09T05:00:00+0000

After Williams went 1 for 4 on the next-to-last day of the season, dropping his average from .4009 to .39955, Manager Joe Cronin of the Red Sox offered to bench him for the season-ending doubleheader in Philadelphia so Williams could finish with an average that would be acceptable as .400 after being rounded off.",1986-11-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q.Why do mockingbirds imitate other birds? A.Scientists believe that mockingbirds imitate the calls and songs of other birds to discourage these birds from settling in the mockingbirds' territory by making it appear heavily populated. The mockingbird's vocal chords, called the syrinx, can produce a wide variety of sounds. A typical mockingbird has 250 to 350 songs in its repertoire. Most songs are direct repetitions of other birds' songs, but some are original improvisations. The male mockingbird uses its repertoire of songs to attract females, according to Dr. Kim Derrickson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Institution. A female mockingbird will choose the male with the largest repertoire because he is most likely to have the most territory, Dr. Derrickson said. For this reason, mockingbirds are constantly expanding the number of songs they sing, he said. Mockingbirds can imitate sounds made by other animals, such as the bark of a squirrel, and can also reproduce the sounds of inanimate objects such as fire alarms, dripping water or the squeak of a washing machine. Q.How is urine tested for signs of drug use? A.The most widely used screening method is enzyme immunoassay, in which the urine sample is mixed with reagents used to detect specific drugs. The mixture is placed in a spectrometer, which measures the amount of light the mixture absorbs. The degree of absorption indicates the presence or absence of the drug. Radioimmunoassay, using radioactive substances, is another popular screening method.",1986-11-11T05:00:00+0000

Visitors to the Long Wharf Stage 2 will quickly discover why Mr. Lucie's uproarious but mean play is the tardiest of the trio to arrive. Originally produced at the Bush, a small London fringe company perched above a pub, ''Progress'' is so misanthropic it makes the typical decline-of-England threnody seem as rosy as ''Brideshead Revisited.'' ''People - that's what wrecks all our plans,'' concludes the utopian 1960's architect of ''Benefactors'' after his dreams of beneficent social change collapse. By contrast, a 1980's liberal in ''Progress'' argues rather more darkly that ''the only creatures worth pitying on this earth are animals'' because people are too ''stupid'' to ''want to get better.''",1986-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Now the wood no longer absorbs the stain. A. Each time the Minwax stain-sealer (it is actually a colored or pigmented sealer - not just a stain) was applied, the excess should have been wiped off with rags. Apparently this was not done in your case. You might try rubbing the worn spots with steel wool, then wiping with a clean rag before applying more Minwax. If the Minwax is not absorbed, try lightly sanding those areas to increase porosity (this may lighten this section more than the rest of the floor, so test first in a little corner). If this doesn't work, then the whole floor will probably have to be re-sanded. Q.In the co-op apartment we recently purchased, the hot-water pipes run through the back wall of our two main closets. In one closet it gets so hot that the clothes feel hot. Management says it can't help us. Is there a way to insulate the closets and have them look presentable? A.Your best bet is probably to apply one-inch-thick sheets of Styrofoam or similar rigid foam-board insulation to the back wall of the closet, then cover this with a half-inch layer of gypsum board (required by the fire code).

Actually, wood dies the moment the tree is felled, although from then on it will forever be on the move, imperceptibly for the most part, trying to adjust itself to the moisture - or lack of it -in the surrounding air. Perhaps that is what is meant by ''living and breathing.'' The idea in seasoning wood is to lower its moisture content so it is more or less in equilibrium with the atmosphere around it, thus preventing shrinking and swelling. Early woodworkers, mindful of wood's behavior, cut their lumber in planks of generous thickness, believing the denser and harder the wood was, the better its chances of resisting shrinkage, splitting and warping. But that did not seem to be so. In the case of oak, the only modifying effect to its future health was the result of splitting the wood into planks along its line of natural cleavage, or sawing it radially - cutting inward toward the center of the log - rather than straight sawing.",1986-11-13T05:00:00+0000

More than four decades ago an Argentine guitarist-poet named Hector Roberto Chavero renamed himself Atahualpa, after the last chief of the Incas and Yupanqui, after the 15th-century founder of the Inca empire. Through the years, Mr. Yupanqui, who is now 78 years old, wrote and collected songs about the natural beauty of Argentina and the lives of the people who lived there; he became a major star in Europe as well as South America, and spent some years living in Paris. Some of his songs, about the contrast between rich and poor, became a basis for the Latin American ''nueva cancion'' (''new song'') movement, which uses traditional forms to make political statements - sometimes directly, sometimes metaphorically. At his New York debut concert, three years ago at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Yupanqui was in fine voice; his guitar pieces, based on traditional Argentine zambas and milongas and chacareras, sounded brand-new. And the response of his longtime fans is affectionate, verging on reverence. Tonight at 8; tickets are $20 and $25. Atahualpa Yupanqui will also perform tomorrow at 8:30 P.M. at the Tarrytown Music Hall at 13 Main Street in Tarrytown, N.Y. (914-631-3390), with tickets from $15 to $18, and Sunday at 6 P.M. at the Park Theater, 560 32d Street in Union City, N.J. (201-865-6980), with tickets from $12 to $18.",1986-11-14T05:00:00+0000

us,STAGE: REDDIN'S 'STANDARD OF LIVING',"IT'S impossible to talk about Keith Reddin without making him sound like just the young writer that the American theater is always seeking but almost never finds. In his three full-length plays seen in New York - ''Life and Limb,'' ''Rum and Coke'' and now, at Playwrights Horizons, ''Highest Standard of Living'' - Mr. Reddin has shown no hesitation about tackling what used to be called ''the big issues.'' Yet as a sometime actor, he has the theatrical wisdom to avoid the documentary agitprop style that makes most American political theater a dreary chore. People hallucinate in Mr. Reddin's comedies, and from their dreams rise socio-cultural-political connections. Before David Lynch directed the film ''Blue Velvet'' or the critic Thomas Hine coined the term ''populuxe'' to describe the social implications of 1950's kitsch, Mr. Reddin, in ''Life and Limb,'' was peeking behind the ''I Love Lucy'' sunniness of booming, Eisenhower-era America to disinter the buried bodies, filthy secrets and official malfeasance of the new cold war consumer state.",1986-11-14T05:00:00+0000

In February of 1933, less than a month after Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, the Government banned pornography and homosexual-rights organizations. A month later, the SS arrested a prominent homosexual activist and shipped him to a concentration camp. Two months after that, Nazi-incited thugs destroyed the Institute of Sexual Science in Berlin, run by Magnus Hirschfeld, a prominent sexologist, Jew, homosexual and Social Democrat. So began the Nazi campaign against male homosexuals (lesbians, for reasons that remain obscure, were largely spared), which persisted until the end of the war. Heinrich Himmler, chief of the SS, directed the campaign in the firm belief that homosexuality was a contagious evil, a threat to procreation and the future of Germany. Thousands of homosexuals were murdered outright or remanded to concentration camps, where they bore the mark of the pink triangle sewn on their uniforms. Trumped-up charges were also used by the Nazis to eliminate troublesome political opponents. Yet some prominent homosexuals, like the actor Gustaf Grundgens, on whom Klaus Mann based his 1936 novel ''Mephisto,'' remained close to the regime and prospered under the Nazis. These are very murky historical waters, and as Richard Plant takes pains to point out, reasonably exact information on the campaign is virtually impossible to come by. He estimates that between 5,000 and 15,000 accused homosexuals died in concentration camps, but available statistics are conflicting, and much archival and research material remains under wraps in East Germany and the Soviet Union.",1986-11-16T05:00:00+0000

Although Horace is a lapsed Episcopalian, there's the sweetness of the choirboy in his kindly, modest demeanor.

Nowadays sport attracts an immense amount of publicity, but it was hardly suffering from neglect in 1869, when The New York Times devoted all but one of its front-page columns to reports of a boat race in London between crews from Harvard and Oxford (which was said to have been watched by around a million people).",1986-11-21T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"Some artists and critics consider marginal art - the art of the socially dispossessed, the naive, the provincial - an alternative to modern art's preoccupation with form and to the commercialism of the art business. RUSSIAN SAMIZDAT ART (Willis Locker & Owens, Cloth, $19.95. Paper, $9.95) - ''samizdat'' referring properly to underground Soviet literature and its distribution - presents and discusses both avant-garde efforts in the Soviet Union and Russian art in exile. In either guise, as a response to repression or as an engage emigre art addressing political and moral issues supposedly shunned by greedy, timid Western artists, samizdat art is promoted by Rimma Gerlovina and Valery Gerlovin - emigres who, along with John E. Bowlt and Szymon Bojko, have contributed essays to this book - not for what it is but for whom it claims to confront. The art's actual interest comes entirely from its Russian context. Vagrich Bakhchanyan's poster portrait of Lenin and a young girl, titled ''Lolita,'' cleverly conflates Russian and American ideas of Lenin while commenting wryly on the nature of successful emigre art and its official Soviet counterpart. But most of the work illustrated is only another provincial expression of late modernism, learned in part from American art magazines - colorful illustrations pored over in Moscow kitchens while comically doomed attempts are made to translate murky art prose. Is Soviet samizdat art an expression of dissidence or merely nonconformism?

In ''Working Space'' (Harvard University), Frank Stella fluently pontificates on contemporary painting. Much of abstract painting today has lost touch with the fullness and mobility of the pictorial space of the past in a mistaken effort to locate art in the novel exclusivity of technique, thus fulfilling the most (and probably lowest) common definition of abstract painting, which suggests that knowledge of abstract painting is knowledge of how to make an interesting mess. . . . By 1970 abstract painting had lost its ability to create space. In a series of withdrawals, it began to illustrate the space it had once been able to create. The space in abstract painting, in a certain sense, became more advanced - more abstract, if that is possible. It was no longer available to feeling, either emotional or literal. This fulfilled one of modernism's great dreams: the space in painting became available to eyesight alone, but unfortunately not to eyesight in a pictorial sense, but to eyesight in a literary sense. In a word, it became available to the eyesight of critics rather than that of artists. . . .",1986-11-23T05:00:00+0000

us,A Museum in L.A. Shapes A Modern Collection,"Today should be a happy day for the Los Angeles County Museum, for it marks the opening to the public not only of the big new Robert O. Anderson building, designed by the New York firm of Hardy, Holtzmann and Pfeiffer, but of what is in effect a new museum of modern art, complete with a very large space for temporary exhibitions. (That space is devoted through March 8, 1987, to a mammoth survey of abstract painting and its antecedents, organized by Maurice Tuchman of the County Museum and entitled ''The Spiritual in Art,'' after Vasily Kandinsky's seminal book of the same name.) For those who know something of Los Angeles, this is a remarkable, and in some ways almost a resurrectional, occasion. Not so long ago Los Angeles underwent some startling changes. Norton Simon took his European paintings, which were on loan to the County Museum and had been expected to stay there, and put them in the Pasadena Museum, which was renamed the Norton Simon Museum and forthwith became, inch for inch, one of the finest museums in the country. The Getty Museum became very rich indeed, and was thought of as a potential predator that could tell every other museum to get lost. The soon-to-open Museum of Contemporary Art, which had seemed to be too ambitious in a freaky way ever to survive, proved able to look after itself in circumstances no matter how fraught and demanding. In short order, the County Museum was thought of as a place that had lost a great collection, could never compete with the Getty in the market and was so bottom-heavy in its physical appearance that it would also lose out to the Museum of Contemporary Art when it was a question of moving fast and traveling light.",1986-11-23T05:00:00+0000

Dorothy's ''attacker,'' the totally demented Frank (Dennis Hopper), alternately becomes her depraved child and despot father in the bizarre game that entangles both of them - as well as the sash of Dorothy's blue velvet robe. ''Dennis says that is not a rape scene; it's our love scene,'' says Ms. Rossellini, laughing. And, quoting from the subservient Dorothy, she hastens to add: ''O.K. sir, O.K. Frank.'' ''Blue Velvet'' is Ms. Rossellini's fourth film, but it is the first that offers her a role strong enough to display the star quality of an impeccable movie pedigree. Born to Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini in 1952, just three years after their adulterous affair scandalized the world, Ms. Rossellini is no stranger to controversy. She says she was aware that playing Dorothy could be potentially damaging, but that she saw it essentially as ''a role I was haunted by and felt I wanted terribly to try.''",1986-11-23T05:00:00+0000

Call it karma or original sin, but for Cecile Pineda's characters, the given of life is suffering, and deliverance is possible only through the violent dismembering of the worldly self. Her elegiac first novel, ''Face,'' nominated for a 1985 National Book Award, told of a barber from a Brazilian slum whose face is grotesquely mutilated, and the solitary anguish of reconstructing it. The major character of her new novel is Gopal, a stone carver in 10th-century India, whose dissolution of self is more gradual at first and thus more deceptive. After losing the wife he cherishes to the shadows of her own dream world, he is conscripted by a dynastic prince to travel to Java to carve 120 friezes of Buddha's life for the shrine of Borobudur (still standing today), whose construction devoured the lives of thousands of laborers. Ms. Pineda is convincing in her description of the passion and hubris that fuel Gopal's carving of the sacred friezes but also blinds him to the close, hot breath of danger around him; she makes the act of savagery that forces him to recast his life both horrifying and believable. Unfortunately, the novel suffers from her insistence that Gopal lead a pointedly metaphorical life: she names his first, dreamily seductive wife Maya, the Sanskrit term for the illusions from which we must detach ourselves to gain true enlightenment; Borobudur is a not too subtle symbol for the pridefulness and cruelty of this world.",1986-11-23T05:00:00+0000

us,HOW DO YOU GIVE COUNTRIES CONFIDENCE IN THEIR FUTURES?,"BARBER B. CONABLE Jr. became president of the World Bank last summer at a time of expanding influence. The bank has a prime role in the plan initiated 13 months ago by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d to mobilize capital for developing countries that agree to open their economies to trade and investment. Last week, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as it is formally called, decided unanimously to release $300 million of the $2 billion it has committed this year to Mexico for a program to improve trade competitivness and reduce import barriers. It also lent $250 million to Chile, despite appeals from human rights groups opposing the move. At his office near the White House, Mr. Conable, a former Republican Congressman from upstate New York, discussed his priorities last week with six journalists from foreign publications and Clyde Farnsworth of The New York Times. Excerpts from their talk follow. Question. What will follow the Mexican loan? Answer. There will be follow-on loans of various sorts, and it's all dependent on the kinds of cooperation that are apparent in the Mexican Government now, and that involve a good deal of political courage on their part. Q. Isn't Mexico a special case? A. It's a very tough case because it's become so dependent on oil. They didn't have effective and efficient productivity to fall back on in other areas when the oil price went to nothing. Mexico has had some political instability in the past, too. Q. What is the United States' financial role? A. The U.S. supports the International Development Association with less than $1 billion.",1986-11-23T05:00:00+0000

In novels like ''Foundation's Edge'' (1982), ''Robots and Empire'' (1985) and now ''Foundation and Earth'' he has been linking his most important science fictions - the Foundation trilogy, the stories of detection set in the early Galactic Empire and the robot stories - into a single time- and space-spanning work of epic proportions.

There'll be food sampling; a demonstration of atlatl, an Indian throwing stick; a native-plants walk, and lectures and films on tool technology. Admission is 25 cents.

As a naturalized American born to Russian emigres in Paris, I have long been concerned with the problems of exile, dissent and the life and work of artists under repressive regimes. And since the Russian invasion, Prague has become a symbol of artistic repression. Yet there is also evidence that a sense of identity and pride has arisen among Czechoslovak writers at home and abroad, a countercurrent of literary vitality, humor and defiance.",1986-11-23T05:00:00+0000

He thinks, too, about the small, declining temple he has been assigned to head and all the work to be done before he descends from the mountaintop monastery of Senshu-Gakuin to what he calls ''the earthly world down there.'' The dimly lit prayer room is filled with monks chanting the mantras that are the essence of the universal Buddha's teachings. Still, Fukami's mind wanders, when his concentration lags, when he cannot find his path to the Middle Way - to the level of nothingness, to paradise in this world where all extremes disappear. The monastery, high on Mt. Koya in central Japan, is far removed from the earthly world. Yet the distance is deceptive. The earthly world is a place of desires, but desires are also to be found on the mountaintop. There, however, they exist alongside the tenets of the Shingon-Buddhist faith.",1986-11-23T05:00:00+0000

As an amalgam of fiction, biography and oral history, the novel ''has a fractured and inconsistent feel to it,'' David Leavitt wrote here last year. But in the ''breathtaking final 100 pages,'' he said, Edgar's meticulous account of the fair is ''dizzying in its specificity,'' and Mr. Doctorow ''conveys perfectly the extent to which a fair becomes a world unto itself.'' THE SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE MACHINE GUN, by John Ellis. (Johns Hopkins University, $8.95.) John Ellis traces the development of the machine gun from its beginnings in the 1860's to the trenches of World War I and into the gangster haunts of Al Capone, Baby Face Nelson and the Barker gang - who, we are told, really did carry theirs in violin cases. Arguing that the history of technology is inseparable from social history in general, Mr. Ellis weighs the machine gun's impact on weaponry, warfare and society in 19th- and 20th-century Europe and America, and suggests that it precipitated the modern arms race. In 1976 our reviewer, Trumbull Higgins, called the book ''a brief but brutal tract for our times.'' FROM THE FIFTEENTH DISTRICT, by Mavis Gallant. (G. K. Hall, $5.95.)",1986-11-23T05:00:00+0000

Although the exact cause of these spasms is unknown, many doctors believe the condition results from disruptions in the normal pattern of breathing that may occur while a person is laughing or coughing. Hiccups may also be caused by emotional disturbances or disorders of the chest or abdomen. Normally, hiccups last two to five minutes, but some chronic cases persist for months and even years. There is no full-proof method for relieving hiccups, according to Dr. Timothy Ives, who has conducted studies on chronic hiccups at the University of North Carolina Medical School. Dr. Ives said that in mild cases folk remedies such as drinking a glass of water without stopping for breath, sucking on a bitter lemon, breathing into a paper bag and eating a spoonful of sugar have proved effective because they break the spasms affecting the diaphram. For chronic cases, doctors prescribe a number of tranquilizing drugs such as chlorpromazine that have fast-acting calming agents that may also eliminate the spasms, Dr. Ives said. Q.What is meant by the term air quality and how is it determined? A.Air quality is an indication of the healthfulness of the air, based on the number of pollutants it contains. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation constantly monitors the air for six different pollutants: sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulates, lead and ozone.",1986-11-25T05:00:00+0000

What clearly drives Howard Ashman, the author of the book and lyrics, and Marvin Hamlisch, the composer, is their deep affection for the lighthearted musical comedies of their youth - during the form's last, pre-rock-and-roll gasp of the late 1950's and early 1960's. In ''Smile,'' mementos of that sassy time can be found when its young women are gyrating in their dormitory cubicles (a la ''Bye Bye Birdie'') or delivering a comedy number before sinks in a washroom (''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'') or parading on a runway circling the orchestra pit early in Act II (''Hello, Dolly!'').

Julia Child, doyenne of French cooking in America ''In France cooking is a serious art form and a national sport. I think the French enjoy the complication of the art form and the cooking for cooking's sake. You can talk with a concierge or police officer about food in France as a general rule. It is not the general rule here. Classical cuisine, which I hope we are going back to, means certain ways of doing things and certain ways of not doing things. If you know classical French cooking you can do anything. If you don't know the basics, you turn out slop.'' Gerard Pangaud, chef at Aurora ''French cooking uses a lot of techniques, and it uses a lot of rules. For most of the cooks in France, the reference point is Escoffier. For example, you have a blanquette. There is an understanding between two chefs when they talk about blanquette. They know, for instance, that a blanquette does not have parsley in it. And if, in France, you served the blanquette differently from the way it used to be - should be - served, people would not like it.

When Illinois Jacquet brought his 16-piece big band to the Village Vanguard last July, he was known primarily for ''Flyin' Home'' -which he recorded with Lionel Hampton's band 45 years ago - and as the leader of his own small group for more than 40 years. He formed the big band after he gave a series of master classes at Harvard University in 1983. ''Their eagerness for the big-band music and their ability to grasp the essence of it made me realize that today's generation has not been properly exposed to the big-band sound,'' Mr. Jacquet said. His message seems to be getting across because his engagement at the Vanguard in July was the club's most successful week in its 51-year history. Mr. Jacquet's big band will be at the Vanguard again tonight through Sunday. Shows are at 10 and 11:30 P.M. with a third show tonight and tomorrow at 1 A.M.

When the Germans invaded Lithuania - which had not long before been annexed by the Soviet Union - in 1941, he set out for the Russian interior but decided that it would be safer for his wife to stay behind; they both shared what was then a commonly held illusion that however grievous a threat the Nazis posed to able-bodied Jewish men, they would at least spare women and children.

He was one of the most astonishing fellows I ever came across. I remember in particular one detail about his exhibition in 1867. He had had a sort of closet built from which he could keep an eye on his exhibition. When the first visitors arrived, he was getting dressed. To miss nothing of the enthusiasm which the public was bound to feel, he went down in a flannel waistcoat, without pausing to slip on the shirt which he was still holding in his hand. And Courbet himself, gazing at his own pictures: ''How fine they are! They look magnificent! So fine that it's really stupid!'' And he kept repeating: ''Yes, it's really stupid!''

In a collection of essays on the human body - including offerings on embalming, child abuse, twins and male genitalia - Dr. Gonzalez-Crussi ''wears his pathologist's gown with a difference and his learning lightly.'' The pieces ''are essays in the old if not defunct sense of the term. They mix fact with speculation and gravity with humor, are rich in apposite and astounding anecdote and are elegant in expression.'' WHAT'S BRED IN THE BONE, by Robertson Davies. (Elisabeth Sifton/Penguin, $6.95.) Robertson Davies's novel draws a portrait of a wealthy and eccentric Canadian art authority and would-be painter, Francis Cornish, whose secret life as a forger is revealed only after his death. In The Times last year, Michiko Kakutani called the work ''an altogether remarkable - and ornate -creation.'' Penguin has also reissued three Davies novels in a single volume, THE SALTERTON TRILOGY: ''Tempest-Tost,'' ''Leaven of Malice'' and ''A Mixture of Frailties'' ($9.95), all revolving around the inhabitants of the university town of Salterton, Ontario. In these pages in 1955, Stuart Keate said that ''Leaven of Malice,'' about a misleading wedding announcement in the town newspaper, is ''full of zest, wit and urbanity.''

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"JAMES BROWN: The Godfather of Soul. By James Brown with Bruce Tucker. (Macmillan, $18.95.) Along with Chuck Berry, Little Richard and Ray Charles, James Brown is one of the most influential shapers of contemporary popular music. And in this surprisingly reserved autobiography he charts his life from the meager beginnings in rural Georgia to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame earlier this year. Born in Barnwell, S.C., in 1933, Mr. Brown, after his mother left when he was 4, was raised by his father and, later, an aunt who lived in Augusta, Ga. He was a better-than-average athlete but music became his early obsession and he formed his own trio by the age of 12. Poverty and a less than hospitable environment (his aunt ran a brothel), however, led him into a life of petty thievery, and at 16 he was sent to the Georgia Juvenile Training Institute. Released in 1952, he began to earnestly pursue musical ambitions. His career peaked in the late 60's, declined rapidly in the 70's with the advent of disco and numerous personal problems, then took off again recently with his exposure in movies such as ''Rocky IV.'' In recounting his story, Mr. Brown avoids lurid connections of drugs and sex with rock music. Instead he concentrates on the black performers' struggle to move from ''race'' recordings and the ''chitlin' circuit'' into the entertainment mainstream, the stress and excitement of extended tours (he sometimes played 350 one-nighters a year, thereby earning the sobriquet ''the hardest working man in show business'') and his friendships with legendary performers like Little Willie John, Elvis Presley and Jackie Wilson.",1986-11-30T05:00:00+0000
