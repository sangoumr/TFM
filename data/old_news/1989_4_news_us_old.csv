us,CONSUMER'S WORLD: Guidepost; Keeping Cellars Dry,"If your house is in a low-lying area and the basement tends to flood, spring is the time to buy a sump pump or check the one you have. The pump removes water that seeps through foundation walls before it can flood the cellar. The pump sits in a pit or basin in the cellar, usually 30 inches deep, and as water collects in the pit the pump discharges it away the house through a pipe. Here are three basic ways to avoid problems. Pit Debris: To avoid motor burnout, remove any debris from the pit and scoop out sediment. Mount the pump on bricks, to raise it slightly above the bottom of the pit. Clogged Pipe: Flush the discharge pipe regularly with a garden hose to clear it of any debris. Replacing Pump: Generally, sump pumps should be replaced after six or seven years. A pump should turn on and off automatically and be installed by a licensed plumber. Also, have a battery-operated backup in case of power failure in a storm. Source: The Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Information Bureau, Chicago.",1989-04-01T05:00:00+0000

''The plot of 'Freaky Deaky' races along, constantly changing course and doubling back on itself, like a cunning fox in front of the hounds.'' Mr. Leonard is also getting pretty savvy about marketing. This paperback includes the first chapter of his next novel, ''Killshot.'' PRIME TIMES, BAD TIMES, by Ed Joyce. (Anchor/ Doubleday, $9.95.) By the time he was dismissed as president of CBS News in 1986, Ed Joyce had learned to his dismay that television journalism was ''just another business.'' He was also tired of putting up with Dan Rather. ''What he shows us is hypocrisy, paranoia and ego,'' Herbert Dorfman said here last year. ''It is real-life stuff like this that makes movies like 'Broadcast News' seem pale and unimportant.'' DOUBLE WHAMMY, by Carl Hiaasen. (Warner, $4.95.) A hermit who used to be the Governor of Georgia teams up with a detective who doubles as a bass fisherman. ''The writing style is macabre-funny and it delivers the plot's myriad twists and turns with breathtaking speed,'' Walter Walker said here last year. ''All that Mr. Hiaasen requires in exchange for a thoroughly good time is a little suspension of disbelief.'' OTHERWORLD JOURNEYS: Accounts of Near-Death Experience in Medieval and Modern Times, by Carol Zaleski. (Oxford University, $8.95.) Over the centuries, people who claim to have glimpsed the afterlife have surfaced from their experiences with remarkably similar tales. This ''is not a book for occultists and Carol Zaleski is not a parapsychologist,'' Richard A. Shweder said here in 1987. He called it ''a sophisticated post-modern, hence nonphilosophical, book about that timeless philosophical problem'' of ''how to explain mental objects (for example, a vision of heaven or an encounter with a leprechaun).'' SHAKEDOWN, by Gerald Petievich (Pocket Books, $4.50.) After his best informer is killed by a car bomb, an F.B.I. agent named John Novak must find a new way to infiltrate the Las Vegas mafia. The novel is ''exciting, tough and gritty, superbly written with never a false note either in style or in characterization,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year. ''It is as good as they come.'' 1999: Victory Without War, by Richard Nixon. (Pocket Books, $8.95.) In a world plagued by ''superdoves'' and ''superhawks,'' the prolific ex-President calls for moderation, warning that Star Wars and the quest for nuclear superiority are as impossible as total disarmament. Written for a mass audience, the book could make ''an important contribution to the maturation of American foreign policy,'' Marshall D. Shulman said here last year. STORIES: Five Acre Virgin and The Travelling Entertainer, by Elizabeth Jolley. (Penguin, $7.95.) In these short stories, Elizabeth Jolley continues her tales of underdogs and eccentrics in Australia. ''A large part of Ms. Jolley's charm is her style, which is conversational, a bit faux naive, but as sharp and clear as a primitive painting,'' Robert Plunket said in The Book Review last year. HOLLYWOOD DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE, by Robert Parrish. (Little, Brown, $9.95.) In this sequel to ''Growing Up in Hollywood,'' the director Robert Parrish tells about his encounters with Hemingway in Spain. ''With his wry, relaxed style and ingenuously self-deprecating point of view, [ he ] has once again written a much better book than the many Hollywood memoirists whose names are more familiar,'' Ed Sikov said here last year. PRIVILEGED LIVES, by Edward Stewart. (Dell, $4.95.) What does a Manhattan socialite who has just emerged from a seven-year coma have in common with the victim of a kinky ritual murder? In following these converging trails, Edward Stewart has written a mystery that is ''readable and provocative, and can arouse sympathy for the few redeemable characters that are drawn here,'' our reviewer, Bert Atkinson, said last year. MODERNISM AND THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE, by Houston A. Baker Jr. (University of Chicago, $9.95.) Modernism is not the invention of white people alone, the author writes; there is an Afro-American version of the movement with roots in the Harlem Renaissance. This book's tone and style are academic, Tonya Bolden Davis said here in 1987, but that ''does not diminish the saliency of Mr. Baker's ideas.'' THE BRIDE WHO RAN AWAY, by Diana O'Hehir. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $6.95.) Instead of going through with marriage to her irritating older cousin, Grace Dowell flees her small northern California town for the seedy life of Reno. Diana O'Hehir ''writes with tenderness and lucidity about the end of adolescent innocence,'' Marcelle Thiebaux said here last year.",1989-04-02T05:00:00+0000

Most of what we know about the Beirut crisis comes from bewildering, often conflicting news accounts of skirmishes, cease-fires and shifting alliances. It is almost impossible to comprehend the changing motives of those involved, much less what it is like to live within the crumbling buildings and refugee camps of West Beirut. Pauline Cutting, a British surgeon, gives a clearly written report of life amid this chaos in ''Children of the Siege,'' a chronicle of her 18-month sojourn in the Palestinian camp of Burj al Brajneh. As resident surgeon, Dr. Cutting was quickly accepted by the Palestinians. She describes the cohesiveness within the camps in a city where disputes over a street or a building can incite weeks of fighting. When the camp was besieged by Shiite militiamen, Dr. Cutting, trained primarily in plastic surgery, quickly learned to mend shrapnel and bullet wounds. Faced with shortages of medical supplies and workers, she was forced to make agonizing decisions - which patient was to live, which to die. Finally the hospital itself was attacked. Shortages of water and food led to near starvation, and inhabitants were forced to eat weeds, grass, rats. After months of isolation, it became apparent that the Shiites would not cease their blockade of supplies. It was Dr. Cutting who, in early 1987, dared to alert the world to conditions in the camp. ''Children of the Siege'' is a frightening and inspiring account of the hour-by-hour struggle of life in a war zone.",1989-04-02T05:00:00+0000

Sonata in D (D. 850) and A minor (D. 784), Philips 422 063-2, CD and cassette only; Sonata in A (D. 959), 16 German Dances and other works, Philips 422 229-2, CD and cassette. Alfred Brendel's return to this literature on records is marked by a new relaxation and breadth of generosity - welcome elements to go with the fierce intelligence and concentration that have always marked his playing. The tempos in D. 959, one of Schubert's most powerful and mysterious works, expand and contract widely and yet retain a single sense of movement. There is a warmth of tone and a lessening of tenseness and aggression in these recent performances that may indicate a new phase in the continuing development of an important musician. -Bernard Holland D'Albert: 'Tiefland' Eva Marton, Rene Kollo, Bernd Weikl, Kurt Moll, others. Munich Radio Orchestra and Chorus, Marek Janowski, conductor. Acanta 43841 2; CD only. ''Tiefland'' (1903) is probably the best example of the effect of verismo on German opera: its post-Wagnerian orchestra sings with a Mediterranean passion. It is a lusty tale of a woman's seduction, oppression and eventual redemption. D'Albert manages his material with great skill, and some of his melodic inspirations are haunting. In this 1983 production Eva Marton interprets the suffering Marta with searing intensity and unwavering strength, Rene Kollo is an intermittently effective Pedro, and Bernd Weikl's grainy baritone lends proper menace to Sebastiano. Led by the superlative Kurt Moll, the supporting cast is fine, and Marek Janowski sustains tension throughout. -George Jellinek Brahms: Piano Concerto No. 2; Variations on a Theme by Haydn Horacio Gutierrez and the Royal Philharmonic, Andre Previn, conductor. Telarc CD-80197; CD only. To pianists, the Brahms concertos are Ultimate Tests, and the Brahms Second especially is one of those make-or-break affairs that separates the mere workman from the real artist. In his first recording of the B flat, Horacio Gutierrez presents a big, vital, warm-hearted performance. It is more than a case of remarkable fingers negotiating the murderous passages. Rather, this is a youthful-sounding Brahms minus the great white beard. Previn, no mean pianist himself, works beautifully with the soloist. The recorded sound is unusually clear. -Harold C. Schonberg Haydn: String Quartets in D major (the 'Lark,' Op. 64, No. 5, and Op. 76, No. 5) and D minor The Lindsay String Quartet. ASV CD DCA 637; all three formats. This excellent young British ensemble has been giving a Genius of Haydn Festival at Wigmore Hall in London, and releasing live recordings of the concerts on disk. In this second installment in the series, the players address three of Haydn's quartets with sensitivity and eloquence, letting the slow movements sing soulfully and whipping the quick finales into brisk dances that crackle with energy. The group's tone is wonderfully textured, and the recorded sound is spacious and appealingly transparent. -Allan Kozinn Barber: Second Symphony, Overture to 'The School for Scandal,' 'Music for a Scene by Shelley,' Essay No. 1 for Orchestra, Adagio for Strings New Zealand Symphony conducted by Andrew Schenck. Stradivari SCD 8012; CD only. The finale of Barber's Second Symphony steadfastly refuses to hang together, despite expert conducting by the Barber specialist Andrew Schenck and proficient playing by the New Zealanders in this first recording ever of the symphony. This is probably the reason why the composer withdrew the work. Stradivari, with the help of the music publisher G. Schirmer, has scored a discographic coup by reviving Barber's moving World War II symphonic tribute to the United States Army Air Force, in which he served. All the selections are extremely well recorded. -Paul Turok POP/JAZZ Jimi Hendrix Experience: 'Radio One' Rykodisc RCD 20078; CD only. Live, without overdubs, and using only the special effects he could play with fingers and feet, Jimi Hendrix tore into his early hits along with old blues and even the Beatles' ''Day Tripper'' in these 1967 sessions for BBC radio broadcasts. The songs, more concise than later live Hendrix recordings, are a reminder that Hendrix was a blues guitarist above all, and a great one; his utterly casual virtuosity - lead, rhythm and noise guitar all in one, while he sings - and buoyant humor mock Hendrix's latter-day imitators. -Jon Pareles Herbie Hancock: 'Inventions & Dimensions' Blue Note 7 84147 2; all three formats. Had the pianist Herbie Hancock gone in the direction of the introduction to ''Succotash,'' the opening piece on the album, he might have started a new school of improvisation, mixing a clean and repetitive Steve Reichian Minimalism with harmonically adventurous improvisations. On this album, recorded in 1963, he's backed by Paul Chambers on bass, Willie Bobo on drums and timbales and Osvaldo Martinez on percussion; they play odd metered tunes that force Mr. Hancock to stretch his rhythmic and harmonic limits, moving further into the austere, percussive style he developed more fully as a sideman with Miles Davis. This is the oddest record that Mr. Hancock made for Blue Note, and if it isn't the most satisfying, it comes close; it's certainly the most adventurous. -Peter Watrous The President: 'Bring Yr Camera' Elektra/Musician 69799; all three formats. The keyboardist Wayne Horvitz's sextet brings together noted Lower East Side composer-improvisers to play his easygoing, thoroughly melodic instrumentals. Mr. Horvitz's pieces dip into blues and slide-guitar rock a la Little Feat, along with mock-minimalist repetition, tinges of gamelan or Latin or Japanese music, and whatever else pops into mind. ''Bring Yr Camera'' is less ambitious than Mr. Horvitz's ''This New Generation'' (actually The President's debut album); at times it turns into unassuming background music. But sooner or later, along comes an overlay of noise or a sneaky transition to re-establish its postmodern credentials.-J. P. De La Soul: '3 Feet High and Rising' Tommy Boy 1019; all three formats. More than anything, this rap trio celebrates wit and comic invention. The record, which sold 100,000 copies in its first two weeks in the stores, is also about eccentricity and insularity. The members have developed a funny language and world view they share with no one, and many of their raps have the evocative abstraction of automatic writing. But for every song (there are more than 20 here) about smelly people needing soap, there's one about stereotypes. Behind the collegiate fooling around, there is a collegiate thoughtfulness. -P.W. Andy Summers: 'The Golden Wire' Private 2048; all three formats. The newest solo album by the former Police guitarist is a consistently pleasant, occasionally eloquent album of mystically inclined music that looks for inspiration to the Middle East and India, among other places. All but one of the 11 tracks are instrumentals, the exception being ''Piya Tose,'' a lush soundtrack that features the young Anglo-Indian singer Najma Akhtar. Though the sonic textures and harmonic modes vary from piece to piece, the overall feel of the album is soft-focus and sensuous. Yet Mr. Summers's guitar is incisive and energized enough to prevent even the album's softer moments from drifting into a mindless fog. -Stephen Holden",1989-04-02T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"HORSE-TRADING AND ECSTASY. By Barbara Probst Solomon. (North Point Press, $18.95.) From the trial of Jean Harris to the trial of Klaus Barbie, Barbara Probst Solomon has chosen her subjects over the years with an instinct for the fascinating and the enduring. ''Horse-Trading and Ecstasy,'' a collection of 33 essays, reviews and interviews written between 1959 and 1988, is arranged by theme rather than chronology. The result is a persuasively effective and thoughtful series of contrasting insights that leads a reader to a clear understanding of what Ms. Solomon has been thinking about and why. In a section called ''Fallen Angels,'' for instance, an essay on Sylvia Plath and the woman writer's place in the world, written in 1982, is followed by a compelling discussion of the Ginny Foat murder case, which was published in The Partisan Review in 1986. This segues into a 1981 interview with Norman Mailer from a Madrid periodical. Ms. Solomon, whose previous books include ''The Beat of Life'' and ''Short Flights,'' brings to the page a ferocious intelligence coupled with a luminous prose style. Even when you do not agree with her conclusions about, say, Diana Trilling or Spanish elections, you cannot help but admire how she got there. Essays have spawned much pedestrian writing in the name of ''personal journalism.'' Ms. Solomon, with her dedication to inquiry and intellect, is one very snappy writer who transcends the category.",1989-04-02T05:00:00+0000

Sex is the subject of Lewis Grizzard's 10th book, which, like its title (that of an ''1800s drinking song''), does not cover - or uncover - much new ground. In his introductory chapter, Mr. Grizzard, a columnist with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, promises to tiptoe through the tulips and bypass obscenities and tastelessness. His motives are pure: properly portrayed, ''sex sells'' and ''I want this book to sell. This is America, we have a capitalistic society, and I like an occasional bottle of wine with a cork in it.'' As Mr. Grizzard would say of his youthful tussle with his date's brassiere, he almost pulls it off. The book is a discursive, digressive, anything-for-a-laugh assortment of down-home stories, rambling reminiscences and some very old jokes. Mr. Grizzard find AIDS scary, rails against the hypocrisy of television preachers and, in his autobiographical reveries, casts himself as a nebbishly victim who was cruelly abused by fate and unsympathetic, headstrong women. Perhaps for this reason, Mr. Grizzrd's easygoing, aw-shucks comedy frequently flashes a cruel edge: for him, women are either goddesses or harridans, with no one in the middle. Mr. Grizzard is better when he tours bumpkin-land. as he recounts the perpetual passion of Hogg Philpott for his bride, Cordie Mae Poovey, ''who was uglier than a train wreck and twice the size of one,'' he offers Philpott's advice to husbands past their sexual peak: ''I always try to be willing to do whatever it is that is exciting to my woman and won't cause me to lose a lot of time at work.''",1989-04-02T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"SMALL TALES OF A TOWN. By Susan Webster. (St. Martin's, $14.95.) A reporter down on his luck leaves Melbourne for a job in a lonely town on Australia's vast central plain. ''Some people came here on purpose,'' he decides, ''but for most it was by chance.'' He finds a spot on the staff of The Weekly Advertiser, a paper published every Thursday just ''to clean the presses,'' according to its editor. The Weekly Ad won't win any journalism prizes, but it's a great perch for a narrator who wants us to nose around town for interesting people. And we find them. The book's 25 stories - dispatches from a cultural outpost - re-create a year in the life of a collection of characters. The denizens at Molloy's Beer Garden plot against a rival town with a better football team. A socialist newcomer tries to transform the Kookaburra Cafe into the Engels Wholefood Community Co-operative. The narrator's mad-artist roommate walks around wearing a folded paper hat marked, ''Stetson - grey with red feather.'' The least successful chapters here are those that try for a neat moral or for pathos. Best are the comic tales: the case of the poisoned chicken sandwiches, the spirited search for an unknown lottery winner. Susan Webster, an Australian journalist, also gets us to understand something about life on the edge of a hostile landscape: that floods, firestorms and other catastrophes only plant a small town more firmly in the soil.",1989-04-02T05:00:00+0000

The Presidential election of 1988 offered one of the most unedifying spectacles in the American political panorama. Unfortunately, Elizabeth Drew's ''Election Journal'' reflects much of the tedium of that dismal campaign. The book is a collection of columns written for The New Yorker between Dec. 6, 1987, and Dec. 1, 1988. As such, it has serious limitations. It suffers from its subjects, the seven Democratic candidates and the handful of Republicans who entered the race. With so many people to cover month by month, characterizations are necessarily glib. Michael Dukakis is arrogant, Albert Gore is immature, Paul Simon is naive, George Bush is whiny, Jesse Jackson is an angry anti-Semite. Whatever their usefulness when they were written, these snapshots are of limited utility or interest now. Although the book probably should not be blamed for the inevitable limitations of its format, it is an effort to drag the mind back to many of the events covered here. Every now and then there is a discussion with some meat: Gary Hart's willful self-destruction, Michael Deaver's relationship with the Reagan White House, Mr. Bush's character or lack of it. When she allows herself to be a bit discursive, Ms. Drew can be interesting. And one of her points bears repeating: George Bush won the highest office in the land with a campaign of extraordinary amorality. The lesson of his victory, she writes, ''is that the way to win is to go on the offensive against your opponent early, distort positions to whatever degree you can get away with, play upon people's fears and prejudices - and never let up.''>",1989-04-02T05:00:00+0000

In this carefully researched, scholarly work, a chronicle of the Xiang Lake reservoir in China's Zhejiang province from its creation in 1112 to the present, R. Keith Schoppa promises to show the lake as the stage for ''grand battles between filiality and betrayal, obligation and irresponsibility, loyalty and surrender, chastity and impurity, and civic virtue and private greed.'' In fact, much of the Xiang Lake story necessarily revolves around subjects that will prove rather dull to all but the specialist: reclamations, irrigations and encroachments; pumps, dikes and canals. Mr. Schoppa, who teaches history at Valparaiso University, shows how influential families, who sought to drain the lake for profit, competed with local peasants, who depended on it for irrigation. Today, there remains only a large canal for the use of the town of Xiaoshan, a polluted industrial satellite of the city of Hangzhou. ''Xiang Lake'' is attractively presented, with each chapter representing a ''view'' of the lake and occasional, charming poetry scattered throughout. But the occasional dramatic tales of Japanese pirates, Taiping Rebellion devastations and Red Guard rampages are too occasional to sustain the interest of the general reader. Perhaps a lake cannot be an effective dramatic central character after all.",1989-04-02T05:00:00+0000

us,OVER EL GRECO'S SHOULDER,"You have to know Spain and love it - or want to - to appreciate Michael Busselle's LANDSCAPE IN SPAIN (New York Graphic Society/Little, Brown, $24.95). His photographs of the Spanish countryside, accompanied by a text by Nicholas Luard, the author of ''The Wildlife Parks of Africa,'' include 120 scenes, but not the kind you will see through the window of a tourist bus. Mr. Busselle's pictures seem more like artistic renderings of landscapes and scenery than objective views of moments captured by a camera's eye. Some are reminiscent of Impressionist works. The clouds in the brooding ''Castle of Santa Catalina'' look painted; it is not hard to imagine that El Greco's angels could feel at home in that sky. Like the country of Spain itself, some of Mr. Busselle's images can puzzle and the subjects can be elusive. These works impart no sense of time or place; not even Mr. Luard's detailed but mostly incidental commentary can clarify them. Is another picture a close-up of moss growing on a rock, or an aerial view of a mountain cliff with the greenery miniaturized by the distant perspective? All this is intriguing. Are we looking at glimpses of a Spain that is, or once was, or never was - that exists only in the minds of artists who try to interpret it in their art? As Spain once comprised many different kingdoms and still takes its regional differences in custom and language seriously, perhaps this enigmatic view is appropriate. After all, this is a land where many perspectives conflict and confound.",1989-04-02T05:00:00+0000

Brokerage houses say their earnings have been tightly squeezed by high interest rates, continuing investor wariness and a decline in the number of big merger deals. [ Page A1. ] Wall Street found Michael R. Milken's income more stunning than the news that the ''junk bond'' pioneer had been indicted. A number of financiers and executives say his huge compensation, $550 million in 1987 alone, highlights enormous and disturbing changes in the financial markets and corporate America. [ D1. ] The Group of Seven committed itself to a stable dollar while expressing concern over recent gains. Economic officials of the U.S. and its leading allies indicated they would act to prevent further rises, and they supported a foreign debt policy proposed by Treasury Secretary Brady. [ D1. ] The Bush Administration has come to a view shared by most allies: taxpayers must assume more of the potential cost of relief to indebted countries. News analysis. [ D5. ] The economy grew in March at its slowest pace in three years, the nation's purchasing managers reported. Advance word of the report set off a rally in Treasury bond prices on Friday.

Service is so inefficient, bribery is so widespread and complaints are so numerous that the Government has begun to view Telmex as a barrier to growth. [ D6. ] COMPANIES SmithKline Beckman and Beecham are discussing a merger that would create one of the world's largest drug and health-care companies. SmithKline Beckman is ''in play,'' said one analyst, who valued the company at close to $10 billion. [ D1. ] Carson Pirie Scott received a $282 million takeover offer from P. A. Bergner. The retailer said the bid was unsolicited. [ D7. ] THE MEDIA BUSINESS Bertelsmann has become the world's largest media company and the kind of formidable global power against which a merged Time Inc. and Warner Communications would compete.

us,RESULTS PLUS,"TENNIS Graf and Navratilova Advance: Top-seeded Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, seeded second, both struggled in the early going before winning yesterday in the second round of the $300,000 Family Circle Magazine Cup tournament at Sea Pines Racquet Club at Hilton Head Island, S.C. Graf, the top-ranked women's player in the world, defeated Rosalyn Fairbank of South Africa, 6-4, 6-3. Navratilova was extended to three sets before defeating Laura Gildemeister of Peru, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0. Zina Garrison, seeded third, withdrew from the competition yesterday. She suffered a groin pull against Chris Evert during the the Lipton International Players Championship last week. The only seeded player to lose was No. 12 Raffaella Reggi of Italy, who fell to Jana Pospisilova of Czechoslovakia, 7-5, 6-4. Graf's match with Fairbank lasted 76 minutes under a hot midday sun in the stadium court. The 19-year-old West German fell behind by 4-3 in the first set before taking three straight games. Graf double-faulted to end the sixth game of the second set and allow Fairbank to draw even at 3-3. But Graf then rattled off three straight points to take the set and the match. ''The first match is a little tougher than usual and you're not as patient,'' said Graf, who had a bye in the first round Monday. ''Rosalyn was playing really well. She kept the ball in play and I really didn't have the rhythm.'' Graf, who hasn't lost a match this year, said she was a little anxious. Graf did not play in the tournament last year. Navratilova is the defending champion. In other second round action, Natalya Zvereva of the Soviet Union, seeded fourth, defeated Wendy White of Atlanta, 6-1, 6-2, and Catarina Lindqvist of Sweden, seeded 10th, beat Camille Benjamin of Cleveland, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. Other winners included Aranixa Sanchez of Spain, Linda Ferrando of Italy, Regina Rajchrtova of Czechoslovakia and Karen Schimper of South Africa. Shaun Stafford of Gainesville, Fla., defeated Donna Faber of Bradenton, Fla., 4-6, 7-5, 6-4, in the continuation of a first-round match suspended Monday because of darkness.(AP)",1989-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE PATH OF NO RESISTANCE: The Story of the Revolution in Superconductivity. By Bruce Schechter. (Simon & Schuster, $19.95.) The men and women who push back the frontiers of knowledge in the physical sciences sometimes seem to be viewed by society as quiet, cloistered ''techies'' and ''labbies.'' In ''The Path of No Resistance,'' Bruce Schechter opens up their world, revealing the passions, humor, jealousies and brilliance of the people who have taken a once quiet back lane of science and transformed it into an international raceway of competitive technology. Mr. Schechter, a freelance science writer, traces the development of superconductivity (the virtual absence of electrical resistance) from its birth in the Leiden laboratories of Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911 through to the months of frantic research that resulted in a new class of high-temperature superconducting materials and the award of the 1987 Nobel Prize for physics. Competition for the discoveries to be made in high-temperature superconducting materials was furious and worldwide in 1986 and 1987 in laboratories across the United States, Europe and Japan. All were seeking development of materials that would make possible superconductivity in materials at temperatures far above the neighborhood of absolute zero (nearly 460 degrees below zero Fahrenheit). The prize was more than a Nobel Prize, for high-temperature superconductors may transform technologies as disparate as transportation, energy storage and computers. Mr. Schechter is gifted in providing an account of this research that contrasts the supposedly open world of shared research results with the manipulations of the real world of fast-paced international teams. Today's scientists have also learned that sharing too much knowledge may mean losing credit for discoveries. Mr. Schechter turns theoretical material into enjoyable, understandable prose for lay readers, making it clear that while research into superconductivity requires low temperatures, it is populated with with warm-blooded, fascinating people.",1989-04-09T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"FALLOUT: An American Nuclear Tragedy. By Philip L. Fradkin. (University of Arizona, $24.95.) From 1951 to 1962, the United States detonated 100 nuclear bombs at the Nevada Test Site, some 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. ''Fallout'' describes the ultimately unsuccessful course of a lawsuit brought in Federal District Court by residents of the American Southwest who said they had been harmed by radiation from the blasts. Though it is occasionally too emotional, Philip Fradkin's carefully researched book is a welcome addition to the growing body of work describing an atmospheric testing program so aggressive that it amounted to nothing less than an undeclared domestic nuclear war. In ''Fallout,'' Mr. Fradkin, a former newspaper reporter, argues that the principal victims of the testing program were thousands of families in Utah and Arizona who were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation from the blasts. I know of no other work that provides such an exhaustive recounting of the Federal case, which was won in 1984 by the plaintiffs at the District Court level but later reversed by an appellate court on the grounds that the Government could not be held legally responsible for the damage. In January 1988, the Supreme Court refused to take up the issue and the case died.

us,LIFESTYLE: Sunday Brunch; Pre-Theater Dining In a Bustling Bistro,"This is a summary of reviews of Manhattan restaurants by Bryan Miller that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current. Cafe Un Deux Trois * (May 15, 1987), 123 West 44th Street (354-4148) - This sprawling bistro within walking distance of Broadway theaters occupies what was the lobby of the former Hotel ''One-Two-Three.'' The dining room is a visual pun of sorts, with its faux marble columns, walls painted to look as if they are peeling and deliberately chipped moldings. Service is efficient under conditions that border on uproarious at peak hours. A prix-fixe brunch is served Saturday and Sunday and includes soup or green salad to start and entree choices of eggs Benedict and omelets, salmon du chef, steak tartare, grilled chicken and salade nicoise. Desserts are a la carte. Brunch prix fixe, $13.95, is served 11:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday and Sunday. Odeon * (Aug. 29, 1986), 145 West Broadway, at Thomas Street (233-0507) - Odeon, a veteran of the TriBeCa restaurant scene, is set in a former Art Deco cafeteria. This stylish French-American brasserie is an attractive downtown setting for Sunday brunch. The menu features tradtional egg dishes (omelets, eggs Florentine), two kinds of pancakes (buttermilk and potato), chicken-apple salad and corned-beef hash with poached eggs. There are also smoked fish plates and several specials - for example, shad roe with scrambled eggs. Desserts include fresh fruit, chocolate-hazelnut cake and an occasional special of warm berries, sauteed in brandy, then folded into puff pastry and served with creme chantilly. Menu is a la carte and ranges from $3.50 to $7 for appetizers and $7.50 to $16 for entrees. Sunday brunch served noon to 3:30 P.M. Palm Court Diner's Journal (March 24, 1989), in the Plaza Hotel, 59th Street and Fifth Avenue ( 546-5350) - The Plaza Hotel's Palm Court, one of New York's fabled Old World dining rooms, opens to encompass the three- tier Terrace Room for Sunday brunch. The towering mural-covered ceiling and lavish glass chandeliers provide a classic atmosphere. The opulently arranged buffets are impressive in their variety and freshness. The selection includes cheeses, seasonal fruits, terrines, breads and smoked fish (an exceptionally delicate Nova Scotia salmon and pepper-crusted smoked trout are recommended). For breakfast-food fans, there are omelets and poached eggs. Cold shrimp, crab claws, cold roast chicken and hot entrees of lamb curry and braised veal are available for bigger appetites. An appropriately Edwardian dessert is the sherry trifle, which shares a dessert buffet with ''floating island,'' shortcake, pies and tarts. Brunch is prix fixe at $39 and is served from 10 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. Rosa Mexicana ** (Aug. 1, 1986), 1063 First Avenue, at 58th Street (753-7407) - Rosa Mexicana, one of the best and most elegant Mexican restaurants in town, serves authentic dishes in two appealing dining rooms. The front room has a long tiled bar where patrons can enjoy the house margarita made with pomegranates; the back dining area, with rose-colored stucco walls, is subdued and anchored by a flower-filled stone fountain. Sunday brunch is buffet style, with the dishes arranged along the serving bar. These might include guacamole, ceviche, chilled crab meat and jalapenos rellenos to start; among the entrees are roast suckling pig, carne fria and a chicken dish. Flan and mango fruitcake are recommended desserts. Prix fixe, $24. A la carte menu also available with lunch items from $8.50 to $18. Noon to 3 P.M. Voulez-Vouz ** (Feb. 12, 1988), 1462 First Avenue, at 76th Street (249-1776) - Earthy French fare is served in a cool, contrasting setting of glass and mirror. Tones of chocolate brown and pastel pink accent the dining room of this East Side bistro. A wide selection of brunch dishes is offered at an $11.95 prix fixe, with supplements charged for some of the entrees. Among the choices are eggs with smoked salmon, French toast made with croissants, cheese souffle, grilled salmon or chicken, choucroute garni and individual pizzas (one is topped with bacon, mozzarella and sunnyside eggs.) Brunch from 11:30 A.M. to 4 P.M.

Mr. Agnew's lawyers contended that he should be allowed to claim a tax deduction on $142,500 that he paid the state of Maryland in restitution for bribes he was accused of collecting as Governor in the 1960's.

Freed from the pressures of Wall Street,Johnson Wax, as it is widely known, was one of the first companies to institute profit sharing and start a philanthropic foundation. The consumer products company, which is based in Racine, Wis., was also one of the first American corporations to go global - it established its first overseas subsidiary in Britain in 1914.

Question: As a family-controlled company, you are pretty much exempt from the whims of Wall Street. How do you view Wall Street today? Mr. Johnson: My vision for this company goes counter to what is popular on Wall Street - which is against companies with multiple markets. I consider it a genuine asset to be diversified. If my great-grandfather didn't go out of the parquet floor business, we couldn't be selling products around the world.

us,New & Noteworthy,"JOHN HELD, JR.: Illustrator of the Jazz Age, by Shelley Armitage. (Syracuse University, $24.95.) By creating the image of the Flapper, John Held Jr. helped define the free spirit of the 1920's and made himself a millionaire. But styles changed, his fortunes crashed and he was left to start life over again. ''Those halcyon days of speak-easies, free love and jazz are vividly brought back to life,'' our reviewer, Al Hirschfeld, said when this illustrated biography was published in 1987. THE MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH, by Michael Chabon. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) During the summer after college, the son of a Jewish gangster mustJU decide whom he really loves: Arthur, a charming homosexual whose best friend is a biker, or Phlox, a beautiful born-again Christian whose previous passion was punk rock. ''After the recent spate of novels that seem to begin and end arbitrarily, with resolutions no more satisfying than a shrug, it is both refreshing and encouraging to find a writer who so skillfully sets down the elements of his plot, diligently sets them spinning and then carefully attempts to bring about both a climax and a resolution,'' Alice McDermott said here last year. ''The wonderful use [ Michael Chabon ] makes of each description, of Pittsburgh itself, [ is ] often astonishing.'' THE EMPEROR: Downfall of an Autocrat, by Ryszard Kapuscinski. Translated by William R. Brand and Katarzyna Mroczkowska-Brand. (Vintage International, $7.95.) In 1974, when Haile Selassie was being toppled from a half-century of absolute rule over Ethiopia, Ryszard Kapuscinski, a Polish journalist, was there to investigate his fall. ''The mentality of a dictator on the way out is beautifully evoked'' in this allegory, Xan Smiley said here in 1983. ''Mr. Kapuscinski has pulled off a clever coup.'' OSCAR & LUCINDA, by Peter Carey. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $8.95.) On a boat to Australia an Anglican minister and a teen-aged heiress fall in love and decide to build a glass cathedral in the outback. In 1988 our reviewer, Beryl Bainbridge, said Peter Carey shares with Thomas Wolfe ''that magnificent vitality, that ebullient delight in character, detail and language that turns a novel into an important book.'' It won Britain's 1988 Booker Prize. FLIGHTS OF PASSAGE, by Samuel Hynes. (Pocket Books, $4.50.) When Samuel Hynes's memoir of a World War II marine aviator was published last year, our reviewer, Diane Ackerman, called it ''a cross between 'Tales of the South Pacific' and 'Catch-22.' '' ''He paints a moving portrait of a whole generation of teen-agers, fresh from high school but still socially awkward and wet behind the ears, who were given planes and told to drop bombs.'' DOWNRIVER, by Loren D. Estleman. (Fawcett Crest, $3.95.) An ex-con hires Amos Walker, the Detroit detective, to help him recover the $200,000 his partners got when he went to prison 20 years ago. ''The dialogue is crackling, the writing is unpadded, and one can smell and even taste the city of Detroit,'' our reviewer, Newgate Callendar, said last year. RECONSTRUCTION: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877, by Eric Foner. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $14.95.) Reinterpreting the aftermath of the Civil War as a time of great awakening, Eric Foner lays to rest the views of apologists like D. W. Griffith, whose 1915 film ''The Birth of a Nation'' showed evil Northerners oppressing the noble sons of the South. With this ''compelling narrative'' the author becomes the ''pre-eminent historian'' of the period, William S. McFeely said here last year. PEOPLE LIKE US, by Dominick Dunne. (Bantam, $4.95.) This novel by Dominick Dunne, who writes about rich people for Vanity Fair, is ''an anthropologically fascinating picture of Manhattan's high society in the 1980's,'' Kit Reed said here last year. ''The dialogue is funny and dead-on target.'' LIBBY: The Alaskan Diaries & Letters of Libby Beaman, 1879-1880, edited by Betty John. (Houghton Mifflin, $8.95.) In the late 1800's, Libby Beaman used her social connections to persuade President Rutherford B. Hayes to give her husband a job as a Government agent in the Pribilof Islands, near the Arctic Circle. Surviving starvation and challenges to her Victorian upbringing, she wrote ''a gritty but romantic feminist chronicle,'' one reviewer said of the book, edited by Libby Beaman's granddaughter and first published in 1987. GOOD HEARTS, by Reynolds Price. (Ballantine, $4.95.) Rosacoke Mustian and Wesley Beavers, the couple Reynolds Price brought together in his 1962 novel ''A Long and Happy Life,'' find that their marriage is falling apart. This is ''superb storytelling by an enduring craftsman,'' Jill McCorkle said here last year. SPIRITUAL POLITICS: Religion and America Since World War II, by Mark Silk. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) Americans have struck a difficult compromise between religious pluralism and the need to believe that their own faith is the one that really counts. ''Many who read 'Spiritual Politics' are likely to agree . . . with the author's hint that we can best live somewhere between the call to exclusion and the lures of adhesion,'' Martin E. Marty said here last year. DEAD RECKONING, by Sam Llewellyn. (Pocket Books, $3.50.) After two disasters at sea kill his brother and destroy his reputation as a yacht builder, Charlie Agutter tries to track down the saboteur. Sam Llewellyn's ''writing is clear and effortless and the mystery carefully plotted,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year. ''One can feel the sting of the wind, the spindrift, the little humans trying themselves against the elements.''",1989-04-09T05:00:00+0000

Last year, having jumped 25 of Aintree's 30 fences in style, Little Polvier unseated his rider and was unplaced. The owner switched trainers and the move paid off as the 12-year-old coped brilliantly with the heavy ground and a riderless horse late in the race to win by seven lengths in Frost's first Grand National. It was the second Grand National success for the trainer Toby Baldwin, who prepared Highland Wedding, the winner in 1969.

Reading it is about as intellectually taxing and about as informative as listening to sound bites on television news. ''Mr. King, You're Having a Heart Attack,'' written by the radio talk show host Larry King with B. D. Colen, a science editor of Newsday, describes in numbing detail Mr. King's heart attack on Feb. 27, 1987, his recovery, his continuing chest pains, his subsequent bypass surgery, his post-bypass depression and his eventual full recovery as a man reborn and reformed. The problem is the style and substance - or non-substance - of the book. If you care about the way a book is written, if you are sensitive to style and grace, this book will make you grit your teeth. If you dislike celebrity name-dropping and puffery, this book will make you snarl. If you have had a heart attack and want some practical advice, there are plenty of other books in your public library. ''Mr. King, You're Having a Heart Attack'' is written in what I can only assume was meant to be a folksy style, as though Mr. King had turned on his tape recorder and sent out an unedited transcript of every mundane thought that passed through his head. It is wordy, padded and patronizing. I was particularly put off by the huge quotations, pulled out in boldface that can take up an entire page, giving such pearls of wisdom as ''Your mind ain't on the thing at hand. Your mind is on 'Am I gonna live?' '' (from Mr. King's discussion of his fear of having another heart attack during sexual intercourse). On the other hand, you can whip through this little book in an hour or so, gleaning whatever advice and information it contains without spending too much time.",1989-04-09T05:00:00+0000

Top-seeded Steffi Graf won her 28th straight match of the year, beating Elise Burgin by 6-1, 6-2. Second-seeded Martina Navratilova also won easily, as did No. 8 Hana Mandlikova, No. 6 Arantxa Sanchez and No. 11 Judith Wiesner. Fourteenth-seeded Leila Meskhi, another Soviet player, needed three sets to beat Laura Gildemeister. Eliminated in the wave of upsets were fifth-seeded Lori McNeil, beaten in straight sets by the Amelia Island touring pro, Kathy Rinaldi; ninth-seeded Sandra Cecchini; 10th-seeded Bettina Fulco; No. 12 Terry Phelps, and No. 13 Isabel Cueto. Zvereva played listlessly against Rajchrtova, ranked No. 133 in the world, after winning the first set. ''I didn't feel good motivation to win,'' Zvereva said. ''I didn't want to win. I don't find it very important. I don't know what happened to me. Maybe I need a therapist.'' Rajchrtova had to win two qualifying matches just to get into the 64-player main draw. ''That was the best I ever played,'' she said. ''Maybe she was a little bit upset, but I just concentrated on my game. I didn't care about her.''(AP) McEnroe Outclasses Borg: John McEnroe outclassed a rusty Bjorn Borg, 6-3, 6-3, in an exhibition match yesterday in Singapore. A genial McEnroe dominated the indoor contest played at the air-conditioned World Trade Center. The 30-year-old American is ranked sixth in the world. McEnroe won two singles matches last weekend as the United States swept France, 5-0, in the quarterfinals of Davis Cup World Group play in San Diego. Singapore was the first stop this week for Borg and McEnroe on what is touted as their reunion tour. They will also travel to the Philippines, Taiwan and Japan. Borg, 32 years old, told reporters the Asian tour was his farewell. ''There will be no more tennis for me, tournaments or exhibitions,'' he said. ''My future involvement in tennis will be strictly in coaching the youth and I will be glad to do it in any part of the world.''(AP) BASEBALL Soviet Team Improving: The Soviet Union's national baseball team, which made its United States debut with a 21-1 defeat at Navy on Tuesday, followed that with a 20-1 loss against George Washington University yesterday in Washington. The squad, which made eight errors in the loss to Navy, committed five errors and had five passed balls against George Washington. The Soviet team got only two hits yesterday, but one of them was a home run by Nugzar Popkhadze. Twelve Soviet batters struck out in the seven-inning game.(AP)",1989-04-13T05:00:00+0000

Page 1 A counterproposal to Israel's idea for elections in the occupied territories has been offered by leading Palestinians from the West Bank.

There was a cocktail reception in the building's lobby, and dinner was upstairs in the Four Seasons, which was celebrating its 30th anniversary.

us,NONFICTION,"THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR AND THE ORIGINS OF MODERN WARFARE: Ideas, Organization, and Field Command. By Edward Hagerman. (Indiana University, $37.50.) Building on the well-known fact that Civil War strategists benefited from the rapid technological breakthroughs of the mid-19th century, Edward Hagerman, who teaches history at York University in Toronto, explores how these advances were employed and how the resulting evolution of military theory contributed to the modernization, even the democratization, of warfare. ''The American Civil War and the Origins of Modern Warfare'' is useful, often challenging. The accurate, long-range, rifled musket transformed the battlefield, de-emphasized frontal assaults of the Napoleonic tradition and shifted tactical dominance from offense to defense. The resultant reliance on trench warfare, Mr. Hagerman shows, anticipated the tactics employed in World War I and beyond. Mr. Hagerman analyzes the contributions of three West Pointers - the Union major generals George B. McClellan and William T. Sherman and the Confederate general Robert E. Lee - in spurring the evolution of military strategy. Interestingly, Mr. Hagerman's portrait of McClellan shows the dawdling, amateurish commander (whom President Abraham Lincoln finally fired in 1862) in a much more favorable light than usual. McClellan's advocacy of field fortification and maneuvering over expensive direct assaults, the author asserts, was uneven in results and unpopular in Washington, but it did have its influence long after the general returned to private life.",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Erik Satie: Collected Items From a Silent Dream. Alan Marks, piano. London 425 208-2; CD and cassette. I wonder if we do not undervalue the tiny and often familiar items included here. Listening to Alan Marks's admirable simplicity - simplicity being perhaps art's most difficult chore - one begins to hear not just Satie's gentle admonishment of Romantic excess and charming iconoclasm, but also a disembodied purity of considerable power. This music has some of the same renunciatory qualities we find in Liszt's late music. Mr. Marks, bless him, avoids hesitations, rubato and every other cute interpretive trick. -Bernard Holland Elliott Carter: String Quartets (4), Elegy Arditti String Quartet. Etcetera KTC 1065, 1066; two separate CD's. England's Arditti Quartet is the thinking listener's Kronos: Its energies are focused on substance, not form, and its players have the technique to support their ambitions. The Carter quartets, composed between 1951 and 1987 (the Fourth is a first recording) are dense, harmonically gnarled works that demand concentration and stamina from both players and listeners. The Arditti holds up its end of that bargain here. The music's edges remain jagged and emphatic, but there is warmth in these readings, too, and the group's solidity, drive and textural clarity make for compelling, persuasive listening. The ''Elegy'' (1943-46), in Mr. Carter's early style, is an easygoing footnote. -Allan Kozinn Johann Strauss: ''Der Zigeunerbaron'' (The Gypsy Baron) Nicolai Gedda, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Erich Kunz, Erika Koeth, Hermann Prey, others.

These are the five stages of grief that Emily Hansen, the newly widowed mother in Denise Gess's second novel, must pass through on her long journey out of despair. It's not an easy trip. In a book full of widowed and abandoned characters, Emily is the undisputed champion of loss. She has already been deprived of a sister (who died as a child), a father (who disappeared shortly thereafter) and a mother (who then took emotional if not physical flight). Now Emily's husband has died of Hodgkin's disease, leaving her alone with their daughter in a big Victorian house at the New Jersey shore. Enter Gene Lisicky, a soon-to-be-divorced playwright who becomes Emily's tenant. Gene is talented, handsome, witty and good with children. All too predictably, Emily starts to fall in love with this insufferably wonderful man, and the novel begins to falter. Two obvious endings, like Scylla and Charybdis, loom on the horizon. In one - call it the Romantic Fantasy Ending - Emily will attain her final stage of acceptance by winning Gene's love and living happily ever after. In the other - the Politically Correct Ending - she will consider that easy route, but will instead manage to find the inner strength to recover valiantly on her own. Ms. Gess, alas, succumbs to one of these monsters, giving the end of her novel an unfortunate inspirational glow. One wishes she could have conjured a third alternative, a resolution that would have upset our expectations and told us something truly original. As it is, she has written an evocative, sensitive, but ultimately too facile account of the healing process.",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,No Headline,"Tennis Sabatini and Graf Reach Final: Gabriela Sabatini played a steady baseline game yesterday to defeat Martina Navratilova, 6-3, 6-2, and set up a final against top-ranked Steffi Graf in the $300,000 Baush & Lomb Championships in Amelia Island, Fla. Graf reached the final by pounding sixth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez, 6-3, 6-2. ''Today, everything worked very well,'' said Sabatini, who is ranked third in the world and is closing in on No. 2 Navratilova. ''My returns were the best thing.'' Sabatini hit 24 winners and made only 18 unforced errors, as compared with Navratilova's 14 winners and 30 unforced errors. It became evident that Navratilova, a serve-and-volley player, was in trouble when she was forced to trade groundstrokes from the baseline on the clay, where she could not match Sabatini's heavy, topspin shots. Navratilova, trailing, 4-0, in the second set, made a run at the Argentine teen-ager by winning the next two games. But Sabatini immediately broke back against Navratilova's serve and held her own serve for the match. Graf, who won here in 1986 and '87, said her victory against Sanchez was a good tuneup for her match against Sabatini. ''They both play a topspin game from the baseline,'' she said.(AP) Carlsson and Agenor Advance: Top-seeded Kent Carlsson of Sweden and second-seeded Ronald Agenor of Haiti won their semifinal matches in the $125,000 Athens international Nabisco Grand Prix tournament yesterday. The 21-year-old Swede downed unseeded Josef Cihak of Czechoslovakia, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4, in a match that lasted 2 hours 40 minutes on the red clay center court of the Athens Tennis Club in Greece. Agenor came from behind to beat 19-year-old Franco Davin of Argentina, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5.(AP) Running Murphrey Wins in Central Park: Monte Murphrey of the Central Park Track Club won the six-mile run in 34 minutes 40 seconds in the New York Road Runners Club's spring series yesterday at Central Park.

Nadia Ghent of the Warren Street Athletic Club of Jersey City won the women's event in 37:45. Ted Neu of Mount Vernon, N.Y., took the four-mile run in 20:09, and Susan Foster of the Front Runners won the women's race in 23:58. Matt Katey of Australia led all the way in winning the men's two-mile in 9:52. Kathy Amato of the Atalanta Track Club was the women's winner in 11:07. (AP) Rowing Harvard and Brown in Men's Final: The Harvard men's varsity heavyweight crew was 4.06 seconds off the course record at the Redwood Shores Lagoon in California yesterday, winning its semifinal heat in the Redwood Shores-Stanford Classic over its hometown rival Northeastern University by one boat length in the time of 5 minutes 40.76 seconds. The old course record, 5:36.7 was set by the University of California-Berkeley in 1986 in the first classic. The Redwood Shores course is 1,950 meters long, 50 meters short of the standard Olympic 2,000-meter distance. Harvard's time was aided by a quartering tail wind and the pressure of the Northeastern crew, which never let Harvard gain open water the entire distance of the race. Brown won the other men's semifinal heat over Washington, defeating the Huskies by 3.36 seconds in 5:43.91, 3.2 seconds of Harvard's pace. Brown will meet Harvard today in the championship final. In the women's final, Radcliffe, which defeated the Princeton women's varsity by 3.18 seconds, will meet Stanford, a surprise winner over Wisconsin.

The third-place finisher, David St. Pierre of U.C.L.A., ended with 111.50.(AP) Track and Field Monsignor Farrell Takes 6 Events: Monsignor Farrell of Staten Island won six events yesterday in a New York section of the Catholic High Schools Athletic Association Relays at Downing Stadium, Randalls Island. Marc Angelos had a hand in two of the Farrell victories, taking the 110-meter high hurdles and running anchor on the winning shuttle hurdles relay.

Yesterday's meet, contested in a persistent, chilling rain, was also scored as a dual meet between Harvard and Yale. The Harvard men beat Yale, 88-75, paced by the freshman sprinter Derrick Horner. Horner won the 100 meters and 200 meters, placed second in the long jump and anchored Harvard's winning 4-by-100-meter relay team. The women's meet was tied going into the final event, the triple jump, where a first-place finish by Rita Raju put the Crimson ahead, 76-68.N(AP)",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,"LIFESTYLE: Sunday Brunch; In New Jersey, a Rustic Inn With a French Accent","This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in the Connecticut, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester Sunday regional sections of The New York Times. Ratings - poor, satisfactory, good, very good, excellent and extraordinary - are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current. Claude's Ho-Ho-Kus Inn - Excellent (Dec. 8, 1985), East Franklin Turnpike, Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J. (201-445-4115) - Bergen County's dining scene improved markedly when Claude Baills moved his kitchen from his namesake Manhattan restaurant to a rustic Ho-Ho-Kus inn. The three-story house is decorated in pink and burgundy, with a comfortably elegant atmosphere. A series of dining rooms threads through the rambling circa 1790 house; the tavern room includes a wine bar. Brunch might begin with an appetizer of leek salad, salmon mousse or country pate. Entrees include a variety of hot egg dishes, corned-beef hash and quiche. Creme caramel and chocolate mousse are some choices for dessert. Sunday brunch prix fixe, $19. Served from noon to 2:30 P.M. (Note: Dinner menu replaces brunch on Mother's Day and other major holidays that fall on Sunday.) Gallery Restaurant - Very Good (Nov. 29, 1987), 24 Main Street, Tarrytown, N.Y. (914-631-4409) - The ''gallery'' refers to bimonthly exhibitions by painters and photographers, providing a changing backdrop for dining at this contemporary cafe. The wine bar, equipped with a Cruvinet, features an all-American selection from both coasts, and includes some labels from small vineyards in Texas and Connecticut. Among the dishes are poached eggs served on whole-wheat pancakes with sauteed spinach and pancetta; scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms and steak; grilled chicken with honey glaze; poached lemon sole in a ginger beurre blanc and a pasta special. Desserts are a la carte ($4.50 to $5.50); chocolate torte with raspberry sauce and white chocolate ganache with caramel sauce are two of the pastry choices. Brunch prix fixe, $13.95. Served Sundays from noon to 3:30 P.M. Mim's - Very Good (Oct. 11, 1987), 33 Berry Hill Road, Syosset, L.I. (516-364-2144) - Casual and comfortable, Mim's is sparely designed with painted wood beams and a high ceiling; the walls, however, are hung with colorful drawings, the artistic endeavors of diners taking advantage of paper-topped tables and a stack of crayons. Despite the relaxed style, Mim's kitchen turns out some rather serious cooking. Sunday brunch is served as a buffet, and the chef gets to leave the confines of the kitchen to prepare omelets and egg dishes to order in the dining room. In addition to the omelets (fillings include asparagus, prosciutto and shiitake mushrooms), the buffet includes the house special home-fried potatoes; chicken sauteed with Pommery mustard; stir-fried beef with vegetables; several hot pasta specials, and pancakes. There is a dessert buffet, as well. Sunday brunch $12.95, prix fixe. Hours: 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Roger Sherman Inn - Very Good (Sept. 4, 1988), 195 Oenoke Ridge, New Canaan, Conn. (203-966-4541) - Five elegant rooms, one dominated by a large oil of a Revolutionary War scene, make up the dining area of this restaurant in an 18th-century white frame house. A small back dining room has authentic Tiffany glass panels flanking a Delft-tiled fireplace. And in warm weather, diners at brunch or other meals can choose to eat on the front porch or the tree-shaded terrace. The prix-fixe brunch includes appetizer, salad course, entree and dessert. The brunch menu changes each week and might include appetizers of lobster terrine, oysters or duck mousse. Some of the entrees are fillet of sole meuniere, duck salad with raspberry vinaigrette; seafood fettuccine and roast pork with apples. Fruit tarts and chocolate mousse cake ride the dessert wagon at Sunday brunch. Prix fixe at $22.75. Served from noon to 2 P.M.",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA: AN ACT OF DEFIANCE,"ON FEB. 22, A REPRESENTATIVE from the American Embassy in Beijing arrived at a bleak apartment building in the Zhongguancun suburbs of the capital and pressed a bell on the 11th floor. When it finished ringing out an electronic rendition of ''Happy Birthday'' and the door opened, he delivered two crisp envelopes for the astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, a professor of physics. They were not a little surprised to discover that the envelopes contained invitations to a Texas-style barbecue banquet, to be given by President George Bush four days hence in the grand ballroom of the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel. Their surprise was understandable; since January 1987, when Fang was dismissed from his job as vice president of the prestigious University of Science and Technology and expelled from the Chinese Communist Party for his advocacy of democracy and human rights, he had been an official nonentity in China. (In his new job, as a researcher at the Beijing Astronomical Observatory, he has been allowed to retain his membership in the Chinese Academy of Sciences.) ''I had simply not imagined that we would be invited to such an occasion,'' he told me later, his boyish face registering delight and his voice still tinged with incredulity. For the last decade, Fang, now 53, has been recognized for his work in cosmology as one of China's most brilliant scientists. It was not until 1986, however, when he traveled around the country speaking out at major universities on the need for the party to democratize its reform program, that he also began to emerge as China's best-known and most respected dissident political thinker. But unlike many Chinese intellectuals, who in the past had been silenced by party censure and persecution, Fang, after his defrocking in 1987, broadened his critique of the undemocratic nature of Communist Party rule and of socialism's failure in China.",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

An exhibition presented by Michael Goedhuis, a London dealer, at the gallery of Colnaghi U.S.A., 21 East 67th Street, is the first in decades to focus on Sung through Meiji bronzes. The show of 127 metal works - monumental sculpture, incense burners, vases, scholars' studio objects and decorative sculpture - was organized by the dealer over five years. He shopped worldwide, but found most of the bronzes in England and Scotland, where they were collected in the late 19th century and fell out of favor before World War I. ''My only competition was the British Museum,'' Mr. Goedhuis said last weekend, as he put the finishing touches on ''Chinese and Japanese Bronzes A.D. 1100 to 1900,'' which opened Tuesday and remains through April 29. He said the London museum had, over the last four years, regularly placed its new acquisitions of Chinese and Japanese bronzes on view as they were added to the collection. But, he said, so far there has been no formal exhibition of this material at the museum. The variety of stylistic treatments represented ranges from austerely simple vessels and animal figures, which are found among both the earliest and most recently crafted items, to elaborately modeled works of the 16th through 18th centuries. The bronze handles of vases and censers - wide metal streamers, elephant heads or flying fish - are often what distinguish the finest vessels.",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"CHINESE STORY AND OTHER TALES. By Boris Pilnyak. Translated by Vera T. Reck and Michael Green. (University of Oklahoma, $24.95.) In his heyday in the 1920's, Boris Pilnyak was one of the Soviet Union's most popular writers, an enthusiast of the Revolution who nevertheless dared to declare himself ''not a Communist.'' By 1937, he was dead, a victim of the purges. One of the reasons for his liquidation may have been ''The Tale of the Unextinguished Moon,'' a thinly veiled account of the suspicious death on the operating table of one of Stalin's rivals for power. The original version of this bold, devastating short story is being published for the first time in English in ''Chinese Story and Other Tales,'' and it is the most powerful and political piece in the collection. Yet on the whole, Pilnyak is most readable when he stays away from politics. His strongest suit is his love and understanding of Russia - historical, elemental Russia, the land of the peasants, the forests and steppes. This is the Russia he evokes in ''Mother Earth,'' a violent tale about a Bolshevik forester in the Volga region, and the Russia that permeates ''Mahogany,'' an odd novella about the confluence of the new and the old in the revolutionary state. The translations by Vera T. Reck and Michael Green are excellent, although they can't erase the flaws of Pilnyak's style - a tendency to sprawl even in brevity, an occasional self-consciousness with words. But such sins are forgivable, as perhaps are worse ones, too. In the last decade or so, Pilnyak's work has begun to be republished in the Soviet Union; in the era of glasnost, may it find restitution in full.",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

The clunker tires her out quickly because it's heavy and cumbersome; the mountain bike is uncomfortable to ride because it's too big. ''I was biking in pain,'' she says. ''Seat pain, leg pain, thigh pain. I'd ride to the beach, 30 miles round trip, and feel burnt out on the way back.''",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

Seemingly intractable mysteries of skin physiology are unraveling; once-untreatable conditions are succumbing to potent new medications, and preventive medicine is assuming great prominence in battling skin diseases. In perhaps the most exciting development, scientists are beginning to explore the role the skin plays in shielding people from such disorders as allergies, cancer and possibly even AIDS.

But as events there showed, the problem is not so much nationalities - a term that suggests loose ethnic groupings -as old and rooted nations, with identities that predate both Russian and Soviet power. The issue that initially brought thousands of Georgians out onto the streets of Tbilisi, their capital, was a dispute over land, not economic or political rights, Communist control or even Russification. Those larger issues soon overtook the original protest, culminating in a brutal overreaction by Soviet troops, but it is telling that the first spark was territorial.",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,SOLID CASTING HELPS KEEP THIS PHILEAS FOGG ALOFT,"Produced by Mike Todd, one of the more irrepressible hucksters in show-business annals, the 1956 film version of ''Around the World in 80 Days'' won a number of Academy Awards, including one for best picture, one for Victor Young's score and another for best script. S. J. Perelman was among the writers. I admit right here that I found the all-star extravaganza, running for nearly three hours, a monumental bore, its elbow-in-the-ribs spoofing generally tedious. The spectacle of sniffy David Niven being seduced by Shirley MacLaine's ridiculous Indian princess had its obvious limitations. So, the prospect of still another ''Around the World in 80 Days'' being produced for television was something less than invigorating. But . . . . NBC's ''Around the World in 80 Days'' lasts six hours - all right, five hours without the commercials. It is being broadcast in two-hour installments over three consecutive nights, beginning this evening at 9. Adapted by John Gay (''Fatal Vision'') and directed by Buzz Kulik, this version of the Jules Verne novel - filmed handsomely on locations in England, Macao, Hong Kong, Thailand and Yugoslavia - has decided to opt for integrity and stick close to the original source. Considered by many to be the father of modern science fiction, the French writer Verne (1828-1905) managed to transmute his keen interest in science and geography into a series of very successful adventure stories: ''Five Weeks in a Balloon,'' ''A Journey to the Center of the Earth,'' ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.'' Published in 1873, his now best-known work originally appeared in English as ''The Tour of the World in Eighty Days.''",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"THE GOOD LIFE: The Meaning of Success for the American Middle Class. By Loren Baritz. (Knopf, $19.95.) The success of the middle class in the United States has as much to do with culture as with economics. Loren Baritz writes in ''The Good Life'' that while this country has allowed the masses to become better off financially, it has even more strongly encouraged people to shed the old and become part of the new. In fact, that desire is so strong that even people who, economically speaking, are not middle-class tend to see themselves as such. Schooling has replaced breeding as a desirable class symbol. Mr. Baritz, who teaches history at the University of Massachusetts, follows the rise of the middle class from the Puritans to the present. This technique obviously requires statistics and generalizations at every turn, but he tries to keep the text moving by aiming at, and often deflating, the hallowed beliefs of each age. For example, he writes that following World War II the role of women was to help civilize returning soldiers, for ''without her guiding hand, he might murder the in-laws and eat the furniture.'' Martin Luther King Jr. was successful, Mr. Baritz argues, because his faith, his oratory and his optimism ''revealed how much he was a part of the American middle class.'' Conversely, King's successors could never unify American blacks because of ''their too obvious scorn for middle-class values.'' More recently, conflict has divided those ''who wanted more and those who would not tolerate less.'' Both groups belong to the middle class, though tensions between the needs and desires of the upper and lower middle classes are increasing.",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"INTIMATE MATTERS: A History of Sexuality in America, by John D'Emilio and Estelle B. Freedman. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $9.95.) By nurturing a society of consumers driven to satisfy their every whim, capitalism has been a driving force behind the sexual revolution, the authors argue. ''John D'Emilio and Estelle Freedman are not the first to say this, but they say it so convincingly and with such a wealth of suggestive evidence that they might as well take the credit,'' Barbara Ehrenreich said here last year. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOOMY GUS OF THE CHICAGO BEARS? by Robert Coover. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) In his second novel about a character named Richard Nixon, Robert Coover wonders what would have happened if the ambitious young Quaker from Whittier, Calif., had channeled his energies into becoming a football star. ''When the time comes to welcome the what-if genre into the game preserve of literature, Robert Coover's new book ought to be one of the choicest exhibits,'' Robert Kelly said here in 1987. ''Scattered through the book are quotations from Gus that seem the very words of Richard Nixon - they sound so like the man that a mere historian would not dare unfather or debunk them. Gloomy Gus is Richard Nixon, in all his awkward triumphs, in all the plodding determination every act takes, in the harsh light of the will that makes every act equal to every other.'' DREAMS AND DELUSIONS: The Drama of German History, by Fritz Stern. (Vintage, $10.95.) How was a country that gave rise to Nazism and the Holocaust also capable of producing the likes of Albert Einstein, a German-born historian asks in a series of essays. ''Taken together, they represent an original and remarkable interpretation of German history from about 1880 to the present,'' Wolfgang J. Mommsen said in these pages in 1987. THREE NIGHTS IN THE HEART OF THE EARTH, by Brett Laidlaw. (Plume/New American Library, $7.95.) During a bleak Minnesota winter, a failed poet named Ulysses Turner Fraser meets a tragic end. Last year our reviewer, Robert Cohen, said that this first novel is somewhat overwritten but it ''achieves considerable intensity and grace.'' DEEP ENOUGH FOR IVORYBILLS, by James Kilgo. (Anchor/Doubleday, $7.95.) In autobiographical essays about hunting in the South, James Kilgo reflects on the rituals that form the bonds between people and their land. The result is ''a thoughtful and frequently eloquent chronicle,'' Paul Schullery said here last year. BLOOD AND WATER: And Other Tales, by Patrick McGrath. (Ballantine, $3.95.) In a book of horror stories, some set in lower Manhattan, some in prewar England, Patrick McGrath parodies and celebrates Gothic literature. He ''may be a true post-modernist in the sense that Philip Johnson and David Salle are post-modernists,'' Stephen Schiff said here last year. ''He appropriates like mad, regurgitating outmoded styles and formulas with a heavily ironic wink.'' ALVAREZ: Adventures of a Physicist, by Luis W. Alvarez. (Basic Books, $9.95.) Though Luis W. Alvarez won his Nobel Prize for contributions to particle physics, he spent his later years developing a theory that the dinosaurs were killed when a large extraterrestrial body collided with the earth. In 1987 our reviewer, James Trefil, said this autobiography serves to ''remind us of what can be accomplished by one irreverent individual. It should be read by everyone who is interested in science and adventure, or who just wants to meet one of our most fascinating contemporaries.'' The same publisher has reissued RABI: Scientist and Citizen ($9.95), John S. Rigden's 1987 biography of another of the century's great physicists, I. I. Rabi. DUSK: And Other Stories, by James Salter. (North Point, $7.95.) When these laconic stories about exiles and drifters were published last year, our reviewer, A. R. Gurney, said they are ''obsessed with twilight, constantly aware of the precariously thin net of trust which supports what we call civilization and of the darkness which lies underneath. . . . James Salter is an author worth more attention than he has received so far. '' A CHILLING EFFECT: The Mounting Threat of Libel and Invasion of Privacy Actions to the First Amendment, by Lois G. Forer. (Norton, $9.95.) A Philadelphia trial judge argues that a Federal law defining what is libelous and what is newsworthy would help remove the footnotes to the First Amendment appended by our litigious society. ''Judge Forer's subject is a very important one, and I hope that her thesis will find a large, diverse and argumentative audience,'' Howard Simons said here in 1987. IN THE SHADOW OF THE PEACOCK, by Grace Edwards-Yearwood. (Ivy, $3.95.) The Peacock is a blues bar where a young Harlem woman embarks on an adventure that teaches her what it means to be black. Set during the civil rights protests and riots of the 1960's, this first novel feels a bit contrived in places, Robert Ward said here last year, but the writing is ''evocative and deeply felt.'' BETWEEN PICTURES, by Jayne Loader. (St. Martin's, $3.95.) Jayne Loader's novel about the escapades of a rich, drugged-out Hollywood screenwriter is ''satire muted by complicity, a depiction of Hollywood written with a witty, self-deprecating brio,'' William J. Harding said here in 1987. Reading it is ''like attending a wild, drunken, glamorous party - hilarious, frantic, exhilarating and a little exhausting.''",1989-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Dripping Noise Q.We have an 8-year-old house. After the toilet is flushed and the tank has filled there is a noise that sounds like water dripping. It lasts about five minutes, yet there is no evidence of water leaking anywhere. What is causing this, and what we can do? A.After the tank fills, water probably keeps dripping into the tank or into the bowl, from the tank. The water probably comes from the small fill tube that goes into the top of the vertical overflow tube in the center of the tank. The drip is possibly due to the fact that the ballcock (the inlet valve) does not shut off completely when the tank is full. Another possibility is that the flapper valve (or rubber ball) at the bottom of the tank needs replacing. This is supposed to drop down and seal off the opening in the bottom as the tank fills. If it does not does this properly it could be allowing water to drip down into the bowl, causing the noise. Attic Humidity Q.Due to an addition that was built onto our house, the attic is in two sections. An opening of about 50 square feet connects the two areas. We are having a severe humidity problem in the new section; the underside of the roof is turning black with mildew and the wood is damp. The new section has five roof vents and three eave vents. One repairman said the problem was due to not enough air circulation and suggested that a roof fan, activated by a humidistat, be installed there. Another said the problem was due to too much cold air coming into the attic and suggested closing off several of the roof vents. What do you think? A.I think the first repairman is right; more ventilation is needed, especially in cold weather. Either there are not enough vents in the eaves and in the ridge or peak, or the vents are just not large enough. An attic fan might help, but only if there are enough vents to bring in the amount of air needed to vent the attic space properly. Weeds Under a Deck Q.I plan to build a wood deck in my backyard. What should I do to prevent weeds coming up through the spaced floorboards of the deck? A.If the deck is to be right on the ground, the usual method is to dig out about three inches of the soil and fill the space with gravel before setting up the deck. It helps if you first treat the soil under the gravel with a week killer. If the deck will be raised, a common method is to cover the soil underneath with a layer of heavy-gauge sheet plastic, weighing it down with bricks or large stones.",1989-04-20T05:00:00+0000

us,BUSINESS DIGEST,"INTERNATIONAL West Germany stunned the world's financial markets by announcing it would raise its key interest rates. Intended to reduce inflationary pressures, the surprise step upset stock and bond markets and fueled fears that other industrial nations may follow suit. The tightening means that the global trend toward higher interest rates is continuing. [ Page A1. ] West Germany's interest-rate increases might ''lead to a small reduction in the dollar,'' a senior Administration official said, adding, ''It's unlikely that the Fed will respond.'' [ D6. ] The dollar dropped sharply on the surprise move by the Bundesbank. [ D14. ] American industry is losing exports worth nearly $1 billion a year because foreign governments are increasingly using foreign aid as a means of increasing their own exports, the Administration told Congress. [ D2. ] THE ECONOMY Researchers demonstrated the world's first broadcast system for high-definition television that is compatible with existing sets. The demonstration was important in that it shows the U.S. could develop standards for the next generation of television without waiting for Japan or Europe to create the technology. [ A1. ] COMPANIES G.M. posted robust earnings, up 42 percent to $1.55 billion. Revenue rose 12 percent, to $29.6 billion. [ D1. ] Pactel will buy an interest in Chicago cable TV properties now owned by Group W, if regulators' approve. It would be the first time a regional Bell operating company entered the American cable television industry. [ D1. ] Group W agreed to buy 10 radio stations, including WNEW-FM in New York. The price is believed to be about $385 million, which would make it the largest radio deal ever. [ D15. ] BankAmerica reported sharply higher net income for the first quarter, another signal that its recovery is genuine. [ D1. ] Nynex's profits declined, while Bell Atlantic and U S West reported moderate improvements. [ D5. ] Digital Equipment's profits fell 16 percent, depressed by continued slow sales in the U.S. Texas Instruments said profits dipped 1.1 percent. [ D9. ] RJR Nabisco's profits dropped 62 percent in the first quarter. The company blamed its recent takeover by Kohlberg, Kravis and the failure of its ''smokeless'' cigarette. [ D4. ] An investor group acquired 6.6 percent of Dunkin' Donuts and said it might seek control of the chain. The company responded quickly with a series of defensive actions. [ D5. ] MCA called for a special committee of Cineplex Odeon's board to review two top executives' plans to increase their stake. [ D5. ] MARKETS The spot price for crude oil reached $24.65 a barrel, after posting a record one-day rise of $2.04. [ D1. ] Stocks fell broadly, weighed down by weakness in blue-chip issues and in the credit market, where bond prices declined after West Germany raised some important interest rates. [ D6. ] Prices of Treasury notes and bonds tumbled and short-term interest rates shot higher in hectic trading. [ D13. ] Shares sold short and not yet covered reached a high on the Big Board, after climbing 6.4 percent in the period ended April 14. [ D4. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS British advertising's go-go years appear to have gone, in the wake of Saatchi & Saatchi's announcement that it expects its earnings to decline.

Page 1 Iranians were arrested for spying for the United States, including senior navy commanders who helped the U.S. attack Iranian naval targets, the acting chief of Iran's armed forces said. 5 Price riots in Jordan intensified as they spread to a town 20 miles from the capital. The police and protestors fought for four hours and the conflict assumed an overtly Islamic and political profile. 1 Rajiv Gandhi's popularity is sliding and many politicians, columnists and voters - especially in cities and towns far away from the capital -believe he may lose the next national election. 3 In the upcoming Soviet campaign for seats in the new national legislature, seven Soviet independents were excluded from the ballot by the local party apparatus. 5 After killings in Soviet Georgia, the Soviet authorities wrongly absolved themselves of blame, recently elected members of the new Soviet Congress of Deputies said. 5 To halt the shelling in Lebanon, France has been involved in a solitary diplomatic campaign that has generated only tepid international support and antagonized Syria. 4 Restriction of South African forces in Namibia to their bases for 60 hours will start Wednesday to give guerrillas hiding in the territory the chance to return safely to Angola. 28 Soccer in Liverpool, England has been a cause for celebration amid glaring troubles. It is a working-class sport for a working-class city, and its teams usually excel. 4 National 7-10 A combined mobile missile force will continue to be developed by the United States, President Bush has decided.

Exxon said that so much of the remaining oil has evaporated, dispersed or washed onto the beaches that little additional cleanup of the water is possible. 9 New boosters for the space shuttle will be built by units of the Lockheed Corporation and Gencorp's Aerojet General. The NASA contract that will be negotiated is worth about $1.2 billion. 35 Jim Wright's oil well deal, under scrutiny by the Congressional panel investigating the House Speaker, was arranged when Mr. Wright was under intense financial strain, his financial trustee said. 10 The jury in the Oliver North case is deliberating in a room crowded with hundreds of evidence exhibits. Having reached no verdict, they departed for the hotel where they are being sequestered. 7 To honor the 47 crewmen who died in the explosion of the battleship Iowa, Gov. Gerald L.

For officials in Albany and in Washington, the conflict could get worse as the Bush Administration struggles to keep the plant alive. 29 Fund-raising for mayoral campaigns is in high gear at New York City homes and restaurants. In politics, friends of the fund-raisers are fair game for a pitch. 29 Long Island's newest village, Pine Valley, has had a rough first year. With a new mayor, a new attorney and a new Village Board, the village is struggling to move forward. 29 The first ''drug free dormitory'' has been opened at the Atlantic Avenue Armory men's shelter in Brooklyn. A year after the experiment began, it continues to work. 29 New York must pay nursing homes millions of dollars in retroactive Medicaid reimbursements by the end of the year, a State Supreme Court justice in Albany has ruled. 30 News analysis: The jail crisis has pushed New York City further toward remedies that several years ago had been resisted by the Koch administration. 31 The Charter Revision Commission staff is working overtime, responding to the commission's inquiries, researching ideas for reshaping the government and, sometimes, restricting the options. 31 A new way to elect the City Council proposed by a group of Republican leaders might allow more members of their party to win seats. 31",1989-04-22T05:00:00+0000

In his distinguished 50-year career as a leading baseball executive, Lee MacPhail seems to have witnessed, participated in or presided over most of the major controversies in the game's recent history, including the end of the reserve system, the player strike of 1981 and the continuing debate over a drug-testing program for players. He also earned a role in baseball lore as the man who overruled the umpires and let stand the infamous 1983 game-winning home run by the Kansas City third baseman George Brett against the Yankees, although Mr. Brett had been accused of illegal use of pine tar on his bat. Although he was never a manager or a player, Mr. MacPhail amassed the front-office equivalent of an all-star record in his positions as general manager of the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles. He also served as the assistant to the commissioner of baseball and, from 1974 to 1983, as president of the American League. In chronicling his career, Mr. MacPhail provides some revealing glimpses of the egos and off-the-field dynamics of baseball's owners and managers. For instance, to keep order at meetings with such colorful and voluble characters as the owners Bill Veeck, Charlie Finley, Gene Autry and George Steinbrenner, Mr. MacPhail would produce a three-minute sand clock, then interrupt the speaker when the sand ran out. Mr. MacPhail also had his run-ins with managers, but when 55,000 fans at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium booed him after he had ruled against the Orioles' manager, Earl Weaver, for improperly forfeiting a game, it was Mr. Weaver who ran to the microphone to calm the crowd. Throughout, Mr. MacPhail comes across as a man of measured words who was not afraid to stand his ground in a dispute and who strove to resolve labor and player relations issues fairly for players and owners alike. One only wishes that in his memoirs he had let down his guard a bit more.",1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"THE ESSAYS OF VIRGINIA WOOLF. Volume Three: 1919-1924. Edited by Andrew McNeillie. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $22.95.) Thomas Carlyle once said he would ''as soon wash his face in a dirty puddle as write journalism,'' according to Virginia Woolf; she herself expressed similar reservations, complaining that ''after a dose of criticism I feel that I'm writing sideways.'' Yet not only was Woolf's journalism an economic necessity, writes Andrew McNeillie in the introduction to this third volume of her collected essays; her essays also had an important relationship to her fiction. The present collection, which spans 1919 to 1924, comprises 136 articles of varying lengths and covers an eclectic range of subjects. There are critical reviews of Woolf's contemporaries and near-contemporaries, art and drama notices, occasional travel pieces and extended essays on such subjects as character in fiction, the intellectual status of women and the problems of judging contemporary literature. While all are written in Woolf's expansive pictorial style, the later thematic pieces are far more voluble and relaxed than the earlier reviews. Woolf repeatedly argues the case of modernism - archly mocking the older generation for its conventional methods of character development and extolling her own for its interest in the ''dark region of psychology.'' Mr. McNeillie, who has previously edited other volumes by Woolf, is a scrupulous, if somewhat stiff, annotator. In the exacting notes that follow each essay, he has provided sources, publication dates and bibliographical references, as well as brief excerpts from Woolf's diaries and letters. These often prove as illuminating as the essays. Here we not only get Virginia Woolf complaining about an editor's changes or confessing her guilt about disliking a friend's latest novel, but private thoughts on her own work.",1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000

us,How the First Round Might Go,"The first round as projected by Thomas George of The Times. 1 DALLAS COWBOYS Troy Aikman, QB, U.C.L.A. He becomes the Cowboys' quarterback of the present and future. An elusive drop-back passer with excellent field vision who throws with force. 2 GREEN BAY PACKERS Tony Mandarich, OT, Michigan State He is labeled the No. 1 player in the draft, pound for pound. An overpowering lineman with no flaws. 3 DETROIT LIONS Barry Sanders, RB, Oklahoma State He set 18 collegiate records last season and topped 300 rushing yards in a game three times. Finally, after missing Billy Sims for so long, Detroit will have an outstanding tailback and another Heisman Trophy winner. 4 KANSAS CITY CHIEFS Derrick Thomas, LB, Alabama The Chiefs have never used their No. 1 pick to select a linebacker. The Chiefs were last in defending against the run last season. Thomas fits the need and the situation. 5 ATLANTA FALCONS Deion Sanders, CB, Florida State Possibly the fastest man in the draft and a player every team yearns for. He wants to play in Atlanta. 6 TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS Broderick Thomas, LB, Nebraska Mike Singletary's nephew is solid with upper-body strength and a reckless style as a pass rusher. Tampa Bay, 27th in the league in sacks last season, sorely needs that. 7 PITTSBURGH STEELERS Tim Worley, RB, Georgia Worley is a versatile back. He runs inside with power and can slide outside as a breakaway threat. The Steelers were last in the league in sacks (19) but can't pass Worley. 8 SAN DIEGO CHARGERS Eric Hill, LB, L.S.U. Already a dominant player outside who might become as good inside. Stocky and sure against the run. 9 MIAMI DOLPHINS Louis Oliver, S, Florida Scouts call Oliver ''a bigger, faster David Fulcher,'' referring to the Cincinnati Bengals' splendid strong safety. Simply ''a David Fulcher'' would be nice, thus, the Dolphins are understandably excited about this speedy, aggressive hitter. 10 PHOENIX CARDINALS Sammie Smith, RB, Florida State Some believe his raw athletic ability equals that of Deion Sanders. Smith combines speed and power. There are questions about his intensity; he is worth the risk. 11 CHICAGO BEARS (from the Los Angeles Raiders) Donnell Woolford, CB, Clemson The first of three Chicago first-round picks and a dandy one here. Woolford is a wondrous athlete who excels in man-to-man coverage and returns punts. 12 CHICAGO BEARS (From the Washington Redskins) Burt Grossman, DE, Pittsburgh Grossman is frequently identified this way: He is Margo Adams's brother, he once had a pit bull and alligator for pets and he once boarded a Pittsburgh team plane at 11 A.M. with a six-pack of beer as his luggage. Grossman already sounds like a Bear. Chicago will appreciate his combative style. 13 DENVER BRONCOS Tracy Rocker, DT, Auburn Denver needs defense and gets it from last season's Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award winner. 14 JETS Andre Rison, WR, Michigan State Could wind up playing near a former Michigan State teammate, Mark Ingram of the Giants. Scouts say Rison is better - he has exceptionally quick feet after the catch - and say he is the draft's No. 1 receiver. 15 SEATTLE SEAHAWKS (From the Indianapolis Colts) Brian Williams, C, Minnesota A bulky lineman but quick. He bolsters a soft spot for the Seahawks. 16 NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS Hart Lee Dykes, WR, Oklahoma State Dykes is an imposing target who has good hands and leaping ability. 17 PHOENIX CARDINALS Eric Metcalf, RB, Texas Some believe he is only the eighth-best back in the draft, but Metcalf - son of the former pro Terry Metcalf - is unquestionably the draft's shiftiest and most slashing back. 18 GIANTS Cleveland Gary, FB, Miami Agile for a big back and an excellent receiver. Gary should give the Giants more consistency in their running game. 19 NEW ORLEANS SAINTS Joe Wolf, G, Boston College The Saints need more punch up front and Wolf can play guard or tackle. 20 CLEVELAND BROWNS Derek Hill, WR, Arizona A problem area for the Browns, and Hill is the answer. He has quick feet, great lateral movement and adjusts to the ball. 21 LOS ANGELES RAMS Bill Hawkins, DE, Miami Hawkins has size, speed and quickness and uses all of those attributes. Rams lost Gary Jeter but can draft a gem. 22 INDIANAPOLIS COLTS (From the Philadelphia Eagles) Lawyer Tillman, WR, Auburn Another big-target swift reciever who can be acrobatic in the clutch. 23 HOUSTON OILERS Steve Atwater, S, Arkansas A sleeper pick, but a player with size and instincts and grit, all the credentials needed to play in Oilers' House of Pain. 24 PITTSBURGH STEELERS (From the Minnesota Vikings) Trace Armstrong, DT, Florida A solid pass rusher, and the Steelers want more pressure. Trim yet powerful. 25 CHICAGO BEARS Andy Heck, OT, Notre Dame A pass blocker with an upscale future. Great quickness off the ball. 26 LOS ANGELES RAMS (From the Buffalo Bills) Tom Ricketts, OT, Pittsburgh Ranked behind only Mandarich among linemen, Ricketts blocks for the run and the pass equally well. The Rams' offensive scheme still relies first on linemen like Ricketts. 27 CINCINNATI BENGALS John Roper, LB, Texas A&M A big-play linebacker the Bengals love, Roper is a natural pass rusher. 28 SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS John Ford, WR, Virginia A bona-fide deep threat who goes up for catches with zest.

Early in his career, he fought such notable opponents as Fritzie Zivic and Jake LaMotta; midcareer he faced Randy Turpin and Bobo Olson. Toward the end of his reign, he defeated Gene Fullmer and Carmen Basilio.

The only time I ever played hooky, I skipped school in 1969 to watch the Chicago Cubs play the Cincinnati Reds. It was June, and I sat with the official Bleacher Bums, tormenting Pete Rose. For any self-respecting Chicagoan, Cubs baseball that year was serious business, and the Cubs' collapse in August was devastating. I thought I was over it, though, until I read ''The Cubs of '69'' by Rick Talley. Mr. Talley, a former sports columnist for The Chicago Tribune, has reconstructed that fateful season in all its poignancy - from the team's 7-6 win (in extra innings) against Philadelphia on opening day through the first rumblings of trouble in the clubhouse between the manager, Leo Durocher, and virtually everybody on the team (including ''Mr. Cub,'' Ernie Banks), all the way through to the big choke of August and September. By the time it was over, the Cubs were No. 2, unceremoniously dumped by the Miracle Mets, and a city was in shock. ''It was as if someone in my family was dying a slow death,'' says one traumatized Cub watcher. ''I'd wake up each morning and say, 'They'll win today.' . . . But they didn't.'' Even non-Cub fans will enjoy this lively, heartbreaking tale of a team that embraced defeat; the story includes interviews with members of the ill-fated squad (it is hard to believe that the pitcher Kenny Holtzman now sells insurance) as well as memories from the folks in the front office, and the requisite statistics. But for those of us who grew up hearing Jack Brickhouse broadcast the Cubs' opening lineup on WGN, Rick Talley's affectionate remembrance of the year we almost made it is enough to make a grown woman cry.",1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000

Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current. Adrienne ** (April 1, 1988), 700 Fifth Avenue, at 55th Street (212-247-2200) - This elegant and roomy setting in the Peninsula Hotel offers the sunny and aromatic cuisines of the Mediterranean. The expansive prix-fixe buffet ($32.50) changes weekly. It includes cold dishes like lobster with shallots and a salad of artichoke hearts with shrimp. Hot dishes include veal scallops in a garlic cream sauce, chicken breasts with three-peppercorn sauce and roast loin of lamb in a Pommery mustard sauce. An array of French pastries, cakes and tarts provide the finale. Sunday brunch is served from noon to 3 P.M. (dinner from 6 P.M. to 10:30 P.M.). Ambassador Grill * (Oct. 3, 1986), 1 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue at 44th Street (212-355-3400) - The subterranean Ambassador Grill is a serene, urbane restaurant, with its interplay of dark walls, smoky-glass panels and starry lighting. Just to whet the appetite, diners are served a half lobster. Then they move on to the buffet, with its seafood table, salads, turkey, roast beef and ham carved to order, plus chicken, lamb, fish and pasta dishes. There are, as well, hearty choices like eggs Benedict and omelets. The prix-fixe $35 Sunday brunch includes unlimited sparkling wine. Two seatings at 11:30 A.M. and 1:45 P.M. (dinner from 6 P.M. to 10:30 P.M.) Darbar ** (Sept. 5, 1986), 44 West 56th Street (212-432-7227) - With self-assurance and elan, Darbar features the refined Mogul cuisine of northern India. At $11.95, the Sunday brunch buffet is one of the best buys in town. Included are a refreshing salad of cucumber and tomatoes; a restorative potato-yogurt mixture called raita; reshmi kebab, buttery pieces of chicken rubbed with a mix of Indian spices, and chicken and lamb curries. Sunday brunch is served from noon to 3 P.M. (dinner from 5 P.M. to 10 P.M.) Manhattan Island * (Sept. 11, 1987), 482 West 43d Street (212-967-0533) - This hideaway restaurant provides the nearest thing to a tropical island setting, with its glass panels overlooking the swimming pool of the adjoining health club and, in warm weather, umbrella-topped tables outdoors. The new brunch menu includes a choice of scrambled eggs with scallions, Bourbon baked ham and pan fries; rib steak with bearnaise sauce, fried eggs and pan fries; French toast with fresh fruit and sausage or ham, and grits with Cheddar cheese, served with maple-grilled ham and fried eggs.

Petrossian * (Dec. 21, 1984), 182 West 58th Street (212-245-2214) - This pleasure palace in the Alwyn Court strives to feed the soul as well as the body. The Art Deco dining room is a splendiferous work of art or an ostentatious conceit, depending on your viewpoint. Three separate prix-fixe brunches are offered. The $25 brunch includes a glass of Champagne, a Kir royale or a mimosa, followed by a choice of a smoked-trout quiche, French toast or a candied apple crepe with country sausage, bacon or ham.

The restaurant has a serious commitment to fine dining with an American bent. Among the appetizers are ravioli filled with goat cheese and paired with a salad of walnuts and baby lettuces or air-dried loin of lamb with couscous, young sweet peas and grilled Vidalia onions. Popular entrees are grilled marinated breast of chicken with an endive, orange and walnut salad, and a salad of Maine sea scallops with artichokes in a truffle-accented walnut oil. A basket of homemade muffins and biscuits is a bonus. The three-course prix-fixe Sunday brunch is $29.50. Hours: noon to 3 (dinner 5 P.M. to 10 P.M.)

us,FICTION,"APES AND ANGELS. By Philip Appleman. (Putnam, $18.95.) American novelists have routinely peeled back the neighborly veneer of small-town life to reveal a raw and nasty underside. In his third novel, ''Apes and Angels,'' Philip Appleman tries with some success to invigorate this familiar taste of rotten apples within mom's pie. Set in fictional Kenton, Ind., just months before Pearl Harbor, it provides a representative sample of citizens. There's upstanding Dr. Roberts; Paul, a teen-ager stumbling toward sexual awareness; and Paul's iconoclastic biology teacher, Elaine, who's passionate about both evolution and the good doctor. The approaching war is the catalyst that drives and connects their lives, registering first, it seems, in the libido. After hearing President Franklin D. Roosevelt's sonorous radio voice warning of ''insane violence'' in ''the most brutal and terrible of all wars,'' Roberts becomes so lustful that he gropes Elaine in the library. She responds by signing on as his mistress. Similarly inflamed, young Paul steals his brother's best girl. But while desire takes hold of some of the inhabitants of Kenton, others are seized by intolerance. Elaine is forced out of school by fundamentalists, at least in part because she is Jewish. Her father, Saul, publishes scandalously radical articles in his newspaper, attacking Kenton's complacency in the face of Nazi atrocities. When the local Klan burns a cross on his lawn, he turns their symbol of hate into a powerful memorial by tacking photos of missing European relatives to the charred remains. Saul's house is firebombed, and the ensuing conflagration ends up consuming most of Main Street. The fire burns away Kenton's innocent facade; from now on, the ''insane violence'' won't be confined to the battlefield. Although this apocalyptic image is apt, its high drama comes as a surprise in a novel that has focused so observantly on the nuances and niceties of small-town social life. From these peculiarly American details, Mr. Appleman draws a disturbing portrait of frustration and bigotry in the heartland.",1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000

us,THE WORLD: Approaching the Limits of Lebanon's Endurance; The Ebb and Flow of Beirut's Agony,"THE latest fighting in Beirut has been described as the worst yet in the Lebanese civil war. But if that is true, it is only the latest in a succession of ''worst yet'' moments since 1975, when the war began. Here is a look at several of those periods: Autumn 1975: Five months after the war begins, Lebanon is shocked when 50 people are killed in the collapse of an old hotel in downtown Beirut after artillery duels between Muslims and Christians. Daily exchanges destroy the city's commercial center and the first-class seaside hotels. Business shifts away from the Green Line to shops deep within the Muslim and Christian halves of Beirut. Militiamen on each side of the line come to control the streets, and an exodus of civilians begins. But the airport remains open, and schools open and close depending on the fighting. Autumn 1978: Muslim militiamen, who had returned to hideouts when Syrian troops arrived in 1976, take to the streets again as Christians come under Syrian bombardment. As Christians in East Beirut huddle in building basements and stairwells, life is relatively normal in the Muslim sector. Christian gunmen in speeding cars attack Syrian checkpoints. Christian newspapers say 300 people are killed in one day. Summer 1982: After 80,000 Israeli soldiers invade Lebanon to evict Palestine Liberation Organization forces, a daily bombardment by Israelis of Muslim areas from air and sea causes havoc. The Israelis, now in East Beirut, cut off power and water to the Muslim sector to force the P.L.O. to evacuate West Beirut. Eventually, P.L.O. and Syrian forces leave. But in September, hundreds of people are massacred at Sabra and Shatila, Palestinian camps in southern Beirut, by Lebanese Christian militiamen allowed into the camps by Israeli troops. A multinational peacekeeping force of American, Italian and French troops arrives in West Beirut, where Christian units of the Lebanese Army are in charge. The Green Line comes down. Winter 1984: Four months after 241 United States servicemen and 58 French troops are killed in bombing attacks, West Beirut falls to Muslim forces and the multinational contingents leave. The Green Line is re-established, and militias again rule the streets of West Beirut and the southern suburbs. A wave of terror and hostage-taking against Westerners by Shiite fundamentalists follows. Amal, the main Shiite militia, seeks to head off the return of Palestinian guerrillas by attacking Palestinians entrenched in the outskirts of Beirut. But in much of the rest of the city, life goes on uninterrupted. The airport, which is near the worst Palestinian-Shiite fighting, closes for a few days but soon reopens. Winter 1987: After a week of savage street battles between rival Shiite and Druse gunmen leaves 250 people dead, Syrian troops return to West Beirut at the request of local Muslim leaders. The Syrians end the reign of militias on the streets. Life not only returns to normal, but business resumes and a boom unseen in 10 years begins.

Mike Rose's book tears apart all of society's prejudices about the academic abilities of the underprivileged. The associate director of writing programs at the University of California, Los Angeles, he has a rare ability to see and nurture the academic talents of his students and to correct their errors by understanding why they make them. Unlike some educators who preach about the challenge of reaching the disadvantaged, Mr. Rose has been there. The son of poor Italian immigrants, he was rescued by astute teachers, but not before he had spent time in vocational education courses, where he learned what it is like to be labeled dumb. He struggled when he went to college because he did not have the training or the context to make sense of the books he was required to read. ''I was the human incarnation of language-recognition computer programs: able to record the dictionary meanings of individual words but unable to generate any meaning out of them,'' Mr. Rose writes. Eventually, Mr. Rose decided to devote his life to helping other disadvantaged students learn the language and the codes of academic achievement. He rails against stereotypes that cast these students as unable to learn. In a series of vividly written vignettes, he describes how he has taught inner-city public school pupils, Vietnam veterans, adult literacy students and poorly prepared college students who were admitted under special circumstances to boost minority enrollment. His message, he says, is that because the least noticed students often are much more capable than educators ever know, ''what we see and hear is, simultaneously, cause for anger and cause for great hope.''",1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000

He played on 10 world championship teams and managed two other teams to pennants. He is in the Hall of Fame. At 63 Yogi Berra is currently a coach for the Houston Astros. No small accomplishments. He also survived the Normandy invasion and George Steinbrenner. Once again, no small accomplishments. These achievements are recollected by Mr. Berra and his collaborator, Tom Horton, a publisher and friend of long standing, in ''Yogi.'' Other voices are heard in this work, belonging to friends, teammates and opponents who tell tales about the legendary Berra. The book is a trove of Yogi-isms old and new. On a visit to Gracie Mansion, the wife of former Mayor John Lindsay greeted him by saying, ''You look nice and cool, Yogi.'' Mr. Berra responded, ''You don't look so hot yourself.'' After praising a performance of ''Tosca'' at La Scala, Mr. Berra added, ''Even the music was nice.'' His own favorite aphorism is, ''If the world were perfect, it wouldn't be.'' Mr. Berra has been bashed by teammates and the press throughout his career for his unintentional butchering of English. In ''Yogi'' he answers his accusers: ''I know that I do say funny things sometimes, and now that other people get paid to tell stories about me I should keep it up.'' The strengths of this book are Mr. Berra's insights, which, if not deep, can be illuminating. ''I think some of the uniforms are so tight that the base runners can see the pitcher's buttocks tighten when he is going to try to pick them off. You could not tell when Whitey Ford was going to go to first by watching his butt.'' On his former boss George Steinbrenner's treatment of people: ''It was not the way to make your mother proud.'' Mr. Berra's observations go beyond the baseball diamond and its personalities. On the Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman: ''The books Friedman reads and writes are full of math, and I am not talking ERAs.'' On higher education: ''I think I might have liked some college work. I am not talking about music appreciation because I could always appreciate music.'' ''Yogi'' is a warm, funny and honest memoir.

us,MUSIC TO THE EYES,"To live in Salzburg, Austria, and go to work each morning in the Mozarteum International Foundation would seem the closest thing to heaven for lovers of Mozart. Rudolph Angermuller lives such a life as librarian and chief of the research department of the foundation. He shares details of the composer's operas from the wealth of archives at his fingertips in MOZART'S OPERAS (Rizzoli, $65), an oversized, beautifully illustrated book. Mr. Angermuller is firmly rooted in earthly academics and dry writing, but his hosannas to Mozart's genius are evident in his persistent dedication to the facts of the 22 operas documented. In chronological order, Mr. Angermuller explains why and how Mozart became involved in each opera, beginning at age 11 with a ''sacred Singspiel'' (a sort of chamber oratorio) and continuing through ''La Clemenza di Tito,'' completed shortly before his death at 35. For each opera, Mr. Angermuller not only discusses Mozart's music but provides the names of the librettist, a synopsis of the plot, names of principal performers, production problems and audience reaction to the first performance. He augments the text with sketches of the first productions' stage sets and costumes and with color pictures of the sets for 20th-century revivals. Mozart scholars, who will certainly be familiar with most of Mr. Angermuller's text (ably translated by Stewart Spencer), may take issue with his calling Ignatz Anton von Weiser, not Jakob Anton Wimmer, the librettist of Mozart's Singspiel of 1767 and listing ''Bastien and Bastienne'' before ''La Finta Semplice'' when the usual chronology is the other way around. Music students should have this pricey book for its analysis of Mozart's composing. General readers should benefit most from the detailed history of Mozart's magnificent work for the musical theater. If nothing else, the words should propel readers to hear the music on record or to see and hear the operas in performance, and that is precisely what a well-written music book should do.",1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000
us,BASEBALL,"CRASH: The Life and Times of Dick Allen. By Dick Allen and Tim Whitaker. (Ticknor & Fields, $17.95.) For 15 years Dick (''Don't call me Richie'') Allen was baseball's bad boy. His ''attitude'' earned him the enmity of Philadelphia fans who eventually took to peppering him with dangerous projectiles. In defense, Mr. Allen wore a batting helmet in the field, which led to the nickname Crash. But as controversial as Mr. Allen was, he was also one terrific baseball player. In a career that took him to the Phillies, the St. Louis Cardinals, the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Chicago White Sox and ended with a cup of coffee with the Oakland A's, Mr. Allen was named rookie of the year in 1964 and the American League most valuable player in 1972. He played on six all-star teams, hit 351 home runs and had a career batting average of .292. Lesser accomplishments have earned players a spot in the Hall of Fame. Now, with the help of Tim Whitaker, an editor at PhillySport magazine, Mr. Allen relates a lively, riveting account of a baseball rebel who happened to be able to hit a ball out of the park with startling regularity. Mr. Allen was a lot of things, but boring was not one of them. He drank - sometimes to excess; he had extramarital affairs; and he occasionally got into fights with his teammates. That's the Dick Allen most people knew. But here, discussing his life with remarkable candor and insight, he comes across as thoughtful, articulate, sensitive, headstrong and misunderstood (''I'd been hearing I was a bum for so long that I began to think maybe that's just what I was''). Also, being enormously talented and black in a game run by white owners, executives and managers didn't make life any easier for him. But when all was said and done, Dick Allen loved the game of baseball, a game, he maintains, that he did not quit on but that quit on him.",1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000

''Those people who have done me wrong - well, I try to outlive them,'' Albert B. (Happy) Chandler writes in his autobiography. ''In that, partner, I have succeeded remarkably well.'' As his funny, revealing book shows, Happy Chandler - a one-time semiprofessional baseball player, a former commissioner of major league baseball and a one-term senator from Kentucky - looks over his 90 years with a candor suggesting somebody holding forth on the front porch with a mint julep, regaling visitors with one tall tale after another on a lazy spring day. Much of the book is devoted to his exploits as baseball commissioner, from 1945 to 1951 - that pivotal time in sports history when Jackie Robinson broke the color line (a breakthrough that Mr. Chandler takes no small credit for, the visionary general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Branch Rickey, notwithstanding). Sometimes Mr. Chandler's prose is a touch strained, and there are occasions in which the presence of his collaborator, the journalist Vance Trimble, is painfully obvious. Still, this autobiography is a brisk read, full of anecdotes and recollections. Evident throughout is a down-home ebullience, a good-old-boy joie de vivre from this man who sees himself ''wearing the world like a loose jacket.'' It is nice to read that at the age of 90 Mr. Chandler is still in there pitching.",1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"PEARL'S PROGRESS. By James Kaplan. (Knopf, $18.95.) In James Kaplan's first novel, a poet named Philip Pearl accepts a university teaching job in the tiny hamlet of Pickett, Miss. For this bred-in-the-bone Manhattanite, ''progress'' consists largely of a bumpy and somewhat bemused adjustment to life in the Magnolia State. At first, Pearl's point-by-point comparison of the two regions provides the novel with its comic mainspring. But as Pearl's attachment to Pickett grows, this regional comedy softens. Indeed, by the time ''Pearl's Progress'' concludes, Mr. Kaplan's portrait of small-town Mississippi has acquired a fine patina of lyricism, one that allows him to note the afternoon light turning ''close and light gray, opalescent, all the infinitude of Pickett's blue dome gone.'' In the meantime, the transplanted Pearl threads his way through a cultural obstacle course: country music, the Little Big Mall, a Faulkner-obsessed colleague reminiscing about ''ol' Mr. Bill'' and a plateful of inedible fried catfish. Mr. Kaplan is hardly the first writer to attempt such an anthropology of the New South, but his perceptions seem remarkably fresh. In fact, his gift for sidestepping cliches fails him only once, when Pearl encounters an ancient black man on the porch of a shotgun shack, busying himself with gnomic utterances and a battered guitar. Otherwise, ''Pearl's Progress'' succeeds as a deft and witty endorsement for the shock of the new. As Pearl progresses through one new territory after another - romantic as well as cultural - he persuades the reader to share both his excitement and his discomfort: no mean feat, for a series of experiences he's earlier compared to ''losing your virginity over and over.''",1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000

us,BASEBALL,"DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER: Artists and Writers on Baseball. Edited by Peter H. Gordon with Sydney Waller and Paul Weinman. (Chronicle Books, Cloth, $35; Paper, $18.95.) A young lawyer I know, asked what it was like arguing before the Supreme Court for the first time, answered: ''Like playing in the World Series.'' Baseball is America's language, even its glue. Or as the poet Donald Hall puts it in an introduction to this book: ''It is by baseball, and not by other American sports, that our memories bronze themselves. . . . By baseball we join hands with the long line of forefathers and with the dead.'' ''Diamonds Are Forever,'' an elegant collection of text and artwork edited by Peter H. Gordon, a curator at the New York State Museum, with the assistance of Sydney Waller and Paul Weinman, is the color catalogue of a traveling exhibit. It sets out to be about ''one very basic question: 'What is it about baseball that fascinates and touches us so deeply?' '' Andrew Radcliffe's oil painting ''The Baseball Game'' represents all of a game's space and balletic motionlessness, if not the perfect greenness of a northern park. Or as Robert Parker's detective, Spenser, puts it: ''We turned into Yawkey Way. And there we were. In front of Fenway. . . . Inside was eternity.'' There is something to every taste in ''Diamonds Are Forever,'' with its excerpts from 55 writers ranging from Woody Allen to Ernest Hemingway to Carl Sandburg and works by 90 artists, including Andy Warhol, Jacob Lawrence and Elaine de Kooning. Here is the last sentence of Catfish Hunter's brief speech on Catfish Hunter Day at Yankee Stadium: ''Thank you, God, for giving me strength, and making me a ballplayer.'' It is quoted in the British journalist Lesley Hazleton's description of her second day in this country, which she spent at her first baseball game: ''I felt that I had had my first glimpse of a mythical place called America.''",1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000

us,BASEBALL,"BASEBALL ANECDOTES. By Daniel Okrent and Steve Wulf. (Oxford University, $18.95.) Even the most erudite baseball fan may not know that Babe Ruth was the game's first underwear model, that the brainy catcher Moe Berg counted Sanskrit among the languages he knew, that Rogers Hornsby avoided movies to protect his batting eye or that the former Yankee manager Billy Martin had cosmetic surgery on his nose when he was 22 years old. Of such beguiling minutiae is ''Baseball Anecdotes'' made. Daniel Okrent, co-author of ''The Ultimate Baseball Book,'' and Steve Wulf, a senior editor at Sports Illustrated, essentially have written a history of the game in stories - comic, tragic, controversial - starting with baseball's disputed origins and ending with the 1986 World Series. The monochromatic prose rarely does justice to these lusty tales. Some are attributed, some are not and some have the ring of apocrypha about them. The younger fan is enthralled to discover that Hank Greenberg's mother promised to make him 61 baseball-shaped portions of gefilte fish back in 1938 if he broke Babe Ruth's record of 60 home runs in a season. Readers curious about players' afterlives will learn that the Yankee outfielder Mickey Rivers became a professional bingo player, that Honus Wagner toured Pittsburgh saloons in search of recognition and free beers and that a drink-dissipated Grover Cleveland Alexander did a stint as a circus freak. (The authors do not say what kind.) Idolators of macho men will find their demigod in the Cleveland Indians' outfielder Joe Charbonneau, who tried to fix his own broken nose with a pair of pliers, pulled one of his own teeth and stitched up a stab wound with a fishing line. Some stories, however, touch on a provocative point and fail to follow through: the authors never explain why Mr. Martin got that nose job or why the legendary double-play partners Joe Tinker and Johnny Evers did not speak to each other for two years. Gargantuan Boog Powell and paunchy Mickey Lolich are cited for their heft, with no mention of what they weighed. And it is maddening to be told that the career minor leaguer Steve Dalkowski was the hardest-throwing pitcher to walk the earth without reporting the speed of his fastball.",1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000

The judge said he was concerned that the added sentence would give Mr. Bosket ''a license to kill'' in prison.

Earlier, Vladimir Ruzicka knocked in a rebound with 1 minute 4 seconds left to give Czechoslovakia a 3-3 tie against the Swedes.(AP) Track and Field No Record for Relay Team: A mix-up by the officials and a misunderstanding of the rules by the runners might have cost the Santa Monica Track Club a world record yesterday in an 800-meter relay race at the Mount San Antonio College Relays in Walnut, Calif. The team of Joe DeLoach, Floyd Heard, Danny Everett and Carl Lewis, expecting to break the 11-year-old record of 1 minute 20.26 seconds set by the University of Southern California, won the race, but in 1:20.54. The Santa Monica team, in lane four, assumed that each runner had to remain in his lane for the record to be accepted. Only the first three must for the record, but as Everett, the third-leg runner, waited to take the baton from Heard, an official told the third-leg runners they could break to the inside, and Everett finished his leg in the first lane. Lewis, believing he was properly stationed in the fourth lane for the final pass, had to shift to the first lane just as Everett arrived. ''I thought, 'What the heck is going on?' '' Lewis said. He quickly moved in to accept the baton, but the pass was not smooth and Lewis had little better than a standing start for the final leg. In the men's 100-meter dash, Raymond Stewart of Texas Christian won in 9.91 seconds, but with a tailwind of more than 12 miles an hour. DeLoach was second in 9.97. St. John's Women Take Title: St. John's, with 183 points, won the team title yesterday in the women's Metropolitan Intercollegiate Outdoor Championships at Columbia's Baker Field. Virginia Young, a junior, led the winners with a meet-record effort of 161 feet 5 inches in the hammer throw and a winning throw of 130 feet 5 inches in the discus. She was upset in the shot-put by the freshman Sonja Fitts, one of her teammates, who won at 45 feet, a meet record. Rutgers was runner-up with 168 points, and Manhattan College was third at 117.

''Mr. Ballard constructs a moody and well-modeled landscape with as fine a writerly intelligence as we might hope for,'' Samuel R. Delany said here last year. CAPOTE: A Biography, by Gerald Clarke. (Ballantine, $12.95.) Truman Capote was born in a New Orleans hotel to a Southern beauty whose husband, a con artist, wouldn't let her get an abortion. His career peaked while he was still in his 40's with his tour de force of New Journalism, ''In Cold Blood.'' Then his life fell into a sad, drug-sodden decline. In this biography ''nothing, nothing at all, was left out,'' Molly Haskell said here last year. Gerald Clarke ''makes us take a longer look at Capote than I, for one, ever thought I wanted to take, and the result is mesmerizing.'' THE BEGINNER'S BOOK OF DREAMS, by Elizabeth Benedict. (Bantam, $8.95.) Esme, the main character in Elizabeth Benedict's second novel, begins her life of love and squalor with parents a lot like Capote's, but she manages to overcome the handicap. This is ''a bold, expressive view of growing up absurd in New York City in the 1960's and early 70's,'' Cathy A. Colman said here last year. IRON DESTINIES, LOST OPPORTUNITIES: The Post-War Arms Race, by Charles R. Morris. (Carroll & Graf, $13.95.) In his history of the arms race, Charles R. Morris reminds readers that both sides of the equation of mutual assured destruction had reason to be paranoid. Last year our reviewer, Solly Zuckerman, said the ''narrative flows easily, providing a well-balanced picture of the political ups and downs that have been the background of the arms competition of the past few decades.'' FORTY STORIES, by Donald Barthelme. (Penguin, $7.95.) When this collection of stark, surreal stories was published in 1987, our reviewer, Caryn James, said they ''follow the emotional logic of a dream. . . . Donald Barthelme is the author who discovers small, bizarre conjunctions that make enormous sense and offers them in a voice that remains uniquely rewarding and often sounds ageless.'' THE PARIS EDITION: 1927-1934, by Waverley Root. Edited by Samuel Abt. (North Point, $9.95.) Though its contributors and employees included the likes of Henry Miller, James Thurber, William L. Shirer, Ford Madox Ford and Kay Boyle, the Paris edition of The Chicago Tribune was not a particularly good newspaper. What was important, in the recollection of Waverley Root, the paper's book editor, was living among the Left Bank literati of the 1920's. In 1987, The Times's John Gross called the book ''consistently civilized and amusing.'' THE KNOCKOUT ARTIST, by Harry Crews. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) An ex-boxer becomes a freak show star when he discovers that he has the uncanny ability to knock himself unconscious. Last year our reviewer, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, said that the book was a bit too cute but that he was taken in by ''its offbeat characters, its knowing dialogue and its exhilarating changes of pace.'' IN SEARCH OF NEW YORK, edited by Jim Sleeper. (Transaction/Rutgers University, $19.95.) Thirty-seven essays by writers who include Irving Howe, Marshall Berman and Ada Louise Huxtable describe what has gone wrong with New York City. In 1987, The Times's Sam Roberts said this collection, originally published as a special issue of the quarterly Dissent, contains essays of ''depth and thoughtfulness.'' HARD RAIN, by Peter Abrahams. (Onyx/New American Library, $4.50.) When Jessie's daughter, Kate, disappears with her ex-husband, a studio musician, she tracks them to the ends of the earth - the original site of the Woodstock festival. This thriller about the death of the 60's has ''style, atmosphere and a surprising plot,'' William J. Harding said here last year. THE MAN WITH NO ENDORPHINS: And Other Reflections on Science, by James Gorman. (Penguin, $6.95.) If it is true that the brain makes endorphins, or natural opiates, then why do they desert us when we are most in need, asks James Gorman in his collection of ruminations about science.

He envisions weapons to intercept and destroy enemy missiles before they can reach the United States. Jan. 6, 1984 - Mr. Reagan authorizes research on an antimissile system. The Administration contends the directive does not violate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union because it involves only research. Jan. 21, 1984 - The Air Force conducts its first test of a missile to destroy satellites. Feb. 1, 1984 - Mr. Reagan's annual budget seeks $2 billion for a long-term program to develop the antimissile system. Dec. 20, 1984 - Robert C. McFarlane, Mr. Reagan's national security adviser, says plans for the system will be ''on the table'' when negotiators meet for arms talks in early 1985. Feb. 4, 1985 - Mr. Reagan's budget seeks $3.7 billion for research on the system. April 24, 1985 - American officials say Soviet hostility to the system is responsible for a lack of progress at arms control talks. Sept. 17, 1985 - Mr. Reagan says the United States will not negotiate a limit on the system in exchange for Soviet concessions on nuclear weapons. Sept. 24, 1985 - The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment says the system does ''not appear feasible'' and could increase the risk of a nuclear war. Oct. 6, 1985 - Mr. McFarlane says research, testing and development of the system are permitted under the ABM Treaty and ''only deployment is foreclosed.'' Feb. 5, 1986 - Mr. Reagan's budget seeks $4.8 billion for the system, up from the $2.7 billion Congress provided in 1986. July 25, 1986 - Mr. Reagan says he will never let the system become ''a bargaining chip'' in arms negotiations. But Administration officials say he offered to delay deployment in exchange for Soviet agreement to reduce nuclear weapons. Oct. 12, 1986 - A meeting between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev breaks down over the system. Jan. 5, 1987 - Mr. Reagan seeks $5.8 billion for the system, more than 60 percent above the amount Congress allotted for 1987. Nov. 12, 1987 - Frank C. Carlucci 3d, Mr. Reagan's nominee for Secretary of Defense, says the Administration has not decided on early deployment of the system. Nov. 24, 1987 - Defense Department officials confirm a plan to conduct the first test of a laser weapon in space in the early 1990's. Feb. 18, 1988 - Mr. Reagan's budget seeks $4.6 billion for the system, up from the $3.5 billion Congress granted for 1988. Oct. 6, 1988 - The Defense Department announces a plan to halve the number of space-based weapons in the system's first phase, reducing that stage's cost to $69 billion from the $115 billion first projected. Feb. 9, 1989 - In a speech to Congress, President Bush says he ''will vigorously pursue'' the antimissile program.

us,Talking Business with Smith of International Telecharge; Industry Defends Pay-Phone Rates,"On April 1 the Government began allowing long-distance phone companies to compete for operator-assisted calls made from the nation's 1.6 million pay telephones. More than 200 companies are now competing to be chosen by businesses in an effort to gain access to the $2 billion pay-phone market, in which the American Telephone and Telegraph Company had had a monopoly. Consumers have complained that some competing companies -known as alternative-operator service companies - charge as much as five times what A.T.&T. does. Jim Smith, executive vice president of International Telecharge Inc., one of the largest alternative-operator service companies, recently discussed business practices. Q. Are alternative-operator service companies getting a bad rap or have there been cases of overcharging? A. I am aware of more than one company that has charged excessive rates, but these are the exception rather than the rule. Most of the articles and headlines that accuse this industry of price gouging rely on information that is at least two years old. There have been some incidents but these represent a very small percentage of the calls that the industry carries. The situation is drastically improved compared with a few years ago. Many of the companies that were known for overcharging have gone out of business. Q. But you do charge rates that are higher than A.T.&T.'s. How do you justify this? A. We do not consider A.T.&T.'s prices to be the base-line rate. But the majority of our rates are comparable to A.T.&T.'s prices if not less. In the cases where we do charge more, we are justified because we provide more services and features on our network. We offer operator service in 24 languages, a message-forwarding service, toll-free weather information, discounts on collect calls, teleconferencing, talking Yellow Pages and an electronic concierge that gives local events in the area - all from a pay telephone. We also accept commercial credit cards and give a 5 percent discount on calls billed to a commercial card. Many of these items are free, and to recover our costs we have to charge more. Q. Do consumers want these extra services? A. Yes. Many of the services like message forwarding have been immensely popular. The services allow a caller who receives a busy signal to record a one-minute message that is later forwarded when the line is clear. Services such as these are innovative and result from increased competition. This is why A.T.&T. has been installing new technology in its network. Q. Your company allows businesses to place a surcharge as high as 75 cents on each call made from a pay telephone on the premises.",1989-04-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Dining Out Guide: Restaurant Row,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current. Joe Allen * (Aug. 19, 1988), 326 West 46th Street (581-6464) - The cast of dining spots along restaurant row (46th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues) has changed dramatically in recent years. One establishment that has endured for 24 years is Joe Allen. A good starter is a salad of grilled sea scallops over arugula and red peppers in a mild vinaigrette. Reliable entrees include grilled chicken and the hefty house hamburger. Most desserts are heavy hitters: creamy cheesecake, and hot fudge pudding. At dinner, appetizers are $4 to $7, entrees $14 to $19. Noon to midnight daily except Wednesday and Saturday, when the kitchen opens at 11:30 A.M. Carolina * (Feb. 14, 1986), 355 West 46th Street (245-0058) - The main dining room is one of the more accommodating on the block, with its arching skylight, gray banquettes and wraparound mirror walls. Carolina's narrowly focused menu is based on regional American cuisine: beefy chili stoked with hot peppers, deep-fried crab cakes, and hot-smoked brisket of beef. Most desserts are winners, from the citric lime pie to dense chocolate cheesecake. At dinner, appetizers are $4 to $9, entrees $16 to $25. Lunch Monday through Friday noon to 3 P.M.; dinner Monday, 5:30 to 9 P.M.; Tuesday through Saturday, 5:30 to midnight; Sunday, 5:30 to 9 P.M. Lattanzi * (Sept. 14, 1984), 361 West 46th Street (315-0980) - This is a simply decorated room with exposed brick walls and small hanging lights. The cappellini primavera, with its impeccably cooked vegetables, is one of the finest renditions in town. Baby artichokes prepared in the style of the Jewish quarter in Rome are superb in golden-green olive oil pungent with garlic. Pasta, available in appetizer portions, is for the most part exceptional. Tomato sauce, in various guises, is common to many of the dishes: a notable rendition is the lightly spiced sauce with capers and browned nuggets of chicken in the pollo capriccioso. A rich tartuffo, almond-scented Italian chocolate gelato, is a good finale. At dinner, appetizers are $5.50 to $10.50, entrees $13.95 to $21.95. Lunch noon to 2 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner starts at 5 and continues until 10 P.M. Monday and Tuesday, 11 P.M. Wednesday and Thursday and midnight on Friday and Saturday. Closed Sundays. Orso ** (Feb. 17, 1989), 322 West 46th Street (489-7212) - This breezy restaurant is done in clean ocher tones and wood, with an open tile-and-steel kitchen in the rear that buzzes practically nonstop. The pizzas are light enough to sample without spoiling the appetite, with thin yeasty crusts and sprightly toppings. Pastas rotate daily, and among the best of the regular repertory is tagliatelle tossed with cubes of grilled eggplant, radicchio and Parmesan. Seafood is the best of the entrees. You can't go wrong with the grilled tuna steak in a clean and lively Mediterranean sauce of black olives, tomatoes and capers. Try the eye-opening espresso gelato for dessert. At dinner, appetizers are $7 to $8, entrees $16 to $19. Noon to 11:30 daily except Wednesday and Saturday, when the kitchen opens at 11:30 A.M.

us,CONSUMER'S WORLD: Guidepost; A Fan for All Seasons,"Ceiling fans are now popular in all parts of the country. In warm weather run them in the normal direction (counterclockwise) to send a gentle flow of air downward; this can allow air-conditioners to be set at higher temperatures. In cold weather reverse the fan to pull cooler air up, which forces warm air near the ceiling down. A ceiling fan is connected to an electrical outlet box on the ceiling that must be fastened to an overhead beam, not the plaster or drywall.

us,PAPERBACKS: New & Noteworthy,"THE WHITE LANTERN, by Evan S. Connell. (North Point, $9.95.) In essays on Antarctic exploration, the Vikings' discovery of America, the origins of man and other matters, Evan S. Connell muses on the oddities and incongruous facts that stand in defiance of our compulsion to theorize. ''Merely to list Mr. Connell's subjects is to describe his mind: stubbornly unsystematic, curious, enamored of unsolved puzzles,'' Paul Zweig said here in 1980. '' 'The White Lantern' is not a history of scientific discovery, or of anything else for that matter. It is an antiquarian's attic; a trove of sidelights and overlooked details.'' QUINN'S BOOK, by William Kennedy. (Penguin, $8.95.) Drawing on his now familiar ingredients - journalists, politicians and a magical city called Albany - William Kennedy tells the story of Daniel Quinn, a young newspaperman who tries to win the heart of the elusive Maud Fallon, the beautiful enigma he saved from drowning in the Hudson when she was 12 years old. ''If the history sometimes overwhelms the story, it is always fascinating,'' T. Coraghessan Boyle said here last year. ''Mr. Kennedy does indeed have the power to peer into the past, to breathe life into it and make it indispensable. . . . Alive on every page with its author's passion for his place and the events that made it, it is a novel to savor. One puts down 'Quinn's Book' with a sigh, ever envying Mr. Kennedy his roots.'' WHO KILLED CBS? The Undoing of America's Number One News Network, by Peter J. Boyer. (St. Martin's, $5.95.) CBS News was once known as the aerie of such distinguished broadcast journalists as Edward R. Murrow, Charles Collingwood and Walter Cronkite. Then along came Van Gordon Sauter, who presided over its fall. ''This is a horror story and Mr. Boyer tells it well,'' Jeff Jarvis said in The Book Review in 1988. ''His writing is polished, his reporting thorough. His analysis, so far as it goes, is savvy and intelligent.'' SAILING, by Susan Kenney. (Penguin, $7.95.) Phil, who is dying of cancer, is dubious when his wife, Sara, wants to buy him a sailboat; then he finds that taking flight across the water is a way to wrest control of his life. ''Although capable and good in sketching the mine field of marital feelings, [ Susan Kenney ] has captured the exquisite pleasures and dangers of the sea marvelously,'' C. D. B. Bryan said here last year. FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES. The Bechtel Story: The Most Secret Corporation and How It Engineered the World, by Laton McCartney. (Ballantine, $8.95.) The Bechtel engineering services company has given the world Hoover Dam, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and the Saudi Arabian city of Jubail. It has also supplied the United States Government with a Secretary of State (George P. Shultz), a Secretary of Defense (Caspar W. Weinberger) and a Director of Central Intelligence (Richard Helms). There is nothing improper about this, the San Francisco-based corporation has insisted in a response to this book, denying that its political connections are based on anything more nefarious than networking. ''No other private corporation in modern history has had closer ties to the Federal Government than Bechtel,'' Stephen Labaton said in The Book Review last year. ''By either Mr. McCartney's or Bechtel's standards, it is corporate networking of unparalleled dimensions.'' LIFE IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING, by Daniel Vilmure. (McGraw-Hill, $6.95.) One summer's night, a disturbed boy who thinks he's another James Dean joins his younger brother on a rampage through their seedy Florida town. The novelist Daniel Vilmure's ''vivid, terse language aptly embodies the hard-driving, violent drama and makes us feel we are running through the night with these brothers driven by a painful loss of innocence and fate,'' Gardner McFall said here in 1987. DOROTHY DAY: A Radical Devotion, and SIMONE WEIL: A Modern Pilgrimage, both by Robert Coles. (Merloyd Lawrence/Addison-Wesley, $9.95 each.) The psychiatrist Robert Coles met Dorothy Day more than 35 years ago when he worked in one of her soup kitchens. He became acquainted with another reformer, Simone Weil, through her books of radical social criticism. In these biographies, ''Dr. Coles takes up certain themes and passions that preoccupied his subjects, and wrestles with them as one might do with those of any figure who has become a lifelong spiritual companion,'' Kenneth L. Woodward said here in 1987. ''It is well worth having both of the Coles books for what they tell us about the life of the spirit.'' THE DEATH OF METHUSELAH: And Other Stories, by Isaac Bashevis Singer. (Plume/New American Library, $8.95.) When Isaac Bashevis Singer's 10th collection of short stories was published last year, our reviewer, Robert Pinsky, said he catches ''the spiritual energy of that abrupt transition from the ancient to the modern'' that suffuses Yiddish literature. ''This energy seems to underlie the urbane sorcery of his work, his almost manic power to spin out abundant and immensely entertaining narrative.'' ALBANY PARK: A Story of Bohemian Adventure and Obsessive Love, by Patrice Chaplin. (Atlantic Monthly, $8.95.) A British writer reminisces about the mid-1950's, when she left her dreary London suburb at the age of 15 and embarked on a hitchhiking trip that ended in Spain, where she fell in love with a poet. ''Memories of the wartime blitz and her mother's suicidal psychotic episodes are stitched into good, hard-edged writing that about halfway through becomes a romance,'' our reviewer, Irma Kurtz, said in 1987. The story of Patrice Chaplin's further adventures, ANOTHER CITY ($9.95), is available from Atlantic Monthly as a paperback original. THE RETURN OF MR. HOLLYWOOD, by Josh Greenfeld. (Carroll & Graf, $8.95.) When his mother dies, Larry Lazar, an obnoxious Hollywood director, goes home to Brooklyn to contemplate the mess his life has been. In 1984 our reviewer, Herbert Gold, said this story by the author of ''A Child Called Noah'' is ''as vulgar as a Hollywood novel should be and usually is, as witty as a Hollywood novel should be and often is not.'' LAST WALTZ IN VIENNA: The Rise and Destruction of a Family, 1842-1942, by George Clare. (Owl/Holt, $11.95.) In this memoir, a survivor who lost his family in the Holocaust reminisces about the days in Vienna when it was still possible to believe in the virtues of assimilation. ''Along with the horror of its collapse, Mr. Clare has conveyed precisely and charmingly the world that for nearly a century Western Europe's Jews thought they were living in,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times in 1982. EYELESS IN GAZA, by Aldous Huxley. (Carroll & Graf, $10.95.) After a chance encounter with an older, enlightened man, a fashionably cynical libertine learns that world peace can be achieved only through individual acts of compassion. ''For all its structural faults 'Eyeless in Gaza' is an important and portentous book - one that no thinking man or woman of the twentieth century can read without stimulation and deep respect,'' our reviewer, J. Donald Adams, said when this novel was published in 1936. THE STALKER AFFAIR, by John Stalker. (Penguin, $7.95.) Sent by the Thatcher Government to investigate allegations that policemen had killed unarmed Irish rebels in 1982, John Stalker was removed from the case in what he says was a cover-up. His book about the affair opens ''a fine, shocking window on the more shadowy parts of the modern English-Irish agony that knowledgeable Americans cannot afford to ignore,'' Francis X. Clines said in The Book Review in 1988. MASTERS OF ATLANTIS, by Charles Portis. (McGraw-Hill, $6.95.) From his very own secret temple in a suburb of Gary, Ind., Lamar Jimmerson and his fellow illuminati protect the secret wisdom of the lost continent of Atlantis. Charles Portis, the author of ''True Grit,'' has a ''pitch-perfect ear for the solemnly ridiculous,'' The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in 1985. ''A purpose infuses the craziness, a sense that the author is after something bigger than jokes.'' HEROES OF THEIR OWN LIVES. The Politics and History of Family Violence: Boston 1880-1960, by Linda Gordon. (Penguin, $8.95.) By studying almost a century's worth of records from three Boston agencies devoted to protecting children, Linda Gordon constructed a history of society's attitudes toward child abuse, incest and wife beating. This is ''feminist scholarship at its best,'' Kenneth Keniston said in The Book Review last year. GENTLEMEN IN ENGLAND: A Vision, by A. N. Wilson. (Penguin, $6.95.) Horace Nettleship, head of a middle-class Victorian family, gives up God for geology, then discovers that his son wants to become a man of the cloth. ''Laden with literary allusions, studded with cameo appearances by Victorian luminaries, steaming with the scientific, religious and esthetic controversies of the day, lightly and fantastically comical, yet filled with moments of luminous insight, this is one of Wilson's most ambitious and successful novels,'' one reviewer said in 1986. Penguin has also reissued Mr. Wilson's first novel, THE SWEETS OF PIMLICO ($6.95), in which Evelyn Tradescant, a lonely woman who loves natural history, is pursued by a mysterious elderly man. It was published in 1977. EMBATTLED COURAGE: The Experience of Combat in the American Civil War, by Gerald F. Linderman. (Free Press, $11.95.) In his analysis of their letters, diaries and memoirs, a historian captures the frightening innocence of the men who so eagerly rushed to fight in the battles between North and South. The result is a book ''that comes a good deal closer to a true understanding of the Civil War soldier than we have had before,'' Stephen W. Sears said here in 1987. THE FIFTH ESTATE, by Ferdinando Camon. Translated by John Shepley. (Marlboro, $9.95.) When Patrizia, a girl from the city, moves in with a family of Italian peasants, she seems to them like an ambassador from another world. Ferdinando Camon's novel of Italian life in the decade after World War II ''paints a scene like a Bruegel canvas,'' Susan Zuccotti said here last year. ''These peasants have an animal sensitivity, intuition rather than intelligence.'' The publisher has also reissued Mr. Camon's LIFE EVERLASTING ($10.95), a novel about how the lives of these people were disrupted by the two world wars. In both books, John Shepley's translation is ''invariably smooth and vivid,'' the reviewer said. JOHN McGRAW, by Charles C. Alexander. (Penguin, $8.95.) As manager of the New York Giants in the early decades of the century, John J. McGraw was ''the incarnation of rowdyism, the personification of meanness and howling blatancy,'' one contemporary sportswriter said. Charles C. Alexander ''blows away the golden dust of myth and weaves his history with such restraint and precision that we recognize the game of McGraw and Cobb,'' John Hough Jr. said in The Book Review in 1988. OFFSHORE, by Penelope Fitzgerald. (Carroll & Graf, $7.95.) This novel about eccentric Britons living on barges moored in the Thames is written with ''great care and skill,'' Barbara Fisher Williamson said in The Book Review in 1987. ''Ms. Fitzgerald excels at deft touches of characterization and dialogue.'' The book won England's Booker Prize in 1979. ALL MY FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE STRANGERS, by Larry McMurtry. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $7.95.) After Danny Deck sells his first novel, he leaves Houston and the only people in his life who seem stable, Emma Horton and her husband, Flap. Then he heads for San Francisco, wondering whether it's possible for a writer to stay creative and lead a normal life. In 1972 one reviewer called the novel ''acute, elegiac, funny and dangerously tender.'' Emma, who first entered the world in Mr. McMurtry's novel ''Moving On,'' shows up again in the newly reissued TERMS OF ENDEARMENT ($8.95) as the daughter of Aurora Greenway, a widow whose many suitors include a retired general (converted into an astronaut for the movie version). ''Through three very different books . . . Emma kept growing on me,'' Mr. McMurtry says in a preface to this new edition. And Touchstone has also reissued his 1968 collection, IN A NARROW GRAVE: Essays on Texas ($7.95). ''What I didn't know then,'' he writes in the preface to this new edition of the essays, ''was that I was about to leave not merely the land itself but also the rural point of view and, in a sense, the myth.'' RIDING THE IRON ROOSTER: By Train Through China, by Paul Theroux. (Ivy, $4.95.) In another of his railway chronicles, Paul Theroux writes about a miserable year he spent touring China. Last year our reviewer, Mark Salzman, said Mr. Theroux is better at evoking the land than the people. ''He is in top form as he describes the barren deserts of Mongolia and Xinjiang, the ice forests of Manchuria and the dry hills of Tibet. He captures their otherworldly, haunting appearances perfectly. . . . [ But ] although he saw every corner of the country, ate plenty of Chinese food, visited lots of museums and met a variety of people, apparently [ he ] didn't make any Chinese friends.'' ISLAND, by Thomas Perry. (Avon, $3.95.) Working almost from scratch, a con man makes his own Caribbean island from a mostly submerged reef, promoting it as an offshore tax haven and a tourist resort. Then he tries to join the United Nations and repel covetous invaders. Thomas Perry's novel is ''wacky, imaginative, funny, serious and altogether different,'' Newgate Callendar said in The Book Review last year. ''Try not to miss it.''",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

In his new book of short stories, ''Renewal Time,'' Mr. Mphahlele collects haunting scenes from that childhood, steeps them in the alienation of his lengthy exile, which lasted from 1957 to 1977, and illustrates the bitter estrangement he experienced upon his return. In his introduction, drawn from his 1984 autobiography, ''Afrika My Music,'' he describes his early literary focus as ''the drama of life as lived in the ghetto,'' a perspective that regarded '' 'white' life merely as peripheral'' to his concerns. But this new book clearly aims for a broader picture. Far from peripheral, whites have now become central to the author's acid observations and caustic view. In ''The Living and the Dead,'' for example, a black South African, a sanitation worker named Lebona, delivers a letter he has found on the street to the home of a wealthy white, only to be accused of opening it and thus receive a dressing-down. ''They're not even decent enough to suspect one's telling the truth!'' Lebona thinks of the man, and by extension all whites. ''They always lie to you when you're white,'' the white man thinks, as if in reply. In the ensuing dialogue, the more Lebona tries to impress the white man that he has performed a service, the greater is the other's mistrust and disdain. Similarly, in another story, ''A Ballad of Oyo,'' a South African exile observes an open-air market in Nigeria where the local women laugh in ridicule at the sight of a white missionary who brings her own scale to weigh meat before aggressively trying to bargain down the price. ''Ninepence is too much,'' another white woman says, as the negotiations are concluded. And so she leaves, defeated, as are so many people in these stories, by mutual suspicion and unfamiliarity.",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

Roosevelt from a cerebral hemorrhage, a new book about the man and his accomplishments went on sale.

Pocket's editor in chief, Donald Porter Geddes, spent a long weekend gathering and editing the text - biography, tributes, poetry, photographs - with the cooperation of scholars and news organizations. By Monday morning, copy was sent to a printing plant in Massachusetts, which rearranged its production schedule for the occasion. Within hours of reaching stores and newsstands, the 340,000-copy printing was completely sold out; millions of copies could have been sold if the paper supply hadn't been limited by wartime restrictions. In ensuing years, scores of similar ''instant books'' were issued by paperback houses to mark significant events, including ''Report of the Warren Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy'' (1964), ''Ninety Minutes to Entebbe'' (1976), ''Sayings of Ayatollah Khomeini'' (1980) and ''The Pursuit of the Presidency'' (1980).",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

It was the 21st world championship for the Soviet Union since 1954. The Soviet team, winning its ninth consecutive game in the championships, has 4 points in the four-team medal round. Czechoslovakia, which earlier yesterday edged Sweden, 2-1, can also reach 4 points by beating Canada in the finale tomorrow. But the Soviets, who will play Sweden in their last game, will still win the world title because they defeated the Czechoslovaks, 1-0, in Friday's medal-round opener. The KLM line - the center Igor Larionov and the wings Vladimir Krutov and Sergei Makarov - failed to live up to its reputation in the previous games. But Larionov scored two goals in the opening period, and Krutov added another one as the Soviets took a 3-1 first-period lead. Last night, the Soviet coach, Viktor Tikhonov, said his players - including the stars on the KLM line - would be allowed to compete in the National Hockey League. Soviet authorities ''will make no problems'' for them, Tikhonov said.(AP) Tennis Mancini and Becker in Final: Alberto Mancini of Argentina and Boris Becker of West Germany gained the final of the $607,500 Monte Carlo Open tournament in Monaco yesterday by taking straight-set semifinal victories.

Postlewait had a 36-hole total of 10-under-par 134 on the par-72, 6,242-yard Hermitage course.

us,NONFICTION,"DOCUMENTING AMERICA, 1935-1943. Edited by Carl Fleischhauer and Beverly W. Brannan. (University of California, Paper, $24.95; Cloth, $60.) Photography as a reliable means of historical documentation has always been problematic. Even in the 1930's, when documentary photography came into its own, questions arose concerning objectivity and the use of photography as propaganda. ''Documenting America'' examines the use of photography by the United States Government, which in 1935 hired Roy E. Stryker to assemble a group of photographers to compile a series of pictures that would rally opinion in favor of New Deal programs. The most frequently published images from the 77,000 photographs, including work by Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans and Russell Lee, have become icons of economic hardship. But behind the disturbing portrayals of migrant workers and sharecroppers lies a neglected body of work, which, presented in series, discloses much more than the single, potent image of what the historian Lawrence W. Levine, in a essay in the book, calls ''perfect victims.'' The photographs in ''Documenting America,'' edited by two curators at the Library of Congress, Carl Fleischhauer and Beverly W. Brannan, depict, above all, the dignity unearthed by adversity. The methods that turn photographs into propaganda are often subtle, even unconscious. But, as the historian Alan Trachtenberg suggests, this collection presents an opportunity to ''revise a received opinion'' and glimpse the ways in which our own perceptions are shaped.",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Sammi Davis: Just Right for D. H. Lawrence,"Four years ago, Sammi Davis was an anorexic young refugee from the English Midlands living in a damp London flat and hoping to break into acting. Now, at 24, she has eight film roles behind her and is poised for stardom with her performance as Ursula Brangwen in Ken Russell's version of D. H. Lawrence's ''Rainbow,'' opening in New York on Friday at the Paris. It is something of a Cinderella story; except that Sammi Davis (the name, incidentally, derives from the character Grace Kelly played in ''High Society,'' rather than the American entertainer) has an earthy directness of the kind you don't associate with fairy-tale heroines. Miss Davis has arrived at stardom via none of the usual routes. She never went to acting school, and her theatrical experience is minimal. She was born in the rather gray Midlands town of Kidderminster into a large family (her father runs a local advertising agency) with no show-business connections. Hating both the regimentation of her convent school (''You didn't speak unless you were spoken to,'' she says, ''and you weren't allowed to have any ideas at all'') and the world of competitive swimming into which she was involuntarily thrust, she found escape and fulfillment through acting.",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

us,IN THE GRASP OF ROMANCE: MY LIFE AS FIONA HILL,"I read my first historical romance in a fog composed of equal parts Darvon and pain. I was 20 years old, a junior in college, and I had just had my wisdom teeth removed. Realizing I'd be too woozy to read my assigned Keats and Coleridge, I had plucked the book at random from a rack of paperbacks at the drugstore; propped up on three pillows, I opened it hopefully. It was wonderful. The story chiefly concerned monks hiding treasures during the English Reformation. The facts weren't particularly accurate, but you could cut the atmosphere with a broadsword, and the plot was so intricate that as my head cleared, my admiration grew for the author, who was about to resolve what appeared to me to be a truly insoluble mystery. Then, a scant 10 pages from the end, she introduced a mute, illiterate giant. It was he, we were told, who had moved the enormous coffers intact from Point A to Point B, yet ever afterwards (perforce) kept mum. Finis. I sat up in bed, indignant at this parachute jump of an ending, sputtering around the cotton in my cheeks, ''This? This!'' And then, prophetic words of contempt: ''I can do this.'' A year later I graduated. My father, after supporting me without complaint for 21 years, politely inquired how I was planning to earn my living. Living? I had always intended to write novels. I dared, blushing, to stammer out this ambition. My father smiled a smile of amusement, skepticism, irritation and tolerance. A scientist, he proposed (after some discussion) an experiment. He would keep me afloat for six months while I worked part time and used my off hours to take a shot at writing a book. I left feeling pleased, but soon realized six months was hardly enough time to conceive, let alone write and sell, a serious novel. Then I remembered the monks. Suppose I sold a historical novel? Might not such a demonstration of ability inspire this kindly, scientific, art-patronizing father to run the experiment again with, say, a full year of literary freedom? I had studied English and French. I could set my book in London during the Napoleonic wars. I had begun to read up on Wellington and make lists of calamities to feed the plot when a friend, hearing what I was up to, brought me a stack of yellowing Regency romances by Georgette Heyer.",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

Unlike many writers on nature and the out-of-doors, Edward Hoagland is never guilty of concocted mysticism or self-serving, suspect rapture of the deep (or heights). His writing, whether its subject is woodland or the crowded waterways around Manhattan - both landscapes are included in this volume - is distinguished by his direct, intense observations and the associations to which they give rise. Mr. Hoagland is a delightful writer with an unendingly interesting mind. In ''Heart's Desire'' we have a sampling of the range of Mr. Hoagland's interests. Included is the celebrated essay ''The Courage of Turtles.'' For people like me, whose feeling, if any, about turtles and their unlikely anatomy is a mild embarrassment, somewhat like seeing an old uncle in his underdrawers, this justly famous essay will forever hold charm, character and interest. My other particular favorite in the collection, ''Mushpan Man,'' takes Johnny Appleseed (of all people!) out of the fourth grade reader to give us a true American eccentric, a hero, a flesh-and-blood man with a benevolent obsession. Mr. Hoagland can be equally vivid when the landscape he observes is his own heart or the hearts of others. ''The Lapping, Itchy Edge of Love'' is as good an account of the torments of fitting together the human jigsaw as we are likely to get. ''Heaven and Nature'' is a stunning reflection on the temptations of suicide for people to whom moving along on life's conveyor belt is no longer enough. The book also includes a delicious portrait of one Henri LaMothe, a 70-year-old man whose specialty, honed over a lifetime, is diving - or, more accurately, flopping - 40 feet into 12 inches of water. Mr. Hoagland also gives us the thrills and chills of the circus' big animal acts, with its snarling tigers, roaring lions, its truly brave and accomplished trainers. And here and there we have the pleasure of pausing before such phrases as one describing leopards that ''sometimes spring down, as heavy as a chunk of iron wrapped in a flag.''",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THE WEST: Stories From Ireland. By Eddie Stack. (Island House, 731 Treat Avenue, San Francisco, Calif. 94110, Paper, $8.50.) Rooted in the soil and soul of the west of Ireland, Eddie Stack's first collection of stories reflects the rough beauty of his homeland. Mr. Stack, who was born in County Clare and educated in Galway, populates these seven stories with characters who take up the daily round in remote village outposts. There's the Warrior Carty, a sozzled former war hero who performs at the Christmas fair by lifting an enormous cartwheel; Brother Mahon, who, in a lather of rage over his students' compositions, humiliates and lashes the boys, periodically pausing to lead them in prayer; and 60-year-old Megga Moore, who distills poteen to earn a living but fantasizes about life in America as a pop singer. These characters, and others like them, express both a steadfast devotion to Ireland and a persistent longing to experience, if only vicariously, the world outside it. ''Time Passes,'' for example, powerfully evokes the despair and ephemeral joy of men on the dole, whose drab lives are transformed by the annual Christmas homecoming of ''the Lads,'' the men who've gone to work in England. For one glorious week, they join their old friends in the pubs and tell of life abroad: ''And things beyond were always good.'' Variously fantastic, comic, elegiac and nostalgic, Mr. Stack's fiction is versatile and engaging. He chronicles life in the Irish-speaking west in a vivid, compassionate, authentic voice, thereby securing a place in the celebrated tradition of his country's storytelling.",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

Those that have been proposed by staff members of the Department of City Planning, and are currently under consideration by the City Planning Commission, are potentially more far-reaching in their consequences citywide than any since 1961, when the current city zoning amendment was revised. They affect all the land zoned for attached low-rise housing. The amendments would apply broadly to all R-3, R-4 and R-5 zones in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. These are not the lowest-density R-1 and R-2 zones, where new housing must be detached or semi-detached. But land in many of the attached-housing zones was built years ago with one-family homes. Many of their owners are hoping that the amendments, and mapped contextual districts that will follow them, will stop or at least slow the intrusion of new buildings that in recent years have seemed almost notoriously incompatible in height and size.",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

Last week, a judge assigned to review the case ordered his release, ruling that the 1968 trial was marred by prosecutors' misconduct and perjured testimony. A special prosecutor and lawyers for Mr. Richardson presented testimony pointing to the baby sitter, Betsy Reese, as a suspect. She is in a nursing home suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

In 1971, the United States Supreme Court upheld a Federal District Court decision that transformed American education. No one felt the effects sooner than the people of Charlotte, N.C., whose school board had been ordered to employ all known methods, including busing, to extinguish segregation in its schools. Frye Gaillard, who covered the crisis for The Charlotte Observer and is currently that newspaper's southern editor, has written in ''The Dream Long Deferred'' a compelling account of how the first city to use busing for school desegregation made it work. Mr. Gaillard probes the public drama of bombs, death threats and spitting mobs alongside the private agony of those who determined the city's fate. We see the attorney Julius Chambers stuttering as he rehearses his Supreme Court presentation; the school board chairman William Poe stubbornly resubmitting his limited busing plan, his attempt to prevent not just white flight but anarchy; and genteel Federal District Court Judge James McMillan enforcing his interpretation of the law with insistent authority. Charlotte's eventual success with busing, Mr. Gaillard suggests, led to higher test scores for all students, newly integrated neighborhoods and democracy in local government. Though occasionally too polite and cautious in his assessments, Mr. Gaillard offers thorough research, perceptiveness, balance and an engaging style that leaves room for one's own conclusions.",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

The series' second life began in 1965, when two science fiction/ fantasy fans, editors at Ballantine Books, decided to package the three volumes as a $2.85 boxed set for Christmas giving. The 50,000 copies of the set promptly sold out, but it was the word-of-mouth enthusiasm of college students across the country that turned it into one of 1966's biggest best sellers.

As has happened in some families, Mr. Karajan, now 81, may have overstayed his welcome. More recently there was discord between an autocratic maestro and an orchestra trying to reassert its independence. Last week, Mr. Karajan resigned, ending a 34-year relationship between what some music lovers said was the greatest living conductor and the world's finest orchestra. He cited a back ailment and the lack of specified duties in the vague terms of his lifetime contract. Medical tests, he said, ''have proved to me that I am unable to carry on my duties as I would want.''",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

It is nearly impossible to compare strands of pearls, or other pieces of jewelry, if they are not being evaluated side by side. Her comparison of Falconer's ''pink-hued pearls'' in Hong Kong and New York assumes there is only one shade of pink, and then overlooks the quality of the ''skin'' of the pearls. As she mentioned earlier, blemishes change the value of pearls immensely. There is no gainsaying the fact that shops on 47th Street in New York may charge more for a similar product than those in Hong Kong, but being certain one is comparing identical products is the question.",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

By some accounts, life for the average Soviet citizen is now worse than it was before Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power. As a result, many Soviet political leaders are desperately seeking new ideas - and Nikolai P. Shmelyov, head of the economics department at the Institute for the U.S.A. and Canada in Moscow, is one person to whom they turn. Mr. Shmelyov, who was elected to the Soviet parliament earlier this month as a representative of the Academy of Science, was in New York on April 10, to address a meeting on the progress of perestroika at the Institute for East-West Security Studies. After the meeting, Mr. Shmelyov spoke with the Business Forum editor, Joel Kurtzman, about perestroika and its pitfalls. Q. You have said that what the Soviet Union needs is not more economic growth, but less of it. What do you mean by less economic growth? Mr. Shmelyov: Yes, I said this, but not with respect to high tech. We need growth in the high-tech sectors of our economy, like computers. But in the rest of the economy we produce a real surplus of trash of every kind. We produce more steel than we need, more tractors of bad quality and make more shoes of poor quality than anyone else. We have huge stockpiles and inventories of these goods. For five years or so we need zero rates of growth for most of the economy because of these stockpiles. We may need minus growth in these areas. Q. How will growth in the high-tech sectors be accomplished? Mr. Shmelyov: From state investment, state credit facilities and even artificial price supports. This would be accomplished through central planning.",1989-04-30T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Schwarz acknowledged that his proposal still had rough edges that are likely to be polished by the commission before being presented to the voters in November.
