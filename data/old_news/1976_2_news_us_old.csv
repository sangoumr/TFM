If he slips a good horse into a cheap race to win a bet, he risks losing him. If he enters the horse over his head, he stands little chance of winning. Any owner racing at the meeting may drop a claim in the box before the race.

us,'Gable and Lombard' Revives Cliches,"""Gable and Lombard,"" which opened at three theaters yesterday, is a fan-magazine movie with the emotional zap of a long-lost Louella Parsons column. It's the somewhat reworked, no longer exclusive story of the Hollywood courtship and marriage of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard in the late 1930's and early 40's.They meet for the first time at one of those screwball parties Hollywood was apparently noted for, an afternoon party where everyone is dressed in evening clothes. Clark refuses to wear what was then known as a ""soup-and-fish."" He's a rugged individualist. So is Carole, who arrives by ambulance and wrecks Clark's car. They fight. He threatens to spank her. She knocks him down with a punch to the jaw.It's love, of course. At first it's a back-street kind of love (he's married), full of the tensions created by career conflicts, public relations duties and a benign Louis B. Mayer, the true king of M-G-M who doesn't want Clark's career damaged by scandal.But it is also full of precious, golden moments, stolennay snatchedfrom the hurly-burly of Hollywood stardom. They go fishing together. They play practical jokes on each other and though the jokes don't seem very funny to us, we can be pleased that the funnybones of Gable and Lombard are in their ankles. They laugh a lot, and fight, and make up. Through all this we know what they don't know: that the fun-loving, life-loving, beautiful Carole is not long for this world. You might say that theirs was a love stalked by tragedythat is, if you adopted the style of this film.As written by Barry Sandler and directed by Sidney J. Furie, ""Gable and Lombard"" recalls not ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Honky Tonk,"" ""Twentieth Century,"" ""Nothing Sacred"" or ""To Be or Not to Be,"" but clichs culled from the worst movies of that period. The actors don't help. James Brolin and Jill Clayburgh look a little like Gable and Lombard and a little more like Hamilton (George) and Lynley (Carol).Of the two, Miss Clayburgh comes off better. She appears to be creating a character whenever the fear-fully bad screenplay allows it. Mr. Brolin doesn't act. He gives an impersonation of the sort that makes you wonder if he can also do James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson.Miss Clayburgh could be an interesting actress, but she's not a great one, nor is she a star, and there are always problems when small performers try to portray the kind of giant legends that Gable and Lombard were. Because both Gable and Lombard are still very much alive in their films on television and in repertory theaters, there is difficulty in responding to Mr. Brolin and Miss Clayburgh in any serious way. They are stand-ins.Life for actors often gets mixed up with the roles they play, but that's no reason why a movie about actors should get so hopelessly mixed up with the movies the actors made. In ""Gable and Lombard,"" Gable and Lombard ""meet cute"" (is that Anita Loos's phrase?) not once but a dozen times.Although Carole swears a lot and makes a couple of obscene gestures in the course of the movie, both Gable and Lombard speak in the phrases of refined drivel that Lolly Parsons would have loved.Life is okay, a philosophical Gable says at one point, ""as long as you can look in the mirror and like what you see."" ""Listen,"" says the emotionally distraught Lombard, ""I'm the No. 1 female star in America and I never said 'I love you' to anyone and meant it."" My favorite, though, is delivered by Red Buttons, who plays Gable's pal at the time the actor begins to fall for Lombard: ""First time a dame ever got to you?""Turn on your telly for the real thing.",1976-02-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen::'Cher Victor' A Story of Revenge on a Longtime Friend,"Victor (Jacques Dufilho) is a widower, a small, nervous bullet-headed man with a furious temper. Anselm (Bernard Blier) is, like Victor, retired, but he's everything Victor is notgentle, patient, kind, a slow starter. Victor and Anselm have been friends for 40 years, and for the last eight they have shared a tiny apartment in a middle-class quarter of Paris. It's not been easy.When Anselm, who does the cooking, tells Victor they're having sausages and potatoes for lunch, Victor says crossly he doesn't like sausages and potatoes. ""Last week you did,"" says Anselm. ""This week I don't,"" says Victor. So it goes until one day at the corner pub, Victor, trying to teach Anselm manners in front of a lady, snatches Anselm's beret off his head, only to snatch off Anselm's toupee as well.Victor doesn't know it, but that's the beginning of his end.""Cher Victor,"" the French film that opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is the story of Anselm's carefully plotted revenge on Victor, whom he drives slowly mad with suspicions that Victor's wife, dead eight years, had been unfaithful to her husband throughout their long marriage.""Cher Victor"" is not exactly a black comedy. It's rather more gray, which, I suspect, is just the tone that Robin Davis, the director, was seeking though the charm eludes me. It's a film of small details, methodically composed, which are sometimes funny in themselves, but which in the end have the effect of canceling one another out.Victor is an unpleasant man, but his bigotry, selfishness and temper tantrums aren't maniacally funny in the way that those of Louis De Funes were in a film like ""The Mad Adventures of 'Rabbi' Jacob."" He's a difficult old crab, nothing more, neither horrendous nor horrendously funny enough to support the punishment he receives.Anselm, too, fails to be particularly convincing. From the very beginning it is so apparent that here is a worm about to turn that one almost blames him for not controlling events better, but then there would be no film.""Cher Victor"" is very much a movie that calls attention to its modesty. In its gray sort of way, it seems pushy because though it's not really about anything, it asks for our attention. Mr. Dufilho and Mr. Blier don't overact. Instead they underact with the kind of deliberation that is just as gross as any amount of scenery-chewing.Ultimately ""Cher Victor"" is less a reflection of life than an accumulation of stunts, including the casting of the now matronly, still handsome but hardly over-the-hill Alida Valli as the two old men's nutty neighbor who imagines herself once to have been a great opera star. Miss Valli and her two costars seem to be having so much fun acting and carrying on that I feel churlish to have to report that I found them all a good deal less than riveting.",1976-02-13T05:00:00+0000

In the Northeastern soils, which tend to be acid, the acidity releases certain plant nutrients and permits them to be taken up by plant roots. This is particularly true with iron, manganese and aluminum. These are nutrients needed in small quantities by plants, particularly the ericaceous rhododendrons, azaleas, hillies, etc. How, ever, too much availability of these nutrients to certain other plants can create a toxicity problem. Lime is added fo lock them up. On the other hand phosphorus, required fot good develpment of flowers and fruit, is more readily available to plants when the soil is properly limed.

us,Screen: 'Chinese Bookie':Cassavetes Is Director of Bland Effort,"John Cassavetes's ""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie,"" which opened yesterday at the Columbia I and II Theater, is like the last three of the director's films (""A Woman Under the Influence,"" ""Husbands"" and ""Minnie and Moskowitz"") in the way it resolutely refuses to come to a point strong or interesting enough to support the loving care that's gone into its production, particularly on the part of the actors.Watching the film is like listening to someone use a lot of impressive words, the meanings of which are just wrong enough to keep you in a state of total confusion, but occasionally right enough to hold your attention. What is he trying to say? It takes a little while to realize that maybe the speaker not only doesn't know but doesn't even care to think things out. He hopes that if he continues to talk he may happen upon a truth as if it were a found object.Though ""A Woman Under the Influence"" contained an impressive performance by Gena Rowlands as a truly mad housewife, the film never succeeded in establishing her in any convincing frame of family or society. She was one woman with her bag of tricks doing her show on a barren stage. The film lacked a consistent point of view, or perhaps it had as many as it had actors, director and cameramen.""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie"" has nothing to compare with the spectacle of the Rowlands performance in ""A Woman Under the Influence,"" but next to that earlier film it's virtually Bressonian in the rigidity of its purpose and style. It even has a story of sorts.The story doesn't always make sense, but supporters of Mr. Cassavetes can argue that narrative coherence is not his bag. My suspicion is that either the film has been sloppily edited or that the director has no film idea on how to film the sort of sequences in which one actor with a gun stalks another actor with a gun in a dark garage. In the trade this is known as an action sequence and it quickly becomes rather too existential if you can't figure out who is stalking whom, or why.""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie"" is about Cosmo Vitelli (Ben Gazzara), the owner of a tacky nightclub on Hollywood's Sunset Strip, and Cosmo's troubles when the mob coerces him into carrying out a contract murder in order to pay off a $23,000 gambling debt. That's the story, but the film has less interest in story than in character, for which, in Mr. Cassavetes's vocabulary, you may also read actor.Mr. Cassavetes's way of film making is to set up actors, whom he admires, trusts and finds endlessly fascinating, in situations in which they are as likely to philosophize about acting as about life. Actingperformanceis a legitimate metaphor for certain kinds of lives but by the end of ""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie"" you may rightfully expect more than you have actually received. This includes a lot of enigmatic snatches of Cosmo's nightclub shows, bits and pieces of intentionally awful sketches, as well as Cosmo's relationships to his ""girls"" and his emcee (a self-described ""freak,"" played with good, self-contained desperation by Meade Roberts, the screen writer.Perhaps because of the limitations imposed on Mr. Cassavetes by his screenplay, his actors are more restrained than they have been in his past efforts, though some of them are nice to see because they are familiar, especially Seymour Cassel (so good in ""Faces"" and ""Minnie and Moskowitz"") who plays a polite mobster.Mr. Gazzara is also comparatively restrained, or perhaps inhibited, by the requirements of the particular character he's playing here. It's a thoughtful, intelligent interpretation of a role that just may not have as much depth to it as he's ready to give it. Like the movie itself, it is, finally, bland.",1976-02-16T05:00:00+0000

Instead, the debate about nuclear safety appears to be shifting toward issues that could be called sociological or institutional. The main concern is whether nuclear fuel processors, the electric utility industry and the agencies that oversee them are organized so as to maintain maximum pressure for nuclear safety. Technical concern about the possibility of major releases of radioactivity from nuclear powerplant accidents has received wide public attention for more than five years, virtually since the first nuclear plants with a capacity of more than 500 million watts began supplying electricity in the United States in 1969.

Marvelous at swimming. they arc capable of darting rapidly in any direction as well as hovering like a helicopter about to deposit a President. Tender at lovemaking, the male (or Jimmy) cradles the mature female (or Sook) until she moults her hard shell, then rears up and copulates for from 6 to 12 hours, then cradles her once more (the two together are called doublers or buck and rider) until her new outer layer grows safely hard again. Prodigious at migrating, Atlantic blues have shown up as far from their home grounds as the Black Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean (from where Israel fishes and sells them for export, since dietary laws prohibit their consumption). A gustatory delight, blue crabs are removed from Chesapeake Bay at the rate of between 150 and 240 million individuals a year, worth approximately $55 million. But not least among the blue crab's many surprising achievements is to have inspired William W. Warner to write Beautiful Swimmers: Watermen, Crabs and the Chesapeake Bay.

And this reader came away as refreshed and stimulated as he would have been by a week's worth of sailing on the Chesapeake.",1976-02-17T05:00:00+0000

But his trial looms as one of the most compelling in sports historya peek into the machinations of the National Football League as they affected a tequiladrinking quarterback who thrived on defiance. The primary issue will be whether Sports Joe Kapp was damaged, and if so, how of much, by the N.F.L. contract structure that Federal District Judge William T. Sweigert ruled illegal 14 months ago. One of Kapp's attorneys has predicted that his client might be awarded as much as $10 million in treble damages, surely a minimum of $2 million.

Mr. Gould roars and wheedles and sulks and looks selfish and appealing. They are very rich, live in a sumptuous New York apartment, employ a humorous Spanish maid (Thelma Ritter used to do it Swedish), and have no recognizable worries.They do have unrecognizable worries, of the carpentered sort Hollywood used to invent for Rock Hudson and Doris Day to thrash around with. In this case, a stale 1950's poundcake of a moviethe old double-takes, smirks, shoulder shrugs are lifted carefully from their moth covers and hung upon us once morehas been given what will pass for a 1970's gimmick.The couple's sex life is poor. He is quick and she is dead, or virtually. ""You make love as if you were catching a Fifth Avenue bus,"" she says. ""You make love as if you were playing chess,"" he says.They have divorced each other, are unhappy, reuniteby contract arrangement rather than actual marriageare still unhappy. A vampish upstairs neighbor lends him ""The Joy of Sex"" to improve things. He puts his back out following the instructions.They go to an expensive sex clinic and there's a lot of underwear in the wrong beds, but no real sex. She still can't melt. ""Give me a four-letter word for sexual intercourse,"" the clinic ring-master asks her. ""Love,"" she says.I like that line, but not much else. Norman Panama, who directed and wrote a great many comedies over the last 30 years, a number of them successful, directed this one and helped write it. Neither job is well done.Nor is the acting, although Paul Sorvino is mildly amusing in a supporting role until he chokes it to death, To cast Elliott Gould for repartee comedy is to mistake a camel for an antelope. ""I Will, I Will"" should make people happy that they don't make movies like that any more.",1976-02-19T05:00:00+0000

A generation ago religious healing was relegated to the Christian Scientists, to tambourine  thumping pentecostal store fronts and miraculous Catholic shrines. But in the last two decades a mammoth revival of healing evangelism has swept across America, bursting class and denominational barriers, moving from makeshift tents first into giant auditoriums and onto network TV, and then into respectable churches. The message of this movement is also about salvation from sin, but the main thrust is something else: miracles still happen and God's spirit is abroad in the land healing and making whole. In a significant rebirth of a phenomenon that has been part of religion since its inception, healing the sick is the central feature of the spiritual renascence this book describes.",1976-02-22T05:00:00+0000

The very idea of the growing up novel (Bildungsrornan), that German specialty, implied a criticism of the limitations of formal education. Goethe doesn't show Wilhelm Meister in the classroom nor Thomas Mann Hans Castorp; their true education is an education in life. It's true a great English poet had called books barren leaves and disliked his Cambridge years, finding Nature (and the dropout Coleridge) better teachers.

Hence, aided by a spate of prepublication peeks at the book by political columnists, Born Again went into first and second printings totaling 60,000 copies before publication. As resident Recording Angel here, we will tot up the accounts on both sides of the ledger from the standpoint of its publishing history. First the good news. Mr. Colson turned down fivefigure offers from several major publishing houses and instead took his book, for considerably less advance money, to a small firm in Lincoln, Va., called Chosen Books. Since Chosen Books is actually an editorial packaging or manuscript preparation firm, specializing in religious books, Born Again is distributed by Fleming H. Revell, an old established religious publisher which is far from a devout band of amateurs, having published a whopping best seller called The Total Woman. Then too, on the commercial side, Mr. Colson is off on a major twomonths, promotion tour. On the other hand, Mr. Colson's tour is being plannedaround his busy schedule of lectures, fees from which he donates to his prison ministry. Of course, with all the publicity the book could make a lot of money; but on still another hand, Mr. Colson says he will also donate part of his book royalties to the Fellowship Foundation, a group of Washington Christians who sponsor prayer breakfasts and other good works.",1976-02-22T05:00:00+0000

But Miss Freud had good reason to keep insisting, in her tactful but firm way, that those whose job it is to understand troubled children, and bring to them a measure of relief from difficult and exhausting worries or fears, had best not presume what a given child is thinking and feeling, or maybe struggling against bravely but unsuccessfully.

They asked architect J. Woodson Rainey Jr. and his wife, Toni, who lived in the building, to redesign the 12by22foot space for them. The room had once been a servant's during the days when the building was a residential hotel, and it had not been renovated for 40 years. It was partitioned into a bedroom and a bathroom; the building's rusty steam pipe ran through a space over the door; and there was so little daylight that lights were needed at high noon. The only reusable surface was the floor, says Woodson Rainey. The need to build a kitchen and a new bathroom and to hide the plumbing lines led to the room's most dramatic architectural feature. The Raineys built a platform, two steps up from the living area, to create a space for the kitchen and the bathroom. This platform crosses the room on the diagonal and extends as a ledge beneath the windows. A long step, which can serve as a table or as a place to sit, juts out into the room. over the platform, at a 45degree angle. Part of the ceiling was lowered to cover the steam pipe. There are only two pieces of conventional furniture, an Italian sleep sofa and an antique Windsor chair. The walls are all white, except for the front door, which is bright yellow. A thin stripe of the same shade of yellow outlines one wall in the kitchen. To hide the dismal view and to provide light, the Raineys extended the window wall six inches and installed fluorescent lights behind translucent panels of etched glass.",1976-02-22T05:00:00+0000

The Mint took pains to emphasize that the collection includes an 1804 silver dollar (the historic Stickney coin), but did not even mention the controversial nature of this coinage. The fact is that all of the 1804dated silver dollars (a specimen is illustrated above) were special presentation coins, somewhat like the frivolous noncirculating legal tender proof coins being issued by many foreign governments today. All of the 1804 silver dollars were struck in the 1830's and later, not in 1804; they were made for private purposes and were neither issued nor intended for circulation. Nevertheless, by some mysterious chemistry combining secret origins and ownership and endless publicity, these dollars have become glamorous and famous; they command sixfigure prices and are highly esteemed by the cognoscenti. Of course, the Eliasberg collection also includes specimens of all of the legitimate coinsthe commonest and the great raritiesstruck for circulation during the 184year history of the U.S. Mint.",1976-02-22T05:00:00+0000

A great poet might possibly be able to express the numbing evenness, the emptiness and helplessness, in short the intangible horror of imprisonment. Compared to what should be said, the diary remains nothing but a catalogue, usually of trivialities. Which is true enough: It would be absurd to argue that reading Spandau: The Secret Diaries in the cornfort of an armchair can remotely approximate Speer's lifeconsuming ordeal. Still, the book does contain indirect signals of what the 20 years of confinement were like. There are the 31,816 kilometers that Speer paced off in the prison yard: In his imagination, this 12year stroll took him south to Italy, then east as far as Guadalajara, Mexico; eventually, there are even diary entries describing the scenery through which he imagined himself to be walking.",1976-02-23T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Inserts':Old Hollywood Evoked in Sex-Movie Story,"Not yet 30, Boy Wonder (Richard Dreyfuss) is washed up as a Hollywood director. The year is 1930, and Boy Wonder is reportedly finished. Josef von Sternberg has told someone that he saw Boy Wonder panhandling on the Sunset Strip. Boy Wonder is not quite forgotten, though. Someone tells someone else, who tells Boy Wonder, that ""that new guy at Pathe, Clark Gable,"" has said he'd like to work for Boy Wonder, which gives Boy Wonder a laugh. Boy Wonder is now making pornography films in a corner of the living room of his Spanish-style Hollywood mansion.""Inserts,"" which opened at three theaters yesterday, is the story of 99 manic minutes in the life of Boy Wonder, during which a couple of leftovers from silent Hollywoodtechnology's rejectsmeet and, figuratively speaking, rub shoulders with some hustling representatives of the new, talking Hollywood. The arena for confronations is Boy Wonder's living room, which, like Boy Wonder, the film refuses to leave.""Inserts,"" which opened at three theaters yesterday, is essentially a stunt, a slapstick melodrama in the form of a one-act, one-set, five-character play. It is, however, a very clever, smart-mouthed stunt that, in its self - described ""degenerate"" way, recalls more accurately aspects of old Hollywood than any number of other period films, including ""Gable and Lombard."" It's not anything that ""Inserts"" says, but something to do with the dizzy pace, the wisecracks, the lack of sentimentality and, mostly, the characters, who could be shadowy parodies of once-living legends.""Inserts"" marks the directorial debut of John Byrum, the not-yet-30 screen-writer (""Mahogany,"" among other things), who, on the basis of this breathless stunt, not only knows how to write but also how to direct, especially when it comes to actors.Mr. Dreyfuss must occasionally make plausible dialogue that's too self-conscious for the movie's good, but he gives a remarkably funny, tough and bristly performance as the Hollywood has been who looks scarcely old enough to vote. His chief adversary, a bootlegger on his way to becoming a Hollywood mogul, is played by an equally young but immensely talented English actor, Bob Hoskins, who suggests at least two real-life moguls that I can think of.Veronica Cartwright, who looks a little like Maggie Smith, plays a former Hollywood star now reduced to drugs and porno-film parts, and Jessica Harper, who had a small but vividly funny role in Woody Allen's ""Love and Death,"" plays a tiny, sweet-looking girl with a ferocious ambition to become an actress in ""real movies""and will do anythig to succeed. Stephen Davies, another newcomer, completes the cast as a young man who supplements his earnings as a Forest Lawn gravedigger by acting in Boy Wonder's porno-films, waiting for his star potential to be recognized and made legitimate.Although ""Inserts"" has been rated X, it is not pornographic itself. It's a beautifully acted, tough-talking comedy that, at its wildest moments, manages to evoke the comedies of the late Joe Orton. It won't warm the heart, but its bleakness is almost buoyant.",1976-02-28T05:00:00+0000

It is thus understandable that he should have written supposedly lbsenite thesis plays like Widowers Houses and Mrs. Warren's Profession.
