It attracted scientists, the news industry and entertainers. It generated its own forms of commerce, wealth and celebrity and, for a while, inspired its own architecture, the luxurious movie palace. It was itself the focus of constant innovation, from the advent of sound, color and 3-D, to digitalization, which let smartphones and other devices incorporate both filmless cameras and small screens  hand-held movie palaces. And from the very beginning, creative people of all types grasped the cinema as an artistic outlet that would transform traditional storytelling and popular culture while giving a new focus to the international avant-garde.

Not how it was done, the great writer insisted. The Duelist, a Russian-made picture about a former nobleman making his living as a proxy in honor-restoring matches of shooting skill, never shows such a duel. In this movie, directed by Aleksey Mizgirev and set in 1860 St. Petersburg, the fighters meet at close range, sometimes stand separated by a screen, and face off in other visually interesting ways.

(When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. This meets the fortune cookie test: It would be improved by adding in bed.) For another thing, Coelho seems to be in on the joke. Heres part of the biographical note from his latest novel, The Spy, new at No.18 on the extended hardcover fiction list: He has flirted with death, escaped madness, dallied with drugs, withstood torture, experimented with magic and alchemy, studied philosophy and religion, read voraciously, lost and recovered his faith, and experienced the pain and pleasure of love. In searching for his own place in the world, he has discovered answers for the challenges that everyone faces. If this isnt meant at least 50 percent in jest  again, it helps to append in bed to each item  then Coelhos pharmacological dalliance may not be entirely a thing of the past.",2016-12-02T16:40:24+0000

But compromises were not on his agenda, so it wound up taking two years. Even finding a name was, as he put it, a struggle. (Its the street in the Fordham section of the Bronx where his father lived.) The spacious double storefront from 1848, on the increasingly attractive stretch of Eighth Street west of Fifth Avenue, looks as if it was worth the wait. Whitewashed brick walls contain a barroom and a bilevel dining room decorated simply, with a nod to midcentury modern. Mr. Klugers food is seasonal and market driven. And it builds on his experience working with chefs like Floyd Cardoz at Tabla, which shapes the flavors in his suckling pig and on his cauliflower with Indian seasonings, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten at ABC Kitchen, which inspired a vegetable focus on the menu. Local sourcing is so important to him that hes grinding wheat from upstate for pasta extruded in-house.

The show features just 48 objects, but it encompasses centuries, and much of the work is choice. The earliest piece, a stone sculpture that looks abstract except for two pairs of staring eyes, dates from around 3200 B.C. An exquisitely carved ivory lions head from the eighth or ninth century B.C. has roots in Near Eastern visual traditions shared with Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Christian, Jewish and Islamic influences also came into play and mingled. Throughout all of this, there were periods of murderous struggle. More remarkable, there were even longer stretches of multicultural peace. By closing with contemporary Syrian works, the show suggests that, against all present evidence, there could be peace again.

Trump has not yet moved into the White House but his anticipated policies are already spurring debate over what actions, if any, Canada will need to take in response. That was the case on Friday when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with the provincial and territorial leaders to work out a national approach to pricing on carbon emissions. Before the meeting, Mr. Trudeau set out a plan where the price  either through a fossil fuel tax or a cap-and-trade system of emission allowances  would reach 50 Canadian dollars, or about $38, a metric ton, or 2,205 pounds, over five years. He also warned that provinces that did not buy in would have the price imposed on them. During the presidential election campaign, Mr. Trump said that he would pull the United States out of the climate change commitments made by the Obama administration. Some Canadians, mostly Conservative politicians, say the economy will be in jeopardy if Canada goes ahead with carbon pricing in the absence of American action. But when I looked into the debate, I also found people who argued that moving now on carbon emissions could give Canada a competitive advantage.",2016-12-09T21:09:01+0000

(Its currently No.14.) Abrams, who conceived and helped write the book, is taking some liberties here in the name of comedy  he actually identifies as secular despite his Jewish roots, and the participants really met not in a bar but in the Dalai Lamas residence in Dharamsala, India, over the course of a week last year. But when the subject is joy, a little humor is allowed. See if you can chuckle at your problem, at your shortcomings, at your frailties, the book advises toward the end. Even if it is a very grave or serious situation, there is often some humor that can be found. The human drama is often a comedy, and laughter is the saving grace. (O.K., so those sentences are themselves strikingly earnest and humorless. But do as they say, not as they do.)",2016-12-16T16:11:33+0000

It is not good (even Rollin nuts rate it low), but I checked it out again to see if there was some Christmas or holiday theme Id missed before. No dice.

Anchored by the producer Marley Marl, it included a wide range of provocative rappers. Big Daddy Kane was mercilessly smooth, Kool G Rap a rough-edged storyteller. Craig G was wildly improvisational, and MC Shan and Masta Ace were hard boasters. In Roxanne Shant, they had one of raps foundational tough women, and in Biz Markie, one of raps foundational comedians. Individually, their careers took wildly different directions, but their collective legacy remains strong. These reunion shows, on Thursday, Dec. 29, and Friday, will provide a rare opportunity to see The Symphony, the 1988 Juice Crew posse cut that set a high-water mark for the form, performed live and in full.

Shes going to buy it during the Christmas season, because 35 percent of all books are sold during the Christmas season. I would guess shes probably going to be over 40, because they buy more books than under 40. And that kind of narrows it down. Thats probably my typical reader.
