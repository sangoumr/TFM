(Sundance) ORLANDO (1993) A beautiful young nobleman (Tilda Swinton, above) adored by an aging Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp) falls asleep one night in the 17th century and wakes up five days later as a woman. Same person, no difference at all, she says, unflustered. Just a different sex. She continues to learn about life through the centuries up until the present, pondering the differences between men and women  as well as their similarities  in this adaptation by Sally Potter of Virginia Woolfs 1928 novel. Charlotte Valandrey plays Sasha, a wanton Muscovite princess with whom the male Orlando falls in love. Billy Zane is the American with whom Orlandos female version has a more enduring if less sexually demanding relationship. This ravishing and witty spectacle invades the mind through eyes that are dazzled without ever being anesthetized, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. Orlando could well become a classic of a very special kind, not mainstream perhaps, but a model for independent filmmakers who follow their own irrational muses, sometimes to unmourned obscurity, occasionally to glory. More than anything else, he added: Orlando is Ms. Swintons triumph. With the firmest but lightest of touches, she has spun gossamer.",2015-06-01T04:13:06+0000

He was ubiquitous for decades and, as president, left a lasting imprint on Americas political culture. Yet he was all the same an unknowable man  even to those nearest him. In White House meetings, he was mostly silent, often leaving his aides to guess at (and feud over) his views. In his personal relationships, he was unfailingly warm but rarely intimate. He doesnt let anybody get too close, one observer said. Theres a wall around him. That the observer was his wife, Nancy, should give pause to any politician or pundit who claims to know what Reagan would do if he were here today. (It should, but it wont.)",2015-06-01T09:30:06+0000

Racial strife led to nationwide riots. The murders of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy must have made the end times seem at bloody hand. Cue Nixon and that silent majority. Forty-seven years later we still live in the eras apocalyptic shadow, those events a zombie horde in ever-present pursuit  race issues, ill-considered wars, the Russians  that infects us with the undead past. Oh, and you can also blame 1968 for that unfortunate metaphor, because in October of that year George A. Romeros Night of the Living Dead introduced us to a new kind of zombie: slow yet relentless, brainless yet hungry, endlessly symbolic yet always supercool. These flesh eaters have fed well on our culture, evolving from B-movie ghouls to bankable, if thankless, stars of film and screen, book and video game, to the point where they should probably unionize.

In April, Sarvshreshth Gupta, a 24-year-old first-year analyst at Goldman Sachs, was found dead in San Francisco after telling his father about suffering from intense stress. The official cause of death has not yet been determined in either case, but a recent string of deaths among young Wall Street workers have prompted financial firms to re-evaluate their work policies impact on staff members,  Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. Its difficult to definitively link a death to a firms work conditions, and Mr. Sorkin notes that studies have suggested that financial service employees are at higher risk than those in many other industries. Still, the string of deaths on Wall Street appears to rise above the level of simple coincidence, he writes. ",2015-06-02T11:29:14+0000

us,South Sudan: U.N. Dismayed by Decline," United Nations officials expressed alarm Tuesday over a further deterioration in South Sudan, where they said recent heavy fighting had displaced more than 100,000 people and blocked aid deliveries to 650,000. Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency in Geneva, told reporters that at least 60,000 South Sudanese had fled since January, mostly to Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda, bringing the total number of refugees to 555,000 since December 2013, when the conflict erupted. Mr. Edwards said that 1.5 million people had been displaced within the country and that a third of the population lacked sufficient food. The news came a day after United Nations officials said South Sudans government had decided to expel the organizations aid coordinator there, Toby Lanzer, who has criticized the South Sudanese armed forces for their role in the fighting. He was nearing the end of his tenure anyway, but Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the expulsion. ",2015-06-03T00:20:16+0000

He renounces racism there, but his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), a high school student, remains steadfast in the attitudes he learned from Derek. After Danny writes a book report on Mein Kampf, his principal, Dr. Robert Sweeney (Avery Brooks, above left, with Mr. Norton), creates a remedial course for him called American History X. Dr. Sweeney visits Derek in prison and they agree to try to persuade Danny to give up his bigotry. American History X has enough fiery acting and provocative bombast to make its impact felt, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times about this film directed by Tony Kaye. For one thing, its willingness to take on ugly political realities gives it a substantial raison dtre. For another, it has been directed with a mixture of handsome photo-realism and visceral punch.

Haydn (1732-1809) isnt just a central composer of that period; he also often exemplifies the same qualities as Mr. Morris: high spirits, terrific humor, a strong inclination to the pastoral and a keen instinct for structural experimentation. Last week, the Houston Ballet gave the premiere of Mr. Morriss The Letter V  choreographed to Haydns Symphony No. 88 in G (1787).

Even for Shawcross  an artist celebrated for his feats of engineering, spanning rope machines, reconfigured robots and even a pair of rotating wooden arms for Raf Simonss runway  this is ambitious. Each of the 8,000 pieces has been handmade in five diminishing scales; when laid flat, the piece comprises about 7  miles of welded steel and weighs in at around 30 tons. It exploits the geometry of the tetrahedron, Shawcross explains of the mass of pyramid shapes. Seen on their own, theyre very rational and ordered, but together, they become totally unruly. So the finished work is full of energy and movement. It looks anarchic against the order and stillness of the courtyard space.",2015-06-03T19:15:47+0000

The rockets landed in open ground and caused no injuries but were a blow to the informal cease-fire that ended last summers 50-day Gaza war. It was the second rocket attack in eight days after a period of relative calm. Although Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, has worked to enforce the cease-fire with Israel, smaller, more radical groups are thought to have been responsible for the recent rocket fire, a sign of internal Palestinian tensions. One such group claimed responsibility for firing the rockets on Wednesday, but Israel says it holds Hamas responsible for all fire emanating from Gaza. In retaliation, Israel on Thursday bombed three militant training camps, but there were no casualties, Reuters reported. ",2015-06-04T01:17:17+0000

us,A Chandelier That Stands the Tests of Time,"I like instruments that try to quantify the ephemeral; a barometer traces air pressure, or an astrolabe charts the stars, and this measures the passing of time, says the artist Alison Berger, gesturing to a printout from the book Pocket Watches: From the Pendant Watch to the Tourbillon. The anatomy of the once-everyday trinket, and her training as an architect and as a glassblower, informed her latest creation, the Clock Chandelier. One gear moves slowly and the other moves quickly  large and small, fast and slow, she says, a rhythm articulated in the spacing of the chandeliers lightbulbs and candles suspended from three interlocking bronze and steel rings. Berger, who has made so-called heirlooms for the upcoming generation (think cereal bowls, in lieu of egg cups) for Herms and has constructed a new faade for a Comme des Garons store, considered each detail: The candlelit lanterns can be unhooked for cleaning and the rings fit together using pins, as they would in a timepiece. The chandelier looks open and endless from one view, but on the other side it is more compressed, Berger says  a metaphor, she explains, for the feeling of, Oh my god, its already 5 oclock.

Researchers at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Canada named their find Regaliceratops peterhewsi. They first stumbled on the bones sticking out of a cliff along the Oldman River, in southeastern Alberta, about a decade ago. Like other horned dinosaurs, Regaliceratops probably evolved during the late Cretaceous, 65 million to 100 million years ago.

Haydn (1732-1809) isnt just a central composer of that period; he also often exemplifies the same qualities as Mr. Morris: high spirits, terrific humor, a strong inclination to the pastoral and a keen instinct for structural experimentation. Last week, the Houston Ballet gave the premiere of Mr. Morriss The Letter V  choreographed to Haydns Symphony No. 88 in G (1787).

Bodies, typically brown and black, were exhibited by scientists as well as impresarios like P.T. Barnum.

us,"The Given World, by Marian Palaia","The story of Riley, the heroine of The Given World  Marian Palaias ardent, ambitious debut novel  might sound familiar at first. It has all the elements of a particular kind of post-60s American coming-of-age story: Farm kid leaves home for the big city (in Rileys case, rural Montana is abandoned for San Francisco) and dives headlong into adulthood, with all of its requisite heartbreak. Drugs are ingested, Janis Joplin is played on a jukebox, and many drives are taken through the countryside on motorcycles or a beat-up Mustang. But The Given World contains what feels like 12 times the usual dose of tragedy within its pages, because Riley and her generation come of age poisoned by the Vietnam War. They are its secondhand casualties; the war has upended their world and rewritten its rules of gravity, so that they fall hard and fall often.",2015-06-05T14:51:12+0000

First appearing in Harpers and collected now with his latest short stories, Coup de Foudre is a thinly  or possibly barely  veiled account of the Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair, in which Strauss-Kahn was accused of sexually assaulting a housekeeper at a New York City hotel. The criminal charges, which led to the disclosure of a hidden world of sex parties and erotic compulsion, came to nothing. But Strauss-Kahn eventually paid a hefty fine after a civil action, and his reputation was ruined, perhaps because of the question that was impossible to ignore: What made him do it? What would cause the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, wealthy and successful beyond measure, to risk everything in such a fashion? ",2015-06-05T14:53:26+0000

Heres how Robert Brink of the website The Hundreds sums up the collection: So this one kid, hes pledging for a frat and drops acid, the Hello Kitty kind, right before hes about to be a contestant on The Price Is Right. And this other guy, he slaps his prostate-cancer-ridden, morphine-pickled father square in the face with a pie as hes dying in his hospital bed.

In an interview with The Wrap, he explained he needed some distance before he felt ready to revisit this story. If I followed it up too soon, he said, my whole career would be writing progressively less interesting sequels to Fight Club. He chose the comics format, he said, because if it was written as a novel or a film, itd be compared to previous versions. ... Certain things work in comics because theres a slight aspect of unreality. Given his reputation for disturbing readers, Palahniuk was asked, what makes him personally squeamish?

He especially loved puns that could be found hiding in one word, like wonderland: a place full of wonders and a place where you wonder what is happening to you. These meanings are not only different, they can be read as opposites, as Robert Douglas-Fairhurst reminds us, quoting a Victorian evocation of a person who, being in a chronic state of wonder, is surprised at nothing. Sentimental memories of the Alice books often stress the first, dazzled meaning, but a fresh reading of Carroll is likely to leave us much closer to the second, which Douglas-Fairhurst neatly formulates as being puzzled at what we do not know. This is how the flowers talk in Through the Looking-Glass: I wonder how you do it, a rose says to Alice, referring to her odd human ability to move about.

us,Whats on TV Tuesday,"1 P.M. (SYFY) THE PRESTIGE (2006) Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) work together as assistants in magic performances before a tragedy turns them into lifelong enemies. As performing magicians, they seek vengeance on each other through obsessive one-upmanship. Rebecca Hall and Michael Caine play supporting roles as Angiers wife and his manager. The Prestige, directed by Christopher Nolan from a script he wrote with his brother Jonathan, is an intricate and elaborate machine designed for the simple purpose of diversion, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Set in a stylized late-Victorian world of dueling music-hall magicians and diabolically clever inventors, it has a satisfyingly puzzlelike structure, zipping around in time and scattering clues throughout its busy scenes and frames. Like Memento, also directed by Christopher Nolan and based on a story by his brother, The Prestige is a triumph of gimmickry, a movie generous enough with its showmanship and sleight of hand to quiet the temptation to grumble about its lack of substance.",2015-06-09T05:00:05+0000

Then as now, however, Perrys strong suit remains his self-professed status as Texas Job Creator in Chief. As he put it in his speech, During my 14 years as governor, Texas companies created almost one-third of all new American jobs.

Warns That Migrants May Overwhelm Tourist Island of Lesbos," United Nations officials expressed deepening concern on Tuesday about record numbers of desperate refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan arriving on the Greek island of Lesbos, a short boat ride from the Turkish coast. Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency in Geneva, said that roughly 600 refugees a day were arriving in the Greek islands, and that half of them were coming ashore in Lesbos, a picturesque tourist destination ill equipped to handle the flow. The Lesbos arrivals have grown steadily by the month, from 737 in January to more than 7,200 in May. Mr. Edwards said the arrivals, crammed into rubber dinghies and wooden boats, were straining the islands capacity, services and resources. They are part of a broader exodus of people from the Middle East and Africa fleeing war and deprivations in their home countries for risky and sometimes deadly Mediterranean trips to Europe, which has created a crisis for the European Union. The refugee agency said there had been 103,000 refugee and migrant arrivals in Europe via the Mediterranean so far in 2015. ",2015-06-10T01:50:29+0000

The announcement was another step toward the acceptance of gay and lesbian troops, who could have been expelled from the military because of their sexual orientation until the repeal of the dont ask, dont tell policy in 2011. Extending equal opportunity protections to gay and lesbian troops ensures the military treats sexual-orientation-based discrimination the same way it treats discrimination based on race, religion, color, sex, age and national origin, Mr. Carter said.

Billy Bob Thornton is her millionaire beau and Miless rival for her money-hungry affections.

Scott wrote in The New York Times. Focused with sympathetic intensity on the ordeal of a single soul, it illuminates, as though from within, a complex spiritual struggle. But, he added, what faith and doubt have in common is that both are hard work, and the hard-won wisdom of Higher Ground is that human nature does not necessarily distinguish between saints and sinners.",2015-06-11T05:00:06+0000

us,Folkways and Family in America,"Occasionally in the debates about family structure in America, Ive had reason to point out the limits of the popularred family, blue family dichotomy, which portrays a post-sexual revolution America divided between a late-marrying, lower-divorce-rate model of family formation in liberal regions and an earlier-marrying, frequently-divorcing model in more conservative and religious states. This portrayal, particularly associated with the sociologists Naomi Cahn and June Carbone, definitely captures one distinctive reality of American life the fact that stable two-parent homes are more common among secular liberal Bobos in the BosWash corridor and elsewhere than they arein, say, certain regions in the Bible Belt. But its also important to recognize the exceptions to this pattern, from red social models (in the High Plains and Mormon Utah, in particular) that combine high marriage rates and birthrates and relative family stability to blue social models (inner city, Rust Belt, Southwestern) that are as unstable as anything Alabaman and Mississippian.

Metalious, you may remember, was the author of Peyton Place  that decidedly Major League novel of suburban smut  and being seen as a junior version didnt hurt Blumes popularity any. Starting with Wifey in 1978 and continuing right up to In the Unlikely Event (new at No. 4 on the hardcover fiction list), all four of her adult novels have been best sellers. Thats more than you can say for her most celebrated childrens books, including Blubber and Are You There God? Its Me, Margaret, although its not their fault: The Times didnt introduce a childrens best-seller list until 2000. Had one existed in 1976, Blume would surely have been on it. She had some two million books in print that year, according to the Times article, which further observed that Blumes appeal lies in her ability to speak directly to her readers experience. Her characters are usually suburban kids, and not always nice ones. Blume recently told NPRs Weekend Edition that when she was an adolescent herself, she preferred grown-up literature. Starting at 12, really, and onward, I was reading adult books, she said. Everything that I was curious about, about the adult world, I learned from reading those books. Or I got from them, you know, some idea of what it was like to be grown-up. Which is what I was very, very curious about.",2015-06-12T17:08:02+0000
us,"Popcast: Tenement, Punk and the DIY Scene","Predatory Headlights is the new album by Tenement, the punk trio from Appleton, Wis. Its an accomplishment. Its a double album, with 25 songs, and it took more than three years to make. It gives you an enlarged sense of what the primary songwriter, Amos Pitsch, is most trained at: tightly written riff songs with an almost classical pop sense, descended from pop-punk while transcending its clichs. But it also includes experimental compositions and arrangements involving strings and field recordings and an out-of-tune piano. Predatory Headlights is strong and strange and detailed and cohesive; if people are still listening to records from 2015 in 20 years, this might be one of them. Tenement started in 2006 and has spent a lot of its life on the DIY circuit, gigging in living rooms and basements. For quite a while, if you wanted a Tenement record, you had to buy one at a gig. It appears on bills and has recorded split EPs with far more noisy, simple straight-ahead hardcore bands, but it plays music that sounds as if it could have been almost popular at some point in the recent past.

Bourdais proposes to build, near the Galerie dOrlans, a tower 100 mtres high, not of iron and glass, but of stone. His plans show four platforms, accessible by lifts and a staircase, with, at the summit, a lighthouse powerful enough to light the four central arrondissements.

After opening a pop-up farm-to-table restaurant and antiques gallery in the town of Andes in the summer of 2013, Khne and his boyfriend, John Mollett, are launching a new project this week back in New York: an auction house under the name of Hasbeens & Willbees that will bring a bit of the Catskills ethos down to the city.

This reigning paradigm, which dictates that every act of nurturing be judged on the basis of whether it will usher a child toward a life of accomplishment or failure, embodies the fundamental insecurity of global capitalist culture, with its unbending fixation on prosperity and the future. Its no surprise that parenting incites such heated debates, considering how paradoxical these principles can be when theyre applied to children. When each nurturing act is administered with the distant future in mind, what becomes of the present? A child who soaks in the ambient anxiety that surrounds each trivial choice or activity is an anxious child, formed in the hand-wringing, future-focused image of her anxious parents.",2015-06-15T20:29:40+0000

Mirror, their newest bottle, is a nod to Narcissus, who infamously gazed down at his own reflection in the water, Raza says. We also used a rare absolute of narcissus jonquil, which adds an earthy floral note without sweetness. Made in collaboration with the fashion and design website the Line, the scent itself is about a reflection of an image as opposed to the image itself, so the fragrance is a blurred, impressionistic take on a few different themes, says Woods. In this case, notes of green galbanum, smoky gaiac wood, dry violet and clean charcoal come together, Raza says, like a sketch of a forest reflected in a pond.",2015-06-17T04:00:00+0000

The man suddenly began throwing punches, and a legitimate brawl ensued during which the man yelled things like go back where you came from and I was born in this country, you werent. A small crowd gathered to break up the fight. When the police arrived, I stuck around to defend the cabdriver. The police listened but told me they did not need me as an official witness. I wished the cabdriver luck and went across the street to watch the aftermath play out. The passenger, a black man, was claiming that the cabdriver would not take him to Harlem but that he probably would have if he were white. The police did not arrest the man, nor did they appear to do much of anything in the way of even taking information. During the brawl I heard a ring bounce toward me across the street. I picked it up, and after the cabdriver called the police, I asked him if the ring was his. He said it belonged to the other man. I asked somewhat conspiratorially if he wanted the ring anyway, but he said no. When I got home, I found it was a Cartier wedding band that sold new from $1,100 to $1,600. Today I found a posting on Craigslist, seemingly from the passenger, seeking his ring, lost during an assault, in exchange for a reward. So what do I do? J.P., NEW YORK",2015-06-17T11:00:08+0000

us,"Classical Playlist: Sibelius, Dvorak and Zorn","SIBELIUS: Complete Works for Mixed ChoirHeikki Seppanen, conductor; Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir(Ondine)If you mostly know Sibelius from his visionary symphonies, you might be surprised by the works on this two-disc set. The Finnish choral tradition was rich and active when Sibelius came of age as a composer in the late 1880s, and he wrote choral works all his life, from his student days in Helsinki until 1954 when, at 89 and three decades after his final symphony, he did an arrangement of a favorite Christmas song. The pieces on this rewarding recording range from folk songs suffused with Finnish character to enigmatic works with sometimes dark lyrics. There are festival and school songs, patriotic anthems, a cantata for an academic degree ceremony and, inevitably, two versions of Finlandia. Most of the pieces are a cappella. Many unfold in clear, block-chord settings of the texts. If you want to stump friends with a guessing game, play the beguiling, slightly strange Glade of Tuoni from this recording and ask them to identify the composer. Youll win, as you will by picking up this album. (Anthony Tommasini)DVORAK: Symphony No. 9; VARSE: Amriques Ludovic Morlot, conductor; Seattle Symphony(Seattle Symphony Media)It seems at first a bit perverse, pairing Dvoraks warm and friendly New World Symphony with Varses bellicose and blistering vision of new worlds. More fascinating in any case than the theme of the composers physical and psychic encounters with new worlds, whether fleeting or permanent, is the distance musical possibilities themselves had traveled in the mere three decades between the Dvorak (1893) and the Varse (1922), the great watershed having been Stravinskys The Rite of Spring (1913), which Varse mines for all it is worth. The live performances here do equal justice to the coziness and the riotous upheavals. (James R. Oestreich)JOHN ZORN: Hen to PanJay Campbell, cello; Stephen Gosling, piano; Michael Nicolas, cello; Chris Otto, violin; Tyshawn Sorey, drums(Tzadik)The one constant in this feverishly changeable recording of recent chamber works is Mr. Campbell, an amazing musician whos game for both Mr. Zorns technical challenges and his permeating intensity. Much of this album is taken up by three iterations of Ouroboros (2014), a seething, frenetic duet for two cellos that can also be performed with an improvising drummer (here the skittering Tyshawn Sorey). The poise of the gorgeous piano trio The Aristos (2014) and the delicacy of Occams Razor (2013), for cello and piano, are mixed in with uncertainty and collapse. The extremes to which Mr. Zorn flings his performers and listeners are not in themselves new, or newly juxtaposed, but he writes with such sensitivity, assurance and joy that it always somehow seems fresh.

Only three models received the highest rating of Good: the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class and the Volkswagen Passat. Children are safer when in an age-appropriate child restraint, but these are not always easy to install, especially when using a vehicles seatbelts. And if the restraint is not properly anchored to the vehicle, a child could be severely injured in a crash.

Randolph, a black man, had recently won a seat in the State Senate and was then campaigning for the Republican slate. Having served as an Army chaplain with the 26th Regiment United States Colored Troops, Randolph asked the Freedmens Bureau to send him where he can be most useful to his race. He settled in South Carolina in time to take part in the 1865 rededication of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. It was that churchs long history of spiritual autonomy and political activism that caught the attention of the white vigilantes who gunned him down and rode away. Randolphs fate was repeated yesterday with the murder of nine people, including the pastor of the church, the Rev.

And there is something a little dispiriting  if sadly unsurprising  about the way Mr. Chazelle turns a historically African-American art form into the existential arena for a couple of white guys.

Some substitute commercially available ersatz odors (the most common is Sigma Pseudo Corpse Scent, which comes in three kinds: recently dead, decomposed and drowned). But deceased humans produce unique volatile organic compounds, and canines have a keenly attuned sense of smell, so you should practice on the real thing.

(HBO) TRUE DETECTIVE Three law enforcement officers (Colin Farrell, above; Rachel McAdams; and Taylor Kitsch) in a fictional Los Angeles suburb and a career criminal (Vince Vaughn) trying to go legit collide when a city manager is murdered  and a lucrative land scheme disrupted  in Season 2 of this anthology series, created and written by Nic Pizzolatto. This time, Mr. Pizzolatto doubles down on much of what made the first season so distinctive, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. That doesnt make it twice as good, though. Not nearly. In the premiere of Ballers, at 10, Dwayne Johnson plays a former football pro trying to build a career out of giving financial advice to current players in Miami. The characters shenanigans make for unrewarding, predictable drama, though the writers occasionally try for better, Neil Genzlinger wrote. And in The Brink, a dark comedy at 10:30, the fate of the world rests in the hands of the secretary of state (Tim Robbins), a lowly foreign service officer (Jack Black) and a Navy fighter pilot (Pablo Schreiber) after a rogue general (Iqbal Theba) seizes control of Pakistan and its nuclear arsenal. The writers dont go very near Islamic extremism or terrorism, Ms. Stanley wrote. Instead, she said, the creators of Brink take aim at American wrongdoing. So nobody is going to get in trouble because of this show. But people arent going to die laughing, either. ",2015-06-21T16:40:17+0000

In a statement, he said the former justice, Marie Deschamps, would be joined on the panel by Hassan Jallow of Gambia, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda; and Yasmin Sooka, the executive director of the Foundation for Human Rights in South Africa. Mr. Ban created the panel because of questions over whether United Nations rights officials had acted appropriately when they learned of the accusations. The abuse is alleged to have taken place from December 2013 into mid-2014. Although the organization was quick to investigate the allegations, the French authorities did not learn about them until last July, when a United Nations human rights officer leaked the report to them.

Its owner and founder, the baker Rick Easton, acknowledges that the loaves ugly, formless and dark appearance belies their addictive flavor  which he accredits to the 100% stone-milled, high-extraction wheat flour crop he develops with a farmer in Weatherbury Farms in Avella, Pa. At the beginning of the season, Easton experiments with different wheat crops and handling techniques to find the right texture for bread he will serve that year. The result is a pane that feels like whole wheat, but the germ is retained so that the richness and natural oils produce an incredible amount of flavor and sweetness. From a customers perspective, its great to be able to think about wheat in that way, Easton explains. People are used to this supermarket bread that has a two-hour process. My process is 24 hours, and then were talking about crop planning that went in a year ago. So last year, someone was thinking about the grain that you would eat today.

Built in the 1840s, when public health officials across the country were battling cholera, it carried clean water from upstate to a growing urban population. In just a few decades, planners would build not just aqueducts but the so-called sanitary greens that today we call parks, including Highbridge Park, on the Manhattan side of the bridge. A side benefit of High Bridge was the walkway above the aqueduct that allowed Bronx pedestrians to reach Manhattan. By the 1960s, though, the aqueduct was no longer in use, and city planners, working to fight what was then called urban blight, decided to disconnect the boroughs. The Parks Department closed the old bridge, cutting off an artery.",2015-06-23T11:00:06+0000

Somewhere down there, in the terraced subclauses of some forgettable subsection, is a word with a special meaning, a word that offers shelter and concealment to whatever it is that the law actually does. Consider the word relevant. You and I use the word to distinguish what matters (the relevant) from what does not (the irrelevant). But to the National Security Agency, there was no irrelevant. Pointing to one appearance of the word in a 2006 update of the USA Patriot Act, the agency argued it could demand records of any one of our phone calls, on the very slight chance of some distant connection to terrorism. A secret court agreed, ordering phone companies to serve up our records on an ongoing daily basis  24 hours a day, hundreds of billions of calls in all. No one knew about it until Edward Snowden revealed the existence of the program in 2013. Earlier this month, President Obama signed the USA Freedom Act, which is supposed to close this loophole.

You might have called me a serial monogamist, except that I was never exactly monogamous. Relationships overlapped, and those overlaps were always marked by exhausting theatricality: sobbing arguments, shaming confrontations, broken hearts. Still, I kept doing it.

us,Tell It About Your Mother,"In 1900, Sigmund Freud, a Viennese specialist in nervous disorders, began treating the 18-year-old daughter of a rich acquaintance. Freud, who was 44, was just beginning to practice psychoanalysis, a form of therapy that would become known as the talking cure. The girl, whom Freud would later refer to as Dora, had a cluster of inexplicable symptoms: Her mood was low, she was prone to losing consciousness and, for weeks at a time, she could not speak above a whisper. Freud diagnosed hysteria, a term commonly used in fin de sicle Europe to refer to a disorder in which psychological stress was expressed through physical symptoms. Freud traced Doras condition in part to her fathers sexual infidelities that she had felt obliged, from early adolescence, to help orchestrate. When Dora told Freud, in the course of the analysis, that her fathers friend  Herr K., a married man decades her senior  had accosted her in his empty office building, trying to kiss her on her lips, Freud, trained in biology and swept up in his own scientific detachment, couldnt empathize with her distress. One day, after only 11 weeks of treatment and still far from cured, she stood up at the end of a session, wished Freud a happy new year and never returned.",2015-06-24T11:00:08+0000

us,Portrait of a Lady,"A photographer working in a commercial studio in West Africa in the 20th century had a straightforward task: to please his clients. In that sense, the Malian photographer Seydou Keta was  like his father, who worked as a blacksmith, carpenter, mechanic and electrician, among other jobs  a craftsman. He was paid by the public to make pictures. But like his esteemed Malian compatriot Malick Sidib, Mama Casset of Senegal and Joseph Moise Agbodjelou of Benin, he produced such fine work that we now consider him a great African artist. These master photographers gave us panoramas of life in Bamako, Dakar and Porto-Novo, a vivid record of individual people, largely shorn of their names and stories but irrepressibly alive. Here are good clothes gracefully cut, glowing skin, beautifully coifed hair, polished shoes: all the familiar markers of a person taking pride in his or her appearance. Heres someone who looks witty, heres another who looks querulous, another whos modest, or vain, or sweet. There we see a renegade bra strap slipping off a shoulder, there a large laughing man with a baby, a woman in a bathing suit, youths partying at night with their Afros, bell-bottoms, precious LPs and endless reserves of cool.",2015-06-24T11:00:09+0000

She gives lectures and has a self-help book coming out soon. One of her minor themes concerns our deceased father and is particularly nasty. Although there is no way to positively refute statements she has made, neither I nor my two brothers and my mother believe my father capable of the events my sister describes. My father was a kind and giving person. He has living brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews who loved him dearly and would be very upset by my sisters claims. My husband suggests I confront my sister, but that will most likely not yield a fruitful outcome or change anything. My concern is to protect positive memories. I propose to write about him myself, posting my memories on the Internet. I would not attempt to refute my sister, merely focus on my father and memories of him. This seems the least aggressive path and least likely to create any stir around my sister or her supporters. Since the Internet seems destined to live forever, at least an alternative memorial for my father would exist. Your thoughts are appreciated. NAME WITHHELD",2015-06-24T11:00:10+0000

Last year, Carlstrom, who is by trade a marketing executive, launched Austere, a multichannel retail venture focusing mostly on Scandinavian heritage brands, which has been dubbed a magazine you can walk into. Austere exists as both a 5,000-square-foot store in Los Angeles and an active online portal, which on top of shilling wares satisfies customers curiosity with an editorial component that tells the tales of these Nordic brands and the regions cultural values.

Organized by the National Portrait Gallery, London, in collaboration with the Met, the exhibition of more than 90 paintings, watercolors and drawings places Sargent in the trans-Atlantic vanguard of art and culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Subjects include other artists like Claude Monet and Auguste Rodin and writers like Robert Louis Stevenson and Henry James. The collector Isabella Stewart Gardner appears in a portrait that rarely leaves the Gardner Museum in Boston. The Shakespearean actress Ellen Terry is pictured performing and in a formal portrait. These and other works, which reveal Sargent in unguarded moments responding to people he loved and admired, should be a crowd-pleaser.

But his life takes a nose-dive when an inquiry reveals his lust for drinking and drugs, and suggests that he may not have been sober during his heroic feat. Hes high as a kite, and you may be too, lifted by the contact high that great filmmaking gives you, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Its no surprise that Flight has salvation in mind. The shock is how deep Mr. Zemeckis and Mr. Washington journey into the abyss and how long they stay there. It can be tough for stars to play such unrepentantly compromised characters, as Mr. Washington does brilliantly here.

Ansari wrote Modern Romance with the N.Y.U. sociologist Eric Klinenberg, framing it as a comprehensive study of dating in the digital age. Sociology, in a strange way, is similar to comedy, he said on NPR recently. Its a lot about observation and making observations that resonate with people and trying to learn about why people do the things they do. And one idea that really applied to modern romance, in my opinion, was this whole notion of the paradox of choice. ... Right now we have the most romantic options that any generation has ever had. And you would think, oh, more options, thats better. But whenever you look at any studies theyve done, they always find the more options people have, the harder it is for them to make a choice, and that when they do make a choice theyre less satisfied because theyre scared that they maybe chose the wrong thing. And whenever we talked to people about this in regards to dating, it totally resonated.",2015-06-25T16:32:45+0000

To get to the heart of the problem, it was necessary to question the notion of greatness or genius itself. Nochlin was then 40 years old. Two years before, she had experienced a feminist awakening when an acquaintance gave her a briefcase of radical feminist zines. A twice-married mother of two, teaching art history at Vassar College and leading what she had considered until then a fashionable and liberated life, she read until 2a.m., light bulbs going off in her head.
