If I were going to choose something to do, it would not be to stand up in front of a lot of people, the singer Linda Ronstadt says in this documentary. But I love to sing, I love to sing, I love music. So at some point, you do whatever you have to do to do music. Thats not exactly a stereotypical rock-star outlook, but Ronstadt didnt have the typical rock stars career: After reaching arena-level success in rock in the 1970s, she moved across genres, releasing albums of pop standards and Mariachi songs. (People would think that I was trying to reinvent myself, she says in the documentary, but I never invented myself to start with.) Her varied career is the focus here; its discussed by both Ronstadt and by interviewees like Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Cameron Crowe, Jackson Browne and Dolly Parton. The political intelligence and matter-of-fact feminism that emerge in this portrait are among its most intriguing aspects, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. He wrote that Ronstadts cleareyed, down-to-earth thoughts on her profession, her family and American culture (musical and otherwise) make her someone you want to know better.",2020-01-01T06:00:06+0000

A tragedy happens on ice  and an apparent miracle happens off it  in this faith-based drama from the TV veteran Roxann Dawson. The screenplay is based on an actual 2015 incident in which John Smith, a Missouri teenager, fell through the frozen surface of a lake and remained submerged long enough for his heart to stop. It started pumping blood again after he was brought to a hospital  but reportedly only when his mother audibly prayed for him. That event and the communitys subsequent push to aid in Johns recovery are at the center of this movie, which follows John (Marcel Ruiz), his mother (Chrissy Metz) and father (Josh Lucas) and a young pastor (Topher Grace). The film tells the story of Johns miraculous ordeal with an unassuming simplicity, focusing on the harrowing details of the case without an overreliance on proselytization, Bilge Ebiri wrote in his review for The New York Times. Though faith is ever-present, he added, the film also wisely dedicates plenty of screen time to the emergency workers and doctors struggling to bring the boy back to life. Here, religion is not in contention with medicine, but seems to work in tandem with it.",2020-01-02T06:00:06+0000

Theres this moment of quiet as the attachment opens, and then you hear screams and claps and hell yesses echoing over the floor. The Power of Habit had two publicists, a production editor, several marketers and designers, a serial rights person and a sales force that had been working for months to make it a success. Its rare that a book hitting the list is a total surprise, but there are nail-biters and books that hit higher than we expected and thats a beautiful thing  but not as beautiful as making that call to an author who has worked so hard to make her book a reality and telling her that she is an official NYT best seller.

But history, culture and nature abound in this cosmopolitan Caribbean city, where Christopher Columbus landed in 1492. The oldest church and first paved road in the Americas are both in Santo Domingos Zona Colonial, but so are plenty of new businesses that reflect an evolving artistic and activist presence. These days you can find: Mamey, an L.G.B.T.Q.-friendly cultural space featuring a bookstore, gallery and theater; Microteatro, which delivers 15-minute plays about Dominican life; and Miss Rizos Saln, a hair parlor that often hosts events to fight the stigma against kinky or curly hair. There are also pockets of nature amid the bustle. In Santo Domingo Este, a short drive from the city center, is an underground lake where Tano women once bathed. And in Santo Domingo and elsewhere, an influx of immigrants, including Haitian, Chinese and Venezuelan, have left their mark in recent decades  most noticeable, perhaps, on the culinary scene, bringing everything from arepas to dumplings.

Ari Aster made waves in 2018 with the release of his debut feature, Hereditary. A year later, he delivered another haunting watch, Midsommar. The protagonists, Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor), are on the verge of breaking up until a family tragedy brings them closer. Not close enough, that is, as Christian is emotionally detached while a grieving Dani clings onto him for comfort. Months later, Christian reluctantly invites Dani to join him and his friends at a festival in a remote Swedish village that occurs every 90 years. The group arrives at the sun-kissed landscape in awe, until they realize they have entered the terrain of a pagan cult. Needless to say, terror ensues. Aster tried to center the horror around Dani and Christians deteriorating relationship, yet critics have said their back story was not given enough weight to begin with. Asters real strength, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, is the setup, that part when he lays out his characters, their worlds and the menace that closes on them like a claw.

However, purchasing something used seems more environmentally friendly and frugal, and there are several pawnshops in my neighborhood. On the one hand, it seems exploitative to participate in this industry. I dont want my good price to come at the expense of someone who needs a quick infusion of cash. On the other hand, it would be presumptuous to assume that whoever sold the item in the first place isnt acting in their own best interest. You could argue that I am indirectly providing an opportunity for someone to sell something if they could use the cash. Of course, if the owner were disreputable and the TV had been stolen, this would be unethical. But I dont know the reputations of the specific pawnshops in my neighborhood and wouldnt want to make unwarranted assumptions. Adam Schneider",2020-01-07T10:00:05+0000

They Just Become Holograms.,"In preparation for his first American tour in a decade, Ronnie James Dio spent months sequestered in a modest office suite in Marina del Rey, in Los Angeles.

I visited at the end of May, only a couple of days before the opening date of the tour, and among Dios team, there was a tangible air of anticipation. Dio never became a household name, but he is considered one of the great heavy-metal vocalists of all time, up there with Ozzy Osbourne (whom he replaced in Black Sabbath) and metal-adjacent rockers like Axl Rose and Robert Plant. Beginning in the 1970s, Dio took a lead role in codifying a number of his genres most ludicrous, yet utterly foundational, conventions. He sang of wolves and demons, toured with an animatronic dragon and supposedly introduced the splay-fingered devil horns headbangers salute, which he claimed his Italian grandmother used to flash as an old-world method of warding off the malocchio and other forms of bad luck.",2020-01-07T10:00:22+0000

During his monthlong stay, Hugo searched for a response to this prompt, and inspiration came when he chanced upon a platter of desiccated fruits in Oaxaca. Making Pigments. San Agustin Etla (2018), which shows a spread of dying crops in bold hues, was the first image Hugo captured in Mexico. But something shifted during that first visit, Hugo says. I dont know why, but Im not done here, he remembers thinking; he has since visited Mexico four more times, traveling between the bustling border city of Tijuana in the north, the colonial town of San Cristbal de las Casas in the Central Highlands and the indigenous Zapotec town of Juchitn in the southern state of Oaxaca. From the Day of the Dead to narco-politics, death is strongly felt there, he says of the country, but it was its peoples day-to-day understanding of lifes fragility that inspired his new photography series, La Cucaracha, which will go on display at Yossi Milo Gallery in New York this month.

Among them is Pedro Almodvars Pain and Glory, which was nominated for best international feature film. Antonio Banderas was also nominated for best actor in a leading role, his first Oscar nomination in his nearly 40-year career. Banderas also won the best actor prize at last years Cannes Film Festival for this role, as a depressed Spanish filmmaker who bears a curious resemblance to Almodvar in career and appearance. These teasing biographical gestures blur the line between reality and representation, but to see this movie as confessional would miss the point, Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review, in which she designated the film a Critics Pick.

The world observed and the interior life are slowed down, the rhythms in the prose given a strange and powerful nervous energy, every nuance and angle offered their due. Narrated by a poet in a foreign country, the novel and its inflections suggest that feeling itself is almost foreign and hard to pin down; that it has to be outlined with many subclauses, digressions and asides. Language becomes a way of holding experience close before it dissolves in your hand. Some of the scenes in the book, such as when the narrator watches a boy on a train, have the aura of beautifully rich film, something captured with meticulous attention to every shift of light and atmosphere. These scenes are created with a great moody melancholy, the narrator fully aware how soon they will be over and how they must be secured before they crumble.",2020-01-17T10:00:06+0000

By my American standards G. was late, and as I waited for him I browsed the book stalls the square is famous for, their wares piled high under awnings in front of the city library. Really it wasnt a fountain anymore, it had been shuttered for years, since faulty wiring stopped a mans heart one summer as he dipped his fingers into the cool water there. It was December now, though winter hadnt yet really taken hold; the sun was out and the weather was mild, it wasnt unpleasant to stand for a bit and browse the books on display. From the beginning of the year G. had caught my attention, at first simply because he was beautiful, and then for the special quality of friendship I thought I saw between him and another boy in my class, the intensity with which G. sought him out and the privacy he drew about them. It was familiar to me, that intensity, a story from my own adolescence, as was the basking ambivalence with which the other boy received it, how he both invited it and held it off. I had some idea, then, what we would talk about, and why school didnt offer enough secrecy for us to talk about it there, but I was still curious: he wasnt a student I was particularly close to, he didnt stop by my room outside of class, he had never confided in me or sought me out, and I wondered what crisis was bringing him to me now.",2020-01-17T10:01:00+0000

(Even Keans 8-year-old daughter, Sofia, sometimes consults on runway soundtracks.) The house is also known for trademarks that include a lust for travel and an eye for jewel tones and florid patterns  especially paisley. But for Etros fall 2020 mens wear show in Milan last weekend, Kean paid particular attention to ancestry, weaving together influences from his Italian heritage and from Argentina, where his wife, Constanza Cavalli Etro, grew up. This synthesis showed up throughout the collection: One model strode down the runway in a jacket that was half leather motorcycle and half wool blanket worn over an ocher turtleneck, while the closing look featured a fringed cape adorned with delicate silver embroidery.

The new show finds Picard  the erstwhile commander of the famous fictional starship known as the Enterprise  in reflective form, grappling with the past as an aged version of himself. It has a starry showrunner in the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon, who will presumably bring a new kind of energy to the franchise. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Stewart said he was drawn to the new story because it explored the profound psychological differences in the character, who felt abandoned, distrusted and unnecessary.

The threat is veiled (in the literal sense) in The Curse of La Llorona, a horror movie about a killer spirit who takes the form of a weeping woman in a wedding dress. The movie casts Linda Cardellini as Anna, a widow with two children, a job in social services and a problem audiences can probably extrapolate from the films title: Shes cursed. Or, rather, she picks up a curse that comes in the form of La Llorona (Marisol Ramirez), a weeping woman who starts terrorizing the family. (The character is based on a figure from Mexican folklore.) More efficient than ambitious, La Llorona is basically a maternal showdown with shock cuts and billowing curtains, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. The director Michael Chaves, making the most of his silkily mobile, at times predatory camera (he likes to shift the point of view mid-prowl) delivers the horror classics nicely.
