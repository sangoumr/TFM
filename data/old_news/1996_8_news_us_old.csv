us,CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AT XYLAN RESIGNS,"The Xylan Corporation's chief financial officer, C. Stephen Cordial, resigned yesterday after 10 months on the job amid reports of conflicts with the chairman, Steve Y. Kim. The resignation capped a day of rampant speculation about Mr. Cordial's future. Xylan shares fell $5, to $37.50 in trading of 1.3 million shares, more than double its three-month daily average. The company, which makes switching systems for computer networks, said only that Mr. Cordial was leaving to ''pursue other interests'' and emphasized there was no problem with its finances. Xylan shares have fallen by almost half since setting a 52-week high of $74.3125 on May 20. The decline accelerated in the last week, after the company, which is based in Calabasas, Calif., and makes switching systems for computer networks, failed to exceed analyst estimates in its second-quarter earnings.",1996-08-01T05:00:00+0000

What can make reunions by obscure European groups like Cluster more exciting than classic-rock reunions is that the former often haven't performed in the United States before. This was true of the influential German progressive-rock group Faust when it reunited two years ago and toured the United States for the first time, though its performance-art-oriented shows were disappointing. One hopes Sunday's show by Cluster, a more academic German progressive rock group from the 1970's, will be as good as its albums. Consisting of the composers Hans-Joachim Roedilius and Dieter Moebius, Cluster may be best known for its instrumental collaborations with Brian Eno, but its own late-70's music offers just as strong a mix of atmospheric electronics, classical inspiration and forward propulsion. The performance is on Sunday night at 9:30; admission is $10 in advance, $12 on the day of the show.",1996-08-02T05:00:00+0000

The 16 sketches included in HOW TO GET HOME (John F. Blair, $18.95) are brief portraits of hapless individuals caught in the simple crisis of being alive, trying and usually failing to connect with the people around them. ''After Leston,'' the novella that opens the collection, is a model of compression, spare writing and poignancy, narrated by the title character from Mr. Lott's earlier novel, ''Jewel.'' Set in a working-class suburb of Los Angeles in the mid-1960's, just before the Watts riots, it tells the story of a white family that's uprooted itself from rural Mississippi in pursuit of an education for Brenda Kay, Jewel's retarded daughter. It's a simple story, told by a plain-spoken woman, yet it speaks volumes about love and loss, about the competition between our own ideas about the world and those of the people nearest to us -- about where a family ends and an individual begins.

Mr. Vesco has lived since the early 1980's in Cuba, where, American officials say, he has helped Fidel Castro's Government circumvent the American economic embargo and has aided the Medellin drug cartel in obtaining an air route over the island.",1996-08-04T05:00:00+0000

One day I suppose my mother was just sick and depressed and hungry and tired. She wouldn't get up. . . . But when they said 'Last call,' I left my mother, knowing that when I came back she would not be there. And she wasn't.'' Sixty-eight-year-old Rosa Strygler, the sole survivor of a Hasidic family from Cracow, is one of 50 survivors of the Nazi concentration camps who tell their harrowing stories in ''WHEN THEY CAME TO TAKE MY FATHER'': Voices of the Holocaust (Arcade, $35). The eloquence of this testimony is not well served by the book's design: Mark Seliger's photographs are too often blurry, in unflattering close-up and cropped at odd angles; the inconsistently oversized typography distracts from the simple eloquence of the text, which was edited by Leora Kahn, a photography editor, and Rachel Hager, a senior editor at Parents magazine. ''The Holocaust is always with me,'' says 70-year-old John Klein, whose entire family died in the camps. ''I still have dreams. When I went back two years ago, standing in the place where they came to kill us, I showed my daughter and grandson, 'This is where my ashes are supposed to have been.' '' Benjamin Meed tells how he and his wife, Vladka, rebuilt their life in the United States: ''We have two children. . . . I have five grandchildren.

An early American example was the 1937 play shoes of a California manufacturer, Joyce Casual. The company used soles of wood, cork, raffia and rope for its espadrille styles. Gertrude Lawrence, the English actress, created a sensation on the streets of London with her bare legs and painted toenails, to go with the informality of her open wedge shoes. She presciently prepared women to accept an era when nylon went into parachutes instead of stockings.

us,"Conceptualism, Russian Style","When Ilya Kabakov was a young student at the Moscow Art School during World War II, Government restrictions meant that the only way his mother could obtain permission to stay in the city with her son was for her to work at the school. She became a janitor. Chronically poor, she surreptitiously took up residence for a time in the school's linen closet, a former lavatory. Mr. Kabakov repaid his mother for her sacrifices; he joined the artists' union and became a successful children's book illustrator. In the 1970's, the illustrator turned into a dissident artist, the leader of a group of young painters including Erik Bulatov, Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid, commonly known as the Moscow Conceptualists. He used his innocuous colored-pencil technique to narrate absurdist tales like that of ''Decorator Maligin,'' a bureaucrat who ruins documents with obsessive doodling. In ILYA KABAKOV: The Man Who Never Threw Anything Away (Abrams, $65), the art critic Amei Wallach describes the key developments in Mr. Kabakov's art, from his goofily naive works of the 70's to his preoccupation in the 80's with ''total installations,'' works involving text, sound, drawing, garbage, kitchen equipment and photographs. In 1991, Mr. Kabakov was included in a show at the Museum of Modern Art, organized by Robert Storr, the museum's curator of contemporary painting and sculpture (who contributes an excellent introduction exploring the artist's philosophical bearings). The next year, Mr. Kabakov represented Russia at an international art exhibition in Kassel, Germany, with his installation ''Toilet,'' which recast his memories of his mother's struggles. Inside ''Toilet'' was a crudely built latrine that was designed as a shelter; in it the artist placed simple furniture, dishes, washing, arranged as if the occupants had just stepped out -- or had been evicted, as his mother had been. Here, as always, Mr. Kabakov's art -- by turns comic, chilling and purposefully stressful -- offers no answers, only poignant intuitions about the vulnerability of human life.

us,A Man Out of Time,"Fernando del Paso's PALINURO OF MEXICO (Dalkey Archive, paper, $14.95) reads like a hypertext novel -- filled with digressions, asides, flashbacks and embellishments within which the plot can be disassembled and reconstructed almost at whim. The result is both lively and somewhat intimidating. In an interview, Mr. del Paso called the novel's hero ''not just one character but several, as well as all the characters at once.'' Further, according to the novel itself, Palinuro is someone who ''lived simultaneously in several periods,'' while the narrator both is and is not the protagonist (''Often I adopted his name and lent him mine''). Why has Mr. del Paso traveled to such extremes of obfuscation? He is constructing a universe here and, as God discovered when He tried the same thing, such a project begins with chaos. But instead of quarks and neutrinos, the author's building blocks are human body parts. Palinuro and many of his friends are medical students, while his lover (and cousin), Estefania, is a nurse; much of their time is spent attending dissections or reconstructing skeletons from a random collection of old bones. Meanwhile, Palinuro and Estefania embark on a life of discursions and explorations. Mr. del Paso's new world spreads out in all directions from the lives of Palinuro and Estefania until at last the novel is situated in time (the Mexican student uprisings of 1968, expressed in dramatic form as a rare example of surreal social realism). By then, though, time itself has become meaningless and each life has become all lives. With sly references to (among others) Proust, Swift, Virgil, Sterne, Faulkner and Dante, Mr. del Paso, aided by the inventive translation of Elisabeth Plaister, has written a memorable book. ''Reality,'' he notes near the end, ''will never be the same.'' Nor will readers who persevere. James Polk",1996-08-11T05:00:00+0000

My selection process was far less sophisticated than that of the tern, a seabird that often nests on rocky outcrops off the Atlantic coast, and then migrates to Africa, Antarctica and South America, before coming home to the precise island of its birth. I migrated to Hog Island because I was looking for an economical Down East vacation, and found it in an Audubon Society Ecology Workshop in Maine, lasting six nights and five days, with 35 hours of field trips and classes on the area's physical and biological environment, evening programs devoted to conservation themes, rustic accommodations and meals included, for $700.",1996-08-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Fascinating Rhythms,"Inspired by the rhythms of jazz, Stuart Davis painted witty, ebullient works for 50 years until his death in 1964. In STUART DAVIS (National Museum of American Art/Abrams, $45), Patricia Hills, a professor of art history at Boston University, takes the reader on a straightforward tour of the artist's career. Born in 1892 to two Philadelphia artists, Davis spent most of his life in New York City. Besides making art and trying to sell it, for 30 years he also organized artists in support of causes ranging from socialism to a new urban American esthetic. Ms. Hills's well-researched book gives ample space to Davis's theoretical writings and political work, with an emphasis on the historical context. But she skimps a bit on the last 20 years of his life, when his style simplified and jelled. After being influenced by artists as different as Picasso, Lger, Mir and van Gogh, Davis discovered his ''swing,'' as in the Duke Ellington lyric he once incorporated into a painting: ''It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing.'' His mature works employed boldly painted words and symbols taken from advertisements and everyday life, set amid chunky, collagelike blocks of bright colors. Davis prided himself on the loose and improvisational nature of his art. But if his work swings, Ms. Hills's book - well done though it is - tends to drag. Ted Loos",1996-08-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"More Sense, More Sensibility","Writing sequels to Jane Austen's novels is obviously a formidable task. Most crucial is the ability to mimic Austen's language and tone without resorting to parody, while still managing to echo her subtle wit and subversive feminism. And then there is the challenge of finding enough loose ends for another story within the neat bundles of marital bliss in which Austen ties up her plots. In THE THIRD SISTER: A Continuation of Jane Austen's ''Sense and Sensibility'' (Donald I. Fine, $22.95), Julia Barrett manages the first challenge with easy and elegant phrasing. While her wit is not cloaked in Austen's constant good manners, Ms. Barrett (who is also the author of ''Presumption,'' a sequel to ''Pride and Prejudice'') excels at re-creating the polite scorn with which Austen women treat Austen men. As for the second hurdle, Ms. Barrett simply steps around it by concentrating on Margaret Dashwood, Elinor and Marianne's largely ignored sibling. This is a wise decision, for dedicated Janeites would be sorely disappointed if Elinor were unfulfilled by life as a parson's wife or Marianne deserted loyal Colonel Brandon for a more dramatic romance. Ms. Barrett contemplates no such blasphemy. Instead, Elinor and Marianne remain where they belong - in wedded bliss, in bit parts. The spotlight belongs to Margaret, an adventurous beauty wise beyond her years, stifled by the tedium of Barton Park's confined society. Fans of the original novel will enjoy juicy cameo appearances by such favorites as Mrs. Ferrars and the former Lucy Steele. They'll also enjoy a good new story, tight writing and a heroine with brains and charm. Rebecca Boggs Roberts",1996-08-18T05:00:00+0000

The image created a fashion revolution that swept the country and mirrored the American woman's liberation from centuries of fashion bondage. At midcentury, when Dior's corseted 1947 New Look tried to return women to a pedestal, many young women ignored the dictate and invaded Brooks Brothers to buy inexpensive, well-made cotton shirts.

In the depictions of white guilt, black rage and the life styles of rich New Yorkers, there isn't much any visitor to our planet would fail to recognize.

Across the street, John Willsher was telephoning the husband of a stranded motorist when he heard the screams. He ran to his truck to fetch strong rope, and although he crawled carefully across the ice, it gave way, plunging him into the frigid water. He grabbed one of the two boys, 7-year-old Brian Bates. Another boy, Kerone Smith, 9, wrapped the rope around himself and was dragged to the bank. The exertion plus the bitter cold was too much for Mr. Willsher. Just four days shy of his 58th birthday he had a heart attack and, despite efforts of paramedics, Mr. Willsher died on the river bank.",1996-08-18T05:00:00+0000

The young woman in residence -- a television producer by day, an electric-bass player by night (she recently opened for Courtney Love) -- has decorated this 1848 brownstone to look (in her words) like ''a Viennese salon on STP.'' Her design guru is Christopher Alexander, the Berkeley architectural theorist who emphasizes process over plan, color as order and feelings as an objective standard. He is the prophet of ''user design,'' believing that people who use the space should design it.",1996-08-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Balkanization,"David Albahari writes in the rich Balkan tradition of urbanity and multiculturism that stands in opposition to the region's strident, often mournful nation-building literatures. Set in his native Serbia, the short stories in WORDS ARE SOMETHING ELSE (Northwestern University, cloth, $49.95; paper, $15.95) are less about the particularities of place than about the universal riddles of language, especially the failure of words to bridge the spaces between people. Opening one tale, he warns the reader: ''What I'll describe is unknown to you; you will never learn what it is I meant to say.'' This is a daunting threat, but an exaggerated one. Sensitively translated by Ellen Elias-Bursac, most of Mr. Albahari's stories are quite accessible, as well as playful and good-natured, recalling the metafictions of Robert Coover and Mr. Albahari's countryman Danilo Kis. In the early stories of this retrospective collection, Mr. Albahari writes about a stiflingly close Jewish household in the Belgrade suburb of Zemun; as the members of the family struggle to love one another, their conflicts are sometimes comic and often absurd. In his later stories, Mr. Albahari peers into the chasms that gape between a husband and wife -- and, even more dizzyingly, between a writer and his reader. Ken Kalfus",1996-08-25T05:00:00+0000

us,That's Entertainment?,"As a peep show, RED LIGHT: Inside the Sex Industry (Powerhouse Books, 635 East Ninth Street, New York, N.Y. 10009, $39.95) is eminently satisfying, a lurid glimpse into the lives of the strippers, adult-film stars, phone-sex operators, dominatrixes and prostitutes who make up the sex industry. (Think there's nothing in the realm of sexual preference that can shock anymore? Meet Marion, the vampire dominatrix who draws blood from her clients.) The photographs by Sylvia Plachy, the staff photographer at The Village Voice, depict the brutal banality of the most transgressive behavior; a series about a middle-aged man who pays a woman to wrap him in plastic and then mummify him in concrete -- all within the confines of a crummy East Village walk-up -- is particularly disturbing. When James Ridgeway, the Washington correspondent for The Voice, details a prostitute's relationship with her boyfriend or a go-go girl's worries about her cellulite, they are revealed as the vulnerable, sometimes sad, sometimes funny people they are. But when he crawls under the covers with that strangest of bedfellows, politics, he gets into trouble. Painfully politically correct, he argues that the sex industry is valuable to our society because it serves as a ''safety valve for a repressed and confused patriarchal culture'' that ''preserves, rather than threatens, the mainstream social order.'' Fair enough. But then his argument gets muddled. Is the sex industry the ultimate expression of a woman's control over her body, or is it yet another institution that affords men the opportunity to victimize them? He's never quite sure, but he seems determined to demonstrate it's one or the other. And occasionally Mr. Ridgeway goes completely off the deep end. At one point he argues that the reason single motherhood is so threatening to ''the family values crowd'' is that it ''represents a woman's right not only to have sex, but also to raise children, outside of the sanctified realm of the male-dominated family.'' Somehow, one suspects that children without fathers are not reveling in their freedom from patriarchy quite as much as Mr. Ridgeway would like to believe. Judith Newman",1996-08-25T05:00:00+0000
