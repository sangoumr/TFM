The guest rooms at the hotel, Nine Orchard, will be available for booking on June 20, but two of its three dining spaces  Corner Bar, a bistro, and Lobby Lounge  are already serving food and drinks. Mattos Hospitality, the chef Ignacio Mattoss company, will run these, along with the Amado Grill, an intimate, 44-seat fine-dining restaurant to open in September adjacent to Corner Bar.

Corner Bar will emphasize tavern food, with raw-bar specialties, chicken liver mousse, steak au poivre, cod with leeks, roasted chicken with morels, boudin blanc, and spaghetti with tomato sauce; it will be open for breakfast and dinner, with lunch to follow soon. The wine list will be American because, as Mr. Mattos put it, visitors should be able to appreciate whats being made here. The Lobby Lounge, installed in a former bank teller room with arched windows and a vaulted ceiling, will offer cocktails with small plates like oysters, cheeses and shrimp cocktail, and will also add tea service.

Most of the Time.,"If only someone would have the courage to be unfashionable, Barbara Pym, the English novelist whose books form a perfect little canon of the parochial quotidian, complained to her friend Philip Larkin. Pym did.

us,"Chambers, the Evolution of Racines NY, Opens in TriBeCa","Racines NY, a wine bar and restaurant loosely associated with Racines in Paris, opened sporadically during the pandemic, but closed permanently last summer. It severed its ties with the Paris location, began renovations and has reinvented itself as Chambers. David Lillie, an owner of Chambers Street Wines, remains a partner, along with the beverage director, Pascaline Lepeltier, an award-winning French sommelier; the general manager, Jared David, who had that role at Racines NY; and Jonathan Karis, a former chef de cuisine at Gramercy Tavern and the new executive chef. He describes his food as home cooking, though partly boning a chicken and serving it richly marinated and sizzled on a plancha might not be a home cooks idea of weeknight dinner. Nonetheless, his food is homier than Raciness. Black bass with braised artichokes and saffron seasoning, grilled sweetbreads with sauerkraut, Little Gem lettuce with a creamy feta dressing and, for dessert, a phyllo mille-feuille with honey-lemon mascarpone are some other dishes hes planning. Though the restaurant maintains its substantial cellar, the working wine list is brief, rotates seasonally and has an eye on the environment, with an interest in who made the wine and how. Ms. Lepeltier plans to feature hybrid grapes and have wines from Red Hook Winery and others on tap. I dont want to serve wines for the 1 percent, she said. The renovations have resulted in a somewhat more gracious and coherent space framed by curved pale wood panels, brick walls, a long marble bar, a roomier dining counter at the open kitchen and a communal table in front. There are fewer seats, 55 down from 69, reflecting reduced staffing. (Opens Wednesday)",2022-06-14T16:19:29+0000

Before white anthropologists recast them as aesthetic treasures and displayed them in museums and private collections, beaded bison-hide sacks were meant for carrying things, and Pueblo pots for storing or cooking food. My own Tlingit ancestors used decorative cedar chests, like one in the permanent collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to store regalia used in religious ceremonies. Luger, who is 43, spent years of his artistic life grappling with the fetishizing of Native objects. Then something similar happened to his own work.",2022-06-16T09:00:28+0000

Though it retains the general contours of its predecessor, its more plush and richly upholstered, in deep browns with bright accents. In the evenings, there is live music, including singing from a new balcony stage over the bar, now relocated to a more central position. It has a combination of luxury elements; its built for celebratory moments, said Jeff Katz, who owns Al Coro with the chef, Melissa Rodriguez.  (She is also the chef and a partner at Mels.) Mr. Katz and James Kent, his business partner, recently divided their holdings amicably: Mr. Katz now runs Al Coro and Mels, the pizzeria next door, and Mr. Kent is in charge of the Lower Manhattan properties Crown Shy, Saga and Overstory. Mr. Kent said the split made sense from a geographical standpoint. Ms. Rodriguez, who started at Del Posto over 10 years ago and became the executive chef in 2017, described the food as regional Italian. But her tasting dinners ($195 for five courses, $245 for seven), which are detailed by the servers, not printed, involve Italy sporadically. Gremolata and lardo adorn green and white asparagus; frico tops vegetable giardiniera; and a pasta course features culurgiones, a type of dumpling filled with potato, Fontina and mascarpone, with a caviar butter sauce and razor clams. A main course might be a whole roasted sea bass with Marsala and mushrooms, chicken breast done in the style of Peking duck or both on the seven-course menu. Many courses include a collection of savory condiments. The plan is for the menus to be sent to diners the day after their visit, and Ms. Rodriguez plans to change the lineup monthly. There will be a cocktail bar on the spacious lower level. (Opens Wednesday)",2022-06-21T16:43:13+0000

Just because you like a song does not mean you should sing it. Many classic songs should probably be avoided unless youre a trained vocalist with an expansive range  including all of Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Journey and Queen, particularly Bohemian Rhapsody. If you want to sound good, he also suggests caution when attempting rap thats really too fast for you. Hamilton, a general manager at a print shop in Seattle, goes out to karaoke nearly every night of the week. He spends at least four hours a day singing to himself in the car, in the shower, at his desk and anywhere else he can. Use a karaoke app on your phone to practice. Hamilton keeps a list of go-to songs on his phone divided into different categories, including up-tempo, ballads and duets. His favorite is Alexandra Burkes version of Leonard Cohens Hallelujah. For karaoke, you dont need to have all the lyrics memorized, but it helps to have practiced a song until you can sing it confidently. Given the choice, Hamilton avoids private karaoke rooms, opting instead for the bar-style public ones where your audience includes strangers. If youre shy or planning to sing something new, alcohol can sometimes ease nerves. Dont overdo it, and choose a room-temperature drink. Cold beverages arent good for your throat, Hamilton says. You dont have to be a great vocalist, but your skill level should be a consideration when choosing what to sing. An upbeat party song that prompts a singalong can be a good option for so-so singers who might struggle to carry a song alone.",2022-06-28T09:00:07+0000

The dauntless Funmi, diffident Zainab and humble Enitan meet at college in Zaria, Nigeria, in the 1980s, forming (we are boldly told rather than shown) a solid unit, in which Enitan must play second fiddle to the beauties who are her two best friends. Now, 30 years later, their friendship rumpled but still fundamentally intact, the three  all mothers, all in variegatedly troublesome marriages  converge for the wedding of Funmis daughter in Lagos. This is the Destiny of the title, an aloof and reluctant bride (Happiness is for Americans, thats what Daddy always says) who lends the plot the modest drama of will-she-or-wont-she as her big day approaches, all while Funmi steams ahead with ostentatious celebrations.",2022-06-28T09:00:07+0000
