us,Burt Reynolds Recalls Era of the Private Eye in 'Shamus':The Cast,"""What are you doing in the tub?""""I'm taking a bath.""""Taking a bath with your clothes on?""""Saves on laundry bills.""It's a joke; a rotten joke to be sure; but a joke anyway. The shamus, McCoy, isn't really taking a bath. He was worked over by some hired thugs the night before, and in the tub is where his pal Springy finds him the next morning  ready for jokes, ready for punches, for kisses, for just about anything, in Buzz Kulik's ""Shamus,"" a game but not especially good movie that means to put the private eye back into some kind of current relevance.The attempt has been made often enough before. But this time it is made with a mixture of contemporary satire and knowing nostalgia that keeps proving itself more interesting than the movie it is supposed to support. Just possibly, the private eye, that last refuge of unfettered consciousness, is a less immortal pop-culture hero than some would like to imagine. When ""Shamus"" goes back to ""The Big Sleep,"" and it goes back quite openly, it can parody certain personagesthe beautiful bookstore girl behind glasses; General Sternwood in his hothousebut it can't really capture people, or what they stand for in a society that is, like any society, a system of deep and necessary inter- dependencies.Thus, Marlowe, in ""The Big Sleep,"" could be not just the eyes but also the conscience of his world, as McCoy cannot, because in ""Shamus"" there is nothing to which a conscience can attach itself. People aren't more wicked. They are more brutal, but if anything less wicked. The case that McCoy breaks, the plot of the icy millionaire, Hume (Ron Weyand), to export government arms illegally, may be fraught with danger; but is is given its meaning by the dopey Col. C. C. Hardcore (John Ryan), who sells off surplus tanks as if they were used cars, and so it becomes another one of the film's game but rather lame little jokes.As the tough and artful shamus, Burt Reynolds has both a dramatic role to play and a public image to live up to; and I think he does better with the former than the latter. I'm not sure how you would play an insatiable lover in a PG-rated movie that has you rolling out of your bed of passion each morning still wearing your boxer shorts, but Reynolds plays it for bemused embarrassmentwhich is not bad, considering the options.In some respects, appreciative, oddly courteous, Reynold's relations with his womenespecially with the innocent Alexis (reasonably managed by Dyan Cannon)are the closest ""Shamus"" comes to approximating the circle of moral good fellowship that films like ""The Big Sleep"" erect against the corrosive mists of the studio-created night.The approximation isn't close enough, and ""Shamus,"" which is full of appealing New York locations and much inventive action, ultimately amounts to little more than the kind of situation melodrama that the movies these days offer for excitement. On this level it is workmanlike, well-paced, modest, sometimes scary, and sometimes genuinely funny. It opened yesterday at Loews State 2 and Loews Cine and other neighborhood theaters.",1973-02-01T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Steelyard Blues' Arrives,"""Steelyard Blues"" is an appealing movie if only because all of the people connected with it seem so utterly convinced that they are making a Third World film disguised in the shape of an eccentric caper comedy. I like its earnestness, its brow furrowed with mission.It reminds me of the little boy who covered himself with vanishing cream and then walked through a dinner party in the fond belief he was invisible. He was not, nor is the essential, simple-hearted evangelism of ""Steelyard Blues,"" which does have, as a matter of fact, some bright things in it.There is an early, pre-credit sequence in which Veldini (Donald Sutherland), serving time for larceny, is confronted by a marvelously self-assertive black inmate who asks whether Veldini is dangerous, rather in the way you might ask someone if he's from St. Louis. ""Yes,"" says Veldini, a little uneasily. ""I'm dangerous.""""I been dangerous since I was 14,"" says the black man cheerfully. ""By the time they lost my records, I'd killed eight guys, at least. . . . You pretty tough kid, but you ain't dangerous.""Sutherland, playing a sad-faced, gentle, demolition-derby driver, gives the impression of someone who's too thin because his passion will not let him rest. He hasn't time for proper meals while he works on plans to wreck every car manufactured in America between 1940 and 1960. His impossible dream: a giant demolition derby involving not just passenger cars, but dump trucks, school buses, pick-up trucks, delivery vans, trailers, campers and, at the finale, mobile homes.He is, of course, the visionary loser who, by the definition of this film, is a positive force for true freedom and justice. So too is Iris (Jane Fonda), a $100-a-a-night hooker who does not know she's being humiliated until she's beaten up by the police at the direction of the district attorney (Howard Hesseman). He is not only an occasional customer but also Veldini's brother.Like Iris and all the others who come under Veldini's mad revolutionary spell, Eagle (Peter Boyle) hasn't any passion of his own. Eagle is a schizoid, out-of-work circus man (""there's not much call for human flies these days"") who hasn't a thought one way or the other about the yoke of the automobile economy.Intuitively, he recognizes Veldini's genius, and, through him, he worships the spirit of liberation. In ""Steelyard Blues"" liberation is represented by a plan to raid a Navy yard to steal an electrical circuit that, in turn, will allow the innocents to fly off to a better world in a refurbished PBY of World War II vintage.Alan Myerson, whose credits include work with San Francisco's improvisational satire group, The Committee, and Chicago's Second City, directed the film. He clearly has a sense of humor, but the movie often is totally confused in ways that can be credited to either the directing or writing.Different shots within a single scene do not match. When comedy goes thin, the volume of the rock score (actually a very good one) on the soundtrack is raised to such a fierce level that it sounds like a radio in the projection booth. It has to have no relation to the movie.It may be because Miss Fonda's and Sutherland's soberly humanitarian left-wing political views are so well known that they lend a heaviness to ""Steelyard Blues"" that it would not have if we were not so aware. I doubt it, however. They are two performers I admire very much, but this film, which may be up to their politics, is not up to their talents. Their presence gives it more importance than the material warrants.""Steelyard Blues,"" which opened yesterday at the Beekman, is the sort of caper comedy in which you cannot even take the graffiti (""Off the pigs,"" says a penciled inscription in a jail cell) without suspecting a lot of ponderous premeditation.",1973-02-01T05:00:00+0000

Neither the creaking doors, nor the footsteps in the hall that scare her half to death each night, nor Aunt Martha's prudent warnings, nor even the 110-volt charge of electric current intended to keep idle fingers from Aunt Martha's master key ring, will deter her.And so she roams the corridors of the dim old place, little dreaming that her girlfriend's boyfriend (who came to find her) has been fed in pieces to the hotel furnace, or that her girlfriend (who came to find the boyfriend) is already decomposing between trays of developer and wash in the basement darkroom of a strange, intense photographer named George.Indeed, it is George who draws Cheryl on, with his soft, disturbing eyes and his half anonymous gifts of black leather and silky nothings for her to wear. And it is George who spies on Cheryl  to her knowledge and rather to her pleasure  from behind the secret peephole in the bathroom wall.Cheryl, George, Aunt Martha, the girlfriend, the boyfriend, the crazy Mrs. Quigley and the wicked Reverend Moon  all of them live, and some of them die, in ""Private Parts,"" a movie by Paul Bartel, which opened yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room. Bartel is a young director whose previous short films have shown a genius of title (""Secret Cinema,"" ""Naughty Nurse"") not entirely matched by their content. ""Private Parts"" is no triumph, but it does mark a giant step forward toward the successful blending of precocious perversity and satiric good sense that seems the fated direction of his career.Bartel really has a theme  the willful annexing of one personality by anothera scary and potentially serious theme that at the movies tends to make its way more profitably into the horror film than any other genre. The hapless heroine of ""Secret Cinema"" finds herself unconsciously starring in somebody else's movie, shown to selected audiences in weekly installments. The not-so-hapless heroine of ""Private Parts"" dresses or undresses for a part (the film's title, of course, contains a pun) that she does not begin to comprehend until she is literally trapped in the Feudian intricacies of its motivation.Attempting to make all this funny as well as frightening, Bartel succeeds in some details and fails in others. But the attempt, even when it isn't quite working, is a good deal more interesting than most. With Ayn Ruymen as the beautiful Cheryl and Lucille Benson as her protective aunt (also a photographer, a specialist in attending funerals and snapping the moment when the spirit escapes the body) he has been fortunate in getting good performances from perfect types. Not all the film's nonsense is under imaginative control, but most of it is.""Private Parts"" is at least a hopeful occasion for those of us who love intellectual cinema and at the same time care for the menacing staircase, for the ominous shadow, for empty rooms shuttered against the light of the afternoon.The Cast",1973-02-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Feminine Plural,"In a memo to The New Yorker staff, Wolcott Gibbs once said that too many writers ended their short stories with some sentence like Suddenly Mr. Holtzmann felt tired. A similar note of vaguely cosmic resignation pervades this collection, tempting the reader to respond irritably, If this is growing up, don't want it. Maybe literary fashion is to blame for this tone; the conventional short story encourages the author to squeeze out a bittersweet revelation by way of conclusion. But more likely, Miss Spinner has assembled 10 stories about just one facet of growing up. She attempts to forestall this objection in her Foreword: In a time when the position of women in society is being reassessed, ... these stories have a particular and hopeful relevance. If they are telling us that growth is painful, they also make it clear that dispensing with illusion is the first necessary step on the path to maturity. And that it carries with it its own undeniable rewards. My copy of the book didn't mention any rewards. Mostly it showed me young women forced into such delightful options as madness, impotent rage, marriage of convenience, and passive acceptance of what Miss Spinner calls adult compromise.

us,Screen: 'Greatest Athlete':Disney College Farce Is at the Music Hall The Cast,"""Life is not so simple. You have got to make the dream happen,"" says John Amos, the black college coach in ""The World's Greatest Athlete,"" in a serious moment during a series of concocted competitions in which he is a loser. Well, the dream does happen in this farce, which has landed at the Radio City Music Hall, fresh from Walt Disney's dream factory. But it's a dream that is more often simple-minded than simple and generally as hilarious as finishing fourth in the mile run.It should be stressed, however, that this ribbing of the Tarzan myth runs a good, clean course that should grab all red-blooded sports fans up to and including the 14-year-old group. It might be added that everyone from coach Amos to Jan-Michael Vincent, in the title role, athletically tries without much success to make all this good-natured nonsense funny.One gets the feeling very soon that all concerned are involved in what appears a series of random gag situations. The athletes of Merrivale College depicted here can't avoid tripping over their own feet, which, for no convincing reason, drives our coach to go on an African safari. There he discovers the answer to his dream. And that is Jan-Michael Vincent, as the young, long-haired, blond, muscular Nanu, orphan son of missionaries, who may speak only pidgin English but can run, jump and throw like Jim Thorpe.There are many extracurricular complications, of course, such as Nanu's pet tiger and Roscoe Lee Browne, who plays Nanu's suspicious, Zambian witch doctor-godfather. Both show up at Merrivale. Tim Conway, as the fatheaded assistant coach, is momentarily turned into a tiny Tim by the angered witch doctor. And then there is Dayle Haddon, the pretty tutor, who adds romance to the course.As Merrivale's one-man team, Nanu sets records in everything from the 100-yard dash to the pole vault. However, Mr. Vincent and the rest of the cast good-naturedly do their things with speed but little discernible style, all under the uninspired direction of Robert Scheerer.Mr. Vincent, although laconic, is a handsome figure of an athlete. His coach, Mr. Amos, is spirited and willing and gives the impression that he knows he's kidding, while Mr. Conway as his assistant is properly energetic and woebegone but not really funny. Even Howard Cosell makes a guest appearance, joshing his own, authentic verbose delivery as a sports broadcaster.""It's kind of hard saying good-by to 'The World's Greatest Athlete,'"" coach Amos intones when our hero finally decides to return to Zambia. But it isn't, really.",1973-02-05T05:00:00+0000

It is rather a matter of how you happen to feel today about the tradition of noisily overstated British humor to which it belongs. Today, I feel unresistant.""Carry on Doctor"" is one of a series of British comedies (""Carry on Camping"" was the last I saw here) directed by Gerald Thomas and featuring more or less a single cast playing different roles from film to film but occupying, if you will, the same existential situations.Thus Kenneth Williams (Dr. Tinkle) is forever the oily villain aided by the enormous Hattie Jacques (The Matron) who at some point will let her hair down and slip into something more comfortable and, much to her leader's disgust, declare her love for him.The appetites and irritations of Frankie Howerd and Sidney James (here, a couple of hospital patients) will remain unchanged no matter what their ages, as immutable as the uplift to Barbara Windsor's (Nurse Sandra May's) bosom.In the hospital their manner is no different from anywhere else. And their comic acting stylea kind of fast burn twice repeatedloses no emphasis and gains no subtleties. Of course the hospital's chief surgeon has St. Vitus's dance, and of course the principal items of medical equipment are the bedpan and the urine bottle.There is nothing in the arsenal of mere movie criticism to combat this, and any mere movie critic would be an idiot to try. Furthermore, I find I rather like the plucky attachment of Nurse Clark to the resident Dr. Kilmore, and the clumsy middle-aged romance across the wards between Ken Biddle and Mavis Winkle.",1973-02-08T05:00:00+0000

us,'Black Caesar' Cues on Crime Lord:The Cast,"""I'm trying to break into the business at the top,"" a smiling assured Fred Williamson says before becoming the ""Black Caesar,"" who crashed into the Cinerama and other theaters yesterday. Despite the fact that he reaches the top temporarily and given the film's lip-service to social injustices, this ""Black Caesar"" is essentially black bad guys against white bad guys in gory warfare that evolves more as exploitation than as clear, convincing exposition of man's inhumanity to man.One can't avoid the feeling that Larry Cohen, the writer-director-producer, has stacked his melodrama largely for black machismo and constant carnage. As a youngster, our hero is already working for Harlem gangsters and venial white cops, one of whom maims him. So, before you can utter one of the many pithy epithets used in the script, he is grown up, wise in the ways of the white underworld and blasting away at the Mafia-like type on his way to the top.Our man, of course, snatches the books of the syndicate, which gives him the power he needs. And, of course, there's blighted romance with Gloria Hendry, a sultry nightclub singer, and confrontations with his heartsick mother (Minnie Gentry) as her estranged husband (Julius W. Harris) before the mob starts striking back.Mr. Williamson, who led the slave revolt in the recent ""The Legend of Nigger Charley,"" this time is equally imposing, tough and unflappableif not as dignifiedas the ""Black Caesar,"" who seems to be subject to some of the shocks as well as the fate of the original Caesar. And the performances are as obvious as the program blurb which proclaims him ""the cat with the 45 caliber claws.He's plagued, for example, by Art Lund, as the blatantly bad cop who gave him his first traumas and now, as the Commissioner and still gangland's pal, plots his downfall. Miss Hendry, as his girl, falls in love with his best friend (Michael Jeffrey) and is forced to set him up for the kill. And, as noted, Mama and Papa don't like him either.Mr. Williamson, in short, can't be blamed for the plot contrivances that hinge mostly on action and bloodshed. ""Black Caesar"" may have been shot in fine colors in Harlem and elsewhere but its bullet-filled contents are unrelievedly black and white.",1973-02-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Train Robbers':Burt Kennedy Western Keeps It Traditional The Casts,"If tone and attitude were enough to sustain a movie, then Burt Kennedy's ""The Train Robbers,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, would rank among the best-sustained movies in recent months. Except for a bitter, unnecessary, and rather stupid plot twist at the end, it is so full of understanding, fellowship and reconciliation, that the air of good feeling pervading it almost seems sufficient reason for its being.I don't think that tone and attitude are quite enough to sustain a movie, or that an air of good feeling can take the place of meaningful dramatic action. But as an exercise in pleasantness, ""The Train Robbers"" is an interesting addition to the late history of the traditional unpretentious Western.At this stage, at least in the Burt Kennedy films (""Hannie Caulder"" is a recent, also very interesting, example), the Western takes place in the Westnot a place really, but a few buildings and much countryside occupying a state of mind.John Wayne and some long-time buddiesnotably Ben Johnson and Rod Taylorband together to help Ann-Margret, a voluptuous, hard-drinking but virtuous widow, recover the half-million dollars worth of gold that her husband, a burglar, long ago stole and then hid in some Mexican desert. Only she knows where. The object isn't the gold; it's the $50,000 reward money and also a chance that Ann-Margret's little son can preserve his honor among his playmates in grammar school.You may begin to see what I mean by good feeling. The feeling is enhanced by the companionship, the growing intimacy and trust within the little band. And it is intensified from without by a menacing group of hard-riding horsemen, also after the gold, and by a mysterious stranger (Ricardo Montalban) who observes everything from the sidelines, like a nonsensical ironic fate.The turns of the story are mostly predictable and not very important. But the turns of conversation among the friends around the campfire are full of good memory and decent conviction, and it is for this that ""The Train Robbers"" seems to exist.The cast is for the most part quite lovely, led by a gentle Wayne, too old for romance but not for regrets, and well supported, most happily for me, in fine restrained performances by Ben Johnson and Rod Taylor.",1973-02-08T05:00:00+0000

If it isn't particularly polished in its acting or melodrama, this focus on an aspiring young black singer's short, unhappy life seems as honest as its depiction of the seamier practices of some of the islanders. The authentic settings in Kingston and its environs have been captured in the vivid colors dear to visitors.Perry Henzell, the 36-year-old, white producer-director-co-scenarist and a professional in the commercial and documentary film fields, has achieved a sort of cinma vrit approach to his story. The film deals with a country boy who is hurt by the minister he works for, the producer of his first and only hit record and the marijuana traffickers who hustle him until, in desperation, he becomes a gunslinger who ends up as a martyred folk hero.It must be stressed that the film is not all that grim. The heavily accented dialogue, while technically English, is, on most occasions, tough to follow, and Mr. Henzell and company helpfully have provided copious English subtitles, which amusingly makes this one of the rare, if not the first of English-language films with English subtitles.Jimmy Cliff, a noted exponent of the native rocklike Reggae music, is natural and energetic in his movie debut as the ill-starred singer-gunman. And, naturally, he makes good use of his talents with the titular song, as do others with the supersyncopated Jamaican rhythms and spirituals of the film's score.Credit for equally unvarnished portrayals should go to Janet Berkley, as a minister's ward who loves him; Ras Daniel Hartman and Carl Bradshaw, as marijuana dealers; Bobby Charlton, as the graspingly tough record tycoon, and Winston Stona, as a detective in cahoots with the ""grass"" traders.The largely amateur cast of black performers and their producer-director may be involved in basically simple action fare in ""The Harder They Come,"" but they also leave a slightly disturbing, documentary impression of the darker side of the sunny Jamaica.",1973-02-09T05:00:00+0000

But I don't see what the profit is (except for the profit from salable nostalgia) in parodying a genre that more or less lived by grace of self-parody even in the classical noon of its warmest heyday.There is certainly not much profit, even at this stage of the nostalgia business, in making an actor up like Humphrey Bogart and giving him a bit movie role in which he must ask what that bird is (""It's a Maltese Falcon""). And yet that is typical of what happens in Michael Hodges's ""Pulp,"" which opened yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room.""Pulp"" pits Mickey King (a bit up from Sam Spade?), writer of dirty novels, against a determined band of rich sportsmen who will stop at nothing, even murder, to keep him from ghost-writing the incriminating autobiography of one Preston Gilbert, former movie star, ex-Mafia man, currently living in raucous seclusion with his mother, his mistress and his bodyguard on the island of Malta.The plot, which is somewhat better than the movie it occupies, is full of incredible complications and clever conceitslike an international hired gunman who between hits teaches literature at Berkeley. But it is also a plot that is painfully aware of its origins, all its origins, perhaps on the assumption that anything is better if you can guess where it came from.You can guess where most everything comes from: the castMickey Rooney, Lionel Slander, Lizabeth Scott  partly out of the nineteen-thirties and forties; the characters  imitation Bogart, Cagney, and the likeout of those pop-culture objects now made icons; the moods and tensions, out of the collective depths of the film noir. But all this is better recollected, or revived, not reworked. And ""Pulp"" has no very interesting passions to match its ideas or its several dozen memories. For all its intricacy, intrigue and physical action, it is a curiously detachedalmost somnolentmovie.There is nothing really in the performance of Michael Caine, as Mickey King, to dispel the drowsiness, and nothing much in the deliberate, often intentionally gimmicky, direction of Hodges. I suspect that this is a very personal project for Hodges (previously responsible for ""Get Carter""), but his personality seems to have been engaged only in disparate parts.Much of the soundtrack for ""Pulp"" is given over to King's interior monologue, full of color of the ""He had eyes like bloodshot oysters"" variety. But by some cruel trick of electronic reproduction, all the other voices are weak, unresonant, difficult to hearas if picked up by a soundman working across the street, on somebody else's movie.",1973-02-09T05:00:00+0000

What it lacks in wit it has in wholesome, hearty chuckles. Add to this some nice, snowy backgrounds and slope activity in the Colorado ski country.Last but not least, it has a genuinely winning little family front and center, including Dean Jones, Nancy Olson (as Papa and Mama), Kathleen Cody and little Johnny Whitaker. They're New Yorkers who pull up stakes, head west and turn an old Gothic mansion that they inherited into a bustling ski lodge.There are few surprises, including maintenance problems, a helpful old miner (Harry Morgan), a wily banker (Keenan Wynn) and plenty of broad, pratfall gags involving the business of skiing (obviously using experts).There is a picturesque climax of a snowmobile race that would have been more impressive minus the cliff-hanging gags. But the pacing is generally easy, under Norman Tokar's direction, and the playing is genial. That old darling, Mary Wickes, finally comes to the rescue of the Baxter family like the cavalry.As for the four charming Baxters themselves, you can't beat a family like this. The new picture, which opened Wednesday in neighborhood theaters, is double-billed with a revival of the animated ""Lady and the Tramp,"" an old Disney delight.

The reason isn't far to seek. Sembene50 years old and a novelist as well as a film makeris Senegalese, and Senegal is his subject. You look for Senegal in the National Geographic, not in a movie theater. Or if you do look for it in a movie theater, you expect danger, ritual sacrifice, tom-toms, faces hidden in the treetopsthe traditional matter of darkest Africa.""Emitai,"" Sembene's latest movie, has all that  the ritual sacrifice, the tom-toms, the dangerbut with the difference that it approaches everything from the point of view of the faces hidden in the treetops. At one point in ""Emitai,"" native warriors ambush a small detachment of French colonial troops (also natives), and the absolute ineffectualness of massed spears against a few well-placed rifles should lay to rest the memories of a goof many delicious terrors during Saturday afternoons at the movies.The film takes place near the beginning of World War II, and the troops have been sent to seize 50 tons of harvested rice in a little village from which they have already impressed the able-bodied young mento serve in the army of Marshal Petain.The villagers don't exactly need the rice; it is to be used in religious ceremonies, not for sustenance. And the French don't really need it either. Halfway through the movie, deGaulle replaces Petain, the above-ground battles are ended, and so is the demand for overseas food. But everyone remains inflexible, and the story of ""Emitai"" continues to a fatal standoff in its bitter conclusion.I don't mean to suggest that Sembene doesn't take sides; he does, and of course he is not pro-French. But his stronger interest is in the life of the village; in the difficult, slightly hostile, relations between the men (who conduct the ceremonies) and the women (who seem to do the work); and in the relations between the men and the gods, who sometimes appear when summoned and sometimes don't, who generally give their worshipers a hard time, and who generally are given a hard time in return.Just before the village chief diesfrom French rifle wounds  he utterly renounces the gods, wherupon he is gotten up for a marvelous funeral, so he may rest with them in eternity. This juxtaposition is typical of the spirit ""Emitai.""It is a cool, balanced, proportionate spirit, affectionate but unillusioned, and wonderfully suited to the intricacies (and the idiosyncracies) of the subject matter. Sembene does not grab you; he engages you. Much of the time he photographs his action in the middle distancenot for the sake of distance but for the sake of an inclusiveness that keeps surprising you with its ironic sophistication.""Emitai"" isn't a very complicated moviein the abstract, little more than a tragic vignette. But for its purposes it is very complete; and considerate of the puzzles faced by its gods, its victims and its killers.""Emitai"" opened yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema.",1973-02-10T05:00:00+0000

Architect Alfredo De Vido, who shared the Haidingers' views, designed a ski house for them with a simple strength that suited its Vermont skiscape and yet passed the Stratton Mountain review board. He also managed to stay within his clients' $50,000 budget even while meeting their requests for two fireplaces, room to sleep 14 and a sauna. He designed the armchairs and dining table of the same Vermont pine he used to panel the walls and built in most of the other furniture for under $1,000, which is figured into the total cost. What else did they get for their money? An enormous living room extending 25 feet up to the peak of one of the two shed roof projections. The flat sides of the steep roofs are pierced with clerestory windows (shown at top right) lighting the living room and the master bedroom (at top left, opposite page). These offset the light loss from the roof overhangs that protect the lower windows from ice building up. Once you're inside a ski house, you stay inside, the architect points out, so the two bunkrooms (at right), a recreation room and an unbundling room for skis and gear are at ground level; the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms are warmly airlocked one flight up.",1973-02-11T05:00:00+0000

At first excited and later embarassed by the indiscreet ardor of the flamboyant Caroline, Byron found his own passions waning. In 1813, there was a rupture, and in her first novel (""Glenarvon,"" 1816), she included a satiric portrait of Byron.But years later, when she encountered the poet's funeral procession, she was mentally affected. She died in 1828; never fully recovered according to some, from the passionate attachment that made her famous.""England expected an affaire,"" reads the ad copy; ""Caroline gave them history."" But all the claims for Robert Bolt's new movie to the contrary, it would be fairer to say that England probably expected nothing much, and Caroline at least gave them (in my dictionary) an affair. Robert Bolt gives us a bit of historythat is, he gives us a corner of the National Portrait Gallery, including Canning (John Mills), George IV (Ralph Richardson) and the Duke of Wellington (Laurence Olivier, in one of his noses). And he also gives some of that intimate historical wisdom on which he has so auspiciously built a career:""I am not a fool of history,"" says Wellington.""Napoleon was,"" answers Caroline (she has gone to spend the night with him, I mean Wellington, for reasons somewhat obscure).""I mastered him!""""You will be remembered for it.""""Thankee."" (long pause)""Napoleon will be remembered for himself""!In characterizing a film like ""Lady Caroline Lamb,"" I am tempted to go on quoting lines. Let me give in to the temptation:""He writes like a housewife on the verge of the vapors."" (Hostilemalereaction to Lord Byron).""He does not mean to write like Alexander Pope!"" (Lady Caroline to the defense, neatly mentioning the one poet Byron would in fact mean to write like.)Despite its intimations of authenticity, ""Lady Caroline Lamb"" is less fact than fiction, with a plot that reads somewhat more like ""Ryan's Daughter"" (original screenplay by Robert Bolt) than like the true history of Lady Caroline. This would be perfectly acceptable if it weren't that the story Bolt tells is so much less fascinating than the story he ignores, and if he were able to give his story some form beyond the rhetoric of theatrical phrase-making that reduces the text of the movie to an endless succession of curtain lines.As Lady Caroline, Sarah Miles (Mrs Robert Bolt) very much looks the partat least from the one portrait, of Caroline in page's costume, that I have seen. Her pallor is perhaps too waxen, her manner too distracted, but her performance seems to be reaching for a character not realized in the film. Richard Chamberlain is an absurd Byron, but John Finch is a very reticent and feeling William Lambforced to do and say many uninteresting things.Robert Bolt directs (here, for the first time) in the same style in which he writes with the result that every scene, every grouping, every decision behind the camera or at the editing table is immediately effective and ultimately gratuitous. The settings are sumptuous, the costumes lavish, and the productions glossy to a fault. ""Lady Caroline Lamb"" is to cinema what the coffee-table book is to literature: a heavy but insubstantial irrelevancy. It opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater.",1973-02-12T05:00:00+0000

At the very least, one might have expected a more interesting failure than ""A Reflection of Fear,"" which opened Friday on a double bill in neighborhood theaters.""A Reflection of Fear"" deals with the horror attendant upon a delicate, rich and strange teen-age girl (Sondra Locke) whose secluded life is upset by the arrival of her estranged father (Mr. Shaw), who wants to divorce her mother (Miss Ure) so he can marry his mistress (Miss Kellerman). Horrible things happen  and if you want to guess why, I'll mention that the girl has a deep-voiced friend, a doll named Aaron. ""Life,"" as somebody remarks, minutes before being done in, ""is so full of changes.""Sondra Locke has a virtuoso role, and I guess she is impressive, and Sally Kellerman is downright good. But ""A Reflection of Fear"" has been so ponderously paced and fatally overdecorated (with symbolically ""meaningful"" decoration) that performances can't count for much. No mere actor is allowed in the way of the crystal or the chinaware. And there is such density of atmospheric haze that half the film looks as if it had been photographed through a jellyfish.Much more fun, and also pretty fancy, is the second half of the double bill, Freddie Francis's, ""The Creeping Flesh."" Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee play brothers, scientists, both mad, but one is good and the other bad. There is a scary 3,000-year-old skeleton and some spooky lunacy, but the story mainly has to do with evil, which Christopher Lee has located under a microscope, like a disease germ, and for which he means to develop an antidote.""The Creeping Flesh"" thus belongs to the grand tradition of ""Doctor, the serum! Thank God, we didn't use it on a human being!"" But the doctor has, of course, just pumped quite a lot of it into the right forearm of his beautiful and virtuous young daughter.",1973-02-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Save the Tiger':Lemmon Battles Middle Age at Tower East The Cast,"Harry Stoner (Jack Lemmon), a Los Angeles garment manufacturer, lives in a Tudor mansion in Beverly Hills where, in cold dawns, heated swimming pools steam ominously, like tanning vats. He sends his daughter to a Swiss finishing school, drives a limousine equipped with a telephone and has a wife who suggests that he see a certain Dr. Frankfurter to cure his nightmares. ""Hypnosis is the thing,"" she says.If not hypnosis, Harry is in great need of something, including money. To finance his disintegration into middle age, he juggles the books of Capri Casuals and isn't adverse to acting as a pimp for an important client. ""Dammit!"" says Harry when the client has a heart attack just before the big fashion show, ""we should have gotten the order up front!""In desperation, Harry puts out a contract to burn down one of his factories. The arsonist, a fastidious professional, reassures Harry that he has set 15 major industrial fires in three years and only had five firemen overcome by smoke. ""Each received a citation,"" the arsonist says, adding, ""but this is a matter of technology, not morality.""""Save The Tiger,"" written by Steve Shagan and directed by John G. Avildsen (""Joe,"" ""Cry Uncle""), is not a very good movie but it's a rather brave one, a serious-minded examination of some of the least interesting aspects of the failed American dream. It's not really the sort of thing a producer would expect to make $10-million with.Although both Mr. Avildsen and Mr. Shagan are aware of how all the people and places should look and sound, their film is relentlessly unmoving, largely, I think, because life for Harry Stoner is less a series of lost confrontations with conscience which might be moving than an inventory of the small affronts that are the consequences of his failures.Harry feels very badly about all the things he has to do, and people are often quite nasty to him. A parking-lot attendant is rude. Some small boys in the park won't let him play ball with them. He comes to think upon the 1940's as a kind of Golden Age when it was possible to have courage, to affirm moral stances. Harry mourns the oblivion of Lou Gehrig, Joe Penner, Henry Wallace. He loathes monster jets and plastic baseball diamonds.Harry feels so absolutely rotten, in fact, that ""Save The Tiger"" seems intentionally to sentimentalize his self-pity, as if that would somehow upgrade the feeling into true passion. It doesn't. It results in a film that is, at heart, as soft as Harryand as soft as the sequence in which he spends the night with a sweet Sunset Strip waif who tells Harry, among other poetic things: ""I saw this piece in National Geographic, about how lions and tigers always return to places of remembered beauty. . . .""The unfortunate thing is that although people often do talk such nonsense, most solemnly, the movie itself deals in the same kind of sentimentality. In spite of very good performances by Mr. Lemmon, who projects a lightweight bitterness that is a sad fact of homogenized American culture, and by Jack Gilford, who plays Harry Stoner's morally stricken partner, ""Save The Tiger"" never succeeds in disassociating itself from the self-pity it details. The film opened yesterday at the Tower East.",1973-02-15T05:00:00+0000

The concert was the climax of the seventh annual Watts Summer Festival, which marks the Watts riots of 1965.The proceeds from the $1-a-person ticket sales went to the Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation, the Martin Luther King Hospital in Watts and the budgets of future Watts summer festivals. All of the performers at the concert were Stax employes.I mention these fascinating details because they explain something about the look and feel of the film, which are those of a slick souvenir program rather than of a motion-picture documentary on the order of ""Woodstock,"" a film that assumed the shape of the event recorded. ""Wattstax"" seems to have evolved the other way around.I don't mean that the film is in any way fake; it just has the air of something too carefully laid out in advance. It's so busy being glossy and optimistic that it doesn't even allow its performers time to create on screen a measure of the excitement they might have created in person.More than two dozen solo performers and groups appear on the bandstand in the middle of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, but few of their turns are allowed to build to any sort of emotional climax. Instead, the flim keeps cross-cutting to less-than-incisive interviews with various Watts residents, survivors of the riots and architects of its future, who discuss, among other things, blues (one man says he can get them over his car).It may be because of this film context that the concert appears to have been a good deal less than exciting, though a number of good performers turn up, including Carla Thomas, the Staple Singers, Johnnie Taylor and Isaac Hayes.The only moments worth noting are provided by Richard Pryor, the actor (""Lady Sings the Blues"") and comedian who, apparently, never got near the concert. He is seen in a casual, very funny interview, seemingly shot in a nightclub, talking about his childhood and doing bits and pieces of routines that are both witty and sad, such as the one about the ex-con who fails to get unemployment insurance just because he can't find a job as a license-plate presser.The rest of the film is prefab.

us,'I Love You Rosa' Arrives From Israel:The Cast,"Although it is inspired by Old Testament law, ""I Love You Rosa,"" the Israeli-made nominee for an Oscar that arrived at the Little Carnegie yesterday, happily doesn't exude the mustiness of a period piece. Despite a slow, measured pace and a soap opera note or two, this gentle but perceptive examination of a decidedly unusual affair that happens to be set in Jerusalem of the eighteen-eighties is as sentimental as genuine love and as up to date as the women's liberation movement.In dealing largely with an 11-year-old Jewish boy's love for his young, widowed sister-in-law, Moshe Mizrahi, writer-director, sticks to his theme and avoids religious or distaff proseletyzing. He is a refreshingly professional craftsman who allows a viewer his own judgments.His story, unfolded mostly through a flashback, derives from the tenets in Deuteronomy on the duty of a man to marry his brother's widow as well as those involving the widow's rights if she's refused. Mr. Mizrahi's sentimentality may be obvious but his deft use of his material and his principals is sensitive and multifaceted.His hero, even under ancient law, is too young to marry, but he jumps at the chance to live with the sister-in-law he adores despite the opposition of his family and the taunts and attacks of friends and neighbors. And, as the drama's strongest character, the resolute widow is maternally understanding in her affection, even in the face of the community's heated criticism. When he does make love to her as a young man, a love she obviously reciprocates, she nevertheless rejects him as a husband. Eventually, he unselfishly releases her from her religious commitment. Women's liberation? She, in turn, in a somewhat sudsy finale, does choose to marry him.Michal Bat-Adam, a dark-eyed, brunette beauty (she also appears as a shriveled grandmother in the opening and closing sequence), is markedly persuasive as the stalwart Rosa who adamantly waits and achieves her rights and desires. Gabi Otterman is diffidently natural as the boy confused by love, sexuality and unbending religious requirements. And competent supporting players, among them Avner Chezkiyahu, as a compassionate rabbi, and Yosef Shiloah as the widow's suitor and the boy's employer, help enhance the bittersweet romance.Color cameras have vividly captured ancient Jerusalem, and English subtitles make the Hebrew dialogue lucidly plain. ""I Love You Rosa"" may have evolved as naive, mawkish folklore but Mr. Mizrahi's polished handling of his cast and subject makes them come alive in a simple, subdued and knowledgeable portrait.",1973-02-17T05:00:00+0000

As he noted many times himself, specialists in each of the fields he touched complained that he spread himself too thin. But almost everything he did was worth attending to, and his career has the coherence of a life lived both passionately and intelligently. He trained himself to live as an outsider looking in, and apparently he could not be seduced by the kinds of rewards his talents might have earned him though his moving journal, Five Years (1966), makes clear how deeply he longed for an audience. But even after the success of Growing Up Absurd in 1960, when he began to seem a kind of guru for the young who were dropping out or turning left, he retained his power both to be engaged and to criticize. And in the years just before his death, he was describing himself as a neolithic conservative, almost as if to ensure that he might remain outside all parties.",1973-02-18T05:00:00+0000
us,Delicious conversation piece,"Mostly, chickens are stuffed in their cavities. This more dramatic Mediterranean method, taught in Viviana Schetky's local cooking school, involves a spinach and cheese stuffing that goes under the skin of the breast. The result is a very buxom bird with unusually moist white meat. The stuffing protects the bird where it is most vulnerable to drying out from oven heat. This recipe was used originally with chickens that still had their necks attached. Such chickens are available at live poultry markets in the city. But aluminum foil or bread will seal in the stuffing just as well. The only difficult part of the job is creating a pouch of loose skin across the breast. This is not nearly so troublesome as it may seem at first glance. The method is ingenious and requires no elaborate boning. All you do, really, is to snip out the backbone with poultry scissors in order to make it possible to flatten the whole chicken slightly and pull the breast skin away from the meat to make a capacious pouch, open at the neck end and naturally sealed at the other end by the skin adhering to the legs. It doesn't even matter if you make a hole or two in the skin while stuffing. These can be easily sealed off. The various herbs add a vigorous Provencal taste. And when you serve the chicken, it will look as though you had perfected an abstruse technique.",1973-02-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Paris: Behind the Scenes at Louvre,"PARISThey may be partners now, but their policies are still an ocean apart. While the Metropolitan Museum has been deaccessioning and demoting on a scale reminiscent of medieval mass confessions, the Louvre has been quietly accessioning and promoting. The most spectacular of its recent acquisitions was the portrait of Monsieur De Julienne by Watteau, purchased a few hours before it was to go on public auction. The sitter's identity is doubtful, but the painter's is sure: The Louvre now owns the only known portrait by the Mozart of painting. Perhaps this triumph will console its curators for the trouble they got into by promoting Olympos et Marsyas. They had bought the picture, a year ago, at a public auction. Described by the auctioneer's expert as School of Caracci and sold for an accordingly low price, it was promptly hailed and displayed by the Louvre's specialists as a genuine  and therefore highly valuable  Poussin. Estimating that he had been deceived, the former owner of Olympos sued, asking that the sale be voided. He has just won his case. The Louvre is appealing. Should the decision be maintained, it is likely to make the study of works of art whose attribution poses problems an extremely risky enterprise.",1973-02-19T05:00:00+0000

us,'Lolly-Madonna' Appears on Screen,"""Lolly-Madonna XXX"" is a disaster, but I can't tell whether it's because hillbillies make rotten metaphors or because Richard C. Sarafian has made a rotten movie. The film was photographed in the Tennessee hills, and its cast includes Rod Steiger, Robert Ryan, Jeff Bridges, Season Hubley and a lot of other people who play characters with names like Laban and Pap and Ludie and Seb and Lolly-Madonna.Its high-minded intention: to demonstrate the futility of war in terms of a feud between the Feather family and the Gutshalls, which begins with some fussing over a piece of land and climaxes in the sort of fighting in which people really get their heads blown off. I assume Mr. Sarafian and his screenwriters thought they were making a film about Vietnam without making a film about Vietnam, which is the weasel way of dealing with Great Issues.Had the story about the Feathers and the Gutshalls any dramatic or emotional intensity of its own, it wouldn't be necessary to mention Vietnam. But ""Lolly-Madonna"" is so absolutely spineless, it can't even be consistent about its characters, some of whom come straight out of old Esquire cartoons and some of whom are apparently sophisticated enough to argue scruples vs. jrinciples. The result is what W. C. Fields, describing a particularly ghastly mixture of free lunch ingredients, once called a moulage.Mr. Sarafian, the director of ""The Vanishing Point"" and ""Man in the Wilderness,"" has done better things, as has the co-author, of the screenplay, Rodney Carr-Smith, who worked on ""Bartleby."" Perhaps the blame should be put on the editorI don't know.

us,'Charlotte's Web' Opens at Music Hall,"Some years ago when it was announced that henceforth all children's records would be made of unbreakable plastic, a friend of minea father with a special hatred for the nursery rhyme orchestrated and sungpredicted madness for parents and illiteracy for children.""I could always count on the kids breaking the records faster than we could buy them,"" he said. ""Now they'll accumulate . . . by the roomfuls. Imagine entire collections of Mother Goose! They'll forget how to read.""I always remember how parents and children survived that technological breakthrough when I see a film like ""Charlotte's Web,"" Hanna-Barbera's animated feature based on the funny, sad, lean novel that E. B. White wrote for childrenand for anyone else interested in the elements of style in the English language. Parents will survive it, and so will their children.""Charlotte's Web"" is not really bad in the way that the archy and mehitabel film was bad. It's not a distortion. It's just a big, bland-looking cartoon feature with a musical score by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman that sounds like any number of other Sherman scores (""Mary Poppins,"" ""Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang"").The music and the pictorial style, which seems to be a blend of early Grant Wood and late Max Fleischer, are exceedingly uninteresting, but though they blunt the precise effects of Mr. White's prose, they don't obliterate them. Probably enough of the original feeling is left to prompt the child of elegant taste to look into the book for himself, to read pure White and to look at the scratchy, rather harried, utterly charming Garth Williams illustrations.Earl Hamner Jr., who wrote the screen play, has followed the original so closely that it's still possible to be moved by the story of Charlotte, the spider who devotes her entire life (one spring, summer and fall) to saving the life of Wilbur, the stout-hearted pig who would otherwise have been turned into ham, bacon and pork chops.Charlotte's method is the word. As Wilbur preens on the ground below, Charlotte calls attention to him by weaving ""SOME PIG"" into her web above. Later she writes ""TERRIFIC,"" then ""RADIANT,"" though she's not convinced that Wilbur's action is as radiant as that of the detergent whose box supplied the inspiration.""Charlotte's Web"" is about friendship, vanity, love, birth and death, all of the things, in fact, that make life worth living, even in a barnyard. While the film version is told principally in terms of syrupy songs and pictures, enough of the text remains to occassionally please the curmudgeon.There is, for example, the healthy cynicism of old Templeton, the rat (whose personality is perfectly projected in the voice of Paul Lynde). ""Play? Play?"" Templeton screams in answer to Wilbur's invitation. ""I'm a glutton but not a merrymaker!""The one sequence in which music, pictures and original property come to some kind of happy accord is the one in which we follow Templeton's night-long debauch on soggy spun sugar, old franks, watermelon and corn cobs at the county fair.For most of the rest of the time, we have to compromise. Fern, the little girl who adopts Wilbur when he is first born, has apparently been drawn to look like the adult Julie Andrews with very short arms and legs. The animals are somewhat more attractive, though styleless, and Charlotte has remarkably blue eyes for a movie spider. The major voices are supplied by Debbie Reynolds (Charlotte), Henry Gibson (Wilbur) and Agnes Moorehead (The Goose).""Charlotte's Web"" opened yesterday at Radio City Music Hall. I have very mixed feelings about most of it, but not its ending, which are the closing lines of Mr. White's book: ""She was in a class by herself. It's not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good writer. Charlotte was both."" It's difficult to hate anything with such style, even if it's borrowed.",1973-02-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Slightly revolutionary,"New York has a concentration of working artists not to be matched elsewhere. The city draws artists from all over the world just as Paris did a generation or so ago. Artists have traditionally been considered antisocial, antiestablishment, and antihome. It's time to change that image. With the advent of loftliving in SoHo (Manhattan's south Houston Street area) many artists have acquired an enormous living space that has to be furnished and equipped. And they want the same amenities for themselves and their families as other city residents. The way artists achieve this, though, is decidedly different from the way most people do. What happens when the artist designs for the home? The results can be as brilliantly elementary as the table leg devised by Francois Arnal. It functions just like a carpenter's Cclamp. Four legs, can be clamped to any kind of top to make a table. Seating? Artist George McClancy, a SoHo painter from Philadelphia, who also teaches art at City University, takes the hardedge approach with his designs for a sofa, table and chair made with knockdown parts that fit together with handsome wooden dowels and can be shipped in flat cartons. Richard Moore, a graphics artist, takes the softedge approach with his duffle chair, three idendeal cushions filled with polyester pellets held together with canvas straps. (When the cushions get dirty, you unbelt the straps, remove the zippered covers and throw them in the washing machine.) Hedi Kyle, a SoHo refugee from California, has designed a line of table linens in brightly colored folkart motifs on natural muslin. Other artists inject a touch of wit or social concern into the design of their objects. Both sculptor Caspar Henselmann and Arman designed ashtrays to discourage smoking. Henselmann's is a fleshpink mockup of the human heart (the cigarette rests on the indentation of the aorta) while Arman's elegant metal rectangle spells out the word cancer. The diversity of these products and the freewheeling approach to design reflects the openmindedness of The Maplewalnut Studio, a new firm started by Ariane Brener and Graziella Lobo. The studio is geared to market and produce the work of American artists though they do have a working arrangement with Atelier A in Paris to exchange ideas and artistic talent. At first, the artists were very reluctant to work with us, says Ariane, because they don't want to be associated with anything commercial. We finally convinced each one that we aren't selling products, but a concept. And that concept is to involve artists in the needs of society and to put some love back into the making and selling of objects. Design, they argue, has become too much of a big business. The artist and artisan give their heart, they maintain, and we hope that the public will find the same joy in buying that we have found in making the items. Actually production hasn't always been a joy. Manufacturers are hesitant to produce items in small quantities, especially when the items don't conform to their idea of a commercial product. Mass production methods do not favor the small, experimental designer. Finding sympathetic manufacturers has not been easy. The set of table legs, for instance, called The Tablemaker, will be produced by Milgo Art Systems in Brooklyn, a fabricator of architectural metal work. Milgo got involved with artists and art by a fluke in the nineteensixties. After executing a design for artist Michael Steiner, it became a major fabricator of large scale art works for Claes Oldenburg, Richard Serra, Alexander Lieberman, Bernard Rosenthal and graphics designer Ivan Chermayeff. We do it for the love, explains Bruce Gitlin, son of Milgo's owner, we actually lose money at it. For the table linens designed by Hedi Kyle, the studio looked as far afield as India for a producer in an attempt to keep the retail prices in line with what people can afford. They hope to be able to sell them at $3 a napkin and $4 a place mat, since a major goal of Maplewalnut is to keep prices down. But that's not its only goal. We are really an open house, a forum, for ideas. We've started with objects for the home, but eventually we hope to move into many other areas, such as music and even communications. The aim, of course, is to give artists and other creative individuals, who seem left out of the mainstream, a voice in today's supercommercial society. Whether such a concept can succeed or not, Maplewalnut attempts to fill a void that many have felt for a long time.",1973-02-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Priest and Girl':'66 Film From Brazil Is at Quad Cinema,"Taken as a modern parable, the Brazilian drama ""The Priest and the Girl,"" which arrived at the Quad Cinema recently, is as mildly disturbing and fascinating as a faintly remembered legend. But it is a good deal more effective in its sharp focus on a distant but picturesque area and its depressed, little-known simple people than in its thematic clashes between sacred and profane love, temptation and native mores.Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, the writer-director represented here last year by the picaresque adventure ""Macunaima,"" is recounting in ""The Priest and the Girl,"" which he made in 1966, a moody saga of a dedicated young country padre drawn into an affair with a pretty, apparently nubile girl and the dour, brooding villagers who harass them in their sad liaison.The film was reportedly controversial in Brazil. But an American viewer finds it difficult to relate to the tragedy except on its obvious terms. One can see that the priest, played in properly anguished style by Paulo Jose, is torn between his churchly mission to love all mankind and the physical love literally thrust upon him. But the affection demanded by the girl, portrayed feelingly, if naively, by Helena Ignez, is only vaguely realized.She has been, it turns out, ""the woman"" of her jealous, elderly, domineering stepfather, portrayed laconically by Mario Lago, who has been keeping the moribund mining village alive as its major shopkeeper and buyer of the few diamonds panned. And she has also been adored by the Milquetoast druggist, Fauzi Arap, who bleats intimations of her intimacies with the village's previous priest, now dead.One is inclined to wonder at the truth of her plea for love and protection when she sobbingly says to the confused young priest, ""I love only you."" Their ensuing flight from the village, her seduction of the priest (artistically underplayed), their return home and their expulsion and pursuit by the villagers are, one supposes, meant to be meaningful, but the impact is only slight.Mario Carneiro's stark photography etches, in memorably beautiful blacks and whites, the sparse village and the rolling hills and the streams of the Minas Gerais mining country. But the implied commentary on the trials of a priest under the strictures of the church, natural passions and primitive morality is only dimly, if fervently, projected.",1973-02-26T05:00:00+0000

John Gayer believed, perhaps correctly, that racing's most faithful customers were optimists who kept coming back in the hope that one day they would crack the code and gain access to the information that would make them rich. About the same time Joe Palmer, in his column in The New York Herald Tribune, offered to bet that he could walk through the Belmont stable area wearing prison stripes and carrying a bucket plainly labeled Heroin without attracting anybody's attention.

us,'Childhood II' Looks at Encounter Group,"The released tensions of adults, psychological and sexual, that are recorded in a group-encounter feature, ""Childhood II,"" are the primary value and appeal of this documentary, even though the revelations aren't especially surprising. The new picture at the First Avenue Screening Room is one of the better group-encounter movies of about six released so far, ranging in quality from fair to very good indeed.This first offering from a new company, headed by Martin J. Spinelli, the director, and Richard M. Gibson, the producer, is marked by care, dignity and purpose. Some of the film's flaws would seem to stem partly from the therapy itself. The session participants and their director, photographed during a weekend experience at Mays Landing, N. J., are totally nude.Nudity may be considered essential to loosening tongues and inhibitions, as the group director initially reminds the clustered adults, but some discreet body posturing does indicate a slightly self-conscious awareness of the camera. Furthermore, with the group shifting to an indoor pool for more self-revelations, the photography indulges in some obtuse, psychedelic effects. Add some jivey music. The film doesn't need a note.The homestretch is best, back on the parlor carpet, as one stricken young woman discloses a father-rejection obsession hinging on a sexual incident from early childhood. This affords genuinely fine, stimulating viewing. So do the candid, clear-eyed utterances of an interracial couple called Angela and Jim.Although it does cover fairly familiar terrain in trailing other sessions on films, this is a worthy movie that may do good where such therapy is needed.",1973-02-26T05:00:00+0000
