In the struggle to reach the South Pole first, men and dogs battled geography; technical support was scant - there was no ''mission control'' - and national honor was involved. Britain's Robert Falcon Scott and Norway's Roald Amundsen were the competitors. Roland Huntford, a former London Observer correspondent in Scandinavia, has interwoven each competitor's biography - detailing the diametrically opposite personalities - with a heavily researched account of Arctic and Antarctic exploration. Writing in The Times, Walter Sullivan called ''Scott and Amundsen'' ''a remarkably vivid picture of the agonies and feuds, as well as joys, of polar exploration.'' WAYWARD REPORTER: The Life of A. J. Liebling, by Raymond Sokolov. (Creative Arts, $10.95.) A 1980 biog- raphy of The New Yorker's press critic who also served it as a war correspondent and trenchant profile writer. Liebling was also called a melancholy boulevardier, poseur, womanizer, gourmand and legendary figure among journalists. Wilfrid Sheed, in these pages, said there are gaps in ''Wayward Reporter'' that Raymond Sokolov has filled ''with much good Liebling prose, the best possible substitute for a real biography. Mr. Sokolov's shrewd excerpts also bring out (Liebling's) versatility, his perfect matching of tone to subject and his eye for the one detail - the piece of flapping underwear - that makes a scene live.''",1984-07-01T05:00:00+0000

us,STUFFED MUSHROOMS,"WE ARE OFTEN asked about how a food column originates. Do you, some wonder, spend time each week plotting what will appear the following one? No. What appears here is, for the most part, spontaneous. If, for example, one of us sees an item in a store that seems particularly toothsome, we make a mental note of it. Pierre telephones me at 8:45 A.M. each working day, and one or the other of us says, ''The mushrooms (or the cauliflower or the ducks or the salmon or whatever) look especially good.'' Over the phone, we detail a shopping list, foods we instinctively know will be compatible with the main ingredient. Within minutes of Pierre's arrival with the foodstuffs, he is at the stove and I am at a typewriter perched on an island in the kitchen. And then the improvisation starts. There is no longer any such thing as a consummately original, shake-the-foundations recipe. That is not to say new recipes are not developed.

us,PROD PUERTO RICO,"Britain has its persistent Northern Ireland problem and Canada its perplexing Quebec puzzle. The United States has Puerto Rico to contend with. Like Rubik's Cube, there is no easy answer. Perhaps the United States should now take the initiative and help prod Puerto Rico along to a resolution of its obsessive and enervating political-status dilemma. That might be necessary because Puerto Rico is adrift in a whirlpool of conflicting political whims and desires, none of which commands overwhelming support among the 3.2 million residents of this island commonwealth, which enjoys ''free association'' - however unsatisfactory - with the United States. Washington's official, and commendable, policy toward the question of statehood or independence or improved commonwealth status is that the whole thing is something Puerto Ricans themselves, as United States citizens, must resolve through internal self- determination. But such a policy, while technically correct, nonetheless perpetuates, however well-intentioned, a debilitating stalemate that is eating away, like a cancer, at a once vibrant island that had a distinct sense of purpose, forcing it to skew its priorities and to misdirect its considerable creative energies. Instead, perhaps Washington ought now to spell out to Puerto Rico exactly what it is prepared to offer in terms of possible statehood or independence or - maybe best of all - a ''culminated commonwealth'' status (granting even more autonomy to the island) that would be a credit to America's daring and innovation. Otherwise, Puerto Rico - once so promising, once such a model for the third world - will simply muddle along, trying its best to cope with horrendous structural unemployment and poverty (according to the 1980 Census, 62.4 percent of Puerto Rico's population lives under the Federal poverty level) while enduring more trauma on the question of its political status.",1984-07-06T05:00:00+0000

The report, the first broad measure of June economic activity, suggested that growth continued at a stronger pace than the Administration had expected. Martin S. Feldstein, the outgoing chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said he ''would worry'' if the economy ''doesn't slow down further'' in the second half, referring to the threat of increasing inflation. The jobless rate for black teenagers fell sharply, but Government analysts said that may have been a statistical fluke. (Page 1.) In New York, unemployment rose, but in New Jersey and Connecticut, the rate fell. The biggest change was in New York City, where the jobless rate jumped to 10 percent, from 7.6 percent in May.

us,A SURVIVAL FIGHT IN MACHINE TOOLS,"IN Pratt & Whitney's sprawling machine-tool factory here, an unsettling quiet has set in. Many of the assembly bays in the hangar-like room stand empty, parking spots are easy to come by in the company lot and workers hover over aging equipment that has been dulled by decades of use. Trounced by imports and struggling to fatten an anemic order book, the plant here, like the rest of the machine-tool industry, is grappling with its worst crisis since the Depression. Business should have improved markedly by now in this once-thriving industry, which makes the high-precision metal-cutting tools essential for producing such things as automobile fenders, airplane fusilages and the machines needed by other industries. But the business continues deep in the doldrums, with no letup in sight. As many other industries surge ahead, propelled forward by the country's booming economic recovery, the machine-tool industry is still in crisis. Orders, which analysts estimate could reach about $2.8 billion this year, are stuck at half their 1979 levels and employment, at 67,000 workers, wavers around 30 percent below its peak at that time. While American industry is operating at over 80 percent of capacity, machine- tool manufacturers are treading water at just 60 percent of capacity. Imports have become such a significant factor that they now account for almost 40 percent of the market, double the level of only five years ago.

Even so, the lawmakers left plenty of unfinished business to keep them occupied in the fall. With all 211 Statehouse seats to be contested in November, the legislators looked for issues they could campaign back home on, while putting off action on those that might pose political problems. Among the former were some ''get-tough'' criminal justice measures reducing access to trials in misdemeanor cases and allowing prosecutors to seize property used in drug dealing or certain other crimes. The lawmakers also adopted the nation's first program to curb acid rain, mandated seat belt use and moved to bail out struggling state banks by permitting them much broader leeway in investing their money. But it was generally accepted that before the end of the year the lawmakers will return to the Capitol at least once and maybe more often.

This book by a sociologist at Harvard describes the evolution of America's health care system and how doctors took control of every aspect of health care. Published in 1982, it was called ''a monumental achievement'' by our reviewer, H. Jack Geiger, a physician, who added, ''For all its scholarship, it is intensely readable and graced with style.'' ''The Social Transformation of American Medicine'' won the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, the 1983 C. Wright Mills Award in sociology and the 1984 Bancroft Prize in American history. THE MADNESS OF A SEDUCED WOMAN, by Susan Fromberg Schaeffer. (Bantam, $3.95.) The heroine of Susan Fromberg Schaeffer's fourth novel, ''The Madness of a Seduced Woman,'' is a beautiful woman whose passion and self-revulsion lead her to murder her rival for a man's love. Rosellen Brown wrote in The Book Review that the 578-page story is ''an enormous, engrossing feast for those who hunger for the fiction of extreme emotion'' and ''an absorbing, wonderfully inventive psychological tale of a woman imagined as we would never dare, or want, to be.''",1984-07-08T05:00:00+0000

''Japanese clothes are not for everyone,'' she said as she pulled out a voluminous white cotton dress. ''They're very comfortable, but I feel lost in them. I'm attracted to them because they're like works of art. But I'm not able to wear them.'' Next door, at Henri Bendel, the entire summer collection of Comme des Gar,cons by Rei Kawakubo was marked down 50 percent. There, in the small, quiet boutique on the third floor, Alicia Bilbruck was pulling out a white cotton skirt that was crinkled, pleated and folded with the Japanese trademark: one size fits all. ''This is a great skirt,'' she said, as she held it up against her Calvin Klein shirt and Ralph Lauren skirt. ''I've always liked the Japanese clothes. They're funky. They're always in good fabrics.'' As a Westchester housewife who has been buying Japanese clothes for the past two years at Barneys New York and at Bendel's, she finds their big selling point is comfort.

This is the theme of her new novel, as it may well have been of all her others. Her devoted readers have always been aware that there is a metaphysical component to her fiction, and it is something of a relief that it has at last broken cover in the present work, which is both an extremely sophisticated account of the perils that surround our unsuspecting lives in the world today and a disputation on the subject of the Book of Job, which she calls ''the pivotal book of the Bible.'' Job and his disconcerting predicament challenge every optimistic belief one yearns to accept, lodging like a hard mass of contention in the consciousness of the hopeful believer. The same sort of existential distress is experienced by Mrs. Spark's current protagonist, Harvey Gotham, yet Mrs. Spark is too wise a writer to impose this metaphor on her readers, and her narrative is as seamless, as unnerving, and as expert as her readers have come to expect from this most excellent of storytellers.",1984-07-15T05:00:00+0000

And yet there is a touch of self-consciousness about it all, the barest hint that Mr. Samaras knows exactly the effects his primitivist sensibility provokes.

For the Agudat, Israel was just another secular state.

Now someone else will have to be found to turn out verses commemorating jubilees and great occasions and royal milestones. The appointment, formally made by the Queen but on the Prime Minister's recommendation, is not expected to be announced until the autumn, but it has already provoked a great deal of comment in Britain - far more, I think, than was the case while Betjeman and his immediate predecessors were being chosen. Leading bookmakers are even offering odds on the main contenders, and finding plenty of takers. Philip Larkin is the clear favorite so far; other names who have suddenly found themselves propelled onto the front page include Roy Fuller and D. J.

us,IN THE ENGLISH MANNER,"-BEDROOM PARK AVENUE apartment from a large Sutton Place maisonette a few years ago. ''I have a house in Southampton and wanted a manageable place in town,'' says Josef Pricci. Nevertheless, when it came time to decorate the apartment, Pricci opted for the kind of furnishings - overstuffed furniture, billowing draperies and collections of collections - that are more often associated with grand English country houses than with Manhattan pied- a-terres. ''I wanted to create the feeling of a home rather than an apartment,'' says Pricci. The result is a gracious, well-mannered interior that translates the feeling of the English country house into a more urbane scheme. This might be because Pricci was not schooled in interior decoration. Although he majored in economics and designed jewelry for a number of years, Pricci sort of fell into interior design when he was asked to do a 22-room duplex eight years ago. ''Of course it was done in the English manner,'' says Pricci. ''I had grown up in apartments and country houses that were always filled with English things, so it was an easy style for me to fall into.

Shylock is allowed to say too much on his own behalf, and the Christians are too often permitted to expose their opportunism and avarice, for the earlier play to be bluntly dismissed as anti-Semitic propaganda. And Shakespeare opens ''Henry V'' by suggesting that the great Agincourt campaign was inspired by Machiavellian churchmen, who saw in it a way of deflecting legislation that would rob them of revenues; he goes on to show the fear, the resentment, the cynicism and the rapacity to be found in the ranks of the conquering army; and in the very last sentence of the play he reminds the audience that Henry VI promptly lost everything his father had so painfully gained in France. ''The surface meaning is certainly that Agincourt was a lovely war,'' the dramatist John Arden once wrote, ''but there are so many corrections of this view in the structure that one is forced to wonder if the author had not written a secret play within the public one.''",1984-07-15T05:00:00+0000

Unless the company can demonstrate that Shoreham is virtually certain to operate - an event that would almost assure the company of long-term health - then new loans may only postpone insolvency, with Lilco facing mounting bills in coming months.

Last night, on the way to a 2-1 victory over the Cubs that increased their first-place lead to four and a half games in the National League East, they found that their most promising pitcher can succeed when not at his best. Before a crowd of 51,102 at Shea Stadium, the Mets' biggest since July 10, 1982, Dwight Gooden struggled with his control. He allowed seven walks - but only four hits - on the way to his ninth victory in 15 decisions. His fastball was good enough to collect eight strikeouts and increase his league-leading total to 162, but the rookie right-hander won more through his sheer determination and persistence than his 90-mile-an-hour fastballs or darting curves. ''I had a tough time early,'' said Gooden, who gave up six walks in the first five innings, after averaging about three a game in his previous 19 starts. ''Finally, I started to get command of my pitches more and more. I was below average early. I guess that's part of the game.'' For the Mets, clutch hitting was also part of the game. Wally Backman, with the score tied at 1-1 in the seventh, delivered the winning run with a line single to center that scored Rafael Santana. The victory, the seventh straight for the Mets, lifted their record 22 games over .500 (59-37). They have won 25 of 35 one-run games and, for the month of July, they have are 21-4, an .840 winning percentage.",1984-07-28T05:00:00+0000

Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor G. Komplektov said ''the current American position makes impossible the conducting of the kind of negotiations we are talking about,'' but he appeared to leave the door open to change of position based on what he called ''the development of diplomatic contacts.'' (Page 1, Column 6.) The White House sharply denied Moscow's contention that the Administration's stand was making it impossible to hold talks on space weapons. Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said, ''We have accepted the Soviet proposal for discussions in Vienna in September without preconditions,'' and that the Administration's preparations for the talks ''are continuing vigorously.''

''Russia'' describes how people in the Soviet Union feel about the country, its Government, cars, homes, schools, premarital sex, crime, sports, drink, prices, food, war and peace. ''For the first time,'' Mr. Knightley wrote, ''I now know something about todays's Russians as a people.'' Originally published in 1976, the book has been updated. THE FREE STATE , by V. S. Naipaul. (Vintage, $4.95.) This collection - which earned V. S. Naipaul England's Booker Prize in 1971 - consists of two stories, two frag ments of a travel diary and a short novel. The last prompted our reviewer, Nadine Gordimer, to write, ''I know of no other contemporary novelist who can deal so devastatingly yet quietly with the sensation and terror at the core of ordinary encounters.'' She added, ''This (book) is not his best work, but it is part of an achievement that I believe in the end will show him to have been a great writer.''

She and her second husband first met as kids in the neighborhood; together they brought up in Harlem, too, her own two daughters by an earlier marriage. To Mrs. Ringgold, who smiles at ''a sort of backwardness'' in herself that keeps her there, Harlem is a small town that radiates warmth and a sense of shelter, and its life and people loom very large in her art. So it's only fitting that this summer a local institution, the Studio Museum in Harlem, is devoting its main exhibition galleries to a Faith Ringgold retrospective, celebrating 20 years of her art (through Sept. 4).",1984-07-29T05:00:00+0000

It is like some monster from the deep that must be constantly beaten back and kept out of view so as not to horrify the public. More than any other single factor, I have come to think, the fear of boring audiences accounts for the rash of desperately contrived productions that have disfigured the face of opera in recent years. It has been suggested, with some reason, that the scarcity of important singers has forced opera houses to let stage directors to take over the asylum. However, there obviously is more to it than that. Even on those rare festive occasions when starry casts can be assembled, the singers are often treated as props in a vaudeville show. Trying to hear the music in some opera performances has become a frustrating game.",1984-07-29T05:00:00+0000

However, the network received strong ratings from its telecasts of the first two days of the Games last weekend, and if they continue that way, it is less likely ABC will win a significant reduction in its two remaining payments, which include $30 million due on Wednesday and $15 million in September. The ABC executive, Roone Arledge, said in an interview published in the July 30 issue of the magazine Advertising Age that ''every dime of any reduction made'' would be passed on to advertisers of the Games. He said that the rebate was not expected to exceed $30 million. A spokesman for ABC Sports, Thomas G. Osenton, said he was unable to confirm the comments attributed to Mr. Arledge. A cut of $30 million would make it much more difficult for the organizing committee to end the Games with a surplus, as it has vowed to do. Money left over from the Games was to be distributed to youth athletic clubs. A Surplus Projected The nonprofit organizing committee was projecting a surplus of $12 million of a total budget of $510 million, assuming that ABC would pay the $45 million balance remaining of the $225 million it agreed to pay when it acquired the television rights to the Games.",1984-07-31T05:00:00+0000
