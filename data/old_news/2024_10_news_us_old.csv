The best ones can also do double duty; you can apply lipstick with a small, angled eyeliner brush, for example. And while putting on makeup with your fingers can be great — skin-to-skin contact warms formulas, helping them to blend easily — you need brushes if you’re looking for polish and precision.

us,Rental Competition: Not Just a New York Thing,"It’s hard enough for renters in New York to find an apartment they can afford in a neighborhood they like. Then there’s the added challenge of beating out competitors for it. But a September report from RentCafe suggests that Chicagoans — and Philadelphians, Milwaukeeans and Omahans, among others — face even tougher conditions.The study gauged competitiveness on RentCafe’s Rental Competitiveness Index (RCI), based on five metrics: occupancy and lease renewal rates, average days vacant, prospective renters per vacant unit, and the share of newly constructed units. The data, taken from market-rate rental buildings with at least 50 units, paints a familiar picture in the most popular places: demand is strong, people who already have a lease are unlikely to give it up, and newly built properties are scarce.Chicago (fifth in the competitiveness ranking) and its suburbs (first) have surged to the front of the pack, “challenging Miami’s long-held dominance in the U.S. rental market,” according to the study. The Windy City is attracting new renters with a combination of traditional economic springboards, like major employers relocating there, and newer ones, like the transformation of once-sleepy commuter towns into hipsturbias. The demand is intensified by high occupancy rates — only one in 20 apartments is available — and slow construction of new apartments, which account for just one in 1,000 rental properties in the Chicago suburbs and one in 200 in the city itself. This has led, in places, to rent bidding wars.Different forces underlie RentCafe’s list of highly competitive smaller rental markets, where Madison, Wis., and Fayetteville, Ark., lead the way. Madison is attracting tech startups and their employees, while Fayetteville is experiencing surging enrollment at the University of Arkansas.But the problem is the same everywhere: insufficient rental stock to meet the increasing demand. Even in ninth-ranked Manhattan, 24 percent of available apartments wound up in bidding wars this June (though rents themselves remained more or less stable, thanks to a jump in new construction). Perhaps London will become the next hot borough: In a bid to stabilize out-of-control rents, Britain’s Labour government is planning to ban rental bidding wars in England entirely.",2024-10-03T09:04:31+0000

us,Why Cakes Can Be a Powerful Form of Protest,"LONG BEFORE WOMEN finally — though incompletely — won the right to vote in the United States in 1920, they were finding ways to influence politics. In late 18th-century New England, colonial women would make muster cakes — spiced, doorstop-heavy confections flecked with candied fruit and soaked in alcohol — for soldiers being gathered (or “mustered”) to fight in the Revolutionary War. Later, women baked what became known as election cakes to potentially encourage voters to back causes that they cared about. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, suffragists included several such recipes in the cookbooks that they published — volumes that featured quotes from famous supporters alongside sometimes satirical recipes such as Pie for a Suffragist’s Doubting Husband, the crust of which was to be mixed with “tact and velvet gloves.” For the suffragists, cookbooks were “a tool largely to convince men that they had no plans of leaving the kitchen,” says KC Hysmith, 35, a North Carolina-based recipe developer and culinary historian. “The rhetoric used against them was: If women get the vote, they’re going to leave you to cook your own food.”",2024-10-09T09:01:06+0000

One supplier was the farmer Søren Ladefoged, whose crop has recently benefited another local attraction: the fine-dining destination Noma. The chef Mette Søberg, 34, who heads Noma’s test kitchen, was inspired to add tender young shoots to the menu after the restaurant’s 10-week pop-up at the Ace Hotel in Kyoto last year, where thinly sliced bamboo was served in squid broth. “In Japan, and in Kyoto specifically, they’re so excited about ingredients that are in season for a short time,” she says. From late March through May, “everyone knows, ‘Ah, it’s bamboo season!’” Back in Denmark, she started grilling the shoots over pine boughs for a slightly smoky tinge and serving them with a butter and sencha tea dipping sauce. “We want to make it really simple so people can actually taste the bamboo,” says Søberg, who describes the plant’s flavor as “nutty, vegetal and a little bit sweet.” She adds that many Noma diners are surprised to encounter bamboo in Denmark, where it’s cultivated but not typically consumed. Outside of Asian restaurants, the same is true in the United States, where, at Brooklyn’s Cafe Mado, the chef Nico Russell, 36, has been pickling the shoots and serving them with razor clams in a garlicky sauce. He gets his supply of the yellow groove variety from the New Jersey-based forager Tama Matsuoka Wong, 66, who described this year’s demand as “a frenzy.” Wong, who specializes in harvesting edible invasive plants, points out that yellow groove multiplies rapidly through horizontal roots and can quickly overtake a plot of land. She works with property owners to contain the plant, while getting it into the hands of chefs like Mads Refslund, 47, of the wood fire-centered restaurant Ilis, also in Brooklyn, who has ordered over 750 pounds from Wong so far this year. This past summer, he served vertically cut salt-cured shoots with buckwheat oil-brushed uni and caviar pooled in the divots of the stems. He also preserved the majority of his supply, he says, so that — despite bamboo’s short season — he can offer it for months to come. — Ella Riley-Adams",2024-10-10T09:02:03+0000

Eleven years later, he opened his own workshop in Geneva’s Saint-Gervais quarter, where he would eventually design his first key-wound pocket watch featuring movement wheels and hands intricately carved into swirling gold arabesques and an enamel dial marked with Roman numerals. But it wasn’t until 1819, likely while traveling through what is now Italy, that Vacheron’s grandson Jacques Barthélémi Vacheron met the Genevan watchcase salesman François Constantin; the two competitors quickly became partners. Constantin suggested adding jewelry to their timepieces to attract additional clients and, a few years later, their bejeweled creations — featuring amethysts, rubies and garnets — caught the attention of Prince Borghese and Victor Emmanuel I, the former king of Sardinia.

us,A Pioneer in Metal Furniture Gets a New Exhibition,"In 2014, when the artist Dan McCarthy moved from Brooklyn into a converted schoolhouse in upstate New York, he decided the grand hall would be a future gathering spot for his many Facepots: large, wonky vessels decorated with a spectrum of grins and grimaces. The earliest ones, about a decade old, recall a time of emotional swings. “I hadn’t even found the clay that worked,” McCarthy says of that experimental phase, “so a lot of the pots were breaking in the kiln.” He learned to relinquish control, repairing the salvageable works using the Japanese technique known as kintsugi, in which mended seams are accented in silver or gold. The Facepots brought a new openness to McCarthy’s practice, as did the Hudson Valley. Absent the city’s pressures, he explains, “I was like a kid — on my hands and knees, lost in making a thing.” “Freedom,” a new monograph of McCarthy’s work, charts that arc, with nods to his Southern California upbringing, seen in rainbow-colored paintings of surfers and songbirds perched on guitars. Birds also animate new ceramic works in his solo exhibition at the Tokyo gallery Kosaku Kanechika, on view through Nov. 16. For McCarthy, these first faceless pots offer a shift in narrative. “Instead of a vessel, maybe it’s a nest,” he says, describing a fascination with his neighborhood birds. Kintsugi-like detailing appears on these pieces, too: Silver-leafed slabs camouflage the occasional split, while shiny rectangles evoke the little mirrors tucked inside birdcages. For the artist, fresh off his first flight to Japan, it’s a time of possibility. “I’m 62, which is old and not,” McCarthy says. “I think I’ve got another act in me. It should be an adventure.” “Dan McCarthy” is on view through Nov. 16 at Kosaku Kanechika, Tokyo, kosakukanechika.com.",2024-10-17T09:06:26+0000

But if the movie’s portrayal of rivalrous (and homoerotic) hypermasculinity doesn’t always seem original, it is nevertheless realized with seriousness and vigor. Berger takes a keen anthropological approach to the rites and rituals of the fictitious Kappa Nu Alpha house, and he makes it so that you can almost smell the stale beer and crumpled Ralph Lauren.

us,This Novel for Young Readers Imagines Anne Frank Before Her Diary,"“I want to go on living even after my death!” Anne Frank writes in one of the most unforgettable lines from her venerated “Diary,” the book that has done more than any other work of literature to give readers throughout the world a sense of what was lost in the genocide of six million Jews during the Holocaust. Some of those readers — who also happen to be writers — have responded to her call by turning her into a fictional character. A version of Anne who survives the war appears in at least three novels, most famously Philip Roth’s “The Ghost Writer” (1979), in which the young Nathan Zuckerman, Roth’s alter ego, encounters her as the attractive research assistant to his mentor and fantasizes about marrying her as a way of proving his Jewish bona fides to his parents.",2024-10-18T09:02:06+0000

us,Has Winnipeg’s Greatest Filmmaker Gone Hollywood?,"At some point during the production of his first film, “The Dead Father,” Guy Maddin made one of his most consequential decisions as a director. It was the early 1980s, in Winnipeg. Maddin was around 26 and had only recently started watching movies seriously, thanks to a friend who had been sneaking him into film classes at the University of Manitoba. When he had the notion to make his own black-and-white short, he reckoned it prudent to pick up a book on filmmaking. The one he chose mentioned three distinct types of lighting, so when shooting began, Maddin dutifully aimed all three of the lights he’d procured at his lead actor’s face. The three lights produced three nose shadows. He unplugged one light, then another. The third left a single nose shadow. It looked like a Hitler mustache, but Maddin just told the actor to move his head until it disappeared.",2024-10-18T09:02:43+0000

It’s mostly a memoir of childhood — of a poet’s childhood, or of the way that all children have a poet’s imagination. “The mind of a child,” she writes, “is like a kiss on the forehead — open and disinterested.” It is “mystified by the commonplace” and “moves effortlessly into the strange,” glimpsing and gleaning, “piecing together a crazy quilt of truths.”",2024-10-24T16:34:19+0000

By 2020, she was sharing videos of her original songs, which blend elements of synth-pop, electronica and chanson Française, on Instagram. Her expressive, sometimes husky voice caught the attention of Warner Chappell/Virgin Music, which released her first album, “La Symphonie des Éclairs” (“The Symphony of Lightning”) in spring 2023. It went platinum in 2024 and earned four awards at Victoires de la Musique, the French version of the Grammys. Tomorrow, a reissued edition will hit streaming platforms with new material, including “Old Friends,” which de Sagazan recorded with Odell. “I basically slid into his DMs,” she says. “We’ve been friends since.

There’s the timeline of art history, long enough to be measured in epochs and eras and movements, and the one of openly expressive gay culture, which is so furiously compressed that, since the 1969 Stonewall uprising, it has essentially shed its skin and become something new every five years or so. The first history can be found in museums and textbooks; the second, until recently, had been preserved only when someone was prescient enough to know that what others might dismiss as disreputable, disposable or degraded was worth retrieving and archiving. The bewitching quality of Paul P.’s portraits is that their creator, a serious, studious and engaging Canadian, is aesthetically bilingual. He can speak about his indebtedness to the tradition of artists like John Singer Sargent and James McNeill Whistler, but also about the decades of research hours he’s put in at Toronto’s Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives — now called the ArQuives — from which he’s sourced the subjects of his paintings, poring over images of post-Stonewall, pre-AIDS magazine and gay-porn erotica for the face, the look, the come-on, the sulk or the mood that might inspire his next work.",2024-10-31T09:03:58+0000

In a process that can take years, Stark drips, layers and shapes oil paint until it rises an inch or more beyond the canvas, creating three-dimensional images that look like surreal, metaphysical clip art. In her first New York show in more than 20 years, “Ethereal Material” at Ortuzar in TriBeCa, Stark’s wide-ranging oeuvre will be on full display in pieces spanning over 30 years. “My work is broadly autobiographical and confessional,” she says. Sometimes a dream or meditation inspires a painting. After her cat Samantha died, she appeared to Stark during a moment of reflection, surrounded by what the artist describes as a flower of light. “I painted the image [“Samantha” (2005)] and found that afterward a healing had occurred,” she says. Other times, personal objects spark ideas. Her eldest sister’s senior picture prompted “Silver That Girl” (1998), Stark’s simple, shiny version of the actress Marlo Thomas’s classic 1960s flip hairdo. It became a tribute to “a generation of graying feminists,” says Stark. “It’s a statement about the beauty of a silver-haired woman.” “Ethereal Material” will be on view through Dec. 7 at Ortuzar, New York, ortuzarprojects.com.",2024-10-31T09:05:31+0000
