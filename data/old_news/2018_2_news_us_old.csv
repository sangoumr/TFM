Thats because the owner, Ed Raven, who also owns Greenpoint Beer & Ale nearby, is running the restaurant under a farm brewery license from the state. It permits him to serve beer by the glass without a separate license and, as a brewery owner, to open an off-premises restaurant or retail establishment. Mr. Raven has also collaborated with North Brooklyn Farms in Williamsburg for many of the ingredients used by the three chefs, each of whom has a specialty. Christian Perkins, who worked at Marlow & Daughters, is the butcher. Emma Jane Gonzalez, a vegan, and the omnivorous Kenneth Monroe come from North Brooklyn Farms. Their menu features seafood, steaks, sausages and vegetable specialties like charred sweet potatoes with kale and tahini, celery root with apples and crispy nori, and a green chile stew.

He had appeared numerous times on CNN, MSNBC and the networks, typically opposite their star anchors.

Though he didnt bring much clarity to his role, the appearances did make for great, albeit surreal, television. Like the time he insisted to Anderson Cooper that his conversation with the Russian ambassador during the Republican National Convention was not actually a meeting. Anderson, Page explained, a great analogy is you and I were members of the same health club here in New York previously. And I remember walking by you, even though we didnt know each other, and I said, Hi, Anderson, and you said hello, and we, you know, had a nice little exchange for half a second.

But this year, Dear Basketball, which the retired N.B.A. star Kobe Bryant conceived, executive-produced and narrated, drew some #MeToo movement disapprobation when it was announced as one of the five nominees for the 90th Academy Awards. On social media and elsewhere, a 2003 sexual assault case against Mr. Bryant (which was later dismissed) was cited as a reason not to honor the movie. But the content of this short is unobjectionable on the surface. Directed by Glen Keane, the movie is an autobiographical sketch in which Mr. Bryant thanks basketball  both the object and the game  for the life he devoted to it. The animation, rendered in modes of pencils and pastels, has a gorgeous fluency to be sure. The score is by none other than John Williams, American cinemas king of the Heroic Theme. Ultimately, Dear Basketball is substance-free, an advertisement for itself. It deserves to not receive an Oscar for that reason alone.",2018-02-07T15:45:14+0000

Beneath them are runners embroidered with elaborate designs and names in gold thread  women of accomplishment who are familiar and unfamiliar, mythical and rarely spoken of: Sappho, the ancient poet; Anna Maria van Schurman, the 17th-century artist, thinker and theologian; Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female physician in the United States.

Cramer  a producer of television shows including Dynasty and The Love Boat  asked the artist Ellsworth Kelly to design a free-standing structure on his vineyard near Santa Barbara, Calif. Cramer was a loyal collector of the artist, and wanted Kelly to make an original, large-scale artwork for his property. Kelly, who died in December 2015 at the age of 92 and whose career was defined by stripping painting and sculpture down to their elemental components of form and color, made designs for what appears from the outside to be a simple double-barrel-vaulted building, alluding to Romanesque and Cistercian religious architecture and resembling an igloo made of stucco. Inside, the artist had planned for a number of revelations. Colored-glass windows  arranged as a grid over the entrance, as a ring of tumbling squares on one side of the building, and a sunburst on the other  would bend the light in different ways. On the walls was Kellys take on the stations of the cross  14 marble panels, variations on stark black-and-white abstractions. In the rear of this single-room structure, where one would expect to find the crucifix in a Christian church, would be one of Kellys totem sculptures  a thin column standing over the interior like a sentinel.

She also must confront some terrifying Islamophobia, just as Ahmed herself once did. My first experience with Islamophobia was during the Iran hostage crisis, Ahmed says, describing how a man began hurling obscenities at her. I was a young child. I was stunned, truly frozen. I had never heard that kind of language, had never had that kind of hate directed at me. It was a shattering moment, an event that changed my worldview. She adds: That is part of what I wanted to capture in Love, Hate & Other Filters  that moment when a young persons life is shattered by an event that has nothing to do with them. Mayas main narrative is shot through with a secondary tale, an unfolding act of domestic terrorism. That story was inspired by two very specific references, Ahmed explains, the interstitial chapters in The Grapes of Wrath in terms of craft and structure, and a line from In Cold Blood, by Truman Capote: Presently, the car crept forward.

Currently, my brand is just me on a sewing machine in my parents front room, says Williams, who recently interned with Vivienne Westwood. For inspiration, she imagined a group of goddess-like figures whose purpose is to fight the capitalist patriarchy. I hope the feeling will be almost warrior-esque, she told T.  Accordingly, her garments are designed to celebrate womens bodies. Why should women broaden their shoulders like men to feel powerful? Why not do the opposite? she asks. Her fall/winter 2018 collection, an expansion of her graduate collection, is defined by exaggerated silhouettes and intensely textured, handcrafted textiles, which are made of mostly renewable or repurposed materials such as plastic bags. I want my work to show that eco-fashion can still be visually exciting and push concepts and ideas beyond the fact of its sustainable ethos, she says. ",2018-02-09T18:10:11+0000

Were looking back not in a nostalgic way but to create something new, Bottura says. Italians have the gene of the artisan and the poet.

Hes now 19, as slight as a reed, with hair like a tangle of spiralized carrots. His restaurant, in a pair of narrow storefronts on the Lower East Side, consists of the Living Room, an all-day cafe serving coffee, tea and pastries from morning until 5 p.m., which has just opened. In two weeks, the adjacent Dining Room will follow, with $155 (including tip) set-menu dinners. My idea is to make it like a dinner party, he said. So guests start with a glass of Champagne and hors doeuvres in the cafe before proceeding to the main room, with its simple wood tables and open kitchen, for an appetizers, followed by a couple of family-style platters of pasta and meat, like a lamb feast, with side dishes. Appetizers might include peanut Ritz Crackers with foie gras, king crab with leeks and grapefruit, and slow-roasted sunchokes with pumpkin seed oil and apple. Mr. McGarry describes Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park and Ari Taymor of Alma in Los Angeles as mentors. They let me work in their kitchens, but gave me real responsibilities and taught me the business side, instead of just having me pluck herbs, he said.

The only Peruvian ever to have won a Nobel Prize, Vargas Llosa now lives in an eight-bedroom mansion on the fringes of Madrid, in the neighborhood known as Puerta de Hierro. When I arrived, a butler in a white jacket led me through the enormous two-story foyer, across gleaming black and white tiles, into a library lined with dark wood bookcases. A crystal ashtray sat next to silver dishes of chocolate and cigarettes. This imposing casona seemed like a fitting residence for the last living giant of a golden age of Latin American literature, a man who may well be the most politically important novelist of our time, but the house does not belong to Vargas Llosa. Over the librarys fireplace hung a portrait of its owner, Isabel Preysler, in a red dress.",2018-02-20T10:00:07+0000

This is an underserved neighborhood, Mr. Hardy said. The restaurant, named for the recording studio once housed at its address, is starting with a breakfast and lunch cafe in the front half of the space, serving what Mr. Hardy calls chef-driven food, not the usual muffins and egg sandwiches. It has a handsome sweep of bar for drinks and dining, and a marble bar for wine, with comfortable seating. By night this area will become a wine bar and dining counter with the same menu as the airy dining room beyond. The design, by Ken Fulk of San Francisco, suggests midcentury modern. The dinner menu is what Mr. Hardy calls more uptown than those at his other restaurants, with less Neapolitan fire, more Piedmontese complexity and a greater focus on seafood. The winter menu has a crudo section and dishes like crispy sunchokes with puntarelle, chestnut tagliatelle with duck rag and duck offal, and Icelandic sea trout with pickled fennel and horseradish. Arvid Rosengren, an award-winning sommelier, is a partner here and has assembled a mostly French and Italian wine list.

Theater Four, as the joint was called, was a dowdy old converted church in a part of Manhattan that the plays author, Mart Crowley, called a senseless-killing neighborhood. But Luckinbill wasnt lugging tools to make repairs. Instead, he drilled a hole in a piece of the set called a tormentor flat, about waist-high, so that he and his eight castmates, standing backstage, could get a glimpse of whoever was sitting sixth row center: the best seats in the house. Over the coming weeks the actors took turns peeping at the likes of Jackie Kennedy, Marlene Dietrich, Groucho Marx and Rudolf Nureyev.
