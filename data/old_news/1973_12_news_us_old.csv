us,What's Doing in ATLANTA,"THE CITYSeveral years after his troops burned Atlanta to the ground, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, the first American urban renewalist, returned to tell the city fathers he had really bestowed a favor on them: They could build a modern city. After a lapse of about a century they took his advice, and today Atlanta's growth and prosperity are the envy of every Chamber of Commerce east of the Mississippi and south of Cincinnati. Atlantans, both black and white, are justly proud of their metropolis, and traveling salesmen exhausted from the ennui of Birmingham, Ala., or Raleigh, N. C., look forward to the joys of Atlanta. However, one caveat to travelers who come here seeking a Babylon on the Chattahoochee, as it has been called: Even though Atlanta remains a friendly town, filled with a lot of friendly people, bigness has not yet created the institution of greatness. The rapid growth has been in motion for about two decades, not time enough for the things that men cherish about big cities beyond air pollution and traffic jams to catch up with the economic indexes. That is not to say that Northerners exhausted with urban blight don't, find Atlanta refreshing and revel in the beautiful spring and fall, which are perfect for golf and tennis, or that Southerners drawn here don't find it the greatest thing since sliced bread. Hotlanta, the good ol' boys from the hinterlands cry, and every night you can find people craning their necks at the glass elevators sliding down the middle of the vast Regency Hyatt House lobby, the No. 1 tourist attraction in the city. But if glass elevators don't knock you out, Atlanta's night life can present a challenge. And forget about Sunday, when there is an absolute ban on all alcoholic beverages in bars,FOR CIVIL. WAR BUFFSGrant Park is a kw minutes from downtown (don't lot. a minute think it was named for Ulysses S.), and in the middle of the park is the Cyckrama, which sounds like a Honda dialership but is actually a panoramic painting of the Battle of Atlanta, a sort of circular nineton American Heritage foldout. If you wonder why it is housed in a inausoletilike building, don't forget it was painted by Union artists about a Union victory (adults $125, children 75 cents). Kennesaw Mountain, site of the national battlefield park, is a short drive north of the city on 175. You.can drive or walk to the top to survey the countryside to the north where the Confederate defenders of Atlanta first engaged Sherman's troops. There is no museum, but maps and markers provide a feeling of the sweep and scope of the engagement. Margaret Mitchell, author of Gone With the Wind, ordered that her notes and unfinished writings be destroyed at her death but for hardcore G. W. T. W. buffs there's a Margaret. Mitchell room in the Atlanta Public Library, showing her few surviving personal effects. Bus tours into the Tara plantation country of Jonesboro, southeast of the city, are available during the summer. Stone Mountain, of no historic significance other, than that the modern Ku Klux Klan was revived there in 1915, is the centerpiece for a state park and has a titantic bas relief of Confederate heroes on one side. Admission is $2 but costs inside the park can pile up, including fares for such rides as, the sternwheel riverboat and the cable car to the top of the mountain, which is the world'sARTS AND CULTUREThe city foist from the ashes left from Sherman's torch, but no phoenix survived the 1962 crash in Paris of the airliner carrying the foremost: patrons of the arts in Atlanta. The cultural renaissance that was, under way perished with the victims and was replaced with a Maddoxism that bans plays like Boys in the Band and movies like Last Tango in Paris. The High Museum of Art, 1280 Peachtree. Street Northeast, has a Monet (one of the Houses of Parliament), but the collection is skimpy. The Atlanta Symphony, with Robert Shaw conducting, tends to be circumscribed by pressure to perform old favorites. To find out what attraction is currently at the Civic Center, from opera to bluegrass music, call 5236275.MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S GRAVEIt's a simple grave at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, 407 Auburn Avenue Northeast, marked only, by a torch and the Words Free at Last, Free at Last/Thank God Almighty, Free at'Last.

us,PANEL ASSESSES GRADUATE STAFF,"A panel of academicians recommended that American graduate education would strengthened by putting emphasis on research and fishing in evaluating faculty members. The proposal is one of 26 a report entitled Scholarship for Society, issued yesterday by the Panel on Alternate proaches to Graduate Education. The 18month study conducted under the auspices of the Graduate Record Examinations Board and the Council of Graduate Schools in United States. The board sets policies under which entrance examinations for graduate schools are written and the council is composed of 307 universities that award 98 per cent of the doctoral grees in this country. In the 20,000word report panel asserts that current yardsticks for measuring faculty performance are irrelevant to many important activities graduate professors. Many professors, according to the panel, are repeatedly distracted by the need to cover themselves professionally through publication  often writing papers less significant to the cause of knowledge than the very project that is interrupted. There has been a continuous dispute in academic circles about the importance of research and publication, critics holding that teaching performance and other factors are not sufficiently considered in hiring, promotion and the granting of tenure. We're not talking about abandoning research and publishing as criteria, Dr. J. Boyd Page, the chairman of the Panel on Alternate Approaches, said in an interview. We just don't want them to be the sole criteria, as they have been so often in the past. Diversity Sought The panel proposes no precise amount of weight that each activity should carry in the evaluation of faculty members. It urges instead that to foster diversity among institutions, each university or graduate school, according to its functions and mission, should determine the relative importance of the various criteria. Other recommendations by the panel include the following: Graduate schools should be receptive to accepting as students and teachers people who do not have the usual academic credentials. Successful achievers in business and government, for instance, are suggested as faculty candidates. Part of a student's program, especially at the doctoral level, should call for those who do not already have such experience to become engaged in disciplinerelated work outside the university walls. Efforts should be intensified to recruit women and minority members as students and professors in graduate schools. As a part of such efforts, regulations regarding course sequences, residency and other requirements should be made more flexible to accommodate the needs of special groups such as parttime, women students with families. Reevaluation of Schools We have emphasized that there are new roles as well as new clientele for graduate education, Dr. Page writes in the preface to the report, and we urge no less than a reevaluation of the basic objectives and organization of each graduate school and the disciplines essential to it. Among the members of the panel, along with Dr. Page, were Dr. Daniel Alpert, director of the Center for Advanced Study at the University Illinois; Dr. Warren G. Bennis, president of the University Cincinnati; Dr. Patricia Albierg Graham, professor at Teachers College of Columbia University, and Dr. Rochus E. Vogt, professor at. California Institute of Technology. Another member of the panel, Benjamin H. DeMott, a professor at Amherst College, was the principal writer of the report. Copies of Scholarship for Society are available for $2 each from Educational Testing Service, which coordinated the study. Orders may be sent to E.T.S. in Princeton, N.

us,"Lang's 'Testament of Dr. Mabuse,' at Cultural Center Tomorrow:The Cast","Although we now live with melodrama on a weekly basis, it's still immensely refreshing on film. Fritz Lang's ""Testament of Dr. Mabuse,"" the sequel to his ""Doktor Mabuse"" of 1922 (which was shown at this year's New York Film Festival), yields a sensational torrent of images that almost make the early nineteen-seventies seem tame.The second ""Mabuse,"" which can be seen at the New York Cultural Center tomorrow, was made in 1932 and had only a brief run in Germany until Goebbels banned it in 1933. (Evidently, the German original hasn't been shown in this country; only the French version has been exhibited.) Goebbels offered Lang the job of running the German film industry, and the director's response was to leave the country that day.Goebbels at first tried to steer movies toward Brown Shirt propaganda, but these did so poorly at the box office that he soon encouraged lush escapist films instead. Yet Goebbels also cherished the notion of a Nazi ""Mrs. Miniver,"" which was attempted in Hamburg toward the end of the war. It wasn't completed, due to script trouble, actresses who failed to show up on the set because the German submarine fleet had landed, the vast British raid on Hamburg and a director who flipped his lid.In Lang's 1932 classic, Mabuse, the master criminal and hypnotist who wanted to dominate the world, is now a lunatic in an asylum. The muscle-bound sensualist of the first film appears as a ravaged wraith in the second. But he continues to direct his gang of hoods: on his written orders, they kill and steal, set fire to chemical factories and plan to destroy crops and to poison water supplies.Lang wrote in 1943 that he'd designed ""an allegory to show Hitler's processes of terrorism. . . . I hoped to expose the masked Nazi theory of the necessity to deliberately destroy everything which is precious to people. . . . Then, when everything collapsed and they were thrown into utter despair, they would try to find 'help' in the new order.""Mabuse dies. But he has already hypnotized his psychiatrist, who continues to carry out the dead man's schemes. It's a fine case of mind poisoning and demonic possession, which also evokes the spell that Hitler cast on the German psyche. Pursued by the bulky, ebullient Inspector Lohmann (acted by Otto Wernicke, who played the same part and trailed Peter Lorre in ""M""), the psychiatrist comes to look more and more like Mabuse, and finally goes as mad as his own mentor.While this ""Mabuse"" lacks most of the surrealistic effects and the dazzling hallucinations that gave its predecessor such magic, it's rich in the images and the shocks at which Lang excelled. Mabuse's trained killers arrange a murder in a traffic jam: as the doomed man smiles at the rhythm of the cars' horns honking around him, and then presses his own horn to jibe with the same beat, we realize that he's unwittingly giving the signal for his own execution.Mabuse's death is first announced by a close-up of still, bare feet: hands tie a name card to the stiff ankles. (But his supernatural powers have been stressed so often that it's hard to believe he's really dead.) A curtain  which used to reflect Mabuse's shadow while his voice gave ordersis parted to reveal a dark silhouette painted on a wall and a recording machine: the ruse merely makes him seem more ubiquitous than ever.In ""Mabuse,"" as in some of Lang's other movies, the director most brilliantly conveyed the sense of being trappedthe moment when death or lifelong consequences close in. Here, during a shootout with the police, the criminals panic and turn on one another, fighting savagely about whether to surrender or hold out. Meanwhile, a young couple locked in a basement with a ticking bomb decide to break a water pipe in hopes of diminishing the inevitable explosion; when the woman fears that they'll be drowned if they're not blown up, the man looks at her fondly and shrugs slowly.For most of Lang's characters, there was rarely an escape-hatch. The climax of the first ""Mabuse"" showed the Doctor frantically trying to fight his way through bolted doors. Lang seemed to specialize in people who were desperate to escape: either from places where they might be killed or from situations that they found intolerable. The Mabuse films remind us again of what Lang himself escaped fromand of our own good fortune in being able to savor the body of work that he achieved after that escape.",1973-12-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:' David Holzman Diary' Spoofs Cinema Verite,"""Life as a work of art""at least once a decade that ancient concept seduces some members of yet another generation, and inspires them to hash up their lives in the name of truth or beauty. Jim McBride's ""David Holzman's Diary,"" a totally delightful satire on ""the blubber about cinma vrit,"" mocks those ghastly reels from the nineteen-sixties, when various film makers immortalized themselves or their friends by trying and failing to be spontaneous. ""Diary,"" which derides directors who scorned imagination or invention while worshiping the camera, opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art.Holzman, an earnest young Godard-hound, decides to film his life in order to understand itand only succeeds in ruining it. As a voyeur, a gentle intruder into other people's lives, he can't understand that the filming makes his subjects feel self-conscious, or that ""reality"" is altered by the presence of his camera and his tape recorder and his lavalier mike, which he calls his ""friends.""His girlfriend, who detests his movie-making, finally leaves him because of it. He's already told us in a dry, flat voice that he really loves her, though he can't resist pointing out that she's ""dirty, sloppy."" Forlornly, he adds, ""I don't quite get her sense of privacy."" After she's gone, he argues that masturbation is an improvement on the real thing because You can think of anything . . . pigs. Think of trains going in tunnels. Think of bagels. I mean, you're not limited to women.""However, his obsession with freezing everything on celluloid rarely allows him any other fantasies. He gives manic attention to every detail of his New York neighborhood, from derelict sofas on the street to the installation of matchstick bamboo blinds in a nearby apartment, and finally gets slugged by a cop for filming people through their windows.Soon, we realize that the camera is his analyst. He tells it everything, and then grows furious because it doesn't answer him with ""the right things,"" and also makes him ""do things"" that he wouldn't ordinarily do. Accusingly, he asks it, ""What do you want?"" Then he shouts at the lens that it hasn't helped himjust as a frustrated patient may denounce an all too silent psychiatrist.""Diary"" was made in 1967, and time has served it very well. We get a pungent flash on the past when a radio announces the numbers killed in the Newark riots, or refers to ""the new Israel-Egyptian cease-fire,"" or quotes the Pentagon on the probable increase of American forces in Vietnam next year. But aside from politics, that period now seems a rather innocent one in retrospect, and the character of David Holzman (admirably played by L. M. Kit Carson) distills the eager naivet that accompanied the zest for technology, deliberate inarticulation and the mistrust of words, the vibes and the hoaxes and all the lighter put-ons of 1967.At the end, Holzman is bitterly disappointed that his movie and his camera have taught him nothing  least of all how to control his life. The picture reminds me of the late A. J. Liebling's recollection of being 23 in Paris, when he felt that his life hinged on an impossible decision. Meanwhile, he was writing a novel about a 23-year-old in Paris whose future hung upon an insoluble choice. When the character caught up with the day of his own life that he was describing, he couldn't finish the book. Jim McBride's movie evokes the spirit of Liebling's enormous laughter when he remarked that few diaries yield conclusions or solutions.",1973-12-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Middleclass premier find,"HOUSTON. On Nov. 7, the moon and the planets of Venus, Pluto and Saturn were at right angles, forming what astrologers call the Grand Cross, with Pluto, representing upheaval, in opposition to Saturn, representing stability. The Grand Cross is like a block of pentup energy, a source of avataric power, astrologer Richard Greer explained. The tailed Kohoutek comet flickered over Houston, announcing, Geer said, ego death and other momentous changes in human consciousness. On Nov. 8, Aquarius rose, which meant the dawn of the Aquarian age in the West. On Nov. 10, Mercury, the planet of the mind, crossed the equator of the sun, which it does every 13 years. This is the very message of Guru Maharaj ji, Geer said, the mind being gobbled up by the basic life force. He couldn't have better time. While these auspicious astrological configurations formed in the heavens, a threeday festival called Millennium '73 and billed as the most significant event in the history of humanity was taking place in the Houston Astrodome. The Astroturf was covered with red carpeting, and the carpeting was covered with thousands of blissedout followers of the perfect master, Guru Maharaj ji, who will be 16 tomorrow. At one end of the Astrodome, where the goal posts are placed for football games, and extending to the 23yard line, stood an enormous white plastic stage lit from the inside and divided into seven fernfringed segments, sprinkled with artificial ponds of cellulose acetate over aluminum foil. One segment was a stage area for plays and dances. Another was a stand for Blue Aquarius, a 56piece band led by the guru's hulking, coweyed brother, 20yearold Bhole ji. On a higher, platform sat 24 of the guru's 2,000 mahatmas, or close disciples, all but one of whom are Indian. On the highest platform sat the holy family. The guru's mother, Mata ji, and his two other brothers, 23yearold Bal Bhagwan ji and 18yearold Raja ji, were on orange thrones. Three steps up, 300 feet off the ground, sat the guru, as motionless as an ivory Buddha, on a blue velveteen throne with a circular blue Plexiglas back framing his head like a halo. A 14foot white Plexiglas flame, symbol of his pure fire, rose behind him, and a cathoderay tube projected rainbows on 60foot curtain that hung saillike over his head.",1973-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film:'Don't Look Now,' a Horror Tale:Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie in Leads The Cast Suspense Yarn Turns Into a Travelogue","Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now,"" which opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater, is a fragile soap bubble of a horror film. It has a shiny surface that reflects all sorts of colors and moods, but after watching it for a while, you realize you're looking not into it, but through it and out the other side. The bubble doesn't burst, it slowly collapses, and you may feel, as I did, that you've been had.Not only do you probably have better things to do, but so, I'm sure, do most of the people connected with the film. These include Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, who play a haunted young English couple, and maybe even Mr. Roeg, the director, who has staged a number of individual sequences with a lot of dash and style, but not enough to disguise the emptiness of the screenplay.This is credited to Alan Scott and Chris Bryant, who have taken a minor short story by Daphne Du Maurier and attempted, unsuccessfully, to elevate it into something on the order of ""The Turn of the Screw.""It doesn't work. The film takes its supernatural phenomena seriously, but the suspense depends on a twist that comes not at the end but about halfway through. At which point, ""Don't Look Now"" stops being suspenseful and becomes an elegant travelogue that treats us to second-sightseeing in Venice.For John Baxter, an art historian, (Mr. Sutherland) and his wife, Laura (Miss Christie) Venice is a city filling up with disasters as it sinks back into the sea. Unknown to John, though not to us, he is gifted with second sight. The film opens with an agonizing sequence in England when their five-year-old daughter drowns in a nearby pond, a fact that John senses without questioning why.In Venice, where John is working on the restoration of an ancient church, the Baxters encounter a pair of mysterious English biddies, one of whom has the ""power."" They cheer up Laura enormously by telling her they've been in touch with her dead daughter. They also warn John that danger awaits him if he stays in town.Actually this plays somewhat better than it tells. Mr. Roeg is able to maintain a sense of menace long after the screenplay has any right to expect it, largely because of the sincerity of his actors and because of the presence of the sinking city itself.Mr. Roeg, who was a cameraman before becoming a director with ""Performance"" (co-directed with Donald Cammell) and ""Walkabout,"" gets a great performance from Venice, which is all wintery grays, blues and blacks, the color of the pigeons that are always underfoot.The one bit of color that registers on John is that of a brilliant red parka worn by a child who, from the back, looks just like his dead daughter. The figure appears to him at night, at the end of dark alleys or fleeing from something on the other side of the canal. John also has some other hallucinations that I dare not describe without giving away the plot.I can describe a beautifully photographed love scene between John and Laura, which is intercut  for essentially comic resultswith post coital scenes of the couple getting dressed for dinner afterward. The point, I guess, is that if you can see into the future, it's often difficult to keep your mind on the present, no matter what you're doing.One of the problems with ""Don't Look Now"" is that second sight does not easily translate as a terrifying talent for a film character to possess. It simply looks like a flash-forward, which, along with the flashback, the jumpcut and the fade, are standard story-telling devices in movies.",1973-12-10T05:00:00+0000

They fall in love, have a quarrel, are reconciled, stroll in fields of marigolds (hundreds of violins play tremulously) and meet stern objections from his father, an arrogant businessman, and her father, a lovable fisherman.The heroine, Dimple Kapadia, doesn't quite die at the end of the movie as Ali McGraw does in ""Love Story,"" but she tries. Dimple and her co-star, baby-faced Rishi Kapoor, attempt to jump off a cliff after a long chase and a short speech on the generation gap. The pair are saved by their fathers. Happy ending.The month-old film, ""Bobby"", a sort of ""Love Story"" Indian-style, has emerged as the biggest movie success in years. The critics are surprised and even disgruntled about the film's success but ""Bobby"" has all the obvious elements: two new stars, musical numbers when the story lags, a touch of socialism, an obvious appeal to younger audiences, some sexy scenes, violence and three-hours of extravagant escapism.Beyond this, the Hindi film is one of the first to be dominated by youthful actors involved in a scenario, albeit lightweight, about adolescents and parents. The accent on youth is relatively new to Indian movies, whose performers are often older than the characters they portray.""People wanted to see some new faces, especially a new girl, and Dimple's perfect,"" said Mohammad Shamim, film critic of The Times of India. ""She's young, she's fresh, she's pretty in an Indian way, kind of thick around the waist.""""Of course it's a fairy tale,"" Mr. Shamim told a visitor. ""These kind of characters don't really exist in India. Is there a boy anywhere who is so innocent about sex, so completely free of class consciousness, so good? It doesn't happen. It's all a dream.""""The film is an enormous success,"" he said. ""It may be the biggest grosser we've had so far in India.""""Bobby"" is now playing at a half-dozen theaters here, and is opening across the country to extraordinary ballyhoo.Mr. Kapoor, who is 22 years old, is invariably besieged at air ports, train stations and hotels by hundreds of girls wearing new shirts with the name Bobby printed on them. The actor's father, Raj, produced and directed the movie, and members of the Kapoor family themselves are known as the Redgraves of the Indian film world, with Rishi's uncles, Shashi and Shammi, major film performers.Rishi's co-star, whom everyone calls only Dimple, is an ample, slightly awkward teenager who plays the title role, Bobby.One critic wrote, ""It is a male name . . . But never mind, our filmmakers were never sticklers for such minor details.""The plot leans heavily on surging background music and profound, silent glances between Dimple and Rishi. The story involves a rich youth who falls in love with his ayah's, or nanny's grand-daughter, whose father is a fisherman from Goa.The pace rarely falters. There are ritzy parties in the hero's pseudo-Gothic family apartment, scenes in a garish discotheque, a tearful reconciliation in Kashmir, a masked ball and an elopement on a scooter. There is even a socialist touch: The youth, who has a picture of Nehru and Gandhi on the wall of his fancy bedroom, turn against his capitalist father and marries the fisherman's daughter.""The film is a sad reminder that the old moth-eaten formula of dream merchandising still works wonders with the masses,"" said the critic for Shankar's Weekly of Bombay, said: ""Of course any resemblance here and there to ""Love Story"" and ""The Graduate"" must be purely accidental! But even such resemblance does not lend substance to the hackneyed rich-boy-meets-poor-girl theme.'",1973-12-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Happy New Year',"Claude Lelouch's ""Happy New Year"" (""La Bonne Anne"") is as much like any number of other Claude Lelouch films as one chicken egg is like another. It shouldn't be reviewed. It should be candled.This one, which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is a little old. It's about an off-season caper in Cannes, an attempt by Lino Ventura and Charles Grard, two charming, naive, pragmatic, straight-laced, middle-aged con artists, to knock over the Van Cleef & Arpels shop down the Croisette from the Carlton Hotel. In the course of their preparations, Lino falls in love with Franoise Fabian, the beautiful, worldly, understanding, amusing, liberated, intelligent, witty, sensuous, compassionate, 30-ish owner of an antiques shop next to Van Cleef & Arpels.Though Franoise rates five more adjectives than Lino, she, in turn, falls in love with him. The caper comes off, but not as planned. There's a lot of Francis Lai music on the soundtrack, a lot of footage devoted to transportation by car, truck and train, and a lot of Mr. Lelouch, including some scenes from ""A Man and a Woman.""I find it difficult to understand how a director as intelligent as Mr. Lelouch, who has a feeling for comedy (""Money, Money, Money"") and who hires such attractive performers, can make a film as totally vacuous as ""Happy New Year.""

It focuses on five designers who invented new ways to dress the modern woman who was struggling towards emancipation. Naturally, their work was Paris, the center of all culture. No upstart New York was yet calling itself the fashion capital of the world. Oriental opulence, the brilliant colors of the artists known as the Fauves and of Diaghilev's Ballet Russe are all influences on the clothes, but the marvels are the clothes themselves.

It wasn't then foreseeable that he would become such a fine character actor, as is now clear In ""Henry VIII and His Six Wives,"" which opened yesterday at the 86th Street East and is opening at neighborhood theaters. The movie production was shot afresh after the success of the British Broadcasting Corporation's television series, shown here on the Columbia Broadcasting System.Mr. Michell vaults the decades with agility. After the boisterousness of his young Henry, he grows to look more and more like the Holbein portrait, and then as though that portrait itself had aged. Lurching from side to side on gouty limbs, waxing wider and bulkier with every scene, he excels at random rages and also in changes of moodas he hurtles suddenly from fury to self-doubt. Tears are usually a test of talent, and his are touching when he weeps unwillingly at the death of one wife and the infidelity of another. He storms and lumbers through the period with gusto, hands laden with heavy rings land with a crash in a dish of succulent food, and it's pleasing to hear his scornful pronunciation of ""imp't'nt"" (impotent) and ""Papissst"". Throughout, the Tudor grunts are well orchestrated, whether inspired by feeding or love-making or dying.Frances Cuka has a moving dignity as the rejected Catherine of Aragon, and Jane Asher manages to be both appealing and austere as Jane Seymour. However, Charlotte Rampling (Anne Boleyn) unleashes too many peals of carefree laughter, and Donald Pleasence overdoes his meaching rodent act as Thomas Cromwell: the twanging Northern accent that issues from his pleated lips seems more appropriate for Dickens or even Pinter.This is a fairly sophisticated performance of a very simple-minded scenario  hence it's a bit hard to be certain whom this movie was designed for. Perhaps it should be ranked as healthy popular entertainment for those who enjoy the lusher style of English classical acting (I do), even when the script hardly threathens Shakespeare. For this ""Henry,"" you need a soft spot for jousting, masques and mummeries, lutes and trumpets, pageantry rampant, hunting scenes and limpid evocations of the English countryside. Otherwise, the movie might make you yearn for urban grit and the most sarcastic jokes that our meanest streets can provide.",1973-12-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Ed Emshwiller Retrospective on View,"Of the legion of avant-garde, experimental or, if you will, independent ""underground"" movie makers, Ed Emshwiller, who has been industriously filming since 1959, deserves the retrospective show that started last night at the Film Forum. If the collection of seven of his shorts, running a total of more than two hours, tends to be slightly repetitive and occasionally a strain on the eye and ear, it also forcefully illustrates the work of a creative professional who towers above many of his competitors.Oddly enough, the sole new offering, the 22-minute ""Chrysalis,"" made this year with the Alwin Nikolais modern-dance troupe, is only fitfully effective. In tracing and dissecting his choreography through simultaneous, split-screen, slow and accelerated motion, one often gets the impression of expert technique rather than drama or emotion.And, his rarely seen 20-minute ""Film With Three Dancers"" (1970) is notable mostly for complex camera work that utilizes superimposed and double images (in addition to introspective dialogue) to stress the movement of its three principals.List as the most striking and thoughtful, if not completely comprehensible, subjects in the lot, the 38-minute ""Relativity"" (1966) and last year's 29-minute ""Scape-Mates."" In ""Relativity,"" Mr. Emshwiller explores his personal concepts of man and his universe through complicated graphics, animations, several human figures and an electronic musical score. He conveys vaguely similar ideas through humans, animations and drawings in the five-minute ""Thanatopsis"" (1962).""Scape-Mates,"" shown early this year on Channel 13, is a versatile videotape mix of computer-aided filming, the Moog synthesizer, animation and arms and legs and human forms to achieve swiftly moving, often arresting patterns from geometric shapes and lunarlike landscapes.The earliest work, the 7-minute ""Lifelines"" (1960), seems to be merely experimental in its involvement with placental-like drawings and the nude woman seemingly evolving from them. And ""George Dumpson's Place"" (1964), is an 8-minute exercise concerned simply with affectionately examining dolls and other bric-a-brac strewn about an old black man's garden. The selection may be a special package for special tastes, but it vividly projects the talent and imagination of an artistic film maker.",1973-12-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Snapshots' Clicks as Film About a Film,"Experimental films of a movie in production, with impromptu soul-baring by the contributors, are an avant-garde staple by now. Most of them are pretentious bores. But ""Snapshots,"" which the Whitney Museum of American Art is presenting through Wednesday in its New American Filmmakers series, is an exception.Produced by Kenneth E. Schwartz and directed by Mel Howard, the co-writers, the picture is apparently a truthful production diary involving on-camera embraces by some young Greenwich Villagers and off-camera bickering by one and all. This is not a movie for everybody. The sex is explicit and the language is fierce.Yet the whole thing has a fresh, spontaneous flow and thoughtful texture. Mr. Howard's sideline use of his own family background is original and amusing, almost a movie in itself (with some haunting camera shots of the Ellis Island shell). Wryly amusing, too, and revealing, is the bleak confusion after the director steps aside as leading man and hands over his heroine-mistress, Turid Aarsted, to his handsome photographer, Paul Goldsmith, the new hero.Add to this some beautiful color photography, effective use of Mahler music and the pervading determination of Mr. Schwartz (heard but not seen) and his partner to get it all on camera, as something different. And it iseven touching, ultimately. The only catch is a redundant finale that suggests Hitchcock's ""Psycho.""Let's ignore that candid postscript, with the two movie makers, who express their discouragement with the project. We need them around.",1973-12-14T05:00:00+0000

So famous has Palm Springs become that its name is now actually a generic term for a skein of winterresort communities stretching 50 miles down the Coachella Valley from towering San Gorgonio peak on the northwest to the salty Salton Sea on the southeast. Palm Springs it self, occupying a 10mile stretch of the upper valley, draws a million visitors annually and, heginning in November, its permanent population of 23,100 swells to 70,000 or more. Palm Springs and the eight other main communities in the Coachella Valley resort complex together attract 3million visitors a year. So overlapping are these communities that the tourist is hardly aware of leaving Palm Springs as he travels 12 miles north to Desert Hot Springs or south to Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, Indian Wells, La Quinta, Indio, Coachella and on to the Salton Sea.",1973-12-16T05:00:00+0000

A few Americans, like late swallows, drifted about the park, amazed, overwhelmed by its beauty, yet scarcely one realized that every tree, every stretch of water, even every hill, had been carefully planned; indeed, was manmade: a construction like the house itself. The park and house were created with a deliberate grandeur to celebrate Blenheim, that famous victory in 1704 which launched Britain into imperial greatness. And it was there (how appropriately) that Winston Churchill was born; and now, a mile or two away, lies his grave. In the distance, on that Sunday, the church bells tolled for Remembrance, remembrance of those men who had died in two world wars, died to save an empire that was irretrievably lost; winning the wars, yet losing the peace. Serene and beautiful as it was, Blenheim and its park symbolized so many of Britain's problems, so many of the specters of history that still haunt its days and nights. All countries are entangled the thickets of the past, no matter how young or how old they may be.

The voice certainly did not come from the stage, and I took it for granted that this was one of the special effects that the Metropolitan sometimes uses. Several readers have pointed out that Munzer's voice was not amplified. She was singing from the orchestra pit.

As he grew older, gratuitous human contacts became so abhorrent to him that if someone brushed against him in the street he wouldscream aloud with rage and horror.

us,"SaltNoody, Dujo, Lee, Jill, Snooky, Mumps, Shaft and Dee Dee","There is a building in upper Harlem on a shabby side street with several other buildings that resemble it in both appearance and condition. This building is in an advanced state of deterioration; only cold water runs through the water pipes, the rats here are as large as cats. The saving grace of this building might very well be the erratic patterns of the varied and brilliant colors of the graffiti which adorn it internally and externally from basement to roof. This building has no electricity in the apartments, but the electricity in the hallway lamp fixtures is still on. Some of the apartments have garbage piled up in them five feet high and that makes opening the door a very difficult task for those whose nasal passages are sufficiently insensitive to permit entry. In some of the apartments and on the rooftop, the garbage and assorted debris are piled only one or two feet high, and the trash has been there so long that plant life has generated. The most rapid tour possible through this building will necessitate boiling oneself in a hot tub of strong disinfectant for a couple of hours, and even then this astonishingly formidable breed of lice will continue to make its presence felt throughout a long itchy night. This building adjacent to a fully occupied tenement whose inhabitants are families, some of which include several children. This building has a few steps missing from the staircase above the second floor and there are no lightbulbs in the hallway; it's a very unsafe place for trespassers, even during the day. This building's last family of tenants was emancipated several weeks ago; they hit the numbers and moved to the Bronx, shouting, Free at last; free at last; thank God for the number man. Prior to their liberation, the last family had lived a most unusual existence. Somebody had to be at home at all times to protect the familys secondhandhot television from becoming a thirdhandhot television; there were too many junkies in and out who used the vacant apartments to stash their loot until they could down it and who also used some of the apartments for sleeping and as shooting galleries. For protection, the last family had a large, vicious German shepherd. This dog was needed for the rats as well as the junkies. A cat would be no help at all. The sight of the rats in this building would give any cat smaller than a mountain lion instant heart failure. The last family considered itself fortunate, despite the many unpleasant, unhealthy and unsafe aspects of its residence. We ain't paid no rent in two years. I guess the city just forgot that we was here or they was just too embarrassed to ask for it, said the head of the last family. This building has holes in the walls large enough for a man to walk through two adjacent apartments. This building has holes in the ceilings on the fourth and fifth floors, and when it rains, the rain settles on the floor of a fourthstory apartment. This building is not unique, there are many others like in the ghettos of New York City; and like many others . . . this building is owned by the City of New York.",1973-12-16T05:00:00+0000

That was the failure of disks to convey the energy of certain groups who gave high voltage performances but did not create very distinctive music. Bands without the clearcut musical identities that often come from hit records must work twice as hard as bands which hit home runs up the charts immediately. But the staying power of the former type is usually longer because they have built up a faithful following based their live shows.Pursuing a grueling string of onenighters, groups like the J. Geils Band and Black Oak Arkansas have become top moneymakers in the concert field because they have this solid block of kid power behind them. Yet, though each has just released its fifth album, only Geils has achieved even one gold album (signifying milliondollar sales) because they need to be seen as well as heard. Even Alice Cooper, who by now has had five albums out of seven certified gold, is in a similar spot because his records reveal how much his fame ultimately rests on the insanity of his image.",1973-12-16T05:00:00+0000

Graham clung almost fanatically to the moment of performance. She hated passing on her roles to other dancers; hence, when she no longer danced in a work, it stopped being done. To Graham, repertory meant the work she was creating, plus whatever else was necessary to complete a program. Dances were dropped, lost, revived with great difficulty, dropped again. She never used notation, and until recently she refused to let other companies do her works. The number of her dances that have been officially filmed is pitifully small, and the informal work films are guarded within the Graham company, in peril of obliteration by fire, flood, or destructive impulse.

us,"The Screen: 'Papillon':Escapist Film Stars McQueen, Hoffman","""Papillon,"" Franklin J. Schaffner's film version of the late Henri Charrire's book about his adventures in various penal colonies in French Guiana, is a big, brave, stouthearted, sometimes romantic, sometimes silly melodrama with the kind of visual sweep you don't often find in movies anymore.Mr. Schaffner, the director of ""Patton"" and ""Nicholas and Alexandra,"" looks to be the last of the big-time spenders. When he decides to show us a cargo ship steaming into a Caribbean port, that's what we see, in one magnificent long shot that includes the ship, the quay, the river, the jungles on the other side of the river and the sea in the distance.""Papillon,"" which opened yesterday at Loews State I, the Cine and the Tower East Theaters, is full of such long shots, some of great beauty and all of obvious expense.Though they aren't always necessary and though they give you the feeling the film was shot mostly from a Goodyear blimp, they recall an old-fashioned narrative style to which I'm partial, the kind that seeks to authenticate character and event by telling us a lot more about geography, climate weather, plant life and architecture than we absolutely need know.The movie equivalent is the long shot. It fills the screen with information designed to convince us that because the setting is real, so must be the people in it. ""Papillon"" desperately needs this sort of support because the Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr. screenplay, like the book, defines its characters less in terms of what they feel or think than in terms of extravagant incidents and superhuman heroics.""Papillon,"" the French word for butterfly, which was Charrire's nickname in the Paris underworld, is presented as an honorable safecracker dishonorably framed for the murder of a smalltime pimp and thus sentenced to life in the penal colony in 1931. As played by Steve McQueen, Papillon is as all-American as a Rover Boy. He is manly, alert, self-reliant, deeply imbued with a sense of fair play. His love of freedom is so great that he must attempt the impossible, that is, to escape from Devil's Island.His best friend is Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman), convicted for counterfeiting government bonds, a fastidious, fussy man with bad eyesight and enough money to buy Papillon as his prison bodyguard. Hoffman is not especially convincing as a French counterfeiter, but he is fun to watch as an intelligent character as written.There are dozens of other characters in the story, all more or less obligatory to a Devil's Island adventurethe cruel guard, the doomed prisoner (he prefers death to incarceration), the philosophical doctor, the perverted trustee (in other films he's sometimes presented as a male nurse). The horrors of prison life are graphically shown (including a decapitation that results in blood spurting onto the lens of the camera), cockroaches eaten to supplement the prison diet, storms at sea and a hand-to-hand encounter with a crocodile.My tolerance for this kind of make-believe is fairly high. I like hairbreadth escapes and survivals against all odds, but I must admit that about three-quarters of the way through the two and a half hour of ""Papillon"" my tolerance was sorely tested.It happened when Papillon is befriended by a tribe of Central American Indians presided over by Chief Victor Jory. They inhabit what looks to be the West Indies' newest and most chic island resort and cabana colony and, to be hospitable, present him with his very own Dorothy Lamour, a maiden named Zoraima who is played by Ratna Assan.This finally establishes ""Papillon"" as the sort of movie Hollywood supposedly doesn't make any more. Though its native girls go topless and the production budget was huge, ""Papillon"" is the escapist movie we used to go see on Saturday night without even bothering to read the marquee.",1973-12-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Dustin Hoffman as an Italian:Germi 'Alfredo, Alfredo' Starts Run at Plaza The Cast Star Is a Bank Clerk Pursued by His Wife","Passive as a potato, timid as a fawn, Dustin Hoffman is cast as a victim once again in ""Alfredo, Alfredo,"" which opened yesterday at the Plaza Theater. Here, he has almost returned to his role in ""The Graduate"": the innocent manchild overwhelmed by a devouring woman. As an Italian bank clerk who's pursued, married and mangled by a beautiful hysteric, (Stefania Sandrelli), Mr. Hoffman plays the kind of character who can't even kick a stone in the road without injuring himself. Of course his marriage is a martyrdom, and divorce is as difficult as a Presidential impeachment.The main problem with this picture is that Pietro Germi, the director, has made it (brilliantly) twice before. His ""DivorceItalian Style"" and ""Seduced and Abandoned"" superbly satirized the cruelty of the Italian marital laws, before divorce became legal in that country. ""Alfredo"" is a rather diluted version of its predecessors: clearly, Mr. Germi has gone over the same material too often. The other problem is that Dustin Hoffman isn't Italian. Despite his efforts to tear into his food with a Latin gusto, or the slicked-down hair above the urban American face, he simply can't appear to be a native of a provincial Italian townany more than Dwight Eisenhower could have convinced us that he was a sleek Roman count.However, there are beguiling details throughout. Mr. Hoffman's small, cautious smiles, the way his mouth and nostrils quiver when he smells his detested wife's perfume, and her scalp-chilling screams at the moment of orgasmwhich alarm the neighbors and terrify the dog into fits of barkingall make for moments of fine farce. And it was a happy thought to have the couple's doctor prescribe sex two or three times a day, during the wife's most fertile hours; as Alfredo runs to and fro between his office and his home, he gets billows of guffaws from his colleagues. There's also a devastating scene when the wife's imaginary pregnancy is suddenly deflated.Stefania Sandrelli has a gift for sulking. But she overacts much of the time, and hence doesn't match her marvelous performances in Mr. Germi's earlier movies and in Bernard Bertolucci's ""The Conformist."" Also, ""Alfredo"" is weakened by some mossy male fantasies: the hero unfailingly inspires a tender sympathy in desirable women when they see him for the first time, and they always take the initiative in this picture. But that just isn't believable, since Mr. Hoffman is made to be too pathetic to rouse such attractions.So ""Alfredo"" hasn't the wit or the bitterness of Mr. Germi's best films; for this director, savagery seems essential to comedy. If he's mellowed, it's our loss. But this isn't a bad movie  it's merely a disappointment because of the immense talent involved.",1973-12-18T05:00:00+0000

The movie opened yesterday at the Columbia I and Embassy Theaters.James Caan is fine as the dopey sailor who makes the right decision (to settle down) at the wrong time (with the whore). The role is well-written by Darryl Ponicsan, who adapted his novel for the screen. Mr. Ponicsan can write funny dialogue but he has no head for events. Almost everything that happens in the film is unbelievable, designed for short-term audience effect of easy laughter or tears.Mr. Caan (""Brian's Song,"" ""The Godfather"") seems to be shaping up as the Paul Newman of the nineteen-seventies, an intelligent, versatile actor with a low-key but unmistakable public personality. Marcia Mason is also good as the wayward woman he marries, so good that you wish the script were equal to the complicated feelings that the actors every now and then manage to project.Mr. Rydell, the director and himself a good actor (""The Long Goodbye""), photographed the movie entirely in Seattle with lots of contrasts between obvious prettiness and dismal squalor, the kind of thing usually fancied by budding film makers. Kirk Calloway underplays the little boy, which is okay, and Eli Wallach overplays Mr. Caan's cashiered sailor-pal as if he were doing an impersonation in someone's living room.",1973-12-19T05:00:00+0000

Except for this curiously tame windupwhen things should have been poppingthis is highly engrossing science-fiction, a French-Czechoslovak co-production in animation.The technique itself is fascinating. Instead of using the traditional method of drawing on acetate, the ingenious producers have sketched on cut-out and hinged paper. This comparative stiffness of movement, instead of the usual animated flash, gives a dignity and eerie depth to an adaptation by directors Rene Laloux and Roland Topor of Stefan Wul's novel, ""Ome En Serie.""The story itself is a sci-fi honey, with tiny earthlings ""from a destroyed planet"" dominated as pets or outcasts by huge, robot-like rulers. This is somber, dead-earnest stuff. And when a Lilliputian revolution explodes, brilliantly evoked, the planet Ygam rocks.The settings and deep panorama, while Deliesque in form, are colored in subdued pastels. Even the English titles, to spoken French, provide an outer-space flavor.There is some inoffensive nudity and not one smidgen of humor, not even for Christmas. As for that ending, it simply seemed too tidy too soon. But for original, thoughtful, often strong (but tasteful) animation, I recommend ""Fantastic Planet"" for family viewing.The Roger Corman presentation, for New World Pictures, is at the 68th Street Playhouse.",1973-12-19T05:00:00+0000

The motion is slow. Drops of water change shape in airy suspension. The soundtrack heralds the event with the kind of aural splendor that accompanied the Dawn of Man sequence in Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""Then you notice something oddly, purposely deflating: the dolphin has an orange ball in its mouth.The leap that seemed to announce the dawn of the dolphin prompts, instead, memories of last winter's visit to Marineland. Performances every hour. Popcorn, peanuts, postcards and souvenirs.""The Day of the Dolphin,"" which opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld Theater, is no dawn-of-a-new-era fiction, nor was the original Robert Merle novel, though it was inspired to a large extent by the research of American scientists, including Dr. John C. Lilly, who spent years trying to teach dolphins how to speak English.Working (sometimes desperately) in several genres that are not their own, Mr. Nichols, one of America's most elegant directors of high comedy and low, and Buck Henry, his screenwriter, whose gift is for tumultuous satire (""Catch-22,"" ""Is There Sex After Death?""), have made a Flipper film for adults, a ""Day of the Jackal"" for kids and a Lassie film for scuba divers of all ages.There also are reminders of ""Born Free,"" ""Black Beauty,"" ""Frankenstein,"" and at least one of the sequels to ""Planet of the Apes."" ""The Day of the Dolphin"" is not a movie with much personality of its own.Unlike Dr. Lilly, who finally gave up his work on the grounds that it was cruel to take away the dolphins' freedom in the interests of research, the hero of ""The Day of the Dolphin"" pursues his experiments to their successful conclusion.Dr. Jake Teller (George C. Scott), the head of a privately funded research center near Miami, scores his breakthrough when he separates his 4-year-old male dolphin, nicknamed Fa, from Fa's mate, Bi. Exhausted after an all-day tantrum, Fa finally pokes his bottle-nose out of his tank and says, through his spiracle, in a tiny, plaintive sort of midget voice: ""Fa wants Bi.""Thereafter the film, which has quite charmingly followed the experiments with Fa and Bi, turns heavily to plot. Mysterious strangers appear at the research center to use Fa and Bi for their own evil purposes. The doctor ruminates about the meaning and morality of what he has wrought, while his wife, played by Trish Van Devere, tries to cheer him up.Some of the cloak-and-dagger stuff that follows is so awkwardly staged that it's difficult to know whether the simplicity was designed for youngsters or as parody.There are also times when the inter-species dialogues leave off being the dream of scientist and child come true and become the source of giggles. How can an actor like George C. Scott play a dramatic scene with a dolphin? No matter what he does, the dolphin is bound to untank him. Although the film is mostly played straight, in lovely, broad-horizoned seascapes, which, along with the dolphins, help reduce the actors to mere functions of the story, Mr. Nichols and Mr. Henry make their comic prances felt in a couple of key moments. One has to do with the film's climax and can't be reported.The other features that fine actress Elizabeth Wilson, in what is little more than a walk-on, as one of those executive secretaries who sees herself as the keeper of the flame. ""You must excuse us,"" she says to a visitor who has been kept waiting for five hours, ""but today was just one of those days."" Says the visitor: ""Which one?""",1973-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Effective 'Laughing Policeman':The Cast,"The continuing love affair between movie makers and a violent and photogenic San Francisco is exposed with fresh ardor by ""The Laughing Policeman,"" which came to the National and Beekman Theaters yesterday.Though an essentially familiar amalgam of murder, manhunt and dogged police work in that scenic city, this ""Policeman"" stands a good deal taller than the norm because of the expert guidance of Stuart Rosenberg, the producer-director. He is effectively aided by a fine script and a cast as convincing as a live cop or a dead gunman.The plot tends to be convoluted from its lengthy opening sequence, in which all the passengers of a bus, including a detective, are massacred by a mysterious machine-gunner. A confusion of other corpses and a gory shootout help cloud the proceedings.But Walter Matthau, as the veteran plainclothesman whose partner was slain; Bruce Dern, his new partner, and their teammates not only provide meticulous expertise in tracing the killer, but also reveal themselves and their views of rough jobs.Credit much of the film's flavor and insights to Thomas Rickman's adaptation of the novel by the Swedish husband-and-wife team of Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall. This script captures the character and the earthy, germane vernacular, four-letter and otherwise, of the police, street people, blacks, prostitutes and pimps of San Francisco that substitutes for the book's Stockholm.Mr. Matthau gives an underplayed and forceful portrayal of the taciturn, gum-chewing sleuth frustrated by a lack of motives for the seemingly unrelated slayings, who turns to a previous, unsolved murder to unearth the killer. It is in keeping with his old-timer's dedication to a plodding and dangerous job that makes him a stranger to his wife and kids. Mr. Dern's delineation as his cynical sidekick, who occasionally messes up procedures with hard-nosed tactics, is equally strong and natural.The film juxtaposes police practices and points of view in varied vignettes, from Anthony Zerbe's characterization of the harassed lieutenant yelling for results to Lou Gossett's black detective who realy knows his black suspects and can handle them. And a number of bit performances, including actual police squads and a team of emergency-room doctors, lend vivid local color and authenticity to an engrossing and adult crime caper.",1973-12-21T05:00:00+0000

They take their kids to the dentist. They play basketball. They probably drink beer as they sit in front of their TV sets watching the Sunday afternoon games. On duty they are the kind of guys who beat up suspects with short lengths of hose. They break and enter without warrants. They torture a dying gangster in his hospital bed, and they shoot first, usually to kill, so there are no questions to ask afterward.""The Seven-Ups,"" the first film to be directed by Phil D'Antoni, the man who produced ""The French Connection,"" is a vicious, mechanical, clumsy thriller. It mindlessly uses the violence that in ""The French Connection"" could be seen as a manifestation of general urban rot. ""The Seven-Ups"" has no such thoughts in its head. It treats its vigilante cops with respect, not because of anything they might feel or believe in, but because of what they can do. The characters have even less individuality than performing bears.The cast includes Roy Scheider, the co-star of ""The French Connection,"" as the head of the Seven-Ups team, and Tony Lo Bianco, who was so good in ""The Honeymoon Killers,"" as a young mortician whose funeral parlor is favored by the mob.

The vengeance sought by a sheriff whose family has been slaughtered by an inept but bestial gang of bank robbers results simply in fireworks and gore and little more.What the producers had in mind is difficult to discern from the foggy and arty, if explosive, action. Samuel Fuller, already adored by his own cult followers, reportedly began directing ""The Deadly Trackers"" from his story ""Riata"" and then was replaced by Barry Shear. But despite any credits or disclaimers, the sum total here appears to be, at best, a distressingly chaotic adventure.Richard Harris, who gives the appearance of a Pilgrim ascetic with an unlikely brogue as the once peace-loving but now vengeful lawman, is given to musings, fumblings, gesturing and occasional ranting on his long trek down to Mexico to mow down the slayers of his wife and young son. Rod Taylor, as the outlaw chief, is vague and bland about the bloody business he's in, except for the climactic moments when he suddenly displays unexpected tenderness toward his illegitmate little daughter who is caught up in the final, fatal shootout in a Mexican convent.Al Lettieri is mostly befuddled as the pudgy Mexican sheriff, also tracking the killers and occasionally tangling with our hero, who is dispatched, along with Taylor, in that convent. The outlaws are simply simple-minded assassins who deserve their bloodbaths.In bemoaning his wife's death, Richard Harris dolefully intones, ""They've shot the roses from her checks.""

us,"Jimi Hendrix, the Man and the Singer, Documented:The Program","The producers of ""Jimi Hendrix,"" which opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and West, have avoided the temptation to turn a hearse into a bandwagon. This documentary, about the rock star who died at 27 from an overdose of barbiturates, combines fragments of interviews with Mr. Hendrix's father, friends and acquaintances, with chunks of his performances at the Monterey Pop Festival, Woodstock, the Isle of Wight and others  without attempting a necrological high.Mr. Hendrix's famous guitar-burning sequenceswhen he beckons the rising flames with encouraging fingers  are interspersed with the moments when he plucked the strings with his teeth or smashed the instrument, glimpses of him in flagrante delicto with an amplifier, the exhalation of ""Sssock it to me"" and his parody of the national anthem. Throughout, the reminiscences are fond, reflective, rather gentle. His father recalls him strumming a broom as if it were a guitar; Little Richard says, ""At times' he used to make my big toe shoot up in my boot,"" and several pronounce him shy. Early on, his admiration for Bob Dylan is underlined, and he sometimes appears like a black Mick Jagger. Later, he reminds you of no one.Despite every success, he seems to have fallen between stools: An American who depended on England for his first major recognition, a black man who worried about his black friends' opinion of his music. We're told that black radio stations were at first reluctant to play his recordings, stating that his style did not ""relate,"" while white stations thought it too rugged. The conflicts mount steadily. Decked in the ruffled shirts and sequined boleros and jeweled headbands, he said that he didn't care what the public thought. But the friends stress that being conspicuous troubled him. Some think that he wanted to shed his spectacular act and ""just get people to listen to the music.""While the ravages of promotion and the isolation of stardom are evoked, as well as ""the load of leeches"" that fed on him, one young woman says that Mr. Hendrix was no more self-destructive than a passenger on a plane that crashes. That image lingers. Yet it's difficult to weigh, since his black friends feel that he had ""a fast fuse""a sense shared with many black people that life wouldn't be long, that it was likely to burn out quickly. While this movie doesn't tell us quite enough about Jimi Hendrix the musician, it does convey some of the talent and the anguish and the exuberance that were there.",1973-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'A King in New York' at Last:The Cast,"He springs to his feet with an incredibly straight back, as though he had swallowed a telescope; in a noisy restaurant, he mimes his order to the waiter who can't hear him: a pop-eyed swimming fish for caviar, a scuttling turtle for turtle soup. Discussing dentistry at an elegant dinner party, he ties a napkin over a fat woman's bosom and fills her mouth with knives and sugar tongs. In an elevator, he thoughtfully slides his finger into the nozzle of a fire extinguisher, becomes wonderfully entangled in the loops of hose, runs off with yards of it trailing behind him and ends by soaking the judge who is investigating him as a Communist conspirator. The choicest moments pass very quickly, simply because Chaplin's best jokes were always sudden: it's the pratfall we don't foresee, or the lunge of improvisation, that reveal his genius.""A King in New York,"" which opened yesterday at the Playboy Theater, was an effort to satirize McCarthyism. It was released in Europe in 1957, when Chaplin was 68. In 1952, when he was traveling abroad, the United States Attorney General stated that Chaplin (a British subject) would not be allowed to return to America without a hearing on charges of ""moral turpitude and Communist sympathies."" Chaplin stayed away, often repeating that he was not a Communist, but ""an internationalist, a peacemonger."" In 1956, he said that he wasn't interested in offering ""A King in New York"" for the American market. Now, we're able to see it for the first time.Chaplin plays the ex-king of a nameless country, who lost his throne because he opposed nuclear weapons and planned to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Hurtling to Manhattan for sanctuary, he soon discovers that America is insane. Conventional shots of skyscrapers and jostling crowds inform us of our inhumanity. It's revealed that our movies are brutal, our commercials crass and that people have to do humiliating things for money.Clearly, Chaplin loved playing king. Here, as in some of his other pictures, he seems to be in awe of the rich and the class system, even though he has often derided both. But the camera ogles opulence. (As his autobiography shows, it was ironic that a man who loved money and property so deeply should have been accused of communism.) His king has little in common with the legendary tramp, except for the occasional wriggling shrug that accompanies the raised eyebrows and the nervous toothy grin. He tries to make this aristocrat seem angelic, almost saintlywhich makes for some embarrassing moments.The king has a brief skirmish with a young woman in advertising, played with relentless perkiness by Dawn Addams. He then gets involved with a child prodigy whose parents are former Communists; they're jailed for refusing to give names. The boy (acted by Chaplin's son Michael, then 11) has to appear as a tiny demagogue, spouting Marx while the indignant king attempts to argue or interrupt. Meanwhile, the rhetoric rises to a denunciation of all forms of government.Chaplin crammed his own views between the boy's jawsand deliberately made them sound foolish. The result is a failed farce. Caricaturing the child as a semi-monster hardly strikes a blow for liberalism. Actually, the result is oddly reactionary, since the anti-McCarthy mouthpiece is forced to be absurd. And some sticky spurts of pathos increase the political confusion. Finally, the boy turns informer in order to get his parents out of prison, and he becomes a shattered, weeping wreck. The king, like Chaplin, leaves America.Despite Chaplin's denials, this is a very bitter filmand why should it be otherwise? We can applaud his anger, and it's easier than ever to sympathize with characters grown cautious about what they say over the phone, who worry that their rooms are bugged or sense that they're about to be subpenaed. However, the great man botched his own political arguments, and this movie sags below the rest of his work.Yet, it's important to see ""A King in New York"": it brings back the bad old days. And the fact that even Chaplin couldn't make guilt by association funny is crucial to our past and present history.",1973-12-22T05:00:00+0000

The book is clearly a witty, affectionate sendup of the adventureyarn form, which Goldman (as the screenwriter for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) obviously loves and knows how to manipulate with enormous skill. You could say that it's the novelistic equivalent of Sandy Wilson poking fun, in The Boy Friend, at his equally obviously adored twenties musical comedies  except that Goldman goes even further. He has set up the story with an intro telling how as a boy, he loved having his father read him the alleged S. Morgenstern classic, but that when he himself gave the book to his 10  year  old son, the kid stopped reading after an early chapter. Goldman goes on to say that he then actually read the book for the first time and found that his father, in reading aloud to him, had simply and wisely skipped or telescoped the boring parts, hence this good parts version abridged by Goldman. He keeps breaking up the narrative with redinked passages, explaining what he's cut here and why.

us,Screen: 'Magnum Force':Police Story Is Sequel to 'Dirty Harry' The Cast,"Let's hear it for hypocrisyor at least, for our old national tradition of hypocrisy refined. Before World War I, sexy scenes were fine onstage as long as they occurred in biblical shows; later, Cecil B. DeMille exploited the same formula in movies. Now, we can enjoy the lushest baths of violence on the screen in the name of law and order. Of course the principle is ancient. Yet it gains more sophistication with each decade.Yesterday's Christmas package, ""Magnum Force,"" which was unwrapped at the Criterion Theater and the 86th Street East, is a sequel to ""Dirty Harry."" Harry (Clint Eastwood) is the policeman who kills to protect the public from guns other than his own. The movie is a muddle of morality. ""Somebody is trying to put the courts out of business"" by rubbing out corrupt labor leaders, racketeers, and narcotics tycoonsthe scum that flourishes in a liberal society where the courts fail to prosecute them. However, righteous policemen who kill ""hoodlums"" are ""crucified by those young bastards at the D.A.'s office."" Follow that verb.Harry discovers that there's an execution squad within the police department. Hence it's his duty to bump off five policemen who are equally keen on liquidating him. (After a red herring slightly larger than a sperm whale, and music that precedes each killing with all the subtlety of the Valkyries' entrance theme, no audience is going to swoon with astonishment.)Throughout, there's a stress on dear old hubris: Harry earnestly repeats that ""a man't got to know his limitations."" Thus, it's reasoned that the killings he commits are justified  ""There's nothing wrong with shooting, as long as the right people get shot""  but murderers do have to be discriminating.Since the Supreme Court ruling on obscenity, we've seen a predictable acceleration of violence as a substitute for sex. There's little joy between the sheets in ""Magnum Force."" But bullets in bare breasts are still acceptable. Topless murderees in a swimming pool or nudes stoned at ""$900 an ounce"" reinforce the morality: people who take off their clothes may have been asking for it. There's also a gratuitous murder of a prostitute, climaxed with a shot of her killer's face grinning through her spread legs.Young men who hold up a store have ""hippy-looking hair"" and some skyjackers resemble folk singers. The police lieutenant who warns against brutality (Hal Holbrook, behaving rather like a petulant professor of humanities), turns out to be the most demonic death-dealer of all. Still, the movie strains for some liberal seasoning Harry's partner is black, and some young policemen suspected of oddness are defended for their talents: Harry says, ""If the rest of you could shoot like them, I wouldn't care if the whole damn department was queer.""Mr. Eastwood's unshakable coolas he dismantles a bomb or refuses a local anesthetic for seven stitchesmakes me miss Richard Widmark's style in playing this kind of part. Mr. Widmark's eyes, which appeared to have been drilled into his head, often looked appalledeven frightened or franticin a desperate situation. But all that Mr. Eastwood can manage is a frown that suggests tension. The excitement is mainly in the camerawork, which is stunningthe sense of motion in space, as cars bowl over bridges or a helicopter rises, lends an exhilaration that's absent from the script.You may pause before hastening your children off to this movie. But certainly policemen shouldn't see it. The picture merely thickens the soup of confusion about their role. However, ""Magnum Force"" might be interesting for caterers. Harry asserts that San Francisco airport ""has the greatest burgers in town""  and that's a mystery which is never fully unraveled.",1973-12-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Film:1930's Confidence Men Are Heroes of 'Sting',"""The Sting,"" which opened yesterday at Loew's State 2 and other theaters, re-teams the director (George Roy Hill) and stars (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" in a comedy about a couple of exuberant confidence men operating in and around Chicago in 1936.""The Sting"" looks and sounds like a musical comedy from which the songs have been removed, leaving only a background score of old-fashioned, toe-tapping piano rags that as easily evoke the pre-World War I teens as the nineteen-thirties.A lot of the other period details aren't too firmly anchored in time, but the film is so good-natured, so obviously aware of everything it's up to, even its own picturesque frauds, that I opt to go along with it. One forgives its unrelenting efforts to charm, if only because ""The Sting"" itself is a kind of con game, devoid of the poetic aspirations that weighed down ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.""Mr. Newman and Mr. Redford, dressed in best, fit-to-kill, snap-brim hat, thirties spendor, looking like a couple of guys in old Arrow shirt ads, are more or less reprising their roles in ""Butch Cassidy.""Mr. Newman is Henry Gondoroff, the older con artist in charge of the instruction of Johnny Hooker (Mr. Redford), the bright, eager, younger man who yearns to make what the movie calls the Big Con (swindle), the way tap dancers in the movies about the twenties wanted to play the Palace.Their quarry is a ruthless, vain, fastidious New York racketeer named Doyle Lonnegan, played by Robert Shaw in the broad manner in which the film was conceived by David S. Ward, who wrote the screenplay, and realized by Mr. Hill.The director supplements the period sets and costumes with elaborate technical devices to move from one scene into another: wipes, iris-outs, images that turn like pages. Separating sequences are title cards that recall Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post covers. It's all a little too much, but excess is an essential part of the film's style.""The Sting"" has a conventional narrative, with a conventional beginning, middle and end, but what one remembers are the set pieces of the sort that can make a slapped-together Broadway show so entertaining. These include a hilarious, thoroughly crooked poker game on the Twentieth Century Limited in which Henry blows his nose on his tie to the horror of Lonnegan, as well as a chase that lasts approximately two minutes, and the final swindle, the mechanics of which are still none too clear to me.The only woman with a substantial role in the film is Eileen Brennan, who plays a madam with a heart of gold and enough time off to be able to assist the stars in the final con. ""The Sting"" is not the kind of film that takes its women very seriously, and the continuing popularity of these male-male co-starring teams should, I suppose, probably prompt some solemn analysis.It is not, I suspect, a terrible perversion of the romantic movie-team concept idealized by William Powell and Myrna Loy, Clark Gable and Lana Turner but, rather, a variation on the old Dr. Gillespie-Dr. Kildare relationship, with a bit of Laurel and Hardy thrown in. It is also apparently very good box office.",1973-12-26T05:00:00+0000

Mooning over what's bygone hardly stimulates the mental musclesinstead, it tends to stiffen the perceptions, to swell the spiritual flab. But time-traveling is very good exercise. When you're required to weave back and forth between the past and present, to study what has and hasn't changed, the consciousness can be limbered, clarified. D. A. Pennebaker's ""Keep On Rockin' "" affords us some excellent time-traveling, since it recreates the September, 1969, Toronto Rock and Roll Revival. At that festival, the music of the mid-nineteen-fifties captivated an Aquarian audiencejust midway in time between Woodstock and Altamont.This fine documentarythe first of the First Avenue Screening Room's program of pictures that haven't received adequate attentionwill appear tomorrow and Saturday. The movie is prefaced by some footage of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix: two ghostly guides to the musical past that preceded them. Then we're pitched into 1955 and 1956, with the swamp rhythms of Bo Diddley and the rockabilly of Jerrry Lee Lewis, who tells his fans, ""Ah love yew like a hawg loves slop."" We're back in an era when the guitar was handled tenderly, rather than set afire, and it's a shock to see a short-haired violinist in a tie.Chuck Berry's mournful, worn face splits with smiles as he lets loose with ""Sweet Little Sixteen."" Lights spring off Little Richard's mirrored tunic as he crows, screams and unleashes some falsetto whoops before he zeros in on ""Tutti Frutti."" His body glistens with sweat as he strips and hurls his garments to the crowd, holding up each garment like a teasing auctioneer.Rock songs in praise of rock, lines about having fun tonight: The fact and the act of rockin 'n' rollin' emerge as the prime theme of these lyrics. To an ear that was later formed by Bob Dylan, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, most of the music is far too repetitive to be exciting. But it's a pleasure to watch these seasoned professionals, whose energy equals their experience. Their songs show that they came from a time when people wanted extremely simple things. This is solid, reliable stuffit seems unlikely that listeners could use it to summon any kind of high. Hence, it's intriguing that the very young (also very white) audience of 1969 was delighted by this blast from the past.Mr. Pennebaker's film is an anthology of smiles: again and again, the camera closes in on beaming faces. (Sometimes, he begins with a dancing torso, or a pair of thighs and kneeswe meet the head a few moments later.) We can't really tell if the film maker looked for innocence and stressed it, or if that was the over-all character of the crowd. But no one on screen looks druggy, most of the skin is fresh and clear, and there's even a flash of shaved armpits. Did the music of the fifties attract a rather sheltered audience in the late sixties? Or was this an early sign that some were eagerly retreating from the turbulence of that period?Mr. Pennebaker, whose movies include ""Monterey Pop"" (1968) and ""Don't Look Back"" (Bob Dylan in 1965), both produced with Richard Leacock, is a specialist in observing changes. So we trust his instinct and his eye. And this film shows a sensitivity to individuals that some rock moviessuch as ""Woodstock""lacked. Just when the press was awash with theories about death trips and the counter culture, Mr. Pennebaker witnessed something entirely different. And his work does tend toward prescienceto record what will be important before most of the public is aware of it.",1973-12-27T05:00:00+0000

As he searches for a receiver, the opposing quarterback has only two or three seconds to solve the puzzle of where to throw. If he takes too long, he often is sacked. If he hurries, he often is intercepted. The No Name defense of the Dolphins is a misnomer. It should be the No Mercy defense, particularly on passers trying to solve the puzzle for the first time.

It's the seventh annual New Year's Eve party in Central Park, at Bethesda Fountain and on the Mall near East 72d Street. The party starts at 10:30 P.M. with a parade, the accent being on the nineteenthirties and forties, and continues with movies, dancing to a Latin band and fireworks at midnight. Balloons are free, and you can buy hot chocolate or coffeebut no wassail bowl. Making the scene at the Metropolitan Opera is something of a tradition on the last night of the old year, but, again, there's an alternative that would provide a nice change of pace. Try the Amato Opera, which at 319 Bowery is in a considerably less glamorous setting than the Met. The Amato is a tiny place that has been presenting opera at low prices for many years, with a piano and one or two other pieces making the music. The New Year's Eve program offers La Boheme, followed by a homecooked buffet supper and, after midnight, much toasting and dancing, for $25 a couple. Reservations are necessary; call 2288200. If you want to avoid the crowds, try the top of the Empire State Building (Fifth Avenue and 34th Street). The observation roof closes at 11:30, leaving you enough time to rush off somewhere to get caught up in the brash spirit of the occasion. Or take a Staten Island Ferry ride (round trip: 10 cents) on which you'll hear the ships moored in the harbor tooting away as 1974 is born.",1973-12-30T05:00:00+0000

The film, using old home movie footage, covers his childhood in a happy, wealthy Minnesota home and then shifts to his later avant-garde filming.There is an endearing freshness to all this. A director, composer and painter, Mr. Hill outlines the course of his career in a simple, crystal-clear narrative. He loved the camera, we sense, as a wonderful toy of unlimited possibilities.In spite of the acclaim his more conventional documentaries on Albert Schweitzer and Grandma Moses have received, this last work of his may turn out to be the most impressive of his efforts. Everything here flows steadily, skillfully and pointedly, starting with his evocative chapter on his early life in St. Paul, which imaginatively blends photographs, animated stills and color that has the quality of Tiffany glass.Then as a wealthy young American roaming Europe in the nineteen-twenties, Mr. Hill slips behind the camera and remains therea determined independent movie-maker, influenced by Dreyer, Melies and other pioneers. The Cocteau influence is obvious as we see in a runoff of his 1930 short, ""Fortune Teller,"" in a flickering print.Toward the end, the film dissolves kaleidoscopically within the image of a movie-ola as the spry, aging Mr. Hill demonstrates the vital role of editing (""alchemy"") in his laboratory. These scenes were made shortly before his death.""Every artist lends his own eyes to the audience,"" he muses, splicing a strip of negative. As an art form taking advantage of the machine, Mr. Hill tells us, ""cinema was born just in time."" He adds his credo: ""A miracle is around every corner.""
