Actors who play well-known figures have their work cut out for them: They have to create a compelling performance that also rings true for audiences who are familiar with the person theyre playing. Now, imagine doing that with the actual famous person also onstage. That was the tall order given to Christine Lahti, who plays Gloria Steinem in this biographical play. Written by Emily Mann and directed by Diane Paulus, Gloria: A Life follows a familiar biographical formula in its first portion, which stages many steps of Steinems career  including her involvement with the womens movement and in the creation of Ms. magazine. But in the shows second part, Steinem herself steps onstage, and moderates a discussion with audience members about what theyve just seen. Both parts are in this recording of the play, which was shot during a live performance. In his review for The New York Times, Jesse Green wrote that the play would make a useful introduction to the feminist trailblazer for those who know little about her remarkable overlapping careers as a journalist, activist and wandering organizer for the revolution. But he added that it does not have much new to add for audiences familiar with Steinems story.",2020-07-01T05:00:09+0000

The daughter of the presidents older brother, Freddy, who died in 1981, now shares some of hers  not just by airing the familys dirty laundry, but by washing and folding it, too. (Mary Trump is a clinical psychologist whose diagnoses for her uncle are as varied and extensive as the fast food buffet he offered the Clemson Tigers when they visited the White House in 2019.)",2020-07-08T20:05:19+0000

A couple decades later, they captured outlaws in more claustrophobic surroundings with Once Upon a Time in America, a mob movie set in New Yorks Lower East Side. The plot tracks the growth of two gangsters (played as adults by Robert De Niro and James Woods) and a budding Broadway dancer (Elizabeth McGovern). It stretches over several decades  parts of the story take place in 1922, 1933 and 1968  an epic expanse that was infamously cut to under two and a half hours when the film was shown in North American theaters.

We see Jaspers boarding school days in the 1950s melting into his infancy; his fathers wedding in the 1930s segueing into the elder de Zoets childhood adventures with a kite; scenes from the Boer War (a bloody, stupid mess) dissolving into images of horse-drawn carriages; then colonial plantations in Java, Dutch East India Company ships sailing into Japanese waters; finally a trading post, a monastery, a room filled with corpses.

In one of her best-known early works, Self-Portrait/Cutting (1993), her naked back is carved with a still-bleeding childlike drawing of a home, two women stick-figures in the foreground. That image, now in the Guggenheims permanent collection, nods to the queer B.D.S.M. scene in which Opie found community in the 90s, while capturing the painful longing she felt for a family of her own. Queer domesticity was a radical thing to envision at the time, but three decades later, the pandemic has confined Opie to the Los Angeles home she now shares with her wife, Julie Burleigh, and their 18-year-old son, Oliver. Their daughter, Sara, whom Julie had when she was young, and their 6-year-old grandson, Joaquin, visit often, though for the first few months of quarantine, even that was off-limits. The house has art scattered across the mantles and climbing up to the high ceilings, some of it from famous friends, and some, like the childrens drawings on the fridge, simply a reminder that once it arrives, family grows as unwieldy and resilient as the 90-year-old Aleppo pine tree in the yard.",2020-07-10T17:44:29+0000

The glamour wasnt wasted on Marant, but she had her own ideas. That era of 80s super-chic French fashion was really getting on my nerves, she says. By 10, I knew exactly what I wanted to wear, but it didnt exist in any shop. So she started making her own clothes, reworking her dads castoff dressing gowns, sweaters, vintage military fatigues and silk slippers. At one point she thought she might study economics or become a veterinarian, but her friends loved her creations and kept requesting versions for themselves. After studying fashion design at Pariss Studio Berot, Marant launched Twen, a knitwear and jersey line, with her mother in 1989. I was determined to work for myself, she says. Her eponymous label debuted five years later, with a collection of mens-wear-inspired overcoats and striped suits that drew from Indonesian batiks and ikats. Her credo was simple: Shed only design pieces she herself would wear. To this day, says Marant, 53, nothing leaves the workshop without me trying it on.",2020-07-16T19:29:22+0000

He then returns home following a serious injury, which requires his leg to be amputated below the knee.

From a distance, the tableau can seem an inspiring inflection point: the first Black major leaguer in the 20th century playing in the first televised World Series.

So far, so good: The safe narrative of Robinson-as-stoic-hero is intact. The band struck up the national anthem, he wrote. It should have been a glorious moment for me as the stirring words  poured from the stands. Yet if we see the scene through Robinsons eyes  and hear the anthem through his ears  we encounter an altogether different story. Writing a quarter of a century after the 1947 World Series, Robinson observed, I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a Black man in a white world.

That people like Young and Zazeela can still be found in TriBeCa in 2020 is nothing short of remarkable. Young is certainly the lone musician alive today who can claim to be no more than two degrees removed from three of the greatest icons of 20th-century modern music: Igor Stravinsky (who taught Robert Stevenson, the musicologist who was Youngs mentor in college), Charlie Parker (who played with the saxophonist Lee Konitz, with whom Young himself played as a session musician in Los Angeles) and Lou Reed (who co-founded the Velvet Underground with one of Youngs bandmates, John Cale). He is often considered the founder of minimalist music, having stripped composition down to its bare elements of rhythm, sound and tempo as early as the late 50s. His compositions can alternate between abrasive (the 30-minute-long Day of Niagara, recorded in 1965 with Zazeela, along with Cale and sometime Velvet Underground collaborators Tony Conrad and Angus MacLise, is a loud score that sounds not unlike an airplane engine and predated the noise rock of Reeds Metal Machine Music and other staples of early punk by about a decade) and hauntingly beautiful (such as 1958s Trio for Strings, a three-hour piece that effectively created the language of minimalist music through the use of sustained tones punctuated by brief gasps of silence). In the 1960s, he introduced generations of musicians to the concepts of drones and sustained repetition and began incorporating Indian classical music into his work, about five years before George Harrison had ever heard of the sitar.",2020-07-22T15:00:12+0000

It was in early May the next year, as soon as I saw the first returning swifts flowing down from the clouds, that I knew what I had to do.

us,Why Is There No Consensus About Reopening Schools?,"Is it possible to reopen school buildings in the fall in a way that keeps kids, educators, staff and their families and communities safe from Covid-19? Is it possible not to do so without harming them in other ways? Already, school closures have set children behind academically. More than 20 million children rely on school breakfasts and lunches. Too many parents face the choice between losing their jobs or leaving their children at home unsupervised. Vaccination rates for various dangerous diseases, typically required before students can attend school, have plummeted. Isolating children from their peers exacts social and emotional costs, which differ by age group and are nearly impossible to quantify. And whether schools reopen or remain closed, the risks are borne disproportionately by low-income communities and people of color. This is really one of the most perplexing and complex issues Ive ever faced in 40 years, says Dan M. Cooper, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Irvine.",2020-07-29T09:00:06+0000
