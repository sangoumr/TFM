us,Screen: 'Money Talks':Film by Allen Funt Is in Familiar Pattern,"""Money Talks,"" which opened Wednesday at neighborhood theaters, is Allen Funt's second movie in a format familiar to anyone who has seen his television show, ""Candid Camera."" It is an in-offensive, mostly innocuous film, and as such must represent a giant step up from ""What Do You Say to a Naked Lady,"" Funt's first movie, virtually an essay in the immortality of inviting people to make fools of themselves.It is also a film somewhat short of material, for although it is only 81 minutes long, it devotes conspicuous amounts of time to the image of Allen Funt enjoying his work and to a kind of thematic filler material: bowls of free money on the sidewalk; girls trailing clouds of money down a busy street.There is one potentially good interview(scene near the Harvard Yard; ""About your father's money  how can you keep taking it?"" ""Now, that's a really complicated question . . ."")but it doesn't go anywhere. And there is one distinctly pleasant sequence in which a man without money tap-dances for a bouquet of flowers, for his groceries, for a shoeshineand everyone seems to feel he's been well enough paid.Indeed, the distinctive feature of ""Money Talks,"" whether by accident or by the filmmaker's selection, is that almost nobody it deals with is very much obsessed with money. There are moments of petty cheatingon the level of a taxi driver's not turning on his meterbut there is much more personal honesty. Almost everybody returns to the pretty girl the bills that keep dropping from her coat pocket. I assume that they are small bills.""Money Talks"" avoids major temptations, just as it avoids extremes of poverty or wealth. Its rewards are a certain amount of temperate humor, a few middling insights and the inconsequence attendant on a small subject casually pursued.",1972-09-01T05:00:00+0000

Across from him sat Bobby Fischer, lolling back, gently swiveling to and fro, feet jigging in that nervous habit of his. But one day shortly after the match started Spassky, without any comment, was also using a Fischertype chair, a $500 (U.S.) black, leatherupholstered, chrometrimmed beauty flown in from New York courtesy of the manufacturer.

But it seems right when it is content to roam around the towns and highways of the West and Southwest, moving all but aimlessly toward what should have been a small-scale doom.The soldier boys in question are four veterans, Green Berets, who are discharged from the Army in Arkansas, jointly buy a big black second-hand Cadillac, and set off for California to start raising cattle on land that one of them is supposed to own, but that is in fact no more than a photograph on a picture postcard. Along the way they alternately victimize and are victimized.They pick up, use, and possibly kill a tough girl hitchhiker (they never bother to see what happens when she falls out of their speeding car). They visit one boy's home, and move on, growing more desperate, and poorer. Finally, out of money and out of gas, they erupt into violencetotally destroying a tiny New Mexico town that is all too obviously a surrogate Vietnamese villageand absurdly simplifying a movie that could have taken something better.Each of the boys has a certain edgy individuality, and their leader, Danny (Joe Don Baker) seems genuinely complex with his imposing slouch, his defiant eyes and mumbled speech. Indeed, I am not sure but that what impressed me most about him was my being unable to make out more than a third of his dialogueand feeling that all that inarticulate talk was an expressive part of a characterization.But it is as a road movie that ""Welcome Home, Soldier Boys"" really comes into its own. Five minutes here, 10 minutes there, motel scenes at night, or driving through the early morningscenes that don't finally co-here but that do stand out for a kind of lyricism and reticence and subtlety of observation. There is a quality of emptiness and random pathos to the film that is ultimately rather lovely, and that belongs as much to the spirit of American movie making as it does to the spirit of American life.This doesn't add up to a good movie, but it adds up to a sporadically interesting onein which the failure of the whole is no measure of some of the parts.",1972-09-09T05:00:00+0000

It is the same as that of Indians and white men in America and later of whites and blacks. The natives of Australia had the distinction of being the Indians and the blacks of their land. If the novel is authentic, and the facts do ring true, then the behavior of white men in Australia was simply a copy of our own: There was the same cultural blindness, the same indifference to the natives as human beings, the same arrogant use of brute strength. It was a downward spiral. They degraded and humiliated the natives, and then cited the condiwhich the natives ,lived as proof of native inferiority.

He ends that novel penned i,) in the madhouse, a fit place for a man of effects rather than causes. Alley was, and is in this last fiction, a victim of West's relentless appetite for novelty.

us,Film: 'Bewitched Love':Cadiz Is Background For Spanish Musical,"One problem with mounting poetic fantasy in film, a problem that essentially doesn't exist for live theater, is that the medium itself makes such strong claims upon its audience's belief in photographic reality.The problem plagued several of the more ambitiously imaginative American movie musicals of the 1940's and early 1950's. And to a degree it plagues ""Bewitched Love,"" a film loosely based on the ballet, and utilizing de Falla's popular music for, ""El Amor Brujo.""Candelas, the heroine of ""Bewitched Love,"" fears that her former lover, the evil Diego, is following her, even though she has seen him dead, killed in a fight. She has good reason to fear. Diego is not dead; he has dressed a body in his clothes and escaped to a hiding place from which he does pursue Candelas, hoping to win her back and take her away with him.He is opposed by Antonio, a shipyard worker, a good man, truly in love with Candelas. The drama of ""Bewitched Love"" develops mainly from the contest between Antonio's gentle love and Diego's bitter passion, with the tormented Candelas between them.It all sounds like a plot for ballet (which it partly is), with much emotion and not too much substance, but with good occasions for dancingof which there is some, but not enough. The cast, led by Antonio Gades, La Polaca, and Rafael De Cordova, does of course dancebut mostly in a few isolated set pieces. And except for one long and quite fine nightmare dream dance by Candelas, the film is at pains to make everything seem naturalistic.To a large degree this works. Aided by locations in Cadiz, a very picturesque old city wonderfully full of television antennas and littered streets, ""Bewitched Love"" achieves a kind of uneasy plausibility. But at the same time it seems to fall prey to its own commitment to filmed realitybegging, and not always finding, a poetry in dark twisted alleys and rain-soaked squares that are real enough, but also more neutral than a film of passionate feeling might care to allow.""Betwitched Love"" opened yesterday at the Cine 2.",1972-09-16T05:00:00+0000

He offers at once a strong, even hostile, statement about modern poetry (Literature has been in general decline for a very long time.) and a network of minute and interesting, most often sympa thetic, discriminations about Lowell's verse. The two disposi tions, naturally, do not always support one another; the critic's instinctsit's an old story lead him down more interesting garden paths than his narrower prescripts allow him. As far as principles are concerned, Cos grave judges that the best po etry is public poetry, and that Lowell, almost uniquely among modern poets, has been moving toward a mastery of it. By pub lic poetry he means verse which analyzes and assesses the es sential quality and characteris tics of the life of [its] time. So, Lowell burns to judge men and affairs against an immuta ble and objective standard.

After the war he returned to Japan, worked for the Occupation forces, and when the Korean conflict broke out volunteered to serve with an MP outfit as a kind of penance for having fought on the side of his coun try's enemy.

Held and others like him who are com mitted to modern design have had more difficulty gaining acceptance for their work than Italian designers (whose government takes an active in terest) or Scandinavians (who have a public predisposed to contemporary design). Held, however, seems to thrive on resistance. When he was 11, he ran messages for the World War II Re sistance. In 1964, he encountered an other sort of resistance when he opened a boutique for modern design called l'choppe. Everyone had ad vised against the venture. But he was vindicated. Parisians soon crowded into the tiny shop, which is well es tablished today. (Held chats with a passerby out front, right.) Unfortunately, the fight to popularize good de sign brought Held close to bankruptcy. He had to move into a lowincome housing project and dodge creditors for months. All to realize his vision: to search out new materials and shapes, to simplify construction and manufacturing, to bring modern design into everyone's reach by low ering costs. Typical of Held's simplify ing is his bed, which incorporates bed, night table and lamp in a single unit, and his chairs, which swivel and rock without any mechanism or moving parts. New design, he says, comes only from a new concept of function or a new technology. The beanbag chair is one of the few true innova tions in years. And what is France's role in the design of the future? After the neorusticism of Scandinavia and the Italian plastic fantasia, perhaps there is a need for French equilibrium, Held speculates confidently.",1972-09-17T05:00:00+0000

And it's an appreciation of yesteryear's classics, rather than nostalgia, that accounts for the return of the stalwart storm coat, the rugged lumberjack shirt, the flight jacket, the Navy peacoat. The whitegrounded peacoat on the cover takes on another rediscovered favorite, the lusty mackinaw plaid. The allwool coat is clovercollared, zippocketed, quiltlined.

Dulcima is earthy, a bit avaricious and essentially good. She doesn't mind a roll in the hayloft with Mr. Parker, but when she falls in love with the gamekeeper (Stuart Wilson), she decides to move out.Tragedy, as is its wont in this kind of fiction, strikes, rather like a bolt out of the ruddy old blue. And, as Dulcima has underestimated the depth of Mr. Parker's feelings, the movie is unequipped to support its melodramatic conclusion.""Dulcima,"" which opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East, has been written and directed by Frank Nesbitt as if he were covering something with a sugar glaze. The settings are pretty and the performances picturesque. Mr. Mills and Miss White seem to be having a high time of it, what with all of their frowning, looking puzzled, acting sly, winking, sliding into fearful tempers and out again.

There is only the difference that its young boxer (Fred Williamson) is both clean-cut and black, and therefore has certain problemsand, as everyone connected with it must be hoping, a certain appeal of his own.Neither passably good nor unspeakably awful, ""Hammer"" falls into the dullness that attends most routine movie projects these days, when the desire to make money remains, but nobody seems to remember how to do it gracefully. Sometimes the film looks like qualityespecially in the rhetoric of its fairly expert photography. And sometimes it looks like idiocyas in the plot device of the cop (Bernie Hamilton) who spends all his time hanging around with the crooks (except for Fred Williamson, virtually everybody else) telling them that they are doing wrong.""Hammer"" was made on location in Los Angeles, in and out of black neighborhoods, and its one potentially interesting aspect is an active and fairly intricate appreciation of lowlife types and stereotypes. Thus all my favorite people are very minor, like Mawama Davis, in a fine performance as a loudmouth whore who isn't good enough for Hammer. Or they are rats, like the stone-faced sadist (William Smith) who does all the syndicate's important murders. Or they are slobs, like the boss's girl, Rhoda (Elizabeth Harding), who serves as a reminder of white earthiness to set against the black gentility of the heroine (Vonetta McGee).Bruce Clark, who directed ""Hammer,"" is a young New Zealander with a masters degree from U.C.L.A. and two exploitation films to his credit. With such a background I was hoping for lots of real-life passion.

us,"' Hickey and Boggs,' a Tale of Chasing and Carnage","Although they've clicked as the supercool, funny and compatible black-white team of international sleuths in TV's ""I Spy"" series, Bill Cosby and Robert Culp are a good deal less convincing as the seedy titular private eyes of ""Hickey and Boggs,"" which landed at the Victoria and other houses yesterday. And while Robert Culp, who is also making his directiorial debut with this caper, shows a flair for action and eye-catching composition in sordid and serene views of Los Angeles where all the shooting takes place, ""Hickey and Boggs"" is not involved in a story or with characters really worthy of a full theatrical treatment.Let's say, that Walter Hill, a newcomer to the screen, has written a script that's long on complexity and short on character definition as a seeming legion of bigshot mobsters, gunmen, cops, fences and our shamuses chase a cache of $400,000 stolen from a Pittsburgh bank and held by some harried Chicanos.As a detective thriller, ""Hickey and Boggs"" has the swift pace necessary for the genre. And, under Mr. Culp's guidance and the use of adept cross-cutting there are a few fairly exciting shots including some shootouts at the Los Angeles Coliseum and the Dodger Stadium and enough corpses to satisfy the bloodstirsty. And L.A.'s sleazy sidestreets and saloons get as much edifying attention as the scenic beach areas.As antiheroes, both Mr. Culp and Mr. Cosby are serious, sullen and extremely laconic. Terse passes at dialogue merely indicate their personal relationships and their concommittant, bloody, thankless mission. A viewer simply isn't given time or reason to be caught up with Rosalind Cash, as Mr. Cosby's estranged wife, who is killed by gunmen, or Mr. Culp's ex-wife, a go-go dancer who is driving him to drink.Understatement is obviously the keynote here but ""Hickey and Boggs"" still owes us a fuller explanation despite all the chasing and carnage.",1972-09-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Hope Is Kept Busy in 'Cancel My Reservation',"Movies like ""Cancel My Reservation,"" which opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, aren't made; they are manufactured. They are processed, really, to a certain bland level of no taste and low expectationwhich they probably serve well enough, and make their money. If, like ""Cancel My Reservation,"" they are comedies, their aim is not to produce laughter but rather to fabricate the conditions under which you are supposed to laugh. For some audiences that seems to be enough.""Cancel My Reservation"" is adventure comedyor, more accurately, murder comedy, in which Bob Hope, as a big-time Eastern TV personality, has to prove his innocence to a small-town Arizona sheriff (Keenan Wynn) and at the same time patch up his marriage (to Eva Marie Saint) and solve a mystery so as to save his own life. It is an exceptionally busy movie, with more action than insight, and a method of exposition that seems to consist mainly of voice-over wisecracks.Hope's comedy has always depended a good deal on its topicality, and ""Cancel My Reservation"" is not without its topics. These include Indian rights, which it favors; women's liberation, which it does not; and sex, about which it displays a fairly nervous ambivalence. Perhaps so as not to outpace even the dullest audience, or perhaps because there were no good writers present, the topics are all dreadfully safe and sadly predictable. It isn't that the gags fail. They don't even tryunless you consider yet another crack about Crosby's golf game to be trying.It is ungenerous to say so, but I think the real topicunexpressed  is how old everyone has gotten. At 68, Bob Hope lacks the youthful bloom of the 42-year-old he is supposed to play. And the inability of the Hope persona to accommodate an old man's range of comedy, which can be very funny and very beautiful, is a much more serious cause of failure than the silly plot or the uninspired jokes that clutter the film. Age keeps cropping up, mostly as a source of embarrassment, but there is no way of accepting it, or even openly recognizing itand for all its mild pretensions, ""Cancel My Reservation"" emerges as a kind of scandalous indulgence.",1972-09-22T05:00:00+0000

These activities, Roszak argued, amount to a distinct and separate culture, whose dense con sistency is of an opposition to the culture of white, western masculinity, its idolatry of science, and the scurrilous, positivistic atheism of its Marxist sibling rivals. The counter culture, like any other, has its own history, heroes, values, villains, crafts, styles and rationales, all of which Roszak was able to fit more or less together as something un mistakably there, whether one liked it or not.

Besides being the reputed burial place of Arthur and Guine vere, it is close to South Cadbury (the site of the Camelot Research Committee's archeological digs), and about an hour's drive from Badbury Rings, Dorset, where Arthur is said to have defeated the barbarian invaders. Win chester, which also figures promi nently in the Knights of the Round Table mystique, is about 65 miles southeast of Glastonbury. From Glastonbury to Tintagel on the north Cornish coast, which some think was Arthur's birth place, is roughly 100 miles. And from Tintagel, which is situated in an area much favored by English tourists, drivers can cross the Cornish Peninsula to Fowey, a south coast resort, and the nearby Castle Dore, which is also associ ated with the Arthurian Age.

us,"' The Emigrants,' a Swedish Film Epic, Lands Here","Jan Troell's ""The Emigrants,"" a big, long, carefully detailed Swedish film about Swedish emigration to America in the middle of the 19th century, is an example of a type of drama much more common to the stage, especially to the regional stage, than to film. Although its characters are peasants rather than great personages, it is, at heart, a historical pageant of the sort you might expect to encounter at Colonial Williamsburg or Roanoke Island in midsummer.As such, it celebrates in deliberately simplified ways heroism, faith, fortitude, goals achieved and lives concluded that counted for something.Historical pageants can comprehend wars, earthquakes, tidal waves, famines, epidemics, reversals of fortune and even rotten luck. They aren't interested in failure, in the lot of the loser, in those who don't measure up, in lives forever in transit, in the contemplation of loss and futility.The pageant may not necessarily be a lesser form of theater or cinema, but because its purpose is so unequivocally affirmative, it tends, like socialist art, to be without surprise. It also tends to carry itself with a certain air of smugness, as do passengers disembarking from a capacity-stuffed 747 after an especially harrowing flight.All of these thoughts are inspired by ""The Emigrants,"" which Mr. Troell, the young director, adapted from the novels of Vilhelm Moberg, with Bengt Forslund, the director's collaborator on the script of his first feature, ""Here's Your Life,"" released here in 1968.""The Emigrants"" is a stately, pictorially romantic chronicle of the lives of a small group of peasants for whom existence at home becomes so tenuous that emigration seems the only solution.There are Karl Oskar (Max von Sydow), a tough, irreverent farmer, whose land will no longer support his family; Liv Ullmann, his loving, perpetually pregnant wife; Robert (Eddie Axberg), his younger brother, who rebels against being an indentured farmhand; Danjel (Allan Edwall), a fundamentalist minister who, with his followers, flees persecution at home, confident that God's grace will make itself apparent when they land in America by allowing them to speak fluent American; Ulrika (Monica Zetterlund), who plays Mary Magdalene to Danjel's image of himself as Jesus; Ulrika's daughter, Karl Oskar's children, friends, associates, people met en route and so on.The scope of the film is broad, and the running time seems even longer than it actually is (2 hours 31 minutes), probably because one is never unaware of the huge narrative task the film has set for itselfand is able to accomplish only through a succession of short, cryptic, high-point scenes (a birth, a death, a departure, an illness, an arrival), which have the effect of tableaus that evoke the look of events instead of the emotion.""The Emigrants"" is divided into three parts: the events leading up to the departure from Sweden; the voyage to the United States, and the journey by rail and steamboat from the East Coast to the wilds of Minnesota. (Mr. Troell has already completed a companion film, ""The Settlers,"" about his characters as pioneers.)Although I have reservations about the film's form and intent, it's difficult not to be impressed by its conception, which called for extensive location shooting in Minnesota and Wisconsin as well as Sweden. To his credit, Mr. Troell tries to keep his melodrama small, thus avoiding the mistakes of ""Hawaii,"" one of the last of the multimillion-dollar American epics.There is also about each of the performances, particularly those of Mr. von Sydow and Miss Ullmann, a kind of spontaneous truth, in look and gesture, that does a lot to relieve the otherwise programed nobility, truth and beauty. As he showed in ""Here's Your Life,"" Mr. Troell, who is a fine cameraman, simply cannot resist the extra shot of sunlight-reflected-in-water that becomes just one too many, a thing of movie decoration.""The Emigrants"" opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater.",1972-09-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Sounder' Opens:Story of a Negro Boy in Louisiana of 1930's,"It would be so comfortable to praise ""Sounder."" The story of a boy, David, and his dog, Sounder, and his family, black sharecroppers in Louisiana in the 1930's, it is a film that virtually announces nobility. And the pre-opening reviews quoted in the ads have responded as if on cue, treating ""Sounder"" not as a movie at all but rather as something unusually worthy, like the United Fund or a UNICEF Christmas card.It is about growing up, a subject with special appeal to the makers of distinguished motion pictures, and it is about growing up poor, black and dignified, and at a time just enough in the past to carry an aura of modern, but not quite contemporary, history. Even the plot  a kindly father caught stealing food for his hungry family, sentenced to a year at hard labor, a year in which his son comes to terms with himself and learns not to accept his lothas the feeling of historical demonstration.And if ""Sounder,"" an inteligent enough movie, avoids all the major pitfalls of its type, it also lacks the excitement that may have come from plumbing greater depths and discovering a few tougher, less accessible insights.""Sounder"" was produced by Robert Radnitz, who specializes in children's films, and directed by Martin Ritt (""Hud,"" ""The Molly Maguires,"" etc.) who poses something of a problem. An earnest, conscientious director, he seems to strive for classical plainness, but to succeed only in being ordinary. When David visits his father's labor camp, a long trip on foot and the centerpiece of the film, Ritt follows him through a series of shots dissolving into one another that are clearly meant to express the journey, but really promote a kind of decorative and oddly inexpressive picture-making.And the emotional life of the family is figured too often in scenes of fond greeting or of sad farewella requirement of the story partly but also, I think, a rather dull willingness to rely on conventional public views of what are essentially private relationships.Lonne Elder's screenplay, from the novel by William Armstrong, attempts a universality in its dialogue (e.g., ""Where is it you went last night, Nathan?"" ""I did what I had to do, Rebecca."") that makes everyone sound as if he were reciting from a book. This can be very good where there is a style to match the solemnity, as in, say, the late films of Carl Dreyer, but it is merely unreal here.Among the performances, all rather expert, only the women are complicated enough to be interesting. These include Janet MacLachlan as the young black teacher who proves equal to David's sense of his own worth, and Cicely Tyson, as the mother who helped give him that sense in the first place.Miss Tyson seems to understand that part of screen acting is keeping secrets from the camera, and she does suggest a range of personality beneath and beyond the ambitions of this film.""Sounder"" opened yesterday at the Plaza and New Embassy theaters.",1972-09-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Peerce's Version of 'A Separate Peace':Story of Friendships at School at Cinema II Exeter Locale Adds to Emphasis on Details,"Larry Peerce's film version of ""A Separate Peace"" is so good and true in small, subsidiary details of costume, music, weather and such that the ultimate banality of what it's all about is just that much more apparent, and just that much more difficult to accept without seeming unnecessarily ill-tempered. Which is pretty much the way I feel about John Knowles's novel, originally published in 1960 and now, I'm told, something of a cult classic with the crowd that a decade earlier would have worshiped J. D. Salinger.The time is 1942-1943 and the setting is the posh Devon School for boys in Devon, N.H., a school long on tradition, well-born alumni and fancy bequests. It's a place much like Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, N. H., where Mr. Knowles went to school and where Mr. Peerce shot his film, paying more attention to the beauty of the season than to the sense of the screenplay that Fred Segal adapted from the novel.""A Separate Peace"" is the story of a quintessential friendship between two 16-year-old boys who are roommates, a mutual admiration society of two, rivals and, finally, an assassin and his victim. The narrator is Gene (Parker Stevenson), a bright young man whose bookishness is balanced by an exuberance fondly encouraged by his best friend, Finny (John Heyl), the most popular boy in the class, a born leader and the school's best athlete. Finny is a natural man (boy), the kind of innocent favored in romantic literature, incapable of viciousness and simply puzzled when he recognizes it in others.The separate peace of the tilte is actually a series of accommodations that repeat the film's theme as if the movie were a gigantic echo chamber. The school itself has made a separate, if temporary, peace to allow its seniors one last, normal season before they go into World War II. The first student to enlist cannot take the discipline of the service and finds his peace by going completely crackers.However, the most awesome accommodation is that between Gene and Finny after Gene knowingly or unknowingly (he is never sure which) is responsible for an accident that effectively ends all competition with Finny.Like the book, the film is compelling as long as it sticks to the more or less realistic details of upper-class American life, particularly of its school life, and of a friendship that embraces murderous hatred as well as love. But the movie, like the book, insists on drawing oversimplified, rather dumb parallels between the nature of the beast in Gene, which causes him to lash out against the innocent Finny, and the nature of war. ""Just some ignorance inside of me,"" says a mopey Gene, as if that explained anything.For the first 30 minutes, the movie looks and sounds absolutely right, but as the melodrama piles up, everything goes slightly awry, including the Knowles-Segal dialogue that has teen-agers talking what I assume is meant to be wisdom, but could only be taken as such in the lower forms.""If war can drive somebody crazy,"" says Finny when he hears of another student's nervous breakdown, ""then it's real, all right."" The admittedly nutty student describes sunlight coming through trees in ""millions of rays, like golden machine-gun fire."" I suspect that the book's popularity may be ascribed to the fact that a lot of people really wish they could talk this way.Peerce is very good with his almost completely nonprofessional cast, especially with John Heyl, a stocky, handsome young man whose face reflects the profound cheerfulness of someone who' will never grow old. Parker Stevenson has the more difficult role (perhaps an impossible one) and I'm not sure I'd have had much idea of what was going on in his mind had I not ready the book.As he displayed in ""Goodbye, Columbus,"" Peerce has a positive talent not only for period detail, but also for knowing when and how to cut around and away from the performances of non-actors so that Heyl, Stevenson and a large proportion of the Exeter student body manage to come up trumps.""A Separate Peace"" opened yesterday at the Cinema II.",1972-09-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: Eric Rohmer's 'Chloe in the Afternoon',"Frdric (Bernard Verley), the hero of ""Chlo in the Afternoon,"" the last in Eric Rohmer's marvelous cycle of comedies, which he calls his Six Moral Tales, is happily married, but he is stumped: he's no longer capable of flirting with other women.That's what he says, but he is not always trustworthy when he talks about himself. Never before in his life has he been so conscious of desirable womenon the train as he commutes from Saint-Cloud, in his Paris office, in the cafs. When he crosses a street, he attends to the passing women like a naturalist studying life in a rain forest. For a minute or two, he even falls in love with an unspectacular young saleswoman, apparently because she is so seriously insistent that he buy a shirt he doesn't want.""I feel marriage closes me in, cloisters me, and I want to escape,"" he tells us on the soundtrack. ""The prospect of happiness opening indefinitely before me sobers me. I find myself missing that time, not too long ago, when I could experience the pangs of anticipation. I dream of a life made of first loves, lasting loves.""Like Adrien in ""La Collectionneuse,"" Jean-Louis in ""My Night at Maud's"" and Jrome in ""Claire's Knee,"" Frderic must choose between love and desire, which Mr. Rohmer sometimes calls love-in-idleness. In ""Chlo in the Afternoon,"" desire takes the fairly ample shape of Chlo (Zouzou), a none too stable, not immediately prepossessing young woman out of his past Chlo, who was once a successful model and the mistress of an artist with whom she went to America, has returned to Paris with boredom in her heart and a man named Serge she doesn't love.Because Frdric feels so secure in his marriage, because Chlo's interest flatters him and because he is so incapable of flirting, he begins to see Chlo in the afternoons, just to talk, sometimes to advise her, on her muddled affairs. He tells himself that because they have no commitments to each other, he can feel a freedom and excitment with her that he can't allow in his, marriage. Quite surprisingly (at least to Frdric), he finds himself wanting to go to bed with her.""Chlo in the Afternoon,"" which opened the 10th New York Film Festival last night and begins its commercial engagement today at the 68th Street Playhouse, is the perfect coda to those three of the Six Moral Tales that have already been released here (""Collectionneuse,"" ""Maud's"" and ""Claire,"" whose heroines are recollected in a comic reverie in the new film).In ""Chlo"" Mr. Rohmer examines monogamous marriage as if it were the sum total of contemporary civilization: the thought of destroying it is natural but also to be resisted for the time being, at least until something better, more practical, comes along. It's a comedy of very funny, complex contradictions, between action and word, between image and sound.Unfortunately, because American audiences must spend a great deal of their time reading the English subtitles that translate the French dialogue, ""Chlo,"" like the earlier Rohmer films, will probably be too easily classified as literate.Much of the wit is verbal, and Mr. Rohmer's screenplay contains absolutely lovely passages, such as the one in which Frdric describes his love of Paris and its crowds as being like his love for the sea. He says he is not engulfed or lost in the city. Instead, he rides its crest like a solitary surfer following the rhythm of a wave.These passages are impressive, but the reading of them tends to distract the eye from seing what's really happening onscreen: including Mr. Rohmer's way with actors. He seldom photographs them in close-up so that we must make our own choices about what sort of people they are, about what they're thinking and whether or not we can trust them.Although Mr. Rohmer's heroes inevitably opt for the comparatively celibate choice, his films succeed in being immensely erotic. When Nestor Almendros, Mr. Rohmer's superb cameraman, shows us a few square inches of Chlo flesh, it has the suddenly tactile effect of a realnot an imaginedembrace. Most important, just because Mr. Rohmer keeps his focus short, clear and precise, one sees deeply into the lives of his characters without the sort of pretentious distortions of most movies that deal in metapsors. Because Chro is about what it says it is, it works on more profound levels.",1972-09-30T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen: 'Asylum,' a Documentary","""Asylum, I think, is to say, a safe place to be when you're frightened and alone."" It is in such disarmingly basic terms that the British psychiatrist, R. D. Laing, defines his therapeutic community in London, the subject of Peter Robinson's documentary, ""Asylum."" The community, which occupies very unpretentious quarters and houses fewer than 20 patients (probably not the right word) along with some Laingian therapists, was filmed by Mr. Robinson and his two-man crew during what must have been for them six very trying weeks early in 1971.The effort was surely worth it for ""Asylum."" unlike so many documentaries, actually has some value as a document. And as a film it passes the fairly basic testagain, unlike so many documentariesof letting its subject essentially define and express itself.It is not a course in R. D. Laing's theories. It is a record of the daily lives of some very disturbed people living in close contact with one another, and not usually putting the best face on it. Unavoidably there are some tense moments, and they are explored but not exploited by this enterprising but humanly decent film.Nobody in the therapeutic community is destitute (patients pay their own way), and nobody, except an irascible older man named David, seems inaccessible to the therapists' rather unassertive suggestions. One clever young girl, Wendy, regresses to a state of near infantile dependency, and then seems to get hold of herself and becomes in a sense the heroine of the movie.But I was most impressed by an outsider, a young male patient's businesslike father, who, in paying his son's bills and announcing that he has hired a girl for the boy to date so as to build up his ego, suggests just enough about the world at large to make ""Asylum"" seem a not unreasonable place to be.""Asylum"" opened yesterday at Film Forum, an unusual and very valuable little Upper West Side theater that shows its movies only on weekends.",1972-09-30T05:00:00+0000
