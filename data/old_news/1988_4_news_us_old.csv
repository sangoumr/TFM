Mr. Reagan has threatened to veto the trade bill if the disclosure provision is adopted.

us,Dining Out Guide: Easter Brunch,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Restaurants mentioned in Diner's Journal do not have stars. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. CAFE LUXEMBOURG, 200 West 70th Street (873-7411) - ** (May 9, 1986) Brunch is prepared with patience and care here, where an essentially American menu is offered in a stylish but casual Art Deco bistro setting. Brunch starters include fruit in season and delightfully lumpy Irish oatmeal with brown sugar and cinnamon. Among the entrees are grilled chicken salad on mixed greens with deep-fried eggs, crusty corned-beef hash, blintzes with chevre and pear compote. Homemade biscuits accompany the meal. Dense chocolate torte and a lighter lemon tart are favored desserts. Sunday brunch: 11 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. Appetizers $4 to $6, entrees $6 to $10. LOLA, 30 West 22d Street (675-6700) - * (Dec. 20, 1985) The ambiance is elegant cafe, with pastel tints and soft lighting. The noise level can be less than soft during peak serving hours, however. This Easter, and every Sunday at brunch, rousing gospel songs are performed with piano accompaniment. The kitchen offers such choices as shrimp and chicken curry with wild rice waffles, ricotta pancakes with blueberries, and potato and shrimp fritters; there are egg dishes as well. To end brunch on a sweet note, one might order the frozen raspberry charlotte. Sunday brunch: noon to 4 P.M. Prices: $11 to $16. THE VILLAGE GREEN, 531 Hudson Street (255-1650) - ** (Sept. 25, 1987) An 1827 row house is the frame for this romantic neighborhood restaurant serving imaginative American food. The prix fixe brunch menu includes entrees of smoked chicken and Italian greens on fried cappellini, duck hash served with fried eggs in peppered sauce, and poached salmon with green mayonnaise. French toast made from hallah, and scrambled eggs with sevruga caviar are also available. Hazelnut mocha mousse torte is a recommended dessert. Sunday brunch: noon to 3:30 P.M. Prix fixe at $19.95. THE WATER CLUB, on the East River at 30th Street (683-3333) - * (July 19, 1985) Treat yourself to a dose of tourism at Sunday brunch, taking in panoramic waterside views at this restaurant on a barge. Asparagus with herb vinaigrette or three-seafood salad are two of the appetizers on the brunch menu. Crab cakes (some of the best in town) are served as an entree, as are eggs Benedict with smoked Irish salmon, the grilled fish special or waffles. The warm apple tart and berries with sabayon have won acclaim. Sunday brunch: 11 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. Appetizers $4.25 to $9.75, entrees $11.50 to $22. VOULEZ-VOUS, 1462 First Avenue, at 76th Street (249-1776) - ** (Feb. 12, 1988) A French bistro of contemporary design, glass-fronted and comfortably appointed. The standard brunch menu will be supplemented on Easter with additions of roast leg of lamb, prime ribs and spinach-stuffed salmon with shallots and vermouth. Or choose French croissant toast topped with raspberry sauce, egg dishes, pizzas, cheese souffle or first-rate steak tartare, all regular brunch items. For a special Easter Sunday dessert, the chef will prepare oeufs a la neige. Sunday brunch: 11:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. Prix fixe at $10.50, extras at $2 to $4 per item.",1988-04-01T05:00:00+0000

Horan, has been recalled because of differences between the Ambasssador and senior Saudi leaders, State Department officials said. 6 Sikh violence in India's Punjab State has increased pressure on Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to declare a state of emergency.

A Government statement expressed regret for the pain victims suffered but did not apologize for the killings. 3 Curbs on the Toshiba Corporation that U.S. Congressional negotiators want to include in a trade bill were denounced by Japanese Government and business leaders, who said the act violated Japanese sovereignty. 29 A cease-fire in Nicaragua began as the country's warring armies started a 60-day cease-fire that both sides hope will lead to a permanent peace.

Some wonder whether debates over surpluses will be stormier than debates over deficits. 1 The Federated Stores takeover battle has been won by the Campeau Corporation of Canada for $6.6 billion. R. H.

Then, with Washington leading, 92-90, the Bullets scored 9 consecutive points, including 7 from King. Mark Aguirre, who scored 21 in the first half, finished with 38 points to lead the Mavericks. Rolando Blackman added 21 for Dallas.(AP) N.H.L. Red Wings 7, Maple Leafs 3: Shawn Burr scored two goals last night to lead Detroit at home and extend Toronto's losing streak to eight games. The Maple Leafs are 1-14 in their last 15 games and have lost 11 straight on the road. Burr opened the scoring for Detroit 21 seconds into the game, picking up the puck behind the Toronto net and banging a shot off the stick and through the skates of Ken Wregget, the Toronto goaltender. After Gerard Gallant scored his 34th goal to give Detroit a 2-0 lead, Burr got his second of the game and 17th of the season, again picking up the puck along the boards and skating uncontested in front of the net before bouncing a shot off Wregget.(AP) Golf Record Performance by Sluman: Jeff Sluman set course and tournament records for 36 holes yesterday and established a two-shot lead at the halfway point of the $1 million Greater Greensboro Open. The bogey-free seven-under-par round, combined with an opening 64, left Sluman at 15-under-par 129 after two rounds at the Forest Oaks Country Club. That score broke the course record of 132, set by Sandy Lyle of Scotland in 1985, and the tournament record of 131, set by George Archer at Sedgefield in 1967. Sluman's 36-hole score also matched the low on the PGA Tour this year. But even those heroics were not enough to shake his old nemesis, Lyle, a former winner of this title. He put together a 63, one lower than the course record set by Tom Purtzer in 1980 and tied by Lyle in 1986. It left Lyle at 131.(AP) Tennis Sanchez Is Winner: Unseeded Arantxa Sanchez of Spain continued a string of upsets yesterday at the $200,000 Eckerd Open in Largo, Fla., by eliminating fifth-seeded Katerina Maleeva, 6-2, 6-2, in a quarterfinal match. The straight-set victory advanced the 16-year-old Sanchez into the semifinals, where she will face another unseeded player, Patricia Tarabini of Argentina. Sanchez, 45th in the world, used a steady baseline game to beat the 12th-ranked Maleeva of Bulgaria.(AP) Horse Racing Cadillacing Wins by 2 Lengths: Cadillacing swept wide into the stretch to take the lead and went on to a two-length victory yesterday in the Distaff Handicap for fillies and mares at Aqueduct. Cagey Exuberance was second in the field of five. The victory was the fifth in seven career starts and the second straight stakes victory for Cadillacing, who won the Davona Dale Stakes at Gulfstream in her last start, March 5. Cadillacing, a 4-year-old daughter of Alydar and Relaxing, earned $84,450 for his owner, Ogden Phipps, after covering the seven furlongs on the fast track in 1:22:3. Cadillacing paid $3.60 for $2 to win as the favorite. Track Brooklyn Runners Sweep: Brooklyn high school runners swept the 440 and 880 events yesterday at the Kearny Relays at Kearny (N.J.) High School. Warren Nurse of Prospect Heights won the boys' 440 in 49.7 seconds and his teammate, Greg St. Ulmer, was first in the 880 in 1 minute 57.2 seconds. In the girls' division, Kyron Agard of Tilden was the winner of the 440-yard run in 56.2 seconds and her teammate, Renee Ray, finished first in the 880 in 2:17.",1988-04-02T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"PARIS FASHION: A Cultural History. By Valerie Steele. (Oxford University, $35.) In her first book, ''Fashion and Eroticism'' (1985), Valerie Steele put forth the notion that changes in fashion primarily reflect changes in sexual curiosity. Since then, Ms. Steele has reconsidered: ''I still believe that this is an important factor in fashion change,'' she says, ''but I now recognize that (as usual) the situation is more complex.'' Perhaps to avoid such oversimplification here, Ms. Steele is reluctant to offer much analysis at all, giving us instead an exhaustive chronicle of Paris fashion from the 14th century to the present. We meet milliners, designers, seamstresses, tailors and fashion illustrators. Quirky details abound (for example, a woman in trousers would have been arrested in 19th-century Paris unless she had a permit), but they do not add up to anything more than mere details. Ms. Steele is out to debunk historians who assert that major social upheavals - the French Revolution, say, or World War I - caused radical changes in styles. There were seeds of change before every such event, she says, and her evidence seems persuasive. But the questions remain - why did skirts rise above the ankle, for instance? Ms. Steele tells us that the ''cult of chiffon'' coincided ''with an increasing emphasis on sexual happiness within marriage.'' But that is the first and last we hear of the influence of marriage on fashion, and it is too bad. ''The real motive for fashion change originates in people's changing identities,'' she writes near the end of ''Paris Fashion.'' More about those changing identities might have transformed this book from an impressive compendium of information into an impressive work of history.",1988-04-03T05:00:00+0000

In ''Globe of Frogs,'' the title song of his latest album, a disembodied soul, searching for reincarnation, settles on a lonely old woman whose children have been ''certified insane'' -hardly a standard pop-song scenario. Sometimes, Mr. Hitchcock couches his lyrics in bouncy, straightforward, 1960's-style pop or folk-rock; more often, he does with pop-song structures what his lyrics do with the laws of physics, casually warping and dissolving them.",1988-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"SPIRIT OF THE HILLS. By Dan O'Brien. (Crown, $17.95.) You might say the central character of this wonderfully accomplished first novel is a large gray wolf. At least that's what the ranchers around Medicine Springs, S.D., would have you believe. Something huge and stealthy has been killing their sheep and cattle in the night, and it surely isn't a coyote. But wait: the very last wolf in the Great Plains was trapped in the 1920's, and now they're extinct. So what is the nervous, harassed chief forest ranger to do? Why find Bill Egan, the only man alive who's ever seen and trapped a wolf, and bring him to Medicine Springs. Meanwhile, as the ancient hunter makes his way west to locate the still-unsighted wolf, a Vietnam veteran named Tom McVay is also heading toward Medicine Springs, but for a very different reason: revenge. His younger brother has been killed in a drug deal, and this small town at the foot of the Black Hills is where McVay has been told he can find the killer. You might think that in trying to merge such vastly different plots (there's even a third highly charged story line about an Indian sit-in at nearby Mount Rushmore), Dan O'Brien has bitten off more than he can chew. But if he has, you wouldn't know it. He writes with great confidence, and his story, no matter how twisty or lurid it becomes, is always credible. Mr. O'Brien obviously knows and loves the land he writes about and clearly feels the same way about his characters. This gives his prose a special quality, as if John Ford had collaborated with Conan Doyle. You find yourself avidly turning the pages as the older and younger men's obsessions - with everything they mean about the old West and the new - inevitably intertwine. ''The Spirit of the Hills'' is an exciting, absorbing and extremely well-written book.",1988-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE: 102 of the Most Influential Companies Outside America. By Milton Moskowitz. (Macmillan, $24.95.) From Nestle and Nissan to Philips and Fiat, this hefty volume offers a glimpse of many giant corporations around the globe. The flood of foreign investment into the United States - the result, in large part, of a weak dollar - makes the book a timely one. Although it focuses mainly on the heavyweights, a few smaller concerns, most notably Club Mediterranee and the Hard Rock Cafe, are thrown in for spice. Milton Moskowitz, a veteran business writer and co-author of ''The 100 Best Companies to Work For in America,'' devotes about six pages to each profile, telling how the company got its start, what businesses it is in today and who is in charge. The sketches are highly accessible, written with little jargon, and Mr. Moskowitz has done a credible job of putting each company in the proper context. Writing about Saatchi & Saatchi, the multinational advertising empire based in London, for example, he discusses the growth in global advertising and also the problems in holding on to competing clients when their ad agencies become sister subsidiaries. Also of interest are the author's comments on companies' social policies. On the minus side: there is no real overview of what makes one company different from another, or what makes each one remarkable. For the general reader, however, ''The Global Marketplace'' should prove a useful introduction to the companies behind so many of the products we buy - and whose presence here is growing daily.",1988-04-03T05:00:00+0000
us,FICTION,"MAGNOLIA GARDENS. By Caroline Bridgwood. (St. Martin's, $17.95.) London at the turn of the century has often provided a fertile setting for fiction. And in the hands of Caroline Bridgwood, a best-selling British novelist who is making her American debut with this book, the respectable London suburb of Magnolia Gardens is nothing less than a Peyton Place of intrigue, infidelity, and murder. Narrated in turn by six central characters, the story begins by introducing the first generation of three families whose paths will intersect when they become neighbors. This promising start is brought abruptly to a close, however, and the subsequent segments of ''Magnolia Gardens'' focus on the children of these first narrators. Thus the time frame lurches forward as the discursive preamble's many seeds come to fruition in the rest of the book. Unfortunately, readers may well feel cheated when the voices of Frank Finzel, an ambitious plumber of humble origins, Magdalena Stark, a mysterious woman who has survived an ugly past, and Robert Clifford, a pompous barrister with more prosperous forebears, are allowed to recede. For while many of its details work well and its backdrop of British history from Edwardian England to the eve of World War II is convincingly real, Caroline Bridgwood's clamorous, cliche-ridden book ultimately yields neither a compelling narrative nor convincing characters.",1988-04-03T05:00:00+0000

Though her career spans 30 years of teaching (and, with this latest addition, five books), Vivian Gussin Paley enters the preschool classroom as an inveterate learner, an intramural anthropologist equipped with a tape recorder and an open mind. Whereas the average observer might perceive ordinary children engaged in nonsensical shenanigans, she finds them to be ''submerged in philosophical position papers, a virtual recapitulation of life's enigmas.'' Birth, death, the nature of power and evil - her small charges tackle the eternal mysteries daily. Through imaginative play and a bewildering array of hastily improvised rules, they not only come to terms with their own destructive impulses but bring order to apparent chaos and, ultimately, reinvent the world. The carefully transcribed dialogue seems at times more native to Bellevue than to ''Sesame Street'': these dramatist-players ''change identities and burrow into hidden places; they speak in code and flee from invisible foes.'' However, in respecting the children's level of logic and looking for their underlying concerns (not easy in the case of an inventive but intolerable game called ''doll-corner smashie''), Mrs. Paley guides them gently toward integration and growth. ''There is no small talk,'' she says of the prevailing pandemonium; indeed, a certain poetry hums just beneath the ruckus. Among the rules that the children concoct is the assertion that ''magic always needs a place to hide.'' Evidently, one need look no further than the nursery.",1988-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"IMAGIO. By James McClure. (Penzler, $16.95.) Here's a warning for novelists and novel readers alike. Beware of paragraphs, such as the one on page 9 of James McClure's ''Imago,'' that talk about the ordinariness of facing a midlife crisis - because in all probability they signal an author's unsuccessful attempt at reweaving a threadbare theme. James McClure, who normally writes mysteries set in his native South Africa, has ignored the signal in this change-of-pace novel. His protagonist, Tom Lockhart, is a London radiologist who is lurching through his troublesome middle years, and it shouldn't be thought that either his surname or the fact that he's continually performing angiograms - looking clinically at the human heart - is an insignificant clue to his emotional aneurysms. Neither is his developing friendship with Felicity (for happiness), a cardiac surgeon. Lockhart has fallen out of love with his wife, Sylvia, and has fallen in love, or so he thinks, with the teen-age daughter of friends. It is Lockhart's conniving pursuit of this girl that forms the plot of ''Imago.'' After much persistent, clumsy and mendacious finagling, Lockhart finally realizes that middle age is the time when fantasies ought to be exchanged for romantic realities, a discovery with which many men - and women too - might well identify. But it would take someone much more intriguing and amusing than the oafish Lockhart to entice most readers to go along with this twice-told - no, twice-told is a great underestimation - tale.",1988-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,A LA LAIQUE,"Etched dragonflies, bubble patterns and mica flecks, scenes such as a glass polar bear ambling across an arctic-blue lamp shade - these we find in Victor Arwas's magnificently illustrated GLASS: Art Nouveau to Art Deco (Abrams, $65), a breathtaking ode to man's creativity. ''Glass,'' Mr. Arwas writes, ''is the end product of the fusion of a siliceous matter, such as powdered flint or fine sand, with an alkali, salt or metallic oxide.'' In the late 19th century, it was also the stuff from which dreamlike forms - what the glassmaker Emile Galle aptly called ''vitrified poems'' -were made. This book, which has been written for collectors but is accessible enough for any curious reader, presents a kaleidoscopic look at some 130 glassmakers. Included are the histories and works of Louis Comfort Tiffany and Rene Lalique, the Daum brothers, Maurice Marinot, John Northwood, Johann Loetz-Witwe and others. The book lingers over the most memorable, particularly Galle, who was so enamored of flowers, insects, lily pads, banana leaves and other natural forms that he turned this love into glass. Mr. Arwas, the author of ''Art Deco,'' does his scholarly duty and provides a good bibliography and glossary as well as descriptions of techniques; there are also sections of special interest to collectors, notably signature identification guides and remarks on the detection of forgeries. But the real strength of this volume is the revelatory beauty of the glass itself. Many of these works reflect flashes of extraordinary brilliance - we'll never see their like again.",1988-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"STREGA, by Andrew Vachss. (Signet/New American Library, $4.50.) A temptress named Strega (the Italian word for ''witch'') hires a private investigator to find a photograph taken by a ring of child pornographers. The search through New York's seamy underworld makes ''Mickey Spillane's exploits read like the minutes of a Harvard alumni meeting, class of 1920,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year. The novel is ''unbelievable and slick, but fun.'' RECKLESS DISREGARD: Westmoreland v. CBS et al.; Sharon v. Time, by Renata Adler. (Vintage, $6.95.) Beginning in late 1984, two libel cases went to trial, more or less simultaneously, on the first and third floors of the Federal District Court in Manhattan. As a journalist, novelist and graduate of Yale Law School, Renata Adler took advantage of the coincidence. In her examination of the cases of Gen. William Westmoreland v. CBS and Gen. Ariel Sharon v. Time, she criticizes journalists she believes were less interested in truth than in whatever legal technicalities would get them off the hook. ''The quality throughout of intense thought - the perception of the nonobvious connections and the attention to history, to social context and to the competing values at stake - conveys the sure sense of a challenging mind at work,'' Marvin E. Frankel said here in 1986. THE TWO FACES OF JANUARY, by Patricia Highsmith. (Atlantic Monthly, $7.95.) A young American poet living in Athens tries to help a swindler who has accidentally killed a policeman elude justice; in the process he falls in love with the man's wife. ''It's an offbeat, provocative and absorbing suspense novel,'' Anthony Boucher said here in 1964. The same publisher has reissued Patricia Highsmith's book A GAME FOR THE LIVING ($7.95), which was published in 1958. The plot of this mystery also centers on a triangle, involving a German, a Mexican national and the woman they love. WIND AND SAND: The Story of the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, by Lynanne Wescott and Paula Degen. (Eastern Acorn/Abrams, $19.95.) Drawing on Orville and Wilbur Wright's own writings and the glass-plate photographs they took, the authors re-create the years in North Carolina when the two young bicycle mechanics were developing the first airplane. ''The combination achieves an uncanny evocation of what it must have been like,'' Richard Witkin said in The Book Review in 1984. ''The Wrights' brilliance, humor, tenacity and courage, intellectual and physical, are highlighted on page after page.'' FORREST GUMP, by Winston Groom. (Berkley, $3.95.) With an I.Q. near 70, Forrest Gump is not only a war hero, a football star and an astronaut (among many other things) but an idiot as well. In 1986, our reviewer, Jonathan Baumbach, said this ''picaresque novel is a kind of defanged 'Candide,' an unabrasive satire of the idiocy of life in our time. [ It ] has many pleasures to offer.'' THE JAGUAR SMILE: A Nicaraguan Journey, by Salman Rushdie. (Penguin, $6.95.) The Indian novelist Salman Rushdie spent three weeks among the Sandinistas, emerging with ''political musings [ that ] tend to sound superficial - and sometimes naive,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times in 1987. Still, she found his account ''stirring and original. . . . It gives us an impressionistic picture of the country in bright, patchwork colors unavailable in your usual journalistic dispatches.'' ALL WE NEED OF HELL, by Harry Crews. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) Duffy Deeter, a health-crazed lawyer, is so obsessed with his body that he almost destroys the rest of his life. Last year, our reviewer, Russell Banks, called Harry Crews ''a comic moralist, Swiftian at times in his ferocity and wit. . . . There is in [ his ] work the sheer pleasure of reading a man who is not embarrassed by his own sense of moral outrage.'' BEYOND OUR MEANS: How Reckless Borrowing Now Threatens to Overwhelm Us, by Alfred L. Malabre Jr. (Vintage, $6.95.) An editor of The Wall Street Journal argues that America's mounting debt and spendthrift ways could lead to a Government-controlled economy. Last year, Adam Smith (a k a George J. W. Goodman) said here that the book is ''scarier than anything by Stephen King. It may be the scariest tract since Jonathan Edwards.'' IN THE CITY, by Joan Silber. (Penguin, $6.95.) When Pauline, the teen-age daughter of Russian immigrants, leaves Newark for Greenwich Village in 1925, in search of ''a circle of people who did artistic and outrageous things,'' she finds friends reminiscent of the coolly detached characters in a Tama Janowitz story. In 1987, our reviewer, Joyce Johnson, said she doubted that life in the 20's and the 80's was really so similar, but she admired the novel's ''deft, elegant, wryly economical dissections of Pauline's elastic nature.'' CLOSE PURSUIT, by Carsten Stroud. (Bantam, $4.50.) In this book about a week in the life of a homicide detective, a Canadian journalist finds that New York City policemen are often professional and cooperative but sometimes sexist and racist. Last year, Dorothy Uhnak said here that while ''Close Pursuit'' contains too many ''unexamined opinions,'' it ''provides a strong, clear and admirable picture'' of a big-city detective. MOLECULES OF THE MIND, by Jon Franklin. (Laurel/Dell, $8.95.) Since mind, like life, is rooted in the interaction of molecules, psychology might ultimately be reduced to chemistry. In 1987, Barry L. Jacobs said here that this book about molecular psychology is sometimes glib and overstated but, for the most part, an ''exciting and thought-provoking'' account of a science and its moral and philosophical implications.",1988-04-03T05:00:00+0000

Last week, a Federal appeals court ruled that the Congress had unconstitutionally singled out Mr. Murdoch. The ruling did not affect the sale of the Post; nor did it overturn the Federal ban on cross ownership of a newspaper and television station in the same market. But it did seem to give Mr. Kalikow ideas. After the ruling, he said through a spokesman that he had ''always had the desire'' to own a radio or television station and now intended to acquire one in New York City.",1988-04-03T05:00:00+0000

Barry Came, a journalist who covered the Philippines for Newsweek, has set this colorful suspense novel in the northern Luzon highlands in the concluding years of the Marcos era. It is loosely based on the bloody struggle over ancestral lands that took place in the Chico River valley, where President Marcos and his cronies planned a huge hydroelectric project - and the Communist New Peoples' Army clashed with Government forces on behalf of the impoverished farmers who would be displaced as a result. In Mr. Came's version of this story, popular resistance to the dam project has scared away potential investors, and the United States Government has decided to intervene on the side of its client, President Marcos. Unaccountably, through a quasi-official banking agency, Mr. Came's hero, Paul Stenmark, is sent to assess the political situation. Stenmark, the sort of young professional who would be indicted if he worked on Wall Street, is plunked down in a mountain hamlet, where he comes under the protection of a number of people who fear that his ignorance and ambition may get them all into trouble. These include Alfredo Dantog, a revered chieftain who leads the faction opposed to the dam; Harry Quayle, a cynical Australian engineer; Father Frank Enright, a priest who has lost his faith; and Liz Buenaventura, a tireless country doctor. Despite their differing opinions on what's good for the uplanders, the members of this varied group have somehow learned to cooperate. All is not chummy, however, because two other outsiders - a guerrilla commander and an army lieutenant - are bent on using the situation to further their own ends. And when the inevitable battle erupts, everyone is engulfed. Alas, while ''Rice Wine'' has plenty of action, Paul Stenmark thinks and acts so slowly that he impedes a good deal of it. He also dims the luster of several more promising characters, whose points of view often seem more interesting and challenging to the author - but are only fleetingly presented to his readers.",1988-04-03T05:00:00+0000

The loss was Detroit's fourth in a row. Chicago has won 12 of its last 16 games. Jordan set up the game-winning free throws when he stole the ball near midcourt and was fouled by Bill Laimbeer. Jordan set the Silverdome record with 61 points on March 4, 1987.

Sanchez, from Barcelona, Spain, won a spot in the final by defeating unseeded Patricia Tarabini of Argentina, 6-2, 6-2, in a semifinal match rained out Saturday and resumed yesterday morning. In the final set for the championship, Evert jumped to a 5-2 lead before Sanchez made one last charge, holding serve then and breaking Evert to close to 5-4. Evert stayed firm, breaking Sanchez in the final game.(AP) Boxing Hill Knocks Out Emebe: Virgil Hill stopped Jean-Marie Emebe at 1 minute 29 seconds of the 11th round yesterday to retain his World Boxing Association light-heavyweight boxing title in Bismarck, N.D. Hill knocked Emebe down early in the deciding round of the scheduled 12-rounder. Emebe got up quickly and backed Hill into a corner, but Hill reversed himself and put Emebe in the same corner, throwing combinations that Emebe failed to answer. Referee Roberto Ramirez of Puerto Rico then stopped the bout. (AP) Golf Lyle Beats Green in Playoff: Sandy Lyle, given second life when Ken Green three-putted the 72d hole, won the Greater Greensboro Open in North Carolina yesterday with a 10-foot birdie putt on the first playoff hole. The victory was Lyle's second on the PGA Tour this season and made him the first Scot in history to lead the American money-winning list. Lyle's fourth American triumph in three seasons was worth $180,000 from the total purse of $1 million and gave him a leading total of $408,021 for the season. Lyle, three shots clear of the field when the day's play started, was one shot back when he and Green went to the last hole of regulation play. (AP) Auto Racing Prost Takes Brazil Grand Prix: Alain Prost of France, driving a McLaren-Honda Turbo, won the Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix yesterday for a record fifth time in Rio de Janeiro.

Woolworth responded by adopting a ''poison pill,'' giving existing shareholders the right to buy additional shares at half price. The Dart Group in the last three years has bid unsuccessfully for Beatrice, May Department Stores, Jack Eckerd, Safeway, Federated Department Stores, Supermarkets General, Dayton Hudson and Stop and Shop. But they have often walked away with substantial profits on their investments. [ Page D1. ] Wall Street will have one of its biggest paydays ever as a result of the battle for control of Federated Department Stores. Investment banks and law firms expect to collect at least $200 million for their work on Campeau's $6.6 billion takeover. [ D1. ] Transco Energy will pass along to customers $675 million that it expects to spend settling contract disputes with natural gas producers. Transco is a major supplier of gas to the New York area, and gas bills are expected to rise about 2 percent in the area. In exchange for the permission to pass along the charges, Transco is accepting the Federal designation of open access transporter, the equivalent of a common carrier. [ D5. ] Irving Bank forecast higher earnings in an attempt to persuade stockholders that Bank of New York's $63-a-share offer is too low. Irving Bank forecast net income of $234 million, or $11.78 a share, based on its performance in the first two months of 1988. [ D2. ] The first step toward cloning I.B.M.'s PS/2 personal computers has been taken by two computer makers. Canon and a Taiwanese computer manufacturer will need other licenses to proceed. [ D6. ] Kansas City Southern has repurchased 11.3 percent of its stock from an investment group led by Howard Kaskel, a New York real estate developer. The company paid $60 a share, or $72 million, well above the market price of $49.75 yesterday. [ D5. ] MGM/UA Communications has received several inquiries about a possible takeover. [ D5. ] MARKETS Prices of Treasury notes and bonds tumbled by a point or more as bond traders reacted to Friday's unexpectedly strong employment figures by selling fixed-income securities. Much of the downward move occurred in overnight trading in Tokyo, the first market with a chance to react to the data. Traders said few retail customers showed much interest. [ D1. ] Stocks moved broadly lower with the cheer generated by the strong employment figures released Friday offset by fears of inflation caused by that strength. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 7.46 points, to 1,980.60. [ D10. ] The dollar finished mixed against foreign currencies after opening in Asia at a three-month low against the Japanese yen. Gold rose $1.85 an ounce in New York, to $455.85. [ D20. ] Prices of precious metals futures rose and soybean prices surged to four-year highs, fanning new fears of inflation. [ D20. ] INTERNATIONAL An appeals judge in India ordered Union Carbide to pay $195 million in immediate compensation for victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, apparently ruling that the company's liability had been adequately established without a trial. The ruling is certain to be appealed by Union Carbide to the Supreme Court of India and possibly to courts in the United States. Experts said the decision could speed negotiations to settle the case. [ D1. ] A proposal to require disclosure of foreign investment has proved as contentious as anything in the trade bill. And when the House and Senate conferees recessed last week, the disclosure amendment remained unresolved.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: THURSDAY, APRIL 7, 1988","MARKETS Surging stock prices activated the curb on computerized trading at the New York Stock Exchange for the first time. The suspension, which comes into play when the Dow Jones industrial average moves 50 points, cooled off the market briefly. But the Dow regained its strength as program traders began executing buy orders manually and closed at 2,061.67, up 64.16 points. [ Page A1. ] Late gains produced the second-largest rise of the year for the Dow Jones industrial average. The increase of 64.16 points, or 3.2 percent, to 2,061.67 was its ninth-best point rise ever. Volume was 189.8 million shares, up sharply from Tuesday's level. [ D1. ] Treasury note and bond prices rallied in sympathy with improvement in the dollar and with a push from the Federal Reserve, which bought bonds for its own account and for a customer. The strongest gains were in the longest-term Treasury issues. [ D14. ] The dollar rallied for a second straight day, buoyed by news reports from Japan that the Group of Seven would make a commitment not to let the dollar slip below 125 Japanese yen. Gold fell $3.60 in New York, to $448.25 an ounce. [ D16. ] Cattle futures continued their advance on the Chicago Merc, following Tuesday's late recovery. [ D16. ] INTERNATIONAL The U.S. will try to stimulate more trade with Moscow. Commerce Secretary Verity won approval of the plan after two months of Cabinet discussion. The Treasury and State Departments gave him strong support, one official said, and only the Pentagon voiced reservations, fearing that an improved Soviet economy would mean a stronger adversary. [ A1. ] President Reagan denied a Japanese fishing request because Japan violated an international moratorium on whaling. The Government called the action ''the strongest permitted by the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment.'' But environmentalists complained that it was little more than a slap on the wrist. [ D1. ] Argentina will lift most price controls on April 16, ending its latest unsuccessful effort to halt inflation. [ D5. ] THE ECONOMY Late March sales of American-made vehicles rose 11 percent from a year ago. The Big Three increased their market share to about 77 percent, up about 2.5 percentage points from a year ago. And for the first time since voluntary export restraints were adopted in 1981, Japanese auto makers failed to ship their annual quota of cars. [ D1. ] The average interest rate on fixed-rate mortgages fell to an 11-month low of 10.34 percent in early March, from 10.48 percent a month earlier, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported. [ D2. ] Yields were mixed on C.D.'s, bank money market accounts and money market mutual funds for the week ended yesterday. [ D7. ] COMPANIES Continental Airlines is still struggling to smooth out its operations and has been short of cash at times, a filing with the S.E.C. shows. Some analysts think Texas Air, its parent, will have to sell Eastern Air Lines to concentrate on Continental. [ D1. ] Macy would have sold four Federated store divisions for almost $3 billion if it had won its takeover battle with Campeau. [ D4. ] Moore McCormack agreed to be bought by Southdown for $512 million, or $40 a share, ending two months of resistance.

But is Washington committed to such a deal? The American Government has long played Hamlet on the dollar, asking itself: ''To stabilize or not to stabilize?'' To stabilize, it hopes, would be to calm investors' fears of a precipitously falling dollar and thereby to bring down long-term interest rates on dollar assets. But it fears that this would leave the United States trade position in deep deficit. Not to stabilize the dollar might make American goods more competitive but might cut off the inflow of foreign capital.",1988-04-08T05:00:00+0000

The tiebreaker score was 7-5. Annacone, ranked No. 50 in the world and without a tournament championship since 1985, got the better of five first-set service breaks. His last break came in the 11th game. Down an advantage point in the final game of the set, he closed it out when Connors lost 3 straight points.(AP) N.C.A.A. SWIMMING Wharton Sets 400 Record: David Wharton, an 18-year-old Southern Cal freshman from Warminster, Pa., swam the fastest 400-yard individual medley in history last night. In the National Collegiate Athletic Association men's championships in Indianapolis, Wharton won by 10 yards in 3 minutes 42.23 seconds. That bettered the United States Open record of 3:43.04 by Tamas Darnyi of Hungary last December and the American record of 3:46.54 by Jeff Kostoff in 1985. No world records can be set in this meet because it is being swum in a 25-yard pool and world records require a 50-meter course. Wharton, who won the 200-yard individual medley Thursday, became the meet's first double winner. Jay Mortenson, a 21-year-old Stanford junior from Madison, Wis., won two titles in 35 minutes. He took the 100-yard butterfly by 1 1/2 feet in 47.27 seconds and then the 100-yard backstroke by 2 1/2 feet in 48.17 seconds. Patrick Jeffrey of Texas added the three-meter diving title to Thursday's one-meter victory. The other winners last night were Doug Gjertsen of Texas in the 200-yard freestyle (1:34.51), Giovanni Minervini of U.C.L.A. and Italy in the 100-yard breast-stroke (53.90 seconds) and Texas in the 800-yard freestyle relay (6:23.47). Texas took the team lead from Southern Cal, 273 points to 247 1/2. GOLF Walker Takes the Lead: Colleen Walker shot a four-under-par 67 yesterday to take a one-shot lead over the first-day leader, Lenore Rittenhouse, after two rounds of the $225,000 San Diego Inamori Classic. Walker, who has finished among the top 10 at five of this season's seven L.P.G.A. tournaments, made seven birdies and two bogeys for a seven-under 135 at the 6,021-yard, par-71 StoneRidge Country Club course. Rittenhouse, who started with a two-shot lead after shooting a career-best 65, remained at six under after matching par with two birdies and two bogeys. Nancy Lopez birdied three of the first four holes on her second nine en route to a 68 that moved her into a third-place tie with Patty Sheehan, a three-time Inamori winner, and Ok Hee Ku of Korea at 138.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY, APRIL 9, 1988","MARKETS Stock prices rose to their highest level since the crash in October. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 28.02 points, to 2,090.19, surpassing the previous post-crash high of 2,087.37 set on March 18. Analysts said the surge, most of which came late in the day, was caused by strength in computer stocks, optimism over the Group of Seven currency talks scheduled for next week and a new bout of program trading. For the week, the Dow gained 102.06 points, or 5.1 percent, with much of the lift coming from the 64-point surge on Wednesday. [ Page 37. ] Treasury bond prices climbed in light trading, in a rebound that market participants attributed largely to technical factors. The rally helped cut the yield on the bellwether long-term bond to 8.68 percent, from 8.79 percent the previous day. A good part of the gain was attributed to buying by short-sellers. [ 40. ] The dollar drifted lower while the British pound held its ground, despite cuts in British interest rates. Gold prices nudged upward, with a late New York quote of $449 an ounce, a gain of 15 cents. [ 46. ] Crude oil prices slipped slightly in quiet trading on the belief that the weekend OPEC meeting would do little to raise prices. [ 46. ] COMPANIES I.B.M. will sell licenses allowing copying of its new PS/2 computer line, conceding that the competition is necessary to help the machines become an industry standard. The spread of cheaper ''clone'' machines helps create a demand for I.B.M.-compatible software, making the entire industry more dependent on I.B.M. At the same time, I.B.M. said it would raise the cost of obtaining these licenses by as much as five times its current licensing fees. [ 37. ] The stock of Staley Continental surged above the $32 a share offered by Tate & Lyle. Staley's stock gained $5.875, to $37.375, and was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. Tate & Lyle, a British company, has held a stake in Staley, a maker of corn sweeteners, for some time and has a joint European venture with Staley. Tate & Lyle said it wanted to ''return Staley to basics'' by selling many of the food-distribution operations that Staley has acquired. [ 37. ] Six radio stations will be involved in a $300 million merger of Metropolitan Holdings and Sillerman Acquisition. Metropolitan's holdings include the New York stations WNEW-AM and -FM. [ 39. ] Quaker State received a buyout offer of $695 million, or $26.50 a share, from a group led by a New York investment firm. [ 38. ] West Point-Pepperell suffered one serious blow and narrowly fended off another in its quest for control of J. P. Stevens. [ 48. ] The deadline on a bid for First City Bancorp was extended again as many bondholders continued to balk at the terms. [ 40. ] American Stores said it had received a commitment for $2.5 billion in financing for its battle to acquire Lucky Stores. [ 39. ] THE ECONOMY Consumer borrowing rose by $5.3 billion in February, an annual growth rate of 10.3 percent. The increase was led by a 14.7 percent annualized rise in the amount of money borrowed to buy automobiles. Analysts said this latest sign of consumer confidence was another indication that the economy remained on course for growth of 2 percent or more this year. [ 37. ] INTERNATIONAL British interest rates were cut to their lowest level in a decade to stem the rise of the pound in the currency markets. The pound's strength threatens to make British goods less price-competitive internationally. The Bank of England lowered a key lending rate by three-eighths of a percentage point, to 8 percent. [ 40. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS Windfalls are usually welcome but caution is in order for anyone who comes into a large sum of money. Experts say the first thing to do is nothing. They recommend parking the money in a safe, interest-bearing account for six months or so until a comprehensive strategy can be devised. Your Money.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"AN UNCOMMON SAILOR: A Portrait of Admiral Sir William Penn. By Lucie Street. (Dunne/St. Martin's, $12.95.) In ''An Uncommon Sailor,'' the English writer Lucie Street blows a thick layer of dust off the reputation of Sir William Penn. He is remembered as the father of the Quaker who founded Pennsylvania, but Ms. Street sees him as an admiral who ''should be ranked with Drake and Nelson as one of the great makers of the English naval tradition.'' In a life that spanned just 49 years, Penn revamped naval tactics, commanded the fleet that captured Jamaica and served in Parliament. Pennsylvania was granted to his son as a reward for these services. Penn clearly deserves recognition, but this slim biography may laud its subject too highly. Ms. Street praises Penn for his joint loyalties to king and Parliament. During the Commonwealth, however, this amounted to playing both sides and was part of the reason Cromwell sent Penn to the Tower. The House of Commons charged him with embezzling goods from captured ships - an accusation Ms. Street brushes aside rather lightly. Hasty research is a graver problem. Ms. Street claims ''it is probable that Penn conducted'' the English squadron that captured New Amsterdam in 1664. In fact, it was Col. Richard Nicolls. And one wishes the book drew more on one eyewitness: Penn's Navy Board colleague Samuel Pepys, whose acerbic eloquence deserves quotation. Ms. Street summarizes what Pepys recorded: Penn was fond of ''drinking the susceptible into a stupour, singing bawdy songs and supping at midnight off bread-and-butter on the roof.'' And there she stops, which is a shame: this warts-and-all portrait of Penn is intriguing.",1988-04-10T05:00:00+0000

In this dreary portrayal of female collegians in the 1980's, Garret Weyr takes on her own alma mater, the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Here Alexandria, Penelope and Caroline become friends as they discover their physical and mental similarities. ''Not pretty girls in the classical sense,'' but tall and tough-minded, they find refuge in their notion of themselves as the Amazon Club. Alexandria, an obsessive New Yorker, is bulimic (''She does not believe in dieting; she believes in vomiting'') and a recovering rape victim; Penelope falls in love with a beautiful homosexual and then, out of frustration, has hurried sex with an old lover, which results in pregnancy; Caroline, who's lost her boyfriend to ''a pretty girl'' and her older brother to the Vietnam War, suffers from jealousy, loneliness and depression. The Amazons' acquaintances confront drug abuse, fears of lesbianism and suicide - and all in a single semester of their sophomore year. Unfortunately, this disappointing first novel often seems sophomoric itself (''Fate works in mysterious ways,'' Alex thinks; ''A name change doesn't take you away from what you are,'' she later opines. ''Does anything?''), and its unrelieved drumming of pain and anxiety fails to engage the reader.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"NONINDIFFERENT NATURE. By Sergei Eisenstein. Translated by Herbert Marshall. (Cambridge University, $37.50.) We have Joseph Stalin to thank, in part, for Sergei Eisenstein's brilliant theoretical writings on film; had he not made it so difficult for the great Russian director of ''Potemkin'' and ''Ivan the Terrible'' to practice what he eventually preached, Eisenstein's legacy would undoubtedly have contained more films and fewer analyses like this one. Written during and shortly after World War II, these essays represent the mature phase of Eisenstein's thinking about film - which he regarded as the highest of the arts, a complex synthesis of painting, sculpture, music and poetry. Alternately chatty and recondite, Eisenstein skips across the terrain of the arts, from the peaks of high culture to the valleys of mass culture. He employs his notion of linear, or horizontal, montage (the collision of opposing images) as a jumping-off point for an exploration of ''vertical montage,'' by which he means the integration of landscape, lighting, camera angle, color and gesture. The highest expression of vertical montage is the point at which representation passes into music. By music, he means ''that inner 'plastic music' that, in the various stages of silent film, bore within itself the actual plastic composition of film.'' This job falls to landscape - ''the freest element of film, the least burdened with servile, narrative tasks, and the most flexible in conveying moods, emotional states, and spiritual experiences.'' Altogether, ''Nonindifferent Nature'' is a fascinating book. The introduction by the film scholar Herbert Eagle is excellent, and Herbert Marshall's translation makes a potentially inaccessible work readable and even engaging.",1988-04-10T05:00:00+0000

His approach is based on the concept that biologic function is the result of a mind-body duality that not only maintains the biologic self in wellness, but also plays a critical role in the causation of certain diseases and their response to treatment. Although this concept has not been formally included in the traditional Western medical curriculum, there exists a voluminous cache of research data as well as personal clinical experience compelling enough to convince many medical practitioners, myself included, that the psyche has a substantial role in the causation and clinical course of a disease.",1988-04-10T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"CRIMINAL TENDENCIES. By William O'Rourke. (Dutton, $19.95.) This crime thriller, William O'Rourke's third novel, is set within the glitzy, sleazy confines of Key West - ''Disneyland for dropouts,'' as one of the characters thinks of it. With the Mariel boatlift of 1980 as a sociohistorical backdrop, the author assembles a sorry gang of small-time criminals and their mixed-up girlfriends, along with a few jaded writers, and sets them loose on the island. The gang, led by Jay Winston Cross, a neurotic, spoiled art thief, sets out to steal a valuable collection of prints by the ornithologist John James Audubon from a poorly guarded museum. At first, the writers - a burned-out journalist, an idealistic poet and a corrupt novelist - watch this odd heist from a safe distance. But as the story progresses, the distinction between thief and writer becomes blurred; everyone, it seems, has a penchant for crime and self-destruction. And everyone - including the poorly educated ex-convicts - has an uncanny tendency to view the world in metaphor. Thanks to Mr. O'Rourke's gifted eye for sordid detail, the imagery is original and provocative. Sometimes, though, he gets carried away (early on, for example, a pile of unclaimed shoes in a cobbler's shop is described as ''a real Auschwitz bundle''). Mr. O'Rourke's ambitious novel, rich with allegorical and political possibilities, can be as dazzling as the tropic sun. But if you're not careful, ''Criminal Tendencies'' will quickly wear you out and make you long for simpler pleasures.",1988-04-10T05:00:00+0000

''The younger the child, the smaller the occasion - and the gift,'' advised Judith Martin, author of ''Miss Manners' Guide to Rearing Perfect Children.'' For older students, the best gifts this year fall conveniently into two categories - traditional and electronic. Travel, that literal rite of passage, is still a highly coveted present.

us,Q&A,"Barbuda Question:I am having a terrible time trying to arrange accommodations on Barbuda, sister island of Antigua. There is no phone service. Any suggestions? - I. W., Ann Arbor, Mich. Answer:The island of Barbuda, 15 miles long and up to 8 wide, has about 60 rooms for visitors. There are no paved roads. Until a few years ago there were no telephones, but several have now been installed. The number of the Sunset View Resort, for example, where a double room costs about $55 a day in summer and $75 in winter, is 809-460-0016. The Thomas Guesthouse number is 809-460-0004; its year-round rate for a double room is about $25 a day. But reservations for Barbuda are generally made in Antigua. A hotel booking agency that can help is the Earl's Complex, Church Street, St. John's, Antigua (telephone, 809-462-4488). It represents the Earl's Villa, a small group of efficiencies on Barbuda, which cost $50 a day for two, and also arranges flights. The Earl's Complex said round-trip air fare between Antigua and Barbuda, 28 miles away, is about $30 for a day trip and $43 for a visit of up to 21 days. (These fares are based on calculating the Eastern Caribbean dollar at 2.60 to the United States dollar.) Another place to stay on Barbuda is Coco Point Lodge, which has a representative on Antigua (809-462-3816). General information can also be sought from the Antigua-Barbuda Department of Tourism (Post Office Box 363, St. John's, Antigua; 809-462-0029, and 610 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10020; 212-541-4117).",1988-04-10T05:00:00+0000

After spending a season observing the big leagues, the New York Times book critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt contemplated the uneasy relationship between those who play baseball and those who sit in the press box and write about it. ''Seldom is the awkwardness of this situation so freshly and unabashedly reflected as in this book,'' Roy Blount Jr. said in The Times in 1986. STARING AT THE SUN, by Julian Barnes. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $7.95.) On the eve of her 100th birthday, in 2021, an Englishwoman named Jean Serjeant, who once left a ''second-rate life'' with a boring husband to seek enchantment and the wonders of the world, boards an airplane and flies into the sun. Last year our reviewer, Carlos Fuentes, called the novel ''a marvelous literary epiphany'' and praised Julian Barnes, the author of ''Flaubert's Parrot,'' for using his ''great precision of language, ironical detachment and talent for the incarnation of ideas'' to let his readers ''witness a reality we do not normally see.'' TANIA: A Biography and Memoir of Isak Dinesen, by Parmenia Migel. (McGraw-Hill, $8.95.) Karen Blixen's nom de plume was Isak Dinesen, but to her friends she was Titania - Tania for short. In 1967, when this memoir by Parmenia Migel was first published, our reviewer, William Jay Smith, called it ''a remarkably sensitive book that . . . never for one moment loses sight of [ Dinesen's ] magic. . . . Miss Migel has told Tania's own story as she would have wished it told, with accuracy and care, with wit and style.'' WHO KILLED PALOMINO MOLERO? by Mario Vargas Llosa. Translated by Alfred Mac Adam. (Collier/ Macmillan, $6.95.) The Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa uses a detective story about the murder of a young singer to explore the ambiguities of truth, justice and evil. ''Evoking landscape and mores in writing that is spare, rich and cruelly beautiful, he both satisfies the requirements of the genre and demonstrates that it too can resonate like any other form of fiction,'' Richard Lourie said in The Book Review last year. THE NEW AMERICAN GRANDPARENT: A Place in the Family, a Life Apart, by Andrew J. Cherlin and Frank F. Furstenberg Jr. (Basic Books, $9.95.) Increased longevity and the ever-advancing demographic bulge are creating a country that is top-heavy with grandparents, who are providing their children's children with something halfway between a parental authority figure and an aging friend. In 1986 Maggie Scarf said here that this sociological study is ''a bit dry in places,'' but that it provides a ''comprehensive and intriguing portrait of grandparenting in America today.'' A NIGHT AT THE MOVIES: Or, You Must Remember This, by Robert Coover. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) Written in the form of absurd cinematic parodies, Robert Coover's collection of short fiction shows that the printed page can be more malleable to the imagination than the silver screen. ''The book gives us a long, exhilarating evening at an old-fashioned movie palace,'' Edmund White said here last year. ''Mr. Coover has understood the potential of the movies to persuade and to subvert but also to go out of control.'' THE CAPTIVE PUBLIC: How Mass Opinion Promotes State Power, by Benjamin Ginsberg. (Basic Books, $8.95.) By managing mass opinion, Benjamin Ginsberg writes, governments use democracy as a means of social control. Last year our reviewer, Mark Crispin Miller, said the author's ''quasi-Orwellian vision is oversimple,'' but he found the book ''largely admirable.'' OVERHEAD IN A BALLOON: Twelve Stories of Paris, by Mavis Gallant. (Norton, $7.95.) When these interlocking stories by the Canadian writer were published last year, Phyllis Rose said in these pages that Mavis Gallant ''conjures up [ Paris ] more knowingly than any other fiction writer in English. . . . In the taut, high-wire literary performances in this volume, [ she ] is at the top of her form.'' A GOOD ENOUGH PARENT: A Book on Child-Rearing, by Bruno Bettelheim. (Vintage, $9.95.) Last year our reviewer, Barbara Ehrenreich, said she wondered how Bruno Bettelheim thought today's two-paycheck families would have time for his leisurely, permissive approach to child raising. But she found the book ''a reassuring corrective to the hubris that leads many parents to think they can mold a child to meet their exact specifications.'' SERENISSIMA, by Erica Jong. (Dell, $4.95.) An intellectual American actress travels to the 16th century and has a lurid affair with William Shakespeare. In 1987 Michael Malone said in The Book Review that he didn't like this novel as much as he did ''Fanny,'' but he praised Erica Jong for ''her careful research, her rich descriptive facility and her deep love of the period.'' THE TOMORROW MAKERS: A Brave New World of Living-Brain Machines, by Grant Fjermedal. (Tempus, $8.95.) If the mind is a program, theoretically it can be ''downloaded,'' or fed, into computerized robots, granting a kind of immortality. Last year one reviewer said this book about computer scientists and robotics is ''a virtual smorgasbord of artificial intelligence.'' MEMOIRS OF MANY IN ONE, by Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray. Edited by Patrick White. (Penguin, $6.95.) A madwoman's fantasies, cast as a memoir edited by the author, allow Patrick White to write a story about writing stories. In 1986 our reviewer, Jonathan Baumbach, called the novel ''an elegant book, a comic meditation on the nature of art (and putative madness), a minor 'Tempest' in a career of sometimes oversized teapots.''",1988-04-10T05:00:00+0000

The World War II Gulf Coast town of Bay Harbor has a prominent Baptist church, ''nigra'' quarters tucked discreetly across the tracks, and a tradition that well-bred children should be seen and not heard. Nine-year-old Anna Lee Owens has been trained in that tradition, so she suffers in silence her childhood fears that a bully named Hazel will catch her alone - or that her beloved Uncle Johnn will marry and move away. Even complicated predicaments have simple consequences for Anna Lee; when she surprises a neighbor being beaten by her husband, Chester, Anna Lee's biggest fear is that she won't be allowed to visit them anymore. But the stakes become higher when Chester begins to pursue and molest Anna Lee, making sure she won't tell by offering a two-pronged threat: if she talks, either her father will shoot Chester and go to jail, or Chester will shift the blame to Uncle Johnn. Thus the girl begins a year of protecting everyone she loves by her silence. In this first novel, Anna Lee's narration is usually true to her age, although sometimes she seems just a bit too insightful. For the most part, however, Ruth Coe Chambers uses Anna Lee's point of view artfully as she explores the terror of growing up in a world full of conflicting rules and values. When Chester nearly rapes the girl, and everyone believes his version of the story, Anna Lee's protective silence turns to actual muteness. Here ''The Chinaberry Album'' falters a little, with a fire and even an alligator attack used to set things right. But by then Anna Lee and her loved ones have inspired enough affection that even the most pragmatic reader couldn't wish for any other ending.",1988-04-10T05:00:00+0000

The substance was cigarettes; the place was my best friend Mike's house. His parents being away for the evening, we agreed that the time had come. We went looking for an open pack. There wasn't one. So Mike, who could do anything with his hands, decided to extract one cigarette from a closed pack and then reclose it. This he accomplished over the next hour or so, right down to gluing the red cellophane strip back in place so that neither of his parents, in the urgency of craving, would ever notice that the pack had been tampered with, or that it was one shy of 20 cigarettes. (In retrospect, I can hardly comprehend how difficult it was for us good kids to do bad things in Tacoma, Wash., in the mid-1950's.) After all that foreplay, the moment of consummation arrived.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"H. H. RICHARDSON: Architectural Forms for an American Society. By James F. O'Gorman. (University of Chicago, $24.95.) Just what was American about America worried and interested intellectuals during much of the 19th century. But few people had to deal with the country's cultural nationalism more visibly than architects, and few architects did it more successfully than Henry Hobson Richardson, who practiced, mostly in Boston, from 1865 until his death in 1886. His career alone pivoted the issue from a question to an answer. In this compact, clearly organized book, James F. O'Gorman, a professor of American art at Wellesley College, charts Richardson's architectural progress: first his Beaux Arts education, then his picturesque eclecticism, then his Romanesque eclecticism and finally his elemental architecture of simplicity and repose. The mature buildings, such as the Marshall Field warehouse in Chicago, emphasized natural materials rather than decoration and were commanding American products that established a tradition Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright would later follow and deepen. But for Mr. O'Gorman, style - even an American style - is not the only issue. He interprets buildings as part of social history. Richardson started practicing just after the Civil War, as rural America became urban and the agricultural economy became industrial. The country required different types of buildings, and he helped invent them. He also gave shape to the new suburban house and to the new train depot between suburb and city. The best of Richardson's buildings were a double invention -different classes of buildings and a different, more American character.",1988-04-10T05:00:00+0000

Washington said the accord, which lets both sides arm combatants, would be signed on Thursday in Geneva. Page A1 Military analysis: The Soviet Army enjoyed an impressive reputation before the war in Afghanistan. While the military may be relieved by the decision to withdraw forces, its reputation has suffered. A16 Meetings on American-Soviet trade opened in Moscow. Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov complained to Commerce Secretary C. William Verity Jr., who heads the American group, that trade relations are inadequate. D8 Israel expelled eight Palestinians into southern Lebanon and ordered the deportation of 12 others. They were the first deportations since Jan. 13, when Israel expelled four Palestinians. A1 Federal drug programs are failing because they emphasize a crackdown on suppliers and neglect the task of drawing drug users away from the habit, experts say. Efforts to reduce supplies have been ineffective. A1 Hijackers of a Kuwaiti jet killed a second hostage and then put a passenger on the radio to announce that more people were facing death. The killing halted negotiations over the plane's fate. A1 An explosion in Pakistan on Sunday may have been caused by saboteurs, President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq suggested. Hundreds may have died in the explosion, which struck the cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. A1 China's education policies are being protested openly by some students and teachers discontented with conditions. Education has emerged as a troubling issue during the current session of parliament. A4 Francois Mitterrand is campaigning for re-election as President of France, not just as the Socialists' candidate. He is now a moderate on economic issues, but his sympathetic stand toward immigrants has surprised many. A3 Panama sanctions puzzle companies A6 NATIONAL A20-33, B6-7 Greater roles for women in the Roman Catholic Church are recommended at almost every level except the priesthood in a draft report by a committee of United States bishops, who also condemned sexism. A1 Drugs have corrupted Italy's Mafia, a former member of the Sicilian Mafia testified at the most extensive Senate hearings on organized crime in 25 years. Tommaso Buscetta said he no longer felt bound by the code of silence. A20 Access to emergency medical care has become a serious problem for many rural areas in the United States. It has become acute in western states like Colorado where great distances separate small towns. A20 Democrats in Houston are furious that the new Democratic Committee chairman supports Lyndon LaRouche. Committee members hope to strip the chairman of all power by the time he is sworn on May 2. A24 Sale of Texaco's German subsidiary is being negotiated as part of the company's post-bankruptcy restructuring plan, according to company executives. The potential buyers have not been identified. D1 Presidential veto of a trade bill now nearing completion could be overriden by Congress, Jim Wright, the Speaker of the House, suggested. President Reagan has warned of a veto if two sections are not modified. D9 POLITICS B6-7 Mayor Koch said he will endorse either Gov. Michael S. Dukakis or Senator Albert Gore Jr. for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Mr. Koch said he would make the endorsement after talking with each man. B6 Michael Dukakis absolved Israel of fault in the Palestinian disturbances on the West Bank. In an appearance before a conference of Jewish leaders, he refused to take a stand on a Palestinian state. B7 WASHINGTON TALK A32 Colleagues help as Senators campaign REGIONAL B1-5 A murder suspect was captured in a routine anti-drug operation on the Lower East Side Sunday night. The former convict, sought in two Pennsylvania slayings, was caught when police stopped his pick-up truck. B1 The Red Hook Marine Terminal in Brooklyn, the last major cargo handling operation in New York City, is bustling. But the terminal needs more help from the Port Authority, which owns the terminal, to compete with New Jersey, officials say. B1 Bus trips to Altantic City's casinos bring more than 14.2 million people a year to gamble there. Many are elderly, taking the trip as much for the experience as the prospect of winning. B1 Fights over gold jewelry at the West Side High Scool in New York City prompted the principal, Edward Reynolds, to forbid students from wearing thick gold chains, breast plates and outsize medallions to school. B1 A reform of prison health services must be carried out in New York City, according to a consultant, who said its capacity must be tripled to meet the rising inmate population and AIDS caseload.

Page A1 News analysis: Afghan chaos is expected to resume under the Geneva accords. More than one million Afghans have been killed and nearly one-half of the population has been uprooted. A1 The Afghan war changed the Soviet Union and its outlook on the world in subtle but significant ways. A1 A deep rift in the Honduran military contributed to the release of a major drug-trafficking suspect to Washington and that action has intensified the struggle, Government officials and foreign diplomats said. A1 A blast outside a G.I. club in Naples killed at least five people and wounded 15, including several American sailors. The police said the bombhad apparently been placed in or under a car. A3 A U.S. Navy frigate was damaged by an underwater blast in the central Persian Gulf that wounded at least 10 crew members and partly flooded the ship. However, she headed under her own power toward Bahrain. A3 Hijackers released one hostage but prospects for the release of other captives aboard a Kuwaiti airliner shifted as the hijackers held long talks with Algerian officials on the 10th day of the odyssey. A9 Sanctions against Mexico were voted overwhelmingly by the Senate on the ground that it has failed to cooperate fully in halting the flow of drugs across its borders. The measure must also be approved by the House. A6 National A14-22 The nation's trade deficit soared to $13.8 billion in February as imports surged more than twice as much as exports, the Commerce Department reported, surprising analysts. A1 The dollar plunged in reaction to the widening American trade gap, forcing world central banks to intervene to restore stability. D5 Stock prices also plummeted. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 101.46 points, or 4.82 percent, to 2,005.64. It was the index's fifth-worst point loss in history. A1 The grumblings of taxpayers have increased as the filing deadline nears. The simplicity and relief promised by architects of the new system have eluded many people. D2 A Navy heart surgeon was freed after a military appeals court set aside his conviction. The surgeon, Comdr. Donal M. Billig, was found guilty in 1986 of responsibility for the deaths of three patients. A17 Richard Nixon is in greater demand than ever. The former President, who appeared on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' last Sunday, plans several other television appearances and at least five speeches around the country. A14 A jetliner engine exploded and sliced into the plane, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing in Charleston, W. Va.

Mr. Koch said it was irrevelent that his endorsement might aid his least favorite aspirant, Jesse Jackson. A1 Gov. Michael S. Dukakis staked out an ambitious arms control platform that is much more liberal than the views of many Democratic military experts, who accuse the Presidential aspirant of naivete.

Prosecutors contended the witness, Frank Simone, was recanting because of intimidation. B1 The state is studying all bridges in New York City that have deterioration levels similar to those on the Williamsburg Bridge, which was closed on Tuesday because of safety hazards.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"SUMMER LIGHTNING: And Other Stories. By Olive Senior. (Longman, $8.95.) ''Somewhere between the repetition of Sunday School lessons and the broken doll which the lady sent me one Christmas I lost what it was to be happy.'' So begins the narrator in ''Love Orange,'' one of 10 short stories in Olive Senior's remarkable, if uneven, collection. A brief tale of innocence lost, ''Love Orange'' succeeds in establishing a tone that draws the reader in as it makes its way toward a painful conclusion: the end of belief is the beginning of maturity. Ms. Senior is a writer who shares with the Antiguan Jamaica Kincaid and the Barbadian Paule Marshall the ability to merge island syntax with British inflection. The result is a language that is deft and lyrical. Ms. Senior's stories, all set in Jamaica, are peopled with characters who believe that their dream life is every bit as significant as their daily one, though this belief makes for seductive prose, not necessarily convincing plot lines. The most winning stories are those in which plot barely makes an appearance, as in the title story. It is when Ms. Senior depicts mood, atmosphere and the inner life of her characters that her work avoids a tendency toward the maudlin or the melodramatic. ''Summer Lightning'' is an original contribution to the flourishing school of West Indian writers who create rooms we've never seen before, voices we've never heard.",1988-04-17T05:00:00+0000

Washington did not signal its distress until it had proceeded 200 meters into the race. Washington stopped, however no referee signaled Harvard to break off the racing. After Harvard finished and was declared the winner, Washington protested that the race should have been stopped to allow the Huskies to secure the No. 3 man's oar lock, and then rerow the entire race.

us,New & Noteworthy,"LOOK HOMEWARD: A Life of Thomas Wolfe, by David Herbert Donald. (Fawcett Columbine, $12.95.) Last month, this biography of a man - who the Harvard historian David Herbert Donald says ''wrote more bad prose than any other major writer I can think of'' - won Mr. Donald his second Pulitzer Prize. ''A six-and-a-half-foot, hard-drinking monomaniac who believes himself to be the Great American Writer would appear to be fiction rather than fact,'' our reviewer, Harold Bloom, said last year, ''but Mr. Donald's Wolfe is very real. He is something like a parody of Nietzsche.'' DONA FLOR AND HER TWO HUSBANDS: A Moral and Amorous Tale, by Jorge Amado. Translated by Harriet de Onis. (Avon, $7.95.) A Brazilian woman is in love with both of her husbands: Teodoro, the polite and civilized local pharmacist, and Vadinho, who appealed to her wilder side. Vadinho, unfortunately, is dead, but through an act of spiritual prestidigitation she has him resurrected - and gets to keep Teodoro, too. In 1969, our reviewer, David Gallagher, called the novel ''remarkable . . . for the coolness with which the author is able to impose his extraordinary characters on us. Like them, we learn to take exoticism and magic in our stride.'' During the next year, Avon will be releasing new editions of other Amado novels. In GABRIELA, CLOVE AND CINNAMON ($7.95), translated by James L. Taylor and William Grossman, a beautiful young migrant worker comes to the city and falls in love with a well-to-do restaurateur. In 1962 our reviewer, Juan de Onis, called this story of clashing subcultures ''an exciting and enjoyable romp of a book, rich in literary delights.'' THE VIOLENT LAND ($7.95), translated by Samuel Putnam, is about the men and women who flock to the forests of Bahia, hoping to make their fortunes in the cacao trade. CAPTAINS OF THE SANDS, translated by Gregory Rabassa, and SHIPS AFIRE, translated by J. J. Armas Marcelo (both $7.95), will appear for the first time in English. A PERFECT WOMAN, by Carolyn Slaughter. (Penguin, $4.95.) What good is a perfect life if you're going to die anyway, Humphrey wonders, as he proceeds to fall in love with Sylvie, who has everything that Beth, his wife, is lacking. Of course, Beth has virtues that Sylvie cannot provide. ''From the outset this darkly delicious book celebrates the power of woman,'' Lucie Prinz said in The Book Review in 1985. The novel ''has a satisfying bite and the sweet tang of just desserts.'' The same publisher has released a new edition of Carolyn Slaughter's novel THE BANQUET ($4.95), in which a man obsessed by his mother's suicide falls in love with Blossom, a seemingly perfect shop clerk. In 1984 our reviewer, Jill Grossman, called it ''a carefully modulated story of psychopathological love. . . . We know from the first page that something terrible will happen to Blossom, and it is a mark of the author's ability that what does happen is surprising, though no less appalling than what we had expected.'' THE ECONOMIC EMERGENCE OF WOMEN, by Barbara R. Bergmann. (Basic, $10.95.) Every decade since the late 19th century, more women have joined the work force. But breaking through the fossilized social structures that keep them from achieving economic equality will require Government intervention, the author believes, both in the marketplace and in the home. In 1986, Wendy Kaminer said in The Book Review that much of the material here was familiar but lucidly drawn. ''Readers can glean . . . the simple truth that family life and employment patterns for women will change together or not at all.'' The same publisher has reissued WOMEN'S WAYS OF KNOWING: The Development of Self, Voice, and Mind ($10.95). In this book, Mary Field Belenky, Blythe McVicker Clinchy, Nancy Rule Goldberger and Jill Mattuck Tarule argue that women have been suppressed, not only economically but also by an authoritarian school system that ignores an important fact: women have different ways of learning things than men. ''Like a hot pepper, the bite in this book comes after it has been consumed,'' Sara Neustadtl said here in 1986. ''The final vision of confident, knowing women makes the tragedy of those trapped in silence even more chilling.'' THE OLD DEVILS, by Kingsley Amis. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $7.95.) When the Weavers leave the literary life in London to come home to Wales, they reawaken a tangle of promiscuous liaisons among their friends who stayed behind. Last year in The Times, Michiko Kakutani said she was relieved to find that in this novel, which won Britain's Booker Prize in 1986, Kingsley Amis has moved beyond misanthropic diatribes to produce a satire that is compassionate. ''The reader is less engaged by the slapstick elements of this book than by its thougtful, even melancholy, portrayal of its characters' attempts to come to terms with the past.'' The same publisher has reissued Mr. Amis's 1984 novel STANLEY AND THE WOMEN ($6.95). THE RACHEL PAPERS, by Martin Amis. (Harmony, $7.95.) In the first novel by Martin Amis, Kingsley Amis's son, Charles Highway is determined to sleep with an older woman before he graduates from his teens. ''It takes a certain comic talent to make Charles the delectably unappetizing creature he is, and Martin Amis has it,'' Grace Glueck said here in 1974. INTIMATE PARTNERS: Patterns in Love and Marriage, by Maggie Scarf. (Ballantine, $4.95.) People often look to marriage as a way of remaking themselves and beginning their lives anew. But Maggie Scarf shows in ''Intimate Partners'' that it is likely they'll end up reliving the problems of their childhoods instead; only the arena will have changed. Last year, Carol Tavris said here that the book was not dispassionate or critical enough. But other reviewers have praised it, including one who said it explained the art of family therapy in ''straightforward, jargon-free language'' illustrated with case studies that are rendered ''with the prose of a novelist.'' THE SECRET MUSEUM: Pornography in Modern Culture, by Walter Kendrick. (Penguin, $7.95.) Pornography, Walter Kendrick writes, is as old as Pompeii, where embarrassed anthropologists found rooms adorned with lascivious frescoes. ''Mr. Kendrick writes crisply and amusingly,'' The Times's John Gross said last year. ''When he is not straining too hard, [ he ] can be highly illuminating . . . and he concludes on a satisfyingly forceful note, with a brisk dismissal of the Meese Commission report.'' SOMEBODY ELSE'S LIFE, by Morris Philipson. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) A philosophy professor with an identity crisis decides that the ticket to an authentic life is a lot of money, so he embarks on a plan to write a best seller about an art counterfeiter. Then his girlfriend persuades him that it would be more profitable to commit the imaginary crime. Last year, Benjamin DeMott said here that Morris Philipson's fifth novel ''frequently seems morally confused'' but added that he found it ''carefully plotted,'' ''readable and intermittently entertaining.'' The same publisher has reissued Mr. Philipson's novel THE WALLPAPER FOX ($7.95), about a wealthy family whose members are each, in a different way, living a lie. ''This solid and serious novel . . . raises disturbing and complicated questions about the capacity of family life to mitigate an increasingly barren modern experience,'' J. L. Crain said in The Book Review in 1976. ''The author's vision is a melancholy but compassionate one.'' ONLY WHEN I LAUGH, by Len Deighton. (Mysterious Press, $4.95.) A confidence man believes he and his cohorts are driven by a Darwinian imperative: depriving ''the stupid and the inefficient of wealth and prestige.'' Last year our reviewer, Alan Caruba, said the novel, which was published in England two decades ago, ''shows that this British writer was already a splendid storyteller. . . . Even then he displayed affection for gifted miscreants.'' THE SOCIETY OF MIND, by Marvin Minsky. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $9.95) Philosophers once begged the question of how the brain works by assuming there is a homunculus, or little person, inside. But how does the homunculus think? Marvin Minsky avoids the infinite regress that inevitably accompanies this intellectual subterfuge by supposing that the mind is a society of many different homunculi, each so simple and stupid that its behavior can be explained mechanistically. But when they interact, intelligence emerges. Last year our reviewer, James W. Lance, called this ''an ingenious and stimulating book . . . leaping from thought to thought with admirable agility.'' VALIDE: A Novel of the Harem, by Barbara Chase-Riboud. (Avon, $4.95.) A young woman captured in Martinque in the late 1700's is sold into an Ottoman sultan's harem, but she rises through the ranks to become a despotic empress. In 1986, Wendy Smith said in The Book Review that Barbara Chase-Riboud's novel is marred by ''stilted, unreal prose,'' but ''the ideas themselves are provocative. . . . [ She ] has clearly thought long and hard about slavery - what it does to the people caught up in it and, more fundamentally, what aspects of human nature its existence expresses.'' The same publisher has reprinted SALLY HEMINGS ($4.95), the author's 1979 novel about a slave who some historians maintain was Thomas Jefferson's concubine and the mother of five of his children. THE JEFFERSON SCANDALS: A Rebuttal, by Virginius Dabney. (Dodd, Mead, $9.95.) Despite what Barbara Chase-Riboud and some historians, such as Fawn M. Brodie, have written, President Jefferson did not have a black mistress, Virginius Dabney believes. ''Despite a slight tone of protesting too much, [ he ] is reasonable in his research,'' Herbert Mitgang said in The Times in 1981. ''A reader comes away with the impression that, whatever the truth may be behind the bedroom doors, Jefferson can survive both his detractors and defenders.'' MIAMI BLUES, by Charles Willeford. (Ballantine, $2.95.) After ''a blithe psychopath from California'' comes to Miami and robs a policeman of his badge, gun and dentures, the victim is determined to take revenge. In 1984, Newgate Callendar said here that Charles Willeford handled the plot ''with thorough professionalism. . . . The prose is clean and tough and flows easily.'' MIAMI: City of the Future, by T. D. Allman. (Atlantic Monthly, $5.95.) Miami, T. D. Allman writes, is now ''the coolest, hippest, hottest metropolis in the universe.'' Last year our reviewer, J. Anthony Lukas, who has written more reservedly about Boston, said that the author's hyperbolic prose was appropriate for this energetic Southern city with its drugs, pink flamingos, pastel stucco buildings and exotic Art Deco hotels. ''Sometimes it seems this whole damn book is adjectives. . . . Some of Mr. Allman's best pages are about [ Florida's ] most fantastical phenomena.'' BOLT, by Dick Francis. (Fawcett Crest, $4.95.) In another of Dick Francis' mysteries about horse racing, a jockey named Kit Fielding must save his career, his fiancee and her family from various evils. ''The result is a novel that races along with all the alacrity of one of Kit's mounts,'' Mel Watkins said in The Book Review last year. ''A subtle twist at the end makes the jaunt all the more enjoyable.'' WHERE IS NICARAGUA? by Peter Davis. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) During two visits to Nicaragua, in 1983 and 1986, Peter Davis was struck by the interplay between the Sandinistas' revolutionary experiment and the manner in which it is perceived by people in the United States. The author ''advances his argument not by polemical thrust but by color, juxtaposition and tactful analysis,'' Jefferson Morley said here last year. ''Amateurs like Mr. Davis seem to be able to capture Central America in a way that Central America professionals rarely do.'' BEHIND THE FRONT PAGE: A Candid Look at How the News Is Made, by David S. Broder. (Touchstone/ Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) The Washington Post political reporter David S. Broder believes there is something perverse about the journalist's self-imposed exile - the wish to remain apart from ''the most profound experiences of your friends, your neighbors, your city, or your nation. We are voyeurs, not participants.'' Last year our reviewer, Thomas Griffith, said he liked the way Mr. Broder ''avoids being holier than his colleagues. . . . He writes in sprightly, anecdotal fashion, but a melancholy awareness . . . suffuses this honest book.'' WALKING ACROSS EGYPT, by Clyde Edgerton. (Ballantine, $3.95.) Mattie Rigsbee, an elderly widow, becomes entangled with a thief, a dogcatcher and other eccentric North Carolina denizens. Last year our reviewer, Kathryn Morton, who admired the author's first novel, ''Raney,'' said this one got off to a slow start but ultimately redeemed itself. THE FIRST THREE MINUTES: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe, by Steven Weinberg. (Basic, $7.95.) Drawing on discoveries in cosmology and particle theory, a Nobel laureate in physics attempts to reconstruct how the universe might have been just after the big bang. In 1977 one reviewer called the book, which has been updated, ''science writing at its best. There is no sacrifice of accuracy for sensational effects, at the same time the difficult mathematics is kept to a minimum.'' A YELLOW RAFT IN BLUE WATER, by Michael Dorris. (Warner, $7.95.) By telling the story of a Montana Indian family three times - through the eyes of a young woman, her mother and her grandmother - Michael Dorris reveals, layer by layer, how it feels to live in a society that is slowly being eroded by television and other devices of cultural conquest. Last year Anatole Broyard said here that Mr. Dorris's first novel ''realizes one of the extravagant dreams of anthropology -to describe a dying culture almost as if you were dying with it.'' SAMURAI AND SILK: A Japanese and American Heritage, by Haru Matsukata Reischauer. (Belknap/ Harvard University, $10.95.) One of Haru Matsukata Reischauer's grandfathers was a Japanese silk magnate, the other a member of the ruling samurai class who became a prime minister. The story of these men and their descendants has resulted in ''a very entertaining and interesting book,'' Ian Buruma said in The Book Review in 1986. The author ''has succeeded in bringing alive some of the people who shaped modern Japan.'' TEMPORARY SHELTER, by Mary Gordon. (Ballantine, $3.95.) When this collection of 20 fatalistic tales of vulnerable, depressed women was published last year, Rachel Billington said in The Book Review that the short story can be ''a testing ground for any novelist, particularly one whose talents lie rather in conveying the intimacies of a woman's mind than in any stylistic finesse.'' Still, she found ''some stories that are touching, and some that are memorable.'' ROBERT KENNEDY: A Memoir, by Jack Newfield. (Plume/New American Library, $7.95.) Twenty years after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, no other white leader offers as much hope of revitalizing American liberalism as Kennedy did, Jack Newfield writes in a new introduction to this biography. In 1969 our reviewer, Larry L. King, called this ''a perceptive and moving book'' that ''brings to Kennedy's personality those shadings, complexities and internal furies that would have made him a great character in fiction.'' The same publisher has reissued Kennedy's 1969 book THIRTEEN DAYS: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis ($3.95).",1988-04-17T05:00:00+0000

Back in 1948 it took fewer than 300 journalists and technicians, and what they provided was carried by four networks to 18 stations in nine cities. Although radio had never attempted it, television began with gavel-to-gavel coverage, not because it was noble, but because it was cheaper than providing entertainment from studios in New York. Television was not yet profitable. But making television sets was, and two of the networks were owned by set makers, NBC by RCA, and DuMont by DuMont, a David among Goliaths both as network and manufacturer. As well as the manufacturers, the major parties wanted television coverage, and broadcasting is a federally licensed business. So broadcasting, with its profits and its heart in radio, agreed to television coverage, and the parties agreed to meet in the same city to make it easier, in Philadelphia, where the coaxial cable meets the Schuylkill.",1988-04-17T05:00:00+0000

You don't know the half of it. Los Angeles is far more weird than any run-of-the-mill tourist can know. How many have seen the porno theater in the shape of a Mayan temple, the giant pig murals of Vernon, the rocket ship tombstone of Hollywood Memorial Park, the religious radio station in the shape of a 1930's ocean liner and the mausoleum so ornate that the staff hands out picture postcards?

us,THE FITNESS QUEST,"EVENTUALLY, EVERY PERSON who exercises seriously begins to search for the single, perfect fitness activity. But this search is bound to be frustrating. Running, for example, provides superb aerobic conditioning, can be done most anywhere with minimal equipment and is either a solo or group activity. But over time it takes a terrible toll on the knees, shins, ankles and feet, and it does little for the upper body. Racquet sports provide good aerobic exercise, but they require courts, companions, carefully meshed schedules and good hand-eye coordination. Cycling is an excellent aerobic activity, but it largely ignores the upper body and can torture vulnerable knees. Aerobic dancing will quickly get the heart rate up, but even the newer low-impact variety can damage knees and leg tendons. Swimming is also aerobic and places minimal stress on joints, but it requires a nearby body of water, heated in the winter, and dressing rooms. Skiing, particularly cross-country skiing, is at the top of the aerobic fitness activity list. But snow is, of course, essential, unless you work out on a skiing machine.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"UPLIFT THE RACE: The Construction of ''School Daze.'' By Spike Lee with Lisa Jones. (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, $9.95.) ''What is ''School Daze'' then? Maybe it's just a Spike Lee Joint,'' muses the film maker in this fascinating account co-written with Lisa Jones, a second assistant director on the new film. Mr. Lee won big with his first feature film, the low-budget ''She's Gotta Have It.'' With ''School Daze,'' he faces the pleasures and pains of big-time movie making with characteristic -and engaging - bravado. ''Uplift the Race'' comprises both the uncut screenplay of ''School Daze'' and a remarkably candid series of interviews with the film's cast and crew. Those interviewed speak freely of the difficulties caused by the relative inexperience of the crew and of mishaps both serious and silly, such as the time a crucial sweater is accidentally packed up and almost shipped to Los Angeles. They also talk about their enormous enthusiasm for the film and their belief in Mr. Lee's vision. The crew (Mr. Lee among them) also discuss the internecine struggles and the racial tensions that sprang up on that rarest of things in Hollywood: a predominantly black sound stage. One of the white crew members even reports his annoyance at being asked for the white perspective, wondering, ''Am I the quintessential white person?'' - a statement many black readers will find ironic. Despite the tensions and pressures of putting ''School Daze'' together, the book ends on a note of exhilaration and affirmation.",1988-04-17T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"DOCTOR ZAY. By Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. (Feminist Press, $8.95.) ''Doctor Zay,'' originally published in 1882, is a love story with rural Maine as its background. Waldo Yorke is a spoiled, wealthy young man from Boston, who meets with a severe accident while traveling along the ''wild Maine coast''; Dr. Zay is the brilliant physician who attends his recovery. The story is told largely from the young man's point of view; he moves from shock and horror at the initial discovery that his doctor is a woman, to respect and fascination as he slowly recuperates and watches her in action, to passionate love. Most of the book takes place during Waldo's convalescence; the scenes of medical practice in a rural place are detailed and very affecting, as Dr. Zay pits herself against infant mortality, against accidents and disease, against the harsh realities of the life lived by her patients. Her own life is hard but full; this novel does an unusually good job of communicating the kinds of frustrations and satisfactions that make up a specific vocation. Waldo strives to become worthy of Dr. Zay, only to find himself brought up against a new problem: she will not give up her profession; she is not sure she can marry at all. She tells him: ''You have been so unfortunate as to become interested in a new kind of woman. The trouble is that a happy marriage with such a woman demands a new type of man.'' Phelps does a superb job of writing dialogue that allows for the discussion of the problems central to this novel, while remaining true to her characters, engaging and frequently funny. Waldo and Dr. Zay are both appealing people; it is fascinating to watch them struggle with hard choices in a world that does not feel at all far away.",1988-04-17T05:00:00+0000

The closest thing to it on Amtrak is the All Aboard America fare, which permits a limited number of journeys but can save money.

Marvin Camras invented magnetic recording for a cousin who liked to sing in the bathtub. Paul MacCready devised the featherweight Gossamer Condor man-powered plane for a competition because he needed the prize money. Bob Gundlach, who helped perfect xerography (photocopying), likes to create devices that other engineers have decided can't be built. On the other hand, the idea of the laser ''suddenly popped into'' Gordon Gould's head one Saturday night in the fall of 1957. The 15 men and one woman whom Kenneth A. Brown selected range in educational level from high school to Ph.D's; their works run from the pacemaker to the plastic soda bottle. Yet Franklin and Edison would recognize the way these people combine inspiration and practicality, cross conventional disciplines, trust their intuitions and enjoy the occasional moment when the perfect solution comes in ''a flash.'' Under the intelligent questioning of Mr. Brown, who has a degree in geology and has worked as a reporter, they dutifully suggest ways to increase America's declining patenting power, and confess to worrying about ever-increasing hindrances to creativity deriving from the patent law system, the government regulatory apparatus and obtuse corporations.

He could have plugged in a harmonizer or a fuzzbox, or run his vocals through modulators and filters.

A good infantry officer must be aggressively courageous, full of initiative, ruthless in pursuit of his mission and lacking in introspection. Oliver North is a prime example of the type, and so is Michael Lee Lanning, who became, at 23, one of the youngest American company commanders in the Vietnam War. His experiences as platoon leader were the subject of ''The Only War We Had,'' published last year; this volume has appeared to complete the story. Mr. Lanning served first in the booby-trapped rice paddies of the Mekong Delta, then in the jungles farther north. His talents were appreciated by both enlisted men and the higher command: he took few casualties while inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Loving the sense of brotherhood and power that came with leading men in combat, he kept a journal to record the events of what still seems to him to have been the most vital and interesting period of his life. Attention is focused resolutely on surface details, with no introspective pondering of what it all meant. He tells of the joy he felt in taking an enemy's life, his pride in the skill and blood-thirstiness of his men and the contempt he felt for all Vietnamese. Mr. Lanning has not written a work of art, but instead has given one of the most honest and horrifying accounts of a combat soldier's life to come out of the Vietnam War.",1988-04-17T05:00:00+0000

Unions at the company's Eastern Air Lines unit recently won a court order blocking Texas Air's plan to take the profitable East Coast shuttle operations away from Eastern. The Government contended that Texas Air, which has cash holdings of $850 million, was charging large fees for providing services to its airlines and might be diverting resources from the carriers. Texas Air's other big carrier, Continental, has had heavy losses and recently had to borrow money from Texas Air. Aviation officials stressed that the safety situation was not alarming.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE TALL DARK ALIBI. By Carol Jerina. (Charter/Berkley, $3.95.) This slim, good-natured romp is a textbook example of television's indelible impact on the contemporary novel. Perhaps Ms. Jerina gives the game away when her heroine, a neophyte private eye, says that her work is ''more like 'Magnum' and 'Moonlighting' '' than the rumpled detective story of yesteryear. Young, feisty Jillian Fletcher unwittingly becomes part of a murder case when she bumps into an accused killer. Simultaneously, she comes under the tutelage of Jackson Fury, a rednecked, tight-jeaned, gray-eyed P.I., who agrees to help her bag the real villain. Jackson fruitlessly tries to bed the recalcitrant Jillian, a virgin with a weakness for sexy lingerie (Ms. Jerina seems positively preoccupied with underwear, which provides a lacy leitmotif for the novel). The book includes a complement of the usual suspects, a batch of convenient coincidences and some rather unlikely slip-ups on the part of the 10-year veteran detective, Fury. ''The Tall, Dark Alibi'' smoothly captures the slick, superficial banter of prime-time sleuthing, unfortunately at the expense of strong characterization and narrative. True, the novel's flaws sometimes work in its favor; Ms. Jerina's snappy dialogue keeps the story moving at a breezy clip, and if the main characters were given depth they would be appealing, especially Jillian, whose purposeful stride is interrupted with believable bouts of doubt and vulnerability. Played by the right actors, Jack and Jill might make a pretty entertaining movie of the week - and there's the rub. A book shouldn't depend on its casting.",1988-04-17T05:00:00+0000

Unser, who will turn 26 tomorrow, picked up his fifth Indy-car victory and his first since the 1986 season finale at Miami. Bobby Rahal, the two-time defending CART-PPG champion, finished second, one lap and 33.482 seconds behind the winner's Chevrolet-powered March. Unser, who came back this year to the team owned by Rick Galles after a three-year stint with Doug Shierson, gave Galles only his second Indy-car victory and his first since Unser won at Portland, Ore., in June 1984. The winner averaged 83.655 miles an hour in the 95-lap, 158.65-mile race. Unser won $91,160. Raul Boesel of Brazil, who replaced Unser on the Shierson team, finished fourth and now leads the season standing after two races, with 22 points. Going into the next event, the Indianapolis 500 on May 29, Unser is tied for second with Mario Andretti, who had won three of the first four Indy-car races in Long Beach, including last year's.

Labonte, in a Chevrolet, had been trailing Earnhardt throughout much of the race, but passed the two-time defending Winston Cup points champion and went on to win by 1.49 seconds over Ricky Rudd, who was in a Buick. Earnhardt, also in a Chevrolet, had to settle for third place after leading 265 of the 400 laps. Despite his third-place finish, Earnhardt increased his lead in the season standing, with 1,059 points.(AP) School Basketball Mourning Helps East Win: Alonzo Mourning's 16 points and Billy Owens's 14 rebounds led the East to a 105-99 victory over the West in the McDonald's All-American game yesterday in Albuquerque, N.M. The 11th edition of the game featured some of the nation's best high school players, most headed for major-college powers in the fall. Mourning, the 6-foot-10-inch, 230-pound center from Chesapeake, Va., who will attend Georgetown, hit a pair of late second-half dunks as the East held off a West rally. Owens, a 6-8 forward from Carlisle, Pa., who has signed with Syracuse, added 10 points and shared the game's most valuable player award with Mourning. The West was led by Kentucky-bound Shawn Kemp with 18 points and 9 rebounds. Malik Sealy of Tolentine in the Bronx scored 12 points. Robert Werdann, who played for Archbishop Malloy in Queens, added 11. Sealy and Werdann will attend St. John's next fall. (AP) Soccer Victory for Trinidad and Tobago: Dexter Skeene, who played for Columbia University, scored a second-half goal yesterday as Trinidad and Tobago beat Guyana, 4-0, at Georgetown, Guyana, in the first match of qualifying for soccer's 1990 World Cup. Skeene, an all-American in 1985 during his senior year at Columbia, scored 10 minutes into the second half to make it 3-0. The two teams will meet again May 8 in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. The team that wins the series by total goals will advance to the second round against Honduras.

It is also a venture of the French Institute/Alliance Francaise, an organization sustained by francophilic Americans for over 75 years. Saturday's music was, appropriately, ''Des Canyons aux Etoiles'' a Frenchman's elaborate orchestral hymn to the geological wonder of the American West. It was commissioned by Alice Tully in the early 1970's, played on Saturday by New York musicians (the Orchestra of St. Luke's) and conducted by a young American, Kent Nagano.

And other track and field candidates for the British Olympic team will also be anxious to hear the British Amateur Athletic Board's decision on the Budd case. On Saturday, the board was told by the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the sport's governing body, to bar Budd for at least 12 months or face banishment of British track and field athletes from all international events, including the Olympic Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. The federation was reacting to warnings that other African nations, in opposition to apartheid, South Africa's official system of racial separation, might boycott the Olympics if Budd was permitted to compete. Budd, who was born in South Africa, has been a British subject since 1984. ''There are 23 other Olympic sports, but of course athletics is the centerpiece,'' Charles Palmer, the chairman of the British Olympic Association, referring to track and field. ''I am not about to impose a decision on the B.A.A.B. I want to give them time to sort their thoughts out.'' John Bryant, Budd's coach, said yesterday that he would seek legal advice for Budd. ''The B.A.A.B. knows how we feel,'' he said. ''They know what they should do: back Zola against this blackmail.'' Also speaking out in support of Budd was Hugh Jones, the British marathon runner. ''She should be backed all the way,'' he said. ''I'm willing to take suspension. If they fail to back Zola, the B.A.A.B. is completely spineless and without principle.''",1988-04-19T05:00:00+0000

''We didn't play one good game,'' he said. ''In other seasons, you could pretty well see what went wrong, but that's a different bunch in there now.'' Torrey said he had no plans to dismiss Terry Simpson, who completed his second season with a first-place divisional finish, the team's first in four years.

The attacks began when U.S. ships destroyed two Iranian oil platforms as retaliation for the mining that damaged a U.S. ship last week. Page A1 Congressional support for retaliation against Iran is broad. After consultation with the Administration, Congressional leaders said President Reagan would not be pressed to invoke the War Powers Act. A1 Washington condemned the killing of Khalil al-Wazir as a political assassination but said it had no information about who was responsible. The State Department said the U.S. Government was not involved. A1 The Israeli Army imposed curfews on 20 refugee districts in the occupied territories to block any protests over the assassination of Khalil al-Wazir. Soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. A12 Syria offered to allow the funeral of Khalil al-Wazir, the slain P.L.O. military chief, to take place in Damascus. The offer could improve relations between President Hafez al-Assad and the P.L.O. A12 John Demjanjuk was convicted of war crimes by an Israeli court. The court found that the retired auto worker from Cleveland was a guard at the Treblinka death camp during World War II. A1 The Afghan war's effects in Pakistan are blamed for violence and the flow of drugs. But some consider Pakistan's problems the result of growing poverty and population and the lack of a sense of nationhood. A4 China will restrict tourism to Tibet, in the wake of last month's riots by Buddhist monks, according to a U.S. official who visited Tibet and met with Chinese and Tibetan officials. A5 Debate over social policy in Britain is at a boil as Parliament prepares to vote on a new system of local taxes aimed at bringing the poor, the unemployed and those on welfare onto the tax lists. A6 Panama's farmers face a crisis because they cannot get credit to begin the spring planting. The cash shortage caused by U.S. sanctions against Gen. Manuel Noriega threatens agricultural self-sufficiency. A15 National A18-29 A Federal fund to insure deposits at savings and loan associations had liabilities exceeding assests by $11.6 billion at the end of 1987. A $10.8 billion package Congress passed will not cover losses in the thrift industry. A1 A Presidential panel on airline safety recommended making the Federal Aviation Administration an independent agency to oversee the airline industry, with a new ''safety czar.'' A1 Presentation of a prize for religion will be postponed while the sponsors of the award, the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, investigate charges that the recipient, Inamullah Khan, supports anti-Semitism. A18 The parental rights of unwed fathers will be considered by the Supreme Court. It agreed to hear the appeal of a California man who was denied the right to see his daughter after the mother placed the child with a foster family. A22 Bennett says Stanford was intimidated into changing course A18 Chyrsler proposes to tie bonuses of officers to profit-sharing plan A18 Ethics of some Pentagon advisors criticized A24 Politics A26-27 The New York Presidential primary today could decide the nomination for the Democratic Party or leave the race unsettled until after the last primaries, in California and New Jersey on June 7. A1 Albert Gore Jr. campaigned with Mayor Koch, who has endorsed the Senator's Democratic Presidential campaign. Mr. Gore needs 20 percent of the vote here or in Pennsylvania to again receive Federal matching funds. A26 Jesse Jackson talked about hate at a campaign appearance and accused Mayor Koch of being devisive. Mr. Jackson said he had received more death threats in New York than in the other Democratic Presidential primaries. A26 Michael Dukakis was confident on the eve of the New York primary and said he was looking forward to victory. But Mr. Dukakis's aides worried about voter turnout and presented the primary as a close race with Jesse Jackson A26. Washington Talk A28 At Mall, battle of the museums Regional B1-5 Charges of dumping pesticides where they could harm people were brought against a greenhouse operator in upstate New York. Gerardus deWit became the first person indicted under a new state law. B1 Repairs on 32 New York City bridges have closed or partly closed the structures. The serial closings, more frequent now, have become a symptom of neglect in maintenance and repair, according to officials. B1 Weekday commuter ferry service began between Brooklyn and Manhattan to help ease traffic congestion caused by the closing of the Williamsburg Bridge. Turnout was light on the hastily-organized service. B4 Connecticut will draw on reserves in its new budget, which legislators are expected to approve. Some fear that the budget, which does not include new taxes, is the beginning of the end of the state's economic boom. B1 Disagreement on a minority jobs bill is delaying agreement on the New York State budget. Democrats and Republicans disagree on how much business contractors must do with companies owned by minorities and women. B3 Evidence in the trial of Mario Biaggi indicated that he owned stock in the Wedtech Corporation.

The company said latest first quarter results reflect strong performances in foreign exchange trading and trading account activities, as well as increases in fees and commissions, partially offset by a decline in gains from the sales of investment securities. The company also said contributing to the latest first quarter results were a lower provision for possible credit losses and only moderately increased operating expenses. The continuing nonaccrual status of medium- and long-term cross-border outstandings to borrowers in Brazil and Ecuador reduced first quarter 1988 net interest income by $53 million ($32 million after taxes) and reduced first quarter 1987 net interest income by $66 million ($37 million after taxes).

This is the paradox that presents itself in three exhibitions that make Mr. Sultan's work abundantly visible in New York right now. A survey of his paintings and charcoal drawings from the 1980's is on view at the Brooklyn Museum, while at the Museum of Modern Art there is a small show devoted to prints of his signatory image of poisoned fecundity, the ''black lemon.'' At the artist's home base, the Blum Helman Gallery, there is a new variation on his dark spheres: ''black egg'' drawings. Walking through these shows, the popular Wendy's commercials of yesteryear come to mind, the question being not so much ''where's the beef?'' as ''where's the juice?''

They tried to sleep by squeezing beneath the seats. 1 China will not back an arms embargo against Iran after the clashes between American and Iranian naval forces, officials said. The Chinese message was in reply to a request by the Reagan Administration. 1 Israel decided to kill a P.L.O. official because army and intelligence officials believed he was directing the uprising in the occupied territories, according to Israelis with access to Government officials. 6 The funeral for the P.L.O. official, Abu Jihad, was held in Damascus, Syria, to protest an American plan for peace in the Middle East and to slight King Hussein of Jordan, Palestinian leaders said. 6 Mikhail S. Gorbachev criticized President Reagan's approach toward Moscow as becoming confrontational. He told Secretary of State George P. Shultz that this could jeopardize improvements in U.S.-Soviet relations. 1 Yegor K. Ligachev appeared with the Politburo at a ceremony marking Lenin's birth a day after he was said to have been all but removed as the No. 2 Communist Party official and ordered to go on vacation. 1 Afghan refugees are reluctant to return home. Some refugees say they see little difference between the current Government and the Soviet troops, who are to be withdrawn, and they disparage the guerrilla leadership. 4 The French presidential campaign has stirred little excitement in Blois, a town that does not often stray from national political trends. Seven years ago, a slight majority of voters favored Francois Mitterand. 3 Four top executives of a French machine-tool company were arrested and charged earlier this week with selling sophisticated milling machinery to the Soviet military, according to French and American officials. 37 Argentina is likely to halt work on atom power plant 2 Contras getting U.S. arms, Ortega says 3 NATIONAL 8-11, 32 A pilot shortage at Eastern Airlines is disrupting the carrier's schedules and causing it to cancel flights. The shortage may force Eastern to reduce its service on major routes, analysts and airline officials say. 1 The maker of an anti-acne medicine rebutted an estimate by Government scientists that the drug Accutane may have caused up to 1,300 birth defects. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., said the estimate was ''flawed.'' 1 Agreement on a halt in stock trading during wild swings is close at hand between the New York Stock Exchange, other exhanges and Government officials. Some experts do not think it would work. 1 Japanese purchases of U.S. timber in the Pacific Northwest have caused a shortage for American lumber mills. Japanese construction firms are willing to pay prices far above American market rates. 8 Confidence in the Attorney General was expressed by President Reagan, who responded ''no'' when asked whether Edwin Meese 3d should resign. He said the Justice Department was operating ''just fine.'' 8 The IRS revoked tax-exempt status of the PTL television ministry and said contributions to the organization were no longer tax deductable. The IRS says PTL owes more than $55 million in taxes. 8 A list of potential trial witnesses in the Iran-contra case includes the major national security officials in the Administration but omits Vice President Bush and President Reagan.

Fewer people are going into the profession even as information services are expanding. 33 Skyscraper envy in Hartford is so great that three developers are racing to build the tallest building in New England. One designer increased the height of his building because it was 35 feet too short. 33 Girl Scouts are protesting a decision by the national organization to divide the Hudson County, N.J., council between two others.

Mizener, Hemingway said, had done a better job than most members of the profession: ''Almost as good as the job they did on my father's face when he shot himself.

Ethnic communities here are magnets for the music of the old country and nothing, except perhaps the smell of home cooking, stirs memories and reinforces roots like local music. Now, in the age of jet travel, the world is local. And across New York City are clubs where musicians from all over the world - some internationally known, some well-kept community secrets - can perform as if neither they nor their listeners had ever left home. That makes globe-hopping as easy as stepping through the door of a club, especially on Saturday nights, when places are full and lively and a stranger can get swept up in a crowd where English is rarely spoken. Forget the passports and the airline reservations (but do phone ahead for current information); at these clubs, you can travel by ear. DESERT SONGS",1988-04-24T05:00:00+0000

Lying in her hospital bed, riddled with cancer, Naomi tells her daughter Beth, the narrator of this ably written first novel, ''I just want it to be next week. . . It's what your father and I say to each other whenever we have to do something we don't want to do. We say we wish it was next week. Then it would be over. Sometimes I think we've wished our whole lives away like that.'' It's Christmas time, and Beth, her younger brother Billy, and her older brother and sister, Grim and Sharon, have been summoned by their father, Hersh, to await their mother's death. As the days creep by, Beth leads us from the hospital coffee shop to her parents' Tudor house in affluent suburban New Jersey - and down the splayed path of memory as well. Here she maps out the Asher family politics: Grim, a philosophy professor, and Sharon, a charmless city lawyer, versus the ne'er-do-well younger children, Billy and Beth. Beth never quite makes peace with Naomi, and when her mother finally dies the release that Beth feels is dispiritingly banal. Her coming of age, it turns out, is the novel's main concern - though instead of going on 16, the protagonist here is pushing 40. Unfortunately, Beth and the rest of the book's many characters remain mired in stereotype. Michele Orwin is adept at propelling her tightly knit story along, and she's especially good at capturing the humorous kvetching of Beth's relatives. What ''Waiting for Next Week'' fails to capture, however, is the reader's imagination.",1988-04-24T05:00:00+0000

That tenacity is pervasive in Mr. Fugard's work, from the earliest plays through his most recent, ''A Place With the Pigs.''

President Reagan, in a stand backed by many business groups, has said he will veto a bill that includes the notice provision. The rest of the bill encompasses the most sweeping trade legislation in 14 years. Among other things, it calls for investigations to uncover ''pervasive'' unfair trade practices and for retaliation against countries that persist in them. The bill would increase benefits to industries and workers whose livelihoods are damaged by imports.

He says that the British spent $600 and yet their health-care system is ''sophisticated and modern'' and that life expectancy is ''at least as high as in the United States. . . .'' This, however, obscures the fact that a British citizen with chronic debilitating pain resulting from, for example, end-stage hip disease, may have to suffer for years waiting for surgery.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"STORIES: Five Acre Virgin and The Travelling Entertainer. By Elizabeth Jolley. (Viking, $17.95.) Reading Elizabeth Jolley is a bit like listening to your favorite grandmother, the one who is wise and funny and a little bit demented, the one who keeps track of all the cousins and can see all of human nature in a family reunion or a day at the beach. As with any good grandmother, Ms. Jolley's sympathies are always with the underdog - the lonely immigrant, the plain girl, the cleaning woman, the old man in the nursing home - and her wonderful characters often reappear, slightly altered, at different times and in different stories. Manipulated by clever landladies and selfish relatives, they nevertheless manage to survive and occasionally triumph. Ms. Jolley, an Australian, is perhaps best known in this country for a series of recent comic novels, including ''Miss Peabody's Inheritance'' and ''Foxybaby.'' ''Stories,'' a new volume of 21 tales, comprises her first two short-story collections (''Five Acre Virgin'' and ''The Travelling Entertainer''). They too are essentially comic, although there is an underlying sadness in them: things often turn out badly, particularly children. Australia puts in a major appearance; not the country but the very land itself - fertile, consoling and reliable in a way that people seldom are. A large part of Ms. Jolley's charm is her style, which is conversational, a bit faux naive, but as sharp and clear as a primitive painting. What is not grandmotherly is the precise literary intelligence and masterly technique Ms. Jolley brings to her work; she is an artist of the first order.",1988-04-24T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE MARTYR. By Jurgen Petschull. Translated by Stephen G. Cappellari. (Mercury House, $18.95.) On the jacket of ''The Martyr'' there is a description, meant to promote the book, that unintentionally reveals what's wrong with it: ''Reality is so deftly interwoven with fiction that it is a challenge to distinguish where one stops and the other begins.'' Jurgen Petschull, a West German journalist, has produced one of those ambitious but difficult to pull off capers that used to be called New Journalism. Or was it New Fiction? Not that it matters, since this particular hybrid isn't satisfying as either journalism or fiction. ''The Martyr'' is based on the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jet to Beirut during which an American military man was murdered by Arab terrorists. Mr. Petschull has fictionalized the principal characters in this drama: the chief terrorist, the air crew, the American agents who, in this version, succeed in capturing their foe. The terrorist is conveniently given a great motive: a misguided volley from the U.S.S. New Jersey had killed his wife and child, who were visiting Beirut. But for all that, he's still a cardboard character: he murders a young American, but we get no hint of what he's thinking as he does so. Ronald Reagan also appears in full command, asking calm, incisive questions - odd characterization, at best, when Mr. Petschull could have learned from the newspapers that this was a time when White House aides were in the basement making deals with Iranians to free hostages. Given all this, it's not surprising that the fictionalized ending of Mr. Petschull's stiffly translated book is predictable and implausible. And if, as the book says, the author believes Bandar Abbas to be an Iranian harbor on the Indian Ocean, I wouldn't hire him for an operation moving a bale of feathers or a handful of microdots - or anything else.",1988-04-24T05:00:00+0000

Of any neighborhood in Australia, St. Kilda, situated on one of Melbourne's sunny downtown beaches, is the one with the greatest number of artistic associations, embodying all the contradictions of Australian urban life. The district, the closest thing to an Australian bohemia, is noted for its mix of punk-rockers and tourists, prostitutes and drug abusers, as well as Australia's largest Jewish population. From the ''Angry Penguins'' art movement of the late 1930's and 40's to the New Wave art scene of the early 80's, it has also supported a variety of artistic factions. In the words of the painter Jenny Watson, ''this is our East Village.'' But the sense of real conflict, as well as the infusions of big money that characterized New York's East Village art scene until very recently, is missing here.

us,Where Spies Went to Be Seen,"In the 19th century, whenever East met West in the Orient, it happened in a hotel. The spacious establishments, with their plush public rooms and shady verandas, occupied a special place in the closed societies of the East. Not only did they offer the European traveler an introduction to the exotic Orient amid the security of Western-style comforts, they served as neutral territory where local officials could entertain colonial interlopers. In these outposts of Western civilization, they were social hubs, places of fashion and intrigue where diplomats, politicians, journalists and spies could rub shoulders and be seen. Some of the mystique of these elegant Old World hostelries has been recaptured in a lavish volume, GRAND ORIENTAL HOTELS (Vendome, $60). Though it is principally a picture book - there are over 250 pages of period photographs, as well as copies of hotel menus, postcards, maps and note paper -three brief, well-written essays provide a lively introduction to the illustrations. These engaging, anecdotal pieces are the work of Martin Meade, a lecturer at the Ecole Speciale d'Architecture in Paris; Joseph Fitchett, a correspondent for The International Herald Tribune; and Anthony Lawrence, formerly the Far East correspondent for the BBC. The graphic artist Marc Walter and the picture researcher Catherine Donzel (who also collaborated on ''Grand Hotels'') have produced an unusually beautiful book. It celebrates the romantic symbols of a bygone colonial era while at the same time underscoring the cultural hubris these ''opulent tourist palaces'' came to represent.",1988-04-24T05:00:00+0000
us,New & Noteworthy,"FUNNY SAUCE, by Delia Ephron. (Penguin, $3.95.) With all the messy entanglements caused by divorce, remarriage and joint custody, the humorist Delia Ephron writes, the term ''extended family'' now often applies to a mismatched group of mostly unrelated people who are forced to tolerate one another's existence. ''It's a pleasure to report that 'Funny Sauce' won't lead to heartburn, despite the acid wit that's one of its ingredients - only to chortles and nods of recognition,'' Cyra McFadden said here in 1986. Penguin has also published a paperback edition of Ms. Ephron's book HOW TO EAT LIKE A CHILD: And Other Lessons in Not Being a Grown-up ($3.95), a collection of humor pieces illustrated by Edward Koren. PRESUMED INNOCENT, by Scott Turow. (Warner, $4.95.) When a deputy prosecutor investigates the murder of the beautiful colleague he loved, he finds the case ensnared in ambiguous political connections. ''This sordid, big-city murder story has the delicious closed quality of the classic country-house mystery, in which anybody from the butler to the visiting Russian cousin might have committed the crime,'' our reviewer, Anne Rice, said last year. ''From page 1, the book consciously transcends the murder-mystery genre, combining whodunit suspense with an elegant style and philosophical voice.'' The same publisher has reissued Mr. Turow's ONE L ($4.50), an account of his first year at Harvard Law School. The book ''is compelling in its vivid portrayal of the high-tension competitiveness [ and ] group madness it seems to induce,'' P. M. Stern said here in 1977. ''It is important because it offers an inside look at what law students do and don't learn and who they are and are not equipped to represent when they graduate.'' THAT NIGHT, by Alice McDermott. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) When the mother of a pregnant Long Island teen-ager refuses to let her see her hoodlum boyfriend, a war breaks out in suburbia. Last year, our reviewer, David Leavitt, found the story pleasantly surprising. ''What distinguishes this novel from the mass of literature that takes on the barely middle-class suburban experience is the almost baroque richness of [ Alice ] McDermott's sentences, the intellectual complexity of her moral vision and the explicit emotion of her voice. 'That Night' gloriously rejects the notion that this betrayed and bankrupt world can be rendered only in the spare, impersonal prose that has become the standard of so much contemporary fiction.'' IN THE SHADOW OF THE POORHOUSE: A Social History of Welfare in America, by Michael B. Katz. (Basic, $11.95.) One of the problems with this country's welfare system, Michael B. Katz writes, is that too many political leaders like to believe that people can always find jobs if they really want to - a position that impedes the formation of what the author declares should be a coherent welfare policy. In 1986, Ann Grimes said here that this history ''lends perspective to a domestic debate that has raged fitfully in America for nearly two centuries.'' FALSE ENTRY, by Hortense Calisher. (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, $9.95.) The son of a London seamstress grows up in the South, where his search for an identity becomes all the more confused when he masquerades as a witness at a Ku Klux Klan murder trial. In 1961, our reviewer, A. S. Morris, said Hortense Calisher's first novel is a ''brave and major book, with many of its scenes drawn to the measure of a masterpiece.'' The same publisher is reprinting THE NEW YORKERS ($10.95), Ms. Calisher's novel about a judge who must shield his daughter, Ruth (who also appears in ''False Entry''), from the fact that she killed her mother after finding her in the company of another man. BLACK KNIGHT, WHITE KNIGHT, by Gloria Vanderbilt. (Fawcett, $4.50.) When the second volume of Gloria Vanderbilt's autobiography was published last year, Nora Johnson said here that ''it's hard to feel sorry for the young and beautiful heiress. . . . Ms. Vanderbilt's theme of a child seeking love from an unloving parent and then, somehow, marrying reflections of that parent has been told before. But her painful awareness of this hidden force results in a unique, very personal and haunting tale.'' TRUANTS, by Ron Carlson. (Norton, $7.95.) Two young runaways and a lonely old man meet in the desert and form a family, which, while it lasts, is better than the ones they have left behind. Ron Carlson ''presents all of this in an affecting manner, with a very decent heart and a tart tongue,'' Barry Yourgrau said here in 1981. ''He practices a kind of wit that is at once tender, canny and vivid, capable of burnishing a passing moment with a quick touch.'' THE FABULOUS LUNTS: A Biography of Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, by Jared Brown. (Atheneum, $14.95.) After meeting in 1919 and marrying two years later, the actors Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne appeared together on stage more than 100 times. ''Like most great artists, the Lunts aimed for an art that was seamless,'' Margaret Croyden said in The Book Review in 1986. Jared Brown's ''impressive, definitive biography . . . reveals the meticulous craftsmanship underlying all their performances.'' TIME CAPSULE, by Mitch Berman. (Ballantine, $3.95.) In the aftermath of atomic destruction, a saxophonist befriends an engineer, and they spend a nuclear winter together. ''Mitch Berman's prose is risky and phonic, emanating from the horn of jazz,'' Fanny Howe said here last year. ''He has humor and is thorough, beyond the call of duty, in transcribing nuclear destruction.''",1988-04-24T05:00:00+0000

Cuban Catholics had invited the New York archbishop to visit for a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Rev. Felix Varela, a priest who opposed Spanish colonial rule. He said his three-hour meeting with Mr. Castro was ''very rational and very amiable.''

Only when paperback books displaced magazines as the principal outlet for new science fiction did the novel replace the short story as the genre's standard narrative form. But evolution is not necessarily progress. A short story can compel our attention if it does no more than tell us what happened, but, with rare exceptions, long stories must also provide convincing characters for something to happen to. Despite its vaunted ability to imagine new worlds and furnish them with all manner of living creatures, science fiction is notably deficient in novels of character.",1988-04-24T05:00:00+0000

There's not even an admission charge. Just show up early enough and take a number, like you do in a bakery. As early as 3:15 yesterday morning, with the sidewalks of Times Square winding down after another Saturday night, the first of this year's National Football League draftniks arrived in the Marriott Marquis lobby. And now, under the eight crystal chandeliers of the Broadway Ballroom, most of the draftniks were hushed as the Jets pondered their first-round choice. But some draftniks were in full uniform. And in full cry. ''Irvin, Irvin, Irvin,'' several were chanting. ''Irvin, Irvin, Irvin.'' One of those draftniks was wearing a green Jets sweatshirt, another a blue-and-red-trimmed white Giants jersey with 56 on the back. Together, they were pleading for the Jets, who have made several forgettable choices in recent years, to take Michael Irvin, a wide receiver from the University of Miami. But when the chanting stopped, another voice was heard. ''Don't even think about it,'' that voice yelled. At the lectern minutes later, Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced, ''The New York Jets have selected David Cadigan, tackle, Southern California.'' Many of the draftniks applauded, but some booed, including those who had been chanting for Irvin. Then they erupted in another chant. ''Joe must go,'' they yelled. ''Joe must go.'' This, of course, was a revival of the lyrics that serenaded Coach Joe Walton late in the Jets' 6-9 season that dropped them into the American Conference East dungeon last year.",1988-04-25T05:00:00+0000

The Villanova relay team was challenged by Texas for two legs of the race and then gradually ran away from the field, winning by about 150 meters and beating last-place Boston College by more than a lap. Florida took second in 11:14.33, with Texas fading to third at 11:15.93. Villanova shattered its record of 10:53.27 set at the Penn Relays of 1984. The mark is not a world record because the medley is not an international event.(AP) Gentile Wins 1,500 Meter Run: Christine Gentile, a senior at Babylon High School on Long Island, continued her outstanding middle distance running at the Penn Relays. She won the 1,500 meter run in 4 minutes 32.5 seconds, adding that title to a string of indoor victories that included the Millrose Games. Nnenna Lynch of Hunter College High School in Manhattan fell on the final lap as she was challenging Gentile and finished seventh. Jodie Bilotta of North Hunterdon (N.J.) High School, runner-up in the 3,000 meters the past two years, finished first in 9:46 with Deresa Walters, a freshman from Penfield, N.Y., second in 9:51.7, a freshman state record. Tilden of Brooklyn also posted a state mark when it qualified for today's girls 1,600 meter relay with a clocking of 3:46.6. The team ran with Michelle Brown, Renee Ray, Nora Ettienne and Kyron Agard. Sonya Henry of Freeport, L.I., won the long jump at 20 feet 1 inch, wind-aided. BASEBALL Female Baseball Coaches Meet: The first baseball game between the two Public Schools Athletic League teams coached by women turned out to be a one-sided one yesterday as Eastern District High School, coached by Chris Lettieri, coasted to a 23-6 victory over Prospect Heights, coached by Debbie McIntosh, at the Parade Grounds in Brooklyn. ''We had a 2-0 lead on them in the first inning, and the rest of the way they scored on errors, errors, errors.'' said McIntosh, who led the Prospect Heights boys' basketball team to the final of the P.S.A.L. B Tournament this season before losing to Samuel Gompers. Her baseball team is 4-6. Lettieri is in her sixth season as coach of Eastern District, which has an 11-5 record.
