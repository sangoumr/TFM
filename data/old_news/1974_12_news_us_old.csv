The number of Leonardo's writings that had already been discovered was suddenly increased by a fifth, and the number still to be discovered fell to about one half of those mentioned by Leonardo himself. Scholars from all over the world rushed to the Biblioteca Nacional in Spain, and descriptions of what they saw were soon broadcast to the public in a special issue of Life, in seven stories in The New York Times (between February 15 and March 5, 1967), and in a steady stream of learned books and articles ever since. Now, seven years after he was granted the great privilege of becoming the first Leonardo scholar to hold in his hands these marvelous codices (Burlington Magazine, JanuaryFebruary 1968), the late Ladislao Reti's promise has at last been fulfilled. A team of Italian and American philologists, Spanish printers, Swiss photographers, English designers, German bookbinders, and an American publisher has made available an offset reproduction of the original manuscripts, together with an accurate transcription, an English translation and a textual commentary, all bound and boxed in a handsome fivevolume set: THE MADRID CODICES (McGrawHill, Deluxe Edition, $750; Regular Edition, $400).",1974-12-01T05:00:00+0000

There have always been figures who believe that the photograph is a serious, esthetic object; usually they've worked in isolation, or, like Andre Kertesz in the twenties and thirties, in the company of (and with encouragement only from) painters and poets.

Though some prices are continuing to rise, a visitor should find that he is spending between 20 and 43 per cent less than he would have before devaluation. For example, a dinner that cost $9.50 before Nov. 10 now costs $8, and a $2.50 lunch is now $1.80. Hotel prices, standardized in dollars, remain the same, although package deals arranged through agents abroad are cheaper. A rise in bus and taxi fares, approved by the Ministry of Transportation, is expected this month. At most, the transportation rates, in dollars, will be back up to what they were in early November.

Then, they take a judge hostage to bargain for their release. Their ruthless teamwork has none of the sentimentally that oozed through ""Bonnie and Clyde."" Here, the tension between the hard-headed practicality and the extreme carelessness of the outlaws yields an intriguing characterization.Daniel Cauchy and Bulle Ogier are first-rate as the pair on the prowl. His forlorn ??? face when he pulls a weapon or gets nabbed, established the deadly unpredictability of his character. Meanwhile, she's deceptively cherubic; that sweet little face masks a completely brutal nature. This beguiling waif is even more lethal than her husband, even though he's crazed and she is not.The plot thins in invention toward the end, so the suspense is muted. But there are many fine details, including a scene where some hoods devastate a bar with gaudy spray paint, to punish the proprietor. And I liked the man who's reluctant to surrender his beloved new car to the famous fugitives; as he protests that it's not broken in, that the monthly payments aren't finished, it's clear that his wheels are more important to him than his life. It's that kind of deft absurdity that gives ""The Hostages"" its special dimensions.",1974-12-06T05:00:00+0000

The roll call of their title credits (Waterbabies, Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby, Little Boy Lost, Aladdin. and His Wonderful Lamp et al.) reads like a litany of childhood memory, or, as Mr. Larkin puts it, they conjure up a very tangible world of makebelieve.

Lisbon's old monuments and buildings are covered with political posters and graffiti, despite a Sunday cleanup a few weeks ago, and even if they are not pretty, they do impart a flavor of the political ferment and excitement here. Apparently, tourists were a little apprehensive about the revolution, and this, plus worldwide racession local cholera, has reduced tourism in Portugal this year by 20 per cent. The cholera is over (it never really affected tourists), and although inflation is still a factor in Portugal, costs are reasonable compared with the rest of Europe.

us,Criminals At Large,"When Julian Semyonov's PETROVKA 38 (Stein and Day, $1.95) was published here in 1965, it attracted quite a bit of attention. It was about crime in Moscow, written by a Russian. and it was the first Russian procedural that anybody had ever come across. Now this novel about three efficient, humanistic Moscow cops is out in paperback. It is surprising how closely it resembles American proceduralswith its combination of slogging footwork, chasing down clues and even protecting the innocent. These Russian cops are definitely Good Guys. A welcome novelty.The various crime series in paperback continue, for better or worse, mostly worse. Our friend the Baroness is with us in THE SONIC SLAVE by Paul Kenyon (Pocket, 95 cents). Here the female James Bond is located in an Arabian emirate, with a bloodthirsty ruler and a mad scientist who has developed a death ray. Lots of sex, too, as usual. Idiocy, but wellwritten, and the hell of it is that you find yourself hooked. Then there is the Peacemaker series by Adam Hamilton; the third release is THE XANDER PURSUIT (Berkley, 95 cents), all about a Caribbean republic, a threatening dictator nearby, ambling and the Mafia. Who resolves everything? The 32yearold Barrington HewesBradford, one of the world's richest men. Pretty bad, this. Not much better is the second in The DC Man series, as represented by James P. Cody's SEARCH AND DESTROY (Berkley, 95 cents). Dead Senator; suicide (say the cops); senatorial investigation into crime; dirty work in the Senate.

His TV Peter Pan, starring Mary Martin, delighted millions of American childrenatheart. Everyone knows his first produced choreography, the ballet Fancy Free; everyone knows that West Side Story opened up new possibilities in American musical theater. It didn't have an upbeat ending; its characters were tough and contemporary, and a lot of them didn't have hearts of gold.

But it is fairly glamorous as all travel seems in retrospect. (Why, are those really the famous Mountains of the Moon?) Before putting on my pith helmet and sitting down to read Alberto Moravia's collection of articles from 10 years' junketing in Africa, I read the South African novelist, Nadine Gordimer's superb new book The Conservationist and found myself writing later, There are so many versions of Africa it is almost possible to believe that the fixed place doesn't exist; not a continent, but an occasion. Miss Gordimer writes as a resident, and her version is a credible nightmare; Signor Moravia writes as a visitor, and his is much sunnier. Here he is describing an African dance: ... it must be said that the dance is merely the most striking aspect of the contagious primitive rhythm which the African has introduced into the modern world.

One producer will give you a little shrug of a smile and suggest that business is always better in the theater when the economy as a whole is going to rot, a remark that may or may not be as idiotic as it sounds. Another, a soberer type, will point out that the upsurge, after all, says very little about the true state of the American theater inasmuch as the season's entire output thus far has consisted of revivals and British imports, an observation that is undeniably accurate but doesn't in the least dispose of the fact that there is an upsurge. A third may murmur something about the new Shubert regime's being good for the theater, helping to finance the shows it houses, and then instantly request that you not quote him by name. What I think is that everybody is terrified of talking about, or trying to analyze, the good fortune that has descended from the unpredictable heavens for fear that talking about it, or analyzing it, will somehow make it go away again.

us,"'Godfather, Part II' Is Hard to Define:The Cast","The only remarkable thing about Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather, Part II"" is the insistent manner in which it recalls how much better his original film was. Among other things, one remembers ""The Godfather's"" tremendous narrative drive and the dominating presence of Marlon Brando in the title role, which, though not large, unified the film and transformed a super-gangster movie into a unique family chronicle.""Part II,"" also written by Mr. Coppola and Mario Puzo, is not a sequel in any engaging way. It's not really much of anything that can be easily defined.It's a second movie made largely out of the bits and pieces of Mr. Puzo's novel that didn't fit into the first. It's a Frankenstein's monster stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own. Occasionally it repeats a point made in ""The Godfather"" (organized crime is just another kind of American business, say) but its insights are fairly lame at this point.""The Godfather, Part II,"" which opened yesterday at five theaters, is not very far along before one realizes that it hasn't anything more to say. Everything of any interest was thoroughly covered in the original film, but like many people who have nothing to say, ""Part II"" won't shut up.Not the least of its problems is its fractured form. ""Part II"" moves continually back and forth in time between two distinct narratives. It's the story of the young Vito Corleone (who grew up to be played by Marlon Brando in the first movie) seen first around the turn of the century in Sicily and then in 1917 in New York, where he's played by Robert De Niro, and it's the story of Vito's son, Michael, played again by Al Pacino, the new Mafia don who sets out to control Las Vegas in the late nineteen-fifties.One story doesn't necessarily illuminate the other, it's just additional data, like footnotes. I can't readily imagine what Mr. Coppola and Mr. Puzo were trying to do, except to turn their first film into a long parenthesis that would fit between the halves of the new movie.Even if ""Part II"" were a lot more cohesive, revealing and exciting than it is, it probably would have run the risk of appearing to be the self-parody it now seems.Looking very expensive but spiritually desperate, ""Part II"" has the air of a very long, very elaborate revue sketch. Nothing is sacred. The photography by Gordon Willis, so effective originally, is now comically fancythe exteriors are too bright and glowy while the interiors are so dark you wonder if these Mafia chiefs can't afford to buy bigger light bulbs.Nino Rota's old score keeps thumping away like a heavenly juke box. The performers, especially those repeating their original roles, seem locked into waxily rigid attitudes. Mr. Pacino, so fine the first time out, goes through the film looking glum, sighing wearily as he orders the execution of an old associate or a brother, winding up very lonely and powerful, which is just about the way he wound up before. Mr. De Niro, one of our best young actors, is interesting as the young Vito until, toward the end of his section of the film, he starts giving a nightclub imitation of Mr. Brando's elderly Vito.There are a couple of nottble exceptions. Lee Strasberg, the head of the Actors Studio, makes an extraordinarily effective screen debut as Hyman Roth, the powerful Jewish mobster (reportedly modeled on Meyer Lansky) with whom Michael attempts to take over the Havana rackets under the Battista regime. Mr. Strasberg's Roth is a fascinating mixture of lust, ruthlessness and chicken soup. Michael V. Gazzo, the playwright (""A Hatful of Rain""), is also superb as a Corleone captain who crosses the Family. Another more or less nonpro, G. D. Spradlin (a former politician, according to publicity sources) is absolutely right as a crooked, very WASPish United States Senator from Nevada.The plot defies any rational synopsis, but it allows Mr. Coppola, in his role as director, to rework lots of scenes that were done far better the first time: family reunions, shoot-outs, ambushes and occasional dumb exchanges between Don Michael Corleone and his square, long-suffering wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). ""Oh, Michael,"" says the slow-to-take-offense Kay when Michael is about to sew up the Vegas rackets, ""seven years ago you told me you'd be legitimate in five years.""""Part II's"" dialogue often sounds like cartoon captions.",1974-12-13T05:00:00+0000

Like Wallace Stevens, he sees the poem as the cry of its occasion, and in this book occasions and their cries are matched with uncanny perception.

There, are hilly woodlands, country estates, lakes, restorations that bring to life the Revolutionary era, and post roads linking communities that once echoed to the tramp of British regulars, Hessian mercenaries and Washington's Continental Army. These days the county is laced with good highways, a boon to visitors who are hunting for houses or antiques, calling at historic sites or merely touring through the countryside. Unlike the county's Interstate highways, the older parkwaysthe Hutchinson River, Bronx River, Saw Mill River and Taconic Statewere intended for casual travel. The Bronx River Parkway, in fabt, was the world's first automobile parkway and is just 50 years old this year. Although parts of it ate being improved, much of its length from the Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx to the Hawthorne interchange above White Plains offers the same vistabridges, waterfalls, ponds, wildfowl and sculptured landscapeavailable a half century ago to the original Sunday drivers. Farther north, State Route 100 and U.S. 202 open the way to valleys and quiet villages, and convenient access to the parkways or highways for a quick return to the city. An interesting drive through somewhat busier villages is along U.S. 9, which follows the Hudson River and links several of Westchester's sights.

us,Book Ends,"Plathiana. Back in 1971, when her novel The Bell Jar appeared in this country and went on to best sellerdom, Sylvia Plath became a posthumous literary sensation. The tide of renown has ebbed somewhat but the interest perks on, and there are at least four books on her in varying stages of preparation. A biography by Edward Butscher is scheduled for August, 1975 publication by Continuum Books, and two others, one by Harriet Rosenstein (a critical biography for Knopf) and the other by Lois Ames (Harper & Row); are in the works. And next spring Harper & Row will publish a collection of Miss Plath's letters, edited by her mother, Aurelia Plath, and entitled Letters Home. Frances McCullough Mrs. Plath's editor, learned of the letters from Lois Ames and asked Mrs. Plath to let her read them. She thought they were a book and persuaded Mrs. Plath to allow publication. The next steps were winnowing down the mass of material (there were over 1,000 letters) to book size and getting permission from Miss Plath's husband, Ted Hughes. The selection process took two and in the meantime Mr. Hughes's imprimatur came through with minimal deletions of incidents relating to the couple's children. The final book wilt contain some 400 letters, almost all of them written to Mrs. Plath, plus 60 pictures, some from a scrapbook Miss Plath kept in high school. Miss Math was a prolific letter writer, averaging three or four a week, with many eight to 10 pages long, and enjoyed a close, open relationship with her mother. The letters, which span the period 1950 to 1963, the year of her death by suicide, speak freely of poetry in progress, love affairs, her married life, her fits of depression and elation. The letters have a fantastic sense of immediacy as if you'd just ripped open the envelope, Mrs. McCullough said. They also convey an obsession with death, and in one Miss Plath inquires about the proper dose of sleeping pills so that she won't take an overdoseat least not yet, she adds lightly.",1974-12-15T05:00:00+0000

Arne drinks homemade apple wine and has his antennae out for the unforeseen, which materializes as inevitably as Murphy's Law. (If something can go wrong, it will.) Land developers and highway planners are formidable enemies for a man who has only his Angst and an old college classmate for a lawyer. As the painter learns, to his mounting bitterness, America's roads are paved with conflicts of interest.

Perhaps the French are grateful for this idylic view of their history, after the painful abrasions of Marcel Ophuls's ""The Sorrow and the Pity,"" Louis Malle's ""Lacombe, Lucien,"" and Michel Mitrani's ""Black Thursday,"" all of which dwell on collaboration with the Germans. The movie opened yesterday at the Regency Theater.The film focuses on the director's childhood during the German occupation of France, when his Jewish family tried to live in hiding and then escaped to Switzerland. Misty shots of handsome people moving gracefully through pastel landscapes make it almost impossible to believe these are fugitives fleeing for their lives. The elegant camera angles, the lovely clothes, the comely faces and the lush colors combine to cancel out the suffering of the French Jews; the movie's style is just too lyrical to convey their desperation or pain. Since their survival, seems as miraculous as a fairytale  instead of being rooted in human experiencewe can't fear for them when the Germans approach, or when the bullets fly.In fact, the trouble with this sensitive but shallow movie is that it has bags of style but very little content. And the often-pleasing device of a film within a film only serves to weaken the material: the theme of a director who's determined to make a movie about his boyhood gives the wary potential investor some trenchant lines. The latter is meant to be appallingly commercial when he protests that this movie won't work. He's a clich figure when he says that it needs to be livelier, that some sex and death would supply the vitality that's lacking. But he happens to be right when he complains about the lack of substance.Mr. Drach begins by playing himself as the frustrated director; he then does a life-swap with Jean-Louis Trintignant, while Marie-Jose Nat (who's married to Mr. Drach) is cast as his mother as well as herself, and their small son plays Mr. Drach as a child. The present is filmed in cinema vrit style in black and white, and the past wells up in color. Mr. Trintignant has almost no acting to do: he merely responds to ""his"" memories with sad or fond expressions.Miss Nat, who won the Best Actress award at Cannes for her performance as the totally beloved, utterly magical mother, is very beguiling in a liquid way. But her role is so idealized that we just can't swallow such perfection. The child is engaging: however he has been directed to be too poignant and too winsome, as well as wise beyond his years. All in all, ""Les Violons"" is one of those movies that's so tasteful it makes you feel boorishand that's not a useful context for reflecting any kind of war.",1974-12-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Wilder's Uneven Film of 'Front Page':The Cast,"It had to happen sooner or later that Billy Wilder, one of the most astringent wits of the American cinema, would make a movie out of ""The Front Page,"" the great nineteen-twenties Chicago newspaper farce by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. No matter that it's been very well made beforein 1931 by Lewis Milestone and in 1940 by Howard Hawks, who turned the play into his own movie classic.The property is a natural for Mr. Wilder and his screenwriting, collaborator, I.A.L. Diamond, who, despite all their comparatively ""nice"" hits (""Love in the Afternoon,"" ""Some Like It Hot,"" ""The Apartment"" and ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes""), have a special (and, to my mind, very appealing) appreciation for vulgar, brilliant con artists of monumental tackiness.This appreciation has resulted in at least one Wilder movie of such bad taste that its gaffs became its gaudy style (""Kiss Me, Stupid"") and in another movie that ranks among their very best, ""The Fortune Cookie.""""The Front Page,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet and Little Carnegie Theaters, falls somewhere between these two extremes. Even though the mechanics and demands of movie-making slow what should be the furious tempo, this ""Front Page"" displays a giddy bitterness that is rare in any films except those of Mr. Wilder. It is also, much of the time, extremely funny.The orginal place and time (Chicago in the late twenties) have been preserved, as well as the principal setting, the press room in Chicago's ancient Criminal Courts Building, The Wilder-Diamond screenplay updates and makes somewhat rougher the original tough-guy dialogue and wisecracks, but the story has not been violated. It's still about the efforts of Chicago's most brilliant, most ruthless managing editor, Walter Burns (Walter Matthau) to keep his star reporter, Hildy Johnson (Jack Lemmon), on the job long enough to cover the impending execution of a poor, shy left - wing innocent whom Chicago's yellow press has turned into a Red Menace from Moscow.The film contains at least two marvelous performances, Mr. Matthau's snarling, monomaniacal editor (""I picked you up when you were nothingcovering Polack weddings on the South Side!"") and Austin Pendleton as the-condemned revolutionary who got his start stuffing fortune cookies with messages demanding freedom for Sacco and Vanzetti.Mr. Lemmon is comparatively reserved as the flamboyant Hildy, never quite letting go of his familiar comic personality to become dominated by the lunacies of the farce. He always remains a little outside it, acting.Carol Burnett has an even tougher time as Molly Malloy, the self-described $2 Clark Street whore who loves Mr. Pendleton. This role may well be impossible, however, since it requires the actress to play for straight melodrama while everyone around her is going for laughs. Two lines sum up the difficulty of the role as they define the spirit of the movie. When Molly, in a desperate effort to save her lover, jumps out the courthouse window to what could be her death, one reporter shakes his head and says, ""All whores are a little goofy,"" while another races to his telephone to report, ""Shady lady leaps for love!""Mr. Wilder has great fun with the period newspaper detailsuch as human interest stories about Admiral Byrd and penguinsand admires his various supporting actors to such an extent that he allows them to play as broadly as they could possibly desire. Some are better than others.I particularly liked Vincent Gardenia as an inefficient sheriff, Martin Gabel as a mad Viennese alienist and David Wayne as a prissy Chicago Tribune reporter, a performance that may bring down the wrath of the Gay Activists Alliance though it seems as much of a comment on what was considered funny in the twenties as it is a replayed homosexual stereotype.The hysteria is not as consistent as one might wish, nor, indeed, as epic as in Mr. Wilder's own ""One, Two, Three."" The cohesive force is, instead, the director's fondness for frauds, which, I suspect, is really an admiration for people who barrel on through life completely intimidating those who should know better.",1974-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: James Bond and Energy Crisis:'Man With Golden Gun' at Several Theaters The Cast Roger Moore Lacks Connery's Impudence,"The throbbing information that ""the energy crisis is still with us"" isn't what you need or want to learn from a James Bond picture. But that poverty of invention and excitement characterizes Guy Hamilton's ""The Man With the Golden Gun,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.The movie, which also explains that ""coal and oil will soon be depleted,"" sets Bond in pursuit of a missing device that converts solar energy into electricity Bored already? That was predictable, Even Kingsley Amis, a great admirer of the late Ian Fleming, spoke of ""the over-all inferiority"" of the writer's last novel, and this movie is doggishly faithful to its model.There's a male villain with three nipples, but you can't milk much plot out of thator them. Amid the general lack of gumption, Roger Moore's large rigid figure appears to be wheeled about on tiny casters I always have a soft spot for statues that turn out to be alive, and there are a couple in this film.But an actor who appears to have been cast in clay is another matter, and Mr. Moore functions like a vast garden ornament. Pedantic, sluggish on the uptake, incapable of even swaggering, he's also clumsy at innuendo. (While Sean Connery wasn't the wit of the century, he did manage to be impudent, and there were those pleasing moments of self-parody.) But whether Mr. Moore is twisting a woman's arm to discover a fact that he already knows, or nuzzling an abdomen without enthusiasm, he merely makes you miss his predecessor.The script trundles out such lines as ""Your steam bath is ready"" or ""A mistress cannot serve two masters"" between the dullest car chase of the decade and a very routine explosion. The only energetic moments are provided by Herve Villechaize, as a midget gifted with mocking authority, and Christopher Lee as the golden gunmanboth have a sinister vitality that cuts through the narrative dough. (Yet if I were a midget, I'd rebel against the perky bass music that bubbles up at every entrance; cute bassoons did the same for the dwarf in ""The Abdication."" Can't small persons be filmed without coy theme tunes?) The movie also includes some beautiful glimpses of Thailand. But if you enjoyed the early Bond films as much as I did, you'd better skip this one.",1974-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Two Affectionate Family Portraits at the Whitney:The Program,"In delving into their roots, Martha Coolidge and Amalie R. Rothschild, the young movie makers responsible, respectively, for ""Old Fashioned Woman"" and ""Nana, Mom and Me,"" the documentaries that arrived yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art, vividly illustrate the idea that personal history need not be a bore. If traces of self-indulgence occasionally surface in these family portraits, they depict meaningful personalities lovingly exposed by deeply concerned relatives.In both instances, the protagonists, as well as the film makers, largely speak for themselves in forthright, sometimes understated and occasionally funny terms that point up the color, joys and hardships of their backgrounds. Miss Coolidge's grandmother and Miss Rothschild's grandmother and parents evolve as people worthy of the attention they are being paid.Martha Tilton Coolidge, her granddaughter admits, ""has been a small but intimidating old-fashioned woman."" But in ""Old Fashioned Woman,"" which, incidentally, had a screening at the recent New York Film Festival, the 86-year-old subject about whom she is so curious emerges, in a brilliant but gently hued cameo, as a charming, resolute Yankee who is old only in years.The tragedies and fulfillments of a life distilled from the past that dates back to Colonial days have enabled her to take time, life, family, friends and issues, old and new, such as abortion and morality, in stride and wisdom. Her grandmother comes across as much of a comfort to a viewer as she obviously did to her sensitively inquisitive granddaughter.Equally illuminating is Miss Rothschild's inspection of her antecedents, who, she says in a program footnote, helped her in ""self-discovery."" They also, it is almost immediately obvious, show an observer the subtle but definite influence they had on the dedicated researcher who focused color cameras and sound on them. Miss Rothschild's ""Nana"" is, like Miss Coolidge's grandmother, a forthright 86-year-old who, unfortunately, is not too willing to submit to questioning. But her parents, an artist-mother and an equally loving lawyer-musician father, indicate that the roots are strong and effective.The generation gaps in both films are made into bridges to an affectionate, perhaps biased, but always edifying look at unheralded individualists whose lives and values are worthwile and stir the heart and mind.",1974-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,'Steppenwolf' Emerges Dimly From Printed Page:The Cast,"The recent vogue enjoyed by ""Steppenwolf,"" particularly among the young, seems unlikely to be expanded by the film version of the 1927 Hermann Hesse novel that opened yesterday at the Eastside Cinema.Fred Haines, who wrote the screenplay and directed the movie, has approached the Nobel Prize-winning German author's exploration of the spiritual and sensual elements of human personality with the all-too-familiar translational reverence that preserves literature while creating stillborn cinema.But he has not failed for want of trying. And he has succeeded in keeping at least one wolf  utter boredom  from the door by recruiting the screen's most ascetic-looking actor, Max von Sydow, to impersonate the tortured, aging writer Harry Haller; and the screen's most enigmatic woman, Dominique Sanda, to portray Hermine, Harry's alter ego and cicerone to the unconventional.Mr. Haines has also marshaled an impressive battery of special effects  animation, Daliesque art, television superimpositions and color synthesizersthat divert the eye, while the mind and the emotions remain uncaptivated.Neither the stars nor the special effects can disguise the fact that ""Steppenwolf"" is a wordy, talky movie, stubbornly rooted in its printed origins.This might be tolerable if the talk were interesting or if Harry Haller's sufferings managed to evoke sympathy. The truth is that the talk ranges from the silly to the sententious, the philosophy is simpleminded, and Harry emerges as an insufferable case of attenuated adolescense.He probably should have been left forever to the printed page, an actor both in Hesse's ""Magic Theater for Madmen Only"" and in the inexhaustible theater of readers' imaginations. To trot him out in real theaters, with his 48-year-old's face and his 14-year-old's confusions, is a cruelty I suspect Mr. Haines never intended.",1974-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Towering Inferno' First-Rate Visual Spectacle,"""The Towering Inferno"" is a nearly three-hour suspense film for arsonists, firemen, movie-technology buffs, building inspectors, worry warts.The film, which opened yesterday at the National and Trans-Lux East Theaters, is a gigantic cautionary tale for people who want the worst to happen. It's this year's best end-of-the-world moviethe world in this case being represented by a 138-story, glass-and-steel San Francisco skyscraper that, on the night of its dedication, becomes history's biggest Roman candle. It doesn't burn down, just up.It's not a movie that bothers too much about the specifics of how it happened (something about cheap wiring). It's mainly concerned with what happens during the holocaust, that is with an almost interminable succession of rescue episodes involving lovers, frauds, villains, a little girl, a small cat, a mayor and his wife and other assorted characters whose life spans conform roughly to their billing: actors at the head of the cast live longest.Granting that end-of-the-world movies are not designed to test the intellect but, rather, to provide second-hand thrills of a visceral sort, ""The Towering Inferno"" must be everything its producer (Irwin Allen) and its two distribution companies (20th Century-Fox and Warner Bros., paired in a one-shot marriage-of-convenience to finance the film) could have possibly desired.The special effects are smashing, better than those in ""Earthquake"" even without the brain-bending Sen-surround effect of ""Earthquake."" The technological work is old-fashioned Hollywood make-believe at its painstaking best.I have absolutely no idea which scenes of crematory horror were filmed in life-size studio mockups, in real locations or in miniatures  and I don't particularly want to know. The fun in a movie like this is in being fooled by the talents of the stuntmen, the production designers and especially by the editors, the men who fit all the pieces together without the seams showing.""The Towering Inferno"" has an advantage over most movies of this sort in that it has a really classy cast. Though the actors are not required to do much except behave well according to type, their presence upgrades a secondary form of movie melodrama.They include Paul Newman (the architect), Faye Dunaway (the editor of a woman's magazine who goes through the entire fire in a dress so sheer but indestructible that it becomes an engineering feat in itself), Steve McQueen (the heroic fire chief), William Holden (the building's developer-builder), Richard Chamberlain (the man responsible for the faulty wiring who is also a cad to his wife, which may or may not be something to think about), Robert Vaughn (a United States Senator) and Robert Wagner (the building's public-relations man who gets somewhat more coverage than he dared hope for).Fred Astaire also shows up, benignly, as an old con artist out to bilk a rich, middle-aged woman played by Jennifer Jones, and O.J. Simpson is on hand as the building's security chief.Sterling Silliphant's screenplay, based on two different but similar novels (""The Tower"" and ""The Glass Inferno""), probably reads like a traffic control report, but it succeeds in presenting dozens of incidents without noticeable overlaps or collisions. The dialogue, especially at the beginning, is full of those portentous hints of things to come that make the audience giggle in nervous anticipation. ""You forget,"" someone says early on, ""the many modern safety devices we have today.""John Guillermin directed the film, but it's difficult to know exactly what he might have done aside from suggesting a few line readings, perhaps. Movies like ""The Towering Inferno"" appear to have been less directed than physically constructed. This one is overwrought and silly in its personal drama, but the visual spectacle is first rate. You may not come out of the theater with any important ideas about American architecture or enterprise, but you will have had a vivid, completely safe nightmare.",1974-12-20T05:00:00+0000

No longer could they be leveled at the line of scrimmage by the jackals on defense. No longer, after they were three yards downfield, could they be tortured more than once by any one defender. Paul Brown of the Cincinnati Bengals had campaigned firmly for those two commandments. By mere coincidence, Paul Brown employs a wide receiver with the speed of light, Isaac Curtis, who had been all but butchered by the Miami Dolphins when the Bengals were eliminated from last year's N.F.L. playoffs. But the rules weren't put in just for him, Brown insisted. They were put in to make the game more exciting. They have, but not for the Bengals, who did not qualify for the playoffs this time. The primary beneficiary has been the Oakland Raiders, who, in Clifford Branch, had a gazelle hidden in their private preserve. He's not hidden now. Once a world class sprinter clocked in 9.2 seconds for the 100 yard dash, he led all the N.F.L. pass receivers with 13 touchdowns and 1,092 yards. He might be the most significant member of the Raiders when they attempt to dethrone the Dolphins, the twotime Super Bowl champions, today in the most significant of the weekend's N.F.L. playoff games.",1974-12-21T05:00:00+0000

In violating almost every tenet of traditional theater, it seemed to take pleasure in shocking stray visitors from uptown. It also seemed resigned to its marginal existence, a fringe theater located vaguely in the dangerous East Village. But in the last half decade Off Off Broadway has exploded, and today it is a theater of very large ambitions indeed. At the latest count there were some 150 groups that fit into the general, illdefined category.

It's a BookoftheMonth Club selection, and it's also about a sensational murder case  the TateLaBianca mass killings for which Charles Manson and some of his family were convicted. We talked with coauthor Bugliosi, the Los Angeles D.A. who prosecuted the case (he's now in private practice and finishing up another book), and he spoke of it as volubly as if it happened only yesterday. Although he had successfully prosecuted 14 other murders, it was Mr. Bugliosi's biggest case; but when he first took over, the evidence was so weak that a Los Angeles sheriff's deputy commiser?? with him on being handed a bummer. Mr. Bugliosi did his own investigating, working 100 hours a week, and prepared meticulously, concentrating on his final summation first. The three key elements of proof were motive (Manson's vision of helter skeltera race war triggered by the atrocious murders he ordered), domination (enabling Manson to order family members to out the killings) and the testimony of Linda Kasabian, the only witness to the murders who cooperated with the prosecution. He reminisced about his courtroom ttettes with Manson. We'd rap sarcastically, in off moments, he recalled and Manson once told him that he couldn't care less about his female codefendants on trial with him. I've had girls that made them look like men, he boasted. Mr. Bugliosi characterized Manson variously as evil, a sophisticated con man and, quoting his disciples, a heavy dude. He thought the family members had considerable homicidal rage inside them in order to carry out the murders; others in Manson's menagenotably Linda Kasabianrefused to kill. The Manson case was distinct in the annals of American crime because he importuned others to murder for him and because the victims were faceless, chosen as establishment symbols. Manson was an intelligent man (I.Q. 121), his mind aboil with Nazism, satanism, scientology and emanations from the Beatles' songs. Prison was his only home. When it was all over, he told Mr. Bugliosi, You haven't accomplished anything. You just sent me back to where I came from.",1974-12-22T05:00:00+0000

Set in the late nineteen-fifties, this English moviewhich opened yesterday at the Cine Malibu and the Cinema Villageis lazily concerned with the ennui of a young provincial who balks at taking his university exams, leaves home to work at odd jobs, writes whimsical pop lyrics, and pines to enter the rock world. He also makes out with bland young women who beg him not to tell anyone. Eventually, he marries a hairdresser who blinks a lot, and the result is just as boring for us as it is for him.As the soundtrack churns out some elderly (even whiskery) rock music, this tame rebel without claws seems like a ghost of the defiant, adventurous English film heroes of the early sixties, when such splendid actors as Albert Finney in ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"" and Tom Courtney in ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" conveyed the impassioned energy that sprang from claustrophobia.It's a bit forlorn to think of David Essex, who plays the rock fan, as their descendant. He's rather beautiful but has been directed to be utterly passive: for him, acting takes the form of long, slow elfin smiles and dreamy stares, and he struggles to reproduce a particular English accent that's been scarce on screen of late: ""fink"" for think, ""flay"" for slay, ""frow up"" for upchuck.Ringo Starr makes a phlegmatic appearancehe looks a bit sheepish, as though apologizing for making no music at all.

Although 3,830 of Metropolitan Stadium's 48,422 seats were available free, 3,796 remained empty while the Minnesota Vikings were flogging the St. Louis Cardinals, 3014, for the halfchampionship of the National Conference of the National Football League. When the Vikings play the Los Angeles Rams for the rest the title a week deeper into winter on the same snowy terrain, even more bright citizens may stay home beside the fire. The offer of free tickets was not due to the impulsive generosity of the Viking management but rather the civic spirit of Burger King, the national quicklunch chain owned by the Pillsbury Company, a Minneapolis flour mill. As a gesture of goodwill to cow meat consumers the area, Burger King paid $44,924 for all unsold tickets last Wednesday to make sure the game would be a sellout and therefore, under the rules laid down by Congress last year, shown locally on television.

us,' Black Thursday' a Moving Film About Jews of Paris,"""Black Thursday,"" the new French film that opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater, solemnly commemorates one of the bleakest chapters in the history of Paris during the German occupation. On July 16, 1942, 9,000 French policemen rounded up 13,000 Jews, including 4,500 children, hustled them aboard city buses and carted them off on the first leg of a journey that eventually led to the Nazi death camps.For the most part, everything was extremely orderly. There was no panic. The policemen were, after all, French not German. The Jews, too, were polite. They were mostly French nationals and they had faith in the Republic. Also, there were no more hiding places. Some policemen were glad to see the Jews go. If at all conscience-stricken they could tell themselves their victims were simply being sent off to work in factories somewhere. Like in '14-'18.""Black Thursday"" is based on the haunted memoir, ""Les Guichets du Louvre"" (The Gates of the Louvre), by Roger Boussinot, published in France in 1960. At the time of the all-day roundup, Mr. Boussinot was a 20-year-old student at the Sorbonne. Having obtained advance warning of the raids, he spent that day in the Right Bank Jewish quarter, trying unsuccessfully to persuade Jews to hide, or to flee with him to the labyrinths of the Left Bank's student quarter, or just to remove the gold Stars of David they wore on their breasts.He was notably unsuccessful. He was a fresh-faced kid. He might be in the pay of the police. One preferred to take one's chances with one's family rather than to go off on a wild goose chase. A handsome Jewish woman in a pastry shop thanked him with a smile but pointed out that she really didn't know him well enough. She had heard stories about the wild lives the students led. He could have been inviting her to an orgy.Only one person listened to him, though reluctantly: a pretty girl who first found that her mother and younger sister had been arrested, and then watched as the policemen led away all the employes at the furrier's where she worked.""Black Thursday"" is the story of the efforts of the young man, named Paul in the film and played by Christian Rist, to persuade the girl (Christine Pascal) to save herself if not to let him save her. It's an agonizing film, both because of the complex emotions it evokes and because it so often slips into clumsily romantic movie attitudes that don't do justice to the subject.Michel Mitrani, the director, seems at times to be making one of those old Gerard Philippe tearjerkers of the late nineteen-forties, with lots of music on the soundtrack, swoopy, circular camera movements, and actors who look more like idealizations than real people. Everything suggests a softer kind of fiction than this really is.Miss Pascal is an exception. She has an irregular beauty that never denies or gets in the way of the successive waves of fear, hope, resignation and despair she experiences during her day-long flight to nowhere.

us,"Screen:' Abby,' About a Black Family and Exorcism","If ""The Exorcist"" luridly indicated that a white girl plagued by demons could be a problem, ""Abby,"" which landed unsteadily at the Penthouse and RKO 86th Street theaters yesterday, illustrates that a black girl, if not an amused moviegoer, can also be unsettled by dire manufactured powers. As ""the story of a woman possessed"" who is finally cleansed of those devils, ""Abby"" is more silly than shocking even if it seems to take itself seriously.Blame all the ersatz deviltry on William Marshall, as the film's imposingly learned minister-archeologist who unwittingly looses evil forces by digging up an ancient religious artifact in Nigeria that invades the body of his young, lovely, decent daughter-in-law back home in Louisville, Ky. And, of course, Carol Speed, as Abby, his daughter-in-law, begins to behave more and more like a rampaging hooker than a loving bride, churchwoman and dedicated community worker.Her personal poltergeistwhich sets off a series of mysterious sounds and furies, including slamming doors and flying furniture, as well as sexual and physical assaultsthreatens to send the family, a hospital staff and the cops off the deep end. But not before Mr. Marshall, wearing exotic garb and intoning an exotic religious ritual, steps in climactically to exorcise and save the plagued Abby from her destructive alter ego.Mr. Marshall does manage to be dignified despite the mumbo-jumbo he's involved with. But Miss Speed, whose lips turn purple and whose voice turns basso profundo in spewing obscenities in her ""possessed"" state, is energetic, if unconvincing, as the afflicted Abby, Terry Carter and Austin Stoker are believably confused and frightened as her minister husband and cop brother, respectively.As her distraught mother, Juanita Moore delivers one of the film's most intelligent lines. She comforts her ailing daughter at one point with, ""I'm gonna get you a cold towel for your head. It'll make you feel better."" A cold towel could help a viewer, too.",1974-12-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:Police Team Is Focus of 'Freebie and Bean',"""Freebie and the Bean,"" this year's final cop comedy, seems the worst of the lot, probably because it has a cast of otherwise good actors doing bits of business (sometimes called acting) as if they thought they could upstage all of the movie's automobiles, which are seldom still. Cars tail one another endlessly. Sometimes they race and every now and then there's a very complicated, very dumb, all-out chase. Even a single parked car becomes something of a plot point.You finally get the feeling that a car directed the picture its as sensitive as a door knob and as witty as a bumper sticker  and maybe one did, though the title credits list Richard Rush. He is the man who directed the worst of the campus-revolution movies, ""Getting Straight"" (1970). Before that disaster Mr. Rush had earned a name in Hollywood for directing low-budget motorcycle films.The stars of the film are Alan Arkin, who plays Bean, a sensitive Mexican-born policeman who suspects his beautiful wife of infidelity, and James Caan, who plays Bean's all-American partner, Freebie. The best performance is that of Valerie Harper (television's Rhoda), who is seen briefly as Bean's wife. For a few minutes there is something very funny about the movie when Bean confronts his wife with his suspicions: the intensity of Miss Harper's tolerance of Bean's suspicions and the answers she has for every charge against her exactly matches Mr. Arkin's fury.The rest of the time the movie is serio-comic trash. It was written by Robert Kaufman and what story there isabout two lawmen trying to capture the Mr. Big of the rackets'is not at all dissimilar to ""Busting,"" the much better Peter Hyams cop film seen earlier in the year.

The main source, of course, is the decision by the biennial General Assembly of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on Nov. 20 that Israel is so uncivilized that it must be banned from European regional membership and deprived of $26,000 in cultural assistance. In economic terms the interdict does not make sense, since Israel contributes more to UNESCO than it receives, but that, of course, is not the point. Israel cannot be admitted to the Middle East region because, as a Lebanese spokesman put it, it is a state which belongs nowhere because it comes from nowhere. Although legally speaking Israel has not been expelled from UNESCO, she is under a ban of cultural excommunication.",1974-12-29T05:00:00+0000

In politics, upstate is a countervailing force to downstate (which is a synonym for New York City and the suburbs). In newspaper headlines, upstate is a short word describing any place a fair distance north of the city line. But in reality, upstate is a state of mind in which dairy cows and apple trees are as important as the subway fare and rent control are in New York City. Upstate is no monolith; it has cities and suburbs (and their problems) just like downstate. But it also has farmland, fresh air, the Adirondacks, historic sites, the State Capitol and a vast assortment of recreational facilities.

us,The Screen:Indian Life Recalled in 'Shadow Catcher',"A dead man's obsession seeps over the screen throughout T. C. McLuhan's ""The Shadow Catcher,"" and that fixation casts as strong a spell as the evocations of the North American Indians he studied.Between 1896 and 1930, the photographer and anthropologist Edward S. Curtis dedicated his life to recording the customs of more than 80 tribes, convinced that these ""dispossessed people"" were losing their way of life as rapidly as he could film them. This superb documentary, which recreates the years that Curtis spent among the Navajo, the Hopi, the Kwakiut???, the Eskimos and others, opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art and will run until Jan. 7.Theodore Roosevelt was impressed by Curtis's work, and J. P. Morgan agreed to finance some of the field work that resulted in 20 volumes and portfolios of photogravure??? plates, plus many 35-mm. films. Meanwhile, as you watch the dances of thanksgiving or supplication, or learn that the Hopi associated the movements of snakes with lightning flashes (hence the snake dance was a prayer for rain), the politi???an sensitivity of this film emerges: Long ago, when the Indians' culture was sacrificed in the name of ""progress,"" Curtis felt that the destruction of their traditions showed ""that there was something wrong with the American dream.""Careful not to violate the Indians' privacy, Curtis nonetheless succeeded in participating in some of their rituals. He was also a dexterous interviewer. If an individual didn't want to talk with him, Curtis would discuss theology and deliberately make an error, so that the Indian would correct him, and that would lead to further conversation.Donald Sutherland becomes Curtis's voice, narrating from the journals and letters of 30 years. Mr. Sutherland conveys the delights of discovery, the fatigue, the discouragement and the determination that drove the man until his marriage, and then his health, collapsed. Inter???cut with Curtis's magnificent photographs and excerpts from ""In the Land of the Head Hunters,"" his 1914 film on the Kwakiut???, there are modern sequences that focus on the landscapes and the descendants of the people he knew.Now and then, his stills pass too quickly, and occasionally the contemporary passages in color break the sepia mood of the past. But it's fascinating to hear three elderly Indians recalling how they performed in Curtis's film for 50 cents an hour. Subtly, the movie says as much about white America as it does about the Indians, and it also distills the nature of another kind of vanishing American: a person who loved his work.",1974-12-30T05:00:00+0000
