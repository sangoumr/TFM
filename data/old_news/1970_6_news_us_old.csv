The country is not entirely strange. You've been there before, on short visits, but each time you arrive, the port of entry has changed. You can read some of the signs, recognize a lot of faces, but you can never feel exactly at home because it isn't your homeand no matter how long you remain, and no mat ter how much argot you pick up, it never will be. It is very much of the modern world with highways and automobiles and telephones and television, and there is always the awareness of a shared heritage of things that matter. Still, it is a unique land, with its own history, languages and laws, some of which seem unreasonably obscure and perplexing, and some of which seem archaically humanistic in a world where almost everyone is bent on defining meaninglessness and chaos through mean inglessness and chaos. There is an austere order in Bergman's land, and you travel there on Bergman's termsit's rather like being in an esthetic police state. One anticipates the experience with excitement (because Bergman is a genius), and a cer tain amount of dread.

us,Ossie Davis' 'Cotton Comes to Harlem',"""Balloons, fans, feathersthey're all out of style,"" says the racially aware exotic dancer preparing her act for Harlem's Apollo Theater. ""They don't say a thing about my people!""In addition to the exotic dancer, who talks like an earnest Radcliffe girl (and who finally decides to do a strip tease atop a bale of cotton), there are a number of funny things in ""Cotton Comes to Harlem,"" including a back-to-Africa swindle that has the approval of such astute agencies as the State Department, the New York Attorney General's office and the Securities and Exchange Commission.There is also a marvelous chase that, in keeping with the film's relentless system of reversals (""there's a honky in the woodpile"" is a sample gag) comes near the beginning, rather than at the end, of the story. There is, throughout it all, a sense of liberation, for here is a film by a new black director (Ossie Davis, otherwise the actor and author), based on the work of a black novelist (Chester Himes), shot in Harlem with a large and talented black cast.However, like the dancer's balloons, fans and feathers, the movie's stick-ups, shootouts, chases, murders and wisecracks say little about the Black Experience except that Ossie Davis, when given the opportunity, can turn out a ghetto comedy-melodrama that is almost as cold and witless as Gordon Douglas's Gold Coast fables, ""Tony Rome"" and ""Lady in Cement."" It's strictly for people who don't care much about moviesor who persist in regarding movies as sociology.""Cotton Comes to Harlem"" is faithful, sometimes to the point of utter confusion of plot, to the Himes novel, one of a series about Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones, two black New York City detectives whom French literary critics have compared (somewhat too extravagantly, I feel) to Inspector Maigret and Sam Spade. In the book, their dialogue and actions are completely interchangeable. In the movie they can be distinguished by the fact that Godfrey Cambridge, whose eyebrows aspire to meet up in the center of his forehead when he is puzzled, plays Jones, and Raymond St. Jacques, who almost always looks angry, plays Johnson.The story, which seems to have been made unnecessarily ambiguous by the film's editor, has to do with $87,000 hidden (for reasons more convenient to the title than comprehensible in the plot) in a bale of cotton, and with the detectives' efforts to unmask the bogus preacher (Calvin Lockhart) who conceived the back-to-Africa plan as one way of getting himself back to someplace like Las Vegas.There are constant intimations throughout the film that Davis had in mind a contemporary fairy tale, a kind of cops-and-robbers ""Purlie Victorious,"" with stereotypes (Redd Foxx, for example) used in a conscious way to satirize the society that gave them birth. Reality and truth, however, keep intruding to break the desired spell. The car chase that helps to open the film is hilarious until you learn, later on, that the pedestrian, who was winged by a bumper and went sailing into the air for a large laugh, is quite seriously dead.This occasionally works as black black humor, but there is no consistent style, and about half-way through the film I had the feeling that all Davis was able to do was to try to keep up with the seemingly endless plot revelations as outlined in the script.At their best, Cambridge and St. Jacques, throwing away not terribly comic lines, reminded me most of Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford on a slumming vacation from their British-based ""Salt and Pepper"" series. I was also reminded of Oscar Micheaux, who in the 1920's and 1930's, made black films for black theaters modeled on white movie stereotypes. Aside from its honest black idioms and actors, ""Cotton Comes to Harlem"" is a conventional white movie that employs some terrible white stereotypes of black life. Its soul looks very much like rhythm.The film opened yesterday at the De Mille and the 86th Street East Theaters. When I saw it at the first showing at the DeMille, it was apparent that the largely black audience was often as confused as I, not only by the plot but also by the point of view. Throughout most of the film, their sympathies were with the movie's villain, played with lovely, stylish cool by Lockhart, even to the extent that they snickered when St. Jacques upbraided the preacher for conning his own people. ""You could have been a Marcus Garvey or a Malcolm,"" says the cop, but the audience, as far as I could tell, was simply disappointed that crime did not pay.",1970-06-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Eric Till's Drama of 'The Walking Stick' Opens Here,"""Who wants a girl with a withered leg? Imagine in bed: one good leg, and the other just hanging there like the tail of a lizard."" However, Deborah soon succumbs to Leigh's seductive gentleness, and eventually they make it and they begin living together. A polio victim in childhood, Deborah has based a powerful habit of self-protection on her one lame leg. But under Leigh's tutelage, she embraces life, sets aside her stern black walking stick, and begins limping around in miniskirts.The artistic daughter in a family of London doctors (by profession she is the porcelain expert in a fashionable auction house), she is really an easy mark for the handsome young painter, an unfashionably realistic poetic realist, who woos and wins her and then begins the series of betrayals that constitute the dramatic substance of Eric Till's ""The Walking Stick,"" an uneven movie of unspectacular virtueswhich, by grace of careful if quite conventional plotting improves as it goes along.Essentially a Jamesian subject  a maimed girl made whole by the love of a man who proves false and who in turn owes his own undoing to the strength he has given herthe story of ""The Walking Stick"" might as well have been set in the London of Henry James.For despite the miniskirts, the pants suits, the cars, the crowded underground, a bit of burglary, and a mite of mod violence, ""The Walking Stick"" really strives for a sense of untimeliness (with its heroine in figurines, as it were, and its hero in figurative art) so that the involutions of its rather moving story may remain untainted by any suspicion of that curse upon so many recent movies: relevancy.George Bluestone's screenplay, though embarrassing in detail (especially the detail of dialogue), is intelligent enough in over-all strategy. And Mr. Till's direction, by its comparative simplicity, usually redeems the ritual clichsthe idiot flashbacks, the glamour dissolves, the glossy moodsthat beset psychological story movies of a certain commercial ambition.""The Walking Stick"" begins as a women's picture, becomes crime melodrama, and ends as a much superior kind of women's picture. By its changes it grows slightly richer and tougher, and thus shares with its heroine a few of the stoic satisfactions (for example, development through adversity) that are the rewards of traditional fiction.As the heroine, Samantha Eggar gives a beautifully restrained and evocative performance. Utterly unsensual, vulnerable, ultimately strongshe creates a character that is quite simply more interesting and cohesive than I am used to seeing in movies (even in better movies than this one). In this she is helped both by the visual concentration of Mr. Till's direction, and by the screenplay, which makes of Deborah a genuine point-of-view character.But almost as a corollary, David Hemmings has too little to do as Leigh to create a viable characterization. Immensely attractive at the beginning, he becomes indistinct toward the middle, and positively murky by the endwhen he has grown younger, vaguer, and little more than the enabling influence in one woman's moral self-determination.",1970-06-11T05:00:00+0000

This time, continuing their roles as co-owners of a London bistro, the two star-producers are prancing and scampering through the great halls of a British castle with virtually nothing to do in a picture that goes nowhere except back and forth between them, the color camera hovering in rapt fascination.This feeble little jape is so rickety and parched for humor that its amusing highlights are simply two loud sneezes emitted by Davis that make shambles of a costume ball. At this point, toward the end, there was a faint hope that the director  a chap named Jerry Lewis  yes, the same  would jazz things up with a custard-pie or two. But no. The picture proceeds to die on its feet, even with Davis hysterically imitating his director. Lawford, in the double role of twins, roguishly lets us know that he's quite at home in that castle, y'know.The real waste here is the excellent color bestowed on on the beautiful, ancient place and a smattering of London street scenes.

us,Screen: Joyless 'Jovita':Polish Tale of Passion at the Fifth Avenue,"""Jovita,"" which opened yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema, is an earnest, joyless little Polish film that traffics in the kind of romantic passions, revelations and sensibilities most often found in a writer's first notebook.A young man goes to a masquerade ball where he meets a lady wearing the costume of a houri and something that looks like a black surgical mask. For him, it's instant love and he calls her Juliet, though she says her name is Jovita. When he tries to kiss her, she points out that they've just met. ""Well,"" he says in what, for me, was the film's high point, ""maybe later we won't want to.""When the lady fails to keep a subsequent rendezvous, the young man searches the city for her, letting his careers as both a professional long-distance runner and an architect (for all its romanticism, the movie never separates its characters from their practical environment) go to hell.There are affairs with other girls, including one who talks about Peter Pan in bed, some guilt about a friend's suicide, and ultimately, according to the conventions of the movie-of-self-discovery, he finds himself although I never once was convinced he had been misplaced.The movie was directed by a Polish director new to me, Janusz Morgenstern, a graduate of the Lodz Film Institute. His work is very proper and unexciting. Early in the film he defines the dissolute love life of his hero via an afternoon tryst and images of a seltzer bottle, a ringing telephone that goes unanswered and a single, shared cigarette. The film's technique isn't as restrained as it is inhibited.The performers include Daniel Olbrychski, as the young man, Barbara Lass, as the girl and Zbigniew Cybulski, the fine star of ""Ashes and Diamonds"" and ""Innocent Sorcerers,"" who was killed in an automobile accident in 1967 at the age of 40.

I'm not sure what those four dots mean, though I suspect they are some kind of dirty-movie braille for ""Oh, Wow!"" But the actual movie looks as if it had been developed from an idea that, while traveling between the minds of Brian De Palma and Chuck Hirsch (co-authors of ""Greetings"" and ""Hi, Mom!""), had been kidnapped by Grove Press, and, because nobody wanted to pay the ransom, they killed it.The movie also looks like several other movies, and, fatally, reminds us of two or three real movie makers. In its locales and its images (young adventure in New York from the East 50's to Coney Island) it follows the footsteps of Warren Sonbert (""The Bad and the Beautiful,"" ""Truth Serum,"" etc.).In some of its moods and in its choice of leading lady (Joy Bang, here identified as Joy Wener) it imitates Andrew Meyer (""Sky Pirate,"" ""An Early Cue to the New Direction,"" etc.). And in its final freeze frame, the puzzled face of its hero spurned by its heroine (the sensible Joy Bang), it acts as if it were the very first film to copy the device out of Truffaut's ""400 Blows.""At no point is ""Events"" worth watching, but it reaches a positive frenzy of dullness during its climactic orgy sequence, when the heroine, the modest Joy Bang, has left the scene (""I dunno  maybe I'm just not hip enough for the new generation hipness."") and the heroes, Frank and Ryan, settle down for some profitable movie making.Baker has an unenviable talent for undressing girls who are at once flat-chested and flabby-breasted (except the firm and voluptuous Joy Bang) and then subjecting them not only to various sexual specialities, but also to a really obscene hand-held camera, and to such a variety of screens and tinted panels and arty superimpositions as to qualify for every photographer's prize contest between the years of, say, 1933 and 1937.The director selected the events, and the actors improvised their own dialogue, and the results are uniformly unhappy. Nothing interesting happens, though a lot that is supposed to be interesting happens, and the lines fall like lead weights cast into the void. ""If my mind can't go around you, how can my arms go around you?"" wails Ryan when Joy puts down pornographyas if he had pulled an F in his sensitivity classes.The cast is large, untalented (except for Joy Bang), and terrifically indigenous. ""Events"" may (or may not) be the first dirty movie to show and give special credit to the Rev. William Glenesk of the Spencer Memorial Church.",1970-06-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Strawberry Statement' Rash of Techniques:Horovitz Adapts Diary of Columbia Student Stuart Hagmann Makes Debut as Director,"In the pound or so of heavily ""now,"" swinging publicity material put out by his studio, Stuart Hagmann, who makes his debut as a feature film director with ""The Strawberry Statement,"" is quoted as saying: ""Directing dramatic TV series teaches you important things like sticking to schedules, budgets, deadlines and working with lots of people. . . . But I personally feel experience in making commercials presents more excitement and challenge. You can be more inventive. You have to be more inventive.""Hagmann has been so inventive with ""The Strawberry Statement,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema II, that it only lacks an occasional, superimposed written message (""Strike to Prove Yourself Alive, Folks!"") to look like a giant, 103-minute commercial, not for peace, or student activism, or community responsibility, but for the director himself.Do you have a dull, inanimate product you want to sell? Well, here's your man! He'll photograph it sideways, upside down, from the ceiling! He'll zoom in on it with pulsating rhythms so that the folks out in televisionland will feel as if they've made love to it! Are some of them blind? Then give them sound! Buffy Sainte-Marie! Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young! Butfor heaven's sakedon't give them time to think!This sort of speed treatment is great for boxes of detergents, and even for ""Mannix"" and ""Mission: Impossible."" Too much artificial stimulation, however, can be fatal to movies about recognizable human beings.The film is playwright Israel Horovitz's adaptation of ""The Strawberry Statement: Notes of a College Revolutionary,"" the diary kept by James Simon Kunen, a 20-year-old Columbia student, before, during and after the 1968 insurrections on Morningside Heights. Like the book, the movie is the record-of-radicalization of a young man committed to crew instead of causes, a sweet-tempered fellow who joins the administration building sit-in more in pursuit of lust (it's where the girls are) than out of higher loyalties.Simon (Bruce Davison) is Holden Caulfied at the barricades, wondering, during the first night of his sit-in, if the Paris commune could possibly have been as dull, and sneaking out every morning to attend crew practice. His education is effected simultaneously by Linda (Kim Darby), a pretty face with an enormously appealing, muddled political spirit, and by a sudden, almost overwhelming realization of all the inequities that surround him.Essentially, however, Simon and Linda are the direct, if radicalized, descendants of the kids in ""Girl Crazy,"" but the big show in ""The Strawberry Statement"" is a police bust, not a senior class revue en route to Broadway.When you look around, over and through the blur of technique put up by the director, it's possible to see and hear a lot of Horovitz (""The Indian Wants the Bronx,"" ""Rats"") and Kunen in the script.Simon is the type of guy who cannot walk by a ringing public telephone without answering it (""Gee, operator,"" he says politely, ""I think you should know, but somebody urinated in this booth""), and he is not above using a conventional bloody nose as evidence of police brutality. There are lots of marvelous minor characters, including a ""hard-hat"" student (Murray MacLeod), who first calls the demonstrators ""pinko spades and Mafia acid heads,"" and then happily joins them; and an efficient, intensely humorless student organizer (Bob Balaban) who is very comic.There is a frightening, completely meaningless encounter with violence in the park when Simon and Linda meet a gang of toughs who, with great efficiency, destroy Simon's movie camerawhich puts a bit of a strain on his newly acquired social consciousness. And there is Simon's fine, odd monologue about a parrot who could only say ""Kiss off!"" and who belonged to an uncle who committed suicide.These are importations from the dark, absurd world of Horovitz, a world where effects have little relation to causes, and a world that has little to do with the romantic one pictured by Hagmann.Somewhat like Simon, ""The Strawberry Statement"" finally stumbles into significance in a brutal encounter between the National Guard and the students that is not supported by anything in the movie, only by recent, real-life events. This is both the most moving, and the most tasteless, scene in the film.The students, gathered in the gym to await the big bust, sit cross-legged in circles, chanting the Beatles' ""Let It Be."" Suddenly the camera peers down from the ceiling, showing usnot people with ideas and attitudesjust a Busby Berkeley flower arrangement.",1970-06-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Bergman and Quinn Are Stars Of 'A Walk in the Spring Rain',"Hardly anything seems real in ""A Walk in the Spring Rain"" except the blue-green haze of the authentic Smoky Mountain foliage, amid which there unfolds a dreary, tedious unconvincing drama of middle-aged love, that of a university professor's wife and a married, neighboring farmer.The picture, which came from a reportedly fine novel and co-stars Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn, should have been a beauty. It's a bore. And the saddest thing about it is Miss Bergman's hope, as expressed in the film's promotion, for another ""Brief Encounter."" The picture moves self-consciously, like mountain molasses, under the direction of Guy Green, and the scenario by the producer, Sterling Silliphant, is a sketchily overstated exercise of no urgency and precious little warmth.With one exception, the five principal characters are vapid, dull and aimless people. Striving mightily and looking lovely, Miss Bergman sems merely a petulant woman who falls into the arms of Quinn for novelty, from boredom with her equally bored husband, Fritz Weaver, pecking away on a book in their temporary mountain retreat. Quinn, with his actor's image of a roaring, caged giant, is woefully miscast as a hearty, sweet-tempered mountaineer. Spying on the lovers, like a psychopathic young vulture, is Tom Fielding, as Quinn's son. As Quinn's sloppy wife, Virginia Gregg, one of Hollywood's best character players, droops around like a fugitive from Dogpatch. The exception is the character of Miss Bergman's daughter, a loving, sensible young woman, neatly played by Katherine Crawford. Briefly shown at the outset, she pops back into the picture at mid-point for a realistic mouthful that punctures it like a grounded balloon.",1970-06-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'On a Clear Day You Can See Forever' Begins Its Run,"Vincente Minnelli's ""On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,"" the screen adaptation of the Alan Jay Lerner-Burton Lane musical play, is a movie of fits and starts, but because the fits are occasionally so lovely, and the starts somewhat more frequent than Fifth Avenue buses, I was eventually hypnotized into a state of benign though not-quite-abject permissiveness.The reasons have to do with nostalgia, and with expectation. ""On a Clear Day"" is the first conventional musical film to open this year, the first Minnelli musical since ""The Bells Are Ringing"" in 1960, and the first Barbra Streisand movie to suggesteven brieflythat she is capable of playing someone other than Fannie Brice in the seven stages of woman.The film, which opened yesterday at the Loew's State I and Loew's Cine Theaters, is solidly grounded in a casting coincidence: Barbra Streisand, a performer who sometimes seems too big for movies as well as for life, portrays a girl who is so full of life that she leads a succession of lives.Daisy Gamble (Miss Streisand), a normal, average, five-pack-a-day nicotine addict, who is also gifted with E.S.P., goes to see Dr. Marc Chabot (Yves Montand), a professor of psychiatry, about a quick cure for her smoking problems. In the course of treatment by hypnosis, she regresses to the early 19th century when she was one of England's most successful hangers-on at the Prince Regent's court. In a variation on the recurring Hitchcock theme of transferral of guilt, Daisy so enchants the doctor that she manages to transfer her fantasies to him, with the result that, from time to time, he finds himself transported into her earlier incarnation.Lerner's screenplay places great emphasis on its gags: (He: ""Do you like painting?"" She: ""I don't knowI've gotten so used to wallpaper."") It seems often shaped to meet some very awkward song cues. However, it also dramatizes some attractively romantic ideas about love and the mystery of the life force. ""On a Clear Day"" may be the only comedy to end on the happy note that its lovers will be reunited in 2038 in, of all strange sites for reincarnation, Virginia.The movie is quite ordinary and Broadway-bland in most of its contemporary sequences. Miss Streisand, as a 22-year-old New Yorker whose Yiddish intonations are so thick they sound like a speech defect, defines innocence by sitting with her knees knocked together and her feet spread far apart, a mannerism she may have picked up from Mary Pickford.Minnelli's camera also is hard-pressed to find interesting things to look at in the humdrum settings (doctor's office, apartment, classrooms), and a lot of the time it just records exits and entrances, as if it all were taking place on a stage.However, the movie, Minnelli and Miss Streisand burst into life in the regression sequences, filmed at the Royal Pavilion at Brighton. Minnelli's love of dcor transforms the movie into very real fantasy, and the star into a stunning looking and funny character who mouths her arch, pseudo-Terence Rattigan lines as if she were parodying Margaret Leighton. She is so fine, in fact, that if I didn't know she was not terribly good at lip-sync, I would suspect someone else was reading her.The high-point of the film for me, and one of the most graceful Streisand moments ever put on film, is a royal dinner at which Minnelli's camera explores Miss Streisand in loving circling close-up while her voice is heard on the soundtrack singing ""Love With All the Trimmings."" It's lush lyricism from Minnelli's ""Yolanda and the Thief period.The film has four other excellent songs, the title number, ""Go to Sleep"" (a duet featuring Miss Streisand and Miss Streisand), ""What Did I Have That I Don't Have Now?"" and ""Come Back to Me,"" which Montand sings mostly on the soundtrack as a helicopter swoops around New York. Because the music is rather infrequent, it becomes all the more precious.It's apparently Montand's fate to be emasculated by big Hollywood actresses, and his role is largely that of a line-carrier for Streisand. He behaves himself like a gentleman, however, as do some other decent performers, including Bob Newhart, Larry Blyden and Jack Nicholson (""Easy Rider""), whose role, I understand, has been abbreviated.Nothing is allowed to get in the way of Miss Streisand, but Minnelli, unlike William Wyler (the director of ""Funny Girl"") and Gene Kelly (the director of ""Hello, Dolly!""), has not been completely inhibited by her. He handles her gingerly (I have a feeling her comedy readings are all her own), but with an appreciation of her beauty and of the largely unrealized possibilities of her talent. Talent such as hers will not break when tested; it becomes enriched.",1970-06-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:'ElCondor' Bows:Mexican Treasure Tale Comes to the Forum,"""El Condor,"" which opened yesterday at the Forum Theater, is a movie that almost nobody involved seems to have taken seriously  neither the writers, nor the director, nor the actorswith the possible exception of the explosives expert. For unlike everything else in the film, the explosions, which are fairly numerous, are surprising, precise and occasionally spectacular.Once, during an artillery barrage leveled at the momentarily defenseless leads (Jim Brown and Lee Van Cleef), the detonating shells literally take over the screen and seem to provide their own dumb reason for being.Brown and Van Cleef play a pair of adventurers who, with a band of renegade Apaches, besiege a fabled fortress called El Condor, in which the treasury of Maximilian's Mexico is supposed to hoard its vast reserves of gold.In time, they learn that all that glitters is not, etc.; but on the way they suffer a few indignities, outwit a few fools, fall in and out of troublesalmost enough to make a movie. Eventually Van Cleef ends up dead and Brown ends up with Mariana Hill, simmering ex-mistress of Patrick O'Neal, iron-willed commandant of El Condor, who also ends up dead.From time to time in ""El Condor"" there is introduced a certain amount of female nudity, which probably indicates a trend and certainly makes the film different from the general run of Westerns you may have enjoyed as a child.The nudity is more than sufficiently integrated into the plotas at the sexual-military climax, when Miss Hill, who has gone crazy for Jim Brown, though she has scarcely spoken to him, strips for her love.To distract the guards of the fortress, she throws open her balcony door before undressing for the nightand while part of the cast of hundreds gapes in admiration, the other part of the cast (the Brown-Van Cleef-Apache part) come from behind and strangle them and slit their throats and otherwise silently slaughter them. The pointed juxtaposition of sex and slaughter that particularizes this otherwise mostly mindless movie, introduces a measure of perverse brutality that is more vicious in fact than may appear from a simple description. I think it is the mindlessness more than the violence that makes for my discomfort, for ""El Condor"" lacks either the prurience or prudery to support its more sensational gestures.When you create a vacuum, in art as in nature, something ambles in to fill the empty spaces, and in the void that is ""El Condor"" that something is a death that chills desire.",1970-06-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Books of The Times,"If V. S. Naipaul moves effortlessly from his novelist's chair to the historian's desk in this chronicle of his native Trinidad, is because that history is so fictional, family story with living characters. The events are played out on the fringes of European national ambitions; the perform ers include mountebanks and incompe tents, visionaries and predators. Some of this Carib bean history is ludicrous, a Res toration comedy of intrigue, shift ing alliances, in tricate plotting and papiermache ar rogance. But it will induce little laughter. Masters were brutalized, slaves mutilated, the Indians de stroyed, life de graded. There was something about this island (and perhaps all the others in that sea) that subdued each man to what he dealt sin, and since what he dealt in demanded the exploitation of other men, the result was that each man suffered or flourished only by other people's suffering. Few books, I think, will make so evident the rot that sets in when men leave their native hearth, free of the binding force of convention, morality and accepted norms, and act out their animal instincts. To be sure, we see enough of such behavior today. But at least we go through the motions of protesting these acts and sometimes putting a stop to them. But the Europeans who came to the islands in the form of administrators, magistrates and traders had the military power, the sanction of their laws, the certainty of their natural superiority.

And, by the happiest juxtapositions of imagination and talent, it is. I'm not sure that it is a great movie, but it is very good, and it stays and grows in the mind the way only movies of exceptional narrative intelligence do.Intelligence is the operative word; for although the film is also charming, funny, cruel, sad and occasionally quite terrifying, it is by the richness and complex vigor with which it combines events, ideas, images and people that it chiefly lives.Essentially, just two people: Hogan (Clint Eastwood), an American mercenary working for followers of the 19th-century Mexican patriot Jurez, and Sara (Shirley MacLaine), a nun whom Hogan rescues from rape by desperadoes but who, as an avid Juarista, is in greater danger from the governing French. On horseback and mule (hence the title, which I don't like) the pair set off on an odyssey that is partly flight from pursuing troops and other dangers, and partly an expedition to plunder and destroy a French garrison at Chihuahua.Between Hogan and Sara (two good performances from Eastwood and Miss MacLaine) a basic tension exists as between one who practices a profession and one who follows the call to a vocation. But within Sara, a most suspicious sister, the tension also existsand within Hogan as well, for he carries a stick of dynamite near his heart, as a nun might wear her cross, and with his black gunpowder he effects miraculous cures.Furthermore, Sara is most mysteriously spiritual when most openly physical (a paradox enforced by Ennio Morricone's gracefully functional musical score), and everywhere this Western adventure film proceeds through a course of intricate, flexible and deeply satisfying dialectics.In its development of major themes and minor preoccupations ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" sounds mostly like the work of Don Siegel (""Coogan's Bluff,"" ""Madigan,"" Hell Is for Heroes,"" etc.), and in its narrative shapeliness it feels very much like Budd Boetticher (""The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond."" ""Comanche Station,"" etc.a fine and somewhat neglected filmmaker). I have no idea that the two men collaborated, but I am very glad that both names are involved.One collaboration should be mentionedthat of the director, and the film editors (Robert Shugrue and Juan Jos Marino) and the great Mexican cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa. Figueroa photographed ""Los Olvidados,"" ""Nazarin"", ""Exterminating Angel"" and Simon of the Desert,"" but nothing in his work with Buuel exceeds such passages as the exposition of desert predators in the opening title sequence of ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" or, as a prelude to the film's climax, the solemn lucidity of the ascent to the Juarista mountain stronghold.",1970-06-25T05:00:00+0000

Voroshilov, who was buried last Decem her. The unveiling, done without any publicity, is sure to be known throughout Mos cow within days, but in the first hours neither Soviet nor foreign tourists in Red Square who saw the Stalin bust seemed to pay special atten tion to it. Policemen appeared surprised by the attention being paid the bust by Western journalists. The bust, the work of Nikolai V.

Stalin looks gentle and wise, as he did in many of the paintings and small busts that were seen every where in the Soviet Union while he lived and until Nikita S.

It is to say that on the scale that measures the comparative values of incomparable things, for example, termites versus tides, ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" comes off with a slightly higher rating than Miss Susann's novel, ""Valley of the Dolls,"" and the movie that Mark Robson distilled from it, making tap water out of tap water, as it were.The courts having denied Miss Susann's plea for an injunction against the film's release, ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" opened here yesterday at the Penthouse and Cinema Rendezvous Theaters. It is apparent that intelligences quite different from Miss Susann's and Robson's are at work from the opening title card, which disowns its predecessor (""This is not a sequel"") and goes on to say that the new film, ""like 'Valley of the Dolls,' deals with the oft-times nightmare world of show business, but in a different time and context.""The time and the context are very much out of the imagination of the movie's producer-director, Russ Meyer (""The Immoral Mr. Teas,"" ""Vixen,"" ""Cherry, Harry and Raquel""), whose work has been the subject of a retrospective at Yale and analyzed by Leslie Fiedler (get back to your raft, Leslie honey).With a screenplay by Roger Ebert, the Chicago film critic who is also one of Meyer's most appreciative, most astute interpreters, and with the financial backing of 20th Century-Fox, Meyer has made the quintessential Hollywood movie we all knew he could with $1.5-million. After all, he's been making them on budgets of far less for years.""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" is bigger but not necessarily better than ""Lorna"" and ""Finder's Keepers, Lovers Weepers,"" principally because Meyer is now, quite consciously, attempting to parody his earlier movies, most of which were unconscious, robust parodies of conventional Hollywood presentations of sex, violence, breast sizes and sin.Meyer's earnestly vulgar sensibility, which once met the audience on its own level by giving it exactly what it wanted, has become patronizing. Meyer makes fun of the audience, and of himself. What's worse, he has become downright inhibited, at least in terms of female, nudity on display, but it may be that, at heart, Meyer is a prudeThe oft-times nightmare world of show business of ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" looks very much like the vision one might get of Los Angeles, if one's reading were confined to The Enquirer and to the early conjectures regarding the murders of Sharon Tate and her companions last year It's a tacky, flashy milieu of sports-cars, pot puffed self-consciously, and of houses and apartments that seem to have no relation to the people who inhabit them.Most prominent among the characters are the members of an all-girl rock trio, Kelly (Dolly Read), Casey (Cynthia Myers,) who is beautiful, has Lesbian tendencies and is the daughter of a United States Senator, and Petronella (Marcia McBroom), who is black and beautiful.There are also Ronnie Barzell (John LaZar), a swinging hermaphrodite and king of the pop music world Lance Rocke (Michael Blodgett), a gigolo who literally loses his head over Ronnie; Ashley St. Ives (Edy Williams), the prototype for all earlier Meyer heroines (""men were toys for her amusement""), and Porter Hall (Duncan McLeod), a middle-aged lawyer, a sort of nasty Mr. Teas who, when he goes to bed with Kelly, strips down to his boxer shorts, his black dress socks and his garters.There is so much love-making in the film (very soft-core, very ersatz) that, to squeeze it all in, Meyer must often cut between seductions non-stop. There is a funny, fast, typically Meyer montage of Los Angeles sights (bare breasts, shacks, bare breasts, freeways, bare breasts), and never a moment of silence. When the sound-track is not pulsating with rock, it is moaning with a soap opera organ, just to let us know that it is supposed to be funny.Sometimes it is funny, as when the narrator, at the end, piously enumerates the failings of each character (""Susan Lake? Perhaps she was too good  sometimes excessive love makes us blind to human failings""). The failings of most of the characters, happily, are not so positive. They fail with an intensity of mindlessness forever beyond the creatures of Miss Susann's vapid imagination.",1970-06-27T05:00:00+0000

Phyllis and Eberhard Kronhausen (authors, editors, teachers, psychologists, art collectors, Ph.D.'s and, according to the press release, ""two of the world's foremost advocates of sexual freedom""), the film views its garden of delights with all the appetitive stimulation of a dietitian imagining marshmallow salad.But the nonfictional episodes are a different, more pleasurable, more ridiculous matter. These range from excerpts out of real dirty plays (for example, Michael McClure's excellent ""The Beard"") to an interview with Hugh Hefner (trying to be urbane, and very funny), to an exhibition of erotic art in which the obsessions of the ages are displayed and guilt-free children wander around pulling at a plastic penis.To open the exhibition, held in Lund, Sweden, the statuesque and fortyish Dr. Phyllis Kronhausen emerged, fully clothed, from a piece of plush sculpture called the ""Womb Tomb."" The event is chronicled in ""Freedom to Love,"" and for sheer inappropriateness it is the film's best moment.Miserably written, poorly acted and dreadfully dubbed, the frictional episodes ""illustrate"" (surely the wrong word) the dilemmas faced by impetuous youth (""Yes, Chuck, I'm only 15.""), jaded adults, consenting Lesbians, naughty little girls, and others in this as yet insufficiently Kronhausened world of ours. A depressing aura, as of ancient Danish modern, hangs over these episodes; and although the girls are sometimes ripe, the boys are usually muscular and the practices occasionally quirky, they never make up in physical energy what they lack in cinematic flair.The second best moment also involves a bit of erotic art, I guess. It is an early animated cartoon, of the 1920's, according to the Kronhausens, featuring a magnificently equipped Barney Google character, who, on his three legs, roams the landscape having happy adventures  one of which turns up an enterprising temptress with bedroom eyes and lascivious lips.",1970-06-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Draskovic's 'Horoscope' Bows at the Paris:First Feature Film by Yugoslav Director Boredom of Idle Young Provides Focal Point,"""Horoscope"" at the Paris Theater is the first feature film of Boro Draskovic, one of the young Yugoslav directors whose work was introduced here in screenings at the Museum of Modern Art last fall. Among recent Yugoslav film makers, Draskovic would seem to favor a relatively conservative, intellectually inclusive approach to filmsin the manner, say, of ""Cahiers du Cinma"" five years ago rather than in the manner of ""Cahiers du Cinma"" today. Because I share many of Draskovic's prejudices, and because he is a director of genuine ambition and considerable competence, I wish ""Horoscope"" were a better movie.Set in a minor rail-junction town near Yugoslavia's Adriatic-coast resorts, ""Horoscope"" concerns a group of aimless young men who mostly lie around in the hot sun all day at the railroad station restaurant. They relieve their boredom with acts of petty bravado and aimless horseplay, and by conning the holiday crowds of passengers making connections between trains.When a pretty blonde (Milean Dravic) arrives to operate the station's brand new kioskan unlikely concession specializing in newspapers, knives, Miss Dravic, and no visible customersone of the young men (Dragan Nikolic) swears, on a dare, that he will make her within a week. The manner and shifting motives of his assault provide the fiction upon which the film bases its preoccupations.Nothing about the story is dramatically necessary or thematically interesting. But at the same time, al the peripheral elements  the cruel games, the extensive anecdotes (particularly, a local wedding, full of folk custom and devoted to seven days of musical celebration and ritual blood-letting), compositional detail and visual symbolismreceive such elaborate and carefully programmatic treatment, that ""Horoscope"" suffers from a kind of gigantism of its rhetorical members.Some of those members, for example the wedding celebration, achieve a genuine intensity that from moment to moment almost carries the movie. Others at least excite admiration: among them, the ways in which Draskovic introduces the creatures and imitates the circular figure of the Zodiac to fulfill the suggestions of chance and repetition implicit in his title.But a world as patently constructed (half rock, half reptileaccording to several key images) as is the world of ""Horoscope"" provides too many clues and allows too little to the unaided imagination. It continually points toward significance but never really makes meaning, and its action ultimately fades into a violent melodrama of easy irony and pointless pathos.",1970-06-30T05:00:00+0000
