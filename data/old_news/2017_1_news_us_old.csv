Hell be serving ravioli filled with smoked brisket in red-wine sauce and truffle butter, silky cod cheeks with crispy country ham and vinegar peppers, smoked duck confit with a sweet-and-sour glaze, a tomahawk chop and that must-have at cocktail events, pigs in blankets. I wanted to elevate what I was doing at Pig Beach, he said. Smoke is a theme here, but its more refined. To make it clear that this light and airy restaurant, decorated with some midcentury modern elements, is not just about barbecue, hes also serving seafood and vegetable dishes. Wines come from around the world, and theres a clever winter julep with rye on the cocktail list. As at Pig Beach, his partners are the chefs Ed McFarland and Shane McBride, but they are not in the kitchen. Pig Beach will close in February to add more indoor space, and will reopen in May (Opens Jan. 17): 155 Bleecker Street (Thompson Street), 646-756-5115.",2017-01-03T21:10:23+0000

It punctured the fuel tank on a Titan missile, and the resulting chaos, recounted by those who experienced the moment, is alarming.

When events throw them back together, the chasm between them doesnt simply disappear; it must be painstakingly bridged. Both the director and Ms. Scharf are to be on hand for Wednesdays two screenings at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.

us,"With Rise of Body Cameras, New Tests of Transparency and Trust","Body-worn cameras are reshaping perceptions of policing. The small devices, typically mounted on officers shirts, provide a lens into law enforcement that is meant to build transparency and trust. But their increased use has also raised a host of questions and concerns: Who should have access to recordings? How will the footage be used? What are the privacy rights of people caught on video? And what are the long-term costs to taxpayers? Across the country, police departments large and small are rolling out expensive body-camera programs without consistent answers to the questions or, according to policy experts, convincing evidence that the cameras ensure the level of accountability that the public demands.

(The most interesting thing about the spraying from a big industrial gun, Ms. Grosse said, is that it makes you so much bigger.) Now she arrives on perhaps the biggest commercial stage in the New York art world. Her first gallery show in the city, at Gagosian in Chelsea, opening Thursday, Jan. 19, features work from the past year that continues to blur the distinction between two and three dimensions, borne of the conviction, as she once said, that paint has to be voluminous if it is to achieve presence.

By then, she had also held a recurring role (leading a fictional band) in the series Transparent; done some modeling; and started writing Cherry Glazerrs second album, Apocalipstick, out Friday, Jan. 20. She has soaked up a history of womens punk, post-punk and grunge, glancing toward Blondie, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Go-Gos, Sleater-Kinney and Hole among others, and she makes melody a priority whether a song barrels ahead at punk speed or digs into a sharp-elbowed midtempo riff. On Apocalipstick, Cherry Glazerr has grown from three members to four, and it moves beyond the lo-fi sound and throwaway sarcasm of the bands debut. Ms. Creevy, 19, has a lot on her mind: female solidarity, junk food, insecurity, wildness, even thoughts about professionalism. And she sings like she has most of the answers.

Then theres the problem of definition. One mans civility is another mans repression.

Or were they the ones demanding civility, in the form of simple recognition of the lives of people with AIDS? Is Donald Trump dangerously boorish?

Its not all questionable science and impossible aspirations, though. The Telomere Effect, an anti-aging book new at No.15 on the hardcover nonfiction list, was written by a couple of honest-to-God scientists: Elizabeth Blackburn, president of the Salk Institute and a 2009 Nobel laureate in medicine, and Elissa Epel, a health psychologist who directs the Aging, Metabolism and Emotion Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The quick version of their book, and their research, is that our chromosomes rely on protective caps (called telomeres) akin to the tips that keep shoelaces from fraying; healthy living, they claim, can preserve or even restore those caps to slow the effects of aging. Move your body, Blackburn advised listeners of WNYC radio this month, in an interview with the journalist Jonathan Capehart in which she also casually deployed the correct term for those shoelace tips. (Theyre aglets.) Everyone thinks, Oh, I have to run marathons and join expensive gyms and things like that. It turns out really brisk walking, even for short periods of time every day, buffers or alleviates some of the stress-related telomere shortening that happens in chronically stressed people. This is very encouraging, because even if you have a short lunchtime, you can get out and really briskly walk 10 minutes every day. ... Its totally doable, and its free.",2017-01-13T16:34:27+0000

One of them, Outsiders, begins its second season Tuesday, Jan. 24, with a high bar of crazy to clear if it wants to top Season 1. The show is about the Farrell clan, which has lived atop a mountain in Appalachia for several hundred years, keeping its distance from the world to the extent that it has even developed its own language (though these mountain men and women mostly speak in English). The Farrells way of life is threatened by the world down below and especially by a coal company that wants them evicted so it can mine the mountaintop, a plan that promises jobs and gives the series a current-events peg. Season 1 spent a lot of time on the Farrells internal power struggles. In Season 2, the outside world seems likely to be ever more intrusive. Its a big week for WGN: On Wednesday, Jan. 25, its witch drama, Salem, which is even odder than Outsiders, has its series finale after three seasons.",2017-01-18T21:16:36+0000

Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch play Dick and Mac McDonald, who must explain their process to Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton). To get the staff operating at maximum speeds, they took the workers to a tennis court and marked the court with chalk to approximate the kitchen. On the court they rehearsed each part of the cooking process and how they would work together, almost like a symphony. In an interview at The Times, the director John Lee Hancock explained that he hired a choreographer to help with the beats of the scene, even though no dancing is involved.

Noble virtues do not map neatly onto apex predators, a fact that troubled Benjamin Franklin as early as 1784.

Thats no surprise: With apologies to Thomas Piketty, whose Capital in the Twenty-First Century was a genuine phenomenon in 2014, the field isnt exactly sexy. But here comes David M. Smick, a global macroeconomic strategist (in the perky words of his official biography), whose new book, The Great Equalizer, argues that government should favor small businesses and entrepreneurs over big corporations; it enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No.8. Smick was Jack Kemps congressional chief of staff in the 1970s and 80s, and he still leans Republican  he supported Marco Rubios presidential run and donated nearly $100,000 to Republican candidates in the last election cycle. But discussing the financial industry and its excesses, he can sound as fiery and populist as any Bernie Sanders stump speech. The true shame of the 2008 financial crisis is that the big and the powerful were the most protected, he writes. It is clear why working families today are so angry. After 2008, if you were a failed, brain-dead Wall Street banker who nearly tanked the world economy, you had easy access to the Federal Reserves cheap liquidity. If you failed as a giant bank, you were considered special. Your bank could systemically bring down the entire financial system. But if you were a struggling enterprise out there alone with a brilliant idea that could someday employ thousands of people, obtaining financing was next to impossible. The normal sources of risk capital had dried up, but no one from Washington, D.C., was there with your safety net. The too-big-to-fail banks enjoyed a cost of borrowing far lower than other firms because financial markets became convinced government authorities would never let the big banks go under.

us,48 Hours With Diors Maria Grazia Chiuri,"On Saturday, while 673 womens marches were taking place in cities across the world, Maria Grazia Chiuri, the new artistic director of Christian Dior, was fitting her spring/summer 2017 couture collection in Paris. She was wearing a T-shirt from her first Dior collection printed with Chimamanda Ngozi Adichies line We Should All Be Feminists, worn underneath a black wool Bar jacket from the same collection, whose name and curvaceous silhouette is an homage to the tailleur Bar, a suit from Diors 1947 debut. Fashion often echoes the mood of the times, subconsciously or otherwise. Yves Saint Laurent designed a collection inspired by the May 1968 Paris riots; by contrast, Diors New Look was a salve for the wounds of wartime, making people forget the hardships and revel in luxury. For her collection, Chiuri interprets the New Look again, in ivory organza with a peplum of pleats above wide chiffon culottes. Its an ensemble whose inherent lightness and elastic ease of movement feels like a reflection of that juxtaposition of contemporary feminism (the slogan T-shirt) and historical throwback (the Bar jacket) currently on her own back.",2017-01-24T16:15:40+0000

The dream-deprived nod off quickly, sleep soundly and emerge from sleep fully awake. So before going to bed, drink three full glasses of water  not beer or wine, because they suppress R.E.M. sleep  which will force you to get up and go to the bathroom. Middle-of-the-night awakenings are frequently accompanied by dream recall, Stickgold says.

City Lights published Frank OHara, along with Allen Ginsberg and many others who first fused some of the same styles that Poirier continues to explore.

We were there to be observed. Reporters had been following Trump all year. Early rallies had been covered as curiosities; later ones as political mass spectacles.

But he began to get better, and that September he celebrated his second birthday  a milestone that had seemed impossible. Blood work revealed that the cancer had disappeared.

Subtitled A Sermon to White America, the book is a stark polemic about race relations, including discussions of police shootings, affirmative action and black-on-black crime (which Dyson sees as a consequence of mere proximity, what he calls the geography of despair). But in keeping with an author who has previously written about Bill Cosby and the rapper Nas, among other subjects  and who contributed a list of blue-eyed soul stars to his recent interview with The New York Times Magazine  Dyson also makes room for extensive references to pop culture. The book is dedicated to the Knowles women (Beyonc, Solange and Tina Knowles-Lawson) and includes an early chapter called Hymns of Praise in which Dyson singles out a number of politically conscious black musicians as our griots. Its a smart move, since pop music has often provided a channel for white audiences to learn more about black culture. So what artists does Dyson recommend? N.W.A, KRS-One, the Fugees (and their lead singer, Lauryn Hill), Tupac Shakur, Jay Z, Kendrick Lamar and  of course  the genius and greatest living entertainer, Beyonc herself. Of their songs, Dyson writes: These and a thousand others are the hymns that answer the reign of terror that consumes our days. These are the hymns that rally us against the fantasy of our erasure. May these hymns be sung loud until our slaughter ceases and our blood no longer spills.",2017-01-27T17:54:19+0000

To answer: Yes, back in 2000, from a food truck outside the Peking Opera School, which we were visiting in Beijing. They were delicious. I had forgotten about jianbing until very recently, as a few people in New York have started making them. Mr. Goldberg, a Chinese scholar who grew up in Spring Valley, N.Y., in Rockland County, became a professional luge racer and worked in finance before running a couple of places in Hong Kong. He decided a few years ago to do something, he said, that would be interesting and make people happy. Hed like to do his part to make jianbing as mainstream as ramen. At his colorful stand, cooks spread a thin film of batter made with mung bean and rice flours onto a griddle, break an egg on it, add herbs and condiments, flip it, roll it and cut it in two. He has come up with nontraditional versions with roast duck, marinated chicken or roast pork. The stand also sells smashed cucumber salad, steamed dumplings and, soon, an egg, cheese and ham breakfast bing and sweet dessert versions. Mr. Goldberg has also taken on a couple of partners and has plans for expansions, including a brick-and-mortar shop opening in March next to his commissary in Chelsea: Mr Bing, UrbanSpace Vanderbilt, 45th Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, mr-bing.com.",2017-01-31T20:36:10+0000
