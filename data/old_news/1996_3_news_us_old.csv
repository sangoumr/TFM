us,Books in Brief: FICTION;Death of a Parrot Salesman,"Archy McNally is a raffish combination of Dashiell Hammett's Nick Charles and P. G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster: a charmingly spoiled, overgrown adolescent with a taste for booze, an eye for the ladies and a nose for trouble, not to mention a highfalutin vocabulary and a gift for the wisecrack. In McNALLY'S PUZZLE (Putnam, $24.95), Lawrence Sanders's sixth book of ""discreet inquiries"" starring McNally -- who ""works"" for his father's stuffy law firm -- the somewhat ridiculous sleuth must dig into the gruesome death of a millionaire parrot-shop owner named Hiram Gottschalk in an attempt to unravel the circumstances of his passing and the tangled mess of the family he leaves behind. As usual, Mr. Sanders's thin story line takes a back seat to the verbal and social antics of McNally and his cronies: what is on the menu at the ""exclusive"" Pelican Club is more important than any particular clue, and serious sleuthing can be at least temporarily diverted by a well-made gimlet. The real focus is on Archy's prancing and preening and so-called life of the mind as he tools around south Florida entertaining the millionaire's twin daughters, fencing with his housekeeper and tracking the bizarre activities -- parrot smuggling is one, perhaps -- of Gottschalk's troubled stepson. Helping McNally with his rounds is his lovable if brainless sidekick, Binky Watrous, who falls in love this time with a tambourine-banging Irishwoman, and a scrappy mutt named Hobo, whose star turn includes soothing McNally's frayed nerves and providing more than one well-timed rescue.

The intensity and boldness of his genius plus the sheer exhilaration of being in his company kept you from thinking about the threat to his health; he had such valor and style, and lived at such a deliberate distance from self-pity and personal complaint, you were inclined to forget that he was as mortal as the next one.

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Fractured Fairy Tales,"Julie Taymor is one of the most remarkable theater artists of the last two decades, though she unfortunately remains known to only a relatively small group of cognoscenti. Like the works she creates, Ms. Taymor is not easily classifiable; she is a director, a designer, a mask and puppet maker, a choreographer, film maker and fabulist. She creates worlds of visual splendor and an almost childlike fantasy that, like good fairy tales, reveal grotesquerie and even horror just barely beneath the surface. Her work as a designer and director reflects her literal and artistic journeys through Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Bali, Japan and Paris and her apprenticeships with Joseph Chaikin, Herbert Blau and the Bread and Puppet Theater. This background has resulted in productions of Shakespeare, opera and original works in which the visual, the narrative and the symbolic are inseparable. Ms. Taymor integrates techniques and esthetics from a wide variety of theatrical cultures. But unlike some contemporary directors who seem to plunder other cultures for inspiration only to come up with mere superficial borrowings, she creates a unique yet somehow familiar vocabulary that, as Eileen Blumenthal, a professor of theater arts at Rutgers University, says in her highly readable JULIE TAYMOR, PLAYING WITH FIRE: Theater, Opera, Film (Abrams, $49.50), is a ""new theatrical organism."" Ms. Taymor, who collaborated on the book with Ms. Blumenthal, describes each of the 15 productions she has designed or directed since her work in Bali in the mid-1970's. This book will be of interest to anyone who wonders where the magic, spirit and theatricality of the theater have gone in recent times, or to anyone who values the visual and creative imagination.

Citing Ernest Hemingway's famously unhesitating assertion that ""all modern American literature"" comes from ""Huckleberry Finn,"" Ms. Smiley argues that American literature would have been better off if it had grown instead out of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" one of the few novels that may be said to have had a pronounced effect on events.",1996-03-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: FICTION & POETRY;Starving at the Banquet,"Originally published in 1873 and until now not easily available in English translation, mile Zola's novel THE BELLY OF PARIS (Sun and Moon, paper, $14.95) recounts the sad story of Florent, a young schoolteacher sent to prison after being falsely accused of resisting Louis Napoleon's coup d'tat in 1851. At the novel's opening, seven years have passed; Florent has escaped and returned to Paris half dead of starvation only to find himself lost in the sprawling, Lucullan new markets of Les Halles, overwhelmed by ""an avalanche of food."" These markets provide the book's true focus, as Zola chronicles the vigorous, greedy intrigues of butchers, fishwives, poultry sellers and butter dealers, all of whom feel first irritated, then threatened by the sight of this morose, idealistic, skinny young man. To Florent, the markets ""appeared symbolical of some glutted, digesting beast, of Paris, wallowing in its fat and silently upholding the Empire"" that has treated him so cruelly. Clearly that's also how they appeared to Zola, who, in Ernest Alfred Vizetelly's translation, minutely describes this ""colossal belly"" -- from the damp, odorous fish stalls to the mountains of fleshy produce in the vegetable and fruit pavilions. As Florent becomes increasingly repelled by Louis Napoleon's mercantile Paris and begins to plot an ill-fated insurrection, these descriptions turn monstrous. Never before has cheese seemed so sinister: ""A Livarot was swarming with life; and in a fragile box behind the scales a Grom flavored with aniseed diffused such a pestilential smell that all around it the very flies had fallen lifeless on the gray-veined slab of ruddy marble."" The novel's appeal lies, of course, in Zola's descriptive brilliance, his ability to paint this brutal, teeming world of food with the confidence of a Dutch master. But the political conflict, personified by scrawny Florent and the overfed shopkeepers, is artfully rendered as well. This is not a book for dieters -- or those with delicate stomachs.

Naturally, her family had not been pleased at the prospect, and on the appointed day they planned their first move: a dish that would be a piece de resistance in the truest sense of the term. That night for dinner, they served artichokes, but -- under cover of food shortages -- they provided only enough for the soldiers. Non, non, il n'y a pas de quoi, they said. You go ahead and enjoy them. They are such a delicacy, n'est-ce pas?

Among the parters are several New York sports figures, including Brian Leetch of the Rangers, Pat Kelly of the Yankees, the fighter Shannon Briggs and Howard Cross of the Giants.

Since I'm fairly manic-depressive, I never don't have a reason to be in the throes of sugar shock. I don't smoke. I don't do drugs. I do sugar -- in massive doses. So what? Who doesn't?

She attributes its canonization to a propaganda initiative by a small group of literary critics, among them Lionel Trilling and T. S. Eliot, soon after World War II. She sees this as part of a longstanding cultism that assigns a dominant position to ""white, Protestant, middle-class male authors"" -- Emerson, Hawthorne and Melville, for example -- while relegating women authors, especially authors of best-selling novels, to the kitchen middens of Parnassus. Citing Ernest Hemingway's famously unhesitating assertion that ""all modern American literature"" comes from ""Huckleberry Finn,"" Ms. Smiley argues that American literature would have been better off if it had grown instead out of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" one of the few novels that may be said to have had a pronounced effect on events.",1996-03-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: FICTION & POETRY;The World Around the Corner,"In the years following the Civil War, emancipated slaves poured into the nation's capital, often ending up in cramped and hidden alley neighborhoods. Overcrowding and lack of sanitation attracted reformers, and by the turn of the century a movement to eradicate these pestilential areas was under way. Reform legislation, urban planning schemes, two wars and documentary photographers like Lewis Hine came and went before the neighborhoods were finally razed in a redevelopment effort in the 1950's. In 1943, a social worker named Godfrey Frankel (1912-95) took his camera and rode a bicycle into one of these alleys, ready to expose the capital's squalid underside. To his surprise, what he discovered during repeated afternoon forays was something richer and more complex -- a community and its children, which are portrayed in IN THE ALLEYS: Kids in the Shadow of the Capitol (Smithsonian, cloth, $55; paper, $24.95), with text by Laura Goldstein, a freelance Washington journalist, and a foreword by the photographer Gordon Parks. Mr. Parks also visited the alleys in the early 1940's, and describes them as dirty, disgruntled and gloomy, but Frankel's images portray a more benign environment. The sun raking across the uneven brick passageways and peeling wooden steps where troops of small children gather suggest stability and warmth. When Frankel's subjects face his camera, their expressions range from grave to gleeful, their integrity never in doubt. Ragged clothes become symbols of pluck and resourcefulness rather than despair. Ms. Goldstein provides an affectionate biography of Frankel and a history of the Washington alleys.

us,The Birth of a Theatrical Comet,"IT BURST on the scene seemingly out of nowhere, this pulsing musical with the beat and cadences of the East Village. Almost instantly, the glowing reviews started pouring in, and limousines began pulling up in front of the modest New York Theater Workshop, where the show opened last month. The show, of course, is ""Rent,"" the acclaimed rock musical that was inspired by Puccini's ""Boheme"" and that is already bound for Broadway. ""Rent"" was quickly hailed as a rock opera for our time, a ""Hair"" for the 90's. Its reception has been made poignant by the fact that its creator, Jonathan Larson, died just before the opening, at the age of 35. The show really didn't arrive out of nowhere, though. It was born of one man's vision and determination. The story of how it came to be also serves as a reminder of the vibrant theatrical life that exists beyond Broadway and how that life nourishes Broadway. The making of ""Rent"" is a classic theatrical tale of luck, grit, ambition and, finally, applause. By Anthony Tommasini. Page 7. The cast is an ensemble, but each performer has a singular tale to tell. By Peter Marks. Page 7. What the world of classical music can learn from ""Rent."" By Bernard Holland.

RICHARD GILMAN'S book, as he acknowledges in his introduction, is rooted in an obsession. Traveling around Russia in the glasnost year 1989, he was ""continually remembering Chekhov stories and plays, inspired by an incident, a face, a venue . . . or even by an object such as a samovar, which always makes me think of 'Uncle Vanya,' or an old clock, which brings to mind 'Three Sisters.' "" Even upon his arrival at Sheremetevo Airport in Moscow -- a most unromantic place -- he saw some straggly birches and remembered Chekhov's phrase ""dear, modest birches."" But above all it was at Yalta, where the doctor-playwright spent the last years of his short life, that the visiting American felt happily overwhelmed. The annual meeting of the Chekhov Society was taking place; he was impressed by the sense he had of all being on intimate terms with their hero. Invited unexpectedly to speak, he gave a ""rambling and disjointed"" talk, which received ""a generous round of applause."" Following an interview on Crimean television, he saw his image in a newspaper, ""bearded, gesturing, a Chekhov fanatic.""",1996-03-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Cajun Charm,"Thirty years after moving to New Orleans from staid Charleston, Rosemary James still revels in the city's mildewed grandeur. The formalities typical of the South -- swags at the windows, a parlor full of coordinated Chippendale -- are distorted in a town where masquerade confronts the tropical swelter of the bayou. Faux finishes, saturated color and elaborate ornamentation are the essence of New Orleans style, to which James, an interior designer, has brought her own sense of exaggerated elegance, for a look she calls Swamp Palazzo. You can see it in her own period gem: a 19th-century town house in the French Quarter, once a plantation owner's pied-a-terre, with wrought-iron balconies overlooking a garden. (Her husband, Joseph deSalvo, runs a bookstore on the ground floor, where William Faulkner wrote his first novel, ""Soldiers' Pay."") Ten-foot windows and wide-plank cypress floors belie the diminutive size of the building, which has four tiny rooms per floor crammed with Louis XVI, Directoire and Napoleonic campaign furniture -- all chosen for its small scale and, believe it or not, says James, its comfort. Her palette is a curious blend of down-to-earth and dreamily evocative colors. The parlor and the dining room are what she calls Empire green, a shade appropriate to the early 19th century and the only hue that she and her husband could agree on. James imagined the bedroom with its violet walls, tented bed and striped chairs as a private homage to the country boudoir of Empress Josephine. In James's studio, a daybed made of two antique headboards sits directly in front of double doors thrown open to a garden. Fortunately, Swamp Palazzo is a very forgiving style, indifferent to the effects of sun and age on moire draperies and taffeta slipcovers. Time only renders it all the more splendid.",1996-03-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: FICTION & POETRY;Rumpole Returns,"First-rate comic writing is often more difficult to produce than the serious stuff, and real pros are few and far between. One of these is John Mortimer, an Englishman best known in this country for his mystery stories starring the comic and gallant barrister Horace Rumpole. Mr. Mortimer knows his territory, and his comments on the vagaries of the English legal system and the small value it places on common sense and moral standards are as sharp as ever in RUMPOLE AND THE ANGEL OF DEATH (Viking, $22.95), the 10th volume of stories in the series. In Rumpole, Mr. Mortimer has created a wonderfully durable and attractive character, henpecked as a husband but masterful with a jury, an honest man whose only cause is ""preventing the conviction of the innocent."" Rumpole's true home is the courtroom, but we are also made privy to life in the gloomy flat in Froxbury Mansions where he exists in pitiful thralldom to his wife, Hilda, otherwise known as She Who Must Be Obeyed. This moniker notwithstanding, the forbidding Hilda has occasional moments of decency, and Rumpole fans will be amused to find one story narrated by Hilda herself, in which she reveals surprisingly romantic yearnings as she contemplates an affair with a smarmy colleague of her husband's. In his happy ability to play a seemingly infinite number of diverting variations on the same theme, in the fluidity and panache of his prose, his combination of high intelligence and low foolery, John Mortimer is worthy of comparison to P. G. Wodehouse. ""Rumpole and the Angel of Death,"" like all of the preceding Rumpole volumes, makes for ideally civilized light reading. Brooke Allen",1996-03-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Doisneau's Paris,"Near the end of ROBERT DOISNEAU: A Photographer's Life (Abbeville, $75), Peter Hamilton explains that his book was ""supposed to be the 'definitive' monograph"" about the French photographer, born in 1912, who spent his life documenting the sometimes lonely beauty, enduring romance and comic contrasts he found in Paris and its suburbs from the 1920's to the 80's. A sociologist, Mr. Hamilton was clearly able to understand that Doisneau's art was deeply rooted, reflecting both his pride of place and his humanism. A typical photograph from the 30's shows carefree boys watching a merry-go-round. A shot of a coal ration card against a snow-covered Paris Opera illustrates the hardships of the occupation. A photograph of unkempt children in an empty, cobblestoned Paris square speaks of France's dreary 50's; and new suburban concrete overpasses and modern apartment buildings show up in Doisneau's late pictures. Doisneau's death in 1994, before the book's completion, obviously came as a personal loss for the author. ""Robert Doisneau: A Photographer's Life"" is less exhaustive than it appears, for all its nearly 400 dense, oversized pages, with almost as many striking duotone and color reproductions, and the appendixes and interviews. For one thing, many of the book's pages could have been better used to show photographs and to provide details about projects only mentioned in passing, rather than to describe Doisneau's very static life (he inhabited the same suburban apartment from 1937 on and almost never traveled abroad). Most important, Mr. Hamilton eschews any real discussion of Doisneau's frequent use of models, actors and mises-en-scne in order to re-create scenes of daily life. His world-famous 1950 photograph ""Baiser de l'H/tel de Ville,"" for instance, was far from being documentary; it was staged. Without an exploration of the practice of presenting as candid something that isn't, and of the ethical and photo-historical questions it raises, a monograph about Doisneau can't be definitive.

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Discarded Places,"Since 1977, Camilo Jose Vergara, a native Chilean, has been training his camera on some of the poorest neighborhoods in several of this country's poorest cities. His photographs, with accompanying text, record an intriguing but often depressing landscape in THE NEW AMERICAN GHETTO (Rutgers University, $49.95). Mr. Vergara writes that he viewed his mission as documenting in pictures the ""discarded and dangerous places"" that are rarely traversed by people who do not live or work there. Returning again and again to the same street corner over a decade or more, he provides ample visual evidence of how a neighborhood and even specific buildings deteriorate over the years and disappear. Mr. Vergara's nine images of 178th Street and Vyse Avenue in the South Bronx, the first taken in June 1980, show an expansive brick apartment building in various states of decay. By January 1986, all that remains is a crumbling brick facade. In the final photograph, taken in October 1994, four or five new town houses have sprouted up, and two automobiles are parked out front on the street. ""Two Bronxes are visible in these photographs: one that died too soon and one too flimsy to last,"" he writes. There are some signs of hope in his photo gallery: his camera has captured the new homes that have supplanted barren buildings, the tenacious presence of the church in even the most rundown communities and the arresting and colorful murals, many dedicated to black history and tradition, which belie the crime and grime that pervade Mr. Vergara's world.

us,Books in Brief: FICTION;Beyond Words,"Between the world wars, wordless picture novels were produced by visionary artists like Lynd Ward and Frans Masereel, both of whom were masters of the art of turning iconic images into acerbic narratives about human folly. After a period of decline, wordless novels have recently enjoyed a small revival as an offshoot of so-called graphic novels, which are themselves offshoots of comic books. Since the wordless novel relies so strongly on visual shorthand, it is often a difficult genre in which to express complex ideas and emotions. THE SILENT CITY (Kitchen Sink Press, paper, $24.95), Erez Yakin's story of the plight of individuals in an industrial totalitarian state, is by no means graphically simplistic; in fact, as Yevgeny Yevtushenko writes in his introduction, ""Erez Yakin screams with the silence of his drawings."" It is indeed remarkable that such powerfully and exquisitely rendered pictures -- reminiscent of George Grosz and Otto Dix's post-World War I antiwar prints -- were made in 1988, when the artist was just 18 years old. But it is no surprise that each image is more effective individually than as an element of a complete story. Mr. Yakin finds it difficult to keep his theme of totalitarian oppression from being a shrill echo of George Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty-four,"" replete with the common visual clichs of fascist brutality. Nevertheless, ""The Silent City"" is remarkable for its horrific portrayals of unbridled, demonic power, as well as for the difficult, oppressive darkness of its pictures, which makes them at times barely reproducible. ""The Silent City"" may not have pushed the limits of the wordless novel beyond what was accomplished in the 1930's, but it proves that Erez Yakin is a virtuoso image maker, a gifted artist at the beginning of what might well be a brilliant career.

CLEARS TRADES OF SPRING STREET STOCK ON INTERNET,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has cleared the way for a New York brewer to resume a pioneering Internet trading system for its stock. The Spring Street Brewing Company case is being viewed as a test of the S.E.C.'s flexibility in allowing companies to use new technology to tap financial markets. Last week, Spring Street said it was suspending its bulletin board stock trading system, named ""Wit-Trade"" after the company's Wit Beer, after S.E.C. lawyers expressed reservations. Wit-Trade, based on Spring Street's World Wide Web page (http://plaza.interport.net/witbeer/), lets buyers and sellers post prices and meet via electronic mail. After agreeing to a trade by contract, the parties send money and stock certificates to Spring Street to complete the trade. Andrew D. Klein, Spring Street's chief executive, said the S.E.C. sent a letter on Friday that ""gives us essentially a green light to resume Wit-Trade with some modifications."" The S.E.C. said Spring Street should have a bank or an escrow agent handle customer funds.

us,Stirrings,"VTAL DUST Life as a Cosmic Imperative. By Christian de Duve. 362 pp. New York: Basic Books. Paper, $14. WHEN Charles Darwin wrote the ""Origin of Species,"" he deliberately refused to speculate about the first beginnings of life, claiming he hardly knew enough to make any lasting contribution, and he held back from discussing what he really thought about the mental world of human beings, the highest point of the evolutionary process. Caution was necessary. Excited talk about spontaneous generation of insects occurring after electricity was run through overripe cheeses, and inflammatory, tub-thumping sermons on the miracle of divine creation, made the first stirrings of life on Earth the most perplexing and fascinating problem of the era. Similarly, to discuss the human mind as if its action were nothing more than the mechanical product of the brain might invite a storm of protest. Darwin therefore kept his evolutionary proposals inside strict self-imposed limits -- and was aghast when the hurricane that gathered raged around the very issues he studiously ignored. It is extraordinary how much more is now known about these mysterious beginnings and endings, the parts of the evolutionary panorama that Darwin left out. Over the last 30 years or so the whole emphasis of research has shifted toward opening up the world of the minute, the vibrant hidden frontiers of life. Christian de Duve's ""Vital Dust,"" published in 1995 and now reissued in a welcome paperback format, provides an astonishingly full account of this new story about life, as lucid and engaging as the ""Origin"" itself. Here is the entire sweep of what is known about living matter.",1996-03-31T05:00:00+0000
us,Books in Brief: FICTION;A Star Is Torn,"No, INFAMOUS (Dutton, $23.95) isn't that manuscript -- the one Joan Collins's former Random House editors recently described to a Manhattan jury as uneditable piffle. ""Infamous"" is a later oeuvre, one that Rosemary Cheetham, a top English editor, proudly offered the same jury as proof that Miss Collins's writing could indeed be redeemed, albeit with extraordinary editorial effort. Having read ""Infamous,"" I now know that Ms. Cheetham committed esthetic perjury, which carries the cruel and unusual sentence of having to read the unpublished Random House manuscript. Aloud. ""Infamous"" (on which Ms. Cheetham testified she spent an enormous amount of work) is moderately coherent, all right, but whatever sense of salacious fun Miss Collins may have brought to the manuscript has been lost. The writing just isn't cheesy enough. With metronome-like dutifulness, ""Infamous"" tracks the endless travails of Katherine Bennet, an actress popular for her role as a wealthy villainess on a nighttime television soap opera and an obvious stand-in for Miss Collins, who played Alexis Carrington Colby on ""Dynasty."" If Katherine Bennet is the poisonous Georgia Skeffington on the small screen, everywhere else she is a long-suffering victim -- generous, loving, faithful nad constantly betrayed. But who wants to read a ""Gone With the Wind"" as told by Melanie Hamilton? By the last 100 pages, it is clear that Ms. Cheetham's insistence that Miss Collins's work can be made readable is just flat-out wrong. The final episodes, in which Katherine realizes that her fabulous new husband is a full- blown psychopath, are so execrably written that they threaten to give popcorn fiction a bad name.

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Rabbits Redux,"Alicia Ezpeleta has written that rare rabbit book for adults that does not feature the words ""with brown gravy"" anywhere. Instead, she has produced a delightful compendium of lagomorph lore, profusely illustrated with reproductions of artworks and artifacts culled from a vast array of world cultures -- from ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics to 20th-century American cartoon characters. ""Rabbits have represented almost every emotion, ideal, foible and personality trait known to humanity,"" she writes in RABBITS EVERYWHERE (Abrams, $24.95), and she goes on to explore the rabbit's role as a symbol for such things as sexuality, fertility, purity, luck and cunning in various societies. The text not only touches on the best known of the literary long-ears -- the Easter Bunny, Peter Rabbit, the March Hare, Br'er Rabbit -- but delves into the lives of the less publicized as well, including the heroic hares of both Buddhist and African fables. Despite the rabbit's affectionate place in the hearts of many, Ms. Ezpeleta, an interior designer, reveals that a few cultures weren't very fond of them: the Vikings lumped them in the same category as sea monsters, and the ancient Celts assumed that rabbits purposely lived underground because of their affiliation with darker powers. The giant demon-bunny absconding with a young maiden carved into a portal of the Chartres Cathedral is a little unsettling compared with the familiar images of Bugs and Thumper, and the author even manages to link similar medieval notions of evil to the role of killer rabbit in the movie ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" Ms. Ezpeleta takes a grand hop through rabbit history, noting along the way that the same creatures used to represent immortality and rebirth in the old Chinese, Greek and Roman legends can be seen even today fulfilling the same role in television's Energizer Bunny commercials.
