us,Ohio: Sites of Two Earthquakes Nearly Identical,"The 4.0 magnitude earthquake that struck Youngstown on Saturday occurred at an almost identical location to one a week before, a seismologist who studied the quakes said Monday. Both earthquakes occurred close to the bottom of a 9,200-foot-deep disposal well where for months, brine and other liquid waste from natural-gas wells had been injected under pressure. They were the 10th and 11th earthquakes to occur near the well since March, but the first to be precisely located. The finding provides further evidence to support what some scientists had suspected: that the waste, from the drilling process called hydraulic fracturing that is used to unlock natural gas from shale rock, might have migrated from the disposal well into deeper rock formations, allowing an ancient fault to slip. Similar links between hydraulic-fracturing disposal wells and earthquakes have been suspected in recent years in Texas and Arkansas. John Armbruster, a seismologist with Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, part of Columbia University, said that the epicenter of the quake Saturday was about 100 meters, or 110 yards, from that a 2.7-magnitude quake on Dec. 24. There were a few reports of minor damage from the earthquake on Saturday, but none from any of the earlier quakes. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources reached an agreement last week with the owner of the disposal well, D&L Energy, to halt operations indefinitely and issued a moratorium on further development of disposal wells in the area until the analysis of the 4.0 quake was completed.

Pleated frocks with sailor-striped hemlines, dainty silk blouses with neck ties and collars, and sportier knits and tennis skirts stand out as some of the lines most wearable pieces. My goal was not to duplicate anything from my main collection, Wu says. Instead I designed completely new clothes and accessories that reflect my taste and have a voice of their own. Friendly reminders of Wus work (like the touch of lace on a trench coat or T-shirt) are matched with a delightful dose of animal humor.

The apartment belonged to Doubleday & Company, my employer, and was used by the occasional sojourner from the New York office, though there was no Doubleday business in Paris to justify such luxury. At the age of 25 I was such a sojourner, rewarded for having created a successful new paperback format that would become the industry standard. In Paris I visited the offices of the great French publishing houses Gallimard, Plon and Hachette, and in the evening Barbara and I were treated to Krug and La Tche at Le Grand Vfour and Chez Allard, where we chatted with our hosts about the Sartre-Camus quarrel, the emerging cold war and the calamity of Senator Joseph McCarthy. If Paris was the scene of a postwar literary revival, no one we met had heard of it.

After Heydrichs elaborate funeral ceremony at the new Reich Chancellery in Berlin, Hitler screamed at the Czech president, Emil Hacha, Nothing can prevent me from deporting millions of Czechs if they do not wish for peaceful coexistence. It wasnt an idle threat. Since the violent death of Heydrich, Mann lamented, terror is raging everywhere, in a more sickly, unrestrained fashion than ever before. . . . An entire town, that supposedly sheltered the perpetrators, is massacred and razed. Indeed, to honor Heydrich and help create what Hitler referred to as Germanys Garden of Eden in the East, the Nazis chose the code name Aktion Reinhard for the extermination of two million people, most of whom were Jewish, in the General Government of Poland by the end of 1943.",2012-01-06T17:07:33+0000

An unerring craftsman, he can fully describe a murder in one rich sentence: The first time he killed the man, Jepperson, an opinionated foreigner from Minnesota, he kept to simple Ozark tradition and used a squirrel rifle, bullet to the heart, classic and effective, though there were spasms of the limbs and even a lunge of big old Jeppersons body that seemed like he was about to take a step, flee, but he died in stride and collapsed against a fence post.

Bacchus is a horse, not a bare-chested hunk, and the 15-year-old girl crying into his neck is about to risk her life facing down the villain who abducted her sister. (Spoiler alert: the climax involves a hoof pick as a weapon.) Whats more, Bacchus isnt even fictional.

Eisenhower, who in 1952 became the first Republican in 24 years to be elected president. His principal opponent for the nomination, Senator Robert Taft of Ohio, had opposed the New Deal and was a staunch isolationist who opposed supporting Britain in the first years of World War II. Eisenhower represented a more pragmatic strain of conservatism, internationalist when it came to foreign policy and willing to accept a larger government role at home.

The man, Juan Rivera, 39, had been incarcerated at the Stateville Correctional Center in the far southwest suburbs of Chicago. The Lake County states attorney, Michael Waller, in a statement defended his offices prosecution of Mr. Rivera, whose case was featured in an article in The New York Times Magazine. I am mindful that for Mr. Rivera and some others, this decision will be viewed as too late in coming, Mr. Waller said. Though there was no physical evidence linking Mr. Rivera to the crime, he was convicted of raping and murdering the baby sitter, Holly Staker, based largely on his confession. In 2005, DNA testing determined that Mr. Rivera was not the source of semen found inside Holly, and he was awarded a new trial, his third. Mr. Rivera was convicted again. In its reversal order last month, the appellate court suggested that Mr. Riveras confession was coerced. The investigation into Hollys murder has been reopened. ",2012-01-07T01:10:13+0000

The accord will allow Exxon Mobil to develop this very large, but technically challenging, resource as quickly as possible using a phased approach, Patrick McGinn, a spokesman for Exxon, said in an e-mail. Exxon sued on Aug. 12 over a ruling by the department that canceled Gulf of Mexico leases for the so-called Julia unit. The company and the government entered into a settlement agreement on Dec. 30, according to a filing Friday in United States District Court in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Exxon said in its complaint that it sought a suspension for its Julia leases in 2008 because of drilling complexity. It cited federal regulations that allow oil oil producers to suspend production in their fields, partly to facilitate proper development of a lease. The Interior Department denied the request in 2009, stating that the companyhad not demonstrated a commitment to production according to court papers. Unsuccessful appeals followed.

Last year, the agency expressed disapproval of time-travel shows, which often involve a modern-day protagonists being propelled back into a dynastic era. The Marbridge report said that of more than 50 dramas in production at Hengdian World Studios in Zhejiang Province, more than 30 historical costume dramas had halted because of the new restrictions. Sarfts clampdown on historical dramas is occurring at the same time that it is limiting reality television programs, which it considers vulgar.

When the football sailed through one after a bad throw, it was a beautiful thing to watch  the spiraling ball taking a sweet, long ride. Wed hang from the second story windowsill and slip down to the street to get the ball. It was just another play.We got away with it because Mr. and Mrs. Murphy never got home before 6. Besides, where else could we go? We had no backyards, and it was the 1960s in New York City  we were barely allowed to ride the subways by ourselves, and grass fields were scarce. But I loved the sport. I carried my football everywhere, just in case anyone wanted to play catch. I slept with it to prevent fumbling. And even more important, I loved the New York Giants.

Haley Barbour in his final days in office. State Attorney General Jim Hood argued that granting clemency for some convicts was unconstitutional because the pardons had not been sufficiently publicized beforehand. Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Barbour, who left office Tuesday, issued a statement about the pardons, which have caused a storm of controversy. Of those granted clemency, 188 had already left prison, most of them years ago, it said, and the pardons were intended to allow them to find gainful employment or acquire professional licenses as well as hunt and vote. Of the 26 who were in custody, 13 were placed on indefinite suspension due to medical reasons because their health care expenses while incarcerated were costing the state so much money. The remaining number includes five inmates released on Sunday, including four men serving life sentences for murder, who had worked at the Governors Mansion. The judge ordered those five men to appear in court on Jan. 23. ",2012-01-12T02:45:27+0000

us,Lets Start Paying College Athletes,"I certainly agree with Joe Nocera that basketball and football players are treated like chattel in the present system. Denying players a basic stipend when coaches are making ridiculous amounts is the height of inequity. But paying football and mens basketball players isnt feasible, given Title IX regulations and politics. If you disconnect moneymaking sports, womens sports will very likely lose financing. Paying basketball and football players will not address the core problem of an unsustainable arms race in college sports. The proposition that the N.C.A.A. is in charge and can control college sports is a canard. If the N.C.A.A. pushes too hard, top conferences could create their own basketball playoff and challenge the N.C.A.A. tournament, which is currently a huge windfall for the N.C.A.A. Then the decentralization of power that began with the Supreme Court decision will only get worse. Your proposal offers an important contribution to the debate by arguing for stipends to players, the right to counsel and a defined scholarship term and the opportunity for lifetime health insurance. But getting there isnt going to be easy.",2012-01-13T15:16:47+0000
us,Why Write Novels at All?,"Last year, I found myself mildly obsessed with a cache of YouTube clips, featuring the novelists Jeffrey Eugenides, Jonathan Franzen, Zadie Smith, David Foster Wallace and Nathan Englander at a 2006 literary conference in Italy called Le Conversazioni. Part of what interested me, in a gate-crashing kind of way, was the backdrop: midsummer on the Isle of Capri, with flora aflame and a sky the color of Chablis. Another part, inevitably, was watching Wallace with the knowledge that he would kill himself two years later. Mostly what I kept coming back to, though, was how lighthearted, how loose  how young  these writers seemed here. Its not that they werent already an accomplished quintet, with a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award to their credit. But in 2006 the gravitational center of Anglo-American letters still lay back on U.S. soil with Don DeLillo and Cormac McCarthy and John Updike and Toni Morrison and Philip Roth  those towering figures who, according to a Times survey released earlier that year, produced the greatest American fiction of the previous quarter-century.

Furious at a system that she thought was unjust, Clark refused to be represented in court, trumpeted revolutionary action and ended up with a 75-year sentence that she is still serving. Over many visits and phone conversations, Robbins explored Clarks life behind bars and her slow transformation from unrepentant young radical to a reflective, deeply regretful model inmate.

Yet by the time of his death in 1900 at the age of 55, he had become the philosophical celebrity of his age. From Russia to America, admirers echoed his estimation of himself as a titanic figure who could alter the course of history: I am by far the most terrible human being that has existed so far; this does not preclude the possibility that I shall be the most beneficial. His origins were humble for the role. The son of a small-town Lutheran minister, he steeped himself in classical literature while growing up in eastern Germany. When he was 24, he secured a professorship in Basel, Switzerland, and a few years later published his first book, The Birth of Tragedy. Against the common view of the ancient Greeks as the epitome of serene equipoise, Nietzsche emphasized the Dionysian excess and frenzy that complemented the Apollonian virtues of clarity and repose. The books success was limited, and its author was mocked by one leading classicist as an atavist run amok who should gather tigers and panthers about his knees, but not the youth of Germany.",2012-01-13T17:50:07+0000

The same bad thing may also have convulsed France, where the story is set, because Houellebecqs Paris exists in a state of flagrant social breakdown and the countryside has become an emptied theme park of itself. This was exactly what the world would look like, a character thinks on entering a picturesque French village that only second-home-owners can afford to buy into, after the explosion of an intergalactic neutron bomb.",2012-01-13T17:51:31+0000

Hes a black comic whos alloyed the manic existential shtick of Lenny Bruce with the gallows humor thats been a staple of the repertoire since the Babylonian Exile. In his two previous books, Beware of God, a collection of wickedly funny if not just plain wicked stories, and Foreskins Lament, a memoir that torched the bridges to his strict Orthodox heritage, hes been relentlessly indicting the Hebrew God as a poor role model.

An excerpt of the letter was published by the Web site of Shargh, an Iranian reformist newspaper that has often been shut down by the government.

Some sort of marinated fish seemed to be the best idea, especially one that delivered bold swagger to welcome a red wine. Mackerel, sardines, wahoo or tuna were possible draft choices; a dozen fresh sardines on ice in the market made the team.

All of these operations and many more require a valid internal passport, a peculiar document that may be the most significant vestige of the U.S.S.R. in modern Russian society.Back when we lived behind the Iron Curtain, these passports entitled us to travel only within the confines of the Soviet Union. Anyone lucky enough to be allowed to travel abroad was issued a special foreign-travel passport just for the occasion and had to surrender it upon returning home. When Russians acquired the right to travel freely, they got to keep their foreign-travel passports. But the internal passport refused to die. So now each adult Russian citizen has two passports.

us,Slightly Fewer Viewers for This Years Golden Globes,"In a year in which nine of the top 10 movies at the box office have been sequels, perhaps it was appropriate that Ricky Gervais served up a slightly less compelling version of last years Golden Globe Awards. NBC said on Monday that its live Globes telecast on Sunday night drew 16.8 million viewers, down a whisker from last years 17 million. About 4 percent fewer people in the target demographic, adults age 18 to 49, tuned in, as measured by raw ratings points. (A 5.0 this year compared to a 5.2 last year.) NBC had heavily promoted Mr. Gervaiss acerbic comedic style as a reason to watch. As promised, he delivered a crude monologue  a repeat performance of 2011, when his remarks drew gasps  but shocking people twice with the same shtick is hard to pull off. Other factors possibly affecting interest in the show: NBC has limited ability to promote itself (the networks overall schedule remains in the ratings basement), and the Globes also celebrated a batch of smaller films like The Artist that have produced limited box-office results. Still, the telecast was a win for NBC, delivering the networks biggest audience, excluding sporting events, since last years Globes.",2012-01-16T20:00:06+0000

The university, one of Britains most renowned academic institutions, said in a statement that it was prepared to take disciplinary action. The universitys student newspaper said the drinking game involved arranging playing cards on a table in the shape of a swastika, and that players were required to salute the Fhrer. The student who claimed to have been assaulted was not identified by the university, but The Guardian newspaper, quoting an interview with him, said that he had left the card game after a mix of personal references and general Jewish insults, that led him to conclude that I couldnt forgive myself if I let it slide. The university was shaken by controversy last year over its decision to accept a $450,000 donation for research from a foundation run by Saif al-Islam al-Qaddafi, a son of the former Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi.

American tourists and businesspeople gravitate toward other German cities: Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt. And so Hamburg, bigger than all but Berlin, remains a bit of a mystery, poised to become a thrilling discovery. Did you know about the lake?

Hamburg in winter is cold and often gray. No getting around that. But the indoors migration of many Hamburg residents gives the city a quiet and peace that I relished on a recent visit.

Isherwood went to Stanford, where he was a generic English major: My mother bemoaned this fact, and remains pleasantly surprised that I am still employed today. I took classes in Shakespeare and Restoration comedy and Japanese theater, but never formally studied theater. For me college was basically an excuse to sit around reading Henry James novels, when I wasnt racing off to San Francisco in my secondhand Chevy Vega to see bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Gang of Four and dance all night at clubs.

us,Georges Remi: Learning His Lines,"Cartoonists are a peculiar breed of artist. For one thing, theyre hesitant about the use of the A-word. Their craft  now thats better  also comes with great constraints. Because the work appears in newspapers and comic books, it must strike a commercial chord quickly: there isnt much time for it to find an audience. The field doesnt boast many lonely geniuses whose work is discovered posthumously. The demands of reproduction put limits on complexity, and the panel format  those squares and rectangles  erects graphic walls. For successful cartoonists, producing every day on someone elses schedule, the grind is relentless. Cartoonists tend not to be boulevardiers; their way of life is sedentary and often solitary, and their days are spent in the company of invented characters in an invented world. Life and work can merge in curious ways. I happen to be the son of a cartoonist  a happy and well-adjusted cartoonist  and collaborated with him on Prince Valiant, but it was clear to all of us in the family that our situation was not quite normal. Or, thinking back to the moment when an electrician came into my fathers studio and found him posing  on his back, wearing a wig and a skirt, holding a garbage can lid as a shield and using a plunger on a rubber tube to snap a Polaroid  it may just have been that we had a different sense of what normal was.",2012-01-20T16:22:49+0000

us,The Shadow of Nuremberg,"On the campaign trail in June 2008, Barack Obama commented on the Supreme Courts extension of the constitutional right of habeas corpus to detainees held at the naval facility at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba. During the Nuremberg trials, part of what made us different was even after these Nazis had performed atrocities that no one had ever seen before, we still gave them a day in court, and that taught the entire world about who we are but also the basic principles of rule of law, Obama said. Now the Supreme Court upheld that principle yesterday, he added. Obamas statement linked Nuremberg to an idea central to his presidential campaign: The Bush administration in the fight against Islamist terrorists had compromised American values and undermined Americas wartime rule-of-law legacy. The Supreme Court had begun the task of restoring those values, Obama suggested, and he promised to finish the job as president. ",2012-01-20T16:25:04+0000

us,When Childrens Speech Turns Lethal,"In a career spanning nearly 20 years, Ben Marcus has written just four spare volumes: a story collection, two novels and a chapbook. Formally inventive, dark and dryly comic, this work has earned him critical praise and a small army of devoted fans. His prose is heavily metaphorical yet coolly ironic; it traffics in the language of scholarship, myth and history, and until now has forsaken the conventional trappings of narrative. Indeed, the pieces in The Age of Wire and String (1995) function more like prose poems than stories; their emotional impact is derived from their distinctive diction and syntax. The opener, Argument, might serve as a map of Marcuss early career, with its stated goal of cataloging a culture through an array of documents settling within the chief concerns of the society, of any society, of the world and its internal areas. The books archness is both bracing and absurd; it attempts to reinvent story by repurposing, gleefully, the jargon ordinarily used to analyze it.",2012-01-20T16:48:14+0000

(Though the Academy may nominate anywhere from 5 to 10 films this year, the Producers Guild stuck with 10.) Steven Spielbergs Adventures of Tintin won best animated film, and Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest earned the documentary feature prize. ABCs hit Modern Family took home the first award of the night, for best TV comedy, and Downton Abbey (PBS) won for best long-form show.

A vote has not yet been scheduled. If the measure passes, opponents are expected to challenge it through a ballot referendum this fall. For me personally, I have always believed in traditional marriage between a man and a woman, Ms. Haugen said in a statement. That is what I believe, to this day.

Kelly, who had been the chief executive since 2009, will become a special adviser to the company and an adviser to Bain Capital, the private equity firm that co-owns the company with the Blackstone Group and Comcasts NBCUniversal.The surprise change signaled a desire on the part of the co-owners to expand the Weather Channels digital and mobile businesses more quickly. Through mobile apps and Web sites like Weather.com, the company sees an opportunity to have a much bigger international footprint.Six and a half billion people need information about weather, Mr. Kenny said in an interview Tuesday after addressing the companys staff in Atlanta.Mr. Kenny also said that the company would make more investments in long-form programming  part of a gradual move away from live weather news and toward taped weather-related reality shows.Now that people can get the information they need for their forecast off the Web, and certainly on their mobile phone, that gives us more license to do more long-form on the cable channel, he said. The channel remained committed to live news during severe weather, he added.Mr. Kenny, a member of the board of directors of Yahoo, was the president of Akamai until he stepped down last October. He was previously the co-founder of VivaKi, a digital agency that is part of the Publicis Groupe.In a statement, the three co-owners of the Weather Channel said that Mr. Kennys experience gives him a deep understanding of the TV and digital business, and he has the leadership experience and vision to drive global initiatives across all platforms.Mr. Kelly, similarly, had a digital media background when he was hired two and a half years ago.Mr. Kenny said he was initially recruited to join the board of the company, and was later asked by the board to consider the chief executive position.What Ive long stood for is convergence, he said. I think youll see us find better ways to run the Weather Channel as one company, really organized around our hundreds of millions of users.NBCUniversal and the private equity firms have owned the Weather Channel since 2008.",2012-01-24T21:04:25+0000

Thats because the Shanty  for the moment, at least  is mostly about the gin. The bar is an annex of the New York Distilling Company, which has been producing two types of gin since November. Theyre not the only people to do the micro-distilling thing in the borough (theres also the Kings County Distillery and Breuckelen Distilling in Sunset Park), but theyre the first with their own bar. The Shanty is clearly more than a gin joint, and no one will push you to order the companys products. But after admiring their gorgeous German-made pot still through a window onto the distillery floor, its hard to choose something made elsewhere.

Although Radwanska took the first set, winning an error-filled tiebreaker 7-0 as Azarenka self-destructed, the rest of the match was a clinic in power tennis dominating a more conservative game plan. Azarenka began to take the ball early and move Radwanska mercilessly from side to side. The normally stingy Radwanska (she committed only 3 unforced errors in her fourth round win over Julia Gorges) began to crumble as Azarenkas heavy groundstrokes found their mark. Radwanska made 31 unforced errors in the match, and gradually wore down under Azarenkas constant pressure.",2012-01-25T00:48:47+0000

us,New Contract for Philharmonic,"The New York Philharmonics management and musicians have agreed on a new contract, the players union said late Saturday. Union officials said orchestra members had been prepared to strike, jeopardizing a European tour starting Monday, without an agreement this weekend. In a statement the musicians reported reaching a two-year deal  relatively short by industry standards  in which, they said, management had dropped proposals for drastic cuts to health insurance and a radical reduction in pension benefits. The Philharmonic confirmed in a statement on Sunday that the defined-benefit pension plan would remain, and that pension benefits would be capped at $70,000 a year per player. The orchestra also said that both sides agreed to hire a consultant to study the advisability of moving to a defined-contribution pension plan. Tino Gagliardi, president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, which represents Philharmonic players, said management backed down from eliminating defined-benefit pensions and replacing them with defined contributions. The Philadelphia Orchestra, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, recently made the change. In light of that, Mr. Gagliardi said, it was really, really important to take a stand. But the matter was essentially put off for two years. Mr. Gagliardi said the pension issue would be studied by both sides and revisited for the next contract. On health insurance, he said, the agreement gives small economic relief to the employer. The pact, he added, calls for no wage increase this year and a 2 percent raise next year.",2012-01-29T21:37:01+0000

The 1920s teams are not included because of severe differences in the game and the league. In this installment, we rank the running back tandems, whether they are rotations, committees, or old-fashioned three-back attacks. For the teams of yesteryear, tailbacks who acted as de facto quarterbacks are counted in the mix.6. 1934 Giants: Harry Newman had a short, modestly distinguished career as a 179-pound A-formation tailback (by todays standards, a Tebow). He led the league in nearly every passing category in 1933, but in 1934 he threw just one touchdown and 12 interceptions, statistics that were almost as bad then as they are today. Ken Strong was an All-Pro fullback/defensive back for both the Giants and the Staten Island Stapletons, then an N.F.L. team, and Strong rushed for 431 yards and 6 touchdowns. His best years were behind him by 1934, though he stayed with the Giants as a placekicker until after World War II. The third member of the backfield was Wee Willie Smith, who played just one season in the N.F.L. (He is not to be confused with the legendary basketball player of the same name.) You do not have to be an expert in 1930s football to realize that a backfield with one player who played just one season and another who played just three seasons belongs low on any all-time list.",2012-01-31T14:19:30+0000
