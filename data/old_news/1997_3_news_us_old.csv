In the early part of this century, Mrs. Gilligan operated a home ''for elderly people and chronic invalids,'' in the town of Windsor. She offered some enticements for living there: Most of her clients were elderly men and they could get lifetime care simply by signing over their life insurance policies to her or by giving her $1,000, a healthy amount of money at the time, when they checked in. In 1916, however, Mrs. Gilligan was arrested. State police, after an investigation, concluded that she had shortened the lives of up to two dozen or so men by poisoning them with arsenic. One of them was Michael W. Gilligan, her second husband. The union had lasted three months when Mr. Gilligan turned up dead. The arrest of Mrs. Gilligan and her trial in 1917, after many bodies had been exhumed, rocked the state; there were headlines that would do credit to today's tabloids: ''Police Believe Archer Home for Aged a Murder Factory,'' screamed The Hartford Courant's Page 1 on the morning of May 9, 1916, the day after Mrs. Gilligan was arrested.

A Brain Still Can't Be Cloned.,"EXPLORERS returning from distant lands tell of aborigines so afraid of cameras that they recoil from the sight of a lens as if they were looking down the barrel of a gun. Taking their picture, they fear, is the same as stealing their soul. You might as well just shoot them dead on the spot. Knowing that a photograph is only skin deep, people in the developed lands find such terror absurd.

Even the most diligent scholars let their hair down when they write about Dickinson, believing, as she did, that the best way to tell any truth is to ''tell it slant.'' (And one could argue that the circuitous route of fiction also happens to be the only way to tell the truth of this particular life, as Dickinson left very few traces of her life behind.) Few literary figures have occasioned such a range of creative response, the latest of which is the extraordinary epistolary novel ''I Never Came to You in White,'' by Judith Farr, which is set during the year that the 17-year-old Dickinson spent at boarding school in South Hadley, Mass.

Into the murky world of these two endangered species drops a metal canister whose contents could unleash ''the big one,'' the announcement Cuban Miami has been waiting for. So begins this wacky romp of a novel, originally serialized in The Miami Herald's Tropic magazine, with each of a baker's dozen of chapters contributed by one of South Florida's finest writers. Before they're done, the thermodynamic 13 (whose ranks include Elmore Leonard, Carl Hiaasen and Edna Buchanan) will have dropped into this imbroglio more than 20 delectable denizens of Dade County and a couple of cryonically preserved heads that look like Fidel Castro's. Aside from the speedboat ride of a plot -- ''a three-beer story,'' as one character puts it -- there's the pleasure of listening to these masters play with the language and conventions of the mystery genre, manipulating cliches (yes, there's a moon over Miami) and dopey lines, picking up threads previous chapter writers have left behind while deftly upping the ante. ''Naked Came the Manatee'' is a deliciously twisted paean to South Florida, to its color, corruption, cacophony and Cubano culture. Philip Gambone",1997-03-02T05:00:00+0000

Shunned by architectural critics for most of his shamelessly successful career, Mr. Lapidus, the designer of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach and other monuments to excess, is just coming into his own, at the age of 94. In his autobiography, TOO MUCH IS NEVER ENOUGH (Rizzoli, $45), Mr. Lapidus traces his populist style to his first vision of electric lights at Coney Island's Luna Park as a young Russian immigrant in the early 20th century. He developed a flamboyant visual lexicon, using ''woggles'' (free-form, amoebalike shapes), ''cheese holes'' (recessed circular lights in walls and ceilings), ''beanpoles'' (ornamental metal rods) and flying ''stairways to nowhere'' that were built mainly so that hotel guests could show off their evening clothes. Though steeped in classical architecture, he went on to create a delirious melange of French Provincial and Italian Renaissance styles -- with a splashy use of color (the Fontainebleau's interiors somehow combined 27 colors) and by lavishing ornament on top of ornament -- that critics derided as ''Miami Beach French.'' Today, Mr. Lapidus has been rediscovered by a generation of post-modernist architects, including Rem Koolhaas and Philippe Starck. For one who spent decades in critical exile, Mr. Lapidus maintains a remarkably unbitter tone. However, he claims too many innovations; certainly German Expressionist architects used indirectly lighted ceilings long before he did in 1929. The book would benefit from more color plates to deliver the full impact of Mr. Lapidus's exuberant vision. Eric Nash",1997-03-02T05:00:00+0000

Many of the best collections on display in the provincial museums were made by artists. As a cartoonist myself, I was delighted to find these were not just any artists, but good, solid second-rate artists with absolutely first-rate instincts -- men with tastes of a much higher order than their talents -- a condition with which I am proud to claim both personal familiarity and a fraternal sympathy.

''Yes,'' they say, ''I bet Alan Greenspan is right when he says stocks might be too high, but I just can't bring myself'' -- the tone turns plaintive, a bit anguished, here -- ''to leave this party yet.'' All manner of theories have popped up to explain this endless party: there's a new era, a new way of defining stock value. But Mr. Greenspan dismissed this crisply on Wednesday. ''History,'' he said, ''is strewn with visions of such new eras.'' He did jolt the market that day, with the Dow off 122 at one point, but it ended down just 55 -- barely a pinprick -- and kept slipping the rest of the week. So what does history teach? Well, in 1929 and 1965, Fed officials warned of overvalued stock prices, but the real market drops were seven or eight months off. Next month you'll get out. Really. BALANCED-BUDGET AMENDMENTWe Tried, We Really TriedMost Americans focus on any given political issue for about 12 seconds. A balanced-budget amendment? Hmm. Sounds good. Shouldn't spend what you don't have. Yup, I'm for it, say 75 to 80 percent of the populace, then switch back to the ball game. Most of them have little inkling of the tradeoffs involved, and in fact only 25 percent favor this elusive balance if it dents Social Security benefits. Sound-bite politics or no, though, legislators ignore the popular will at their peril. So at regular intervals they stage this ritual of almost lining up support and then -- whoops! -- not quite making it. When this little dance was performed last week, Robert G. Torricelli, New Jersey's new Democratic Senator, was the man of the hour, potentially the decisive 67th vote.

Sidney serves as Treasurer of the American Comittee and together with Betty is a Diamond Founder of the hospital. They have continued the family's involvement through the participation of their son David, who serves on the Metropolitan Cabinet, and who is a Founder of the Hospital along with his wife Renee. May the entire family have warm and loving memories of Simeon Guterman and may they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.

The faculty, staff, administration and students of Kingsborough Community College join all residents of the City and State of New York in mourning the untimely passing of the Honorable Stanley Fink, Esq., former State Assembly Speaker and City University of New York Trustee. Speaker Fink retired as New York State Assembly Speaker in 1986 after a distinguished record of service to the people of the Borough of Brooklyn, the City of New York and the State of New York. Stanley Fink, a longtime resident of Brooklyn, earned his baccalaureate degree from Brooklyn College in 1956 and his law degree from New York University Law School in 1959. After serving in the Judge Advocate General's Office of the United States Air Force, he returned to Brooklyn to practice law & began what would become a distinguished career in civic and public affairs. In 1968, he ran for the State Assembly & was elected to represent the Canarsie Assembly District. He became Assembly majority leader in 1977 and, in 1979, he was elected Speaker of the Assembly, a position in which he served with distinction until his retirement in 1986. In 1989 he was appointed to the Board of Trustees of The City University of New York by Governor Cuomo. As a trustee he continued his commitment to the students of the City of New York. He championed the cause of access to higher education for all New Yorkers and was a strong advocate of Kingsborough Community College's emergence as an educational force in the Brooklyn community. Speaker Fink's contributions to the College were recognized when he was awarded the Kingsborough President's Medal for his devotion to the cause of higher education, in general, and open admissions specifically. Known as a forceful leader capable of fostering bi-partisanship in the legislature, Stanley Fink leaves a record of legislative innovation in the areas of criminal justice reform, highway safety, school aid & primary, secondary, and higher education. Both as Speaker of the New York State Assembly and as a Trustee of the City University of New York, he was a strong voice for the educationally and economically disadvantaged, women returning to the workforce, and education for new immigrants. He took particular pride in the development of new programs at Kingsborough Community College to serve these populations. His commitment to access through open-enrollment became the public policy of New York State and, for this, he will be long remembered and held in the highest regard. Stanley Fink's contributions in government, in the business sector and in higher education are many. He will always be remembered, however, for his extraordinary intelligence, his great sense of humor and his innate ability to cut through rhetoric and get to the heart of the matter. His energy and magnetic personality merged to form a commanding presence wherever people gathered. Stanley Fink was a loving husband to his wife, Judith, a devoted father to his son, Marc and daughter-in-law, Laura Kirschstein, his son, Keith and daughter-in-law, Caryn, and an adoring grandfather to his granddaughter, Alexandra. His legacy of excellence as a public servant, his passion for justice, his devotion to his family and the joy he derived from their love, serve to help us remember Stanley Fink as a man who made a difference.

Mr. Banks-Pye is gone, but his book, ''Colefax and Fowler's Interior Inspirations'' (Bulfinch, $45), arrives in stores next week. Written with the help of Suzanne Woloszynska, it is a testament to sure-footed eccentricity and nose-thumbing style, qualities in short supply in the design world today. Famed for the over-the-top house he created for the fashion designer Valentino, he was also an egalitarian experimenter, ready to glue squares of blue rice paper onto a white wall (above), to ennoble a sheet of postage stamps with a gold frame (above right) or to glue chintz directly onto his bedroom floorboards (yes, they held up). ''Interior Inspirations'' is wickedly opinionated, too.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  LEYDET, FRANCOIS G.","LEYDET-Francois G. The death of Francois Leydet brings to end a life filled with joy, adventure, love and accomplishment. Born 26 August 1927 at Neuilly-sur-Seine (France), he became a U.S. citizen in 1956 after attending prep school and colleges in both France and the U.S.: bachelor's degree, University of Paris, 1945; bachelor's degree, Harvard University, 1947; Harvard Business School, 1948/9 and 1950/62; School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University, 1952/3. Fluent in English and French, Francois spoke several other languages and delighted in puns and other word play. In recent years he devoted much effort to institutions he believed in, serving as a docent at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, and as an active worker and supporter of Planned Parenthood. Among his many ''careers'' were experience in investment banking, wrangler on ranches in Oregon, crewing shrimpboats in the Gulf of California, and rowing dories through the Grand Canyon, but always there was writing. Starting as a copyboy for the Washington ''Evening Star'' in 1953, Francois worked at the San Francisco ''Chronicle'', 1954/62, and ''Examiner'', 1962/3, before turning to freelance writing, specializing in nature, wildlife and conservation subjects, for the remainder of his life. He edited and wrote books for the Sierra Club (''Tomorrow's Wilderness'', 1963, ''The Last Redwoods'', 1963, the award winning ''Time and the River Flowing''-about the Grand Canyon-1964), and a comprehensive book about the maligned and misunderstood coyote, ''The Coyote, Defiant Songdog of the West'', 1977; passengers on his river trips can remember Francois climbing on the ledges above the river and howling like a coyote and in later years at least one friend often referred to him as ''The Old Coyote''. Francois' essays and articles appeared in magazines and journals as diverse as ''National Geographic'', ''American West'', ''Holiday'', ''Harvard Magazine'' and ''Vogue''. Though never published, his sonnets, odes and other poetry were a delight shared with his friends and family. Francois died Tuesday, March 4, of complications following a diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer, in Tucson, Arizona, where he lived with his wife Roslyn since 1990. He leaves cherished dogs, Bruno, Max, Mortimer and Emma. Francois is survived by the people he loved, who adored him in return, his wife of 27 years, Roslyn (Tucson), his step-children: Walter Robb (San Francisco), Dr. Rachel Avery (Portland, ME), Holly Prunty (Palo Alto), Peckie Peters (Vail), and 9-3/4 grandchildren. His siblings are brother Hugues Leydet (Montreal, Canada) and sister Beatrice Mosca (Rome, Italy). A Memorial service will be held later in the spring after grandchild 10 is born. The family requests that memorial donations in lieu of flowers or other memorials be made to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum or Planned Parenthood.",1997-03-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Highly Animated,"From 1959 through 1964, citizens of the cartoon town of Frostbite Falls, Minn., were regularly rescued from a rash of fiendish plots and schemes by their stalwart neighbors, Bullwinkle, surely history's most obtuse talking moose, and Rocky, the world's pluckiest and most credulous flying squirrel. The pair, with their peculiar take on life and its discontents, stumbled through a series of animated adventures that somehow saved both Frostbite Falls and the rest of civilization from the sinister machinations of Fearless Leader, executed with diabolic aplomb and a Rube Goldberg-like attention to detail by Boris Badenov and his evil sidekick, Natasha Fatale. Squeaky-voiced Rocky and the intellectually challenged Bullwinkle performed their noble deeds every week with a savoir-faire grounded in pure hearts and absolute obliviousness, an unlikely combination that amazingly took them from triumph to triumph. Supporting our two heroes were other cartoons featuring such memorable characters as Mr. Peabody, a brilliant beagle with a pet boy, and the stoutly clueless Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties, all products of Jay Ward, a man with a Harvard M.B.A. and a truly weird sense of the world, and a group of writers, animators and voice actors who together produced five seasons of what might be called cartoon stand-up, in which dialogue and characterization counted for at least as much as action. In THE ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE BOOK (Bantam, $50), the entertainment journalist Louis Chunovic has gathered more information than may be strictly necessary about Mr. Ward and his band, filling the pages with press releases, illustrations, tidbits and oddities. Probably he would admit that watching Moose and Squirrel is more entertaining than reading about them, but -- Hokey Smoke -- for true believers, having a synopsis of all 326 episodes is an uncommon treat.

This spice -- actually the dried stigma of a type of crocus, with orange and red threads that look like pipe tobacco -- is wonderful when used sparingly, adding a subtle dimension to a dish. But saffron has a penetrating aroma that can be overwhelming if too much is used, which is why some people do not take to it. But used in the right quantities, it brings out the flavor of seafood, which makes it a natural in paella and risotto (when you add it to rice, its hue begins to darken and develop like a print in a photographer's lab). It also marries well with the acid flavor of tomatoes, making it a good foil for a fatty fish like salmon. In Spain it is often combined with ground almonds, garlic and parsley and added to stews. It goes very well with the rather bland flavors of veal or chicken.",1997-03-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Love at Last Sight,"In the window of the dining car of a train traveling from St. Petersburg to Paris, a middle-aged French film maker named Luca glimpses the reflection of a woman raising her hand to her neck, and his heart stops. Just so had his one-time Russian sweetheart, Anna, gestured in moments of weariness or sorrow. The woman on the train has the same build, the same dark hair, but is she Anna? This question haunts MY RUSSIAN LOVE (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $18.95), Dan Franck's affecting exploration of the lasting power of first -- and lost -- love. As the train rolls toward Paris and the woman leaves the dining car, Luca does not follow. Instead, he falls into a reverie, remembering his student days, the first time he saw the 18-year-old Anna in a Paris cafe, their first walk together, their first embrace, their first night of love. Anna's parents had been determined to get their only child out of the Soviet Union, to study and be free in the West. But when news arrives that calls her back to them, she goes at once, severing herself from Luca -- except for one brief encounter that yields the secret to the book's mystery. Mr. Franck, a French screenwriter who is the author of an earlier novel, ''Separation,'' has written a book as spare as a screenplay but fully novelistic in its language, imagery and psychological insight. In this agile translation by Jon Rothschild, it captures the emotional turmoil of young lovers, of their conviction that what they are experiencing is something that ''would never again exist with anyone else.''

His last finished play, ''Coyote Hangin on a Barbed Wire Fence,'' was also selected for the National Playwrights Conference in 1990. It was to premiere on Broadway at Circle in the Square in spring of '93 but Percy suffered a cardiac arrest Sept. 8, 1992, which left him unable to continue his life work. His acting career spanned thirty years. He played Verlaine in the North American premiere of ''Rimbaud'' and performed numerous other roles. He was an avid sports enthusiast and played rugby with the New York Rugby Club. He taught playwrighting at the 52nd St Project and worked in the St. Ignatius Soup Kitchen. From the time of his initial heart attack until his death, Percy often visited the Option Institute in Sheffield, MA who taught his family and volunteers to run a stimulation and education program designed for him. He is survived by his wife, MariElena Granger, and his sons, Andrew and James. A memorial service will be held at the St. Ignatius Episcopal Church, 552 West End Avenue at 1 PM on Thurs, March 13. In lieu of flowers the family requests that a donation be made in his name to the Option Institute and Fellowship, 2080 S. Undermountain Rd, Sheffield, MA 01257.",1997-03-12T05:00:00+0000

Work abroad was plentiful -- even rewarding -- but for this native New Yorker, the son of a Brooklyn cantor, staying away was painful. Recently, he and his ex-wife, the singer Judith Haddon, reached a final settlement. So, for the first time in seven years, Mr. Shicoff, who now lives in Zurich, has returned to New York. Tomorrow night, when the Met presents its new production of Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' the 47-year-old tenor will sing the role of Lenski, which he sang in the previous production with great success.

us,Beethoven With the Storms Understated,"Vladimir Ashkenazy's recital at Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday was decent, good-natured and even-tempered. In the first half, he offered two sonatas from Beethoven's Opus 31, the G major and the D minor, and seemed not concerned to point up any contrasts of spirit. His playing was fluent, except for one or two awkwardnesses in the fast runs of the G major's first movement, and modest. He didn't want to tell us anything about Beethoven we didn't already know, and the storms of the D minor sonata were notably underplayed. Rhythms were precise, at the risk of blandness. Dynamic extremes were modulated so as to do no serious harm. Phrasing was clear and articulate, but so as to convey the minimum of personality.",1997-03-12T05:00:00+0000

The 100,000member Transport Workers Union of America mourns the passing of our retired Secretary Treasurer on March 9, 1997 after a brief illness at Parkway Hospital, Forest Hills, Queens. He was 81. He had retired in February 1991 after a distinguished 48-year career as a member and officer of TWU's flagship Local 100 in New York City and the national TWU of America. In 1980, as Secretary Treasurer of the 35,000-member Local 100, Mr. Faulding played a key role in the 11-day New York City transit strike. Despite his retirement from TWU, Mr. Faulding remained 1st Vice President of the New York City Central Labor Council's Black Trade Union Leadership Committee; an officer of the Municipal Credit Union; a member of One Hundred Black Men, a life member of the NAACP, and was founder of the Senior Citizens Garden Club in Roy Wilkins Park, Queens. During his nearly five decades as a union officer for TWU, Mr. Faulding held almost every elected position in Local 100, except President, including 26 years of service as Shop Steward, Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Local's United Motormen's Division. Born in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, in 1916, he came to New York at the age of 11. He became involved in the union movement for transit workers when he became a Trolley Motorman. He joined Local 100, and soon after was selected Shop Steward and immediately became a solidifying force. Mr. Faulding joined the national union's staff in 1985 as Secretary Treasurer, a position he held until his retirement. He is a charter member and former President of the BMT Surface Operators Club which was founded in 1943 when minorities were first hired into New York Surface transportation.

For us, of the Cantors Assembly, he wil long be remembered as the driving force behind the organization of the Cantors Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1952. He quickly managed to bring to the faculty of the new school a wide array of important figures in the cantorate, in liturgical composition, and well-known instructors in the field of classical music. He vowed to devote the Institute's resources toward developing the great tradition of Jewish music and the training of Hazzanim who would some day serve the great American Jewish community's synagogues. As Chairman of the Faculty, his chief aim for the school would be to communicate through the medium of music, the spirit inherent in Judaism. He succeeded in both of his high goals beyond his own dreams. After four decades, his school and his curriculum produced over one hundred and seventy graduates, who day in and day out strive to carry out his plan for them. They, and we who helped establish the school, are a living memorial to his vision and talent. May his memory abide as a blessing for us all.

The 100,000member Transport Workers Union of America mourns the passing of our retired Secretary Treasurer on March 9, 1997 after a brief illness at Parkway Hospital, Forest Hills, Queens. He was 81. He had retired in February 1991 after a distinguished 48-year career as a member and officer of TWU's flagship Local 100 in New York City and the national TWU of America. In 1980, as Secretary Treasurer of the 35,000-member Local 100, Mr. Faulding played a key role in the 11-day New York City transit strike. Despite his retirement from TWU, Mr. Faulding remained 1st Vice President of the New York City Central Labor Council's Black Trade Union Leadership Committee; an officer of the Municipal Credit Union; a member of One Hundred Black Men, a life member of the NAACP, and was founder of the Senior Citizens Garden Club in Roy Wilkins Park, Queens. During his nearly five decades as a union officer for TWU, Mr. Faulding held almost every elected position in Local 100, except President, including 26 years of service as Shop Steward, Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Local's United Motormen's Division. Born in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, in 1916, he came to New York at the age of 11. He became involved in the union movement for transit workers when he became a Trolley Motorman. He joined Local 100, and soon after was selected Shop Steward and immediately became a solidifying force. Mr. Faulding joined the national union's staff in 1985 as Secretary Treasurer, a position he held until his retirement. He is a charter member and former President of the BMT Surface Operators Club which was founded in 1943 when minorities were first hired into New York Surface transportation.

At the time of his death, Charles H. Dyson was chairman emeritus of The Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corporation, a private company that he founded in 1954, which became one of the largest privately held companies in the country. Charles Dyson was born in NYC and grew up in Englewood, NJ. As a young man, Charles Dyson worked as an accountant, and attended Pace University (then Pace Institute) at night, graduating in 1930. During the war years, he was a Special Consultant to the Secretary of War and worked with the Army and Navy on helping to design the Lend Lease Act. He later worked for the Department of the Treasury and after helping to organize the International Monetary Fund, he represented Treasury Department at the First IMF conference at Bretton Woods. Commissioned as a colonel in the Air Force, he was decorated with a Distinguished Service Medal and was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his wartime service. After the war, Mr. Dyson worked for several national corporations before beginning his own company in 1954. That year he bought his first company with $10,000 of his own money and $5 million borrowed from a bank. Mr. Dyson became known as a pioneer in the field of leveraged buyouts. The Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corporation's manufacturing and industrial businesses currently generate annual sales of close to $600 million. In addition to Charles Dyson's many accomplishments in the business world, he was a noted philanthropist and community leader. He served as chairman of several boards of directors, including Pace Univeristy and the American Ballet Theater. The liberal arts school at Pace University is known as the Dyson College of Arts and Sciences, in recognition of Mr. Dyson's leadership and contributions to that institution. He lent his support and leadership to a long list of voluntary organizations and served as a trustee for many including Rockefeller University Council, Hospital for Special Surgery, White Plains Hospital, Common Cause, Center for Defense Information, Westchester County Medical Center, Greer Children's Services, New York Law School, and the Metropolitan Opera Association. Charles Dyson's commitment to philanthropy and the importance of the voluntary sector was lifelong. In addition to his personal philanthropy and that of his whole family, he and his late wife Margaret founded The Dyson Foundation in 1957. He later created The Dyson Charitable Fund as another adjunct to his family's charitable work. In recent years, major gifts were made by Mr. Dyson, and by the Dyson Foundation to many important institutions, including Pace University, Cornell University, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical College, Marist College, the American Ballet Theater, and the Metropolitan Opera. Charles H. Dyson was the widower of Margaret Macgregor Dyson to whom he was married in 1941. Margaret Dyson passed away in 1990. Survivors include his second wife, June Marston Dyson; his three sons and one daughter; John S. Dyson, Robert R. Dyson, Anne E. Dyson, M.D., and Peter L. Dyson; 10 grandchildren; and a sister, Laura Bucciarelli. Private services and burial will be held in Millbrook, NY. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be made to Pace University in New York City or to Grace Episcopal Church in Millbrook, NY.

Though both Mr. Zarzyski and Ms. Van Cleve are from Montana, their very different styles work to capture a chorus of contradictory moods: her luminous black-and-white images seem etched from some archetypal landscape, while his verses bristle with audacity and whimsy. Mr. Zarzyski alternates between bluster and lyricism. For the former, he uses lopingly metered stanzas and punch-drunk, self-mythologizing bravura, which heightens both the flair and the corniness of rodeo lingo. (''Running on Bute, LeDoux songs and caffeine / You rollicking, rosined-up, spurring machine.'') But he proves equally adept at meditative free verse, as in the title poem, in which he compares a cowboy killed by a throw from a bronc to ''a bride's bouquet / pitched blind.'' Ms. Van Cleve's facing photo reveals the impossibly calm center within such a moment, as the leaping horse hovers delicately above the ground and the rider, despite his flailing body, leans back with a peaceful expression. Together, these artists offer a rare slice of what Mr. Zarzyski calls the ''real West, the sunset into which -- / imagine why, if you will -- the cowboy rides off.''

us,La Vie Boheme,"Alice Prin, known as Kiki, was the embodiment of bohemian Paris in the 1920's. Audacious and high spirited, she was an artist's model as well as the star attraction in cabarets, where she sang bawdy songs, lifting her skirts to reveal she wore no underwear. Man Ray was her lover, Jean Cocteau, Chaim Soutine and Tsuguharu Foujita her treasured friends. She was featured in Fernand Leger's famous film ''Ballet Mecanique'' and was the subject of Man Ray's greatest Surrealist photographs of the 20's. An illegitimate child, Kiki was born in Burgundy in 1901. She lived with her indigent grandmother until the age of 12, when she was summoned to Paris by her mother. Drawn to the artist's life in Montparnasse, she survived by her wits, charming all who crossed her path. When her memoirs were first published in 1929, they were an instant sensation. Parisians queued up to obtain an autographed copy -- and a kiss. But the publisher, Edward W. Titus, who commissioned the American journalist Samuel Putnam to translate and Ernest Hemingway to write an introduction, was less successful in getting Kiki's memoirs into the United States; they never got past Customs. Even as late as the 1970's, the memoirs -- short, fancifu1 vignettes about Kiki's sexually adventurous existence in Paris -- were still held in the section for banned books in the New York Public Library. Billy Kluver and Julie Martin, the editors of a lively new edition, KIKI'S MEMOIRS (Ecco, $23), have included fresh biographical material, familiar as well as lesser-known photographs of Kiki by Man Ray, portraits by other artists and reproductions of Kiki's own paintings. Though hardly the stuff of scandal today, ''Kiki's Memoirs'' is nonetheless suffused with a wayward charm as insouciant as Kiki herself. Andrea Barnet",1997-03-16T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  DYSON, CHARLES H.","DYSON-Charles H. Financier and philanthropist, died March 14, 1997, at the age of 87. Mr. Dyson lived in Millbrook, NY, and Barbados. At the time of his death, Charles H. Dyson was chairman emeritus of The Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corporation, a private company that he founded in 1954, which became one of the largest privately held companies in the country. Charles Dyson was born in NYC and grew up in Englewood, NJ. As a young man, Charles Dyson worked as an accountant, and attended Pace University (then Pace Institute) at night, graduating in 1930. During the war years, he was a Special Consultant to the Secretary of War and worked with the Army and Navy on helping to design the Lend Lease Act. He later worked for the Department of the Treasury and after helping to organize the International Monetary Fund, he represented Treasury Department at the First IMF conference at Bretton Woods. Commissioned as a colonel in the Air Force, he was decorated with a Distinguished Service Medal and was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his wartime service. After the war, Mr. Dyson worked for several national corporations before beginning his own company in 1954. That year he bought his first company with $10,000 of his own money and $5 million borrowed from a bank. Mr. Dyson became known as a pioneer in the field of leveraged buyouts. The Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corporation's manufacturing and industrial businesses currently generate annual sales of close to $600 million. In addition to Charles Dyson's many accomplishments in the business world, he was a noted philanthropist and community leader. He served as chairman of several boards of directors, including Pace Univeristy and the American Ballet Theater. The liberal arts school at Pace University is known as the Dyson College of Arts and Sciences, in recognition of Mr. Dyson's leadership and contributions to that institution. He lent his support and leadership to a long list of voluntary organizations and served as a trustee for many including Rockefeller University Council, Hospital for Special Surgery, White Plains Hospital, Common Cause, Center for Defense Information, Westchester County Medical Center, Greer Children's Services, New York Law School, and the Metropolitan Opera Association. Charles Dyson's commitment to philanthropy and the importance of the voluntary sector was lifelong. In addition to his personal philanthropy and that of his whole family, he and his late wife Margaret founded The Dyson Foundation in 1957. He later created The Dyson Charitable Fund as another adjunct to his family's charitable work. In recent years, major gifts were made by Mr. Dyson, and by the Dyson Foundation to many important institutions, including Pace University, Cornell University, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical College, Marist College, the American Ballet Theater, and the Metropolitan Opera. Charles H. Dyson was the widower of Margaret Macgregor Dyson to whom he was married in 1941. Margaret Dyson passed away in 1990. Survivors include his second wife, June Marston Dyson; his three sons and one daughter; John S. Dyson, Robert R. Dyson, Anne E. Dyson, M.D., and Peter L. Dyson; 10 grandchildren; and a sister, Laura Bucciarelli. Private services and burial will be held in Millbrook, NY. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be made to Pace University in New York City or to Grace Episcopal Church in Millbrook, NY. A memorial service has been scheduled for April 1, 1997, at 11 AM, at St. James Episcopal Church, 865 Madison Avenue, NY NY.",1997-03-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  DYSON, CHARLES H.","DYSON-Charles H. It was a Spring morning, a quarter-century ago, when word first traveled down to the Village Green in Millbrook that a handful of young teenagers had moved into the little white house on the hill, formerly The Millbrook Manor. The word was ''Daytop'' and the currency was ''drug abuse''. The Town was still recoiling from the blemish of Timothy Leary's sojourn there and his gospel of 'dropping out' and hopelessness. Charles Dyson was the very first to arrive at our door, greeted by the radiant, hope-filled faces of young Daytoppers, bent on recovery of their lives. He found it difficult to tear himself away that morning and down through these years remained ''our Kids' best Friend'' and Neighbor. Each Christmas Eve, our love unfolded all over again as our Daytop Christmas Choristers made their way to his door. Oftentimes, I mused that he surely meditated upon O. Henry's somber reflection: ''No calamity so touches the common heart of humanity as does the straying of a little child. Their feet are so uncertain and feeble; their paths so steep and strange.'' His incredible capacity for caring has left with us indelible footprints of a life well-lived. May he be welcomed home by his beloved 'Lord of the Little Ones.' Our prayerful support for the Dyson Family. (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien President Daytop Village, Inc.",1997-03-18T05:00:00+0000

us,The Perversity of Everyday Life,"Ines Arredondo's collection of short fiction, UNDERGROUND RIVER AND OTHER STORIES (University of Nebraska, cloth, $30; paper, $12), is nothing short of spellbinding. Mostly set in a small town in northwestern Mexico at the beginning of this century, it provides a stunning expression of the erotic perversity found in seemingly ordinary lives: in each story, hovering just below the placid surface of daily existence, lurks a tragicomic opera of battling desires. Arredondo (1928-89) uses sharp prose to create a paradoxically dreamlike reality; the details in her work are so vividly rendered that they make scandal, madness and horror seem fascinating. In ''The Shunammite,'' a young woman reluctantly agrees to her uncle's deathbed wish that they marry, only to find that her transgression is his cure. In ''Mariana,'' a young couple's erotic obsession leads one to insanity, the other to death, while their neighbors avidly track their downfall. The narrator of ''The Nocturnal Butterflies,'' who works as a butler, describes how his relationship with his employer is forever altered when he procures for him the sexual services of an unusual adolescent girl. And the narrator of ''Shadow in the Shadows'' tells of her passion for a handsome young man, a passion so strong that she is willing to share her lover with her aging husband. Arredondo, although she published only three small volumes of stories during her lifetime, is one of modern Mexico's most highly regarded writers. Cynthia Steele's able translation, the first appearance of Arredondo's work in English, should secure a new audience for her powerful and distinctive voice. Jenny McPhee",1997-03-23T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Sam Golden, 82, of Columbus, NY died unexpectedly at Wellington Community Regional Hospital, Wellington, FL on Tuesday, March 11, 1997.

Sam Golden, the founder of Golden Artist Colors, an internationally recognized manufacturer of artists colors in Columbus, NY, started his paint making career in New York City in 1936. Sam, a partner in Bocour Artist Colors, Inc., with his Uncle Leonard Bocour, until his first retirement in 1972, was called a ''20th Century alchemist'' for his breakthrough work in modern synthetic paints for artist's use. Sam collaborated with many well known artists, providing custom materials for their individual use. Sam's innovative work has been credited as having a profound influence on the direction of modern art and its use of acrylic paint. After a long career as paintmaker, inventor, chemist, and a brief try at the retired life, Sam, at the age of 67 with wife Adele, son Mark and his wife Barbara and Chuck Kelly, formed Golden Artist Colors. This new company was created to perpetuate Sam's lifelong dedication to serving the professional artist. Sam had, in recent years, begun painting and had exhibited his work at both the Chenango County Council of the Arts and the Earlville Opera House Gallery. In 1996, Sam was honored by receiving the first Entrepreneur of the Year Award given by the Chenango County Chamber of Commerce. A family graveside service was held at the Beth David Cemetery in Elmont, Long Island on March 14. A memorial service for friends of Sam will be held at a later date.

And because the light-bulb joke involves a piece of electrical equipment, it mirrors our ambivalent attitudes toward technology, which, ever since Thomas Edison invented the incandescent bulb in 1879, has become so complex that we can no longer install and repair our appliances without enlisting the services of price-gouging experts.

The entire membership of the Cantors Assembly mourns the loss of its beloved Executive Vice President of more than four decades and the Cantor Emeritus of Temple Beth El of Rochester, New York. Since 1959, he served as the Executive Vice President of the Cantors Assembly, the largest organization of cantors in the world. He labored untiringly and was successful in elevating the status and role of the Cantor in Jewish worship. He was deeply involved in winning four landmark court cases to gain recognition for the Cantor as a Clergyperson. As past President, officer, and member of the Cantors Assembly since its inception, he is responsible for much of the organization's innovative programs and growth. An author, poet, and visionary, Hazzan Rosenbaum was particularly well known for his moving texts to more than a dozen major musical works presented on radio and television. His translations of Yiddish poetry and folk songs earned high praise. He authored four text books that are in wide use in Jewish religious schools across the country. He lectured extensively on Jewish music, culture and folklore. His works include ''Yizkor: In Memory of the Six Million'', an oratorio presented on ABC Television with Richard Tucker and Howard da Silva that received an Emmy nomination in 1973; ''The Last Judgement'', an oratorio with music by Lazar Weiner, presented on CBS Television; ''Stars in the Dust'', a commemorative composition of the 50th anniversary of Krystal Nacht; and ''Ever Since Babylon'', marking the 500th anniversary of Columbus' first voyage to America and the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. Numerous solo and choral works and four Holiday recordings, narrated and written by Hazzan Rosenbaum, comprise another segment of his creativity. He was managing Editor of the Assembly's ''Journal of Synagogue Music'', consultant to the ''Prayer Book Press'' and author of ''A Yiddish Word Book for English Speaking People''. He was a graduate of New York University and of the Herzliah Hebrew Teachers College. He studied music and voice privately and prepared for the Cantorate under Cantor Jacob Beimel and Cantor Adolph Katchko. Cantor Rosenbaum was granted a Doctor of Music Degree, honoris causa, by the Jewish Theological Seminary in May 1985 and received three Cantors Assembly Kavod Awards for originality and variety in Jewish music programming. At the time of his demise, he was writing a major commentary to the High Holiday Prayer Book entitled ''Machzor 101''. We lift our ''Kos Tanchumim-Cup of Consolation'' to his beloved wife, Ina, and to his children Judy (and Thomas) Witt, Michael Rosenbaum , and David Rosenbaum, and to his grandchildren Abigail, Daniel and Adam.

us,Love Among the Loons,"Ursula, the mysterious heroine of Frederic Tuten's soulful fictional homage to Vincent van Gogh, is a 19-year-old morphine-addicted photographer. In VAN GOGH'S BAD CAFE (Morrow, $20), she first glimpses the artist while taking a cure at a mental hospital in St. Remy, ''where educated and artistic loons mixed with loons of ordinary plumage.'' She's also ''a waif of time'' who leaves van Gogh after they become lovers, stepping through a crack in the wall of a cafe into the streets of Manhattan a hundred years later. Mr. Tuten (the author of three previous novels, most recently ''Tintin in the New World'') skillfully spins out parallel fantasies of van Gogh's final days, leading up to his suicide, and Ursula's adventures in today's East Village, which begin when she is taken in by the novel's narrator, a struggling photographer whom she approaches in search of a fix. Ursula's musings about modern life and her inevitable journey into punkdom and heroin addiction tend to be less absorbing than van Gogh's anguished inner flights between heaven and hell, which Mr. Tuten depicts in flamboyant and striking style. But ''Van Gogh's Bad Cafe'' is charged throughout with strange, sad magic, and even in its most rapturous moments manages to avoid cliches about artistic isolation and suffering. The watercolors and drawings by Eric Fischl that begin each chapter heighten the dreaminess of this jazzy meditation on the difficult commerce between art and life.

''To some extent you need time to pass to say, 'Does this stand up -- as a really bad thing?' '' Ms. Petras said recently. ''It's like art. Or wine. Or cheese.'' James McIntyre, a 19th-century Canadian poet who easily made the cut, certainly knew cheese. He produced dozens of dairy-themed poems, including ''Prophecy of a Ten Ton Cheese'' and ''Ode on the Mammoth Cheese.'' His obsession seems tame, however, in the context of this volume, which also contains paeans to earwigs and dentistry. And even the mighty can be very bad, as in the worst of Wordsworth, excerpted below.",1997-03-30T05:00:00+0000

From the Arch of Augustus guarding the Pennine Alps at Aosta and the Segovia aqueduct in Spain to the Library of Celsus at Ephesus in Asia Minor, the legacy of Roman splendor is still visible in the Mediterranean world, as ready to awe and intimidate us today as it did the populace of some recently subjugated province in the second century A.D. The photographs in ANCIENT ROME: History of a Civilization That Ruled the World (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, $60) re-create a sense of the sights and vistas of the capital and its principal outposts, screening out most evidence of 20th-century life. Scenes from everyday life and fashion are captured with unexpected realism and detail on columns and mosaics and in a back view of a hairdo on a sculpture, while the faces of Caesar, the young Octavian, Nero and Caracalla glare up from the page with startling clarity, as weathered and lifelike as the monuments they accompany. ''Ancient Rome,'' with text and captions by the Italian scholars Fabio Bourbon and Anna Maria Liberati, is a book of small marvels and Ozymandian ironies, its lessons commemorated in the stillness of Petra, in the untarnished perfection of a gold-leaf necklace retrieved from Pompeii (''a town that never knew the fate of neglect and decadence suffered by others''), and in a wicked, elegant brazier found in Herculaneum, the three ithyphallic satyrs that form its legs looking as if they're performing ''Stop!

In a distinctive collaboration, next Saturday at 8 P.M. at the Paramount Center for the Arts in Peekskill, actors from Shakespeare and Company will stage Pushkin's ''Mozart and Salieri'' while Philharmonia Virtuosi provides a backdrop by playing of both composers. What should be a special evening will be topped off by a performance of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 17 with Andrew Armstrong as soloist.

Still, amid all the attacks, one important dimension of gangsta rap has been overlooked, perhaps because it is hidden in plain sight.

This was a curious explanation since she is incontinent, cannot walk without assistance and is very confused most of the time. Having heard of Gurwin's outstanding reputation, I called them repeatedly, only to be told that my mother ''fell between the cracks.''

It is time to put some myths about White Plains schools to rest. Our salary scales are not the highest in the area by far, and in our current contract, newly hired teachers are being paid $1,500 less than they otherwise would have been entitled to for their first year. Our current teacher contract gave a salary increase of 1 percent in the first year and 11 percent over four years, not 14.75 percent. Our average teacher salary is dropping due to the retirements of longtime experienced staff members and their replacements by new teachers at lower salaries. In the 25 years that I have lived here, our school taxes have increased over 10 percent twice (1991 and 1993).
