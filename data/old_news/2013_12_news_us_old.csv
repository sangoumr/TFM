I chopped the scallops and added them to the batter, along with a bit of onion, some parsley, salt and chopped fresh chile, shallow-frying all this by the spoonful in abundant oil. Predictably, the little guys  eight in total  took a couple of minutes per side to become gorgeously golden. I sprinkled them with salt, squeezed a few drops of lemon over each and ate the entire batch by myself, in about the same amount of time they took to cook.",2013-12-04T22:44:23+0000

He has exhibited a house here and there, in Paris and Turin, but he has never before had his workers pack a whole Prouv house into 10 crates and ship it to America. The 8X8 house (8 meters by 8 meters, or about 26 feet by 26 feet) is one of two 1945 Prouv houses Mr. Seguin found in Bezaumont, France. (The other is a historical monument.) Made in a factory and easily assembled and taken apart, they were an elegant, thrifty solution to the postwar housing crisis in France. The 8X8 house is on display at Design Miami in Miami Beach through Sunday, furnished with pieces by Prouv and Pierre Jeanneret. In Miami, it would make a high-status pool house. No need to be a billionaire to go for one of these houses, he said, but the price is $2.5 million. Information: patrickseguin.com.",2013-12-04T23:28:13+0000

Halo-Halo, her black-and-white take on Pop Art and graffiti, which she describes as perhaps pictograms by some distant civilization or a board game from an imaginary place, is available in nine motifs that can be used in a multitude of configurations. Bisazza also introduced its first ceramic tiles, designed by Antonio Citterio, collaborating with Patricia Viel, and Marcel Wanders.

I thought the combination of colors would complement a variety of dishes, with a modern unexpected punch. That pattern, called Daphne, is usually hand-woven in silk Ikat. Ms. Weinrib used hand-printed cotton instead, which made possible the intricate design, as well as machine washing.

A century after the publication of his polemical essay Ornament and Crime, a Columbia University exhibition called Adolf Loos: Our Contemporary examines his enduring relevance. Loos provoked a furor in 1910 with the severe facade of a mens tailoring shop and apartment block facing the imperial palace in Vienna. It became known as the house without eyebrows for its lack of decoration, and Emperor Franz Josef was said to have drawn his carriage curtains when he rode past. By contrast, Le Corbusier acknowledged the Modern movements debt to Loos, saying he scrubbed under our feet; it was a Homeric cleansing  precise, philosophical and logical. Yehuda E. Safran, who organized the show, had more to say about him. (This interview has been condensed and edited.)",2013-12-04T23:47:45+0000

As Ephron herself figured out long ago, the idea of Dorothy Parker was far superior to the living version, who was good with a one-liner but not much fun to be around. The real Nora Ephron was the person everybody wanted to hang out with, in part because she was funny and charming but more critically because she made the people she was with feel funny and charming. (I certainly wanted to hang around her, and we were friends for years.) She was never the life of the party in the classic center-of-the-crowd sense.

For this fifth anniversary collection, which hits stores in May 2014, the newly engaged designer is looking back to move forward. In the past couple of years we were really developing the brand around this kind of woman, says Altuzarra about his imaginary muse, who balances French sensuality with effortless American style. I think it is a powerful thing to look at a show and have it superdesirable and have it superwearable. To achieve that balance this time around, his nearly 80 designs are fraught with layers of contrast. Body-hugging sheath dresses are understatedly sexy thanks to preppy madras fabric. Innocent, collegiate-striped skirts have dangerously high slits, an Altuzarra signature. The resurfacing of his other popular standbys  cropped peacoats, oxford shirt dresses, simple knits and soft, draped cocktail dresses  round out the collection so that it essentially becomes a complete wardrobe for the Altuzarra woman.

(Sundance) VANILLA SKY (2001) David Aames (Tom Cruise), a 33-year-old master of the universe, finds his life upended after a car crash in Cameron Crowes erotic science-fiction adaptation of Abre los Ojos, Alejandro Amenbars Spanish romantic thriller. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, the latest plaything in Davids endless succession of beautiful women. Penlope Cruz (above, with Mr. Cruise), who starred in Mr. Amenbars original, is Sofia Serrano, whom Julie discovers David flirting with at the birthday party he neglected to invite her to. And suddenly the simple offer of a ride the next morning becomes a suicide leap as Julie drives her car off a bridge, leaving her dead and David condemned to wearing a latex mask. With its roller-coaster plot and surreal special effects, Vanilla Sky is not the kind of film one associates with Mr. Crowe, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. The most warmhearted of mainstream Hollywood directors, Mr. Crowe has in the past extended to his characters the affection of an unusually careful and sympathetic listener. In this film, that ear is not as sharp, he continued. Still, the movie carries a lingering tug of sweetness, most apparent in the films heady soundtrack, which evokes the dream of eternal youth that infuses Vanilla Sky.",2013-12-06T06:00:05+0000

This principle could be applied to writing about all the arts, or most of them  including jazz, as the cultural critic and novelist Stanley Crouch has demonstrated with his judicious, strategically crafted new book about Charlie Parker, the revered and immeasurably influential alto saxophonist and composer. Kansas City Lightning: The Rise and Times of Charlie Parker is, like the music made by its subject in his abbreviated life, free-flowing and severe, volatile, expansive, allusive and indulgent.

What else could have prompted so many decorators to publish their portfolios, visual memoirs that attest to lives rich with clients? Decorating is one of the most evanescent of the visual arts. Its painful to walk into a room in which every inch has been lavished with attention, imagination and money, only to learn that the wrecking ball is about to arrive, commissioned by the next decorator.

And yet major surprises continue to arrive, dispatches from the past. Consider, for example, the work of the Chilean photographer Sergio Larrain (1931-2012), whose career was both extraordinary and unusually abbreviated. It was only after studying forestry at Berkeley that he began seriously taking pictures in the mid-1950s, and then an encounter with the Bolivian mystic Oscar Ichazo in 1968 caused him to retreat for the remainder of his life into meditation and yoga, taking small, quiet photos only occasionally, as complements to his inner quest. But for the decade or so that he was in the world and regularly taking pictures, his work, as amply illustrated in SERGIO LARRAIN (Aperture, $85), edited by Agns Sire, was a constant source of wonder.",2013-12-06T16:04:17+0000

Theres also, finally, enough leisure time to study other peoples gardens and pick up a few pointers. And yet, infuriatingly, many of those gardens are also in sleep mode. What to do?

So he built a special M.R.I. machine, and trained dogs to lie still inside it, allowing him to study their brains. Though the results may seem obvious to dog lovers (that humans and dogs experience emotions similarly), theyre not a given for science.

Hustons mother, Ricki Soma, a ballerina and the daughter of an Italian-restaurant owner in New York, was John Hustons fourth wife. They eloped when she was 18 and he was in his mid-40s. Huston was their second child and  with her mother now transformed into the beautiful couture-clad translucent and remote mistress of a vast West Ireland estate  she was raised amid multiple servants, visiting film-world eminences and colorful locals in the kind of world that has disappeared, other than, say, in movies starring Keira Knightley.

Thats all changed, largely because of the Internet, where high-resolution photographs of individual vases  on academic and curatorial websites with expert analysis, certainly, but also on the Flickr accounts of museumgoing tourists  let you zoom in on the tiny details in which much of the delight of Greek vase painting lies.

In our cover story, Suzy Menkes celebrates the enigmatic designer Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garons, who is bringing the beautiful chaos of Dover Street Market, her multibrand fashion bazaar, to New Yorks Kips Bay neighborhood. Elsewhere, we visit four prominent artists  Jeff Koons, KAWS, Ugo Rondidone and Chuck Close  to find out what sorts of work they themselves collect, and what their collections say about them. At the Park Avenue apartment of Renee and Mark Rockefeller, we find that the color beige doesnt have to be tepid and uninspired; deployed with a discerning eye, it can be smart and seductive. We capture the zany wit of Kristen Wiig, who appears in the forthcoming film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, by asking her to fill in the blanks in a Mad Lib that (sort of) describes her career trajectory to date. We visit the Moroccan city of Tangier, which, as home to expats like Pierre Berg, Bernard-Henry Lvy and Roger Vivier, remains one of the worlds great melting pots for creative types. We meditate on the magic touch of the hotelier Andr Balazs. We pay tribute to the enduring glamour of well-preserved old restaurants, from Pariss La Grenouille to New York Citys 21 Club, that feel trapped in amber. And finally, in the spirit of the season, we offer the very best gifts you can give, from food to fragrances to jewelry to adventures of a lifetime.

us,Whats On Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) STOKER (2013) In his English-language debut, the South Korean director Park Chan-wook (Oldboy, Lady Vengeance) tells the story of India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska), a solitary Connecticut teenager embroiled in a landscape of family secrets, sexual subtext and aristocratic entitlement after her father (Dermot Mulroney) dies in a car accident on her 18th birthday. Then her handsome Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), whom she never knew, comes to visit her mother (Nicole Kidman, above left, with Ms. Wasikowska), who seems insufficiently grief-stricken to her daughter. Thats when the familys housekeeper (Phyllis Somerville) disappears, and a worried relative (Jacki Weaver) alludes to further danger ahead. A great deal of information has been withheld, perhaps from India and certainly from us, and Mr. Park, with sadistic relish, takes his time with revelations that are both ghastly and a bit disappointing, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The exquisite sense of mystery that has built up around India begins to dissipate as the focus shifts to Charlie, and tantalizing ambiguities are resolved into a tale of madness and murder. Which, he added, is not so bad, though the final act of Stoker walks a fine line between the sensational and the silly. Learning the truth about Charlie, Mr. Scott said, does not so much explain what had come before as turn everything upside down, scattering the puzzle pieces in a colorful, brutal cascade. The actor Wentworth Miller (Prison Break) wrote the screenplay.",2013-12-07T06:00:05+0000

(A&E, History, Lifetime) BONNIE & CLYDE Bruce Beresford puts his spin on the doomed love affair of the 1930s gangsters Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow in this two-night mini-series starring Holliday Grainger and Emile Hirsch. William Hurt portrays Frank Hamer, the retired Texas Ranger who led the team that killed Parker and Barrow in 1934. Holly Hunter (above left, with Ms. Grainger) plays Parkers mother. Mr. Beresford (Tender Mercies, Driving Miss Daisy) gives the sentimental material a corresponding autumnal glow, and there are sweeping, lovely images of Texas fields under big skies, a shimmering crescent moon and an oil refinery sparkling in the night, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. Comparing Mr. Beresfords work to Arthur Penns 1967 film with Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, Mr. Hale adds: In the end, Bonnie & Clyde has the one thing in common with Bonnie and Clyde that youd expect: the fusillade of machine-gun fire, and Barrow and Parkers bodies twitching and bursting as theyre torn apart. While it doesnt have the force of Penns brutal choreography, its a surprisingly graphic scene for basic cable. Less surprising is a gratuitous, last-minute plot twist that serves to cement the films portrayal of Barrow as a tragic, star-crossed hero. Apparently, only the misunderstood die young.

The genius of this production, which includes eye-dazzling physical feats performed on giant hula hoops and from silken swings, is its transformation of traditional ballet into louche vaudeville: the famous Spanish dance becomes a foot-stomping, castanet-clicking striptease; in the storied Kingdom of the Sweets, Clara wields a fat black whip to play gleeful dominatrix over a troupe of bare-bottomed, harnessed Licorice Boys.",2013-12-09T19:00:10+0000

us,Artists on Artists | Art Spiegelman on the Varied Craft of Ad Reinhardt,"Its been a banner year for the cartoonist Art Spiegelman, regarded by many as the father of the contemporary graphic novel. Long revered for Maus, his Pulitzer Prize-winning concentration camp epic (published in two parts in 1986 and 1991), the artists work is broader than many realize, as his retrospective at the Jewish Museum in New York (through March 23, 2014) reveals. The show, which has already appeared in Europe and Canada, includes Spiegelmans early Wacky Pack and Garbage Pail Kids sketches, and closes with more recent projects, like a performance he choreographed and designed with the dance troupe Pilobolus and a colored-glass window representing an art students life that he made for his alma mater, the High School of Art & Design in New York. In October, Spiegelman published his monograph, Co-Mix (Drawn & Quarterly), and premiered his hybrid slide-show-talk-concert Wordless!, which focuses on the woodcut novels of early-20th-century artists like Lynd Ward, at the Sydney Opera House.

At this years Art Basel in Miami Beach, Scott Campbell (OHWOW Gallery) showed sculptures built with greenbacks and Hugh Scott-Douglas (Blum & Poe) manipulated foreign currency in a set of his signature magnified scans.

But in addition to the large-scale showstoppers, there were numerous more intimate works of interest. Many dealers showed jewelry or decorative objects alongside furniture. Several galleries created complete residential settings in which they installed their pieces. Demish Danant, for example, felt like a Parisian apartment from the 1970s with its boiserie and wall-to-wall carpeting. And while a few galleries did show new work, objects from the 40s to the 70s were predominant, adding to the fairs throwback feel.

Early in his career, Russell developed a reputation as a brilliant but difficult director; George Clooney said the two actually came to blows on the set of Russells third film, Three Kings, and later a YouTube video circulated of Lily Tomlin and Russell in a full-throated, expletive-laced shouting match on the set of his fourth film, I Heart Huckabees. Whether the characterization was fair, Russell has since undergone a personal, artistic and, ultimately, professional transformation.

(Starz) TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) In Woody Allens tribute to the Italian cinema of the 1950s and 60s, a retired and overly psychoanalyzed music promoter (Mr. Allen) travels with his wife (Judy Davis) to Rome, where their daughter (Alison Pill) has lost her heart to a lawyer devoted to left-wing causes (Flavio Parenti). Meanwhile, in this shuffled anthology, a young newlywed loses her way to the Trevi Fountain and falls into the arms of a movie star while her befuddled husband tries to keep his relatives in the dark, substituting a prostitute (Penlope Cruz) for her at dinner. An ordinary Roman (Roberto Benigni) is plunged into a swirl of media celebrity. And a fledgling architect (Jesse Eisenberg) finds his relationship with his kind, if bland, girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) in shreds when her neurotic actress friend visits. Alec Baldwin plays the older architect  a ghost? a specter of the younger mans self?  who witnesses the ordeal. One of the most delightful things about To Rome With Love is how casually it blends the plausible and the surreal, and how unabashedly it revels in pure silliness, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The movies limitations, as frothy as the milk atop a cappuccino, are finally inseparable from its delights.

The superintendent, Michael McVey, 50, who is free on a personal recognizance bond, has been accused of evidence tampering, obstruction of justice and two other charges. After the hearing, his lawyer said he was confident the charges would prove unfounded, according to The Associated Press. The rape case drew national attention and led to the conviction in March of two Steubenville High School football players. Afterward, the Ohio attorney general, Mike DeWine, convened a special grand jury to examine whether officials covered up the crime, and the panel returned indictments against six people. But only some of those charges stem from the first rape case, while others relate to separate accusations investigated by the grand jury, including some stemming from allegations of the sexual assault of a 14-year-old student four months earlier, as well as other charges of theft and stolen property.

They said the measures undermined the interim deal reached last month, when Iran was given sanctions relief in exchange for suspending some parts of its nuclear program for six months. This two-sided game and confusion we are witnessing is not beneficial for the atmosphere of the talks, Irans top negotiator and deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told the semiofficial Tasnim news agency on Friday. A spokesman for Catherine Ashton, the European Unions foreign policy chief and the coordinator of the negotiations with Iran, said the discussions were expected to resume in the near future. But in Tehran on Friday, some politicians called for the acceleration of Irans nuclear program. ",2013-12-14T05:10:55+0000

(HBO) JACK THE GIANT SLAYER (2013) In Bryan Singers retooling of the Jack and the Beanstalk tale, a chivalrous farmhand (Nicholas Hoult) fights for a kingdom and the love of an abducted princess (Eleanor Tomlinson), reigniting an ancient war between humans and a race of giants. Bill Nighy plays General Fallon, the leader of the cannibalistic brotherhood in an otherworld called Gantua; Ewan McGregor, above, in Errol Flynn mode, plays a knight who almost becomes finger food; and Stanley Tucci is the shifty fellow to whom the royal lass has been promised. For its first 90 minutes, Jack the Giant Slayer is painlessly diverting, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. The visual design for the giants and the beanstalks keeps your eyes busy, even when the story sets your mind to wandering. Still, she added, in the metaphorically rich original tale, a boy wakes to discover hes produced a mighty stalk. Here, the boy is now a man, and while the stalk is still impressive, the movie just doesnt have staying power. ",2013-12-14T06:00:05+0000

The European Union also condemned continued Israeli settlement construction and expressed concern over incitement and episodes of violence, actions it said undermined peace negotiations. Secretary of State John Kerry brokered a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian talks in July after years of stagnation. ",2013-12-17T02:05:25+0000

(MoreMax) ANNA KARENINA (2012) Keira Knightley (above) stars as Anna, the bored wife of a virtuous government official (Jude Law) in mid-19th-century Imperial Russia, who travels from St. Petersburg to Moscow to calm a marital storm in the household of her philandering brother (Matthew Macfadyen) in Joe Wrights stagy adaptation of this Tolstoy novel. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the man who captures her heart: Count Vronsky, a young military officer with the eyes of a poet and a domineering mother (Olivia Williams). And Alicia Vikander is Kitty, a lovely young woman adored by Levin, the gloomy rural landowner (Domhnall Gleeson) widely understood to be Tolstoys alter ego, whose idea of love  an ennobling union of souls  is a rebuke to the amorality festering in cities. I assume you know that it ends badly, but Mr. Wrights real interest, like Tolstoys, is in everything that happens in between Annas first meeting with Vronsky and her final encounter with the wheels of a train, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. And while Mr. Wrights screen versions of Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice and Ian McEwans Atonement remain trapped in literariness, he added, Mr. Wrights Anna Karenina is different. It is risky and ambitious enough to count as an act of artistic hubris, and confident enough to triumph on its own slightly  wonderfully  crazy terms. Pious Tolstoyans may knit their brows about the stylistic liberties Mr. Wright and the screenwriter, Tom Stoppard, have taken, but surely Tolstoy can withstand (and may indeed benefit from) their playful, passionate rendering of his masterpiece.

The show begins with a single man, a beaten-down bureaucrat in business drab, stamping papers at a desk before giant projections of rotating industrial cogs,  la Metropolis. It sounds like the scene is being set for some Weimar-tinged exploration of the alienation of the human worker. Not quite. Those Bauhaus facades are a mere backdrop for a dazzling display of human bodily levitation, contortion and gyration. The acrobats defy gravity in jaw-dropping performances on giant wheel-like contraptions, atop one anothers bodies, suspended from trapezes and ropes, and, astoundingly, up and down a 100-foot pole at frenetic speeds.

There are some poets whose work we read with their lives in mind, and what we know of those lives ensures that their poetry leaves a more enduring impression. C. P.

He enrolled in art school to become an illustrator in the footsteps of Howard Pyle and N. C. Wyeth, just as the Armory Show of 1913 was about to usher in the avant-garde and relegate illustration  art as storytelling  to the back pages.

When the bank was days from demolition, Gates spoke with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose brother, Ari, owns several Gates pieces; the city agreed to sell the abandoned building to Gates for $1, with the stipulation that he come up with the $3.7 million necessary for its renovation. A portion of that money, Gates devised, would be made from the banks original marble, which he cut into individual bond certificates engraved with an image of the building, his signature and the words In ART We Trust. He created 100 tablet-size bonds, selling them for $5,000 apiece; larger slabs, as weighty as tombstones, went for $50,000. Because theyre works of art, Gates told me, the marble will actually increase in value, functioning like real bonds. So, yeah, its a bank! The bank should continue to make currency.

But what about collectible limited editions, wherein a specialty publisher produces a small run of books to an exacting standard, often by hand? (Think of the old leather-bound Franklin Library titles, for example.) The Times doesnt track those, since by their nature they sell in numbers too small to register. That doesnt mean they never intersect with the best-seller lists, though. One such publisher is Joe Stefko, the owner of Charnel House books in Catskill, N.Y., who for more than 20 years has printed limited editions of Dean Koontzs novels. Stefko, 58, a former drummer for Meat Loaf, got interested in fine books when he played with the Turtles. Other bands had drug dealers coming to their dressing rooms, he told a music fan site some years ago, and we had book dealers coming to ours. As youd guess from its name  and its address, P.O. Box 666  Charnel House specializes in horror, and Stefko has designed covers with protruding fangs (for Christopher Moore), real bullets (for Stephen King) and deep fingernail gouges (for Tim Powers).

Partly as a result of her description of the attack, the authorities said, the suspects now face possible charges of inflicting serious bodily harm. Ms. Chornovol, who is also a journalist, remained hospitalized on Thursday as hundreds of people marched on the Ministry of Interior Affairs and demanded the resignation of the minister, Vitaly Zakharchenko.

(IFC) THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD (2007) Andrew Dominik directed this contemplative portrait of the final days of the outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt, above) and his gang (Sam Rockwell, Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner and others). One member of the posse is Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), who is more obsessed fan than loyal sidekick. And when Jesse James, the man, does not live up to the myth, Ford decides to grab a piece of fame for himself. Dressed in near-all black, the question mark known as Jesse James stands away from the camera, knee-deep in a golden, grassy field stirred by the wind or perhaps just an off-screen mechanical fan, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. The cinematography may speak to Mr. Dominiks yearning for meaning and importance more than it does of his outlaw, but the visuals often dazzle and enthrall.

Burleigh surveys many of the major international wars and anticolonial insurgencies between 1945 and 1965, but opts to focus most on those involving America, Britain and France, and how they related to the rivalry with the Soviet Union. The result is a well-researched and readable account of two tumultuous decades. Burleigh judges most of these wars, both small and large, to have been futile and destructive. But while he clearly has no interest in defending or rehabilitating such conflicts, he nonetheless offers a fair, thoughtful assessment of the motives and interests behind them. He also takes care to understand and explain the grievances of the insurgents.",2013-12-27T15:49:26+0000

Also memorable is Trevors May-December romance with Patricia Madrazo in Grand Theft Auto V, revealing the tender side of a psychopath, capped by the long, bittersweet drive back to Martin Madrazos house while listening to Chicagos If You Leave Me Now.

Dick Tracy has just about everything required of an extravaganza: a smashing cast, some great Stephen Sondheim songs, all of the technical wizardry that money can buy (plus the knowledge of how and when to use it), and a screenplay (credited to Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr.) that observes the fine line separating true comedy from lesser camp, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times.

Perls, has been dismissed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The suit claimed that Perls and his family held on to hundreds of Calders works, cheated the artists estate out of tens of millions of dollars over the course of three decades and sold fake Calder works. According to the decision by Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich, made public last week, the various claims are an incoherent stew of irrelevance and innuendo and the evidence failed to show that any fraud had been committed. All these allegations are so patently inadequate that the court can only conclude that they were brought solely for the purpose of harassment or embarrassment, Judge Kornreich said. The lawsuit was filed in 2010, two years after Mr. Perls died. His wife, Dolly, and employees of his gallery have also died. Calder died in 1976, leaving Judge Kornreich to conclude, Plaintiffs are attempting to litigate issues that necessarily stretch back decades without any personal knowledge or contemporaneous records, where nearly all of the people who had personal knowledge of the facts of the case are dead. Perls represented Calder for more than 20 years, and they were considered friends who frequently dined and traveled together and visited each others families.

By substituting effervescent wine for the piney, citrusy sweetness of gin, hed somehow stripped the Negroni down to its essence. Sbagliatos retain that pleasing chalkiness and minerality of Campari and the herby qualities of vermouth, but these flavors stretch out across the bubbles and somehow lead one to drink more slowly, savoring the medley. Unlike Negronis, which are all booze but taste like adult candy, Sbagliatos are less likely to put ones party-appropriate sobriety at risk. But if they do wind up going down a little too quickly, rest easy  the Sbagliato is significantly lower in alcohol by volume than its brawnier big brother, a key consideration in the holiday marathon drinking season.",2013-12-30T21:30:04+0000

A report on Tianshan News, the official news website of Xinjiang, said nine people armed with knives had attacked a police station in Shache County, near Kashgar. The attackers also threw explosive devices and set police cars on fire, the report said. It provided no further details. Violence between civilians and security forces has become increasingly common in Xinjiang, where officials say they are trying to deal with rebels or terrorists who live in towns heavily populated by ethnic Uighurs. But Uighurs in the area and some scholars in Beijing and abroad say the Chinese government exaggerates the terrorist threat and is instead mostly deploying security forces to maintain tight control over people who feel oppressed by the ethnic Han authorities.
