us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  DILWORTH, J. RICHARDSON","DILWORTH-J. Richardson. The Trustees, faculty, and staff of The Rockefeller University deeply mourn the loss of our beloved friend, J. Richardson Dilworth, an esteemed member of the Board of Trustees for more than thirty years. Dick Dilworth joined the Rockefeller Board in 1960 and was named a Trustee Emeritus in 1992. In 1993, in recognition of his outstanding service to the University community, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Science. Dick was a trusted friend and advisor to five Rockefeller University presidents. He will be remembered for his generosity of spirit, wise counsel, and the enormous personal integrity that guided all aspects of his long and productive life. Dick Dilworth's contributions of time and talent had a profound impact on all facets of life at The Rockefeller University. He played a key role in the development of much-needed housing for students and faculty and the construction of new laboratory buildings that transformed the south end of the University's campus into a modern biomedical research complex. As treasurer and chairman of the finance and investment committee, he ensured the financial health of the insitutions and oversaw a fourfold growth of the Univeristy's endowment. We will miss the keen intelligence, astute judgement, and inspiring optimism that Dick brought to every problem. His influence and legacy, however, will be felt throughout the University for many years to come. Friend, advisor, philanthropist, and cherished leader, J. Richardson Dilworth was an enlightened partner in the struggle against human disease. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Elizabeth and their beloved children, Joseph, Charles, and Alexandra and their families. Torsten N. Wiesel, President Richard M. Furlaud, Chairman Board of Trustees, and David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman and Life Trustee Board of Trustees",1998-01-01T05:00:00+0000

Rakim raps about rapping, the entire process from putting pen to paper to moving a crowd from the stage; all the while, he reminds listeners that he's a master of his profession. For him, hip-hop is a self-contained universe, a world of microphones to burn through and stages to conquer, and he rarely raps about anything else. Yet that's no limitation, since he has an apparently bottomless store of metaphors and similes for what he does. As Rakim describes it, rapping is an addiction, a craft, a weapon, a science, a career and a religion; sometimes he calls himself an emperor or a god.",1998-01-01T05:00:00+0000

A native of Miami Beach, Zig was born on December 21, 1945, the first son of Lila Greenspan (Heatter) and W. Gordon Schmitt. Zig attended schools in Miami Beach, and then The Hill School in Pennsylvania. He graduated Harvard College with honors in 1968, and was awarded a Master's degree from the Harvard School of Education the following year. Zig married Jill Keefe in 1969, and they lived in Manhattan, Coral Gables, and Amagansett, Long Island, before their divorce in 1982. Zig is survived by their daughter, Molly Schmitt, 24; and his brother, Dr. David Schmitt (Lettie Bien), and niece, Maggie Schmitt. After graduating from the University of Miami Law School, Zig joined the Riverhead, NY law firm Twomey, Latham & Schmitt, in 1978. In 1980, he was appointed Town Attorney of East Hampton. His well-regarded term enacted significant environmental legislation at a time of bitter political and ideological conflict between land developers and residents. After his term, Zig joined the Law Offices of Leonard Ackerman, in East Hampton, where he remained Of Counsel. Zig led his family's successful investigation of the mysterious death in Miami Beach of his youngest brother, Michael Heatter, in 1982. Thereafter, he litigated a trust dispute on behalf of his family, securing a landmark ruling at the Illinois Supreme Court in 1986. These experiences forged his character and talents to the great benefit of the friends and family who valued his counsel in the years that followed. An uncommon scholar, Zig's insatiable literary appetite and his avid analysis of problems and situations provided his principal pleasures. He delighted in bestowing stimulating gifts upon his friends, and he was a generous contributor to charitable and educational organizations.

In it, Nathan Lane and Lee Evans try to renovate an inherited mansion, but it's a mouse living in the walls who's made the old house home. With the help of Linda DeScenna, the production designer, the mouse (one of 60 trained mice) sleeps in an old medicine tin, tucked under a cotton gauze comforter, with a strapless wristwatch for an alarm clock. The bedside table is a thumbtack box where he keeps his treasures: buttons and foil balls. There are postage stamps for art; the old master is a postcard of Hawaii. ''It's what he dreams about every night,'' Mr. Verbinski said. ''When he sits in his bed and looks out over his room, he can see all the objects he's gathered over his life. He's kind of a collector.''",1998-01-01T05:00:00+0000

If we are to maintain a diversity of land uses and life styles in our state, these areas must be protected to balance the above-average densities elsewhere.

God was more than generous. In the next 11 years, not only did three of Susann's books land on the top of the best-seller list, but the first of them, ''Valley of the Dolls'' (1966), with sales of 29 million, ranks with the Bible as one of the most widely distributed books of all time. Susann, however, didn't live up to her end of the bargain. Once she had fame, she wanted respect, and respect was much harder to come by. Critics attributed the astonishing success of ''Valley'' to relentless marketing. Susann herself, with her skintight pink and purple Pucci outfits, spiky false eyelashes, gutter mouth and crass careerism, was considered something of a joke in literary circles. Truman Capote called her a truck driver in drag, and then apologized to truck drivers. An article in Harper's ventured that she was ''a national phenomenon and we are stuck with her.''",1998-01-04T05:00:00+0000

In some years, however, the deaths of famous figures so punctuate the news that to omit them feels unfinished -- and at times the past year seemed to carry the culture of celebrity to a new pinnacle. Even before the shock of Gianni Versace's murder had abated, the Aug. 31 death of Diana, Princess of Wales, set off another shock wave, one that still echoes on newsmagazine covers. Then, only six days later, the death of Mother Teresa elicited still another wave. For this fourth annual issue, our celebrity question reverberated.",1998-01-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction and Poetry; Captured Images,"The point of departure for THE PROFILE MAKERS (Marian Wood/Holt, $23), a radiant collection of poems by Linda Bierds, is a group of six glass-plate negatives from the Civil War era. Discovered years later by an unnamed narrator, they have been ''revived as greenhouse windows.'' Each portrays members of the narrator's family posing for ''my cousin, Mathew Brady's aide,'' in a camp ''thick with families, the fields / a hail of scattered tents.'' The six poems that describe the photographs, ''our faded wisps of family, / reversed to smoky filaments,'' are dense and haunting meditations on loss, death and the pull and ache of memory. They also provide a powerful elliptical structure for the rest of the collection, which focuses on the pioneers of captured images and the fragile machinery they employed: Van Leeuwenhoek's early microscope, the acid etchings of Rembrandt, the cave paintings at Altamira and the dashes and dots of Samuel Morse, to name a few. The tightly coiled imagery that distinguishes Bierds's fifth volume of poetry is often as surprising as it is beautiful, both in small details like ''the ferreting snouts of radishes'' or ''a wash of claret at the window'' and in larger moments: ''My mother swallowed, saw the shutter spiral down, / her face a blend of dust and wonder -- / that she might gather over glass, that she might claim, / across the flecks of bromide salt, some bygone self.''

Ackee and codfish, a common dish for lunch and dinner throughout the Caribbean, is one of the breakfast options at Apple's Caribbean Cuisine in Montclair. Other choices, most $5, are codfish with cabbage, okra or callaloo, a spinachlike green; ackee and bacon; sauteed beef liver, and mackerel served with green bananas. The breakfasts include the dense Jamaican bread called hard dough bread and a selection of fried dumplings, boiled green bananas, fried plantain or yams. There are also pancakes and eggs and the like, served with grits and salmon cakes, listed under ''American breakfasts.''

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; A Dandy's Handiwork,"''How many charming talents have been spoiled by the instilled desire to do 'important' work!'' Max Beerbohm once wrote. ''Some people are born to lift heavy weights. Some are born to juggle with golden balls.'' Beerbohm (1872-1956) was a born juggler who kept the various spheres of his talent balanced from his first publication of sketches while a student at Oxford. As his numerous self-portraits attest, he played the Edwardian dandy, affecting a lazy amateurism while in fact producing a huge corpus of work -- some 500 theater pieces for The Saturday Review, volumes of essays, parodies, stories and ''Zuleika Dobson,'' a novel so fantastic that it qualifies as a subgenre in itself. However, Beerbohm was most prolific as an artist. His more than 2,000 caricatures range in style from loose, Daumier-like impressions of Mark Twain and Lord Tweedmouth to carefully composed scenes depicting entire literary cliques, accompanied by incriminating anecdotes noted in Beerbohm's minute, exquisite cursive. N. John Hall's handsome MAX BEERBOHM CARICATURES (Yale University, $45) reproduces 213 of the best of these, many in color. Hall's witty commentary is supplemented by Beerbohm's own prose as well as contemporary observations by the likes of Virginia Woolf and E. F. Benson. Often the explications rival the caricatures in hilarity: Aldous Huxley is recalled by David Cecil as a ''piece of macaroni'' and by Lytton Strachey as a ''piece of seaweed.'' Beerbohm claimed to know everyone in London, and he pilloried most of them, but generally he did so with such good humor that most forgave him. More entertaining than conventional histories of the period, Hall's collection animates an era of eccentrics, many of whose priceless peculiarities would, but for Beerbohm, have been erased by time.

Understanding it is one thing, accepting it another, especially when diversity means not only acknowledging a pre-existing cornucopia of difference -- the very ampleness of the world -- but also accommodating an adjustment to the status quo. A case in point is the reintroduction of gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park. Thirty-three wolves were released in 1995, and their number has now reached 97. Population expansion is one measure of the wolf program's success, but a better one is the wolves' impact on the natural diversity of the park.",1998-01-04T05:00:00+0000

(In 1940, he was National Champion in the 100 Meter Backstroke). Even before World War II, Frank tried to join the British Armed Forces.

After the war, he built a notable career in advertising, first at The French Line as Public Relations and Advertising Director, and then as Director of International Advertising for L.W. Froelich. Frank was a hyper-active member of the New York Athletic Club for 61 very involved years. As Captain of its Water Polo team he led them to three National championships, in '55, '56, '57. He also covered Olympic Water Polo for the Associated Press. As a writer for Swimming World, he alone selected the 14 Best Players and 10 Best Referees in the world, throughout the '70's and '80's. As the world's leading authority on the game, he was inducted into the U.S. Water Polo Hall of Fame in 1981. In 1990, he became the first winner of the coveted U.S. Water Polo Award. A member of the Water Polo Committees of the AAU and the USOC, he also served 7 terms as First Vice President of U.S. Water Polo, Inc.

us,A Scene for All Seasons,"Summertime, and the gardening is easy. It's the other three seasons that are the real challenge. Or so says Edwina von Gal, the garden designer who transformed 11 acres of East End potato field -- surrounding a weathered wood house by Deamer & Phillips Architects -- into a lush setting (with her associate, Bob Rumsey). A hole that had been dug for a pond -- and little else -- greeted her when she began the project five years ago. Now there is a meadow and a cherry orchard, swamp grasses and day lilies, towering maples and cutting gardens. Von Gal's landscape segues from the manicured (nearest to the house) to the wild (around the pond), offering a spectacle of color and foliage year-round. While flower beds are part of the design, the key to creating this Arcadia from scratch is what von Gal calls a ''basic skeleton'' -- the right trees and shrubs, whose bone structure is ''critical to those seasons when you don't have the fancy dressing of flowers and leaves.'' Indeed, von Gal loves gardens in winter. ''You're seeing things naked, in their true identity.''",1998-01-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Personal Demons,"The most famous Vienna resident to be preoccupied with sex and death may have been Sigmund Freud, but Egon Schiele (1890-1918) was a close second. Schiele's demons had their day on paper and canvas instead of in therapy. In the decade before he died of the Spanish influenza, Schiele evolved a unique brand of Expressionism and produced some of the finest drawings and watercolors of the century. His angular, intense and erotic portraits of himself and his loved ones -- often depicted nude or exposing themselves -- earned him the labels of an unparalleled draftsman and a difficult artist for viewers. EGON SCHIELE: The Leopold Collection, Vienna (Dumont Buchverlag/Museum of Modern Art/Yale University, $60) includes color reproductions of 152 works along with critical commentary by Magdalena Dabrowski, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art. The typical anguish of the figure in one work ''is nevertheless communicated in an image of great formal discipline,'' she writes. ''Only Schiele would have been capable of combining the two.'' The book also contains an unusually provocative contribution from the collector who amassed the artworks over many years, Rudolph Leopold. Though some might disagree that toward the end of his life Schiele was ''years ahead of Picasso'' in depicting three-dimensional volumes, few would argue with Leopold's assertion that the artist managed to elevate his own troubles ''to the level of universal truth.''

Her interest in her family organization, The Independent Family Society, founded in 1914 was lifelong. She attended most of its 800 meetings. She was distinguished as the first and only American woman to own a distillery in Scotland. She produced the finest highland malt whiskey in Pitlochry, which aged in port barrels while being used as ships' ballast, sent around the world, and then bottled by her firm. With humor and style she and her late brother Abbe, brother-in-law Irving and sisters, Mildred and Pearl became wellknown figures at the Savoy in post war London, bringing American energy and optimism to national and overseas trade.

I had brought presents for the boys, as well as a gift for their friend Rickey, who lived on the other side of the housing complex, an area controlled by a rival gang. Lafeyette and Pharoah insisted on walking over with me. It was eerily quiet, since most everyone was inside, and so, bundled from the cold, we strolled toward the other end in silence. As we neared Damen Avenue, a kind of demilitarized zone, a uniformed police officer, a white woman, approached us. She looked first at the two boys, neither of whom reached my shoulder, and then directly at me. ''Are you O.K.?'' she asked.",1998-01-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; One-Way Ticket,"A middle-aged Australian, told he has a terminal illness, indulges a long-held urge to set off alone on a meandering trip, guided only by whim, chance and a need to figure out how to live without a belief in his own future. He travels to Switzerland, northern Italy and finally a hotel in Venice, where each night he retraces his journey in letters to a friend, fretting that his observations on mortality and the search for meaning have ''all been said before in a thousand different ways.'' Perhaps, but rarely with the wit, economy or success of Robert Dessaix's novel NIGHT LETTERS (Wyatt/St. Martin's, $22.95). This pocket-size book, dense with allusions to literary travelers like Dante, Casanova and Sterne, drove the Hollywood-bound ''Horse Whisperer'' from atop the Australian best-seller list. That's a testament to the popularity of its author, a book commentator on television and radio, and to the wry, chatty, surprisingly cheerful voice in which he discourses on heaven and hell, seduction and sex. (The inevitable nod to ''Death in Venice'' is Professor Eschenbaum, a fellow hotel guest drawn to S & M.) Dessaix even provides sniping footnotes to puncture every epiphany that swells too grandly. But his central insight, if hardly original, is hard won and moving: that life may be lived best as a voyage, not to get somewhere or to accumulate experiences but to savor each moment.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  PERRY, WILLIAM G., JR.","PERRY-William G., Jr. February 13, 1913-January 12, 1998. Professor of Education and founder of Harvard's Bureau of Study Counsel, died of pneumonia on January 12, 1998, in Boston. Mr. Perry began his life-long relationship with Harvard University as an undergraduate, receiving his B.A. in English and Greek in 1935, and his M.A. in English in 1940. Mr. Perry's father, William Graves Perry, Sr., Harvard class of 1905, was the architect who worked on the restoration of Williamsburg, VA, and designed many Harvard buildings, including the Houghton Rare Book Library. Mr. Perry taught English, History, and study skills at the Rivers School in Brookline, MA, from 1935 to 1940. In 1941, at Williams College, he was Assistant to the Dean and Instructor in English. During World War II, as an experienced sailor, he taught celestial navigation to naval pilots, none of whom were subseqently lost due to navigational errors. Mr. Perry founded the Bureau of Study Counsel at Harvard College in 1947, melding several student services into a center for counseling and tutoring. He and his staff counseled approximately 400 students a year. He was noted for his support of student's strengths as they confronted Harvard's curriculum, explaining he did not feel overwhelmed listening to ''problems all day.'' Instead, he said, he ''listened to courage in action.'' His closeness to students, and recognition of common themes in their experience allowed Mr. Perry to develop a map of the cognitive and moral development of undergraduates as they encountered the complexities and challenges of a liberal arts education. His book, ''Forms of Intellectual and Ethical Development in the College Years'' (1970) described nine developmental stages. His framework started with a freshman's simplistic adherence to notions of absolute truth and morality, traced the discovery of multiple frames of reference regarding data, and the upperclassman's subsequent growth and eventual achievement of personal and ethical commitment in a relative world. This developmental framework has had nation-wide impact on the theories of the psychological development of late adolescence. His research validating this developmental scheme led to his appointment as a full Professor of Education in the Harvard Graduate School of Education (1965-1979). His teaching about the counseling process and the role of empathy influenced many graduate students over the course of thirty years. A man of diverse interests, his translation, with Alston Hurd Chase, of Homer's ''Iliad'' was published in 1950. Classical scholar Dudley Fitts in his New York Times book review, described it as the best prose translation of this century. Mr. Perry's other publications include articles on topics ranging from conflicts in the learning process to essays on counseling and psychotherapy. His ironic piece on the role of ''bull'' in undergraduate epistemology, ''Examsmanship and the Liberal Arts,'' has been included in the ''Norton Anthology of American Literature.'' Family and friends remember Mr. Perry as a formidable raconteur, sailor, horseman, boat designer and carpenter, and a man deeply committed to the conservation of the salt marshes of Massachusetts, ''despite the greenhead flies.'' Mr. Perry is described as exhibiting a vigor and love of life, inviting participation in whatever project was at hand, and encouraging others to enjoy learning about themselves. Mr. Perry is survived by: his wife, Mary (Hughes Frank) of Watertown, MA, his daughter, Dr. Lee Perry of Los Altos, CA, his stepson, Kevin Frank of Holderness, NH, and his step-grandson, Brendan Frank of Boston, MA. His first wife, Helen Knowles, his son, Edmund Graves Perry, and his stepson, Colin Frank, predeceased him. The memorial service will be held at 2 PM, Sunday, January 18, at the First Parish Church Unitarian of Cambridge.

Here Miguel Angel Asturias, the 1967 Nobel laureate, retells some of the traditional stories of his native Guatemala in an elliptical, languid prose that is bewildering and enchanting, and never simple. Translated for the first time -- by Gilbert Alter-Gilbert -- more than 20 years after its author's death (and 30 years after its Spanish publication), the book challenges readers with frequent convolutions leading to destinations that are hard to pin down. Hard because Mayan mythology and Guatemalan folk tales are themselves of a convoluted nature, full of the stops and starts of mistake-prone deities and human bumblers. And also hard because Asturias was working toward a new, myth-based fiction and an undercurrent of complexity fitted his purposes. ''The Indians of Guatemala,'' he writes, ''are like fragments of the imagination.'' So are these stories featuring people who eat dreams, a man who ''disappeared for the sake of disappearing'' and a church bell that refuses to ring. ''The Mirror of Lida Sal'' is a surreal journey through a landscape charged with light ironies and weighty implications. James Polk",1998-01-18T05:00:00+0000

Connor, who studied with the color theorist Josef Albers and was the host of the public television series ''Museum Open House'' from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, paints with an eerie verisimilitude. Some of his images actually do resemble a lost version of an alternative art history: you might have to look twice to figure out what is ''wrong'' with his image of Renoir's sunny lovers from ''Dance at Bougival'' two-stepping on rain-slicked cobblestones in front of the melancholy strollers from Caillebotte's ''Place de l'Europe on a Rainy Day.'' Some of Connor's best effects and most trenchant commentaries derive from the paintings of Manet, whom he calls ''my favorite silent partner in this reckless and rewarding adventure.'' Magically, Connor whisks away the artifice of art history to forge some deeper connections, and makes us smile all the while. Eric P. Nash",1998-01-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  HARASZTI, ALEXANDER S., DR.","HARASZTI-Alexander S., Dr. His family and numerous friends will greatly miss Dr. Alexander S. Haraszti, who died on Jan. 16, 1998 in Atlanta. Dr. Haraszti was an ordained Baptist minister, a linguist who spoke eight languages, and a physician who practiced first as an obstetrician-gynecologist in his native Hungary, and then in Atlanta for over three decades as a general surgeon. Dr. Haraszti was born in 1920 in Soltvadkert, Hungary. He received a doctoral degree in linguistics from the Royal Hungarian Pazmany Pater Univ in Budapest in 1944, and was ordained as a Baptist Minister in Hungary in 1944 and for many years was a Professor at the Baptist Theological Seminary in Budapest, Hungary. Over the next twelve years he preached the Gospel extensively as a minister in Hungary, in the process supporting both his own medical studies as well as the medical studes of his wife, Rosalie B. Haraszti. He received his medical degree from Semmelweis University School of Medicine in Budapest in 1951. During the Hungarian uprising against Soviet domination in 1956, Dr. Alexander Haraszti left Hungary with his wife and five children, intent on pursuing his goal of serving God as a medical missionary. After a short stay in Vienna, Dr. Haraszti brought his family to the United States where he furthered his medical training, interning in St. Louis, then serving as a surgical resident at Emory University, the VA Hospital and Grady Memorial Hospital from 1960-1964. In the years that followed Dr. Haraszti realized his dream of becoming a medical missionary, practicing in Ghana, Tanzania and the Gaza Strip. In addition to this mission work, Dr. Haraszti practiced medicine in College Park, Jonesboro and Henry County. In addition to his devotion to his family and patients, Dr. Haraszti committed over two decades of his life to fledgling evangelical movements in Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and the Soviet Union. Dr. Haraszti served for many years as the personal emissary of Billy Graham in Eastern Europe, ensuring that Dr. Graham would accomplish his historically important goal of bringing the Gospel behind the Iron Curtain. Using his vast energy, intellect, considerably diplomatic finesse and historical and religious insight to great advantage, Dr. Haraszti was instrumental in securing an invitation for Dr. Graham to preach first in Hungary in 1977, where he also served as Dr. Graham's translator. Using this first evangelical opening to great effect, Dr. Haraszti secured invitations for Billy Graham to preach in Poland in 1978, East Germany and Czechoslovakia in 1982, and then the Soviet Union in 1982, 1984 and 1988. During that same time, Dr. Haraszti helped to secure the return of the Crown of St. Stephen to Hungary from the United States Government, which had obtained it during World War II. The crowning achievement of these efforts in Eastern Europe was the Crusade in Hungary in 1989, during which over 110,000 people gathered at the People's Stadium in Budapest with Billy Graham preaching and Dr. Haraszti translating. Dr. Haraszti was of the firm belief that the spread of the Gospel in Eastern Europe would help to create fissures in the control the communist regimes held in these nations. Determined to spread his faith in an ecumenical fashion, Dr. Haraszti labored to assist Christians of all faiths to come together. He was instrumental in facilitating and arranging the historical first meeting between Pope John Paul II and Billy Graham on January 12, 1981. Since retiring from his medical practice in 1994, Dr. Haraszti worked extensively on his memoirs, chronicling his contributitions to the Hungarian Baptist movement, and the important work that he performed with Billy Graham. He also continued to promote an ecumenical spirit here in the United States as well as his native Hungary. Dr. Haraszti remained active until his death in the American Hungarian Baptist Union, for which he served as president for many years, and for which he had been made honorary president at the time of his death. Dr. Haraszti gained the most delight from the frequent family gatherings he organized at his home in Atlanta, and from the larger family reunions he spearheaded in his birthplace of Soltvadkert. Dr. Haraszti is survived by his wife Dr. Rosalie Haraszti, his sons Dr. Joseph Haraszti and Dr. Leland Haraszti, his daughters Dr. Rose Badaruddin and her husband Syed Badaruddin, Stella Beerman and her husband, noted contemporary American composer Professor Burton Beerman, his daughter Dr. Pamela Guoth and her husband Dr. Janos Guoth, his granddaughter Dr. Anisa Threlkeld and her husband Robert Threlkeld, his granddaughter Samantha Haraszti, his grandsons Chris Haraszti, Brent Beerman and his wife Sandy, Johnny Guoth, Kareem Badaruddin and his wife Denise, Shandor Badaruddin and his wife Michelle, and his great grandchildren Justin and Jessica Beerman, Bryce Saber Badaruddin and Anisa Rose Threlkeld, as well as four surviving sisters of Dr. Haraszti and numerous nephews and nieces.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Shorter Than Sweet,"THE NOVELLAS OF HORTENSE CALISHER (Modern Library, $20) -- a collection of work published from 1963 to 1987, along with one previously unpublished novella -- highlights Hortense Calisher's talents as a creator of distinctive characters. Most are slightly marginal people (like the eccentric Indian doctor of ''Tale for the Mirror'' or the reformed prostitute of ''Women Men Don't Talk About'') whose lives are damaged by mental illness, alcoholism, spousal abuse, injury or money troubles. Still, they revel in the signs and symbols of regeneration found in the world around them, and frequently celebrate mere existence through dedicated living. ''Saratoga, Hot'' tells of a woman and her husband who spend their days on the well-heeled edges of the town's famous race track, soaking up the reflected glory, while ''Extreme Magic'' follows an antique dealer as he rescues a battered wife from her alcoholic husband through a miraculous -- and epiphanic -- intervention. In ''The Railway Police,'' Calisher charts an heiress's descent into a kind of vagabondism, and in ''The Man Who Spat Silver,'' the most experimental of these tales, she makes language itself the key to unlocking a shifting, hypnotic narrative of love and obsession. Challenging and potent, Calisher's novellas are enmeshed in history and intensely personal details. In her introduction, she writes that a novella ''is not merely a shorter novel'' but ''a small one, tenaciously complete.'' The seven collected here reveal just how tenacious and complete a novella can be. Erik Burns",1998-01-25T05:00:00+0000

Ariel, with his mother, the sculptress Fausta Vittoria Mengarini, came to the United States when he was still a young boy. He finished his education in Washington, D.C. and in New York. When he was 23, he became United States Amateur Chess Champion. Chess was a lifelong obsession for him. He became a United States citizen in 1942. He honorably served in World War II. He was a Captain in the United States Army Medical Corps-Neuropsychiatrist. In Germany, he made part of a team to take over the administration of a large prison-of-war hospital. He received three campaign medals and the World War II Victory Medal. Honorably discharged in October 1946. He worked for the United States Government as a psychiatrist. He was devoted to his patients and said that he was ''proud to have helped a great many of them.'' Upon retiring, he continued his intense interest in the game of chess, playing in tournaments throughout the rest of his life.

In the 1920's, the resurrection of these world-towering figures became central to New York's self-celebration. New York then gave its special vitality to every new movement in art and literature. Only New York had virtually every leading publishing house, most of the national magazines (three of the best known have ''New York'' in their titles) and neighborhoods, like Greenwich Village, famous for the literary and artistic rebellions they inspired.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Father of the 'Family',"Photography is the essential art of the 20th century, and Edward Steichen did more to advance its artistic, technical and commercial limits than almost anyone. Based on exhaustive research in the personal papers of Steichen's family and friends, Penelope Nivens's STEICHEN: A Biography (Clarkson Potter, $45) follows every groundbreaking step of the photographer's life. Combining his skills as a painter, designer and photographer, Steichen (1879-1973) battled for the acceptance of photography as art and pioneered the photographic conquest of the mass media. He revolutionized the science of aerial reconnaissance and produced some of the first fine color photos. As curator of the ''Family of Man'' exhibition in 1957 at the Museum of Modern Art, Steichen brought socially conscious documentary photography into museums and before the eyes of a vast audience. Nivens, the author of a biography of Carl Sandburg, complements her own clear, lyrical voice with the eloquent words of Steichen's contemporaries. She describes the ''liquid motion'' and ''forms dancing in the light'' of Steichen's photographs, and quotes one critic who wrote of Steichen, ''Like a highwayman he lies in wait for beauty.'' Nivens sometimes seems more concerned with her research than with her readers; she repeats nearly identical quotations and uses oddly stilted language to explain gaps in the story. But for the most part she succeeds in weaving the many threads of Steichen's life into a seamless narrative. Jake Miller",1998-01-25T05:00:00+0000
