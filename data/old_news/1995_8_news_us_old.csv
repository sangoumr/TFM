The piece is about the feelings of a 45-year-old woman whose husband has suddenly left her with three children; she has no skills, she has never worked and her husband would like to take the house they lived in for 20 years. The handwriting is neat, and the writer has a nice sense of words, phrasing and detail -- given the constraints of the first-day essay, it is an excellent piece of work.

us,DIARY,"Media And Then There Was One It was a truly unbelievable week. The Walt Disney Company surprised everybody by announcing on Monday that it would buy Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion, in what would be the second-largest takeover ever. Then on Tuesday, in a deal that surprised almost no one, Westinghouse said it would buy CBS for $5.4 billion. Of course, all eyes then turned to NBC, like, ""Isn't it your turn on Wednesday?"" NBC's president, Robert C. Wright, jokingly said, ""We're the small guy just trying to make it in the business,"" but then acknowledged that he received ""a lot of phone calls this week"" from interested companies. As they say in the television business, stay tuned. Technology Is This Goodbye to OS/2? There is MS-DOS, there is Microsoft Windows. There is even the Apple Macintosh operating system. But of the software that runs personal computers, there had barely been I.B.M.'s OS/2. While Microsoft's operating system software controlled about 76 percent of the market in 1994 and the Macintosh 12 percent, I.B.M.'s OS/2 had 5 percent. Analysts have been predicting that I.B.M. would stop development of the software in January. Louis V. Gerstner, I.B.M.'s chief executive, didn't confirm that last week, but appeared to concede the battle to Microsoft. Obsessing about operating systems, he told a meeting of analysts, is ""fighting the last war,"" adding later, that it is ""too late to go after the desktop."" A fact that was probably obvious to most of the analysts in the audience years ago. Trade O.K., Stop All This 'Nice' Talk Sometimes speaking sensibly doesn't pay. Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, learned that last week after he made a speech in Tokyo calling for the United States and Japan to basically be nicer to each other in trade negotiations. ""A relationship between the world's two biggest trading nations that is characterized by one trade confrontation after another seems as anachronistic as the old gunboat diplomacy,"" he said. The Japanese reacted cautiously, saying, ""I don't think this is official U.S. policy."" Good call. The next day, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said his aide was not speaking for the Administration. ""All of us at the Commerce Department, Jeff included,"" Mr. Brown said, ""ought to have absolutely unassailable credibility on the Japan issue; we were the tough guys."" Sounds like the days of ""Speak softly and carry a big stick"" are over. Currency A Boost for the Dollar At least the Americans and the Japanese are doing something together. On Wednesday, they jointly sold about $1 billion worth of yen in an attempt to strengthen the dollar. The Japanese also moved to change the rules on overseas investments that will make it easier for institutions to invest abroad. All this action sent the dollar up 3.3 percent, pushing it above 90 yen for the first time in more than four months. And Administration officials did nothing to discourage traders from speculating that the United States would intervene again. As Mr. Garten was trying to say, a little cooperation goes a long way. Airlines F.A.A. Grounds an Airline You don't have to sit around a campfire at midnight to hear scary stories. The F.A.A. last week grounded Markair, a small airline in Denver that serves such cities as Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. It carries about 4,000 passengers a day. At least it used to. The F.A.A. claims that the airline left several key positions vacant, including its manager of maintenance control, manager of maintenance and chief inspector. The company's vice president of operations is also serving as vice president of maintenance, ""a split of duties which does not permit him to devote adequate attention to the responsibilities of the latter position."" The F.A.A. also said the company ""failed to track and act upon information pertaining to the mechanical performance of its aircraft, engines and aircraft components."" Scared yet? The F.A.A. obviously was. Telecommunications Earnings Up, Employees Down Your company has just reported that its quarterly earnings jumped 21 percent. The growth in sales of its main product outpaced any of its rivals. Life is good. Not at MCI, where they want life to get much better. Along with all that good news, the long-distance telephone company on Wednesday also announced a major restructuring. It will dismiss 2,500 to 3,000 employees by the end of the year, write off obsolete assets and possibly issue special classes of stock tied to parts of its business. Analysts said MCI wanted to make its stock more attractive. It rose 62.5 cents on Wednesday, but then fell 50 cents on Thursday and barely moved on Friday. Wonder what the company has up its sleeve next? Corporations Why Not White Plains? Prodigy Services was all set to move its headquarters from relatively quiet White Plains to hip Manhattan. Then on Wednesday, the on-line computer services company said it would remain in White Plains, but would open a 50-person office in Manhattan. Why? The company says the larger move would have been disruptive. Analysts had a more intriguing reason. They said there was a struggle between longtime executives who are wary of radical change and newer executives who see a Manhattan move as a way to help the company appeal to a younger crowd. The New York office was seen as a compromise. Prodigy is owned by Sears and I.B.M. Sears moved most of its employees out of bustling downtown Chicago a few years ago and set them up in a nearby suburb out on the prairie. I.B.M. is headquartered in Armonk. Looks like those youngsters at Prodigy better get used to White Plains. Appliances If I Only Had a Brain Just what we need, a refrigerator that's smarter than we are. Refrigerators have had a reputation for being dumb. Electronically, even a doorbell is considered smarter, which in the world of appliances must be the ultimate put-down. The Whirlpool Corporation and Amana Refrigeration are now making refrigerators equipped with microprocessors that tell these former dumb boxes when to defrost. Another company is also coming out with a computerized timer that will shift the defrosting to nighttime when electric rates are cheaper. It'll almost be as if they had brains. Maybe now they'll be able to answer the puzzling refrigerator question: ""Is it cold in here or is it just me?""",1995-08-06T05:00:00+0000

It is also a reminder that despite platitudes about ""working together to win back the fans,"" there is little cause for optimism that the two sides, left to their own devices, will prevent a repeat of what happened last year.",1995-08-06T05:00:00+0000

Britain, on the other hand, has the frequently farcical ""McLibel"" case -- the lawsuit filed by McDonald's against two vegetarian environmentalists on the unemployment dole who distributed a leaflet some years back implicating the American burger chain in a variety of greed-driven crimes against earth, humankind and beast. While not televised, the libel proceedings offer, to those spectators willing to endure long bouts of tedious testimony, moments of high absurdity as world views collide: It's the (sometimes) bewigged lawyers and suited executives of McDonald's versus the defendants in jeans and sandals, who are representing themselves. The defendants -- Dave Morris, 41, a former postal worker, and Helen Steel, 29, a gardener -- say they have succeeded in turning the tables on McDonald's in court by putting its practices on trial. Many evidently agree: McDonald's stockholders have complained that the trial -- the longest libel trial in British history at 13 months and counting -- is a costly public-relations disaster, and the company has reportedly pursued a settlement.

The Language of Loss","""No leading contemporary artist has responded more seriously or assiduously to the challenge of AIDS and associated loss than Ross Bleckner,"" Simon Watney, a critic and the director of the London-based Red Hot AIDS Charitable Trust, writes in ROSS BLECKNER (Guggenheim Museum/ Abrams, $65). What is needed in response to the devastation wreaked by AIDS, Mr. Watney says, is ""a symbolic language appropriate to our losses, and Bleckner has provided us with one."" Many of the artworks reproduced in the book display that language, while some also reveal what Thomas Crow, an art historian at the University of Sussex, calls in another essay Mr. Bleckner's ""friendliness to emblems of sentiment."" Another profound influence on Mr. Bleckner's work is photography, and Mr. Crow offers a fascinating discussion of, among other things, the controversial correspondence between the glossy surfaces of Mr. Bleckner's paintings and the coating on photographic prints -- a relationship that, he suggests, offends some purists. Lisa Dennison, the curator of collections and exhibitions at the Guggenheim Museum, cites the significant role Mr. Bleckner has played in re-establishing the canvas as a space for portraying images of light. Noting the many influences on Mr. Bleckner, Ms. Dennison finds that the memento mori iconography prevalent in so many of his paintings ""provokes associations of nostalgia, melancholy, remembrance, loss and, most explicitly, death""; she connects Mr. Bleckner's imagery with that of such fin-de-siecle Symbolists as Gustave Moreau and Odilon Redon.

""Fake!,"" for example, begins with a quote from Mallarme about fake Rubens paintings, turns to a British Museum exhibition of objects that ""conned experts of yesteryear,"" and spins past an art forger before focusing on the dubious competition for ownership of ""the most famous shop in England"" -- Harrods. ""Traffic Jam at Buckingham Palace"" is a smart precis on the royal family, suitable for a reader who has not paid attention to the comings, goings and doings that have entertained and appalled the rest of us. If the exhaustive account in ""The Deficit Millionaires"" of the Lloyd's of London insurance crisis leaves the issues somewhat elusive still, oh well: it's the barest stumble in a grand collection.",1995-08-06T05:00:00+0000

The hero of the author's 11th work of fiction has his creator's name and many of his identifying characteristics. But nothing else -- including the flow of time itself -- occurs in the expected manner. This autobiography-cum-novel ""is brilliantly conceived, elegantly written, bursting with life,"" R. H. W. Dillard said here last year. THE STRUGGLE FOR RUSSIA By Boris Yeltsin. Translated by Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. Times Books/Random House, $14. This memoir by a man who is his country's first freely elected leader has been reissued with an index (the hard-cover edition lacked one) and a new preface that refers to the events in Chechnya. But here, as in the rest of his book, Mr. Yeltsin makes a plea for popular support for a reformed but unified nation. Containing journal entries written mostly between August 1991 and October 1993, the book ""is a reminder of how delicate a plant Russia's flowering of freedom is,"" Paul Johnson wrote in these pages in 1994, ""and suggests that in present circumstances Mr. Yeltsin, with all his faults, may be the best -- indeed the only -- man to nurture it."" Russia's totalitarian past is the subject of SPECIAL TASKS: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness -- A Soviet Spymaster, by Pavel Sudoplatov and Anatoli Sudoplatov with Jerrold L. Schecter and Leona P. Schecter (Back Bay/ Little, Brown, $14.95). As a member of Stalin's security forces, Pavel Sudoplatov participated in numerous murders and oversaw atomic espionage in Britain and the United States. Although last year our reviewer, Adam B. Ulam, cautioned against taking Mr. Sudoplatov's statements at face value, he found ""Special Tasks"" ""a valuable document and very readable."" MR. VERTIGO By Paul Auster. Penguin, $10.95. This novel concerns the career of a St. Louis orphan named Walt, who is plucked from the streets in 1924 by a charismatic sage named Master Yehudi. Yehudi gets both Walt and the story off the ground by teaching the boy to fly. The tale ""is witty, inventive in its language and invitingly playful with its metaphors,"" Jay Cantor wrote in the Book Review last year. THE DUKE ELLINGTON READER Edited by Mark Tucker. Oxford University, $15.95. No one, it seems, had a halfhearted opinion either about jazz or about the man who created some of its most famous compositions. This collection includes praise, criticism and even some of Ellington's own words. It ""is full of excellent writing,"" our reviewer, Peter Keepnews, said in 1993. Oxford is also the publisher of JAZZ: The American Theme Song, by James Lincoln Collier ($12.95), which seeks to subvert some time-honored dogmas concerning the music's roots. In doing so Mr. Collier ""mounts an impressive examination of Creole culture,"" Russell Davies wrote in these pages in 1993. THE PRINCE OF WEST END AVENUE By Alan Isler. Penguin, $9.95. Otto Korner, Holocaust survivor and published poet, is the resident of a Manhattan retirement home that is mounting a production of ""Hamlet."" As Otto explores the theatrical milieu of his present, he is drawn into the dark world of his Auschwitz past in a story that ""is able to haunt us,"" Bette Pesetsky said here last year. LOOKING AT THE SUN: The Rise of the New East Asian Economic and Political System By James Fallows. Vintage, $14. The author analyzes the strength of Japanese industrial policies, arguing that the Asian tendency to ignore standard laissez-faire doctrine should be a cautionary lesson to the West. Last year our reviewer, F. M. Scherer, said he ""provides fascinating insights."" I AM SNOWING: The Confessions of a Woman of Prague By Pavel Kohout. Translated by Neil Bermel. Harvest/ Harcourt Brace, $13. Written by a Czech author once exiled as a dissident, this novel is narrated by Petra Marova, who is confused by the conflicting claims of her lovers and by the new choices of capitalism. It ""is undeniably impressive,"" John Bayley said in the Book Review last year. The same publisher has also reissued a novella by another dissident author, the Chilean Luis Sepulveda. THE OLD MAN WHO READ LOVE STORIES, ($8), centers on an elderly settler in the Amazon who is asked to lead an expedition to track an ocelot that has been killing white prospectors. ""Readers will be enchanted by this finely wrought tale,"" David Unger wrote here in 1994. ABDUCTION: Human Encounters With Aliens By John Mack. Ballantine, $6.99. Including a new preface in which the author, a Harvard psychiatrist, addresses his critics, this book explains his research into the experiences of people who claim to have been contacted by extraterrestrials. Last year our reviewer, James S. Gordon, felt that Dr. Mack's investigations, while not entirely convincing, were still ""fascinating, suggestive and even inspiring."" AVA By Carole Maso. Dalkey Archive, $12.95. Written in staccato sentences that reveal the second-by-second images traversing a woman's mind, this novel unfolds on a single day in the life of a college professor stricken with cancer -- her last. It ""uses repetition and thematic layering to create a shimmering, impressionistic portrait that eschews linear narrative,"" Wendy Smith said in the Book Review in 1993. UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES: A Memoir of the Fifties. By Sally Belfrage. Harper Perennial, $13. The author tried hard to be the pert blond cheerleader the era demanded, but even in high school she had too much baggage: her British parents were former Communists and ultimately deported. She ""is a sharp, unsentimental observer,"" Elinor Langer wrote here in 1994. LAUREL GRAEBER",1995-08-06T05:00:00+0000

us,BUSINESS DIGEST,"Global Media Powers Stir Some Local Fears The globalization of the entertainment business is seen by many people as a threat to independent television stations, which can tailor programming to local tastes. That worry helped move 60 Republicans to join 168 Democrats last week in voting to retain stricter limits on media ownership. The vote scaled back a House bill that clears away regulations in every other corner of the communications industry. For their part, media executives say they have little choice but to consolidate into giant companies that produce and distribute programming. [ Page A1. ] ABC Leader Sees Strengths Known in the television industry as a deft handler of business relationships, Robert A. Iger, the president of Capital Cities/ABC, faces a new challenge in his new, mercurial boss, Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of Disney. But Mr. Iger seems to be focusing on areas in which the combined companies can do better than they could have as separate entities, like international expansion and joint programming. Mr. Iger also hopes that ABC can tap Disney's expertise in areas like theme parks, stores and toys. As an example, he might seek to build ESPN network virtual-reality theaters to give audiences the sense that they are on the field. [ D6. ] Disney Purchase Inspires Fear Disney's purchase of ABC has major movie studios and other producers of prime-time television programs shaking. Will access to ABC -- a vital route to the lucrative syndication of a show -- be sharply cut for non-Disney productions? Will studios be forced to focus on distribution as much as content? Disney has moved to quell some fears, but skeptics abound. [ D6. ] CBS Deal's Unusual Terms CBS could accept another bidder without having to pay Westinghouse a $150 million breakup fee, according to terms of the deal disclosed on Friday. And under certain circumstances, Westinghouse would have to pay CBS if the deal falls apart. [ D6. ] A New Budget Plan Emerges The White House is considering a strategy that would try to rally a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans around an alternative to the Republican plan to produce a balanced budget in several years. [ A1. ] Virtual Reality's Starter Home The first store in the United States devoted to sales of virtual-reality equipment is in Indianapolis, wedged between a pizza parlor and Laundromat. The technology, which combines headsets, gloves and other equipment with computer programs, allows users to feel as if they are inside a computer-generated landscape. So far, nearly all the store's sales have been of low-price accessories like magazines and T-shirts. But some analysts calculate that the virtual-reality market -- now estimated at less than $90 million a year in consumer sales -- will explode into a $6 billion business by the end of the century. And chain stores like Incredible Universe and Comp USA are stocking virtual-reality games and accessories in preparation. [ D5. ] Powerful 'Soul Train' Just as it did when Afro hair styles and platform shoes ruled in the 1970's, ""Soul Train"" continues to pull its weight. The last remaining dance show on broadcast television is about to enter its 25th season, making it the longest-lasting program now in first-run syndication. And it remains under the direction of its creator, Don Cornelius. [ D7. ] Microsoft's Other System Windows 95 is getting all the attention, but the big winner at Microsoft could be Windows NT, which is used on corporate computer networks. The company is hoping that Windows 95 will lure customers and software developers to its corporate system, a market in which Microsoft has been trailing. [ D5. ]",1995-08-07T05:00:00+0000

In fact, Mr. Brockway, 74, says he's never done much of anything else. Over the last 60 years, he estimates, he has built more than 5,000 boats.

[ 26. ] NOW, GREENPORT WILL ABOLISH ITS COURT Nine months after voting to disband their nine-member police force, residents of Greenport, L.I., have taken another step to reduce the size and cost of government: they decided on Tuesday to abolish their town's court and unseat a part-time village justice whose term does not expire for two years.

Mr. White was captured without incident on an Albany street a day after he was let out of jail by mistake because, among the 825 or so inmates, there was another with the first name Lamont.

After trying for at least the last year to find a way to profitably separate from its subsidiary, G.M. has decided on a stock swap that will leave E.D.S. in the hands of its shareholders. The computer services company has been a continuing source of minor management headaches since G.M. bought it from Ross Perot in 1984. Mr. Perot joined G.M.'s board of directors and spent years criticizing the company's management until it bought him out for $742.8 million. Earlier this year, G.M. contributed its E.D.S. shares to the automaker's underfunded pension plans, meaning the company received little benefit from owning E.D.S. ""Parting,"" Shakespeare wrote, ""is such sweet sorrow."" Or maybe just sweet. Music Looking for the Door In what could be another who-needs-the-headaches deal, Time Warner was said to be in negotiations to sell its 50 percent stake in Interscope Records back to the record company's executives. Interscope has such artists as Tom Jones and gangsta rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. Time Warner has received a lot of grief, especially from the Republicans, for distributing gangsta rap music because of its violent and sexually degrading lyrics. Selling Interscope is probably the simplest way for Time Warner to escape the controversy. It is unclear whether the Republicans ever complained about Tom Jones. Banking Bank Attracts Very Big Investor Yo! Who just put down more than $3 million to become a major shareholder of a relatively obscure bank in Trenton, N.J.? O.K., that's not fair because you'd never guess. White Eagle Enterprises, a New Jersey investment group, notified the S.E.C. that it bought 23,100 shares of the Yardville National Bancorp and now owns 7.1 percent, or about 165,100, of its shares. The man behind White Eagle is Sylvestor Stallone, who didn't exactly make his name on Wall Street. But analysts said New Jersey banks are prime takeover targets, so owning a hunk of Yardville may be a good move. This is the man who just signed a three-picture deal with Universal Pictures that was said to be worth more than $60 million. Sounds like there may be more Warren Buffett than Rambo in Mr. Stallone these days. Securities Industry Another Victim at Prudential First, many of Prudential Securities' customers complained. Now it's the brokers. The company in 1993 settled securities fraud charges that it misled investors about the risks of limited partnerships. The company agreed to set up a $1.4 billion fund to repay the thousands of investors who had lost money. Those partnerships had been sold to them by the brokers of Prudential Securities. One of those brokers, Betty S. Allen who had sold about $12 million worth of the partnerships, had complained to an arbitration panel that all the customer complaints about the partnerships made it impossible for her to find other work in the securities industry. Her lawyer said the sales material for the partnerships that was provided by Prudential to its brokers was misleading. But brokers also got prospectuses, which laid out the pros and cons of the investments. Didn't Ms. Allen read them? Ms. Allen wouldn't comment on that last week. And now she doesn't have to. The arbitration panel awarded her $327,000. Wall Street A Good Start, Spoiled Netscape Communications, the Internet software company, had a stunning debut on Wall Street Wednesday. The initial public offering was priced at $28 a share, but closed for the day at $58.25, up a dramatic $30.25. A lot of people made a lot of money. But a lot of people lost a lot of money. The issue was so hot, that the size of the offering was increased and still many investors couldn't get stock at the offering price. So they had to buy when the stock began trading. The first trade: $71 a share. And it stayed at around $70 until early afternoon before it started to decline. It then fell almost $7 on Thursday and closed unchanged, at $51.375, on Friday. That's a loss of almost $20 a share since Wednesday's first trade. So, Netscape did have quite a stunning week, no matter from where you look at it. Publishing Turn Off That TV At first it sounded like refreshing news. Two new studies showed that over the next few years Americans would increase their spending on books and would even be spending more to read then they would on recorded music or home videos. The key word here, of course, is spend. Spending will increase because the cost of books will be going up, but the number of books sold is expected to almost flatten out by 1996. It could be because of electronic publishing, as more books go digital. Then again, maybe the reason will be that in 1996, we all could still be stuck in front of the TV watching the O.J. trial. Tobacco The President Sets an Example President Clinton came down hard on the tobacco companies last week. He proposed regulations to keep cigarettes away from teenagers. He wants to ban cigarette sales from vending machines and wants tobacco companies to stop brand-name advertising at sporting events. ""It is wrong to believe that we can take a voluntary approach to this problem,"" Mr. Clinton said. How true. When asked if he would voluntarily give up the cigars he occasionally smokes, he said, no, he wouldn't. ""I try to set a good example,"" he said. ""I try never to do it where people see. I admitted that I did, I did do it when Captain O'Grady was found because I was so happy. It was a form of celebration."" Mr. Clinton might have just added to the traditions of smoking. Cigars are expected after a baby is born. Smoking after sex is a classic icon. And now, having a good smoke after resolving a national emergency. Perhaps that's why amid all the turmoil, analysts continue to say that tobacco stocks are still a wonderful buy. Sports Can Nike Be Far Behind? It's always interesting to watch capitalism crop up in unlikely places: Vietnam, Russia, England. Yes, England. Money, and lots of it, is about to infect the very English, and amateur, sport of rugby. England's national team is negotiating a $2.4 million deal to sell promotional logo space on its team jerseys, with about a third of the money going to players. And more eye-popping in a sport in which the players often perform for nothing, Rupert Murdoch is paying $500 million to broadcast games from South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. ""The whole ethos of rugby has been about sport, about a kind of courtesy, decency and manners,"" one rugby expert said. Yes, and basketball used to be played with peach baskets.",1995-08-13T05:00:00+0000

us,A Man and His Birds,"It is only a slight exaggeration to say that Roger Tory Peterson taught Americans how to look at birds. His book ""A Field Guide to the Birds,"" first published in 1934, was ""the single most revolutionary development in American birding,"" William Zinsser asserts in ROGER TORY PETERSON: The Art and Photography of the World's Foremost Birder (Rizzoli, $50). At the time, bird guides were bulky and burdened with confusing detail. Mr. Peterson's pocket-sized work focused on the essential features by which a species could be swiftly and unerringly identified, even by neophytes. His bold, precise drawings and paintings stressed coloration, the shapes of beaks, wing feathers and tails. His prose was equally clear and succinct: he summed up the male goldfinch as ""the only small yellow bird with black wings."" Mr. Peterson is quoted in this handsomely designed retrospective of his work -- which he edited himself along with Rudy Hoglund, the art director of Money magazine, with text by Mr. Zinsser, a neighbor of Mr. Peterson's and the author of ""On Writing Well"" -- as saying that his main purpose has been to instruct. In a career that has stretched over 60 years and generated 19 books on birds and thousands of paintings and photographs, he has inspired and informed several generations of birders. But as the scores of artworks gathered here demonstrate, Mr. Peterson is above all a highly original and accomplished artist. Indeed, some of his paintings, like the portraits of snowy owls and of a pair of peregrine falcons, rival Audubon's in their perfection of detail and use of color. RICHARD E.

A giant bluefin that has been properly bled and gutted as soon as it is caught and immediately put on ice can be worth several dollars a pound -- as much as $20 a pound if it is in perfect condition and has a high fat content, which is preferable when the fish is to be eaten raw, said Capt.

In her eight months as acting chairwoman, she had cut the annual rate of Russian inflation from around 1,200 percent to 225 percent.

A1 CALM REIGNS AGAIN IN CUBA Despite discontent that led to riots and many refugees last year in Cuba, the situation has calmed down, in part due to the Government's reforms -- though there are more circuses than bread. A1 IN IRAQ, LONGTIME FEUD The infighting in Iraq's ruling clique that led two sons-in-law of President Saddam Hussein to defect to Jordan is the most intense round of fighting in a regime that has been marked by feuding. A3 JORDAN EDGES AWAY FROM IRAQ King Hussein of Jordan said the defections from Iraq had been a hard blow to its Government, indicating that Iraq's power is waning and that Jordan is distancing itself from Iraq's leader. A3 CHECHNYA PACT THREATENED Russia threatened to cut off peace negotiations with separatist rebels from Chechnya unless they carried out an agreement to disarm, but they refused, saying they disagreed with some of the terms. A5 PRESSURE FOR BALKAN PEACE A group of diplomats left for the Balkans to press for peace, with the United States contending that recent Serbian losses in Croatia presented a chance to press the Serbs to accept an agreement. A10 MEXICO POLICE CITED IN KILLINGS Mexico said that police killed 17 peasants in June and that senior officials had covered up the killings, in a case that has become a test of the Government's commitment to protect human rights. A6 Some separatists condemned the killing in Kashmir. A11 Paris Journal: From a Gaul, a challenge to the mouse.

us,Heroes and Villains,"Most heroes never survived the decline of the epic: their legends could not withstand the sharp scrutiny of new forms, especially the keen eye of historical criticism. In self-conscious response to this loss of the heroic, the English historian C. V. Wedgwood offers MONTROSE (St. Martin's, $35), a biography of the Marquess of Montrose, a 17th-century Scottish aristocrat chosen by King Charles I of England to quell a rebellion in Scotland. The author claims that Montrose qualifies as a true hero, one who still exhibits the luster of Achilles, Lancelot and Roland even after his story is told in simple prose. And she is persuasive; her writing ably captures Montrose's unflagging resolve in the face of battles, intrigue and execution. Each speech Montrose delivers to rally his outnumbered troops, each march he leads across the desolate highlands, becomes a fascinating illustration of his skill and spirit. His actions allow his biographer to catalogue a full store of chivalric traits. C. Veronica Wedgwood, whose books include ""The Thirty Years' War,"" ""Oliver Cromwell"" and ""The Trial of Charles I,"" tells her story dramatically: ""Messengers came gloomily home to their chief. It was a raw March day and they saw the sun rise, a dark and angry red, the color of blood fresh spilt in a silver dish, they thought, and shook their heads at the omen."" This style, combined with bleak photographs of crumbling castles and portraits of brooding men, creates an atmosphere of Manichaean struggle, of clashing absolutes in which Montrose carries the banner of the noble and the decent. One suspects, though, that the situation is more complicated, and the turbid political and religious currents of this struggle do not make her classifications of hero and villain easy to maintain. Even so, it is difficult to remain aloof to the tragedy that descends on this charismatic figure, and one finds oneself rooting for him almost as strongly as C. V. Wedgwood does. DOUGLAS A.

The idea is not to shock or titillate, but rather to reflect the nature of the agency's work. It investigates air, rail, marine, pipeline and major-highway accidents. Some of the images are familiar to most Americans -- like ones of the Challenger explosion and the Exxon Valdez oil spill. But there are pictures of less well-known disasters -- obscure bus roll-overs, sinking ships and train wrecks.

The ferries, all operated by Weehawken-based New York Waterway, offer what amount to five-minute getaway cruises on 87-foot boats that scoot across the water at top speeds of 18 knots. For those used to car and train tunnels, the view on the ride over is a revelation.

us,DIARY,"HEALTH CARE Who Can Heal New York? Here's the question: Is there a place in the brave new world of managed health care for municipal hospitals like New York's? Can they possibly survive? The answer, from a mayoral advisory panel, was a resounding no. The panel, saying the hospitals delivered inefficient, low-quality care, called last week for abolition of the whole system. The obvious question, from a 43-year-old Bellevue patient with AIDS, was this: ""Where will the poor people go for medical care?"" The mayor's panel, though, insisted that the poor will get better care at revamped hospitals or at private medical centers. LAWSUITS Promises, Costly Promises It happens all the time: some big company, on the prowl for bargain labor, closes one plant and opens another elsewhere. As long as it goes by the book and gives 60 days' notice, the company's nose is clean. Or so Maytag thought when, in 1991, it shut a vending-machine plant in West Virginia and opened one in South Carolina. Workers say Maytag assured them this would never happen, and the workers -- first one, then a class-action parade -- decided this was a legal promise and sued. And last week Maytag settled the case by agreeing to pay $16.5 million -- it was ""risk avoidance,"" mind you; the company remained pure as a new-laundered sheet. Lawyers, bless their billable souls, will devour $5 million of that, but that still leaves a tidy sum for 800 workers. ENTERTAINMENT Rocking Hollywood's Boat Think of Hollywood as a huge rowboat, managing a delicate balance even under its heavy load of ego and money -- mighty agents on one side, mighty studios on the other. Then, without warning, a giant among giants leaps from one side to the other, sending everyone else scampering for equilibrium. That's basically what happened last week when Michael Ovitz, agent to the gods and just about everyone else, decided that, well, working for a studio might not be that bad. MCA hadn't worked out, so the buzz (sorry, but Hollywoodspeak is de rigueur) was that nothing would shake him from Creative Artists. But then Disney came calling -- its new jewel, ABC, in hand -- and Mr. Ovitz couldn't resist, even though he'll play second fiddle to Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman. You can bet he'll be a loud second fiddle. GUIDING NATURE Writing E-Mail in the Sand Beaches are big business -- people go to unholy lengths to sit on them and fry, and pay unholy prices for shelter and hot dogs nearby. But only God can make a beach -- well, God and the Army Corps of Engineers. The big difference: when engineers do it, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And when God then washes away man's sand, there's hell to pay -- and more sand to cart in. Take, say, New Jersey. Man built beaches recently at vast expense -- Federal money that miraculously flowed freely -- but (of all the nerve!) water barged in and took much of it away. And so the debate heats up, with some insisting that, yes, man can shape the earth, but other heretical souls (they probably don't even like running barefoot on the sand) talking about pouring tax dollars into the ocean. REGULATION A Tobacco-Country Judge The battle is joined. The F.D.A. wants to regulate the sale and promotion of cigarettes -- because it wants fewer teen-agers to start smoking. The tobacco industry doesn't like that idea, possibly because if people don't get the habit young, they usually don't get it. So the industry sued, and by all signs got just the arbiter it would want last week -- a North Carolina judge who had ruled pro-tobacco in a suit involving the E.P.A. and had, as a lawyer, defended an R.J. Reynolds heir. Why North Carolina? It's ""the only jurisdiction that makes any sense,"" Reynolds said. But the head of an anti-smoking group said, ""Among Southern lawyers, it's called home cooking, helping out the friends and neighbors."" ROCKEFELLER CENTER What Price Location Now? What next? Just when you thought you'd figured out who owns Rockefeller Center -- no simple matter, in case you've missed it all; the overlapping trusts and groups and holding companies create a dazzling financial maze -- here come two more investors battling for a piece of it. First was Sam Zell of Chicago, who, like others drawn to the fabled towers, is all gaga about ""location, location, location,"" a rule he learned ""when my daddy put me on his knee."" (Well, at least his daddy didn't say, ""Plastics."") And the very next day this bankruptcy-smudged landmark got a rival offer, from Tishman Speyer Properties of New York. Don't even ask what the ownership chart might look like now; the family tree of British royalty is a sapling in comparison. THE FED A Rate Cut? Probably Not Oh, yes -- interest rates. Is the Federal Reserve going to give borrowers another break, as it did a month or so ago, when it cut rates slightly after that endless string of increases? The Fed gathers on Tuesday, but people who think they know such things expect no more rate cuts just yet. True, official rates still hover farther than usual above inflation -- which the Fed is slapping itself gleefully on the back for taming. But Fed officials seem to think things are going just fine, with a sharp rise in housing starts last week just the latest bit of strength. Or perhaps it's just too hot for them to think about anything so strenuous as tinkering with those all-powerful rates. Maybe in September. EQUALITY Women of Value Life is unfair: Any 12-year-old denied extra dessert or a new computer will tell you that. But for the world's women, life is truly unfair -- as a United Nations report out last week made vividly and statistically clear. Among the findings: 70 percent of the world's poor are women, and women hold just 14 percent of top managerial jobs. Not that women don't do their fair share of the world's work -- far from it. One of the study's more intriguing findings is the extreme economic undervaluation of women's work. They pull their weight; they just don't get paid for it. WORK FORCE Employees, by Another Name No one wants employees anymore. Employees want pesky things like health benefits. (Health benefits?) They want companies to be loyal to them. (A quaint idea.) You have to pay payroll taxes so they can get stuff like Social Security. It's all such a nuisance! More and more, companies prefer ""independent contractors"" -- not too independent, mind you -- and the ranks of such semi-employees have soared with all the layoffs lately. But there are rules about who can be called a contractor -- rules, no doubt, often stretched to, and past, the limit -- and last week Texas A&M University admitted that it had illegally paid 400 farm workers as contractors, cheating the Government out of $86,000 in payroll taxes. The Republicans, meanwhile, have a solution: they're pushing a bill that would liberalize the use of contractors.",1995-08-20T05:00:00+0000

us,F.Y.I.,"A Rat Revealed Q. Why is there a sculpture of a rat crawling up one of three wires that holds the awning over the Graybar Building entrance to Grand Central Terminal on Lexington Avenue? A. Good eye. That rat (above) is not easy to spot. The architects of the Graybar building, Sloan & Robertson, included three cast-iron Norway rats in the design for the building. The sculptures depict sharp conical baffles on the mooring lines of ships, which were intended to discourage rats from climbing aboard. One of the three rats was stolen, and the other is being used to fashion a replacement, said Patricia Raley of Metro-North Railroad, which manages the terminal. ""Billy's"" Bawdy Roots Q. On the southwest corner of Avenue of the Americas and 24th Street is Billy's Topless Dance Bar. Above the sign is a cement block in the building that says ""The Corner 6th Avenue."" On the other side one says ""The Corner 24th Street."" ""The Corner"" is also cut into the cornice. Was this the name of the building? A. This small red-brick building is all that remains of one of the most popular entertainment spots in the Gay 90's. Built in 1879, it was called ""The Corner"" and was the beer hall annex to Koster & Bial's Vaudeville Theater/Concert Hall, where Victor Herbert conducted his 40-piece orchestra. In ""City of Eros: New York City, Prostitution and the Commercialization of Sex, 1790-1920,"" (W.W. Norton & Company, 1992), the author, Timothy J. Gilfoyle, wrote: ""John Koster, the proprietor of the popular Koster and Bial's, admitted that were the law enforced (on prostitution) he saw no other way of doing business than to shut up at once."" In 1896, Koster & Bial did close and entered into a brief partnership with Oscar Hammerstein 2d at his 34th Street Manhattan Opera House (on the present site of Macy's). Milton Anthony, who runs Billy's Topless Bar, says he still considers the establishment ""The Corner"" only now, ""it's Billy's corner."" Name That Bridge Q. Q. How did the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge and the Throgs Neck Bridge get their names? A. The Bronx-Whitestone Bridge was so named because it connects the Bronx to the northern Queens neighborhood of Whitestone. More interesting, perhaps, is the origin of Whitestone. ""The Dutch discovered a white glacier boulder at the spot where the East River meets the Long Island sound hence the name,"" said Al Stern, a researcher at the Queens Historical Society. The Throgs Neck, which connects Throgs Neck in the Bronx to Beechurst and Bayside in Queens, was named for John Throckmorton, who settled in the Bronx in 1643, said Frank Pascual, of the M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels. ""Throgs is a contraction and neck is a small point that juts out into the water,"" he explained. MONIQUE P.

Not since 1984, when Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe seemed to own the sport, had two Americans been locked in such a furious competition for the top rung. Sampras and Agassi had each meticulously planned their schedules, therefore, to give them the ideal proportion of action and rest needed to peak at the year's four Grand Slam tournaments.

us,F.Y.I.,"A Rat Revealed Q. Why is there a sculpture of a rat crawling up one of three wires that holds the awning over the Graybar Building entrance to Grand Central Terminal on Lexington Avenue? A. Good eye. That rat (above) is not easy to spot. The architects of the Graybar building, Sloan & Robertson, included three cast-iron Norway rats in the design for the building. The sculptures depict sharp conical baffles on the mooring lines of ships, which were intended to discourage rats from climbing aboard. One of the three rats was stolen, and the other is being used to fashion a replacement, said Patricia Raley of Metro-North Railroad, which manages the terminal. ""Billy's"" Bawdy Roots Q. On the southwest corner of Avenue of the Americas and 24th Street is Billy's Topless Dance Bar. Above the sign is a cement block in the building that says ""The Corner 6th Avenue."" On the other side one says ""The Corner 24th Street."" ""The Corner"" is also cut into the cornice. Was this the name of the building? A. This small red-brick building is all that remains of one of the most popular entertainment spots in the Gay 90's. Built in 1879, it was called ""The Corner"" and was the beer hall annex to Koster & Bial's Vaudeville Theater/Concert Hall, where Victor Herbert conducted his 40-piece orchestra. In ""City of Eros: New York City, Prostitution and the Commercialization of Sex, 1790-1920,"" (W.W. Norton & Company, 1992), the author, Timothy J. Gilfoyle, wrote: ""John Koster, the proprietor of the popular Koster and Bial's, admitted that were the law enforced (on prostitution) he saw no other way of doing business than to shut up at once."" In 1896, Koster & Bial did close and entered into a brief partnership with Oscar Hammerstein 2d at his 34th Street Manhattan Opera House (on the present site of Macy's). Milton Anthony, who runs Billy's Topless Bar, says he still considers the establishment ""The Corner"" only now, ""it's Billy's corner."" Name That Bridge Q. Q. How did the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge and the Throgs Neck Bridge get their names? A. The Bronx-Whitestone Bridge was so named because it connects the Bronx to the northern Queens neighborhood of Whitestone. More interesting, perhaps, is the origin of Whitestone. ""The Dutch discovered a white glacier boulder at the spot where the East River meets the Long Island sound hence the name,"" said Al Stern, a researcher at the Queens Historical Society. The Throgs Neck, which connects Throgs Neck in the Bronx to Beechurst and Bayside in Queens, was named for John Throckmorton, who settled in the Bronx in 1643, said Frank Pascual, of the M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels. ""Throgs is a contraction and neck is a small point that juts out into the water,"" he explained. MONIQUE P.

A Life on the Wild Side","Lou Reed has influenced performers from David Bowie to the Talking Heads. Yet he remains a cult figure, not a superstar. In TRANSFORMER: The Lou Reed Story (Simon & Schuster, $25), Victor Bockris, who previously wrote biographies of Keith Richards and Andy Warhol, suggests that Mr. Reed has a love affair with self-destruction that has caused him to sabotage his chances for popular success. His middle-class Long Island upbringing, which included bouts of electroshock therapy to ""cure"" his homosexuality, left Mr. Reed with the desire to escape and become the hero of his own life, Mr. Bockris writes. In the 1960's and 70's Mr. Reed was a brutal but poetic chronicler of New York City's downtown street life, giving a desolate beauty to drug addicts, drag queens and hustlers but never romanticizing them. His band, the Velvet Underground, was seen by rock critics as a precursor to both glam rock and punk rock, and Mr. Bockris writes that Mr. Reed was happy to take credit for all of it; he even expelled his creative collaborator John Cale from the band. The autobiographical song ""Walk on the Wild Side"" brought Mr. Reed his only mainstream hit -- in the wake of which, Mr. Bockris says, he engaged in bouts of drug taking and doomed relationships with lovers of both sexes, alienating the record company that thought it could make him a star. ""Transformer,"" apparently written without Lou Reed's cooperation, depicts the singer's life as a series of death-defying second acts. The degree of detail is exhaustive and probably of little interest to anyone but a die-hard fan.LAUREN THIERRY",1995-08-27T05:00:00+0000

Reba McEntire has made some interesting things with her career and her life. And I am delighted to see Bonnie Raitt get the attention she's getting after all this time. But it's not fair to say there is anyone out there who does what I do. No one is really singing in my style, which is nice to know.

In the early-morning hours of Saturday, July 15, one of these fierce windstorms blew through Adirondack Park in upstate New York, where 5,000 people were camping. By dawn, four campers and a motorist were dead and more than 50 million trees were down. (Nary a metallic white pine among them.) A derecho (de-ray-cho) is a straight-line storm (unlike its similarly Spanish-named cousin, the tornado, which swirls), accompanied by rain, thunder and virtually nonstop lightning. Not since Hurricane Hazel of 1954 has the state park endured such devastation: nearly two million acres of damaged wilderness, some of it now extremely combustible. ""Imagine a group of thunderstorms going out for a family picnic,"" says Dick Westergard of the National Weather Service. With winds as high as 100 miles an hour and lightning flashing up to 50 times a minute, the park's Five Ponds Wilderness Area was the hardest hit. Ninety-two campers and canoeists had to be evacuated by helicopter or assisted out on foot. But no one was hurt there. ""It's a miracle,"" says Bernard Siskavich, a forest ranger.

us,F.Y.I.,"A Rat Revealed Q. Why is there a sculpture of a rat crawling up one of three wires that holds the awning over the Graybar Building entrance to Grand Central Terminal on Lexington Avenue? A. Good eye. That rat (above) is not easy to spot. The architects of the Graybar building, Sloan & Robertson, included three cast-iron Norway rats in the design for the building. The sculptures depict sharp conical baffles on the mooring lines of ships, which were intended to discourage rats from climbing aboard. One of the three rats was stolen, and the other is being used to fashion a replacement, said Patricia Raley of Metro-North Railroad, which manages the terminal. ""Billy's"" Bawdy Roots Q. On the southwest corner of Avenue of the Americas and 24th Street is Billy's Topless Dance Bar. Above the sign is a cement block in the building that says ""The Corner 6th Avenue."" On the other side one says ""The Corner 24th Street."" ""The Corner"" is also cut into the cornice. Was this the name of the building? A. This small red-brick building is all that remains of one of the most popular entertainment spots in the Gay 90's. Built in 1879, it was called ""The Corner"" and was the beer hall annex to Koster & Bial's Vaudeville Theater/Concert Hall, where Victor Herbert conducted his 40-piece orchestra. In ""City of Eros: New York City, Prostitution and the Commercialization of Sex, 1790-1920,"" (W.W. Norton & Company, 1992), the author, Timothy J. Gilfoyle, wrote: ""John Koster, the proprietor of the popular Koster and Bial's, admitted that were the law enforced (on prostitution) he saw no other way of doing business than to shut up at once."" In 1896, Koster & Bial did close and entered into a brief partnership with Oscar Hammerstein 2d at his 34th Street Manhattan Opera House (on the present site of Macy's). Milton Anthony, who runs Billy's Topless Bar, says he still considers the establishment ""The Corner"" only now, ""it's Billy's corner."" Name That Bridge Q. Q. How did the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge and the Throgs Neck Bridge get their names? A. The Bronx-Whitestone Bridge was so named because it connects the Bronx to the northern Queens neighborhood of Whitestone. More interesting, perhaps, is the origin of Whitestone. ""The Dutch discovered a white glacier boulder at the spot where the East River meets the Long Island sound hence the name,"" said Al Stern, a researcher at the Queens Historical Society. The Throgs Neck, which connects Throgs Neck in the Bronx to Beechurst and Bayside in Queens, was named for John Throckmorton, who settled in the Bronx in 1643, said Frank Pascual, of the M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels. ""Throgs is a contraction and neck is a small point that juts out into the water,"" he explained. MONIQUE P.

(You'd think even Bill Gates would admit it, too, but you never know with him.) Colored lights on the Empire State Building. Taking over a day's run of The Times of London. Hype. Balloons. Free pizza. An on-line party from Microsoft headquarters -- ""Lake Bill,"" to be exact. In all, a staggering $150 million global marketing campaign. Come on already! It's just some stuff you put in your computer. But guess what: the public lapped it up. People lined up to buy software when they should be sleeping, with a spokesman for Egghead stores saying all the to-do had ""created two Christmas seasons"" (a frightening thought). All this doesn't mean the Justice Department is easing up on the antitrust front. Janet Reno made a point of saying, on Windows 95 Day itself: ""The investigation continues."" TOBACCO Just Follow the Nicotine To make cigarettes, Philip Morris mixes crushed tobacco leaves and stems, and then adds back the lost nicotine. Is this ""spiking"" with nicotine, or ""recombining"" ingredients? This would seem mere semantics -- and a mere quibble, considering smoking's vast health toll. But the word ""spike,"" used by ABC News, set off a multi-zillion-dollar lawsuit -- one the industry and smoking foes were watching with care. Then last week, out of the blue, ABC put its tail between it legs and apologized -- on prime time, yet -- to Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds. But that isn't the end of it: Philip Morris filed a ton of documents in the case, and Representative Henry Waxman, a vocal tobacco foe, figures there's some damning stuff in those papers and asked that they be made public. TELEVISION A Network of His Own? Some people dream of vacation houses, new boats, more hair, writing a novel. Barry Diller's wish list is short and constant: for some reason, he wants his very own TV network, and isn't going to rest till he gets it. As head of QVC last year, he almost bought CBS. And last week he got control of Silver King Communications, which owns 12 UHF stations that could be the basis for a new network. He and Rupert Murdoch, after all, started Fox with a few stations, but the difference is that Mr. Diller will be relying on cable now. Given the spread of cable, that's no big obstacle, but is there room in a cluttered public mind for yet another network? GARMENT INDUSTRY Sweating It Out in California It's a familiar trend: under ferocious pressure from bargain-hunters, garment-making jobs are driven overseas. But some in the industry have found a way to essentially send jobs abroad but really keep them right in Southern California, an area decimated by lost aerospace jobs. The trick: bring in Asian workers illegally and put them to work in sweatshops. A raid last week -- the second this month -- found 56 illegal immigrants, mostly Thais, apparently recruited to sew garments headed for big department stores. And of course, like everything else these days -- including that headache you have -- it's Bill Clinton's fault. The Administration has ""allowed slavery to exist for years in the United States,"" said Gov. Pete Wilson of California. Mr. Wilson wants to be President. TECHNOLOGY What Next? E-Bananas? E-checks? Oh, why not. There's E-everything else. E-mail. E-speak. E-think. E-love (that has its limits). E-ads. So, yes, last week a group of banks and E-companies said they'd design an ""electronic check"" system, to begin tests next year. No, this isn't E-bill-paying, already offered by banks. These are real checks (well, as real as anything in computer never-never land) -- they can be sent for birthdays as well as doctors' bills, and can bounce as high as paper. There will be electronic checkbooks -- cards inserted into computer slots. And there will be security codes called ""digital signatures"" promising safety and security. (Right: like all the other ways we're promised privacy as more and more machines peek into our brains.) SECURITIES LAW Insider Trading, Redefined A quiz: A lottery director buys stock in a company, then gives that company a lucrative state contract. Is it insider trading? Not to a Federal appeals court, which recently threw out the securities-fraud conviction of the director, Elton Bryan of West Virginia. By this court's definition, only those who work for the target company in a takeover would be barred from trading; anyone else with the inside scoop could cash in. If this ruling becomes widely accepted, insider-trading cases could rapidly become rare. Not that Mr. Bryan rejoiced at the reversal: he was also convicted of perjury, mail fraud and wire fraud, and he's as much in jail as he ever was. INVESTING Those Manly Mutual Funds You know those mutual funds that, like Indiana Jones scouring the jungle for treasure, vow bold investments at the earth's far corners? Definite guy-type investments. Well, maybe all that overheated language gets funds a bit too excited. Some of them, it seems, threw money at a company that, on close inspection, might end up being fool's gold. Arakis Energy's promises were lavish -- a huge pipeline project in Sudan, a big investment from a Saudi prince -- and funds lapped it up, sending its market value above $500 million last month. (Not bad for a company with about $1 million in the till.) But that close inspection came last week, as regulators asked the Canadian company just what it was made of. Trading was halted, the stock was delisted in Vancouver, and Arakis said nothing to persuade Nasdaq to resume trading. THE NUMBERS An Economic Roller Coaster On Tuesday, the economy was fine. The proof: The Fed didn't ease up on interest rates. On Thursday, durable-goods orders plunged unexpectedly, and suddenly the economy was on the rocks.

Directed by Don Was in black and white, it depicts the journey of a childlike soul on the hazardous road of celebrity. Musicians ranging from Linda Ronstadt to John Cale comment on Mr. Wilson's phenomenal success as a songwriter, and on the influence of albums like ""Pet Sounds"" on rock music.

In summer the dowry of the world turns Day-Glo; what in autumn will be somber, hemstitched, restrained, in summer is silly, outre, a mess. The shy student who in October will wear a black beret enlivened by one small diamante pin in summer slouches slack-jawed by the water, wearing a hat the color of a tiger lily. To Henry Adams, writing about his boyhood in New England a century and a half ago, summer was drunken and winter was school. When I was a child my parents owned a bungalow in the woods with a view of a cove; when we arrived I would go around the back of the house and look for my reflection, 11 months older, in the kitchen window. The bayberry and scrub pine shone greenly through me so that I became, in the wavy kitchen glass, not a product of the heavy, ponderous year but a mirage, a figment of summer. For the last 15 or 20 years, through the Indian summer of adolescence, through marriage and motherhood, I have worn exactly the same clothes in August; paradoxically, it is the month in which I have thought most elaborately about clothes. In other months I have dressed like a mountaineer, like Hippolyta, like a French chambermaid, like a schoolboy, like Janis Joplin.
