This month in Paris, for the inauguration of its new home division, Maison, Herms is reintroducing these and other Frank pieces, including a straw-marquetry screen, a shagreen-covered vanity and the designers X-base dining table. Robert Chavez, the president and C.E.O. of Herms USA, sees a very exciting potential in the U.S. for the Jean-Michel Frank by Herms collection, given the customer demand for furniture with the Herms label. Previously, the companys furniture was limited to Pippa, a small collection by the architect Rena Dumas, who designed Herms stores and who was married to Jean-Louis Dumas, the chairman of Herms from 1978 to 2006. (Rena died in 2009, and Jean-Louis in May.) Their son, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the companys artistic director and a sixth-generation member of the founding Herms family, said starting Maison with historic designs was a deliberate strategy: We had to go backward to understand our roots and to go forward into the future. And in that future  April 2011, to be exact  the company will unveil further Maison collections, this time by a roster of (yet to be revealed) contemporary designers. ",2010-11-01T14:27:45+0000

us,Dexter Watch: A Lethal Bond,"We are midway through the current season of Dexter, and we can certainly see a glimpse of what is to come: Lumen and Dexter are soulmates, two people whose psychologies have been shaped almost entirely by extreme violence. The final scene with them in Ritas old bathroom perfectly evoked their like-mindedness and their potential for the kind of real connection that Dexter has never experienced. Yet it also revealed his totalizing fear of actually having that kind of bond.Michael C. Halls performance here was really powerful: his face seemed to quiver and his body to recoil without actually doing so, as Lumen outlined her biography  her fear of marriage and of stifling convention, her need to breathe and experience thrills in life beyond having the right kind of china. Of course, this terror of dull, suburban normalcy is exactly what keeps Dexter so restive. He saw himself with frightening clarity in Lumen and is clearly afraid of what it might mean that the fates have delivered to him a woman who would not only accept his proclivities but also share them.",2010-11-01T16:44:06+0000

The first episode of the show, which had the good fortune to make its debut on Halloween night at 10 P.M., was watched by 5.3 million people, AMC said, making it the largest audience for any original series on the channel. (By comparison, the season finale of the AMC drama Mad Men, on which the dead do not reawaken and are simply made fodder for black comedy, drew 2.44 million viewers.)

us,The Timing of Social Security,"Several readers have objected to my assertion, in todays column, that Social Security was passed amid strong economic growth, rather than at the bottom of a recession. After all, wasnt the program created during the Great Depression? So it was  but not, crucially, during F.D.R.s first year in office, 1933, when the unemployment rate crested at 25 percent and economic growth was nowhere to be seen. Instead, the program was signed into law in August 1935, by which point the jobless rate was down to 20 percent and falling and the economy was growing at a brisk 8.9 percent clip, after growing by over 10 percent in 1934. By way of contrast, Barack Obama signed the health care bill in March of 2010, when unemployment had barely ticked down from its Great Recession high and G.D.P. growth was still anemic  as, indeed, it remains to this day. Of course it goes without saying that the overall economic situation was worse in the Depression. But Roosevelt could legitimately claim that the country had turned the corner (and, just as importantly, that the 1934 midterms had confirmed his political mandate) by the time he turned from economic policy to old-age entitlements. Obama, on the other hand, got his entitlement passed in the first 15 months of his administration  but one of the (many) reasons its been a harder sell than Social Security, I suspect, is that the country is still waiting for real growth to return.",2010-11-01T19:42:14+0000

The contributions helped Republicans take over the Texas House in 2002, paving the way for the passage of a redistricting plan  designed by Mr. DeLay  that gave Republicans more control over the states Congressional delegation.

If youre like me, and dont know that you want to make bean stew until, well, the moment you want to make bean stew, then that eight-hour prep just isnt in the cards.That said, soaking beans overnight to soften them is really a great choice if youre the kind of person who knows what you will want for dinner tomorrow. The eight hours or so spent in the water drastically reduces the cooking time. This saves energy and gets your dinner on the table faster once you bring everything to a boil. So feel free to soak the beans for this recipe if youre so inclined. Just watch them carefully to see when they are done  probably in half the time it took me with unsoaked beans.Another issue that I briefly bring up in the column is refrigerating the beans while they soak. Years ago, I was taught that soaking beans might start to ferment if left in a very warm room overnight. Soaking in the fridge eliminates this concern. However, several readers have written to me saying that they never refrigerate their soaking beans and havent had any problems. One friend, from the Caribbean, said she always soaks her beans outside on the porch overnight in 80-degree weather, and that those beans seem to cook up perfectly well.Im curious to hear how you do it  do you soak at room temperature or in the fridge? What about quick soaking? Many readers use pressure cookers, so Im asking, do you soak if you use a pressure cooker? Leave a comment to share your leguminous adventures. ",2010-11-03T19:47:57+0000

When a page closes, you see an object kind of smush, and in that moment, its in a liminal state not unlike the Fold paintings, she says. Auerbach began collecting classic pop-ups like Alphabeta Concertina and Andy Warhols Index (Book) last year, and also began the process of making her own. To create [2,3]  which is being introduced this weekend by Printed Matter at the NY Art Book Fair  she spent months teaching herself how to construct complex geometric shapes from strips of paper, then several more creating templates and instructional videos so that the printer could reproduce them. Among the pieces are Cubearc (above), a delicate Mbius-like curl and Ziggurat: 10 nested tiers that telescope out to 18 inches high. I tried things that someone who had experience probably would have shied away from, says Auerbach, who insists that her goal wasnt to make the most complicated thing possible. It was just to make something beautiful and uncanny happen. ",2010-11-04T15:00:52+0000

I notice how many readers are relieved to see that there are shades of gray when it comes to the question whether morality requires God. I believe that such a discussion needs to revolve around both the distant past, in which religion likely played little or no role if we go back far enough, and modern times, in which it is hard to disentangle morality and religion. The latter point seemed obvious to me, yet proved controversial. Even though 90 percent of my text questions the religious origins of human morality, and wonders if we need a God to be good, it is the other 10 percent  in which I tentatively assign a role to religion  that drew most ire. Atheists, it seems (at least those who responded here) dont like any less than 100 percent agreement with their position.To have a productive debate, religion needs to recognize the power of the scientific method and the truths it has revealed, but its opponents need to recognize that one cannot simply dismiss a social phenomenon found in every major society. If humans are inherently religious, or at least show rituals related to the supernatural, there is a big question to be answered. The issue is not whether or not God exists  which I find to be a monumentally uninteresting question defined, as it is, by the narrow parameters of monotheism  but why humans universally feel the need for supernatural entities. Is this just to stay socially connected or does it also underpin morality? And if so, what will happen to morality in its absence?",2010-11-04T22:03:00+0000

Accordingly, Winger arrived prepared  not only with a list of questions and ideas about the role, but also with the names of several other performers the producers might want to pursue instead of her if she wasnt the right fit. I had in my head the names of five other actresses, she said, all of whom I thought would, in a way, be better. Its pretty amazing whos out there, not working.",2010-11-05T04:01:20+0000

It includes a gallery devoted to the subject of terroir, a commissioned wall work by Peter Wegner that charts more than 200 paint colors with names like Cabernet and Crush, and a look at, among other issues, the effect of architecture on wine tourism. The museum knows the subject well, having organized the first architectural competition for the design of a winery, in 1985.

The police said the suspect, whom they would not identify because he might be tried as a juvenile, uploaded three crude yet threatening videos onto YouTube. He also downloaded bomb-making manuals from the Internet, but was unable to make explosives because he did not have money for materials. In the videos, the man hid his face while claiming to speak on behalf of what he called the German mujahedeen. He demanded the release from prison of Daniel Schneider, the leader of the so-called Sauerland Cell, whose members were convicted in March 2010 for planning attacks on United States military installations in Germany. The police said that there was no evidence that the suspect was linked with Al Qaeda or any terrorist groups but that he had become a dangerous longer. ",2010-11-06T02:10:45+0000

But government officials said the courts action would not affect the governments plan to extradite the cleric to the United States, where he is wanted on terrorism charges. Officials in the office of Home Secretary Theresa May said no decision had been made on whether to appeal the immigration courts ruling to a higher British court. The immigration panel upheld the claim by lawyers for Mr. Hamza, 53, whose real name is Mostafa Kamel Mostafa, that losing the British citizenship he gained through marriage in 1986 would leave him stateless, because Egypts government has revoked his Egyptian citizenship. He has carried his fight to avoid extradition to the European Court of Human Rights. He is wanted in the United States, where he is accused in connection with a plot to establish a terrorism training camp in Oregon, and is alleged to have had a role in planning a terrorist ambush in Yemen in 1998 in which 16 foreign tourists, some of them Americans, were taken hostage.

us,France: Roma Expelled From Church," About 13 Roma were expelled Friday from a church just south of Paris, the third expulsion of Roma in the past few days. The 13, including two adolescents, had been in France for a decade and had been moved from a squat. They took refuge in the church of St.-Nicolas de St.-Maur-des-Fosss hoping for better lodging, but were removed after the priest there signed an expulsion order. On Wednesday, two encampments of Roma  one nearby at Crteil and the other in Lyon, were also emptied by the police. France was sharply criticized this summer for a more intense effort to expel Roma who are non-French and who overstay their three-month visa, and for breaking up illegal encampments of Roma and traveling people, including French citizens, who have been living on land not designated for them by municipalities. France says Romania and Bulgaria must do more to integrate their Roma citizens, and spend more of the money the European Union provides for that purpose. But the Roma say they are not wanted in Romania. ",2010-11-06T02:25:05+0000

That result is better than the opening for the studios hit How to Train Your Dragon, which sold $43.7 million in its first weekend, but lower than initial results for its pictures like Kung Fu Panda and Monsters vs. Aliens. In an unusual move Megamind, distributed by Paramount Pictures, saved a substantial part of its television marketing push to avoid competing with midterm election ads; 40 percent of the films TV advertising budget was spent over the past week. The comedy Due Date (Warner Brothers) was second, with a strong $33.5 million.

It will be the first performance by their group, Arts in the Armed Forces, since it gained nonprofit status in September. David Cromer will direct performances by actors including Eric Bogosian, Susan Sarandon, Dianne Wiest and Lauren Ambrose, among others, in honor of Veterans Day. Mr. Driver, a former Marine lance corporal, said by telephone on Sunday that the idea for the company came from a need that he and Ms. Tucker, whom he met while studying theater at Juilliard, noticed for more culturally diverse entertainment for the troops. We called U.S.O. events mandatory fun, Mr. Driver said of his time in the Marines, citing an event that included a skateboarding demonstration and a contest to win a date with a San Diego Chargers cheerleader. You couldnt help but feel marginalized. Now they hope their organization will encourage dialogue between artists and military members. In a place where emotions are not talked about, there seemed a need, Mr. Driver said. Putting words to feelings is a powerful thing, and theater was the best way for me to do that. The readings include works from the playwrights John Patrick Shanley, a former Marine who will introduce the evening, Charles Fuller (A Soldiers Play) and Stephen Adly Guirgis (The Little Flower of East Orange). Their plays have a grittier edge, Ms. Tucker said, but are not necessarily about the military. The program begins at 8 p.m.",2010-11-07T23:55:14+0000

While a lot has changed since 1952, Fire & Ice has a new shelf life now that Revlon has re-released three lip-and-tip pairings ($4.79  $ 8.99). The ad, shot by Mario Testino, restages the original, with a few notable exceptions  the actress Jessica Biel stands in for Leigh, ankle bracelets are so last century, and that dress is no knockoff.

Silk dresses, blouses, and meticulously adorned made-to-order lace and crystal evening gowns come out of a nostalgic art-nouveau atelier within the minimally decorated boutique. I am able to build more of a relationship with the Bellaish woman in an intimate salon, said the designer, who is known for being on-hand to personally fit every client. Maison Bellaish is home to the boundless woman. She doesnt need to be trendy because she knows a beautiful fabric and a great shape. ",2010-11-11T14:36:29+0000

But the impulse to attack, it must be recognized, was based on more than ideology; it also served important psychological imperatives. Not since Jimmy Carter handed the office to Ronald Reagan  arguably not since Herbert Hoover yielded to Franklin Roosevelt  had a president of one party bequeathed a successor from another party so utter an economic disaster as George W. Bush bequeathed to Barack Obama.

The term is generally used to describe urban neighborhoods where there are few grocers selling fresh produce, but a cornucopia of fast-food places and convenience stores selling salty snacks (though, strictly speaking, the term can be applied to rural or suburban areas, too). Often the problem afflicts low-income areas abandoned or shunned by food businesses that focus on better-off consumers; the residents of food deserts, apparently, are not providing enough profit to be offered more healthful grub. These are places where the market for nutritious sustenance has essentially failed.",2010-11-12T14:56:37+0000

Following an airplane trip from Philadelphia to Albuquerque, she had an edema in her legs that her internist attributed to long periods of sitting on planes. Initial tests revealed nothing unusual.

They both live with their childrens fathers, have adequate income, college education, power and advantage. The status they have achieved, regardless of how, is their common denominator. But at a time when Americas poor mothers are struggling to feed, educate and keep their children safe, sometimes without the support of a partner, being a mom elicits a whole different meaning for millions of women the article never mentions. Being a grizzly for them means fighting with the welfare folks who may have inadvertently canceled their food stamps; standing up to an absentee landlord when the heater breaks in the middle of winter; or figuring out how to manage a lottery system so her kid can get into the one decent magnet school in her city.",2010-11-12T15:10:29+0000

In seeking to argue that the publicity generated by the logo might be good for the companys sales, he cites a recent paper in Marketing Science that found that negative book reviews in The New York Times bolster obscure authors sales and hurt established authors sales. The bad publicity, the paper argues, serves to increase awareness of the book, which in turn fuels sales. Walkers analogy with the Gaps logo issues, however, is poor, and comparing apparel and books is a mismatched venture at best. In the analogy, Gap jeans are novels, but a more accurate publishing parallel would be an imprint redesigning its logo, something that most likely has never caused much of a stir outside of publishing house offices. Why? The Gap has builta brand on its logo, while books are judged one product at a time.

Im glad Appiah uses foot binding in China as his chief positive example of change rather than female genital cutting (F.G.C.)  not mutilation, as your subtitle suggests. I remember being in Kenya in 1980 when women from that country came back from the U.N. conference on the status of women in Copenhagen, angered by Western womens cultural insensitivity to what Kenyan (and other African) women viewed as their issue. Female circumcision is limited to northern Africa and along the eastern coast. It was rarely seen in central and southern Africa. It is time that The Times Magazine adopted the more appropriate term cutting, which both Appiah and Nicholas Kristof use in their articles, rather than the socially charged term mutilation.

Enough, in fact, to fill a store, which opened in the South End of Boston two weeks ago. Our collection had expanded into a lot of new categories, and we wanted a space where we could show everything together, explained Ross, referring to himself and his co-owner, Don Carney. We found an ideal space in the back of a brick-lined courtyard in our favorite Boston neighborhood, and it felt like a perfect location to create a Patch NYC world. That world includes the companys jewelry, scarves, candles and pillows, along with original art by Carney, who hails from Boston. Also in the mix are a selection of porcelain from the Brooklyn-based designers Klein Reid, ceramic sculptures by the Boston-based artist Steve Murphy and vintage decorative objects and Indian textiles.

us,A Good Day to Die,"In the Indian wars of the 1870s, Sioux tribesmen used a tactic against the United States Cavalry known as a brave run or a dare ride. An Indian warrior would gallop close to the American soldiers, drawing their fire. The purpose was partly practical  to get the soldiers to waste their ammunition  and partly psychological  to taunt. The Sioux sometimes showed their contempt for their enemies by appearing naked or nearly so, displaying their genitals and buttocks. Then the Indians would close in. Soldiers always tried to keep an enemy at bay, to kill him at a distance, Thomas Powers writes in The Killing of Crazy Horse, his richly textured account of clashing civilizations on the Great Plains during the late 19th century. The instinct of Sioux fighters was for exactly the opposite: to charge in and touch the enemy with a quirt, bow or naked hand while he was still alive. There is no terror in battle to equal physical contact  shouting, hot breath, the grip of a hand from a man close enough to smell. The whites were repulsed by the smell of Indians  an odor resembling a mixture of smoked beef, muskrat and polecat, according to a correspondent for Frank Leslies Illustrated Weekly quoted by Powers; a pungent, musty odor something like that of combined smoke and grease, Lt. William Philo Clark, a cavalry officer, wrote. For the Sioux who wanted nothing to do with whites, visceral differences like smell were only the beginning, Powers writes. The Indians particularly resented white treatment of Indian women. Many whites beat or abused Indian women, exploited them sexually after capture in battle, and sometimes bought them for cheap trinkets and liquor and later cast them aside.",2010-11-12T17:58:06+0000
us,The Hipster in the Mirror,"A year ago, my colleagues and I started to investigate the contemporary hipster. What was the hipster, and what did it mean to be one? It was a puzzle. No one, it seemed, thought of himself as a hipster, and when someone called you a hipster, the term was an insult. Paradoxically, those who used the insult were themselves often said to resemble hipsters  they wore the skinny jeans and big eyeglasses, gathered in tiny enclaves in big cities, and looked down on mainstream fashions and tourists. Most puzzling was how rattled sensible, down-to-earth people became when we posed hipster-themed questions. When we announced a public debate on hipsterism, I received e-mail messages both furious and plaintive. Normally inquisitive people protested that there could be no answer and no definition. Maybe hipsters didnt exist! The responses were more impassioned than those wed had in our discussions on health care, young conservatives and feminism.

For example, if a team had a payroll of $256 billion dollars against a luxury tax threshold of $40 billion, and one of their players was earning $220 billion alone, using the amnesty clause on that player would then put that team under the luxury tax threshold (as their payroll for luxury tax purposes was now considered to be only $36 billion).

The statement, published in English, came after lawmakers in California and Florida moved to block the S.N.C.F. from winning contracts for high-speed rail projects in their states if it did not recognize its role in the Holocaust. From 1941 to 1944, the S.N.C.F. shipped 76,000 French and other European Jews to the French-German border in 76 railcars originally designed for cattle.

In its draft report last week it recommended that the Smithsonians federal appropriation be cut by $225 million, or roughly 30 percent, and that the institution make up the loss by charging a $7.50 admission fee. The Smithsonians spokeswoman, Linda St. Thomas, said by telephone that the Smithsonian had studied the idea of charging admission several times in recent decades and rejected it. The regents have said repeatedly we dont want to charge admission because it then makes it difficult for all people to come and visit the collections, which in theory are held in trust for the American people, Ms. St. Thomas said.

us,Phys Ed: The Workout Enigma,"Recently, researchers in Finland made the discovery that some peoples bodies do not respond as expected to weight training, others dont respond to endurance exercise and, in some lamentable cases, some dont respond to either. In other words, there are those who just do not become fitter or stronger, no matter what exercise they undertake. To reach this conclusion, the researchers enrolled 175 sedentary adults in a 21-week exercise program. Some lifted weights twice a week. Others jogged or walked. Some did both. Before and after the program, the volunteers fitness and muscular strength were assessed. At the end of the 21 weeks, the results, published earlier this year in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, were mixed. In the combined strength-and-endurance-exercise program, the volunteers physiological improvement ranged from a negative 8 percent (meaning they became 8 percent less fit) to a positive 42 percent. The results were similar in the groups that undertook only strength or only endurance training. Some improved their strength enormously, some not at all. Others became aerobically fitter but not stronger, while still others showed no improvements in either area. Only a fortunate few became both fitter and more buff. As the researchers from the University of Jyvaskyla wrote with some understatement, large individual differences exist in the responses to both endurance and strength training.",2010-11-17T05:01:09+0000

But the president, Viktor F. Yanukovich, who was elected this year, ousted Mr. Chernovetsky as head of the citys administration and appointed a senior municipal official, Oleksandr Popov, to succeed him.

No one in the Ampatuan family, long a dominant political force in Maguindanao Province, was charged in the older killings, whose victims included political opponents and their relatives, public officials, people whose land the family wanted, and members of the Ampatuans own organization who disobeyed orders, the report said. Andal Ampatuan Jr., son of the family patriarch, is on trial for the Nov. 23, 2009, killings in Maguindanao, whose 57 victims included about 30 journalists and media support staff members who were with a group of people on their way to file candidacy papers for a political rival of Mr. Ampatuan.

The diplomatic officer was struck in the head as he tried to intervene. A French official, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with government policy, said the Iranian authorities had in recent weeks asked that foreign embassies and missions in Tehran inform them of any cultural events they intend to hold, a request with which the French have complied.

Like much of her recent life, Palins day had been replete with reminders of the clout she had rapidly acquired. She had spent most of her time ensconced at the Fox television studios, though she managed to squeeze in a jog in Central Park  which she promptly chronicled on Twitter: Beautiful! Also at the studios was her fellow Fox News contributor Karl Rove, who had recently questioned in a British newspaper whether Palins new reality TV series, Sarah Palins Alaska, made her appear Oval Office-worthy. The building was abuzz over what would ensue when the two would inevitably bump into each other. The moment came after Palin finished a segment with the anchor Bret Baier and saw Rove lingering stageside with Brit Hume, a Fox colleague, holding a well-marked copy of Alaska for Dummies  a prop clearly intended to mollify Palin. She laughed, used her phones camera to take a picture of Rove with the book, traded brief hellos and then left the studio without mentioning Roves earlier comment.",2010-11-17T10:00:16+0000

The eggs were full of spinach with a flicker of nutmeg, and the bacon was roasted in the oven, just before the crisp went in. This was bacon from real pigs, old-fashioned pigs, and a pound gave off nearly a cup of grease, for which I said silent thanks. I poured it off into a dish, where it now sits in the refrigerator, white and waxy, until I call it up for corn bread. But I didnt wash the hotel pan I used because I thought it would come in handy for something. And it did when I found some glossy hake fillets for dinner. The oven went on low, the hotel pan went into the 325-degree heat just long enough to melt the bacon grease, the hake was swiped on each side in the slick of fat before going into the oven and 12 minutes later we were all eating bacon fish.

The attack appeared to be similar to one earlier this month in which another leader of the group, Muhammad al-Nemnem, was killed. The Israeli military said that Mr. Yassin and Mr. Nemnem had been planning an attack involving the kidnapping of Israelis in the Sinai in Egypt. In 2006, the Army of Islam joined Hamas, which now controls Gaza, in capturing an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, from an army base near the enclave.

The compensation payments were explained in Parliament as part of a government plan to free MI5 and MI6 from the threat of extended litigation, and to protect relations between the British intelligence agencies and their American counterparts. Jonathan Evans, MI5s director general, said in a statement that he was delighted with the decision not to prosecute the unnamed MI5 official.

When Leach discovered his series Stalking Paris, she says, she was struck by the mood of the photos, which dovetailed nicely with her aesthetic for Chance  a mix of classic design and modern graphics. Instead of showing the typical touristy side of Paris, Schecter created an almost abstract view of the city he photographed people walking with umbrellas from above, the shadows of chairs in the Luxembourg Gardens and the Eiffel Tower in a layer of mist. His photos capture a Paris thats not a postcard-perfect city, says Leach, who served as the longtime creative director for Kate Spade.

Almost everything except the essential has been done away with, leaving one with the vision of a Giacometti). The story was published on April 8, 1974, when Beattie was 26 years old.

We had to stop sending people on trips to the waterfall for months until things settled down, says Claude Graves, one of three Westerners living permanently on the island.

Ohio State has just one blemish on its record  a loss to Wisconsin  but it still has its eye on the Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl berth. The Buckeyes will need to win out, starting Saturday at Iowa, and get some help from the Badgers, but the goal is still a realistic one. Virginia Tech  which began the season with two losses, including an embarrassing defeat at the hands of James Madison  has won eight in a row and has its sights set on the A.C.C. title. Miami would love to give the Hokies their first conference loss. Nebraska is kicking itself for the egg it laid against Texas. If not for that, the Cornhuskers would be in the middle of the race for the national title. As it is, they will travel to College Station on Saturday to take on Texas A&M, which has won four in a row. Neither Arkansas nor Mississippi State is going to win the SEC, but both teams have enjoyed successful seasons. A win over the Razorbacks would get the Bulldogs to eight victories in their second year under Coach Dan Mullen. And, finally, there is Southern California, all but forgotten in the wake of the N.C.A.A. sanctions that followed the Reggie Bush mess. But Lane Kiffin has had the Trojans playing well of late.

us,Now Showing | Ann Agee,"Ann Agee: Rules of the Pattern, at the Locks Gallery in Philadelphia until Dec. 30, offers a look at recent work by the artist, who is known for her playful, subversive treatment of traditional decorative porcelain archetypes, like blue-and-white patterns (which she has applied to ceramic sex toys, or an entire bathroom) or 18th century figurines (which she re-imagines in contemporary clothing, doing things like carrying shopping bags). In this show, Agee continues to give domesticity her own spin, in hand-painted and stenciled, large-scale wallpaper drawings that depict idealized interiors, and which allude to models as diverse as 19th century scenic wallpaper, Matisses The Dessert: Harmony in Red, and the spaces depicted in Roy Lichtensteins paintings. Along with a display of intricate white porcelain vases, the exhibition includes three works that are groups of hand-made porcelain platters and bowls arranged on a steel armature. Traditional pieces like this are decorated with floral patterns or pastoral scenes, but Agees depict modest domestic interiors, including everyday items like washing machines and stoves.",2010-11-19T22:45:38+0000

Physical labor, the researchers concluded, with its hours of lifting and moving heavy weights, had stunted the childrens growth. Somewhat improbably, from that scientific finding and other similar reports, as well as from anecdotes and accreting myth, many people came to believe that children and adolescents should not practice weight training, said Avery Faigenbaum, a professor of exercise science at the College of New Jersey. That idea retains a sturdy hold in the popular imagination. As a recent position paper on the topic of children and resistance training points out, many parents, coaches and pediatricians remain convinced that weight training by children will result in short stature, epiphyseal plate  or growth plate  damage, lack of strength increases due to a lack of testosterone and a variety of safety issues.",2010-11-24T05:01:06+0000

For their part, the architects were intrigued by the idea of tackling a subject thats not traditional museum fare. Elizabeth Diller, one of the firms partners, said, Certain aspects of the story of wines transformation were more obvious  the branding of wineries with star architecture, design of stemware, labels, etc.  while it was less apparent how to present the experiential aspects of wine.",2010-11-24T17:30:49+0000

The decision to halt the project was prompted by a report on the museums finances issued by Moodys Investors Services last week. The report showed that while the museum retained its A2 investment rating, considered a good credit risk, on its $383 million in construction bonds, a negative rating was expected in the future should it be unable to maintain a certain degree of liquidity. Construction costs and a drop in private donations during the recession have both taken a toll. The museum is hoping to raise an additional $100 million in donations before continuing work. Under Phase 1 the Broad Contemporary Art Museum and the BP Grand Entrance were opened in 2008 and the Resnick Exhibition Pavilion in September.

us,Letters: Lives,"I was deeply touched by Frederick Woolvertons disclosure of being the most-hated son and having testified at his 10-year-old sisters custody trial. He talked about the horrors of living with his alcoholic mother and the culture of fear that permeated the existence of his siblings. Until this reading I had not ever heard of another situation similar to my own. I testified at a custody trial at age 12 along with two other siblings, to choose which parent with which to spend the rest of my childhood. Fifty years later, we remain puzzled at the estrangements and disconnections from one another. This pivotal stage of court appearances changed much in our lives and ultimately, I believe, drove my brothers and sister and I apart. Not fully understanding why, I think Woolverton touched on issues that I can now reflect on, shake out and perhaps present to willing family members. Thanks to this article, my family might be willing to take another look at a time that weve all tried in our own ways to bury. Dianne Murphey Keystone Heights, Fl.I thank Frederick Woolverton for his Lives essay and The Times Magazine for publishing it. In a world with so much hurt and where many parent-child relationships are complicated by addiction, Woolverton is able to transcend his own past and be kind to his mother (and as a mental-health professional, help others with addiction). Although the author doesnt believe that he forgives his mother, his treatment of her shows that at least part of him has forgiven  even if he will never forget.Betsy Garman Washington I was touched by Frederick Woolvertons desire to reconcile with his elderly mother. Most of us understand his desire for closure, made more pressing by his mothers age and frailty, though many would not share his ability to be so gracious in that situation. But it troubled me to read of his decision to visit his nursing-home-bound mother unannounced, since she couldnt communicate and could no longer refuse me. The nursing-home culture change movement teaches us to respect individuals autonomy, however we feel about their choices. A broken relationship between mother and son is an extreme example of a choice; but it is, nonetheless, a choice. No matter her past behavior, Woolvertons mother became the vulnerable one in their relationship. Rosa BaierProvidence, R.I.",2010-11-26T14:07:32+0000

(Antibiotics do not work against viruses.) This overuse leads to antibiotic resistance, a dangerous and very real phenomenon. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has been trying for years to educate the public and physicians about the risks of misusing antibiotics. Antibiotics are a nonrenewable resource: for this reason and others, they are not available over-the-counter in our country. In many South American countries like Peru, antibiotics are available over-the-counter, contributing to widespread resistance in these countries. Doctors that prescribe antibiotics only when really indicated  anti-antibiotics doctors, in Cohens words  are actually the ones helping the most to keep these wonder drugs effective when they are really needed.",2010-11-26T14:07:35+0000

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (Warner Brothers) was No. 1 at the North American box office for a second week, selling about $76 million in tickets over the five-day holiday period for a new domestic total of $220 million. Tangled (Walt Disney Studios) sold about $69 million, validating Disneys controversial decision to play down this films musical and princess elements in marketing materials; strong reviews and premium-priced 3-D screenings also helped. DreamWorks Animations Megamind (distributed by Paramount) was third with $17.6 million for a new total of $130.5 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. Burlesque, a musical starring Cher and Christina Aguilera that Sony Pictures Entertainment backed with a hefty marketing campaign, was fourth with about $17 million. Denzel Washingtons runaway-train thriller, Unstoppable (20th Century Fox), took fifth place in its third week with about $16 million for a total of over $60 million. Opening out of the Top 5 were Love & Other Drugs, a romantic comedy from 20th Century Fox starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway that took in $14 million, and Faster, a thriller from CBS Films and Sony that had about $12 million in sales.

The institute aims to provide high-quality, dance-specific health care and dance science support services equal to those offered to elite athletes. When you look at squash, football and rugby, if you apply the same definition of injury to those other populations, dancers get injured much more, and we are just not doing enough, not just in this country but worldwide, said Emma Redding, head of dance science at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. Dance UK, a dancer advocacy organization, will work with organizations including Trinity, the Birmingham Royal Ballets Jerwood Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Dance Injuries and the University of Wolverhampton to form a network that will collectively make up the institute. Its first project will be a two-year, real-time study of the health of working professional dancers. This is significant, Ms. Redding said, because the only research that has ever been done on injuries has been retrospective. Guy Dagger, the managing director of British Harlequin, said he hoped its donation would encourage other companies to contribute.",2010-11-28T22:32:16+0000

The shows maiden performances have drawn comment since the creators are still working on technical sequences; at the first preview the show had to stop five times to deal with glitches. That shaky performance came as some theater producers said that Foxwoods Theater, the landlord for Spider-Man, had inquired whether they had shows in the works that might be fits for the theater. Late on Monday the theaters general manager, Erich Jungwirth, said in a statement that he had indeed talked to producers to see if there are any shows coming up that may be able to play in our venue. Such conversations are customary, Mr. Jungwirth said. The producers found the outreach unusual because it came when Spider-Man was already delaying its first preview by two weeks and involved a theater with a $65 million show that needs a multiyear run to turn a profit.
