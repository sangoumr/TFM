us,Screen: Rossellini's Teaching Film 'Blaise Pascal':Coffeehouse Concert March 16 An Extraordinary Mind,"""BLAISE PASCAL,"" which opens today at the Public Theater, is the seventh in the late Roberto Rossellini's series of so-called ""teaching films"" to open here, following ""The Rise of Louis XIV,"" ""Socrates,"" ""Augustine of Hippo"" and the three films that have the collective title ""The Age of the Medicis.""Pascal (1623-62), the French scientist and moralist, whose writings in defense of a Jansenism besieged by the Jesuits defined a new French prose style, is probably the least dramatic of the subjects whose lives Rossellini has studied in these earnestly inquiring films. Perhaps because of that, ""Blaise Pascal"" is so engrossing and, finally, so moving. There is nothing of an even remotely melodramatic nature to come between us and the inventory of Pascal's short lifetime of feverish intellectual activity.Pierre Arditi plays Pascal from the age of 16, when the family moved to Rouen from Paris, until his death at 39. In a succession of short, deceptively simple-looking and information-packed vignettes, Rossellini manages to convey the magnificent restlessness, the discipline and the power of Pascal's extraordinary mind. He brought to religious philosophy the same common sense he brought to science, and to science the same intuition he brought to his faith in God.We are on hand when the young Pascal invents what seems to have been the world's first mechanical calculator, debates the nature of vacuums, explains the workings of his barometer, sends off an essay on conics to his confounded elders in Paris. We also see the first Paris streetcar (between the Louvre and Vincennes), apparently another Pascal work and something that I, for one, had never known about.The style of the film is simple but not austere. The performers put themselves entirely at the service of the material. Atmosphere is secondary to ideas. As always, Rossellini leaves us wanting more, which is the plain, unexpected secret of the success of these movies.The Snug Harbor Cultural Center in Staten Island will present its first Coffeehouse Concert on March 16 at 3 P.M. Prairie Smoke, a three-member folk group, will perform a program of Irish tunes and mountain reels in honor of St. Patrick's Day.Table seating will be offered, with a menu of home-baked breads, tea and coffee. The cultural center is at 914 Richmond Terrace. Tickets: $2; $1.50 for members. Information: 448-2500.",1980-03-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: A Punk Bunch in 'Offenders':A Gang of Hoodlums,"A FILM like ""The Offenders"" is probably easier to appreciate from afar than it is to sit through. For one thing, there aren't films like ""The Offenders,"" or at least there aren't many of them  this is billed as a ""punk melodrama,"" and that makes it a trailblazer in a genre that could prove to be short-lived. Punk humor, as demonstrated here, is a little too self-congratulatory to sustain a feature film.""The Offenders,"" written and directed by Scott B and Beth B, was originally conceived as a serial and shown at Max's Kansas City. It may have played better under those circumstances than it will at the Film Forum, where it opens this evening. The film's most interesting moments don't have a great deal to do with one another, so showing the material in installments can't have done it much harm.""The Offenders"" was shot in super-8 mm. and looks like a home movie, although your Uncle Morty probably has a greater proficiency in this area than the B's do. It's out of focus and hard to hear, as it tells the story of Dr. Moore, his kidnapped daughter, Laura, and a gang of hoodlums who at one point steal a hand right off its owner. The hoods are dressed in high punk style, and a lot of their dialogue is amusingly deadpan  the best thing about ""The Offenders"" is its screenplay. ""I ran naked halfway across Cleveland  but I was young then,"" says Laura, at the end of a long monologue about how she once chewed her way out of a padded cell. The brand of comedy of the B's is highly specialized, but they approach it with a certain amount of flair.The players are mostly either rank amateurs or ""found"" talent, depending on how seriously you care to take the whole undertaking. A few of them, notably Adele Bertei, who plays Laura, seem capable of real acting, although ""The Offenders"" doesn't require anything of the kind. Rather, it employs the leaden monotone, the blank stare, the air of absolute boredom to construct a surprisingly lively scenario, given the ingredients. ""So what are you, the kind of girl who always hangs around in vacant buildings?"" somebody inquires. That's a line to remember.",1980-03-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Wambaugh's 'Black Marble':Cops' Love Story,"SERGEANTS A. M. Valnikov and Natalie Zimmerman are Los Angeles city police detectives and, as written by Joseph Wambaugh and played by Robert Foxworth and Paula Prentiss, they are two of the most unexpectedly appealing characters to be seen in any contemporary movie, though it takes a while to get their measure.Valnikov, a police department veteran due for retirement soon, goes through his days with terrible hangovers that give him the appearance of someone walking underwater. He is painfully polite, as if to ward off any kind of confrontation that would create a noise. When his wife walked out on him some years before, taking their son with her, she told Valnikov that he was boring and, worse, out of date, and he seems to have believed her.Valnikov is still a physically strong man but he is an emotional wreck. Alone at night in the apartment he shares with a gerbil and a parakeet, he has nightmares. When he drinks, which is often, he listens to sentimental gypsy music that recalls his White Russian heritage and a world he could never have known. ""My parents didn't come here for a better life,"" he says with a hopelessness that, in California, is both out of date and out of place, ""they left all that behind them.""At the beginning of ""The Black Marble,"" directed by Harold Becker and adapted by Mr. Wambaugh from his own novel, Valnikov is a likely candidate for Skid Row in the 80's. As discreetly as possible, he is withdrawing from life, which he would continue to do were it not for a kidnapped show dog, the show dog's weepy owner who gains Valnikov's sympathy, and especially for Natalie Zimmerman, who is appalled by Valnikov's soft heart. As Natalie says more than once, she would never run into a burning house to save a bowl of goldfish.Clearly Valnikov is not the sort of officer to be paired with Natalie Zimmerman, a tall, good-looking, tough-talking policewoman who has no patience with a man who drinks too much and who, as she notices, does his tailoring with a staple gun. Natalie, who's also divorced and has a daughter in college, talks like someone who's read a lot of self-help books. She's worked too hard to put her life in order to allow some rummy, over-the-hill cop to mess things up by reintroducing her to an uncertain future.This is pretty much what happens in ""The Black Marble,"" a peculiarly endearing comedy that is hopelessly romantic and bluntly crude. Rather like Valnikov on a binge, the movie sort of lurches along with great good will and an immense desire to please, acknowledging but not being thrown off by urban corruption and craziness  the Big City's distress signals  that surround Valnikov and Natalie from the day of their first assignment until, reluctantly, they fall in love.Largely because of the performances, I think, ""The Black Marble"" is far more entertaining as a movie than as a book. Mr. Wambaugh (""The Onion Field,"" ""The Choirboys,"" etc.) is better describing characters  how they look and talk  than he is analyzing them.Mr. Foxworth, who was most recently seen in the best forgotten ""Prophecy,"" is excellent as the exhausted Valnikov. It's a funny, humane, complex role of a sort that doesn't come along very often. As a pragmatic woman struggling to keep her sanity in a world full of eccentrics, some less dangerous than others, Miss Prentiss is a model of sweetly furious desperation and incredulity. They are very good company.Heading the fine supporting cast is Harry Dean Stanton, who appears as Philo Skinner, a handler of show dogs, a seedy, psychotic, serio-comic villain whose one attempt at extortion ends badly for everyone except Valnikov and Natalie. Equally good is Barbara Babcock, who plays the poor but proud society woman whose dog becomes Philo's unfortunate victim. It's one indication of the surprising way in which ""The Black Marble"" works  and how able the actors are  that a scene in which this woman laments the loss of her dog is neither funny at her expense nor cruel.""The Black Marble,"" which opens today at Loew's Astor Plaza and other theaters, is not without its flaws. Its shifts in moods are sometimes uncertain. There are times it seems to want to shock. We're also given a long psychiatric profile of Valnikov  via almost subliminal flashbacks and long speeches of exposition  that is facile as well as unnecessary in a movie so rich in observable detail.Novels exist in a simultaneous past, present and future; movies take place in a continuous present. When a movie is as solidly based in character as ""The Black Marble"" is, there's no need to inventory a past that becomes implicit in every moment of the present. That's an achievement of Mr. Wambaugh's script and Mr. Becker's direction of it.""The Black Marble,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), includes some vulgar language and some brief but graphic scenes of violence.",1980-03-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Sissy Spacek in 'Coal Miner's Daughter':The Song of a Singer,"THE obligatory scene in which the musician first performs in front of an audience: that's one of the many things that ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" which opens today at the Rivoli, handles beautifully. Loretta Lynn, played with captivating daintiness by Sissy Spacek, climbs onto the stage at a Grange hall, at the urging of her husband. Her singing is wispy at first, but it grows clear and confident as she takes command of the stage. By the end of the number, she has found her footing and launched her career.The audience is enthusiastic, but not so rapt as to make the scene unbelievable: there's a little less rustling in the crowd than there has been, and a few people begin gazing at the singer. That's all  that's enough. The point has been made, with the gentle touch that gives this movie its distinctive sweetness. ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" risks understating its story to make Loretta Lynn's biography part of a larger fabric, and the gamble pays off.Most of the film, the best part of it, depicts the world Miss Lynn grew up in, the world she both immortalized and lost when she became famous as a country music star. She grew up in Butcher Holler, Kentucky, a tiny place that has been faithfully reconstructed for the film, since Miss Lynn's fans have changed the real Butcher Holler from an unspoiled spot into a tourist attraction. She married at 13, and by 20 had four children. Neither her father nor her husband had much money, but poverty doesn't seem to have put her at any disadvantage. Her autobiography, upon which the movie is based, describes these early years as peaceful and uncomplicated, far more so than the times that followed.This part of Miss Lynn's life has been preserved in the emphatic, folksy lyrics of her songs, and some of the movie's dialogue has that same homespun sound. ""You're my pride, girl  my shining pride,"" says Loretta's father, and, amazingly, the line isn't forced. ""You'll just have to make up your mind, darlin', whether you're his daughter or my wife,"" says her husband, voicing another sentiment straight out of a song. Perhaps because Loretta doesn't answer these statements, or even ponder them unduly, the first part of the film takes place in the realm of clear choices and simple delights. The director, Michael Apted, sets this tone so effortlessly that it's hardly noticeable  until, in the second half of the movie, it disappears.Eventually, Miss Lynn's story moves her out of this fairy-tale world and into show business. And once she becomes a success, the old values suddenly aren't much help to her any more. This is a transition that the movie can't manage. Perhaps it should have ended at the Grand Ole Opry, where Loretta's dream is realized and her fate is sealed.Instead, the film skims over her more recent history with a protective air, never making the big star as vivid as the little girl has been. The problem isn't simply one of candor (although Miss Lynn's book is considerably franker than the movie about what a strain her success has been). It's a matter of context. Loretta starts out as a tiny figure in the Kentucky landscape, one of many different elements in this story. The film wrenches her away, and carries her off to a new setting that is far less complete, and less compelling.Throughout the film, she searches for a home. Though the point is never stated, her elaborate Tennessee mansion looks like a strangely insubstantial version of the Kentucky cabin. At her father's grave  which her husband drives up to, appropriately, in a bulldozer  Loretta cries ""I ain't gonna have no home now."" ""You got our home,"" the husband says, meaning to be soothing, but Loretta just weeps all the more. Mr. Apted presents some particularly delicate images to capture Loretta's uprootedness, as in a tableau of the singer, her husband and their four small children. The pose recalls Loretta and her siblings in Appalachia  but this time, the family is reflected in the glass window of a recording studio.""Coal Miner's Daughter"" features four extraordinary performances, each of them somewhat unexpected. Miss Spacek is luminous and lovely, easily outshining her previous work, as good as it has been. Even in the latter parts of ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" in scenes that may strike some viewers as a pale reminder of ""Nashville,"" she holds her own. Tommy Lee Jones, as her husband, Doolittle, has a strength and humor that bring the film's love story to life, and he, too, quite outdoes his past performances. Beverly D'Angeio, who as Patsy Cline does her own singing (Miss Spacek sings too, very nicely), makes a brief but astonishingly sharp impression. And Levon Helm, playing Loretta's father, embodies all the quiet decency that gives this film its foothold. Mr. Helm was formerly a member of the Band, and he's at least as good an actor as he was a singer and drummer, which is saying quite a lot.Like ""Agatha"" and the rock drama ""Stardust,"" other movies of Mr. Apted's, ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" does a better job of setting its scenes than of telling a story. Its characterizations and its atmosphere work better than the action, which becomes shapeless and, in the manner of biographies of living subjects, slightly cramped by its good intentions.""Coal Miner's Daughter"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains some harsh language, one violent episode and a few sexual references.",1980-03-07T05:00:00+0000

us,A Documentary: 'Trials of Alger Hiss':The Program,"As the two 1949 perjury trials of Alger Hiss recede more deeply into the past, the possibility for the layman ever to get a firm grip on the guilt or innocence of the people involved seems to become increasingly remote. If lawyers and historians who've studied the case cannot agree, what hope is their for the rest of us who yearn for absolutes but won't take the time to seek them?New evidence  some of it shocking  continues to accumulate, mostly because of the Freedom of Information Act. The dust will not settle on the case, but then the dust never really does settle except in a hermetically sealed tomb. Yet the further we are removed in time, the easier it is to see the political, social and psychological shapes of the events that led up to those two tumultuous trials, to Mr. Hiss's conviction at the second trial (the first ended in a hung jury), to his imprisonment and, finally, to his continuing struggle to clear his name.These things are the real subjects of John Lowenthal's fascinating, rueful, epic documentary ""The Trials of Alger Hiss,"" a movie that, I suspect, will not change any minds already made up but that meticulously recalls the era in which such confrontations became not only possible, but also inevitable.The new film, which opens today at the Embassy 72d Street Theater, has much of the same disturbing impact as Emile de Antonio's ""Point of Order,"" though it is far more ambitious and complex. ""Point of Order"" is a skillfully edited recording of the kinescopes of what was, in effect, a single event, the Army-McCarthy hearings that marked the bitter end of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's career as a public figure.""The Trials of Alger Hiss"" is about a series of events, as they were seen at the time in newsreels and other documentary footage, and as they are seen now in dozens of contemporary interviews with the surviving principal players, particularly with Mr. Hiss. It's about lifetimes spent in self-justification, about fashions in thought. As the movie procedes, it's also clear it's about time itself and the uses of history, and maybe even the abuses of history, which is not only what can be documented as having been, but also the way we choose to perceive the documented facts.There is absolutely no way that a movie about the Hiss trials is going to satisfy all those scholars who have devoted themselves to the study of the evidence, going over and over such things as the serial numbers on typewriters and whether the last meeting between Mr. Hiss and the late Whittaker Chambers, his accuser, took place in 1937 or 1938. No movie of conventional length can possibly present all the relevant data of this sort.""The Trials of Alger Hiss"" first gives us the basic facts, how Mr. Hiss, the Harvard Law School graduate, one of the bright young men in the State Department during the Roosevelt Administration, later the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was charged with being a Soviet spy by Mr. Chambers, a former member of the American Communist Party, self-described as a key link in the Communist underground in this country, a fellow who'd gone on to become a militant anti-Communist, to embrace Catholicism and a job as a senior editor of Time magazine. Because of the statute of limitations, Mr. Hiss could not be tried for espionage in 1949 and was, instead, tried for perjury on the grounds that he had lied to the House committee on un-American activities about his relations with Mr. Chambers.Mr. Lowenthal, a lawyer and a teacher at Rutgers University School of Law until he resigned to devote himself full-time to the making of this film (his first), and Marion Kraft, his editor, have put together a movie that has the vitality and immediacy of profoundly observed fiction, though it's a narrative that is still without a conclusion.This is not to say that the film is quite as unbiased as it pretends to be. Probably no film could be and make sense. I doubt that it would be possible now to make a film in which Mr. Hiss did not triumph over Mr. Chambers, in part for reasons that have nothing to do with the particulars of the case.For one thing, Mr. Hiss has endured with his wit, intelligence and patience intact. He has aged so well that it looks to be a sign of grace. He's a terrifically compelling figure alongside Mr. Chambers, who died in 1961 (after a couple of failed suicide attempts) and was anything but compelling in his public appearances. On film, Mr. Chambers is pudgy, has bad teeth and an unfortunate way of seeing himself as a heroic figure when everything we see tells us he is not. ""I testified against him with remorse and pity,"" he says at one point, barely stifling a cartoonlike sob.More important, as far as the film goes, is that he has not endured. What he has left behind him is a record of pathetic confessions and pathetic deceptions, some of which had horrendous consequences. We see no signs of a Dostoyevskian character wrestling with guilts as old as Christian time. Instead, he looks to be superficial though dangerously deluded. He reminds us of the Son of Sam.As time has been kind to Mr. Hiss and put the Red hysteria of the late 40's and early 50's into proper perspective, it's also softened the bristly personalities of a number of other key figures of the day on both sides of the case. In addition to Mr. Chambers, only two of the persons we see here come off badly  Richard M. Nixon, who is seen as a junior Representative and who virtually based his early career on the Hiss case, and Rev. John F. Cronin, who, at the time of the House investigation, provided Mr. Nixon with confidential material from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Understandably, I suppose, among those who declined to be interviewed by Mr. Lowenthal were Mr. Nixon and Priscilla Hiss, Mr. Hiss's former wife.""The Trials of Alger Hiss"" is not the last word on the Hiss case, but it is a brilliant, sorrowful evocation of a most anxious age.",1980-03-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'The Private Files of Hoover':The Director,"ITS premise may be mildly controversial, but ""The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover"" is still just a B-movie about a G-man. Its tone hovers midway between soap opera and expose, as when Hoover (played by Broderick Crawford) is seen meeting Senator Joseph R. McCarthy for dinner. Hoover jocularly hands over the names of a few dozen homosexuals in the Government's employ, and then McCarthy suddenly waxes wistful. ""People liked me,"" he says. ""I don't understand why they're so down on me now.""Moments like this give the movie its zest, but there aren't very many of them. The film mostly barrels along at a flat, uninteresting pace, with no big scenes to give it any structure. The script seems to have been well researched, and it goes to considerable trouble to propound a theory of what Hoover's role may have been in Watergate, or of the nature of his dealings with Robert F. Kennedy. But this information is revealed so blandly that it seems neither surprising nor dramatically effective.""The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover"" was made in 1977, directed by Larry Cohen, who also directed ""It's Alive!""; it is only now having its New York premiere, at the Public Theater. It features a big cast of medium-big players, among them Rip Torn as a disgruntled young Federal Bureau of Investigation man, Dan Dailey as Hoover's companion Clyde Tolson, and Ronee Blakley as the woman who upset the young Hoover mightily, if this movie is to be believed, by giving him a kiss.The film spans the entirety of Hoover's career, which gives it an opportunity to offer cursory re-enactments of Great Moments in Crime History, like the capture of ""Old Creepy"" Karpas or the killing of John Dillinger. The film is so muddily photographed that the Lady in Red, a major figure in the Dillinger episode, becomes the Lady in Puce.Many of the actors are photographed from bizarre angles, to accentuate their nonresemblances to the people they are playing. Michael Parks, as Robert Kennedy, is filmed so that his nose becomes prominent, because that  and a few ""uh's"" in his conversation  are really all he and Kennedy share in common. Raymond St. Jacques suggests absolutely nothing of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., nor does Andrew Duggan recall Lyndon B. Johnson. However, Mr. Duggan has one of the film's funnier scenes, when he shows Hoover a photograph of the Kennedy brothers with several women. Sighs Hoover, ""I had that kind of charm once.""",1980-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Small Circle' Of 3 College Friends:Growing Pains,"THE late 1960's and early 70's were not easy, but then they weren't boring. Things were happening: the Vietnam War, the sexual revolution, the antiwar marches, the violent campus confrontations and the earnest arguments about the relevancy of the university  arguments that sometimes sounded like sparrows debating the physical existence of the branch on which they perched. There were also the drugs capable of transforming the gray landscapes of the mind into multicolored Disneylands, where, with no intellectual effort whatsoever, great truths revealed themselves in psychedelic dreams.It was an era of unusual vitality, but the movies that came out of it were more than poor. They were memorably bad. I still remember (frame-by-frame, I fear) such 1970 disasters as ""Getting Straight,"" ""The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart,"" ""The Strawberry Statement"" and Stanley Kramer's ""R.P.M."" One might blame their failures on the greedy Hollywood moguls who produced them or on the blurred vision of the people who wrote and directed them. These people were still too close to the time and place to put the era in proper perspective. Maybe not.The people who wrote, directed and produced ""A Small Circle of Friends,"" which is about the lives and loves of three students (two Harvard, one Radcliffe) who matriculated in 1967, are themselves of that generation, but the movie they've made is almost as dopey and irrelevant as the films they probably booed in the Cambridge movie theaters of that time.""A Small Circle of Friends,"" which opens today at the Cinema II, is a sort of love story and a sort of introduction to the manners and mores of the day. It is depressingly cute, and though it means to be funny from time to time, it is almost as humorless as ""R.P.M.""""A Small Circle of Friends"" is about bright, winsome Jessica (Karen Allen), who wants to be a painter; headstrong, winsome Leo DaVinci (Brad Davis), who is dark, has dropped his real last name (Rizzo) and is working to become a ""New"" journalist and to write for The New York Times, and cheerful, winsome Nick Baxter (Jameson Parker), a blond, WASPy pre-med student who is so steadfast it hurts. They are characters with nothing to lose but their looks.The movie, which covers their undergraduate years with brief flashes forward to the present, announces the passage of time with title cards, with shots of people like Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey on television, but mostly with changing styles of hair that, whatever the length, always looks blow-dried.That Jessica, Leo and Nick aren't real radicals, though they are deeply affected by the times, seems to be the big nonpoint of the movie. Their lives change, but they remain, at heart, middle-class achievers, something the movie views not with irony or humor or sadness, only with a completely blank expression that I take to be approval. There's nothing wrong with this except that Rob Cohen, who directed the movie (his first), and Ezra Sacks, who wrote it, haven't learned from the late John P. Marquand how to make essentially boring, middle-class characters seem important and interesting.Though Jessica, Leo and Nick are attractively played, they are no more exciting than three primary ice-cream flavors. They are vanilla, chocolate and strawberry, and the movie, which makes a reference to ""Jules and Jim,"" finally combines the three friends in one apparently happy, very bland union.Typical of the pointlessly romantic manner in which the film operates is a sequence involving a vicious police attack against militant students, though we never know who's demonstrating on whose behalf. A later sequence, based on what happened some years ago at that ""bomb factory"" on West 11th Street in New York, is a bad joke dismally written.The definitive film  or even a moderately good film  about the late 60's and early 70's has yet to be made.",1980-03-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen: 'Joe and Maxi,' Love and Death:In the Final Days","""JOE AND MAXI,"" a documentary feature by Maxi Cohen and Joel Gold, is a photographic record of the last months in the life of Maxi's father, Joe Cohen, a prosperous, self-made man, who, at the time of his death, was the owner of a clam and fish dock on the New Jersey shore. When Miss Cohen and Mr. Gold began the film, her mother had recently died of cancer and Miss Cohen saw the film as a means of getting to know her father and understanding her feelings toward him. In the course of filming, Joe Cohen himself learned that he had cancer.At the start Miss Cohen, who appears in the film and is its producer and (with Mr. Gold) its co-director, tells us that when she was a child her father was a most forbidding character to her. He worked such long hours the family saw little of him. In fact, she goes on, she has no memory of him before she was 12 years old. Later, she says, he used to ""approach"" her ""sexually,"" by which she means that he used to pinch her a lot. He would punish her when she was bad, yet she loved him very much. When she finished high school she went off to New York University's Institute of Film and TV and eventually obtained her master's degree in media ecology.It's impossible to criticize a film as personal as ""Joe and Maxi"" without sounding rude; yet the truth is that neither Joe nor Maxi, as they appear in the film, are terrifically appealing characters. Joe, even after he learns about his cancer, is as egocentric, opinionated, overbearing and ignorant as he was before the dread news came, except that, as he goes about business-as-usual, he talks about death in a manner that is no less self-pitying for being rough and frank.One suspects that Joe must have been far more interesting than the movie makers allow him to appear. It took a talent we don't see to build up his business, and exactly what that business is is never fully described. Joe seems such a slob that it comes as a shock when, well along in the movie, we learn that he has his pilot's license and flies his own Comanche.Maxi, too, is smaller, less decent than she probably is in real life. Mouthing the platitudes and jargon of a dutiful but none-too-bright analysand, she seems as full of self-regard as her father and never, ever, does she appear to be unaware that all this personal drama is part of a movie she's making.We attend family dinners with Maxi, her father, her two brothers and assorted friends. We listen as her father tells her that she should get married, that it's not ""normal"" not to bear children. We meet the woman Joe is courting and are with him as he shows Maxi the bumps on his legs indicating that his cancer has metasticized. We are with Maxi when she goes to have her own medical checkup and witness her relief to learn she has no problems. Finally we learn that Joe has died off-screen.""Joe and Maxi"" recalls the kind of mysticism that flourished in film schools in the 1960's as cameras and sound equipment became increasingly portable and less expensive. The technological revolution produced its own muddled esthetic  the misguided notion that the camera is a magical instrument capable of revealing significance in everything it looks at. It doesn't. The camera is only a means to an end, which, to be of any value, must have had its beginning in someone's vision. Good movies aren't found objects.At the end of ""Joe and Maxi,"" which opens today at the Greenwich Theater, Maxi tells us that before she made the movie she was ""lost"" and didn't know who she was. Through the film, she says, she was able to see her father for the first time. Also, she was able to see herself. This may be true, but one can't help suspecting that she might have gotten to know her father (and even herself) more easily and quickly if she hadn't had to worry about things like sound and light levels.""Joe and Maxi"" suggests that life exists to be material for the film maker. After watching the movie one yearns to tell Maxi to put the camera away for a while and do something else. Read Balzac, perhaps.",1980-03-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Defiance,' 2 Gangs","""Defiance"" got a big hand at the Cinerama 2 Theater, where it opened yesterday. And a round of applause seemed to be all this movie was after. Too bad, because the beginning of ""Defiance"" seems headed for something better than a standard story of revenge, thanks particularly to Jan-Michael Vincent, who is quite likable in the leading role. But once it becomes evident that the entire screenplay is designed to justify Mr. Vincent's going on a head-bashing spree, the story loses its appeal in a hurry.In brief: a nice fellow (Mr. Vincent) moves into a bad neighborhood. The turf is ruled by a wicked gang. The gang steals from the grocer (Art Carney), as the grocer waxes nostalgic about what a nice place the area used to be. The nice fellow befriends a small boy, and together they plant a rooftop garden. The gang members visit the roof, and step on the sprouts. They rough up the little boy and make fun of botany. Sooner or later, the nice guy must take a stand.Before it deteriorates into a series of speeches about self-defense and the good old days, ""Defiance"" moves easily through Mr. Vincent's acquainting himself with his new home, introducing lots of friendly characters, like the girl upstairs who does her housework wearing lingerie. Another principal is the pleasant barfly (Danny Aiello) who used to be a gang member himself, and will indeed be donning his old Sportsmen jacket for the movie's big rumble.There are also, of course, bad guys: the Souls, whose outfits are something like Apache-Gaucho, and whose presence is often indicated by shots of their mean-looking boots. The movie does nothing to glamorize the Souls, and a lot to make them look silly. In one of their most vicious trouble-making sequences, the Souls are seen wreaking havoc at a church-basement bingo game.""Defiance"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains a number of violent episodes, most of them rendered offscreen, and some harsh language.",1980-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Fifth Floor,' a Melodrama:The Cast","""The Fifth Floor,"" which opened yesterday at the Criterion and other theaters, is a mental-hospital melodrama that needs help. It is simultaneously lethargic and frenzied, predictable and erratic. It's said to be based on the true story of a California woman who was mistakenly committed to a mental hospital. However, shot for shot, sequence for sequence, character for character (with the sexes reversed), it seems also based on ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.""Dianne Hull appears as the woman wrongly committed. Bo Hopkins is the evil nurse (a role that won an Oscar for Louise Fletcher in the earlier film), and Patti D'Arbanville and Sharon Farrell are two of the patients. Mel Ferrer and Julie Adams appear in throwaway roles as, respectively, a psychiatrist and a nurse.Meyer Dalinsky wrote the screenplay, which was produced and directed by Howard Avedis. It is most tacky.",1980-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'War at Home,' Vietnam Era Revisited:Those Action-Filled 60's","In movies, even documentary movies, where everything, including truth, is a matter of appearances, being ""real"" is not enough. Reality often looks faked or simply unimportant. The camera can lie. In the wrong hands it has an unfortunate way of shifting emphasis to the non-essential detail that illuminates nothing.There are currently playing first-run in New York four new documentary features, more than at any time that I can remember, including the late 60's when some thought that the documentary form was about to revolutionize the cinema. Though I doubt that these films signal any particular trend, they do define particular values and limitations. It's apparent from the four films  John Lowenthal's ""The Trials of Alger Hiss,"" Ira Wohl's ""Best Boy,"" Glenn Silber and Barry Alexander Brown's ""The War at Home"" and Maxi Cohen and Joel Gold's ""Joe and Maxi""  that the promised revolution has had more to do with the technology of lightweight movie equipment than with the esthetics of cinema. Like the good fiction film, the good documentary film still demands a guiding intelligence, a filmmaker with a point of view.Of the four new pictures, two (""The Trials of Alger Hiss"" and ""The War at Home"") belong to the kind of general-subject documentary that at one time was represented almost exclusively in this country by the old March of Time series, but time has certainly marched on.Both ""Best Boy"" and ""Joe and Maxi"" recall the work of Albert and David Maysles, who, in the 60's developed camera and sound equipment of such portability that the Maysles brothers could enter the private lives of their subjects and record the details with a minimum of self-consciousness. Without the Maysles, whose films (""Salesman,"" ""Gimme Shelter,"" etc.) owed much to the pioneering films of Richard Leacock and D.A. Pennebaker, I doubt whether there would ever have been a ""Best Boy"" or a ""Joe and Maxi.""""The Trials of Alger Hiss"" and ""The War at Home"" each explores a particularly dismaying chapter in recent American history, and if ""The Trials of Alger Hiss"" is the more moving and provocative of the two, it's largely because Mr. Lowenthal, a lawyer-turned-filmmaker, has a protagonist he can see in heroic terms. But ""The Trials of Alger Hiss"" is much more than the story of Mr. Hiss's two 1949 perjury trials, his nearly four years in prison and his subsequent efforts to clear his name. It's the record of fashions in American political thinking, adventurous and repressive, from the Great Depression through the years of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the administrations of Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, the Cold War and the Korean War, the Vietnam War, on through Watergate and the Watergate-prompted backlash represented by the Freedom of Information Act. This act, Mr. Lowenthal is convinced, has forced the government to make public previously classified material that raises serious questions about the manner in which Mr. Hiss was prosecuted.I suspect that Mr. Lowenthal believes that these disclosures are the most important elements in his film. To the rest of us  to those of us who are not experts on the contradictory details of the Hiss case  the power of the film is not in the proven innocence or guilt of Mr. Hiss but in its recapitulation of history as recorded then, principally in newsreels, and as remembered now, in interviews with Mr. Hiss and with other survivors of that era. This perspective, the gift of time, invests ""The Trials of Alger Hiss"" with an appreciation for the uses of history that is rare in a documentary movie and virtually non-existent in most of our contemporary fiction films.""The War at Home"" is a much less complex film about a subject that  today, anyway  is nowhere near as controversial as the Hiss case still is. In ""The War at Home,"" Mr. Silber and Mr. Brown recall the radicalization of students at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in the years between 1963 and 1973, from the first peaceful protests against the Vietnam War to the culminating violence on campuses all over the country as the war came to an end.If ""The Trials of Alger Hiss,"" being centered around a compelling, complicated character who has defied time and fashion, is like reading fiction at its best, ""The War at Home"" is a little like thumbing through the news magazines of the decade it covers. It has no particular focal point, no hero, no revelations of spirit that contradict what we believe or throw new light on the events it remembers. It's a perfectly adequate film, not especially surprising, a walk down Memory Lane.Both ""The Trials of Alger Hiss"" and ""The War at Home"" are examples of a kind of journalistic film that, all other things being equal, must take its scope from the subject. More than a quarter of a century of remembrance is the true subject of ""The Sorrow and the Pity,"" Marcel Ophuls's classic film about France during its occupation by the Nazis. Mr. Ophuls was no less a filmmaker when he later made ""A Sense of Loss"" about the war in Northern Ireland. ""A Sense of Loss"" is a painstaking movie, but it's not an especially satisfying one. The subject, being current, resists the kind of conceptualizing required in art but which is difficult for a filmmaker attempting to keep an open mind. The Vietnam War had only recently ended when Peter Davis completed his ""Hearts and Minds,"" but his feeling of unmistakable fury, which prompted the film's production in the first place, gave it shattering life as a movie.""Best Boy"" and ""Joe and Maxi"" are documentaries of an entirely different order, being about ordinary citizens with whom, in each case, the filmmakers have relationships that predate the production of the film.""Best Boy"" is a wonderfully gentle, wise and sympathetic portrait of Mr. Wohl's cousin Philly, a retarded 52-year-old man who, in the course of the production (and possibly as a result of it), begins to make some initial progress in self-reliance. The film is also about the other members of Philly's family, particularly his mother and father; and because Mr. Wohl is a filmmaker in command of his craft and his camera, his movie successfully conveys his love and concern.Love and concern are, surprisingly, the two qualities most conspicuously absent from ""Joe and Maxi,"" which is about Maxi Cohen's father Joe, a well-to-do, self-made entrepreneur on the Jersey Shore who, in the course of the movie, learns he has cancer and, near the end, dies. This is not, I'm sure, because Miss Cohen does not have love and concern for her father but because as a filmmaker she and her collaborator were not able to express those feelings in any way that we can share. Because ""Joe and Maxi"" is all about Maxi's frequently expressed feelings, the movie has the effect of giving short shrift to everyone else, especially her father.Miss Cohen and Mr. Gold were undoubtedy photographing real family get-togethers, real anxieties and real sorrows, but ""Joe and Maxi"" looks like an ego trip. True doesn't look real.In the heady, home-film boom of the 60's all sorts of unlikely people took up the camera to capture truth at 24 frames per second. Norman Mailer, in a brief sabbatical from what he does best, produced three feature-length psychodramas, culminating in his ""Gone With the Wind"" called ""Maidstone."" Andy Warhol, with the expert assistance of Paul Morrissey, pioneered a sort of impromptu fiction that might be called docu-camp. Canadian filmmaker Allan King, who made ""Warrendale,"" a fine, comparatively straight documentary about disturbed children, took his camera crew and more or less moved in with a married couple (both of whom happened to be failed actors) to make a film about a ""real"" marriage. It was called ""A Married Couple,"" and it looked less like a real marriage than like a couple of married actors trying their best to act like real people.Though ""Best Boy"" works nicely, the camera isn't a reliable tool for therapy. It keeps getting in the way. In ""David Holtzman's Diary,"" Jim McBride's classic send-up of the camera-mad 60's generation, the best friend and editor of the movie-obsessed hero, who is filming his own life to get a fix on it, criticizes the hero's use of his girlfriend as the girlfriend in the movie-within-the-movie. ""She's ridiculous,"" the friend says. ""She's trite. She behaves melodramatically. She's just not credible.""""David Holtzman's Diary,"" which was made in 1967, is still the last word on the so-called ""real"" cinema.Correction: In my daily review of ""The Trials of Alger Hiss,"" I mistakenly reported that Whittaker Chambers, after he left the Communist Party, embraced Roman Catholicism. He didn't. He became a Quaker.",1980-03-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Animation Art of the Fleischers:1928 to 1942,"THE Film Forum's ""Dave and Max Fleischer"" program, a wonderful show that opens this evening, presents a cartoon universe in which everything comes to life. These 13 animated shorts, from two 1928 silents to a 1942 Superman propaganda film, highlight the Fleischers' particular style of anthropomorphism, and the nightmare logic that always seems to guide their work. The walls get angry and sprout knives; a character's hands keep waving without him; a tree puts on a coat in winter. Nothing is reliable; everything keeps moving. Only their exuberant momentum keeps these films from seeming mad.The program concentrates heavily on Betty Boop, and it includes nothing of the producing and directing team's most famous film creation, Popeye. But the program's most notable shorts are devoted to less celebrated Fleischer characters, such as Betty's tiny dog, who goes on a 1938 subway voyage in ""Riding the Rails"" and winds up home in bed, terrified of the electric train his mistress has given him as a present. Or Bimbo, who, in the 1931 ""Bimbo's Initiation,"" has an adventure full of spectral figures and terrifying sexual ambiguity. In ""Grand Uproar,"" (1930), one of the most enchanting films on the bill, an entire opera house becomes incorporated into a musical performance, ending in an ovation that quite literally goes through the roof.The Fleischers' ""Follow the Bouncing Ball"" device turns up in ""Shine On Harvest Moon"" (1932), in which the sweetness of the song (performed by Alice Joy, ""Radio's Dream Girl"") contrasts markedly with the animators' nastier flights of fancy. One of the more delightful aspects of the Fleischer program is its musical accompaniment, because two of the other shorts feature Cab Calloway (or an animated figure, drawn to mimic Mr. Calloway's movements) performing ""Minnie the Moocher"" and ""St. James Infirmary Blues.""The two Superman shorts on the bill, both of them in color, are among the brothers' less successful efforts; their studio went out of business soon after the latter of these was made. These efforts are also quite revealing, because the Fleischers show so little aptitude for  or interest in  realistic animation styles. Superman and Lois Lane are at their most wooden in ""Superman,"" from 1941. So is the story's villain, a mad scientist. But the scientist's raven is wildly alive, like any real Fleischer creation, and the film sneaks in as many raven's-eye glimpses as possible. Heroic human figures have little to do with the grim, witty hallmarks of the Fleischers' imagination.",1980-03-20T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen: 'Nijinsky,' Filmed by Herbert Ross:Pointeless","THE time is 1913. Serge Diaghilev, the artistic director of and the guiding genius behind the Ballets Russes, which is in the process of revolutionizing the dance world, has just learned that Vaslav Nijinsky, his principal male dancer and choreographer as well as his lover, has married Romola De Pulsky, a rich young Hungarian woman with a will of steel.Diaghilev is outraged. Nijinsky, he swears, will never again dance with the Ballets Russes. Later he becomes even nastier. He insists that neither Nijinsky nor Romola ever attempt to get in touch with him. Vassily Zuikov, Diaghilev's faithful old valet, feels compelled to speak up.""Serge,"" Vassily says to Diaghilev, ""can't you just this once listen to your heart?""This advice, which occurs toward the end of Herbert Ross's new film, ""Nijinsky,"" and which, of course, goes unheeded, pretty much defines the emotional level on which this handsome, squashily romantic movie operates most of the time.It reduces personalities of great complexity and fearful contradictions to the dimensions of people who, crazily, refuse to listen to their hearts.It's also the kind of movie that takes us to Igor Stravinsky's music room in Switzerland where we hear Igor playing something familar on the piano. ""Tell me, Igor,"" says a thoughtful Diaghilev, ""what are you going to call it? "" ""The Princess,"" says Igor, ""suggests 'Le Sacre du Printemps.'""""Nijinsky"" is full of such thunderclaps of recognition but I can't help but suspect that Mr. Ross, the director of such considerable popular successes as ""The Goodbye Girl"" and ""California Suite,"" knows exactly what he's doing. If you're going to make a big commercial movie about Nijinsky, you better stick to terms that can be understood by even the dimmest member of the audience, someone who still thinks of ballet as a lot of odd people wearing tights and tutus and clomping around on their toes.With ""Nijinsky"" Mr. Ross, himself a choreographer, reaffirms the reputation he won with ""The Turning Point"" as the great popularizer of ballet. However, it's a reputation that's been gained at some cost, even, it seems, at the cost of ballet. I didn't have a stopwatch with me when I saw ""Nijinsky"" but I have the impression that there is far less ballet in it than there was in ""The Turning Point."" Perhaps it only seems that way.""Nijinsky,"" which was written by Hugh Wheeler, who's done much better things, including ""A Little Night Music,"" is a mostly unexplored, three-sided love story dominated by the visionary, astonishing personality of Diaghilev (Alan Bates). At the start of the film, which covers the years 1912 and 1913, the young Nijinsky (George de la Pea) is at the height of his fame as a dancer. He is about to become a controversial choreographer and he is, seemingly, blissfully happy with Diaghilev, who is his father, mother, teacher and artistic conscience as well as his lover.It is the movie's contention that Nijinsky, none too stable anyway and believing that he has been abandoned by Diaghilev, allows himself to be seduced by Romola (Leslie Browne) and to marry her, which leads directly to his madness.The way the movie ends  with a shot of Nijinsky, in a straitjacket, staring into space  one would assume that his life virtually ended in 1913, though he later did go on to choreograph another ballet for Diaghilev and to father two daughters by Romola.Facts are not the problem with ""Nijinsky,"" though. The problem is a sort of insistent superficiality that is most apparent in the writing and in the performances of Mr. de la Pea and Miss Browne.Though he has dark good looks and a dancer's fine, lean physique, Mr. de la Pea has no appreciable presence as an actor on the screen. In his heavy ballet makeup, he tends to disappear so completely that one fails to recognize not only the character and the dancer, but also the actor, which leaves a certain number of holes in the picture. It may be that the very qualities that have earned Mr. de la Pea acclaim as a dancing actor on the stage work against him on film.We don't even see that much of his dancing in ""Nijinsky,"" certainly nothing to compare with the exhilarating way in which Mr. Ross presented Mikhail Baryshnikov in ""The Turning Point."" There are bits and pieces of a number of ballets in ""Nijinsky"" but only three  ""The Spectre of the Rose,"" ""Afternoon of a Faun"" and ""Games""  are more than mere excerpts.Miss Browne brings no particular life to an impossible role that does not allow her to dance at all. What is intended to be Romola's forceful, obsessed personality looks to be ordinary stubbornness. Though I assume her character is meant to change within the film, Miss Browne doesn't, only her costumes do.Without a riveting Nijinsky and Romola, any movie titled ""Nijinsky"" is in trouble. This one is lucky to have Mr. Bates carrying on in high style as the great Diaghilev. He's a witty, intelligent actor whose presence is felt even when he is off the screen. There are also a number of good subsidiary performances, including those by Alan Badel, who appears as the effete, sympathetic Baron de Gunzburg, the man who bankrolled the Ballets Russes; Jeremy Irons as the choreographer Fokine and Carla Fracci as Karsavina, Nijinsky's dance partner.The movie, which was photographed by Douglas Slocombe, looks terrific. Mr. Ross appears to have listened to his heart and not his head when it came to spending money on locations around Europe and on his pre-World War I sets, as well as on ballet sets said to be based on the Ballets Russes originals.""Nijinsky,"" which opens today at the Coronet Theater, is an opulent movie but a largely untenanted one.",1980-03-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Matthau in 'Miss Marker':From Runyon,"TAKE your pick: ""Little Miss Marker"" is either the latest remake of Damon Runyon's heartwarming story, or yet another movie in which Walter Matthau runs around in his underwear. The second choice is probably the more helpful of the two. Whenever this is Mr. Matthau's movie  and that's quite a lot of the time  it's reasonably funny and appealing. Mr. Matthau is up to his same old tricks, and those tricks have become happily familiar by now. He, and the movie's accomplished supporting cast, create the impression of considerable polish. If ""Little Miss Marker"" were a lot more witty, and a bit less overdecorated, it might recall the good-time-Charlie spirit of ""The Sting.""But ""Little Miss Marker,"" which opens today at the Criterion Center and other theaters, also depends on Mr. Runyon's material  more than it can afford to, because the story is a sentimental tale and the movie, being contemporary, is relatively cool. The child of the title is a wonderful 6-year-old, left as collateral at a gambling establishment and eventually adopted by the head of the operation, Sorrowful Jones. As his name suggests. Sorrowful is a man who lives without love, but the child soon remedies that. The child also befriends Amanda, a beautiful widow, who soon befriends Sorrowful, with One Big Happy Family as everyone's eventual goal.Among the demands of this story is that the child be adorable, and that Mr. Matthau beam and cry. Sara Stinson, in the role that was originally Shirley Temple's, doesn't do much more than look sweet, and without Miss Temple at its heart, the story doesn't entirely make sense. As for Mr. Matthau, he's better at being gruff than at being fond. And the movie's one tearful scene is quite beyond him  especially because the director, Walter Bernstein, shoots it at a noticeably awkward angle that just makes the scene clumsier.Mr. Bernstein, the well-known screenwriter making his directorial debut, successfully incorporates some of Mr. Runyon's funniest lines into the story. And the movie has a number of winning gags, such as a rigged horse race in which the would-be victor is so slow the other jockeys have to work overtime to lose. There's also a laugh involving two dogs, and another, at the movie's beginning, when Mr. Matthau is heard giving one of his debtors the meanest dressing-down you ever heard. The door to his office opens, and out walks a tearful old lady.But the film is expensively listless much of the time, and Mr. Bernstein falters noticeably with the movie's visual style: it's much too lavish, except perhaps for students of Depression-era props. And at times the shadowy camerawork becomes more attention-getting than the story. Bob Newhart, drolly servile as Mr. Matthau's assistant, gets into a fight with Tony Curtis, who plays a foppish gangster, and Mr. Curtis crushes Mr. Newhart's hat, presumably bending it into a funny shape. But the hat is black and the wall behind Mr. Newhart is dark brown, so the hat becomes so hard to see that the joke is lost. At the end of the film, Mr. Matthau and Mr. Curtis get into another fight, this one out-doors. Their eyes are so consistently hidden in shadow that it becomes difficult to remember who's winning.Julie Andrews, elegantly costumed by Ruth Morley, looks lovely as the socialite that Mr. Curtis and Mr. Matthau and Miss Stimson all adore; her natural hauteur is somehow softened by the role. Also in the cast is Brian Dennehy, as a strong-arm aide of Mr. Curtis's, assigned to keep Mr. Matthau in line. One of the less welcome innovations in the story is the suggestion, expressed by Mr. Dennehy and Mr. Newhart, that there's something risque about Mr. Matthau's letting a 6-year-old girl sleep in his bed. ""Little Miss Marker"" isn't modern in any other way, and it doesn't need to be modern about that.""Little Miss Marker"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains a few mild epithets.",1980-03-21T05:00:00+0000

Michel and Lydia have never laid eyes on each other before that rainy afternoon that he accidently bumps into her on the Boulevard St. Michel. It's more than an ordinary collision of clothed bodies. Two souls have come together and, rather as if they were jellyfish, it's impossible for us to separate them, though each immediately senses the pain hidden deep within the other.Michel apologizes. Lydia smiles. It was nothing, she says. He smiles. She smiles again. They enter a cafe. They talk about this and that. Small talk. They reveal nothing and yet they reveal all. Lydia even reveals her address.Later Michel knocks at the door of her flat, which she opens. She smiles. She has been expecting him. He smiles. He enters. The flat is somber. The sounds of a Peruvian flute fill the spaces of that somber flat.Michel and Lydia begin to make love. He clutches her; she, him. Forgetfulness in desire. But no. She can't. She's not ready. She rushes into the bathroom and emerges a minute later looking absolutely smashing in a long white terrycloth robe. Lydia owes Michel an explanation.""Clair de Femme,"" Costa-Gavras's romantic new French film, is pretty bad when it's dealing in small talk, but it manages to get hilariously worse when the explanations begin to flow.Lydia (Romy Schneider) still grieves for her small daughter killed six months earlier in an automobile accident that has left her husband brain-damaged, suffering from dysphasia. Talking as if she'd overdosed on Rudolph Friml, Lydia says, ""I love a man I no longer love, so I love him more,"" which is the sort of thing that Michel (Yves Montand) understands perfectly.Eventually Michel reveals his pain. His beloved wife, suffering from terminal cancer, has just died, a suicide made possible with the aid of the grieving Michel.When he and Lydia met, Michel had been planning to fly off to Caracas or Calcutta or Africa, someplace, anyplace, as long as there's a first-class flight to it. He has to think.""Clair de Femme,"" which opens today at the Little Carnegie, is about loneliness and loss, about being able to afford a trip to a far-off place to think, and about talking in some of the fruitiest images to be spoken in any language on any movie screen in years.""You are drunk with despair,"" says Lydia to Michel, who's been drinking a lot of brandy. ""Words keep us afloat,"" says Michel to Lydia. ""I was offered a job helping people in Bangladesh,"" says Lydia to Michel.Lydia and Michel talk about their grief, always in abstract terms, with the singlemindedness of tourists who've lost their luggage. Talk, apparently, helps, though Michel does say to Lydia at one point, ""It's like throwing a bottle into the sea, only now there is no sea, only bottles.""""Clair de Femme"" is a movie of such grave, all-pervasive fatuousness that it makes one suspect one's judgment for having respected such earlier Costa-Gavras films as ""Z,"" ""The Confession"" and ""State of Siege."" Only the elegant presences of Yves Montand and Romy Schneider keep the picture from being an outright disaster. Even exhausted and totally confused they command our attention.In the program notes, Mr. Costa-Gavras is quoted as saying of this, his first romantic film, that ""love relationships between couples"" are ""the initial point of the human being."" (By which I think he means the love relationships between the two members of one couple, rather than those among the four people that would comprise two couples, but I really can't be sure.)""I believe,"" he says further, ""that the couple is the most basic  and the most political  unit of society.""""Clair de Femme"" is leaded with couples, some more odd than others, but none of them especially compelling. In addition to the emotionally wrecked Lydia and Michel, the movie is about Lydia's mother-in-law (Lila Kedrova), a rich White Russian migr who forms a couple with her vegetable-son, and about a colorfully tacky nightclub performer (Romolo Valli), who is a couple with his 14-year-old poodle. Just to make sure we get the point of couplehood, there's another couple, a chimpanzee and a toy poodle who, in moments of stress, dance together.There may well be a political point to be made about couplehood, but it's not made in ""Clair de Femme."" These couples are all so self-absorbed, you wouldn't trust them with the time.Perhaps Mr. Costa-Gavras is not entirely to blame for the high-camp dialogue, but, from the French I could hear on the soundtrack, the English subtitles are accurate. The screenplay, which Mr. Costa-Gavras wrote himself, is based on a novel by Romain Gary, who is reported to have told the film maker he believed all movie adaptations to be violations but that he hoped this one ""would be the best possible kind."" Mr. Gary should keep his dire predictions to himself.",1980-03-23T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Eboli,' Prisoner's Tale by Rosi:The Cast","""Eboli"" is a reflective, leisurely film with the feeling of an adaptation rather than an original. The source material is ""Christ Stopped at Eboli,"" Carlo Levi's memoir of his confinement as a political prisoner in a remote part of Italy in the mid-1930's. Francesco Rosi, the director, who illustrates the story more than he shapes it, limits his film entirely to the period of Mr. Levi's banishment and recalls incidents loosely and easily, without forcing them into place. For all the harshness of Mr. Levi's situation, there's a great deal of gentleness to the tale.Mr. Rosi takes a clearly compassionate attitude toward the entire episode of Mr. Levi's stay in Lucania, a tiny hilltop village in southern Italy. But the story's individual incidents are presented without comment, and sometimes without enough definition  this is a movie that repeatedly sends its audience back to the book on which it is modeled. The various episodes remain isolated from one another, however powerfully Mr. Rosi conveys a sense of place.In a closing voice-over, Levi (played by Gian Maria Volonte) departs from Lucania, saying that perhaps he has only been a clumsy observer in this desolate place. But he serves as a careful onlooker throughout much of the film, and his decorous manner helps set the mood. As the film begins, he disembarks from a train at the Eboli station and is carried, on a bus filled with peasant women and chickens, along the arduous route to Lucania. The village is situated at a kind of land's-end, in an eerie, beautiful spot that gives the film an understated drama. On one side of Lucania, there is a green, rolling landscape; these are the fields in which the peasants labor. The opposite vista is parched and eroded, virtually uninhabitable. Lucania, physically and culturally, is positioned at the very last outpost of livable terrain.A lot of the film is devoted to Mr. Levi's quietly watching the peasants' customs, as he wanders relatively freely through the town. (Two other prisoners, more controversial than he, are kept indoors and forbidden to speak to each other.) The people of Lucania happily accept him, because he is a trained physician in a place where love potions and curative coins are still taken seriously. Eventually, an edict forbidding him to practice medicine in the town is lifted and he becomes closely connected with the lives and welfare of those around them. He develops great fondness and respect for these people, especially since they illustrate, for him, the irrelevance of the state in general and Fascism in particular. The film ponders, at great length and less depth, the nature of the real Italy, because the men of Lucania seem to temper their patriotism with wanderlust. When the men of Lucania speak of loving Italy, they also speak about leaving it, even as their lives remain inextricably tied to the land.Mr. Volonte gives a calm, ghostly, very passive performance, as he observes characters like Irene Papas's sharp-eyed scrubwoman, who has been pregnant 17 times by about as many men. Miss Papas, who is hard at work as Mr. Levi's housekeeper during much of her performance, really sweats her way through the role. Lea Massari turns up briefly as Mr. Levi's sister, paying a visit that says as much as the movie offers about his genteel past. These elements don't entirely tie together, but they create a sharp impression.",1980-03-23T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Poto and Cabengo,' Story of Unusual Twins:Another Failed Dream","IN August 1976, Jean-Pierre Gorin, a former collaborator of Jean-Luc Godard (""Vladimir and Rosa,"" ""Tout Va Bien,"" ""Letter to Jane"" and so on) and who now lives on the West Coast, set out to make a documentary feature about Grace and Virginia Kennedy, the nearly identical. 6-year-old Southern California twins who were baffling psychologists and speech experts with what sounded to be a language of their own invention.""Poto and Cabengo,"" the private nicknames the girls had for each other, is the record of Mr. Gorin's enounter with them, with their father and mother and their German-speaking grandmother, and, unexpectedly, with yet another failed American dream. The film, which opens today at the Whitney Museum of American Art, is a modest, sweetly understated work that is all the more moving for the unsentimental concern shown its subjects.""You can only be a foreigner in a language other than your own,"" Mr. Gorin says on the soundtrack at the beginning of the film, and it's clear by the end that everyone in ""Poto and Cabengo"" is an alien to some degree.Tom Kennedy, the father of the twins, has moved from his native South to San Diego to seek his fortune with his German-born wife, Christine, whom he met while he was in the Army, and Mrs. Kennedy's mother, who has emigrated to the United States from Germany. Mr. Kennedy, trained as an accountant, has trouble finding work in San Diego, partly, he thinks, because he is an Army man and San Diego is a Navy town.When we first meet Mr. Kennedy, he is selling real estate, taking courses in how to become a supersalesman and living in a tiny, spotlessly clean house in a San Diego subdivision into which Mexicans have begun to move. This is much to the dismay of the genteel Mrs. Kennedy, a buxom, completely self-assured woman who's never at a loss for words in English or German and appears to be wearing a different wig each time we see her.Poto and Cabengo are pretty, seemingly happy, utterly charming little girls who, it turns out in the course of the movie, may be slightly retarded, though that cannot yet be firmly established.It's pointed out by one of their counselors that the girls have been raised in what's called ""a mutually poor linguistics environment,"" having two language models, English and German, ""both deficient."" Left largely in their own company as twins often are, the girls have come to speak their own mixture of the two languages, which, after being taped by speech specialists, is painstakingly broken down and subsequently decoded. By the end of the film, the girls are speaking a perfectly recognizable English.Mr. Gorin, having set out to find some sort of variation on a ""wild child"" story, finds instead a far more conventional story about a lower-middle-class American family caught up in media hype.After their initial surprise at the huge amount of attention given their twins, Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy accept the notoriety and happily anticipate the extraordinary economic benefits that naturally go along with American celebrity. Mr. Kennedy finds his fame opens doors for him in his work. On the expectation that there will be a commercial movie made about the twins, the family moves into a larger house complete with a television set, separate bedrooms for the girls and for their grandmother, who had shared their room earlier, plus a second automobile, a used Cadillac.Unfortunately there was to be no big movie deal. The producer apparently lost interest when it was established that Poto and Cabengo had not invented a new language. The family could not keep up the payments on the new house and soon lost it.The last thing we hear is that the girls are continuing to progress, but we are left wondering what their lives will be like in the future, as well as those of Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy who, before they bought the new house, the television set and the used Cadillac, had bought the American vision of a future of unlimited possibilities.It's a sad story, and Mr. Gorin and his associates, Les Blank, the cameraman, and Greg Durbin, the editor, treat it with remarkable respect.",1980-03-25T05:00:00+0000

They transform the day. No matter how you feel when you go into the theater, you feel better coming out.""Serial,"" a satire about life in Marin County, one of San Francisco's most modish and affluent suburbs, is a post-card-pretty, very cheerful comedy, but it's also a movie you have to meet more than halfway. You shouldn't see it if you're worrying about income tax or aching to read Patrick White's ""The Twyborn Affair"" or are just generally depressed. You're likely to find it as redundant as a parody of Dr. Joyce Brothers.Given the proper circumstances, though, you may find ""Serial"" a lark. Even if you don't laugh nonstop, you'll smile a lot. It's difficult to resist a movie that contains a marriage ceremony that begins when a WASPily with-it minister announces, ""Fellow members of the human community, we're going to unit two separateness,"" and concludes with his saying, ""I now pronounce you pair-bonded for as long as this relationship continues.""Like ""The Serial,"" Cyra McFadden's novel-with-drawings on which the screenplay is based, ""Serial"" is an almost completely dead-panned examination of American civilization as it appears to have peaked a couple of years ago in Marin County, a place where everyone is beautiful and has everything a person could possibly desire, including imported bicycles, a psychiatrist just down the road, other men's wives (and other wives' husbands), organic food, and, of course, wall-to-wall neuroses. From sun up to sundown the people in ""Serial"" are miserable.Among them are Kate (Tuesday Weld) and Harvey Holroyd (Martin Mull), who aren't relating the way they used to, partly because they have a negative family dynamic that, eventually, drives their teenage daughter off to a San Francisco cult called the Church of Christian Oriental Harmony. There are also Martha (Sally Kellerman), now on her fifth or sixth husband, and her 10-year-old son Stokeley (Anthony Battaglia), who's in therapy designed to put him in touch with his childhood.Other members of the community include Sam (Bill Macy) and his wife Angela (Nita Talbot), who long for a youth forever gone; Carol (Pamela Bellwood), the community's beautiful nymphomaniac; Leonard (Peter Bonerz), the local shrink who says such things as ""What we're talking about here is a real mental meltdown;"" Spike (Tom Smothers), the swinging clergyman, and a weekend motorcyle gang whose members dress up like Hell's Angels and listen to Judy Garland records.There are many amusing conceits in ""Serial"" and they run on horizontally, as the title promises, at the predictable pace of a soap opera. To have shaped the material more dramatically, Bill Persky, the director, and Rich Eustis and Michael Elias, who wrote the screenplay, would have had to distort the form, which is one of the funnier things about the film. ""Serial"" is a kind of condensed, upper middle class ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"" without the presense of Louise Lasser.However, it does have Martin Mull, who was so fine in the ""Mary Hartman"" television series. He's a witty actor, even when the screenplay insists that his be the one voice of sanity in Marin County. The others are all supremely, hilariously self-fixated, particulary Miss Weld, Miss Kellerman and Mr. Macy, who has the movie's one more or less straight moment as he reports, sadly, that his psychiatrist has told him he was having a nervous breakdown when ""I just thought I was having a good time."" Also effective is Rexford Metz's photography  all primary colors and as crystal clear and unshadowed as a cartoon. The houses and stores and boutiques of Marin County, as well as the San Francisco skyline across the bay, have the blemish-free, idealized look of an architect's drawing.The principal point of ""Serial,"" which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, is language, an appreciation of the sort of jargon that may well bring this country to a halt long before inflation, deflation or the complete cut-off of Arab oil. ""Serial"" is aware that as language becomes more mechanical and muddled, so do the people using it.",1980-03-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Jesus' at Embassy:According to Luke,"BY presenting without embellishment the version of His life as given in Luke, ""Jesus"" avoids, as its producers state, the embellishment and falsification of other film versions. What is left, however, is little more than an illustrated Gospel, with nothing in the way of historical and social context.Jesus, played by Brian Deacon, a young English actor, is pretty much the conventional parlor chromo version. His brow is noble, his eyes clear, his chestnut hair long, his beard neatly trimmed and his robe well-cut.The rest of the performers were found in Israel, where the film was made. They are not identified, possibly to protect their professional reputations, although many seem to be facing a camera for the first time.It should be noted that the Crucifixion is presented at considerable length and in vivid close-up, and might well be disturbing to children.The physical production is adequate but the direction and cinematography, in washed-out color, are painfully monotonous. ""Jesus"" was made by a British company that also sells a volume called ""The New Media Bible.""The film, which opens today at the Embassy 1 and other theaters, has been on view in other sections of the country, often in churches rather than theaters, since last fall.",1980-03-28T05:00:00+0000

At 6 A.M., right on the dot, the entire house shakes to the tatoo of an unearthly drum. This house, a great old gingerbread mansion on the outskirts of Seattle, is obviously haunted.""The Changeling,"" which opens today at the Cinerama 2 and other theaters, is meant, I suppose, to be a serious movie. It's about the restless ghost of a small boy who was murdered 60 years ago by his father and who now demands vengeance. He's not fooling around.It's seriously acted by George C. Scott, as a recently widowed composer who comes to live in the mansion; by Melvyn Douglas, as a retired, very rich United States Senator who is implicated in the ghost's story, and by Trish Van Devere, as a lady from the local historical society that now owns the house.The film has also been seriously directed by Peter Medak (""A Day in the Life of Joe Egg,"" ""The Ruling Class"") in some handsome settings in Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, with seriously expensive, complicated supernatural effects. Yet ""The Changeling"" is nothing more than seriously silly.Neither the screenplay, by William Gray and Diana Maddox, nor Mr. Medak's direction, which relies on a lot of low-and high-angle shots, is bad in any obvious way, but it's never for a moment interesting. In some mysterious fashion the film makers have managed to put together a movie that, as you watch it, gives you the impression you're seeing a synopsis of some other movie.""The Changeling"" isn't especially short by any means, but it's without any voice or feeling of its own.",1980-03-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Gilda Radner:A Revue of Repertory,"NOTHING in ""Gilda Live"" is funnier than, or a substantial departure from, the material Gilda Radner does on ""Saturday Night Live."" But the film ought to satisfy her fans. As directed by Mike Nichols, this is a straightforward record of Miss Radner's Broadway show at the Winter Garden last year, a show that had its decided ups and downs. The best of her material presents Miss Radner as an agile, versatile comedian, but the lesser skits tend to ramble.Miss Radner is not the sole star of ""Gilda Live,"" which opens today at the Sutton and other theaters. She appears as a number of characters, in a show that gives equal weight to these various skits and does little to tie them together. So Don Novello, who puts in a series of appearances as Father Guido Sarducci, upstages Miss Radner regularly, if only because of his character's continuity.Mr. Novello is seen explaining about a ""Kennedy-Lincoln Coincidenza"" in Italian (both their names have seven letters), and proposing his scheme for a ""five-minute university""  during a five-minute session, the student is taught everything the average college graduate remembers after five years. The Religion course goes this way: ""Where is God? God is everywhere. Why? Because He likes you."" Mr. Novello describes this as a combination of Roman Catholic theology and Walt Disney.Miss Radner's best shot here is her appearance as Rhonda Weiss, of Rhonda and the Rhondettes, singing a protest song about the banning of saccharine. The Rhondettes wear sunglasses and carry little shoulderbags, waving their hands in a gesture that suggests their nails aren't dry. Meanwhile, Rhonda explains ""up until now, I never felt the need to protest. I mean, nothing in the 60's really bothered me."" Then she read the saccharine story in The National Enquirer: ""I nearly died.""This routine, performed with the three female singers of the group Desmond Child and Rouge, is something Miss Radner has tried on television, and in fact most of the show has a familiar ring. What it doesn't have is an eventful feeling, a sense that Miss Radner is really taking a chance. Her closing song, something sentimental about innocent romance, offers the evening's only step out of character  and it's a step backwards, since it ends an otherwise amusing program on a note of false intimacy. Nothing else about the material, a 90-minute run through of Miss Radner's repertory, suggests she's interested in doing more than playing it safe.",1980-03-28T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Little Darlings,' a Rite-of-Passage Comedy:Space Colonies in Yonkers Would You Like to Bet?","""COULD you tell me what some of the after-effects are?"" asks Tatum O'Neal, talking to her camp counselor about sex. ""You make it sound like a disease,"" says the counselor, understating the problem with ""Little Darlings"" by a mile. This is a movie about loss of innocence, and it's supposed to be a comedy. Yet it begins with a scene in which a teen-age girl kicks a teen-age boy in the groin  and relations between the sexes never get much better during the course of the story.The premise of ""Little Darlings,"" an idea that is not without its comic possibilities, is that two 15-year-old girls at a summer camp make a bet over which one can lose her virginity first. This happens very early in the movie and the screenplay twists an ankle getting even this far: it dreams up a mean little vixen named Cinder (Krista Errickson), who immediately pegs Ferris (Tatum O'Neal) and Angel (Kristy McNichol) as sexually inexperienced, goads them into the bet, and then pressures everyone else at Camp Little Wolf into taking sides. The other girls are clearly just as virginal as Ferris and Angel, and in any case their intense interest in the bet seems a little strange. Not even trampy Cinder spends any time at the boys' camp across the lake. They'd all prefer to stay home and nag Angel and Ferris into action.Eventually, one of the contestants wins. But the film has gone to such lengths to depict sex as a wretched ordeal, something to dread, that small wonder the girl who has been deflowered spends the rest of the story weeping. If ""Little Darlings"" were funnier about other things, it might have the wherewithal to keep the plot's sexual undertones from becoming unpleasant. But the movie's jokes are listlessly vulgar, and they fit in all too well with the prevailing nasty air.Miss O'Neal and Miss McNichol, both lovely and accomplished actresses, are much better than their material. And they go a long way toward lending the story a little charm. Miss O'Neal is supposed to be rich and unhappy  we know that because she arrives for camp in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a white suit and a pout. Miss McNichol is supposed to be tough and impoverished, and it is she who delivers the opening kick. There isn't much warmth or empathy between them, but that helps further the notion that they're feuding. It doesn't explain what they're doing at the same camp, though, or why neither one is teased about her economic status or her clothes or her parents or anything else  15-year-old girls who can be cruel about sex can also be cruel about plenty of other things. ""Little Darlings"" is just too fixated to take that into account.""Little Darlings,"" which opens today at the Forum and other theaters, has a screenplay so inept that it defines one character entirely by a succession of funny hats (like a propeller beanie), and has Angel's mother begin virtually every line with ""Angel, I'm your mother,' or something of the sort. The teen-age characters are often more inarticulate than they need to be  ""You're drunk."" ""You're cute,"" goes one exchange. It doesn't help to have Miss McNichol's beau played by a young actor (Matt Dillon) even more inexpressive than his lines. Mr. Dillon, incidentally, spends much of his time bare-chested, and is presented as much more of a sex object than Miss McNichol. That's another of the movie's curiosities.""Space Colonies: The Final Frontier,"" a film exploring the development and use of space colonies, will be shown weekends through Aug. 3 at the Hudson River Museum, 511 Warburton Avenue in Yonkers. The film was written and narrated by Dr. Brian O'Leary, an author and former astronaut; Steve Reich composed the musical score. Showings are at 4 P.M. today and 2 and 4 P.M. tomorrow and Sunday. Tickets are $1.50 ($1 for children and the elderly); admission to the museum is free. Information: (914)963-4550.",1980-03-28T05:00:00+0000

A volcano erupts in Hawaii, killing off an all-star cast in something like reverse billing order. So those who die before Valentina Cortese does are mostly extras. And Paul Newman doesn't die at all.The ever-delightful Ernest Borgnine, without whom it is evidently not possible to make one of these things, is singed in a fire halfway through the story and wanders around with a bandage over his eyes the rest of the time. But because the only other really big names on the bill are Jacqueline Bisset, William Holden, James Franciscus and Burgess Meredith, Mr. Borgnine automatically makes it through.The dialogue tends to be crisp. ""It's rough country, so dress for it,"" orders Mr. Newman, giving everyone five minutes to evacuate a resort hotel. (They're all extras. They all die.) And a sample scene:""What happened?""""I don't know.""""Get him to a hospital.""""How 'bout you?""""I'm all right.""No he isn't, or he wouldn't be here.""When Time Ran Out"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").
