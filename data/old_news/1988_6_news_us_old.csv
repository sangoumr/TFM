In the last two sessions, the Dow has risen 107.57 points, or 5.5 percent. Volume was strong for the second day in a row, and traders said institutional and foreign investors were active in the market. [ Page D1. ] The bond market's rally continued, as prices of Treasury notes and bonds rose by as much as 1 3/4 points in light trading. Participants said the market was reacting to having fallen too far too fast rather than to any specific economic news. [ D17. ] The S.E.C. put off until next month a proposal asking Congress to ban forced arbitration of disputes between brokerage firms and their customers. [ D5. ] Rep. John D. Dingell asked the Big Board to provide him with data that showed that specialists had had their most profitable year in 1987 despite the market crash. It was not clear why Mr. Dingell did not have the information, which had been given to another Congressional committee. [ D7. ] A rally in U.S. financial markets helped sustain the dollar against major foreign currencies. Gold rose $2.60 an ounce on the Comex, to $457.60. [ D15. ] The price of soybeans from last year's harvest closed above $8 a bushel for the first time since June 1984. [ D15. ] Yields were slightly higher on money market mutual funds, C.D.'s and bank money market accounts.

[ D1. ] Orders received by manufacturers surged in April for the second consecutive month. [ D6. ] Construction spending advanced 0.1 percent in April as a boom in factory construction helped offset weakness in government projects. [ D6. ] A lower rate on capital gains taxes would increase revenues, a Treasury study found. It provides ammunition for Vice President Bush and other advocates of lowering the tax rate. The new study was not prepared by the Treasury Department divisions that normally assess the impact of tax policy issues.

us,GARDENING,"The year's surfeit of new garden books is frankly intimidating. But with so many publishers pandering to the dirty-fingernail crowd, it was inevitable that too many offerings would be slick packages geared to the quick sale, devoid of either sustenance or soul. So caveat emptor is the name of the garden book game, and serious browsing is essential for determining which authors know more about their subject than they do about getting their name (or photos) into print. THE OPINIONATED GARDENER: Random Offshoots From an Alpine Garden. By Geoffrey B. Charlesworth. Illustrated by Laura Louise Foster. 197 pp. (Godine, $16.95.) Geoffrey B. Charlesworth's essays are a glorious mix of sophisticated how-to information and dispassionate, occasionally hilarious observations that reveal the arrogance and insecurities of gardeners. The essays, originally intended as contributions to a rock garden society newsletter, are zesty and fast paced. They are also pure pleasure, even if nose-to-soil admiration of microscopic alpine plants is not your favorite garden posture. Organized in loosely related sections, these ''random offshoots'' range from witty musings keyed to the seasons (as in a spring welcoming of ''the swallows and the drabas, also . . . the U.P.S. man with the box of plants you forgot you ordered'') to philosophical ruminations on the gardener's predilection for proselytizing (''every time you give a lithops to an orchid grower . . . you are engaged in an effort to change the recipient's way of life''). It's hard to imagine a merrier way of confronting the likes of androsace or erysimum, especially when armed with such advice as ''if you want to identify plants expertly, you should spend a lot of time surreptitiously reading labels.'' The exquisite line drawings, sensitively rendered by the late Laura Louise Foster, seem the ideal counterpoint to Mr. Charlesworth's elegant prose. THE ANNUAL GARDEN. By Peter Loewer. Illustrated by the author. 242 pp. (Rodale, $19.95.) It's always fun to romp through another garden read with Peter Loewer, whose talent for breezy, informative prose is exceeded only by his ability to translate into winsome line drawings the object of his attention. There are signs of a renewed interest in annuals lurking just down the garden path, and Mr. Loewer's latest offering has arrived in the nick of time to save us from what he calls the ''triple threat of petunias, marigolds and zinnias.'' Here we are introduced (or reintroduced) to the charms of cuphea, cleome, love-in-a-mist, cosmos, schizanthus and over 350 versatile species, not all of which are true annuals, that Mr. Loewer finds praiseworthy as reliable sources of color for a single season. Basic growing techniques are provided - most notably, helpful words on working with seeds. Also included are 14 of Mr. Loewer's easy-to-follow plans for some dazzling and original combinations. TOPIARY: The Art of Clipping Trees and Ornamental Hedges. By A. M. Clevely. Illustrated. 128 pp. (Salem House, $29.95.) THE COMPLETE BOOK OF TOPIARY. By Barbara Gallup and Deborah Reich. Illustrated. 318 pp. (Workman, Paper, $10.95.) Ever since Roman slaves first indulged their masters' passion for plants clipped in fanciful forms, topiary's appeal has ebbed and flowed. Judging from flower show exhibits in recent years, we are presently in a flow phase, so it is fortunate that two fine books are now available to guide us. ''Topiary'' by A. M. Clevely has beautifully informative photographs and no-nonsense, equally informative prose. Mr. Clevely's years of clipping, tying, training and generally having his way with yews, junipers and other woody species are evident from his clear directives and detailed lists of suggested plants. Even those with an aversion to wielding shears themselves will enjoy his discourse on the history of this fascinating, occasionally controversial, garden art. ''The Complete Book of Topiary'' is more a craft manual than a classic garden tome, and thus ideal for those who appreciate step-by-step directives for converting their creeping fig or English ivy into a giraffe or spiral. Illustrated throughout with cheerful line drawings printed in green ink and historical snippets set in the margins, the book has a user-friendly exuberance that makes even the most complex topiary trick seem achievable. The ''complete'' in its title notwithstanding, this book's strength is its focus on tender species for indoor display; outdoors, the authors seem less secure. In a volume packed with so much information, though, it is unforgivable that the publisher has chosen to omit an index. PLANTS FOR PROBLEM PLACES. By Graham Rice. Illustrated. 184 pp. (Timber Press, $29.95.) You can give up your home and move to a better garden site, or turn your liabilities into assets. Graham Rice makes a case for the latter in this delightfully written, well-organized primer of 13 nasty garden problems - among them wind, waterlogged soils and shade. A concise analysis of each difficulty is followed by an assortment of mechanical methods (windbreaks and drains, for example) that can be used to alleviate the condition. Culling his vast horticultural store, Mr. Rice then lists a sampling of trees, shrubs, vines and perennials that may be used as problem solvers. In dry shade, for example, there's Oregon grape holly (Mahonia aquifolium), while Solomon's seal (polygonatum) appreciates damp shade. Mr. Rice's droll style itself should lighten the spirits of those disheartened by vexing gardens. THE ART OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN. By Ethne Clarke. Illustrated by Sharon Beeden. 168 pp. (Knopf, $24.95.) KITCHEN HERBS: The Art and Enjoyment of Growing Herbs and Cooking With Them. By Sal Gilbertie. Photographs by Joseph Kugielsky. Recipes by Frances Towner Giedt. 251 pp. (Bantam, $24.95.) Don't be fooled by the title of Ethne Clarke's book, which in no way belies the extent of her exhaustively researched look at the plants that Western man has grown for his table -fruit trees and flowers, vegetables and herbs. Although Ms. Clarke's focus is the period from the Middle Ages to the 18th century, she also liberally intersperses backward glances (as when we learn that the Roman naturalist Pliny ''noted nine types of lettuces . . . some of which had red-tinted leaves'') as well as glimpses of the present (references to the latest cultivars, like Burpee's recently introduced Purple Ruffles basil). There is truly something for everyone in this artfully organized, handsomely illustrated work, which provides advice on everything from training a fruit tree cordon to making potpourri and a 17th-century apple cream. Ms. Clarke has achieved a smooth blending of captivating historical details and solid gardening information. In ''Kitchen Herbs'' by Sal Gilbertie, an aspiring herbal cook can learn from a third-generation nurseryman. Abundant photographs make this book more colorful than Mr. Gilbertie's two previous works, and, as ever, his homespun conversational style makes it a pleasure to learn from him. Nearly three dozen culinary herbs come under scrutiny here, with growing hints and herbal lore informally blended with kitchen advice. One only wishes there were more. Roughly two-thirds of the book is devoted to carefully presented, original herbal recipes, which seem delectable indeed. THE NEW AMERICAN GARDEN. By Carole Ottesen. Illustrated. 148 pp. (Macmillan, $24.95.) THE AMERICAN WEEKEND GARDEN. By Patricia Thorpe. Illustrated. 285 pp. (Random House, $24.95.) American gardeners have turned to flag-waving - a reaction, understandably, not to discomforting trade relations but to the intimidating achievements of their British garden counterparts (that specter of Tories in the perennial patch). Prose with a particularly jingoistic ring may be found in ''The New American Garden'' by Carole Ottesen, whose ideas on an indigenous approach to landscape design are unequivocal. Ms. Ottesen does make a knowledgeable case for the use of native species, such as prairie grasses like Panicum virgatum, as well as planting styles with meadowlike massings that are neither demanding nor environmentally destructive. But her ''manifesto for today's gardener'' (as it's called on the jacket) does grind the patriotic ax a tad heavily. Also, the author's debt to her former employers - Oehme, van Sweden & Associates, who were early vocal advocates of this admittedly inspiring approach -should have been more fully disclosed in both her text and picture credits. In ''The American Weekend Garden,'' Patricia Thorpe takes a similar route, but tempers dogma with a friendlier sell. Just as in her first book, ''Everlastings,'' Ms. Thorpe's sensible ideas are presented in a spirited, flowing style, with first-hand admonitions on coping pragmatically with a tract that must maintain itself while the gardener is elsewhere. There is creative advice on the use of a wide range of sumptuous species, from old roses to woodland primulas and roadside Queen Anne's lace. And she is persuasive in reminding readers of the importance of acquiring a sense of the place they expect to enrich, as well as the time they expect to devote to it. GARDENING BY MAIL 2: A Source Book. By Barbara J. Barton. Unpaged. (Tusker Press/Publishers Group West, Paper, $16.) Giving the lie to the coffeetable book syndrome, one of the year's most useful publications is this unillustrated, uncolorful, unpretentious compendium (originally published in 1986 and now revised and updated), whose subtitle could have been ''Everything You Need to Know to Mail Order Any Garden Object You Could Conceivably Hanker For.'' Using her computer (and private press) in an enterprising manner, Barbara Barton has created the ultimate in reference guides by organizing America's multifarious mail-order services into their most accessible form. With humor and crisply worded data, and cross-references galore, Ms. Barton covers the garden field from acacia seeds to Zingiber (the magazine of the American Ginger Society), with every imaginable hose, hammock and humidifier in between.

As I read through the stories of the hundred or so authors I was considering for inclusion in the book (later published as ''The Art of the Tale''), I began to share my solitude with the voices of many of the masters of the genre, both in the stories at hand and in the echoes they evoked. And so it occurred to me to ask the contributors to the anthology if they might corroborate the identity of those other voices - that is, to list a few of the writers who had in some crucial way influenced their own work.

But they are not persuasive in the case of ''Waldheim: A Commission of Inquiry,'' which can be seen tonight from 8 to 11:30 on the pay-cable service Home Box Office. This is an extraordinary project in several respects, not least because it so carefully avoids even a hint of the sensationalism or exploitation that can be found in so many other television excursions into nonfiction. This is not a docudrama, that often murky form given sometimes questionable shape by writers, directors and actors. No actors are heard here. There is no script. And ''Waldheim: A Commission of Inquiry,'' a co-production of HBO and Britain's Thames Television, is not a trial. Kurt Waldheim, a former Secretary General of the United Nations (1972-82) and now the President of Austria, did not participate in the project. For nine days in April, some 30 survivors of World War II met in a London television studio to testify before an international panel of five jurists. The subject was the already widely publicized allegations of war crimes against Mr. Waldheim. The panel -which included jurists from Great Britain, the United States, West Germany, Sweden and Canada - was being asked to decide, solely on the statements and documents presented, if ''there is enough evidence to warrant an answer by Dr. Kurt Waldheim to allegations that he wrongly participated in acts which were contrary to the international laws of war.''

And Mr. Parker's best album, ''Squeezing Out Sparks'' (1979), somehow never reached the large audience it deserved. At the same time, Mr. Parker has been an extremely inconsistent songwriter, and his chosen style - a mixture of mid-1960's Bob Dylan, late-1960's soul and early-1970's reggae - demands first-rate lyrics that he hasn't always delivered.",1988-06-06T05:00:00+0000

us,A Widening Range of Choices,"Approximate effectiveness of these reversible methods of birth control is measured in pregnancies per 100 actual users per year. DEVICE: Intrauterine devices (Paragard Copper T380A, Progestasert) ACTION: Small plastic or metal devices placed in the uterus that somehow prevent fertilization or implantation; some contain copper, others release hormones. FAILURE RATES: 1-5 ADVANTAGES: Convenient, highly effective, need to be replaced infrequently. DISADVANTAGES: Can cause excess menstrual bleeding and pain; danger of perforation, infection and expulsion; not recommended for those who are childless, not monogamous, or who have had pelvic inflammatory disease; dangerous in pregnancy. DEVICE: Oral contraceptives ACTION: Hormones, either in combination or progestin only, that primarily prevent release of egg. FAILURE RATES: 1-10, depending on type ADVANTAGES: Convenient and highly effective; provide significant noncontraceptive health benefits, such as protection against ovarian and endometrial cancers. DISADVANTAGES: Pills must be taken regularly; possible minor side effects, which new formulations have reduced; not for women with cardiovascular risks, mostly those over 35 who smoke. DEVICE: Condom ACTION: Thin rubber sheath for penis that collects semen. FAILURE RATES: 3-15 ADVANTAGES: Easy to use, effective and inexpensive; protects against some sexually transmitted diseases. DISADVANTAGES: Requires male cooperation, may diminish spontaneity, may deteriorate on the shelf. DEVICE: Diaphragm ACTION: Soft rubber cup that covers entrance to uterus, prevents sperm from reaching egg and holds spermicide. FAILURE RATES: 4-25 ADVANTAGES: No dangerous side effects; reliable if used properly; provides some protection against sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer. DISADVANTAGES: Requires careful fitting; some in convenience associated with insertion and removal; may be dislodged during sex. DEVICE: Cervical cap ACTION: Miniature diaphragm that covers cervix closely, prevents sperm from reaching egg and holds spermicide. FAILURE RATES: Probably comparable to diaphragm. ADVANTAGES: No dangerous side effects; fairly effective; can remain in place longer than diaphragm. DISADVANTAGES: Problems with fitting and insertion; comes in limited number of sizes. DEVICE: Foams, creams, jellies, vaginal suppositories ACTION: Chemical spermicides inserted in vagina before intercourse that also prevent sperm from entering uterus. FAILURE RATES: 10-25 ADVANTAGES: Can be used by anyone who is not allergic; protect against some sexually transmitted diseases; no known side effects. DISADVANTAGES: Relatively unreliable, sometimes messy; must be used 5 to 10 minutes before each act of intercourse. DEVICE: Sponge ACTION: Acts as sperm barrier and releases spermicide. FAILURE RATES: 15-30 ADVANTAGES: Safe; easy to insert; provides some protection against sexually transmitted diseases; can be left in place for 24 hours; needs no fitting. DISADVANTAGES: Relatively unreliable; comes in only one size; some sensitivity and removal problems; cannot be used during menstruation. DEVICE: Implant (Norplant) Not available as birth control in U.S. ACTION: Capsules surgically implanted under skin that slowly release a hormone that blocks release of eggs. FAILURE RATES: 0.3 ADVANTAGES: Very safe, convenient and effective; very long-lasting (five years); may have non-reproductive health benefits like those of oral contraceptives. DISADVANTAGES: Irregular or absent periods; necessity of minor surgical procedure to insert and remove. DEVICE: Injectable contraceptive (Depo-Provera) Unavailable in U.S. ACTION: Injection every three-months of a hormone slowly released from the muscle that prevents ovulation. FAILURE RATES: 1 ADVANTAGES: Convenient and highly effective; no serious side effects other than occasional heavy menstrual bleeding. DISADVANTAGES: Animal studies suggest that it may cause cancer, though new studies of women are mostly encouraging.

A group without a bassist lets members of the audience fill in the bass lines with their imaginations.

What is the easiest way to cover this? A. The peeling is not due to dampness if you used latex paints; since these are water-thinned, they can be applied over damp surfaces.

The leaders are wary of rattling the financial markets or upsetting the economy during an American election campaign, so they plan to tiptoe around their differences over trade, agriculture, Latin American debt and U.S. deficits. [ Page A1. ] The O.E.C.D. warned of inflationary pressures in the U.S. but said the overall economic outlook for the industrial world appeared stronger than it seemed six months ago.

[ D12. ] THE ECONOMY The Government published adjusted foreign-trade figures that make it easier to discern economic trends. The seasonally adjusted figures showed the U.S. trade deficit had narrowed more slowly in the last year than earlier figures had indicated. [ D1. ] U.S. businesses plan to modernize and expand at the fastest rate in four years, according to a Government survey. [ D4. ] COMPANIES Suzuki challenged Consumers Union's suggestion that its Samurai utility vehicle is prone to roll over, presenting its own safety test results.

Page 1 A study of the origins of Stalinism has begun in the Soviet Union. It is a painful process that questions the legitimacy of Communism and the possibility of making it more democratic. 1 Roman and Ukrainian Catholics met in private in Moscow. Two senior Vatican representatives attending millenial celebrations of the Russian Orthodox Church met leaders of the underground Ukrainian church. 6 The level of NATO military spending must be maintained even as tensions relax between Moscow and Washington because changes in Soviet policies have not curbed military growth, members of the organization agreed. 6 News analysis: A peace agreement in Nicaragua was not concluded because rebel leaders hardened their positions in responce to mixed political signals from the Sandinista Government. They agreed to continue observing a cease-fire. 1 Companeros Paul, of Harvard Law 5 A U.S. mission to Central America will be undertaken by Max M. Kampleman, the State Department counselor, to assess conditions in the region after the collapse of peace talks in Nicaragua, the White House said. 5 South Korean police blocked students as they tried to march to the border for a meeting with North Korean students. In Seoul, several thousand students clashed with riot police. 3 The influence of French Protestants, France's most successful minority, has grown with the return to power of the Socialists. Prime Minister Michel Rochard and five of his Cabinet ministers are Protestants. 4 An Islamic regime in Afghanistan would fuel a resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism that would destabilize the region, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India said at the United Nations. 4 South African curbs on reporting of anti-apartheid protests were tightened. The measure requires most local news agencies to register with the Government, but exempts major foreign news agencies. 3 U.S. bars Panamanians who support Noriega 3 Palestinian seized in stabbing of mayor 4 Norway and Israel reach accord on inspecting heavy water 4 National 8-11, 32, 54 Charges against Speaker Jim Wright will be investigated by the House ethics committee, which voted unanimously to conduct the inquiry into Mr. Wright's financial dealings. 1 Producer prices rose again in May, the Government reported. The increase of five-tenths of 1 percent was the third straight monthly rise and was another sign of an extended period of gradually rising inflation, economists said. 1 Death for some drug-related killings was approved overwhelmingly by the Senate. The death penalty would not be mandatory under the legislation, and a unanimous jury vote would be required to impose it. 1 A temporary ban on drug tests was imposed by a California court, which ruled that Matthew Bender & Co. cannot require job applicants at its Oakland office to submit to urine tests as a condition of employment. 39 Limited use of a herbicide, dinoseb, which was found to cause birth defects and sterility in males, will be permited on a temporary basis by the E.P.A. because it said the benefits outweigh the risks. 8 Tenants running a housing project in St. Louis have transformed it from a squalid den for drug dealers into a showcase of ingenuity. They are members of a tenant management movement spreading rapidly across the country. 8 Seattle will cut back school busing for desegregation and will reduce the number of students bused by half under a program, to be in place by 1989, that emphasizes integration within certain neighborhoods. 32 A Presbyterian Church paper opposing nuclear deterrence has met resistance from delegates at the denomination's annual general assembly. The proposed policy has been intensely scrutinized. 8 Slayer of five boys is executed in Utah 8 U.S. ban on Japanese fishing is left standing 9 U.S. nursing panel chief outlines recruting strategy 9 Politics 10 A Senate subcommittee was used by its Democratic chairman to benefit Michael Dukakis's Presidential campaign by criticizing Vice President Bush, the ranking Republican Senator on the panel charged. 10 Jesse Jackson described himself as the Democratic Party's best choice for Vice President, but said that the selection of a running mate was only one of many points he wants to discuss with Michael Dukakis. 10 Regional 33-36 A bill on video terminals was vetoed by the Suffolk County Executive, who said regulation of the terminals in the work place would economically isolate the county and cost it thousands of jobs. 1 Fire attacks on subway token booths have prompted the transit police to form a task force. Three incidents similar to one in which a token booth clerk was burned to death have occurred in the last two days. 33 Joel Steinberg was a cocaine addict who blackmailed people into giving the drug to him, prosecutors told a judge in arguing against bail for the lawyer, who is accused of beating to death the six-year-old girl he illegally adopted. 33 Disturbances in Perth Amboy, N.J., followed the funeral Thursday of a Mexican man shot by an off-duty police officer. Hispanic residents met with city officials after a night of rock and bottle throwing. 33 A lawyer who betrayed three clients by identifying them so they could be robbed by an organized-crime ring was sentenced to seven years in Federal prison.

He showed talent early and became apprenticed to the great New Orleans soprano saxophonist and clarinetist Sidney Bechet. As a young, white follower of New Orleans jazz and swing during the musical upheavals of the 40's that produced modern jazz, Mr. Wilber was something of a throwback, and he found himself as often as not working on the fringes of the jazz world. Musical skill proved to be less elusive than a unique style; Mr. Wilber has spent most of the rest of his career trying to come to terms with the daunting example set by the musicians he idolized. He is candid about the insecurities that have dogged his life. Jazz fans will enjoy the amusing, if somewhat superficial, sketches of Bechet, Eddie Condon, Benny Goodman and others, and the pungent anecdotes of life on the road with various bands. But Mr. Wilber himself never really comes into focus. The book's tone falls somewhere between a confession and a memoir, lacking the intensity and searching honesty necessary to drive the former, and the irony and perspective needed to leaven the latter.",1988-06-12T05:00:00+0000

Even the windows were treated in a nautical fashion -stripped of their moldings and decorated only with mirrored reveals to capture the profiles of neighboring buildings. In choosing the color scheme, Levy also had highly visual images. ''It's meant to look like a black-and-white movie with a few sepia tones thrown in,'' he says. This monochromatic palette was far from a historical allusion. Since Levy spends his days totally immersed in color, his quest for neutrality was an understandable relief. It was also very specific.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"ROCK STAR. By Jackie Collins. (Simon & Schuster, $19.95.) Jackie Collins has made a name for herself as an entertainingly malicious chronicler of the rich and famous. But in her new novel, she leaves her usual international haunts to take on the seamy underside of rock-and-roll, following the lives of three musicians as they work their tortuous way up the ladder to stardom. The result is a curiously flat story that has about as much punch as the lyrics of a bubblegum pop song. Like Ms. Collins's other novels (most recently ''Hollywood Husbands'' and ''Lucky''), ''Rock Star'' is stuffed with sex scandals, drugs, mobsters and stretch limos. Ms. Collins tries to prove she has done her research by gamely dropping names like Eric Clapton, Sam Cooke and the Sex Pistols, but she is clearly not as comfortable or as confident exposing the music business as she is taking on the movie industry. Written in a singsong style that's less bold than that of her previous novels, Ms. Collins's narrative is self-conscious and detached. In fact, you almost get the feeling she was afraid to, as they used to say, get down. Even her trademark steamy sex scenes seem rather prim and restrained, and the rock stars themselves (a legendary English singer and guitar player; a black soul superstar who is a former men's-room attendant; a beautiful, lovelorn mulatto blues singer) have all the dimension of the celebrity cutouts that tourists are photographed with on street corners.

Some women were on tranquillisers and they'd come in for their bread hardly able to make the words come out of their mouths, or count their money or decide what they needed.'' Like Martha Murtagh, Mary Beckett is a wife and mother and a Roman Catholic raised in Belfast, although the 62-year-old writer has lived for many years in Dublin. Despite the book's setting, don't expect it to provide sensationalism or political intrigue. Instead, this short, thoughtful first novel is almost homey in tone as it considers the mundane ways that Northern Ireland's violence affects its ordinary citizens. Ms. Beckett skims through Martha Murtagh's life from the ''backstreets and boglands'' of her girlhood to a loveless marriage made ''because I could see no other future for me,'' all the way up to her ultimate dilemma: whether or not to countenance the atrocities committed by the I.R.A. American readers may find the choppy cadences of the novel's prose a bit difficult to get used to; they may also feel that Ms. Beckett doesn't entirely solve the problem of describing a constricted life without letting her narrative become monotonous. But in Martha Murtagh, whose qualities are skillfully balanced between the average and the exceptional, she conceives a character that rings tellingly true. ''Give Them Stones'' provides a subtle perspective on a stormy situation; it's a view of a troubled country that's well worth noting.",1988-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"MODERN PAINTERS. By John Ruskin. Edited by David Barrie. (Knopf, $45.) Although the five volumes of ''Modern Painters'' are ostensibly a treatise on art, they chronicle John Ruskin's progress from young evangelistic esthete to wearied socialistic philosopher. In gorgeous, vivid, unhurried prose, Ruskin composed an ambitious, far-ranging essay that constitutes one of the great literary works on painting. It has now been republished in a one-volume, 656-page edition abridged by David Barrie, a British diplomat. Roughly half the work has been cut; gone are many digressions and repetitions. This welcome version, with an informative introduction by the editor, provides enough to acquaint the general reader with the once influential, now neglected critic and philosopher. Ruskin brought a consuming passion for art to ''Modern Painters,'' whose early pages especially are charged with the zeal of a young, overconfident thinker. The first volume was published in 1843 and met with mixed reviews. Years later, Ruskin himself looked back rather disdainfully on the pretension and puritanism that characterized it. By the time he wrote the darkly colored yet still deeply religious final volume in 1860, he had become both more tolerant of sensuality in painting and less confident of the social value of art criticism. His admiration for Turner's paintings, which had originally inspired ''Modern Painters,'' never waned, and at the close of the work he mused on what Turner might have produced had the artist been nurtured by the admiration that was his due: ''Soft as Correggio's, solemn as Titian's, the enchanted colour would have glowed, imperishable and pure; and the subtle thoughts risen into loftiest teaching, helpful for centuries to come.''",1988-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"MY MOTHER'S SIN: And Other Stories. By Georgios Vizyenos. Translated by William F. Wyatt Jr. (University Press of New England, Cloth, $20; Paper, $10.95.) This collection of six stories will introduce readers to the neglected work of a 19th-century writer who has been credited with establishing literary realism in Greek fiction. Georgios Vizyenos (1849-1896) was born in a Thracian village that today is part of the European province of Turkey. Despite his humble origins, he earned two doctorates and traveled widely. His first short story - the title piece of this collection and his best-known work - was published in 1883 and probes, over a 28-year period, a peasant woman's heart-wrenching attempt to atone for the accidental death of her only daughter. Like this story, each of the six tales in ''My Mother's Sin'' offers a telling portrait of rural life. Each is told by an involved narrator and each proposes something of a mystery or paradox, starting immediately with the title itself. (What indeed were ''The Consequences of the Old Story''? What happened on a ship ''Between Peiraeus and Naples''?) The tour de force of the collection, ''Moscov-Selim,'' is a tale of an aging Turkish soldier whose service in the sultan's wars has cost him everything except his faith and dignity - a sympathetic portrait of a historic adversary that is virtually unheard-of for a Greek writer of any era. In all, William F. Wyatt Jr.'s able translation of Vizyenos's seamless blending of ritual, folklore, earthy humor, striking descriptions and unexpected irony makes for a significant contribution to world literature.",1988-06-12T05:00:00+0000

Consisting of solos created by Ms. King between 1935 and '63, the program was a pleasure to watch because of its choreographic craftsmanship. What made that pleasure unexpected was the fact that, although references to Ms. King occur in many books on modern dance, until this concert her works were largely unknown to most of today's dance audience. The retrospective brought old dances to new life. Ms. King, who is 82 years old, studied in New York with two modern-dance pioneers, Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman. She joined their company at its founding in 1928 and remained with it until 1935. She also started presenting programs of her own choreography during the 30's. She established a company in Seattle in 1943 and from 1951 to '71 taught at the University of Arkansas. She now lives in Santa Fe, N.M.",1988-06-12T05:00:00+0000

I worked in the banana fields on the border and on the kibbutz's fishing boat, which was occasionally shot at by Syrians from their position at the crest of the heights. In June 1966, two weeks after I left the kibbutz for Paris, the war broke out that led to Israel's occupation of the heights as well as the West Bank, Gaza, Sinai and Jerusalem. At the time, I was elated, though soon after, when the seizure of land became a goal of permanent occupation, I began to have my doubts. I remembered very clearly that Arabs within the country, as well as non-Ashkenazi Jews, were treated -to put it kindly - as second-class citizens. When I spent Christmas in Nazareth at the home of an Arab family (it was impossible to find a room in town), I listened to their distress about being virtual prisoners in the land of their birth, required to carry passes in order to move around the country. I listened to Jewish comments about Arabs: heard the racism and was shocked by it. And I felt, while I lived there, that my concern about these attitudes was in some way unacceptable.

With a few exceptions, a call contested by a manager is usually verified by instant replay and yet because of false pride or a brotherhood amongst the umpires a changed call becomes as rare as a kosher stadium hot dog. Is a manager supposed to sit back and let a bad call decide the outcome of a close game?

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"FRIENDS, RUSSIANS, AND COUNTRYMEN. By Hampton Howard. (St. Martin's, $15.95.) The United States intelligence agents who are portrayed in ''Friends, Russians, and Countrymen'' are too eccentric, too literate and too wisecracking actually to work for the American Government, but this is the only unpersuasive element in an otherwise colorful and fast-moving thriller. ''Soviet equity'' - that is, a spy - has been found in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, working out of New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematics. But rather than capture him, the C.I.A. inititates an operation to feed him disinformation. Ed Stuarti, a flamboyant 70-year-old intelligence veteran who played a bit part in Mr. Howard's previous novel, ''War Toys,'' runs this baroque con game from his West 13th Street safe house. Among the members of his cast are Tom Matthews, an anguished, burned-out agent; Harold-Who-Does-the-Disgusting-Things, a contract worker who, for reasons of national security, was once flown to Vienna to throw up on a mailman; and scores of F.B.I. agents dressed as Hasidim and basketball players so as to look plausibly New Yorkish. A modern spy, Stuarti is fully aware of the statutory prohibition against conducting C.I.A. operations in Greenwich Village, and he employs as much forethought duping Congressional oversight committees as he does the Russians. Hampton Howard writes convincing, jargon-rich spy dialogue, as well as archly elliptical descriptions. The novel concludes with a surprising revelation about the target of Stuarti's deception, a plot twist that may give pause to readers concerned about C.I.A. involvement in political affairs.",1988-06-12T05:00:00+0000

Famous dull dogs abound in literature, but even the cur in ''A Dog of Flanders'' is full of surprises compared to Alligator, the pit bull of Scott Ely's second novel. Imagine a canine Rambo with a foul smell, and you've got him. Alligator may be ''dead game'' - the sporting term for a dog who'll fight to the death - but he's also dead boring. Even so, he doesn't deserve what happens to him by the end of this book. Neither do we. Nor, maybe, does Mr. Ely, who started with some promising ingredients: a father and son bitterly divided over the loss of their family farm and how to get it back, a whole Mississippi town (from woman mayor to preacher to black school principal) involved in a scheme to recoup everyone's fortunes by raising a monster marijuana crop, and a blonde in emerald earrings, hooking her way through nursing school, who decides she'd rather be a herpetologist. The main trouble is that none of these characters is real enough to care about, one way or the other. The son wishes the father violently dead on page 7 and frequently thereafter, but by the end of the first scene it's quite clear that nothing can ever come of their sullen strife beyond tepid reconciliation. Mr. Ely's prose is laconic to the point of shorthand, and when a character gets off a halfway good line it's repeated, parrotlike, every time the character reappears. Pavlovian symbolism abounds: whenever the son's shrapnel scars itch, for example, the reader is supposed to be conditioned to think, ''Ah, yes, Viet-Vet Syndrome.''",1988-06-12T05:00:00+0000

As the film maker spoke - intense, visibly moved -there was a sense of deja vu. One was reminded of Nadezhda Mandelstam in Moscow telling in 1962 how in the 30's she had concealed the poems of her husband, Osip Mandelstam, in the saucepan from which she was then serving soup. Like the preservation of Mandelstam's poetry, that of Mr. Askoldov's film was a gift to Russian culture by a heroic wife. ''Commissar'' is a black-and-white movie in the great tradition of the early Soviet cinema, blending its constructivist legacy with a modern sensibility. The film deals honestly and compassionately with the fate of Jews in the Soviet Union and, by extension, in the modern world.",1988-06-12T05:00:00+0000

Rains in some farm areas in May; abnormally dry weather in northern Great Plains, Southeast and Middle Atlantic states. 1982 - No extensive areas of drought as cool Canadian air helped produce active rain fronts most of the summer. 1983 - Searing heat in July and August, with severe drought east of the Rockies, similar to 1980 but centered slightly farther north, in the western corn belt states. Corn and soybean crops severely damaged. Dryness extended to the Middle-Atlantic States. Less than one-quarter of normal rainfall in parts of Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa and Illinois. 1984 - More than $1 billion in wheat crops damaged in Montana and North Dakota when rainfall was only one-third of normal in the first half of the year. Many brush fires. Persistent dryness damaged crops and grasslands in central Texas. 1985 - Dry conditions led to serious brush and forest fires in California, the northern Rockies and Northern Plains. 1986 - The Southeast sweltered under dry conditions that began the previous autumn. Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee suffer a drought described as the worst in more than a century; less than one-quarter the normal rain in some areas. Some relief from August rains for soybean crops, but it was too late for hay and corn. Regional damage estimates topped $1 billion. 1987 - Forest fires scorched more than two million acres in Idaho, Washington, Oregon and California. Water shortages in Spokane and some other communities. Hot, dry conditions in July and August also contributed to drought conditions in the Southeast, reducing crop yields sharply.

Excess moisture can cause wood to warp, appliances to rust and wallpaper to peel, not to mention unpleasant odors and mold. Dehumidifiers can eliminate most excess water, and a wide selection is available. When choosing a dehumidifier, look for easy-to-use controls; a spillproof, easily carried container to catch the runoff; automatic shut-off, and maneuverablity. Dehumidifiers should be mounted on wheels or rollers so they can be moved easily. Dehumidifiers cost about $100 to $300. Most important is the water-removal capacity. The table indicates the dehumidification required, stated as the pints of water to be removed in 24 hours, for areas of three different sizes. *3*Area in square feet 500 1,000 1,500 *3*Pints to be removed Without dehumidifier *3*in 24 hours Moderately damp 10 14 18 Very damp 12 17 22 Wet 14 20 26 Extremely wet 16 23 30 (Source: Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers)",1988-06-18T05:00:00+0000

Economists say the seven leaders will need to do little tinkering. Page 1 Muscovites hectored a comrade, a conservative editor, at a meeting called after they learned he would represent their district at the coming national Communist Party conference. 1 Jewish immigration to Israel has slowed in recent years, with many Soviet Jews choosing to go to the United States instead. Israel is beginning to call the situation an immigration crisis. 1 Haiti's President dismissed the commander in chief of the Haitian Army and two other generals. President Leslie Manigat accused Lieut. Gen. Henri Namphy and two other members of the general staff of insubordination. 1 Britain ordered an Israeli expelled after discovering that Mossad, the Israeli secret service, ran a double-agent intelligence operation aimed at Palestinian terrorists. 5 High technology at Harrow School, one of England's oldest, has become part of the curriculum. Harrow has increased course requirements in science and is encouraging students to develop business skills. 4 Manila is condoning rights abuses, according to some groups monitoring the situation. Partly under pressure from the military, President Corazon C. Aquino has backed away from the issue of protecting human rights. 2 Six people face trial in Zimbabwe on charges of carrying out bombings and assassination attempts for South Africa. The case may provide extensive evidence of South African efforts to destabilize the country. 3 Brazil's President dismissed the Chief of Staff of the armed forces after he criticed the Government's economic policy. It was President Jose Sarney's first move against the military establishment. 3 Mexican political opponents debated in San Diego. An associate of the presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party responded to criticism from leaders of parties on the right and the left. 28 U.N. experts will enter Afghanistan next month to begin rebuilding the economy and caring for returning refugees, a U.N. official says. The teams will work first in areas where fighting has stopped. 4 National 6-8, 15, 50 A plan to end ''patient dumping,'' proposed by Federal officials, would require all hospitals with emergency rooms to examine all patients who seek treatment and to treat all those who need medical care. 1 A lack of leadership at the E.P.A. and a poorly trained work force are weakening the agency's cleanup of hazardous waste sites, according to a study by Congress's Office of Technology Assessment. 1 Officials named two lawmakers, Representative Roy Dyson and Representative Bill Chappell Jr., as being under investigation in the Federal inquiry into bribery and fraud in military procurement at the Pentagon. 1 Five men rescued after five months at sea in a disabled boat arrived in Hawaii on a Japanese tuna boat, which found the Costa Rican fisherman adrift in the Pacific about 700 miles southeast of Honolulu. 1 Business is good for midstreamers, watergoing suppliers of food and fuel to barges, at the southern end of the Missississippi River. Record-low water levels have slowed barge traffic to a crawl. 6 Protection of AIDS patients against discrimination in the private sector was narrowly endorsed by the Presidential commission on AIDS, which voted to include the proposal in its final report to President Reagan. 6 A local law limiting newspaper sales was overturned by the Supreme Court, 4 to 3. The ordinance, adopted by Lakewood, Ohio, allowed the mayor to decide which newspapers could place news racks on public property. 8 Traditional names for new moons discovered around Uranus will be given by the International Astronomical Union. It rejected proposals to name the moons for the seven astronauts killed in the Challenger. 15 Texaco's proxy fight is too close to call, analysts say. Management and Carl Icahn have claimed victory. Mr. Icahn, the company's largest shareholder, is seeking election to the company's board to press his takeover bid. 33 Alabama N.A.A.C.P. chief indicted in bribery scheme 7 South hears 2 versions of the Dukakis record 7 Administration is uncertain on welfare compromise 8 Regional 29-31 Renovation beneath Times Square will proceed under a plan to spend about $125 million on modernizing one of the city's oldest and dirtiest subway complexes with elevators, new entrances and clean open areas. 29 Drugs on two Upper West Side blocks are another sign that New York City's drug crisis is out of control. On a block of West 94th Street, dealers sell marijuana. On a block of West 92d Street, dealers sell crack. 29 Rent increases were approved for leases on rent-stabilized apartments in New York City. The Rent Guidelines Board passed increases of 6 percent for one-year leases and 9 percent for two-year leases. 29 Robert Abrams castigated advisers to Tawana Brawley for vilifying a former associate who called their account of Miss Brawley's case a fabrication. Federal investigators interviewed the associate, Perry McKinnon. 30 New York City halted physical tests for prospective firefighters after the death of an applicant who collapsed on June 11 after taking the test.

us,Gay Fiction Comes Home,"DURING this century, a few lonely voices -not all of them gay males - have created landmark fiction about the homosexual experience. One thinks of Thomas Mann, E. M. Forster, Andre Gide, Jean Genet, Christopher Isherwood, William Burroughs, Gore Vidal, Carson McCullers, James Baldwin. But in the last few decades, these singular voices have blended into a larger chorus. In fact, gay literature has broadened into a general, if controversial, category with clearly definable patterns. To oversimplify the matter, we could say that gay writing has changed since World War II from a literature of guilt and apology to one of political defiance and celebration of sexual difference. But in the last few years it has eased into more private matters, family relations and the search for domestic contentment. Even AIDS hasn't stopped the progression toward self-acceptance and socialization in gay stories and novels. There may be little or no sleeping around (unless the tale is set in a pre-plague era) but there are plenty of characters - friends, relatives, schoolmates, colleagues -who find homosexuality interesting but hardly news, and certainly no reason why a protagonist should duck the basic quest for love, status, power, a mate, career and so forth. (I'm speaking here of fiction about gay males only.) Nowadays, a gay novel rarely explains, complains or apologizes. It assumes that ignorance about homosexuality is a thing of the past and that bigotry signifies either a poor education or a retrograde conscience. Where Zeke Farragut in John Cheever's ''Falconer'' (1977) had to go to jail to discover his love for another man, to learn ''the utter poverty of erotic reasonableness'' (jail presumably being the ideal container for his illegal impulses), the new writers of gay fiction prefer different settings entirely.

In 1981 the world's largest automobile company installed as its chief executive a man who had never participated in the design, engineering, manufacture or marketing of a car. The results of that action have since become clear. When Roger B. Smith took over as chairman of the General Motors Corporation, roughly half of all the cars sold in the United States were made by G.M. Last year, the company's share of the market was down to about one-third. While Mr. Smith was busy acquiring high-tech properties and redrawing the corporate organization chart, G.M. seemed to forget it was in the automobile business. One after another, it introduced new models of cars with uninspired styling and indifferent performance. Customers defected to other makers. Unfortunately, Albert Lee, a onetime speechwriter at G.M., has chosen to depict Mr. Smith as a two-dimensional bogyman, without giving him credit for being willing to take bold actions to rebuild the company. G.M. did need to be shaken up to cope with the globalization of the auto industry. As open as he is to criticism for product failures and public relations gaffes, Mr. Smith may one day be praised for helping to rebuild the nation's manufacturing base with massive investments in new technology. Also, labor relations have been improved and strategic alliances with other companies negotiated. A proper assessment of Mr. Smith's tenure at the top of G.M. cannot be made until well after he retires in 1990. This is, at best, an interim report on a process still very much under way.",1988-06-19T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"TELL ME WHY: A Beatles Commentary. By Tim Riley. (Knopf, $19.95.) In ''Tell Me Why,'' a labor of loving obsession, Tim Riley minutely examines the music of the Beatles. A better title might be ''Tell Me How,'' because Mr. Riley, a pianist and composer born in 1960, generally steers clear of biography and social history; he concentrates on the artifacts - the recordings - rather than the artists. Song by song, he notes the subtleties of craft and inspiration that keep the Beatles' recordings contemporary, illuminating music so familiar it's often taken for granted. Mr. Riley is remarkably attentive. He follows not just lyrics, melodies and chord progressions but the textural elements - essential to understanding rock - that don't show up in sheet music: bass and drum parts, shifts in instrumentation, vocal inflections. In fact, ''Tell Me Why'' works best as program notes for serious listening to the Beatles' albums; the author shines a spotlight on the songs' most important details. His larger-scale observations, though, aren't always so convincing. While Mr. Riley has no patience with George Harrison, for him John Lennon and Paul McCartney can do little wrong. He is remarkably perceptive about the ironic nuances of the early love songs but labors mightily to make sense of psychedelic non sequiturs. He also has a Beatles-centered perspective; about ''The Word'' Mr. Riley writes, ''That the Beatles had publicly denounced Vietnam made this song relevant in ways pop had never been before,'' implicitly dismissing the likes of ''Blowin' in the Wind'' or ''Eve of Destruction,'' if not Woody Guthrie. ''Tell Me Why'' isn't the last word on the Beatles. But it brings new insight to the act we've known for all these years.",1988-06-19T05:00:00+0000

us,GOOD GOODS,"BICYCLES: One of the newest fashions in cycling is mounting a rugged machine with fat, puncture-resistant tires and taking off cross-country where the more svelte racing bikes would never go. Mountain biking aficionados can be found on primitive trails in the national forests, laboring over rocky tracks in the desert or merely taking city streets in a new style. The StumpJumper Epic, built by Specialized Bicycle Components of Morgan Hill, Calif., is constructed of a variety of high-tech materials. The frame is carbon fiber, which saves 1.5 pounds in weight, not a trivial amount for rushing up a steep trail. A high-quality steel alloy appears at crucial points. Just as in another era Henry Ford's horseless carriages came in one color - black - the StumpJumper Epic comes in a single color. Carbon. SADDLES: Ask a dedicated equestrian about the dream saddle, and one name crops up more than any other - Hermes. In 1837, Thierry Hermes began making leather harnesses for the French coachmakers in Paris. Later, when he entered the retail trade, Hermes produced as his first item a saddle. To this day, each saddle is handmade in the Hermes ateliers above the flagship store at 24 rue Faubourg St. Honore in Paris. What's so special about the saddles? Riders want close contact with the horse, to feel its every movement. Much of horsemanship is communication between the horse and rider through subtle pressure from the rider's legs. When they speak of a Hermes saddle, riders talk about supple leather that provides close contact. Although many riders contend that other saddlemakers have become equally adept at creating the same sort of close touch with the horse, the Hermes saddle still possesses an undeniable cachet. RACQUETS: Tennis racquets are a very individual piece of equipment. Grip size, head size, degree of flex, string type and string tension are all vital. Seeking to cater to the tennis buff's whims, Prince Manufacturing has come up with what it cheerfully calls the world's most exclusive racquet - the Sovereign. Those who order it will face an array of decisions. What size head - 90 or 110 square inches of strung racquet? What type flex - medium or firm? What about balance point - there are six options. For strings, the choices range from synthetic gut to graphite gut to natural gut. Moreover, strings come in five colors. Then there are tension and weight. Grip size has eight selections. The racquet itself comes in any of four colors, and there are four other colors for the grip. A Sovereign medallion to adorn the creation comes in four choices. Finally, the buyer's signature is emblazoned on the side of the shaft. The final product is shipped in a wooden crate. The price is a mere $1,000. WINDSURFERS: For the racing board sailor, the true windsurfing loonie, Ultra Cat, manufactured by Fanatic, a West German company, and marketed in the United States by Fanatic Ltd., is the ultimate in high-tech and high-speed (the photograph, above, is unintentionally reversed). Made from epoxy and carbon fiber wrapped around an expanded polystyrene core, Ultra Cat is 12 feet, 4 inches long and has a double concave bottom with edges slightly tucked under.

Rotter's interest in how the United States became involved in Southeast Asia developed while he was an undergraduate participating in antiwar demonstrations; he continued to pursue the question through graduate school and during his early years of college teaching (he now teaches history at Vanderbilt University). The answers he found were far more complex and paradoxical than he had expected. The contradictions in American policy appeared right after World War II, when the uneasy alliance with the Soviet Union broke apart. Faced by a powerful new enemy, American policy makers began taking desperate measures to rebuild the shattered economies of Japan and Europe. Southeast Asia not only offered an alternative market for Japanese and European manufactured goods, but was also a source of important raw materials. To protect this valuable region from what was seen as a monolithic and growing Communist empire, the United States reversed its traditional anticolonialist position and supported France's and Britain's efforts to retain their holds on Indochina and Malaysia. When the French were finally forced out, Mr. Rotter concludes, the United States took over their role. None of these arguments are new, but the author has done an exhaustive job of research. His political-economic approach is so narrow, however, that it excludes other explanations and, along with the academic style of his prose, makes this book of more value to the scholar than to the general reader.",1988-06-19T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"AT THE PALACES OF KNOSSOS. By Nikos Kazantzakis. Translated by Themi Vasils and Theodora Vasils. (Ohio University, Cloth, $19.95; Paper, $9.95.) One cannot know what Nikos Kazantzakis would have thought of this posthumously edited version of a novel he wrote in the late 1930's for serialization in an Athenian youth periodical. But those who are familiar with his novels ''Zorba the Greek'' and ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' will vicariously feel his disappointment. ''At the Palaces of Knossos'' is a retelling of the myth of Theseus, a prince of ancient Athens who is sent as a sacrificial tribute to King Minos of Crete and ultimately overthrows him. Symbolically, it is a tale of the birth of a new age through the deposing of an old and obsolete order. Certainly, at the time Kazantzakis wrote the novel this myth had special significance, since Greece was struggling to recover its independence in a modern world. But as the story unfolds here, Kazantzakis never succeeds in breathing fresh life into these ancient personages; his characters never become more than clumsy symbols of various vices and virtues. But more problematical than the shortcomings of the novel are the intentions of Kazantzakis's translators, Theodora and Themi Vasils, who edited and abridged his unpublished, and certainly unfinished, first draft. Would he have ultimately overcome the limitations of telling a familiar story as he did so successfully in his other historical novels? Or did he set this one aside, knowing it was less than what he aspired to?

us,Answering The Mail,"Q. I am interested in buying a house that has asbestos shingles on the outside. I fear that rain might cause leaching of the asbestos into the ground or make it airborne. Is there a health hazard with asbestos siding? A. I don't believe so, not as long as the shingles are on the outside and you are not cutting, sanding or otherwise abrading or breaking up the shingles. Asbestos is only a hazard when the fibers become airborne, and this does not seem a likely problem with exterior shingles. Q. My 45-year-old vacation home in the mountains is made of wood logs that have been treated every few years with creosote. However, creosote has been banned in this state. What preservative can I use over this? A. Any of the currently available wood preservatives can be used over the creosote after it has weathered for several years, but the dark color imparted by creosote will show through on the new coating. Q. How can I remove adhesive tape residue left when the tape was peeled off glossy Formica furniture without scratching the shiny surface on this furniture? A. The adhesive can be wiped off with a solvent such as lighter fluid or rubber cement thinner (sold in art supply stores).

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"TAPESTRY. By Belva Plain. (Delacorte, $18.95.) In ''Tapestry,'' the best-selling novelist Belva Plain returns with a new installment in the saga of the Roth and Werner families. But while fans of ''Evergreen'' and ''The Golden Cup'' may be eager for more, to the uninitiated reader it often seems as if everything really interesting has already happened in the series' previous two volumes. The story here begins in 1920 with the patriarch-to-be Paul Werner awaiting the birth of his first child. Not only is the baby born dead, but in the aftermath his wife, Marian, must undergo a hysterectomy. This sets the stage for Paul's dissatisfaction with his lot in life, which leads him to several affairs and many fleeting thoughts about his one true love (whom he met in a previous book) and the child of their illicit union. Of course, the Roths also have their entanglements. Having given all his money to his grandson because he felt it had been made (in a previous book) in a less than honorable way, Dan Roth chooses to live a new life of humble purity. However, his daughter-in-law, Leah (widowed in a previous book), is neither humble nor pure, and her philanderings, including a dalliance with Paul Werner, provide some of the novel's more interesting diversions. As World War II looms larger, the characters participate in crucial historic events, give away money to good causes and debate the meaning of their identity as Jews. In the end, though, despite her ambitious plotting, Belva Plain has produced a serviceable saga that lives, if at all, only in the shadow of her earlier books.",1988-06-19T05:00:00+0000

In Julian Jay Savarin's ninth novel, David Pross, a former Royal Air Force helicopter pilot now operating a small but profitable charter business in Wales, is persuaded against his will to undertake a dangerous mission for one of those supersecret, all-powerful government agencies that abound in spy fiction. The persuader is Logan, a lovely bit of crumpet with whom we are led to believe he has had a slap-and-tickle on an earlier mission, despite the wife and kiddies at home. Thus far, ''Gunship'' seems to be a predictable mixture. But Mr. Savarin, a British writer of thrillers, gives his novel a twist by peopling it with unusual and believable characters, nasty and otherwise, of varying degrees of dedication. Furthermore, on Pross's mission no one is ever what he or she seems to be. His major antagonist, Major Anakov, is a Russian helicopter pilot whom Pross must meet in a clash of superchoppers. En route to the dueling ground, however, there is some plain and fancy intrigue in which the British are every bit as unprincipled as the K.G.B. On the ground in Wales, at Greenham Common or in Berlin, the suspense is well sustained, and friend and foe are disposed of in imaginatively macabre ways. But the flying scenes are where Mr. Savarin excels, turning out pulse-pounding and very realistic scenes of high-tech helicopter flying.",1988-06-19T05:00:00+0000

us,THE HEALTH SYSTEM'S LIMITS: Three Veiws; Determining How Much Care Society Owes the Dying,"CONGRESS this month passed the first major expansion of the Medicare program, the so-called catastrophic health care bill, which is designed to shield elderly Americans from financial ruin by huge medical bills. President Reagan is expected to sign the measure, perhaps this week. The bill, which would become effective Jan. 1, has wide support because it would provide increased health care insurance for the elderly. But it has also become part of a complex, emotional debate over the advancing medical technology. The growing concern centers on the question of when and to what extent doctors should use the many death-thwarting machines and techniques available today. In a pluralistic society that values life and individual choice, what are the limits? How much should society spend to extend by a few days or months a life that would otherwise end sooner? Which patients should get such care at public expense? Andrew H. Malcolm, a reporter for The New York Times, discussed the subject separately with three experts.

Deficits and surpluses All will probably agree on the need to do something about the American budget and trade deficits and the West German and Japanese trade surpluses, which impede steady growth of the world economy. But the imbalances have been receding a bit, and this leaves the leaders free to do little more than reaffirm past promises. Trade The leaders can be expected to voice opposition to protectionism, though all seven countries practice it and the United States appears close to enacting a more protectionist trade law. Specific commitments to relax restraints will be relegated to a 96-nation trade meeting in Montreal in December. Farming The leaders will consider President Reagan's proposal to ban by the year 2000 the subsidies that governments give farmers to help them export their goods. Western European countries, with proportionately more farmers than the United States, are opposed. Third world debt The leaders are expected to agree to set easier terms for the loans they have made to the poorest African countries. On the far larger question of the Latin American debt, they will probably only reconfirm their commitment to the market-oriented strategy of Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d. The dollar and gold Pleased about the dollar's current stability, the leaders will try to avoid disputes about interest rates and other matters that could unsettle the markets. They are also expected to say that they will use the price of gold to help them see if inflation is rising and if they should revalue their currencies accordingly. Some people see this as a step back toward the gold standard. Other issues Among noneconomic subjects expected to receive attention are President Reagan's recent talks with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the tightening of sanctions against South Africa, the deterioration of the earth's ozone layer, education and Mr. Reagan's effort to stop drug traffickers from using Western banks.",1988-06-19T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"ONE HALF OF THE SKY: Stories From Contemporary Women Writers of China. Translated by R. A. Roberts and Angela Knox. (Dodd, Mead, $16.95.) Modern Chinese literature, unlike Chinese food, is rarely served to the American public and perhaps on that account this book should be welcomed. The stories in ''One Half of the Sky'' date from the 1920's to the 70's, with some interesting developments from the 80's not included, so the ''contemporary'' in its subtitle, ''Stories From Contemporary Women Writers of China,'' is a little misleading. These works were originally part of a Chinese selection of women's fiction published in Canton, from which R. A. Roberts and Angela Knox, the Australian and English translators, made their own selections. They range from Bing Xin's ''Loneliness,'' a 1922 cameo of a little boy's sad universe, to ''Sketches From the 'Cattle Shed,' '' a 1979 recollection of the horrors of solitary confinement by China's most famous woman writer, Ding Ling. Frances Wood, a British sinologist, provides an introduction, and there are also brief biographies of each writer that seem to have been lifted straight from the Chinese original. Unfortunately, the translations feature a decidedly British phrasing, thus increasing the distance that already exists between American readers and Chinese writers. In addition, although these occasionally moving stories provide a window into the Chinese world, most of them suffer from sentimentality and the political ''new-speak'' that is endemic to so much modern Chinese fiction. Often puzzling to the uninitiated, they could have been made much less so if the introduction and biographies had been more elaborate - and, most important, if notes had been provided.",1988-06-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Answering The Mail,"Q. I am interested in buying a house that has asbestos shingles on the outside. I fear that rain might cause leaching of the asbestos into the ground or make it airborne. Is there a health hazard with asbestos siding? A. I don't believe so, not as long as the shingles are on the outside and you are not cutting, sanding or otherwise abrading or breaking up the shingles. Asbestos is only a hazard when the fibers become airborne, and this does not seem a likely problem with exterior shingles. Q. My 45-year-old vacation home in the mountains is made of wood logs that have been treated every few years with creosote. However, creosote has been banned in this state. What preservative can I use over this? A. Any of the currently available wood preservatives can be used over the creosote after it has weathered for several years, but the dark color imparted by creosote will show through on the new coating. Q. How can I remove adhesive tape residue left when the tape was peeled off glossy Formica furniture without scratching the shiny surface on this furniture? A. The adhesive can be wiped off with a solvent such as lighter fluid or rubber cement thinner (sold in art supply stores).

Ligachev, the No. 2 party leader, as an obstructionist; Yeltsin announces his resignation as Moscow party chief and is later dropped from Politburo. Caution sets in among the perestroika vanguard. Nov. 2 - Gorbachev gives a cautious speech marking the revolution's 70th anniversary. Nevertheless, it opens the floodgates for attacks on Stalin. Jan. 1 - Sixty percent of Soviet industry is given financial autonomy, but bureaucracy impedes change; consumers see no immediate gains. Feb. 5 - Nikolai I. Bukharin, a Bolshevik leader executed by Stalin, is rehabilitated as a perestroika hero, the champion of the socialism that might have been, without Stalin. Feb. 28 - Thirty-two people are killed in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, as territorial dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan presents Gorbachev with his worst domestic political crisis. March 13 - With Gorbachev out of town, a letter in Sovetskaya Rossiya, signed by a Leningrad teacher but bearing Ligachev's fingerprints, rails against Western influence, blackening of Soviet history and permissiveness. For three weeks no one dares respond; panic spreads among liberals. April 5 - Pravda publishes a Gorbachev-inspired rebuttal, a resounding call for change, and advocates of change rush again to the front lines.

us,On the Danube,"To the Editor: I read with interest the article on the Danube Princess (Travel, March 20). Having made the Danube cruise on that ship two years ago, we would agree that it is a pleasing itinerary and the Danube Princess is generally a good river cruise vessel. I can't help wondering, however, whether the operation still suffers from some inadequacies that we experienced: (1) no life jackets on board; (2) student dining room personnel who, despite enthusiasm and pleasantness, were quite untrained and unable to serve simultaneously the four persons at our table, and (3) a musical ensemble for dancing that was so discordant that people avoided the salon. When we asked why there were no life preservers, the cruise director said that the ship never gets that far from shore so they would be unnecessary! LARRY ALTHOUSE Dallas Fred A. Mayer, president of Exprinter Danube Cruises replies: It is correct that there are no life jackets on board the Danube Princess, but that is by design. The Danube is a very shallow river with a depth of only 2 to 2.5 meters. The Danube Princess was specifically designed to sail on the Danube. It has a draft of 1.7 meters and glides over a space of about 30 to 80 centimeters depending upon the water level. Hence, under any consideration the ship cannot sink; it can only fall by 30 to 80 centimeters. The life-saving equipment that is aboard the ship is in full compliance with strict West German shipping guidelines. It would be both unnecessary and possibly dangerous to use life-saving equipment designed for high seas on a shallow river.",1988-06-26T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT, CONGRESS, AND JUDICIARY. Edited by William T. Golden. (Pergamon, Cloth, $49.95; Paper, $24.95.) The golden age of scientific advice to the President, by most accounts, started when the Soviet launching of Sputnik 1 in 1957 led President Eisenhower to appoint the first White House science adviser and continued through the Kennedy years. In that era, an eminent scientist always served as a full-time adviser to the President, and a panel of distinguished scientists came to town periodically to render additional advice. For the scientists involved, these were heady times when their views received respectful attention. But later the advisory apparatus was largely dismantled by President Nixon, and then restored at a less prestigious level by succeeding Presidents. Today the science adviser toils in obscurity, backed up by a part-time panel that reports to him, not to the President. Now comes this collection of some 85 essays (edited by William T. Golden, president of the New York Academy of Sciences) whose avowed purpose is ''to attract attention to the necessity for quality advice on science and technology issues to the President of the United States, to the Congress, and to the Judiciary.'' The authors are mostly people who have served as part of the Government science advisory apparatus or as close observers of it. Not surprisingly, most favor a stronger science advisory organization at the White House. However, some challenge the notion that today's system is weak or propose new solutions, such as a Cabinet-level Secretary of Science. With few exceptions, the essays are abstract and highly repetitive of one another. The specialist will find most of the arguments familiar; the generalist will find the case asserted rather than proved.",1988-06-26T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE FOURTH CODEX. By Robert Houston. (Houghton Mifflin, $17.95.) Traditionally, the United States Customs Service has not enjoyed a high profile in international crime thrillers, but ''The Fourth Codex'' may change all that. Its hero, Quintus Paz, a veteran Special Agent who has tracked smugglers throughout Latin America, has nothing in common with the familiar image of a uniformed passport stamper. As portrayed by Robert Houston - the author of a number of previous novels, including ''Ararat,'' ''The Nation Thief'' and ''Cholo'' - Paz is a man of action, a gaucho like his Argentinian grandfather. Against his natural bent, he has spent the last five years at a dull desk job in Tucson, Ariz., trying to please his safety-conscious wife. Now, divorced and disillusioned, Paz is planning to retire - until he receives special orders to return to Mexico and search for a missing Mayan codex, a priceless document that may already be on its way to unscrupulous collectors in the States. Once south of the border, Paz regains faith in his calling as he follows a dangerous trail that leads from the earthquake-blasted streets of Mexico City to a remote Indian village, the site of the archeological dig that produced the codex - and, it turns out, a far more sinister smuggling operation. Complex as the plot is, it forms only half of ''The Fourth Codex.'' The rest of the tale is a sympathetic account of today's Mexico, a beautiful country whose economic crash has wrought desperation. This is the first volume in a projected series of novels about Quintus Paz and the Customs Service. If Mr. Houston handles foreign locales as convincingly and sensitively in future installments as he does here, his books should attract adventure fans and armchair travelers alike.",1988-06-26T05:00:00+0000

The rootless, unnamed protagonist of Neil Ferguson's first novel drifts across the United States from New York City to Knoxville, New Orleans, Houston, Phoenix and a few other greasy spots on the map, tippling all the while. If this were the 1940's, Mr. Ferguson's hapless no-name would eventually link up with a blonde who spelled trouble, wander into a couple of ugly murders, come up against a mean cop and suffer more than one nasty hangover. But this is the 1980's and so, although the nomadic English writer (Mr. Ferguson, no surprise, is also English) meets his share of assorted nuts who give the impression that there's a lot going on, nothing really happens. Guns flaunted don't go off, dukes put up come down. Mr. Ferguson is aware of the literary highway on which he travels (his hero kisses off one woman with ''farewell, my lovely'') and has deliberately chosen the theme of frenzied stasis, but he builds little into his narrative to keep the reader interested. The best he does for his hero is to place him where he can eavesdrop effectively. Since ''Bars of America'' can only be the result of a trip Mr. Ferguson himself made, a pertinent question is raised: just how imaginative does current fiction have to be in order to be labeled fiction? The answer offered here isn't very pretty.",1988-06-26T05:00:00+0000

The psychological damage from the attacks is also great, experts say. 24 A racial attack in Long Island City, Queens, occurred Friday night, the police said, when at least seven Hispanic men attacked Pakistani and Indian Moslems outside a mosque, fracturing one man's skull. 24 A Long Island hospital could lose Medicare and Medicaid payments, which pay the bills of 60 percent of the Nassau County Medical Center's patients, because it does not meet some Federal health-care standards, officials said. 23 The Brooklyn Navy Yard ignored bids by two companies for leases and treated them unfairly, the companies said.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE PIGEON. By Patrick Suskind. Translated by John E. Woods. (Knopf, $14.95.) Poor Jonathan Noel is having a bad day. That is an event in itself, since Noel, a Paris bank guard ''already past fifty,'' has fashioned a life so sedate and circumscribed that nothing out of the ordinary ever shatters its smooth surface. But now something unexpected has happened: he has found a pigeon on the threshold of his room. Patrick Suskind's Noel is the quintessential victim, a ''pigeon'' himself, who trembles over any confrontation. But the bird's presence forces him to take some action. He decides, characteristically, to pack his bags and leave, hoping the bird will disappear while he holes up in a cheap hotel. However, Noel's flight causes a change in his own perception of his life. In the course of this masterly and witty novella, ably translated from the German by John E. Woods, Noel expands emotionally and sensually, discovering he ''simply cannot live without other people!'' Finally, he courageously returns home, knowing he no longer will be daunted by the pigeon, and awakened to the new powers he has found within himself. Mr. Suskind, a Munich-born writer whose suspenseful best-selling novel ''Perfume'' was published here in 1986, gives us some whiffs of Georges Simenon in this slender but charming rendering of Noel's fateful day.",1988-06-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"Review/Music; At Caramoor, the Sounds of Nature and of Art","This is the time of year when music leaves the safe harbor of the concert hall and does battle with nature. Such sorties go under various names: music on the lawn, concerts under the stars, opera in the parks, chamber music in the dell. Most bear a broader title of festival, like the one here at Caramoor that began its 43d summer season tonight. John Nelson conducted the Orchestra of St. Luke's in music by Haydn, Mozart and Stravinsky. Peter Serkin was the pianist in the Ravel Concerto in G. Whether Caramoor and festivals like it celebrate the man-made artifacts we call music or else music's natural enemy - the great outdoors - is also a matter of some confusion to the people who put on such events. Hoped for, I imagine, is beauty by addition whereby two nice things lumped together end up doubling our pleasure. One comes away, however, thinking that concerts, even ones as well played as this, are still better off inside where it's safe. Airplanes and helicopters overhead may seem the immediate danger but they are not the ultimate ones. More insidious are the sounds of nature: the wind rushing through the trees, causing canvas overhangs to flap, or the small bird that cheeped through the Haydn ''Feuersymphonie.'' These are more unsettling for they do more than disrupt, they confront - offering a competing beauty so overwhelming and so alien from counterpoint, sonata form or other puny human constructs that works of art are made to seem not just superfluous but painfully out of place.",1988-06-27T05:00:00+0000

us,"A Call for Change, But . . .","Following are some of the proposals included in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speech, along with some ideas put forth in public debate leading up to the conference that he did not endorse. Political System: A new ''Congress of Peoples Deputies'' would become the supreme government body, consisting of 1,500 deputies elected by region and 750 picked by Communist Party committees, trade unions, the Young Communists League and other organizations. It would select the national legislature and a president, who would exercise broad government powers. Mr. Gorbachev rejected proposals in the press for direct public election of a president. Local Government: Government councils would be given new power and revenues from taxes on local industry. Local party leaders would be nominated to head the councils, assuring a strong party role. Electoral Changes: The secret ballot and competitive elections would become the norm in selecting party leaders and government officials. Constitutional Commission: The new congress would create a commission with authority to review laws and make sure they are consistent with the Constitution. No such constitutional review now exists. Courts: He called for ''major reform of our courts'' to create greater independence and protect rights of defendants. He hinted that he favored moving toward a jury system, but gave few details. Ethnic Minorities: He said the conference would discuss minority relations. He rejected calls for redrawing boundaries, apparently in answer to the call by Armenians for reunification of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. He condemned ''regional egoism'' but hinted at support for greater economic independence in republics, as Baltic republics and others have demanded. Alternative Political Groups: Mr. Gorbachev firmly rejected the idea of competing political parties, but he said ''civic organizations,'' including non-Communists groups, should play a more active role in political affairs. He did not specifically support the idea of ''peoples' fronts'' with power to nominate candidates for office and propose laws. Changing Leaders: He rejected a purge of ''dead wood'' in the party and opposed a mandatory retirement age. He supported a limit on terms of office, but the conference must decide if two or three terms will be allowed. History: Mr. Gorbachev strongly defended the critical exploration of Soviet history, but did not, as some had hoped, level sharp new criticism at past leaders. He mentioned Stalin only twice, and Brezhnev not at all. Glasnost: He condemned ''uniformity, monotonous conformity and mediocrity'' in cultural life and said that ''there is no need to fear the novel, unconventional character of some opinions.'' He did not mention letters to the press calling for publishing the party's budget and transcripts of important party meetings. Proposals to televise the conference itself were rejected, except for Mr. Gorbachev's opening and closing remarks. Religion: He renewed his appeal for ''freedom of conscience'' and condemned ''administrative pressure'' on religious believers, but provided no details of forthcoming laws on religion. Individual Rights: He called for laws to protect the ''inviolability'' of the home, telephone calls and the mail. But he did not mention other proposals raised in the press, such as abolishing travel restrictions. Privileges: One of the most popular ideas put forth in the press is abolishing the privileges of party and Government officials, but Mr. Gorbachev did not mention this.",1988-06-29T05:00:00+0000

us,2 Months in the Recall of a Suspect Drug,"On April 29, the Food and Drug Administration and the manufacturer began a time-consuming voluntary effort to mislabeled drug bottles presumed to pose a serious danger. Some key events: April 28 - A Pennsylvania drug chain discovers that several bottles labeled as ipecac, a drug used to induce vomiting in emergencies, actually contain poisonous eucalyptus oil. It notifies the maker, Humco Laboratory of Texarkana, Tex. April 29 - Humco confirms the error in some bottles, recalls all one-ounce bottles in distribution, stores or homes, and notifies the F.D.A. district office in Dallas, which in turn notifies the agency's Emergency Operations Branch in Rockville, Md. The agency determines there is a high risk and releases an alert to national news media. News coverage is sparse. April 30 - Dallas F.D.A. inspectors visit Humco to get samples and distribution information. The company notifies distributors by certified mail. May 4 - The Dallas recall officer formally files a recommendation for an agency procedure to follow up on the company recall. May 5 - Washington approves the recall procedure. Express mail letters are sent to the 20 other F.D.A. districts, instructing them to check local distributors to confirm receipt of the company letter, do weekly reports on the number of bottles found and send the results to the Dallas office. May 6 - In the hope of wider news coverage, a second news alert is issued after the agency discovers thousands of suspect bottles were distributed free nationally for Poison Control Week. June 24 - With 101,480 bottles returned out of an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 covered by the recall, the agency calls the rate of return good, but critics say the process was too slow. Officials say that the effort could continue for several months, but that none of the retrieved bottles has contained the poison. Any 1-ounce bottles of Humco brand ipecac still in homes or on shelves should be discarded or returned to the store; the brand is not now being sold in this size. There have been no reports of deaths or poisonings.",1988-06-30T05:00:00+0000
