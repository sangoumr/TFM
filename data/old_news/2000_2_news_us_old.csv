She attended King's College, Durham University, from which she was graduated with first-class honors in physical chemistry in 1933. Following graduate work at her home university, she came to this country and worked for two years at Radcliffe and at Harvard as a recipient of the Augustus Anson Whitney Fellowship from King's College, and as a Ross Sidgwick Fellow of the British and American Associations of University Women. She received her M.S. in chemistry from Radcliffe in 1937 and her Ph.D. from King's College in the same year. Following her return to England, she became a member of the senior research and administrative staff in the War Department, carrying on research in diagnostic explosives and working with mist dissolving for aircraft, the results of which were recognized as important in the British war effort.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Sticky Stuff,"Stuck out in a drafty sheep farmers' cabin in deserted eastern British Columbia, Augusta Olsen finds little comfort in her skinflint husband, Karl. Nothing helps -- not even sneaking into town -- until she dusts off her mother's apiary equipment and begins, quite literally, to put some honey into her life. The craft of beekeeping provides some of the most memorable moments in Gail Anderson-Dargatz's second novel, A RECIPE FOR BEES (Harmony, $23). What sticks in the mind here, oddly enough, is not so much Augusta's ingenuity or her struggles, but Karl's unquestioning loyalty. Throughout the journey that started on a hardscrabble farm and brought them to an overprotected life in an old-age home in Vancouver, you wonder: what did Karl think of his wayward wife? He becomes a considerate husband late in the novel, and it's a conversion that doesn't make a lot of sense -- particularly when the lingering image of Augusta is of a nervous young woman in a fading flowered dress, nervously sipping tea in a downtown cafe as she awaits her lover. Honey is a miraculous sweetener, and it makes a handy metaphor for discoveries and compromises made late in a marriage. In this novel, it's not nearly as effective in its other role, as glue.

For those who want to explore it, Rutgers University Press has published a book, ''Paths Along the Hudson: A Guide to Walking and Biking.'' It was written by Jeffrey Perls, a freelance writer and environmental activist who leads outings along the river. He describes the river's geography and history at length, discusses problems of pollution and recreation and directs readers to programs and groups involved with the area. Of course, there are many trails in New York State. But, he says, to see perhaps the most magnificent path along the river, the 13.5-mile Shore Trail, with Paleozoic rocks, Colonial houses and gorgeous waterfalls, New Jerseyans need never cross the river or the state line. The paperback, $20, is 320 pages and has 20 maps.",2000-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Rubbernecking With Class,"Appreciating the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building is easy: their greatness is agreed upon. It is a lot harder to say something intelligent about the hulking Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square. In MANHATTAN SKYSCRAPERS (Princeton Architectural, $45), Eric P. Nash manages to do both. The book, which features 75 extant examples built since the skyscraper was invented a century ago, is admirably grounded in the details of stone, steel and glass. In fact, nonarchitects will find themselves consulting the handy glossary when words like ''chamfered'' and ''intrados'' come up. Each skyscraper gets a two-page spread (four for a few heavy hitters like the Empire State Building). The full-page photographs by Norman McGrath help the reader better understand both good and great buildings. Nash, a researcher at The New York Times Magazine, writes a deft prose: in his entry on the postmodern Conde Nast Building, he compares buildings that look different from various sides to ''politic but perhaps hypocritical gentlemen.'' The magnificent Lever House, financed by a soap-manufacturing fortune, remains ''bright, minty-fresh, and smacks of prosperity.'' His take on the Marriott Marquis acknowledges its ''ghastly'' elements but finds the anti-urbanist design, which encourages guests to shun the city, ''insidiously brilliant.'' Even an architecture writer should be able to empathize with the villain of the piece. Ted Loos",2000-02-06T05:00:00+0000

Its label is Latin: Bacteriophagum Intestinalis Fluidum.

The findings could be used to make healthy foods more appealing or, commercially, to develop products consumers will, well, consume. About 125 volunteers have been tested during the past year and at least another 30 are needed, mainly men aged 21 to 50, in two 45-minute sessions.

The buzzer was not repaired as promised and was going all night, keeping me and other tenants awake. I called a 24-hour locksmith and paid out of pocket for the buzzer to be disconnected. When I sent the receipt in with a reduced rent check the following month, the owner returned both the receipt and the check with a letter saying that the deduction was ''unapproved and unacceptable.''

He called the piece ''The Breathing Show,'' and, with Janet Wong, his rehearsal director, he began to select the music and experiment with movement. The dance, which can be seen this week in New Jersey, had its premiere in Iowa City last October, but Mr. Jones still considered it a work in progress. He continued to refine the elements of the piece, which incorporated singing, talking, film and, of course, dancing.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Bravissimew!,"When, some years ago, a movie called ''The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing'' came out, I was severely disappointed to discover that the title referred to a person, not an activity. What fulfillment, then, to happen upon DANCING WITH CATS (Chronicle, paper, $16.95), in whose marvelously silly photographs -- there are more than 90 of them -- men, women and children do just that. The book, by Burton Silver and Heather Busch, contains, in addition to those hilarious images, much helpful instruction for aspiring dancers with cats -- hints about picking up energy field vibrations, for instance, and tapping into the profound energy of feline peace. There are also practical tips from practitioners: Fred, for one, dresses up in striped tights and striped body paint, to which he adds a tail, to aid in his becoming a psychic extension of his cat, Fluff; Max, who wears Goth makeup, tight black leather pants and black nail polish, recommends visualization and mime to inspire his cat, Wiky; and Ivan, who wears practically nothing and dances with between one and five Abyssinians -- only Spike seems to have a name -- points out that when dancing with two cats, you must make sure that their tails are in opposing positions to balance positive and negative forces. Cynics might note that many of the dancing cats seem to be reacting to less esoteric stimuli, leaping to grab at a floating scarf or veil; extreme cynics might even suspect that some of the higher-leaping animals have simply been flung into the frame by an unseen hand. The latter will be comforted by a disclaimer that no cats were harmed in the making of this book. Silver lectures on feline energy-field dynamics, while Busch runs cat-dancing therapy workshops.

Now, however, Corzine is running for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in New Jersey, a state whose politics do not typically reward amiability. Corzine's opponent is Jim Florio, the former governor of the state and a man who is, for good reason, invariably referred to as ''an ex-boxer.''

us,Children's Books; Gravel for Dessert,"Sascha and Iguana and I have run away to Key West. Sascha is 4, I am not, and Iguana is the heroine of THE NIGHT IGUANA LEFT HOME, by Megan McDonald, illustrated by Ponder Goembel (Richard Jackson/DK Ink, $15.95; ages 5 and up), a book we are reading in the shade of an ylang-ylang tree. Iguana's story is a familiar one: she was living contentedly in Schenectady, N.Y., at the home of her ''friend and almost sister,'' Alison Frogley, who provided a closet with a heating pad, a free library card, a personal e-mail address and plenty of anchovy pizza. Nonetheless, Iguana began to peel and crack and droop. Then she noticed a poster in Alison's room: ''Key West.'' ''Florida! No passport necessary!'' she thought. ''Iguana woke up the next morning and added an n to her name. Iguanna, she scrawled, in cursive, in the steam on the bathroom mirror. Then she kissed it.'' Then, having spiked her hair, she took the bus south. ''For a short time, Iguana lived the high life. . . . She ate snails and caviar, papaya and mustard greens, hibiscus flowers. And gravel for dessert.'' Alas, it ended as unconsidered flights to Key West so often do. The money ran out, and Iguana had to wash dishes in a restaurant. One night, she realized that Gallina de Palo on the menu meant iguana stew. She swam for her life up the keys to Big Pine, where she found a job licking ''60 stamps a minute'' at the post office. A few days later Iguana mailed herself safely back to Alison's house in Schenectady, where they stuffed themselves with anchovy pizza. Nowadays, Alison mails Iguana to Key West in a very long (six and a half feet) box containing a heart-shaped pillow embroidered Iguanna, and twice a year Iguana mails herself back for a visit with her true friend. Sascha is a little young for some of the more sophisticated bits (she perfectly understood the hair spiking, but was confused by the idea of gravel for dessert), but it doesn't matter. This enchanting book, marvelously written (and obviously thoroughly researched) by McDonald, and gloriously illustrated by Goembel (Iguana surfing is a masterpiece), is destined to become for Key West what ducklings are to Boston and Eloise is to New York.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Redeemed by Language,"Assia Djebar is an Algerian novelist who was educated in France, and her sweeping and impressionistic new novel, SO VAST THE PRISON (Seven Stories, $24.95), is about cross-cultural conflict -- it takes us into the life of an educated Algerian woman who is caught between traditional Islamic mores and her longing for a more modern, European way of life. When Isma, who is 37 and married, has an affair with a younger man, her husband not only beats her but attempts to blind her. Fighting a sense of overwhelming imprisonment, Isma eventually abandons her marriage and becomes a filmmaker, savoring a taste of freedom in her middle age. (She attains, at least in part, her adolescent desire for ''not happiness but joy.'') She has escaped the ''community of women shut away yesterday and today'' -- the women of Islam, who are ''completely veiled in white cloth'' -- and gained the power to gaze back at them through the camera's lens. Djebar breaks up Isma's story with detours into Algerian history, in particular the story of Tin Hinan, ''the fugitive princess, who made her way into the very heart of the desert of deserts,'' and ends with a lament for modern Algeria, a land of ''dark, incomprehensible deaths.'' Her novel, ably translated from the French by Betsy Wing, deliberately confuses time and character to stress the timelessness of its themes, notably the hardships faced by women, the oppressions of colonialism and the redemptive power of language and writing. Djebar's prose can occasionally seem overwrought, but her often elliptical style effectively transmits the potent feeling of dislocation at the heart of Isma's story.

Louis Bowman has an upwardly striving mother who is raring to ditch the projects and a stepfather who is a mild-mannered sadist. On top of these prickly family politics, Louis must also survive being bright and sensitive, a ''sissy'' who is routinely bullied by other kids. To toughen him up, his mother suggests that his stepfather give him boxing lessons every Sunday afternoon, a ritual that Louis correctly perceives as ''a chance for Ben to hit me like he'd always wanted to, except that now Mom had given him permission.'' There are other miseries -- a racist schoolteacher, a run-in with a child molester, trips to what Louis's mother insists on calling an ''insane asylum'' for useless group therapy sessions -- all of which are recounted with artful observation and a quiet, slow-burning wit. At the somewhat happy ending, Louis gets accepted by an older, tougher kid he has a crush on, and who may even be gay. (The handling of sexual desire is subtle and sure here.) Wright's prose is sometimes too loyal to the tedium and aimlessness of adolescence: Louis's episodic adventures are disjointed and never pick up much momentum. Even so, you're always aware of how Wright's talents might flourish in a better-engineered narrative, and the absence of sentimentality is refreshing. Chase Madar",2000-02-20T05:00:00+0000

A brick-size wallet weighing down a back pants pocket can make the sleekest Prada suit jacket look just plain lumpy. And so men's wallet designers have revived the breast-pocket wallet -- the wide, long bi-fold kind designed for an inside jacket pocket -- and have streamlined it for an even flatter fit. Newly tweaked versions of the classic include Coach's polished-calf breast pocket wallet ($150 at Coach stores), a Barneys New York brown calf checkbook-shape wallet ($175 at Barneys), Gucci's extra-thin black calf jacket wallet ($165 at Gucci stores) and a swanky old-fashioned version from Bergdorf Goodman in shiny brown (far right) or black alligator ($625 at the Bergdorf Goodman Men's Store). Despite the wallet's roominess, Patti O'Brien, fashion director at Rolling Stone, warns against overload. ''Keep it clean and uncluttered,'' she said, ''or you'll look like you have lopsided breasts, which is not a pretty look, for either a man or a woman.'' ELLEN TIEN",2000-02-20T05:00:00+0000

In the 50's, the virtuosity of Sarah Vaughan implied that jazz had become one of the fine arts. The strident rip in an Abbey Lincoln performance embodied jazz in the 60's -- politically ambitious, its structure undergoing major tremors. Diana Krall's dusky, deadpan contralto with its hairline cracks and her studious and tasteful swing might be jazz in 2000.

But Mr. Mendelsohn, who won the directing award at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival for this black-and-white film, as well as the grand prize at the 1999 Hamptons International Film Festival, said that one reason for using these images was that they were not exclusive to Long Island.",2000-02-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Glyphs From the Bauhaus,"When Anni Albers enrolled in 1922 at the Bauhaus, the German art-school-cum-laboratory of modern aesthetics, it wasn't quite progressive enough to admit a woman into the physically demanding painting workshop. Instead she was relegated to weaving. Yet doing something she considered ''as sissy as working with threads,'' Albers raised her textiles to the level of painting with spare abstract designs that were a radical departure from the decorative floral patterns or figural narratives of European tapestries. Her modular forms and improvisational glyphs echo the playful paintings of Paul Klee, who taught Albers a weaving course in which he encouraged students to exploit the innate checkerboard structure of the medium. Also inspirational were the Andean textiles that Albers collected on trips to Mexico and South America after coming to the United States in 1933 with her husband, Josef Albers, the acclaimed painter and color theorist. Her tactile masterpieces and later experiments with printmaking are beautifully presented in ANNI ALBERS (Guggenheim Museum/Abrams, $60), by Nicholas Fox Weber, the executive director of the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, and Pandora Tabatabai Asbaghi, an independent curator. Weber's is the best of a handful of essays as succinct as the works they illuminate; he chronicles how he first met the aging couple in 1971, when he was 23, and became so close to Anni Albers that he would drive her to the cemetery to read her mail by her husband's grave (she outlived Josef by nearly two decades, dying in 1994 at the age of 94). Weber writes lovingly of how this devout modernist, who valued technology in everything from water-repellent fibers to plastic, and unexpectedly delighted in places like Sears and Kentucky Fried Chicken, would complain of ''craft people,'' saying ''they should simply look at what they were wearing to understand the value of mechanization.''

us,Developing a Kind of E-Z Pass for the Eye,"Two scientific developments caught John E. Siedlarz's attention: in one, the opthalmologists Leonard Flom and Aran Safire discovered in the early 80's that the human iris -- a complex combination of features like pits, feathers, freckles, crypts, striations and radial furrows -- was a more specific way to identify people than a fingerprint. In the other, the mathematician John Daugman came up with a way to convert the image of the iris into a computer code. As a 20-year Air Force veteran with a background in security, Mr. Siedlarz concluded that using the iris as a way of identifying people might catch on commercially. He bought the patents for using an iris recognition system and seven years ago he started a business in Marlton called IriScan. He recently talked about his business.",2000-02-20T05:00:00+0000

In ''The Sixth Sense,'' the bell went off when Willis wore the same outfit for the entire picture. True, the limited wardrobe was a conceit, camouflaged by the styling, which was similar to one of those annual GQ get-the-most-out-of-your-ensemble spreads: sometimes Willis wore the vest with the suit, sometimes just an open-collared shirt instead of the more formal subtle necktie.

More Anne Tyler than John Updike, the book plays Grady's dilemma for gentle comedy and lingers fondly over the quirky geography of a proud, battered American industrial city, in this case Pittsburgh. ''Wonder Boys'' is intoxicated by its setting and enchanted by writing: by the sweet, fizzy soda pop of its own style and also by some unabashedly romantic notions of the literary life. Mr. Chabon's characters tap out their manuscripts on old typewriters, are reckless in love and loyal in friendship and suffer from the creative agitation Grady calls ''the midnight disease.''",2000-02-23T05:00:00+0000

The bill's sponsor Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll, a Republican from Morris Plains, said the resolution would help entice lawyers to enter the public sector rather than higher-paying private practice and give judges incentive to be adjunct professors at local law schools. To change the current law, legislators would have to pass the resolution to amend the state constitution, and then voters would have to approve the amendment in November.

The purpose of the former Army medic's solitary nocturnal perambulations through the wards was to decrease, or sometimes cancel, the dosages of post-operative pain medication junior members of his team had ordered during the day. Should any of us have the temerity to reinstate those dosages the following morning, the miscreant was sure to be subjected to a string of invective, ''lily livered'' being the least indelicate of the terms he used.

Take a notorious example: Freud uses the ordinary Besetzung (charge or investment) to say that an idea can become charged or intense; he is rendered as saying that an idea can become ''cathected'' with energy.

That captures the private and casual feel of most of the pieces gathered here; the art that Paley has displayed in her celebrated short stories is generally replaced in her poems by spontaneous, personal speech. These poems provide a tour through Paley's life, telling of her friends, her childhood memories and her struggle to come to terms with age and mortality. Readers familiar with her fiction and essays will recognize the childhood in an immigrant family, Greenwich Village street scenes, and Vermont landscapes, as well as the left-wing politics whose various crusades, from Vietnam (''In Duc Ninh a village of 1,654 households / over 100 tons of rice and cassava were burned'') to El Salvador, are nostalgically recalled. Such politics rarely lend themselves to ambiguities, as is shown in the ringing calls to action in ''Responsibility'': ''It is the responsibility of the poet to say many times: there is no freedom without justice and this means economic justice and love justice.'' Nor do the hymns to her friends (''I thought I would / sit down . . . / and write a poem honoring / the occasion which is May 25th / Evelyn my best friend's birthday'') and family entail much linguistic or emotional surprise. Only Paley's meditations on old age and her Jewish identity are exceptions to the generally cozy atmosphere. Adam Kirsch",2000-02-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Weill's World,"''I decided to develop a type of musical play which leans more and more toward opera,'' Kurt Weill declared in 1946, after he fled Nazi Germany and came to New York. ''In the 11 years I've been here, the musical theater on Broadway has developed tremendously,'' he added, referring primarily to his own contributions. The son of a cantor, Weill (1900-50) studied classical music with Humperdinck and Busoni. His works would come to reflect the cultural and political upheavals of his time, even as they blurred the distinctions between serious and popular music. Though ''The Threepenny Opera'' (1928) -- the greatest of his collaborations with Brecht -- was little known in the United States at the time of Weill's death, a number of his innovative Broadway musicals brought fame and critical respect, including ''Lady in the Dark'' (1941) and ''Lost in the Stars'' (1949). As painstakingly assembled by David Farneth, director of the Weill-Lenya Research Center, with Elmar Juchem, a German musicologist, and Dave Stein, an archivist at the Weill-Lenya Research Center, KURT WEILL: A Life in Pictures and Documents (Overlook, $75) demonstrates the degree to which Weill was a fierce protector and aggressive promoter of his own work. While focusing on Weill's compositions and career, this lavishly illustrated volume employs letters, production shots, posters, record labels and newspaper clippings to evoke the day-to-day existence of an industrious artist. The 17-year-old Weill announced that he wanted to ''work until I drop''; he reaffirmed, ''I completely fall apart when I'm not working.'' This begins to explain how Weill accomplished so much during his relatively brief life. ''He was probably the most original single workman in the whole musical theater, internationally considered, during the last quarter century,'' Virgil Thomson wrote in an obituary. Weill certainly would have agreed. David Kaufman",2000-02-27T05:00:00+0000
