us,Building a Better Can Opener,"The newest arrival in the culinary-industrial complex is the Specht-Harpman can opener. Taking its place in the hypertrophic American kitchen beside the Viking range and the Sub-Zero refrigerator, the Specht-Harpman boasts a three-phase, 440-volt, 250-horsepower electric motor with a manual three-speed transmission. The diamond-carborundum cutting head, capable of slicing through three-quarter-inch plate steel, makes alarmingly efficient work of even the most stubborn keyless sardine tins. The fragmentation shield protects users from microscopic shrapnel while further reducing the squeamish cook's direct interaction with the actual can, in both visual and tactile terms. Once emptied -- its contents now ready to be warmed to volcanic temperatures on the Viking or chilled to a subarctic fare-thee-well in the Sub-Zero -- the now-vacant receptacle is dropped into the induction smelter, where it is reduced to a steel ingot, suitable for recycling. The Specht-Harpman: it's mean and it's green.",2002-12-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Not Fade Away,"This is how ''vintage'' jeans happen: Troy Pierce buys a pair of new Levi's and wears them six days a week for more than a year. He rides his motorcycle in them, commuting from his place in Williamsburg to work in SoHo. He eats his Subway lunch on them. He works in them, loafs in them, D.J.'s in them. And he washes them, in cold water by hand, but only twice. ''They are really gross,'' he says. ''But that is the whole idea -- I wanted them to be completely natural.'' He knows the biography of every tear, from the tattered hem of the leg (''that's from slipping off the kick-start of my bike'') to the shredded back pocket (where the zipper of his wallet cut it up) to the imprint of his favorite pen. Then, in August, Sun Choe, a Levi's designer from San Francisco, comes by the company's Selvedge store on Mulberry Street, where Troy works. Choe likes the look of the grimy life contained in Troy's jeans so much that she wants to make a copy of them, distressed in exactly the same way that his jeans are -- with identical 3-D ''whisker'' folds below the front pockets, fades along the thighs and that shredded back pocket. As a designer in an industry dealing with the same material and same basic shape for the past 130 years, Choe's options for innovation are left largely to the realm of ''character.''",2002-12-01T05:00:00+0000

Then there is Diane Lane's reliving of an adulterous tryst an hour after the fact in Adrian Lyne's ''Unfaithful.''

The number of poetry readings has increased markedly over the past decade, and will surely increase more as Poetry magazine begins to spend its $100 million bequest.

Barbara attended public schools in Hartsdale, Rye and Millerton, NY. While holding a full-time job, she enrolled at Hunter College and earned a Bachelor's degree after nine years of study.

us,Monsters in Fine Detail,"Arthur Szyk (1894-1951) was the virtuoso caricaturist of World War II. He eviscerated his prey, yet his images were curiously beautiful, like paintings by Bosch or drawings by Drer. He rendered Hitler, Gring, Goebbels, Himmler, Mussolini and Hirohito as buffoons, inflating their features into indictments of evil, yet his images are so precisely detailed that it is difficult not to be seduced by their majesty. Steven Luckert notes, in THE ART AND POLITICS OF ARTHUR SZYK (United States Holocaust Museum, $35), that Szyk was born in the Polish city of Lodz when it was part of the Russian empire. He spent World War I there, later moving to Paris, then London before World War II; he ultimately settled in New York. He considered himself a Jewish artist, and his major works included ''The Haggadah'' (1934/39), the Passover text recited at a Seder with a contemporary political bent, rendered in a style influenced by Persian miniatures. In 1939, when Poland was carved up between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Szyk ceased all other work solely to make propaganda against the Axis. He produced a stream of drawings showing corpulent Nazis and monstrous Japanese (taking the racist stereotype of the vile Japanese even farther than most official propaganda). Some were published on covers of Collier's and Time. ''Szyk's caricatures perfectly reflected the prevailing moods and attitudes of America at war,'' Luckert writes. ''He trumpeted the justness of the Allied cause in the struggle against fascism.'' As a propagandist Szyk had mastered the art of persuasion. Steven Heller",2002-12-01T05:00:00+0000

It was run solely by a government bureaucracy and based on a worldview that said the ruler was ""emperor under all heaven"" - a divine appointment.

You can reach Vertu either through a rear alley or by walking straight through the Hugo Boss showroom, past the scrutinizing gaze of that store's nattily dressed sales crew, to the back entrance of the building, which is marked by an austere gray banner bearing nothing more than the name of the company and a logo that looks like an abstract rendering of a raptor's outstretched wings. Vertu is one flight up. It is generally open to the public by appointment only, and the hushed vacancy of its 3,500 square feet is broken only by the strains of ethereal New Age music. One corner of the room displays commissioned art from the British photographer Christopher Bucklow -- ghostly silhouettes of human figures that resemble vividly tinted M.R.I.'s. The art is not for sale. It does, however, prepare the visitor for an encounter with Vertu's specialized and highly self-conscious vocabulary of shopping. Initiates refer to the store as a ''client suite,'' to the service that Vertu's product delivers as ''the experience'' and to the product itself -- the world's first custom-built luxury cellphone -- as ''the instrument.''",2002-12-01T05:00:00+0000

Increasingly, however, they find themselves saddled with mountains of unsold produce because farmers in Kansas and Nebraska sell their own corn in Mexico at prices well below those of the Mexicans. This is not primarily due to higher efficiency. The Americans' real advantage comes from huge taxpayer-provided subsidies that allow them to sell overseas at 20 percent below the actual cost of production. In other words, we subsidize our farmers so heavily that they can undersell poor competitors abroad. And just to make sure, we have tariff barriers in place that make it extremely hard for many third world farmers to sell in the United States. The same is true for their efforts to sell in Europe and Japan. The world's farming system is rigged in favor of the rich.",2002-12-01T05:00:00+0000

Set in the Danish court in the 1770's, this fact-based yarn by a veteran Swedish novelist and playwright tells of how the German physician to the young king becomes Denmark's de facto ruler, and of how the idealistic doctor's affair with the queen dashes his dream of transforming the backward kingdom into a land of libert, galit et fraternit. Last year our reviewer, Bruce Bawer, said the ''principal characters are realized with a vividness and subtlety that place the book in the front ranks of contemporary literary fiction.'' Another Swedish novel, Doctor Glas, by Hjalmar Soderberg (Anchor, $12), records the psychic unraveling of a Stockholm doctor, gradually driven by an inner voice to murder a repulsive local pastor. Originally published in Sweden in 1905, this ''brief, strange book . . . sketches the light and shadows of its time,'' Adrian Mitchell wrote here in 1964.

us,World Briefing | Europe: Monaco: Conviction In Billionaire's Death,"A court convicted an American nurse, Ted Maher, left, of causing the death of the reclusive billionaire banker Edmond Safra in a fire in 1999 and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. The verdict came after the chief prosecutor argued that Mr. Maher, 44, committed arson when he set a fire in Mr. Safra's luxury penthouse apartment that led directly to the death by asphyxiation of Mr. Safra and another nurse. Lawyers for Mr. Maher acknowledged that he had started the fire but said he did not intend to kill Mr. Safra or the nurse but wanted to win praise by rescuing him. Mr. Maher is expected to serve his sentence either in France or the United States, since the sole jail in Monaco accommodates only suspects awaiting trial, not convicted prisoners.

There was also the matter of replicating the rare ghost orchid that is the obsession of the thief (played by Chris Cooper, far right). ''There are a lot of orchid geeks out there who like to propagate things, but not even one of them had a ghost orchid,'' said K K Barrett, the production designer. He used an old Everglades guide and an out-of-print book on native Florida orchids to create a series of fakes out of pliable foam. But he said he made the movie's delicate ghost orchids ''a hair bigger than the original.''

The music Fela created, Afrobeat, was calm, inexorable funk with a purpose, carrying protest in both his righteous lyrics and the unity projected by his band. This album moves Fela's live grooves into the studio realms of hip-hop and current R&B, melding his songs with new lead vocals, instrumental solos and pointedly political raps. Samples from his recordings or new renditions of Fela songs back up a diaspora of musicians, among them Macy Gray, Sade, D'Angelo, Meshell Ndegeocello, Taj Mahal, Dead Prez, Talib Kweli, Roy Hargrove, Jorge Ben Jor, Baaba Maal and Djelimady Tounkara.

Mr. Graboff, the pedal-steel and guitar player who used to perform with Beat Rodeo, offers light, frothy instrumental takes on classics, originals and lesser-known Christmas projects from NRBQ and XTC.

Not all of these songs achieve the balance of forthrightness and indirection that made the album so good, but the best of them -- a mantric ballad called ''Purgatorying''; the spiteful hard rock song ''Unprodigal Daughter'' -- show off Ms. Morissette's ferocious approach to confessional songwriting.

Fitzgerald breezes through the mostly uptempo songs with the airborne playfulness she brought to jazz standards, somersaulting through key changes and taking care to sing even the lesser-known verses. Every so often, the backup singers offer interjections like ''There we go again with that tinntinnabulation'' (in ''Jingle Bells''). And when she glides into a ballad like ''What Are You Doing New Year's Eve'' or rides a Latin-flavored piano vamp in ''Good Morning Blues,'' her voice promises a sultry holiday.

This is the ultimate Christmas compilation for the lethargic, with 13 slow-rock, ambient-electronic and soft-pop specialists contributing songs of trudging beauty for alternative-music fans alienated by the holiday release glut. The eclectic duo of Morgan Caney and Kamal Joory offer one of their most beautiful songs, ''Darling''; Badly Drawn Boy looks to Phil Spector for his hopeful and lovelorn ''Donna and Blitze''; Hood, Orso and Erlend Oye (of Kings of Convenience) whisper moving seasonal ballads; and the Icelandic group Mum ends the album with a six-minute rumbling landscape that sounds like a grandfather's stomach after Christmas dinner. Over all, this is a beautifully packaged compilation that makes good listening any time of the year. NEIL STRAUSS",2002-12-06T05:00:00+0000

Conor Oberst, the singer and songwriter who leads Bright Eyes, has an achy voice that makes any song sound like a lament for lost love. And so, when he sings ''O Little Town of Bethlehem,'' he sounds like an anxious boy setting out on a date: ''The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.'' This CD consists solely of standards, but each one sounds fresh, especially ''Away in a Manger,'' which starts with a female voice and piano, dissolves into the sound of people talking (is it a Christmas party?), and then returns for another verse. ''A Christmas Album'' is available only online, from saddle-creek.com, and it may be the saddest, sweetest holiday recording you hear all season. KELEFA SANNEH",2002-12-06T05:00:00+0000

Nerds can be proud of They Might Be Giants, the prolific duo of John Flansburgh and John Linnell, who have made an unlikely 20-year career of writing catchy, nasally sung ditties about science, geography, history, paranoia, oddballs of all descriptions and thwarted love. Long before the Internet could let the world hear a finished song immediately, They Might Be Giants had Dial-a-Song, an answering machine in Brooklyn that played a new song daily in purest low fidelity; by the 1990's, they were being invited to write television themes. From the beginning, they were fond of buzzy electric keyboards, staccato guitar lines, random facts and not-so-meaningless wordplay. The 52 songs in this collection wander from whimsy to despair, always with a bounce and a bright pop hook. JON PARELES",2002-12-06T05:00:00+0000

In 1949, Dr. Papper was appointed chairman of Columbia University's Department of Anesthesiology, the youngest department chairman in the school's history. The department became widely recognized for the excellence of its research and training under his leadership-38 of Dr. Papper's students at Columbia went on to become chairmen of departments of anesthesiology at universities in the U.S. and abroad. His achievements have been honored by the establishment of both a lectureship and a professorship in his name at Columbia. In 1969, Dr. Papper became dean of the University of Miami School of Medicine, where he served for more than 10 years. In 1989, Dr. Papper became a founding member of the Columbia Presbyterian Health Sciences Advisory Council and actively participated in its meetings.

She needs that speed to pack all her ambitions into her songs. On her second double live album, she lets songs dissolve from chorus to rap to conversation to poem, and she juggles confession and character study, politics and comedy. A decade ago, she accompanied her volatile songs on her own quick-strummed acoustic guitar; now, she has a band that follows her every metamorphosis, from folky ballads to rock to funk to jazzy horns and harmonies. In rearranged old songs and a few new ones, she reflects on love, media, guns, family, stardom and, in a poem with music called ''Self-Evident,'' the aftermath of 9/11. She's troubled and disgusted and wounded and contentious, and her timing keeps listeners riveted to every shifting thought. JON PARELES",2002-12-06T05:00:00+0000

For ''None but the Righteous,'' John Medeski, of the jam band Medeski, Martin and Wood, culled 10 albums of sacred steel music released by Arhoolie, the label that brought it to the wider world. The selection mixes hymns, old-time gospel songs, train blues turned into preaching and flamboyant showcases from Aubrey Ghent, Glenn Lee and the Campbell Brothers, who feature dueling guitars. They all make their instruments shout for joy. JON PARELES",2002-12-06T05:00:00+0000

When Bea and Everett Lilly moved from West Virginia to Boston in the early 1950's and started performing on WCOP radio, they seeded the East Coast with a fascination for American rural music. The audiences they reached became the basis of a coffeehouse and local bluegrass-festival tradition that still thrives. The brothers' harmonies, over Don Stover's vigorous banjo playing, show their mastery of the Appalachian music repertory; these radio airchecks are rare early examples because the duo was barely recorded until the 1960's.

Mr. Lagueux used the compound, made by Georgia-Pacific, during construction work in the 1970's, his lawyers said. Officials of Union Carbide, which is owned by Dow Chemical, said they might appeal. The jury found that Union Carbide and Georgia-Pacific were responsible for 40 percent of the $1.8 million verdict, a Union Carbide spokesman said.

Mullen, who was named female vocalist of the year by the Gospel Music Association. She sets out to provide something for everyone on her Christmas album. Her limber, girlish voice is at home in current R&B-style tunes like the devout ''Lamb of God,'' but she only begins there. In the title song, she narrates the Annunciation story over a slow funk vamp that Marvin Gaye would appreciate. And then there's the salsa chorus in ''Away in a Sacred Night,'' the big-band disco arrangement of ''365,'' a jazzy brass band vamping behind ''God's Own Son'' and a Calypso bounce to carry ''Sing, Angels, Sing.'' Ms. Mullen gives her whole family cameo appearances, but even that indulgence comes across as part of the album's generous spirit. JON PARELES",2002-12-06T05:00:00+0000

They turn Christmas songs into lightly swinging arrangements that hark back to music from the 1930's to the 50's; not just the brisk Hot Club of France two-beats suggested by the album title, but also Western swing, tango (in ''Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer''), and a touch of boogie-woogie (''Here Comes Santa Claus''). The group also has enough familiarity with classical music to slip a little Rachmaninoff into Tchaikovsky's ''Dance of the Suger Plum Fairy.''

Not including the one new song here, the minimal click-beat single ''It's in Our Hands,'' the tracks here were selected by fans who voted on her Web site. This means Bjork favorites like ''Violently Happy'' and ''It's Oh So Quiet'' (not to mention anything from the film ''Dancer in the Dark'') are all omitted, though others, like ''Hyperballad'' (the No. 1 choice of fans and a great metaphor for the loss and gain of relationships) and ''Play Dead'' (a lesser-known early song from the film ''The Young Americans'') are given their due.

And though it's disappointing that more material wasn't added, it's still great to have the funniest rock concert album I know of on CD. When ''Take No Prisoners'' was originally released as a two-record set, ''Walk on the Wild Side'' was so full of rambling asides, stories, self-mockery, audience mockery and cultural critique that the song filled one entire side. It's not about the songs here; it's about listening to the band vamp as Mr. Reed delivers a running dialogue with himself. In fact, one of these diatribes scolds The New York Times for calling him intelligent and putting the honorific Mr. before his name. ''I don't need you to tell me I'm good,'' he quips. Coming on like a rock 'n' roll Lenny Bruce, Mr. Reed names names, from Norman Mailer to the concert promoter Ron Delsener to half a dozen Warhol superstars. ''I do Lou Reed better than anybody, so I thought I'd get in on it,'' he says at one point before saying he has ''enough attitude to kill every person in Jersey.''

And an anthology of just the band's songs from the last 20 years could have been quite sad. But original or not, ''40 Licks'' is a great compilation, showing the majesty of one of Britain's finest rock 'n' roll bands. As the Rolling Stones descend into a business formula, it's easy to forget how powerful, soulful and resonant their music was, with a couple of small exceptions, from the mid-60's to the early 70's.

The stock declined 70 cents, to $3.42. Gateway has declined 49 percent this year. Sales on the Friday after Thanksgiving in the United States started well and then began slowing, the chief executive, Ted Waitt, said, and the company has cut prices. Gateway has reported losses in seven of the last eight quarters, as it competes against its larger rivals, Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard. ''The PC industry is maturing; it's turning from a growth industry to something that in the future will resemble the automobile industry,'' Lawrence Creatura, who helps invest $1.6 billion at Clover Capital Management, said in a radio interview yesterday.

About $400 million will be set aside for good-will impairment in its ailing telecommunications segment and another $400 million to $425 million will be taken for impairment of assets in its photonic technologies and conventional television glass units, Corning said. The impairment charges indicate the company is recognizing a decline in asset value. Corning is already taking a fourth-quarter charge of $550 million to $650 million to close optic fiber plants in Noble Park, Australia, and Neustadt, Germany, by early next year. It also is temporarily closing an optical fiber factory in Concord, N.C., transferring some operations across the state to Wilmington. The latest charges will bring the company's total pretax reorganization and impairment charges to around $2 billion in 2002. (AP) ",2002-12-06T05:00:00+0000

This won't be mistaken for a seasonal album; Jim and William Reid, the Scottish brothers who led the Jesus and Mary Chain, didn't mind blasphemy now and then. ''I wanna die come see Paradise/ I wanna die just like Jesus Christ,'' they sang in ''Reverence.'' But their main mission was to resurrect a formula that was a generation old: deliberately paced, succinct three-chord songs, swathed in varying amounts of guitar noise, that owed nearly everything to the Velvet Underground and the rest to the Ramones. The Reid brothers reclaimed the Velvets' netherworld of decadence, despair and romance, singing in deadpan voices about lovers who left and angst that never would. Their earliest singles were their noisiest ones, squealing with random feedback; later songs used distortion more carefully, for atmosphere and ballast. This compilation presents a band that made the most of its self-imposed limitations, compressing crises and hopes and imprecations into songs as dark and immutable as blocks of obsidian.

What resulted was too severe to be considered world beat. This disc brings together singles and rare tracks from the 1980's, including ''Coup,'' the dub experiment ''Tearing up the Plans Pt. 1'' and the spiky new-wave song ''Ethics.'' This has been a great year for reissues of adventurous British post-punk, so fans are also advised to seek out ''The Golden Hour of the Future: Recordings by the Future and the Human League'' (Black Melody), A Certain Ratio's ''Early'' (Soul Jazz) and ''The Original Sound of Sheffield '78/'82'' (Mute), by Cabaret Voltaire.

''Tree's on Fire'' explores the flammability of dead pine needles, to the tune of Johnny Cash's ''Ring of Fire''; a hip-hop satire and a song about ''Stephon the Alternative Lifestyle Reindeer'' are badly aimed and comically flat; most of the rest is about people named Hazel and Ethel drinking and fighting around Christmastime.

This invaluable two-disc set gathers 40 songs that document the rise of dancehall reggae, the subgenre that would eventually become Jamaica's most popular music. These days, dancehall reggae means avant-garde electronic soundscapes and shouted lyrics, and these songs show how the dancehall revolution began: with infectious songs that emphasized sharp, simple backing tracks (many produced by Henry 'Junjo' Lawes) and casual, conversational vocals. Classic dancehall singles like Barrington Levy's ''Shine Eye Gal'' and Eek-A-Mouse's ''Wa-Do-Dem'' are included, but nearly every track is terrific. ''Love a Dub'' consists mainly of Ranking Dread's improvising around the titular phrase, and on ''Bathroom Sex,'' General Echo uses a heavy, atonal beat to tell a series of dirty jokes.

He was a loving husband, father, grandfather and brother who adored his immediate and extended family and was adored by all of them.

A consummate team member, Dan relished his role as a leader in the design and construction of many of the buildings that today define New York City. Among his proudest achievements: the TWA terminal at JFK airport; the World Trade Center; the renovations to Carnegie Hall; the U.S. Steel building in Pittsburgh; EPCOT Center in Orlando; the John Hancock buildings in Chicago and Boston and many hospitals, office buildings, educational and research institutions and hotels. Dan was an active alumnus (class of 1947) of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). He vigorously championed direct involvement of RPI students in large scale projects such as the reconstruction of the Albany airport and the construction of RPI's new Biotechnology Building.

The current revival of post-punk music and its many offshoots has brought scores of quality reissues of albums that music fans thought they'd never hear on CD. It has also prompted many musicians to dig through their old tapes for unreleased material. Among them is Jeffrey Lohn, one-quarter of the noisy New York no-wave band the Theoretical Girls, which included the minimalist composer Glenn Branca, the keyboardist and composer Margaret DeWys, and the producer Wharton Tiers. With high concepts and low fidelity, they merged the freedom offered by punk with the strictures of modern classical to explore harmonics and rhythm with noisy, jagged, clustered guitar assaults. The band released only one single, in 1978, so this album may be of more historical than musical interest to many. NEIL STRAUSS",2002-12-06T05:00:00+0000

Then there's the title track, which makes it clear that Santa Claus has been watching too many rap videos: he shows up bearing diamonds and cars and plenty of cash; as one member raps, ''I think Santa gone crazy.'' There's a slow jam, of course (''Why'd You Leave Me on Christmas''), and a hip-hop version of ''Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,'' with a bubbly backing track that sounds like a video game. Finally, there's one song that absolutely defies belief: on ''Sexy Boy Christmas,'' the guys angle for a yuletide seduction while exclaiming, ''I'm a sexy boy.''

Little Feat, the surrealist blues-rock-boogie-honky-tonk-gospel-funk band from Los Angeles, went through 30 years of unreleased tape archives and graciously split its findings into two double-CD sets: ''Ripe Tomatos'' for relatively high-fidelity live recordings, and ''Raw Tomatos'' for demos, fragments, rarities and barely less polished live recordings. The band's best days were its early ones, when Lowell George was its songwriter and singer. Since George's death in 1979, with Craig Fuller and then Shaun Murphy as singers, it has maintained its syncopations and slide guitar, but with less nuanced vocals and fewer shapely melodies. Although ''Waiting for Columbus'' remains the definitive live Little Feat album, the band continues to knock its songs around onstage. ''Ripe Tomatos'' steams dependably through songs old and new, while ''Raw Tomatos'' won't disappoint the band's cult; the handful of George's unearthed performances are gems.

A few hours after his escape, they said, he stole a car from a 58-year-old woman. The prisoner, Christopher Howard, above, is the 34th prisoner to escape from police custody in the city this year. Officers typically use photographs to identify prisoners at arraignment, but it is unclear what happened in this case. On Wednesday evening, a prisoner set to be arraigned on a charge of unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, a misdemeanor, did not hear his name called and did not come into court. When the prisoner's name was called, Mr. Howard stepped forward and was released on his own recognizance. Mr. Howard had been charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance and unauthorized use of a vehicle, both felonies. About 6:50 a.m. in Kew Gardens Hills, seven hours after his escape was discovered, he pushed a woman who was approaching her car, a red Plymouth Sundance, and stole it, the police said. He has been identified by the woman, said Detective Robert Price. Lydia Polgreen (NYT)",2002-12-06T05:00:00+0000

This single-disc anthology isn't tendentious (there are no liner notes), but it is persuasive -- proof positive that a Houston-raised storyteller named Scarface is one of hip-hop's most compelling lyricists. The disc starts with ''Mr. Scarface,'' a gleeful blood-and-guts yarn, and ends with ''A Minute to Pray,'' which turns Marvin Gaye's ''Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)'' into a cautionary tale of crime and punishment. There are songs with Tupac Shakur (who emulated Scarface's groaning delivery) and Jay-Z (who emulates Scarface's attention to narrative detail). Scarface was never more insightful (or more chilling) than when he was rapping about death, and on an extraordinary track called ''I Seen a Man Die,'' he rhymes, ''If you're ready, close your eyes and we can set it free/ There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace.''

If they are wrong, NASA can send the shuttle to land at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., or reschedule the landing for Sunday at an Air Force landing strip at White Sands, N.M. The space agency wants to avoid a California landing not only because it would cost $1 million to transport the shuttle back to Florida, but also because it could delay the ship's next mission.

This case, first reported by Haaretz and The Associated Press late last month, involves far more than a scribble. What has turned up is a copy of the first edition, of 1899, copiously altered by Mahler in red ink. It changes not the substance of the symphony but its sound: its orchestration and how, by means of stress and rhythmic detail, its ideas are articulated -- how, in a word, it speaks.",2002-12-08T05:00:00+0000

A confused black bear ambling out of these woods for a moment at twilight is not an unusual sighting. More common still, on roads all over the eastern part of the state, are deer, which can instantly ruin the front end of a car as they come bounding out of the night onto a highway and into the headlights; in a split second, a crumpling fender sends their hundred pounds or so flying through the air. What happens to the people inside the car will be a lot less severe if their seatbelts are fastened. And, of course, there are the smaller, although nevertheless startling, nighttime crunches and bumps of a racoon caught beneath a tire while running across the pavement, a rambling possum likewise flattened, or an owl, misjudging its altitude, clipped by the roof to tumble as a lump of cooling feathers to the side of the road.

Mrs. Costa will be remembered for her significant contribution to the revival of the Yiddish language and culture in the academic world, as a memorial to the six mllion Jews who perished in World War II, as Yiddish was the ''mother tongue'' of most of them. Currently, more than 100 students are registered in Yiddish courses at Bar-Ilan, both in language and literature. A beloved member of Bar-Ilan's Presidential Founders Society, and American and Global Boards of Trustees, Mrs. Costa contributed to the advancement of higher education and the strengthening of scholarly excellence and Jewish heritage by her commitment to our University and her philanthropic spirit. Mrs. Costa fled Hitler's Europe just prior to World War II and through her extraordinary talent and drive, became a highly successful member of the diamond industry, where she was admired for her unshakable personal integrity, back in the days when a woman's rise in the business world was highly unusual. Though she was often vocal, she had an exceedingly lovable personality that will be sorely missed by her countless friends and admirers. We extend heartfelt condolences to her sister, Trudy Gildin.

us,Tchaikovsky,"Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky's ''Nutcracker'' will be performed on stages from small towns to the New York City Ballet this month -- and in ''literally hundreds of productions around the world,'' according to Jeffrey Milarsky, music director and conductor of the Columbia University Orchestra. That, along with the ''1812 Overture,'' ''Swan Lake'' and certain other works, means that Tchaikovsky, as Milarsky says, ''is played more than any composer.'' Yet where Milarsky and other members of the classical music establishment herald a revival of esteem for Tchaikovsky during recent years, Milton Babbitt, 86, a giant of the serialism movement in modern composing, has a problem with him. ''He said Brahms was an untalented bastard -- that's a quote,'' Babbitt says. ''But I've learned a lot from Brahms, whereas I can't say that about Tchaikovsky.'' Richard Einhorn, 50, whose compositions have been performed from Lincoln Center to the Netherlands, makes even less effort to disguise his antipathy: ''Tchaikovsky has as much to do with real classical music as the Three Tenors have to do with real opera. Most contemporary composers I know haven't listened to Tchaikovsky since the third grade, when they were forced to watch 'Fantasia' and gagged.'' Babbitt and Einhorn echo earlier derogations of his work as too sentimental (the Victorians) or insufficiently Russian (a group of composers who were Tchaikovsky's late-19th-century contemporaries), but the emergent issue now is a question that could throw what the critic Terry Teachout calls ''the Tchaikovsky wars'' into Armageddon.

Had you stumbled into the auditorium partway through, you might be forgiven for assuming the man at the podium was not an oil baron, an industrialist, an extractor of fossil fuels from the tender earth but an environmentalist of the high church calling for the abolition of hydrocarbons, the very substance that had made his company and himself so fabulously rich. His subject was global climate change -- in particular, the process by which humans, by burning oil and gas, have been slowly, perhaps irreversibly, warming the earth's atmosphere. And instead of hewing to the line of industry, instead of calling (as President Bush and the head of Exxon Mobil have) for caution and further research, he said, ''I believe the American people expect a company like BP . . . to offer answers and not excuses.'' He also said, ''Climate change is an issue which raises fundamental questions about the relationship between companies and society as a whole, and between one generation and the next.'' He even said, ''Companies composed of highly skilled and trained people can't live in denial of mounting evidence gathered by hundreds of the most reputable scientists in the world.''",2002-12-08T05:00:00+0000

Ellis de Dienes, from Taschen ($200). The former is a two-volume slipcased product of years of scholarship into Stieglitz's career, and it reproduces and exhaustively catalogs more than 1,600 of his artful photographs. The latter, devoted to pictures of Marilyn Monroe taken by Andr de Dienes, a nearly forgotten Hollywood glamour photographer who helped start her modeling career in the mid-1940's, consists of a coffee-table book, a facsimile memoir and a brochure of Marilyn magazine covers stuffed inside an ersatz Kodak yellow box. The Stieglitz is serious, art-historically important and full of great pictures. The Marilyn is all about popular culture, celebrity and a beautiful young woman.

Biovail bought the Pharma Pass Group's Pharma Pass, which is based in Irvine, Calif., and Pharma Pass S.A. of France, Biovail said in a statement on its Web site. Pharma Pass developed a generic copy of AstraZeneca's Prilosec, a product with $5.7 billion in sales last year, and licensed it to Schwarz Pharma. The acquisition is the latest this year for Biovail as the company tries to expand the number of drugs it has in development. Payments from the sale of generic Prilosec, which Schwarz's partners, the Andrx Corporation and Merck introduced this week in the United States, may help Biovail weather a possible delay in United States approval for its Cardizem LA blood-pressure drug, analysts said. Shares of Biovail fell 44 cents, to $32.51.

us,36 Hours | Baltimore,"BALTIMORE is a large, diverse city, but a visitor with limited time can enjoy much of the best the city offers by sticking to three neighborhoods: the Inner Harbor, Federal Hill and Fells Point. All are within walking distance or a water-taxi ride of some of the city's best hotels. Until the mid-1970's, the Inner Harbor was surrounded by rotting piers and warehouses. In one of the nation's most successful urban renewal efforts, the area was reborn with the Rouse Company's ''festival market'' called Harborplace; new and rehabilitated housing in Otterbein, just to the west; marinas for pleasure craft; the Maryland Science Center; the National Aquarium; and an array of new Pratt Street office towers overlooking it all. Fells Point and Federal Hill are old neighborhoods where Formstone-fronted row houses (like those now appearing on Broadway in ''Hairspray'') have survived despite decades of gentrification. Fells Point, where the city began, is a cobblestone waterfront district of restaurants, bars and shops, reminiscent of the French Quarter in New Orleans except with rowdy Baltimoreans instead of rowdy tourists. Federal Hill is quieter but has a lively night life in the area around the popular Cross Street Market. The water taxis stop at many points in the harbor (they run from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., weather permitting). A ticket -- $5 for adults, $3 for children 10 and under, and good all day -- will take you to any stop, or you can make a tour of it, staying aboard for all the stops and returning to where you started.",2002-12-13T05:00:00+0000

As a result, the Financial Times Group's profits, before Internet expenses, are expected to fall 20 percent, compared with last year.

But solar panels work only during the daytime, when most consumers aren't home to consume the power they generate. It is possible to store the excess electricity in batteries, but those are inefficient and expensive. A simpler alternative, called net metering, allows consumers to transfer surplus energy onto the public-utility grid using a specially made inverter, ''banking'' it for later use. When a house produces more power than it consumes, the electric meter literally spins backward, allowing consumers to rack up kilowatt credits, to be drawn upon later. As of this year, net metering is used in 37 states. In California, the number of people applying for net-metering rebates more than doubled this year, and in 2003, sales of inverters are projected to rise nationwide by nearly 30 percent.",2002-12-15T05:00:00+0000

The brochures were advertising the Executive-Chute, a small, easy-to-use parachute. After leaping from the window of a ''distressed'' building, a static line secured to a doorknob releases the parachute less than two seconds later. With a descent rate of 1,000 feet per minute, the parachute won't waft the executive down to the ground, but it will slow his descent to a manageable speed.

''Not by excess can you do it / Nor by sparely imagining / Maybe only by working your way through it / Like voltage or a rabbit.'' The evidence of his effort to do just that is everywhere in two posthumously published books, ''SUN OUT: Selected Poems, 1952-1954'' (Knopf, $25) -- from his early days as a founding member of the famous New York School -- and ''A POSSIBLE WORLD'' (Knopf, $24), his final collection. Both are exuberant records of a life well lived in both seriousness and humor. Whether Koch is remembering himself in youth as a marvelously chosen ''volatile evergreen'' or traveling in Thailand, he is aware of and awestruck by the immensity of experience and his own endless hunger for more. ''Such wild desires, I think it's recognizable / Are part and parcel of the Human Image,'' he muses. Then, with characteristic glancing wit that nonetheless contains a truth, he adds, ''And in a way I'd say, no less predictable / Than Popeye's feelings for a can of spinach.'' There is invaluable wisdom to be gleaned from Koch. ''Go to look at it at sunset when it's PINK / My guidebook said. Good advice about anything, I suppose. / Or, after some road has been mended, when it smells like tar. / 'When you are in love, go hear your beating heart.' '' Koch's own heart beats throughout these collections, enlivening them as it has all of his work, ensuring that the voice accompanying its pulsing will live on.

When Congress created the Department of Homeland Security, for instance, it pledged to share data with state and local officials that is currently maintained by the F.B.I. and the C.I.A.",2002-12-15T05:00:00+0000

us,'Saddam'," The young Saddam Hussein had a harsh and deprived childhood. The man who was to become one of the most powerful Arab leaders of modern times came from an impoverished village situated on the banks of the Tigris River on the outskirts of the provincial town of Tikrit. He was born into a poor family in one of the country's most inhospitable regions. At an early age Saddam was orphaned and sent to live with relatives, who oversaw his upbringing and education. No profound knowledge of psychology is required to estimate the effect these circumstances had upon the child's development. As with Hitler and Stalin, those two great tyrants of the twentieth century, both of whom overcame their less than auspicious starts in life to take absolute control of their respective nations, Saddam was to rise above the disadvantages of his childhood to become the undisputed master of Iraq. The shame of his humble origins was to become the driving force of his ambition, while the deep sense of insecurity that he developed as a consequence of his peripatetic childhood left him pathologically incapable in later life of trusting anyone - including his immediate family. Given the disadvantages of his birth, Saddam deserves credit for overcoming these seemingly insurmountable social obstacles to reach the pinnacle of Iraq's political pyramid.

This says more about the values of this country than it does about the two men. And I'm not sure what Traub means when he says that Clinton enjoyed enormous black support even as he vowed to ''end welfare as we know it.'' Is Traub suggesting that most blacks are on welfare and therefore Clinton's ability to gain their support is surprising?

White, founder of the White Hospital in Ravenna, Ohio, and one of the founders of the Cleveland Clinic with Drs. Crile and Lower. Born December 1, 1925, Mr. Bower attended Hiram College in Ohio and, after serving in the US Infantry in the ETO, attended Columbia University's Graduate School of Philosophy. Following completion of his graduate work, Jack Bower joined the faculty of The College of Wooster in Ohio. He taught graduate courses at Western Reserve University in Ohio. Winner of a Ford Foundation Faculty Fellowship, Mr. Bower returned to NY and Columbia. In his final year at Columbia, he did extensive study in psychology. He left the University to become a professional motion picture film consultant with the Eastman Kodak Company and William J. German, Inc. Married in 1954, Mr. Bower joined Metro-GoldwynMayer in NY and Culver City, CA, and was involved in the production of film for television. In 1959, Mr. Bower moved to his home at Troutbeck in Amenia, NY, and was a neighbor to poet Melville Cane, scholar-historian Lewis Mumford, then Federal Judge Thurgood Marshall, and his lifelong friend Amy (Mrs. Joel E.) Spingarn. He taught at the local central high school for four years before moving to the Millbrook School, where he became, for fourteen years, Assistant Headmaster to Edward Pulling, Dean of the School, and the English Chair. While at Millbrook School, Mr. Bower created and directed a residential program for leaders among the children of Harlem, the Bronx and the Lower Eastside in NY. This highly successful program continued for several years until he left Millbrook School to fill, for thirteen years, the same roles at Saint Andrew's School of Boca Raton, FL.

The Board of Directors of The Santa Fe Opera and the Board of Trustees of The Santa Fe Opera Foundation note with great sadness and a sense of deep loss the death of the Opera's founder and General Director Emeritus, John O. Crosby. A pioneer in American opera, John Crosby founded The Santa Fe Opera in 1957 as a summer festival in a theater that accommodated 480 people, located in the spectacular Sangre de Cristo Mountains. His vision led him, at age 29, to found a company that regularly presented rarely performed and contemporary works and engaged first-rate young American singers. In its first season, The Santa Fe Opera established an apprentice program for singers, the first program of its kind, adding a program for technical apprentices the following year. Mr. Crosby served as General Director of the company until August 2000. The Santa Fe Opera continues today to abide by John Crosby's precepts and insights, continuing to present the finest opera on the same site in a theater that now seats 2,168. The roster of former solo artists and apprentices fills today's opera houses around the world. American opera has lost a giant. David K. Ingalls, Chairman, The Santa Fe Opera Susan F.

The department responded yesterday that the plan was legal and that firefighters would be able to work safely. ""This is a contractual provision that the union agreed to,"" said Francis X.

The department plans to reduce crew sizes to four from five on more than 50 engines under an agreement allowing it to do so if firefighters' sick leave climbs above a preset level.

us,Technology Briefing: Telecommunications," VERIZON LAYING OFF 2,400 IN NEW YORK Verizon Communications is laying off 2,400 workers in New York, effective immediately, because of competition and a slumping economy, the company said yesterday. The cuts, which had been expected, will affect mostly installation and service technicians, a Verizon spokesman, Cliff Lee, said. The company has attributed the job losses to tight competition from traditional, cellular and cable modem services and the poor health of the telecommunications industry. But the union, the Communications Workers of America, said Verizon wanted to cut the work force all along and would offer only limited job security in return for large-scale concessions. ""Their offer was ridiculous,"" a union spokesman, Bob Master, said. ""They were asking us to give away our contract and not really offer any job security in return."" Mr. Master said the company told union officials that about 1,100 of the job cuts would be made at operations upstate, north and west of Westchester County. Mr. Lee declined to give specific breakdowns of where the cuts would be made. (AP) ",2002-12-20T05:00:00+0000

Motorola, the world's No. 2 maker of wireless telephones, will turn over the department's computer systems, and 600 Motorola employees will transfer to Affiliated in the first quarter of 2003, the companies said. Affiliated will combine the department with its existing business and offer services to other companies. Affiliated, which runs New Jersey's E-ZPass highway toll collection system, is seeking to manage other companies' back-office functions, like purchasing, as its traditional information technology contracts slow, the chief marketing officer, Lesley Pool, said. A Motorola spokeswoman, Margot Brown, said the company could be paid as much as $75 million over the contract's life. Shares of Affiliated Computer rose $1.20, to $50.10.

us,World Briefing | Environment: New Rice-Growing Technique Reduces Methane,"A shift over the past 20 years in the way rice is cultivated has reduced emissions of methane, an important heat-trapping greenhouse gas, and may account for a slowdown in the growth rate of atmospheric concentrations. Methane is much scarcer than carbon dioxide, the dominant greenhouse gas, but is 21 times more effective at trapping the sun's heat. To save water and increase yields, Chinese farmers have switched to draining fields several times a year instead of keeping them flooded. The practice appears to have reduced the activity of soil bacteria that release methane, and emissions have dropped 40 percent. Andrew C. Revkin (NYT)",2002-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  SCHERBATSKOY, SERGE A.","SCHERBATSKOY-Serge A., 94, prominent inventor, Serge Alexander Scherbatskoy, holder of more than 200 patents worldwide in petroleum exploration, died of natural causes at his home in Fort Worth, TX. on November 25. In a career spanning the entire age of electronics, his work was at the forefront of modern petroleum exploration from primitive ''thumper trucks'' on the dusty Oklahoma plains to contemporary directional drilling from deep water platforms as in the North Sea. His complex network of related patents in 17 countries made him a dominant player in the field for half a century, successfully taking on some of the giants of industry. Arriving in New York City as an immigrant in 1929, he began his lifelong career in the rapidly developing field of communication electronics. He worked on high fidelity audio circuits in the pioneering era of commercial telephone at Bell Labs, and later at Philco Radio. Moving to Tulsa, OK. in 1936, he worked for Seismograph Services Corporation and organized Wells Surveys Inc. before founding Geophysical Measurements Corporation to carry out his own work in oil exploration electronics which occupied the rest of his professional life. During World War II, he developed inventions including submarine detection devices and a method of aviation gunnery training, as well as re-designing the Geiger Counter into a portable device. In 1985, the US Patent Office formally recognized his creativity as an outstanding American inventor. He enjoyed the domestic applications of his work, from crystal radio to early television to high-fidelity music, as well as international travel on the great liners. He was born in 1908 in Buyukdere, Turkey, where his father was Second Secretary in the Imperial Russian embassy in Constantinople. His family was from a distinguished Saint Petersburg lineage, and included a Metropolitan of Kiev and the eminent Sanskritologist T.I. Scherbatskoy. He grew up traveling the world, as his father was promoted to Tokyo, then Washington D.C. and, at the time of the 1917 Revolution, was Ambassador to South America for Czar Nicholas II. Stateless, his family returned to Europe where he finished his education in Berlin and Paris, and was fluent in French, English, German and Russian. He was married to Mary Ellen Dunham who predeceased him, and is survived by four children and seven grandchildren. A family service was held in his home and no further services are planned. Correspondence may be sent to his office at 6300 Ridglea Place, Suite 914, Fort Worth, TX. 76116.",2002-12-22T05:00:00+0000

Among the reasons, the common denominator was Wal-Mart Stores, which has been moving aggressively into toys, consumer electronics and DVD's, and selling them more cheaply than these stores do. So, what should have been the strongest part of their year, the Christmas selling season, has ranged from disappointing to disastrous. Claes Fornell, a business professor and director of the National Quality Research Center at the University of Michigan, and the chairman of the CFI Group, a consulting firm on customer satisfaction, talked last week about Wal-Mart's latest impact.

The Kurds in the north are allied with Kurds in Iran, Syria and Turkey. The Shiites in the south have strong ties to the Shiites of Iran. Those of the Baath Party are likely to be slaughtered. Beyond all this, what evidence is there that the Bush administration is interested in democracy for Iraq? Our history would suggest a tightly controlled client state instead.

Among other possibilities, the Garden State Wine Growers Association suggests ''May all your troubles in the coming year be as short as your New Year's resolutions'' or the kinder ''In the New Year, may your right hand always be stretched out in friendship, but never in want.'' For a short toast, you could replace ''Cheers!'' with ''Kippis!'' (from Finland), ''Okole maluna!'' (Hawaii) or ''Kia ora!'' (New Zealand). The wine growers' Web site, www.newjerseywines.com, offers a long list of toasts. The group includes some 25 wine growers who produce more than 40 varieties of wine. About 140,000 gallons were produced in the state last year. Dr. Gary Pavlis, a viticulture specialist with Rutgers Cooperative Extension in Atlantic County, said, ''There has been a renaissance in New Jersey as far as the awakening of the desire to grow quality grapes.'' Parts of the state near the Delaware River are prime land for grapes, he said, ''better than anything on the East Coast, and new vineyards are going in like crazy.'' The growers group publishes a brochure, ''New Jersey's Wine Country,'' with wineries, directions to them and a history of wine in the state. Call (609) 588-0085 and say ''Kippis!''

us,Licensed to Last,"Forty years after the first James Bond film, ''Dr. No,'' was released, the series has outlived many of the preoccupations that fueled it: the cold war, the space race, the sexual revolution and the British Empire. JAMES BOND: The Legacy (Abrams, $49.95), by John Cork and Bruce Scivally, is unabashedly a fan's compendium, making little critical distinction between the brilliant (''From Russia With Love'') and the bland (''A View to a Kill,'' Roger Moore's last outing as 007 in 1985). Much of the material is hardly top secret, but there are some delightful tidbits, like a panel from the 1957 newspaper comic strip said to have influenced the casting of Sean Connery, and a photograph of an impossibly lanky Connery with Noel Coward on location for ''Dr. No.'' The book does give a face to otherwise interchangeable directors like Guy Hamilton and John Glen, but is also cluttered with filler. The authors are more concerned with plot synopses and box office than with analyzing how the franchise endured five incarnations of actors and nearly two dozen feature films. Having long ago used up Ian Fleming's original stories, the movie titles now seem to reflect the filmmakers' hopes for the series, like ''Die Another Day,'' with Halle Berry. Newer series like ''The Matrix'' and ''XXX,'' with the gravel-voiced Vin Diesel, have raised the action stakes so high that Bond should be reaching for his Geritol, but the formula of girls, guns, gadgets and evil geniuses churns along as steadily as a vintage Bentley.

If medicine in the golden age of science is so terrific, why are people leaving it in droves -- not just patients but physicians as well? Why do adverse reactions to our pharmaceutical drugs kill nearly 100,000 patients a year (in United States hospitals alone)? Verghese writes that if you come to a medical doctor clutching your stomach, the doctor can now see and measure the distress of your internal organs. But the fact is that the vast majority of gastrointestinal complaints (like irritable-bowel syndrome) are functional problems that modern medicine cannot cure. High-tech approaches can be very effective in the treatment of trauma, medical and surgical emergencies, infectious disease and other serious conditions, but they are not the answer to all health problems. And while it is true that alternative therapies need to be better researched and standardized, a growing number of Americans find them to be safer, cheaper and more effective than conventional methods. I don't see this as an either/or choice. The future of medicine is integrative.",2002-12-22T05:00:00+0000

But suddenly it was beginning to seem as if the project had played itself out; it was proving impossible to secure distribution for his film, and he was stymied as to what to do next. Could that possibly be all there was going to be to it? Years of passionate, solitary work, a few well-received screenings and then nothing -- oblivion?

He contributed significantly to the development of the first space suit and the high speed dental drill. His work on high altitude instrumentation at National Bureau Standards helped the USA WW II effort. After a distinguished career in government consulting and private industry, Iberall was invited to UCLA to pursue the development of homeokinetics. Normal physics, like nuclear physics, deals with processes at single levels, but homeokinetics applies thermodynamics to systems dealing with life, mind, and societies. Iberall published over 200 papers and books, on the flow of information through disparate systems. At the University of Connecticut 1998 Homeokinetics Conference, scientists reported how homeokinetics explains complex systems behavior, in contrast to chaotic theory that has no physical basis.

us,Senate Republicans Choose Frist to Lead Them in 108th Congress," WASHINGTON, Dec. 23  Senate Republicans chose Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, a heart-transplant surgeon with close ties to President Bush, as their leader today. The election of Dr. Frist, which had been regarded as a certainty for several days after other possible candidates stood aside, was made final by acclamation in a conference telephone call among his Senate Republican colleagues this afternoon. Dr. Frist will become Senate majority leader when the new Senate convenes on Jan. 7 with Republicans newly in control. Dr. Frist was expected to make a statement this afternoon in Nashville. His election was accomplished by the unusual telephone hookup among Republican lawmakers scattered across the country. Dr. Frist, 50, takes the place of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, who was undone by seemingly casual remarks at a 100th birthday party for Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina on Dec. 5. Mr. Lott spoke warmly of Mr. Thurmond's presidential campaign in 1948, when he ran on a platform calling for continued racial segregation. Dr. Frist will lead 51 Republicans in the Senate when the new, 108th Congress convenes. His party's narrow majority is expected to make his job tougher, since the chamber operates under rules and traditions that often require 60 votes to get something done. Moreover, Dr. Frist is relatively new to Washington, at least by the standards of some past Senate majority leaders. Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas and Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, for example, had much more experience on Capitol Hill when they became majority leaders as Democrats, and both were acknowledged as masters of the parliamentary maneuvering and arcane procedures that sometimes mark Senate deliberations. But Dr. Frist, the first practicing physician elected to the Senate since 1928, has shown himself to be a quick study in the ways of politics. He was a novice when he was elected to the Senate in 1994 over a seemingly well-entrenched Democratic incumbent, James S. Sasser, whom he portrayed scathingly as a tax-and-spend liberal soft on crime. ",2002-12-23T05:00:00+0000

There's a freedom in that view of life -- the feeling that any one day is as good as the next -- but there's a constraint, too. In all the old legends of Christmas, all the old visions, Christmas contains a sense of release, of surrendering to the day, as well as a sense of hallowedness. The best Noel tales are always those about giving in to Christmas after long resistance. Ebenezer Scrooge and the Grinch may be lost sheep, in the New Testament sense, but they also embody the spirit of release after years and years of vigilant self-defense. To call what this day offers ''redemption'' is to call it something too narrow. To give in to Christmas is to give in to optimism for the nature of humankind, to what Christians, and many others as well, would call the divine spark in human flesh.",2002-12-25T05:00:00+0000

""Today, consumers already have the right to sample wine in a certain venue before purchase,"" Deborah Dowdell of the New Jersey Restaurant Association said. ""I think we have to look at the segment of the population that might abuse it."" The concerns are unnecessary, according to bill's sponsor, Senator Ray Lesniak, who says it is consumer-friendly legislation intended to expose more people to different vintages. &#0160;&#0160; (AP) ",2002-12-26T05:00:00+0000

Mount Mansfield, the state's highest peak, looms over the 230-year-old town, while the West Branch River slices through it, passing an inn, a general store and the quintessential Vermont white-steepled church. The heart of town is the intersection of Route 100, which runs along the spine of the Green Mountains, and Route 108, also known as Mountain Road, which closes in winter just beyond the Stowe Mountain Resort. Many of the village's lodgings, retail shops, restaurants and watering holes are clustered along the eight-mile stretch of Mountain Road between the village and the ski area, called simply ''the hill'' by locals. Stowe's population (just over 4,000 in 2000) has grown only tenfold in 200 years, but the seasonal influx of second-home owners and visitors increases the number of vehicles in town disproportionately. The traffic along Mountain Road can get nasty, especially during the height of winter, so time your outings wisely. If your visit coincides with the Stowe Winter Carnival (Jan. 17 to 26), be sure to take part in one of the many zany events around town, like moonlight turkey bowling on the frozen pond behind the Commodores Inn (www.stowewintercarnival).

After its successful appearance in battle in 1956 and '67 -- the nine-pound gun fired 10 rounds a second, rarely jammed and, thanks to its slight recoil, could be fired one-handed -- the Uzi was adopted by armies and security services around the world.

Certainly the nemesis of the Western world had neither been seen nor heard from since the previous December. And then, last month, he popped up again like the inextinguishable Professor Moriarty.

Jutta married Kurt (Tony), her husband of 37 years in 1965 after a seven-year courtship. The couple met while growing up in the same apartment building in Berlin and both attending the Freie Universitaet Berlin from which Jutta received an MBA. She began her professional career working as a manager in her family's construction business, Hoffmann & Co. After moving with Tony to Duesseldorf she continued her career at the Institut der Bauindustrie and in 1972 gave birth to daughter, Michaela. In 1976 the Leopold family moved to New York City. In New York, Jutta worked as a consultant until acquiring Valimet, a metallurgical company, based in California together with Tony in 1977. Following German reunification Jutta actively supported the decision, together with Tony, to acquire the Chemiewerk Bad Koestritz near Thueringen, Germany in 1991. In addition to her extensive business endeavors, Jutta was a highly regarded leader and member of the American Council on Germany, The Deutsche Verein and the Quadrille Committee as well as a strong supporter of the Roundabout Theater Company and the Central Park Conservancy. A proud wife, mother and businesswoman, Jutta loved life and lived it fully. Living on Central Park South she thoroughly enjoyed looking out over the park where she and Tony often went running together in the mornings after bringing Michaela to her school bus stop. Many humor filled evenings in New York and weekends in Connecticut were spent engaged in discussion and activity with Tony and Michaela as well as close friends. Jutta's joyful spirit, colorful clothing and character and ever-sparkling charisma brought much laughter and happiness to all who knew her.

us,'So What'," Sometime in late 1947, Miles was stopped one evening on 52nd Street by a thin white man in a cap and workers' clothes. Miles had seen him in the clubs, munching salted radishes from a paper bag. What he wanted from Miles was permission to make a big band arrangement of ""Donna Lee."" He was Gil Evans, an arranger for the Claude Thornhill Orchestra. The Thornhill band was something of an anomaly. In a time when dance bands were unambiguously either sweet or hot, Thornhill's had French horns, tuba, flutes, and brass muted in hats, playing together with an almost delicate combination of French impressionism, chinoiserie, and pop song melodrama. What Evans was up to with the Thornhill band when he ran into Davis was simply outrageous: he was attempting to bring bebop sensibilities into this almost fastidiously aristocratic orchestra. Miles had already heard Thornhill's recording of ""Robbins' Nest,"" an Evans arrangement of a piece written by Illinois Jacquet and Sir Charles Thompson for the disk jockey Freddy Robbins. Davis was struck by the sonority of the ""bell-like chords"" they produced and how relaxed their melody lines were - as if the whole band was playing a written-out bebop solo. Miles told a Down Beat reporter a few years later that ""Thornhill had the greatest band, the one with Lee Konitz, during these modern times. The one exception was the Billy Eckstine band with Bird."" Davis was not alone in his regard for this group. Thelonious Monk and Duke Ellington were also fans of its music. Miles told Evans that he could use ""Donna Lee,"" if in return, Miles could see copies of Evans' arrangements of tunes like ""Robbins' Nest."" ",2002-12-29T05:00:00+0000

Of course, there are other luminaries we have left out -- some of whom are pictured above. As usual we have chosen to be reasonably arbitrary, not to make judgments on the worth of an individual life but to examine those who captured the imaginations of our writers. Thus, Tony Kushner envisions a meeting in the afterlife, on the moon, of Geraldine of Albania and Lucia Pamela, two women who traveled in decidedly different circles in the real world. Some of the subjects have particular resonance today: Abu Nidal, the father of modern terrorism; or Cyrus Vance, who by the end of his diplomatic career became convinced that nothing good could come from U.S. military involvement in places we don't understand. And still others are here because we have found people -- a fan, a son, a scholar, an acolyte -- who can bear special witness, revealing the passions and meanings of the lives they lived.",2002-12-29T05:00:00+0000

A football player who believes he is God's latest prophet fails to divine what his message might be: ''At the moment, I'm between revelations.'' When a schoolteacher discovers her husband's infidelity, she thinks back to her own adolescent betrayal of a boyfriend with his close friend, and how ''part of me liked the drama and passion the three of us acted out.'' In the droll story that lends the book its title, a burned-out minister is honored as ''MegaMart's one-millionth customer,'' inadvertently creating a grocery store spectacle. In other tales, an aging worker finds cause to dread retirement parties, a ''chosen'' young baseball player and his father learn to cope with failure, and an estranged couple face the consequences of ''this year's Blizzard of the Century.''

It was there, up and down the three rivers where all that steel got made, that football was converted from a manly game for East Coast elites into a religion for blue-collar stoics. The game was taken up by club teams, steel-mill teams, library teams, church teams, high-school and college teams and, eventually, a moribund professional team called the Steelers. Football was a distraction from Pittsburgh's famously hard-knock life. (As a U.S. Steel executive once said: ''I have always had one rule. If a workman sticks up his head, hit it.'') But football was also a corollary of such a life. In the locker room after one Steelers game, Art Rooney, the team's owner, came upon a lineman who had been kicked in the groin. He had played the entire game, but now hurt so badly that he couldn't even peel off his uniform. As Rooney drove home with his five sons, he clucked with admiration.

Of Scottsdale, Arizona, and Quechee, Vermont (formerly Hingham, MA), President and Chairman of the Zildjian Company in Norwell, MA, died Thursday at his home in Scottsdale. He was 81. Born in Quincy, he attended local schools, including Thayer Academy and Colgate University until called to serve in the Philippines in 1942. Upon his return, he entered the family business, the world's largest cymbal manufacturer and the oldest company in America. An amateur musician himself, Zildjian said he felt privileged to have been born into a musical dynasty, which dates back to 1623. Appointed President two years before his father's death, Armand took over the role of family patriarch in 1977. Zildjian was known for his charismatic personality and warm personal relationship with drummers. He had selected cymbals for such drummers as Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, Max Roach, Jo Jones and many others and matched cymbals for the Boston Symphony and leading orchestras around the world. The foremost authority in cymbal sound, he created new product innovations in response to the ever-changing needs of musicians and remained deeply involved in the operation of the company until his death. Zildjian received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music, was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame, and Guitar Center's Rock Walk in Hollywood, and most recently received Moder Drummer Magazine Editors Achievement Award. In addition to his wife, Andra, he leaves four children, Wendy Mets, Craigie, Debbie & Robert Zildjian, three stepchildren, Kristy Thompson, Mark & Peter Field, eight grandchildren, Paula Charles, Cady & Emily Zildjian-Bickford, Samantha Zildjian, Dakota and Victoria Thompson, Kathryn and Spencer Field, two great-grandchildren, Ian and Gwen Charles, several cousins, nieces and nephews and a brother Robert. Private family services will be held. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to: Armand Zildjian Percussion Scholarship, c/o Berklee College of Music, 1140 Boylston Street, Boston, MA 02215; and the Zildjian Family Opportunity Fund, c/o Percussive Arts Society, 701 NW Ferris Ave, Lawton, OK 73507.",2002-12-29T05:00:00+0000

In 1965, though, he was mostly worried about the approval of his father, Al, a former boxer and top jitterbug dancer from Vancouver, British Columbia. As a single father in Seattle, Al had raised Jimi (then Jimmy) by himself, working odd jobs and making the payments on his son's first electric guitar. Al, who outlived Jimi by 32 years, was always proud of his son's later success. But it was often a perplexed pride. '''Are You Experienced?' was something altogether different,'' Al wrote. ''I'd be listening to it, and just when I'd be looking for it to go one way, it'd go another. I thought: 'Dadgum! He sure has added to his music.'

us,'Domino'," Ishall begin at the beginning. I was born in the village of Upper Buckling, in the county of Shropshire, in the year 1753. Before my birth a gypsy fortune-teller predicted to my mother that I should become a prosperous merchant or a noble statesman. My mother, fortunately, set little store by such pagan superstition, being the wife of a clergyman; and this indeed was the profession she was content to reserve for me despite these intimations of future grandeur. My reverend father likewise refused to believe that the clues to our characters resided in tea-leaves or in the palms of our hands-as the gypsy had confidently asserted-but, rather, held they were to be discovered in our faces: in the conformation of the head, the situation therein of the eyes, the length of the nose, the width of the lips, the shape of the eyebrows, the angle of the jaw. He expended a good many years and a great amount of stationery establishing the irrefutability of this hypothesis, the final fruit of which was a learned treatise entitled The Compleat Physiognomist . What of my own lot in life he may have glimpsed in the blots, blemishes and truculent expressions of my youthful visage he did not reveal, but in any event he was agreed with my mother on the choice of my future occupation. This prospect I did not contemplate with enthusiasm, but as a second son I relented to their wishes, however unprepossessing they were to my imagination, which instead prompted dreams of literary fame or of the popular applause I would achieve with my paintbrush in the salons and exhibition halls of the Continent.

Instead, her name became synonymous with a specific kind of sword-swallowing prowess, an erotic subspecialty she made all her own in the landmark 1972 skinflick ''Deep Throat.'' You don't need to have seen a frame of the movie to be familiar with its ingenious, if ludicrous, premise: a woman is unable to achieve orgasm until a sympathetic doctor discovers that her clitoris resides in her throat. His ''treatment'' called upon Lovelace to perform hitherto unimaginable feats of fellatio -- the more pleasure her character wants to feel, the more oral satisfaction she has to provide. Having been taught by her husband and manager, Chuck Traynor, to suppress her gag reflex, Lovelace, then in her early 20's, was shown in repeated close-ups following the doctor's advice to lengths that did not seem humanly possible.",2002-12-29T05:00:00+0000

us,'Samuel Pepys'," He was born in London, above the shop, just off Fleet Street, in Salisbury Court, where his father John Pepys ran a tailoring business, one of many serving the lawyers living in the area. The house backed on to the parish church of St. Bride's, where all the babies of the family were christened and two were already buried in the churchyard; when he was a man, Pepys still kept the thought in his mind of ""my young brothers and sisters"" laid in the ground outside the house of his youth. Salisbury Court was an open space surrounded by a mixture of small houses like John Pepys's and large ones, once the abodes of bishops and ambassadors, with gardens; it was entered through narrow lanes, one from Fleet Street opposite Shoe Lane, another in the south-west corner leading into Water Lane and so down to the Thames and river steps fifty yards below. The south-facing slope above the river was a good place to live; people had been settled here since Roman times, and when Pepys was born in 1633 a Christian church had stood on the spot for at least five hundred years. A block to the east was the Fleet River, with the pink brick crenellated walls of Bridewell rising beside it; it had been built as a palace by King Henry VIII and deteriorated into a prison for vagrants, homeless children and street women, known to the locals as ""Bridewell Birds."" A footbridge spanned the Fleet between Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill, and from St. Bride's you could look across its deep valley-much deeper then than it is today-with houses crammed up both sides in a maze of courts and alleys, to old St. Paul's rising on its hill above the City.

Traffic volume in and around the mall at Routes 4 and 17 was so bad that not even a mouse could stir. Hordes of last-minute shoppers, combined with an early rush hour, created a jam that prompted the Paramus police to stop motorists from entering the mall from Route 4 to allow cars inside to exit. ''That was only temporary, about 40 minutes,'' said Lisa Wolstromer, the marketing director for the Garden State Plaza. The police diverted motorists seeking to enter the mall from Route 4 to entrances on Route 17, she said. Then, at about 7 p.m., a man was struck by a car and injured while trying to cross Route 17 near the mall, requiring the police to close some north and southbound lanes of Route 17. As a result, traffic backed up for 90 minutes. By comparison, traffic on the first big shopping day after Christmas was ''running smoothly and normal,'' Ms. Wolstromer said Thursday afternoon.

That is half the number who made the trip in 2000, and well below the more than four million who visited in 2001.

Born in Quincy, he attended local schools, including Thayer Academy and Colgate University until called to serve in the Philippines in 1942. Upon his return, he entered the family business, the world's largest cymbal manufacturer and the oldest company in America. An amateur musician himself, Zildjian said he felt privileged to have been born into a musical dynasty, which dates back to 1623. Appointed President two years before his father's death, Armand took over the role of family patriarch in 1977. Zildjian was known for his charismatic personality and warm personal relationship with drummers. He had selected cymbals for such drummers as Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, Max Roach, Jo Jones and many others and matched cymbals for the Boston Symphony and leading orchestras around the world. The foremost authority in cymbal sound, he created new product innovations in response to the ever-changing needs of musicians and remained deeply involved in the operation of the company until his death. Zildjian received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music, was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame, and Guitar Center's Rock Walk in Hollywood, and most recently received Moder Drummer Magazine Editors Achievement Award.

Republicans regained control of the Senate in November after President Bush campaigned around the country. That victory was followed by one in the United Nations, where the Security Council approved a resolution for disarming Iraq. Arms inspectors began their work without interference, but Iraq's required declaration of weapons of mass destruction satisfied neither the Bush administration nor Hans Blix, the head of the inspection team. North Korea posed another quandary for the United States, as it admitted violating a 1994 pact on nuclear plants. A string of resignations ran through the news in December: Cardinal Bernard F. Law stepped down as head of the Boston archdiocese; Henry A. Kissinger stepped aside as leader of a commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks; Al Gore announced that he would not run for president in 2004; and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi gave up his post as majority leader after a furor over remarks in which he praised Senator Strom Thurmond's segregationist campaign for president in 1948.",2002-12-30T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Hoffman appears in nearly every frame of ''Love Liza,'' a piercing study of spousal grief directed by Todd Louiso from a script by Gordy Hoffman (who is the actor's brother), and his omnipresence is something of a mixed blessing. His skills -- for precision and understatement, and for unexpectedly allowing a gleeful, almost crazed energy to burst out in otherwise somber circumstances -- are impressively evident, but the movie is so small and emotionally constricted that it gives him too little room to explore his range.",2002-12-30T05:00:00+0000

In mid-July, Ahmed Omar Sheikh was convicted and sentenced to death by a Pakistani court in the murder of Daniel Pearl; three others received life imprisonment. A few days later, the so-called 20th hijacker, Zacarias Moussaoui, admitted he was a member of Al Qaeda but he denied in a federal court in Virginia that he was part of the Sept. 11 conspiracy. In the meantime, the march of corporate scandal continued, with the indictment of L.

The full scale of the Enron debacle became clear as the company declared bankruptcy and its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, resigned. The Ford Motor Company announced it was shutting down five plants, adding another 35,000 to the growing number of unemployed Americans. And in a precursor of revelations to come, John J. Geoghan, a former Massachusetts priest accused of sexually molesting 130 children, was convicted of the indecent assault of a young boy.

Mencken proper, reincarnated in all his old prejudices, but an observer as critical of the provinciality and double standards of the moment as Mencken was of those in his own time. This is the man who lies at the heart of Terry Teachout's new biography, called, appropriately, ''The Skeptic.'' Mencken's peak came in the 1920's, a decade when America seemed to awake out of a lilac and camphor scented daydream into a more vigorous and honest sense of what life was all about. Some of that was Mencken's doing. He did everything he could to discredit the oppressive pieties of his time, many of which enjoy renewed strength today. He loved a foe almost better than a friend. He had more opinions than he knew how to organize, which made self-contradiction inevitable, and he did not believe in keeping his opinions down for the sake of mere consistency.",2002-12-30T05:00:00+0000
