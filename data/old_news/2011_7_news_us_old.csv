Instead, he crashes to his death. Whats more, just as in Bonfire, the accident creates a downward spiral in the protagonists life that seems to have a momentum of its own.",2011-07-01T16:21:33+0000
us,Taking Stock of Race in Obamas America,"Dramatic stories of hardship and injustice have always been at the center of the struggle for racial equality. Homer Plessy refused to ride in a segregated black train car in late-19th-century Louisiana; the World War II veteran George Dorsey and three other African-Americans were killed by a racist mob outside Atlanta in 1946; Emmett Till was lynched by white bigots in Mississippi in 1955; and in that same year, Rosa Parks sparked the Montgomery bus boycott when she would not surrender her seat to a white passenger. These events and many others inspired activists to press for change and convinced average Americans that change was necessary. The worst abuses of the Jim Crow era have been eliminated, but the moral outrage inspired by a personal encounter with a bigot remains the most powerful vehicle for conveying the injuries and indignities of racial inequality. Accordingly, civil rights lawyers seek out plaintiffs whose grievances reflect larger injustices, and activists rally around people who symbolize pervasive social problems.",2011-07-01T16:23:36+0000

us,Terror of Teenage Life,"If and when you go away to college you can become somebody else; you can kill off your old self and be reborn. So generations of young people have believed. But once they have done it  ditching provincial tastes and hometown boyfriends for a sorority, a fraternity or an undergraduate bohemia  they may trade one conformity for another; they may feel haunted by their former lives. No wonder teenage life, on and off campus, seems to fit stories of vampires, ghosts, the undead. Laura Kasischke is hardly the first to use such figures (as fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer know) but with her new novel, The Raising, she pursues them almost perfectly. Almost a supernatural thriller, almost a campus satire and almost but not quite a coming-of-age tale, The Raising is also the best of Kasischkes eight novels, the one with the broadest canvas, the most observation, its large cast arranged with a scary economy of detail.",2011-07-01T16:24:03+0000

us,Tennis by the Book,"Wow, what a tournament we witnessed this week, Johnny Mac! Before we came back on the air, we were both saying that weve been just flat-out blown away by the talent at this years Intertemporal Tennis Writers Classic. Some of the greatest writers in history came and competed and showed us what it means to write extraordinarily well about tennis. This tournament attracts the worlds sharpest minds because tennis is a global sport thats steeped in tradition, and more, its a gentlemanly clash of wills where youre out there alone, and the way you play reveals so much about who you are. Somewhere between chess and boxing lies tennis. So you have to be an elite writer to get through this tournament. Thats why no one was surprised to see Tour get knocked out in the first round. Sure, hes done some nice stories, like his profile of Jennifer Capriati for Vogue, in which he hits with her. Do we have a clip from that? The whole incident takes on the feel of intense aerobics mixed with a back-alley mugging, and youre just deflecting and defending and, eventually, after eight or nine minutes, your arm starts to throb and your lungs start to shriek and each new shot racing at you is like a punch to the chest and you feel her inner bully. Tours a solid player, but in this tournament your forehand is your vocabulary, your backhand is your eye for detail, your ability to turn words into poetry and rhythm is your volley, your use of metaphors and symbolism is your overhead, and your deep understanding of the sport is your all-important first serve. Tour writes passionately and knows tennis, but some whispered that he might have gotten into the tournament only because of affirmative action. Maybe.",2011-07-01T16:24:46+0000

So I e-mailed the editor, who was this Dan Savage guy. I figured that couldnt be his real name; it was probably some alt weekly stunt. But Dan Savage sent me a bunch of issues, and the paper was brilliant: smart, good-looking, edgy. Inside, the editor wrote a really good sex column called Savage Love, and Iasked my publisher if we could drop our syndicated sex column and replace it with Savage Love. Cant, he said. Too dirty.

I make very clear in my book that the victim is women, Hvistendahl writes  women who in the 1960s and 1970s were used as pawns in a Western drive to reduce birth rates in Asia, women who later aborted female fetuses against the backdrop of patriarchy, and women who, now that they are scarce, find themselves at greater risk of being trafficked, kidnapped, or sold by their parents to men desperate to find wives. Sex-selective abortion is wrong because women should account for half of the human population, and in parts of the world they now account for far less.

us,A Glee Regular Hangs Up His Guitar,"Even singing football heroes cant linger in high school forever. Chord Overstreet, who plays the guitar-strumming Sam Evans, will not be returning to Glee as a series regular, according to TV Line. The shows creator, Ryan Murphy, has made some casting changes for the coming fall season; he has also promoted Darren Criss, who plays Blaine, an openly gay student, and Harry Shum Jr., as the dancer Mike Chang, to series regulars from guest stars. On Friday Mr. Overstreet, finishing up a Glee stage tour, seemed to make reference to the news on his Twitter feed: well its been a good yr, he wrote, too bad its over, time for summer and starting fresh. He also posted about preparing to record an album. But Gleeks need not despair; Mr. Overstreet may still appear on Glee as a guest star, according to people close to the production, and he is expected to be seen in Glee Live! 3D!, a movie about the tour, to open in August. Three seasons in, Mr. Murphy doesnt intend his characters to be in perpetual high school, he recently told Ryan Seacrest in a radio interview. The show to me is about the way you express yourself as you start to move out into the world as a fresh young person, Mr. Murphy later told TV Line. Do we really want to have an eight-year senior? The only way somebody could stay on the show is if they flunk, and that is always a possibility. I think Brittany is pulling straight Fs.",2011-07-05T00:41:00+0000

I think everybody should feel comfortable wearing a bold pocket square, says the democratizing duke, who was raised in Seville but now lives in Madrid.

The clapping protests are organized anonymously on social networking sites for Wednesday evenings and began last month. Some participants stand silently while others clap. Plainclothes police officers typically swoop in and grab those who applaud, sometimes roughing them up. Vesna, a Belarussian rights group, said the police detained about 150 clappers on Wednesday.

Canongate did not provide a date for its release, however. According to The Guardian report, Mr. Assange, left, had expressed concern that the memoir could be used against him by prosecutors in the United States. American officials have been weighing whether to try to charge Mr. Assange since WikiLeaks released a trove of State Department cables, but it is unclear where that effort stands. The book deal was announced in December; Mr. Assange said he expected to earn $1.7 million for the memoir, which was being ghostwritten by Andrew OHagan, a novelist. The memoir was originally scheduled for publication in April 2011 in Britain, although Mr. Assanges American publisher, Knopf, did not release a publication date. With projects like these, you never know about delivery, and you never know about timetables, said Paul Bogaards, a spokesman for Knopf, part of Random House.

The Shabab said its drought committee would work with the organizations. The rebels in the past accused many aid groups of acting as spies and of being anti-Muslim.

Jackie Kennedy wore a red Marimekko dress on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1960; the Marimekko unisex Even Stripe T-shirt was a fixture on the rock and jazz festival circuit in the 70s.

But true believers should get their clicker fingers in shape for July 13, when a trove of vintage Marimekko goes on sale on 1stdibs in conjunction with Katy Kane Vintage and Couture Clothing.

All men and women are shaped by the world in which they live, and it remains unclear to what extent even the figures who loom largest, a Churchill or a Proust, have precipitated or only crystallized the values or visions with which they are now inevitably associated. Another time has other lives to live, W. H. Auden once observed. True enough. But to what extent can a person transform a particular time, even turn it into another time? The question is anything but academic. And when a biographers subject is a 20th-century woman who wants to make her mark in a field hitherto mostly open to men, the question becomes almost alarmingly urgent. Is the story really about a society that has changed enough that a woman can take the next step? Are there cases where the personal triumph actually brings about a social transformation? Or do many of these stories end in a standoff, the woman simultaneously victor and victim, embodying within a society new possibilities that remain in many respects impossibilities?

The look was that of a kid who had just snitched a mango from a fruit stand, and was unsuccessfully trying to conceal it. The cap gun was cold against my chest, yet I maintained a grim, professional demeanor, lest my suspects spot any weakness and get the upper hand. I trailed them among the secret stores and wholesale houses of New Yorks East 20s, a neither-here-nor-there area north of Gramercy Park, where I lived. The place looked innocuous enough, but was clearly teeming with crime. The businessmen I shadowed also looked harmless, to anyone but me. I trailed them at short distances, making it easy for them to notice me, because if the killer did not know he was being followed, no one else would either. I saw myself as acting simultaneously in real time and in a film noir, so I was both tracking my quarry and watching myself do it.

Denise still had Niks zines in a box somewhere. He gave one copy to her and Mom (they had to share), one to his girlfriend of the moment (Nik always had a girlfriend), one was put in a plastic sleeve and filed in his fledgling archives, and one went to their father, who lived in San Francisco.",2011-07-11T20:59:49+0000

McCarthy pulls on some ratty gym clothes, descends three flights of stairs and exits the building, where, when the weather is agreeable, he meets up with about a half-dozen other G.O.P. members on their mountain bikes. Together they cruise along the Mall, past the Lincoln Memorial, across a bridge and along the Potomac River. An hour later, McCarthy will shower in the House gym, head off to breakfast with some other gaggle of Republicans, attend the morning management meeting with Speaker John Boehner and Eric Cantor, the majority leader, huddle throughout the day with his whip staff and committee chairmen and conservative advocacy groups and random needy or disgruntled members until its finally evening and time to round up a bunch of other Republican colleagues for a dinner that can go on for several hours because McCarthy takes it upon himself to draw the others out from their professional shells with questions like, Whats the most embarrassing thing that happened to you at college? or What was the first concert you went to?

McKinney fled the country in an outlandish disguise and, three decades later, made the news again, this time for persuading a South Korean doctor to clone her beloved pit bull, Booger.

As an 11-year-old I had what I figured was a clear idea of what was right and proper, and to me the spanking new Shea Stadium was the home of the Mets, an upstart team that seemed destined forever to inhabit the basement in the National League standings, and not, therefore, the kind of place that deserved the Beatles magic.

Glowing, dramatically shaded geometric planes in tones of brown, blue and green extend outward to cover a wide and ersatz wood frame in this astute and irreverent synthesis of modernist tendencies and tics.

The journal was founded two years ago by Paul Kominek, a musician and sometime D.J. from Germany, with the help of his friend John Roberts, an American musician who, like Kominek, lives in Berlin. By using the topic of traveling as an overarching theme, it gave us an amazing excuse to ask high-profile artists or cultural icons questions that avoid the obligatory What do you do? and How did you get started? and instead ask about different aspects of their lives that we personally find more interesting, says Kominek. The first volume, on Japan, debuted this spring. The cover is printed on textured German cardstock, the interior pages on creamy Swedish drawing paper. It features tips from the likes of David Lynch, James Murphy and Javier Peres, as well as some handsome photographs of traditional Japanese inns, called ryokans.

us,From the Grand Bargain to the Gang of Six,"Like Jon Chait and Matt Yglesias, Im a little puzzled by the sudden wave of optimism about a potential deal based on the Gang of Sixs just-released bipartisan deficit reduction plan. So far as I can tell, the Gang of Six proposal bears a broad resemblance to the grand bargain that President Obama supposedly offered to John Boehner, except that the Gangs tax reform proposals are more detailed (and raise more revenue) and its proposals for Social Security and Medicare cuts are less specific (theres a lot of requiring Senate committees to come up with budget-cutting reforms). Depending on what came out of the entitlement reform process, I suppose that the Gangs proposal could be a better deal for conservatives than what Obama offered Boehner. But more likely it would turn out to be a somewhat worse deal, with higher taxes and fewer real entitlement cuts, than the bargain House Republicans already inclined against when their own leader seemed to be considering it. (I recommend reading James Capretta for the sharpest conservative case against the Gangs proposals, and Reihan Salam for some important qualifiers.)",2011-07-20T21:24:32+0000

The festival, which was started in 1959 and became famous in the 1960s during the heyday of protest songs, has sold out before, most recently in 2002, when Bob Dylan returned to perform there after an absence of many years. But in past years people could always get tickets at the gate, even on the last day of the festival, which is held at Fort Adams State Park on Narragansett Bay. This year, all 20,000 tickets were sold in advance. George Wein, the producer who founded the festival with Pete Seeger, said the Internet buzz was only a sign of something deeper: a resurgence of interest in folk music in recent years, as rising bands like Mumford & Sons have racked up hits on pop and rock charts using a folk template. Alongside established headliners like Emmylou Harris, left, and Elvis Costello, above left, the lineup this year includes hot indie-rock groups with folk-inflected styles, like the Decemberists and the Head and the Heart.",2011-07-20T21:52:20+0000

The announcement came after a new Cabinet was sworn in that did not include an antiquities minister. Egypts antiquities agency had been elevated to a ministry by the former president, Hosni Mubarak, in the last days of his rule; previously it had been under the Ministry of Culture. It still remained unclear, however, who the government intends to appoint to run the office. Last Sunday, officials said the prime minister, Essam Sharaf, planned to replace Zahi Hawass, the longtime antiquities chief, as part of a cabinet reshuffling aimed at appeasing protesters. Since the revolution, Mr. Hawass has come under fire for his ties to the Mubaraks and his financial relationships with American organizations like National Geographic. Mr. Sharaf at first said that he would appoint Abdel Fattah el Banna, a professor at the University of Cairo, as the new minister of antiquities, but he reversed himself after the choice drew protests from archeologists. In the meantime, Mr. Hawass said that Mr. Sharaf had asked him to continue to go to work, according to the Art Newspaper.",2011-07-21T20:45:28+0000

us,Spare Times July 2-28,"Staten Island Outloud: Bessie Coleman (Saturday) She left a legacy of firsts, but Bessie Coleman, an early-20th-century pilot, is not a household name to many outside the aviation industry. She was the first black American woman to become a pilot, and the first black American, man or woman, to hold an international pilots license. (Above, shes with her Curtiss JN-4 biplane in the 1920s.) Her story will be brought to life in a reading from her biographies on Saturday at 3 p.m., commemorating the 90th anniversary of her first flight. Sponsored by Staten Island OutLoud, the reading came about because a board member who had faced sexism when she sought to learn how to fly had developed an interest in female aviators, said Beth Gorrie, OutLouds executive director. Coleman faced both sexism and racism, causing her to study in France. In the United States she became a popular figure, performing stunts at air shows and surviving numerous crashes. But on a flight in 1926 to scout locations for a parachute jump, Coleman, then 34, was in a plane that took an unexpected plunge; not at the controls and not buckled into her seat, she was ejected and fell to her death. Her mechanic, who was flying the plane, also died. Members of the Bessie Coleman Aerospace Legacy, formerly the Bessie Coleman Foundation, are expected to attend the reading; model planes, including a model of Colemans biplane, will be flown. Miller Field, 801 New Dorp Lane, at Cedar Grove Avenue, Gateway National Recreation Area, New Dorp, Staten Island, (718) 907-0709; statenislandoutloud.org; free, but spectators should provide their own seating.

us,Why Writers Belong Behind Bars,"While researching the Marquis de Sade several years ago, I came across an intriguing biographical tidbit: that crazed French libertine, whose string of luridly violent works gave rise to the term sadism, actually began his literary career as a travel writer. In 1775, Sade embarked on a yearlong grand tour of Italy, and wrote an enormous (and enormously tedious) manuscript about the journey entitled Voyage dItalie. The rambling opus, filled with ruminations on Florentine museums and Neapolitan customs, was never completed. Sades attention wandered to more carnal pleasures, and in 1777, he was arrested for a long list of unsavory imbroglios, including one that historians call the Little Girls Episode. Sade was thrown into the prison of Vincennes, and would spend most of his remaining life incarcerated. Voyage dItalie soon joined a range of half-finished manuscripts from his youth, scraps of verse and staid dramatic pieces, none of which Sade ever had the discipline to bring to fruition.",2011-07-22T15:30:32+0000

The problem with the big deals that have been floated to date, Levin points out, is that none of them seriously address the long-term growth of Medicare spending: The entitlement reforms being considered, from retirement-age increases to modest means-testing, will generate only extremely modest savings when set against the projected cost explosion in the coming decades. And so it would be a mistake, he argues, for Republicans to make a significant concession on taxes without getting genuine structural reform to Medicare (along the lines of the Ryan plan, or the more centrist Rivlin-Domenici alternative) in return  a policy mistake, because it would concede too much for too little, and a political mistake, because calling something a grand bargain would leave the impression that our deficit problem has somehow been dealt with, when in fact this round of negotiations is just the opening act for a much larger and necessarily more controversial process of reform.",2011-07-22T17:13:42+0000

us,Asked & Answered | Helmut Lang,"Back in 2008, when Helmut Lang installed a busted up disco ball on the floor of the Journal Gallery in Brooklyn, he explained that, in his mind anyway, the piece related to the Janus mythology  looking back and moving forward. Its also about transitions and new beginnings, representing time as one half respects the past and the other one looks into the future, he said. But with his new installation at the Fireplace Project in East Hampton, N.Y., it appears that the past is no longer an issue for the designer who took what turned out to be a permanent hiatus from fashion in 2005 and has been working full time as an artist pretty much ever since. Make It Hard, as the show is called, comprises about 20 pillar-like sculptures, which Lang created after he shredded the thousands of pieces that remained in his archive. Sad as it may be to think about all of those wasted moleskin coats, lace and rubber dresses and motocross pants, Make It Hard is a poignant realization of Langs long-held conviction that fashion and art have become one. On the eve of the opening, Lang talked to The Moment about art, the passage of time and why there will never be another Helmut Lang sample sale ever again.",2011-07-22T17:38:22+0000

It is still not clear who will run the office, which will again be known as the Supreme Council of Antiquities.

The tacos are excellent, but a big part of the draw is watching the sole longtime chef flipping tortillas, chopping meat and building beautiful tacos at incredible speed, never losing his cool.

Not at the North American box office, where the summers fourth major movie based on comic book characters, Captain America: The First Avenger (right, Chris Evans in the title role) was a strong No. 1 over the weekend, selling an estimated $65.8 million in tickets. That result beat the opening totals for the summers other three superhero films: Thor, X-Men: First Class and Green Lantern.

But the boy wizard fell to second place in the second weekend, taking in about $48 million for a new domestic total of $274 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. Friends With Benefits (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was third with an estimated $18.5 million. Showing continued strength, Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Paramount) was fourth, taking in about $12 million for a four-week total of $326 million.

But it felt irrelevant to the endgame thats currently taking shape in Congress. The president will almost certainly sign any bill that can pass both houses of Congress, and were down to three scenarios for how that happens. Assuming that Boehner can muster enough Republican votes to pass the plan he announced yesterday which would cut a trillion dollars in discretionary spending, raise the debt ceiling for six months, and then empower yet another bipartisan commission try to negotiate a longer-term deal  and assuming that Harry Reid can find the votes to push his plan, with similar spending cuts but a longer debt-ceiling extension, through the Democratic-controlled Senate, then some compromise between the Boehner plan and the Reid plan seems like a natural solution to the impasse. (Ezra Klein has one plausible example of what such a compromise might look like.) However, enough Republicans regard Boehners plan as a sellout to begin with that the speaker of the House might not be able to make that compromise, in which case it becomes a question of who cracks first: Enough moderate Senate Democrats to push the Boehner plan through that body, or enough moderate House Republicans to push a version of the Reid plan through the House. (Note that Nancy Pelosi has endorsed Reids plan, suggesting that most House Democrats would vote for it if necessary.)",2011-07-26T13:26:52+0000

Talks were continuing with the other two major unions at the Met, those representing the stagehands and orchestra. The agreement with the American Guild of Musical Artists, which covers the chorus, was reached in May and ratified on June 19 during the Mets tour of Japan. Met officials wanted to hold off on the announcement until the other two contracts were settled. The chorus agreement was to have expired on Sunday, the same day that the other two agreements end: with the orchestra, represented by Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians; and the stagehands, represented by Local 1 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. The guild employees received 2 percent raises for each year. The talks are being led by Joseph Volpe, the former general manager, who was succeeded by Peter Gelb. Mr. Volpe himself is a former stagehand and is considered well versed in labor matters at the Met. The Met finished this year without a deficit but has an accumulated deficit of $51 million, Mr. Gelb said. Pension funds are $78 million underfunded, and the endowment is $243 million, more than $100 million off its peak before the recession.

Before the judge granted the retrial, a jury had sentenced Ms. Nelson to a year of probation on a misdemeanor charge of vehicular homicide. The driver served six months in jail for the crime.

This is ridiculous.  Youd have gotten a similar reaction if youd gone to a publisher earlier this year with a proposal for a novel that went something like this: journalists on a British tabloid hack into and delete the voice mail messages of a missing (murdered, it turns out) teenage girl. Their activities are exposed by a rival outfit, to widespread public outrage. The paper in question is shut down by its owner, despite having a circulation of millions. Senior policemen, who hired former journalists from the paper as press officers, resign. Evidence emerges of illegal payments from the paper to corrupt police in exchange for information about celebrities, politicians and crime victims. Several journalists are arrested, including two former editors of the paper, one of whom had worked for the prime minister. A whistle-blower is found dead (though police say it isnt suspicious).

Klosterman notes that all of these series grapple with morality  more than anything else, its the reason theyre better than the shows around them. But he argues that the first three examples all create realities where individual agency is detached and questions of personal moral choice arent foregrounded: Mad Men because its set in the 1960s, making its characters actions more a commentary on the era than a window into their souls, The Wire because its more political than philosophical, bent on constantly emphasizing the way everyone is simultaneously good and bad in order to offer a critique of American society as a whole, and The Sopranos because the fact all its major characters were involved with organized crime and its protagonist murdered people for money meant that there were never any unresolved questions over Tony Sopranos goodness.'

He was 42. Police are investigating Irabus death as a possible suicide, according to various reports.Irabu came to the United States in 1997 billed as one of Japans premier right-handed pitchers. The Padres owned his rights, but Irabu refused to play for any team but the Yankees. San Diego traded him to the Yankees, who signed him to a four-year, $12.8 million contract.His career began with such promise, when he struck out nine and allowed two runs as the Yankees defeated Detroit in his major league debut, on July 10, 1997. That start proved the highlight of the season. He was banished to the bullpen and the minor leagues, and he finished the year 5-4 with a 7.09 earned run average.In 1999, Steinbrenner erupted after Irabu failed to cover first base during an exhibition game, calling him a fat toad. In three seasons with the Yankees, Irabu was 29-20 and pitched in only one postseason game, when he came out of the bullpen to allow eight runs to the Red Sox in Game 3 of the 1999 American League Championship Series. Two months later, Irabu was traded to Montreal, where he started 14 games over 2000 and 2001, before finishing his career with Texas in 2002. He retired in 2004 after pitching two seasons for the Hanshin Tigers in Japan. ",2011-07-28T20:37:55+0000

Many of the children Geiger treated were seriously malnourished, so he began writing prescriptions for food  stipulating quantities of milk, vegetables, meat, and fruit that could be filled at grocery stores, which were instructed to send the bills to the health center, where they were paid out of the pharmacy budget. When word of this reached the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, which financed the center, an official was dispatched to Mississippi to reprimand Geiger and make sure he understood that the centers money could be used only for medical purposes. Geiger replied: The last time I looked in my textbooks, the specific therapy for malnutrition was food. The official had nothing to say and returned to Washington.In some ways, the United States has come a long way since Lyndon Johnson declared the war on poverty. But in others, were still at square one. We now have a variety of federally-supported nutrition programs, but the health care system remains senselessly disconnected from the social determinants of health. In this regard, the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world. If a politician in India announced a public health plan that neglected malnutrition, he would be ridiculed. Here, leaders make this kind of omission all the time. Almost all of the debate about the 2010 Affordable Care Act was consumed with questions about health care access and quality.

Three roughnecks harass a group of women when Batman shows up. They have knives, but this Batman (with no real tricks up his sleeve) is a born brawler. When Batman finally beats the tar out of the three guys, he looks at the women with a vacuous stare. The credits then play over Batman listening to a cop-radio mix with Quincy Joness score. After the opening three against one, youve got the clever standoff fight of the heavyweight-boxer type against Batman; the 40-against-one standoff in the alleyway; the marksmen fight with its constant zoom-ins; and the raid on Jokers palace. Had Peckinpah directed these last two sequences (and not, as has been credited, Eastwood, with an assist from Hal Needham), it might be one of the greatest films Peckinpah ever directed.

Melissa Schwartz, the bureaus deputy chief of staff and communications director, wrote in an e-mail, The agency placed Mr. Monnett on administrative leave for reasons having nothing to do with scientific integrity, his 2006 journal article or issues related to permitting, a reference to the bureaus role in permitting offshore drilling. Any suggestions or speculation to the contrary are wrong, Ms. Schwartz concluded. Dr. Monnett was told of the leave in an official letter on July 18, which referred to a continuing investigation by the departments inspector general into integrity issues. A few days before his suspension, a long-running contract involving polar bear research by scientists at the University of Alberta was abruptly put on hold.

The Obama administration objected to the release, citing the privacy of people mentioned in the testimony. But Judge Lamberth wrote that the undisputed historical interest in the testimony, among other factors, far outweighed the need to maintain the secrecy of the records. The transcripts will not be released right away; the government can appeal the decision. Stanley I. Kutler, a leading Watergate historian who filed suit to get the documents last year, said that Nixons grand jury testimony was a rare opportunity to hear him  what should I say?  unplugged. There are no aides, there are no lawyers, there are no spin doctors. With the possible penalty of perjury over his head, Professor Kutler said, My guess is he told those people the truth.
