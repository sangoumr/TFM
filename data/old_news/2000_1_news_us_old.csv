Ms. Hanlin recently opened the Wedding Library, a research refuge at 50 East 81st Street (212-327-0100), where brides-to-be can browse through bound portfolios of photographers, caterers, florists, stationers, makeup artists, bakers and calligraphers and also hear tapes from bands and watch videos of weddings for inspiration. ''I wanted to offer people a chance to see some great suppliers without overwhelming them,'' said Ms. Hanlin, whose library is open free to the public. Suppliers, who pay to be included in the archive, provide everything from a society band for a lavish Pierre Hotel soiree to a Porta Potti for a barefoot-on-the-beach reception, but Ms. Hanlin thinks it's important to keep the number of options manageable. ''We try to find the supplier to fit the need of every kind of bride,'' she said. ''I got hundreds of photography portfolios and narrowed it down to 10.'' KAREN ROBINOVITZ",2000-01-02T05:00:00+0000

He had been ailing for close to two years, from heart failure and then lymphoma, but it still came as a surprise to see him yielding at last instead of rallying, as he had so many times before. My mother took the most extraordinary care of him, which included packing him off to the office for a few hours every day, right up until the week of his death. I rarely visited my father at his office, where he worked as an investment banker, but I knew that its ongoing affairs were more crucial to him, in many ways, than the life he led at home -- just as I knew that his public face as a philanthropist was easier to read than his private face as a father or husband. My father was an Orthodox Jew who had grown up in Leipzig, Germany; he remained committed to Jewish causes until his death, and his knowledge of the dizzying intricacies of Israeli politics was impressive. Throughout his life my father supported Jewish scholarship; he also helped endow the kosher kitchen at Mount Sinai, as well as the Merkin Concert Hall on West 67th Street (which is silent from Friday at sundown to Saturday at sundown, in observance of the Sabbath).",2000-01-02T05:00:00+0000

They're designed to be tucked into a shirt pocket, tied in the hair or thrown into a pocketbook. (They can also be used more conventionally in a dresser drawer or closet.) Marie Dumont, the company's creative director, said the goal was maximum aromatic versatility: wearers can switch scents at will. And the personal sachets also work for people with sensitive skin, who don't react well to direct application of perfumes or colognes. In addition to the spicy fragrance found in the tea bags, L'Artisan also offers small rectangular sachets in amber and blackberry scents, with colorful silk tassels intended to dangle outside a breast pocket. Prices are $10 each for the tea bags and $25 to $35 for the sachets. The first sachets arrived at Barneys New York last week, sold out and are on reorder. Have scratch, will sniff.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Italy's Women Warriors,"PARTISAN WEDDING (University of Missouri, paper, $19.95), Renata ViganRated R's spare and heart-wrenching story collection, is centered on women involved in the Italian resistance during World War II. The author, who died in 1976, was herself a courier, or staffetta, for the partisans who fought the Germans near Bologna; she fictionalized her experiences and those of other women she knew in these captivating and vivid stories. The title story describes the humble wedding of a servant, Marina, to a partisan in a hilltop hideout. Set against the backdrop of wartime Italy, the ominous mood surrounding the ceremony, together with the bride and groom's innocence, establishes the tone for the collection and introduces one of the book's dominant themes: how the clandestine war was fought on a personal level. In ''Campalbo'' a 13-year-old girl whose father was shot by the Germans proudly risks her life to bring newspapers to the partisans hiding in the hills. Many of ViganRated R's stories depict women deliberately using their sexuality in order to achieve a desired goal. In ''Red Flag,'' a woman hides ammunition under her used sanitary napkins. In ''Argelide,'' a former prostitute poses as the madam of a brothel so that Germans won't suspect her house as a partisan meeting place. ''The Last Action'' tells the story of a German sympathizer who seduces a partisan in order to get him to reveal his colleagues' names. Suzanne Branciforte's translation beautifully renders ViganRated R's simple but passionate prose into English, and her informative introduction rightfully claims for ViganRated R the invaluable contribution her writing has made to the literature of World War II.

Burlesque was a stratum of entertainment, not exactly underground but not quite legit -- in the theatrical sense of the word -- which might or might not involve singers, comedians, chorus lines or canned-ham raffles. Its essential feature, however, was women slowly removing most or all of their clothing.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Have a Look! Have Two!,"In a sense, the aerial photographs of Yann Arthus-Bertrand are happy accidents: he took them from aircraft in 60 countries, and composition on the fly is chancy. But the prints are proof that, if the earth itself is not alive, its whole surface is always moving. Wind, water, tectonic plates and people are slow agents, but the marks of change are vast; the images capture eons in a moment. Whether you look down on the Lakagigar volcanoes in Iceland or the man-made windbreaks of the Aran Islands, you know Galileo said more than he meant when he insisted, ''It moves.'' Almost 200 of Arthus-Bertrand's images are lavishly reproduced in EARTH FROM ABOVE (Abrams, $65). The project was sponsored by Unesco, and the book has commentaries by French scientists who worry about humanity covering the planet too fast. But the photographs undermine their eloquence; to paraphrase John Lyly, the pictures are honey though the words are gall. From above, acres of carpets laid out on the sands of Morocco or even the dumps of Mexico City are as gorgeous as the autumn forests of Quebec or the mineral ''forest'' of Madagascar. Shots of the sprawl of monstrous cities are not reassuring, but over all one marvels at how naturally humanity's endless sand-castling fits into nature. And what a work nature is! Everywhere -- in cosmic brush strokes of bacteria in the Grand Prismatic Spring of Yellowstone or minerals washed over by the Rio Carrao in Venezuela -- the earth creates color and patterns that reduce human art to its proper place. ''Earth From Above'' is translated from French (by David Baker), and here and there one is reminded of the pitfalls of translation, as when it tells us the Yankees are ''the most winningest team'' in baseball, and of how iffy proofreading is in any language, as when it says the Maldives are ''120 isles or islets, of which almost 420 are inhabited.'' But it is a terrific book to look at and think about. D. J. R. Bruckner",2000-01-02T05:00:00+0000

The balustrade is a series of vertical posts, called balusters. These support the handrail. One end of the handrail is usually anchored to a wall or a railing at the top of the stairs. At the other end of the balustrade, at the foot of the stairs, is the newel post. It supports the handrail and anchors the balustrade.",2000-01-02T05:00:00+0000

All 10 would be wheeled into an operating room at the Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center, draped, examined and anesthetized. All 10 would be dispatched to the recovery room and sent home from the hospital by the next morning equipped with crutches and a painkiller. But there the similarities ended. For while two of the men would undergo the standard arthroscopic surgery for their condition -- the scraping and rinsing of the knee joint -- and three would have the rinsing alone, five would have no recognized surgical procedure at all. Their surgery would be a placebo, an exercise in just pretend.",2000-01-09T05:00:00+0000

In the late 80's the dance world suddenly faced mortal loss and dire hardship brought on by the AIDS epidemic and swiftly plunged back into the depiction of human drama.

us,Bookend; How Our Crowd Got Lonely,"IN an age that revels in complacency and fragmentation, viewing books as quaint artifacts on the fringe of the entertainment business, we may find it hard to recall that books ever guided national conversations in this country. Sometimes the impact on history has been direct. Upton Sinclair's 1906 polemical novel, ''The Jungle,'' galvanized public sentiment in behalf of the Pure Food and Drug Act. In the early part of the 1960's, ''The Other America,'' ''Silent Spring,'' ''The Feminine Mystique'' and ''Unsafe at Any Speed'' helped the antipoverty, environmentalist, feminist and consumer movements get under way. Sometimes books have mattered not by provoking action but by recognizing patterns, offering big interpretations of life, providing names for what, until the volumes appeared, were nothing more than vague perceptions or diffuse sentiments. A book comes out, crystallizes a fear, a knack or a hope into a big idea, a sweeping interpretation of reality that strikes a collective nerve in a large general public. As in the case of Milton Friedman's ''Capitalism and Freedom'' (1962), a book may become a handbook for a major ideological turn. Rarest of all is the book that penetrates into popular consciousness so deeply that its insights become cliches, its wisdom conventional -- to borrow a phrase devised, in fact, in one such book, ''The Affluent Society'' (1958), by John Kenneth Galbraith.",2000-01-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; More Deadly Than the Male,"Many of the female characters in WOMEN AND OTHER ANIMALS: Stories (University of Massachusetts, $25), Bonnie Jo Campbell's ambitious collection of short stories, are desperately hungry for love or freedom -- or just a good meal. In ''Eating Aunt Victoria,'' a hugely obese woman keeps her food padlocked from her dead lover's adult live-in children and carries ''a purse the size of a roast beef.'' In ''The Perfect Lawn,'' a young man obsessed by a former classmate is seduced by her alcoholic mother, whose body ''threatened to devour not just his personal part, but all the rest of him too.'' These women live trapped in their run-down farms and cabins as if, as the mother in ''Sleeping Sickness'' puts it, they're in jail. The women long to escape their shabby dwellings, to ease or animate their impoverished lives. Instead, they drink, eat or smoke too much and are either frantically or desultorily promiscuous. The men they know are predators: absent, indifferent or casually brutal. When a man does behave kindly, as Michael does toward Gwen in ''The Fishing Dog,'' his unexpected decency cannot dispel her animal wariness. In ''Gorilla Girl,'' a 17-year-old girl finds an outlet for her ferocity by playing a gorilla in a sideshow. ''Occasionally,'' she says, ''a woman rattles with laughter or else sobs in the dark -- she has recognized, in my form, the monster of her own wasted strength.''At another point, she speaks of a pit bull that seems ''to embody the turbulence of my own corporeality.'' It's a wonderful story, despite the incongruity of a girl who growls for a living and snacks on grasshoppers addressing the reader so loftily.

Richard H. Minear, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has chosen 200 cartoons, about half of those Geisel drew, for a fascinating collection, DR. SEUSS GOES TO WAR: The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel (New Press, $25). Most take aim at Hitler, Mussolini and unnamed Japanese leaders. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom Geisel admired, is neither depicted nor mentioned in Minear's excellent text. But Charles A. Lindbergh, whose isolationism offended Geisel, is second only to Hitler in appearances. Some cartoons are funny and others vitriolic. And, as Minear writes, one at least is regrettable: it depicts Geisel's agreement that Japanese-Americans should be incarcerated during the war. The book is divided into four sections -- ''The Home Front,'' ''History and Nazi Germany,'' ''The Rest of the World'' and ''Winning the War.'' The cartoonist Art Spiegelman writes in the introduction that ''one of the great pleasures of this collection of drawings . . . is the affirmation of just how good the good Doctor really was. . . .

Didn't happen, Mr. Smith found. Nonetheless he became consumed with tomatoes, writing books on the history of the tomato in America and of ketchup in America. His third tomato tome, on tbe history of tomato soup in America, will appear in bookstores this month. Not surprisingly, the Garden State figures in much of that story, especially with the development of condensed soup by the Campbell Preserve Company in 1897. Mr. Smith goes on to discuss the marketing of tomato soup, the breeding of soup tomatoes, the establishment of tomato soup as American icon (Andy Warhol's mother served him tomato soup for lunch for 20 years), and finishes with a collection of old recipes.

Half of the photographs in the 30-year retrospective volume THE SIXTIES, by Richard Avedon and Doon Arbus (Random House, $75), have never been published before. Avedon's signature technique of impeccably printed silver-process black-and-white images of his subjects against a seamless blank studio backdrop draws attention to textural details of skin, hair and costume to create portraits of class as well as of individuals. Nattily suited members of an American mission to Saigon are juxtaposed with a Vietnamese napalm victim whose face has been recontoured like melted candle wax. The viewer's gaze lingers over the embroidered battle ribbons of Lt. Joe Hooper, ''the most decorated American soldier in Vietnam,'' as well as his eerily tombstone-like teeth. The images are powerfully placed and selected by Doon Arbus, daughter of the photographer Diane Arbus, but the dated interviews are often hilariously disjointed. Avedon, with his level gaze both at the exhilaration of the era and the toll it took on people's lives, shows that anyone who merely romanticizes the 60's didn't live through them. Eric P.

John ''The Cajun Balladeer DuBois'', a singer who will be posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame, died January 8, 2000 from a stroke at his home in the French Quarter. He was 74. Mr. DuBois was born in Vermillion Parish and lived for many years on the East Coast. He returned to Louisiana in the early 1980s where he took an active part in the state and New Orleans music scene. A popular and beloved performer and friend to many, Mr. DuBois' life spanned at least three careers in entertainment. After performing in summer stock and as a singer and actor in early television in New York City on the ''Colgate Comedy Hour'', with such stars as Jimmy Durante, Fred Allen, Eddie Cantor and Milton Berle, Mr. DuBois spent two decades in the hotel and hospitality industry, but never stopped performing. While residing for many years in Stockbridge, MA., he introduced the Cajun culture of his youth to the Berkshires with ''La Fete Acadienne'' and recorded Cajun ballads for the Folk Music Archives in the Library of Congress. When he returned to Louisiana, Mr. DuBois entered enthusiastically into the state's music world, performing in festivals ranging from New Orleans to Paris, France and leaving a legacy of classic Cajun music on popular CDs: ''Dans Le Creux DuBois'' and ''Rendev-Vous Louisianais''. His third ''Bayou Ballads'' contains a rare collection of ancient, almost forgotten French tunes passed on to him by his grandparents and his childhood music teacher, Catherine Brookshire Blanchett. Referring to his creatively expanded instrumentation, Bruce Boyd Raeburn of Tulane University wrote ''He has infused these songs with a new vitality, not only rescuing them from obscurity but also adding l'esprit DuBois.'' Mr. DuBois' dedication to preserving historic music led to his inclusion in the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. Induction ceremonies will be April 16, 2000 in Lafayette. To be released this Spring, a fourth CD ''It's Never Too Late: John DuBois Celebrates the music of John Wallowitch'' is a collection of cabaret songs and show tunes composed by Mr. DuBois' longtime New York friend and colleague who was best known for his song ''New York, New York''. All Mr. DuBois' CDs are distinguished not only by authenticity of arrangement but also by the ensemble work of some of South Louisiana's finest traditional and contemporary musicians. He wrote of his recording works: ''I came to rejoice in the present by a return to the past. I am lucky to have had a past worth sharing with future generations. I now sing my songs everywhere. I must sing them, I must share them with you.'' Survivors include his wife, Christina DuBois, three sons Andre DuBois of Salt Lake City, UT., Michael DuBois of San Francisco and Christopher DuBois of Stockbridge, MA. and a sister Mary DuBois. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, memorials be sent to one of the following charities: Dr. Tommy Comeau Memorial Fund, to endow a chair in traditional music at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, c/o Acadiana Arts Council, POB 53762, Lafayette, LA. 70501.",2000-01-16T05:00:00+0000

us,What No School Can Do,"Last fall, the New York State Education Department released the results of a fourth-grade math test and eighth-grade math and language tests. It will come as no surprise to hear that the numbers for students in New York City were dreadful. About two-thirds of city eighth graders failed the English language arts test, and about three-quarters failed in math; half the fourth graders failed the math test. The results provided fuel for those who felt that New York City schools are underfinanced, that the city uses too many uncertified teachers, that academic standards are low, that junior high schools are neglected and that the tests themselves are unfair. There's some merit in all these notions. What was not said, however, was the obvious: that the city districts that performed poorly, like those that performed well, scored almost exactly as the socioeconomic status of the children in them would have predicted. You could have predicted the fourth-grade test scores of all but one of the city's 32 districts merely by knowing the percentage of students in a given district who qualified for a free lunch. Only a few dozen of the city's 675 elementary schools scored well despite high poverty rates.

''One act of will, of self-restraint might break the circuit.'' Set in Janvilliers, France, in the 1930's, ''The Girl at the Lion d'Or'' is in part an exacting account of a young woman's descent into a psychological hell of her own making, a fall initiated and complicated by her troubled past and her blinding love for the wrong man. But Faulks's novel, first published in Britain in 1989, also has other things on its mind. With the Great War fresh in collective memory and the threat of another war darkening the horizon, the inhabitants of a small French town are shaped by the political landscape of their day. After her father's mutinous actions on the battlefield at Verdun and her mother's subsequent suicide, Anne Louvet is forced to piece together a new life. Charles Hartmann, her married lover, also served in the war, and it is his relationship with Anne that triggers in him the first stirrings of unadulterated compassion for another being. Anne fears that her life will keep repeating the cycle of abandonment begun in her childhood; Hartmann fears that his newly discovered capacity for sympathy will crack his hardened sense of self, much in the way that a new wine cellar he has commissioned has shaken the foundation of his ancestral home. At one point, the owner of the hotel where Anne works encourages her to visit the local war memorial, where the names of the dead are carved in stone. He asks her to imagine that each name has ''a face, a laugh, a look.'' Faulks engages in a similar intellectual exercise here, and he brings his characters to life with grace and vigor.

From 1937 to 1974 he was the Headmaster of the Rectory School in Pomfret, CT, an independent elementary boarding school for boys and day school for girls and boys. After retiring, he and his wife Marga resided in Thompson and then Woodstock. He was a graduate from the Kent School in 1929 and from Harvard University (A.B.) in 1933. After college, he devoted his entire working life to the Rectory School founded in 1920 by his parents, the Reverend Frank and Mabel Bigelow. Frank was the rector of Christ Episcopal Church, Pomfret. The school started with two boys, John Bigelow and John Holt in the church rectory. ''Mr. John,'' as he was known by generations of students and faculty, first taught at Rectory and then when his father died became the Headmaster. The school grew in size and reputation. In the late 1940's, assisted by his wife Doris and with the guidance of Page and Laura Sharp, he initiated and developed a substantial tutorial program for students with dyslexia, a program to which Rectory remains committed. Although much larger now than in its early years, Rectory remains what his parents and he envisioned, a place that nurtures and develops both mind and character. He has been a member and vestryman of Christ Church, trustee of Rectory and other independent schools, member of the Harvard Clubs of Boston, Northern Connecticut and New York City, and member and treasurer (1959-1973) of the International Dyslexia Association (formerly the Orton Society). Revered and respected educator, devout Christian, and loving and beloved husband, father, friend and colleague, he is survived by his wife Margarete (Koenig) Bigelow, married 1969; two sons from his first marriage to Jean Ferguson Bigelow, John B. Bigelow, Jr., of Baltimore, MD and Blair Bigelow of Cambridge, MA; one step-son from his second marriage to Doris (Gardner) Bigelow, she died 1967, Robert Fisher of Pomfret; and five grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. He was predeceased by his sister Elizabeth Abbott in September 1999. Memorial service Saturday, February 19, at 11 AM in Christ Church Episcopal, Route 169, Pomfret, CT.

When the majority of American Jewry considered day schools parochial and anti-American, Mr. Stone established one of the first day schools, the Hebrew Academy of Cleveland, a benchmark school and shining example of day school education par excellence. He thus paved the way for the phenomenal growth and success of today's North American Day School movement - 600 schools and 170,000 students strong - now recognized as a bulwark against assimilation. Irving Stone has left a profound and indelible impression upon Jewish history. When the great Rav Shraga F. Mendlowitz founded Torah Umesorah, working together with its eminent founding director, Dr. Joseph Kaminetzky, Mr. Stone became their partner and a founding pillar in the lay leadership of the National Day School movement.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; An Immensity of Greatness,"America is great. It may even be the greatest. But just what is it that makes it so great? With the help of a bevy of writers, including David Halberstam, Christopher Buckley and John Updike, Robert A. Wilson, who has produced documentaries for public television, and Stanley Marcus, chairman emeritus of Neiman Marcus, have assembled dozens of short essays and a host of wonderful photographs, paintings and drawings -- more than 250 of them -- pinpointing exactly what it is that has and does make America great. The results are somewhat uneven. AMERICAN GREATS (Public Affairs, $50) is at its best when it uncovers somewhat obscure, unexpected treasures -- like Charles F. Kettering, who invented the self-starter, which changed the face of automobiles forever; the invention of ''the devil's hatband,'' otherwise known as barbed wire; Keeneland, in Lexington, Ky., where the best of the best racehorses are trained (the reader gets a useful betting tip: when unsure of what horse to put your money on, choose the one that's been trained in Keeneland); The Chicago Defender, a black newspaper, established by Robert Abbott, which aided and abetted the migration of blacks from the South to the North; and the Mohawk Indians who work the high beams on skyscrapers and bridges, staring acrophobia in the eye without blinking. Some choices are interesting simply because the subject matter is so absorbing: Thomas Edison, ''Huckleberry Finn,'' The New Yorker, the Iditarod, Coney Island and the Corvette. Others are so obvious that they elicit little more than a ho-hum, like ticker tape parades, black baseball and Thomas Paine. Of course, as the editors say, everyone will have a personal list of greats, which will simply open up welcome debates across this great nation. I wonder about the glaring omission of fast food from this list, in particular Ray Kroc and his brainchild, McDonald's.

Tommy had never formally moved in, but was sleeping over most nights and accumulating stuff and just getting more and more comfortable, which was courtship as I knew it.'' All but one of these stories feature offbeat female protagonists facing some juncture or transition -- mourning a love affair's end, marrying an Estonian to get him a green card, facing an unplanned pregnancy. Barrett focuses on the pathos and dignity of the underdetermined life: the late-20th-century life shaped by improvisation, bad or good luck and the seemingly random impulses of the heart. When her characters rename themselves, they do so less to assert identity than to clean the slate, all the while making clear that the slate is already a well-worn, much-marked surface. A few stories work up striking conceits: in ''Hush Money,'' a ''gardener to the stars'' in Hollywood befriends a lonely recluse who was Marilyn Monroe's friend back when Monroe was Norma Jean and new to town. In ''Elvis Lives,'' Barrett chronicles the predicament of three addled Elvis impersonators under the thumb of a latter-day Colonel Parker. Although Barrett occasionally stretches her form to accommodate a more complex narrative structure, this collection has a certain sameness of tone and stance -- a wry, lucid optimism. Her truest allegiances and richest writing emerge in those stories with musician-heroines (''Meet the Impersonators!'' and ''The Former Star Carlson''): their slightly bruised openness to experience and their straightforward commitment to their art mirror Barrett's own.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  FENTON, ALAN D.","FENTON-Alan D. Died of natural causes, January 1, 2000, in Cleveland at the age of 72. Alan Fenton was an abstract painter in the ''New York School'' tradition of artists, and long time NYC resident and real estate innovator. Fenton's quiet and contemplative nonobjective paintings and drawings were widely recognized for their demanding yet understated means of revealing a serious and sober essence. He identified greatly with Mark Rothko, a friend, as well as Adolph Gottlieb and Jack Tworkov, with whom he had studied privately. Fenton painted in NYC in the late 50's as the explosion of Abstract Expressionism turned into a rebellion against gestural, emotional painting. More concerned about his art than his posture, expanded upon a tradition in painting with influences as diverse as Whistler and Turner as well as Ad Reinhardt and Joseph Albers. Alan Fenton was born in Cleveland in 1927, studied at the Cleveland School of Art, The Arts Students League, The New School, and at NYU, earning his BFA at Pratt Institute, where he later taught painting for many years. At seventeen, Fenton served in the Merchant Marines where he began a career as a professional boxer, a skill he had honed on the streets. He moved successfully through the graphic design business en route to becoming a painter in NY at the height of the art revolution of the fifties and sixties. He moved to NY in 1955 with his wife, Naomi Feigenbaum. She died in 1995. Fenton enjoyed success with his subtle washes and pencil drawings as well as large abstract canvases in acrylic, landing one-man shows at the prestigious Pace Gallery in NY, The NY Cultural Center Museum, The Barbara Fielder Gallery in Washington, et al. In his introduction to Fenton's exhibition catalogue for his one-man show at the Phillips Collection in Washington, Vincent Melzac wrote, ''Fenton is his own man, producing work that is uniquely his...in his work one feels that Fenton is testing the accepted and pushing for a newer and richer visual experience.'' Fenton's work resides at The Hirschhorn Museum of Art, The Corcoran Gallery, The Cleveland Museum of Art, The Smithsonian, and countless others as well as in private collections. In the late 60's he turned his artistic vision and NY business savvy towards developing creative environments where ''good and beautiful people'' could live and work together. His first endeavor was to turn the Tiffany Glass Building on lower Park Avenue into an artistic community where notable photographers, painters, and filmmakers moved in, setting the stage for a modern, hip, yet warm and friendly working space for the community which he had nurtured. He later developed the first live/work loft in Cleveland, where Fenton resided during his last years. Fenton is survived by his daughter Danielle, son-in-law Bill Garrity, their two children Adam and Gabriel, and his son David, all of NYC. He leaves behind a brother, Calvin Freedman of Tarzanna, California, and a sister, Marilyn Gelman of Boca Raton, Florida. Fenton had said about his own work, ''All that happens in my work is natural and human, hard and soft, large and small, heaven and earth. All this with the image of man, (my glow) forms a system to attain the sublime. All of these paradoxes form a triad that is the way of everything. The line is the 'hard', the formless form and the imageless image is the 'soft'. They are inseparable, one cannot exist without the other.''",2000-01-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Editorial Observer; What Happens if the Budget Surplus Is Real?,"There has been a large dose of unreality to the presidential debates from the start. Each of the major candidates proposed paying for initiatives by tapping surpluses that were more speculative than real. True, the Congressional Budget Office had told them that the federal surplus, outside the Social Security program, would equal about $1 trillion over the next 10 years. But that estimate was based on a highly debatable assumption -- that Congress would adhere to onerous spending caps it set in 1997 to achieve a balanced budget. Those caps were broken open this year, a measure of the difficulty in meeting them. If scrupulously observed the next two years, the caps would require Congress to cut non-military discretionary programs by an astonishing 30 percent and then maintain the programs at that level for the next decade. Virtually no one expects Congress to inflict that much pain. Under the more reasonable assumption that Congress keeps current programs intact, there will be no federal surplus.",2000-01-25T05:00:00+0000

He graduated from Philadelphia's renowned Central High School and received a BA in journalism from Temple University, where he served as an editor of the Temple News.

In the early 1980's, Mr. McGarry returned to Washington to lead Heublein's Government relations team. At both International Minerals Corp. and Heublein, Mr. McGarry had developed and coordinated a corporate-sponsored collection by world-renowned artists and sculptors.

The latest chapter -- its reincarnation, above, within the shell of the monumental New York Post Office -- is now under way to intense scrutiny. New Yorkers can see the epic unfold at ''Gateway to Metropolis: New York's Pennsylvania Stations,'' an exhibition at Columbia University's Wallach Art Gallery, opening on Wednesday.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; There's Something in That Lake,"Irene Ziegler's often sparkling, occasionally choppy collection of linked stories, RULES OF THE LAKE (Southern Methodist University, $19.95), opens in 1965, when 9-year-old Annie Bartlett yearns to becomes a mermaid -- sequined costume, air hose, flowing hair and all -- at Weeki Wachee Springs near her central Florida home. In 14 tales tracing the next seven years, Ziegler assembles a wry, freshly detailed coming-of-age story around Annie. The excellent title story reveals the kind of shadowy, shameful family secrets that never seem more glaring than in a postcard-perfect climate: Annie's depressed mother obsessively swims laps in Widow Lake, which abuts the Bartlett's shabby house; Annie's teenage sister, Leigh, taunts their father, who delivers fuel oil, for having an affair; and Annie -- only partially understanding her parents' marital troubles -- has a run-in with a mysterious lake creature. Throughout the book, Widow Lake shimmers with changeable symbolism -- sometimes as Annie's haven from worldly problems, sometimes as an unfathomably dangerous place -- but always offering a reflection of each story's psychological undercurrents. Unfortunately, several tales feel muddied by an overcrowded series of unhappy or tragic events -- such as those in ''Hooked,'' which somewhat numbingly recounts a sexual molestation, physical abuse and suicide. But in stories like ''The Treasure Hunter's Daughter'' -- in which Annie accompanies her handsome, moody, sometimes violent father on his searches through old dumps with metal detectors, only to discover the truth about his feelings toward her -- Ziegler's dry wit and facility with metaphor offer a visceral evocation of a not-so-sunny childhood.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  TELTSCHER, HERRY, O., DR.","TELTSCHER-Herry, O., Dr. A much beloved Viennese born psychotherapist, a distinguished clinical psychologist and world renowned handwriting expert, died on January 27 in New York. He lived fully until his unexpected passing at age 89, still vital, active and seeing clients. Dr. Teltscher was the author of two books on Grapho-Diagnostics. He had more than 60 years of experience as a handwriting expert in Europe and the United States and was widely respected for his pioneering efforts in the use of writing as a diagnostic tool in psychiatric and medical disorders. He was a member of military intelligence in the U.S. Army during WWII. In years past he worked closely with research physicians investigating the effects of Parkinson's Disease on handwriting. Another paper written with W.G. Eliasberg, M.D., PhD. postulated that Roosevelt was already ill at Yalta by examining his handwriting, an observation that was only recently validated by Roosevelt's personal physician. His published paper on Lee Harvey Oswald was submitted to the Warren Commission and his blind analysis of the socalled Swiss Nanny is reported in a segment of Joyce Egginton's book, ''Circle of Fire''. He published numerous articles in the scientific press and in popular magazines such as Vogue and Glamour. As an expert document examiner he testified in many court proceedings and was a Fellow of the American College of Forensic Examiners. In 1986 he was honored by the American Psychological Association for distinguished contribution to clinical psychology. As Director of Supervision for the Morton Prince Clinic for Hypnosis. He was also considered one of the foremost pioneers in the use of hypnosis and relaxation techniques in therapy. He taught self hypnosis to his clients to give them a greater sense of mastery. His positive, creative and comforting spirit was an inspiration to all who knew him. He was the father of John, Nina and two daughters from an earlier marriage, Elizabeth Timberman and Susan Telcher. He is survived by his wife of 37 years, Betti and his sister, Jane Melvin of California. He is dearly missed by all who loved him and who hoped he would live forever. And so he will in our hearts.

A true visionary, Mr. Schubart transformed the way that students and teachers interact with the arts by building Lincoln Center Institute into one of the nation's leading arts in education organizations. Under his nurturing leadership, the Institute's success grew into an international movement, with a network of affiliated institutes across the country and overseas. After completing two decades of service, Mr. Schubart became the Institute's fourth Chairman of the Board (1995-1998), and was subsequently named Chairman Emeritus. He first joined Lincoln Center in 1963 as its Director of Education, after serving as Director of Public Activities, Dean, and then Vice President of The Juilliard School of Music. Though his passion and commitment to the cause of education will be sorely missed, his spirit shines brightly through the ongoing work of the Institute.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  FENTON, ALAN D.","FENTON-Alan D. Died of natural causes, January 1, 2000, in Cleveland at the age of 72. Alan Fenton was an abstract painter in the ''New York School'' tradition of artists, and long time NYC resident and real estate innovator. Fenton's quiet and contemplative nonobjective paintings and drawings were widely recognized for their demanding yet understated means of revealing a serious and sober essence. He identified greatly with Mark Rothko, a friend, as well as Adolph Gottlieb and Jack Tworkov, with whom he had studied privately. Fenton painted in NYC in the late 50's as the explosion of Abstract Expressionism turned into a rebellion against gestural, emotional painting. More concerned about his art than his posture, expanded upon a tradition in painting with influences as diverse as Whistler and Turner as well as Ad Reinhardt and Joseph Albers. Alan Fenton was born in Cleveland in 1927, studied at the Cleveland School of Art, The Arts Students League, The New School, and at NYU, earning his BFA at Pratt Institute, where he later taught painting for many years. At seventeen, Fenton served in the Merchant Marines where he began a career as a professional boxer, a skill he had honed on the streets. He moved successfully through the graphic design business en route to becoming a painter in NY at the height of the art revolution of the fifties and sixties. He moved to NY in 1955 with his wife, Naomi Feigenbaum. She died in 1995. Fenton enjoyed success with his subtle washes and pencil drawings as well as large abstract canvases in acrylic, landing one-man shows at the prestigious Pace Gallery in NY, The NY Cultural Center Museum, The Barbara Fielder Gallery in Washington, et al. In his introduction to Fenton's exhibition catalogue for his one-man show at the Phillips Collection in Washington, Vincent Melzac wrote, ''Fenton is his own man, producing work that is uniquely his...in his work one feels that Fenton is testing the accepted and pushing for a newer and richer visual experience.'' Fenton's work resides at The Hirschhorn Museum of Art, The Corcoran Gallery, The Cleveland Museum of Art, The Smithsonian, and countless others as well as in private collections. In the late 60's he turned his artistic vision and NY business savvy towards developing creative environments where ''good and beautiful people'' could live and work together. His first endeavor was to turn the Tiffany Glass Building on lower Park Avenue into an artistic community where notable photographers, painters, and filmmakers moved in, setting the stage for a modern, hip, yet warm and friendly working space for the community which he had nurtured. He later developed the first live/work loft in Cleveland, where Fenton resided during his last years. Fenton is survived by his daughter Danielle, son-in-law Bill Garrity, their two children Adam and Gabriel, and his son David, all of NYC. He leaves behind a brother, Calvin Freedman of Tarzanna, California, and a sister, Marilyn Gelman of Boca Raton, Florida. Fenton had said about his own work, ''All that happens in my work is natural and human, hard and soft, large and small, heaven and earth. All this with the image of man, (my glow) forms a system to attain the sublime. All of these paradoxes form a triad that is the way of everything. The line is the 'hard', the formless form and the imageless image is the 'soft'. They are inseparable, one cannot exist without the other.''",2000-01-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Death Valley Daze,"The Mojave is the smallest of North America's four deserts, stretching across 35,000 square miles in the region where Arizona, Nevada and California converge. Its best-known landmarks are Death Valley National Park in the north and Joshua Tree National Park in the south, and, despite the popular image of the desert as a barren moonscape, the Mojave is rich with flora and fauna and features enormously varied terrain, with elevations ranging from 282 feet below sea level to about 4,000 feet above sea level. All of this is brought to life with startling clarity in THE DESERT: The Mojave and Death Valley (Abrams, $49.50). Jack Dykinga's photographs capture the extraordinary blooming of desert plants brought on by the unusually heavy rainfall from El Nino in the winter and spring of 1997-98, an explosion of lupine, primrose, prickly pear and other colorful flowers. There are also more familiar images of sand dunes in Death Valley's blistering heat, canyons and foggy vistas of Joshua trees. Perhaps most surprising is the chapter on Racetrack Playa, a flat, dry lake bed where rocks mysteriously slide across the silt on their own, leaving weird zigzagging tracks behind them as they make their way along. Janice Emily Bowers's text is a heartfelt, closely observed testimonial to the desert's unexpected beauties. After a while, one may long for a little of the snaggle-toothed crankiness of Edward Abbey, a far feistier chronicler of the Southwest, but that may be beside the point. After all, this is a paean, pure and simple: ''Our job is to show you why we love the Mojave Desert, and why you might love it, too.'' Scott Veale",2000-01-30T05:00:00+0000

''The whole opera would suffer,'' Hofmannsthal wrote Strauss in 1910, ''if the personality of the Marschallin were to be deprived of her full stature.'' But what that stature means is that the Marschallin is alone. Even her lover, so young, so triumphant, is incapable of understanding what she tells him, and us, about time.",2000-01-30T05:00:00+0000

John Metzger, who lines up business for the Enviro-Feed, says he knows of no other company like it in the country. Clients include the Hiltons at Short Hills, East Brunswick, and the Newark Airport, a number of supermarkets, Merck & Company and some state prisons; Mr. Metzger said all of them save perhaps $6,000 to $10,000 a year in garbage collection costs.
