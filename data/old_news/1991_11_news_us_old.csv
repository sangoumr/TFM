Snow Shovels Cost: $7 to $20. Suitable for small and light jobs. Types: Deep or wide scooop in lightweight highly durable plastic, from 12 to 18 inches wide. For slightly heavier jobs use a 24-inch-wide aluminum shovel.

Electric Shovels Cost: $80 to $120. Suitable for narrow and short pathways, patios, decks. Will normally clear a 12-inch-wide path. One example is the Electric Power Shovel by Toro. Electric Snow Blowers Cost: $190 to $300. Suitable for driveways. Clear a 12- to 22-inch-wide path, depending upon model. Example: Toro's 1200 or 1800 Electric Snow Thrower. Gasoline-Powered Snow Blowers Cost: $300 to $1,200. Suitable for long and hilly driveways without access to electrical outlet. Clear 20- to 32-inch path.

us,"IN SHORT: BOOKS & BUSINESS;
Pax Nipponica","Many authors, in trying to explain the rise of Japan's industrial star and the fall of America's, have pointed to the connections between Japanese business and government. William S. Dietrich, the president of Dietrich Industries, a Pittsburgh building-products manufacturer, does more than point. In his book IN THE SHADOW OF THE RISING SUN: The Political Roots of American Economic Decline (Pennsylvania State University, $24.50), he examines the Japanese institutions that foster such cooperation and deplores the absence of American counterparts. He studies the comprehensive industrial policy that the relationship between Japanese business and government allows, and compares it with the often haphazard, every-firm-for-itself structure that exists in the United States. And he traces the histories of the two countries to show where such differences originated. His conclusion is a gloomy one. What is needed, he writes, is an American equivalent of the Japanese system: ""a capitalistic free-market system . . . tempered by strategic considerations arrived at through consultation and bargaining between government and business."" In other words, the only way the United States can compete is to recast its business-government relationship thoroughly along Japanese lines. Such a shift would mean abandoning a fondly held distrust of government that has permeated our society for more than 200 years, and it would necessarily involve huge changes in countless other aspects of American life. Such a shift is unlikely, to say the least, and even the author holds out little hope for it. Instead he offers a shock treatment, a look at the economic state of the world circa 2015. In this new world order, which Mr. Dietrich calls Pax Nipponica, Japan has gained ""uncontested dominance in every leading-edge industry"" -- including computers, nuclear power and defense. Japan's gross national product is twice that of the United States, which, along with the European Community, now ranks as a ""third-tier nation"" whose role is to produce middle-technology products and provide a market for high-tech goods from Asia. Japan owns 40 percent of American manufacturing assets and holds 50 percent of American bank assets. Interest rates, debt levels and currency-exchange rates are all set in Tokyo. There is lots more, and it isn't so farfetched; in fact, it is a far more likely scenario than the radical changes Mr. Dietrich prescribes. Let us hope that he is wrong.

THE SUDAN Abu Baker Al-Shingieti, counselor at the Sudan Embassy, and his wife, Iman, involve their children -- a son, Hasan, 4 years old, and a daughter, Sumayya, 2 -- when they entertain informally. ""I want them to be able to talk to people who are different from them,"" said Mr. Al-Shingieti, who always hires a baby sitter for such an occasion. A room with toys is reserved for the children, who also have their own dining table, where they are served mild versions of traditional Sudanese dishes and ""neutral"" fare, such as rice and pita bread. SWEDEN Anita Petersson, wife of Sven Petersson, the deputy chief of mission of the Swedish Embassy, freezes flowers around a bottle of vodka, resulting in a sculpture that is both a centerpiece and a decanter. ""We use yellow and blue flowers for our national colors, but you could use any small blossoms, like violets, pansies or even bud roses,"" explained Mrs. Petersson, ""or colorful leaves in the fall.""",1991-11-03T05:00:00+0000

Consumers who may not qualify for an ordinary card -- those hurt by the recession, divorce, bankruptcy or layoffs -- can often get a secured Visa or Mastercard issued by a reputable bank. But the secured cards require a money deposit as collateral. The higher the deposit, the higher the credit limit. A secured credit card offers a chance to repair a credit history, or start one, since card behavior is reported to the major credit bureaus. For a list of issuers of secured credit cards, send $4 to Bankcard Holders of America, 560 Parkway, Herndon, Pa. 22070; telephone (703) 481-1110. Here are some pointers on secured cards. Minimum deposit: From $250 to $500, usually earning 4 percent to 5.25 percent interest. The deposit cannot be withdrawn while the card is held, and the money is kept on deposit for at least 45 days after the account is closed to allow all charges to clear. Finance charge: Depending on the bank, the rate will range from 19 percent to 22 percent. Annual fee: $25 to $35 Restrictions: Some banks require applicants to have a checking or savings account, with store and other accounts not seriously overdue, and bankruptcy disputes settled.

Mr. Wofford was 40 percentage points behind Mr. Thornburgh, a popular former Governor, as the race began, but had hammered away at related themes: that President Bush's policies had damaged the economy and particularly the middle class, and that the United States badly needs national health insurance. Pennsylvania voters told pollsters that national health insurance was the No. 1 issue on their minds. On Thursday, Republicans in Congress introduced a new bill to create an insurance plan; it includes tax credits to help people buy insurance, millions for new clinics and regulations on insurance premiums. More Congressional Democrats spoke up for their own bill, which is modeled on Canada's system. Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice becomes the state's first Republican governor since 1876, ousting the incumbent, Gov. Ray Mabus. In a bitter campaign, Mr. Fordice, a wealthy construction contractor, painted Mr. Mabus as a liberal in the Kennedy tradition and charged that he had bloated the state's payroll as its economy slid downhill. And, although he rejected comparisons with David Duke next door in Louisiana, he introduced racial themes late in the race, stressing his opposition to quotas and attacking welfare recipients. Kentucky Governor Lieut. Gov. Brereton C. Jones, a Democrat, gets 65 percent of the vote for governor, easily defeating a seven-term Congressman, Larry J. Hopkins. Mr. Hopkins had received campaign help from President Bush but was hurt when it was revealed that he was one of the lawmakers who wrote bad checks on the House of Representatives bank.

Since the composition was first performed in 1899, audiences and scholars have tried to guess just what that hidden theme could be. Last week it was revealed that Joseph Cooper, a British pianist, may have solved the riddle at a concert 30 years ago, keeping to himself his discovery that the ""Enigma"" theme bore a strong resemblance to one in Mozart's ""Prague"" Symphony. ""I had got the score with me, and was reading along with the music,"" he said, when he thought he heard echoes of Elgar. ""I wrote on the cover, right away, 'Enigma,' "" he said. Mr. Cooper recently confided in Jerrold Northrop Moore, an expert on Elgar, who revealed the finding in The Sunday Telegraph in London. Though the Mozart theme is in G-major and the Elgar in G-minor, and the rhythms are different, Mr. Moore said, ""It's a better idea than has been put forward by anybody else.""",1991-11-10T05:00:00+0000

Surely, he should not be expected to answer these charges from a 1990's-informed perspective.

Fans everywhere stopped to ask each other whether it could be true. Several told sportswriters that no moment had struck them with such force since the day they had heard President Kennedy had been shot. That, in itself, is a testament to Magic Johnson's appeal. So is the way the news flew around the world. It made front pages in Italy, Israel, Australia and Japan, countries that are now nearly as basketball-mad as the United States, and were made so partly by a player named Earvin Johnson whose fake-you-out moves and win-you-over smile had helped revitalize the game. And as fans wept and marketing executives muttered darkly that he would see the $12 million a year he earns in endorsements slink shamefully away, Magic showed his trademark positive attitude, saying he wanted to become a spokesman for AIDS prevention, using his celebrity to help young people ""understand that safe sex is the way to go.""

On the Road","Andrew H. Malcolm, the national affairs correspondent for The New York Times, and Roger Strauss 3d, the managing director of Farrar, Strauss & Giroux, traveled all 2,500 miles of U.S. Highway 1 -- it is actually a former Indian path, running from northernmost Maine all the way down to Key West -- and then collaborated on U.S. 1: America's Original Main Street (St. Martin's, $29.95). On Highway 1 through New Jersey, Mr. Malcolm observes how ""on the brief but grim 3.4 mile Pulaski Skyway, which was intended to honor a Polish nobleman killed in fighting for the American Revolution, vehicle wheels crunch the glass from last year's accidents."" Just south of Philadelphia, he points out the site of the Battle of Brandywine, ""where Lafayette was wounded and not far from Valley Forge and the worldwide headquarters of AAMCO Transmission service."" Elsewhere, Mr. Malcolm provides an interesting explanation of how traffic planners in many towns decided to eliminate downtown congestion by rerouting the through traffic around the edge of town; too often, though, these bypasses would end up killing off the downtowns. When the author uses Highway 1 as an observation deck for viewing signs of the country's changing social landscape -- the ""creeping suburbanization erasing rural America"" -- the book works well enough. What becomes a bit tiring, though, is his unrelenting soft focus on the good old days.

Earlier, top-seeded Jim Courier of the United States came from behind to beat Karel Novacek of Czechoslovakia, 6-7 (8-6), 7-5, 6-4. Also, Ivan Lendl routed Guy Forget of France, 6-2, 6-4, in 73 minutes. Agassi never dropped his serve and broke Becker's once in each set to post his fifth straight victory over the German. The year-ending, $2.25 million tournament includes the top-ranked eight players in the world. They are split into two round-robin groups, with the top two from each group advancing to the semifinals. (AP) Fernandez Upset by Schultz: Brenda Schultz used an overpowering serve yesterday to upset fifth-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez, 6-1, 2-6, 6-4, in the first round of the $350,000 Virginia Slims of Philadelphia tournament. In 17 previous tournaments in 1991, Fernandez, the world's seventh-ranked player, had not lost in the first round and had advanced as far as the quarterfinals in 15 of the events. (AP) GOLF Baker-Finch in Lead Ian Baker-Finch, the British Open champion, played a steady if unspectacular round of four-under-par 68 yesterday and took a one-stroke lead over Masters champion Ian Woosnam in the $1 million P.G.A. Grand Slam of Golf at Kaui Lagoons, Hawaii. The 36-hole tournament brings together the winners of the year's four major tournaments. Baker-Finch had four birdies and no bogeys during his tour of the 7,035-yard Kiele Couse at the Kauai Lagoons Golf Club. Woosnam birdied No. 17 to pull within one shot of the lead after an erratic round of six birdies and three bogeys. Payne Stewart, the United States Open champion, was two strokes back at 70. The P.G.A. champion, John Daly, rebounded from a miserable start to shoot a three-under 33 on the back side for a one-over 73. (AP) N.H.L. Whalers Top Nordiques Marc Bergevin scored with 5 minutes 29 seconds left as the Whalers survived giving up a two-goal third-period lead to beat Quebec, 5-4, last night before the eighth-smallest Hartford crowd ever.

Segments of conversations conducted beginning in 1986 between the photographer and the author, who died this year, serve as a commentary on the photographs. Singer finds Florida cafeterias that remind him of the Yiddish Writer's Club in Warsaw and hotels that recall different villages in Poland. He discourses on God, the Bible and the Yiddish language. Some of Mr. Nagler's photographs display a similar sense of irony and humor: elderly swimmers gawk at a young topless woman invading their ocean; a woman with different-colored rollers in her hair has eye shadow applied by a makeup artist at the Hollywood Beauty Salon; men in suits carry prayer books across white sand to their temple. ""Photography is important because it takes a minute and makes it an eternity,"" Singer comments. ""And so goes art, if it's right."" This buoyant blend of words and images captures both the idiosyncratic spirit and the deep sadness of these South Beach survivors. ""I met many saints and sinners,"" Singer says, ""and sometimes they were the same person.""",1991-11-17T05:00:00+0000

The first coffee shop in Tokyo opened in 1888, but soon closed; by 1897 there were 143 shops in Tokyo alone. Like baseball, it has become a Japanese institution. As with other institutions here, ritual goes hand in hand with quality.

us,Business Diary/November 10-15,"COMPANIES The Economic News Was Bad, but the Market Was Worse Last week, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 120.31 points to finish the week at 2,943.20, it was the stock market's fifth biggest tumble ever. Analysts were quick to point to the week's bad news: Retail and auto sales were off and the Producer Price Index rose unexpectedly. ""Concern about the economy is clearly intensifying,"" said Hugh Johnson, an analyst at First Albany Corporation in Albany, N.Y. But on reflection, the news last week was not so different from the week before -- or the week before that. So why did the market drop? ""There's a general pattern that the amount of the movement doesn't necessarily match up with the news,"" said Lawrence Summers, chief economist at the World Bank in Washington. ""That's a puzzle to people who believe in a perfectly rational market,"" Mr. Summers said. Traders sitting at computers also have tools that make selling easier. ""That exacerbates things when the market goes down,"" Mr. Summers said. Midway Left Out in the Cold Midway Airlines thought it was being handed a lifeline when Northwest Airlines said it would acquire the bankrupt carrier by taking over its $153 million of debt. But Midway, based in Chicago, ended up feeling it had been handed a line when Northwest abruptly withdrew from the deal. Last week Midway, which employs 4,300 people, shut down. ""There's no choice. We don't have any money,"" said David Hinson, Midway's chairman. Analysts say the deal unraveled partly because Northwest, a unit of cash-strapped NWA Inc., based in Minneapolis, had received a $740 million loan from the state of Minnesota. Midway's precarious existence -- it was losing $1 million a day -- made Minnesota officials nervous. But Northwest said the deal was off because Midway gave it misleading financial information. Midway disagrees. Fifty-nine Midway planes remain where they last touched down. Barbie, Minnie and Dumbo Too They have been tumbling off the assembly line together since 1987 -- Barbie, G.I. Joe and Mickey and Minnie Mouse, that is. Last week, the Walt Disney Company and Mattel Inc., which already reaps $160 million in sales from its Disney-related toy line, agreed to extend their licensing agreement for 10 years. The new agreement will give Mattel the right to produce more Disney characters. Pinnochio, Bambi and Dumbo will be added to the list as well as all 101 Dalmations. DEC Sides With Microsoft Since summer, the International Business Machines Corporation has entered into more alliances than a delegate at a Presidential convention. But last week, its rival, the Digital Equipment Corporation, the nation's No. 2 computer maker, made an alliance of its own with I.B.M.'s arch-nemesis, the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's No. 1 software maker.

us,Guidepost; For That Holiday Glow,"It's not too soon to buy holiday lights, with Hanukkah on Dec. 2 and Christmas not so very long after. It's wise to check on regulations covering outdoor lighting because many communities have ordinances that prohibit lights that shine directly into a neighbor's window or interfere with a passing motorist's vision. Condominiums and co-ops often have strict rules that may restrict outside lighting to a specific season -- say, 14 days before and after Christmas Day. Safety is important. Don't overload circuits or allow hot lights near anything combustible. Here is a sampling of this year's offerings. Miniature Light Strands: Plain, colored, flashing or simple on-and-off are the staples. Strands normally have 50 to 100 lights and can be bought for as little as 89 cents (for a house brand like Sears) to $4.99 for a strand with a brand name. Kodak has a new feature on its lights called lamp lock, which prevents the bulbs from falling out of their sockets. Musical Lights: New on the market, these play holiday music. Two examples are ""Christmas Musical Lights,"" offering 21 Christmas carols, Radio Shack, $14.99; ""Santa's Marching Band"" with four-inch lights in figurine shapes playing a medley of 35 holiday tunes, Sears, $79. Figures and Structures: These are molded porcelain or plastic pieces in the shapes of holiday figures like Mrs. Santa or Mr. Elf, some with moving limbs, or a Victorian house, a church or a candy store. They are normally 6 inches to 3 feet high. Caldor, for example, has moving figurines at $40 to $80 and porcelain lighted houses at $10 to $15. Candles: Offered in brass, ceramic and plastic these mimic real candles. They are available with batteries or plug-in cords, and stand 6 to 9 inches high. Best buys are four in a box, about $4, rather than singles, $1.50. (Sources: Radio Shack, Sears and Caldor discount department stores)",1991-11-23T05:00:00+0000

Sole e Luna, which calls itself a ristorante Toscano, sets the tone with a whimsically decorated oven, visible through a large window as you enter. To spark one's appetite, a table of vegetable dishes (a tavola fredda or cold table) is at the entrance to the large dining room.

Donated at the Reichs' behest by Pfizer Inc., the building, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, will house an elementary school aimed at giving a head start to the area's poorer children, many from families of Hispanic immigrants. Pfizer will also give $500,000 in renovation and start-up costs; the Reichs will come up with the rest.

The act of dipping a small, sweet cake in a cup of herb tea elicited volumes of prose from Proust; the smell of pickling beets coming from a Nebraska kitchen released a powerful longing in the American novelist and photographer Wright Morris, which he spent years transforming into images and words. Mr. Morris has attempted before, not always successfully, to use his photographs to complement his writing, as another way of evoking the rural life he remembers from his Nebraska boyhood. In editing PHOTOGRAPHS & WORDS (Friends of Photography, $32.50), James Alinder, a photographer and a frequent collaborator with Mr. Morris, has reproduced the photographs in rich black-and-white tones, thereby revealing strengths that earlier publications obscured through cropping and mediocre printing. Mr. Morris briefly recounts his years as a photographer and describes a momentous visit to his aunt and uncle's Nebraska farm in the 1940's. Awakened by his ""beet-pickled emotions,"" Mr. Morris dedicated himself to ""a pact with the bygone"" and to recording the symbols of a passing way of life. Of the images included here, only the first portrays a living person -- his uncle, shown from the back as he wheels his tools into the barn. Mr. Morris searches for human presence in weathered farm buildings, bureau tops and barber chairs. Some of the images show farmhouse interiors with old photographs of family members. Mr. Morris's yearning for a past impossible to recover, and his good eye for revealing detail, are what animate these photos and make them compelling.",1991-11-24T05:00:00+0000

The teams are tied in first place of the overall National Hockey League standings with 36 points, although the Canadiens have played three more games. The Capitals took a 2-1 lead at 7 minutes 8 seconds of the second period on a goal that had to be confirmed by instant replay. Al Iafrate skated past J. J. Daigneault and took a close-in shot that bounced off goaltender Patrick Roy. Iafrate's momentum took him into Roy, who was left defenseless as Kelly Miller stuffed in the rebound. Todd Krygier scored with 56 seconds left to wrap up the victory. (AP) Whalers 7, Flyers 3: Andrew Cassels scored his first two goals of the season and Pat Verbeek added two more as Hartford defeated the slumping Flyers in Philadelphia. Hartford, which defeated Philadelphia in all three meetings last season, helped keep the Flyers without a victory in their last four games (0-3-1). Hartford took a 1-0 lead just 31 seconds into the game when Verbeek got his sixth goal of the season. Kjell Samuelsson tied the game for the Flyers at 7:24 on a point drive that eluded Hartford goaltender Kay Whitmore. Cassels stuffed the goal past Ron Hextall at 15:36 for his first goal of the season to make it 2-1 Hartford. Rob Brown's 10th goal, midway through the second period, increased Hartford's lead to 3-1. The Flyers cut the lead to 3-2 at 17:25 of the second as Rod Brind'Amour scored. Goals early in the third period by Cassels and Mikael Anderson put the game away. (AP) Nordiques 4, Sabres 4: Greg Paslawski scored his second goal late in the third period to give Quebec the tie at Buffalo. The Sabres overcame a 3-1 second-period deficit by getting goals from Donald Audette, Tony Tanti and Dave Andreychuk to take a 4-3 lead. Paslawski tied it at 15:05 when he dug the puck out from behind the Buffalo net and scooped a backhander past Sabre goaltender Tom Draper.

It was the 11th consecutive year Mount St. Michael (7-3) had defeated Hayes (4-6) on Thanksgiving Day. The Mountaineers hold a 24-17-5 series advantage over the Cardinals. Hayes kept it interesting in the first half and allowed only one touchdown, on a 26-yard run by Nate Adams (5 rushes for 67 yards in the game). But Mount St. Michael opened the second half with a 71-yard three-play drive that was capped with a 27-yard option run by Knight. Mount St. Michael didn't score again until the first play of the fourth quarter, when Chris Mayo (11 carries for 79 yards) walked it in from 1-yard out. Midway through the fourth quarter, Mount St. Michael recovered a Hayes fumble to set up a 21-yard scoring strike from Knight to Carl Shaw. Shaw found the end zone again (45-yard run) after Hayes muffed a punt to complete the rout. Xavier 24, Fordham Prep 13: Ken Ritter (18 carries for 93 yards) ran for two touchdowns and Thomas Lee (17 carries for 84 yards) and Alan Booth (7 carries for 24 yards) each scored a touchdown to help Xavier (4-6) slip past Fordham Prep (5-5-1). The game marked the 65th consecutive year the two teams had met on Thanksgiving. Their rivalrly is the oldest in the city, dating to 1905. Iona Prep 40, New Rochelle 21: Phil Sapione (16 carries for 63 yards) rushed for three touchdowns and Brian Cummings (8 of 12 for 161 yards) threw one and ran for another to help power Iona Prep (5-4) past New Rochelle (3-5-1). Iona scored on four of its first five possessions and led, 27-0, at halftime. New Rochelle got on the scoreboard at the start of the third quarter when Ricky Sullins ran the ball in from 4 yards out. But on Iona's next possession, Cummings scored on a 13-yard run. New Rochelle countered with a William Whitfield touchdown. But Peter Gerosa put the game away when he recovered a fumble and ran in for a score. Midwood 34, John Jay 0: Tremain Darby (3 carries for 132 yards) scored on a 67-yard double reverse and rushed 17 yards for another as Midwood (5-5-1) trounced John Jay (4-3-1). Eddy Zeva kicked two field goals, including a 46-yarder and converted 4 extra points. COLLEGE FOOTBALL Texas A&M Wins Texas A&M's Kevin Smith returned a punt 73 yards to break open a fierce defensive duel and lead the Aggies to a 31-14 victory over Texas last night in College Station, Tex. The Aggies (10-1, 8-0 Southwest Conference) will play Florida State in Cotton Bowl on New Year's Day. Texas A&M's defense, ranked first in the nation, held Texas (5-6, 4-4) in check. With the Aggies leading by 17-7, Smith gave the Aggies breathing room with 5 minutes 59 seconds left in the third period when he fielded a punt, made a move to his right and darted 73 yards for the touchdown.
