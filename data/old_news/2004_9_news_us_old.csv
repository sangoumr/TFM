Best Buy, a 750-store electronics and entertainment products chain based in Minneapolis, said its radio identification system would use E.P.C. standards, a form of the technology that Wal-Mart and the Department of Defense have already specified for suppliers. The company said it planned tests in stores and distribution centers before the introduction. Best Buy indicated that its short-term goals were to speed products through its supply chain and reduce instances of products that customers want being out of stock. But the company said it was also interested in the technology's potential to help with tasks like processing warranty claims and returns, which would require leaving the radio tags on products when they are sold. That use of the technology is strongly opposed by consumer privacy advocates. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)",2004-09-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: U.S. Appeals In Broadband Cable Case,"The federal government is appealing a crucial appellate court decision over regulation of cable broadband services. The decision to appeal before the United States Supreme Court is good news for the cable industry, upset by a ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that cable modem services should be regulated more like telecommunications services, which are heavily regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. The solicitor general's office filed the appeal Friday night, ahead of a Monday deadline applicable to this case. Although the cable industry had already planned its appeal, industry officials hope the government's involvement will increase the chance of Supreme Court intervention. The Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, ruled last October that F.C.C. regulation of broadband cable services as unregulated ""information services"" was incorrect. The decision came from a lawsuit by a small Internet service provider, filed after the F.C.C. developed rules that lightly regulated cable broadband. Although the cable industry has been nervous about the Ninth Circuit decision, the court ruling does not necessarily force the F.C.C. to change the way it treats cable broadband services. Still, the industry believes that the appeals ruling could make it easier for the F.C.C. to change its mind in the future. Telephone-line-based Internet service providers, like EarthLink Inc., have pressed to have cable broadband services regulated like telecommunications services. One outcome could be regulations requiring cable companies to let other service providers sell Internet access over their cable lines. The underlying lawsuit was filed in 2002 by Brand X Internet Services, a small company based in Santa Monica, Calif.",2004-09-01T05:00:00+0000

David also spent many years on the Board of Directors of the UJA-Federation serving as the President from 1989 to 1992.

The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute and Society mourn the sudden and untimely deaths of our esteemed graduate, Leopold Caligor, Ph.D. and our distinguished colleague, Judith Caligor, Ph.D. Dr. Leopold Caligor became a faculty member at White in 1959 and had sustained the Institute with his acumen, creativity and limitless vigor for 45 years. He wrote numerous papers and co-authored the book, ""Dreams and Symbols"" with Rollo May and ""Clinical Prospectives on the Supervision of Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy"" with Philip Bromberg and James Meltzer. Lee was currently Director of Psychoanalytic Curriculum to which he made the kinds of penetrating and innovative contributions that made him a much sought-after psychoanalyst, supervisor and teacher. He shared his knowledge with abundant generosity, and his profound warmth was always in evidence. Lee's robust investment in his areas of expertise was contagious and students were always eager for the courses on dreams that he taught at White and elsewhere. A pioneer in the field, Leopold Caligor co-founded and co-directed the Institute's Union Therapy Project 40 years ago, and participated significantly in the creation of the Tel Aviv University's program in psychoanalysis. Lee also directed his energies to founding the APA's Division of Psychoanalysis in which he continued to participate in essential roles. In the course of his long and devoted tenure at the Institute he touched the lives of many. He was an inspired and inspiring mentor for younger colleagues. He could be demanding but he always showed kindness and concern. He looked for excellence but was patient with process. He was an alive, keenly sensitive presence at meetings where one could count on his giving, sooner or later, a well reasoned but passionate comment. He was one to take a stand and didn't like to equivocate. With all his being he showed us that he loved the Institute. We shall miss him sorely.

Mr. Jenkins, 64, who has met with American officials since arriving in Japan in July and receiving medical treatment, is expected to make a plea bargain that could allow him to avoid imprisonment. An agreement would allow both American and Japanese officials to resolve a diplomatic problem while tending to domestic opinion. In the past, American officials said they planned to court martial him. But because Mr. Jenkins married a Japanese woman who had been kidnapped by North Koreans and who was then allowed to return to Japan in 2002, the case is a highly emotional one in Japan.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, reinstated the suit yesterday; it had been dismissed three times by a trial court judge. The suit claims Oracle, based in Redwood City, Calif., created fake sales to hide a decline in demand related to the slowing economy and defects in a new product. A 1995 law intended to curb frivolous securities fraud claims imposes strict limits for such lawsuits to survive a company's motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs must prove strong indications of intentional misconduct or willful recklessness to make it to trial.

But they said the fraud alleged was not the type they would expect a cheating government to employ.

You might better see that insurance policy as akin to any asset a person sells to raise cash: a car, a savings bond, a record collection.

Critics reviewing the opening last October were glad of his omnipresence, applauding his Broadway debut as the flamboyant performer and songwriter Peter Allen, while panning almost everything else about the show, especially its schematic and sometimes cringe-inducing book. But Mr. Jackman's charm made the production (which improved with time) a hit anyway; when it closes next Sunday, after 32 previews and 365 regular performances, it will have recouped its initial investment of $8.25 million on gross ticket sales of more than $42 million. Astonishingly, when Mr. Jackman sat down for a conversation a few weeks before closing, he had not missed even one of those performances, a feat that gave him, he said, a masochistic thrill but had also taken its toll.

In both casesthe turn inward accompanied a great social revolution: the rise ofcapitalism in the first, and its transformation into an engine ofmass consumption in the second. In both cases, too, the results wereironic. Calvinism urged people to look inside themselves todetermine whether they had been saved, but it wound up contributingto a new discipline of work, savings, and family life. Freudianintrospection aimed to foster the individual's capacity to live anauthentically personal life, yet it wound up helping to consolidateconsumer society. In both cases, finally, the turn towardself-examination generated a new language. In the case of Calvinism,the language centered on the Protestant idea of the soul, an ideathat helped shape such later concepts as character, integrity, andautonomy.

Most of the treasures, many of which were taken to the Soviet Union during the war but returned to East Germany at the end of the 1950's, had been in storage for decades, with only a few pieces on display at the city's Albertinum Museum. The Green Vault, established by the Saxon ruler August the Strong (1670-1733) and originally opened in 1729, was refurbished by the state of Saxony for $30 million.

The firm, Hay, Kalb & Associates, opened an office in Pyongyang on Aug. 15, said Michael Hay, who owns the firm with a North Korean partner. The firm has a dozen lawyers and plans to focus on foreign companies seeking opportunities in North Korea. The establishment of a partly foreign-owned firm in North Korea is an instance in which the Communist government is more open than its capitalist neighbor to the south.

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers filed a motion last month asking that a trustee be named. Among other matters, United's unions are upset at the company's warning that it is likely to terminate their pension plans and replace them with less-generous retirement programs. Judge Eugene R.

us,Crash of a Robotic Space Probe,"We've heard so much about the difficulty of conducting operations in the unforgiving environment of space that it was disheartening to see a space mission come to grief because parachutes failed to deploy in Earth's own atmosphere. After gathering solar wind particles for more than two years in an area far beyond the Moon, NASA's Genesis spacecraft headed toward home, where it released a scientific capsule that crashed into the ground at high speed yesterday, possibly obliterating most of the material so painstakingly gathered. The only solace was that this was a relatively cheap automated mission, so no lives were lost and the budgetary impact will be slight. The accident was a reminder that robotic missions can fail just as readily as missions with astronauts, but with less catastrophic results.",2004-09-09T05:00:00+0000

William Armstrong never went to the scene of the 2002 hit-and-run crash in Sagaponack that killed a pedestrian, Henry A. Yarrell, 38. The woman, Leslie Jennemann, had been out dancing and drinking before the accident and was convicted in May of second-degree manslaughter and leaving the scene. She is serving a sentence of two to six years at a prison in Albion. No charges have been filed against Lieutenant Armstrong, but a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney, Thomas J.

us,Technology Briefing | Deals: Qualcomm To Acquire Iridigm,"Qualcomm, the world's second-largest maker of chips that power mobile telephones, will buy the Iridigm Display Corporation for $170 million to acquire its patented technology for cellphone screens. The price covers the 86 percent of Iridigm that Qualcomm does not already own, the company said yesterday. Iridigm's so-called iMod technology is cheaper to make and uses less battery power than existing liquid crystal-display, or L.C.D., screens, said Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego. The technology allows manufacturers to make lower-priced phones with more features like color screens that display pictures and video. Demand for cellphones with color screens and features like cameras lifted global shipments 37 percent, to $163.7 million during the second quarter, the research company IDC said. Qualcomm makes wireless-phone chips and sell licenses for the use of its patented code-division multiple-access, or C.D.M.A., technology for transmitting phone calls.

Yesterday, the government food panel effectively said that there was no reason to require the testing of younger cows when it announced it has concluded that such tests could not detect the disease in animals younger than 20 months.

Supporters called the law long overdue recognition for valid African medical practices like herbal cures, dismissed by outsiders as quackery. Critics said the healers' reliance on consultation with spirits and other nonscientific practices makes licensing a fraud.

The government said its consumer price index, the central bank's main gauge in setting interest rates, rose 0.69 percent last month, slightly more than what most economists had expected but down sharply from a 0.91 percent increase in July. The reading brought the accumulated inflation rate this year to 5.14 percent, just short of the government's year-end target of 5.5 percent. Todd Benson (NYT)",2004-09-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"MY NEW GUN (Columbia Tri-Star, Sept. 28)","When Stacy Cochran's drier-than-vermouth suburban comedy ""My New Gun"" appeared in 1992, it seemed to augur a bright future for the then-nascent idea of independent filmmaking. In the 12 years since, legions of directors have spun out small movies laced with quirks (quirks having become easy substitutes for originality, brains and craftsmanship). But few indie movies of the recent past have the disarmingly gentle spark, or the understated wit, of ""My New Gun."" Diane Lane plays Debbie, a New Jersey housewife who's not actually bored -- that would be too boring. Rather, she makes the best of the orderly life she shares with her passive-aggressively attentive doctor husband, Gerald (Stephen Collins). On a whim Gerald buys her a gun, despite (or maybe because of) her protestations. Her neighbor, the protective, mysterious, soft-spoken Skippy (James LeGros), spirits the gun out of the house for reasons Debbie doesn't immediately understand. The nuttier their situation gets, the more the tacit sympathy between them grows: their dialogue is like Dada poetry, with extra beats to take the place of the things they don't dare say. Unlike so many comedies set in the suburbs, ""My New Gun"" -- its serviceably lavish houses and roadside restaurants lovingly shot by Ed Lachman -- is fueled by optimism and a sense of adventure. Ms. Cochran's movie, never the indie hit it should have been and at last available on DVD, suggests that the suburbs aren't nearly as stupid and lifeless as the movies usually make them out to be. People don't make the suburbs boring -- filmmakers do. STEPHANIE ZACHAREK",2004-09-12T05:00:00+0000

As Martha, the hostess from hell and self-described earth mother, she (presumably) keeps her clothes on. But she has far more opportunity to get naked emotionally. Bill Irwin, the great physical comedian who showed an unexpected affinity for Albee angst when he appeared in ""The Goat,"" is George, Martha's husband, accomplice and sparring partner. David Harbour and Mireille Enos are the young and dewy guests who get gotten.

Ms. Paltrow is fiercely believable and intellectually radiant in this story of Plath's troubled marriage to the British poet Ted Hughes (Daniel Craig). Ted is awfully enlightened for a 1950's husband. When Sylvia deals with writer's block by baking cakes and pies, he tells her: ""You've got to write. That's what poets do."" Unfortunately he's the more successful of the two, which brings female admirers in droves. Sylvia becomes convinced that he's having an affair, and she's not imagining it.

us,"Japan Torqued, Melted, Reconfigured","KNOWN best in the United States for his image of a beer bottle twisted into an ungodly carcass by the atomic blast at Nagasaki, Shomei Tomatsu is one of Japan's most influential postwar photographers. In the series from which that photograph comes, ""11:02 Nagasaki"" (named for the exact time the bomb hit), and in other series, including ""Home,"" ""Chewing Gum and Chocolate"" and ""Oh Shinjuku!,"" Mr. Tomatsu has captured the fragmentation of Japanese urban life. He sometimes crops his photographs in abstract ways or prints them in high contrast. It is hard to find a boring Tomatsu photograph. But it is also often hard to tell what precisely is going on in his pictures. His kind of expressionistic documentary style, novel in Japan in the early 1960's, provoked a debate in the nation's photographic community. In the pages of the journal Asahi Camera, the photojournalist Natori Yonosuke inveighed against the young generation of photographers for discarding storytelling and ""reality"" in favor of expression and ""image."" Mr. Tomatsu (born in 1930) defended himself and his peers, arguing that expressiveness in no way precluded a ""respect for a specific reality."" And by the mid-1960's Mr. Tomatsu, along with Daido Moriyama, Eikoh Hosoe and Masahisa Fukase, had defined a new kind of photography in Japan. Whether it's a picture of a prostitute glowering at the camera and blowing what look like rays of smoke out her nose (""Aprs Guerre, Prostitute, Nagoya""), a shot of a single figure hurled through blurred space (""Protest, Tokyo"") or an image of a screaming long-haired youth (""Underground City, Coca-Cola, Tokyo""), Mr. Tomatsu's work deals with the clashes between Japanese tradition and Western modernity. ""Shomei Tomatsu: Skin of the Nation,"" an exhibition of 260 photographs at the Japan Society in New York (Sept. 22-Jan. 2), organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in association with the Japan Society, will present several works from each of his major series made during the last five decades.

The poem explains that the fall occurs because the nation is no longer mighty, ""its cities are empty, its population dispersed / . . . its mission forgotten, its language lost."" Yet it is the death of this man that is like the fall of a mighty nation, but a nation full and undispersed, its mission honored and its language imperishable. The magnitude of Czeslaw Milosz, who died in Krakow on Aug. 14 at the age of 93, is almost unimaginable. He was a hero of the history of his time and a hero of the literature of his time. For friends and for strangers, for lovers of liberty and for lovers of beauty, he was, for more than half a century, an indispensable man. Milosz discharged his obligations to his age and his obligations to his soul with the same diligence and the same depth. The stability of his mind, its preternatural composure, was one of the great sanctuaries of the 20th century, a prophecy of the eventual emancipation. He had the rare gift of knowing how to be at once troubled and unperturbed. When light was needed, he was light; when stone was needed, he was stone. Milosz's spiritual intensity never interfered with his historical clarity. His inner freedom seems never to have failed him. His life and his work justified, in all their complexities, the most elementary belief in the power of the truth. He had the face of a hawk and the heart of a dove. He was as tough as time, or almost.",2004-09-12T05:00:00+0000

Frightened and saddened at first, the women eventually warm to their captors and happily wed them -- this is Stockholm Syndrome in Cinemascope. While those with overly delicate feminist sensibilities may find the sexual politics of ""Seven Brides"" too horrifying to contemplate, the rest of us will want to play the barn-raising sequence -- choreographed by Michael Kidd, it is one of the most rousing dance numbers ever put on screen -- over and over again. In a commemorative featurette included here, we learn that one of the musical numbers, in which the mountain brothers lament how tired they are of ""sleeping with sheep,"" alarmed the censors at the time. The line stayed in the song, but no sheep, fleece-clad or otherwise, were allowed to appear in the scene. Our lamblike innocence thus protected, we're that much freer to enjoy the sultry vision of Julie Newmeyer (later known as Julie Newmar, TV's Catwoman), in a wasp-waisted white corset and bloomers, lasciviously lounging on one of the brothers' vacated beds, wondering which one of them slept in it.

But don't be quick to turn your back on this sharp-witted biographical study of shadowy personalities in the glare of public life, inspired by the career of the former West German chancellor Willy Brandt. Presented to deserved critical acclaim in London, Mr. Frayn's latest work does for politics what his ""Copenhagen"" did for physics, transforming the stuff of textbooks into scintillating, thought-churning theater. It's hard to imagine the American cast being better than that of the National Theater and West End productions, led by Roger Allam as a charismatic, Clintonesque Brandt and Conleth Hill as his double-dealing assistant Gnter Guillaume, who was an East German mole. But there is definite promise in the casting of James Naughton (as the chancellor) and Richard Thomas (in Mr. Hill's role).

Mr. Berlanti sat again and asked one of the writers how her effort to quit smoking was going.

His works appeal to the learned and the unlettered, to urban sophisticates and provincial first-time theatergoers. He makes his audiences laugh and cry; he turns politics into poetry; he recklessly mingles vulgar clowning and philosophical subtlety. He grasps with equal penetration the intimate lives of kings and of beggars; he seems at one moment to have studied law, at another theology, at another ancient history, while at the same time he effortlessly mimics the accents of country bumpkins and takes delight in old wives' tales. Virtually all his rivals in the highly competitive theater business found themselves on the straight road to starvation; this one playwright by contrast made enough money to buy one of the best houses in the hometown to which he retired when he was around 50, the self-made protagonist of an amazing success story that has resisted explanation for 400 years.",2004-09-12T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Schumer said the cost of preventing contaminated water from running off highways and lawns and into water supplies has far outstripped federal estimates. Complying with the regulations on Long Island had been estimated at $9.6 million, but Mr. Schumer said that just six cities and towns on Long Island had already spent $9.9 million.

In a suit filed in August 2001, Ms. Jones claimed that Mr. Hirschfeld still owed her $1 million he promised to give her three years earlier if she would drop her sexual harassment suit against President Clinton. But Judge Peter K.

Judge Leisure threw out Ms. Jones's suit, but Mr. Hirschfeld, 84, did not go unpenalized.

The series, which began in June, has been one of this summer's top-selling comic books. The events in ""Identity Crisis"" stem from the rape of a hero's wife and the Justice League's questionable retaliation.

us,World Briefing | Americas: Canada: Court Grants Same-Sex Divorce,"Two Ontario women were granted Canada's first same-sex divorce after a provincial court judge ruled that the traditional definition of spouse in the country's Divorce Act is unconstitutional. Same-sex marriage is legal in four Canadian jurisdictions -- Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and the Yukon -- but the federal divorce law still considers marriage as only between a man and a woman. The federal government, which has referred the issue of same-sex marriage to the Supreme Court to rule on its constitutionality before introducing legislation in Parliament to legalize it across the country, did not challenge the divorce decision and conceded that the definition of spouse in the Divorce Act violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. There are about 3,000 married same-sex couples in Canada, but until the federal divorce law is amended, the decision relates only to Ontario, the most populous province. The identities of the women, who had been together for nearly 10 years but separated after five days of marriage in June 2003, were kept secret. Colin Campbell (NYT)",2004-09-15T05:00:00+0000

Judge Paul H. Alvarado of California Superior Court in San Francisco told Microsoft in an order last week to pay the lawyers $112.5 million. The award is about $35 million more than what Microsoft suggested in court filings. The California suit, filed in 2000, accused Microsoft of overcharging for PC software by maintaining a monopoly over its Windows operating system. The case was settled last year. Microsoft has settled similar suits in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Consumer suits are still pending in Iowa, Nebraska, New York and Wisconsin. ""We think the judge did a very thoughtful job, carefully and properly applying California law, and the class counsel received a fair award,"" a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Desler, said. The award includes $101 million in fees and $11.5 million in expenses to be shared among lawyers at 31 law firms, including Townsend & Townsend & Crew, based in San Francisco. Under the antitrust settlement, California purchasers of Microsoft products will receive vouchers ranging from $5 to $29 that can be used to buy any manufacturer's personal-computer hardware or software. Two-thirds of the unclaimed vouchers will go to California schools in low-income areas. Judge Alvarado wrote that the lawyers in the case derived many of their claims from previous antitrust cases against Microsoft.",2004-09-16T05:00:00+0000

Case,"A Time magazine reporter, Matthew Cooper, was subpoenaed Tuesday for a second time in an inquiry into the disclosure of the identity of Valerie Plame, a covert C.I.A. officer. After Mr. Cooper was ordered jailed last month for failing to name his sources, he gave testimony limited to his contacts with I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, and the court withdrew its order. Time said Mr. Cooper testified with Mr. Libby's consent. The new subpoena apparently concerns information from other officials. Yesterday a Washington Post reporter, Walter Pincus, also testified. Mr. Pincus said he would not identify an official who discussed Ms. Plame's identity with him in July 2003, but agreed to recount the substance of his conversation with the official.

But that was the assessment of Oprah Winfrey yesterday when she named Buck's 1931 novel ""The Good Earth"" as the next selection for Oprah's Book Club. Set in rural China in the early 1900's during the reign of the last emperor, the novel tells the story of Wang Lung, a farmer, and his wife. ""It's a sweeping saga that's been called 'a universal tale of the destiny of man,""' Ms. Winfrey said in a news release yesterday announcing the selection. A best seller, the novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. In 1938, Buck became the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Simon & Schuster's Washington Square Press has printed 750,000 copies of a new trade paperback version of the book featuring the Oprah's Book Club label. Since Ms. Winfrey restarted her book club in June 2003, after a hiatus of about a year, she has featured only classic novels, sending several of them onto the best-seller lists, including this summer's pick, ""Anna Karenina.""

Union officials said that Premier had rejected 1199's call for a wage increase to $10 an hour, and that Premier's workers average less than $7 an hour. The company says its workers average $7.60 an hour. After a three-day strike in June, the union persuaded several home care agencies to agree to pay $10 by 2007, but Premier's lawyer, Thomas Greble, said the company's reimbursement rate was so low that it could not possibly afford such a large increase.

English sailors first noticed its banks of red clay in 1609; it was settled in the late 17th century and developed into a bustling port rom which seafood and crops were sent to New York City. In the 1980's, its commercial district suffered an economic downturn that earned it the unfortunate moniker ""Dead Bank."" Today, with help from a downtown business alliance, the town has changed again. Red Bank supports a growing array of trendy shops and restaurants, and has fashioned itself into a mini-center for the arts, with famous neighbors including Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi in nearby towns. And while summer brings outdoor festivals, concerts and movies to the town's streets and public riverfront areas -- Riverside Gardens Park and Marine Park -- the crowds disperse during autumn, making the view of boats cruising the Navesink much easier to enjoy.

us,Shadow Play,"Who is that guy, half there, half not, scissored out of the photographs? Actually, make that slashed. In reality, he is an actor hired to play the part of a sugar daddy in these pictures that Nikki S. Lee staged of herself dressed in offerings from the fall couture. Teasing reality, and the notoriously unstable tales we tend to weave around it, is one of the tactics that Lee has used to keep the art world ensorcelled since her arrival half a decade ago. * The critical boilerplate on the 33-year-old artist is that her work is about the politics of identity; she is that outsider who experimentally drifts into other people's lives and slips on their skins. Lee most successfully performed this serial imposture in Projects, a series of photographs that involved meticulously changing her hair, her weight, her clothes and even her skin color to infiltrate a variety of what people tend to call subcultures. Once transformed, she would then have a friend snap her photograph. * Certain immutable elements of Lee's own reality affected her masquerade, foremost among them physiognomy and race. Lee is from South Korea, born in 1970 and raised in Seoul. She did graduate work in the United States, at N.Y.U. and at the Fashion Institute of Technology, where she studied fashion photography and no doubt learned some of the tricks she came to use in her accomplished impersonations. ""I really enjoy fashion shows as a performative activity,"" Lee said recently. ""To me, it's like people showing art in a gallery, only the sculpture moves."" * Whether passing for a stereotypical skate rat or an exotic dancer or a trailer-park resident in rural Ohio, Lee can rely on the viewer to bring his own stereotypes to her work. What's wrong with this picture? you find yourself asking, regardless of how politically loaded the question may be. How did that pretty young Asian woman in a tube top end up sitting alongside a grizzled Jethro Bodine type with a Confederate flag on the wall behind him and a shotgun across his lap? * ""I like boundaries,"" Lee said. ""People know it's fake, but they don't. I like it that they get kind of confused."" * You might imagine that there was not much left untried by an artist seeking to flout the assumptions built into a gaze. You would be wrong. In making her Projects series, Lee not only found novel ways to cultivate the terrain but while doing so she was also able to slip into yet another persona -- that of an art-world star whose work justifiably bears comparison to that of other shape-shifters, people like Cindy Sherman, Lucas Samaras, Charles Ray. * Projects put Nikki S. Lee (the S is for Seung Hee, her given name) on the art-world map; it certainly guaranteed her speed-dial status on the cellphones of all international curators organizing shows around themes of identity and race. After a while, though, Projects began to trouble the artist, who worried that she might end up a stereotype of an artist who made commentary on stereotypes. * ""Photography in the 90's was very theatrical in a way, very stagy, very set up and very dry,"" she said. ""I felt like I wanted to go back to the essence of the snapshot, the reason why people take pictures in the first place, to document themselves, their families, something real and sentimental in their lives."" * So a while back, Lee began work on a new series, this one called Parts. In Parts, Lee simplifies the narrative and narrows the focus to a woman and a man, or a woman and a hand, anyway. The unidentified male limb that shares each frame with Lee in these latest pictures is the truncated symbol of a relationship that remains unexplained. The idea, she said, is to leave the viewer guessing about the identity of the mysterious man at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, wondering what his relationship is to her. * Naturally, it is a fiction, but then so is the haute couture. Plenty of people are aware by now that the couture is little more than a rarefied form of performance art whose symbolic content is intended to fuel mass-market consumption (in the form of perfumes and accessories) but whose basic product is created for a clientele that probably numbers 500 people worldwide. This particular performance is pitched to a sentimental fantasy nurtured by many of us, that to forge a relationship, however attenuated, with luxury products is somehow to dally with a class above our own. * ""At first, when I tried on the clothes, I almost died because they were so formal, so tight and so expensive,"" Lee said. ""I thought to myself, Who is going to wear this? But then I figured out that it didn't really matter if the clothes were ever worn. The collector buys the clothes and maybe just keeps them. What really matters to them is being the one who owns the dress.""",2004-09-19T05:00:00+0000

The Samurai Shopper is firmly in favor of civilization and raises her glass to it each and every sunset, with reverence, hosannas and an occasional filthy limerick. So when a Manhattan store called PJ Wine announced its 2004 Spanish Wine Festival at a church on Central Park West, I was jazzed. All samurai live by a code of self-discipline and austerity, but a fine wine is the gateway to nirvana. And if it isn't, it ought to be.",2004-09-19T05:00:00+0000

They're put in prisonlike uniforms and sentenced, sometimes for life, to work long hours in hot laundries without speaking and forced to strip naked and stand in line while the nuns ridicule their breasts and genitals. Ridiculous but true. The last of these institutions were shut down in 1996, and Peter Mullan's grim, eye-opening drama about them is well worth taping or staying up late for.

He had just celebrated his 92nd birthday. He was born on the plains in Lakin, Kansas and lived there through the Dust Bowl and the Depression. After graduating from Kansas State University in 1934 with high honors, he began graduate studies at Harvard which led to a Master's Degree in Agricultural Economics before WWII intervened. He served in Washington in the Office of Price Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers during the War, eventually joining the Reserves as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1946. His business career began with Harry Ferguson Inc., the farm equipment manufacturer, in Detroit in 1946. After the company merged with Massey Harris in 1953, he advanced to the President of the combined entity in 1956. He became Chief Executive Officer in 1966 and served in that role until his retirement in 1978. He presided over Massey's global expansion in the 60's and 70's. During much of this period he and his family resided in Toronto, Canada. However, he considered Boca Raton his home for the last 40 years. During his career and his retirement he served as a director and trustee of numerous boards including the University of Guelph, Lynn University, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Farm Equipment Institute and the Royal Palm Yacht and Country Club. Mr. Thornbrough, devoted husband for 61 years to Virginia Thornbrough, is survived by his three children: Susan Thornbrough Staiger and Jon Staiger; Wayne Thornbrough and his wife Barbara; Grant Thornbrough and his wife Diana. In addition, he leaves six adult grandchildren and one new great-grandchild. He also leaves behind his beloved Marlene Fay whose companionship enriched his later years.

At issue is whether the move, which would probably involve building a new gallery on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway near the Philadelphia Museum of Art, would constitute the ""least drastic deviation"" from the 1922 trust indenture of Albert C. Barnes. To finance the move, three foundations -- the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Lenfest Foundation and the Annenberg Foundation -- have promised to help raise $150 million, including $50 million for an endowment. But three students at the Barnes Foundation, which was set up as an educational institution, are asking Montgomery County Orphans' Court Judge Stanley R. Ott to keep the gallery in Merion, even if means selling off thousands of artworks in storage or a Chester County property also owned by the Barnes. In a January decision, Judge Ott asked the Barnes trustees to provide estimates of how much money could be raised by selling nongallery assets, as well as a feasibility study on the move and the future costs of operating a Merion administration building, downtown gallery and the Chester County property. ""The bottom line is that you can't raise $50 million by selling these things,"" said Ralph G. Wellington of Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis, which is representing the foundation.

The Cleveland Orchestra and Chicago Symphony are also negotiating without contracts in place. In a joint statement issued late Sunday night, the parties in Philadelphia promised to impose a news media blackout, which would be a sharp contrast to weeks of bitter jousting in newspapers and on rival Web sites. The musicians voted on Saturday to authorize a strike after their negotiating committee walked out of talks, calling management's latest offer on pensions insulting. But the talks were rekindled around midday Sunday, with the help of a federal mediator. Management is seeking to reduce labor costs to cover a $1.8 million budget shortfall and has proposed eliminating several full time positions, reducing pension expenses and limiting salary increases.

Because the station is a major junction, train service was snarled for much of the day.

Is Overcharging For Airwaves,"Nextel Communications said yesterday that federal regulators were asking it to pay $452 million more than it should for airwaves that the wireless carrier would receive in a $4.86 billion transaction with the government. The Federal Communications Commission underestimated the value of radio frequencies the company plans to trade, Nextel said in an F.C.C. filing. The company, based in Reston, Va., said the frequencies, used by cellphones, are worth $2.06 billion. The F.C.C. set their value at $1.61 billion. Nextel's chief executive, Timothy M. Donahue, met with F.C.C. officials in Washington this week to outline Nextel's objections to surrendering certain frequencies in exchange for a different set with greater capacity. The company contends that the government miscalculated the population in areas covered by the licenses, which is the basis for the valuation. Persuading the government to change the airwaves' value may reduce the $3.25 billion Nextel would be required to spend as part of the swap. In July, the F.C.C. awarded Nextel frequencies, valued at $4.86 billion, that the company sought to reduce interference with police and firefighters' radios. As part of the swap, Nextel will get new channels that allow it to expand in wireless Internet services. Shares of Nextel fell 74 cents, to $22.71.",2004-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Judge Stanley R. Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans' Court is to decide if the foundation should be allowed to make the move, which would violate the terms of the will of the art collector Albert C. Barnes. The foundation said that it would keep Barnes's ensemble of paintings and decorative objects intact as the collector specified. In an interview after testifying, the consultant, Harry M. Perks, a former Philadelphia streets commissioner, said, ""It would be pretty hard to replicate the gallery and art without replicating the building."" In fact, he said, ""it would be impossible to do it any other way."" Asked how it would fit within the proposed new home for the foundation, which was previously described as a 120,000- to-150,000-square-foot museum, Mr. Perks said, ""I have no idea how they would do this."" In other testimony yesterday, Matthew J. Schwenderman, a partner at Deloitte & Touche, hired by the Barnes to analyze the move financially, projected that the new museum would serve about 237,0000 visitors, not including school groups, in its first year, compared with 57,000 now.

The revision was disclosed in the minutes from the bank's monetary policy meeting last week, when it raised its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to 16.25 percent, the first rate increase in 19 months. The bank previously warned that more rate increases were on the horizon. But in the minutes released yesterday the bank said it hoped that the decision to pursue a higher inflation target in 2005 would give it the flexibility to raise interest rates only gradually.

Ed was of a generation of architects who were steeped in modernism at Harvard and inspired by Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. He is often first identified with the museums he designed-The Walker Art Center, the Sarah Scaife Gallery at Carnegie Mellon, the Dallas Museum of Art, and the Armand Hammer chief among them. He created beautiful, light-infused spaces in which architecture never upstages art, and through which visitors can flow easily. He also was one of the first modernist to bring a sensitivity to the local and the regional in his work, utilizing indigenous stone or wood to articulate his spare vocabulary. This tenet is perhaps most evident in his Haystack Mountain School of Arts and Crafts on Deer Isle, Maine. This country is filled with lasting monuments to Ed's genius, from huge projects like the IBM headquarters in New York, to private commissions done on a domestic scale. We especially extend our sympathies to his wife, Mary, who was our colleague in MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design in the 1940s, as well as to his son, his grandaughters, and the entire family.

Out along the Atlantic, there is plenty of sand between the beach towels even though the waters, warmed by the Gulf Stream, are still inviting. Over 250 years ago, a band of fortune seekers and opportunists braved the un-air-conditioned heat -- as well as the mosquitoes, alligators and bears along the banks of the Cape Fear River -- to create Wilmington, which in time became the northernmost hub of the Southern rice culture. Now it makes its living as a resort, a busy port and an aspiring movie capital. In 1983, Frank Capra Jr. found Wilmington a good place to shoot his film ""Firestarter,"" and now his Wilmington studio, EUE/Screen Gems, says it is the largest film production facility east of California.

The number of unemployed people searching for jobs in the six metropolitan areas surveyed rose to 2.5 million in August, from 2.4 million the previous month.

Ed was of a generation of architects who were steeped in modernism at Harvard and inspired by Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. He is often first identified with the museums he designed-The Walker Art Center, the Sarah Scaife Gallery at Carnegie Mellon, the Dallas Museum of Art, and the Armand Hammer chief among them. He created beautiful, light-infused spaces in which architecture never upstages art, and through which visitors can flow easily. He also was one of the first modernist to bring a sensitivity to the local and the regional in his work, utilizing indigenous stone or wood to articulate his spare vocabulary. This tenet is perhaps most evident in his Haystack Mountain School of Arts and Crafts on Deer Isle, Maine. This country is filled with lasting monuments to Ed's genius, from huge projects like the IBM headquarters in New York, to private commissions done on a domestic scale. We especially extend our sympathies to his wife, Mary, who was our colleague in MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design in the 1940s, as well as to his son, his grandaughters, and the entire family.

So far this year the government has run up a primary surplus, which excludes interest payments on debt, of 63.73 billion reais, putting it on track to meet fiscal targets in a $14 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund. Under the loan agreement, Brazil agreed to a year-end surplus of 75.1 billion reais, or 4.25 percent of gross domestic product. Earlier in the week, however, the government raised its surplus target for 2004 to 4.5 percent of gross domestic product, saying it intended to use a windfall in tax receipts to pay off more of its debt.

Ed was of a generation of architects who were steeped in modernism at Harvard and inspired by Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. He is often first identified with the museums he designed-The Walker Art Center, the Sarah Scaife Gallery at Carnegie Mellon, the Dallas Museum of Art, and the Armand Hammer chief among them. He created beautiful, light-infused spaces in which architecture never upstages art, and through which visitors can flow easily. He also was one of the first modernist to bring a sensitivity to the local and the regional in his work, utilizing indigenous stone or wood to articulate his spare vocabulary. This tenet is perhaps most evident in his Haystack Mountain School of Arts and Crafts on Deer Isle, Maine. This country is filled with lasting monuments to Ed's genius, from huge projects like the IBM headquarters in New York, to private commissions done on a domestic scale. We especially extend our sympathies to his wife, Mary, who was our colleague in MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design in the 1940s, as well as to his son, his grandaughters, and the entire family.

In his short time at the University, Gordie had been named to the club lacrosse team and had become a pledge at Chi Psi Fraternity. Gordie went to Colorado after three years at Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, MA where he excelled in athletics and drama. In his senior year he was co-captain of the varsity football team. He also started at defense on the school's New England championship lacrosse team. At graduation he received the Class of 2004 Award of Excellence in Drama. Gordie mentored younger students as a Proctor in an underclass dormitory. Prior to Deerfield, Gordie attended St. Marks School of Texas in Dallas where he developed his love for football and lacrosse. He especially enjoyed his time in Sun Valley, ID visiting his father where he loved to snowboard, fly fish, hike and play golf. He also vacationed frequently in Jamaica and was a huge fan of its Reggae music. Gordie taught himself to play the guitar, which had become a passion. The many people whose lives he touched remember Gordie for his intelligence, leadership, compassion, humor, happiness and an uplifting attitude towards everyone and everything he encountered. All who knew him felt his joy for life. His goal to be a positive role model was enabled by his gift of putting a smile on everyone's face. At Deerfield, Gordie and some friends started the ""Hug Club,"" just one of the many legendary ""Gordieisms."" Gordie cherished his special relationship with his closest friend, Lily. Gordie is survived by his extended family including his mother, Leslie Herrlinger Lanahan; father, Lynn Gordon Bailey; step-mother Claire Bailey; step-father, Michael Lanahan; sisters Bibb Bailey and Lily Lanahan; grandparents Marcia and Richard Rorick; Kim and Edward F.

He is also notorious for keeping people waiting: waiting for his films to go into production, waiting for the shooting day to begin and waiting for a recognizable story and structure to emerge from his long, uncertain process. This particular night, the crew was setting up to shoot scenes from Wong's eighth film, ""2046,"" an ambitious, star-studded, futuristic drama. (Its title refers to the 49th year after the 1997 British handover of Hong Kong.)

He had a double-digit lead in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Al Gore in 2000 and has no Republicans in statewide office. A new poll by Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., however, indicates that New Jersey is no longer a Democratic slam dunk. The survey, released last week, shows that Mr. Kerry and President Bush are neck and neck in the state. Both took 48 percent of those surveyed; Ralph Nader accounted for 2 percent. Among registered voters, Mr. Kerry had a small lead, 47 to 43 percent. The results square with other polls with similarly bad news for Mr. Kerry. A recent Star-Ledger/Eagleton Institute poll had Mr. Kerry ahead by just 4 points; he had been ahead by 20 points in August. ""What this suggests is that the Republicans may spend a little time stirring the pot in New Jersey, and the Democrats may have to play defense in a state where they didn't think they'd have to do that,"" said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. ""Does this mean that New Jersey all of a sudden is a battleground state? Most politicians would probably say no, but you never know. One thing is for sure: If Bush looks like he'll carry New Jersey, it's a signal that this thing is over."" Terry Golway",2004-09-26T05:00:00+0000

Borrowing a neighbor's camera, Jonathan, pouting and tossing his head back, filmed himself playing an abused woman: ""I wear too much makeup,"" she says to the camera. ""It makes me look like a whore."" At 13, Jonathan was hanging out at a gay club, disguising himself as a Goth girl, making friends with older boys who called themselves Spooky, Stacey and Bam Bam. He filmed them, too. Now, 20 years of videotaping later, he's edited his home movies into a bizarre, astonishing film called ""Tarnation.""",2004-09-26T05:00:00+0000

us,OPERA PASSIONS,"At La Scala in Milan, they are calling it artistic integrity. At Covent Garden in London, they say it has all the air of a prima donna's behavior. Riccardo Muti has pulled out of a Royal Opera production of ""La Forza del Destino,"" scheduled to open Oct. 16, in a disagreement over the set, spoiling his long-awaited return 20 years after last conducting at the house. The production is by La Scala and designed by Hugo de Ana. Several set walls taken to London were too heavy for the Covent Garden stage, so Covent Garden said it tried to win Mr. de Ana's approval for what it called minor changes. But he refused to agree, and Mr. Muti stepped aside in support, a Covent Garden spokesman, Christopher Millard, said Friday. The opera house's music director, Antonio Pappano, and its management said that they were ""totally perplexed"" by Mr. Muti's decision and that Mr. de Ana showed ""no spirit of collaboration."" La Scala, where Mr. Muti is music director, responded by saying the Covent Garden production is faithless to the original. The decision by Mr. Muti and Mr. de Ana to withdraw ""upholds the tradition of La Scala that any restaging correspond absolutely to the original production,"" La Scala said. Mr. Pappano will take over, canceling concerts with the Chicago Symphony, a recording project and a concert in Mr. Muti's city, with the Giuseppe Verdi Symphony Orchestra of Milan. DANIEL J.

The firefighters, including Michael Carter, a vice president of the Uniformed Firefighters' Association, joined a march that day to protest orders from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to cut back on police officers and firefighters searching for victims' remains in the ruins of the World Trade Center. All charges against people arrested at the protest were dropped a month later. Judge Richard J. Holwell ruled that the firefighters' arrests were not malicious because it was clear they were not authorized to march to the trade center site. Julia Preston (NYT)",2004-09-28T05:00:00+0000

Yesterday, figuring that it can lure away business travelers exasperated by trans-Atlantic round-trip fares of $6,000 and up for business class, Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, announced sharply reduced fares in both business class and economy. The fare structure has been simplified and the need eliminated for round-trip purchases and Saturday night stayovers to obtain the best fare. Fares in business class have been permanently cut by 50 percent or more, and those in economy reduced by 20 to 30 percent. ""The strategy is basically to say, the low-fare concept is coming to the Atlantic routes,"" Mr. Foley said yesterday. Some examples: Unrestricted nonstop one-way business-class fares between Los Angeles and Dublin are now $3,695, a 60 percent cut from previous fares. New York to Dublin is $1,504, a 43 percent reduction. Trans-Atlantic routes have long been plagued by high capacity and high fares.

Bloomberg waived that rule yesterday in anointing the latest addition to the Staten Island ferry fleet for a fellow Republican and a former borough president, Guy V. Molinari. ""When it came to naming this, it was a no-brainer,"" he said at a ceremony to accept delivery of the boat at the St. George Ferry Terminal on Staten Island. The $40 million boat is to begin operating next year and is one of several that will replace three boats that have been running for 40 years between Lower Manhattan and Staten Island. Larger and spiffier than its predecessors, it can carry up to 4,500 passengers and has an open upper deck where passengers can sit outside and enjoy the view. It will feature an artwork commissioned by the German artist Werner Klotz called ""The Middle of the World,"" a multimedia installation with a portal in the bridge deck through which passengers can view a video of the ocean floor.

A visionary, it took Irving Harris to discern the effectiveness of our model programs and invest in them. He always gave with trusting respect, a model for the field itself. His passing leaves a painful gap, but his light lives on in us, in countless babies, children, parents, workers, clinicians, researchers, and programs across North America, Israel, and beyond.

In his local Chicago Chapter, he served on the Advisory Council for 35 years and co-chaired its Major Gifts Event for nearly as long. He was awarded our prestigious Human Rights Medallion for his longstanding work to battle anti-Semitism and promote positive intergroup relations.

On the morning of Sept. 12 the Ramblers emerged from their lodgings to find that their van had been stolen. Inside were their instruments, sheet music and sound system, as well as compact disks and cases of hot sauce, which they sell at concerts. The only thing the Ramblers had left was their accordion, which they had taken inside. For Louis Michot, 25, the group's leader and a third-generation musician, the loss was particularly devastating. Among the stolen instruments was his fiddle, a 1925 Stradivarius copy given to him by his grandfather. Friends and fans in Denver found them instruments and took up a collection so the Ramblers, who include Mr. Michot's brother, Andre, 28, could rent a minivan for the drive home to Lafayette, La. Upon arriving, the Ramblers, whose members are all 30 or younger, were stunned to find that news of the theft, aided by the Internet, had spread throughout the Cajun music community. As a result, the group was flooded with offers of ""fiddles, basses, guitars, standup basses, drums, amplifiers"" and a complete sound system, Mr. Michot said. A local merchant invited him to pick out any violin in his shop. ""It's really mind-blowing,"" Mr. Michot said by telephone from Lafayette. ""First you're destroyed and devastated, then you have all this help, and you wonder how it's happening."" The loans will allow the Ramblers to keep their dates on Saturday and Sunday at the Chile Pepper Fiesta, running from noon to 5:30 pm. at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

The first inductees are Louis Armstrong, left, Sidney Bechet, Bix Beiderbecke, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Billie Holiday, Thelonious Monk, Jelly Roll Morton, Charlie Parker, Art Tatum and Lester Young. Relatives and friends of the inductees will accept the awards, to be given by musicians including Herbie Hancock, Hank Jones, Clark Terry, Randy Weston and Jazz at Lincoln Center's artistic director, Wynton Marsalis. The hall of fame is a gift of Ahmet Ertegun -- a Jazz at Lincoln Center board member and a founding chairman of Atlantic Records -- and his wife, Mica. They have named it in honor of Nesuhi Ertegun, Ahmet's late brother, another initial partner in Atlantic records and an important advocate for jazz in journalism, education and recordings. ""Originally, I thought it would be nice to have a space where people could see and hear the great pioneers of jazz, a place depicting the history,"" Mr. Ertegun said in an interview. ""But our board said that in America, a hall of fame is a draw for the public, especially for non-New Yorkers, and I agreed with them. This is a small space, but it will celebrate the great people of jazz, and give jazz fans a locus."" The musicians were chosen by a 72-member panel of educators, musicians and scholars. The Hall of Fame, which will be free and opens to the public on Oct. 21, includes interactive kiosks, touch-activated virtual plaques and a video wall, all centered on changing exhibitions.

Haliburton's not feeling the pain. The people in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, who get the money aren't feeling the pain.""

The five-year program includes $17 billion for basic upkeep, modernizing equipment and rehabilitating stations, as well as billions more for security improvements and expansion projects, including the Second Avenue subway line and connecting the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal. The authority had to pay for much of its last rebuilding program by itself by issuing bonds. Payments coming due on that debt, however, have produced yawning budget deficits.
