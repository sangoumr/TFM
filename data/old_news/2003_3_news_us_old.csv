In 1989, under the pseudonym Samir al-Khalil, Makiya published a book called ''Republic of Fear,'' which relentlessly dissected the totalitarian nature of Saddam's regime. The pseudonym wasn't a whim; in those years Iraq's overseas dissidents were frequently bumped off. Ignored upon publication, the book became a best seller the next year with the outbreak of the Persian Gulf war, and Makiya, the son of Iraq's most distinguished architect and a trained architect himself, was thrust into the turbulence of Middle Eastern politics. At the end of the war, during a forum at Harvard, the author revealed his identity for the first time and urged President George H.W. Bush to finish the job the war had left undone by getting rid of Saddam Hussein.

us,OF FOUNTAINS ABBEY AND STUDLEY ROYAL,"Take a steep-sided, tree-lined valley with a river running through it -- a North Yorkshire valley, to be precise, and the Skell River. Then consider how best to exploit these natural advantages. In the 12th century, a small group of disgruntled Benedictine monks, at odds with their abbot, took off from St. Mary's Abbey in York and settled in what was then a remote and wild spot to found their own community. They felt that St. Mary's had become too lax, and wanted to return to the original rule of St. Benedict, with a more austere and simple life, under the protection of the Archbishop of York. Later, they would be admitted to the stricter Cistercian branch of the Benedictines: from these small beginnings arose the great Cistercian Abbey of Fountains, founded in 1132. Centuries later, by which time Fountains Abbey was a picturesque ruin, John Aislabie, a prosperous landowner for whom business matters had not been going well, decided to take his mind off his irritation by immersing himself in the construction of a scenic water garden. He turned his attention to his estate next to the abbey ruins, saw its potential and set about moving earth and water until perfection was achieved. With a nice irony, the glowing stonework of the ruined abbey became the culminating view of the walk around the great green garden -- all that medieval power and piety reduced to the final flourish of an artificial landscape.",2003-03-02T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Unknown Night'," One damp April morning in 1916, Harrison Smith, a young reporter for the New York Tribune , left the Tribune Building on Nassau Street in a hurry. Dodging the crowds on the narrow sidewalks of lower Manhattan he headed for the subway kiosk on Park Row. He was on his way uptown to catch the Hudson Tubes to the New Jersey side of the Hudson River. In Jersey City he would board another train for Middletown, New York. It wasn't an obvious destination to chase down a story. In fact, senior reporters, who routinely got their names on the front page, hardly left the office at all. They were too busy writing up the dispatches that arrived from all over the world via telegraph, telephone, and that new noisy mechanical angel the aeroplane, which appeared like a gnat against the blustery American sky. There was plenty of news. German zeppelins were raining bombs on the English coast. The French were defending Verdun. Pancho Villa was hiding out from the American Tenth Cavalry in the rocky gulches of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Smith, on the other hand, faced a two-hour trip on a hard bench seat in a drafty carriage with a view of bare trees and muddy farm fields. He was on his way to interview an American artist, Ralph Albert Blakelock, who for the past fifteen years had been incarcerated, and largely forgotten, in an asylum in Middletown.

Photographs like Dorothea Lange's ''Migrant Mother'' gave a famously bleak picture of rural life in the Dust Bowl era. The archive, now a part of the Library of Congress, includes 145,000 frames of film. LONG TIME COMING: A Photographic Portrait of America, 1935-1943 (Norton, $65) contains more than 400 photographs, including more than 100 from previously unprinted negatives. Michael Lesy. a journalism professor at Hampshire College in Massachusetts, has left out the best-known pictures. What remains is a surprisingly complex portrait of pre-World War II America.

Instead of negotiating at our usual site near Pyongyang, we accepted the North's invitation to meet at a beach resort in Majon to discuss the details of building two safe nuclear reactors to replace the plutonium-producing ones they mothballed. Heading to the coast sounded like a great idea. But now that our delegation from the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization has arrived, I realize that we should have asked about our accommodations. Unlike the hotel near Pyongyang, which has a revolving restaurant on top, this place has no heating -- none whatsoever.

Since the law requires that assessments be charged at the same per-share rate for all shareholders, the method used by the board to recapture the abatements for the building unfairly penalizes senior citizens like me who are being assessed for more than twice my individual abatement.

The family held a private celebration of his life at their home on March 1, and a memorial service will be scheduled in the near future. Condolences may be sent to Helen Passin at 25 Claremont Avenue, New York, NY 10027.

They were the first wave of troops to enter eastern Afghanistan's forbidding Shah-i-Kot Valley as part of Operation Anaconda. The largest battle involving conventional United States troops to be fought in Afghanistan, Anaconda should serve as a cautionary tale for Americans convinced that our technological superiority is a foolproof defense against the element of surprise in the mountains of Afghanistan, the streets of Baghdad or on any other future battlefield.",2003-03-02T05:00:00+0000

A millionaire and philanthropist named Archibald brought a dozen or so over from Kenya around the turn of the century and kept them in an aviary built against the side of his house. A few days before his death, in a moment more notable for generosity than good sense, he swung open the cage and released the birds into a wide summer sky. According to eyewitness reports, the parrots made a dazed circle beneath the clouds, surprised by their sudden freedom, and, not immediately seeing anything more to their liking, lighted amid the branches of an apple orchard on the back acreage of Archibald's property. There, as is the habit of nature, they flourished and have continued to thrive for more than ninety years. But in September, when winter creeps in from the ocean and cold air kindles hazy instincts, the parrots flee south for warmer climes and settle here, in Elbow, Alabama, along a slow bend in the Black Warrior River, where perhaps they are reminded of waters, slower still, in an almost forgotten continent across the sea.

Born on December 5, 1936 in NY, Roy lived in this city all his life, and also had a home in Hadlyme, CT. After graduating from the High School of Art and Design, he served in the US Army, and then attended Cooper Union. Although trained as a graphic designer, he discovered his true calling in advertising and a true home at Doyle Dane Bernbach, which he joined as an art director in 1964. There he was responsible for much of the brilliant Volkswagen advertising during the 60's and 70's. His unique combination of marketing insight and creative flair was also demonstrated by his work on Alka Seltzer, American Tourister, IBM, Mobil and Chanel. Honored for this body of work, by 1986 he had become Creative Director of DDB Worldwide, as well as Chairman of DDB/NY. In 1986, Roy left DDB to found his own agency, Grace and Rothschild. Quickly establishing a reputation for creative excellence, Grace and Rothschild is best known for the US introduction of the Range Rover, and the fourteen years of Land Rover advertising that followed, as well as its work for J&B Scotch, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, and Whittle Communications. Among the hundreds of exceptional commercials created by Roy during his extraordinary career are the ''Mama Mia/Spicy Meatball'' commercial for Alka Seltzer, the ''Gorilla'' commercial for American Tourister and the Volkswagen ''funeral'' spot. These and many others have become more than merely excellent pieces of advertising-they have crossed over to become defining elements of the national culture. Roy's recognition by his peers is unanimous: 25 of Ad Age's 100 Best Commercials of All Time are his; four of his commercials are in the permanent collection of New York's Museum of Modern Art; over one hundred of his commercials are in the Museum of Television and Radio's permanent collection; he is in the Hall of Fame of both the Art Directors Club, and the One Club. Roy served as a trustee of Cooper Union, and was the recipient of its St. Gauden's Award as Outstanding Alumnus. He was also on the board of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. In addition to all his professional accomplishments, it must also be said that Roy Grace was a man of rare intellect, irresistible wit, great personal style and uncompromising character. Because he valued true excellence, he delighted in encouraging the talents of many young men and women. He leaves his wife of 37 years, Marcia, his daughter Jessica of New York, his son Nicholas of Los Angeles, and countless others for whom, by his example both personal and professional, he remains a hero. In his memory, gifts may be directed to the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, 1233 York Avenue, Room B 101, New York 10021.",2003-03-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Internet: New European Patent System Is Planned,"European governments ended decades of debate by agreeing yesterday to set up a patent system. The deal, which is subject to being ratified by European leaders at a summit meeting later this month, will allow companies to protect inventions throughout the European Union using a single patent, rather than 15 different ones as they must now. A patent will cost $27,000, around half what it costs now to register separately in each country, but still more expensive than patents in Japan and the United States. The initiative had been blocked because the European Union governments could not agree where to place the European patent court, or in which languages the patents should be published. They decided to place the court in Luxembourg in 2010, and to require companies to publish the first three pages of their patents in all of the union's languages. The rest of the document must be in one of the three main languages: English, German or French. Paul Meller (NYT)",2003-03-04T05:00:00+0000

A patent will cost $27,000, around half what it costs now to register separately in each country, but still more expensive than patents in Japan and the United States. The initiative had been blocked because the European Union governments could not agree where to place the European patent court, or in which languages the patents should be published. They decided to place the court in Luxembourg in 2010, and to require companies to publish the first three pages of their patents in all of the union's languages.

us,Technology Briefing | Hardware: OMM Plans To Cease Operations,"OMM, a leader in what was once the promising market for communications switches made of rapidly adjustable arrays of microscopic mirrors, said yesterday that it would cease operations on Friday. When Optical Micro-Machines, as the company was originally called, was founded in 1997, analysts expected such components to be widely used to increase communications capacity and speed and to cut costs. They allow signals traveling as light waves down optical fibers to be switched without being converted into electronic form. Some analysts had projected optical switches as the next major market for MEMS -- microelectromechanical systems -- the technology of tiny mechanical devices most widely used today in products like air bags in cars. Equipment makers like Nortel Networks, JDS Uniphase and Lucent Technologies invested billions of dollars in developing or acquiring the technology, but many early switches were unreliable and demand for them dried up when the demand for new capacity began falling in 2001. ''It's a product geared to telecom, and telecom is in the tank,'' said Philip Chapman, president and chief executive of OMM, which is based in San Diego. Mr. Chapman said that OMM had shipped more than $12 million in products since production began nearly three years ago but that there was no sign of demand reaching the level needed to support OMM's operations within the next two years. OMM attracted more than $150 million in venture capital financing from leading Silicon Valley companies and customers like Nortel, Siemens and Alcatel. Mr. Chapman said that OMM did not expect to enter bankruptcy as its assets exceeded its liabilities, but that all 85 employees would be laid off unless a buyer for the company emerges before Friday.

Making one, however, is a task: you have to cut the gauzy cheesecloth, then chase the peppercorns that slip out at the seam. Now Hiroko Shimbo, author of ''The Japanese Kitchen'' (Harvard Common, 2000), has made things easier. She has a line of thin pouches called Handy Disposable Bags that are large enough to accommodate a handful of aromatics, like bay leaves, thyme sprigs, dried orange peel, coriander seeds and peppercorns. The bags are made of a dense but permeable cloth with the texture of a fabric softener sheet. All you do is slip the herbs into the pouch and reverse the ''cuff'' on the top seam. The cuff wraps over the open seam and seals it well. Drop it into broths as you would a large teabag. The pouches are also handy for loose tea and for adding mint to iced tea. They are $5.95 (including shipping) for a box of 30 at www.hirokoskitchen.com, and $5.95 at A Cook's Companion, 152 Atlantic Avenue (Clinton Street), in Brooklyn; (718) 852-6901.

The restructuring is expected to close by the end of the week. It would leave Sirius's current shareholders with 8 percent of the company, which broadcasts 100 channels of digital music, talk and other radio programming nationwide via satellite. Sirius, which is based in New York, is competing with XM Satellite Radio, a similar new service based in Washington that entered the market earlier and has far more subscribers. Sirius said that the new financing would support a nationwide advertising program and the introduction of new radio equipment that would make it easy for subscribers to receive programming in their homes as well as in their cars and trucks. The new financing will carry Sirius into the second quarter of next year, Sirius's chief financial officer, John J. Scelfo, said. Mr. Scelfo said that Sirius would need less than $100 million more from investors next year to take it the rest of the way to its projected break-even point in 2005. That projection assumes that Sirius, which charges subscribers $12.95 a month, can expand from just under 30,000 subscribers at the end of last year to more than two million in 2005. Barnaby J.

The company was the lead investor in Iridium, the failed satellite-phone company. The lenders sought full repayment of an $800 million loan to Iridium, of which Motorola had guaranteed $300 million.

Motorola owned 18 percent of the satellite venture, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999 after failing to attract enough users for its 66-satellite global phone network. A Motorola spokeswoman, Jennifer Weyrauch, said that with the settlement, the secured lender group would receive $383 million, including the loan guarantee and interest. Motorola dropped its appeal of the $371 million in guarantees and interest the company paid last year to the Chase Manhattan Bank unit of J. P. Morgan Chase and to 17 other secured lenders.

us,Technology Briefing: Telecommunications," MOTOROLA SETTLES DISPUTE WITH IRIDIUM CREDITORS Motorola Inc., the world's second-biggest cellphone maker, will make a final $12 million payment to a group of Iridium creditors led by J. P. Morgan Chase to settle suits over loan repayments. The settlement resolves the dispute with the lender group, Motorola said yesterday. The company was the lead investor in Iridium, the failed satellite-phone company. The lenders sought full repayment of an $800 million loan to Iridium, of which Motorola had guaranteed $300 million. Motorola still faces a $4 billion lawsuit from a committee of unsecured Iridium creditors. Motorola owned 18 percent of the satellite venture, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999 after failing to attract enough users for its 66-satellite global phone network. A Motorola spokeswoman, Jennifer Weyrauch, said that with the settlement, the secured lender group would receive $383 million, including the loan guarantee and interest. Motorola dropped its appeal of the $371 million in guarantees and interest the company paid last year to the Chase Manhattan Bank unit of J. P. Morgan Chase and to 17 other secured lenders. It was ordered to make that payment by a federal court. &#0160;&#0160;(Bloomberg News) ",2003-03-07T05:00:00+0000

Sales rose 9.4 percent, to $404.3 million in the quarter ended on Feb. 23, from $369.5 million. Shares rose 43 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $16.60. The company attributed the sales increase to rising orders for analog chips. The chief executive, Brian L. Halla, has focused on those chips, which improve sound quality and battery life in products like mobile phones, as the company exits slower-growing businesses. Excluding costs from layoffs and a research-and-development write-off, the chip maker said its third-quarter loss would have been 3 cents a share.

Today it is known as the Brunetti Organization located in Old Bridge, New Jersey, with son, John and grandsons, John Jr., and Stephen at the helm. In 1942, the Brunetti family settled in Hackensack, New Jersey and three years later gave birth to their third child, Jo Ann H. Brunetti. The Brunetti's spent winters at their Florida residence and summers at their homes at Sea Girt and Hackensack, New Jersey. Anna and Joseph Brunetti, in the late 1950's developed a love for thoroughbred racehorses and owned such champions as ''Vertex'' and ''Staunchness''. In the late 1960's they built Red Oak Farm in Ocala, Florida and began breeding thoroughbred racehorses. Mrs. Brunetti served as a member of the Board of Directors of Hialeah Racetrack in Hialeah, Florida, which had been acquired by her son, John, in 1977. After the death of her husband in 1968, Mrs. Brunetti inaugurated The Brunetti Foundation. For over thirty years she has donated money to her favorite charitable organizations such as the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and many others. Also, contributions have been made to various schools such as the New York Military Academy, colleges and universities, some of which were attended by her children and grandchildren. Her wish was to provide students with the opportunity to achieve their educational goals. Additionally, medical centers such as Hackensack Medical Center, St. Barnabas Medical Center, Broward General Medical Center and others have been recipients of contributions from the Brunetti Foundation. Anna Brunetti was a loving mother, grandmother and greatgrandmother. She is survived by her two children, John J. Brunetti of Bal Harbour, Florida and Little Silver, New Jersey and Jo Ann H. Brunetti of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; her five grandchildren, Candace A. Moore of Vero Beach, Florida, Kimberly J. Simmons of Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey, John J. Brunetti Jr., of Wayside, New Jersey, Kelly Costa-Kelly of Vero Beach, Florida, and Stephen P. Brunetti of Aventura, Florida; her six great grandchildren, Mark Moore, Samantha Simmons, Michael Moore, Jessica Simmons, Courtney McKnight Brunetti, and Stephen P. Brunetti Jr., and her sister, Fannie Perillo of Clearwater, Florida. In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions to the Brunetti Foundation, 1655 US Highway 9, Old Bridge, New Jersey 08857 or contributions to other religious or charitable organizations.

Having started, it is incredibly difficult to stop. At some point we see the devastation created by our advanced medical support and then the debate starts. We have allocated the resources to prevent these deaths, and indeed, there have been numerous (productive) lives saved by this approach. Many devastated children have also been saved.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Who's Got Allegra?,"Clementine James sits uneasily in the spotlight. In Martha Sherrill's first novel, a sequence of events worthy of Hitchcock has made this disenchanted Hollywood journalist the next new thing. Clementine's final magazine assignment -- an interview with Allegra Coleman, a magnetic young actress -- turns into an extended road trip along Interstate 5. MY LAST MOVIE STAR (Random House, $23.95) begins with the car crash that brings their interview to an abrupt end. Amid the chaos Allegra disappears, sparking round-the-clock coverage and leaving our heroine a celebrity by association. As Clementine toys with her sudden status, she loses her sardonic edge and is soon posing for glam photo sessions and even indulging in a one-night stand with Allegra's empty-headed ex-boyfriend. The ''Allegra phenomenon'' reaches its crest with an elaborate candlelight vigil that is at once absurdly amusing and disturbingly familiar. While such developments have become almost impossible to satirize, Sherrill's entertaining if loosely plotted meditation on celebrity is smart and affectionate. (Clementine's proposed essay on the ''vagaries of fame'' may never materialize, but it provides a useful frame for the book.) A chorus of movie stars past -- Dorothy Lamour, Loretta Young, Myrna Loy -- visit her to reminisce and offer advice, and in a bizarre but rewarding twist dominate the second half of ''My Last Movie Star.'' Indeed, the novel is as much a celebration of screen legends (buffs will be drawn to Sherrill's filmography) as it is a cautionary tale. Ihsan Taylor",2003-03-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Let the Punishment Fit the Crime,"HAROLD Bloom likes to annoy people by saying that Shakespeare invented the human. Stripped of Bloom-speak, what that means is that the inner lives we think we learned about from Freud were actually revealed to us by Shakespeare, since Bloom credits his characters with being the first both to speak and to listen to themselves. If sheer cultural influence is the measure of greatness, though, Dante Alighieri should probably rank higher than Shakespeare, since Dante dreamed up something that, sadly, has had even more impact than depth psychology. He invented the infernal. Dante's ''Inferno'' gave us our first glimpse of a universe we once again inhabit: a topography of graphic, gruesome suffering. The Dante scholar John Freccero might have been talking about Kosovo or Rwanda or any other post-genocidal landscape when he wrote, ''The ruined portals and fallen bridges of Hell are emblems of the failure of all bonds among the souls who might once have been members of the human community.''",2003-03-09T05:00:00+0000

Perched high in the northwestern corner of Pennsylvania, with its face toward the lake and its back toward the rest of the state, Erie is the only lake port town in Pennsylvania. Even people in other parts of the state often are surprised to learn that until the last year or so it was their third largest municipality, after the elegant and history-wrapped city of Philadelphia and the brawny sophistication of Pittsburgh. The town of about one hundred thousand just doesn't seem that big-not so much because it is remote, which it is, but because it is so narrow , so provincial . ",2003-03-09T05:00:00+0000

Yale was rocked by a five-day strike that involved nearly 4,000 workers from four different unions, representing janitors, dining hall workers, secretaries, graduate teaching assistants and food workers at Yale-New Haven Hospital. It was the eighth strike at Yale since 1968. The unions said the main issue was pensions, but Yale said the unions struck largely to pressure the university to grant union recognition to its graduate teaching assistants.

us,Evolution for Beginners,"Can the theory of evolution be made comprehensible to second graders? In LIFE ON EARTH (Houghton Mifflin, $16; ages 6 to 10), Steve Jenkins gives it a solid effort as author and illustrator of this attractive nonfiction picture book, showcasing the detailed cut-paper collages he has used to great effect in numerous other natural science books, including ''Slap, Squeak, and Scatter: How Animals Communicate'' (2001) and ''What Do You Do When Something Wants to Eat You?'' (1997). His most impressive spreads here depict a wide variety of animals and plants laid out side by side on white backgrounds, like specimens under glass. Though not drawn to scale -- the centipede appears as long as the monk seal, the mammoth strawberry could roll over and crush the diminutive ostrich -- these illustrations do engender amazement at the earth's incredible biodiversity, ultimately descended, as the text explains, from single-celled organisms. Jenkins covers the basics: fossil evidence, mutation, natural selection, extinction; and his illustrative examples, such as a lineup showing the varied beaks on Darwin's Galpagos finches, help flesh out the text's streamlined descriptions. Yet in simplifying both what the theory of evolution says and how it came to have general acceptance, he leaves some unfortunate holes. There is no mention of controversy, no mention of more recent evidence, like the discovery of the structure of DNA, that supports Darwin's observations. An illustrated timeline toward the book's beginning goes through the various life forms as they arose -- from bacteria to sea life to the first land organisms, and so on. But the rudimentary explanations of evolutionary theory that follow don't give much of a feel for why scientists think all this diversity evolved. A book for an older audience might have included more nuanced scientific speculation about why, for instance, prehistoric fish evolved into species able to creep onto the shore. Still, in offering an accessible introduction to a complex topic, ''Life on Earth'' taps into children's sense of wonder about the world, which is the great starting point for scientific exploration. Absorbing the general outline now could make young readers better equipped to tackle the full ''story of evolution'' a few years down the road. Christine Heppermann",2003-03-09T05:00:00+0000

It was the first lethal suicide bombing against Israelis in two months, and it came as Israel was putting intense pressure on Hamas, with frequent armored raids into the Gaza Strip. A woman in her ninth month of pregnancy was killed in one such raid last week, as Israeli forces demolished a neighboring home. After the Haifa bombing, 11 Palestinians died when Israeli forces stormed Gaza's Jabiliya refugee camp. Eight were killed by what Palestinian witnesses said was an Israeli tank shell. Israel said the blast came from a Palestinian explosive. By the end of the week, Israel for the first time began seizing and holding Palestinian-controlled territory in Gaza, saying that doing so was the only way to suppress Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli targets.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that Motorola and Nokia could not bring such federal charges against the Uzans because they had not yet tried to recover as much as possible of the nearly $3 billion they lent to a Turkish cellphone company controlled by the Uzans. The appeals court also ordered Judge Jed S. Rakoff to reconsider numerous decisions he had made that favored Motorola and Nokia, and to decide whether he should continue to hear related claims now that the racketeering charges must be dropped. Representatives of the Uzans said that the decision vindicated their argument that loan terms required that the dispute be transferred to arbitrators in Switzerland. They expect arbitrators to conclude that market conditions have delayed repayment of the loans. Motorola and Nokia, which had introduced evidence that the Uzans had transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to private accounts, among other fraudulent activities, said the ruling was only a minor setback and that they would be able to continue pursuing recovery in the United States. Judge Rakoff has called a hearing for Thursday. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)",2003-03-11T05:00:00+0000

The judge, Gene Carter, said no immediate action by the court was needed because the town has not followed through on its threat to cancel the restaurant's liquor license and because the umbrellas will not be used again until May. Judge Carter said he would decide the restaurant's First Amendment challenge to the ordinance in later proceedings. Adam Liptak (NYT)",2003-03-11T05:00:00+0000

A United States government panel said last year that a new anthrax vaccine was needed because the only one available, made by the BioPort Corporation, was based on outdated technology. That vaccine requires a six-dose regimen over 18 months. Vical, based in San Diego, has data that shows its vaccine protected rabbits from anthrax. Vijay B.

One of the most storied venues in sports history, Yankee Stadium may be a little worn around the edges, but there's no denying its aura. The original stadium opened in 1923, as 74,200 fans packed the massive three-tiered facility and watched Babe Ruth christen his new home with a towering shot as the Yankees beat their hated rivals, the Boston Red Sox. Because Ruth was such a tremendous draw, Yankee Stadium almost immediately acquired its moniker, ""The House that Ruth Built."" The park was remodeled and scaled down slightly in the mid-70's, but historic touches remain, including Monument Park and the decorative white colonnade above the outfield. Some of baseball's most legendary names have played at the Stadium, including Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle, to name but a few. It was here that Gehrig delivered his famous farewell address (""Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth""), and here that three perfect games have been hurled (by Don Larsen, David Wells and David Cone). The current team, World Champions in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000, is a perennial contender to do it again-just like the ""Murderer's Row"" squads of the 1920's and 1930's, and the unstoppable Yankees juggernaut of the early 1960's. Buy tickets in advance, and take public transporation to the stadium (traffic is a nightmare). Don't miss the raucous chants from Bleacher Creatures-as if you could. Hardcore fans can take stadium tours; call (718) 579-4531 or check the Web site for details. Tickets: $8-$65; available through Ticketmaster, at www.yankees.com, at the stadium or at Yankees Clubhouse stores. Subway: 4, B, D to 161st St.-Yankee Stadium. ",2003-03-11T05:00:00+0000

''The company's management, board, and outside advisers did not satisfy what we believe are appropriate standards of corporate stewardship and professionalism,'' the three-member panel said in a report filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. The committee was formed last year to investigate accusations of wrongdoing at the fiber optic network operator. Roy L. Olofson, the former vice president for finance, has said the swaps lacked a legitimate business purpose and were set up simply to inflate sales and obscure worsening financial performance. His accusations preceded the January 2002 bankruptcy protection filing of Global Crossing, which listed $12.4 billion in debt after a glut of fiber optic capacity sent network prices plunging. In 2000 and 2001, Global Crossing leased its network to rivals and rented space from them in transactions in which little or no cash exchanged hands. The company booked revenue from the swaps up front, while spreading out the costs over an extended period. Mr. Olofson called the swaps a ''sham.'' The special committee concluded that while such transactions ''had a legitimate business purpose,'' Global Crossing came to depend on them too much.",2003-03-11T05:00:00+0000

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that Motorola and Nokia could not bring such federal charges against the Uzans because they had not yet tried to recover as much as possible of the nearly $3 billion they lent to a Turkish cellphone company controlled by the Uzans. The appeals court also ordered Judge Jed S. Rakoff to reconsider numerous decisions he had made that favored Motorola and Nokia, and to decide whether he should continue to hear related claims now that the racketeering charges must be dropped. Representatives of the Uzans said that the decision vindicated their argument that loan terms required that the dispute be transferred to arbitrators in Switzerland. They expect arbitrators to conclude that market conditions have delayed repayment of the loans. Motorola and Nokia, which had introduced evidence that the Uzans had transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to private accounts, among other fraudulent activities, said the ruling was only a minor setback and that they would be able to continue pursuing recovery in the United States. Judge Rakoff has called a hearing for Thursday. &#0160;&#0160;Barnaby J. Feder (NYT) ",2003-03-11T05:00:00+0000

The shares rose 13 percent. The job cuts, including at least 1,100 in the United States, will help save 250 million euros ($271 million) a year, Scott McGregor, head of the division, said yesterday. Philips, which had a record loss in 2002, will shut a plant in San Antonio in addition to an already announced shutdown in Albuquerque. Philips and larger chip rivals like STMicroelectronics and Infineon Technologies have been slashing costs since the industry's worst slump ever in 2001. The chief executive, Gerard Kleisterlee, predicted a ''slow market'' yesterday for chips this year in an interview at a technology fair in Germany. Shares of Philips rose 1.61 euros to 14.26 euros, its biggest one-day percentage gain since Oct. 15.",2003-03-14T05:00:00+0000

Bower cited medical noncompliance and violent threats as grounds for terminating care. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, agreed with him, ruling that doctors can refuse to treat violent or intransigent patients as long as they give proper notice so that the patient can find alternative care.

Other Italian businesses may have closed and Piccolo's may be the last tiny business venture on a block now full of multistory buildings, but this neighborhood grill has hummed along nearly 50 years. Its cheese steaks are so well known that there has been talk of renaming it Piccolo's Cheese Steaks. Sure, other things are on the menu, like Italian soups, pasta and specials of meatloaf and fried fish on Fridays. But something about Piccolo's combination of bread, meat and cheese -- amid much Frank Sinatra lore -- keeps generations of customers coming back. The cheese steak sandwich ($6.50) doesn't look like much, served without garnish on a plain white plate. The chewy bread comes from a local Italian bakery, the cheese is American, and the meat, in a thicker slice than usual, is the real deal. No Steak-Umms here; the rib steak is boned and cut by hand by Piccolo's founder, Joseph Spaccavento, and his son, Pat, better known as Patty, who runs the daily operations. Toppings include raw or sauted onions, hot peppers and ketchup or mustard depending on personal preference. Is there a right way to eat it? ''Whatever you enjoy is the right way,'' Patty said. Even if there were a wrong way, Patty wouldn't tell you. After all, he is in the business of pleasing people. One way he does that is deliver, not just to Hoboken and parts of Jersey City but across the river to Manhattan, as long it's ''worth my while,'' he said with a laugh. Once or twice a month, Piccolo's even delivers some 225 sandwiches to Wall Street by ferry. Besides a minimum order of 15 sandwiches and a pickup at the ferry terminal, Patty requires one more thing to make a delivery to the Big Apple: you must ''take care of the person who makes the delivery.''

Iowa, the most famous center for stuttering research in the world. Around the country, speech pathology was fighting to be recognized as a science, and Iowa was the new discipline's polestar. Dozens of experiments were under way when Johnson arrived, and he enthusiastically threw himself into the invigorating work, switching to psychology for his master's study.

Any and all absences from patrol duty for training, vacations or sick leave result in chronic shortages of police officers.For the record, Nassau County has offered no bona fide incentives for veteran police officers to retire. Hundreds of experienced Nassau County police officers, myself included, have retired in response to enhanced pensions due to 9/11-related earnings, persistent and unwarranted verbal attacks in the media by the county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, chronic abuses of their contractual rights by the police commissioner, William Lawrence, and his senior command staff, and lack of opportunitites for career advancement or promotion. The ranks of the ''thin blue line'' will continue to diminish in response to these retirement ''incentives.''",2003-03-16T05:00:00+0000

Detecting high blood pressure, for example, and treating it can cut a patient's risk of stroke by a third and the chances of heart disease by 20 percent. Identifying patients with the first signs of diabetes and controlling their blood sugar can help significantly reduce the chances of cardiovascular disease, kidney and neurological damage and blindness. By spotting an abdominal aneurysm, doctors can monitor the progress of the defect and repair it before it ruptures. The notion that disease could be prevented at all was shaped by the sanitary movement of the 19th century, when doctors and antipoverty activists set about improving the living conditions of the poor and reduced the appalling rates of infectious disease. Today, the simplest and most effective prevention medicine stops disease before it starts through vaccinations, for instance, or encouraging people to exercise more, smoke less, eat fruits and vegetables and drink in moderation -- all of which can cut the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke.",2003-03-16T05:00:00+0000

He lived more life in his 33 years than most people live or know about in a lifetime. He was the most gentle, loving, fabulous son his mother, Lynne, and his father, Robert, could ever wish for. He was the best brother his sister Alison could ever have. They shared a very special relationship. He was the best friend and most loving husband Christine could ever have. He was the best uncle Daniela could ever have. He was the best brother-in law David could ever have. He was the best grandson Annette could ever have. He was the best grandson Marian could ever have. Cary was an inspiration to us all. To those who loved Cary, and were helped by him, his memory will be eternal. If he was your friend...you were made! He grew up in Head of the Harbor and Montauk, New York. As a little boy he worked in and around the waters of Montauk. His passion for the sea and his love of boating was an integral part of his life. As an adult his goals and achievements were nothing short of spectacular! Some people come into our lives and quietly go. Others stay for a while and leave footprints on our hearts and we are never the same. We mourn, oh how we mourn the death of our dear Cary. He was truly an extraordinary gift for life, for hope, for friendship, for love and generosity. He was open, he was guileless, he was one of a kind. In our hearts and in our memories his light and spirit will be with us always. What we have once treasured, we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us. Cary Grossman left this earth on March 6, 2003, due to a sudden heart attack in his home in Florida. Cary, we will love you forever. ''Do not stand by his grave and weep.

And then Donald Rumsfeld, the fellow with the iron quiff and the Scout-leader spectacles, decides to blurt the unmentionable truth: the Pentagon is perfectly happy to polish off Saddam Hussein on its own.",2003-03-16T05:00:00+0000

America's argument about media bias features just two points of view. The right argues that the media is biased toward leftists. The other side responds, to quote David Broder, ""dean"" of the Washington press corps, ""There just isn't enough ideology in the average reporter to fill a thimble."" The idea that the media might, for reasons of ownership, economics, class, or outside pressure, actually be more sympathetic to conservative causes than to liberal ones is widely considered to be simply beyond the pale.

The film, which has its premiere tonight on HBO, seems to be working the ''About Schmidt'' vein, with a streak of ''Six Feet Under'' hyperrealism. The initial scenes keep up the illusion: that wriggling dessert is being served at a 25th-anniversary party, and the guests spout heartfelt Hallmark sentiments about the couple: ''Never a cross word between them!'' says their minister. Then the husband, Roy Applewood, faints dead away, just like Tony Soprano before him. During the ensuing therapy session, he reveals nothing so straightforward as Mafia membership.

Sometimes I answer, protest aloud, demanding to be left in peace. Yesterday in the baker's shop that I frequent on the Via San Tommaso I must have shouted out something, her name, perhaps, for suddenly everyone in the crowded place was looking at me, as they do here, not in alarm or disapproval but simple curiosity. They all know me by now, the baker and the butcher and the fellow at the vegetable stall, and their customers, too, hennaed housewives, mostly, plump as pigeons, with their perfume and ugly jewellery and great, dark, disappointed eyes. I note their remarkably slender legs; they age from the top down, for these are still the legs, suggestively a little bowed, that they must have had in their twenties or even earlier. Clearly I interest them. Perhaps what appeals to them is the suggestion of the commedia dell'arte in my appearance, the one-eyed glare and comically spavined gait, the stick and hat in place of Harlequin's club and mask. They do not seem to mind if I am mad. But I am not mad, really, only very, very old. I feel I have been alive for aeons. When I look back I see what seems a primordial darkness, scattered with points of cold, hard light, immensely distant, each from each, and from me. Soon, in a few months, we shall enter the final decade of this millennium; I will not live to see the next one, a matter of some regret, the previous two having generated such glories, such delights.

Lauderdale 27 years ago with her late husband, Simon Maringer, M.D. She was born in Hungary in 1913 into a family that would grow to five sisters and two brothers. After getting married she spent several years in the diamond trade in Antwerp, Belgium, where her diamond cutting skills were developed. With the advent of World War II her life became one of survival. After escaping from Germany she and her husband spent the next several years in France where she gave birth to her son, George. The fall of France and its occupation by German forces once again forced them to search out freedom, which they achieved by fleeing to Switzerland where they were granted asylum. Her husband, Simon, completed his medical training and in 1947 they emigrated to the United States. After taking all the required courses she became an EEG and ECG technician in her husband's medical practice. Several years later she enrolled in studio classes that helped to develop and hone her artistic skills. Over time she became an accomplished sculptress. Her works in marble, agate, greenstone and wood were seen in group shows and galleries in NYC. Her works are in many corporate as well as private collections. But, as important as art was to her, the most important aspect of her life was her family. She was a devoted and caring wife, mother and later in life a wonderful grandmother. No matter what life threw at her she maintained her happy and smiling way. Visitors were always welcome and amazed by her green thumb and her apple strudel. Irene will be missed by all those who knew and loved her. She is survived by her son, George, and her grandson, Alan.

Now comes ''100th Window,'' and it doesn't take long to announce itself as the group's new record.

Thus we embraced our status as refugees, a term formally defined in 1951 by the United Nations to include those who fear persecution for membership in a particular social group -- in our case, those who can afford neither a three-bedroom Manhattan co-op nor private school tuition.

The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department agreed with his office, Mr. Comey said. Mr. Dorismond, an unarmed black security guard, was fatally shot by a Hispanic undercover detective during a struggle over the detective's gun outside an Eighth Avenue bar in March 2000. The episode became a symbol of worsening relations between blacks and the police. The city recently agreed to pay $2.25 million to the family to settle a civil suit in the case. Derek S.

The new hole affects computers running a part of Windows 2000 known as Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, which allows users to work on Web pages remotely. Russ Cooper, a Microsoft security expert at the TruSecure Corporation, said yesterday that the machine that was attacked was a poorly secured server used by the U.S. Army and that the attacker was using the target computer to probe other machines. Mr. Cooper said that the affected machine was probably a relatively unimportant server, since the Army incorporates more stringent security measures on critically important systems. The vulnerability affects only users of Windows 2000; later versions of Windows are shipped with the vulnerable functions turned off to avoid inadvertent security problems, a Microsoft spokesman, Sean Sundwall, said.

His luminous career with TWU began as a bus operator in 1953 at the Kingsbridge Depot in the Bronx.

His passing is a heartbreaking loss to this union and to the thousands of transportation workers whose lives have been immeasurably enhanced by his work. His indefatigable devotion to this union and its membership will never be forgotten, and his countless contributions to TWU members will live on in the form of better wages, benefits and working conditions for generations of transit workers to come. Those who had the privilege to know and work with him at TWU will forever miss his caring friendship and constant good nature.

Net income in the quarter ended Feb. 28 rose to $4.24 million, or 12 cents a share, from $2.46 million, or 6 cents, in the year-earlier period, the company said. Sales rose 11 percent, to $71.8 million. Progress Software said it sold more products from its Sonic Software unit; those products allow computer data to run on different software programs. The company, which is based in Bedford, Mass., expects second-quarter sales to rise as much as 14 percent from the year-earlier period, exceeding analysts' forecasts. Second-quarter sales will rise 12 percent to 14 percent, reaching $75.7 million to $77 million, and earnings per share will be 16 cents to 18 cents, the chief financial officer, Norman Robertson, said in an interview. The company was expected to earn 16 cents a share on sales of $73.2 million, the average of six analysts in a Thomson Financial survey. Sales in the first quarter a year ago were $64.5 million. The company expects 2003 sales to be 11 percent to 13 percent above last year's $273.1 million, Mr. Robertson said. Events in Iraq could be a factor, he said. ''Sixty percent of our business is outside of North America and 45 percent of that is in Europe,'' Mr. Robertson said. ''In Europe, when war happens, they put everything on hold.''

Microchip Technology had projected sales would be little changed from the $171 million of the third quarter and predicted profit of 18 cents. Businesses and consumers are spending less on automobiles and office products that use the chips as war looms in Iraq and tensions rise in the Korean peninsula, the company said. Sales in Korea will fall more than 20 percent, pushing revenue in Asia down 8 percent from the third quarter. The reduction could signal tough times ahead for rival chip makers, analysts said. Microchip Technology shares fell after the report, dropping as much as $3.48, to $20.26 in after-hours trading. They had gained 69 cents, to $23.74. (Bloomberg News) ",2003-03-19T05:00:00+0000

Last December, Ronald Dixon of Canarsie shot and injured the intruder but did not have a New York gun license. The district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, above, charged Mr. Dixon with a misdemeanor that could have led to one year in prison. But, after criticism, Mr. Hynes sought to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor punishable by 90 days. Mr. Dixon's lawyer, Andrew G. Friedman, opposed the move because Mr. Dixon would no longer be entitled to a trial by a jury, which Mr. Friedman was certain would acquit Mr. Dixon. But a Brooklyn criminal court judge, Alvin Yearwood, ruled yesterday that Mr. Hynes had the power to reduce the charge. William Glaberson (NYT)",2003-03-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Bankruptcy Filing For Hughes Unit,"The unit of the Hughes Electronics Corporation that broadcasts the DirecTV satellite television service in Latin America filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday. The company cited a loss of subscribers and the departure of its chairman. DirecTV Latin America said it would ask a judge to approve a $300 million loan from Hughes to continue operating in bankruptcy. The operation, the region's largest satellite TV service, had $600 million in assets and $1.6 billion in debts on Dec. 31, according to papers filed in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. The declining value of Latin American currencies reduced DirecTV's sales when converted into dollars and the service lost subscribers amid weakness in the region's economies. DirecTV Latin America might eventually merge with the Sky Latin America unit of the News Corporation, investors said. News Corporation executives have said they might buy a controlling stake in Hughes, whose DirecTV unit is the biggest satellite TV service in the United States, with about 11.2 million subscribers. A News Corporation spokesman, Andrew Butcher, declined to comment.

us,Yashin Powers the Islanders," Aleksei Yashin, the $90,000-a-game center who has not been worth his salary in too many Islanders' games this season, reverted to All-Star form last night in Montreal and was feisty, confident and unstoppable. Yashin scored two goals and had three assists to power the Islanders to an important 6-3 victory over the Montreal Canadiens before a crowd of 21,273 at the Bell Center, many of whom booed during the singing of the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' before the game in a gesture of disagreement with the United States military action in Iraq. The booing by the French-Canadian fans appeared to inspire the Islanders (33-29-10-2), who all but ended the Canadiens' playoff hopes. Montreal (27-32-8-8) trails the Islanders by 8 points with seven games remaining. The Islanders lead the ninth-place Rangers (30-33-9-3) by 6 points. ``We were pretty excited before the game, but when they booed the national anthem, we really started getting going,'' said right wing Mark Parrish, one of five United States-born players on the Islanders. ``Even the Canadien guys were ticked off.'' Yashin, who entered the game with 16 goals, had his first 5-point game of the season, and the Canadiens were clearly rattled to the end. Montreal goaltender Jose Theodore chased after Mattias Weinhandl after Weinhandl barreled into him with 13 minutes 3 seconds remaining. Jason Blake had knocked over Theodore less than 4 minutes earlier. The Islanders pounced on Montreal in the second period. Blake scored his 25th goal of the season 11 seconds after Dave Scatchard won the opening face-off of the period. The Islanders scored again 40 seconds later. Yashin caught up to a loose puck deep in the Montreal zone and fired it along the goal line at Theodore. Oleg Kvasha smacked in his 10th goal to make it 3-0.

Mr. Fahrholz was an architect of Allianz's $25 billion acquisition of Dresdner in 2001, a deal that was supposed to create an insurance and banking behemoth.

Some excited TV commentators likened the scene to the devastation caused by the extensive bombing of Dresden and other cities during World War II, an analogy that brought a bristling rebuttal from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who insisted that the strikes were carefully targeted against military installations and kept away from civilians. That assertion will be put to the test when neutral observers on the ground have a chance to assess the damage.

The same quantity will be sold each day and the total for the quarter will be based on the preceding quarter's new reserves.

He was born in New York City on April 9, 1920 to William and Mary (Smith) Dixon. General Dixon moved to Fair Oaks Ranch in 1982, following his retirement as President and Chairman of the Board of Fairchild Republic Company. He is survived by his wife, Kelly; son, Tom (Linda), son, Roland, daughter, Mary, daughter, Kelly Lee Cooper (William); and grandchildren, Hillary Dixon, Adam Dixon, Charlotte Cooper and Emma Cooper. General Dixon retired from the US Air Force as Commander of the US Air Force's Tactical Air Command on 30 April 1978 after more than 37 years of active military service with the Royal Canadian Air Force, Royal Air Force, Army Air Corps and the USAF. He was a command pilot with more than 5000 hours of flying time. After graduation from Dartmouth College in 1941 with a BA degree in Literature, General Dixon entered pilot training in the US Army Air Corps, followed by training in the Royal Canadian Air Force and was commissioned a Pilot Officer in the RCAF. He transferred to the Army Air Corps in 1943 as a 1st Lieutenant serving in the United Kingdom. General Dixon served as a fighter pilot in three wars, World War II where he flew Spitfires, P-38s and P-51s. He was shot down over an oil refinery in Germany and taken prisoner. He flew 28 combat missions in F86s before the armistice in the Korean War. He was the Vice Commander of the Seventh Air Force during the Vietnam War where he flew 36 combat missions in the F-4, RF-4 and other Seventh Air Force aircraft. Upon his return from Vietnam on August 1, 1970, General Dixon was promoted to Lieutenant General and became the Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel, Headquarters USAF. General Dixon was in this position when the Vietnamese released the US Prisoners of War and, drawing on his personal experiences was instrumental in developing and implementing the actions necessary to welcome them back to the Air Force and transition those who so desired back into successful career paths. On October 1, 1973, he was promoted to General and selected as Commander of Tactical Air Command (CINCAFLANT) until his retirement in 1978. While TAC Commander, General Dixon implemented and developed Red Flag Combat Training and began the ''Flags'' exercises in Command/Combat Maintenance, and with the RCAF, among others. General Dixon, and TAC, were awarded the Collier Trophy for developing Red Flag. While Commander of TAC, General Dixon was inducted into the Tactical Air Command Order of the Sword, the highest honor bestowed by non-commissioned officers. After his Air Force retirement, General Dixon was President and Chairman of the Board of the Fairchild Republic Company from 1978 to 1982. After 1982 he was an independent consulting contractor with various aerospace industries and served on numerous boards including the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and Burdeshaw Associates. He also served as a Trustee of the Falcon Foundation, United States Air Force Academy. Among General Dixon's military decorations and awards are the Distinguished Service Cross, the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the British Distinguished Flying Cross, the Legion of Merit with one Oak Leaf Cluster, the US Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star Medal, the Air Medal with 11 Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Purple Heart.

us,'Regarding the Pain of Others'," In June 1938 Virginia Woolf published Three Guineas , her brave, unwelcomed reflections on the roots of war. Written during the preceding two years, while she and most of her intimates and fellow writers were rapt by the advancing fascist insurrection in Spain, the book was couched as the very tardy reply to a letter from an eminent lawyer in London who had asked, ""How in your opinion are we to prevent war?"" Woolf begins by observing tartly that a truthful dialogue between them may not be possible. For though they belong to the same class, ""the educated class,"" a vast gulf separates them: the lawyer is a man and she is a woman. Men make war. Men (most men) like war, since for men there is ""some glory, some necessity, some satisfaction in fighting"" that women (most women) do not feel or enjoy. What does an educated-read: privileged, well-off-woman like her know of war? Can her recoil from its allure be like his? ",2003-03-23T05:00:00+0000

''The air molecules themselves convert this ultrasonic frequency back down to a frequency that can be heard.'' So unlike sound that travels on radio waves and has to be converted by your stereo's receiver, you simply need to be standing in the path of an HSS beam in order to hear the sound.

In ''Yolanda,'' a boy can't help overhearing the spats and erotic rapprochements next door between a young beauty and an older husband so jealous that he orders her to quit selling lipstick because it's ''putting ideas'' in her head. When she flees his ursine grasp (''even his fingers needed a haircut'') to hide in the 12-year-old's bed, it's only the logical extension of Brownsville intimacy. With a quiet mastery of the smallest detail, Casares puts us on neighborly terms with the locals. A baby walks ''like a little drunk man,'' a dog sniffs ''up the right leg and down the left, as if it were frisking a suspect,'' a slacker finds a monkey's head and fantasizes about their eternal boyish monkeyshines together, to stave off growing up and taking that security job at Amigoland Mall. The author makes us feel the loving mismatch between Brownsville, Tex., and Mexico: one immigrant character ''had tried to live his father's life, but now it felt as if he were standing in the middle of a river trying to stretch his arms and touch both sides. No matter what he did, he'd never reach far enough.'' Casares should reach beyond vignettes, but as for character, place and crisp lingo: so far, so good. Tim Appelo",2003-03-23T05:00:00+0000

With the territorial gang lord Granville Oliver out of commission and on trial for his life, business ethics dictate that two rival gangs should beef up their arsenals and fight it out for his drug trade.

''Long as kids down here had no fathers and were looking to belong to something,'' Foreman says, ''then there was gonna be gangs and a need for guns.''",2003-03-23T05:00:00+0000

The hero, Victor (Victor Rasuk), sets out to capture the heart of ''Juicy Judy'' (Judy Marte), the hottest girl in his Lower East Side neighborhood, in order to salvage his reputation after his friends find out he's been sleeping with the unattractive and unpopular ''Fat Donna'' (Donna Maldonado).",2003-03-23T05:00:00+0000

My friend wasn't so sure. Yes, the costumes and wigs and camera angles all betrayed an exactitude that only a true obsessive would worry about; but she was convinced that there was more here than just an uncannily sharp eye for midcentury modern. Beneath all that Heywood-Wakefield, she argued, there was something real, something authentic. ''It's not just a pair of quotation marks,'' she said, making that little gesture with the first and second fingers of both hands that had become the intellectual tic of the 80's and 90's -- the ''ironic'' sign meant to signal the speaker's awareness that, culturally speaking, everything was a rerun.",2003-03-23T05:00:00+0000

He was the host of radio's famous Make-Believe Ballroom, on WNEW-AM before the station was sold and became a news station in 1992. He was 53. He died of complications after surgery and a prolonged illness. After serving in the U.S. Army in Vietnam in 1969 and 1970, Mr. Burdsall began a career as a radio announcer at WMMR-FM in Philadelphia, an album-oriented rock station. He left WMMR-FM for Philadelphia's WIOQ-FM in 1978, in both cases using the name ''Jim Harlan'' as his on-air name. New York City's new disco station WKTU-FM hired him in the early 1980s, using him as an on-air talent and sending him out to represent the station at its various New York club events. When the disco format fizzled, and new ownership switched the format to rock, ''Jim Harlan'' played the last disco song on WKTU and welcomed listeners to WXRK-FM, known as K-ROCK. He later moved to WNEW-AM, the music station known for playing standards, and took over as host of the legendary Make-Believe Ballroom show which aired from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. ''Jim Harlan'' brought stars of the music world to his show, interviewing Mel Torme, Rosemary Clooney and others on the air. The Make-Believe Ballroom was the longest running radio show in the country when WNEW was sold and switched to an all-news format in 1992. He was the last host of the famous show. Most recently, he hosted music shows on WVNJ. He is survived by a son, Matthew, of New Canaan, CT, and a brother, John, of Little Silver, NJ. A memorial service will be held at the New Canaan Methodist Church, 165 South Avenue, New Canaan, CT, at 1:30 P.M. on March 30",2003-03-23T05:00:00+0000

Novartis will also pay the company, as opposed to investors, $75 million up front, with additional payments later if the drug gains approval.

The latest restatements, coming amid continuing investigations by the S.E.C. and the Justice Department into the company's financial results for those years, will count sales to customers as revenue. Before 2001, the company counted sales to distributors as revenue. The company said it would try to file its 2002 Form 10-K results, which were due at the end of the month, along with the restated financial results as quickly as reasonably possible. Last year, the S.E.C. began a formal investigation of Network Associates' accounting practices during 2000. The commission looked at the company's former practice of booking revenue on products shipped into distribution channels, before they went to customers. The practice is not illegal, as long as it is fully disclosed to investors. Shares of Network Associates fell 53 cents, to $14.85.",2003-03-27T05:00:00+0000

At the center of a political dispute between AES and the Brazilian government, Eletropaulo could be facing renationalization because of its default on its Brazilian debt payments worth more than $400 million early this year. Like most of the Brazilian power sector, Eletropaulo has suffered from a 35 percent depreciation in Brazil's currency and continuing low consumption. Brazil's development bank, which lent $1.2 billion to AES to buy Eletropaulo in 1998, has indicated it could repossess the utility and put it up for sale if AES, based in Arlington, Va., does not honor its debt.

Is it still a refuge for slackers who don't want to grow up and move to Houston or Dallas? Now, after the influence and affluence of a high-tech boom in the 90's, the agonizers wear T-shirts pleading, ''Keep Austin Weird.'' After all, Armadillo World Headquarters, the nightclub where cowboys and hippies gathered to create country rock, is buried under concrete; chilly Barton Springs Pool, the spring-fed pond where swimmers compare goose bumps, has been closed to test for toxins.

Last month, seven Iraqi families filed suit in Brussels against Mr. Bush for the bombing of a civilian shelter in Baghdad in the 1991 Persian Gulf war in which 403 people died. The suit led to sharp complaints from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. The amended law, which seemed narrowly written to stop the case against Mr. Bush, would give prosecutors discretion to reject lawsuits brought by non-Belgians against officials in democratic countries.

us,'Of Paradise and Power'," It is time to stop pretending that Europeans and Americans share a common view of the world, or even that they occupy the same world. On the all-important question of power-the efficacy of power, the morality of power, the desirability of power-American and European perspectives are diverging. Europe is turning away from power, or to put it a little differently, it is moving beyond power into a self-contained world of laws and rules and transnational negotiation and cooperation. It is entering a post-historical paradise of peace and relative prosperity, the realization of Immanuel Kant's ""perpetual peace."" Meanwhile, the United States remains mired in history, exercising power in an anarchic Hobbesian world where international laws and rules are unreliable, and where true security and the defense and promotion of a liberal order still depend on the possession and use of military might. That is why on major strategic and international questions today, Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus: They agree on little and understand one another less and less. And this state of affairs is not transitory-the product of one American election or one catastrophic event. The reasons for the transatlantic divide are deep, long in development, and likely to endure. When it comes to setting national priorities, determining threats, defining challenges, and fashioning and implementing foreign and defense policies, the United States and Europe have parted ways.

us,Inside the Seams at Paramount,"Although Edith Head was Hollywood's top costume designer for a half-century and won eight Oscars, she was ''wary of people who had the talent she thought she lacked.'' In EDITH HEAD: The Life and Times of Hollywood's Celebrated Costume Designer (HarperCollins, $29.95), David Chierichetti suggests that Head's success was due more to her shrewd political skills than to her artistic gifts: ''Often Head didn't use a creative new design idea for fear it might get in the way of her main goals: keeping everybody happy and keeping herself permanently employed in a very unpredictable business.'' But even as Chierichetti, a film historian, details much about the professional aspects of his subject's life, the notoriously private woman remains a cipher; as Ginger Rogers said, ''I knew Edith Head personally but it took a very long time for me to gain that privilege.'' The bulk of Head's career was spent at Paramount, where, over 44 years, she created costumes for everyone from Barbara Stanwyck and Veronica Lake to Joan Fontaine and Grace Kelly. Having achieved a level of celebrity rare for anyone other than a star or director, Head transferred to Universal in 1967, where she ultimately became a figurehead who waved at the visiting tour groups and settled for a vastly reduced salary. Although Chierichetti befriended Head for the last 12 years of her life (she died in 1981, at the age of 84), he proves less effective at capturing Head's personality than at providing an insider's view of the studio system from a costumer's perspective. The book's most interesting anecdotes concern the designers' need to compensate for any number of physical flaws in famous beauties like Bette Davis, Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn.
