After all, youre tough and you go into the hospital when you receive a physical wound.

For example, one of those I mention in the column is al-Ghizzawi, a Libyan who is suffering from extreme health problems. The authorities boasted of giving him glasses.

In the main greenhouse, rickety tables hidden among plants form the setting for the chef Skye Gyngells lunch-only cafe, with an inspired menu featuring local and seasonal ingredients. (Reservations are mandatory.) A nearby toolshed has been converted into the teahouse, an inviting space for a cup of coffee, tea cakes or a bowl of soup served with Poilne bread and farmhouse butter  the best way to battle the perpetually damp London air.

With more people retiring and a smaller share of people working, the strains on Social Security and especially Medicare will become evident. Over the very long term, the two programs combined are projected to consume virtually the entire federal budget. A portion of Medicare (the part that pays hospital bills) faces insolvency much sooner than that  in 2019.

Alvaro is from the Cibao Valley in the Dominican Republic, uneducated, living in Washington Heights with his wife and children, keeping a filthy studio in Inwood where he sleeps with mistresses and whores. Eugene is from an Italian-American family, well born, college educated, estranged from his father. Alvaro speaks only Cibaeo, virtually incomprehensible to natives of the other Spanish-speaking countries in the Caribbean; Eugene speaks English and Italian. The friends are unable to communicate, and yet they converse feelingly, or at least they think they do. Alvaro is writing a novel that he asks Eugene to translate, and Eugene believes that he is able to capture the essence of the story, even without knowing the language. ",2008-05-04T04:00:00+0000

It was a particularly low moment in Chinas national self-esteem, and what appalled Lu Xun most was the passivity of the Chinese spectators. The people, he later wrote, of a weak, backward country, even though they may enjoy sturdy health, can only serve as the senseless material of and audience for public executions. Convinced that art could goad his compatriots toward spiritual transformation, he presented them in his first story, The Diary of a Madman, as hypocritical cannibals. His later work abounded in such pitiless depictions, inaugurating a modern Chinese literature marked by what the critic C. T. Hsia called an obsessive concern with China as a nation afflicted with a spiritual disease and therefore unable to strengthen itself or change its set ways of inhumanity. ",2008-05-04T04:00:00+0000

In that book as in this one, Horwitz assumes the pose of a baby-boomer Everyman, overschooled but undereducated. He is chagrined at the basic historical facts he was once taught but can no longer remember or, worse, never knew to begin with.

For me, its the opposite of a large production, says the man whos orchestrated everything from the Mets Costume Institute gala to the Plaza Hotels coming Grand Reopening Celebration and other intimate soirees. In either case, he first creates what he calls imaginary architecture, using torches, hurricane lanterns on pillars or lights strung in trees to make guests feel safe. Next he chooses one color element. Constancy is where we derive our power image, he notes. Can Monn purchase power among the offerings of CB2, Crate and Barrels cheap-and-cheerful offshoot? No problem. He quickly struck upon his color: Live chartreuse green  or Olivine, in CB2-speak  which works outdoors as a continuation of what the eyes are already seeing. In fact, he liked the textures and ease offered by CB2 so much, guests at one of the three beach weddings hes organizing this summer should keep a (green) eye out.

Speaking directly to the audience, she nearly howls in rage at the idiotic phrases of comfort offered to her. (Everything happens for a reason.) Ms. Maxwells compelling, unsentimental performance is the centerpiece of Anton Dudleys Substitution, but its strength is matched by Kieran Campions portrayal of Paul, a young substitute teacher who knew the mothers son, Calvin.

In an e-mail message Curtis notified lawyers that ESPN did not have a license to use the painting and was committing willful copyright infringement, the lawsuit said. Court documents said that the painting was shown full screen in the second episode, Team in Turmoil, and that the series had since been sold in DVD and VHS format. Lawyers for ESPN did not immediately return calls seeking comment. The painting, one of more than 300 created by Rockwell for The Saturday Evening Post, first appeared in the April 23, 1949, issue and was donated to the National Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y.",2008-05-05T04:00:00+0000

Two years of DNA research has determined that none of the remains billed as those of the poet and playwright were actually his, The Associated Press reported, citing MDR television. In 1826, 21 years after Schiller died in Weimar, Germany, and was buried in a common grave in Jacobs Cemetery, it was decided that he needed a new resting place, Frstengruft Cemetery. The mayor, Carl Leberecht Schwabe, a Schiller fan, decided that of the 23 skulls exhumed from the common grave, the biggest must have been Schillers. A skeleton believed to be a match was put together with the skull, and everything was buried anew in 1827, to be joined in 1832 by Schillers friend Goethe, who was interred alongside him, above. About 60,000 people visit the site annually. Researchers later unearthed two other skulls said to be Schillers. But none of them were supported by DNA from the remains of two Schiller sisters and two sons. Hellmut Seemann, president of the Foundation of Weimar Classics, which oversees the Schiller archives and exhibitions, said he believed the remains were probably still in the Jacobs Cemetery.",2008-05-05T04:00:00+0000

The concert  with the Artis Piano Quartet performing works by Mozart, Brahms and Paul Juon  took place in a 500-seat government-run cultural center in Riyadh on Friday night and touched off speculation that Saudi Arabia was seeking greater openness. The concert is a sign that things are changing rapidly here, said the German ambassador, Jrgen Krieghoff, whose embassy sponsored the concert as part of the inaugural German Cultural Weeks in Saudi Arabia. Evidently the government has decided that a minimum of openness in our new world economy and in our information-based world is necessary for us and also for good understanding among cultures. The quartets Japanese pianist, Hiroko Atsumi, said there had been some discussion about whether she should perform in an abaya, the enveloping black cloak women must wear in public.

And then Jazzfest is over and Im headed back to New York, where Indian gangs dont vow to set your flag on fire over a tambourine beat and theres not a brass-band gig somewhere every night of the week.

In a post on the site, the bands leader, Trent Reznor, said, Thank you for your continued and loyal support over the years  this ones on me. The album, which became available for download early Monday morning, seems to be the first time a superstar act has distributed an entire album free, without an option for fans to pay. Two months ago the band issued the instrumental album Ghosts I-IV, allowing fans to obtain a portion of it free or the entire recording for $5. Before that the British rock act Radiohead offered its 2007 album, In Rainbows, online with a tip-jar-style setup in which buyers could name their price, including nothing. The Slip could serve as a test of how the easy availability of free music online affects later CD sales and other money-making opportunities. The Slip will not be sold on CD or vinyl until at least July. But the free digital version could stoke interest for Nine Inch Nails recently announced concert tour. Not everyone seems convinced that such giveaways will be more than a promotional gimmick.

The film contends that Franco (thats his statue below, in Santander, Spain), bought votes by dispatching music and television executives to other countries in Europe to purchase the rights to series that were never broadcast and to sign obscure acts. Jos Mara Iigo, a Spanish public television journalist, told the documentary that the Franco regime had a great need to win recognition, even if it was only in one area. In 1968 the winner of the Eurovision contest was determined by a jury from each participating country. The winner is now chosen by votes cast by telephone and text message from television viewers. Informed of the content of the documentary, Mr. Richard told The Guardian of London, Ive lived with this No. 2 thing for so many years, it would be wonderful if someone official from the contest turned around and said, Cliff, you won that darn thing after all.

He continues to contend that CBS violated his contract by failing to give him sufficient work after removing him as anchor of CBS Evening News in March 2005. In the new filing, made in State Supreme Court on Wednesday, Mr. Rather argues that his subsequent efforts to secure a job with ABC, NBC or CNN  he says he met with executives of each in 2006  went nowhere, at least partly because of the damage done to his reputation by CBS. Mr. Rathers career at CBS was upended after he served as the correspondent on a 2004 report for the weekday edition of 60 Minutes that purported to raise new questions of favoritism in the Vietnam-era National Guard service of President Bush. The network later said it could not verify the documents on which the report had been based. While the judge, Ira Gammerman, said last month that Mr. Rather could continue to pursue a claim against CBS that his contract was breached, he rebuffed Mr. Rathers efforts to collect damages from Sumner M.

Befriending her fellow patient Roy Walker (Lee Pace), a movie stuntman with busted legs and a cracked spirit, Alexandra sits enthralled as Roy relates an epic tale of colorful heroes seeking revenge on the nefarious Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone).

The Lifetime Achievement award went to a refreshing choice: Charles Harrison, an industrial designer at Sears, Roebuck & Company for over three decades and one of the first African-Americans in his field. Other winners, however, made you wonder. Pentagram partner Michael Bierut deserved his Design Mind award, and Tom Kundig his Architecture Design award, but it would have been nice if they had been recognized before they became megastars. And giving awards to mainstream firms, like Rockwell Group for Interior Design, does little to encourage young, edgy designers to submit their work, even if theyre nominated. But maybe the general public will be more adventurous than the NDA jury: The Peoples Design Award, in which anyone can vote for their favorite design, will be announced on October 23rd.",2008-05-09T08:07:00+0000

us,Witness to an Afghan Suicide Bombing,"(Photo: Stephen Dupont/Contact Press Images)  See a Slide Show. Warning: Some readers might find the images disturbing.  Two days after the April 27 assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, the photojournalist Stephen Dupont and the writer Paul Rafael, both Australian, were traveling with an opium eradication team in eastern Afghanistans Nangarhar Province when a suicide bomber attacked their convoy. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed at least 15 and wounded 14. Both journalists were among the injured; Mr. Dupont suffered minor injuries to his head, and Mr. Rafael serious ones.  Afghanistan is again expected to have a bumper poppy crop this year, and Afghan eradication teams like the one they were traveling with have come under increasing attack from the Taliban or other armed groups, who use the profits from the opium trade to fuel the insurgency against American and NATO forces. The following is an account of the attack by Mr. Dupont, who was working for Contact Press Images and on assignment for Smithsonian magazine, at the time. You can view a slide show of images taken by Mr. Dupont before and after the attack.  That morning we set off from Jalalabad in a convoy of about eight vehicles, green Ford pickups and one small truck with 50 to 60 laborers. About 40 minutes later we came to a small town, Khogyani. The truck in front of us pulled up to the gate of a police barracks. We were at the edge of the town, the police buildings facing fields in a desert valley below.   We stopped. The driver and the commanding officer got out, and everyone started jumping off the back of the flatbed, all the police meeting each other. Paul and I waited in the truck. We had the windows down and were smoking, talking, when I heard a huge bang. Then I saw black. I still dont know if it was smoke or if I actually blacked out.   When I could see again, I got out of the car and I ran. My instinct led me away. I heard gunfire. Some Afghans were running and I ran with them. We took cover behind a mound of dirt 30 or 40 yards away. Blood poured down my face. I didnt know how badly I was wounded, and I started asking people could they tell me if I was O.K.  Crouched with me was an Afghan cameraman and some police officers. Then I looked toward the vehicles, 20 yards from where the bomb had gone off, and I saw six or seven bodies. Thats the first time I knew that people had been wounded or killed. I started to move toward the bodies, and then after 10 or 20 seconds, I thought, Wheres Paul?   I headed back to our vehicle. Paul was still in his seat, his right side completely covered in blood, but he seemed coherent. I spoke to him, saying, Youre O.K., and things like that. He didnt say anything. All around people were shredded like minced meat, mangled bodies missing heads, legs and arms. I didnt see many wounded. I remember one guy alive sitting among all these bodies. I think it made an impression just because he was alive in this mess. I started taking pictures. I felt I was taking pictures of evidence.   Eventually, the Americans, who were from the 173rd Airborne Brigade and incredibly hospitable, gave us a medevac flight to Bagram Air Base, outside Kabul. Paul is here, too. Hes got five holes in the back of his head, two the size of golf balls. Theres a bone fragment stuck inside one. They dont know if its his or somebody elses. They think it may be pushing up against his brain, affecting his vision. Ive talked to him and he seems O.K., except for the vision and not hearing from his right ear. They think he may have punctured his eardrum.   -- STEPHEN DUPONT ",2008-05-09T23:36:14+0000

No painters made the shortlist of four artists. The nominees were sculptors and visual artists: Runa Islam, Goshka Macuga, Cathy Wilkes and Mark Leckey. Mr. Leckey features cartoon characters in his work, Ms. Wilkes uses shop mannequins in many of her installations, Ms. Islam recreates cult movie scenes, and Ms. Macuga draws inspiration from the German horror film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Anticipating a hostile or derisive response from critics and newspapers, Stephen Deuchar, director of Tate Britain in London and chairman of this years Turner jury, said: This is art made by people for people. What is vital about the Turner Prize is that it creates informed debate about art. People are not frightened to argue about its merits and demerits. The Turner Prize, open to British artists under 50, carries a top prize of $49,000. Each runner-up receives $9,740. Work by the shortlisted artists will be exhibited at Tate Britain beginning Sept. 30. The winner will be announced there on Dec. 1.",2008-05-14T04:00:00+0000

But he had since heard the harrowing stories of the prison's past: how so many prisoners were kept in some cells that half of them had to stand while the other half slept; how they were fed one meal a day of soup, rice or lentils, and a piece of bread; how guards extorted protection money from prisoners and their families; how Saddam's son Qusay, the secret-police chief, would stop by and order a thousand executions because he felt like it; how prisoners were bolted to the floor and hung from the rafters, subjected to electric shocks, and beaten until they might feel lucky to be killed. McCotter had explored the death house  the torture chambers and cells for the condemned within earshot of the clanging iron trapdoors of the gallows. His interpreters had read to him the last words of prayer and despair scratched into those cell walls, and one day, while inspecting work at the prison, he had been summoned to the gate because an American reporter was there accompanying four Iraqis who had their own desperate plea.

us,National Endowment Salutes Opera,"The United States government is honoring opera. The National Endowment for the Arts announced Tuesday that it was establishing yearly Opera Honors awards and named the first four recipients (right, from top): James Levine, the Metropolitan Operas music director; the soprano Leontyne Price; the composer Carlisle Floyd; and Richard Gaddes, general director of the Santa Fe Opera. Each receives a $25,000 prize. To put that $100,000 in context, the endowment is giving $2.5 million in direct opera grants this year and $7 million in other classical music grants, according to Dana Gioia, its chairman. Total grants to the arts are $72 million, with another $48 million sent to state arts councils to make their own allocations. Mr. Gioia said the awards have an enormous symbolic value and were established in part to stir awareness and appreciation of opera. While $25,000 could mean a lot more to a struggling singer, say, than to Mr. Levine, who may make more than that for a guest conducting engagement, Mr. Gioia called the prize a lifetime achievement award. If the N.E.A. opera award is going to have credibility, he added, it has to recognize artists that work at the highest reaches of the art and to create, as it were, a hall of fame of American opera artists. It would be remiss, I think, not to start with the very best.",2008-05-14T04:00:00+0000

The Forest Service has argued that the contracts help pay for clearing underbrush and other fire-prevention programs. Environmental groups, backed by Attorney General Jerry Brown, said the approved plans failed to protect the spotted owl and other scarce species. In calling for a temporary halt to logging, the court said cutting timber could irreparably damage vital habitat and in turn sensitive species. ",2008-05-15T04:00:00+0000

Imagine, if you will, the poppy Italian sportswear company setting up an enormous temporary shop, and a series of giant, fantastical installations by artists like Moebius, Glenn Barr, tattooist Angelique Houtkamp and Junko Mizuno, featuring lip-synching models dressed up in bedazzled denim mermaid bikinis, trapeze artists and a winged male dancer in tighty whities trapped in a cage. There were thousands of assembled Euros to take it all in, mostly Fornarinas best customers and sales associates (ie, more Italians in France since the Italians ceded Sardinia in 1860). They were shopping up a storm, dancing to music by Aurore LeBlanc, and generally making way more noise than a museum-adjunct space should ever be forced to endure. Things got even louder with the appearance of Lindsay Lohan, who let slip that shes the new face of Fornarina come Spring 09. (The trendy, clubby label and the clubgoer who never saw a flippy party dress she didnt like are a good match if you ask us.) For any of you looking for dirt, we hate to disappoint you: Lohan was on time, well-behaved and all in all quite professional  though she was indeed wearing leggings. In fact, she confirmed that she is going ahead with producing her own line, called 6126 after Marilyn Monroes birthday, and admitted it was a retort to the many Internet critics who jeer at her for her leggings habit. Intermix has picked 6126 up, and perhaps there will be more design coming from Lohan. Maybe a handbag, she said. Lets see how it goes.",2008-05-15T16:28:02+0000

us,Voices and Visions,"Last time I blogged, I was about to go into the studio and see what snakes came flying out of my mouth, so to speak. No snakes this time. Just one little verse of the song ""Pale Cowboy."" It's a very restrained verse, kind of formal-feeling, which fits its subject.  If your friend is an orchid then you are a rose. Upright and thorny against your horizon. Still solitary with all petals closed. In the heat when the heart's desert sun is arising.        I wrestled with myself for a while about whether the word ""heat"" should be ""cool."" After all, flowers open in the warmth and stay closed in the coolness. And if the sun is arising in this person's heart, then it is morning, and morning tends to be cool, not warm, so that's why the petals are closed. Well, it will be hotter later and that's when the petals will be open, probably. So there is an expectation set up in the song.  When I talk about ""morning,"" I am talking about this person's age and experience  if his lifetime is one day, he would be approaching the noontime of it. Well, now that I think about it he would be approaching the afternoon of it  he is a young man but still past 30. As I said, not someone I know well. So I think ""heat"" is O.K., and it sounds better next to ""heart."" Which is important.  The guitar part is tricky and I have to practice it. I had Britt, my engineer, repeat it three times so we could see how long the finished song might be. And so that I could figure out, does it need a bridge? Maybe a section that would become a real chorus? You should know that this clip is not here just for your entertainment but to illustrate the problems I am wrestling with -- that's why I left it as it is, and didn't just fade it out -- so you can hear what I am doing in real time.  (Photo: Suzanne Vega and Britt Myers in the studio recently. (Photo: Brittany Barney))   So the main image in this song is that he is a ""rose."" Most songs begin for me with an image of some kind in my mind. A man is a flower in this case. If you have an image in your mind, what is another word for that? Some people might call it a vision. It is usually some kind of metaphor, which I feel reveals a deeper truth. You can say a man is just a man, but if you say he is like a rose, that gives you an idea of what kind of man he might be. Thorny and fragile. And the other man, his friend, is an orchid -- open-petaled, exotic, more of a hothouse flower.  I had a cat whose name was Cow. And that gives you an idea of what kind of cat she was  fat with black spots. I had to defend myself once against a couple of Italian journalists who demanded to know, Why do you always lie in your songs? You are not a small blue thing. What is all of this about a queen and a soldier? Why don't you say what you mean? Well, I say what I mean, but sometimes I am attempting to write something that I see in a world beyond this one, and the metaphor is the way to get there.  Many times a song will begin with a clear image in my mind, but sometimes a song can begin with a melody popping into your head. How does it come? On an instrument? With a voice? On something unearthly that is neither, maybe. It could be a clear voice that says, for example, ""Men in a war, if they've lost a limb, still feel that limb as they did before."" I heard that line clearly in my mind and it sounded like a voice to me.   But voices and visions are scary to admit to. And also you have to make time for them, or they go on to someone else.

They were being trapped as part of a federal and state effort to protect endangered Chinook salmon. Wildlife officials are authorized to permanently remove, and in some cases kill, California sea lions that had been previously tagged for feeding at the dam. One of the six that died was a tagged animal. Officials initially believed that the animals had been shot in the cages but later determined that they died from heat exhaustion. For reasons that remain unclear, gates on the cages, shown covered above, had closed unexpectedly, preventing the sea lions from cooling off in the water. ",2008-05-16T04:00:00+0000

The Art Newspaper, which reported the incident, called it one of the most serious handling accidents known to have occurred in a U.K. museum in living memory.

Sixty-four and unmarried, Addison lives near the beach with her housekeeper and her dachshunds in a sprawling, Hitchcockian mansion called Wits End (one, but not the only, justification for the books title). The house, which would make a fine up-coast annex to Disneyland, is littered with cutesy-macabre dollhouses  on a bedside table, in a kitchen corner, by the sink, on a shelf  each a meticulous replica of a murder scene from one of Addisons detective novels. Every diorama comes with a miniature corpse, wee props (a toy blue convertible, a cummerbund the size of a twist-tie, a lipstick slightly larger than a grain of rice), right down to its tiny clues and tiny gore. Addison likes to entertain her friends or fans (theres no difference  everyone she knows is obsessed with her genius and possesses an exhaustive mental concordance of her oeuvre) by sharing personal anecdotes; ruminating on admirers of her fictional detective, Maxwell Lane; and fulminating on Bush-era politics.

A fresher wound came in 2001, when Naipaul omitted any mention of Trinidad from his initial press release after winning the Nobel Prize, which many here saw as a deliberate rebuff. And last year, during a visit sponsored by the University of the West Indies, Naipaul more than lived up to his reputation for cantankerousness, prompting disapproving press coverage after he snapped at a group of students at a Hindu girls high school.

Osterie dItalia, from Slow Food Italy, recommends restaurants, organized geographically, with a snail icon to indicate that they follow Slow Food principles. If you like nonna-in-the-cucina places, its worth the weight. Another Italian bible, Ristoranti dItalia del Gambero Rosso, groups restaurants, trattorias and wine bars regionally. A numerical score is based on a 100-point scale, and a meter indicates value for your money. But the most important symbols are the forks (for restaurants) and shrimps (for wine bars): if you see a place with three, go. In France, Carnet de Route Omnivore is for anyone serious about 21st-century French cuisine. The annual book lists 200 experimental restaurants and highlights the best dish at each (under the heading Le Plat qui Change Tout). Accompanying recommendations of nearby hotels are a bonus.

But if the scenery comes out of Edward Hopper, complete with the aura of loneliness and of ordinary things made strange by odd slants of light, the people who live there are nothing like Hoppers doughy American depressives. Theyre characters from Eastern European folk tales or Kafka, boiling with energy, nicely poised between the comic and the sinister and prone to metamorphosis: an opera singer keeps a monkey dressed in baby clothes, a woman turned into a black cat / and I ran after you on all fours. Even Grandmother  and Simics poems are full of grandmothers  knitted / With a ball of black yarn.

K. Rowling, the BBC reported. Known as the Tayside Tragedian, McGonagall, above, who spent much of his life in Dundee as a weaver in the jute mills, did not take up poetry until he was 47. He specialized in subjects like Scottish battles and Queen Victorias golden jubilee, as well as death and catastrophe. At his readings in Dundee, he was often scorned, and audiences were fond of throwing eggs and vegetables at him. Perhaps his best-known poem dealt with the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879 and included the lines So the train movd slowly along the Bridge of Tay/Until it was about midway,/Then the central girders with a crash gave way/And down went the train and passengers into the Tay.

It turns out the ink wasnt very stubborn and the paintings had enough varnish to keep the ink from seeping below the surface, Brian Szott, curator of art at the Minnesota Historical Society, said of the vandalism the students are believed to have inflicted on three portraits of governors. Marks were also drawn across the mouths of Elmer L. Andersen and Harold LeVander. Initial estimates suggested the vandalism would require restoration, costing several thousand dollars. In fact, the repairs cost $175. It took an hour and a mild solvent to remove the ink from the paintings. An investigation is focusing on students from Eastview High School in Apple Valley. Mr. Ventura, a former professional wrestler, called the act despicable. A fine and community service are the likely penalties for a misdemeanor of this type, said James Backstrom, the county attorney for Dakota County. ",2008-05-21T04:00:00+0000

Kendall Sharp gave Mr. Pearlman an unusual incentive to pay back his investors, offering to reduce the sentence by one month for every $1 million he repays. Mr. Pearlman, 53, pleaded guilty in March to charges of conspiracy and money laundering in connection with a Ponzi scheme in which he used fake accounting documents to lure people to invest in two companies that existed only on paper. Mr. Pearlman fled the country early last year, once federal authorities began investigating him, and in June he was found at a hotel in Bali, registered under the name A. Incognito Johnson. Larry Rifken, a lawyer representing victims of the schemes, said in a statement: The Creditors Committee is delighted with Judge Sharps ruling today on Mr. Pearlmans sentence and believes that Judge Sharp did an excellent job in maximizing Mr. Pearlmans incentive to cooperate with the Trustee and the Committee in identifying, locating and monetizing any remaining undisclosed assets.",2008-05-22T04:00:00+0000

us,"Celebrating an Engineering Marvel, Born in Tragedy"," The 125th anniversary of the Brooklyn Bridge is being marked with a series of celebrations, starting with a concert and lighting ceremony Thursday night. (Photo: Chang W. Lee/The New York Times) See the Slide Show  The Brooklyn Bridge: a marvel of engineering, or a death trap? Both, within the first week of its opening.  The  opening of the Brooklyn Bridge [pdf] on May 24, 1883, was a joyous occasion with ""two great cities united."" That 125th anniversary is being marked with a series of celebrations over the holiday weekend. But few remember that the bridge's public debut was marred days later by  a stampede [pdf] in which a dozen people were crushed to death, and 35 others injured. The May 30 mayhem was exacerbated by a false rumor that the bridge was going to collapse.  The traffic that surged onto the Brooklyn bridge as soon as it opened was overwhelming and dominated by pedestrians who were charged one cent to pass. There was room for 15,000 people on the footpaths at any one time (though overcrowding sometimes drove it to as high as 20,000).  On the second day, there was ""a crush of foot passengers from 11 o'clock in the morning to 7 o'clock at night."" The pedestrians ""collected at the entrance, compressed themselves into a funnel about 15 feet in width and then ran the gantlet, one by one, of the tolltakers.""  Until then, to cross the river, people had to take the ferry.  With subways now, it is rare to see such vast crowds on foot on the bridge, except in emergencies like Sept. 11 and blackouts.  The dense flow of people over the bridge made it fertile ground for pickpockets (newspaper accounts talk about a lot of men discovering that they were missing watches) and other hazards. Six days after the opening, the deadly stampede occurred.  According to the most commonly accepted account, one cited by The New-York Times, the stampede started when a woman fell down the wooden steps on the Manhattan side, and another woman screamed (perhaps because she saw the woman being dragged by a police office officer who had sprung to her aid)  But another version of the events, cited by The New York Tribune, and considered more credible by The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, starts with a German man descending the steps when a pickpocket tried to steal his watch. His wife screamed, and the thief's accomplices started yelling that the bridge was going to collapse, leading to a rumor-induced panic.  ""Agonizing!"" read the lead headine from The Eagle, which devoted an extra to the panic. It also highlighted ""The Stairway that Led to Death.""  As The Times described at the time [pdf]:  Those on the promenade above the stairway,knowing nothing of the fearful crush on the steps, surged ahead with irresistible force, and in a moment the whole stairway was packed with dead and dying men, women and children, piled upon another in a writhing, struggling mass. Cries, shrieks, yells, and groans filled the air at the stairway, while those on the promenade above yelled and shouted as they were pushed forward and rolled and tumbled over the poor unfortunates who were being crushed and trampled to death beneath them.  The situation was made worse by ""a gang of New York toughs"" who formed a dense line by putting their arms on each other's shoulders and charged.  The police officers on duty didn't have the ability to shut off the bridge on the other side. So for some time, the crowd kept pouring onto the bridge even as people were getting crushed on the other end. Officers were eventually stationed in the middle of the bridge to turn people back.  To relieve the strain of people, a bridge employee found a chisel and a hammer nearby and hammered at iron bolts and nuts until he broke away a section of the iron fence to relieve the crush. Also wood planks were laid so people could walk over the fence.  The Times reported the injuries in graphic detail [pdf]:  The first rescuers to reach the spot found the dead and dying wedged together in the narrow space as if they had fastened in a vise. So tightly were they packed and squeezed that from dozens of persons blood was oozing from ears and noses. The bodies were piled four or five deep at the foot of the stairway and most of those at the bottom were women.  The Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote, ""The sight was one that was never equaled for horror."" The dead were laid in a row, their faces covered with hats or another article of clothing.  After the bodies and the crowds were cleared, all that was left was bloodstains on the steps, mens and women's hats, umbrellas and parasols, and a thousand steel pens lost by a peddler. But the clean-up was relatively speedy. As the Times described at the time [pdf]:  An hour after the disaster the only evidence that anything unusual had occurred at the stairway was the opening in the iron railing where a section of the latter was torn away in order that bodies might be more quickly taken from the mass in the stairway.  Among the proposals to advert future disasters: tripling the police force on the bridge, accelerating the plans for a telephone connection from one end of the bridge to another, and removing the stairs in favor of an inclined plane.  And of course, lawsuits were filed against the bridge trustees.  (Photo:  A bird's-eye view of fireworks at the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883. (The Metropolitan Museum of Art))   Anniversary Events The Brooklyn Bridge lights will be turned on from 9 to 11 p.m. each night through Memorial Day. The celebrations and observances include lectures, dances, performances, a film series presented at the foot of the bridge, information tents, guided tours, and more.

To allow the decision to take effect before then risks legal havoc and uncertainty of immensurable magnitude, the brief read. Shannon P. Minter, the legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, which argued the original same-sex marriage case before the court, called the filing desperate. Were very confident the court will reject their motions, Mr. Minter said. The court ruled on May 15 that two state laws defining marriage as between men and women were unconstitutional.

And in the former Czech leader Vaclav Havels case, return to his roots on the stage. Mr. Havels first new play in 20 years opened in the Archa Theater in Prague on Thursday. The play, Odchazeni (Leaving), is about a chancellor who must re-adjust to civilian life and the loss of power after being forced out by his former deputy. (Mr. Havel, now 71, whose last presidential term ended in 2003, has said he wrote most of the play before taking office.) It alludes to King Lear and The Cherry Orchard but has some postmodern touches: the playwright himself appears in a recorded voice-over. The play received mostly positive reviews in the Czech press. But this highly anticipated absurdist comedy was marred by some personal drama when Mr. Havels wife, Dagmar Havlova, who he said helped inspire the work, was barred from performing in it. The National Theater of Prague, which was originally scheduled to stage it, cited a policy against guest actors in rejecting Ms. Havlova for a role written for her. Mr. Havel responded by shopping the show to other theaters; citing health problems, Ms. Havlova eventually dropped out of the production altogether shortly before it opened at the Archa. In September the play is scheduled to run at the Orange Tree Theater in London.",2008-05-24T04:00:00+0000

America is in trouble! The only insights into the administrations wrongdoings are the investigative and analytical reporting of the media.Thank you to the reporters Nina Bernstein and David Barstow, to David McCraw, a vice president and assistant general counsel for The Times, and to you. Robert PalmerCastro Valley, Calif., May 11, 2008  Re The Preachers New Pulpit (May 4):I strongly disagree with you on the question of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. and The Timess coverage of his recent public and television appearances.I felt that the issue was covered ad nauseam everywhere and ran 24/7 on cable news channels. Yes, it was news, but it became the dominant news of the week at the expense of other more important stories.I appreciate that The Times showed some restraint while still covering the story well.Elizabeth KilroyNew York, May 5, 2008 Your column about the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. scandal should have also noted the failure of The Times to discuss the anti-American and outrageous statements of many men of the cloth, such as, but not limited to, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the Rev. Pat Robertson, Rev. John C. Hagee and even the Rev. Billy Graham.While The Times has provided article after article about Mr. Wright (and Senator Barack Obama), theres been far less coverage of the other reverends who have made similar statements. In the Week in Review of May 4, we read about the fiery theology of black preachers, with no mention of the many other (white) preachers who have said far worse.Where is the balance?Vicki G. CheikesBoca Raton, Fla., May 6, 2008 I was interested in the difference between the coverage of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. in the paper and on The Caucus blog on the Web site.Perhaps you are right, and The Times should have reported more on the content of Mr. Wrights recent speeches in the paper. But nothing substantial in the speeches had not been reported before, and nothing in them was not being reported endlessly on cable news. It seems that the story really was that Mr. Wright was saying these things again, which to me came through in the reporting in the paper.The Caucus blog, however, was all Wright all the time for at least three days that week. It was infuriating.The content of Mr. Wrights speeches is available on television and on the Internet. How much of this do you want to put on the front page? The Wright story represents a great distraction from real issues, and it is entirely media-generated. Now, the media are a story, but they are becoming the main story. And thats not good.Christopher WilsonMadison, Wis., May 4, 2008 While I very much appreciate your column about the papers coverage of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., The Times was hardly the first or only media outlet not to cover Mr. Wright in a proper sense. I dont see why what Mr. Wright says in his crazy rants should be given the news attention that it has been given.What kind of impact will that have on the issues of the day? Does his hateful comments help a family with their bills, or help get us out of Iraq?I am a realist and know the news media will cover him because of his ties to Senator Barack Obama, though for the reasons I just stated, I wish it werent so.Steven M.

And as big as the lake of gold was, it must be only a drop drawn from the sea of the larger fortune  the traveler's imagination could not begin to grasp the size of that mother-ocean! Nor were there guards at the golden water's edge; was the king so generous, then, that he allowed all his subjects, and perhaps even strangers and visitors like the traveler himself, without hindrance to draw up liquid bounty from the lake? That would indeed be a prince among men, a veritable Prester John, whose lost kingdom of song and fable contained impossible wonders. Perhaps (the traveler surmised) the fountain of eternal youth lay within the city walls  perhaps even the legendary doorway to Paradise on Earth was somewhere close at hand?

We took a gamble on a show that was a departure for public radio, a little bit edgier, Melinda Ward, P.R.I.s senior vice president for content, said in an interview. Unfortunately, the program didnt catch fire fast enough, broadly enough to attract underwriting. The program, which mixed newsmaker interviews and pop culture, was heard on about 25 stations, including WNYC-AM in New York, and had about 140,000 weekly listeners on average, P.R.I. said. Ms. Salie, 37, a former Rhodes Scholar and actress with a relaxed, often irreverent approach, called the show experience wildly fulfilling. Noting that P.R.I. hired me to get a hipper, younger audience for public radio, she said, I think public radio is smart to recognize it needs to innovate in order to survive, and I hope that it will continue to actually allow for innovation rather than just recognize the need for it. P.R.I. is exploring continuing Fair Game online; the shows listeners downloaded about 100,000 podcasts each month, Ms. Ward said.

The support shown here for Mr. Wen is consistent with the outpouring of approval that can be found elsewhere on the Web, including Facebook and sites on the Chinese blogosphere. Readers response to the Communist Party was generally tempered, with neither heavy criticism nor praise for the governments management of the earthquake and its handling of the news media.

While the high court has yet to decide if it will hear Bells appeal, it issued a notice to both the company and its disgruntled bondholders indicating that June 17 is available for a hearing and setting a rapid timetable for filings. A Quebec appeals court sided with bondholders last week because Bell had not considered the impact of the buyout on their holdings. The buyout will add about 30 billion Canadian dollars (about the same in United States funds) in debt to the company, depressing the value of current bonds. Bell asked the court to rule by June 30, the closing date for the deal. The bondholders, in a separate court filing on Monday, rejected that idea and suggested that Bell and the buyout group, led by the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, should simply make the closing date later rather than expect the court to rush its decision.

You were close enough so that you could get home, but not so close that you would have people bothering you all the time.When Mattingly, who played his entire career with the Yankees, was asked if he ever came close to playing for the Chicago Cubs, he said that he had not. Then Mattingly laughed and added, Well, not that I know of.As Mattingly and Manager Joe Torre drove to Wrigley on Monday, he told Torre that he had never seen the Friendly Confines. The Yankees played here in 2003, but Mattingly, who lives in Evansville, Ind., did not became a Yankees coach until 2004.Mattingly was supposed to be the Dodgers batting coach, but he assumed a lesser role so he could be home with Jordon, his youngest son. Mattingly and his wife, Kim, filed for divorce last November. Jordon is in high school.Although Joe Girardi beat out Mattingly for the Yankees manager position, Mattingly said he still wanted to manage. Mattingly said he would renew his quest once his family situation was stabilized.

us,Restoration Row,"(Photo: A bison in Theodore Roosevelt National Park, in North Dakota. (Credit: Dan Koeck for The New York Times)) PAWHUSKA, Okla.  It is hard to love a land you don't understand, and for most of my life I had no idea why anyone would ever live in the Great Plains  let alone love the place.   Flat, featureless, boring. Those were the words I heard growing up whenever someone would mention the plains. My view was informed by Dorothy's Kansas, which looked scary and Gothic even before the twister took her house and Toto, too.  But then I spent some time here, mostly listening to people in the twilight of their lives tell about the land when it turned on them, during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. At the end of a long day of hearing stories, I would go for a run in the wind, and sometimes get a glimpse of the magic of the place  a pronghorn antelope in a sprint, a sky blushing pink, the quiet when the air finally settles.   There are people with us still who remember the Great Plains in its birthday suit, grass as far as the eye could see, what Walt Whitman called, ""that delicate miracle, the ever-recurring grass.""   That land is gone to us, now. Once, the grassland in our midsection spanned at least 14 states, from Minnesota to Texas, the second biggest ecosystem in North America. It's gone because the grass was overturned and the bison were chased off the land and the riot of biodiversity that evolved over 10,000 years was replaced by a few commodity crops to feed us.   It's not worth arguing over whether this was a good or a bad thing, because most of the intentions were good, even if the excesses were bad. But it's always worthwhile to wonder whether humans can fix what they screwed up.   And here, just north of this little town in Osage Indian country, I saw some evidence that the land can be healed. I saw shaggy-headed bison and their calves, several thousand of them, in a setting that was neither park nor zoo. I saw grass stretching almost to the horizon, flowering in parts, combed by the wind. I saw the sun dip behind the lilt of the Flint Hills, closing out a day with a burst of color.   This miracle of restoration is the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, nearly 40,000 acres run by the Nature Conservancy. It is the largest protected remnant of tallgrass prairie left on earth, according the stewards of this land  cowboys with advanced botany degrees.   The conservancy bought this land in 1989 and then set out to bring it back. The two biggest missing elements  fire and bison  were returned. Both renew the grass, distribute seeds, and keep the carpet of big bluestem, wild rye and other species healthy.   The result is somewhat astonishing. Over 300 species of forbs, grasses and flowers are here. And while this preserve is just a patch, an anchored Noah's Ark of what used to cover much of the continent, it says something about restoration. Bit by bit, maybe some of what we lost can be brought back.   I say this at a time when nearly all commercial salmon fishing has been halted on the West Coast. What used to be a rite of the season  a taste of the wild, spring Chinook returning to the Columbia River, the richest salmon on earth  is almost a memory this year.   But look also at bald eagles that fly in all 50 states, a byproduct of strong laws and far-sighted bird lovers. From my house in a metro area of nearly 3 million people, I can see a pair of nesting bald eagles.   We restore things to the wild, and in time, they return the favor. Think of Nick Adams, the psychically wounded veteran coming home to the nurturing water in Hemingway's ""Big Two-Hearted River.""   So even with the sky here in Oklahoma rumbling and clacking, menaced by twisters rolling down Tornado Alley, there is just enough of the original plains at the Tallgrass Preserve to make flatland believers out of skeptics.   You can see in the remains of a day the reason why people who came here a hundred years ago were so lonely  and, also, why they fell in love with the place.    ",2008-05-29T02:08:11+0000

This time, the words were not from his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., but rather from a Catholic priest who was mocking Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.  During a guest appearance last Sunday at Trinity United Church of Christ, the Rev. Michael Pfleger delivered a blistering critique of Mrs. Clintons candidacy. Mr. Pfleger, a wellknown activist Chicago priest and a friend of Mr. Obama, said Mrs. Clinton felt entitled to the presidency and was stunned by a black man stealing my show.  The remarks from Mr. Pfleger first appeared on several blogs in Chicago on Thursday, accompanied by a You Tube video of his words to the congregation.    When Hillary was crying, and people said that was put on  I really dont believe it was put on, Mr. Pfleger said. I really believe that she just always thought this is mine. Im Bills wife, Im white and this is mine. I just gotta get up and step into the plate. And then, out of nowhere, came Hey, Im Barack Obama. And she said, Oh, damn. Where did you come from? Im white. Im entitled. Theres a black man stealing my show.  In his next breath, Mr. Pfleger wipes his face and mocks Mrs. Clintons tears, saying: She wasnt the only one crying. There was a whole lot of white people crying.  Before he stepped away from the pulpit of Mr. Obamas church that has been under intense scrutiny, he added: Im sorry. I dont want to get you in any more trouble.  Mr. Obama, through a statement released to reporters, said he was deeply disappointed.  As I have traveled this country, Ive been impressed by not what divides us, but by all that that unites us, Mr. Obama said. That is why I am deeply disappointed in Father Pflegers divisive, backward-looking rhetoric, which doesnt reflect the country I see or the desire of people across America to come together in common cause.  Mr. Pfleger, who is the pastor of Saint Sabina Catholic Church in Chicago, a largely black congregation, said he regretted the words he preached last Sunday.  These words are inconsistent with Senator Obama's life and message, and I am deeply sorry if they offended Senator Clinton or anyone else who saw them, he said in a statement released to reporters by his church.  Mr. Obama was not present during the remarks on Sunday. Since he began distancing himself from his longtime pastor about two months ago, he has not attended services at Trinity United Church of Christ on Chicagos South Side.  Howard Wolfson, a chief spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said the remarks were unacceptable and called on Mr. Obama to more forcefully reject the comments.  Divisive and hateful language like that is totally counterproductive in our efforts to bring our party together and have no place at the pulpit or in our politics, Mr. Wolfson said Thursday evening. We are disappointed that Senator Obama didn't specifically reject Fathers Pfleglers despicable comments about Senator Clinton, and assume he will do so. ",2008-05-30T00:43:02+0000
