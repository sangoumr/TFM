The Pier 17 complex, part of the Howard Hughes Corporations development at the South Street Seaport, is a fine example of that. Surrounded by promenades with views across the East River to Brooklyn, its rooftop, open year-round, has a collection of cabana-like pods set on patches of faux lawn for dining and drinking throughout the day. There are 28 of them, each accommodating up to eight people, to be reserved in advance. Theyre equipped with umbrellas, lounge chairs, coolers and USB ports, and you can order from your smartphone. The pods require reservations; two other areas, a north patio and south patio, are first-come, first-served. The menu for the entire rooftop consists of fruity cocktails, some of them slushy, and food like fish and chips, organic chicken sandwiches, and salmon and squash kebabs. On the piers ground level, one restaurant, Malibu Farm, will open for outdoor dining on Thursday. The Fulton by Jean-Georges Vongerichten is opening soon, along with David Changs Momofuku Ssam Bar, moving into the Bar Wayo space. Another restaurant on the pier, Carne Mare from Andrew Carmellini, which was supposed to make its debut in April, has yet to announce an opening date. ",2020-08-04T16:35:38+0000

us,The Designer Bringing Traditional Persian Fabrics to British Mens Wear,"This past January, during mens fashion week in London, the designer Paria Farzaneh invited guests to an East London boys school for an Iranian wedding. A bride sat onstage in a traditional white lace gown before a banquet of Persian pastries and urns overflowing with pastel-colored roses and babys breath. The groom, seated next to her, wore a paisley-printed ski jacket, its high, mouth-covering neck pre-empting the protective masks of the pandemic. An older community leader in a black suit presided over the faux ceremony in Farsi, as the viewers sat divided by gender  men on one side of the aisle, women on the other, though the men outnumbered the women and ended up infringing on their section. This was a deliberate move on Farzanehs part intended to highlight the power imbalance she feels in her industry  where a woman truly at the helm of her own brand is still something of a rarity  and was typical of the subtle gestures toward the tensions of our present moment that are embedded in her line. At the end of the ceremony, the groom rose and strode down the aisle, followed by a procession of young men dressed in looks from the fall 2020 collection of Farzanehs namesake line, which combined the swagger and oversize silhouettes of streetwear with the understated, earthy palette of hand-printed Iranian textiles.",2020-08-10T11:00:25+0000

us,The Designer Who Gives Her Pieces Minds of Their Own,"As a girl, the furniture designer and artist Elizabeth Garouste had a profound fear of the furnishings and objects in her home, in Pariss Montparnasse neighborhood. I always thought that things around the house would furtively move themselves, that they had their own souls, she says in her native French. Garouste was born into a Jewish family in 1946, just after World War II ended, and had a grandmother who didnt mince words when it came to describing the recent atrocities. I transferred a kind of terror onto everything, Garouste reflects, and, really, I may have decided to make furniture as a means of taming those items that I grew up with. Her primary aim for the pieces she now creates is to endow each with a buoyant personality.",2020-08-10T11:00:26+0000

Thirteen years ago, while working as the director of arts and culture at the British Council in India, Cicolini traveled to Mehrangarh, a resplendent 15th-century fort and series of palaces with an accompanying museum in Jodhpur. Among the collection of courtly textiles, armory and miniature paintings, a maharani jewelry box caught her eye. It would have housed many of the things you need to perform solah shringar, she explains, referring to the ancient Hindu practice of a bride on her wedding day wearing 16 traditional adornments, from bell-embellished anklets to glass and gold bangles. The box itself was fairly ordinary looking, but the idea of what its contents constituted was magic to me.",2020-08-10T11:00:26+0000

The recipes vary from simple (avocado toast and variations from Bluestone Lane) to complex (Gabriel Kreuthers tarte flambe, with hen-of-the-woods mushrooms). The presentation is inconsistent. Some recipes give ingredients in grams, others in cups, evidence of minimal editorial intervention.

Currently the most reliable way to identify a coronavirus infection is by a polymerase chain reaction (P.C.R.) test: A swab, usually taken from the nasal passage, produces a sample that is then sent to a specialized laboratory. P.C.R. tests, which can detect minute amounts of genetic material from the virus, cost upward of $100; in ideal circumstances, they take just hours to analyze. But because of high demand, supply shortages and other issues, many commercial labs are taking more than a week to process them. That means a positive test often comes back too late to enable contact tracers to notify those who have been exposed before they might in turn infect others. In these circumstances, the diagnosis is useful only for making personal health decisions and providing data on the rate of infection in a community.",2020-08-20T09:00:01+0000

Then theres Louis Vuittons signature monogram canvas, with its interlaced L and V flanked by various geometric flowers, which seems to be another thing entirely, one impervious to trends and maybe even time itself. In fact, the monogram hasnt always been around, nor does it date to the houses founding in 1854, when Louis Vuitton, who had previously been a packer for Empress Eugnie, the wife of Napoleon III, began selling travel trunks out of a store on Pariss Rue Neuve-des-Capucines, just off Place Vendme. His go-to motif was a waterproof gray canvas. The monogram came into existence just over four decades later, when Louiss son, Georges, took inspiration from the kitchen tiles of the familys home in Asnires in north-central France. The house, built in 1859, was decorated in the Art Nouveau style, and the tile pattern featured a trio of flowers outlined by a clover that was in turn set within a circle, as well as diamonds with petal-like points. Another reference may have been the Gothic Revival then sweeping through France  when seen through that lens, the monogram cant help but recall architectural quatrefoils carved out of stone or glass in the eras great cathedrals.

Lee was a Confederate general, a slave owner and a commander in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War.

More than a third of these monuments have been removed since May 25 of this year alone, when a Minnesota police officer named Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with second-degree murder, was caught on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, for more than eight minutes while Floyd pleaded for his life.

Chapo Guzmn, the world-famous drug lord, had hired a young IT guy and the kid had built him a sophisticated system of high-end cell phones and secret servers, all of it ingeniously encrypted. The unconfirmed reportperhaps that was the best way to describe ithad arrived that Friday in June 2009 when a tipster walked into the lobby of the FBIs field division office in New York. After his story had been vetted downstairs, it made its way up seven flights of stairs and landed with a curious thud among the crowded cubicles of C-23, the Latin American drug squad. For more than thirty years, the elite team of agents and their bosses had hunted some of the drug trades biggest criminals, and while tall tales of their antics circulated constantly through its squad room near the courts in Lower Manhattan, no one in the unit knew what to make of this one. The tipsters account seemed credible enough but it was sorely lacking details: the only facts he had offered on the young technician were a first nameChristianand that he was from Medelln, Colombia. All sorts of kooks spouting all sorts of nonsense showed up all the time at FBI facilities, claiming they had inside information on the Kennedy killing or knew someone who knew someone who knew where Jimmy Hoffa was. In what were still the early days of Internet telephony, it seemed a bit far-fetched that a twentysomething hacker had reached a deal with the worlds most wanted fugitive and furnished him in hiding with a private form of Skype.

Probably the top kid-lepidopterist in Champaign County, in his own humble opinion. At night his bones ached and added marrow, and each morning his limbs felt more sinewy and masculine, as if hed somehow entered the body of Davy Crockett. Or Daniel Boone.
