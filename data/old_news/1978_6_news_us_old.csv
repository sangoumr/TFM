us,Film: Mizoguchi's 'A Geisha':A Rediscovery,"TO the extent that any Japanese film directors can be well known in this country, Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu have made it. Yet Kenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1958 and who may well be one of the greatest film makers of all time, remains relatively obscure, even to those audiences for whom such obscurity is usually a certification of honor.Kurosawa had the luck to make a couple of films that found comparatively large American audiences (""Rashomon,"" ""Seven Samurai"") while Ozu, though not as well known as Kurosawa, became something of a small fashion early in the decade with the release of many of his later films.To date, fewer than 10 Mizoguchi works have received commercial engagements in New York, and though each has been critically acclaimed, especially ""Ugetsu,"" ""Sansho The Bailiff"" and ""Utamaro and His Five Women,"" there's never been a continuing Mizoguchi audience. Every time we receive a new-old Mizoguchi, he must be rediscovered.Mizoguchi's ""A Geisha,"" which is having its New York theatrical premiere today at the Film Forum, was made in 1953. Unlike most of the other Mizoguchis we've seen here, it is set in its own time, 1953, in Kyoto, though it shares with the director's period films the quality of being incredibly beautiful without being particularly, foolishly pretty.The story is about the friendship of two women, Miyoharu (Michiyo Korgure), an older geisha bound by a tradition that no longer holds, and Eiko (Ayako Wakao), a 16-year-old girl whom Miyoharu agrees to sponsor and train as a geisha after the death of Eiko's mother, a former geisha who'd been Miyoharu's friend???. Though Mizoguchi's film makes only two quick trips outside Kyoto's tea houses and geisha houses, the film is as much about the social revolution taking place in 1953 occupied Japan as it is about the emotional relationship between the two women.From the beginning, it's apparent that the young Eiko is not going to be a conventional, subservient geisha. After a class in which the teacher has told her pupils that the geisha is a work of art, like Noh drama and the tea ceremony, Eiko wonders whether the new Japanese constitution doesn't guarantee a geisha the right to say no to a patron. The other young women giggle, but Eiko is serious.It's evidence of the system of balances that always operate in a Mizoguchi film that as Eiko is wondering about the geisha's constitutional rights, the geisha's role is being corrupted. In postwar Japan, the geisha, who had once been a highly skilled entertainer, was being called upon with increasing frequency to perform the duties of the not necessarily skilled prostitute.It's a trend that the older Miyoharu resists, more or less passively, while Eiko does battle. When her would-be patron takes the two women on a trip to Tokyo, Eiko refuses to perform the duties she does in the teahouse. ""I serve at parties,"" she says. ""I'm a lady.""This doesn't put off the man. He makes a lunge at her??? wrestles h???r to the floor, plants a big kiss on her mouth, to which Eiko responds by biting his lip so badly the fellow has to be hospitalized. Because of the scandal, the two women are blackballed by all of Kyoto's teahouses. Miyoharu is confused, worried, though she doesn't blame the younger woman. Says Eiko, in effect, ""If that's what being a geisha means, then I don't want it.""The charm of ""A Geisha"" is the compassionate but completely unsentimental way it regards the two women's friendship, as well as the manner in which this friendship changes and deepens as their responsibilities, each to the other are acknowledged. Miyoharu is much the more interesting of the two, but it is the younger Eiko who is more often right.Though the landscape of the film is restricted to a small, rather exotic quarter in Kyoto, ""A Geisha"" is far from esoteri???. The scope is narrow and the focus is deep.The two actresses who dominate the film are splendid, as are several other performers, especially Chieko Naniwa, who plays the not unkind but money-minded doyenne of Kyoto's geishas, and Eitaro Shindo, who plays Eiko's father.""A Geisha"" is actually a remake, being based on a film Mr. Mizoguchi made in 1936 that, to my knowledge, has never been released here, yet the 1953 version is far from being dated. One can say that the best, most intelligent film about women to be seen here in the last 12 months was a film made 25 years ago.""A Geisha"" will be screened at the Film Forum tonight through Sunday at 7:45 and next Thursday through Sunday at the same time.",1978-06-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Capricorn One',"DAWN. Various shots of a huge missile on the launching pad at Cape Canaveral, Fla. Cut to spectators watching from several miles away. Cut to the Houston Mission Control Centeryou've seen it dozens of times on television and in the movies. Real or fake, it always looks the samepeople intensely busy as they monitor complex computers, television screens flash incomprehensible data, and scientists drink coffee from paper cups. On the soundtrack we hear the voice of a radio announcer give the solemn details of what was eaten at breakfast by the three astronauts who begin their journey to Mars this day.The sequence lasts perhaps 10 minutes, and it's very promising. It's funny. It's accurate in all those banalities we know and love. Then, however, ""Capricorn One,"" an expensive stylistically bankrupt suspense melodrama, gets down to its real narrative.This is the story of a United States Mars landing, faked by apparently several hundred thousand employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, because the mission's life-support system is faulty, but to scratch the mission would mean the end of the nation's space program. Or so says Hal Holbrook, who plays the mission's director, as he tries to convince usas well as the mission's three astronauts, who've been removed from their space capsule at the last minutethat the plot we're about to ??? is not a piece of ???cheesecloth.Plots of movies like ""Capricorn One,"" which was written and directed by Peter Hyams, don't have to be flameproof, and they don't even have to carry water, only a tiny bit of conviction and??? more important, wit. In addition to its overture. ""Capricorn One"" has two decent sequencesa runaway??? interlude, which has been done much more funnily by people like Buster Keaton and W. C. Fields, and a final ???chase involving two wicked helicopters and a nice, old-fashioned biplane, the sort of machine that is to aircraft what Labrador retrievers are to dogs. Lovab'e and always reliable.The stuff that comes in between is humorless comic-strip stuff about a conspiracy so widespread that you finally realize that the only people in the country who don't know about it are the three astronauts, a minor space employee, one unreliable television reporter, an eccentric crop-duster, owner of the lovable biplane, and the members of their immediate families.Such complicity reduces the problems for the screenwriter so that, as Mr. Hyams does, he can have the good guys arbitrarily confounded by the bad for as long as it is convenient. No explanations are needed.At movies like this I tend to regress. I'm once again 16 years old when I was quick to point out to adults all those contradictions they'd learned to ignore. For example, how are the three astronauts spirited away from Cape Canaveral in a jet while at least a million people in the immediate vicinity are watching? Why is a medallion, used by one of the astronauts to slip the hinge in their desert prison, later found by the nosy reporter some yards away on the Mars television ""set,"" which has been used to fake the television coverage of the Mars landing? Why . . . but does anyone care?I don't, which is unusual because I am??? by nature, ready to disbelieve everything from religious prophesies to time schedules printed in movie ads.The cast for this nonsense includes Elliott Gould, as the reporter, the fellow who stumbles on what someone must call ""the story of the century:"" Karen Black, as his sometime girlfriend: James Brolin, Sam Waterston and O. J. Simpson, as the astronauts, whose lives are endangered in inverse relation to the billing they receive: Brenda Vaccaro??? ??? Mr. Brolin's wife: Telly Savalas, as the crop-duster, and David Huddleston, as a United States Senator. If I didn't know they were actors I might suspect they'd originated on a drawing board.It should be noted, I think, that ""Capricorn One"" is another ""presentation"" by Britain's tireless show-business entrepreneur Lew Grade, who has recently given us such other exercises in conspiracy as ""The Domino Principle,"" ""The Cassandra Crossing"" and ""Voyage of the Damned,"" all entertainments of a strikingly similar, mingy order.""Capricorn One."" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"".) has some mildly vulgar language, but it offends only common sense. Its a G-rated movie in disguise.",1978-06-02T05:00:00+0000

When the old fellow dies, his nephew Jerome (Victor Lanoux), who used to play childhood games with Maria, returns to collect his legacy. Imagine his surprise when he learns that the legacythe house, the Rolls-Royce, the fortune, everythinghas been left to the servant. Maria, a maid who always wanted to be a lady, agrees that Jerome may stay on in the mansion on her terms, that is, if he becomes her servant.Thus begins, more or less, ""Servant and Mistress,"" a first feature film by Bruno Gantillon, a French director with a good deal of style but not much on his mind. The film opens today at the Columbia II.""Servant and Mistress"" might possibly have been a funny film, but Mr. Gantillon takes his fancy sado-masochism quite seriously. Jerome hangs around the mansion accepting the various humiliations that Maria heaps on him. He serves her breakfast in bed. He washes the floors. He picks up purposely dropped napkins and observes her having sex with another man, all in the fond hope that one day she'll tire of the game and revert to their earlier relationship.Butare you really ready for this?he begins to fall in love with her. However, poor Maria, who dearly loves Jerome, knows she can never be a real lady (or, at least, I think that's whather conclusion is), and so these escalating humiliations must come to a sad, freeze-frame ending.""Servant and Mistress"" is the sort of deadly earnest, crashingly irrelevant romantic melodrama that the French are inclined to take much more seriously than we do, perhaps because they recognize in its artificialities a relationship to a kind of French boulevard comedy that's never been very popular here. ""Servant and Mistress"" is not comedy by any means, but it has more to do with manners than with ideas, characters, life or even sex.Miss Ferreol (""La Grande Bouffe"") and Mr. Lanoux (""Cousin, Cousine""), both of whom are in much more trim shape than they were in those earlier films, are performers of wit whenever the screenplay allows, which isn't, often. Mostly they move through the movie like Siamese fighting fish in water that's begun to freeze. They are elegant but sluggish.",1978-06-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Jorge Semprun's 'Woman at Her Window':Angles of Love,"THE place is Greece and the year is 1936. We see three people photographed on a cliff against a magnificent panorama of arid mountains. The air is so clear it seems to have been dry-cleaned. Margot (Romy Schneider) is beautiful and dreamily serene, like someone who's been smoking marijuana. Raoul (Philippe Noiret) is shaped like a bowling pin and ill-tempered, but he's impeccably dressed. Michel (Victor Lanoux) is handsome, self-assured and patronizing in the manner of a man with a higher calling.Though they stand far enough apart to be playing catch, they talk about history, politics and literature as earnestly as three people huddled around a tiny cafe table.Michel is a Greek Communist on the run from his country's new Fascist Government. Raoul, a French capitalist??? is in love with Margot, and Margot, who is married to Rico (not in this scene), an Italian diplomat, is in the process of falling in love with Michel.Thus starts ""A Woman at Her Window,"" a French political melodrama with heavily romantic overtones written by Jorge Semprun??? the Spanish-born French writer who has done much, much better things (""La Guerre Est Finie,"" ""Z,"" ""State of Siege""), and directed by Pierre Granier-Deferre, who has done one somewhat better thing that I know of (Georges Simenon's ""The Cat"").The film, which opens today at the Festival Theater, is a muddle of big ideas??? mysticism and cinematic posing. It's the story of how Margotrich and so completely wrinkle-free it's ???erie  is redeemed from her life of idleness by a chance meeting wi??? Michel, who climbs into her first-floor Athens window one night when fleeing the police (hence tha poetic title).Margot's husband, Rico (Umberto Orsini), is a perfectly nice??? attractive fellow. He has a sense of humor. He's kind. He cares about her, but for reasons never explained adequately??? theirs is a marriage in what once used to be termed ""name only."" They are good friends but he has his mistresses and she's kept busy being the toast of Athens.As you might guess, the time in which the film is set is important. The old European order is collapsing into two opposing camps on the eve of first the Spanish Civil War and then World War II. Margot's redemptionher love for the Communist organizer and, through him, commitment to the radical Leftis, I suspect, supposed to tell us something about the inexorable movement of civilizations, about history.Mostly??? though??? it tells us how easily a bored woman can be swept off her feet even when the language of love is hack work. Surveying the ruins of an ancient temple, Michel says, ""We build for men, not go???s,"" and Margot goes absolutely limp. When Margot has the temerity to wonder aloud why she loves him. Michel answers in complete confidence. ""There's something in me greater than myself.""""A Woman at Her Window"" jumps around in time for no apparent reason other than to simulate the building of suspense. Part of the film has to do with the faithful Raoul and Ri???'s helping Margot to get Michel safely out of Greece, but there also we jumps forward to 1945 and then to 1967, when Miss Schneider turns up as her own daughter.Even with all of this hopping around the most interesting things in Mr. Semprun's screenplay inevitably happen o???f-screen. It's left to messengers of one sort and another to tell us exactly how Michel escaped, how Margot eventually joined him, how they became very important in resistance movements, and how Rico at last sickened of working for Musso???ni and sought exile in France.There's a lot of pretty Greek scene??? in ""A Woman at Her Window"" but so little action it could have been a stage piece. As l've already indicated??? ???the talk, at least as rendered by the subtitles, is not great, especially when Margot, early in their relationship, comes on to Michel saying in a manner meant to be inviting, ""You wanted to know . . . the taste of my mouth?""Miss Schneider is incapable of registering any emotion except pleasure in her own beauty. Mr. Lanoux also gives the impression of intense??? self-absorption. Only Mr. Orsini and Mr. Noiret seem real, but the movie is interested in them only as props necessary to th??? great romance that is the film's ??? low center.",1978-06-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Damien Back in 'Omen II':'Born Unto a Jackel',"WHEN we took our leave of him at the end of ""The Omen,"" Damien, the cherubic-looking Antichrist, come to earth to claim his rights, was 6 years old and in attendance at the state funeral of his father and mother, the recently deceased United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James's and Mrs. Thorn. Holding the hand of the President throughout the ceremony, Damien did not fidget. Apparently fidgets are not something to which a child ""born unto a jackal"" is subject.At the start of ""DamienOmen II,"" the inevitable sequel, we leap seven years into the future when Damien, now 13 and played by round-faced Jonathan Scott-Taylor, is living near Chicago with his uncle, Richard Thorn (William Holden), Richard's wife, Ann (Lee Grant), and his cousin Mark (Lucas Donat) in the sort of suburban splendor that only multimillions can buy in the Middle West: a 50-year-old, mock French chateau and more liveried servants than you're likely to find at Buckingham Palace.To all outward appearances Damien is, if not the Antichrist, then at least an Antichrist. He rarely smiles, and when he does it's a sneer. He's rude to his ancient aunt. He smokes cigarettes if he can get them and, when crossed by a schoolmate, all he has to do is stare to send the other kid into convulsions. Yet nobody recognizes him for what he is, not even Damien himself.It's left to a sergeant at the military school attended by Damien and Mark to pass the word on to Damien. The sergeant is one of the Devil's helpers who miraculously appear from time to time to help Damien (and the movie's plot) along.""The time is coming,"" says the sergeant sternly, ""for you to put away childish things and face up to who you are.""Those of us who endured ""The Omen"" know what the sergeant means: ""You're too old to go around murdering mummies and daddies and nannies. Act your age.""One way and another Damien does, and ""DamienOmen II"" is the open-ended record of this particularwhat should I call it?rite of passage. Before Damien is finished this time, there have been approximately a dozen new victims, a couple of whom have succumbed to what appear to be internal disorders while others have been sliced in half, stabbed, burned, impaled, gassed, pecked (by a nasty crow) and, in the film's most inspired moment of cinematic nonsense, drowned beneath the clear ice of a Wisconsin lake.Perhaps my resistance has given out but I must say that ""DamienOmen II,"" though it's as foolish as the first film, is rather more fun to watch and sometimes very stylish-looking. Much of the movie was shot in and around Chicago, which, in winter, with its extraordinary architecture, must be one of the handsomest of American citiesso handsome, in fact, that the movie-makers haven't hesitated to let Chicago's railroad yards double for those in New York when the need arises.""Damien"" does have some trouble getting its seasons straight. Though the story covers approximately nine months, the leaves on the trees suggest a perpetual autumn with occasional bouts of winter.The winter scenes, filmed in Wisconsin, are spectacularly beautiful, and work in a subliminal way to make us accept the not uncomic absurdities of the screenplay, written by Stanley Mann and Michael Hodges. Because Mr. Hodges began as the film's director, but was later replaced by Don Taylor (""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" ""Tom Sawyer""'), I've no idea who is responsible for the movie's classy look.A cast of good actors helps, of course. Mr. Holden and Miss Grant play it straight, with nice assistance from Mr. Scott-Taylor, Mr. Donat, Sylvia Sidney, Lew Aires and several actors new to me, Robert Foxworth, Elizabeth Shepherd and Lance Hendriksen.I'd hate to have anyone go off to see ""Damien"" with the idea that it's going to be some sort of transcendental experience. It's a joke, but as such jokes go, it's much funnier than ""The Fury,"" and quite as shrewd in its Grand Guignol special effects.",1978-06-09T05:00:00+0000

The nonprofit business research organization said that in May its index of consumer confidence  based on a survey of 5,000 households  fell to 28.5, down from 96.9 in April, the fourth consecutive decline. The cause for all that pessimism: inflation.... Some of the concern about the prospects for prices may have been reflected in May's newcar sales. Domestic auto makers posted a hefty 11.1 percent increase over yearearlier levels, while sales of imports dropped 14 percent. Analysts suspect that consumers are buying now to avoid paying a higher price later. ... Those same fears also clouded the latest word on consumer elebt, which expanded by the second largest amount on record, according to the Federal Reserve Board.

us,"'Bonjour Amour,' a French Film About First Love, at the Cinema 2:The Cast","If you can't wait to see another French film about first love, then rush over to the Cinema 2 where ""Bonjour Amour"" opens today. It might not be there long.The film is about Marc (Pascal Meynler), a boy of unspecified teen age and the sweet, presumably older 17-year-old shopgirl, Martine (Guilhaine Dubos), with whom he shares first love's joys, sorrows, discoveries and other cliches, until they are separated by his boorish, lower middle-class parents.There's nothing stunningly wrong with the movie except a lack of apparent talent, which is as fatal to a movie about first love as it would be in the counterfeiting of $20 bills. Roger Andrieux, the director, obviously means the film, called ""L'Amour en Herbe"" (Budding Love) in France, to be tender and sensitive. It is, instead, trivial and humorless. Watching it is like waiting for a subway with nothing to read.The performances are adequate, though Mr. Meynier appears to be not only very young but slightly stunted. Everybody in the movie seems to be bigger than he is.",1978-06-11T05:00:00+0000

Last week he unveiled his new water policy. It won cautious praise from two contending forces environmentalists who oppose many projects as costly and destructive, and Western governors who see them as the key to their prosperity. The environmentalists are pleased that new criteria will make future boondoggles more difficult. The governors are relieved that the policy will have scant effect on $20 billion worth of projects already under construction, such as those on last year's hit list.

So, after a season or two of hard play, the inside of your favorite mitt won't dry up, crack or rot away because of perspiration.

Later, after Albert's lover has found a new driver, Stella is showing another palazzo and finds Albert camping in it. She invites him to stay on the sofa of her comfortable apartment.He stays for good, and soon the comfortable mess is no more. Because Albert is a homosexual, you see, he likes to cook, vacuum, fluff pillows and hang up Stella's clothes.The Gay Activists' Alliance has circulated a letter expressing alarm about ""A Different Story,"" and, indeed, the group has a point.Albert, thinking himself very clever, tells Stella at dinner one night ""Yes I have, several and not particularly,"" in answer to three questions he anticipates her asking. (""Have I ever been with a woman, how many, and did I like it?"") But Stella turns out to be a lesbian, so she isn't nearly as shocked by this as Albert expects her to be. Albert and Stella don't appear to remain homosexual for long: they marry, have a baby, buy a Mercedes, move into a big house with too much wallpaper, and squabble just as other couples do.The movie's use of their homosexuality is indeed exploitative, insensitive, and offensive in a variety of ways. Even worse, it is unconvincing. For all of Mr. King's mincing, preening and complaining about how Miss Foster's tardiness has made him scorch their dinner, Albert's homosexuality is nothing but a gimmick, something for the screenplay to coax him out of. Mr. King makes Albert so unattractive that it's hard to care about his taking the cure.Mr. King is much worse than the movie, which is no mean accomplishment Miss Foster is much better, with an aggressive vitality that lets her upstage Mr. King at every turn. But her talents are continually undercut by the direction of Paul Aaron, who makes the kind of debut that ought to be a swan song. Mr. Aaron's ineptitude knows no bounds, especially when it comes to blasting an insufferable score, ending scenes at uninteresting moments, and making the film's chronology completely obscure. After a while, the only way to mark time is by counting Albert's divine little dinners.The film's notion of reversing sex roles is not without comic potential. But there's something quite ugly about its manner of accepting sexual stereotypes in the first place, just for the sake of shuffling them around.",1978-06-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Another Snap of 'Jaws':The Great White Redux,"UNTIL great white sharks learn how to fly or use automatic weapons or develop their powers of telekinesis, it would seem that ""Jaws 2"" has pretty much exhausted the cinematic possibilities of sharks as man-eating monsters.Watching the new film, which opens at the Cinerama 1 and 2 and other theaters today and is, of course, a spin-off from the phenomenally successful 1975 movie, one quickly realizes that there's only a fixed amount of excitement that can be generated by the sight of a $2 million mechanical shark upsetting sailboats, nipping the legs of swimmers or even swallowing victims whole, without even a burp.One also longs for the talent and discipline of Steven Spielberg, who directed the original film and knows how to use a motion picture camera, something that is not at all evident in the work of Jeannot Szwarc, the young man who directed ""Jaws 2."" The screenplay, based on some of Peter Benchley's original characters, is something of an impediment, being about nothing at all except another batch of shark attacks that upset life at Amity, which is supposed to be a Long Island resort community though it often resembles Florida.A worried, ill-tempered-looking Roy Scheider reprises his role as the Amity police chief, along with Lorraine Gary as his wife and Murray Hamilton as Amity's smarmy, always-wrong mayor. Most of the rest of the cast are teenagers, young men and young women, all of whom look enough alike as to make it virtually impossible to remember which kid has been gobbled up in what sequence. Not that it matters much.Some of the action sequences have been well staged, but they've been dropped into the film so indiscriminately that ""Jaws 2"" never builds to a particular climax. It simply drones on and on and on, like a television movie.Someone also made a mistake in showing us so much of the mechanical shark so early in the film. One of the canny decisions in ""Jaws"" was the withholding of such visual information until near the end, by which time suspense had overwhelmed logic to such an extent that our imaginations were in league with the movie makers'. The shark in ""Jaws 2"" looks like something one might ride at Disneyland.""Jaw 2,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly vulgar language and a number of scenes showing children in jeopardy, but the violence is mostly implied and bloodless.",1978-06-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: A Slick Version of 'Grease':Fantasy of the 50's,"""GREASE,"" the film version of the still-running Broadway musical show, is not really the 1950's teen-age movie musical it thinks it is, but a contemporary fantasy about a 1950's teen-age musicala larger, funnier, wittier and more imaginative-than-Hollywood movie with a life that is all its own. It uses the Eisenhower era  the characters, costumes, gestures and particularly, the musicto create a time and place that have less to do with any real 50's than with a kind of show business that is both timeless and old-fashioned, both sentimental and wise. The movie, which opens today at Loews State 2 and other theaters, is also terrific fun.Because I seem to be one of the few persons who has never seen the Broadway show, I'm not sure how the movie differs from the original, yet it's apparent that the film's score, which is one of the best things about the production, has been liberally supplemented by new material and new-old material, including ""Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,"" which has never before sounded so marvelously, soaringly inane.Somewhat in the manner of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" which recalls the science-fiction films of the 50's in a manner more elegant and more benign, than anything that was ever made then, ""Grease"" is a multimillion-dollar evocation of the B-picture quickies that Sam Katzman used to turn out in the 50's (""Don't Knock the Rock,"" 1957) and that American International carried to the sea in the 1960's (""Beach Party,"" 1963).The gang at old Rydell High, which is the universe of ""Grease,"" is unlike any high school class you've ever seen except in the movies. For one thing, they're all rather long in the tooth to be playing kids who'd hang around malt shops. For another, they are loaded with the kind of talent and exuberance you don't often find very far from a musical stage. They not only portray characters but effectively make comments on them.Olivia Newton-John, the recording star in her American film debut, is simultaneously very funny and utterly charming as the film's ingnue, a demure, virginal Sandra Dee-type. She possesses true screen presence as well as a sweet, sure singing voice, while the Sandra Dee I remember had a voice that seemed to have been manufactured in Universal's speech-and-special-effects department.John Travolta, as Miss Newton-John's costar, a not-so-malevolent gang-leader, is better than he was in ""Saturday Night Fever."" I'm still not sure if he's a great actor, but he's a fine performer with the kind of energy and humor that are brought to life by the musical numbers.Stockard Channing, as the high school's tramp who has a dirty mouth and a heart of gold, would (if it were possible) stop the show twice, once with a pasty put-on of poor Olivia (""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"") and another when she attempts, in song, to explain why it's more honorable to be loose than uptight (""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"").The film's producers, Robert Stigwood and Allen Carr, and director, Rundel Kleiser (whose first theatrical feature this is), have also supplemented the cast of comparative youngsters with a whole crowd of actors we associate with the 50's, and who seem here to have survived with barely a visible dent.Eve Arden, a fixture of the 50's as Our Miss Brooks, plays Rydell High's unflappable principal; Sid Caesar is the football coach; Edd Byrnes comes on briefly as the lecherous host of a teen-age TV show that decides to spotlight Rydell in a network program; Jean Blondell is the harassed waitress at the corner soda fountain, and, maybe funniest of all, is Frankie Avalon, who appears in a dream sequence to counsel an unhappy student (""Beauty School Dropout"").Bronte Woodward has adapted the Broadway book by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, who also wrote the show's original score, in such a way that the plot serves the purpose of the music without needlessly interfering with it.It's to the director's credit that the musical numbers slip in and out of reality mostly with hugely comic effect. The highlights of the stage show include the upbeat rock number, ""We Go Together,"" and the rueful ""Summer Nights,"" both sung by Mr. Travolta and Miss Newton-John, but the hit of the film is probably a breathless new number, ""You're the One That, I Want,"" written by John Farrar and beautifully choreographed by Patricia Birch.Because there haven't been that many movie musicals recently, it doesn't mean much to say that ""Grease"" is the best we've had in years. I'm also afraid that people who (like me) have no special fondness for the 50's might be put off by the film's time and place. Let me emphasize, then, that ""Grease"" stands outside the traditions it mimics. Its sensibility is not tied to the past but to a free-wheeling, well informed, high-spirited present.""Grease,"" which has been ruled PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") has some language that would never have been heard even on Broadway in the 50's, and though it deals with teen-age lust quite frankly, it's heart is always pure.",1978-06-16T05:00:00+0000

Some of the 25yeartolife murder sentences are to run concurrently, others consecutively, but by state law Mr. Berkowitz will be, theoretically, eligible for parole after 25 years. He was transferred to Dannemora, where he underwent psychiatric examinations to see if he should serve in prison or in a facility for the criminally insane. Few criminals have been so thoroughly psychiatrically examined as Mr. Berkowitz already, and to verify that he knew what he was doing at the sentencing, one judge asked if his guilty plea had been your own, without the compulsion of the demons?

It started out as a simple, Spartan reaction to the extravagant, lascivious, pleasureloving habits of the aristocrats. But, because it frightened businessmen and drove capital out of the country, commerce and trade stagnated. To cure the stagnation, the Revolutionary Government printed paper money, the socalled assignats, issued against the security of the vast public lands confiscated from the church and the emigrant noblemen. At first the assignats got the country humming again and revived employment. But the initial success created demands for more. As more and more assignats rolled off the printing presses, prices soared and a new disease infected the French character. Speculation and gambling became epidemic; some gamblers rushed to the stock market, others to the roulette wheel. Workers loafed ; productivity lagged. Businessmen, looking for the big kill, stopped going after small gains by investing in plant and equipment or making stepbystep technical improvements. Corruption spread to government ; the public grew cynical about politicians who enriched themselves while mouthing the rhetoric of popular reform.",1978-06-18T05:00:00+0000

The first Cinerama feature had included a spectacular flight over Cairo that gave the audience not only breathtaking view but an awareness of where each major landmark stood in relation to the others.

us,Film: Boxer With Pouch:'Roo in the Ring,"""MATILDA,"" which opens today at Radio City Music Hall, is a comedy about a male kangaroo named Matilda who is the chief contender for the heavyweight boxing championship of the world.The cast is headed by Elliott Gould, as the vaudeville promoter who gives Matilda his start; Clive Revill, as a former British flyweight boxer who owns Matilda and loves him like a son, and Robert Mitchum, as a sports columnist who manipulates the news he covers and, at the end, becomes the managing editor of the New York Post.According to the film's production notes, the role of Matilda is played both by a kangaoo named Whammo and by someone named Gary Morgan in a kangaroo suit that reportedly cost $30,000 but fits as if it had been ordered by seamail from Hong Kong. Matilda looks like the neighborhood practical joker on his way to a costume party, so I assume that it's Mr. Morgan we see on the screen most of the time.Paul Gallico wrote the novel on which Albert S. Ruddy and Timothy Galfas based their screenplay, which was directed by Daniel Mann with a total lack of spontaneity and with the groveling desire to please you might associate with a door-to-door salesman.The movie is chock-a-block with un-comic jokes and facetious inspirations, including Lionel Stander as a short-tempered boxing promoter, and several scenes showing two inept Mafia ""soldiers"" trying to kidnap Matilda and then to cut off his tail. Harry Guardino, a good actor, plays the Mafia chief with no great charm.Mr. Mitchum sort of lazes his way through the movie, knowing that he's bigger than it is. Mr. Gould seems to want to disassociate himself from the picture by watching the other actors as if astonished by the fools they are making of themselves. He's right, of course, but since he's in the movie, he looks a bit foolish, too. Mr. Revill, another able actor, plays Matilda's owner in a manner that recalls David Wayne's leprechaun period, which may not be something that all of us want to recall at this very minute.""Matilda"" is a movie that's in even worse shape than the Music Hall.

In pursuit of this prize, more, than a dozen persons converge on San Francisco in 1939 to cross and double-cross one another in ""The Cheap Detective,"" Neil Simon's funny, affectionate recollection of ""The Maltese Falcon,"" with substantial references to ""Casablanca"" and more than a passing interest in ""The Big Sleep.""From that description you might suspect either that ""The Cheap Detective"" takes in more territory than can easily be evoked by one picture or that it's very thin material to sustain an entire feature-length film. Either way you may be right. ""The Cheap Detective,"" which was directed by Robert Moore and produced by Ray Stark (Mr. Simon's collaborators on ""Murder by Death""), belongs to a very special subcategory of motion picture comedy whose rules, which have the tensile strength of hot fudge, are what you want to make them.Like Mel Brooks's ""High Anxiety,"" which was a fond overview of the career of Alfred Hitchcock, ""The Cheap Detective"" is not the parody of ridicule that is most readily appreciated, but a cheerful remembrance of old movies that are as substantial today as they ever were. From time to time, ""The Cheap Detective"" seizes and wickedly shakes a remembered moment of outrageous foolishness or sentimentality, but, mostly, watching it is like being with a group of friends as they recall their favorite moviegoing experiences. It's not as a movie that it's so much fun, but as a multimillion-dollar, all-star parlor game.Starting with Peter Falk, who gives a fine, feature-length, utterly straight-faced imitation of Humphrey Bogart as a Frisco private-eye named Lou Peckinpaugh, most of the players are superbly funny. They Include Ingrid Bergman in ""Casablanca"" (described by her husband as ""a brave, beautiful, extremely boring woman""); Marsha Mason as the Gladys George character from ""The Maltese Falcon,"" perhaps the only woman in San Francisco who knows how to find an all-night dress shop specializing in widow's weeds; Madeline Kahn as the mysterious Mary Astor character, also from ""The Maltese Falcon,"" and John Houseman (wearing something that is less a suit than a special effect), Dom DeLuise and Paul Williams, as, respectively, characters who would once have been played by Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Elisha Cook Jr.Then, too, there are Nicol Williamson, as the Nazi colonel whose mission is to prevent the Free French patriot (Fernando Lamas) from opening a French restaurant in Oakland; Sid Caesar (in a fright-wig) and Ann-Margret (in virtually nothing) as mysterious Rumanians; James Coco as a cafe Impresario, and Stockard Channing as Lou Peckinpaugh's ever-faithful though never-to-be unfulfilled Girl Friday.Phil Silvers is also in the movie but he's on and off the screen so quickly that I don't really remember him. The one place where the recollections go awry is in the casting of Eileen Brennan as the Lauren Bacall figure. Miss Brennan is an able comedienne but next to the original she is small, limited. She never once recalls the amalgam of larger-than-life sexuality, intelligence, self-mockery, and class that was (and is) the unique Bacall screen presence.""The Cheap Detective,"" which opens today at the Coronet, Little Carnegie and other theaters, is more difficult to review than to talk over, as one might last night's dinner party. One wants to ignore the lapses in taste and wit as well as the lack of coherence. No particular comic point is made by setting the film in 1939, which is a year before there ever was a Free French movement, and though the movie tries very hard to reproduce the ""studio"" look of the 40's, that look is over-whelmed by vivid color photography.More Important, though, are the inspirationslarge and smallthat do work beautifully, such as Lou Peckinpaugh's undershirt, to which is still attached every laundry marker it ever knew. I also admire Mr. Simon's variations on 1940's movie dialogue, whether snappy (reports a detective to his superior, ""We got four bodies, three as cold as yesterday's toast and one ready to pop up"") or solemn (""Paul is an obstinate man. Even with a bullet in his head, his mind is made up""). And, there is no way seriously to object to a movie that has as one of its principal locations a seedy hotel called the Crusaders, which, on its first floor, houses the St. John the Divine Bar.""The Cheap Detective,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly vulgar language. The film's violence is in the nature of slapstick comedy.",1978-06-23T05:00:00+0000

They tended to play in continually shifting combinations, often using unusual groupings of instruments, and to vary their approaches to conform to the demands of each particular playing situation.

us,A Film by Beatty:A Remake of 1941,"THERE is something eerily disconnected about ""Heaven Can Wait."" It may be because in a time of comparative peace, immortality  at least in its life-after-death form  doesn't hold the fascination for us that it does when there's a war going on, as there was in 1941 when ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" was released and became such a hit. Or perhaps we are somewhat more sophisticated today (though I doubt it) and comedies about heavenly messengers and what is, in effect, a very casual kind of transubstantiation seem essentially silly.Whatever the reason, ""Heaven Can Wait,"" Warren Beatty's remake of ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan,"" gives the impression of being a swinging 1978 romantic comedy struggling to free itself from the body of the 1941 film. Most of the time it remains locked in, embraced by the unyielding requirements of its elaborate, facetious plot gimmick.This, as in ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan,"" which also was based on a play titled ""Heaven Can Wait,"" is about a professional athlete, a star quarter-back with the Los Angles Rams, who is accidentally gathered by a heavenly messenger before his time has come. When the mistake is realized, the athlete, named Joe Pendleton (Mr. Beatty), is escorted back to earth to find a suitable body to inherit so that Joe can go on to play in the Super Bowl. That, unfortunately, is just the beginning, though it takes so much screen time to tell that the audience is always ahead of it.The surprise is that ""Heaven Can Wait"" is as much fun as it is when it has to waste so much energy in the service of a gimmick that we would now endure only in a pilot film for a projected television series titled ""I Dream of Joey.""The movie, which opens today at Loews State 2 and other theaters, is a hybrid of no great style but of a good deal of charm and with a marvelous cast headed by Julie Christie, Jack Warden, Dyan Cannon, Buck Henry, James Mason and Mr. Beatty, who stars in the film, produced it, co-directed it (with Mr. Henry) and co-wrote the screenplay (with Elaine May).Only time and innate modesty, I assume, prevented him from acting as his own assistant producer.Though updated from the 40's, the May-Beatty screenplay seems to follow closely the earlier film, written by Sidney Buchman and Seton I. Miller, yet only Harry Segall, the author of the play, is given screen credit. Some of the film's best moments, however, are random inspirations of dialogue and bits of business that recall the tone of Miss May at the peak of her comic form.The film's funniest characters are not played by Mr. Beatty or Julie Christie (as the spunky English girl Joe Pendleton falls in love with). They are Joe's wife (when he is in the body of a wealthy nut named Farnsworth) and her lover, a pair of scheming, would-be murderers of the sort Miss May showed such fondness for in ""A New Leaf."" The characters are well written and beautifully played by Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin.I suspect that no one but Miss May (and possibly Buck Henry) would envision a scene in which one of the murderers, expecting at any minute to be discovered, says to his accomplice when the police are about to enter the drawing room, ""Pick up 'The Fountainhead' and pretend to be reading.""The film's associations to time are nothing if not eclectic. Memories of ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" evoke the 1930's and early 40's. ""The Fountainhead"" suggests the late 40's and early 50's. The Rams and pro football are very much of today, while the very funny populist speech that Joe Pendleton delivers (in the body of Mr. Farnsworth to a board of directors' meeting) recalls Frank Capra's comedies of the mid-30's. All of which may lead you to believe  correctly  that ""Heaven Can Wait"" hasn't much personality of its own.Instead it has a kind of earnest cheerfulness that is sometimes most winning. Mr. Beatty and Miss Christie are performers who bring to their roles the easy sort of gravity that establishes characters of import, no matter how simply they are drawn in the script. Neither James Mason as Mr. Jordan, the fellow in charge of recently gathered souls, nor Mr. Henry, as the messenger who botched his first job, have much to do, but they are presences we recognize. In a much more colorful part, that of Joe Pendleton's trainer, Jack Warden must bridge the gap between the film's sentimental impulses and its lunatic comedy, and he succeeds with ease.All of these people, though, are upstaged by a plot that keeps butting into the movie just as it's building some comic momentum. There's nothing worse than a pushy narrative.""Heaven Can Wait,"" which has been rated PC (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some language that, I suppose, could be called grown-up if not adult, but there is nothing else in the movie to disturb the smallest mind.",1978-06-28T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: Peckinpah's 'Convoy,' Open-Road Machismo:Truckers and Women","CONVOY,"" which opens today at the Criterion and other theaters, is Sam Peckinpah's multimillion-dollar ""B"" picture, the sort of movie about men who drive trailer trucks, and the women who love them, which has been made before much less expensively and much more entertainingly by directors with no aspirations to be artists. ""Convoy"" is a bad joke that backfires on the director. He has neither the guts to play the movie straight as melodrama nor the sense of humor to turn it into a kind of ""Smokey and the Bandit"" comedy.The movie is a big, costly, phony exercise in myth-making, machismo, romance-of-the-open-road nonsense and incredible self-indulgence. It takes its large cast of good actors and makes a fool of each one of them, including Kris Kristofferson, who plays a trucker whose CB radio handle is Rubber Duck, a fellow so laid-back he seems horizontal even when walking upright, and Ali MacGraw, who, for reasons that remain forever obscure, has had her hair clipped like Maria's in ""For Whom the Bell Tolls.""Miss MacGraw is supposed to be a classy society photographer, a woman of intelligence and realized sexuality, but the effect of the haircut is to make Mr. Kristofferson's girlfriend look like an exceedingly pretty boy.This may well be one of Mr. Peckinpah's more knowing sexist gags, but because the movie is so muddled or nasty in every other way, I don't feel like trying to decipher the point. To transform a naturally beautiful woman into a figure of such androgyny seems, at best, short-sighted; at worst, it's mean-spirited.That may be to credit ""Convoy"" with more consistent purpose than it has. The screenplay by B.W.L. Norton, based on C.W. McCall's song about a showdown between a group of independent truckers and the law, attempts to be both funny and serious. It asks us to admire the free spirit of the truckers who own their own rigs, who love their trucks as cowboys used to love their horses, and who represent  or so we are told  a vanishing breed of Americans whose backbone made this country great.I could buy that in earlier Peckinpah movies like ""The Wild Bunch,"" ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"" and ""Junior Bonner,"" but here the director is sending himself up but not in any healthy, good-humored way. There is a feeling of desperation about ""Convoy.""It's like finding Mr. Peckinpah as the star of a carnival sideshow. There is still talent evident, but the backbone has rotted away. Here's a fellow, you feel, with no pride, no scruples, who'd sell his grandmother for 5 percent of the gross.The movie has the form of one long, occasionally interrupted chase as the independent truckers, objecting to unrealistic speed limits and corrupt highway cops, flee across Arizona to New Mexico. There are roadside-diner brawls filmed in slow-motion, a couple of spectacular traffic violations and a lot of scenery so pretty it would tone up any post card.The supporting cast includes Ernest Borgnine as a vicious, bigoted cop; Burt Young, as a trucker who hauls pigs and fancies himself a ladies' man; Seymour Cassel, as an opportunistic and foolish state Governor, and Madge Sinclair, as a woman trucker who is black and who, maybe significantly, is the only trucker to have a major accident in the course of the film.""Convoy,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some coarse language and mildly suggestive sex scenes.",1978-06-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Films: 'The Cat From Outer Space':Feline Marvel,"THE opening scenes of ""The Cat From Outer Space,"" which opens in New York today at the Rivoli and other theaters, are a moderately amusing parody of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Deep-focus photography, flashes of light in the night, unearthly roaring and wailing, chickens squawking, a puzzled farmer with a shotgun and a Labrador retriever that sniffs the air and insouciantly returns to the house.However, we don't have to wait until the end of the film to see the visitor from another galaxy. It won't be giving anything away to say that it turns out to be a quite ordinary-looking male cat wearing a crystal collar.In Disney movies of another era, the collar would simply have been described as magical, like Cinderella's glass slipper. Nowadays it is necessary to say that the collar focuses highly developed telepathic powers. Anyhow, it enables the cat to open doors and windows, to levitate his friends, to freeze his enemies in their tracks, control remote events and, of course, to speak English and probably the language of every other country in which the film is exhibited.Naturally, the Pentagon wants the cat, who goes by the name of Jake. So does a mysterious and unquestionably villainous figure, who knows that the collar would give him control not merely of the world, as a stooge suggests, but of the universe. All Jake wants to do, at first, is to repair his comfortable little spaceship and get back to pussycat heaven, but then he falls in love.The complications begin amusingly enough, but tend to become tiresome and predictable well before the movie is over. Even so, ""The Cat From Outer Space,"" is likely to keep the under-14's amused, at least if supplemented by plenty of popcorn.The human players, led by Ken Berry, as a scientist who befriends Jake; Sandy Duncan as his colleague, friend and the owner of the feline femme fatale; McLean Stevenson, as a scientist who drinks beer and gambles, which are relatively serious failings in a Disney film, and Harry Morgan as a short-tempered general, all perform creditably.Jake, a 15-month-old Abyssinian making his screen debut, gets the best of it in front of the camera, however. He should hire out between films as a watch cat. No one could steal a scene from him, at any rate.",1978-06-30T05:00:00+0000
