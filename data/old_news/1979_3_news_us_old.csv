This is the lowest professional typewriter ever produced, Mr. Bellini continued. I've tried to stay away from the mechanical look and to give the machine as flat a profile as possible. Instead of having a movable keyboard or golfball typing element, the machine contains a series of electronic modules and a daisy wheel printer that can be changed to offer four type sizes. The machine operates quietly; can reverse type (white on black), has a multilingual capacity, can retype prestored information (addresses, form letters), and can print character by character, line by line or word by word. The keyboard, Mr. Bellini added, is a rich and concentrated piece, and includes normal typewriter keyboard, with additional functions placed either to its right or left. The machine's other surfaces have been kept as uncluttered as possible. Is there any reason for the typewriter's matte black finish? I was told Americans love charcoal black, Mr. Bellini said, half smiling. But seriously, I think that black is very professional color, will make the machine compatible with many different working environments and is the best choice for visually reducing its volume.

us,Screen: Albert Brooks Turns 'Real Life' Into Movie:Family is the Lens,"ALBERT BROOKS explains, at the beginning of his drily funny first film, ""Real Life,"" that his idea was to ""depict day-to-day living in contemporary America and at the same time hold a motion-picture audience spellbound."" Clearly, this wasn't going to be easy, nor would it be easy for his film to contemplate reality, because that, he admits proudly throughout the film, is a subject about which he knows absolutely nothing. But as it turns out, Mr. Brooks's ignorance is his secret weapon. And ""Real Life"" is his often very witty assault on manners, moviemaking, an allegedly typical American family and everything its members hold dear.""Real Life"" follows the adventures of a crew of film makers and scientists, commanded by Mr. Brooks, as they isolate a model family in Phoenix and proceed, in the interests of cinma vrit, to pester these people mercilessly, and invade their privacy in a variety of colorful ways. Its manner is deadpan and sly, so sly that some viewers may not find it comic at all. But for anyone well-disposed toward Mr. Brooks, who is never without his absolute insincerity and irrational good cheer, ""Real Life"" is full of delightful nonsense, a very funny account of one man's crusade to capture all the truth and wisdom that money can buy.Mr. Brooks is at his most droll as he outlines his project at the beginning of the film. Demonstrating an amusing fondness for anything that smacks of science, he explains how a computer has studied potential subjects and come up with ""digital readouts of screen presence."" There has also been testing for a ""charisma factor,"" and development of a lot of fancy new cameras. ""Quiet. Efficient. Expensive."" says Mr. Brooks, bursting with hilarious and perfectly idiotic pride.Once the right family is chosen  a husband and wife played by Charles Grodin and Frances Lee McCain, and their two listless children  Mr. Brooks and his crew go to work, filming their subjects from odd, unflattering angles and never allowing them a moment's peace. When the wife visits her gynecologist, the film crew visits too  although Mr. Brooks, whose special forte is false reassurance, guarantees her that ""I won't film anything that'll embarrass you. I couldn't use it anyway, I'm locked into a PG.""Even so, the gynecologist is furious, not over an invasion of his patient's privacy, but because he has ""had some bad experiences with the '60 Minutes' people."" Mr. Brooks looks quite unsurprised by this news. The signal quality of his world view is that show business is  and has a perfect right to be  everywhere.Soon enough, both Mr. Brooks and his project have gone to pot. Aside from some footage of Mr. Yeager (Mr. Grodin), a veterinarian, accidentally killing a horse on the operating table, he hasn't exactly gotten to the heart of anything. And the studio executive in charge of this production (played as a telephone voice by the producer Jennings Lang) loses patience and decides to cut off Mr. Brooks's allowance. It would perhaps be unfair to reveal just how low Mr. Brooks is willing to sink in his efforts to salvage his film. But the ending of ""Real Life"" is the most uproarious of a good many inspired moments.Mr. Brooks, who was co-author of the screenplay with Monica Johnson and Harry Shearer, delivers any line as if it were part of a pitch to sell his audience a used car  preferably the kind with a nice new paint job but no working engine. He is all broad grins and happy handshakes, and Mr. Grodin and Miss McCain behave as if they were a little bit afraid of him, as well they should be. His is an entirely one-dimensional character, and ""Real Life"" has a one-note premise. But the flatness is deliberate and it works remarkably well, even in a feature-length format.If there are certain inconsistencies here and there, well, this is only the first film in what promises to be Mr. Brooks's long and lively career. And as he himself puts it, explaining why his project has strayed so far from its original plan: ""There's no law that says we can't start real and end fake. What are they going to do, put me in movie jail?""""Real Life"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains only a small amount of moderately strong language.",1979-03-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Kaplan Makes 'Fast Break' Look Easy:Basketball Tale,"""FAST BREAK,"" which opens today at three Manhattan theaters, stars Gabe Kaplan of television's ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" as a New York delicatessen clerk who becomes the basketball coach at a tacky Western college, where he guides to victory a group of players slightly less mismatched than the Bad News Bears. Though these basketball players are a good deal older than the baseball-playing Bears, they are much less foul-mouthed.The movie, written by Sandor Stern and directed by Jack Smight, is rather like a successful television situation comedy in that it is very cheerful without actually being very funny. As do some of our most popular standup comedians, Mr. Kaplan sort of floats over his material, always in charge of it, but never deeply involved. This is not a rebuke. It's a description of a particular kind of performing that probably originated in vaudeville, was carried into radio and nightclubs and now has reached its fullest expression on television.In the way that no one would expect Johnny Carson to disappear into a character he plays in a ""Tonight"" Show sketch, we accept Mr. Kaplan's public, talk-show personality as the hustling basketball coach at Cadwallader College. While Mr. Kaplan acts the role, he seems to be keeping up a running commentary on it. It's a nicely self-conscious performance in which the actor gives it all he's got, at the same time appearing to say. ""Look, Ma, no hands!""The supporting cast includes Michael Warren, Harold Sylvester, Mavis Washington and Bernard King, as the black (""ethnic"") players Mr. Kaplan imports to Cadwallader; Randee Heller, who looks like a brunette Farah Fawcett-Majors, who plays Mr. Kaplan's wife; Connie Sawyer, who plays his mother, and Bert Remsen as the coach of the Top Ten team that Cadwallader has to beat if the movie is ever to end.""Fast Break,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), includes some vulgar language.",1979-03-02T05:00:00+0000

When the issues dividing labor and management can be clearly drawn, there is nothing quite as satisfying as collective effort to fight oppression. Workers are children of nature, born without sin. Bosses are devils. In such times faith can flourish. Salvation is not an abstract concept  it's a three-year contract.These are sentiments that Martin Ritt, the director, and Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. (Mrs. Ravetch), his screenwriters, understand and fervently evoke in their often stirring new film, ""Norma Rae."" The movie, which opens today at Loews State 1 and other theaters, also provides Sally Field with the plum role of her career, an opportunity to demonstrate once and for all that she is an actress of dramatic intelligence and force, someone who no longer need be referred to in terms of her television credits.As Norma Rae, a small-town Southern mill worker, a widow with one legitimate child and another born out of wedlock, a resilient young woman of no great education but a lot of common sense, Miss Field gives a performance that is as firm and funny as the set of her glass jaw  and just as full of risk. It's a role loaded with the kind of sentimental temptations that might side-track a lesser performer. Miss Field, though, has found its tough truth and stuck to it. The performance, which gives dimension to the film, may well be the one that those of other actresses are measured against this year.""Norma Rae"" does not take place in the dim dark past of trade unionism. It is set in today's rural South, where the idea of collective bargaining is considered roughly on a par with membership in a Communist cell. After all  though the movie doesn't stress this  the highly publicized industrial boom in the post-World War II South was largely the result of the cheaper (nonunion) wages that lured manufacturers away from the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.""Norma Rae"" is about the efforts of one young New Yorker, a glib, fast-talking Jewish organizer named Reuben Marshasky (Ron Leibman) to bring justice to the tiny town where Norma Rae, her father (Pat Hingle), her mother (Barbara Baxley), her husband-to-be, Sonny (Beau Bridges), and virtually everyone else are dependent upon the cotton mill, the town's only industry.The film's principal appeal, though, is not the manner in which this uphill struggle is fought and won, but in the way that Mr. Ritt, his writers and his cast reveal the natural resources of the characters  their grit, their emotional reserves and their complex feelings for one another. The politics of the film are worthy but they are never as surprising as the people, especially Norma Rae, whose personality is defined in her often comic, sometimes brutal, sometimes touching encounters with ex-husbands, lovers, children, parents, strangers.The film, which was shot in Alabama, places its characters in a recognizable social contest that neither parodies nor patronizes them. In short, swift, effective scenes ""Norma Rae"" dramatizes the limits imposed on imaginations by both poverty and tradition. Norma Rae's father is as wary of the union as any stockholder. Her mother, on the edge of deafness because of the noise in the weaving room where she works, is apathetic. At the first opportunity Sonny leaves the mill and takes a job in a service station. Without the efforts of Reuben Marshasky and this one particular woman, life would have gone on as before.""Norma Rae"" is not without blemish. Mr. Ritt and the Ravetches, who've been collaborating on films since ""Hud"" and ""The Long Hot Summer,"" persist in equating the awakened social conscience with literature not always of the highest order. It's an endearing but dopey conceit that I associate first with the work of Clifford Odets. When Norma Rae is having her consciousness raised, it's signaled by the report that she's reading Dylan Thomas  offscreen. The platonic affair between Norma Rae and Reuben, played by Mr. Leibman in the television-breezy manner of his ""Kaz"" role, is given more time than her rocky, equally interesting relationship with her husband, a role that Mr. Bridges invests with more heft than seems to have been written into the script.There's also an unintentionally hilarious scene in which we see some local codgers sitting around a general store whittling, but they whittle with a ferocity that seems less down-home than Saturday Night Live.These are small objections. ""Norma Rae"" is a seriously concerned contemporary drama, illuminated by some very good performances and one, Miss Field's, that is spectacular.""Norma Rae,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains some muted violence and mildly vulgar language.",1979-03-02T05:00:00+0000

us,The Best of the PresentDay Bluesmen,"Muddy Waters, Professor Longhair, Otis Rush and Son Seals are four of the Most important living bluesmen.

Professor Longhair's fusion of barrelhouseblues piano and Latin rhythms is also a product of the 1950's, although he is valued more for his stylistic eccentricities and for general instrumental and vocal excel lence than he is for his influence, which has never really penetrated far beyond his native New Orleans. On a good night, Otis Rush is simply the most formidable of all modern blues guitarists. And as a relative youngster in his 30's, Son Seals, who plays supercharged, wildly exciting guitar and has integrated funk and even neardisco elements into his presentation, represents not just the best of presentday blues but something of the music's future as well.",1979-03-04T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film:'The Promise,' 2 Lovers","""THE Promise"" is about Michael, a student architect, and Nancy, a painter of great feeling whose style is both vague and familiar. You could put one of her works in any motel room and not even miss it. Michael and Nancy are young, beautiful and in love. Theirs is a mystical sort of union. When they walk along the Massachusetts coast, the scenery is Monterey's. Michael and Nancy have their whole lives ahead of them except for one thing, Michael's mother, the possessive, ambitious Marion.When Michael announces that he is going to marry Nancy, Marion becomes very frosty. She reveals that Nancy was raised ""by a passel of nuns,"" that her mother was an alcoholic and that her father was killed while serving a seven-year jail term for armed robbery. But Michael, who is headstrong as well as rich, will not give up Nancy. He sweeps her off to a justice of the peace. En route, however, they have a ghastly automobile accident.Michael remains unconscious for several days but he is unscarred except for a tiny red line on his forehead that looks like an angel's doodle. Poor Nancy suffers a face so badly smashed that  we are led to believe  toads would turn from her.While she lies in her hospital bed, Nancy is visited by the possessive, ambitious Marion, who offers to pay for Nancy's repair work if Nancy promises never to see Michael again. Nancy agrees. After all, she reasons, she looks such a mess that she has lost Michael anyway. Or has she?The absolutely dry-eyed answer to that question can be found at the Radio City Music Hall, where ""The Promise"" opens today, probably the last film to play the house under its long-time film-and-stage show policy.I assure you that, though I seem to have relayed a great deal of the plot of ""The Promise,"" there's a lot more where that comes from. My synopsis describes no more than the first 20 to 25 minutes. It's impossible to talk about films like ""The Promise"" without going into the plots, because they're not really about anything else. This screenplay, which recalls bits and pieces of many other, better films (""A Woman's Face,"" ""Love Story,"" ""Love Affair,"" ""An Affair to Remember,"" among them), was written by Garry Michael White and directed by Gilbert Cates (""I Never Sang for My Father,"" ""Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams""), who knows better but pretends not to.The members of the cast are undercut by both material and direction. As Marion, Beatrice Straight, who won an Oscar for ""Network,"" is playing a character more at home in daytime television than movie theaters. Kathleen Quinlan, nominated for an Oscar for her extraordinary performance in ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden"" and who is now at the Public Theater in ""Taken in Marriage,"" is shortstopped not only by ridiculous lines but also by makeup that gives her the plastic look of a face-lift even before the accident so (I assume) she'll look fairly normal later. Under the various masks that have been imposed on her, there's a recognizable intelligence struggling toward the light.Stephen Collins, who plays Michael, is too idiosyncratic an actor to be overwhelmed by this sort of junk. Though he has the looks and stature of a leading man, he also has the unexpected abilities one associates with a fine, seasoned character actor, as he demonstrated in ""All the President's Men"" and ""Between the Lines."" He and Miss Quinlan survive ""The Promise"" in the only way possible  by playing it straight.""The Promise,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains nothing at all, including anything that might be thought obscene or suggestive.",1979-03-08T05:00:00+0000

The mother, who has custody, is engaged in constant squabbling with her exhusband about his visitation rights, and the father complains that he doesn't have enough of the children's time.

us,Screen: 'Bright and Beautiful':House Calls,"IF ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" is a hard movie to dislike, it's also hard to pay attention to or remember in any detail. A happy veterinarian, played genially by John Alderton, wanders around the Yorkshire countryside, visiting the cats and dogs and budgies who make up his clientele. His manner is friendly and a bit lackadaisical, so the movie proceeds with a corresponding languor, as if it were out for a stroll on a summer's day. There are no highs or lows, just an endless stream of sick pets and miracle cures. Of these, my favorite was a cute little terrier with indigestion.The closest thing to a dramatic climax occurs when a cow gives birth, on-camera, near the end of the story. Mr. Alderton, it should be noted, took a two-day veterinary crash course and actually delivered the calf. Eric Till, the director, then cuts to a shot of the veterinarian's wife, who has been pregnant and who has been giving birth herself while the cow was doing likewise. Even if Mr. Till's intentions seem good, the net effect is anything but flattering.""All Things Bright And Beautiful,"" set in the late 1930's and based on James Herriot's best-selling memoirs, purports to be the kind of good, old-fashioned family movie they just don't make any more. In fact, they don't make such films very often, but this one, for all its sweeping niceness, hasn't got much pizazz. The average family can have just as much fun clustered in front of its television set, or romping with a furry little friend of its own. And the Yorkshire countryside, which ought to be engaging even when the action is not, is poorly photographed in muddy hues of red and brown.The film opens today at the Guild, the RKO 86th Street and other theaters.",1979-03-09T05:00:00+0000

I think not, but I also realize that it may be just the kind of think mild anesthetic that some people call entertainment.""The French Detective,"" which opens today at the 68th Street Playhouse, is not a whodunit, but a chase film about a tough, veteran Rouen cop (Lino Venture) and his younger sidekick (Patrick Dewaere), who must break all sorts of rules in their pursuit of a murderer working for a political candidate (Victor Lanoux).The film is not about politics, but about physical movement, about getting into and out of automobiles, about climbing stairs, about entering rooms and leaving them, and sometimes about walking on rooftops in the middle of the night  all the while seeking people who can put one in touch with someone else who may or may not know the whereabouts of still another person. It makes no difference that you have often forgotten who the people are or why they are being sought.Pursuit is the game and the performances by Mr. Ventura and Mr. Lanoux are satisfactory, but Mr. Dewaere, who plays a man who's supposed to be in his mid-30's, behaves as if he hadn't yet made his first communion. I think he means to be cute.Pierre Granier-Deferre, the director, has been represented here by one good film. ""The Cat,"" and one terrible film, ""A Woman at Her Window.""

us,"'Remember My Name,' Film by Alan Rudolph:The Cast","Alan Rudolph is just talented enough to be maddening. In his first film, ""Welcome to L.A.""  and now in ""Remember My Name,"" which opens today at the Cinema StudioMr. Rudolph has devised sketchy, insufferably pretentious material and then mounted it with an elegance that is undeniable. Mr. Rudolph is the kind of screenwriter whose best lines are the ones he leaves unfinished. But his characters remain curiously watchable even when they spout gibberish, and spout it very slowly and knowingly at that. Both his films are furiously contemplative, yet neither offers any indication that the director knows the difference between catatonia and anomie.But as thematically barren as Mr. Rudolph's work may beand his ideas about the spiritual poverty of modern life in Los Angeles seem pretty threadbare, to the extent that they're intelligible at all  they have a cool physical beauty that very nearly outweighs the foolishness. ""Remember My Name"" doesn't aspire to the self-congratulatory glamour of ""Welcome to L.A.,"" but the cinematography this time (by Tak Fujimoto) is crisply handsome, and more helpful for being less showy.And Mr. Rudolph has once again attracted actors who are intrinsically interesting even when their material is not, notably Geraldine Chaplin, Anthony Perkins, Jeff Goldblum, Moses Gunn and Alfre Woodard. Also, Mr. Rudolph's recruiting of the blues singer Alberta Hunter, expertly recorded by John Hammond, to write and perform the score amounts to a marvelous coup.The story is very simple, although Mr. Rudolph goes to great pains to make it seem otherwise. Miss Chaplin plays a woman who has just completed a 12-year prison term for killing her husband's lover. When she is released, she tracks down her husband, played by Mr. Perkins, and his new wife, played by Berry Berenson.The first hour of the film is devoted to her efforts to annoy these happy newlyweds, who apparently aren't so happy, by tearing up their marigolds and throwing rocks through their windows. Miss Berenson, whose expressionlessness deadens this angle of the story, doesn't register much shock or surprise at these antics. Mr. Perkins looks puzzled and later explains that he didn't recognize his ex-wife because she used to be a blonde.Miss Chaplin's plans for revenge also involve her getting a job as a cashier at a five-and-ten, because, as one character explains it, ""the best way to learn about anything is to learn how much it costs."" Mr. Rudolph is at his most implausible in trying to deal with this kind of workaday locale; indeed, he seemed far more at home with the privileged ""Welcome to L.A."" characters. When he casts Mr. Perkins as a blue-collar construction worker, it's just a matter of poor judgment. But Moses Gunn's role, as a sad black security guard whom Miss Chaplin manages somehow to enslave and turn into her own personal handyman, is markedly unpleasant in its implications.In addition to calling attention to the film's class condescension, Mr. Gunn's character also pinpoints a big problem with Miss Chaplin's performance: As a woman whose sexuality is meant to seem all-consuming and irresistible, she's simply too chilly most of the time. During the final half hour, when her plans for Mr. Perkins take shape, Mr. Rudolph shoots her in reddish light and lets the two actors loosen up considerably, achieving his desired effect. Until then, though, Miss Chaplin's walking-wounded manner is too remote to allow the story much momentum.Like the other players, she has been too cooperative with a screenplay that feels incomplete. Throughout ""Remember My Name,"" the actors work hard to fulfill the surface requirements of scenes that have no dramatic foundation, and the results are often skittish and baffling.There is also a running thread of commentary on various television news broadcasts in the background, about an earthquake in Budapest, that should have been unraveled. When a movie has to rely on television reports, newspaper headlines, billboards, floods or thunderstorms to make its points about the human condition, it might as well drop the message in the mail.",1979-03-11T05:00:00+0000

Her novels have all been written in the same highly original tone of voice; they are short, quirky, funny and horrifying, and exploit the memories and fantasies of her own girlhood and youth. The bestfilled purses become empty in the end; and even if she had more of this sinister gold to concoct from her very ordinary Liverpool past and her early experiences in love and work, there would be critics who would say: Is this the only kind of thing she can do?

us,"Screen: 'Voices,' a Deaf Teacher's Love Story:They Shall Overcome","""VOICES"" is yet another love story about a young woman with a disability and a dream, plus a handsome and extremely patient suitor who helps make that dream come true. In this case, she (Amy Irving) is a deaf teacher who'd like to dance, although other recent variations on this theme have dealt with a blind ice skater who'd like to become a champion (Lynn-Holly Johnson in ""Ice Castles"") and an about-to-be-crippled ballerina who hopes to give one last great performance (Anne Ditchburn in ""Slow Dancing in the Big City"").In each of these movies  and ""Voices,"" which opens today at the Baronet, is about the best of a very lackluster bunch  the situation takes the place of a plot. His optimism and her infirmity are the only well-established signs of character, and the action creeps inexorably toward a happy ending that is at least as tired as it is triumphant. ""Voices"" is full of details about the young man, played by Michael Ontkean, and his family (three generations of contentious men) and their house (in Hoboken) and their business (dry cleaning). But it all manages to seem either trumped-up or extraneous, as does the fact that he has a dream, too. (He wants to be a rock singer.)Movies in this mold tend to be so preoccupied with pie-in-the-sky that they scant the everyday activities that might hold an audience's attention. (Perhaps the most powerful surprise in ""Coming Home"" was its matter-of-fact depiction of how a paraplegic might accomplish simple household or hygienic chores.)""Voices"" includes one very effective scene of Miss Irving conducting a telephone conversation  using a kind of typewriter keyboard  with a deaf friend, and it devotes some attention to sign language. But the director, Robert Markowitz, is so poorly equipped to render his deaf heroine's experience inventively that the best he can do is simply shut off the soundtrack from time to time. The screenplay, by John Herzfeld, is equally insensitive, particularly when it means to be funny. Someone in hero's family: ""Is she deaf and dumb?"" Hero: ""She is not dumb. She's smarter than all of us. She's a teacher.""Mr. Ontkean is considerably more likable than his material. But the character is so nebulous  and so noisy and frantic, as a clumsy counterpoint to the silent, demure heroine  that his performance never takes shape; ""Slap Shot,"" in which he was cast as a funny, disillusioned hockey player, provided a much better indication of what he can do.Miss Irving's role is just as ill-defined, but she is agile and interesting even when the screenplay merely calls for her to look shy. And in the last part of the film, when a frustrated and embarrassed Miss Irving  who has made a dramatically convenient secret of her deafness  auditions with a dance company, though she can't hear the music or the directions, she is given a welcome opportunity to be something other than an ingnue. She has an appealing uneasiness that might work better in less sugary roles.Alex Rocco, Herbert Berghof, Viveca Lindfors and the city of Hoboken also appear in the film, although only Hoboken accomplishes this with any success. Mr. Markowitz has also recruited some emphatically disagreeable bit players (one of them throws his false teeth on a table, to emphasize something he has been hollering about).And the script, which is mysteriously full of references to meat, is also overloaded with unlikely coincidences. Mr. Ontkean first spies Miss Irving, for instance, in a train station where she has been playing with one of those machines that engrave a name on a little good-luck charm, and tracks her down after she leaves the charm behind. Speaking of unlikely, her name is Rosemarie Lemon.""Voices"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").

us,Film: 1969 Relived in 'Hair':A Show Remembered,"ONE might think that because ""Hair"" was so much the contemporary artifact when it opened on Broadway 10 years ago, its time as a movie would have come and gone. Lifetimes of life styles have been junked in the interim. We all know people who for years wore their hair in the modified Medusa-bob of Gerome Ragni but who now look as neat as Otto Preminger, or who experimented with grass and then quietly returned to the known pleasures of booze, or who once marched on the Pentagon with the enthusiasm they now display in Central Park, jogging around the Reservoir. ""Hair"" should be old hat, but the good news this morning is that it's not.Milos Forman's screen version, which opens today at the Ziegfeld Theater, is a rollicking musical memoir, as much a recollection of the show as of the period, a film that has the charm of a fable and the slickness of Broadway show biz at its breathless best.This ""Hair"" is not to us what the original Joseph Papp and the Broadway productions were to their audiences. There's no pretense that it has anything to do with today except to antecede it. It no longer feels the need to shock us with the once highly publicized curtain scene in which the cast stripped down to the buff to confront the audience in lights so dim we could have been watching Julia Child on a bum picture tube.The Galt MacDermot score, with lyrics by Mr. Ragni and James Rado (who wrote the book for the stage show and starred in it), is as sweet as an album of golden oldies but far livelier and wittier than most. You may think you can't listen to ""Aquarius"" even once more without doing yourself damage, but give it a chance. It frames the film with good feelings that include a dozen other numbers that still have the power to surprise and amuse us.Most important, Mr. Forman and Michael Weller, who wrote the script, have found an easy, loose, very winning screen equivalent to the show's illusive narrative about a naif named Claude who, en route to Vietnam, shares a few halcyon days with a group of hippies in Central Park. Mr. Weller's inventions make this ""Hair"" seem much funnier than I remember the show's having been. They also provide time and space for the development of characters who, on the stage, had to express themselves almost entirely in song.The film moves in and out of its principal Central Park location  to Wall Street (for Claude's induction in the Army), to the suburbs (for a classic low-comedy confrontation between the hippies and society's stuffed shirts), and to an Army base in Nevada (where the hippies follow Claude to say goodbye but, instead, effect an unwitting change in the plans of the United States Government).Mr. Forman, who won an Oscar for his direction of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" has long had an affection for the American counterculture of the 60's. In ""Hair"" he has been able to express it with an exuberance that was never completely convincing in ""Taking Off."" He also manages to keep the fantasy aloft so that we accept the music and the dancing (choreography by Twyla Tharp) without worrying about the realism that so often keeps film musicals earthbound.The contributions of Miroslav Ondricek, a fellow Czechoslovak who was Mr. Forman's cameraman here, and of the members of the cast are of immense value. John Savage, so good in ""The Deer Hunter,"" is very funny as the nave Claude, but then the entire cast is superb, especially Treat Williams as Berger, the hippie leader, and Beverly D'Angelo as Sheila, the society girl who joins the tribe.The film has several things that are not super. The big production number based on the title song  staged in a jailis total confusion, and there are times when the itchy fingers of the editor prevent us from getting the full effect of what the dancers are doing. Mostly, though, the film is a delight.""Hair,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some partial nudity, some vulgar slang and some words that are obscene if one understands their meanings.",1979-03-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Home Beat,"IT all started about three years ago when Nancy Wykstra, above, wanted an allcotton mattress but couldn't find one. Someone told her about the futon traditional Oriental mattress, made up of layers of cotton batting and covered with a cotton fabric. She made one for herself, then started making them other people and was asked to teach a course in futonmaking at New York's East West Center for Holistic Health. Now the 31-year-old Miss Wykstra, who grew up Michigan and learned to sew from her mother, is making more futons in a loft lower Manhattan. She sews them herself, using allcotton batting for the mattress filling, and unbleached muslin for the cover. Japanese futons are different from Chinese ones, Miss Wykstra explained., The Japanese ones are thin and matlike, while the Chinese ones are more like our mattresses. She will make futons in either thickness. Although they are heavy, she said, the futons fold easily, are good for bad backs and can be rolled un and used as guest beds or couches. To order r a naturalfiber futon, telephone Miss Wykstra at 799 5383; when your mattress is ready, she will call you back and you will have to arrange to pick it up yourself. But remember that even the thinner Japanesetype futons weigh approximately 20 pounds each; the thicker Chinese ones weigh between 50 and 60 pounds apiece, so don't expect to be able to pick one up and take it home with you on the subway. Depending on their thicknesses, twinsized futons are $55 or $50 each, doubles are $65 or $60, and the queensized ones are $75 or $70.

When the wheel was invented, there was someone, I'm sure, who groaned and said that now everyone could roll toward disaster just that much more quickly. Evolution is scary. Few of us like to acknowledge that we don't represent the perfect end of the process.In the atomic age, technology has been accelerating at a rate that leaves many of us exhausted, if not fearful. For someone who hasn't yet learned how to dominate a high-spirited electric typewriter, the thought of nuclear energywith its potential for good as well as for destruction  turns the imagination into a nervous heap.It's these apprehensions that are called forth by ""The China Syndrome,"" James Bridges's smashingly effective, very stylish suspense melodrama that opens today at the Loews State 2 and other theaters.""The China Syndrome,"" written by Mr. Bridges with Mike Gray and T.S. Cook, evokes the spectacle of the terrifying things that might happen should there be a lapse in the safety procedures at an electrical generating plant powered by nuclear energy. The time is now and the place is southern California. The film is as topical as this morning's weather report, as full of threat of hellfire as an old-fashioned Sunday sermon and as bright and shiny and new-looking as the fanciest science-fiction film.It stars Jane Fonda as a clever, ambitious television news reporter named Kimberly Wells, a woman who keeps a turtle for a pet, who doesn't let her private life take precedence over her public image and who knows she is not going to make big-time network news by doing chatty features about singing messengers. It also stars Michael Douglas as Richard Adams, Kimberly's cameraman, a 60's radical turned into a 70's skeptic, a fellow who sees conspiracies everywhere, who wants to be a part of the establishment but keeps biting the hand that would feed him.In the best role he's had in a long time, Jack Lemmon appears as Jack Godell, a key official in the nuclear-energy station where Kimberly and her television crew, on a routine story assignment, happen to witness what the public-relations man blithely calls ""a routine turbine trip.""On further investigation, the reporters learn that what they saw was, in fact, far from routine and was, instead, in the jargon of the trade, ""a potentially costly event."" In this case, ""event"" means a malfunctioning that could have resulted in a ""meltdown""called the China syndromeleading in turn to the destruction of the plant and the creation of a radioactive cloud capable of laying waste to half of Southern California.Could this happen? I've no idea, but the film makes a compelling case based on man's not-so-rare predisposition to cut corners, to take the easy way out, to make a fast buck, to be lazy about responsibility and to be awed by the authority representing vested interests.""The China Syndrome"" is less about laws of physics than about public and private ethics. The film isn't only concerned with safety procedures, but also with the ethics of a certain kind of journalism that packages news that won't offend. Also, in the course of the story, both Kimberly Wells, woman reporter, and Jack Godell, who has dedicated his life to the priesthood of technology, must make decisions that have the effect of denying all they've done before.However, ""The China Syndrome"" doesn't keep us on the edges of our seats because it's so uplifting. Mr. Bridges, who wrote the screenplay for a fine little sci-fi film called ""The Forbin Project"" and most recently directed the James Dean elegy, ""September 30, 1955,"" is a gifted and witty melodramaticist. There is suspense almost from the film's start in a television newsroom, and it builds without much letup until the finale. He has an ear for the way people talk, an eye for the pressed-plastic look of our transistorized world and sympathy for minor dishonesties that can suddenly shape the way people behave when faced with major problems.The three stars are splendid, but maybe Miss Fonda is just a bit more than that. Her performance is not that of an actress in a star's role, but that of an actress creating a character that happens to be major within the film. She keeps getting better and better.""The China Syndrome,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly vulgar language.",1979-03-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Wajda's 'Man of Marble' Delineates Heroic Laborer:The Cast,"Andrzej Wajda, Poland's greatest film maker, is quoted as having said that one cannot commit heroic acts if they are useless. Such an act is a tree falling in the middle of the forest where there is no one to hear. A heroic act that accomplishes nothing is as abstract as the gesture of a gymnast. This is something to keep in mind if you can possibly get to see Mr. Wajda's extraordinary 1977 film ""Man of Marble,"" which is being shown today at 3:15 P.M. and 9 P.M. at the Hunter College Assembly Hall. ""Man of Marble"" is one of nine films being screened in the eight-day Wajda retrospective that will end tomorrow.In ""Man of Marble,"" Mr. Wajda, best known here for ""Kanal"" (1957) and ""Ashes and Diamonds"" (1958), explores the course of Polish Communism from the late, paranoid 40's, before Stalin's death (1953) and the political thaw (1956) to the present, when many Communists are virtually indistinguishable from the members of the new bourgeoisie. The movie is a political epic, compassionate and as bitterly funny as a cartoon.""Man of Marble"" is about the attempts of a film maker, a woman with the busily self-important manner of the young fanatic, to make a documentary about a certain Mateusz Birkut, a bricklayer who, in the early days of the Communist revolution, was hailed as a national hero for his productivity feats and became as famous as any film star, only to disappear from the record books in 1952.Mr. Wajda's efforts to come to terms with Stalinism, as well as with the contradictions and lapses within subsequent Polish regimes, are even more courageous than the actions of his surrogate film maker within the film. But though Mr. Wajda's film often has the tone of satire, especially in the films-within-the-film he shows us, the sense of the movie, at least to the outsider, is that of loss, of promises broken, of great ambitions grown flabby, of dreams distorted to small purpose.This is apparently because the film, as it was released in Poland and as we are seeing it here, is missing a penultimate sequence that would have emphasized Mr. Wajda's concept of the continuing nature of the social struggle. In removing references to the workers' strike in the port of Gdansk in 1970, the Polish censors have  unintentionally, I assume  undercut and neutralized Mr. Wajda and made the movie seem far more bleak and pessimistic than he probably intended. The movie that we see is about a heroic life that failed.In form, ""Man of Marble"" is a mystery story as Agnieszka (Krystyna Janda), the film maker, seeks the truth about Birkut (Jerzy Radziwilowicz), whom she first gets to know through newsreels and propaganda films (""Birth of a City"" and ""Architects of Our Happiness"") and then through interviews with his former wife, his best friend and others, friends and enemies, who knew him. Like Charles Foster Kane, Birkut always remains at one remove from the investigating reporter and from the audience.When Birkut is initially picked to be the centerpiece of a documentary designed to call attention to ""the noble art of bricklaying,"" he is hardly more than a sweet-natured, Marxist Candide. Later, when he understands the machinations of the Stalinist system, he rebels and pays the price for his knowledge by being packed off to prison as the leader of a terrorist gang called the Gypsy Band. In fact, he had gotten drunk one night, hired a carriage and a gypsy band to serenade him, and gone to police headquarters, where he threw a brick through the front door.Unlike many of his colleagues, Birkut refuses, later, after he has been rehabilitated, to forgive and forget. He disappears in the crowd to become  in effect  the unrelenting conscience of the revolution.""Man of Marble"" is not, I think, a film that many revolutionary societies could tolerate. Its picture of young radicals growing into smug, self-serving middle-age is not the sort of thing that draws recruits to a cause. But Mr. Wajda is a humanist who refuses to restrict himself to the short view that sees only what is currently acceptable.Unfortunately, when ""Man of Marble"" is screened without its key sequence, it has the look of something unfinished  and, indeed, it now makes no sense without the help of program notes.

But she's in no danger of being mistaken for anyone authentic when she speaks or thinks. Alison contemplating the 50odd carat diamond on her hand: It had a hardness she could try to emulate. Alison pondering her success: Fame, money, beauty, talent  where did they get anyone, after all? A writer who sets out to sensationalize already lively headlines can be the worst sort of scoundrel, but there's one thing he'd better not be nice.

She's a sweet young thing when she makes her debut as a child star in that animal movie (not National Velvet, silly Bandit, the story of a raccoon).

The future, they predicted, would be in the hands of the foundation screening committee, the endowment panel, the arts council bureaucrat and the nonprofit manager.

Few people, including the more demanding of critics, would argue that television should devote itself exclusively to the uplifting of society. It would be ridiculous to underestimate the value of good entertainment: in sitcoms from I Love Lucy to All in the Family, in action formats from The Defenders to Police Story, in domestic dramas from The Waltons to Family. Only fools would argue against the presence of such programs on the schedule. On the other hand, only fools would fail to notice that such programming is becoming more rare on the schedule as the target audience becomes younger and younger.

us,Film: 'The Bell Jar':A Would-Be Poet,"EVEN though Sylvia Plath was substantially older than her college-girl autobiographical heroine when she wrote ""The Bell Jar,"" the book has an adolescent spirit. Its hypersensitivity, its romantic flights of fancy and its seesawing moods are as typically teen-age as they are early signs of the author's illness, which eventually led to her suicide. This is the signal quality of ""The Bell Jar,"" a schoolgirl overstatement that makes the book as amateurish as it is haunting, and it's a quality that the film version doesn't even begin to understand. This is as sane, cheery and level-headed an account of a nervous breakdown as you could ever hope to see.""The Bell Jar,"" which opens today at Cinema I, makes it impossible to believe that its heroine, Esther Greenwood, is a hard-working and extremely driven would-be poet; as played by Marilyn Hassett, Esther is, even at her most hysterical, more like a cheer-leader whose team has just lost a big game. This is disastrous, not because Miss Hassett doesn't make Esther brainy enough but because it is the character's imaginative life that leads her to a collapse, and the movie barely even goes skin-deep. The audience isn't given the slightest clue about Esther's quirks, her fears, her peculiarly distorted notion of herself. She seems to be afraid of sex, and she also seems to be the object of amorous attention from most of the women she knows but, beyond that, the movie doesn't explain a thing.Much of the story is concerned with Esther's experiences in New York, in the 50's, as a guest editor at a women's magazine. Larry Peerce, who directed ""Goodbye, Columbus,"" would seem well equipped to send up the fashion world in these sequences, but there's no satirical edge to any of this, and no dramatic edge either. It all simply plods along, en route to a nervous collapse that manages to seem perfectly unwarranted by the time it finally occurs. The scenes that are supposed to trigger all the trouble  Esther's confrontations with her mother (Julie Harris) and her strangely sadistic editor (Barbara Barrie), a gratuitously sleazy orgy with a disk jockey (Robert Klein)  are appallingly flat, neither explanatory nor disturbing.When Esther finally decides to commit suicide, she does so in a way that's instructively at odds with the suicide attempt in the book. Miss Plath's heroine meant business: She took an overdose of pills and hid in the cellar of her mother's house, where she was found only by accident. Miss Hassett's Esther writes a farewell note on a mirror in lipstick, then slashes one wrist and scrawls something in the sink, writes a farewell message on a notepad and wanders downstairs without really bothering to hide. This sequence, which lasts a long time and isn't affecting in the slightest, is emblematic of the movie's way of spelling things out ad nauseam and still not making them clear.Miss Hassett is unconvincing and, much of the time, unsympathetic; she hasn't a hint of the mystery that might make an audience believe in her madness. The best she can do is to raise her voice unexpectedly to indicate she's disturbed, and also to stop washing her hair. As sweet-faced and appealing as Miss Hassett was in Mr. Peerce's ""The Other Side of the Mountain,"" she's so wrong for ""The Bell Jar"" that she tries an audience's patience before long. Of the other actors, only Julie Harris breathes any life into the material  although nothing in either her performance or Miss Hassett's makes it possible to understand why Esther hates her mother.The script, by Marjorie Kellogg, is full of overwrought extremes, even though Mr. Peerce directs virtually all of it with an inappropriate evenness. The editing of the film is so choppy it calls constant attention to itself. The music, by Gerald Fried, is pretty, and so are the costumes, by Donald Brooks.",1979-03-21T05:00:00+0000

He looms as the Seattle Mariners designated hitter this season, but his new image is more significant. Strangely, it developed accidentally.

RICHARDSON, above, graduated from Wesleyan University in 1969, and returned to his hometown of St. Louis to work at the Shure Manufacturing Company, which at the time was mainly producing furnishings for automobile service garages. I felt strongly that the workrooms of these facilities did not have to be dull, Mr. Richardson explained, and that the service technician was a professional who could profit from a wellorganized working environment, much like his counterpart, the office worker. So Mr. Richardson managed to get the Shure workbenches streamlined. He introduced way out colors like orange, bright green and red into the then graygreen line. Some colors took hold, Mr. Richardson said, especially the cardinal red. Over the years, the cornpany has expanded its selection of workbenches, tool carts and service desks, which are primarily used by automobile technicians and mechanics, in service stations, garages and schools. Mr. Richardson, who is now the president of Shure, sees a more practical homerelated use for the workbenches  actually what we would call worktables, in the home. The allsteel tables with bakedenamel finishes come in a variety of heights and can be equipped with drawers or topped with wood. Although they are normally bolted to the floor in service stations, or workrooms, this is not always necessary as the workbenches are heavy and stable enough to stand securely on their own. In New York, you can get the Shure workbenches at Manhattan Ad Hoc Housewares, 842 Lexington Avenue, at 64th Street. Shown above outside the store, Mr. Richardson perches on a 34inchhigh, 48inchlong and 29inchwide table that retails for $135. The drawer is $75.

us,Film: 'Boyfriends' By Joan Tewkesbury,"""OLD BOYFRIENDS,"" the first film to be directed by Joan Tewkesbury, who has written screenplays for Robert Altman, is a movie in which the characters are more intelligent and interesting than anything they are required to do. They appear to have an existence outside the story, though I'm not sure how this can happen if, as I assume, the actors are playing the characters written in the screenplay by Paul Schrader and his brother, Leonard.Yet here is a movie in which one remembers as vividly as anything else Buck Henry in a throw-away role, that of a private investigator who is so delighted with his beautiful, statuesque secretary that he beams with helpless pleasure every time she pours a cup of coffee. His fascination with the young woman has nothing at all to do with the rest of the movie, but it is mysterious and surprising, the way life is and ""Old Boyfriends"" isn't. The film opens today at the Sutton.The movie presents us with the spectacle of Diane Cruise (Talia Shire), a clinical psychologist from Los Angeles, who has fallen into a deep neurotic depression following the loss of her husband. However, the way that Diane behaves doesn't suggest a depressed character as much as it does someone in the throes of a literary conceit. In an attempt to get a fix on herself, Diane sets out to track down three former boyfriends who, at different stages in her life, were crucially important to her. There's Jeff (Richard Jordan), her college love, who is now a film maker separated from his wife and, as he puts it, ""a working mother"" to his 13-year-old daughter. There are also Eric Katz (John Belushi), the leader of a tacky band, the fellow who humiliated her in high school, and Lewis Van Til, her grammar school boyfriend who was killed in Vietnam, but who left a younger brother, Wayne (Keith Carradine), who looks exactly the way Diane thinks Lewis would have looked if he had lived.Almost as soon as she meets Wayne, Diane starts ""transferring"" (based on the psychiatric meaning of the word ""transference""), which  from the way it's demonstrated in this movie  is a communicable disease.Does Diane straighten herself out? Do movies have endings?There are some nice small moments in the movie, including a funny sequence about the filming of an election campaign commercial, and most of the scenes between Diane and Jeff. There's an unexpectedly affecting encounter between Diane and Wayne's mother (Bethel Leslie), which is then neutralized by a second encounter between them that is terrible.The writing veers back and forth between the good and the appalling. Says Diane, as she attempts to describe her relationship with Jeff: ""He reaches inside me and pulls me out. I only wish that I could love me as much as he does."" Some of this comes from her schoolgirl diaries, yet she has the unfortunate habit of talking like this in every adult crisis.Miss Tewkesbury's directorial style is loose without being lively. The screenplay doesn't help, but then it looks as if the director began production fondly hoping to discover the center of the film during the shooting. There's a good deal of seemingly unnecessary cross-cutting (between simultaneous actions), which doesn't heighten interest as often as it dissipates it. The performers, including John Houseman, who plays the small role of a psychiatrist, invest much more of themselves in the film than it ever returns to them.",1979-03-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Triumphs and Symptoms,"THE unfolding drama of Virginia Woolf's inner world, as reflected in her letters, reaches a moment in this newest volume when she has triumphed over her disasters family deaths, breakdowns, four years of war. Her climb to literary eminence has been hard and slow. She is famous. She can speak with the assurance of her reputation and with complete mastery of her modulated ironic mockery. There is less hesitation, less tergiversation, and there are fewer pirouettes. She is crisp, incisive, always to the point and penetrating in her grasp of human behavior and human expression. She has stirred the women's world into new awareness with A Room of One's Own, and she writes that she is writing The Waves to a rhythm and not to a plot. She calls this inspired elegiac novel a stunt book and a barren and frigid experiment ... Virginia hanging to a trapeze by her toe nails. The public doesn't agree; 10,000 copies are sold right off. Within her triumphs there exists a lingering insecurity; symptoms remain  headaches, mood swings, faintings, depression.

After these concerts, the one who was clearly favored was David Zinman, an American who was head of the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra in Amsterdam. Two years went by, during which nothing happened. Finally, an insurgent group was able to dislodge the incumbent board of directors, and the first thing it did was to bring in Mr. Zinman. That was in 197273.

Mr. Sisson's demand for literary independence is consonant with arguments put forth by his predecessors Matthew Arnold and Wyndham Lewis, both of whom are mentioned by Michael Schmidt in his introduction to The Avoidance of Literature as writers who avoided fashionable critical and ideological formulas. It was their conviction that one could transcend the necessarily provisional, subjective literary attitudes of one's time by cultivating an awareness of objective standards in literature and criticism (see Arnold's The Function of Criticism or The Study of Poetry) or by adopting a deliberately subversive mode of address (see Lewis's early novels and his critical bad manners generally).",1979-03-25T05:00:00+0000

Nicholas Meyer, author of the bestselling SevenPerCent Solution (which was also a successful movie), is currently directing his own films, as is Michael Crichton, whose justreleased movie version of his own novel The Great Train Robbery has become a success.

Several of Elvis Costello's love songs come to mind, and much of the Rolling Stones album Some Girls, and most recently an extraordinary tworecord set from Marvin Gaye, Here, My Dear. Mr. Gaye's album, a long rumination on the end of his marriage, goes further than its predecessors. It complains bitterly about the terms of the divorce settlement, it addresses the departed spouse by name, and it flaunts the macho selfpabsorption that must have had something to do with the marriage's faltering in the first place. The title is to be taken literally; Mr. Gaye is presenting the album to his exwife, since he has filed for bankruptcy and she will presumably be collecting royalties from it before he does.

Next week what promises to be a lively spring for jewelry auctions opens with two sales on Wednesday. The first, at 10 A.M. in the William Doyle Galleries, 175 East 87th Street, presents $1 million worth of jewelry. Among the top offerings are a 5carat diamond ring (it may sell for up to $125,000), a pair of emerald and diamond earclips (up to $100,000) and an 80carat sapphire ring (up to $60,000). The second auction is a twoday event, Wednesday at 2 P.M. and Thursday at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M., at Sotheby Parke Bernet, Madison Avenue, at 76th Street. Among the many splendid gems and settings is a stunning ruby and diamond necklace, an early Art Deco design by Cartier that incorporates 68 rubies, 14 emeraldcut diamonds and 300 smaller diamonds.

Just to anticipate it is to know everything about it. Some intelligent, sophisticated people have knocked themselves out to transform bland into bland, and they have succeeded to the extent that anyone who fondly remembers the comic strip, or the old movie serial with Buster Crabbe, probably will not feel cheated. After all, people who order corn flakes seldom send them back to the chef.The screenwriters, Glen A. Larson and Leslie Stevens, the one-time Broadway playwright (""The Marriage-Go-Round""), appear to have been inspired as much by ""Star Wars"" as by the comic strip about the 20th century pilot who awakens in the 25th century. They've added a relentlessly cute drone, Twiki (voice by Mel Blanc), who's approximately the size of your extra gasoline can and who carries around his neck a computer named Theo, who looks like the headlight off a Cadillac and talks like a doctor in a commercial about stomach distress.As in ""Superman,"" the movie never quite concludes, leaving the way open for the further adventures of Buck Rogers, and for the further serialization of feature-length motion pictures. If there were not already a second Buck Rogers film in the works, there'd be no explanation for the brief, now-you-see-him-now-you-don't appearance of Joseph Wiseman as the tyrant Draco, king of Draconia, the galaxy whose terrible plans for earth form what might loosely be called the story.The only other member of the cast who is familiar is Henry Silva, as the character who, in the comic strip, was known as Killer Kane but who here is called simply Kane, the chief flunky and minister-of-state to Draco's headstrong daughter, Princess Ardala.Gil Gerard, the new actor who plays Buck, looks quite right for the role  handsome in the undistinguished way of dozens of Hollywood actors of the 30's who never quite made the grade in A-pictures. He may well be the John Ridgely or Dennis O'Keefe of the 1970's, especially since his manner of delivering the script's laboriously updated wisecracks recalls Dennis O'Keefe with bad material. Erin Gray, a former photographer's model with high-fashion beauty, plays the virtuous Wilma and is much funnier in her serious intensity than Mr. Gerard when he attempts to be flip.Pamela Hensley is the film's most magnificent special effect as the wicked, lusty Princess Ardala, a tall, fantastically built woman who dresses in jewelry that functions as clothes and walks as if every floor were a burlesque runway.Daniel Haller, who learned his trade with Roger Corman, may not be the wittiest of directors but he displays a brisk, no-nonsense approach to filmmaking that is immensely helpful in this kind of film. The movie is paced to hold the interest of the smallest brain.The special effects? We see space ships, the 25th-century city that has replaced 20th-century Chicago, dread mutants deformed by the earlier holocaust and all sorts of other, theoretically unbelievable things. My problem is that after awhile all these movies look alike.One set, however, deserves special mention. It is Princess Ardala's command craft, a space ship so roomy that it contains a throne room as well as a bathtub as big as an Olympic-size swimming pool. The exterior of the ship looks very much like the temple of Queen Hatshepsut at Thebes, miraculously made airborne and set adrift in a serene cosmos.""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains one naughty 20th-century word of German roots and a lot of failed double-entendres that work only one way.",1979-03-30T05:00:00+0000
