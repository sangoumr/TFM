When I finished my final draft of the biography, he writes by way of explaining the role that Thurber's widow, Helen, played in the project, I presented her with a copy for her emendations and comments, in conformity with our agreement. Her emenda tions were comparatively few but her comments were numerous. The gist of her complaints was that I had treated her husband's life in too negative a fashion. I am sorry she felt that way. What I did was simply take the facts as they were revealed to me from letters, personal papers, published matter, interviews, and, with a minimum of preconception and using Thurber's own words as much as possible, set them down. In biographya more profound form of journalismpatent truth can have no surrogate. What this reader wondered was: How could Mrs. Thurberclearly a woman of integrity, to judge from the portrait of her that emerges from these same pagespossibly have thought otherwise? What could she have had in mind when she complained of Mr. Bernstein's negativity? After all, the unhappy aspects of her husband's life seem plain for anyone to see in this the most comprehensive and threedimensional portrait of Thurber yet to be rendered. How his childhood was disrupted not only by the famous bowandarrow accident that cost him one eye (and doomed the other) at the age of six, but alsoand more subtlyby family tensions that led to his virtually boarding with a favorite aunt from the of 10 to 15.",1975-04-03T05:00:00+0000

The film was shown yesterday at the Museum of Modern Art in the New Films-New Directors series and will be shown there again this evening at 6.Though the movie's glossy, picturesque look has the effect of denying the depth of the director's interest in the primitive culture he is studying, Mr. Klein does show real ability in obtaining simple, direct, unselfconscious performances from his Indian actors. They all perform with that kind of natural absorption that often elludes amateurs, including those women secretly photographed in supermarkets touting their favorite brand of detergent.""Chac"" has a story of sorts. It's about the members of a contemporary Mayan tribe who, when their own shaman fails to produce rain, seek the help of a possibly evil hermit called the Diviner.

Real painting had to do with the truths of Christianity, with decisive events in history, with the look of kings and queens and potentates and with that glorious world of fantasy that had come down to us from the Greek and Latin poets.and from their successors in Italy and France. Imagination was all, in such cases, and the painter was by definition a poet. Still life in relation to these activities was no more than simian mimicry.",1975-04-06T05:00:00+0000

But it was not until about 1969, the date of a Manhattan street protest usually cited as the start of the gay liberation movement, that gays started going in for group travel. That winter saw the formation of Gypsy Feet (1621 Second Avenue, New York), a club devoted to stretching travel dollars. Membership has grown to 2,000, mostly men in their thirties and forties, who pay $15 annual dues to choose from nearly 500 tour packages and charter flights. Examples of 1974 offerings: $209 for a fourday Thanksgiving weekend in London; $299 for Rio de Janeiro the week after Mardi Gras but before the last hurrah. (To both prices were added 10 per cent tax and service. Also, these costs were based on affinity group air fares: one must be a member for six months to take part.) Slightly older, more affluent gays are served by Hanns Ebensten Travel (55 West 42d Street, New York), a wholesaleretail organization which added just one allmale escorted tour to its regular line in 1973. Now it offers seven such packages with 13 departures. Among them, a Devil's Island (French Guiana) tour which, with some amenities, includes accommodations for 30 men in the prison's adapted guards' quarter, and a week on rubber rafts shooting the rapids of the Snake River in Idaho. This one's popular with a lot of Marlboro Men types, Ebensten says.

Angel's new recording of the opera with the four principals of the Met production should also help adjust the perspective as well as provide a fascinating memento of the occasion itself.",1975-04-06T05:00:00+0000

The subject of the film, who has been Uganda's dictator since he took power in a coup d'tat in 1971, is not the sort to use bushels to hide lights that would embarrass other men.""General Idi Amin Dada,"" which was shown Saturday and Sunday as part of the Museum of Modern Art's current New Directors/New Films series, was made by Mr. Schroeder and his associates, including the celebrated cameraman, Nestor Almendros, in Uganda early last year with the enthusiastic cooperation of the general, who has no fear of making a fool of himself.To think that General Amin does make a fool of himself, as you sit there watching the movie, which often seems to be funny, is simply a way of insulating yourself to one of the movie's principal points; that modern Africa, lurching toward useful identity, still has a long way to go before it achieves it. In the mean-time, extraordinarily complex characters like General Amin bumble along creating lethal chaos along with some measure of self-esteem.The only fault I'd find with the film, which, according to Mr. Schroeder, was largely directed by the general and afterward submitted for his approval, is that it will seem to be funny, colorful and quaint to sophisticated audiences. Here's a sequence of the general racing some younger associates across his swimming pool and, of course, winning. In another he is reminded of his wild telegrams to the heads of other governments (including former President Richard M. Nixon), which strike him (and us) as hugely comic, if only because they are so rude.General Amin, who sees himself as the father both of his country and of black Africa, boasts, struts, plays the accordion, acts as tour guide through a game reserve, lectures his cabinet on hard work and cautions Uganda's doctors not to drink too much.Behind it all one sees the general's megalomania, his cruelty, his wit and his charm.Mr. Schroeder, who made what may be the definitive film about young European drop-outs of the nineteen-sixties, ""More,"" never intrudes upon the general in this straightforward documentary. The film is virtually a self-portraitboth terrifying and sorrowful.",1975-04-07T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen:'A Simple Event,' From Iran, at Modern Art","""A Simple Event,"" the Iranian entry in the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors/New Films series, which was shown last night and will be repeated tonight, is an altruistic but all too simple saga. Sohrab Shahid Saless, a documentary director who made his feature film debut with ""Event"" in 1973, has again achieved a documentarylike authenticity. But his overlong, sometimes repetitious examination of a small-town family vitiates a potentially powerful drama and loosely veiled implications of the seemingly hopeless life in the Persian hinterland.His unspecified, reportedly nonprofessional, principals are an obedient, if badgered, schoolboy; his fisherman father, and his ailing mother. Unfortunately, their lives are matters of mere survival in unchangingly drab surroundings, perceived through largely unemotional reactions to the normal and occasional abnormal situations with which they are faced.The English subtitles are understandably sparse, since the cast is, at best, taciturn and hardly articulate. One empathizes with the dutiful boy who keeps running from school, where he is constantly criticized, to fetching the fish to stores, to home and silent, meager meals, to bed and back again to the same rounds. And a viewer is momentarily touched by his mother's sudden death and lonely funeral and his father's sympathetic, if unsuccessful, attempt to buy him a new suit.But the automatonlike father, who is given to work, drink and sleep, as well as the worn mother and their sad-eyed youngster, emerge as merely pitiable figures on an unrewarding, distant but mostly placid landscape. They deserve compassion but, like the tragedy of isolation, poverty and helplessness, they remain vague and largely unresolved in this ""Simple Event.""",1975-04-08T05:00:00+0000

And Lou Carnesecca, his old coach at St. John's, remembers bringing Paultz on campus for the first time and they asked me where I got this big kid from. But there is a fierceness inside Paultz that enabled him to return from a painful groin injury, sink his last nine shots of the game and help give the Nets a 10 lead over the Spirits of St. Louis in their American Basketball Association playoff series. The New Yorkers are favored to make it 20 by the time the teams finish at the Nassau Coliseum tomorrow night.

Her eyes are large and dark, and she would be beautiful if given half a chance, but she denies herself all chances of beauty by dressing and moving with genteelly sef-effacing slovenliness.Anna is the maid of all work in the middle-class Athens household where she has lived since she came to the city from her country village 10 years earlier. Anna is a gem. She is almost one of the family, and when the members of the family set about to arrange a marriage for her, she seems hurt, as if they didn't want her.But that is just the beginning of ""The Engagement of Anna,"" the exceptionally wise and moving Greek film that was shown at the Museum of Modern Art yesterday as part of the New Directors/ New Films series. It will be shown again at the museum this evening at 8.30.It's a bit difficult to describe the unique quality of ""The Engagement of Anna."" It's a political film in which politics are never mentioned, and its mood is furious, although, until somewhere near the end, no one ever acknowledges his anger.""The Engagement of Anna"" was directed by Pantelis Voulgaris in 1972 when he was 32. As far as I can find out, it's his first fiction feature, although he demonstrates the sort of marvelous narrative control many much older directors never achieve.Mr. Voulgaris's method is in knowing just how much information to reserve. The camera eye never boggles at obvious points. It doesn't slip into easy close-ups to force our attention. It maintains instead a kind of respectful distance from the action, which gives the film a deceptively serene look. Indirection is as much the director's manner as it is the manner by which Anna is finally humiliated when the family frightens away her suitor.Mr. Voulgaris builds his film so carefully and quietly that it's only toward the end that one recognizes it to be a horror story not only about the members of one bourgeois family but also about the system that certifies them. Mr. Voulgaris, according to the museum's biographical notes, spent some months in prison last year before the overthrow of the government of the colonels. It's no great wonder.""The Engagement of Anna"" tells what seems like a very small story, about how the (probably sincere) love of the family for Anna, depicted in scenes of genuine tenderness, so quickly turns cruel and selfish when the family's order and ease are threatened. Conspiring in Anna's downfalland a lifetime sentence of domestic servitudeare her peasant mother and her own feelings of guiltsocial, sexual and religious.No one in ""The Engagement of Anna"" is even remotely aware of revolution, but that is what the film is calling for, in a voice that is so polite that you hear the real anger of the words only afterward.",1975-04-08T05:00:00+0000

It develops a thesis that stunsdemonstrating, as it tries to do, that first, Truman and Stalin cynically divided the postwar world into Soviet and American spheres of influence, while professing to do just the opposite; second, Churchill egged them on at every opportunity, reasoning that the greater the conflict between American and Soviet interests, the greater the opportunity to forge an AngloAmerican alliance; and third, that Truman not only dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki with the cynical purpose of intimidating Stalin, but also that he actually prolonged the war with Japan to do so. A shocking thesis and a dramatic demonstration of its development all rolled into one: how can one possibly complain about this account of the Potsdam conference written by a former editor of Horizon magazine?",1975-04-09T05:00:00+0000

Scores of people have been clamoring for tickets in the last few days.Some Muscovites who have seen the film predict that it is sure to be attacked for its unorthodoxy by the ideologically oriented critics of the official press. But in the first round of published reviews, in which some of Mr. Tarkovsky's fellow film makers evaluated his new work, there is much praise, tempered with criticism of some parts of the film.Unconcerned With AbuseIn the way he has created ""Mirror""using techniques familiar to viewers of Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman pictures, but not to many Soviet moviegoersMr. Tarkovsky seems to make it clear that he is unconcerned with the abuse he has taken for some of his earlier films. ""Andrei Rublev,"" the grim, realistic story of the 15th-century Russian monk and icon painter, was banned in this country for several years, although it won a Cannes Film Festival prize in 1970. Mr. Tarkovsky's science-fiction film, ""Solyaris,"" was criticized a few years ago as being too arcane and whimsical for the average audience to understand.""Mirror,"" a Mosfilm production, is not at all easy to understand, in the sense that it does not have the traditionally recognizable plot structure that is rarely tampered with by Soviet directors. There are flashbacks, slow-motion dream scenes, newsreels and a mixture of color for some sequences and black and white for others.The camera work of Georgi Rerberg on hazy countryside scenes and prolonged still-life shots of, for example, spilled milk or a spot of moisture evaporating on a shiny wood table fascinated viewers who saw the picture the first night it was shown here. Several Russians discussing the film later in the evening argued for various, interpretations of various scenes, but all agreed that parts of the movie produced a shock of self-recognition.Soul of One ManAs far as it can be summarized, the movie follows the course of the soul of one man, who narrates but is rarely seen on the screen. His relationship with his wife, his mother and his children and the society around him develops in events connected in his mind. How this connection is translated to the screen is what puzzles or delights the viewer, as he watches the hero's wife doubling in his mind as his mother.There are symbolic birds and fires and winds and rainfalls, and newsreels of a bullfight in Spain, Chinese agitators taunting Soviet soldiers at the border and Soviet soldiers tramping through mud. Stalin peers for a split-second from a poster into a print shop where a mistake might have been made. The hero's wife seems to long for him, but she kills him metaphorically by beheading a large white rooster.""Mirror,"" according to the criticism of several of Mr. Tarkovsky's fellow directors, will narrow his audience in the Soviet Union. It could increase his audience and his prestige in the West, if the Soviet authorities permit the film to be shown abroad.",1975-04-13T05:00:00+0000

While they concentrated on competing against each other instead of competing against the famous course itself, Nicklaus lost the fivestroke lead he had held after 36 holes and Palmer lost his status as a threat. Nicklaus dropped into second place by a stroke as Tom Weiskopf sculptured a sixunderpar 66 for 207 after 54 holes.

If the Government were first to collect this $80 to $90billion in the regular incometax sweep and then to disburse it again for these benefited activities, we would refer to the process as a subsidy.

The scenery is varied, often breathtaking. At Cannes there are long sandy beaches backed by resort hotels. On the Esterel drive between St. Raphael and La Napoule there are coves below red  rock cliffs.

Like its near cousin the murder mystery, the novel of espionage rests on a set of conventions that bring it closer to comedy than to any other literary genre. The readers' fascination for it, Deighton knows, is a function of our nostalgia for action or, put another way, for the child's world of moral clarity and guiltless intrigue. Plot dominated, the thriller deals with stock characters and a degree of happenstance and coincidence that with a twist here and a turn there could easily degenerate into buffoonery. Even the most credulous of readers has a great deal of disbelief to suspend; most important of all is that one knows from the start that although the hero may emerge with blood on his hands rather than custard cream on his face, he will remain fundamentally unscathed, springing back from near disaster like a Joe Palooka punching bag.",1975-04-13T05:00:00+0000

us,The poet as Oedipus,"For the production, study and enjoyment of literature there are central assumptions that rarely get examined, not always for want of critical energy, but for what seem to be commonsense reasons. Consider Milton as an example. He is the author of Paradise Lost; the textof that poem exists, it is read, it has been written about, and is itself about great events on earth, in heaven and hell. Readers of Milton assume that the text they read as by Milton is what is immovably before them on the page. Milton's date,s of birth and death, the textual history of his poetry; his fame and position in literature, even the meaning of his epic: all these are ascertainable by interpretive methods, perfected in the course of Western culture, that depend on the writer's presence in the culture. The whole enterprise of literature, and consequently of literary criticism, is to fix authors like Milton and his text ever more securely in the culture: the author and his text have sources, the author and his text have an influence on subsequent poets, but always we assume the abiding presence of a great author who has produced the great work.",1975-04-13T05:00:00+0000

When she tries to borrow money from the loan company to pay for an abortion, she explains that she wants a new stereo. Her application is turned down.Pierrette is older but equally unhappy. Her man has left her for a younger woman, so she drinks too much. Old Mme. Lauzon receives word that she has won a million trading stamps. At first she is skeptical and cross. Then she becomes almost unhinged with excitement.Hosanna, an aging transvestite who never successfully hides a five o'clock shadow, spends all day preparing for a drag ball where he'll appear as Cleopatra. Cuirette, Hosanna's roommate who fancies leather and chains, makes fun of Hosanna unmercifully.Everybody in ""Once Upon a Time in the East"" (II Etait une Fois Dans l'Est) dreams an impossible dream that is bound to come to no good end.More to the point of the film, everybody has a big scene, one of those front-and-center moments when he or she can attempt the movie equivalent of stopping the show. But movies, being movies, don't stop. Thus, would-be show-stopping moments tend to collect, to bunch up, like too many people trying to attract the attention of a single taxi on a rainy night.You've never seen as much acting as goes on from the start to the finish of Andr Brassard's French-Canadian film, which was screened Saturday at the Museum of Modern Art, as part of the New Directors/New Films series, and will be screened there again tonight at 8:30.""Once Upon a Time in the East,"" based on a screenplay by Michel Tremblay and Mr. Brassard, has its origins in plays written by Mr. Tremblay and staged with great success in Canada by Mr. Brassard. An English translation of one episode of this film was done on Broadway last fall under the title ""Hosanna.""Mr. Brassard and Mr. Tremblay have tried very hard to make a coherent film of all these actors doing what they do so well, but I, for one, could never forget that everyone was simply acting.""Once Upon a Time in the East"" has more busy moments than affecting ones. The characters all seem to be related to one another or, at least, to know one another, but there is very little sense of community in the movie.

Her psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Mandelbaum, advised Charles that she was nutty as a fruitcake, yet manageable with ups and downs from his medical kit and with a sanctum to retreat to when the madness welled up.

us,"Things Are Tough All Over, Yogi","Why did the Mets trade Tug McGraw away? one fan asked, posing a question which that lefthanded deity asked himself last December. Before anybody else could answer, another fan spoke up: To make us forget that they traded Nolan Ryan away. The resentment in his tone seemed unusually sharp for this early in the season. Ordinarily it takes more than five games to erode the optimism built up between seasons, even when four of the five games are lost. Evidently the clients are finding this year's defeats especially hard to take because the games have been lost in the late innings, calling attention to the poverty in Yogi Berra's bull pen. To be sure, McGraw hasn't yet thrown a ball on behalf of the Phillies and couldn't have given the Mets more than moral support, but if he were still wearing New York regimentals the fans could tell themselves that things would be better as soon as the Tugger got back. Now there seems to be a widespread feeling that trying to improve a fifthplace team by disposing of the star relief pitcher is like shooting a dog to rid him of fleas.",1975-04-16T05:00:00+0000

The weapons and the combatants change but everything remains basically the same. As old friends, such as Big Jim Colosimo (Frank Campanella), are mowed down, new ones, such as Frank Nitti (Sylvester Stallone), take their place. The movie requires a certain prior knowledge of the Chicago gang wars of the nineteen-twenties, which really aren't dramatized. Rather they are illustrated in a series of bloody tableaus, sometimes by anonymously driven vintage cars that pursue one another through Hollywood studio streets like robots possessed.""Capone"" which opened at Loews State 2 and Cine Theaters yesterday, was produced by today's King of the B's, Roger Corman, and written by Howard Browne, the two men who earlier collaborated on ""The St. Valentine's Day Massacre,"" which covered pretty much the same turf.This one, however, was directed by Steve Carver, who deals with the subject energetically, directly and completely without sentimentality, which is one of this unpretentious movie's small but remarkable virtues.Some of the other virtues are the performancesby Mr. Gazarra, who plays Al with the kind of boldness that risks giggles; Harry Guardino, as the gentle-natured gangster, Johnny Torrio, and Sylvester Stallone, as a new-style gangster who succeeds Al when the latter is nabbed on income tax evasion. John Cassavetes makes a token appearance as a New York mobster early in the film.""Capone"" is not great but it moves with cold efficiency, which is its style whether you like it or not.",1975-04-17T05:00:00+0000

Rain, sunshine; it's never mattered. Which is a pretty dumb attitude, I've now discovered from reading The Weather Machine: How Our Weather Works and Why It Is Changing, by Nigel Calder, the English science popularizer. After all, Mr. Calder explains half in earnest, it was because of. the atrociously wet summer in Switzerland in 1816 that Mary Shelley's mood turned gloomy and produced Frankenstein. After all, he explains more seriously, in northern France in 1788 May, June and July were excessively hot and the grain shriveled. On 13 July, just at harvest time, a severe hailstorm added to the losses of many farmers. From that bad harvest of 1788 came the bread riots of 1789, Marie Antoinette's alleged remark let them eat cake, and the storming of the Bastille. That's the sort of thing the weatherworriers are finding out these days. Mr. Calder doesn't mention why the herring left the Baltic Sea in the 17th century and thus helped to break up the Hanseatic League, but I'll bet the weather Was involved.

us,Book Ends,"Scandal. This season seems to have had more than its share of controversyshrouded books. Among the current titles much in the public eye that have had their basic credibility put in doubt are The Last Testament of. Lucky Luciano and The Bermuda Triangle. Attacks on the latter seem not to have hurt sales, since it still rides atop the Best Seller List; however, Charles Berlitz's book was ignored by critics until it became a phenomenonrather like an offBroadway musical that keeps playing previews without formally opening to reviewers. Lawrence David Kusche's refutationThe Bermuda Triangle MysterySolved (which was not written as a specific attack on the Berlitz cook)did not appear until March. Of course there is some question as to whether the true believers care about opposing arguments anyhow. Another ex post facto attack was recently launched against Harry Browne, author of You Can Profit From a Monetary Crisis, a doomandgloom book advocating the buying of gold, silver, Swiss francs and a fortified rural retreat, which had a long run on the Best Seller List. It seems that Mr. Browne was collecting commissions from a coin company he touted in his booksa company that has also been charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, they have their scandals too. Roy Medvedev, a leading Russian dissenter and historian, has charged that Mikhail Sholokhov did not write And Quiet Flows the Don, a classic of the late twenties that made Mr. Sholokhov a Soviet literary establishment figure. In a 125page essay, Mr. Medvedev noted that Mr. Sholokhov was only 20 when he allegedly wrote the hook and lacked the necessary historical and literary sophistication.

""Get out and take your mucous with you.""Madame is dressing for an evening on the town. She reviles Claire as she orders her about, fetching jewels and clothes. Madame insults Claire and Claire grovels with pleasure. When Claire has attempted to add a bit of polish to Madame's patent leather shoes, Madame sneers, ""Do you think I find it pleasant to know that my foot is shrouded by veils of your saliva?"" And Claire answers humbly, ""I wish Madame to be lovely.""When the alarm clock suddenly rings, the two women clutch each other. Madame says, ""Hurry. Madame will be back . . . It's over already and you didn't get to the end.""The end is the end of the ceremonial masquerade enacted by Claire and Solange, the title characters in Jean Genet's ""The Maids.""Whenever Madame is out of the posh apartment, Claire and her older sister Solange take over the premises for an elaborate ritual in which each takes turn playing Madame while the other sister plays the maid who is not herself: When Claire is Madame, Solange is Claire. The end they never get to is Madame's death by strangulation.This time, Solange (Glenda Jackson), who seems to be the stronger of the two, blames Claire (Susannah York), and Claire says rather wistfully, ""We waste too much time with the preliminaries.""The American Film Theater's film version of Mr. Genet's one-act play has been somewhat literalized by being ""opened up"" for the screen by Christopher Miles, the director. Madame's elegant digs now are recognizably across the Place Vendome from the Paris Ritz. Nothing much has been added by this information, nor by our being presented a sort of dumb-show behind the opening credits that tells us that Claire and Solange have written anonymous letters resulting in the arrest of Madame's young lover, a character who never is seen in the Genet play.Though nothing much has been added by this mildly cinematic treatment, it is more important that nothing has been lost. The film, which was shown at selected theaters yesterday and will be shown again today, is a fine, vivid recording of what seems to have been a smashing theater production of the play in London last year with Miss Jackson, Miss York and Vivien Merchant (as Madame).The film preserves the essential quality of the play, which is that of a series of performances designed not to tell a story or convince us of narrative truth, but to speculate on illusion, on the relationship between the looks of things and the reality. As is the inevitable case with Genet, illusion is the only reality, and reality is a lie or, you might say, an illusion.In his preface to the Grove Press paperback edition of ""The Maids,"" Jean-Paul Sartre has a good deal of ponderous fun going over this conundrum, which, at this point in history, seems a little schoolboyish and suggests nothing of the very real excitement of ""The Maids"" in performance.It is the surface of things that makes ""The Maids"" spellbinding (even through an arbitrary intermission that has been stuck into the one-act play). The film is carried by the furious interplay between Miss Jackson's Solange and Miss York's Claire, when they are playing what they call their ""scene,"" and then between the two maids and Madame, who renders Solange and Claire effectively impotent by her casual kindnesses, by her insistence on recognizing as tokens of love the presents they have given her in hatred.Although ""The Maids"" is composed of role-playing, it is not a drama of identity as Antonioni's ""The Passenger"" is.

For the very exercise of shaping a whale's impression of the world into human language would seem to smack of anthropomorphism. And such phrases as How splendid to be blue whale! and Oh, this was terrible weather in which to be horn! would seem to evoke the sort of pipesmoking, oldbeforehistime leviathan one mightn't especially want to know even if whales could talk. Yet the risk that Miss Carrighar takes is a calculated one. For empathy is what she demands for the giant creatures she writes aboutcreatures that have been so beleaguered and harassed by human marauders that their numbers have diminished to the danger point and their very urge to reproduce themselves has begun to wane. And since human beings seem able to empathize only when they recognize themselves in the Other, Miss Carrighar has made her whales as human as scientifically possible.",1975-04-25T05:00:00+0000

Despite a sincere, polished treatment, this delving into the dark, sex-ridden??? tragic previous life of Peter Proud generates clouds of suspense but no solid solution to the riddle of reincarnation.""Suppose you Knew who you had been in your previous life . . . what then?"" the film's blurb enticingly asks. The answer, now that the results are in??? would be to let bygones be bygones.J. Lee Thompson, who directed in a properly moody style, and Max Ehrlich, who wrote the script from his novel, adhere to the trappings of current parapsychology, dream research and the like to give their mystery ??? scientific patina. But it isn't science as much as a persistent nightmare that drives Peter Proud, a young college professor, to seek surcease from his bad dream.The trip takes him from his California campus to an upper-class suburban Massachusetts town of his nocturnal??? frightening visions, where he discovers that??? in the nineteen-forties??? he had been Jeff Curtis, World War??? If hero, the father of an infant daughter, and who was murdered by his anguished wife for his callou???s indiscretions.It should be noted that Peter Proud is plagued enough to fall in love and have an affair with a now grown, beautiful daughter of the late, unlamented Jeff Curtis???a sort of incest, once removed???and to pursue his investigation to a macabre and fatal ending.Michael Sarrazin is fairly sensitive and generally subdued as Peter Proud, a name, he admits lightly, that sounds like a nursery jingle. Margot Kidder does well by the unlikely roles of the young wife and the anxiety-filled hard-drinking mother whose murderous secret is finally exposed. And Jennifer O'Neill, as the surviving daughter, and Cornelia Sharpe, as Mr. Sarrazin's college pal, are genuinely confused by the mystery that distracts their lover.Peter Proud, in short, utters a logical mouthful about this ""reincarnation"" when he tells the worried Miss O'Neill.

us,'Monty Python and the Holy Grail',"A foolish constancy is the hobgoblin of little minds and of some movie critics (who may or may not have little minds) when writing about the films of comedians.In his own day, poor old W. C. Fields was always being rapped for not making movies that were as funny, from start to finish, as his adoring critics found bits of them to be. I'm afraid that once or twice I've gone so far as to suggest that a certain film by Woody Allen or Mel Brooks hasn't been consistently funny, that is, that there were some parts that weren't as funny as other parts. However, as any surveyor of anything will tell you, you can't have a high spot unless you have a low one from which to survey it.All of which is a round about way of saying that ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" has some low spots but that anyone at all fond of the members of this brilliant British comedy groupwhich more or less justifies Sunday night television in New Yorkshouldn't care less.""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema 2, is a marvelously particular kind of lunatic endeavor. It's been collectively written by the Python troupe and jointly directed by two of them (Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones) so effectively that I'm beginning to suspect that there really aren't six of them but only one, a fellow with several dozen faces who knows a great deal about trick photography.Unlike ""And Now for Something Completely Different,"" which was a collection of sketches from ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" television show, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is what is known on Broadway as a ""book show.""It has a story with an approximate beginning, an approximate middle and it ends, or perhaps I should say that it stops after a while. To be more specific, it's the Python troupe's version of the legend of King Arthur and the search for the holy grail, with no apologies at all to Malory though it manages to send up the legend, courtly love, fidelity, bravery, costume movies, movie violence and ornithology.Graham Chapman plays Arthur, the film's major continuing character, with the earnest optimism of a 19th-century missionary, who's doomed to fail but refuses to acknowledge the fact. The other members of the Python team turn up in a variety of rolesRound Table knights, snobbish French aristocrats, irritable serfs, mythical monsters and, in one case, as a noble son named Alice who tries to turn the film into an operetta.The gags are nonstop, occasionally inspired and should not be divulged, though it's not giving away too much to say that I particularly liked a sequence in which the knights, to gain access to an enemy castle, come up with the idea of building a Trojan rabbit. When Arthur calls retreat, he simply yells: ""Run away!"" And the morale of Sir Robin, the least successful of the Round Table knights, isn't helped by a retinue of minstrels who insist on singing about his most embarrassing defeats.I have no idea whether Mr. Gilliam and Mr. Jones have seen Robert Bresson's rather more austere film, ""Lancelot of the Lake,"" which was shown at last year's New York Film Festival, but there are times when ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" seems to be putting on Mr. Bresson unmercifully. The dour lighting and landscapes that are so important in the Bresson film are tossed into this comedy without apparent thought for the havoc they do ""Lancelot."" Mr. Bresson's emphasis on what you might call the sound of knighthood (clanking armor, horses' hoofs) is also hilariously parodied, as well as the violence of the age, on which the Python people have the last bleeding word.Everyone interested in Mr. Bresson would do well to stay away from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" until after they see ""Lancelot."" The comparison, which may never have been intended, is nevertheless lethal to the work of the great French director.",1975-04-28T05:00:00+0000

The author suggests that American publishers shied away from it because it contains too many political jabs, beginning with a jab at a Catholic President. I would suggest that they ignored it because it was already dated in 1961 and not very funny anyway. Now, of course, everything is changed.

us,Film: 'Bobby and Rose':Le Mat and Dianne Hull Run Afoul of Life,"""Aloha, Bobby and Rose,"" which opened yesterday at the Columbia 2 Theater, is a sentimental, noisy, very bad movie about a young Los Angeles couple whom Floyd Mutrux, the director and writer of the screen play, describes as star-crossed though they seem less star-crossed than accident-prone.Bobby (Paul Le Mat) and Rose (Dianne Hull) get into trouble when a clerk is fatally shot while Bobby is pretending to stick up a liquor store. The only tragic thing in a film like this is the quality of stupidity the characters are forced to exhibit in order to keep the plot going.Although the story is contemporary, the film opens with Artie Shaw's classic ""Begin the Beguine"" playing on the soundtrack. Thereafter, the director does his best to stir up a little nostalgia for what actually is last week. ""Aloha, Bobby and Rose"" wants to have it eight different ways at once.The film is full of what seem to be witting references to that harmless nineteen-sixties binge, ""American Graffiti,"" which also starred Mr. Le Mat. Much of ""Aloha, Bobby and Rose"" was photographed in and around Los Angeles, in its streets, driveins and filling stations, a lot of the time at night.William A. Fraker, a very good cameraman with the right director, over-indulges a fancy for shooting directly into headlights, sunrises and sunsets, resulting in more halos than you would ever see at a convention of saints.In claptrap of this order it's impossible to judge fairly lead performances that are so much a part of the method of the film. In subsidiary roles Tim McIntire and Leigh French are appealing as a pair of good-natured, free-spending Texans who, briefly, befriend dim-witted Bobby and dopey Rose.",1975-04-30T05:00:00+0000
