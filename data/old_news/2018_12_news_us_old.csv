But in Los Angeles and Hawaii, theyll evidently wait hours for tsukemen, a style of ramen invented in Tokyo that involves serving the noodles and broth in separate bowls so you can dip one into the other. Its not new in New York; Masaharu Morimotos Momosan in Midtown Manhattan serves it. But its the showcase item at this compact new spot in the East Village, co-owned by Tomotsugu Kubo, who worked at the Tsujita restaurants, tsukemen hotspots in Los Angeles, and who was head chef at one of them. In New York, Mr. Kubo says he will take up to 60 hours to simmer his broth to deep perfection. The noodles are thicker than garden-variety ramen, the better to sop up the soup, and additions like eggs, pork belly, spinach and dried seaweed can dress up the meal. Regular ramen bowls are also served. Donburi rice bowls topped with sashimi or fried chicken, among other options, are also on the lineup, along with appetizers like crisp chicken skin, braised pork belly, edamame and pickles. The focus of the room is a large counter with seating on three sides. ",2018-12-04T17:24:32+0000

For example, Directive is one of Robert Frosts two or three greatest poems, but it was first published in his 1947 collection Steeple Bush, which is otherwise generously laden with cornpone. So how good is Steeple Bush, then? Can a single astonishing ingredient redeem an otherwise unremarkable dish? By the same token, should a collection that is consistently accomplished (but no more than that) be considered more worthy than an uneven book with a few genuinely arresting pages? When were evaluating books of poems, a great deal depends on which noun  books or poems  we think should be stressed.",2018-12-10T19:00:03+0000

Due diligence in acquiring an antiquity requires, at a minimum, documentation of where it was discovered in modern times and its subsequent movements across national borders. Applying those standards is not always easy and, at least until recently, often not undertaken with appropriate thoroughness. There is, though, a notable exception: the J.

Innocence and violence are the poles of this debut collection about the Columbine school shooting, where even lipstick tubes call to mind gun barrels and where children, like flowers, are beautiful, then die. ANAGNORISIS By Kyle Dargan. (Northwestern University, paper, $18.) Dargans fifth collection takes its title from the literary term for a moment of sudden recognition. Here, it amounts almost to resignation  about the countrys racist brutality, as in a poem called Death Toll, which opens: This road has surely paid for itself by now, / but lets toss some more bullets in the bucket. WHO IS MARY SUE? By Sophie Collins. (Faber & Faber, paper, $16.) Part literary criticism, part feminist manifesto, this debut by an Edinburgh poet uses quotations, aphorisms and verse to explode the archetype of the Mary Sue, as shes known in the world of fan fiction; the closest analog would be the manic pixie dream girl, too good to be true. THE GILDED AUCTION BLOCK By Shane McCrae. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) This book, McCraes sixth, seems a direct response to the 2016 election; many of its poems begin with the word America and one, Everything I Know About Blackness I Learned From Donald Trump, opens America I was driving when I heard you / Had died I swerved into a ditch and wept. SO FAR SO GOOD By Ursula K. Le Guin. (Copper Canyon, $23.) Le Guin died at the beginning of 2018, and this posthumous book is preoccupied with spare musings on age and mortality.

But the arrival of the chef and restaurateur Tom Colicchio at the Roosevelt Field shopping center in Nassau County definitely ups the ante. His new restaurant, a case study in attention to detail from design to dessert, would not be out of place in an urban setting. Bentel & Bentel, the architects based in nearby Locust Valley that designed Mr. Colicchios Craft along with Gramercy Tavern and Le Bernardin, have given this new restaurant, on a premium corner in the center, a sophisticated farmhouse look. Theres a big barroom with lights hung from vintage orchard ladders, and a bigger dining room with country-style spindle-back chairs facing the open kitchen. Asked why hes opening a restaurant there, Mr. Colicchio said that people everywhere want good food. Im testing this market, he said. I think the future is in opening a restaurant thats not typical in an area like this. The menu, created by Mr. Colicchio, is in the hands of Thomas Chang, the chef de cuisine. It is rustic American, strongly farm-to-table (farms are about an hour away), with dishes like Honeycrisp apples with delicata squash and country ham; mussels in white wine cream with fennel and turmeric; grilled squid with chickpeas, celery and Aleppo pepper; grilled swordfish with white beans and oven-roasted tomatoes; and smoked short ribs with polenta. Claudia Fleming, an owner of North Fork Table who was the pastry chef at Gramercy Tavern, is overseeing the desserts. Mr. Colicchio expects to have local wines, beers and spirits on the drinks list.

Several enormous sculptures punctuate the plaza: faceless heads with bizarre hair wrought in brass, iron and steel. Against the green hills of Tuscany and the imposing white marble church, they look like the remains of a Dadaist prank. Around the plazas edges, tourists and locals congregate in cafes for morning cappuccini and evening aperitivi. This fall, the 57-year-old Mexican film director Alfonso Cuarn, whose youngest child attends school in Pietrasanta, met me there for endless cups of green tea. At a distance, walking through the square in a hoodie and black sneakers, cellphone pressed against his head, Cuarn looked like a middle-aged skater.

The councils goal was to prevent their Swiss neighbors from claiming the mountains glory, but there was really no need: Its impossible when youre in Chamonix to ignore the gargantuan, icy beauty that looms overhead. And, as in any good mountain resort town, the adrenaline rush promised by the surrounding slopes fuels a sense of revelry and indulgence in the valley below. Perhaps nowhere else is this dynamic so evident as in Chamonix, where you can wander through a landscape that feels as wild and harsh as the moon, then, half an hour later, soak in a Jacuzzi under the stars. Chamonix is a glorious place for visitors, especially in winter, when the town and its mountains are cloaked in snow.

Im saying, rather, a kind of louche, very likable but humbler deal: a sandwich. With domestic farmed caviar, spooned between two thin pieces of white toast, with boiled egg and crme frache and chopped scallions in there, too, for an affordable, but luscious and haute, lowbrow sandwich.

For three decades now, Yasumasa Morimura has scrutinized the premises of Japanese identity through photographic restagings of European paintings, performances as western and Japanese figures and, most recently, the opening of a museum in his hometown, Osaka. Sometimes he gets too jokey, too direct. But his best work, as proved by a surprising exhibition at Japan Society, reveals the self as a rickety thing, and national identity as even more fragile.

us,Meet Brut I.P.A.,"Its taken a little over a year for Brut I.P.A., a new style of India Pale Ale, to sweep through the craft-brewing community. The name is a reference to brut, a dry Champagne. By all accounts, it was created by Kim Sturdavant, the brewmaster of Social Kitchen and Brewery in San Francisco, who used amyloglucosidase, or AMG, to remove the sugars in an I.P.A. AMG is an enzyme usually added to make light beers and to balance big beers like imperial stouts. Some New York brewers  including Sixpoint, Five Boroughs, Greenpoint, and Ommegang in central New York  are now making Brut I.P.A.s. Sam Adams introduced its Brut I.P.A. in June, and it also makes a ros Brut I.P.A. There are now hundreds of them being made nationwide. Stylistically, there are variations in flavor, color and texture, but most are crisp, light and somewhat citric. A glass of the bubbly, golden Brut I.P.A. would not be out of place for a toast at the ball drop. Theyre the opposite of juicy, sweet New England I.P.A.s, said Kevin Brooks, the manager of the Lower East Side beer store Top Hops, which carries several Brut I.P.A.s. With national brands like Ommegang, youll see them everywhere; its a new all-American style, said Chris Chou-Messina, who is the director of craft innovation at Anheuser-Busch. Ms. Chou-Messina will lead a class in Brut I.P.A. at Top Hops on March 12.",2018-12-21T16:45:05+0000

This Time, Its a Taqueria.","Thomas Keller, the world-famous chef and restaurateur, is adding to his busy portfolio in Yountville, Calif., in the Napa Valley with a casual taqueria. He had the opportunity to take over a local fixture, Hurleys restaurant, when its owner decided to retire. Its a beautiful location, Mr. Keller said. But I didnt know what to do with it, so I thought about what the town needed. Yountville already had Italian, French and American restaurants, including Mr. Kellers French Laundry, but Asian and Mexican were missing. He decided on Mexican, a cuisine he has never explored, and contacted Susana Trilling, a food writer who has a cooking school and inn in Oaxaca, Mexico. It turned out that her son, Kaelin Ulrich Trilling, who was born and raised in Oaxaca, was a chef and had even been doing consulting in New York. We saw eye-to-eye, Mr. Keller said. Mr. Trilling, 26, got the job and traveled throughout Mexico before opening the restaurant. Though his menu is fairly simple, it includes various regional specialties, like an assortment of moles, often made from chiles and spices imported from Mexico. Tortillas are made from corn ground and nixtamalized in-house. Were making them by hand; we expect to hand-press 700 to 800 a day, he said. Tacos feature braised short-rib barbacoa, roasted pork al pastor and slow-cooked pork carnitas. Marinated wood-grilled fish and wood-grilled skirt steak are also offered. The restaurant is decorated with pieces from Mexican artisans. We have to respect the traditions, Mr. Trilling said. The name is that of a celebratory parade and feast frequently held in Oaxaca.

It includes all sorts of fanciful, surrealistic stories with invented or hoped-for bodily functions, like one in which men insert tampons into their urethras, or The Double, in which the Julie protagonist happily turns into a man, only to later encounter the prior female self as a separate body.

us,Bad Weather Leads to a New Olive Oil,"Extreme weather conditions led the California Olive Ranch in Chico, Calif., to take the unusual step of making a line of California extra-virgin olive oils blended with oils from other countries. The Destination Series  Everyday, Mild & Buttery and Rich & Robust  was created to convey the same flavor profiles as the companys previous 100 percent California oils, which had the same names as these new blends. The move offsets a harvest that Gregg Kelley, the companys chief executive, called a disaster because of the unseasonably cold winter of 2017-18. Collaborations with growers in Argentina, Chile and Portugal were developed several years ago in anticipation of olive harvest problems. The company blended the oil with the aim of not letting any regions characteristics dominate, though Mr. Kelley said at least 26 percent of the oil in each bottle is from California, making it the largest component by just a shade. The oils are reasonably priced, like the ones they replace, and pleasant but hardly distinctive, with the one called Everyday the most useful for many cooking purposes. The company still makes more expensive 100 percent California oils.",2018-12-31T18:42:38+0000

The restaurant, named for the intrepid women who dive for seafood near Jeju Island in South Korea, opened in late November. Fish and assorted seafood are significant components on the menu, which Ms. Kwak oversees as chef. Do Hwa and Ms. Kwaks original restaurant, Dok Sunis in the East Village, helped expose Western palates to Korean food beyond the Seoul-centric enclave of restaurants on West 32nd Street. Here, in an understated, graciously lit dining room, she gives her food refreshing touches, like topping grilled oysters with seaweed butter and parking brioche toast alongside, and adding chorizo to a rice cake.
