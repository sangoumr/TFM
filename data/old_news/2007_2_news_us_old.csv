He eventually accepted a bid of $37,375 to wear a temporary tattoo of the SnoreStop logo for 30 days, went on to start a Web site (humanadspace.com) and encouraged others to sell out too. Mr. Fischer may not have started a movement but he has inspired a play. Billboard, by Michael Vukadinovich, uses the premise as a springboard to examine art, commercialism, love and the nexus of all three. I had these questions about art versus advertising and how much art has sold out, Mr. Vukadinovich said in a telephone interview. And I wanted to explore them in the context of a relationship. In the play Andy (Ken Matthews, center above) is paid a lot of money to wear a tattoo on his forehead for the fictional company Questa for a year, but his girlfriend, Katelyn (Sarah K. Lippmann, right), is not amused. At least not until she finds a way to use it, and him, to her advantage. Joey Piscopo (yes, the comedians son and the creator of the solo show Joe Piscopos Son), left, is the goofy best friend. The shows director, Tania Inessa Kirkman, and her design team have created a set that enthusiastically embraces commercialism by including a slew of obvious (but nonpaid) product placements, commercials for everything from Red Bull to Campbells Soup that play during intermission and corporate logos, made of light, dancing across the stage floor. To see Billboard is to be bombarded with advertising, but aint that America?

us,Chirac's First Interview on Iran,"Following are excerpts from an interview with President Jacques Chirac of France with The New York Times, the International Herald Tribune and Le Nouvel Observateur on January 29, 2007. The interview was conducted in French and recorded and transcribed by The New York Times. Q: Monsieur le Prsident, vous avez parl tout  l'heure de l'nergie nuclaire. Quelles sont les possibilits de l'nergie nuclaire dans l'avenir, surtout pour les pays mergents, un pays comme l'Iran par exemple ? A: Je voudrais dire qu'il y a d'abord deux problmes diffrents: c'est l'lectronuclaire et le nuclaire militaire. Ce qui nous inquite en Iran, ce n'est pas l'lectronuclaire. C'est le nuclaire militaire, l'enrichissement de l'uranium. C'est a qui nous inquite. C'est le refus de l'Iran d'accepter les contraintes de l'AIEA et donc d'arrter d'enrichir l'uranium. C'est trs dangereux. Il faut y faire trs attention. Je dirais que ce n'est pas tellement dangereux par le fait d'avoir une bombe nuclaire - une, peut-tre une deuxime un peu plus tard, ce n'est pas trs dangereux. Mais ce qui est trs dangereux c'est la prolifration. a veut dire que si l'Iran poursuit son chemin et matrise totalement la technique lectronuclaire, le danger n'est pas dans la bombe qu'il va avoir, et qui ne lui servira  rien. Il va l'envoyer o, cette bombe ? Sur Isral ? Elle n'aura pas fait 200 mtres dans l'atmosphre que Thran sera rase. Ce qui est dangereux c'est la prolifration. Il est quand mme trs tentant pour d'autres pays qui ont de gros moyens financiers, dans cette rgion, de dire "" Eh bien, nous aussi, on va le faire. On va aider d'autres  le faire "". Pourquoi est-ce que l'Arabie Saoudite ne le ferait pas ? Pourquoi n'aiderait elle pas l'Egypte  le faire galement ? C'est a le danger. Donc il faut trouver un moyen de rgler ce problme. Alors a, c'est le nuclaire militaire. Q: Jusqu'o les Occidentaux peuvent-ils aller dans la menace de sanctions contre l'Iran, sans risquer de reprsailles, notamment sur le Liban aussi ? A: Ce n'est pas tout  fait le sujet de notre entretien. J'ai pour le Liban les sentiments que vous connaissez, je ne suis pas suspect. Comment peut-on faire en ralit, c'est la question, pour imposer des contraintes suffisamment fortes  l'Iran ? Alors, c'est difficile. Il faut savoir ce que l'Iran peut supporter ou non. L'Iran [] a un rgime qui est tout de mme un peu fragile. Un peu fragile. Et les dernires lections ont prouv en particulier que le prsident n'avait pas toute l'autorit que l'on pouvait escompter. Ce rgime un peu fragile a peur. A peur de quoi ? A peur d'tre contest. Qu'est ce qu'il veut ? Il veut maintenir le rgime des mollahs. Pour maintenir le rgime des mollahs, il faut qu'il ne soit pas contest ou menac par la communaut internationale. Et la communaut internationale, c'est qui ? C'est les Etats-Unis. Alors quelle est la part, dans la raction de l'Iran, quelle est la part de dsir d'avoir la matrise du nuclaire militaire et le dsir d'avoir la reconnaissance de la communaut internationale et notamment des Etats-Unis de faon  viter de mauvaises surprises susceptibles  un moment ou  un autre de dstabiliser le rgime des mollahs ? C'est une question difficile, parce que les chiites sont des gens trs particuliers. Oui, il [Jrme Bonnafont, spokesman of the Elyse] me dit qu'il faut revenir  l'environnement. Les chiites sont des gens trs particuliers. Les chiites, depuis l'origine, sont des gens qui ont une culture de minoritaires. Ce sont des minoritaires, ils ont une culture de minoritaires. Ils n'ont pas la raction des Sunnites ou des Europens. [] Q: Mais est-ce qu'il y a un dilemme fondamental dans ce monde o on est,  un moment donn, o il faut rduire les missions de carbone, donc l'lectronuclaire est trs important surtout dans les puissances comme l'Inde et la Chine, mais en mme temps on vit dans un monde o le terrorisme et la prolifration sont une inquitude majeure. Et tous les experts disent A: [] Aucun expert ne dit qu'il y a un rapport entre l'lectronuclaire et la bombe nuclaire []. Ce sont deux choses, deux technologies compltement diffrentes. Tout notre problme avec l'Iran que l'on voquait tout a l'heure, c'est parce que l'Iran veut, par l'enrichissement de l'uranium, faire une bombe nuclaire. Mais avec l'lectronuclaire, vous n'avez aucun moyen de passer  la bombe. Il n'y a aucun risque. L'AIEA qui surveille a. Il y a un contrle. Il n'y a aucun risque. Q: Il n'y a aucun risque ? A: Aucun, strictement aucun. Vous ne pouvez pas prendre une centrale nuclaire lectrique pour faire une bombe. a, a ne marche pas. Q: Donc la technologie de l'enrichissement de l'uranium, parce que c'est une question de  A: C'est l'enrichissement de l'uranium, dans des conditions d'ailleurs trs particulires et contrles par l'AIEA. L'AIEA inspecte en permanence pour s'apercevoir qu'en douce on ne fait pas de l'enrichissement. Mais l'enrichissement ne sert  rien pour l'lectronuclaire. Non, il n'y a pas de rapport entre les deux.

us,Text (French): Chiracs Second Interview on Iran,"Following are excerpts from an interview with President Jacques Chirac of France with The New York Times, the International Herald Tribune and Le Nouvel Observateur on January 30, 2007. The interview was conducted in French and recorded and transcribed by The New York Times.A: Je voulais donc vous dire un peu comment je voyais rellement le problme de l'Iran. L'Iran a engag une action, une procdure que l'AIEA considre comme de nature  conduire vers une technologie, la matrise d'une technologie militaire, une technologie atomique militaire. Bon, ceci vous le savez est contraire aux engagements de l'Iran qui est signataire du TNP. Le TNP c'est le trait de non-prolifration qui a t sign par l'Iran. Il y a donc de la part de l'Iran une mise en cause des engagements qu'il a pris, d'o les travaux qui ont t faits par l'AIEA qui ont constat, considr que l'enrichissement de l'uranium tait de nature  conduire vers une technologie militaire, lectro-militaire. Et que par consquent, il y avait l quelque chose qui n'tait pas normal ni acceptable. A partir de l, les grands pays se sont consults, notamment les six grands pays, c'est--dire les trois pays europens - la France, l'Allemagne et l'Angleterre - et d'autre part les Etats-Unis, et puis la Russie et la Chine. L'objectif tant d'exposer  l'Iran qu'il se mettait dans une situation qui n'tait pas conforme  la loi internationale et que par consquent il devait interrompre l'enrichissement nuclaire et tout ce qui concernait une technologie militaire, sur le plan nuclaire. [] L'Iran qui est tout de mme une grande nation et une nation importante qui compte []. Nous avons expliqu  l'Iran qu'il ne pouvait pas se mettre dans cette situation, et que par consquent il nous fallait discuter, ngocier pour obtenir l'interruption de l'enrichissement de l'uranium, l'enrichissement de l'uranium tant le symbole, en quelque sorte, le cur d'une technologie militaire nuclaire. Nous avons pens en ralit que l'on pourrait discuter. Je rappelle que la France d'ailleurs a fait une proposition qui tait une proposition ouverte  l'Iran en lui disant - ne mettant pas en cause l'autorit de l'Iran - mais en disant "" voil, nous allons, vous allez prendre la dcision vous-mme comme vous l'entendez d'interrompre provisoirement l'enrichissement de l'uranium, et les six pays vont en change prendre la dcision d'interrompre les procdures, les procdures de sanctions au sein du Conseil de Scurit de l'ONU "". C'tait tout de mme, je crois, honntement, une position qui tait convenable, dans le sens qu'on disait  l'Iran, "" le jour o vous voulez reprendre, vous reprenez, et nous nous reprendrons les procdures de sanction "". Chacun faisait un pas dans la direction de l'autre, et nous avions pens que c'tait l une procdure qui pouvait tre accepte compte tenu des exigences iraniennes. En fait, les Iraniens n'ont pas accept cette procdure. Ils n'ont pas accept d'interrompre leur travail d'enrichissement de l'uranium, et par voie de consquence les Six ont poursuivi leur action, leur action au Conseil de Scurit conduisant  des sanctions qui dans un premier temps sont des sanctions qui touchent, en ralit, ce qui concerne les approvisionnements, ou les exportations en matire de nuclaire militaire de l'Iran, importations ou exportations, et les sanctions ont donc t prises par la rsolution 1737 du Conseil de Scurit. A partir de l, nous nous trouvons dans une situation qui est quand mme confuse. Alors bien entendu on peut procder en allant de plus en plus loin, de plus en plus haut dans les ractions de chaque ct. Ce n'est certainement pas notre pense et notre intention. Ce que nous souhaitions c'est d'arriver  un rsultat, celui que j'ai voqu tout  l'heure, qui soit conforme aux engagements du TNP et conforme aux contrles de l'AIEA. Dans l'tat actuel des choses, nous n'avons pas de rponse positive de la part de l'Iran, alors j'ai dit - c'tait un peu une manire schmatique de parler - j'ai dit "" mais au fond quand on pense  l'Iran,  quoi peut lui servir une bombe ""? Si vritablement l'objectif de l'Iran c'est de se doter d'une puissance nuclaire - c'est--dire d'une bombe nuclaire - il est vident que cette bombe,  partir du moment o elle serait lance, serait  l'vidence mme immdiatement dtruite. On a les moyens, beaucoup de pays ont les moyens de dtruire une bombe, enfin d'observer le lancement d'une bombe et de la fuse qui la porte et de dtruire cette bombe. Donc on ne voit pas trs bien quel est l'avantage que pourrait trouver l'Iran dans une action consistant  lancer une bombe. Elle serait dtruite videmment  peine lance. C'est tout de mme un lment important. Q: Elle serait dtruite, la bombe ? A: La bombe serait dtruite, oui. Q: Et quelles seraient les rpercussions sur l'Iran ? A: Alors les rpercussions sur l'Iran devraient tre examines, naturellement. J'ai eu un mot rapide, et que je retire naturellement, quand j'ai dit "" on va raser Thran "". C'tait videmment une boutade dans mon esprit. Je n'imagine pas que l'on puisse raser Thran. Mais il est vident que si un acte agressif indiscutable, c'est--dire l'envoi d'une bombe par une fuse porteuse, avait lieu et cette bombe serait- je le rpte - automatiquement dtruite avant mme d'avoir quitt le sol iranien ou en tout cas le ciel iranien, il est vident qu'il y aurait sans aucun doute des mesure de coercition, des mesures de rtorsion, forcment. a fait partie de la dissuasion nuclaire. Il y aurait forcment des rtorsions. [] [Dire] qu'on allait dtruire Thran n'a pas de sens mais ce qui a un sens c'est que dans la dissuasion nuclaire, il y a forcment des initiatives prises en cas d'attaque nuclaire qui sont  examiner,  ngocier qui relvent de l'autorit des pays qui s'estiment,  tort ou  raison. Agresss. Q: Y compris une rtorsion de type nuclaire ? A: Tout est possible [] La thorie de la dissuasion nuclaire, c'est la dissuasion qui permet d'agresser, de contre-agresser un agresseur nuclaire qui se serait manifest. Voil donc le premier problme. Le deuxime problme concerne videmment la prolifration. Le grand danger de cette opration de l'Iran c'est la prolifration. Chacun sait qu'il y a des pays qui ont dj accd au stade nuclaire et qui incontestablement ont particip au dveloppement de la prolifration. Je ne citerai pas de pays. C'est inutile mais on le sait, mme l'Iran a bnfici de la comptence, des connaissances de la technologie de certains pays dans le domaine nuclaire. Donc la prolifration est quelque chose de dangereux, alors  partir du moment o l'Iran serait en mesure d'accder  une technologie militaire nuclaire, il deviendrait ipso facto un centre potentiel de prolifration ce qui serait extrmement dangereux pour toute la rgion. Je me suis laiss aller parce que je croyais qu'on tait en "" off ""  dire que, par exemple, l'Arabie Saoudite ou l'Egypte pourrait tre tentes de suivre cet exemple, je retire naturellement car ni l'Arabie Saoudite ni l'Egypte n'ont fait la moindre dclaration sur ces sujets donc ce n'est pas  moi de les faire. [] Ce qui est certain c'est qu'une telle procdure conduit  une course aux armements qui peut conduire un certain nombre de pays  essayer de participer  cette course aux armements. Je ne veux citer aucun pays naturellement, mme si je l'ai fait hier, je n'aurais pas d le faire. [] Q: Dans la rgion ? A: Dans la rgion et peut-tre au-del. [] Il y a un deuxime risque qui est galement extrmement srieux qui est le risque de prolifration car mme sans utiliser une bombe qu'ils auraient cre, ils peuvent transfrer  d'autres pays pour des raisons politiques des technologie qui permettraient  ces autres pays d'accder eux-mmes  une technologie militaire nuclaire. [] L'Iran est tout de mme un grand pays. C'est un pays qui a une tradition, qui est un pays complexe, qui a une trs vieille culture. [] L'Iran a forcement un rle important  jouer dans la rgion du Moyen Orient. Cette rgion a t traumatise par l'affaire irakienne. L'affaire irakienne a boug les ligne rouges, en ralit, de la rgion et elle a cr une situation nouvelle. Elle est devenue dangereuse, la rgion, plus vulnrable et par consquent, l'Iran a indiscutablement aujourd'hui un rle important - compte tenu de son histoire, de sa tradition, de sa philosophie - un rle important  jouer dans la rgion  condition naturellement de le jouer dans un sens pacifique et de cordialit. Voil ce que je voulais vous dire essentiellement sur l'Iran, j'ai hier t un peu rapide. [] Le problme de l'actualit, de mon point de vue, c'est celui de l'environnement. De l'Iran, nous aurons hlas malheureusement probablement beaucoup l'occasion d'en parler. [] Q: Hier, honntement, vous aviez pu donner le sentiment, en tout cas le propos pouvait prter  confusion, dans la mesure o vous disiez aussi que l'Iran pouvait possder une premire bombe, et peut tre une deuxime, pour vous c tait une manire de dire : le problme c'est la prolifration. Vous avez voqu l'ventualit qu'elle puisse attaquer Isral, ce qui semblait un peu presque secondaire. A: Je ne peux pas imaginer cela. Je ne peux pas imaginer cela. Je rpte, les moyens de protection qui existent dans le monde, notamment chez les Amricains mais galement chez les Europens, un certain nombre d'Europens, sont tels que je n'imagine pas qu'une bombe, qu'une fuse porteuse d'une bombe puisse voler de l'Iran sans qu'on s'en aperoive. Et que par consquent, elle serait forcment dtruite. Donc a, je ne crois pas avoir parl d'Isral hier. Peut tre l'ai-je fait mais je ne le crois pas, je n'en ai pas le souvenir. [] Q: M. le Prsident il y a certaines questions qu'on vous avait poses, et vous n'avez pas souhait rpondre, et vous nous l'avez dit, tout  fait courtoisement d'ailleurs. A: Oui, mais je ne voulais pas abuser ni de votre temps ni du mien. Ce qu'il faut que vous sachiez, c'est que la France considre que l'Iran est un lment essentiel de la stabilit de toute cette rgion, un lment essentiel et naturellement cette stabilit sera fonction de la politique que mnera l'Iran. Je ne sais pas exactement - il y a actuellement en Iran des discussions, chacun le sait, au sein mme des autorits iraniennes, pour savoir quelle est exactement la politique que doit suivre l'Iran. Je n'ai pas  porter de jugement sur ce point. Mais c'est un fait, bon. Il y a mme eu des lections qui ont donn - qui ont remis un peu en cause l'autorit du prsident Ahmadinejad. Il faut dire que les propos - a je vous le dit tout  fait du fond du cur - que ce prsident Ahmadinejad a tenus sur Isral sont  mes yeux et aux yeux de la France et aux yeux certainement du monde entier totalement inacceptables. D'ailleurs je l'ai dit aux Iraniens. Ce sont des propos totalement inacceptables, et qui ne peuvent par consquent tre accepts. J'espre simplement qu'il s'agit de propos un peu individuels et qui ne correspondent pas  la conception des choses des principaux dirigeants. Je n'en sais rien, et je les condamne totalement, et je l'ai dit aux Iraniens de la faon la plus claire. Quand je suis all  New York, le Prsident Ahmadinejad m'a demand un rendez-vous. J'ai refus, pour le principe, parce que je ne pouvais pas accepter de recevoir ou de parler avec quelqu'un qui avait tenu les propos qu'il tenait sur en particulier la Shoah et sur Isral en gnral. a, c'tait tout  fait, tout  fait clair, donc je tiens  le dire. Mais je rpte, l'Iran est une grande nation historiquement, culturellement, qui compte dans cette rgion du Moyen Orient, et il est important d'avoir un dialogue avec ce pays pour essayer d'avoir une stabilit dans le Moyen Orient. Q: Je voulais vous remercier A: C'est moi qui vous remercie d'tre revenus, parce que ce sont des sujets extrmes dlicats et dangereux et qui comportent des consquences - et qui peuvent tre dramatiques. Donc, chacun doit assumer ses responsabilits. Alors on peut parfois se laisser aller, quand on croit que a n'a pas de consquences. Moi, j'ai honntement cru que les questions qui taient en dehors de l'environnement taient des questions "" off "". []. Q: [] C'est moi qui ai pos la question. Mais c'tait aprs votre analyse en ce qui concerne l nergie nuclaire, donc j'ai pos une question honntement et gentiment. Je m'excuse si cela vous a donn l'impression A: Chre Madame, non, je n'ai pas cette impression, c'est moi qui ai eu tort. Je ne veux pas le contester. J'aurais mieux fait de faire attention  ce que je disais et de comprendre que peut tre c'tait "" on "". Nous avions parl des problmes dans l'environnement, des problmes nuclaires [.] C'tait moi qui aurais d faire attention et qui aurait d dire, "" nous sommes 'off' "", et je ne l'ai pas dit, et alors du coup je me suis un peu laiss aller. Q: Mais vous dites ""il faut trouver un moyen de rgler ce problme"" mais quels sont les moyens de rgler ces problmes? A: Je vais vous dire rapidement ce qui dans l'tat actuel des choses [], ce qui est souhaitable pour l'Iran c'est la division de la communaut internationale. C'est la raison pour laquelle nous pensons qu'il est indispensable de maintenir la cohsion de la communaut internationale. [] Alors il y a les Franais, les Allemands, les Anglais qui ont un point de vue pratiquement identique. Il y a les Amricains et puis il y a les Russes qui pour des raisons qui sont les leurs, et les Chinois, ne sont pas toujours exactement sur la mme ligne. Alors si nous nous divisons, c'est une grande victoire en quelque sorte pour ceux qui en Iran sont les plus durs. Si, au contraire nous restons unis, notamment au sein des rsolutions du Conseil de Scurit, au moins sur la 1737,  ce moment-l nous restons solides. Et donc je crois que ce qui est important c'est de faire en sorte qu'il n'y ait pas de divisions de la communaut internationale et que les six pays en questions restent unis face  ce problme qui est un problme dangereux.

On Jan. 19, Hrant Dink, a prominent Turkish-Armenian who had promoted both reconciliation and an honest appraisal of the past, was murdered, apparently by a Turkish nationalist. Earlier, Orhan Pamuks reference to the massacres in an interview and an allusion to the Armenian genocide in a novel by Elif Shafak led to the prosecution of both on charges of insulting Turkishness.

With a letter of introduction from his English master at Choate, Dudley Fitts, the 19-year-old Laughlin was admitted to what Pound called his Ezuversity at Rapallo, the idea being that Pound would help the young man with his poetry. As it happened, the two got along swimmingly, except for the poetry part. Youre never going to be any good as a poet, Pound said. Why dont you take up something useful? That Laughlin saw fit to follow this advice would prove an immeasurable boon for American literature. While still at Harvard, Laughlin founded New Directions, which would soon become the most important publisher of experimental prose and poetry in the United States. Laughlin piled books into his Buick and drove as far as Omaha to extol the greatness of Pound and Henry Miller and Elizabeth Bishop and many other heroes of contemporary lit.

Marokvia is no Sophie Scholl, the Munich student who was beheaded in 1943 for distributing antigovernment fliers, though they seemed to feel the same way about Hitler. The French-born Marokvia was married to an ambitious German artist  handsome, built like a ballet dancer, chic in pants on which he wiped his paintbrushes. When she presents her best pome en prose, he admonishes her, Write a sonnet! He works as a government-sponsored artist-reporter, painting mines, barracks and soldiers, and she lives quietly in a mill near the Swiss-German border. Her memoir describes what its like to hate the Nazis  as she and her husband did  but to protest unheroically: making a snide comment when a building super rants against unpatriotic people; not finding humor in a party members joke; walking out of a movie in which a Jewish prime minister is executed (the audience burst into applause). In December 1941, Marokvia, the author of a previous memoir called Immortelles, studies weaving in an art school as the Jews of Stuttgart board buses and are put on a train that never arrived anywhere, in the words of a local lawyer. She may have lacked moral courage, but she has literary talent, conveying the everyday horror of Nazi Germany. Eventually, a police chief accuses her of being a spy and tracks her movements  until a Berlin acquaintance intervenes. Why didnt you kill Hitler? her husbands Parisian friends ask after the war.

Cut a groove into a brick, fill it with crushed basil, and put another brick on top to seal the groove. Within a few days the vegetable matter will have turned into scorpions."" So claimed a seventeenth-century savant called Jean-Baptiste Van Helmont. But although Van Helmont lived in the seventeenth century, he belonged far more to its past than its future, for he was one of those whose understanding of the world relied on ideas developed centuries before his own time. The ideas in question belonged to an intellectual tradition that encouraged belief in miracles, spontaneous generation, and phoenixes rising from ashes. In this tradition it was an unquestionable fact that the sun and stars go round a stationary earth, with God's heaven above and hell-fire at the earth's centre. Yet even as Van Helmont premised these notions in his writings, a new world of ideas was coming into existence around him. One of the chief of those bringing about this change was Ren Descartes.

It was a somber gathering: a dozen neighbors seated around the heavy mahogany dining-room table no one had used for over a decade.

us,In Spite of the Gods," It took a long time. But finally in the late 1990s India started to build roads that could get you from A to B at something better than a canter. Until then, India's most significant highway was the Grand Trunk Road that bisects the country from north to south. Laid at various stages by the late medieval Mughal dynasty, then upgraded and extended by the British in the nineteenth century and popularized by Rudyard Kipling in his novel Kim, most of the ""GT Road,"" as it is known, got acquainted with asphalt only after independence. But it is a single lane and one can rarely exceed an average of thirty miles an hour. So the relative novelty of India's double-lane expressways still generates a buzz. By 2006, India had all but completed the 3,000-mile ""Golden Quadrilateral"" expressway linking the country's four largest cities: Delhi to Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay) to Chennai (formerly known as Madras) to Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta) to Delhi. Average speeds on the better stretches are closer to sixty miles an hour. ",2007-02-04T15:47:00+0000

us,The Utility of Force," Our understanding of military forces, military operations and wars stems from the nineteenth century, when the paradigm of interstate industrial war was forged. The Napoleonic Wars were its starting point, and it evolved throughout the century as its two crucial elements came into being and matured: states and industry. The American Civil War, the German wars of unification, and finally the two world wars of the twentieth century all contributed, amongst other events, to the military development of the paradigm, each in its way. I am not a professional historian, but I am a student of history, and have often used writings of and about the past not just to learn and understand how issues were handled in times past but also to test my own ideas about how to handle the matters I faced when in command and in the field. The study of history will tell you why you and your adversary are where you are now: it will establish in broad political terms the context in which both of you will take the decisions that lead you into the future. This study begins with establishing the chronology of events so as to understand the ""march of time"" and to recognize cause and effect. Once one understands these facts one can begin to comprehend the decisions taken by the various actors, not necessarily to judge them but to understand why they were taken, in those circumstances and at that time. This is how one can begin to understand the story, ""His Story."" that each of us individually and in our social groups carries in our head as the context for the decisions we take in the present.

Larry Crawford on his practice of executing prisoners by lethal injection for the State of Missouri. To protect the doctors identity, only five people were in the room  the judge, one lawyer for each side, the court reporter and John Doe No. 1. The Taylor case, which is still going on, pits a murderer against the director of the Missouri Department of Corrections. That afternoons testimony was widely considered to be the end of the legal rope for Michael Taylor, who was awaiting execution for one of Kansas Citys most notorious crimes: he had kidnapped Ann Harrison, a 15-year-old honor student and flutist, from a bus stop at 7 a.m. on March 22, 1989, raped her and stabbed her through the heart, lungs and throat. Nobody was contesting Taylors guilt or even the death penalty. On trial was the legality of the way lethal injection is being carried out, on the grounds that it violates the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. According to Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, legal challenges to lethal-injection procedures are taking place in virtually every state with an active death penalty. As a result of those cases, about 12 of the 38 states that have the death penalty have issued temporary bans on executions, and in one, New Jersey, a legislative commission recently recommended abolishing its death penalty altogether. Until these cases, contesting the constitutionality of lethal injection seemed like little more than a delaying tactic  how could a method of execution be more benign than lying on a gurney and drifting to sleep?  but little was known about how lethal-injection procedures actually worked.",2007-02-11T05:00:00+0000

us,The Wizard and the Web,"There are hundreds, if not thousands, of Web sites around the world devoted to the Harry Potter books. Two large sites run mostly by teenagers and young adults are the self-described ""No. 1 Harry Potter Fan Site,"" MuggleNet.com, which claims more than 15 million hits per month, and The Leaky Cauldron (www.leakynews.com). Then there's thesnitch.co.uk, www.veritaserum.com, immeritus.org and the elegant potterish.com, which, though it's entirely in Portuguese, has been praised by J. K. Rowling for its style, expertise and responsible reporting. The major Potter sites tend to have much in common: they sponsor fan writing and art contests, games and forums where aficionados can discuss the Potter movies and debate fine points of plot in the six books. Speculation about the release date of the seventh, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" is also a popular topic: July 7, 2007, is a leading contender for obvious numerical reasons, but that date is hotly disputed, since it would step on the July 13 release of the latest movie, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" (""Implausible,"" MuggleNet.com judiciously concludes, betting on late summer or fall.) The MuggleNet.com producers also run a podcast that gets around 50,000 downloads a month, and The Leaky Cauldron has its own PotterCast. In addition to the community sites, there are more encyclopedic offerings, like the Harry Potter Lexicon (www.hp-lexicon.org) and the Harry Potter Automatic News Aggregator (www.hpana.com), with more than 11,500 articles collected. Proving herself a fan of fan sites, Rowling invited Emerson Spartz of MuggleNet.com and Melissa Anelli of The Leaky Cauldron to Scotland for a rare interview the day ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" was released in 2005. As she noted on her own site (www.jkrowling.com), she did it so readers would know ""I had been put on the spot by people who knew where the spot was.""",2007-02-11T15:32:00+0000

Toibin was in the studio to talk about his new book of short stories, titled Mothers and Sons.Most of the stories, he said, focus on sons who have grown into manhood, but still struggle to come to terms with a childhood full of silences, rejections and abandonments, including the abandonment of death. In one story, a portion of which Toibin read aloud, a man whose mother left home long ago recognizes her as she sings a song in a pub. She seems to be looking straight at him, and he suspects that she knows who he is, but he leaves without saying anything, thus preserving their history of distance and nonconnection.

us,Q. & A.:  Iranian Weapons in Iraq,"In recent days, American officials, including President Bush, have asserted that the Iranian government has been playing a role in providing lethal weapons to Shiite militants in Iraq that have been used in deadly attacks against American troops. Here some of the questions that have arisen about the American assertions, and some of the evolving answers. 1) What are these weapons, and why does the United States government describe them as so alarming? Iraq is awash with weapons, and increasing numbers of those recovered by the American military there, including some shoulder-fired missiles, are of Iranian origin, American military officials said. But they have become most concerned about the weapons known as explosively formed penetrators, are a particularly lethal type of roadside bomb. Triggered by infrared sensors, the bombs propel a nearly-molten ball of metal at a speed that can penetrate most American vehicle armor. Overall, they account for only a small fraction of attacks in Iraq and of overall American deaths since 2003. But American military intelligence officials say the casualties inflicted by E.F.P.s are disproportionately high. They have been used almost exclusively by Shiite militias, particularly in Baghdad. Since 2004, the weapons have killed more than 170 American soldiers and wounded 620 more since June 2004, the officials say. The number of E.F.P. attacks has increased substantially, particularly in Baghdad, where it reached an all-time high in December 2006. 2) On what basis does the United States claim that these weapons are linked to Iran?  The claims are based on information that ranges from near-conclusive to the circumstantial, American officials say. The strongest evidence is forensic, based on an examination of intact E.F.P.s intercepted as they are shipped into Iraq from across the Iranian border. Similarly, some weapons parts recovered after attacks have borne Iranian markings or other indicators characteristic of Iranian manufacture. Other information is based on human intelligence. American officials note that the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah used similar weapons extensively in southern Lebanon, and say they have intelligence that Lebanese Hezbollah forces provided training to Shiite militants. They say that Iranians and Iraqis detained in recent American raids on an Iranian office in Baghdad and another site in Erbil have provided information linking the weapons shipments to the Quds Force, an elite branch of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Other claims appear to be analytical conclusions based on inference rather than hard evidence. For example, American officials say they do not believe there are facilities in Iraq capable of manufacturing the weapons but cannot prove that one does not exist. Similarly, they say they have been no evidence that the weapons are available on the black market. American officials say they possess other, detailed information linking the weapons to Iran that they remain unwilling to publicly disclose. Some of that information, including details about the weapons manufacture and their effectiveness, is being withheld by The New York Times at the request of American military and intelligence officials, who argue that its public disclosure would compromise intelligence sources and methods and could endanger American lives. 3) Why has the Bush administration made its assertions public only recently?  In fact, American military and intelligence officials have expressed private concerns about Iranian links to E.F.P.s for well over a year. An Aug. 6, 2005, article in The New York Times attributed to American military and intelligence officials growing concerns among American military and intelligence officials about more sophisticated roadside bombs that could be traced to Iran. Since then, American commanders and Bush administration officials have periodically expressed general concern about what they described as Irans support for Shiite militants. Nevertheless, the American assertions have become much more direct and vocal in the past month. The timing appears to be part of a cycle related to the sharp increase of attacks using the weapons against American forces in 2006. Those attacks prompted deep concern among American military commanders in Baghdad, and they sought authorization for a more vigorous response. In response, American officials now say, President Bush late in the year secretly authorized American military forces in Iraq to raid Iranian facilities in Iraq suspected of playing a role in the weapons shipments. Those raids were not publicly announced, but resulted in the detention of some Iranian diplomats, and when that fact became known it prompted the Iraqi government, the press, and others pressed the White House and military commanders in Baghdad to justify the aggressive American actions. On Feb. 2, the administration made public portions of a new National Intelligence Estimate that said Iran was providing lethal support to Shiite militias in Iraq, but described the conflict in Iraq as largely self-sustaining. An article in The New York Times on Feb. 10, based on weeks of reporting, provided the first extensive account of the American assertions, which it said represented a consensus view among American intelligence agencies. That article was based on interviews with a broad range of civilian and military officials in which The Times solicited views from agencies that had been skeptical about the extent to which Iran was responsible for attacks in Iraq. A day after the article was published, three American military and intelligence officials outlined the assertions to a large group of reporters at a briefing in Baghdad that had been postponed for several weeks while the administration debated how much information to make public. The most specific, public assertions by the United States came on Feb. 14, when President Bush, at a news conference in Washington, and Maj. Gen. William Caldwell, the American military spokesman in Baghdad, both presented detailed accounts of the American claims. 4) What role has the Iranian government played?  Iran has denied all knowledge of any weapons transfers to Iraqis and accused the United States of trying to provoke a confrontation. American officials have generally stopped short of directly blaming the Iranian government for any weapons transfers. They say that the question of high-level Iranian culpability remains the weakest link in their intelligence chain, and that their views are based primarily on supposition. Most notably, Mr. Bush said on Feb. 14 that he did not know whether the actions had been specifically directed Irans leaders. Nevertheless, the American message has often been contradictory, helping to fuel skepticism of those who suggest that the Bush administration is overstating its case. At the Feb. 11 background briefing in Baghdad, officials asserted, without providing direct evidence, that Iranian leaders at the highest levels had authorized smuggling those weapons into Iraq for use against the Americans. Within two days, Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had back away from that claim, saying that he did not believe the evidence does not translate that the Iranian government, per se, for sure, is directly involved in doing this. American intelligence officials say they believe it is highly unlikely that weapons transfers by Quds Force operatives to Shiite militias would occur without authorization from senior Iranian officials. But they describe this conclusion as an assessment, and acknowledge that it is primarily inferential.  5) Hasnt anyone learned from the fiasco involving prewar intelligence on Iraq?  This is exactly the question being posed by many people skeptical of the administrations claims. They say the fact that prewar conclusions about Iraqs weapons arsenal proved to have been so wrong should make American intelligence agencies cautious about reaching hard judgments based on limited facts. American military and intelligence officials say they have learned many lessons, and they say their assertions about Iran were subjected to intensive internal vetting. Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, has said the briefing in Baghdad was postponed at one point because of concern that a draft presentation would have overstated the American case. American intelligence officials say the conclusions have been embraced by representatives all 16 intelligence agencies, under the supervision of the director of national intelligence, a post created after the Iraq intelligence fiasco in part to help subject future judgments to more intense scrutiny. In conducting interviews, The New York Times has found a consensus of support for the American assertions, even among officials whose agencies had previously been skeptical that Iran was playing a significant role in arming Shiite militants. 6) Is the Bush administration preparing for war with Iran?  The United States has begun to respond, in the form of the raids in December and January that resulted in the detention of a number of Iranians in Iraq. Some of those detained are still in American custody, and Mr. Bush has vowed that the United States will take additional action against individuals or networks in Iraq involved in the weapons shipments. But there have also been repeated indications that American action is being tightly constrained. A top official of Irans Quds Force who was captured in a December raid was released by American forces after it was determined that he had diplomatic status. American officials have said any actions against Iranian targets will be confined to Iraqi territory and will not extend across the border into Iran. Both Robert M. Gates, the new defense secretary, and Mr. Bush have said repeatedly in recent weeks that they were not seeking to lay the groundwork for military action against Iran. Democrats and other critics of the administration have nevertheless expressed skepticism about those claims, with some saying they believe Mr. Bush is using the exercise as a provocation in order to seek a military confrontation with Iran. Irans nuclear program remains a major concern to the United States. The Bush administration has used diplomacy as its primary tool to try to persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear activities, but the administration has said it will not rule out the eventual use of military action.

The result is a death rate from accidents that often dwarfs the losses from enemy action. Yet despite the wrecks littering the sides of the roads, nothing will persuade the drivers that they are making a false calculation of risk. They think they know how to drive.

But as the novel begins in 1985, the year Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, Sukhanov is asked to do the unthinkable: publish a respectful treatise on Marc Chagall. Struggling under a new age of openness, Sukhanov is soon out of a job, and he is consumed by dreams that force him to confront his shameful past. In the Book Review, Liesl Schillinger said Grushin, who was born in Moscow in 1971 and moved to America in 1989, attracts the reader with evocations of places and people, even foods, that reflect the mingled sentimentality and abhorrence of the willing exile.",2007-02-18T05:00:00+0000

The sickly 14-year-old heroine of this charming Italian novel prefers to call things not only by the names that are found in the dictionary but also by names found only in the fictionary, names that I make up and choose. This makes Margherita a bit of an unreliable narrator, but not in the ways you might think. One day a monolithic mansion, an immense black-glass Cube, without any visible doors or windows, appears next to her familys house on the dusty and depressing outskirts of an unnamed town. The building is occupied by a family far more fashionable and wealthy than her own, and its members soon enlist her father in a mysterious business venture, which the ever-suspicious teenager sets out to expose. Satirically portrayed by their daughter, Margheritas parents are so wowed by their neighbors cosmopolitanism that they become blind to the ecological and psychic devastation of the suburban sprawl threatening their once-remote home and its surrounding meadows. Despite (or perhaps because of?) her eccentric musings, Margherita provides an opposing voice of reason.

Mather first learned about inoculation from an African slave and from reports of the practice in Turkey. For years, he had repeatedly failed to persuade any physician to try it. But on June 26, 1721, Zabdiel Boylston, a physician, administered pus to his 6-year-old son and two of his slaves, an adult and child. All three experienced mild cases and quickly recovered. By the time the epidemic subsided, Boylston had inoculated 244 people, six of whom died  a death rate of 2.4 percent, compared with 14 percent for the nearly 6,000 Bostonians who acquired smallpox naturally.",2007-02-18T05:00:00+0000

By the time he buried the ashes of his formidable Irish mother  the central, most compelling character in the story he tells  he had endured repeated panic attacks and a breakdown and had finally begun to discern the nature of his problem. Once, he informs us, he even managed to tell his mother that he loved her.

Growing up there in a predominantly working-class Jewish neighborhood, she recalls in French Seduction: An Americans Encounter With France, Her Father, and the Holocaust, Lipton watched her relatives weep over photographs of Nazi concentration camp detainees. From that moment on, looking at pictures would always be intertwined in my mind with the murder of Jews. How fitting, then, that her fascination with pictures  especially those of the French Impressionists  would lead her to immerse herself in French culture, only to be traumatized by its own history of anti-Jewish sentiment. Didnt I know the French were anti-Semites? she asks, reflecting on the bigotry of Edgar Degas and Auguste Renoir, of the regular folks who rounded up Jews during the Nazi occupation and of the proprietor of her favorite Paris cafe.

No one else, only me, and the individual who looked after the lions. His name was Juan Bulgado, but he preferred to be called Johnny: Johnny Angel or Johnny Lamb, depending on his mood. In addition to feeding the animals, he was in charge of the slaughter pen, that foul-smelling corner where they killed the beasts that were fed to the carnivores. A long chain of blood. That's what the zoo is. And, very often, life. ",2007-02-18T16:14:00+0000

So when Ron Villone, the Yankees reliever, burst up to me outside the clubhouse this week and said, I saw you running, I was briefly perplexed. What? I said. In River Vale, Villone said. I saw you running and I followed you. O.K. Now it made some sense. I live in River Vale, N.J., and run through the streets of the town several times a week. Villone used to live there, too. Since Villones former wife and children still do, he frequents the town. I was beeping at you and I stuck my head out the window, Villone said. But you didnt see me. I had no explanation for Villone, other than the fact that running is a solitary exercise for me. Im in my own world. I was probably lost in some songs on my iPod because I told Villone I had no recollection of anybody in a Mercedes beeping at me and shouting to me. I stayed back about 50 feet, Villone said. I didnt want to scare you. Scare me? Well, I might have been surprised, but not scared. Anyway, I ran in Tampa on Saturday. I kept my eyes peeled for Villone this time. Nothing yet, but it is a long spring.",2007-02-18T17:56:21+0000

On Tuesdays, he runs up and down stairs and concentrates on agility drills. Wednesdays are devoted to running from pole to pole, over and over again. He switches it up on Thursdays, running in a hilly tropical park near his Miami home. On Friday, he runs for 25 to 30 minutes.

us,Should Our Lives Be Unified?,"Back in 1961, when Theodore Bikel was guest starring on the supremely great TV series Naked City, he played a loving father and husband who, in an early scene, rows a small boat out to where a cabin cruiser is anchored in the Hudson River. He climbs up onto the deck and calmly massacres five men. It turns out that he has a secret life as a contract killer, and after several turns of the plot he agrees to testify against his employers. In the last scene, he is shot going up the steps of the courthouse, and just before he dies, he says to his son (played by Keir Dullea), they will ask you how a man could love his family and then go out and kill five people. What has one thing to do with the other?I have always regarded that dying declaration as a trenchant critique of the myth of the unified life, the idea that we all have, or should have, a set of core values to which we are responsive no matter what it is we happen to be doing  working, worshiping, playing, parenting, voting. It is as if Polonius had added a second line to his advice to his son Laertes in Hamlet. Not only to thine own self be true, but be true in exactly the same way whatever the circumstances. But is that a good idea? Should the different contexts we enter be informed always by the same allegiances? Or is it possible, and perhaps desirable, to compartmentalize ones life so that the convictions adhered to in one area remain cabined and do not spill over into the others? ",2007-02-19T01:27:55+0000

Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton signalled to black voters this morning that they could think of the 2008 presidential contest as a barrier-breaking election even if they voted for her instead of one of their own, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, who is competing with Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are aggressively courting black voters; she made her first visit to South Carolina today as a presidential candidate, appearing before a predominantly black audience of about 2,500 people at historically black Allen University, while Mr. Obama was in the state this past weekend. At her town hall forum at Allen, Mrs. Clinton also put her own gentle spin on a controversy that erupted last week when one of her most prominent black supporters in South Carolina, state Senator Robert Ford, said Mr. Obama would be a political disaster as the nominee. ""Every Democrat running on that ticket next year would lose, because he's black and he's top of the ticket,"" Mr. Ford said. ""We'd lose the House and the Senate and the governors and everything."" The quote has been a big deal in South Carolina, and Mr. Ford has apologized for it. At the town hall, Mrs. Clinton said, ""I believe this presidential election is about breaking barriers  and this is the campaign, and I am the candidate with the experience to break the barriers."" She also won a standing ovation by saying, ""I believe one of the great things about America is, anyone can be president, and what it depends upon is the individual. I'm proud to be a woman."" Indeed, the audience was ecstatic when she made her standard can-a-woman-win remarks. Strong applause and standing ovations both. Mrs. Clinton did not refer to Mr. Obama by name, nor did she rebuke Mr. Ford; indeed, he was in the audience, and she thanked him for his support. ",2007-02-19T06:35:00+0000

There is eerie porcelain by the Danish sculptor Louise Hindsgavl and gently deconstructed jewelry by Benedicte, Natalia Brilli and Philip Crangi, interspersed with estate jewelry and objets  watercolors, plates, frames and childrens furniture.

Now, after seasons of skinny-pants ubiquity, here they are again: at Herms, Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and, most notably, at Yves Saint Laurent, where Stefano Pilati paid gauzy homage to Saint Laurents seminal Orientalist shows. More pragmatic members of the press greeted the revival with less than Turkish delight, deeming them too costumey for ordinary women. Exactly the point. Since the 19th century, harem pants have been the uniform of extraordinary women. They first appeared on Western women circa 1850: wide pantaloons designed by the American feminist Elizabeth Smith Miller to liberate women from corsets and petticoats. Although championed by Amelia Bloomer in her feminist paper, The Lily, they failed to take off. However, when Paul Poiret reintroduced them in 1911, le tout Paris was in the thrall of the Ballets Russes, a decadent fantasy of the East, with sets and costumes by Lon Bakst. (Proof of his vision are I Dream of Jeannie and generations of belly-dancing suburban Salomes.) For ALelia Walker, the heiress to a hair-care fortune, harem pants were both a symbol of pride and a provocation. During the 1920s, Walker was Americas richest black woman, and her signature ensemble consisted of silk brocade harem pants and a plumed turban. On a 1921 trip to Paris, her style caused a sensation.",2007-02-25T05:00:00+0000

The very vacuousness of these films is reassuring, he writes, comparing them to the expensive weapons systems whose presence makes us feel secure in other ways.

us,A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier," There were all kinds of stories told about the war that made it sound as if it was happening in a faraway and different land. It wasn't until refugees started passing through our town that we began to see that it was actually taking place in our country. Families who had walked hundreds of miles told how relatives had been killed and their houses burned. Some people felt sorry for them and offered them places to stay, but most of the refugees refused, because they said the war would eventually reach our town. The children of these families wouldn't look at us, and they jumped at the sound of chopping wood or as stones landed on the tin roofs flung by children hunting birds with slingshots. The adults among these children from the war zones would be lost in their thoughts during conversations with the elders of my town. Apart from their fatigue and malnourishment, it was evident they had seen something that plagued their minds, something that we would refuse to accept if they told us all of it. At times I thought that some of the stories the passersby told were exaggerated. The only wars I knew of were those that I had read about in books or seen in movies such as Rambo: First Blood, and the one in neighboring Liberia that I had heard about on the BBC news. My imagination at ten years old didn't have the capacity to grasp what had taken away the happiness of the refugees. ",2007-02-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Why Art Is  and Is Not  the New Fashion,"Anyone who would be so bold as to call attention to the fashionableness of contemporary art had better be prepared to duck an angry barrage of paintbrushes. (And anyone who would deny it should perhaps get in line now for a ticket to this weekend's Armory show on New York's Pier 94.) Certainly, the approach on the following pages  which includes a survey of the suddenly hot Chinese art scene, an intimate profile of the art instigator Francesca von Habsburg and a look inside a house designed to accommodate the life and work of a prominent art collector  is as deep as it is superficial. Context is all. Both art and fashion speak in a densely encoded visual language to a certain status, knowledge and taste. Roughly translated, that means an elitism that makes those who know the difference between, say, James Turrell and Olafur Eliasson (or, for that matter, between Prada and Lanvin) feel secure in their defense of social Darwinism. But the point that is not to be glossed over here is that like fashion, contemporary art has infiltrated all aspects of life, influencing the ways we travel, spend our time and increasingly our money, and the way we organize our surroundings. And if we can relax for a moment, we might find how much pleasure it brings. This thing we like to think of as art has as much to do with work hanging on a wall in a museum as fashion does with clothes on models walking down a runway. Which is to say everything and nothing. But how much more interesting to encounter it as it lives and breathes in its natural habitat.  ALIX BROWNE",2007-02-25T05:00:00+0000

The writing was lucid, concise and devoid of sensationalism, rare qualities in the plethora of books by turncoat mobsters and their ex-wives, journalists, cops and aged Las Vegas insiders. This equally well-written sequel, Bringing Down the Mob, chronicles the Mafias near demise over the past 50 years. Following this specific thread of American history, general readers will benefit from Reppettos cogent examples of how changes in the culture at large affected both the mob itself and the tactics employed by law enforcement.

No, they were waiting for Wall to determine that the rain had become too heavy or the light had grown too bright or the prevailing mood had turned too restless for him to obtain the feeling of suspended activity and diffused expectancy that he sought in the picture. He was prepared to come here, day after day, for several weeks. On any given morning, typically after three hours elapsed, he would adjourn until the next day, authorizing the men to receive their paychecks of 82 Canadian dollars and get back into the bus.

The heat is in the longing, the unavailability as we like to say, the gap, the illusion, etc. But what Andr Aciman considers, elegantly and with no small amount of unbridled skin-to-skin contact, is that maybe the heat of eros isnt only in the friction of memory and anticipation. Maybe its also in the getting. In a first novel that abounds in moments of emotional and physical abandon, this may be the most wanton of his moves: his narrative, brazenly, refuses to stay closed.

So its not all that surprising that when it comes to shopping for anything beyond your basic carton of milk  when it comes, that is, to objects of desire rather than necessity  Im a world-class second-guesser. Do I really like this pair of Walter Steiger shoes that much? Do they go with enough of my clothes? Are they me, or me trying to be a lady who lunches? And perhaps most important:Do I deserve what they cost? (Evidently not, for stuck far back in a bedroom drawer is an ancient credit slip from the Walter Steiger shop, attesting to a change of heart  and to hundreds of dollars gone a-wasting. The sands of time run through the hourglass and still I wonder, five years after this credit was first issued: would they honor this transaction if I walked in one day, confident and smiling, in the mood for an artfully crafted, pointy-toed pair of shoes? Or would a sales clerk politely assist me and then look on in disbelief as I tried to make good on my decaying i.o.u. like some sort of desperate Emma Bovary, trading on air?)",2007-02-25T05:00:00+0000

If a nuclear bomb went off in Moscow or New York City or Jerusalem, any number of groups would claim they have another, Nunn told me recently. These groups would make steep demands as intelligence officials scrambled to determine which claims were real. Panic would prevail. Even after the detonation of a small, crude weapon that inflicted less damage than the bomb at Hiroshima, Nunn suggested, the psychological damage would be incalculable.

Maybe she needed to kick off the dust of her antiquated past. Von Habsburg is the 48-year-old daughter of the late billionaire-industrialist Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. If that werent enough, in 1993 she married Karl von Habsburg, otherwise known as Archduke Karl of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia, and the couple set up home in Salzburg, producing two archduchesses and an archduke. But after 10 years, bored with the cultural stuffiness of Salzburg, she separated  amicably  from Karl; around the same time, her father died. The baron had married five times, ensuring a lively legal battle over his prodigious estate, which included the second-largest private art collection in Europe  surpassed only by the Queen of Englands.

Drawing on John Stuart Mills classic essay, On Liberty, Appiah, a Princeton philosopher, argues for a rooted cosmopolitanism, emphasizing the individual while recognizing the importance of collective identities based on race, religion, language and sexual preference. Appiahs examples range from the proceedings of the Pueblo tribal council to the experience of his own multicontinental family.

Nevertheless, he was going in an optimistic spirit: ""If there is a postscript that I hope might be written with regard to this trip, it would be the words on the plaque which was left on the moon by our first astronauts when they landed there: 'We came in peace for all mankind.'""
