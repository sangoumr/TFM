us,Letters: My Fathers Broken Heart,"Katy Butlers fearlessly written memoir struck a chord with me. At age 83, shortly after fulfilling a lifelong dream of obtaining a college degree, my proud and proper father had triple-bypass and valve-replacement surgery and was never the same, emotionally or intellectually. His heart and lung rhythms could never be properly regulated, so he received a pacemaker, which extended his foggy and diminished life until 93. My parents, and many of their generation, revere doctors and would never dare question this bill of goods that they are sold. I cheer the memory of Katys mother. Her staunch self-reliance in the face of her husbands and then her own decline is remarkable.ANN L. HYMANNew York",2010-07-01T19:56:13+0000

Eclipse sold $68.5 million on Wednesday (including the 12:01 a.m. showings), breaking a record for the biggest mid-week gross in history, according to Summit Entertainment, the studio behind the series. (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, which sold $62 million on a Wednesday last summer, will now have to make do with second place.) Opening-day audiences were 80 percent female, which has become standard for the Twilight series, based on the best-selling books by Stephenie Meyer. The question for Eclipse was never about whether it would open big  that was a given  but whether it would generate bang-up repeat business and lure even more fans to the franchise. The answer will come in the days ahead but exit polls signal that Eclipse could achieve those goals through strong word of mouth: CinemaScore, the market research company, said audiences rate the film an A, which is higher than the grade given to its predecessor, The Twilight Saga: New Moon.

us,Prince Charles Defended for Criticizing Buildings,"A secretary for the Prince of Wales, below, said that the prince considers it his role to represent the views of ordinary people on architecture and urban planning, amid a dispute over his involvement in the development of the Chelsea barracks in London, The Guardian reported. Last week a London high court ruled that Qatar Diar, the property company of the Qatari royal family, had breached its contract with a partner company after it withdrew a planning application for a multimillion-dollar development designed by the architect Richard Rogers for the site of a former army barracks. In a letter, the prince wrote that Mr. Rogerss designs were unsuitable for a site so close to the Royal Hospital, which was designed by Christopher Wren, leading Mr. Rogers to accuse the prince of an abuse of power and unconstitutional behavior. The high court last week said Prince Charless campaign against Mr. Rogerss design was unwelcome, reopening the debate about the princes role in planning decisions. In the past he has criticized contemporary architecture while favoring restoration and preservation efforts. But Michael Peat, the private secretary to Prince Charles, told The Guardian that the prince opposed the designs because it is part of the Prince of Waless role and duty to make sure the views of ordinary people that might not otherwise be heard receive some exposure.",2010-07-02T06:27:22+0000

Mr. Gervais, a co-creator of the original BBC version of The Office, and who starred as David Brent, the oafish paper-company manager who inspired Mr. Carells Michael Scott character, wrote on his blog (rickygervais.com) that Mr. Carells departure was of course inevitable (and sad), but I wish him all the luck in the world. He added: It was expected of me, as executive producer, to persuade him to stay on. With syndication in full swing the more successful the show remains, the more billions we all make.

us,At Her Fingertips,"From  The Thorn Birds  to  Brideshead Revisited  to White Teeth, the multigenerational family tale can almost always be described in certain ways: it will be long, it will take place over several decades or centuries, its narrative will be tethered to the history of a particular place. But while we may think we know what such a story looks and sounds like, Jane Mendelsohn uses her third novel, American Music, to quietly redefine the genre. Although the novel takes place over several generations and more than 80 years of American history (and nearly 400 years of world history), its less than 250 pages long. How can something so slim cover so much ground? This breadth is achieved through a series of haunting impressions that trace the story of a family, the history of 20th-century America and the evolution of American music.",2010-07-02T14:05:58+0000

us,New Spider-Man Finds Its New Spider-Man,"Usually the eve of a holiday weekend is an opportune moment for an organization to announce layoffs or to put out reams of documents for dirt-diggers to sift through. For Sony, this is the ideal time to announce that it has found a new actor to star in its lucrative Spider-Man movie franchise. The studio said Andrew Garfield, right, a relatively unknown 26-year-old actor, would replace Tobey Maguire as that red-and-blue web-slinger as well as his nebbishy alter ego, Peter Parker, according to The Hollywood Reporters Heat Vision blog (heatvisionblog.com). Mr. Garfields credits include the Terry Gilliam movie The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and David Finchers coming film about Facebook, The Social Network. The three Spider-Man movies that starred Mr. Maguire and were directed by Sam Raimi have sold more than $2.4 billion in tickets worldwide. But at the start of the year Mr. Maguire and Mr. Raimi left a planned Spider-Man 4 film because of creative differences. Instead, Sony hired Marc Webb ((500) Days of Summer) to direct a new movie that will return Spidey to his modest origins. (And be released in 3-D in 2012.)",2010-07-02T22:04:08+0000
us,Forging a Festival for Black Playwrights,"Does the world need another festival for emerging playwrights? Lynn Nottage, above, answered with an emphatic yes this week by hosting a fund-raiser in her Brooklyn home to benefit the establishment of the New Black Fest, a festival aiming to showcase innovative work by and about black people from around the world. Its organizers and supporters are busy raising money and seeking out advisers in time for an autumn inaugural festival, which would include readings and panel discussions. This is not about separation, its about inclusion, said Ms. Nottage, who won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in drama for Ruined, about women in a Congolese brothel. Its about inviting people who dont get access. Katori Hall (of the Broadway-bound play The Mountaintop) and Suzan Lori-Parks (Topdog/Underdog) were among the playwrights attending the benefit. By the end of the night, $7,000 had been raised as the hat was passed among about 45 people from the world of film and theater, including Sandra Oh (Greys Anatomy), Russell Hornsby and Chris Chalk (of the Broadway revival of Fences), Eisa Davis (Passing Strange), the directors Malcolm Lee and Charles Randolph-Wright, and David Dower, associate artistic director of Arena Stage in Washington. Ms. Parks said the new festival would not only nurture and introduce new talent but also help African-Americans remind each other that we are a great and powerful people, she said.",2010-07-02T22:04:31+0000
us,Pee-Wees New Movie,"Our bow ties havent stopped spinning since Variety reported that Paul Reubens is working on a new Pee-wee Herman movie, to be produced by Judd Apatow, the writer-director of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. The news has a lot of people wondering what such a collaboration will yield  Not the least of which is me, Mr. Reubens, above, in character, said by telephone. Mr. Reubens, who is preparing his live Pee-wee Herman Show for Broadway, has spoken often about two Pee-wee-centered film scripts he has written that would continue the adventures of his manic character, seen in Pee-wees Big Adventure and the CBS childrens series Pee-wees Playhouse. But what Mr. Apatow wanted, Mr. Reubens said, was a reality-based world and a linear road movie. So thats the path that Mr. Reubens and a co-writer, Paul Rust, are working along, for now. The Pee-wee character seems synonymous with a youthful innocence, while Mr. Apatow has a sensibility that can be naughty and often rude  but, Mr. Reubens said, So can mine.",2010-07-02T22:04:51+0000

(Aug. 11); Birmingham, Ala. (Aug. 12); Austin, Tex. (Aug. 14); Houston (Aug. 15); and Dallas (Aug. 16), the tours press representatives said in a news release. An Aug. 8 date in Atlanta is still listed on the festivals Web site (lilithfair.com). No immediate reason for the canceled dates was given, but disappointing ticket sales was the likely culprit. In a statement, Terry McBride, a founder of the Lilith festival, said: We are in the midst of one of the most challenging summer concert seasons with many tours being canceled outright. Everyone involved with the tour would like to apologize to the fans and artists scheduled to play in these markets, and express appreciation for all the support for the festivals return. Lilith remains the only tour of its kind, and we are confident that fans will be amazed by what each date has to offer. The Lilith festival, which is playing its first dates since 1999, said that its kickoff performance last weekend in Calgary, Alberta, drew more than 9,000 concertgoers.",2010-07-02T22:06:38+0000

The budget passed by the Council on Tuesday includes roughly $150 million for the Department of Cultural Affairs, compared with the $159 million that was allocated last year. (The 2010 fiscal year ended on Wednesday.) Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had proposed a $49 million cut, but the mayor and the Council ultimately restored $40 million.

I thought about this a lot. The poster claimed that if there were a job worth having in Dillon, the boosters would actually give it to Riggins. But of course the point here  and the point of the show in general to a large extent  is that there are so few jobs actually worth having there. (And as far as Rigginss squandering opportunities, it simply would not have felt in keeping with his character if hed stayed in college. Not everyone is cut out for college and not everyone should be expected to go. Part of what is so painfully evocative about Friday Night Lights is that it gives us a sense of an America where very little is possible without an exit from small-time life or an education.)",2010-07-03T01:00:56+0000

Capes and cloaks can be easily removed if they get caught on something. Gowns and dresses, not so much. The more form-fitting, the better. So tight pants or skinny jeans, sure. Mr. Gunn also noted that the move away from bright costumes to more natural-looking clothing could be a plus. I would imagine that this new look will allow Wonder Woman to morph into situations in a less noticeable manner and, thereby be even more effective at combating evildoers, he said.

The bones were exhumed from an unmarked grave in a local cemetery in 1956, then stored in a church there until a campaign began to determine their authenticity. The urn went on display at the historic Forte Stella and will be there for one month in conjunction with an exhibition of photographs detailing the work of the team of microbiologists, art historians and anthropologists who helped to identify the bones.

Theaters in Tokyo and Osaka canceled opening screenings earlier this summer because theater owners said they feared for the safety of moviegoers after receiving threats from protest groups who considered the movie to be anti-Japan. The documentary, directed by the photographer Louie Psihoyos, opened to full houses in six small cinemas around Japan on Saturday with a significant amount of protesting from both sides of the issue. (Pro-whaling protesters in Tokyo, left.) Aside from police officers ending a few altercations between supporters of the film and angry nationalists, the protests proved to be no deterrent for moviegoers. I didnt know about dolphin hunting, Tomokazu Toshinai said as he entered a theater. Whether its TV or movies, Japanese have a right to know these things.

The exhumation was ordered by the Icelandic Supreme Court to determine if Fischer, above, is the father of Jinky Young, a 9-year-old Filipino girl. Olafur Helgi Kjartansson, the sheriff of Selfoss, the town near the cemetery; the Rev. Kristinn Agust Fridfinnsson, the pastor of Selfoss; members of the local parish; medical workers; and several law-enforcement officers oversaw the exhumation, according to The Grapevine. Since Fischers death in 2008 there has been a dispute over his estate involving competing claims by Marilyn Young, Jinkys mother; Miyoko Watai, general secretary of the Japanese Chess Association, who said she married Fischer in 2004; and two of Fischers nephews, Alexander and Nicholas Targ. The estate is said to be worth at least $2 million, and Fischer left no will. Marilyn Young filed her claim in Iceland last November. Among the documents she provided were pictures of herself with Fischer and Jinky, and postcards to Jinky signed Daddy that she said were from Fischer. She has also produced records showing that Fischer gave her money in 2006 and 2007 for Jinky, according to RUV, a public broadcaster.

us,Letters: The End of the Line,"Roger Lowenstein, in his article on the public-pension-fund crisis, ignores a key piece of the math. Teachers and state and local workers in the past have accepted a social contract with government, exchanging a lower wage and loyalty in return for job security and benefits, most notably health and pension benefits. Today, job security no longer exists. Health benefits have eroded. Cutting pensions, or worse, converting to defined contributions, effectively ends the contract. The paradox for taxpayers is that the historic benefits package never made up for the wage differential, which resulted in lower taxes. It is already difficult to attract talent to public service; and you do get what you pay for. In exchange for sufficiently eroded benefits, governments and school districts will be forced to pay much higher wages, and taxpayers much higher taxes, for the same work.",2010-07-06T14:23:12+0000

This premise has been advanced as a central legal remedy to end segregated public facilities and unfair discrimination on the basis of race and gender. While its true that contemporary liberal justices may not express this philosophy in such expansive and bold terms as in the past, the premise of interpreting the Constitution in a way to ensure justice through equality has been a unifying liberal judicial vision for half a century and still plays a key role in contemporary liberal jurisprudence.",2010-07-06T14:28:54+0000

Recently a narrative has sprung up, on the crunchy right as well as on the left, that argues that Carter was prescient rather than over-pessimistic, and that America would be better off today if wed heeded his indictment of consumerism and self-indulgence, rather than spurning him for the go-go optimism of Ronald Reagan. This is not a crazy idea, since in many ways the speechs moral critique of American life was powerful, timely, and as applicable today as it was then. (Heres a snippet: In a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close-knit communities, and our faith in God, too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns.) You can debate whether its appropriate for a chief executive to play the prophet, but if Carter had stopped talking halfway through the address, confined himself to calling for moral renewal, and stayed away from economic policy, the malaise speech would look like a plausible indictment of the excesses of late-modern America  excesses that are very much still with us today, and contributed in varying ways to our current economic dislocations.",2010-07-06T20:40:33+0000

Half a mile away, a 27-year-old Yemeni tribesman named Ali Muhammad Ahmed was awakened by the sound. Stumbling out of bed, he quickly dressed, slung his AK-47 over his shoulder and climbed down a footpath to the valley that shelters his village, two hours from the nearest paved road. He already sensed what had happened. A week earlier, an American airstrike killed dozens of people in a neighboring province as part of an expanded campaign against Al Qaeda militants.

ABC was worried that the style would put distance between the characters and the audience, but real-life events also had an effect. Just days after the series was announced, The Detroit News reported that the citys mayor, Dave Bing, had banned camera crews from riding along with police officers. The decision followed the death of a 7-year-old Detroit girl during a police raid being filmed by the A&E cable channel.

Starting in the long-ago year of 2003, it tells how the Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg (played in the film by Jesse Eisenberg) helped hatch an idea that became the wildly popular Facebook Web site  and the complications that its success quickly yielded. Scott Rudin, a producer of the film, said it was told in an All About Eve style, from multiple points of view, including the perspectives of other young entrepreneurs who sued Mr. Zuckerberg, saying the site was their idea. Everybody believes theyre right, Mr. Rudin said in a telephone interview. But the movie leaves you to make up your own mind about what you feel about how Facebook was founded. The film festival will have the premiere on Sept. 24, before the movie is released Oct. 1. The festival runs through Oct. 10, with additional films to be announced.",2010-07-08T22:41:09+0000

The ambitious project made its debut in 2009 at the academy with Mr. Mendes directing a single cast of British and American actors in productions of Shakespeares Winters Tale and Chekhovs Cherry Orchard that later traveled to Britain, Singapore, New Zealand, Spain, Germany and Greece. The second installment, featuring As You Like It and The Tempest, was done in Brooklyn this year. Mr. Mendes directed the productions, currently in repertory at the Old Vic, where Kevin Spacey is artistic director. The plays for the third round have not been announced, but Mr. Mendes, also a film director, has a busy schedule directing a new stage musical of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 2011 and King Lear for the Royal National Theater in 2012.",2010-07-08T22:42:17+0000

So observes Morrie Morgan, the hero of Ivan Doigs new novel, Work Song (and of an earlier one, The Whistling Season), upon his arrival in Butte, Mont., in the postwar heyday of 1919. The Western landscape is a strong component in the book, yet this is one of the few passages that allude to Montanas Big Sky. Instead, Doig concentrates on interior spaces: the majestic town library, the modest dining room of the fetching widow Grace Faradays boarding house, and the most deeply interior settings of all  the copper mines, where men labor under perilous conditions. Butte suffers from a violent history, and the mining industry plagues daily life. Graces husband died in a mining fire, and her boarding house frequently shakes from underground dynamite.

Writing to John Adams in 1813, having taken his razor blade to the books of the New Testament and removed all the artificial vestments in which they have been muffled by priests, Thomas Jefferson said the 46-page residue contained the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man. Ernest Renan, in his pathbreaking Life of Jesus in 1863, also repudiated the idea that Jesus was the son of God while affirming the beauty of his teachings. In rather striking contrast, C. S. Lewis maintained in his classic statement Mere Christianity: That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.

Consisting of a long-overlooked autobiographical fragment by Claire Clairmont, who was Mary Shelleys stepsister, Lord Byrons lover and the inspiration for Henry Jamess Aspern Papers, it has the declared intention of showing what evil passion sprang from the pursuit of free love by Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Under the influence of the doctrine and belief of free love, Clairmont states, I saw the two first poets of England . . . become monsters of lying, meanness, cruelty and treachery  under the influence of free love Lord B became a human tyger slaking his thirst for inflicting pain upon defenceless women. Her indictment, which Daisy Hay says is now being published for the first time, comes only at the end of Young Romantics yet sends a blast of scorching fury back across the entire book. For Clairmonts charges, however hyperbolic, have about them a degree of truth. Not just for her but for Mary Shelley and other women, participating in the communal, proto-1960s life of English poetrys greatest generation, as Hays subtitle puts it, was ultimately less thrilling than damaging. This, at least, is the dominant impression I took away from Young Romantics, even if it isnt Hays thesis or even drift.",2010-07-09T15:24:10+0000

Altruism often requires that we take care of ourselves first, which is exactly what the subject of Oren Harmans enthralling book The Price of Altruism tragically failed to do. The scientist George Price was an obscure and enigmatic figure, unknown outside his field of study. Born near New York City in 1922 and originally trained as a chemist, Price worked on the Manhattan Project, at Bell Labs and at I.B.M. before moving to London in 1967, after botched surgery for thyroid cancer. There he became a population geneticist and tried to solve the mystery of altruism with brilliant mathematical formulas. He had trouble solving his own problems, though. Having shown little sensitivity to others in his previous life (he abandoned his wife and daughters and was a lousy son to his aging mother), Price swung to the other extreme. Long a staunch skeptic and atheist, he became a devout Christian, gave up all his possessions and dedicated himself to caring for the citys vagabonds.

But Hari added: I forbid everyone from praying for him. He would HATE that. While Hitchens himself doesnt seem to have issued any official directives, prayers have rolled in from Elizabeth Scalia (no relation to the Supreme Court justice) at First Things, Greg Kandra at The Deacons Bench and Pat Archbold at The National Catholic Register.

The contest is a staple of Today, the most popular morning show on television. It allows viewers to vote on every detail of a couples wedding, which is then broadcast live on the show. Even though same-sex couples will now be allowed to apply, it does not guarantee an appearance. Today producers sort through the applications and pick four finalist couples, and viewers take it from there, voting for which one should actually win the wedding and the all-expenses-paid honeymoon.

HitFix.com reported that Marvel was not asking Mr. Norton, who played Bruce Banner and his alter ego in The Incredible Hulk, to reprise his role in The Avengers, a film planned for 2012 that will unite some of the companys best-known superheroes. Marvel said its decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. In a swift rebuttal, Mr. Nortons agent Brian Swardstrom wrote to HitFix.com that Marvels statement was a purposefully misleading, inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light. Marvel cast Mr. Norton to portray the Banner and Hulk characters for a 2008 remake after a 2003 Hulk movie was a box office disappointment. Mr. Norton was also allowed to rewrite the script of his film, and there were rumblings that he and the studio clashed over creative decisions in the weeks before The Incredible Hulk was released.",2010-07-12T22:00:33+0000

Those were the Yankees of Steve Trout and Ed Whitson, Andy Hawkins and Mel Hall, the Ken Phelps-for-Jay Buhner trade and the long slow decline of Don Mattingly, their only true 1980s great. And then they were the Yankees of Howard Spira, the gambler who Steinbrenner paid to gather dirt on Dave Winfield, leading to the Yankee owners suspension from baseball for life in 1990. His team went 67-95 that year, 71-91 the next, and it seemed like Steinbrenner would be remembered as the owner who saved Yankee baseball in the 1970s only to destroy it a decade later.",2010-07-13T20:06:29+0000

Paul K. Martin, the inspector general, concluded that there was no evidence supporting either concern, and that the move resulted from e-mail messages Mr. Hanley had sent to senior NASA officials that led them to conclude he could no longer lead the program.

In May a federal district judge ordered the filmmaker, Joe Berlinger, to turn over outtakes from Crude, the documentary that he made about the suit brought in Ecuador against Texaco  now owned by Chevron  charging that the company contaminated drinking and bathing water in Amazonian rain forests. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan had ruled that the footage could be subpoenaed because it fit the standard established by precedent: it was nonconfidential, was likely of relevance to the case being tried and could not be otherwise obtained by the defense. Maura J. Wogan, an attorney for Mr. Berlinger, vigorously disputed those determinations, telling a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that Judge Kaplan had issued a broad and unprecedented order that would result in a chilling effect on her client and on other journalists if upheld. Speaking a few minutes later, Randy Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, told the judges that this is a case about plaintiffs lawyers who decided that they wanted to star in a movie, and so could not believe that their actions would remain private. As the proceeding progressed the judges signaled that they might narrow the focus of Judge Kaplans decision and perhaps require Mr. Berlinger to produce a smaller amount of material.",2010-07-14T22:38:25+0000

Mr. Broad has considered at least two other sites for the museum, which he has pledged to build with his own money  up to $100 million for construction and $200 million more for an endowment. He had explored the possibility of leasing the downtown site for $1, a common arrangement for cultural institutions, but that idea was criticized by Michael Antonovich, a Los Angeles County supervisor. In an interview Mr. Broad said such criticism blows my imagination, frankly, adding that any city in America would like to get a museum built if they didnt have to pay for it. But a spokeswoman for Mr. Broad told The Times that he had changed his mind about the lease because he wanted everyone to be supportive and satisfied.",2010-07-14T22:39:23+0000

His penchant for placing equal emphasis on the visual and the aural permeates the Whitney show. Most of the works on display  whether they are made of found objects, images, album covers, LPs, clothes, film footage or texts  can be used as musical scores. And they will be used, often several times during the shows run, by a rotating roster of musicians that includes some of the biggest names from the avant-garde music scene. An artist as dedicated to mixing media as Mr. Marclay deserves the attention of critics from more than one discipline. Roberta Smith, the New York Times art critic who reviewed the exhibition on July 8, and Nate Chinen, one of The Timess music critics, discuss his work from their respective perspectives.",2010-07-15T15:12:54+0000

And over the course of the 20th century, cinema provided a vast, perpetually replenishing reservoir of raw material for the fantasies of millions of people. Freud believed that dreams were compounded out of the primal matter of the unconscious and the prosaic events of daily life.

Then I dont need you.

Guggenheim Foundation, Richard Armstrong, below, appears to be consolidating control over the development of the Guggenheims enormous new branch in Abu Dhabi. When Mr. Armstrong took over the Guggenheim in 2008 from Thomas Krens, who began the Abu Dhabi project, the Guggenheim said Mr. Krens would continue consulting on it, setting up what seemed like a potentially difficult power-sharing arrangement. But the Guggenheims spokeswoman, Eleanor Goldhar, said this week that Mr. Krenss involvement would conclude by the end of the year. Asked if that was a change of plans, Ms. Goldhar said that Mr. Krenss role was always connected to the creation of the building, designed by Frank Gehry, rather than the planning of the museums program. But at the time that Mr. Krens stepped down as director, and as recently as last year in an interview in the Russian-language magazine Snob, Mr. Krens seemed to envision a larger role. Mr. Krens, who did not respond to requests for comment, pioneered the concept of the global museum during his 20-year tenure at the Guggenheim, opening branches in Bilbao, Spain; Berlin; and Las Vegas.",2010-07-15T22:22:12+0000

In March, the Jersey Boys playwrights, Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, as well as two Four Seasons band members, Frankie Valli and Bob Gaudio, sued Christian Hoff, J. Robert Spencer, Daniel Reichard and Michael Longoria, all alumni of that shows cast. At issue was the touring production The Boys in Concert, in which the Jersey Boys veterans perform songs of the 1960s and 70s, including some made famous by the Four Seasons. The suit contended that the tour misleadingly suggested a connection to the Tony-winning show. In a counterclaim filed last week in United States District Court in New York, lawyers for the former Jersey Boys stars said the creative team and Dodger Theatricals, among the shows producers, were motivated by petty vindictiveness and malice and using bully tactics better suited for the schoolyard. They are seeking an injunction allowing them to continue the tour as well as damages of no less than $1 million and a jury trial.",2010-07-15T22:26:04+0000

Anniversary is derived from the Latin annus meaning 'year.' "" Ed Morman writes of ""n-year anniversary,"" ""It's not very mellifluous and it is, of course redundant. Help me bring back 'nth anniversary.' ""  Gifford and Morman aren't alone in their irritation. A few years ago, when The San Francisco Chronicle ran a headline reading, ""Four-year anniversary draws protests,"" an irate reader left a profanity-riddled voicemail that unkindly insinuated what substance could be found between the ears of Phil Bronstein, then the editor of The Chronicle. (The same reader was even more offended by the appearance of ""pilotless drone"" in the newspaper, and his recorded rant became something of a Web sensation.)  The New York Times, too, is hardly immune to this redundancy. The June 28 edition, for instance, featured an article on Dylan Ratigan's ""one-year anniversary at MSNBC"" and another stating that New York's first gay pride parade commemorated ""the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall uprising."" Philip Corbett, the newsroom's style guru, has frequently complained about this usage in his ""After Deadline"" blog but laments that his reminders have ""little effect.""  What has happened to the word anniversary? Even though the idea of yearly recurrence is built into the word etymologically, that idea has been clouded over centuries of use. And when an element of a word's meaning becomes more opaque, redundancy is one method, however inelegant, that gets used to unmuddy the waters.",2010-07-16T14:16:20+0000

Golding was drinking heavily at the time (he had a lifelong struggle with alcoholism) and one may have to take his bitterness advisedly, but these remarks reveal an interesting artistic conundrum. What is it like to owe virtually your entire reputation as a writer to a single book? One thinks of J. D. Salinger, Ralph Ellison, Joseph Heller  to cite only the 20th-century American exemplars  but such one-book writers are legion in all literatures. John Carey seems to allude to the category in this biographys subtitle (even though Carey eventually disputes the implication). However, if anyone thinks of William Golding today, it is almost certain that his name will be conjoined with his extraordinary first novel.",2010-07-16T15:33:20+0000

The producers of 48 Hours felt that not to nominate their work would unfairly deprive the many other dedicated journalists involved of recognition they had earned. Pleading guilty last March, Mr. Halderman admitted to having tried to extort $2 million from Mr. Letterman last year.

If the bank exercises an over allotment option and issues up to 15 percent more shares, its I.P.O. could end up topping that of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, another state-controlled Chinese bank.

The reading, presented by the producer Daryl Roth, is scheduled for Oct. 18 at the Walter Kerr Theater. Mr. Grey appeared in the 1985 production at the Public Theater, when he replaced Brad Davis as Ned, the activist based on Mr. Kramer. After seeing the show with Mr. Davis onstage, Mr. Grey said in a telephone interview, he told Mr. Kramer that this is overwhelming and so devastating and important that Ill never forget it. He told Mr. Kramer he would love to step in if the role of Ned were to open up, and soon after he had his chance. It was the most profound work experience, Mr. Grey said. Reading it again felt so fresh to me, he added. I was startled at all the issues that still remain 25 years later. Mr. Grey directed a similar staged reading at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles in May, to raise money for an H.I.V./AIDS charity there.

Part of the problem with meritocracy is that it homogenizes in the name of diversity: It skims the cream from every race and class and population, puts all of the best and brightest through the same educational conveyor belt, and comes out with a ruling class thats cosmetically diverse but intellectually conformist, and that tends to huddle together rather than spreading out to enrich the country as a whole. This is Christopher Laschs lament in The Revolt of the Elites  that meritocracy co-opts people who might otherwise become its critics, sapping local communities of their intellectual vitality and preventing any kind of rival power centers from emerging. And its something that Angelo Codevilla gets right (while getting a number of other things wrong) in his recent blast against the American elite:",2010-07-19T13:36:43+0000

On Tuesday Mr. Moore, the Sicko and Bowling for Columbine filmmaker, called to discuss the lineup for his sixth-annual Traverse City Film Festival, which he holds each year to bring independent movies and their creators to that economically depressed Michigan town. Asked to pick a highlight or two from the festival, which runs this year from Tuesday to Aug. 1, Mr. Moore replied that one of the highlights is actually a lowlight. Im showing very, very few American independent feature films this year, he continued, because they simply  the great ones  dont exist. Mr. Moore said he hoped his festival would fill this gap with a lineup of foreign romantic comedies like Will You Marry Us? (from Switzerland), Castaway on the Moon (from South Korea) and Heartbreaker (from France), which he deemed superior to their American counterparts. Pending visa approvals, Mr. Moore said he hoped to bring some Cuban filmmakers to the festival.",2010-07-20T22:19:53+0000

The two-year grants, to be managed by the nonprofit Fund for the City of New York, will provide arts groups with general operating support. General support money is the hardest money to come by, Mary McCormick, the president of the fund, said. When money is so tight, it is what gives cultural groups some breathing room. The grants range from $65,000 to $250,000 for organizations with budgets of $75,000 to $7 million. Those selected will receive half of their money next week, Ms. McCormick said, and the remainder in June 2011. Groups in all five boroughs were evaluated on artistic excellence in dance, theater or music as well as their education programs.

The painter April Gornik told The Globe that she and the painter Eric Fischl, above, along with the video artist Bill Viola, decided not to take part in the show, Atmospheric Conditions, until the university makes a legally binding promise not to sell any works. In January 2009, as Brandeiss finances eroded, its trustees voted to transition the museum into a teaching center and gallery, followed by an orderly sale or other disposition of its works to raise money for the school. It backed off that plan and recently said it was working with Sothebys to make money by lending works from the collection or entering into partnerships with other institutions. Atmospheric Conditions will be replaced with an exhibition of the work of the Pop painter James Rosenquist, who told The Globe that he opposes sales from the collection but does not believe boycotting the Rose is the right strategy.",2010-07-20T22:25:55+0000

Ms. Hoffes mother, Esther, was the secretary to Max Brod, a close friend of Kafka who served as executor of his estate after he died in 1924. Although Kafka requested that all his personal papers be burned, Brod, who immigrated to Israel in 1939, never complied. The District Family Court judge in Tel Aviv who heard the case ordered attorneys to prepare a detailed list of the contents of four boxes that had been stored in a Zurich bank and opened on Monday. Haaretz reported that a handwritten short story by Kafka, never before seen, is among the papers. Several more safe-deposit boxes with Kafkas documents are also expected to be opened by the Tel Aviv court.

The Seven Stage a Comeback (think of Snow Whites diminutive compadres) is part of Grimm, a show that stitches together short plays largely by Boston-area playwrights, all inspired by Brothers Grimm fairy tales. The project was put together by Company One, a resident company at the Boston Center for the Arts, and runs there through Aug. 14. Mr. Maguire, who has written more than two dozen novels for adults and children, including Son of a Witch and Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, said he was intrigued by the idea of seven men with a female child growing up in their midst. Just because they were dwarfs doesnt mean they were neutered, Mr. Maguire said in an interview. If they had more complexity, what would they make of the story? The play is a more colloquial and action-packed version of his story by the same name, which appeared in the 2000 anthology The Wolf at the Door, a collection of reimagined fairy tales by a variety of writers. Company One approached Mr. Maguire to take part in the project. Among the other six playwrights in Grimm are Lydia R. Diamond (whose adaptation of Toni Morrisons Bluest Eye has played around the country) and Marcus Gardley, one of the writers of On the Levee, which just finished a run at LCT3, Lincoln Centers program for new directors and playwrights.",2010-07-22T22:04:48+0000

In February 2009 Lionsgate announced that it had paid $5.5 million for the rights to Precious, which won the Grand Jury Prize at that years Sundance festival. The announcement came as a surprise to Harvey Weinstein, who said he believed that his company had already struck a deal to buy the film. The studios sued each other, and a portion of that suit filed by the Weinstein Company against the producers of Precious was dismissed in September 2009 after a judge said the company did not have a signed agreement for the transfer of film rights. Matthew Gershman, a lawyer for Lionsgate, told Reuters that its dispute with the Weinstein Company was amicably resolved to both parties mutual satisfaction, but did not give further details. Precious was nominated for six Academy Awards and won two, for best supporting actress (MoNique) and adapted screenplay (Geoffrey S. Fletcher).",2010-07-23T21:46:45+0000

This week, Ken Davenport, the president of Davenport Theatrical Enterprises and a producer of Broadway and Off-Broadway productions including Oleanna and Altar Boyz, introduced an iPhone app called At the Booth. The program, which is sold for 99 cents, says on its Web site (atthebooth.com) that it lists all the Broadway and Off-Broadway shows available at the TKTS booth every day and at what price. On Friday, Victoria Bailey, the executive director of the Theater Development Fund, said in a statement that the fund was preparing its own iPhone application and was concerned that this recently released app may not provide an accurate picture of ticket availability and line lengths considering the fluidity of both.

He also plans to ask them to reimburse the government for those payouts and to halt any future ones until the taxpayer money is returned. Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master for compensation, put the six companies on a list of 17 banks that he found made $1.6 billion of questionable payments to senior bankers in 2008 and early 2009.

It was the story of one mans perception of his relationship with God. The book was rejected by the major publishing houses but was ultimately published in 1978 by a small, now defunct publisher, Baronet Books, which got it into establishment bookstores. It got no reviews, neither was it an instant commercial success. The response from adults who chanced on it, however, was warm and encouraging.

The monkeys were then taught to respond to a cue by choosing to look at one of two patterns. Computers reading the sensors were able to register the decision a fraction of a second before the monkeys eyes turned to the pattern. As the monkeys were not deliberating, but rather reacting to visual stimuli, researchers were able to plausibly claim that the computer could successfully predict the monkeys reaction.

According to The Art Newspaper the surface of Large Divided Oval: Butterfly had suffered from pollution and vandalism. The work, above, could not be restored in situ, so it was sent to the Noack Foundry in Berlin, where it was originally cast. Butterfly was initially a loan to the city of West Berlin in 1986. (It had been placed in front of the Congress Hall as part of Berlins 750th anniversary in 1987.) At the time the city council wanted the sculpture permanently and wrote to Moore asking if he would donate it. But the letter arrived just before his death and went unanswered.

Strong word of mouth, stellar reviews and hunger for original stories at the multiplex has fueled continued interest in the complicated film, directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Ms. Jolie, starring as a C.I.A. officer in Columbia Pictures Salt, was second with about $35.6 million. That result proved Ms. Jolie to be one of the few remaining stars who can anchor a major Hollywood release. The animated film Despicable Me (Universal Pictures) powered forward in third place, selling about $24.1 million for a new domestic total of $161.7 million and solidifying its position as one of the breakout hits of the year. The Sorcerers Apprentice, a flop that will likely result in a write-down at Walt Disney Studios, was fourth in its second weekend with $9.7 million ($42.6 million total). Disney-Pixars Toy Story 3 rounded out the top five with $9 million ($379.5 million total).

In an interview with The Times to promote his documentary South of the Border, which is about South American politics, Mr. Stone defended Hitler. Hitler was a Frankenstein, but there was also a Dr. Frankenstein, he said. German industrialists, the Americans and the British. He had a lot of support. Hitler did far more damage to the Russians than the Jewish people. Mr. Stone then proceeded to discuss what he called the Jewish domination of the media, adding with an expletive that Israel had messed up United States foreign policy for years. Bloggers quickly picked up on the comments, and the American Jewish Committee issued a news release condemning him. By invoking this grotesque, toxic stereotype, Oliver Stone has outed himself as an anti-Semite, the committees executive director, David Harris, said in the release. Mr. Stone, whose next Hollywood movie, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, will be released by 20th Century Fox on Sept. 24, has stirred controversy with his comments in this arena before. In January the director told a gathering of television critics that Hitler is an easy scapegoat while discussing his Showtime nonfiction mini-series, Secret History of America.

Random House said on Monday that Ms. Evanovich had jumped to its Ballantine Bantam Dell imprint; it acquired the world rights to four new novels, including two Stephanie Plum tales and two in Ms. Evanovichs Unmentionable series. Random House declined to disclose the financial terms of the contract. Ms. Evanovich has been with St. Martins Press since the publication of Four to Score, the fourth novel in her Stephanie Plum series, in 1998. Her last 11 novels have made their debut at No. 1 on The New York Timess best-seller list, and her 33 novels have combined sales of more than 75 million copies worldwide, according to Random House.",2010-07-26T21:53:14+0000

In a news release on Monday, ABC said that the presidential episode would be broadcast on Thursday. It will be taped on Wednesday. Mr. Obamas chat with the unpredictable co-hosts, including the staunch liberal Joy Behar and the equally staunch conservative Elisabeth Hasselbeck, is emblematic of his administrations outreach to unconventional media outlets. Given the difficulty of reaching people in this hyperactive media environment, we look for opportunities to reach people in environments that are not traditional forums for political newsmakers, Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, said in an e-mail message. Thats why we have been willing to have the president on Leno, Letterman and ESPN.

us,Authors Guild Weighs In On E-Books,"Last week it was the big book publisher and the big literary agent who sparred over who gets to make e-books out of titles that were published before there were such things. Now the Authors Guild has weighed in. In a letter to its members on Monday, the Guild said that publishers were largely to blame for the dispute between Random House and the literary agent Andrew Wylie, which came to a head last week when Mr. Wylie announced that he would begin his own venture to sell e-book rights for older books directly to Amazon, bypassing traditional publishers that have already released the books in print and have staked a claim to the e-book rights as well. Random House responded on Thursday by saying it would not do business with the Wylie Agency until the situation was resolved. The Guild estimated that the authors represented by Mr. Wylie in the e-books deal with Amazon would make three times the amount in royalties than traditional publishers were offering. The Guild, which has more than 8,000 members, saved some criticism for Mr. Wylie, however. That the Wylie/Odyssey agreement is reportedly exclusive raises many questions and concerns, the Guild said. Amazon has, time and again, wielded its clout in the industry ruthlessly, with little apparent regard for its relationships with authors or publishers or, for that matter, antitrust rules.",2010-07-26T21:58:56+0000

In trying to make a broader historical point about the range of atrocities the Germans committed against many people, I made a clumsy association about the Holocaust, for which I am sorry and I regret, Mr. Stone said in a statement. Jews obviously do not control media or any other industry. The fact that the Holocaust is still a very important, vivid and current matter today is, in fact, a great credit to the very hard work of a broad coalition of people committed to the remembrance of this atrocity  and it was an atrocity.

In a follow-up article on Monday, LOsservatore said the painting was not the work of that Italian master, who has received increased attention this year on the 400th anniversary of his death.

Producers Sued Over Image in Show,"A Brooklyn photographer is suing the producers of the Broadway musical Fela! in federal court for copyright and trademark infringement, seeking at least $150,000 in damages for their use of her 1977 photograph of the legendary Nigerian nightclub of the Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti. The lawsuit, filed on Monday in Manhattan, argues that the producers did not seek or have the permission of the photographer, Marilyn Nance, to use the image of the nightclub, known as the Shrine, in a projection shown during the musical. Ms. Nances lawyer, Edward C. Greenberg, said in an interview that the image is used during 40 percent of the show (with Sahr Ngaujah, above) and is rendered in a Fela! souvenir book. A spokesman for the production, Richard Kornberg, disputed that the image was displayed for 40 percent of the show, saying it was far less than that. He also said the projection was only a fragment of a photograph. Mr. Kornberg said that the producers had been unaware that the photograph was taken by Ms. Nance and that she had a copyright on it, and said the photo would be replaced by Thursday. He also noted that Ms. Nance did not seek copyright protection for the photograph until seeing the show on Broadway. Her lawyer, Mr. Greenberg, confirmed that timing.",2010-07-28T22:03:04+0000

On Wednesday it passed a key test when it was rolled from a wing onto center stage. The trial run was delayed by several hours when an inspecting engineer found that the metal structure under the stage needed some touch-up welding. Last spring the Met installed massive steel girders to support the part of the stage in the wing where the set will be stored between performances. Recently arrived from a warehouse outside Montreal, the set consists of two 26-foot towers that bear an axis on which planks can seesaw up and down into various configurations. The axis can rise and fall. A platform in front of the plank structure will be the site of 90 percent of the action, the Mets general manager, Peter Gelb, said. The sound of the hydraulic machinery used to reconfigure the set could be heard several levels below. John Sellars, the Mets assistant manager for technical issues, said the machinery would be soundproofed. Mr. Lepages concept revolves around sophisticated computer-driven projections, or virtual scenery, that will be cast onto the planks.

It will feature about 60 works by Mr. Wood, who also played with the Jeff Beck Group and the Faces before joining the Stones. In a telephone interview, Louis A. Zona, executive director of the Butler Institute, said the show was the culmination of more than four years spent trying to persuade Mr. Wood to exhibit his work there. He added that what impressed him about Mr. Woods work, which tends to depict his rock n roll colleagues, including Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, was not the celebrity of the man who created them but the quality of the art. He has done a number of cartoons, Dr. Zona said of Mr. Wood, spoofs on English culture, and they look like they were done by Daumier, just wonderful things.

Iran is the worlds fifth-largest exporter of crude oil, but a lack of refining capacity forces it to import about 30 percent of its gasoline. The plan to increase production was announced by the oil minister, Masoud Mirkazemi, who predicted that Iran would become a net exporter of gasoline by 2015. Benzene, a product derived from natural gas, can be further processed to produce gasoline for use in cars and other vehicles. Experts said, however, that the product would burn poorly and contain more impurities than regular gasoline, causing damage to engines. ",2010-07-29T00:14:33+0000

I am particularly fond of the shark pups  the size of my forearm or so  but the often-curious larger sharks (black tips in the shallow flats as well as Galapagos sharks on the deeper dives) can be a bit disconcerting, especially if you are concentrating on something else and only notice them as they swim past for a closer look. Other scientists have had close encounters with tiger sharks, but I have not yet seen them. I just see evidence of them on the turtles. When we are checking turtles over in the health analyses, we see healed wounds that make me crazy trying to figure out how the turtles survived.

In 1997 the painting was lent to the Museum of Modern Art for an exhibition of Schiele paintings and subpoenaed by the Manhattan district attorneys office amid claims that it did not rightfully belong to the Leopold, whose founder acquired it in 1954.

Some of them, she writes, mimicked natural hills: real earth had blown on to them to hold a growth of sparse grass and perhaps even a sinewy peppercorn or peach tree. But inside, they were burning: They had caught fire at some time or other in their years of disuse, and had continued to burn, night and day, ever since.

Four Fish raises important questions for people interested in food, about what fish we should be eating, what fish we should be farming, what fish we should (not) be catching in the sea.

The series about young people partying at the beach  its really that simple  was a sensation last winter for MTV, peaking at 4.8 million viewers for the finale.

This makes for a preserve that comes into its own just in time to bring a welcome hit of summer fruit to the holidays.

In the case, the deranged novelist Mansfield Tracy Walworth, largely forgotten now, but of some note in his own day, was shot to death by his son, Frank, in a Manhattan hotel room; Franks motivation, it seems, was his fathers brutal treatment of his mother, Ellen Walworth, one of the founders of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Mallon has high praise for OBriens crackerjack new history, and you should certainly read his elegant review first. But if we do say so, The New York Timess anonymous account on June 4, 1873, the day after the killing, is a surprisingly moving piece of journalism as well, full of passion and personal interest, a crackerjack little melodrama; such is the startling story, headlined A Terrible Parricide:",2010-07-30T21:31:41+0000
