us,Caught in Time,"What makes the 88 black-and-white photographs in ELIOT PORTER'S SOUTHWEST (John Macrae/Holt, Paper, $29.95) so moving is not how they show the sheer starkness of the American Southwest (though they do that), or how they evoke the feeling of the country at midcentury (though they also do that), but rather how they catch the particularity of a single place at a single time. Eliot Porter, who died in 1990 at the age of 88, became a photographer when he was 38, a few years after he met Alfred Stieglitz. Though Porter's color photographs are now far better known (indeed, this is the only one of his books that is not in color), it was his black-and-white work that captured Stieglitz's attention, and it is not hard to see why. In these photographs of the ranches, graveyards, canyons, mines, churches, mesas and forlorn streets of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Arizona, taken between 1939 and 1963, the resolution is almost eerie. How is it possible that in a photograph of a miner's house in Leadville, Colo., one can see not only the splintering planks of the house but also the individual shoots of the weeds in front of it and the stones of the mountain of scree behind? It is a more than human view, and there is something almost sad about it. Even if one had lived in that second, much of the detail would have been lost. One can see that this was the way that moment looked in all its unrecognized fullness.",1992-03-01T05:00:00+0000

Flames' Coach Out Doug Risebrough removed himself as coach of the floundering Flames last night, but that wasn't enough to halt his team's skid as the visiting Pittsburgh Penguins defeated Calgary, 6-3. Risebrough, who remains as the Flames' general manager, watched the game from the press box while assistant coach Guy Charron ran the team. Calgary (25-31-9) had given up 17 straight goals in losing its three previous games. (AP) North Stars 3, Capitals 1: Minnesota knocked out the former North Star Don Beaupre by scoring on three of its first seven shots and extended the Washington Capitals' winless streak to four games with a victory at Landover, Md., last night. Darcy Wakaluk had 21 saves for the North Stars, who were 1-7-0 in their previous eight games. Goals by Gaetan Duchesne, Mike Modano and Steve Maltais gave the North Stars a 3-0 lead after the first period and enabled them to coast past the struggling Capitals, who managed only three shots on goal in the opening 20 minutes. Beaupre lasted only 14:44 before being replaced by Jim Hrivnak. (AP) Whalers 4, Bruins 0: Hartford ended a 12-game regular-season winless streak against Boston as Peter Sidorkiewicz posted his second shutout in 10 days in a home-ice victory. (AP) Jets 4, Red Wings 3: Phil Sykes's goal with 5:26 to play broke a 3-3 tie and ended the visiting Jets' four-game losing streak. Danton Cole started the play by breaking through the Detroit defense. Goalie Greg Millen stopped his first shot and turned aside Cole's swipe at the rebound, but Sykes put in the third shot for his third goal of the season. (AP) Nordiques 4, Sabres 4: Mats Sundin scored on a penalty shot at 15:30 of the second period as the struggling Nordiques earned a tie with Buffalo in Quebec. Sundin was tripped on a breakaway by defenseman Doug Bodger after Pat LaFontaine had given away the puck. Sundin skated in on goaltender Tom Draper before firing a short wrist shot between his pads for his 24th goal. (AP) COLLEGE HOCKEY R.P.I. Stuns Vermont Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the 10th and last-place team in the ECAC Hockey tournament, defeated Vermont, 5-1, last night in a stunning first-round upset. The Engineers won before a capacity crowd of 4,035 at Gutterson Fieldhouse in Burlington, Vt., despite a home-ice advantage by the Catamounts that had seen visiting teams win only 16 per cent of ECAC Hockey playoff games in the last five seasons. Rensselaer was aggressive from the start, scoring two goals in the first period and two more before Vermont had one, in the third period. The victory sends Rensselaer to Harvard to play the Crimson, the ECAC regular-season first-place team, in a quarterfinal game at the Crimson rink on Saturday night. The semifinal and final games of the tournament will be played in Boston Garden on March 13 and 14. In other tournament games last night, Mercyhurst defeated Oswego State, 8-2, and Fredonia State over came Geneseo State, 4-2, in the ECAC West first round, a Division III tournament.

us,RESULTS PLUS,"N.H.L Nordiques Rout Whalers The Quebec Nordiques, without a victory in 38 consecutive games on the road, found a cure last night in Hartford, routing the Whalers, 10-4, behind Mats Sundin's five goals. Sundin, whose five goals broke a Quebec record held by Peter Stastny and Michel Goulet, also had two assists. The Nordiques had gone 0-28-10 away from home since beating the Whalers, 2-1, last March 10, and were 0-25-8 on the road this season. (AP) Bruins 2, Canucks 2: Defenseman Gord Murphy scored his first goal in nearly two months with five minutes gone in the third period to give Boston a tie with Vancouver on the Bruins' home ice. Murphy's 50-foot shot went off Vancouver defenseman Jyrki Lumme's stick and eluded goalie Troy Gamble. Nevertheless, the tie provided some comfort for Vancouver. The Smythe Division leader needs just one more tie to guarantee finishing the season above .500 for the first time in 15 years. (AP) North Stars 4, Red Wings 2: Todd Elik had two goals and two assists and Mike Modano added two goals as Minnesota beat Detroit on the Red Wings' home ice. It was the first time this season that the Red Wings had lost two consecutive games at home. Modano and Elik each scored in the first and third periods, with Elik having a hand in all the goals. (AP) Maple Leafs 5, Flames 5: Doug Gilmour scored two goals and set up another as Toronto tied Calgary in Calgary. It was the first game between the teams since the blockbuster trade earlier this season involving Gilmour and nine other players. Calgary was leading, 4-2, with under four minutes to play, but the Maple Leafs rallied with Gilmour's help. Gilmour was the player who precipitated the trade with his contract dispute with Calgary management. (AP) COLLEGE BASKETBALL Rice Is Rolling Rice's Marvin Moore scored a career-high 26 points and the Owls took advantage of foul-prone Texas for a 103-97 victory in Houston that gave them 20 triumphs in a regular season for the first time since the 1953-54 campaign. The Rice victory also kept the Longhorns from clinching a tie for the S.W.C. basketball title. Texas is tied with Houston for first place in the conference. Each has a 10-3 record. Texas, 20-10 for the season, is seeking its first outright league title since 1974. The Owls have an identical 20-10 season record. With their 8-6 league mark, the Owls have the No. 4 seed in the post-season conference tournament. (AP) Michigan State 72, Northwestern 55: Shawn Respert scored 20 points and Mike Peplowski added 17 to lead 13th-ranked Michigan State to a Big Ten victory over Northwestern in Evanston, Ill. The Spartans broke open a tight game with a 19-4 run sparked by Peplowski midway in the second half. The victory was the fifth in the last seven games for the Spartans (19-6 over all, 9-6 conference). (AP) Arizona 100, California 77: Sean Rooks and Damon Stoudamire each scored 16 points and Chris Mills 15 as fourth-ranked Arizona continued its quest for a fifth consecutive Pacific-10 Conference title by defeating California. Arizona (23-4, 12-3) used defensive pressure and superior height and experience to crunch the Golden Bears (8-17, 2-13), who started three freshmen. The Wildcats trailed league co-leaders U.C.L.A. and Southern Cal by one game entering the contest. The Wildcats finish their Pac-10 schedule at those schools next week. (AP) GOLF Couples Has Share of Lead Fred Couples, carving out an increasingly secure niche as America's top golfer, shot a six-under-par 66 yesterday in Miami and grabbed a share of the first-round lead of the Doral Ryder Open with Mike Smith, Steve Elkington and Loren Roberts.

But when reviewing I.B.M.'s performance last year, it really does seem reasonable for I.B.M. to reduce its force by 10 percent.

The end of the match came in the third round when Vidal staggered Cepeda badly enough for the refeee, Arthur Mercante Jr. to give Cepeda a standing eight count. But as Mercante started his count, the badly beaten Cepeda fell to the canvas. When Cepeda arose, Mercante waved an end to the bout. Vidal had not fought since September 1990 when he was stopped by Bryant Paden in eight rounds. With his victory, the unranked Vidal is now 32-7-1 with 20 knockouts. Cepeda, who fought and lost to Marcos Villasana for the World Boxing Council featherweight title in 1991, dropped to 23-2-1 with 17 knockouts. In an earlier bout, Tracy Harris Patterson knocked out Angel Levi-Mayor in 2 minutes 15 seconds of the first round of a scheduled 10-round bout. With his victory, Patterson is now 44-2 with 33 knockouts. Levi-Mayor has a 23-7-2 record, with 8 knockouts.

It was the fourth consecutive game in which the United States (1-4-1 this year) has been shut out. The United States has not scored in 385 minutes.

Perhaps women's history, like all the other courses trying to widen the killing narrowness of our academic canon, might better be called remedial history. Only with such help did I begin to understand that I was missing half of this pair of prodigies who had traveled together through the courts of Europe. Until Nannerl was 15 years old and was sent home to marry, each had been the other's only friend and companion.

The 49-year-old Floyd, who won his first tournament since 1986 on Sunday at the Doral Ryder Open, had five birdies in a row over the Weston Hills Country Club. His score was matched by Keith Clearwater, who finished tied for second at Doral, and Mike Donald. Fulton Allem, Lance Ten Broeck, Greg Kraft and Greg Hickman were a stroke behind with 67's. Six Birdies Lift Bradley: Pat Bradley, last year's scoring leader and the newest of 12 members of the Ladies Professional Golf Association Hall of Fame, got her sixth birdie on the last hole yesterday to take a one-shot lead in the first round of the $400,000 Ping-Welch's Championship in Tucson, Ariz. Bradley's five-under-par 67 was one shot ahead of Dottie Mochrie. Dale Eggeling, playing with Mochrie, was the first to reach five under, but she bogeyed two holes late in the round and settled into a three-way deadlock with Hollis Stacy and Anne-Marie Palli at 69. (AP) BOXING Vidal Upsets Cepeda Jose Vidal of the Bronx scored an upset Wednesday night at the Paramount when he knocked out a world-ranked featherweight, Ricardo Cepeda, at two minutes of the third round of a scheduled 10-round bout. The end of the match came in the third round when Vidal staggered Cepeda badly enough for the refeee, Arthur Mercante Jr., to give Cepeda a standing eight count. But as Mercante started his count, the badly beaten Cepeda fell to the canvas. When Cepeda arose, Mercante waved an end to the bout. Vidal had not fought since September 1990 when he was stopped by Bryant Paden in eight rounds. With his victory, the unranked Vidal is 32-7-1 with 20 knockouts. Cepeda dropped to 23-2-1 with 17 knockouts. In an earlier bout, Tracy Harris Patterson knocked out Angel Levi-Mayor in 2 minutes 15 seconds of the first round of a scheduled 10-round bout. With his victory, Patterson is 44-2 with 33 knockouts. Levi-Mayor has a 23-7-2 record with 8 knockouts.

She had been City Council president when Mayor Gerald McCann was forced out, convicted on Federal fraud charges, making her acting Mayor. A great deal of Council bickering ensued over who would be named interim Mayor. Last Thursday, after a month in which the eight members of the Council were unable to assemble the five votes needed to elect any of 13 candidates, they ceded the job to her. The 56-year-old Mayor, who will serve until a special election in November or until the Council re-organizes, possibly in July, has taken a leave of absence from her job as director of the Education-Business Alliance for the city's Board of Education.

Chills and a fever first sent the 64-year-old Mayor to the hospital last Sunday. He was released Monday but re-hospitalized after the symptoms worsened. The trouble: diverticulitis, an inflammation of the large intestine that caused sacs to form, then abscess, sending bacteria into the bloodstream. Tests showed the bacteria were clostridium perfringens, not clostridium bovis, the only type that's a possible indicator for colon cancer, doctors said. The Mayor plans to return to City Hall at least part time early this week. He'll receive antibiotics intravenously several times a day for several days. If the treatment doesn't work, surgery could be necessary, doctors said. The Mayor has been advised to cut back on certain foods, including nuts.

Now the William Blake Trust, in association with Princeton University Press, has initiated a five-volume facsimile series of Blake's illuminated books. The first two volumes, JERUSALEM: The Emanation of the Giant Albion (Blake Trust/ Princeton University, $75) and SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND OF EXPERIENCE (Blake Trust/Princeton University, $59.50), are currently available. Produced with meticulous care, each has a brief introduction -- for ""Jerusalem,"" by Morton D. Paley, a professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley; for ""Songs of Innocence and of Experience,"" by Andrew Lincoln, a lecturer in English at the University of London.

us,Heir Apparent at Time Warner Is Out Amid Signs of Dissension,"Time Warner Inc. said yesterday that N. J. Nicholas Jr., the designated successor to the company's chairman, Steven J. Ross, had resigned and would be replaced by Gerald M. Levin, the vice chairman. Many in the company saw the unexpected resignation as a result of a clash between Mr. Ross and Mr. Nicholas, whose total 1990 compensation of $96.4 million made them the nation's highest-paid executives. But it also meant the collapse of a succession agreement central to the 1990 merger of two corporate empires, Warner Communications and Time Inc., to form the world's largest media company. Mr. Ross and Mr. Nicholas fell out over the company's ultimately successful search for foreign investors, according to two people closely involved in the company's affairs. Mr. Ross wanted to sell minority interests while maintaining control of all the company's properties, while Mr. Nicholas sought other ways for the heavily indebted company to raise money. Expressed No Regrets The company said Mr. Levin -- like Mr. Nicholas, a longtime employee of Time Inc. -- would serve as Time Warner's president and co-chief executive, the title that Mr. Nicholas had shared with Mr. Ross. Mr. Ross, the former chief executive of Warner Communications Inc., and Richard Munro, the former chairman of Time Inc., had agreed at the time of the merger that Mr. Nicholas would first share executive authority, then take charge by himself in the mid-1990's. Although the company's statement simply said Mr. Nicholas resigned, Mr. Ross, in a memo to employees, expressed no regrets and left no doubt that he favored Mr. Nicholas's departure. Several who know Mr. Nicholas well say he was intent on remaining with the company but was forced out. Mr. Ross, 64 years old, is an obsessive deal maker known for fostering loyal and skilled managers. Lately, he has been undergoing intensive chemotherapy for prostate cancer and since December has scarcely been seen at the office. Even if he returns, it is widely expected that he will focus chiefly on strategy, leaving operations to Mr. Levin. Mr. Levin and Mr. Nicholas, both 52 years old, have long been rivals. Mr. Levin was dropped from Time's board in the early 1980's as Mr. Nicholas advanced, but it was Mr. Levin who conceived of the Warner merger to further the company's global ambitions. Strong Ties Forged Since then, say some executives, Mr. Levin has forged strong ties with Warner officials, including Mr. Ross, while Mr. Nicholas did not develop the same rapport. According to one executive at Time Warner, Mr. Nicholas was asked to come back from his vacation home in Vail, Colo., for an unscheduled board meeting, but chose not to do so. The board approved the changes unanimously. Mr. Nicholas's wife, reached in Vail, said her husband would not comment. Graef S. Crystal, a leading expert on executive compensation, said Mr. Ross received compensation of $82.6 million, Mr. Nicholas $13.8 million and Mr. Levin $8.6 million in 1990. The company has disputed Mr. Crystal's figures, which include bonuses and stock options. Wall Street analysts said yesterday that they thought the news, which came after the stock market closed, was favorable for the company. ""The most important ingredient for the leader of the company, and the area in which Steve excels, is broad stratetgic thinking,"" said Emanuel Gerard, a partner at Gerard Klauer Mattison, an investment firm. ""I think Jerry is a much stronger strategic thinker than Nick and has a broader base of support from both the Time and Warner people."" Industry analysts credit Mr. Nicholas, a reserved and rather formal executive, with building Time Inc.'s cable operations and watching over the company's spending. 'Difference in Philosophy' But several executives said Mr. Ross's illness, and the uncertainities it raised, had helped pushed the board to change the line of succession yesterday. But one person with close ties to the company added that such a shift was only a question of timing. ""I think there has been a very, very real difference in philosophy between the two men for some time,"" he said. He said Mr. Nicholas had initially opposed Time Warner's decision to sell a stake in its entertainment business to the Toshiba Corporation and C. Itoh and Company, two big Japanese companies, because he opposed bringing in foreign investors. Mr. Nicholas preferred to sell some properties outright, a course that Mr. Ross opposed. Ultimately, Mr. Nicholas voted for the Toshiba deal. ""You patch things up for a while, but they do not go away,"" said this person, who has detailed knowledge of the company's affairs. ""Jerry was much more in tune with Steve's vision."" Indeed, Mr. Levin had accompanied Mr. Ross to Japan to negotiate the deal. Another person with close ties to the company said Mr. Ross had approached the board about designating a new heir. In yesterday's memo, Mr. Ross acknowledged that he and Mr. Nicholas had clashed over the company's direction. ""Nick's decision was based on his sense that there was sufficient difference regarding our strategic focus, between him on the one hand and the board and his management colleagues on the other,' Mr. Ross's memo said. Mr. Ross said that Mr. Nicholas had left with ""a sense of great and well-deserved pride"" in the company's achievements and ""a host of friendships forged during the merger."" As for Mr. Levin, Mr. Ross was effusive, saying he ""had been unfailingly impressed by Jerry's judgment, his insightful understanding of all our businesses and his commitment to fully realizing Time Warner's enormous potential."" In two years, Mr. Levin has come to be a favorite with the board, distinguishing himself in explaining complicated financial and strategic actions. Mr. Levin had a good sense ofthe board members' personalities and outlooks, one person close to the board said. Several executives in the industry say Mr. Levin was also well liked by Warner's chairman, Robert Daly, and its president, Terry Semel, and had a strong knowledge of the movie business from his days at Home Box Office Inc., a Time Warner cable television subsidiary. Mr. Nicholas, meanwhile, did not manage to form alliances with the top executives at Warner Brothers, the movie studio, and Warner Records, one executive said. Praise for Rising Executive Yesterday's news shows that Mr. Levin made a strong comeback. Until yesterday, Mr. Levin had served as chief operating officer, but had gradually been accruing power for a year. Mr. Levin was also a favorite of Mr. Ross's closest confidant, Ed Aboudi, who worked with Mr. Ross in negotiating the merger. In a recent interview, Mr. Aboudi spoke glowingly of Mr. Levin but failed to mention Mr. Nicholas. In Los Angeles, film executives predicted that the shift would have no substantive effect on Warner Brothers. Officials at the studio declined to comment. But film executives close to the studio said the parent company had adopted a hands-off policy towards decision-making, even on controversial Warner films, like Oliver Stone's ""J.F.K."" ""It's always been a hands-off operation, and we expect that it will continue to be so,"" said one film executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The executive said the emergence of Mr. Levin was viewed positively in the film community. ""You've got a guy who comes more from the creative side, like Steve Ross,"" as opposed to someone with a numbers bent, he said. ime Warner Inc. said yesterday that N. J.

Their first steps in the new land were taken on a pinpoint of an island in New York harbor, in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. ELLIS ISLAND: An Illustrated History of the Immigrant Experience (Macmillan, $49.95) is a vivid description of the island and its peak years as an admitting station, between 1892 and 1924. The authors -- Ivan Chermayeff, the vice president of the American Institute of Graphic Art; Fred Wasserman, a former official of the Ellis Island Immigration Museum; and Mary J. Shapiro, the author of ""Gateway to Liberty"" -- have put between covers the equivalent of an actual visit to the Ellis Island Immigration Museum. The book describes, often in their own words, the immigrants and the officials and social workers who played a part in the great influx. Lavishly produced with reproductions of historical documents and more than 400 pictures, many in color, ""Ellis Island"" dramatically re-creates the story of the immigrants from journey's start to journey's end.

Isabel Hall, Jackson Heights, Queens Answer: No. Your tax liability would have less to do with the balance in your accounts at the end of the year than with how the income was earned. Robert Kobel, a spokesman for the New York office of the Internal Revenue Service, said Federal tax rules give residential co-ops options in calculating their income taxes. As a corporate entity you could elect to be taxed as a regular corporation according to a graduated scale based on income.

It seems to be, as someone has said, an art primarily about style, its moral sensibility implicit in the porcelain-white, glazed faces in some of its figures -- chilly, curiously childlike, far removed from the social and psychic imperatives that have motivated art in recent years.",1992-03-29T05:00:00+0000

us,A Bear for All Seasons,"The Yavapai Indians of Arizona said that bears were like humans without fire. This anthropomorphism informed native Americans' ambiguous relationship with the bear, a symbol of dangerous, irrational power but also a reliable source of winter meat and thus of survival. GIVING VOICE TO BEAR: North American Indian Rituals, Myths, and Images of the Bear (Roberts Rinehart, $25) is an engrossing and accessible anthropological study that evokes the essential atmosphere of spirituality that pervaded that relationship. David Rockwell's account, at once sober and magical, covers the bear's roles as everything from folk-tale figure to benevolent guardian spirit to Jungian archetype of human consciousness. Hibernation suggested resurrection, so bear images were used in initiations and other rituals marking rebirth and renewal, the participants in which were sometimes thought to metamorphose into bears. Because the animals dug for roots, they were thought to be the medicine men of the wild and were thus associated with shamanism and healing. There were also elaborate hunting ceremonies to insure that bears would continue to give themselves up for the kill. Focusing on one aspect of American Indian life, Mr. Rockwell, the president of C.W. Natural Resource Consulting in Arlee, Mont., has written a coherent and comprehensible introduction to tribal attitudes, customs and rituals. It is a stirring reminder of what it was like to be alive when being human meant living intimately with nature.",1992-03-29T05:00:00+0000

The expressions of the human and mythical figures suggest that the artist was depicting more than people at leisure, and over the years dozens of exegeses have been offered only to be found wanting. Now comes Randall L. Skalsky, a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts, with what appears to be the snuggest analysis yet. Focusing not on the six human figures but on the architecture in the scene, he noticed that an arch looked like the Greek letter pi. From this and the details it unraveled, Mr. Skalsky, whose theory was initially rejected by academic journals, was finally able to convince skeptics that the frieze was a visual representation of Catullus's poem ""The Marriage of Peleus and Thetis."" He has accepted one of two offers to publish his monograph and the 43-year-old Mr. Skalsky -- he took the scenic route to higher education -- is to receive a master's degree in May.",1992-03-29T05:00:00+0000

The feat would seem to make the big wrestler eligible for elevation to the sport's grand championship rank, yokozuna, but sumo officials are mulling it over very carefully. The designation acknowledges not just a fleeting tournament title, but a great career combined with a subtle aura of sumo spirit known as hinkaku. And many Japanese, including unreserved admirers of Konishiki's prowess, simply deny that a foreign-born wrestler can achieve hinkaku, even if, like Konishiki, he speaks Japanese, has a Japanese wife and reportedly has applied for citizenship. Born Salevaa Astinoe, the 28-year-old Konishiki has taken no public part in the debate. Sooner or later he will either get the designation, or not.
