The economy generated 456,000 new jobs in March, nearly twice the growth that analysts had expected. At the same time, the unemployment rate, which is calculated from a separate survey of the nation's households, was unchanged at 6.5 percent. [ Page 1. ] Employment in New York City increased sharply in March, but was little changed in New York State and New Jersey, the agency said. [ 36. ] Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani won the crucial approval of the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation to use a $200 million surplus to pay for severance packages the Mayor hopes will cut 7,600 jobs from New York City's municipal work force. [ 1. ] Markets The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 7.26 percent, the highest since January 1993, in limited and thin holiday trading, reacting to the surprisingly strong jobs data. The price of the long-bond dropped, but the decline may have been exaggerated by the absence of many investors on Good Friday. The stock market and most futures markets were closed.

The recent decline, which has become more intractable day by day, is seen, at best, as being part of a ""correction"" -- a retreat of roughly 10 to 15 percent from a market high. If this is just a correction, sunny days may not be far away. But some investors are worrying about a full-blown bear market -- a prolonged decline.

Captain Video","The artist Nam June Paik was described by one critic as a ""terrorist of esthetic expectations."" It was an understandable label given his antic performance pieces of the 1960's, when as part of the avant-garde Fluxus movement he stunned onlookers with piano demolitions, imageless films and a now-legendary topless cello concert performed by his sidekick Charlotte Moorman. These days, Mr. Paik's focus has shifted from performance art to multi-screen television installations and global satellite productions. Nonetheless his Dadaist impulses persist, often taking the form of more subtle acts of esthetic subversion, like using magnets to destroy the normal functions of a bank of television monitors, or staging events like ""The First Accident of the 21st Century,"" a choreographed collision between a robot and an automobile driven by a friend. NAM JUNE PAIK: Video Time -- Video Space (Abrams, $49.50) is a lavishly illustrated, highly eclectic survey of the artist's career, from his early Fluxus days in Germany to his experiments with video technology and room-sized video environments in the 1970's and 80's. Rather than presenting Mr. Paik's career chronologically, the editors -- Toni Stooss, director of the Kunsthalle Vienna, and Thomas Kellein, director of the Kunsthalle Basel -- have mixed previously published articles by critics and museum curators with new writings and reminiscences by friends, fellow artists and Mr. Paik himself. The results are uneven, though there are memorable surprises, including a sly interview with John Cage, whose music was a major influence on Mr. Paik, and an evocative essay by the feminist writer Kate Millett recalling the near-utopian idealism of the New York art scene in the early 1960's. Other contributors include the architect Arata Isozaki and the poet Allen Ginsberg. This is a provocative book that chronicles not only Mr. Paik's career but also 30 years of changes in the international art world.ANDREA BARNET",1994-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Just The Good Parts,"CHERIE BUTLER, ""in my 30's."" AGENCY: FordRATE: $312.50 an hour.PARTS MODELED: Lips and hands.ADS THEY'VE APPEARED IN: Revlon, Cover Girl, Nestle, Bill Blass, Creme de Grand Marnier.WHAT MAKES GREAT LIPS: Mostly it's the shape. Some clients want them really full, others want them pouty. Mine tend to be peaked. A lot depends upon how the lips look on the product. If it's for a soda ad, where you're sipping on a straw, they will literally Polaroid numerous girls in that exact same position to see how those lips form on the straw. WHY LIPS AND HANDS GO TOGETHER: In the past, they would hire someone with the perfect lips they wanted and a second person with the perfect hands and they would put them together. Now they would rather hire one person because when you use your own hands, you tend to be more expressive. PART THAT EARNS THE MOST MONEY: Hands. There are many more ads that use hands than just lips, but lips tend to be in more glamorous ads, unless you're doing a cold sore. FAVORITE COMPLIMENT: I was once referred to by a photographer who's been in the business a long time as the Frank Perdue of models because of all my fine parts. SOMETHING A PALM READER ONCE SAW IN MY HAND: I'd have a long life, I could be married once or twice and I'd probably have two kids. So far I've been married once. THINGS I DO THAT OTHER HAND MODELS DON'T: Dishes, break bread, shake hands. I was once on the set with another model when the backdrop fell. The normal response would be to put your hands up and protect your head. For her that wasn't even a possibility. THINGS I NEVER DO: Knock on wood, schedule dental work before a lips audition. PEOPLE I'VE BEEN HANDS FOR: Mostly cosmetic contract models: Christie Brinkley, Carol Alt, Isabella Rossellini. SOMEONE'S HANDS I'D LIKE TO BE: Venus de Milo, if she had arms.",1994-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Just The Good Parts,"MICHAEL ALAN ROSS, 38 AGENCY: McDonald/RichardsRATE: $250 an hour.BODY PARTS MODELED: Feet, hands. ADS MY FEET HAVE APPEARED IN: Dr. Scholl's, Foster's beer, Rockport shoes, Bass shoes.WORK MY HANDS HAVE DONE: Turning over an hourglass in an American Express commercial, putting on lots of surgical stuff for Johnson & Johnson. BEST PART ABOUT BEING A PARTS MODEL: You're unrecognizable. You can work for one shoe company one day and another the next and there's no conflict. WORST PART: Since you're unrecognizable, you don't get residuals. BEST PART ABOUT BEING A HAND MODEL: You don't have to be handy, lend a hand, do the lawn. WORST PART: Neighbors laugh at you as your girlfriend trims the hedges. HOW I PREPARE FOR A FOOT JOB: I wear very loosely tied sneakers without socks so there aren't any marks left on my ankles or feet. HOW I BECAME A FOOT MODEL: A man's shoe usually looks best proportioned in size 8-D (a woman's is size 6-B). It's easy to find a foot that size and put a shoe and sock on it, but if you take all that off and do a bare foot, that's more lucrative and I have pretty decent feet if I maintain them. WHERE I GET MY PEDICURE: Gold Finger in South Orange, N.J. The trick is to have the nails shaped consistently across the tips of the toes so the foot looks balanced. SOMEONE'S SHOES I'D LOVE TO FILL: Harrison Ford's. A RULE OF THUMB: What looks best to the camera is usually the most uncomfortable for you. In the Rockport poster, you just see these legs with boots, climbing up a wall. What you don't see is me hanging on for dear life from the side of the rocks, the ocean crashing beneath me, or that we're shooting at 5 A.M.

(A 16th-century refrain quips: ""In Madrid, wild city/ that between the old and new/has 300 taverns/and not a single library."") For centuries kings and their courts fled to the bustling taverns around the royal palace to escape the pressures of public life and to engage in romantic trysts.

Fernandez, seeded fifth, was eliminated in a second-round match, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, by 144th-ranked Petra Langrova of the Czech Republic. Fernandez has not won a tournament in more than a year. She had not competed since February when her title defense at Indian Wells, Calif., ended prematurely with a loss to Amanda Coetzer in the quarterfinals. Fernandez underwent surgery last year for endometriosis, a gynecological condition, and continues to experience side effects from the medication she takes to prevent the problem from recurring. Yesterday she complained of fatigue, but she attributed the loss to Langrova's dogged and error-free play in the third set. In other matches, third-seeded Martina Navratilova defeated Silke Frankl, 6-1, 6-1; sixth-seeded Lindsay Davenport trounced Radka Bobkova, 6-3, 6-0; Coetzer downed Larisa Neiland, 6-2, 6-2, and seventh-seeded Mary Pierce defeated Irina Spirlea, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). Top-Seeded Players Win: Pete Sampras, Michael Chang and Boris Becker won second-round matches in the Japan Open in Tokyo. Sampras, the defending champion, scored a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) victory over a Russian, Andrei Olhovskiy. Chang rebounded from a 1-5 deficit in the second set for a 6-1, 7-6 (7-2) victory over his fellow American Doug Flach. Becker beat a Frenchman, Stephane Simian, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5).

Panthers Tie Flyers Gord Murphy's slow, 40-foot backhand shot beat Philadelphia goalie Tommy Soderstrom at 6 minutes 11 seconds of the third period and pulled the visiting Florida Panthers into a 3-3 tie with the Philadelphia Flyers last night. The lazy backhand capped a comeback from a two-goal deficit. ""I lost it on the way,"" said Soderstrom. The Flyers were without Eric Lindros, their leader and top goal-scorer. He suffered a sprain and ligament tears in his right shoulder Monday and probably will miss the final four regular-season games. (AP) Blues 6, Kings 2: Brendan Shanahan scored twice for the second consecutive game at St. Louis. The Blues star has seven goals in his last six games and is zeroing in on his second consecutive 50-goal season, with 47 goals and four games remaining. (AP) N.B.A. Nuggets Boost Chances Dikembe Mutombo had 11 blocked shots for the second straight game and also had 13 points and 13 rebounds as Denver broke Seattle's nine-game winning streak and improved its playoff chances with a 104-90 home victory last night. The Nuggets now have a three-game lead over the Los Angeles Lakers for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot. Reggie Williams led all scorers with 24 points as the Nuggets broke their four-game losing streak. (AP) Rockets 134, Warriors 102: The Houston Rockets set a franchise record for 3-point shooting, and Hakeem Olajuwon got his eighth career triple double in a victory over the visiting Golden State Warriors. Houston made 75 percent (12 of 16) of its long-range shots. Olajuwon had 26 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. (AP) Jazz 99, Mavericks 82: Karl Malone scored 25 points, and Felton Spencer 17 with 14 rebounds as Utah beat Dallas at Salt Lake City. (AP) TENNIS Sunshine for Sabatini After fumbling through a first set in which her serve failed four times, fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini won 10 straight games and 12 of the last 13, producing a 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 victory over Amanda Coetzer in the Bausch & Lomb Championships yesterday in Amelia Island, Fla. ""The good thing was, I maintained my mind in the match, kept my mind tough,"" said Sabatini.

Last year our reviewer, Meg Wolitzer, called the book ""a subtle, complicated, often astonishing collection."" RACE MATTERS By Cornel West. Vintage, $9. The title of this book has a double meaning: it is a work devoted to racial issues in America, and it also examines the extent to which these issues matter in shaping our institutions. Cornel West, who has added a new epilogue to this edition, demonstrates the divisiveness of racial interactions in essays on subjects like black-Jewish relations and white fear of black sexuality.

us,The Way They Looked,"At the beginning of the 1904 baseball season, an amateur photographer wandered onto the playing field at the Polo Grounds and asked the star pitcher of the New York Giants to pose. Christy Mathewson obliged with a demonstration of his ""body swing"" -- now called a windup -- and Charles M. Conlon embarked on a 38-year career in which he virtually invented the iconography of the national pastime. Through 1942, Conlon (1868-1945) spent his summers carting his bulky Graflex camera (which until 1934 used glass negatives) to various ball parks to capture images of the players in action and in repose -- images so vivid and fresh that ""ballplayers from another era are standing in the sunshine of the 20th century,"" as Neal McCabe and Constance McCabe write in BASEBALL'S GOLDEN AGE: The Photographs of Charles M. Conlon (Abrams, $29.95). Conlon remained an amateur photographer -- he was a proofreader at The New York Evening Telegram -- but his avocation made him ""de facto the official photographer of baseball,"" one whose visions of the sport were seen annually for decades in Baseball magazine, the annual baseball guides, The Sporting News and baseball textbooks. Conlon once reminisced, ""The fun I have had, the days in the open, the associations, the confidences I have enjoyed -- well, you can't buy those things."" The 205 shots Constance McCabe, a photography conservator, has chosen from the 8,000 surviving Conlon negatives convey the eternally fresh wonder a spectator might feel at being in the open air alongside John McGraw squatting by third base, or watching Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig warm up on the sidelines. Thanks to excellent production, and a brilliant job of design by Carol Robson, great names from the recesses of baseball antiquity come vividly to life, from Honus Wagner, Napoleon Lajoie, Ty Cobb, Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, Frank Chance and Walter Johnson to Grover Cleveland Alexander, Jimmie Foxx, Rogers Hornsby and Tris Speaker. Ms. McCabe's brother, Neal, brought his lifelong enthusiasm for baseball to his research on Conlon and his subjects; the text offers delightful nuggets of information about the innumerable firsts that Conlon recorded: the first American League umpire, the first batter in the World Series, the first photo on a baseball bubble-gum card. ""Baseball's Golden Age"" is equally enthralling in image and word and amply illustrates the timeless fascination of the field of dreams. MICHAEL ANDERSON",1994-04-10T05:00:00+0000

The English novelist Anthony Hope once wrote that ""good families are generally worse than any others,"" and my husband's family, a large, congenial group, is a very good family. Like most American families, it is diverse -- its numbers include artists and mortgage bankers, builders and businessmen, a geographer and an elephant trainer -- and, like most, it has no familial homestead. Its members are scattered across the points of the compass, as far west as Oklahoma and Texas and as far east as Japan. So early in 1993, Marjorie and Karl rolled out a map, push-pinned the location of family members in the United States, and picked a point roughly midway between: Tennessee. Then they set out from their home in Washington on a 1,200-mile pilgrimage in search of a park in that state that might satisfy the brood. They deliberately sidestepped any place near Nashville -- they wanted the family together for the whole weekend, not wandering off on side trips to the Grand Ole Opry. They settled on Fall Creek Falls, on the western edge of the Cumberland Plateau in eastern Tennessee, a 16,800-acre park that has an inn, cabins, tennis courts, an 18-hole championship golf course, horseback-riding, an Olympic pool, boating on a 350-acre lake stocked with largemouth bass, channel cat and bluegill, all surrounded by some spectacular natural scenery.",1994-04-10T05:00:00+0000

Then, too, Martinique -- a department of France, along with Guadeloupe, on the west side of the Atlantic Ocean -- was said to be less than hospitable to Americans, particularly those who don't speak French; indeed, 65 percent of tourists who visit the island are from France.

us,NEWS SUMMARY,"International A3-11 NATO HITS SERBS AGAIN NATO conducted its second air strike against the Bosnian Serbs in two days after they failed to stop shelling the town of Gorazde, and the attacks finally stopped. A1 RESTRAINT IN BOSNIA ATTACKS The United States portrayed the bombing of Serb positions in Bosnia as a demonstration of its resolve to stop their attacks, but the NATO military operation was actually modest and restrained. A10 News analysis: The West is hoping that the Serbs bow to force. A10 SOUTH AFRICA, IN THE HUSTINGS South Africa has undertaken a vigorous voter education campaign leading up to its first all-race election, appealing to people's sense of historic duty and opportunity. A1 Troops have not halted Zulu violence in South Africa. A8 Henry Kissinger will help mediate in South Africa. A8 WILDLIFE TRADE PUNISHED The Clinton Administration said it was imposing trade sanctions on Taiwan for refusing to halt the sale of tiger and rhinoceros parts. D1 RWANDA REFUGEES LOOK BACK Westerners evacuated from Rwanda, many of them church workers, spoke with anguish of the fate of friends they had left behind and looked to the day when they would be able to return. A6 RWANDA REBELS CLOSE IN Rebels were closing in on the capital of Rwanda as Western nations struggled to complete the evacuation of their nationals. Reports said fighting continued both inside and outside the capital, Kigali. A6 The deadline for Palestinian self-rule will change. A7 Citing violence, the Pope has canceled a Lebanon visit. A7 NO SHOO-IN FOR MEXICO While the ruling party's presidential candidate is expected to win in Mexico, voter dissatisfaction and party infighting are expected to make the race a difficult challenge. A3 A former East German official was sentenced in a bombing. A11 A suicide was troubling for France's President. A11 Hanoi Journal: Fiction with a dissident's sting. A4 National A12-15 BLEAK VIEW OF CHILDREN A wide-ranging three-year study found a bleak picture for millions of American children: disintegrating families, poverty, child abuse and poor health care threatening their chances of growing to become whole adults. A1 CORPORATE-PAID THERAPY To curb costs of treating workers for mental illness and substance abuse, companies are measuring treatment in a way that cuts expenses but also tries to apply a precision to psychotherapy that worries therapists. A1 FREEWAY SUCCESS STORY The Santa Monica Freeway, a vital artery Southern California's road system, is reopening two months earlier than officials expected after repairs of its severe earthquake damage. A12 MEDICARE FUNDS IN PERIL The Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the elderly will run out of money in seven years and a separate trust fund that pays benefits to disabled workers will be exhausted next year if Congress does not act. A12 INQUIRY IN AIR FORCE CRASH An especially volatile type of jet fuel is being investigated as a possible contributing factor to the high death toll in a crash at Pope Air Force Base last month. A13 RON BROWN IN ACTION Washington at Work: Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown was temporarily detoured from the Washington fast track, but now he is back, and doings things Democrats could scarcely have imagined: building alliances with business. A14 SELLING THE CRIME BILL President Clinton urged local and state law officers at a Justice Department rally to put pressure on members of Congress to pass anticrime legislation. A14 A CLINTON CORRECTION The White House said a 1980 profit of $6,498 for Hillary Rodham Clinton in commodities trades was not reported to the I.R.S., and the Clintons have paid more that $14,000 in back Federal and state taxes. A15 A trucking company closed, leaving striking Teamsters jobless. A12 Accusations of forged signatures in radiation experiments. A15 Metro Digest B1 SIDE EFFECTS OF MAYOR'S VICTORY Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani emerged from his weekend confrontation with the Schools Chancellor largely with what he wanted: a mayoral appointee to look into school finances. But his confrontational style may have used up some of the good will he needs for his long-term agenda. A1 WELFARE LURE SHIFTS The view of New York City as a place attracting waves of poor people with relatively generous welfare benefits, if ever true, exists no more, fresh census findings reveal. Instead, in the late 1980's, New York City appears to have become a net exporter of welfare families. A1 Obituaries B10 Dr. Jerome Lejeune, geneticist.

Through a Lens, Radically","Tina Modotti's life had a great trajectory, and the journalist Margaret Hooks, the author of ""Guatemalan Women Speak,"" traces that arc with grace in TINA MODOTTI: Photographer and Revolutionary (Pandora/HarperCollins, $40). Born in Italy in 1896, Modotti emigrated in 1913 to the United States, where her natural beauty led to modeling jobs and roles in silent films. In Los Angeles she met Edward Weston, who documented her allure in some of his best-known photographs. They became lovers and traveled to Mexico together in 1923, where Modotti served as Weston's apprentice. Within a year, he returned to the States, leaving Modotti to run his studio; her career as a professional photographer soon took off. Poverty in Mexico affected her profoundly, and she began using her art to protest social injustice. She became a member of the Mexican Communist Party, and in 1930 she was deported. From then on, living in Berlin, Moscow, Paris or Spain (during its civil war), she more or less gave up taking pictures; her life revolved around radical politics. Offered the position of official photographer of the Soviet Communist Party, she turned it down. ""While she was too devoted to the party to risk disapproval or expulsion,"" Ms. Hooks writes, ""Tina was too much of an artist to see her work reduced to mere propaganda."" Modotti's output comprises a scant 400 photographs, about 100 of which are reproduced in this book. They speak eloquently of her gift, revealing a true artistic eye and a formalist's sense of composition. Modotti died in Mexico City in 1942 at the age of 45, but she lives on through her art; her photograph ""Roses"" sold for $165,000 at Sotheby's in 1991.

And last week, the pitch rising daily, the generals themselves faced off. The subject was tobacco. Industry leaders had come to Capitol Hill to answer charges of manipulating nicotine levels to fine-tune smokers' addiction. Yes, they said, nicotine levels change, but that's to enhance flavor. Is smoking addictive? A chorus of ""no""s. Does it cause lung cancer? ""It may,"" said James Johnston of R.J. Reynolds. But Andrew Tisch of Lorillard said, ""I do not believe that."" At one point Mr. Johnston lashed out, ""If cigarettes are too dangerous to be sold, then ban them."" Next to the executives, their host, Representative Henry Waxman, had placed a placard that read, ""One American dies every 80 seconds from tobacco use.""

The Stars' third power-play goal of the game came with the Blues' Petr Nedved in the penalty box for holding. Cavallini took a shot that deflected off the Blues' Brendan Shanahan but he got the puck right back and beat Curtis Joseph with 40-foot drive for his first goal of the playoffs. Cavallini, a former Blues player, added a second-period assist and has a goal and five assists in the series.

A Poet and His Sister","Just before Christmas 1799, William Wordsworth and his sister, Dorothy, fulfilled a longtime dream by moving into a small cottage in Grasmere in England's Lake District, where they had lived as children. The landscape proved highly inspirational to Wordsworth, who took most of his poetic cues from nature. Living with his sister, and surrounded by a circle of poets and writers that included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb, Robert Southey and, later, Thomas De Quincey, Wordsworth enjoyed his most creative years. HOME AT GRASMERE: The Wordsworths and the Lakes (Collins & Brown/Trafalgar Square, $29.95) chronicles this period. Penelope Hughes-Hallett, the author of ""Jane Austen: 'My Dear Cassandra,' "" winds the story around excerpts from William Wordsworth's poems, as well as passages from Dorothy Wordsworth's journals and other letters and writings. She demonstrates that Wordsworth frequently borrowed from his sister's lyrical observations of nature and of the rustic characters who roamed the countryside. William, however, consistently underplayed Dorothy's contribution to his work. Ms. Hughes-Hallett's story, lavishly illustrated in watercolors that capture the extraordinary beauty of the Lake District, offers a glimpse into Dorothy's fanatic devotion to her brother, including her heartache over his marriage. The book is most enticing in its presentation of personal turmoil and tragedy: Coleridge's long addiction to alcohol and drugs, the misunderstandings that wrecked the close relationship between Wordsworth and Coleridge, the deaths in 1812 of two of Wordsworth's children, and, finally, Dorothy's madness.

Spender renounced his homosexual life to marry, while the hero of Leavitt's book ""While England Sleeps"" ""ends up uninhibitedly and unapologetically gay."" The novel is therefore as much a political act as a literary work.
