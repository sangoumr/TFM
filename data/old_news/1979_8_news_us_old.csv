us,Film: 'Dallas Forty':Cynicism and Comedy,"FOR Phil Elliott, the aging football hero of ""North Dallas Forty,"" getting out of bed in the morning is a major production: there is apparently no part of Phil's battle-scarred carcass that doesn't creak. He's in such terrible shape that getting him through a football game now requires drugs, tape, padding and possibly the odd dash of papier-mch or Krazy Glue.Phil's situation isn't funny  but ""North Dallas Forty"" is, once the movie finally hits its stride. It's also a lot more bitterly critical of professional sports than its ole-buddy levity might at first indicate. The cynicism and the comedy don't always mix, especially during the film's very messy opening segments. But the director, Ted Kotcheff, has arrived at an unexpectedly delicate balance by the time the film is over. And the leading man, Nick Nolte, has a physical authority and a clowning, irreverent manner that lend the film some semblance of continuity, even when it's about to flounder.Much of the early part of the movie, based on the amusing novel by Peter Gent, is devoted to showing what untamed beasts football players can be. This is a weary point that could have been dispensed with quickly, with just the sight of Joe Bob (Bo Svenson)  the meanest, biggest and stupidest man on the team, not to mention one of the funniest  throwing the host's television set into the pool. But the carousing sequence is long and shapeless, serving only to introduce Mr. Nolte to a love interest (Dayle Haddon) who is amazingly uninteresting. Not until he has completed his pass at this latest hopeless addition to the ranks of fashion-models-turned-actresses can the movie go about its real business.Phil Elliott, it turns out, has evolved into too much of a wise guy to play ball. On the field, he's fine, more or less  it's the team's owners and knuckle-rapping coaches that he's tired of tangling with. The management has accused him of having a childish attitude, and during the course of the film, their dissatisfaction will catch up with him. His suspicion, far more insidious, is that the caste system that governs professional sports has turned the owners and coaches into the real football team, and the players themselves into disposable equipment. The movie is full of brutal, vivid incidents that corroborate his idea.It's also full of easygoing, deceptively casual horseplay, even more essential than the pills or the beer or the bandages in getting these players through the day. A lot of real football players have been cast as the North Dallas Bulls, but there's nothing stilted or amateurish in their acting of locker-room scenes or practice sessions: they perfectly capture the nervous camara-derie of men with a shared knowledge of how easily, how effortlessly they can be replaced. Some of them also reveal unexpected comic abilities, most notably John Matuszak, who makes Mr. Svenson a perfect foil.The central friendship in the movie, beautifully delineated, is the one between Mr. Nolte and Mac Davis, who expertly plays the team's quarterback, a man whose calculating nature and complacency make him all the more likable, somehow. Mr. Davis serves Mr. Nolte as the best friend a feller could have, up to a point  the point at which his own self-interest is called into play, in which case all bets are off. Mr. Nolte, whose job it is to wise up to the ways of the world by the end of the story, makes allowances for these limitations. He cares enough for the quarterback to respect and overlook the fact that the man's values are completely at odds with his own.""North Dallas Forty,"" which opens today at Loews State and other theaters, includes a number of well-honed supporting performances, most notably G.D. Spradlin in the role of the coach. But the uncontested star of the show is Mr. Nolte, who may surprise a lot of people who had the ill fortune to see him in ""The Deep"" and the even worse luck to miss him in ""Who'll Stop the Rain?"" His performance in ""Who'll Stop the Rain?"" was altogether stunning; this time out he's merely engaging and full of surprises. Either way, he's something to see.",1979-08-01T05:00:00+0000

I felt that flipout wings would be one solution for protecting yet showing photography at home. Mr. Weiss found a source that was making just the kind of unit he needed. This is a product that exists, it's not custom made, he emphasized. But it is available in different sizes, with different numbers of panels, and with a variety of colored boards. The hardware is black painted metal. The MultiPanel Display Corporation, 107 Georgia Avenu, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11207 (4953800), makes the compact units, called Displayors. They can be hung on the wall or attached to a stand, as shown above. Photographs can be stapled, tacked or glued to the panels. The panels fold flat against the wall when not in use, and pivot out. The system, as shown, on a stand with six 24by36inch panels is $145. Six panels mounted on a wall unit are $125. Custom frame or board colors are extra.

us,Film: Aspects of History In Thalia Documentaries:Cromwell's Time,"ALTHOUGH one is a documentary, made within the last year or so, and the other is a historical drama set in England in the mid-17th century, ""Vietnam: An American Journey"" and ""Winstanley,"" which will be shown today and tomorrow at the Thalia, establish a certain resonance.The first is mainly devoted to the reconstruction and reunification of a nation. The second tells us virtually all that is known about Gerrard Winstanley, who founded the millennial Christian-Communist sect called the Diggers.Just as angry landlords had the Diggers' commune torn down and burned again and again, Vietnam, both in the north and in parts of the south, was subjected to the most concentrated and prolonged destruction known in the annals of warfare.Both are straightforward, earnest and unadorned narratives, and probably of greater interest for their political and historical content than as conventional entertainment.""Vietnam,"" by Robert Richter, who has made documentaries for CBS-TV, ABC-TV and the Public Broadcasting Service, is described as the first full-length film on the subject by an American since the end of the war. Nonetheless, much of the material has become familiar through the work of others, which may account for the fact, commented on by Mr. Richter, that the three commercial networks and PBS have declined to show it.Mr. Richter's journey in May and June 1978 took him from Hanoi, which suffered so heavily in the bombing attacks of 1972 and has now been largely rebuilt, down Route 1 to Ho Chi Minh City. Along the way he stops at Vinh and Quangtri City, which were all but leveled, and at Mylai, where he speaks to a survivor of the massacre, a woman who is the only survivor of a family of nine.A memorial has been erected on the site of the hamlet, where American troops massacred more than 500 people. It is a place of painful memories for Americans as well as Vietnamese.Most of ""Vietnam"" is devoted to construction sites; hospitals, where the maimed are being treated, the dismal ""cultural activities"" that pass for entertainment in Socialist countries and ""re-education camps"" for prostitutes, narcotics addicts and former adherents of the Saigon Government. Not surprisingly, they say they are grateful for the opportunity to mend their ways.Mr. Richter's hosts did not permit him many detours. One would have been interested in knowing, for example, if the Montagnards in the south were being better treated by their new masters than by their old ones. The expulsion of ethnic Chinese, the fact that tens of thousands of Vietnamese are fleeing their country, the Cambodian invasion and the tension on the Chinese border are scarcely mentioned.""Winstanley,"" which was made in 1975, is the work of Kevin Brownlow, the film historian, and Andrew Mollo. It is based on ""Comrade Jacob,"" a novel by David Caute. The narration is derived from Winstanley's pamphlets, which were written out of the disappointment felt by the rural poor when Cromwell's Government failed to make substantial reforms in the country's social structure. The Digger movement, by the way, had a brief revival in San Francisco and New York as part of the social ferment created by the Vietnam War during the late 60's.The pace of ""Winstanley"" is glacial, the situations tend to be repetitious, the acting, mainly by nonprofessionals, is rudimentary, and the black-and-white cinematography only occasionally luminous. The overall effect is that of a historical pageant.",1979-08-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Concorde...Airport '79':Airplane on Skis,"""THE Concorde ... Airport '79"" is a movie that shows you the Washington Monument, the Eiffel tower, the Alps, Charo, and a big, scary-looking thing with fins. (This is the plane of the title.) That ought to take care of your summer sightseeing  and it's a good thing, too, since ""Concorde"" is enough to persuade anyone to stay on the ground. The plane makes 360-degree flip-flops. Pieces of the floor fall out. Martha Raye hogs the bathroom. Aeronautically and otherwise, it's a bumpy trip.The early portion of ""Concorde,"" which opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters, involves a roundup of hilarious passengers  a little more hilarious than usual this time  in shabby-looking action sequences and an idiotic sabotage scheme, Susan Blakely plays a television newscaster in love with Robert Wagner, who wears enough important-looking gold jewelry to identify him as either Louis XIV or a big-deal business tycoon. He turns out to be the latter, and his gigantic, powerful empire is threatened with scandal. The papers that will prove this have been leaked to Miss Blakely, who clearly needs to be dispatched.Will Mr. Wagner have her murdered in a deserted parking lot, or atop a cliff, or in the privacy of her own home? Of course not. It's much easier to kill her aboard the Concorde, since all this will cost Mr. Wagner's cartel is a guided missile or two. Is this the kind of business savvy that has made this man a zillionaire?Maybe not. But it's the type of bright idea that keeps these ""Airport"" movies taxiing down the runway. This time, the screenplay packs the plane with a Soviet gymnast (Andrea Marcovicci) and the newscaster she loves (John Davidson); a world-weary pilot (Alain Delon) and the stewardess he fools around with (Sylvia Kristel), a mother whose child needs a heart transplant (Cicely Tyson), a heart (or at least a box that says HEART on the outside), the president of the airline (Eddie Albert), a jazz musician who plays his saxophone on board (Jimmie Walker), and a Russian athlete (Avery Schreiber) who makes a lot of noise talking to his deaf daughter.Nobody here is as much fun as Helen Reddy was, playing a singing nun in an earlier ""Airport"" movie. And this time George Kennedy is at the controls, not Charlton Heston  any big-name Hollywood star who wanted to appear in one of these films has long since come and gone. But the second-best casting is unexpectedly entertaining, a lot more so than the airplane-in-distress scenes. Watching this crazy lineup of passengers in conversation is a lot more entertaining than watching their hand luggage whiz through the air.The Concorde makes nearly two trips before the action really comes to life, but even then  when the above-mentioned skiing is done by the aircraft itself  it's a bit perfunctory. Until the snowbound finale, most of the film's interest lies in watching the actors and wondering what they're doing here. Miss Blakeley, Mr. Albert and David Warner (as a co-pilot) are the most agreeable players on hand. At the other end of the cabin, so to speak, are Bibi Andersson, who seems unctuous even for the prostitute she's playing, and Martha Raye, whose bladder problems are a big topic of discussion.""The Concorde ...

us,Film: 'Rock 'n' Roll High School' With the Ramones 'Punk' Band,"""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" at the Eighth Street Playhouse has its charms; the pity is that with a bit more care and flair, it could have been a really sweet little movie. The film centers on the Ramones, an innocently cartoonish New York ""punk"" band. However, it's a real movie, as opposed to a vehicle for a rock act. This is partly by design; it has a plot and actors and everything. But it's also partly by omission. The Ramones are so blank and nebulous on screen that they never emerge as individuals, in the manner of the Beatles in their films.Richard Lester's Beatles movies are one obvious inspiration for ""Rock 'n' Roll High School."" Others are ""Grease"" and ""Animal House,"" and the biggest is the whole string of amusingly trashy teen flicks put out by Roger Corman  who serves as executive producer here.The plot involves a good girl (Dey Young) and a bad girl (P.J. Soles), although both are really good as good can be. The two unite to thwart an evil new headmistress, bring the Ramones to their school and, ultimately, to blow the place to smithereens.Mixed in with all of this are a myriad of gags, production numbers and mild romantic complications, all directed with some buoyance by Allan Arkush.The troubles are that after awhile all this froth weighs one down, and too often easy solutions are settled for when a bit more wit might have lifted things to a truly inspired level. The Ramones specialize in dull-sounding disks, but that approach seems to have been carried over to the recording of the dialogue, which is so lacking in high frequencies as to be often undecipherable. And ultimately, for a movie meant to exalt rock, it would be nice to have rather better rock music than that made by the Ramones and most of the others on the soundtrack here.Still, ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" purports to be little more than summer fun, and, in its zanily unpretentious way, it is certainly that.""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").

us,Film: Peter Brook on Russian Mystic:New Musical Booked at Goodspeed House,"In ""Meetings With Remarkable Men,"" Peter Brook's slow and very deliberate film about the early years of the Russian mystic G.I. Gurdjieff, Mr. Brook has chosen neither to represent Gurdjieff as a fully developed character nor to delve very deeply into the nature of his thought. Instead, he concentrates on the visible details of Gurdjieff's search for enlightenment. So the film depicts a great many places the young Gurdjieff visited, events he witnessed, wise men who advised him and rare parchments he happened upon.But Mr. Brook's presentation of this is so solemn, so evidently lacking the joyful guiding spirit of such a search, that his film feels flat. Watching this handsome, affectless effort feels a little like receiving a series of puzzling picture postcards in the mail, each one beautiful but missing a message on the back. The effect is perhaps more mysterious than it means to be.Though Gurdjieff is played vigorously enough by Dragan Maksimovic (Mikica Dimitrijevic briefly portrays the writer as a boy at the beginning of the film), his is not a performance that can do justice to the material. It can't be: it's surrounded by too much deadly seriousness on all sides. Mr. Brook, with a superb eye for pretty compositions but no interest in continuity at all, simply leaps from one portentous episode to the next, with an abruptness that will either leave viewers bewildered or send them back to Gurdjieff's own writings, depending upon the extent of their interest. Certainly ""Meetings With Remarkable Men"" is a film that requires supplementary energy, whether it comes from the curiosity or the prior knowledge that the right audience may provide.When the writer finally arrives at the remote religious community he has been seeking, ""Meetings With Remarkable Men""  which opens today at Cinema 3  becomes unexpectedly vigorous. This is because in large part of some sacred dances that have been ""brought"" (according to the credits) to the film by Jeanne de Salzmann, the late Gurdjieff's 80-year-old trusted disciple and former aide. These brief sequences are exquisite, filled with the ecstasy and perfect discipline that the rest of the film so sorely lacks.",1979-08-05T05:00:00+0000

I found that people are fascinated with large boards, said Mr. Call, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., and will be a sophomore next month at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Me. Mr. Calle found that backgammon and checkers were two very popular games and proceeded to make some giant versions of the boards and playing pieces. He will make backgammon boards as large as you want, although the smallest he finds acceptable is 6by4 feet. The boards are made of lightweight plasterboard and are painted with waterbase colors. I like bright colors with a semigloss finish, Mr. Call said. Once the paint is dry, he puts on several layers of polyurethane so that the boards are shiny, durable and can be used indoors or out. The backgammon stones are made of threeinchthick foam rubber and each of the two jumbo dice measures a cubic foot. A 6by4 backgammon set is $95, and it takes Mr. Call about a week to complete a custom order. The address of Mr. Call is the Pop Art Stable, 132 Round Hill Road, Greenwich, Conn. 06830.

us,"Screen: 'Americathon' Spoofs National Politics:1998, Not a Good Year","THE premise of ""Americathon"" is strong enough to sustain a 15-minute skit, but the movie has the ill fortune to drag on for an hour and a half. Here's the funny part: America is almost bankrupt in the year 1998, thanks perhaps to the lousy leadership of former President Fred Silverman (whose portrait hangs prominently on a wall) and the current President, a jive turkey from California. This fellow, Chet Roosevelt (John Ritter), makes his Cabinet members wear name tags that say ""Hi, I'm Morty"" or whatever, and conducts business from the Western White House, which is a condominium in Marina Del Ray. He is fond of telling the populace ""I love you"" on state occasions, and sleeps on red satin sheets bearing the Presidential seal.All of this is established amusingly but all too quickly, before ""Americathon,"" which opens today at the Paramount and other theaters, moves on to the soggier business at hand. To keep the country from going broke, the President decides to stage a 30-day telethon with a $400 billion goal. If this isn't the world's greatest idea, at least it's better than anything his First Lady  or his Old Lady, as he likes to call her  has been able to come up with. Her plan was to throw a big dance and charge everybody a $5 admission fee.Once the telethon  hosted by Harvey Korman, who plays the transvestite star of some very successful sitcom  gets under way, the movie stops in its tracks. There's nothing to satirize here; the real thing is ridiculous enough. When the director (Neil Israel, who also made ""Tunnelvision"") brings on the ventroquists and the tap-dancing moppets and the roller-skaters, he achieves a feeling of clutter and little more. The show also features a very unfunny Vietnamese rock band and fleeting guest appearances by Elvis Costello and Meat Loaf, neither of whom does anything that might make the rest of the movie worth sitting through for his fans.""Americathon"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains a few lewd gestures and innuendoes.",1979-08-10T05:00:00+0000

It would be interesting to know what sort of evaluation of the local food scene was made by the owners of this costly newcomer before they decided on the culinary level they consider adequate. Located just below a shop (also called Mitsukoshi) selling fine Japanese porcelain and art objects, the entrance stairway, cocktail lounge and sushi bar of the restaurant are beautifully laid out with blond wood, mirrors and plants. The setting is spacious, quiet and conducive to conversation as one has a beforedinner drink or some of the vinegar rice, seaweed and fish sushi or the raw fish sashimi that are Mitsukoshi's best offerings.

us,Film: DeLuise Directs Himself in 'Hot Stuff':'Butterfly' in Huntington,"""HOT STUFF"" is the kind of immensely cheerful comedy that runs as much on good will and a genial attitude as on its own energy. The movie, which has its basis in fact, is about a team of Miami burglary cops who open their own fencing operation to catch (and record on tape) petty thieves in the act of disposing of their goods. It stars Dom DeLuise, the portly, often hyper-tense actor who's been making me laugh ever since he got his foot stuck in a flower pot 13 years ago in ""The Glass Bottom Boat,"" and it marks Mr. DeLuise's debut as a director, which may or may not be a good thing.From the evidence on the screen here, Mr. DeLuise can direct a screenplay as casually constructed as the one for ""Hot Stuff"" as well as probably a dozen other people, but being able to do something as well as a dozen other people really isn't good enough. Rather, it's a convenience.Behind these comments, I must admit, there's the suspicion that Mr. DeLuise's performance might have been more loosely, more manically funny if, while acting, he hadn't been carrying around the worries of the entire production. Perhaps not. In addition to having surrounded himself with a lot of fine character actors, he also had with him on this production his real-life wife and two sons who, naturally enough, play his wife and two sons on the screen. It wasn't a production hampered by homesickness.""Hot Stuff,"" which opens today at Loew's Tower East and other theaters, was written by Michael Kane and Donald E. Westlake and has the form of an extended television sketch that can never be any better or more than its individual parts. More important than anything else, though  and don't underrate the surprising effect of this  ""Hot Stuff"" is a movie about essentially nice people. Its petty thieves are endearing, its Mafia godfather and his soldiers powerless in the face of such innocence and its serious hoodlums always inept. No one, good or bad, ever gets seriously injured in the mayhem.Mr. DeLuise's cop-cohorts in the fencing business are played by the beautiful Suzanne Pleshette, Jerry Reed (the country-music star who was so good in ""W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings""), and Luis Avalos, who is the Spanish-speaking member of the outfit.The four policemen have private lives of a sort, but the movie is almost entirely concerned with their adventures with the characters who pop in and out of their pawnshop, like the characters in Fred Allen's ""Allen's Alley."" Because Mr. DeLuise has cast his movie so well, ""Hot Stuff"" manages the feat of being continuously amusing while not going anywhere.Some of the peripheral characters who make the movie as much fun as it is are the real owner of the pawnshop, a fellow named Hymie (""I'm a legitimate businessman!""), played by Sydney Lassick; the Miami godfather, played by Marc Lawrence, who is all style and no substance; a fellow (Pat McCormick) who unloads a case of Cuban cigars that are more than they seem to be; and an elegantly phony English couple who deal in marajuana. Playing it straight throughout the movie is Ossie Davis, who never quite loses his dignity as the senior officer responsible for the bizarre police stakeout.""Hot Stuff"" may not be the funniest movie of the year but it is the most sweetly tempered.""Hot Stuff,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains some vulgar language.",1979-08-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Double Debut From Britain at Thalia:Contrasting Roles,"SEVERAL years after their production, screen versions of two plays, ""The National Health"" and ""No Sex Please  We're British,"" are having two-day premiere engagements in this country, today and tomorrow at the Thalia.""No Sex Please"" is one of those knockabout farces that flourishes in the West End but usually dies quickly, as this one did, when transplanted to Broadway. ""The National Health,"" which had its premiere in London in 1969, had successful runs at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven and then at the Circle in the Square in 1974, and has since been revived elsewhere in this country.It is hard to imagine that any of these productions could have been superior to this film rendition, made in 1975, of the Peter Nichols play about life, and death, in a men's ward of a shabby London hospital, interrupted by burlesque soap-opera episodes of romance among physicians and nurses at a far grander institution.In fact, the impact of seeing the same performers at one moment pale, over-worked but concerned with their scruffy patients, and the next involved in an absurd six-sided romance that culminates in an interracial kidney transplant, is, if anything, intensified by the quick cuts possible only in film.Lynn Redgrave, Eleanor Bron, Jim Dale and Donald Sinden, Sheila Scott-Wilkinson and Neville Aurelius, play the dual roles expertly. Colin Blakely is moving without seeking our sympathy as the ward's Everyman, an baffled, stubborn, unreformable working-class alcoholic.Under Jack Gold's thoughtful direction, every part, even the bits, is firmly delineated. Mr. Nichols, properly confident of the dramatic validity of his characters and situations, has only occasionally felt it necessary to open up the action to the world outside the ward. In this concentration of unforced emotion, the rattle of the wheels of the stretchers on which the bodies of the men who die, one by one, are rolled across the yard to the hospital mortuary sounds like the drums of judgment.One often listens skeptically to tales of the existence of splendid films that for one reason or another are kept from public view. It turns out that ""The National Health"" has, until now, been one of these. It will be odd indeed if it is not now given a chance to reach a wider audience.Its companion feature, ""No Sex Please,"" which dates from 1973, deals with the complications that ensue when a box of pornographic photographs is sent by mistake to the home of a newly married Junior bank executive in Windsor, one of the stuffiest of English towns. In its own way it is well done, and its simpleminded and by now rather outdated double and triple entendres provide a coarsely amiable contrast to the deeply felt emotions of ""The National Health.""",1979-08-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Film:Acapulco 'Sunburn':Romance and Comedy,"THERE'S no reason why the attributes that made Farrah Fawcett such a big star on television shouldn't eventually work just as well for her in feature films. Miss Fawcett (who has officially dropped the ""-Majors"" lately) seems adorable without guile, and she also manages to convey the impression that she's very, very nice. Her popularity on posters and in hair-care ads attests to the fact that she's fun to look at, too. Whether this describes the full extent of her talent is hard to say, at least on the evidence of either her first film, ""Somebody Killed Her Husband,"" or now ""Sunburn,"" the better of the two. Each of these movies takes a counterproductive tack, starting out as a vehicle for the leading lady and then losing her in a web of trumped-up intrigue.""Sunburn,"" which opens today at the Gemini I and other theaters, concludes with a shot of Miss Fawcett and Charles Grodin uncorking a bottle of champagne. And indeed, this is a movie that, for all its unnecessary twists, aspires to nothing more than being bubbly. Mr. Grodin, as a private detective with perhaps the world's biggest expense account, is supposed to be investigating an insurance fraud in Acapulco, a job that requires him to rent an elaborate villa and a Rolls-Royce. Miss Fawcett is a model hired to pose as his wife. Her job involves changing her clothes a lot and calling him""Honey.""Together, they embark on one of those romantic-comedy-adventure-mystery stories that fall into no particular genre save that of the breezy mishmash. The romantic angle seems almost extraneous, since the camera is so evidently in love with Miss Fawcett that Mr. Grodin doesn't need to be; in any case, her overriding sweetness turns every would-be clinch into a sisterly hug. As for comedy, Mr. Grodin's deadpan manner supplies a fair amount of that until the adventure-mystery aspects become overpowering. The insurance fraud goes slack so early that the movie winds up with too much plot. It all culminates in a car chase that wrecks half a village before it screeches into the middle of an ongoing bullfight  all this while the soundtrack plays the film's pretty, very mellow, very un-car-chase-like theme song. Oh, well. Ole!Art Carney is on hand to give the beginnings of a good performance, as a south-of-the-border gumshoe whose help Mr. Grodin enlists, though neither of them seems altogether qualified for this line of work. Soon enough, Mr. Carney is off disco-dancing with Miss Fawcett, and from then on his role loses its edge. Of the other supporting performances, Joan Collins' stands out most, and not for the best reasons. Miss Collins' aggressive-nymphomaniac routine is supposed to be funny this time. It's not.""Sunburn"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains a shootout finale and one episode of bedroom farce.",1979-08-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Neil Young's Rock:Rocking Along,"ROCK films come in two categories. More common is the film designed solely for an act's fans. But some appeal beyond the cult to the general public, as in Richard Lester's two Beatles movies. Neil Young's ""Rust Never Sleeps,"" which opens a limited run at the Palladium today, might seem to be in the latter category. In fact, it's very much a fan film.Its credentials as a message beyond the cult rest largely on its extra-musical conceits. Instead of being a straight concert documentary, ""Rust Never Sleeps"" calls itself a ""concert fantasy."" As he was during last fall's tour at which this was filmed, Mr. Young is discovered ""asleep"" on top of one of the loudspeaker banks, which has been disguised as an oversized pirate chest, and ""wakes up"" to begin the concert.The ""roadies"" who move equipment about have been dressed as ""roadeyes,"" the little scavengers with brown robes and beady pinpoint eyes from ""Star Wars."" The idea, reinforced by playing tapes of crowd-control announcements from the Woodstock Festival, is to comment on rock's aging, on the discrepancies between veteran rock performers and their teenage audiences, and on rock's allegiance to youthful rebellion and innocence. All of this reads better than it appears on the screen, however, where an otherwise fine concert is continually interrupted by laboriously miming ""roadeyes"" and other cuteness.Mr. Young, who directs the film under the rather coy pseudonym of Bernard Shakey, further limits its appeal by extremely grainy and underlit footage. And the Palladium, as rock's principal rock concert hall in New York, is likely to attract more rock fans than film buffs. Perhaps that's what he meant to do, in a film that reaffirms the purity and unity of rock. But it's too bad, because Mr. Young has the talent to appeal to intelligent people outside his world.For Mr. Young is, in the opinion of some of us, the leading creative figure in present-day rock-and-roll, and this film has stirring, even triumphant passages. He writes songs of unsurpassed metaphoric richness with deceptively simple, melodic tunes. He sings with haunting evocativeness and plays guitar with more personality and stark individuality than almost anyone else.""Rust Never Sleeps"" offers some of his strongest songs, both new and old, in performances as fine or finer than those on his recent, partly live record album of the same title. The effect here is rougher than the record, less polished with overdubbing; at one point, Mr. Young even mangles the words of one of his own best songs. But the intensity of the singing and the playing of Crazy Horse, Mr. Young's longtime partners for electric-rock projects, is as moving as rock can offer. It's so good, in fact, that it almost lets one overlook Mr. Young's theatrical conceits, and almost makes the film recommendable for the general public, after all.""Rust Never Sleeps"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). There's a passing indelicate word, but otherwise, unless a parent is implacably opposed to rock-and-roll, there seems little reason to prevent children from seeing this film.",1979-08-15T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Apocalypse Now':Faces of War,"SCENE: Day. Jungle. A small United States Army patrol boat pushes its way up a river overhung with dense foliage. The members of the crew make no comment on the burnt-out ribs of an American helicopter that remain stuck in a tree like the struts of a child's forgotten kite.Scene: Day. Jungle. The little patrol boat cuts through the water with uncharacteristic speed, drawing behind it an exultant crew member on water skis. The brown-skinned farmers on the river bank watch impassively.Scene: Day. Jungle. The patrol boat stops to search a Vietnamese dugout filled with people and produce. Are they friends, enemies or, as is most likely, simply uncommitted? No way to know. No language to communicate in. A young Vietnamese woman makes a sudden move to protect a particular crate. An American, armed with a machine gun, begins to fire. In several seconds these boat people are dead. The one survivor is a puppy.Scene: Night. Jungle. The patrol boat, now deep in hostile territory, rounds a bend in the river to come upon a brilliantly floodlit stadium preparing to receive a U.S.O. troupe of Playboy bunnies.In dozens of such scenes Francis Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" lives up to its grand title, disclosing not only the various faces of war but also the contradictions between excitement and boredom, terror and pity, brutality and beauty. Its epiphanies would do credit to Federico Fellini, who is indirectly quoted at one point.""Apocalypse Now,"" which opens at long last today at the Ziegfeld Theater, is not about any war but about the disastrous United States involvment in Vietnam, which, probably because it was disastrous, seems now to have been different, but was it really? The technology was as up-to-date as the taxpayers' billions could buy, but everything else was essentially the same. At its confused heart: a fearful hunger to survive. No matter what.When it is thus evoking the look and feelings of the Vietnam War, dealing in sense impressions for which no explanations are adequate or necessary, ""Apocalypse Now"" is a stunning work. It's as technically complex and masterful as any war film I can remember, including David Lean's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" which comes to mind, I suppose, because both productions were themselves military campaigns to subdue the hostile landscapes in which they were made. ""Kwai"" was shot in Ceylon; ""Apocalypse Now"" in the Philippines, which became, for Mr. Coppola, his Vietnam, swallowing men, money and equipment as voraciously as any enemy.""Apocalypse Now,"" though, wants to be something more than a kind of cinematic tone poem. Mr. Coppola himself describes it as ""operatic,"" but this, I suspect, is a word the director hit upon after the fact. Ultimately, ""Apocalypse Now"" is neither a tone poem nor an opera. It's a adventure yarn with delusions of grandeur, a movie that endsin the all-too-familiar words of the poet Mr. Coppola drags in by the bootstrapsnot with a bang, but a whimper.I realize that a movie's ending should not deny all that has gone before, but almost from the beginning of ""Apocalypse Now"" there have been portents that the film means to deal not only with the looks and expressions of war but also with such heavy things as the human condition, good, evil, fate and various other subjects whose weight, in an earlier century, demanded that they be capitalized.Mr. Coppola and John Milius, with whom he wrote the screenplay, have taken as their source material ""Heart of Darkness,"" Joseph Conrad's classic story about a mad ivory hunter in 19th-century Africa. This shadowy man, named Kurtz, comes to represent to Conrad's narrator, Marlow, all the terrible possibilities of a soul returned to some precivilized state. Conrad is rather vague about the terrible things that Kurtz is up to. We know only that he rules his local tribes with a bloody hand and charms them with his sorcery. The point of the story is Marlow's realization that Kurtz is a heretofore unrecognized aspect of himself, which, being known, is safely manageable.Mr. Coppola and Mr. Milius have attempted to update Conrad, who really doesn't need updating, by placing this story more or less on top of the Vietnam War. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), whom we meet in the film's concluding section, is a renegade Green Berets officer who has taken refuge in the Cambodian jungles, where, to the fury of his superiors, he wages his own wars  for and against whom is left blurry  at the head of a group of ferocious Montagnard tribesmen.The Marlow character is now a battle-scarred Special Services officer named Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), who is assigned by the commanding general to go into Cambodia, find Kurtz and to ""terminate"" him ""with extreme prejudice."" This plot, which seems to have been imposed on the film from above, keeps interrupting the natural flow of Mr. Coppola's perfectly sound, sometimes incredibly beautiful, meditation upon war.The major part of the film is occupied with Willard's adventures as he travels upriver in the small patrol boat provided by the Army. These sequences are often spellbinding, none more so than one in which Willard and his companions are forced to observe an assault on a Vietcong village by American fighter planes and helicopters under the command of an exuberantly manic officer who's also a surfing nut. This fellow, played with breathtaking force and charm by Robert Duvall, exhibits most of the qualities we miss in the foolish pretensions of the movie's Kurtz, whose actions and words, when they finally come, have little to do with the rest of the movie.From time to time in the course of his upriver odyssey, Captain Willard muses on the nature of the man he seeks  soundtrack narration that makes one's flesh wet with embarrassment. When we hear Willard say, ""Everything I saw told me that Kurtz had gone insane,"" it not only fails to establish any bond between the two men, it's also an understatement to break a camel's back.With the exception of Mr. Brando, who has no role to act, the actors are superlatively right, beginning with Mr. Duvall and Mr. Sheen, and including Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, Larry Fishburne and Sam Bottoms, who play the members of the patrol boat's crew. Dennis Hopper, looking as wild and disconnected as ever, turns up briefly at the end as a freelance photographer who has fallen under Kurtz's spell, apparently because Kurtz reads T.S. Eliot aloud (though none too well).Vittorio Storaro, who photographed ""Last Tango in Paris,"" among other fine films, is responsible for the extraordinary camerawork that almost, but not quite, saves ""Apocalypse Now"" from its profoundly anticlimactic intellectual muddle.",1979-08-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Dutch Offer 'Soldier of Orange':Dash and Dinner Clothes,"""SOLDIER of Orange"" is the story of a Dutch war hero who performed most of his derring-do in dinner clothes. That gives the movie a certain unmistakable dash  and so does the fact that the man upon whose memoirs it is based, Erik Hazelhoff, helped supervise the filming. The ""official patron"" of the project, according to the production notes, was Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, who happens to be Mr. Hazelhoff's friend.For these reasons  and because Mr. Hazelhoff is virtually the only one of the principals who lived to tell the tale  the movie might be expected to be a bit overprotective of his interests. Oddly enough, that doesn't do it any harm. The determination of the film makers to build a better ""Late Show"" out of Mr. Hazelhoff's already-colorful exploits simply leads them in the direction of swashbuckling, which is perfectly at home in a war movie anyhow. This time the hero just has a little more trouble than usual dividing his energies between the tennis court and the battlefield.""Soldier of Orange,"" which opens at the Beekman today, begins very strangely. A group of freshmen are being subjected to some sort of university initiation rite, and not-so-young-looking Erik (Rutger Hauer) is being singled out for sadistic treatment by an upperclassman named Guus (Jeroen Krabbe). Guus pours noodle soup all over Erik's newly shaven head, and for a moment it looks as if this incident is going to serve as some preamble to the hardships of war. Instead, the scene is supposed to pave the way for a lifelong friendship between the two men.Here, as in his previous film ""Keetje Tippel,"" the director, Paul Verhoeven, shows such a penchant for having his characters wallow in muck that the squalor can become actively confusing. Later on in ""Soldier of Orange,"" when Mr. Verhoeven wants to show that a very available young Englishwoman has a kinky side to her nature, he uses a close-up of her crushing flies with a pencil. Most of the movie is more delicate than that.It turns out that the freshmen all grow up to be friends, until World War II shuts down the university and puts a cramp in their gentlemanly style. Under pressure, they go their different ways with melodramatic flair, as one becomes martyred, one turns traitor and one becomes a hero even more remarkable than Erik himself. Throughout the war years, they meet only intermittently but share some of the same women, who lend the film a bit of romantic spice to match its elements of intrigue. There's a tragic flavor to it, too, particularly whenever anyone offers to sleep with anyone else ""while I still can.""""Soldier of Orange"" may not be great art but it's a good yarn. And the combined effects of Mr. Verhoeven's comfortingly old-fashioned storytelling and Mr. Hauer's unexpectedly brittle performance keep it moving at a fast clip. Though the screenplay provides him with every opportunity to turn matinee idol, Mr. Hauer shows little interest in making himself adorable, and that in itself is intriguing. His Erik is a vain, arrogant and shrewd aristocrat, capable of bravery when it's called for but by no means overeager to risk his neck. He's a much more temperamental and complex fellow than the dependable Guus, who is carefully turned by Mr. Krabbe into the one fixed element in an atmosphere of terrifying up-heaval.Erik's principal feat in the movie is his escape to England, where he meets the exiled Queen Wilhelmina and agrees to return to the Netherlands to do her bidding. The film's two main English characters, an officer (Edward Fox) and his trampy, ridiculous assistant (Susan Penhaligon), are so weirdly caricatured that they may make a great comic impression on American viewers.",1979-08-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Comic 'Rich Kids':Unpushy 12-Year-Olds,"THE problem with most films about adolescents with problems is that the children are less real as children than as projections of adult fantasies, especially of adult guilt trips. This was one of the things that made George Roy Hill's ""A Little Romance"" so cloying and even self-serving.Robert M. Young, in his beautifully acted, sometimes very funny new comedy, ""Rich Kids,"" written by Judith Ross, comes close to solving the problem. His secret: children who only occasionally talk above their station and worried, frenetically sophisticated, upper-middle-class adults who are so immediately recognizable that they lend credence to the kind of 12-year-old who'd say solemnly of children, ""We have no human rights.""""Rich Kids,"" which opens today at the Coronet, marks a big step forward for Mr. Young, who only recently branched out from the direction of documentary films to make fiction features, his first being the excellent screen adaptation of Miguel Piero's ""Short Eyes."" ""Rich Kids"" is something else entirely, a witty exploitation of material that makes me think of a certain kind of affluent New York society as Paul Mazurskyland.Though the film's focus is on two nice, unpushy 12-year-olds  Franny Philips (Trini Alvarado) and Jamie Harris (Jeremy Levy), each a product of parents either split or splitting, ""Rich Kids"" is equally concerned with, and knowledgeable about, their achingly well-meaning, hilariously self-deluding parents and their parents' various lovers and friends.Like Mr. Mazursky's best films, ""Rich Kids"" is a New York movie, born and bred. It knows what Manhattan looks and sounds like. It appreciates the awful panics of people who've become so terribly understanding of changing manners and morals that it's a shock when they realize they don't understand a thing and that, really, they're miserable.That's the seriously comic point of Miss Ross's good, unsentimental screenplay about the mess being made of their lives by Paul and Madeleine Philips (John Lithgow and Kathryn Walker). At the opening of the film, Paul and Madeleine are living under a flag of truce. They are separated, but to hide the fact from their daughter, Franny, they continue to live together in their handsome, West Side town house.At the crack of dawn each day, Paul creeps home from his mistress's apartment, climbs into bed with the unwanted Madeleinealways somewhat irritated by her cookie crumbs and the rumpled sheets  to be on hand when Franny awakes. Franny, of course, is quite aware of what's going on and keeps a time-sheet of her father's early-morning arrivals.""Rich Kids"" is about Franny's innocent affair with Jamie, whose parents are even more thoughtless and possibly funnier. His mother (Roberta Maxwell) is remarried to an incredibly smug but exceedingly happy psychiatrist (Paul Dooley). His father (Terry Kiser), a producer of television commercials, is an aging hipster who drives a Maserati, dates flight attendants and lives in an apartment furnished with jungle trees, cockatoos, piranhas, a jukebox, slot machines, neon lights, fun-house mirrors and a waterbed.""Rich Kids"" observes its characters with sensitivity as well as humor. Mr. Lithgow and Miss Walker are sweetly perfect as the mismatched parents who come to have some small idea of the foolishness of their existence. Equally good are Mr. Kiser, Miss Maxwell and Mr. Dooley. There's not an off-key performance in the entire film, which is prodigal in its use of New York talent; in addition to those named, that includes David Selby as Franny's mother's lover, Jill Eikenberry, Olympia Dukakis and the beautiful Irene Worth, in her first American film role, as Franny's liberated grandmother.The two youngsters, Trini Alvarado and Jeremy Levy, are as charming as the script and other conventions allow.""Rich Kids,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly suggestive situations and a few vulgar words.",1979-08-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Orchestra Rehearsal' by Fellini:Raucous Ensemble,"AS is the way of the world, Federico Fellini's comparatively short, gloriously funny new film, ""Orchestra Rehearsal,"" being both profoundly and simply common-sensible, will probably be subjected to as many interpretations in this country as it already has been in Italy.The film, written as well as directed by Fellini, and acted with pricelessly comic conviction by one of his well-known casts of (with one exception) amateurs, is a divertissement commissioned by Italian television. Though it is about nothing more or less than an orchestra rehearsal, the film at one point threatened to become so controversial that it couldn't be televised, which would have been an extension of the sort of small-minded madness that the movie pokes fun at.When the film opens, we see a handsome, empty, 13th-century oratory, the burial place of three popes and seven bishops, but best known for its perfect acoustics. Our guide is an old but still lively copyist, who gives us a bit of the history of the room as he sets up the music stands and then explains what's about to happen, that is, that this particular rehearsal is to be covered by a television crew. Singly and in small groups, the members of the orchestra arrive, followed by two formidable union representatives and the members of the television crew.There is both bickering and good fellowship. One violinist fusses with a barometer. Another fellow objects to being interviewed by television without getting paid. Most of the orchestra members, though, are hams. They can't resist talking, and once started, they won't shut up. Each has a particular relation to his own instrument and is inclined to look down his nose at all the others.When someone claims the first violin to be the heart and the brains of the orchestra, a clarinetist suggests that the clarinet is its penis. The trombonist finds the trombone comic, and the pianist talks grandly of her piano as a king. ""It doesn't come to you,"" she says with passion. ""You have to go to it.""The instruments are analyzed, described, adored and ridiculed with increasing testiness, until the conductor (Baldwin Bass), an aloof, aristocratic German, comes in to assert his control. Things go badly. As the false starts accumulate, the members of the orchestra become increasingly angry. Their anger is soon matched by the conductor's when he is told by a union man that the saxophonist is staying away ""in protest,"" though he's never told in protest against what.In the course of a union-demanded break, the conductor, in his dressing room, talks eloquently but coldly of his function as a conductor. He recalls his relations with conductors when he was a musician and sees himself as ""drawing music out of silence"" with his baton. ""My job,"" he says, ""is to turn wine into blood, bread into flesh."" He's not a bad fellow, but his interests are far removed from the needs and fears of the people he works with.""Orchestra Rehearsal"" follows the ups and downs of this particular rehearsal with such close, deadpan scrutiny that we are deep inside Fellini's wickedly comic imagination before we are even aware of the change in atmosphere. The orchestra members rebel against the conductor's authority. They overthrow him and replace him with a giant metronome whose reign lasts only a few minutes before it is physically destroyed. The musicians fight among themselves, chant slogans that recall the student riots of 1968 (""Musicians at last/Freed from the past!"") and threaten the life of the conductor himself until suddenly. . . well, I can't give away the entire plot, if that's what you want to call it.""Orchestra Rehearsal"" is, I suppose, a moral lesson of sorts about the cyclical nature of all things. The danger is to see it as a small lesson, one having to do with right-wing and left-wing politics, with unions, capitalism and Communism. Like any film worth thinking about more than 60 seconds, it can be interpreted in a number of ways, but it is so complete, so clear, so wise, so humane and so witty, as just what it is, that to interpret it clumsily is to be in danger of dismantling it forever.I leave that job to those who respect Fellini less than I do. ""Orchestra Rehearsal"" is of a piece with this brilliant director's very best work.Historical note: The music, which recalls a number of Fellini films, is the last work of Nino Rota, who wrote the scores for every Fellini film from ""The White Sheik"" on. Mr. Rota died of a blood clot last April 10. He will be missed by the master.",1979-08-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'More American Graffiti' Covers '64 to '67:Where Did They All Go?,"""MORE American Graffiti"" is grotesquely misconceived, so much so that it nearly eradicates fond memories of the original. That film ended in 1962, with its characters poised on the edge of a precipice; this one finds them deep in the abyss. The times  the story is scattered like buckshot from 1964 to 1967  have grown dangerous, but these people haven't awakened at all. They're still the same fun-loving rock-and-rollers, and there's nothing they can't trivialize. So here is a comic look at campus rioting. Here are the beach party aspects of the Vietnam War.""More American Graffiti,"" which opens at the National and other theaters today, couldn't be opening at a less advantageous time, arriving as it does on the heels of ""Apocalypse Now."" Whatever reservations one may have about that film, the best of its combat footage is phantasmagorically beautiful and presented with haunting sobriety. ""More American Graffiti,"" with its burning-jungle footage drowned out by the Supremes' ""Stop! In the Name of Love,"" is revoltingly flippant by comparison.When Terry the Toad (Charles Martin Smith), one member of the gang who winds up in Vietnam, goofs up an attempts to give himself a flesh wound and get sent home  ""ter-rific,"" he complains, about the rifle that misfires  he is mistaken for a sniper and shot at. He isn't hurt, but his buddies are embarrassed, because a visiting Senator or Congressman has witnessed the scene and expects a body count. ""Oh, heck,"" Terry fudges, ""I don't know  you'd have to count up all the arms and legs and stuff  I'd say two dozen."" Funny as a corpse, you might say.Things aren't any better on the home front. Hamstrung by the ending of ""American Graffiti,"" which listed the fates of all the principals, the new film becomes one long juggling act. The writer and director, B. W. L. Norton, had a tiny bit of leeway because the original film neglected to mention what happened to most of the women, except for Laurie (Cindy Williams), who of course married Steve (Ron Howard). So Mr. Norton has planted Debbie (Candy Clark) in San Francisco in 1966 as a flower child, and given her Carol (Mackenzie Phillips)  now called Rainbow  for company. Carol, the baby of the first film, seems much older than anyone else in the second.We know John Milner (Paul Le Mat) was killed by a drunken driver in 1964, so the movie has to roll back in time to visit him. And Terry disappeared in Vietnam a year later, so the movie pitches forward again. The Steve-and-Laurie sequence, involving twin sons and a marital spat, culminates among the billy clubs, after Laurie's left-wing brother (now Will Seltzer, formerly Richard Dreyfuss) burns his draft card at a rally; this tale is set in 1967 for balance. The only things that link these separate episodes are the fact that each takes place on New Year's Eve, and the now-hackneyed use of an incessant rock score.The remarkable production notes for ""More American Graffiti"" explain that each section of the story was shot in the prevailing cinematic style of that period, with Debbie's story full of split-screen psychedelica, Terry's looking like 16-millimeter war footage, John's in a wide-screen Hollywood style and Steve and Laurie's shot like a commercial. The scheme is interesting, but it fits in all too well with the frighteningly scientific method by which Mr. Norton, George Lucas, the executive producer, and Howard Kazanjian, the producer, concocted the screenplay. It seems they divided the proposed running time by four, and then broke down each character's segment into two-minute installments, so that each scene could be accompanied by its own song. They arranged these things on index cards and did the appropriate shuffling. Precisely calculated monotony can be a lot more grueling than the haphazard kind.It's nice to see the original cast reassembled, even if they're only treading water. Mr. Le Mat, who has been given a beautiful Icelander (Anna Bjorn) to romance, has less to do than the others, but with the absence of Mr. Dreyfuss, he becomes the one character of any weight in the story. Miss Williams makes an effective transition from angry sweetheart to angry homemaker, perhaps because so much of the present character is preordained by her earlier performance. Harrison Ford makes a very brief (and uncredited) appearance as a policeman giving a ticket to the perennially flaky Miss Clark, who seems to be right in her element in the drug culture of the mid-60's. Wolfman Jack, heard bellowing on the soundtrack for old times' sake, has long since worn out his welcome.""More American Graffiti"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains some war footage and occasional coarse language.",1979-08-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Alan Alda Writes and Stars in 'Joe Tynan':Coping With Fame,"ALAN ALDA'S Joe Tynan isn't altogether believable as a politician, but he's a warm, sensitive, intelligent character, around whom an uncommonly well-meaning movie has been fashioned. Mr. Alda's screenplay for ""The Seduction of Joe Tynan,"" which opens at the Gemini 2 and other theaters today, is ambitious enough to touch on even more aspects of this man's life than it can comfortably handle  especially because Tynan's main problem is how to keep his wife, children, mistress and dizzying career from running away from him. The film, like Senator Tynan, is in danger of being spread too thin.But Mr. Alda offers someone who genuinely cares about his diverse interests, even when they conflict, and who has a natural talent for making sound choices. The title is a bit misleading, and so is any notion that the film is about politics. For one thing, Mr. Alda's Tynan, while certainly human enough to have his head turned by sufficient flattery, isn't passive enough to be seduced. For another, he isn't chilly enough to pay single-minded attention to political life. Mr. Alda plays Tynan's professional smoothness to the hilt, but he never gives the man enough ruthlessness to match his alleged charisma, or enough charisma to explain his status as a budding national hero.A crucial scene at the end of the movie shows Tynan, about to make a nominating speech at the Democratic National Convention, more eager to have a heart-to-heart talk with his wife than to make the speech. Indeed, as he steps out before an auditorium full of cheering delegates, the thing that gives him the greatest satisfaction is his wife's smile. Implausible as this may be in the arena of national politics, it seems applicable enough to a more generalized kind of fame, which is perhaps what Mr. Alda meant to consider in the first place. In any case, Tynan's colleagues in the Senate are so well played that the film's wheeler-dealer scenes work nicely enough on the level of simple character study. And his complicated home life could just as well be that of any man who is suddenly more celebrated than he ever expected to be.Barbara Harris plays Tynan's bright, pretty, admirably self-sufficient wife, with whom he is very evidently in love. Meryl Streep, more stunning with each new appearance on the screen, has an equally tangible hold on him as a cool, clever, irresistible labor lawyer with whom he is thrown into professional contact. It can't remain strictly business for long. But Miss Streep's remarkable accomplishment is to keep both Tynan and the audience perpetually off balance, to turn a predictable affair into a source of constant surprise.The director, Jerry Schatzberg, achieves the most subtly impressive scene in the film when, as Miss Streep realizes during a private conference in the Senator's office that their flirtation is about to become something more, he simply trains the camera in closely on her astonishingly versatile face.""The Seduction of Joe Tynan"" bends over backwards too far to make sense of this romance. Miss Streep, who is supposed to be married, is given an unnecessary scene with a husband who's always traveling and altogether neglectful of her; however, she has already made her character too alluring for this to make sense. Similarly, Mr. Alda is able to decide, with unconvincing ease, how to solve the problem of having two marvelous women in his life.Midway through the movie, once the conflicting forces at work on Joe Tynan have been explained, the whole thing switches into too high a gear, rushing through solutions that are simpler than the problems at hand. In a quick and mystifying montage, Tynan is seen gearing up for a possible Presidential campaign; then, just as abruptly, he's back home in Westchester County, trying to cheer up his troubled teen-age daughter. The optimism of Mr. Alda's screenplay is surely admirable, but by this stage of the story something more complex is called for. Joe Tynan, after digging himself into what ought to be a gigantic hole, suddenly sprouts wings and flies away.The principal thing that keeps ""The Seduction of Joe Tynan"" engrossing is the level of acting it sustains throughout. Rip Torn brings a new dimension to political sleaziness in the role of a skirt-chasing (and catching) Southern Senator, and Melvyn Douglas is suitably alarming as an elder statesman on the verge of senility. Miss Harris is particularly graceful in avoiding the stereotype of the politician's wife. Just as Miss Streep does, she shows the audience something new.",1979-08-17T05:00:00+0000

Until they produce their gifts, Mandy will have none of the Three Wise Men, whom she takes for fortunetellers. Mandy grabs the gold and the frankincense but is suspicious of the myrrh. ""What is myrrh?"" she asks with a sniff. ""It sounds like some kind of animal to me. Something with horns . . .""Thus begins ""Monty Python's Life of Brian,"" which should restore our confidence in the belief that not all of the earth's unnatural resources have been depleted. Just when you thought that the uproarious English comedy troupe had taken bad taste as far as it could go in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" along comes ""Monty Python's Life of Brian"" to demonstrate that it's possible to go even farther in delirious offensiveness. Bad taste of this order is rare but not yet dead.""Monty Python's Life of Brian,"" which opens today at the Cinema 1, succeeds in sending up not only movies like ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" and ""King of Kings,"" but also a lot of the false piety attached to the source material. It is the foulest-spoken bibical epic ever made, as well as the best-humored  a nonstop orgy of assaults, not on anyone's virtue, but on the funny bone. It makes no difference that some of the routines fall flat because there are always others coming along immediately after that succeed. The film is like a Hovercraft fueled by comic energy. When it comes to a dry patch, it flies blithely over with no reduction in speed.""Life of Brian"" is the not-so-reverent account of the life, times and apotheosis of one Brian of Nazareth (Graham Chapman), a none-too-bright, would-be Judean freedom fighter who deeply annoys Pontius Pilate and whom people keep trying to turn into a messiah. According to the Monty Python gospel, the principal business in the Holy Land is the organization of inept liberation movements, while the people are made dozy by dozens of aspiring messiahs, including one fellow who warns of the coming of the awful day when ""things will go astray . . . a father's hammer, various household items . . .""The movie was directed by Terry Jones (co-director of ""The Holy Grail"") and written by Mr. Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Mr. Jones and Michael Palin, all of whom turn up in the film in dozens of major and minor roles, not all of which can be distinguished by anyone except the mother of the individual actor.Some people who wander into this film will stalk out in as high a dudgeon as is possible in the dread darkness of a movie theater  as did one fellow sitting behind me at a sneak preview. Others will want to see it a second time to catch the dialogue overwhelmed by laughter during the first viewing.There is no way to criticize these hijinks adequately, except to inventory some treasured moments. One that I recall most fondly is a sermon on a mountain so distant that the listeners can't quite catch the words. ""Blessed are the Greeks?"" says one man. ""How very curious."" ""What did he say?"" asks another fellow, ""'Blessed are the cheesemakers?'"" A third man explains: ""He's not talking literally. What he means to say is blessed are manufacturers in general . . .""Go.",1979-08-17T05:00:00+0000

It's the story of a wealthy, able German businesswoman (Miss Bergman) who submits to the terrors and humiliation of blackmail in order to preserve the innocence of the husband she adores, but whom she systematically undercuts at home and in his career.""Fear"" is not especially concerned with what went wrong in the marriage. Its subject is the depth of a bitterness that can pass for love. It's a simply but beautifully constructed movie that is far more austere than the elegant clothes and upper-middle-class decor would indicate. Even while he was closing out this phase of his film-making career, Rossellini was apparently preparing for the series of great teaching films that were to be the obsession of his last years.Miss Bergman is splendid in a role that quietly hints at her bravura possibilities realized by Ingmar Bergman in last year's ""Autumn Sonata."" Matthias Wiemann plays her husband, a fellow who has apparently spent time in a concentration camp and whose profound feelings provide the film with its unexpected revelations.""Assault on Precinct 13"" is a much more complex film than Mr. Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" though it's not really about anything more complicated than a scare down the spine. A lot of its eerie power comes from the kind of unexplained, almost supernatural events one expects to find in a horror movie but not in a melodrama of this sort.The title tells the story, which is about a small group of people  a police officer, a couple of prisoners and several civilians  who find themselves besieged in a precinct station on the edge of a desolate Los Angeles slum. What makes the film so effective is that the attackers seem to be as motiveless, and relentless, as the zombies who stalk through ""Dawn of the Dead.""If the movie is really about anything at all, it's about methods of urban warfare and defense. Mr. Carpenter is an extremely resourceful director whose ability to construct films entirely out of action and movement suggests that he may one day be a director to rank with Don Siegel.The program will be shown only today at the Thalia.",1979-08-18T05:00:00+0000

In June, President Carter began decontrol of oil prices, an action that, at a cost to consumers of $1.2 billion this year, is designed to promote domestic production and reduce oil imports. Later, the House overwhelmingly passed legislation to fund development of synthetic fuels at a likely cost of at least several billion dollars. Again, the explanation was the need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Yet, while Americans are asked to pay higher prices and higher taxes in the fight for energy independence, the Government is paying the major oil companies $1.2 billion a year",1979-08-18T05:00:00+0000

One  probably the majority must have included Americans who, troubled by the gasoline shortage and a sense of the nation's diminishing power, drew from Mr. Carter a sudden, though perhaps only brief, revival of hope. For the other group, the words had the opposite effect. These people heard a confirmation of their own belief: America is doomed.",1979-08-19T05:00:00+0000

The undeleted expletive, the unfinished sentence, the uncouth metaphor, the uninspired, ungrammatical, unstructured or unoriginal statement have all been too frequently heard in Presidential conversations and press conferences in recent years. (Mr. Carter's image advisers could thus cite ample precedent in urging him to sound tough in his two highly publicized references to Senator Edward Kennedy, one threatening to whip the Senator from behind, the other denouncing a Kennedy charge as baloney.)",1979-08-19T05:00:00+0000

And though the purists may have been embarrassed  one critic called him the Puccini of twelvenote music  the public response, particularly to Berg's operas, Wozzeck and Lulu, has never been in doubt. With royalties from Wozzeck, a monthly stipend from his publisher, and commissions for the concert aria Der Wein and the Violin Concerto, Berg had few financial worries in the years before his death in 1935 at the age of 55.

us,Screen: Herzog's 'Woyzeck':Jewish Tunes in Queens,"THE films of Werner Herzog, the West German director of ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God,"" ""Kasper Hauser,"" ""Heart of Glass"" and ""Stroszek,"" among others, are night landscapes lighted briefly by lightning. Everything is brilliantly clear and profoundly eerie, and the after-image is even more vivid than the original.At the heart of each Herzog film is a mystery, not because information is arbitrarily withheld, but because every Herzog film is a record of the director's questions and speculations about his subject  which is, I suspect, why he chooses to do the films he does. To do anything else would be storytelling of a kind that doesn't interest him. Questions for which the answers are simple aren't worth asking.This is the hypnotic effect of Mr. Herzog's newest film, ""Woyzeck,"" which opens today at the Cinema Studio 2 and the Quad 3 Cinema, and which contains the performance that won the Best Supporting Actress award for Eva Mattes at this year's Cannes Festival.Mr. Herzog's screenplay is based on the unfinished German play written by Georg Buchner in 1836 shortly before he died, the title of which was misspelled as ""Wozzeck"" when it was first published in 1879. ""Wozzeck,"" which also served as the basis for the Alban Berg opera, was itself based on the true story of Johann Christian Woyzeck, a barber-solider who was beheaded in Leipzig in 1821 for murdering his mistress.Though the narrative is as straightforward as that of a fairy tale, Mr. Herzog's ""Woyzeck"" is, if possible, ever more mysterious by the time we reach the end than it is at the beginning. His Woyzeck, played by Klaus Kinski, who was the obsessed conquistador in ""Aguirre,"" is a good deal more than Society's victim, which is the accepted Marxist interpretation of the story.Mr. Kinski, with his deeply lined faced that is simultaneously youthful and ancient, looks like death given a reprieve. From the moment we first set eyes on him, he is occupied by demons, furiously going through calesthenics that seem to be some kind of punishment. As others drive Woyzeck, he drives himself. He never walks if he can run. He is late for life. When he shaves his captain, the officer has to tell him to slow down, that he still has 30 years of service ahead of him.Woyzeck supplements his meager soldier's pay by allowing himself to be the guinea pig for the town's doctor, a loony man-of-science whose grand experiment requires Woyzeck to stay on a diet of nothing but peas. The doctor is bent on proving that it's possible to turn a man into a donkey.The focal point of Woyzeck's life is Marie (Miss Mattes), a buxom young woman who has borne him a son simply because  one gathers  there wasn't much else to do. When it becomes apparent even to Woyzeck, who'd prefer not to think about such things, that Marie is having an affair with the garrison's robust drum major, Woyzeck takes Marie for a walk in the fields and murders her. It's a measure of the Herzog style that this scene is actually painful to watch, though it's less violent in detail than a flat tire.This is the outline of a film that is neither about the exploitation of one class by another, nor about something as easily diagnosed as jealousy. Mr. Herzog's Woyzeck is, instead, possessed by intimations of the mortality of mankind. He tries to ignore the awful voices he hears and the wicked visions he sees, but he can't. He must accept everything. One day the sky over the town turns into what he describes as ""white fire."" He fears that ""nature is running out."" The doctor, who is delighted by Woyzeck's various aberrations, pays no attention when Woyzeck anticipates the day when ""the world goes dark, and everything crumples up like a spider web.""Even though doom and dark stalk all of Mr. Herzog's work, his films are too cool and too beautiful to be gloomy in any sentimental way. Also, when a film so involves the viewer in its speculations, there's no time for the kind of identification with character, the method by which most movies operate.Mr. Kinski is a riveting screen presence who threatens at any minute to burst beyond the limitations of the medium. It would be impossible to imagine either ""Aguirre"" or ""Woyzeck"" without him. Miss Mattes, best known here as the spoiled, pouty patricide in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ""Jail Bait,"" gives a surprising dimension of intelligence and sadness to the role of the unfortunate but not unknowing Marie.Mr. Herzog is a poet for whom neither Marx nor Freud supplies all the answers. He cherishes as well as guards the mystery at the heart of Woyzeck.",1979-08-24T05:00:00+0000

During the past decade, during which photography has emerged as a major presence in the museum and gallery world, promoters of the medium have been running as fast as they can in two apposite directions. In one direction, the past, they have been rediscovering or reevaluating the old masters of 9th and early 20thcentury photography In the other direction, the future, they have been encouraging, even forcing, the emergence of young photographers who would, it was hoped, do for photography what Cezanne, Picasso and Pollock did for painting.",1979-08-26T05:00:00+0000
us,THE AMERICAN STYLE,"Liberated, elegant, seductive: these three compelling words may make an odd team, but they very satisfactorily describe fall '79 American fashion. The best designers have merged the freemoving practicality of American sportswear with a luxury of color, fabric and attitude that epitomizes contemporary elegance. And seeping through everything is a pervasive air of seductiveness, expressed in a kittenish kick, a flirtatious swoosh, a revealing dip, that softens any hard edges the practical clothes may have and removes the aloofness that elegance can impart. This pretty, heady mix has resulted in some of the most beautiful, delightful and desirable clothes to have come our way in many seasons. They are a sort of melding of the unencumbered clothes that were in fashion as 1978 rolled in, and the constricted, wideshouldered, tauttothebody silhouette that appeared to take over as 1978 rolled out. The resulting silhouette is one with a slight broadening of the shoulders, a generally closertothebody line that defines the breasts, the waist, the curve of the hips, and a shorter skirt that looks best hovering somewhere around the knee. As this feminine, flattering silhouette is developed by the large number of good American designers, it takes on a variety of interpretations that will probably appeal to many more women than any of the recent fashion flipflops of this decade. At one extreme there are the controlled  in line, as well as attitude  designs that will bring back fond memories of the security, glamour and correctness of the 1950's. (I'm so glad Donald Brooks is back designing, one buyer of a Middle West specialty shop said. I think women want that again  some of them never did get with matte jersey.) At the other end of the spectrum is Calvin Klein who, perhaps better than any other designer, understands the relaxed, uncomplicated aspect of the word elegance and whose designs most clearly spell out liberated, elegant, seductive  and in doing so, point the way to dressing for the 1980's. In between there are all shades of diverse designs for all sorts of women  from the glamour and unabashed bravura of Bill Blass's designs. to the flirtatious flounces of Oscar de la Renta, to the cool, practical approach to luxury espoused by Halston, to the unconventional but confident style of Perry Ellis, to mention just a few of the remarkable talents working in America now.",1979-08-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Actor's Revenge':Tale of Old Japan,"""The Actor's Revenge"" (""The Revenge of Ukeno-Jo"") was shown at the 1971 Bijou Cinema's festival of Japanese imports. The following review was written by Howard Thompson and was published in The New York Times on June 17, 1971. The film opens today at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street.NO, ""The Actors's Revenge"" isn't about the murder of a drama critic. That might have been more interesting. It is an artistically arranged but extremely rambling exercise full of melodramic bumps and lumps, as a vengeful actor destroys three men who ruined his family years ago.The hitch, of course, is a pretty face, that of a pure-hearted daughter, caught up in the murderous coils. And Ayako Wakao is a beaut.It is the exquisite face of this girl and some artful color dcor that are the main interests. For the general effect of the story, obviously intended as an old-time tale of traditional gravity, is splintery stuff and often confusing. And Kon Ichikawa's direction is a curious mixture of stylish artifice and plain bombast.The strangest thing of all, perhaps, for a story of Old Japan is the subtly, sleeky Occidental musical score, slipping into cool and torchy jazz at the oddest moments. The acting is pretty good, with traditional grunts and growls held to a minimum.Even so, it's hard to fathom the supposed charisma of the wily hero, Kazuo Hasegawa, who easily magnetizes his victims. As a Kabuki female impersonator, he's also at it offstage, mincing and mewing with some abrupt, lightning sword work. Yes, there's plenty of chopping. But this time the sound and fury signify only so-so dividends out front, at least here.",1979-08-28T05:00:00+0000

But he added that there were bound to be changes in the market, more batteryoperated clocks, for instance, and a greater use of electronically controlled devices.

A magnetic rack is versatile since it can be mounted either vertically or horizontally and will hold the larger blades that will be introduced in the fall with a larger model of processor.

Tavola Calda da Alfredo on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village is one of the most attractive and innovative Italian eating places in the city, offering a moderately priced assortment of dishes that range from choices as light as stuffed vegetables or cold vegetable salads through a selection of pastas to several substantial meat and poultry dishes featured each day. The setting is simple and bright, though crowded and noisy, and the tone is casual. It is extremely popular with those who wish to enjoy diverting and satisfying food without having to wear anything more formal than blue jeans and Tshirts.

The children, apparently, have gone on to rewards in other endeavors, as has the gambler. That leaves Mr. Knotts and Mr. Conway to carry on in the sequel, which is as cheerful and painless as not going to the dentist.The screenplay, written by Don Tait, has Mr. Knotts, who looks more fragile and worried than ever, and Mr. Conway, who possesses the serenity of the well-fed, attempting to go straight, but nevertheless being hunted throughout the West as desperadoes.Kenneth Mars is very funny as a big but bird-brained lawman named Woolly Billy Hitchcock. The supporting cast includes Jack Elam, as a truly dishonest bandit, and young Tim Matheson and Elyssa Davalos as what used to be called ""the love interest."" The veteran actor Harry Morgan has some nice moments as the commandant of a frontier fort that Mr. Knotts and Mr. Conway accidentally burn down as they are attempting to serve fruit punch. It's to the movie's credit that at the time this happens it seems absolutely logical.
