us,Inside the List,"Class Mates: When Nancy Isenberg began her latest work of American history, White Trash  a comprehensive survey of the white underclass going back to colonial times  she had no idea that thanks largely to the very group she was writing about, Donald Trump would become the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Now that he has, and her suddenly topical book has entered the hardcover nonfiction list at No.8, I asked Isenberg (a history professor at Louisiana State University) what she made of the presidential race so far. Electoral politics has always encouraged con artists, she said via email. By talking tough, by boasting that hed love to throw a punch at a protester, Trump pretends he is stepping down from his opulent Manhattan penthouse to commingle with the unwashed masses. Wearing his bright red Bubba cap and crooning at one rally, I love the poorly educated, he has built upon a familiar strain of American populism. Which is to say, a dose of redneck bluster goes a long way. (The same dynamic, she noted, came to the Democrats aid in 1992: It helped that Bill Clinton called himself Bubba and played the saxophone. It helped, too, that journalists dubbed him the Arkansas Elvis.) I asked why underprivileged whites so often vote differently from poor people of other races  shouldnt economic considerations be more or less colorblind?  and Isenberg reached back to history for her answer. Southern white Democrats fueled racial conflict between poor blacks and whites in order to redirect the anger of the lower classes away from the white elite, she said. In 1790, John Adams argued that Americans not only scrambled to get ahead; they needed someone to disparage. ... Lyndon Johnson came to the same conclusion, in explaining the racism of poor whites: If you can convince the lowest white man hes better than the best colored man, he wont notice youre picking his pocket. Then she returned to the current election cycle. Trumps supporters want class security, not revolution, she said. They want more blue-collar white male jobs, not equality, not social justice. They want to turn the clock backward in order to regain the white male pride that comes from being the family breadwinner. Trumps slogan, Make America Great Again, is a nostalgic appeal to the golden age of the 1950s and 1960s, when America was an industrial power and working-class jobs were plentiful. Until we understand our class system, warts and all, we will be saddled with an anemic democratic system that only makes our class and race resentments worse.",2016-07-01T15:37:59+0000

During the morning and afternoon the Allied troops captured the German first positions along the whole front of attack. North of the Somme the French troops established themselves in the approaches to the village of Hardecourt and in the outskirts of the village of Curlu, where fighting continues. South of the Somme the villages of Dampierre, Becquincourt, Bussu and Fay have fallen into our hands. The number of unwounded German prisoners taken by the French troops alone during the day is more than 3,500. On the left bank of the Meuse the whole of the region from Hill 304 to the Mort-Homme has been violently bombarded. On the right bank, toward ten oclock in the morning, our infantry carried out an assault of the Thiaumont work, which was recaptured. The afternoon was marked by a recrudescence of the bombardment in this region, as well as in the Fumin and Chenois sectors.

The blast was the first of a series of nuclear explosions planned to test the trigger of Frances future hydrogen bombs. The bomb  a plutonium device  was exploded from a tower on the atoll of Mururoa, 800 miles southeast of Tahiti. The U.S. and British criticism of the blast was brushed aside by French officials as irritatingly moralizing. France refused to sign the 1963 treaty, claiming it was designed to persuade a U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly. Today most major countries joined in publicly condemning the French blast. But the Soviet Union and Communist China reported it without comment. French officials here and in Paris did not reveal the size of the explosion. A Defense Ministry communiqu from Paris said only that its power was in the tactical range. The blast was weak enough to allow French officials to stroll in the explosion area ten hours later wearing street clothes. The United States said it regretted that France has resumed nuclear testing in the atmosphere at a time when most world nations have signed the limited test ban treaty. Japan, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Chile and India were among other countries deploring the blast.  New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 4, 1966",2016-07-03T13:36:17+0000

The number of villages now wrested from the invader has reached seventeen, and more than 12,300 prisoners are reported up to the present. The Germans have intensified and multiplied their counter-attacks, but, apart from slight successes at one or two points, have only added to the hecatombs of their dead on the battlefields of the Somme. The French troops, by a lightning advance, have now conquered along a front of seven and a half kilomtres the two lines of trenches forming the German second line between the Mreaucourt wood and the outskirts of Estres, carrying by assault during the process the villages of Herbcourt, Feuillres and Assevillers and the Chapitre wood. During the afternoon they continued their advantage and, progressing beyond the enemys second line, took the villages of Buscourt and Flaucourt, an advance of five kilomtres in that region. The British troops fighting between the Somme and the Ancre have had to meet many powerful German counter-attacks, but despite the enemys desperate resistance the strongly-fortified village of La Boisselle has been captured, and the Germans are now fighting fiercely to retain the doomed village of Ovillers. Appalling losses have been inflicted on the enemy during his counter-attacks, and the British total of prisoners has reached 4,300.

Its new restaurant in Times Square takes cold cereal in inventive directions, thanks to Christina Tosi, the pastry chef behind the Milk Bar chain, who started serving cereal milk eight years ago. She has devised various combinations, six with a choice of milk (from a local dairy), soy milk or yogurt, and four with Blue Marble soft-serve ice cream. Extra ingredients include matcha, fresh peaches, lemon zest, passion-fruit jam made in Brooklyn, pistachios and white chocolate. Ten cereals are available, from basic Rice Krispies to rugged All-Bran to baroque Froot Loops. Despite the newfangled flavors, the restaurant also mines nostalgia with white brick walls, some vintage artifacts and little numbered cupboards that you open when your order is ready, almost like the Automat. It is owned by Anthony Rudolf, formerly of Per Se, whom Kelloggs tapped for the partnership. The company wanted the restaurant to be run like and feel like a small business, and, as Andy Shripka, Kelloggs associate marketing director, said, we didnt know how to do that. Originally it hoped to open in the Flatiron district or the East Village, but the Midtown space became available. It made the company a bit nervous. How can we be the opposite of what people expect here in Times Square? Mr. Shripka said. Still, the high-profile location should help promote the brand: $6.50 to $9.50 for cereal bowls with toppings, 1600 Broadway (49th Street), no phone, kelloggsnyc.com.",2016-07-05T18:44:43+0000

In War Paint, currently in previews and opening July 18, before what will be a certain transfer to Broadway, the two-time Tony winners Patti LuPone (Evita, Gypsy) and Christine Ebersole (42nd Street, Grey Gardens) play dueling C.E.O.s whose cosmetics empires helped define the multibillion-dollar beauty business. With a score by Scott Frankel and a book by Doug Wright, the show portrays the rivalry of Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden. In The Chicago Tribune, Michael Korie, the shows lyricist, summed up how the news media pitted them against each other: It was always Jew versus Gentile, American versus Eastern European. Like a Laurel and Hardy act, he said. When it comes to this show, it will most likely also be Ms. LuPone versus Ms. Ebersole.

To avoid snags, your hands should be unadorned, with fingernails cut short. Roll or stretch a softball-size ball of dough (11 to 14 ounces) into a 10-inch circle. Drape it over your hands, and bring them up to your chest like a boxer. Your dominant hand should be palm up, the other in an upward-facing fist. If youre right handed, youll be rotating the dough in a clockwise spin (counterclockwise for lefties). To wind up for the toss, wheel your palm in the opposite direction of your eventual throw. Unwind, simultaneously pushing up and rotating your palm until the back of your wrist faces you. Release the dough just above your head, and catch it again at your upper chest atop the knuckles of both fists. Repeat. Try not to catch the dough right in the center, which can weaken the middle, resulting in what Gemignani calls droopy pizza slices. Always practice over a clean countertop so you can salvage fumbled catches.",2016-07-08T11:00:05+0000

The text, which is brief, but of considerable importance, proves the firm determination of the two Powers to maintain relations of mutual confidence and to co-ordinate their efforts for the defence of their rights and legitimate interests. It does not in any way threaten the situation of any other Power having equally-pacific designs, and it is in complete harmony with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, of which it augments the force and is a corollary. Frequent allusions from an unauthorized source have intimated that the document will have an important influence on the future attitude of Japan toward China.

Birnbaum spent four and a half years driving around to collect them, hauling them back one or two at a time.

Entering Voyeur Voyager Forager Forester, Birnbaums installation of 16 of these totems at Denny Gallery on the Lower East Side is intended to feel, then, a bit like walking into a dense, humming forest. And like all forests, this one is full of surprises: Using paint and other artistic tools, Birnbaum created a lively interior for each of the fridges, filling them with everyday items from earrings to toilet-paper rolls. All you have to do is open the door.

(Consider: More than 76million viewers tuned in for the Seinfeld finale, while the much anticipated Mad Men finale drew approximately 4.6 million.) Now the show and its influence are the subject of a new book, Seinfeldia, by the entertainment writer Jennifer Keishin Armstrong, which lands on the hardcover nonfiction list at No.13. They elevated the art of the sitcom, Armstrong told NBC News recently. They did things with it that they were told they couldnt do. Whats more, she said, for a show that was supposedly about nothing, Seinfeld managed to take on many of the social preoccupations of its time. That makes it tempting to imagine what the series would be like today had it continued. It sounds weird, Armstrong said, but I would have loved to see them addressing things like 9/11 or terrorism. ... When something is far enough away, you can start to attack it. She added: Id be interested to see how they would address even more benign things like internet trolling, that sort of thing. Could they possibly pull off an episode about transgender issues? I would be interested. Actually, the trans thing isnt so hard to picture  remember when Kramer came up with the Bro, his bra for men?",2016-07-15T14:43:13+0000

Previous studies showed that people living in cities risked experiencing anxiety and mood disorders at a much higher rate than noncity dwellers  from 29 percent to 39 percent more.The German study, published five years ago, tried to find out more specifically, or rather how, physiologically, this was so. To that end, researchers examined the brains of 50 people, some of whom lived in big cities, some in the country, while they were engaged in challenging mathematical exercises.

Wong runs the Roosevelt Institute, a small think tank (for lack of a better term) that originated in trusts established to promote the legacies of Franklin and Eleanor. Its chief economist, the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, indirectly coined the Occupy movements enduring slogan (We are the 99 percent), and Stiglitz and Wong each saw the election as an opportunity to channel Occupy energy into national politics. The country was perhaps ready once again, they believed, for what F.D.R. called bold, persistent experimentation in our economic affairs.

us,Inside the List,"Agatha Redux: The British crime writer Ruth Ware has two best sellers this week  her new novel, The Woman in Cabin 10, enters the hardcover fiction list at No.4, while her debut, In a Dark, Dark Wood, remains No.8 on the trade paperback list after nine weeks. (My favorite thing about that book, which centers on an amnesiac and a bachelorette party gone very wrong, was learning that the British call such gatherings hen parties. One London reviewer described the story as the hen party from hell, which makes you think things might end in nuggets and dipping sauce.) Both of Wares novels resemble classic locked-door mysteries: Her first takes place in a remote English country house and her latest on a cruise ship in the North Sea  a horrifying enough prospect for some of us even before the protagonist witnesses a murder and is accused of losing her mind. Unsurprisingly, Ware said last year that she was a big fan of the golden-age mystery writers. I love classic crime, she told NPRs David Greene during her Dark Wood publicity tour. I read a huge amount of it as a kid, you know, Agatha Christie, Josephine Tey, Dorothy L. Sayers, Sherlock Holmes. And I didnt consciously channel that when I was writing. But when I finished and reread the book, I did suddenly realize how much this kind of structure owed to, particularly, Agatha Christie. It wasnt consciously done, but I think the setting, you know, the way its a closed cast of characters  I would say I definitely owe a debt to Christie.",2016-07-27T22:18:06+0000
