An innovative plan called the preferred interest rate program allows a buyer of a home on which Talman already holds the mortgage to take over the home loan of the previous owner at two percentage points above the original mortgage rate. The assumed loan and any new loan required are weighed and averaged to determine the interest rate charged on the new financial package. One couple saved almost $2,000 in yearly mortgage payments on a cozy brick home they purchased for $44,000, minus a 20 percent down payment, when they assumed the old $31,000 mortgage, which had a 6.5 percent rate. Talman charged the couple 10.8 percent to wrap up their 30-year deal. While some states insist that home purchasers be allowed to assume an existing mortgage at the original interest rate, others permit lenders to set the terms. Given that freedom, most lenders bar the assumption of mortgages so they are free to raise the interest rate to prevailing market levels. 'Due on Sale' In Illinois, under the ""due on sale"" clause in mortgage contracts, the lending bank has the right to call in the mortgage loan if the owner subsequently wants to transfer ownership. While the plan lures potential buyers with lower-than-usual mortgage rates, it is designed to undercut under-the-table transactions between buyers and sellers that have been costing thrift institutions millions in lost interest payments.",1981-01-02T05:00:00+0000

His 1960's performing groups included a future Minimalist trailblazer, Terry Riley, and a future rock-and-roll prophet, John Cale, but made no commercial recordings. His ''Dream House'' music, a thunderously amplified droning, is preserved only on a dauntingly rare French album.

DAVID BRINKLEY AND HIS 'NBC MAGAZINE'","The prime-time news magazine is proving that journalism, too, can be profitable for the television industry. With the aggressive personality of Mike Wallace dominating its on-air style, ''60 Minutes'' continues to maintain its top-10 ratings for CBS. Over at ABC, ''20/20'' has parlayed superstar biographies and Geraldo Rivera flashiness into consistently strong audience numbers. Only NBC has failed to get a firm foothold in the area. ''NBC Magazine,'' overseen by David Brinkley and producer Paul Friedman, has languished at or near the bottom of the weekly ratings lists since its debut last September. Part of the problem may be that the program has not yet settled into a comfortable format. Far more obvious, there is the competition. On Fridays at 10, ''NBC Magazine'' has had the misfortune to run up against CBS's ''Dallas,'' the most popular of weekly series for the past several months.

But when the streets were wet or icy, she changed her route to avoid that sidewalk. ""I find it slick and if there's ice, forget it - it just doesn't grip,"" she said. Israel Iveson, a 75-year old part-time messenger, walked in front of 1 Times Square while on the job last winter. It had snowed that morning and the terazzo sidewalk was icy and slippery. Mr. Iveson fell and fractured his hip. His lawyer has filed a claim against the city for a million dollars, charging that Mr. Iveson was disabled for life. In a pending case, Mohamed Ahmed, an accounting clerk, seeks $2 million in damages for injuries that he says resulted from a fall in 1974, when he was 52, on a terrazzo sidewalk outside 522 Fifth Avenue on a rainy day. Mr. Ahmed says he was permanently disabled, with a loss of sight in one eye and the use of an arm seriously impaired. Both the property owner - then the First National City Bank - and the city were sued for $2 million on the claim that terrazzo is dangerous when wet and needs to be covered, at the very least, by a rubber mat.

No one could read these through without realizing that Bogan was an extraordinary person, altogether larger in wit, anger, passion, contempt for stupidities and proud reticence than one had gathered from the poems alone. This is exactly how she insisted that it be, for as she remarks here, ''open confession for certain temperaments (certainly for my own), is not good for the soul, in any direct way.'' She was also suspicious of journal-keeping, in which the tendency toward ''self-regarding emotion ... can become overwhelming.''

""Of course I remember you!"" I was astounded. Linda Harrison had been one of 15 students in a discussion section that had met weekly, just the previous semester, my first as a philosophy professor at Smith College. How could she suppose I wouldn't remember her? When I thought about it later, my astonishment was tempered by the reflection that when I was an undergraduate I imagined myself part of a fog of names, faces and personalities to my professors, a fog that might clear when I spoke up in class or besieged them during office hours, but would quickly and inexorably descend again. After all, they had so very many other students and such other important things to think about. But later that week I heard my colleagues reminisce about students who had graduated five years previously. So it wasn't true! That was the first of several startling comparisons I made between the views from the students' and the professors' sides of the desk. Another occurred after having brooded about what seemed to me an epidemic of absences from class. It had to mean that they thought me boring or incompetent. I confessed to a senior in my other class my anxiety over the number of students who skipped my intro course. ""Hmmm,"" she said, ""does it meet early in the morning? Or right after lunch? Or in the evening?"" My worry dissipated.",1981-01-04T05:00:00+0000

For one thing, he dresses down for the occasion, wearing stained jeans, a worn corduroy shirt and casual herringbone sports jacket. For another, his discussion of the Bard's sonnets and plays is spattered with fourlettered words and an occasional bawdy story. These are tactics from which Mr. West refrains when teaching Shakespeare by day at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, a campus dominated by young women from upper-middle-class homes. But on Monday nights the professor's audience is very different: all his students are male, most from out of town and all serving time at Great Meadow Correctional Facility, a maximum-security lockup in this hamlet in rural Washington County. Mr. West is one of 17 professors who weekly make the hour-long trip from the lush Skidmore campus to teach a course behind bars. The program of inmate education is considered to be among the nation's oldest, largest and most successful. The courses are part of Skidmore's external-degree program, ironically named the University Without Walls. It began as a controversial experiment in 1974 with a dozen professors teaching four courses to 30 inmates. Today, higher-education courses for inmates can be found in prisons across the country, partly as a result of the success of the Skidmore plan, which has grown to the point where it has been called ""a mini-college behind bars.""",1981-01-04T05:00:00+0000

As students enroll in record numbers in pursuit of the Master of Business Administration, the degree program that vies with medical and law school for the attention of the best, the brightest and the most ambitious college graduates, increasing numbers of critics have been grumbling about the inability of some highly paid graduates to live up to their billing. Some of the growning numbers of programs in the last 15 years have been challenged as too low in quality and others as too firmly anchored in the status quo. Since new M.B.A.'s are estimated to get starting salaries 60 percent above those for liberal-arts bachelors, it is not surprising that there has been mushrooming groth in business degrees. In 1980, more than 50,000 men and women received advanced business degrees, compared with only 5,000 a decade and a half earlier. Stanford University, for example, reports that its class of 1980 commanded median starting pay of $32,000, up from $27,000 the year before. The natinal average is $21,300. Yet, Business Week recently detected ""disenchangment"" with the business schools' product. It reported complaints from business about ""the inability of newly minted M.B.A.'s to communicate, their overreliance on mathematical techniques of management and...expectations of becoming chairman in four weeks."" Other critics complain that, at a time when American business is in need of change, business schools are not turning out enough young people with new ideas and a flair for shaking up existing procedures.",1981-01-04T05:00:00+0000

In his previous books, Walter Abish has played the part of rubber-razer in our literary landscape, digging up the dust beneath the surface of our everyday words. He has played this part with wit and imagination, using language to question its own veracity; permitting syntactic ambiguities to hover quizzically over their object, only to zero in for a final demolition job. Now Mr. Abish has written a novel. (The earlier ""Alphabetical Africa"" was more a literary extravaganza than a novel.) In ""How German Is It,"" Mr. Abish seeks to apply this rubble-razing technique to the new Germany. With what results? One is reminded of the gimmicky cards sent out recently by our local gas companies. The cards have a rough spot, and they say, ""Scratch this surface and you will recognize the smell of gas."" In both cases, the effect is less convincing than startling. The ""surface"" in this case is a modern German town built on the site of a mass-grave and former concentration camp. The town is new-named Brumholdstein after Germany's leading philosopher, a Heidegger think-alike, dot the pages of the book, ""documenting"" the ineffable Germanness of all things German. The main characters are two brothers who are seen as incorporating the Janus aspects of the new Germany. Helmuth Hargenau, the complacent conformist, is and has just completed a new police station where the files on his brother, Ulrich, author and one-time terrorist, are to be housed.",1981-01-04T05:00:00+0000

The consortium, the University of Mid-America centered in Nebraska and the Public Broadcasting Service in Washington are the new promoters of televised college education. Starting with a $400,000 grant from the Carnegie Corporation, the consortium, headquartered in Owings Mills, Md., involves seven colleges, each matched with a local public-broadcasting station or cable station. Besides the centers at the University of Maryland, the participants are Pennsylvania State University, California State University at Carson, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y.; Southern Vermont College, in Bennington, and Linfield College in McMinnville, Ore. The concept of home study with televised lectures leading to a college degree, which has been such an accepted success at Britain's Open University (60,000 students), is relatively new to the United States.

My wife and daughter, devout non-divers, are enduring the results of my latest underwater photography expedition - 400 slides, none of them clear. Around slide 87, boredom provokes questions. ""What's that?"" my wife, Ellen, asks. ""A grouper."" ""Where's its head?"" ""It kept swimming away from me. Actually it's not a bad tail shot of a grouper."" After two frustrating years, my pictures ranged from bad to atrocious, despite my collection of underwater photography books, scubadiving magazines and equipment catalogues. What was the one magical gizmo I lacked that would integrate light, color, water and fish, and produce the dazzling pictures I sought? In search of the answer I enrolled in the underwater photography course given by Stephen Frink in Key Largo, Fla. In three days of classroom instruction and diving in the underwater Pennekamp Park, my pictures improved dramatically. More important, I discovered the magical gizmo was between my ears and not on the camera. Each year more than 200,000 divers explore Pennekamp Park, which was established in 1960 as the nation's first underwater preserve. Within its boundaries are 75 square miles of underwater treasure, including the only living coral reefs in North America. Stephen's three-day courses are held 10 times a year and each is limited to six students. The first session of the course I attended was a discussion of equipment.

Having become dependent on the billions in Federal money that support educational activity over the last two decades, few school districts, universities or colleges can imagine life without it. And Mr. Ronald Reagan and his advisers have stated that spending priorities must be subject to hard scrutiny, and cuts must be made.  Moreover, longstanding quarrels between liberals who have held sway over educational policy for years and the ascendant conservatives promise clashes over such questions as the right of public schools to have nearly full claim on Federal funds, mandatory busing for racial balance, s","certain school districts offer bilingual education, where youngsters raised speaking a foreign language would be taught at least initially in that language. The foundation also urged that compensatory education funds under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act be cut when officials cannot show that they enhance the education of youngsters who lag behind their schoolmates. Greater emphasis would be placed on research to find ways to teach basic classroom skills to youths who need them. Various forms of ""quotas"" allegedly used in affirmative-action programs to increase the racial mixture of students in schools would be dropped. And in a suggestion that strikes fear in many public school officials and teachers unions, the foundation recommends the use of vouchers by parents of students with special needs - such as lagging ghetto youths, or especially gifted students, or Hispanic students who want exposure to more Spanish culture - so that they may turn to nonpublic sources for their education If President Reagan pursues most of the foundation's objectives, he may find some surprising allies. For instance, the American Federation of Teachers has indicated that it strongly favors a reduction in regulations imposed on local districts by Federal officials. The union and many local officials say they would welcome relief from bilingual requirements, on restricitons regarding disciplinary measures against uncooperative students and on special provisions in normal classes so the handicapped can participate in them.

Today Mrs. Pasztor is studying to be an engineer while working as an electro-mechanical technician at Digital Equipment Corporation. ""Where it not for Project ACT,"" she said, ""I could never have received the training I needed to land a job."" But were it not for the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, Project ACT would never have existed, according to Janis Peters, ACT's project director. Project ACT is just one of 713 small but effective projects that since 1973 have received ""feed"" money from the Fund - a relatively small, seemingly underfinanced, but broadly innovative and increasingly popular Federal agency in the Department of Education. Created by Congress in 1972, the Fund was mandated to encourage ""the reform, innovation, and improvement of postsecondary education and provide equal educational opportunity for all."" Indeed, it is this spirit that has characterized and guided the Fund. While it has supported a wide variety of projects, its agenda has focused on the major problems confronting higher education. And in so doing, it has given fresh mea to the word ""postsecondary,"" expanding it to include all post-high-school education, not just that at traditional universities.",1981-01-04T05:00:00+0000

THE attic room at the corner of the west wing building on the 400-acre campus of Choate Rosemary Hall - a 972-student coed boarding school created in 1973 by a merger of two single-sex institutions, was a timeless daguerreotype of teenage disarray.  The two bunk beds, covered in trendy colored sheets, were rumpled.  Soiled socks, athletic shoes, discarded soda cans and opened books - the hardware of a busy and active student life - lay strewn about like discarded toys. Wall posters of folk heroes fought for space with more sentimental photos of families and pets. On the floor sat a clock radio with the alarm set for 7 A.M. - a clue that, unlike the old days, bells no longer tolled to waken students.  Jeffrey Weisfeld of Hunter, N.Y., and Peter Tampas of Burlington, Vt., 10th-graders who occupy the room, say they enjoyed the chance to stuff the place w","students (66) as there were in 1960, many black and Orientals, and 21 percent of the student body is on scholarship, compared with 12 percent 20 years ago. Partly as a result of a decline of confidence in public schools, Choate Rosemary Hall, like most private schools, is being overwhelmed with applicants. This enables the school to choose from the cream of the adolescent crop and maintain higher academic standards. The school had a record 4,000 applications in the last school year, compared with 2,400 in 1973. In fact, there has been a substantial overall increase in boardingschool enrollment over the last decade, according to the Natinal Association of Independent Schools. Based on association membership figures, total enrollment has risen 15.5 percent. The association expects continued growth, citing such factors as the rise of the two-income family and the resulting increase in its disposable income, more working mothers needing this kind of service for their children, a more sophisticated public ready to spend the required amount of money to obtain the kind of education they feel their children should have, and the more specialized environment many of these schools now offer. ""Because so many people are applying, I think morale is better than it used to be,"" said Jennifer Meagher of Hyde Park, N.Y., a senior at Choate Rosemary Hall.

us,Test Coming in February,"""I think that here the church is a reflection of what is happening in our society, particularly at the level of Government,"" said Enrique Miret Magdalena, a liberal lay activist who heads the Association of Small Businessmen. ""And, as socially and politically the country is goint to the right, too."" An important test will come in February when Vicente Cardinal Enrique y Tarancon, the Archbishop of Madrid, steps down as president of the Episcopal Conference. In the hierarchy's top job since 1972, the 73-yearold prelate has been an open-minded conciliator among the Spanish church's several families; he sheltered foes of the Franco regime and tried to keep his bishops out of politics in the tense months after the dictator's death in November 1975. Since King Juan Carlos has renounced the privilege Franco had of naming bishops, the Vatican's influence in the Episcopal Conference has steadily grown, and Cardinal Enrique y Tarancon's successor will doubtless have the Pope's approval. Both conservatives and liberals have their favorites, but one leading compromise candidate acceptable to Rome is Jose Delicado Baeza, the 53-year-old Bishop of Valladolid. Cardinal Enrique y Tarancon successfully opposed the establishment of an Italian-style Christian Democratic party in Spain, which would have overtly involved the church in politics, and he muffled rightist clerical protests against the democratic Constitution that was adopted in 1978. The Constitution disestablished the church, but it notes the special place of the Catholic faith. However, one strong faction within Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez's governing Union of the Democratic Center considers itself ""Christian Democratic,"" and, in Parliament, has successfully defended the maintenance of subsidies to church schools.",1981-01-06T05:00:00+0000

The choice of Mr. Bell, who is Commissioner of Higher Education in Utah, is expected to be announced this week, officials close to Mr. Reagan's transition said. Transition officials also said that Mr. Reagan was expected to choose Bill Brock, chairman of the Republican National Committee, as special trade representative, the only other Cabinet-level post that has not been filled. Word of the imminent selection of Mr. Bell and Mr. Brock came as the President-elect met with staff members and Cabinet designees here and also announced the appointment of James S. Brady, his transition spokesman, as press secretary. Making his first public appearance in connection with an appointment to his incoming administration, Mr. Reagan told reporters that both Mr. Brady and his newly announced deputy, Karna Small, a television news broadcaster, would have access to Mr. Reagan personally and to the inner workings of the government.",1981-01-07T05:00:00+0000

According to the Natinoal Weather Service, a cold front moving in from the Ohio Valley is expected to plunge the thermometer back into the teens this afternoon after the snowfall tapers off during the morning and ends around noon. The Weather Service predicted accumulation of four inches in the city and five to six inches in inland areas by daylight. Vito Turso, a Sanitation Department spokesman, said that 250 salt spreaders were on the streets last night and that at 1 A.M. snowplows were sent out to clear the streets for the first time this winter. He estimated that by morning 75 plows would be manned throughout the city. The New York City Department of Transportation suspended alternate side parking at 2 A.M. today because of the snow. The period of unusual cold, which began four days ago and reached a low of 5 degrees early Sunday morning, has resulted in complaints from thousands of New Yorkers that their apartments were without heat or had inadequate heat. Dr. Elliot M. Gross, Chief Medical Examiner, said the cold contributed to the deaths of three men, two in Brooklyn and one in the Bronx, and might have been a factor in the death of another Bronx man, whose body was to be examined today.",1981-01-07T05:00:00+0000

""There is strong evidence to believe"" that use of the drugs ""may actually result in agonizingly slow and painful deaths that are far more barbaric than those caused by the more traditional means of execution,"" the petition states. The petition, first disclosed by the Washington Drug Letter, a weekly newsletter, asks Patricia Roberts Harris, Secretary of Health and Human Services, to ban the use of lethal injections as contrary to laws enforced by the Food and Drug Administration. Approved in Four States No one has been executed by the method, which has been approved by Texas, Oklahoma, Idaho and New Mexico. Those states house 166 of the 691 people currently under death sentence in the United States, according to the petition. In addition Florida, Tennessee, Nevada, South Carolina, Washington and Kansas have ""seriously considered"" adopting the method, according to lawyers for the two men. Oklahoma regultaions specify that sodium thiopental, a quick-acting barbituate, be used in conjunction with a chemical paralytic - tubocurarine, succinylcholine chloride or potassium chloride.

He says the discovery could prompt a radical reassessment of the nature of paleolithic man. In an article in the January issue of Illustrated London News, Dr. Tom Rogers describes two engravings of a bison and the head of an unidentifiable animal with two horns that he found aboce the Wye River at Symond's Yat East in Herefordshire on the border with Wales. The art is believed to date from between 15,000 and 13,000 B.C. Dr. Rogers, 48 years old, the director of the Stone Age Studies Research Association, Rodney Russell of the Bureau of Archeology in Zurich and Andrew Pinder of London's Institute of Archeology discovered the engravings by accident last summer. Cave Is Reinvestigated ""I missed it for 19 years,"" Dr. Rogers said of the badly deteriorated ""reindeer"" head, 14 inches high, that he first spotted while resting under a rock overhang. The discovery prompted the archeologist to reinvestigate a cave 50 feet away, and he discovered the 10-inch-long representations of bison. Both works follow the natural contours of the rock into which they were carved. The composite head, with its reindeer horns and the face of a deer, is ""unique in Western Europe; no continental parallels have been traced,"" Dr. Rogers said. The bison, on the other hand, resemble French and Spanish cave art of the same period.",1981-01-08T05:00:00+0000

Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher conferred in Algiers with the Algerian Foreign Minister on questions raised by the Algerian intermediaries over Washington's proposals to Iran. (Page A1, Col. 6.) Efforts to resolve the hostage crisis have been complicated by legal questions over the extent of President Carter's authority to meet Iran's demands. American lawyers representing Iranian interests have quietly been helping Teheran's leaders evaluate the apparent legal obstacles.

Two years ago they were crisscrossing America in a van, playing their fresh blend of rock and reggae in nightclubs. Two successful albums, a series of popular singles and an ambitious world tour have established them internationally. But in America they are still classified as ''New Wave,'' which hasn't been the sort of thing apt to fill the Garden. And while their third album, ''Zenyatta Mondatta'' (A & M), is now in the American top 10, that didn't guarantee a sellout at the Garden either. So everyone connected with the band was pleasantly surprised when the concert sold out just three days after it was announced.

Whether because of greed or inexperience, a restaurateur who gets a three-star or four-star rating, may pack the house beyond the capacities and temperaments of its kitchen and dining-room staff. The inevitable result of such action is poor food and rude or careless service, and a spate of justified complaints. It is gratifying, therefore, to discover that Vienna '79, which received a three-star rating last March, not only has been able to cope with success, but also has improved to the point where it well deserves a four-star rating.

us,'CHICAGO' BOUNCES WHEN IT SHOULD BITE,"""CHICAGO,"" the show about a cellful of ""merry murderesses,"" is one of those ""concepts"" musicals that depend on superslick show business style to conceal negligible content and minimal musical values. The Broadhollow Theater has neither the resources to dress it up and do it right nor the resourcefulness to camouflage that. Its ""Chicago"" is a bad idea gone wrong. For some mysterious reason, this is one of the most requested musicals around the Island, according to those audience questionnaires that theater managers persist in handing out. It is all tinsel and not all that titillating; some local producers have even admitted disliking the show but putting it on anyway, just to cater to the customers. In the original director-choreographer Bob Fosse's quirky, jerky dissonances in dance, the decadence and sleaze of a specific era - the late 1920's - were blended with the show's general themes of instant stardom, phony fame, media manipulation and rampant feelinglessness. The dance numbers and the whole musical's movement were inseparable. What it added up to was derivative and ineffectual, but it had gloss, sass and energy, and it was showy. In the Broadhollow production, which is directed by Pat Meares and choreographed by E. Felix, an arrangement that proves neither complementary nor cohesive, the gangster girls bump (sometimes into each other) and grind (in the sense of doing a job mechanically) in some vague semblance of Mr. Fosse's stylized vision of Chicago gun molls. They also sashay and sway as though they were displaced ingenues from ""Oklahoma!""

us,SERVICE-BASED ECONOMY RESISTS SLUMP,"IN the national recession that may or may not be over, New York City has found itself in the position of the Catskills resort comic who is asked how he's doing. ""Compared to what?"" he replies. Compared to most people's idea of good times, New York is hardly doing very well. However, when city officials and private economists look back on all the might-have-beens that were raised only a year ago, they cannot help but conclude that things could have been a lot worse. After two years of growth, New York had a net loss of jobs in 1980, but not that many - about 4,000, a tiny fraction of its total of 3.3 million. That was a far cry from early predictions of a loss of 60,000 or more. And although actual enemployment ran about 9 percent in New York City compared with about 7 percent nationwide, the rate increased more slowly in the city than it did nationally. That phenomenon seems partly the result of an ongoing trend in New York in which expanding service industries have filled the job vacuum left by the contraction of the city's aging manufacturing sector. Increasingly, it is not the lather andthe printer who heads for work each day, but the accountant and the computer specialist. New Yorkers have thus fared comparatively well, leading some students of the job market to mull the possibility of a city that has become ""recession-proof.""

Thus, the high interest rates of 1980 and the prospect that they will continue have led to expectations that both new construction and home resales this year will be below even last year's depressed levels. The predicament has left housing specialists wondering if anything can be done to bring the stability needed by builder and buyer alike. As the year ended, the interest rate for conventional mortgages, where they were available at all, was running between 14 percent and 15 percent, severely curtailing house sales except in a few atypical areas. ""There is a psychological barrier at 13 percent,"" Michael Sumichrast, chief housing economist of the National Association of Home Builders, said. ""People stop looking."" Even if they keep looking, fewer families can qualify financially for mortgages as interest rate increases stiffen the terms set by lenders. The primary sufferer is the prospective first-time home buyer who lacks the accumulation of equity in an existing house to make the minimum down payment. ""The first-time buyer is the sufferer,"" Richard Lind, a builder in Wellesley Hills, Mass, said. ""Even when there are two workers in the family, most families cannot qualify for mortgages at these rates."" Furthermore, with widely fluctuating interest rates, it becomes impossible forbuilders to do the long-term planning required for any large residential development project, builders say. ""People will stop doing it,"" Mr. Lind said.",1981-01-11T05:00:00+0000

'Oh no, don't stop,' he said. 'What were you playing?' It was the Schubert Quartettsatz. So we started playing again, and the man - I swear this is not an exaggeration - the man was sitting there crying like a child. He said, 'What a pity that Schubert was not allowed to finish this piece.' And of course the same thing happened to Berg. It was only several years later that he died, leaving 'Lulu' unfinished.''",1981-01-11T05:00:00+0000

He is clearly one of the most gifted painters of the contemporary Realist school. He brings to his art an unusual sense of refinement - an eye calmly and exquisitely attuned to pictorial nuance. His best pictures achieve a purity of tone and a gravity of feeling unusual in the Realist painting of any period and very different, certainly, from some of the more clamorous Realist styles of our own day. His strongest affinities are obviously with painters of an earlier age, and while his subject matter is unquestionably contemporary -consisting, for the most part, of groups of figures disporting themselves in New York's Central Park - his attitude toward it is not. This, indeed, is the conundrum.",1981-01-11T05:00:00+0000

us,MANAGERS ADOPTING LONG-TERM OUTLOOK,"FOR years, calculating annual bonuses for top managers at Rexnord Inc. was simple: They were linked to howmuch profit managers were getting from the assets thay controlled. Last year, however, executives at the diversified industrial manufacturer tinkered with the old method. There is now a mix of figures to be taken into account, including sales growth, cash flow and return assets. And the mix varies with eah of Rexnord's 65 business units. ""The new plan ties in directly with the strategy for each business,"" Richard Seaman, vice president of corporate planning and development, said. ""Our managers understand more clearly what the objectives of their units are."" Planning with more distant horizons has become a familiar theme among major American businesses, especially those competing in global markets where foreign competitors, particularly Japanese trading companies, have used the technique to achieve big gains in market share. As a result, the old systems for rewarding American managers have to be adjusted to keep in tune with the new planning. It is critical, executives say, to shift the rewards from quarter-to-quarter profit gains to the achievement of longer term goals. American companies are only ""just now getting around to the idea of tying incentive plans to the achievement of operating and strategic objectives,"" Sterling Livingston, a former professor of planning at the Harvard Business School, said.

The Reagan administration should seek to dissolve this nefarious connection between Middle Eastern turmoil and the world oil price, for it poses the single greatest threat to peace and prosperity. In so doing, the administration should keep in mind some recent lessons.",1981-01-12T05:00:00+0000

Given such an auspicious debut - and two Tony awards, to boot - it was hardly surprising that the actress responded with enthusiasm when Lawrence Kasha, the producer of ''Applause,'' recently approached her with a similar project.

A procedural delay in Teheran caused the postponement of parliamentary action on legislation required by Iran for the release of the American hostages, but officials said a vote would be taken today. The postponement resulted from the failure of enough members of a key panel to attend a meeting to approve the legislation. (A10:1.)",1981-01-14T05:00:00+0000

Despite all the findings of modern forestry research, the appetite for setting aside vast areas as wilderness, parks, and private ''preserves,'' where no timber cutting is allowed, has apparently been insatiable. Aside from the the nation's having been deprived of the more than 5,000 useful forest products that these areas could have provided in perpetuity, this program definitely has not been in the public interest. The advocates of ''forest preserves'' stubbornly refuse to recognize the dire consequences of the application of the natural laws of plant succession in such areas. These laws decree that the vast majority of our tree and shrub species, like the majority of our garden plants, require direct access to sunlight to reproduce themselves and grow. So forest stands, if they are left undisturbed, will steadily progress toward a stage in which they will be composed of those few species that can reproduce themselves and survive through their juvenile years in dense shade. This ultimate stand is called a ''climax'' forest.",1981-01-15T05:00:00+0000

Though it consists of only two men, Steely Dan must be counted one of the most influential rock ''groups'' of the past decade. Founded by the songwriting team of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen eight years ago, they started out as a touring sextet. With Mr. Becker, the lead vocalist and bassist, and Mr. Fagen on keyboards, the group had a string of hits including ''Do It Again,'' ''Reeling in the Years,'' and ''Rikki Don't Lose That Number.'' After 1974, they stopped performing and made the recording studio their artistic base, using a shifting array of session musicians instead of fixed personnel. Over the course of seven albums, they've evolved an unusually subtle and literate brand of pop-rock that blends modal jazz harmonies, fusion instrumentation and funktinged polyrhythms within extended pop structures. Though other rock groups like Blood, Sweat & Tears and Chicago have enjoyed commercial success blending jazz and pop, none has come close to matching Steely Dan in sophistication and taste. They helped inspire rock singers like Joni Mitchell to explore jazz and paved the way for the Doobie Brothers' brand of pop-funk. Even stylistically unrelated groups like the Eagles were influenced by Steely Dan's carefully blocked arranging style.",1981-01-18T05:00:00+0000

Where gentlemen and their ladies wore silk brocade and lived intimately with the harmonious proportions of the furniture crafted by the great Newport furniture makers. And where today, thanks to the efforts of the Preservation Society of Newport County, the famous 19th-and 20thcentury estates - The Breakers, The Elms, Marble House, Chateau-SurMer, Kingscote, Rosecliff - still stand as beautiful but vacant hallmarks of a time which resonates only faintly with the cadence of waltzes.",1981-01-18T05:00:00+0000

Walter Lippmann, the sage of the day, scathingly described him as an ''amiable boy scout,'' merely ''a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be President.''",1981-01-18T05:00:00+0000

Most modern boats are built fiber-glass layers bonded together with polyester resin, and the resin is an oil-derivative whose cost has skyrocketed in recent years. Because 50 to 70 percent of a boat hull is resin, the cost of traditionally constructed boats has soared dramatically. This is one reason why designers and builders have started producing boats that are much lighter and simpler.",1981-01-18T05:00:00+0000

No other system will be sufficiently proven or ready to go into large-scale production within the next generation. The familiar internal combustion system, however, is not static. It constantly evolves, improves, and finds new expressions, as the current world of marine power demonstrates. Nothing is radically different, but much has been refined. The prize for originality in 1981 goes to Outboard Marine Corporation for its Sea Drive system for applying outboard power to larger boats. The system, developed from Evinrude's experiments two years ago with a pair of big outboards on a Bertram 28 convertible, amounts to a modified outboard - either a V-6 or a V-4 - mounted in a special bracket that obviates the need for a low transom, but which provides full-tilt and trim. Stored in Separate Tank The power head has reworked ignition timing and carburetion for superior torque in the cruising speed range, and the mounting bracket allows the wiring and air duct to be brought inboard, out of the way of a following sea. For the convenience of long-range cruisers, the Sea Drive units have oil injection. That is, two-cycle oil need not be mixed with the fuel. Rather, the oil supply is stored in a separate tank and injected into the motor by a pump that varies the rate of injection according to engine speed.",1981-01-18T05:00:00+0000

Patches of ice glaze the walled city's cobbled streets. Marguerite Yourcenar is wrapped in an old gray cape and she has tied a gray plaid wollen scarf around her head. Her blue eyes seem black. Cold rises from the sidewalks, and, though she has buttoned plastic rain boots over her shoes, she decides it is still too cold to walk. Her traveling companion, Jerry Wilson, drives her around the corner to the main square in their little red Citroen. As the crewcut young American, wearing one gold earring, and the striking 77-year-old woman enter the restaurant, people turn to stare. Mme. Yourcenar chooses a window table, facing the square, its ancient belfry illuminated by orange spotlights. She orders oysters and discusses the process of fiction: You cannot write about things that are too close. For instance, if I were to write about this dinner, there would be so many things to consider, I wouldn't know where to begin.""",1981-01-18T05:00:00+0000

us,CANADIAN GATEWAY TO THE PACIFIC RIM,"Businessmen here on Canada's west coast have always talked about doing business with ""the East."" Nowadays, more often than not, that means the Far East. As Canada's gateway to the rapidly expanding group of countries around the Pacific Ocean, the so-called Pacific Rim, British Columbia is taking a leading role in developing mass markets there. Many economists expect the rim countries to be the world's fastest growing area in 1980's. A provincial trade delegation, led by Premier William Bennett, is preparing to depart for the area in February. It is the latest such business mission since Canada's Government held a Pacific Rim Opportunities Conference for several hundred executives here in November. ""The future for us is the Pacific Rim,"" said J. Arthur Lower, a Canadian historian who has written widely on the area. Comprising almost three dozen nations, the Pacific Rim stretches from here to Chile, across to Australia and New Zealand and up to China, Japan and South Korea. Together, the area encompasses more than 1.75 billion people, or about 48 percent ofthe world's population. Many of the land - such as South Korea, for instance, which has 50 percent more people than all of Canada - have undergone impressive growth in recent years with basic investments and rising per capita incomes. This has fueled mounting demand for foreign expertise, raw materials and manufactured goods. Besides the attractiveness of Asia's expanding markets, the reasons for the trade growth include proximity (Vancouver is 350 miles closer to Tokyo than it is to Halifax on the eastern coast of Canada), the Canadian West's growing economic power and assertiveness, a need to branch beyond relatively mature domestic markets and a desire for diversification from reliance on United States sales.",1981-01-19T05:00:00+0000

us,HOMEOWNERS IN TRISTATE REGION REDUCE USE OF FUEL OIL AS PRICES INCREASE,"Home insulation, the use of gas or wood, and a greater willingness to lower the thermostat have sharply cut oil use by homeowners in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut this winter, according to industry and government estimates. Oil use, which was down about 20 percent last winter compared with the winter of 1978-79, has fallen again, despite this winter's colder weather, according to most estimates. The motivating factor is the price, now at $1.15 in some areas. ""It's going up faster than we expected,"" said Charles Garrity, a spokesman for the New Jersey energy office. Fuel dealers and state and Federal energy officials say that between 2 and 3 percent of oil users have converted to gas in recent months, and those who remain with oil have insulated attics and installed storm windows, used more wood for heat and simply refused to use their oil furnaces on chilly nights at the beginning and end of the heating season, cutting consumption sharply. Part of National Trend The changes in the three states are part of a national trend, which saw demand for middle distillates - a category that includes home heating oil - drop 12.1 percent in 1980, the American Petroleum Institute, and industry group, estimated last week. The institute said that the demand for petroleum products was more responsible to price than had previously been believed. Middle distillates include diesel fuel, a substance chemically identical to No. 2 heating oil.

""We are the only people in the neighborhood who haven't been robbed,"" says the hostess, who lives in a large Tudor-style house in this affluent Bergen County community near Manhattan. The guests talk of recent burglaries in their neighborhoods, of watching for the car of a known burglar, of burglars convicted and back on the street, of the fear that their homes will be next and the hope that if their homes are invaded, there will not be a confrontation with a burglar. The dinner guests have always viewed Ridgewood as a retreat from such problems. But the police say that when 1980 figures are tabulated, burglaries of residences and businesses here will number ""more than 250,"" up significantly from 159 in 1979 and 189 in 1978. Sharp increases are being registered throughout the suburbs. Kay Shaw, whose home has not been broken into, said she believed the attitude of her fellow Ridgewood residents was one of ""concern, not worry or fear."" The concern leads many to ask that their names not be used. Fear and Anger Combine Betsy Kimmerle, who has been victimized by burglars, sees things differently. ""Everyone in Ridgewood is hyper,"" she said. ""Those who haven't been robbed are worried they will be."" A friend, she added, keeps a baseball bat near the bed and is considering buying a gun. ""He is so mad about the situation that he wants to catch burglars in the house and blow their brains out."" she said.

But the glow of success quickly wore off. For the find, the Attaka field, was just about on the Equator, 12 miles out in the Macassar Strait ""in the middle of nowhere,"" said John N. Turk, managing director of Union Oil's Indonesian affiliate. Kalimantan had no roads, no manpower, no housing, no equipment. ""There was nothing there but oil, at least 400 million recoverable barrels of it,"" Mr. Turk added. Union Oil then faced a situation that nearly all oil companies have since confrontation in energy investments in developing countries. ""Finding energy is only the beginning,"" according to B. F. Miller, acting general manager of Union Oil's East Kalimantan operations. ""Getting the energy is another problem."" The Attaka field and subsequent finds at Kerindangan, Melahin, Yakin and Sepinggan on Kalimantan cost Union Oil more than $500 million in the first seven years, not for rigs but for basic installations and facitlities. ""The rigs are just like those in the Gulf of Mexico,"" said Eddy Darmawan, a Union Oil engineer. ""But we had to build a town, train workers, bring in the equipment. We had to start from scratch."" Union Oil spent $10 million building a twon for its workers on Pasir Ridge in Balikpapan, an 80-minute helicopter ride from Attaka.",1981-01-19T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Baker has had experience in Washington, and he has overcome whatever stigma ever attached to his having run George Bush's Republican primary campaign against Mr. Reagan.

But where would Hart have been without Richard Rodgers? Lyrics alone cannot carry a song; there must be music, too.

The illustrious examples of Baudelaire (writing on Delacroix) and Apollinaire (writing on the Cubists) are often cited. Within recent memory, the late Frank O'Hara wrote a great deal of art criticism (about the painting and sculpture of the New York School) in the 1950's when Art News magazine was edited by Thomas B. Hess. So did James Schuyler and Parker Tyler and Barbara Guest and numerous other writers of verse.

The second, ''Here Come the Tigers,'' was inspired, to put it mildly, by ''The Bad News Bears'' and starred his 8-year-old son, Noel. The third went through several title changes before ending up as ''Kick,'' but by any name at all it couldn't find a distributor. The total cost of the three, he said, came to under $1 million, which is one-fifth the budget of his ''A Stranger Is Watching,'' which will begin shooting in New York next month.",1981-01-23T05:00:00+0000

For much of the early years the board, under the direction of John Grierson, founder of the British documentary movement, dealt with propaganda, boosting and documenting virtually every aspect of Canada's World War II role. By the late 1950's, the Film Board was entering its golden decade, when it was a homespun mecca for many artistically inclined Canadians. In a 10-year flurry of activity, the board concentrated on animation and documentary, using its newly developed cameras and recording equipment to take viewers right into the midst of crowds.

Body line is taut, ending in boldly flexed or stabbing, nibbling feet. The pace is cool and deliberate, the attack forceful but circumscribed. When, at the end, the two dancers calmly manipulate each other's sitting bodies into neatly geometric forms, the effect is of almost dazzling physical intimacy.

While watching the Simon film, I'd been laughing from time to time but not really enjoying it. Most of the laughter at ''Nine to Five'' was prompted by hope that things would get better, which they didn't.

The question: Did the United States pay a ransom for the captives? Former President Carter, members of his Administration and a few Republicans such as Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, chairman of the Foreign Relations Commitee, defended the arrangement as the best way to return Iran's property while safeguarding American claims and interests. ''Iran has suffered severely,'' said Mr. Carter. ''Their attempts to extort money from us did not work.'' As the negotiations progressed, Iran had backed off steadily from earlier demands totaling $24 billiion. Former Vice President Mondale responded to angry demands to renounce the deal. ''We have had a tradition of 200 years in this nation of abiding by the civilized rules of international law,'' he said, ''and if they have resorted to barbarity, maybe it's a higher standard that we live by.''",1981-01-25T05:00:00+0000

''Of course,'' the reader says, folding the newspaper and looking for the crossword puzzle, ''what else are they going to say about the old girl (or old boy) at this point?''

COOKING IN CLOSE QUARTERS;
Nice as a big, fancy kitchen may be, it is not essential for turning out excellent meals. Leon Danielian's kitchens - past and present - are cases in point. For more than two decades, Mr.  Danielian toured the world, initially as the first American-trained premier danseur for Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and later as the guest star of the San Francisco Ballet. And when he traveled, he carried his own ''kitchen,'' a small, battered suitcase containing condiments and cooking gear - ''first Sterno, later an electric frying pan - the height of gypsy luxury,'' he says. Like many professional travelers, he learned that one can't trust restaurants in strange cities to serve the kind of food one wants when one wants it - like late at night after an evening performance. So Mr.  Danielian cooked up simple specialties for members of t","Now Mr. Danielian has come in from the road; he is a teacher at the New York Conservatory of Dance and, until last August, was the director of the American Ballet Theater School. But he can't seem to shake the aura of a traveler. His current kitchen, in a one-bedroom apartment near New York's Lincoln Center, is the Pullman type. Actually part of the living room, it is banked along one wall that also contains a stacked washer-dryer and storage space. (When not in use, all is concealed behind folding doors.) When he cooks for a crowd, he still hauls out a vinyl-topped ironing board to use as additional work space.

By dwelling on, and even embellishing, the ordeals of the artist's life, it diverts attention from the grave artistic labor that formed the central focus of his existence.

The orchestra's Laureate Conductor was just about as you remember him, only more so, full of beans and leaping about in the patented Bernstein manner. Whatever else he does, Mr. Bernstein provides a lively show. On this occasion, his cavorting happened to get in the way of the music as often as not. It was rarely possible to ignore his charismatic presence - by rhythmic bobbing and jerking he even managed to steal the show from Stanley Drucker during the soloist's cadenza in Aaron Copland's Concerto for Clarinet. Mr. Bernstein knows better than that, but he obviously was keyed up for his return to the Philharmonic.",1981-01-30T05:00:00+0000

Cigarette smoking has, of course, long been one of the theater's most powerful means of expression. Whenever an actor wanted to indicate nonchalance, nervousness, wisdom, ignorance, furtiveness, candor, depression or exhilaration, he elaborately lighted up. Similarly, if a director couldn't think of any other reason for having a character sit down, stand up, cross the stage or stand utterly still, he was again instructing the performer to fish out a pack, tap a cigarette out of it, insert it between his lips while continuing to talk, and then create additional dramatic excitement by waving the match in midair until it went out and by exhaling as spectacularly as possible.",1981-01-30T05:00:00+0000

This morning's session includes quilts, hooked rugs, scrimshaw, watercolors, carvings and weather vanes. The most important of these are a weather vane of an Indian poised to shoot a bow (estimated to bring as much as $18,000), a carved and painted wooden sea bird (up to $12,000) and a painted wooden eagle with spread wings, grasping a furled American flag (up to $15,000).

Notable, too, is a Philadelphia Chippendale highboy (up to $100,000), formerly in the collection of George Horace Lorimer, long-time editor of the Saturday Evening Post and a collector of American furniture. After Mr. Lorimer's death a decade ago, the highboy was donated to the North Museum of Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., which has consigned it to Sotheby's.
