The screenplay, by Abby Mann, based on ''The Survivor,'' an autobiographical book by Jack Eisner, is about children of the Warsaw ghetto who rose against the Nazis in 1943, and Mr. Mizrahi wanted the cast to come from one place, so moviegoers wouldn't be jarred by a variety of accents.

It's a vision brought alive again in ''Reginald Marsh's New York,'' a show of 38 paintings, drawings, prints and photographs from Marsh's prolific output, installed at the Whitney Museum's new outpost in the new Philip Morris building, 120 Park Avenue, at 42d Street.",1983-07-01T05:00:00+0000

After ''Turandot,'' which Puccini did not live to complete, Italian opera shows little sign of creative vitality. Some of the composers who followed Puccini, such as Franco Alfano, were extremely talented men of the theater. Some, such as Pizzetti, Casella, Malipiero and Respighi were international figures, respected by their colleagues and known to audiences. Alfano's stature in Italy was such that Toscanini chose him to complete the last act of ''Turandot,'' which was rather like being named ''most likely to succeed'' by your senior class.",1983-07-03T05:00:00+0000

Freshly harvested vegetables are always tastier and more nutritious than those purchased, assuming that they are harvested while they are in peak condition. Certain varieties are preferred to others by some gardeners. One can be better assured of having these varieties by growing them oneself. Then there is always satisfaction that comes with growing at least a portion of one's own food.",1983-07-03T05:00:00+0000

Howard Bray is a freelance writer in Washington.","LILLIAN SANTIAGO LEANED against the the grimy elevated platform in Long Island City as she awaited the subway to Manhattan. Feeling cheerless, she comforted herself for a moment by telling a new-found friend about the endless summer of her native Puerto Rico. Then the El arrived, as packed as always, and with it an end to her reverie and the start of another grueling day of job-hunting. A year ago, the slender, 27-year-old woman with two university degrees was a supervisor of social services for children and the elderly in San Juan. Then the island government -doubly battered by depression and deep cuts in Federal aid - fired thousands of public employees, Miss Santiago among them. Unable to find another comparable job, she gave up her apartment near the sea and headed north. And to stretch her savings after weeks without work, she took a part-time job as a clerk in a midtown variety store, receiving $3.35 an hour. Her self-esteem was at a low ebb until, months later, she found a public-school post as a bilingual teacher. ''It's better to live in your own country,'' she says.

J.W., Forest Hills, Queens Answer: Ellis S. Franke, executive director of the Conciliation and Appeals Board, said that when the board gets complaints that the hours of service employees have been cut, it determines if the cutback was significant and whether it had any impact on service delivery. She suggested that you file a buildingwide service complaint so the board can investigate. While it may not not direct the rehiring of a porter discharged eight years ago, she added, it may order the owner to provide better maintenance and repair service.

When it does enter into the gallery world and into photography history books (as it has in the case of Lewis Hine and W.

For example, in this session of the Legislature, the big issue was voir dire, the method in which we have lawyers select juries. It came to pass - and certainly Governor Cuomo supported the reform, but not to the point of trying to convince people that this was a cure-all for the system - that somehow if we changed the method of selecting juries our problems would vanish.

Proposals to allow judges, rather than lawyers, to question potential jurors and to establish a new verdict of ''guilty but mentally ill'' were defeated, and Governor Cuomo vetoed a measure that would have restored the death penalty. Mr. Cuomo has until next week to sign a bill creating a sentencing guidelines commission to set fixed jail terms for specific crimes. It would replace the current procedure in which judges specify a range of years and the parole board determines the actual release date. But what will it take to reform a system that has left the courts paralyzed, the prisons jammed and the streets unsafe?

You stop noticing the stunned pedestrians with blood trickling down their cheeks who happened to be standing on the street when the lethal Mercedes - the favorite choice of Beirut car bombers - suddenly turned into a ball of flame. You stop seeing the smoldering charred carcasses of the other automobiles engulfed in the blast or the chaos of the rescue workers as they scurry around on tiptoe between the shards of glass and twisted car parts to pry out the dead and wounded. Instead, after a while, you find your mind focusing on the incongruities: the juicy roast chickens that were blown all over the street from an adjacent restaurant but somehow still look good enough to eat, or the smell of liquor from a shelf full of broken Johnnie Walker bottles. And eventually, after seeing enough car bombs, you start to notice the leaves: When a car packed with 100 sticks of dynamite explodes on a crowded street, the force of the blast knocks all the leaves off the trees and the road is left choking with them like an autumn lawn. Red Cross workers still tell the story of the man they found at a car bombing near the Ministry of Information whose chest was blown open. They knew he was still alive because through the blood that filled his mouth, little air bubbles kept surfacing. The thing they remembered most, though, was that two leaves had come to rest gently on his face - one on each eye.",1983-07-17T05:00:00+0000

Proposals to allow judges, rather than lawyers, to question potential jurors and to establish a new verdict of ''guilty but mentally ill'' were defeated, and Governor Cuomo vetoed a measure that would have restored the death penalty.

us,HIGHER TARGETS SET ON MONEY GROWTH,"Paul Volcker had another surprise in his second round of Senate confirmation hearings - the Fed will ease up on its growth targets for the money supply for the rest of the year. Starting in July, the Fed will hold M-1 growth to a 5 to 9 percent range, up from a 4 to 8 percent target that has been in place since the beginning of the year. Moreover, the Fed will not try to offset the 14 percent growth rate in the money supply so far this year, but it will reinstitute the 8 percent upper limit in 1984. The move was seen as an effort to calm the shaky financial markets as well as to keep the recovery on track without letting it get out of hand. At the same time, the Fed chairman exhorted the Congressmen to reduce the huge budget deficits that he said were the ''most important single hazard to recovery.''",1983-07-24T05:00:00+0000

You do not know what it is; but you do not dare to say that you do not, because you understand that it is one of the things which every good American is bound to believe in. Now when any doctrine arrives at that degree of authority, the name of it is a club which any demagogue may swing over you at any time and apropos of anything. - From ''War,'' by William Graham Sumner, 1903. The ideologues and idealists who inspired that warning, from a noted conservative, are swinging their club again.

In the number of people killed at a single stroke, the bombing was the most terrible incident of racial violence during the peak years of the Southern civil-rights movement. In the mindlessness of its evil, the 16th Street bombing was also the most heinous act of the era. Even the murders of three civil-rights workers in Mississippi in 1964 and the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 had a rationale: The victims were participants in what they hoped, but did not fully expect, would be a nonviolent war. But Denise McNair, 11, and Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Addie Mae Collins, all 14, had not even been among the thousands of Birmingham students who flooded into the streets in May to join the famous ''children's crusade'' that Dr. King used to dramatize the brutality of the police tactics there.

According to Professor Cressman, to say that Franz Boas, Margaret Mead's professor at Columbia University, sent her to Samoa ''to gather information to support his idea of the greater importance of nurture over nature'' is utter nonsense. While this may be Professor Cressman's sincere conviction, the historical evidence shows him to be at error in his recollections. Boas, this evidence indicates, did have very strong views about the relative importance of ''hereditary and environmental conditions'' in the etiology of human behavior, maintaining (in his own words) that ''the social stimulus is infinitely more potent than the biological mechanism.'' Further, as Margaret Mead herself reported (in ''Blackberry Winter,'' 1972, page 126), Boas sent her to Samoa in 1925 to work on ''the adolescent girl, to test out, on the one hand, the extent to which the troubles of adolescence, called in German Sturm und Drang and Weltschmerz, depended upon the attitudes of a particular culture and, on the other hand, the extent to which they were inherent in the adolescent stage of psychobiological development.'' Boas, Mead also recorded, believed that her work in Samoa would show that culture was ''very important.''",1983-07-26T05:00:00+0000

What is most remarkable about it is that it is an evocation done, for the most part, with neither the literalness of Colonial Williamsburg nor the cuteness of Disneyland. This assemblage of several blocks' worth of shops, restaurants, cafes and exhibitions is made up as much of things that are new as of things that are old - and surprisingly, instead of breaking an illusion of 19th-century perfection, the new parts of this place make it all the richer and deeper an urban experience.",1983-07-29T05:00:00+0000

In his latest fiction, ''Worstward Ho,'' Beckett urges, ''Try again. Fail again. Fail better.'' From his point of view, the destination is unavoidable but the journey can be alleviated. For the past 25 years, since ''Krapp's Last Tape,'' he has been distilling his vision, bringing his theater and his fiction into closer proximity and writing plays for one or two voices, a speaker and a silent listener or sentinel. Often these are two aspects of one persona. In some of the plays we do not even see a whole man or woman: the incessantly moving lips of the woman in ''Not I''; the disembodied head surrrounded by a flaring corona of white hair in ''That Time.'' In others we glimpse an isolated figure in limbo: the daughter calculating her steps in ''Footfalls.''
