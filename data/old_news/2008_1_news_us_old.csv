The Hat vs. the Vest  L.S.U. Coach Les Miles is nicknamed the Hat because of the stiff brim he wears during games. Ohio State Coach Jim Tressel is known as the Vest because of his typical game-day sweater vest. Miles has become the known as the consummate sideline gambler, and Tressel is usually as conservative as his attire. But few will gives Miles the strategic edge here because Tressel has won too many big games by close margins.2. The Speed Factor  After Florida, like L.S.U. a team in the Southeastern Conference, routed Ohio State in last seasons title game, team speed was cited as a strong factor. That came into play especially with the Gators defensive front seven. Expect the speed factor as an advantage for L.S.U. to be discussed excessively leading up to the game.3. The Imperfect Quarterback  Plenty of observers are going to say that this Ohio State team is better than last seasons. Well, its not. The disparity at quarterback is enough of a reason, as the Buckeyes traded the Heisman Trophy winner, Troy Smith, for the immobile and not-so-accurate Todd Boeckman. L.S.U. has the solid-but-unspectacular Matt Flynn, which means that whichever quarterback makes the least mistakes will probably win.",2008-01-03T03:14:04+0000

us,The Adventures of Amir Hamza,"The florid news writers, the sweet-lipped historians, revivers of old tales and renewers of past legends, relate that there ruled at Ctesiphon in Persia (image of Heaven!) Emperor Qubad Kamran, who cherished his subjects and was a succor to the impecunious in their distress. He was unsurpassed in dispensing justice, and so rigorous in this exercise that the best justice appeared an injustice compared to his decree. Prosperity and affluence thrived in his dominions while wrong and inequity slumbered in death, and, rara avis-like, mendicants and the destitute were extinct in his lands. The wealthy were at a loss to find an object for their charity. The weak and the powerful were equals, and the hawk and the sparrow roosted in the same nest. The young and the old sought one another's pleasure, neither ever deeming himself the sole benefactor. The portals of houses remained open day and night like the eyes of the vigil, for if someone stole even the color of henna from the palm, he was ground in the mill of justice. The thief therefore did not even dream of thieving, and if perchance a wayfarer should come upon someone's property on the road, he took it upon himself to restore it to its owner. Compared with Qubad Kamran's fearlessness, might, and valor, Rustam was the same as a hag most decrepit and cowardly. ",2008-01-06T11:53:00+0000

The amateur athletic tournament, based on the early 1990s series, delivered the highest ratings among adults 18 to 49 of any new show this season on any network, matching the debut of Heroes in September 2006, Nielsen estimated. In total viewers, however, American Gladiators was less impressive, drawing an average of 12 million from 9 to 11 p.m. ABCs Cashmere Mafia, by comparison, which made its debut on Sunday at 10 p.m., attracted 10.7 million viewers but markedly lower ratings in the 18-to-49 set. Cashmere Mafia also benefited from a plum time slot following ABCs Desperate Housewives (19.8 million), the only show to outpace American Gladiators on the night among adults 18 to 49. ABC, NBC and CBS finished in a virtual tie for first in that demographic over all on Sunday. CBS, buoyed by an overrun of its afternoon football coverage during the 7 p.m. hour that was followed by one of the highest rated editions of 60 Minutes in recent years (19 million), won the race in total viewers.",2008-01-08T05:00:00+0000

A person involved in the negotiations said that Scribner paid Ms. Welch a price in the seven figures for world and audio rights to the book. Based on an article Ms. Welch wrote for O, the Oprah Magazine, in 2006, the book offers strategies for making decisions in which people think about what the consequences of a decision will be in 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years. Robert Barnett, a Washington lawyer, negotiated the deal on behalf of Ms. Welch. Nan Graham, editor in chief of Scribner, will edit the book with Samantha Martin. Ms. Welch, who wrote the best-selling Winning with Mr. Welch, said she originally thought there wasnt a book beyond the article. But, she said, I began to encounter this hunger for people who were using it to play out its nuances. She said the book would include examples from her own life as well as others she has observed using the 10-10-10 process. Susan Moldow, publisher of Scribner, said that although Ms. Welchs article might seem sufficient for those who wanted to know about the strategy, Ms. Moldow believed the book would sell well. The Scarsdale Diet fit on a Xerox-ed sheet that you could fit on the front of a refrigerator, Ms. Moldow said. And it sold millions and millions of copies.

us,Now Booking | Guadeloupe,"(Daniel Barillot/Masterfile)When I learned that an outpost of Barbuto  a stylish restaurant around the corner from my West Village apartment  had opened on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, I scratched my head. What was the chef Jonathan Waxman, known for his seasonal take on traditional Italian dishes, doing on an island that not only has no Italian connection but is also pretty well overlooked by Americans? Turns out the explanation is a fairly simple: when one of Barbutos partners, Phil Scotti, was visiting Guadeloupe, he happened to meet Valerie Robein, a well respected local restaurateur who was looking to open a new place, and hatched the idea to back her in a Caribbean-inflected version of Barbuto, with Robein helming the stove and Waxman developing the menu. While Barbuto Guadeloupes lasagna with conch or roast chicken with curry arent reason enough to make a trip, the restaurants opening got me thinking again about an island that is said to combine the typical Caribbean assets of sun and sand with what is, lets face it, a real rarity in the region: a vibrant food scene, and one that intriguingly blends both Creole and European influences. Guadeloupe is one of the few major islands I havent been to, but friends who have tell me the foods unusually good, from excellent morning pastries in the cafs to fresh grilled fish on the beach to more ambitious fare in the restaurants of Deshaies, the cute town where Barbuto is based. Whats more, although French tourists in high season do pack the coastal resorts of Grand-Terre, Guadeloupes eastern half, over on Basse-Terre you can supposedly still get some peace and quiet on the beach in January and February. Even in deepest darkest winter Im always discouraging my better half from planning Caribbean getaways, in large part because a week without great eating is not my idea of a vacation, but in 2008 I think Im voting for Guadeloupe. (For an overview of the island, and some hotel and restaurant advice, go here. Been to Guadeloupe? Let me know how you liked it here",2008-01-08T19:54:04+0000

Returning to Britain from Pakistan two weeks after his mothers death to resume his first-year studies at Oxford, he gave a battery of feisty answers to reporters who questioned the Pakistan Peoples Partys decision to pick him as his mothers successor as party chairman. To a reporter who suggested he had been appointed to the post like a piece of family furniture, he said he had not sought it, but added, It was recognized at this moment in crisis the party needed a close association with my mother through the bloodline. Asked if he feared for his life, he replied: How many Bhuttos can you kill? From every house a Bhutto will come. Noting that the party had selected his father, Asif Ali Zardari, as the partys co-chairman until he finishes his university degree, he said he would step gradually and carefully into politics. He renewed the familys demands for a United Nations inquiry into his mothers death and spoke out against American support for the generals who have ruled Pakistan for more than half its 60-year existence.

(Photo by Money Sharma/European Pressphoto Association)  Video  Tata Motors today took the covers off the world's cheapest car -- the Nano.  Over the past year, Tata has been building hype for a car that would cost a mere 100,000 rupees (roughly $2,500) and bring automotive transportation to the mainstream Indian population. It has been nicknamed the ""People's Car."" Over the course of the New Delhi Auto Expo, which began this week, anticipation had grown to fever pitch.  With the theme from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" playing, Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Motors drove the small white bubble car onto Tata's show stage, where it joined two others.  The Tata Nano could sell for around $2,500. (Photo by Raveendran/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images)  ""They are not concept cars, they are not prototypes,"" Mr. Tata announced when he got out of the car. ""They are the production cars that will roll out of the Singur plant later this year.""  The four-door Nano is a little over 10 feet long and nearly 5 feet wide. It is powered by a 623cc two-cylinder engine at the back of the car. With 33 horsepower, the Nano is capable of 65 miles an hour. Its four small wheels are at the absolute corners of the car to improve handling. There is a small trunk, big enough for a duffel bag.   ""Today, we indeed have a Peoples Car, which is affordable and yet built to meet safety requirements and emission norms, to be fuel efficient and low on emissions,"" Mr. Tata added. ""We are happy to present the Peoples Car to India and we hope it brings the joy, pride and utility of owning a car to many families who need personal mobility.  The base price for the Nano will be 120,000 rupees, including road tax and delivery. Higher level models will cost more and come with air-conditioning. Sun visors and radios are extra.  The nearest priced competitor is the Maruti 800, which costs roughly twice as much as the Nano. In comparing the Nano to the Maruti 800, Mr. Tata said, ""It is 8 percent smaller -- bumper to bumper -- and has 21 percent larger seating capacity than Maruti 800.""  The Hindustan Times reports reactions from a couple of Tata's competitors, Maruti and Hyundai:   Jagdish Khattar, a former head of Maruti 800 manufacturer Maruti Udyog Ltd., says it's too early to say whether the Nano will overtake the original.  ""It's a good product but it's still too early to say whether it will overtake the 800 because it caters to a totally new market segment,"" he said while watching a live telecast of Tata's press conference after unveiling of the Nano.  But clearly, at least one other manufacturer was worried.  An official of Hyundai Motors, which unveiled an LPG version of its Santro Thursday, was more circumspect.  ""We definitely see it as impacting our sales,"" he said in halting English, preferring to maintain anonymity.    Anand Mahindra, managing director for Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors' primary competitor, said before the unveiling, ""I think it's a moment of history and I'm delighted an Indian company is leading the way.""  The Nano will go on sale in India later this year with an initial production run of 250,000 a year. Tata says it will offer the Nano in other emerging markets in Latin America, Southeast Asia and Africa within four years.

To them the unarmed class appears vulgar and ignoble, laws are superfluous subtleties, the forms of social life just so many insupportable delays.Benjamin Constant, Swiss, 17671830But all was not right with the spirit of the men who came back. Something was wrong. They put on civilian clothes again, looked to their mothers and wives very much like the young men who had gone. . . . But they had not come back the same men. Something had altered in them. They were subject to queer moods, queer tempers, fits of profound depression alternating with a restless desire for pleasure. Many of them were easily moved to passion when they lost control of themselves. Many were bitter in their speech, violent in opinion, frightening. For some time while they drew their unemployment pensions, they did not make any effort to get work for the future. . . .

Although Terminator benefited from following a football game on Fox that attracted more than 35 million viewers during the 7 p.m. hour, no other scripted series debut on any broadcast network has done better in the 18-to-49 set in three years. The last scripted series debut on a broadcast network to earn higher ratings among adults 18 to 49 was CBSs Numb3rs on Jan. 23, 2005. Fox easily led the nights ratings, followed by CBS and ABC.

The reason was sharply higher fuel costs. Delta Air Lines raised its round-trip fares by $50 immediately after Uniteds move. American Airlines also posted $50 round-trip increases on 55 percent of its route system, though ""conspicuously absent"" are increases on its routes that overlap with many Southwest Airlines routes, said Rick Seaney, the chief executive of FareCompare.com. Then on Monday, Northwest Airlines also joined in the $50 increase on most of its routes. Continental Airlines, which initially raised fares by $50 on some routes on Friday, withdrew the increases Monday morning, but Mr. Seaney said it was unclear whether Continental might reverse course again soon. This was the second broad fare increase in 2008, and the 10th since last Labor Day, Mr. Seaney said, adding: ""It seems the legacy airlines, United in particular, are forgoing the nickel-and-dime strategy of increases every few weeks and are going for the whole enchilada at one time.""",2008-01-15T05:00:00+0000

The show doesn't make a lot of fuss over the notion of a woman commander in chief (in fact, in an aside we learn that Lisa is ""the first straight woman president."") But it's impossible not to notice that President Simpson looks a lot like Hillary Clinton: her spiky hairdo has been smooshed down into a power-helmet; she wears monochrome pants suits and a string of pearls. She is intelligent and earnest, and she has a problem with authenticity. Bart, who has grown into a middle-aged slacker with a ponytail, ends up playing Bill to Lisa's Hillary; he saves the day by smooth-talking a mob of angry world leaders who have converged on the White House. At one point he says, ""I coulda been president, but I'm too real.""",2008-01-15T12:50:00+0000

Nielsen estimated that Deal or No Deal delivered the largest audience overall, 15 million viewers at 9 p.m., while American Gladiators at 8 drew a less impressive 10.7 million viewers. Among adults 18 to 49, however, the two shows outpaced all other programming on the night, including Foxs Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles at 9 p.m. That show, which made its premiere on Sunday to 18.4 million viewers, declined in the ratings substantially with its second showing, attracting just 10.1 million while matching the 10 p.m. leader, CBSs CSI: Miami (14.7 million), for the third highest ratings on the night among the 18-to-49 set. Fox ranked second for the night in that demographic but third in total viewers behind both NBC and CBS, which broadcast repeats of its comedy lineup from 8 to 10. ABC was fourth over all, faring better earlier in the night with Dance War from 8 to 9:30 (10.5 million) but struggling later on with Notes From the Underbelly at 9:30 (4.8 million) and October Road at 10 (4.9 million).",2008-01-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Rocco Landesman Answers Your Broadway Questions,"We recently solicited your questions for Broadway producer Rocco Landesman, and threw in a few of our own as well. Reading his answers below, you can see why he is considered not only one of Broadway's best producers, but also one of the most astute. Thanks to Rocco, and to all of you for the questions.  Q: What will Broadway look like in 20 years?   A: This is a live, hand-made industry where the product is created new and live each night, just as it was 50 years ago. As such, in twenty years, it should look much as it does now -- except that Nathan Lane will look notably older.   Q: What factors contribute to the high price of Broadway tickets? Theater rents? Union salaries? Audience expectations of an onstage spectacle? Are these costs increasing? Do rising costs lead to less risk-taking and more middle-of-the-road, lowest-common-denominator fare on Broadway?   A: The issue in our business is that we lack both an economy of scale and mechanization. We can't make a million, or even a thousand copies of the same movie. As I wrote earlier, the product is handmade and repeated live each night. The sets and costumes are custom made. The actors have to be live. It is labor intensive to the Nth degree, and as those costs rise, so do ticket prices. There is really no productivity gain through the technology boom. Actors and stagehands keep getting more money, and the costs of marketing a show seem to keep going up exponentially. Then, of course, the higher the cost, the more risk averse the producer and investors become. So yes, there is inevitably some decline in venturesomeness. Better to stick with the tried and true, or the show with the widest possible audience.   Q: What's the current trend in Broadway attendance? Why do people still go to the theater when it's so much more expensive than other forms of entertainment?   A: Broadway attendance has been trending up. Attendance by New Yorkers has leveled off, but that has been more than made up for by tourists, both American and international. There are many more competing forms of entertainment, but there's really no replacement for a live experience. It is really not replicable through any technology or alternate form of delivery.   Q: Tell us about the economics of hiring a star for a Broadway show versus a non-star. As much as stars draw box office, they also spike the budget and, I assume, limit a potentially long run. Is it worth it?   A: Some shows, especially plays, need a star in order to sell tickets. Of course, from the producers' standpoint, it's best when the show is the star. The Producers ran for more than three years after the departure of Lane and Matthew Broderick.   Q: Where do Broadway audiences come from (geographically)? What's a surprising place that a lot of customers come from?   A: In general terms, the audience for plays is from New York and for musicals, after the first year or so, from outside New York. Which is one reason why musicals usually run much longer than plays.   Q: Assuming that the vast majority of Broadway customers come from out of town, why is there so much Broadway advertising in New York City  on buses, e.g.?   A: Because purchase decisions are often made after the customers arrive. And it would be impossible to advertise in 300 cities.   Q: What's the state of Broadway ticket scalping, and what's your position on it?   A: The problem for years has been that the only people who really score with a hit show have been the scalpers. When we instituted the $400 ticket for The Producers, we started to address this problem. In the new system, the price is printed on the ticket, and the money actually goes to the people responsible for the show -- the investors, the creative team, etc. -- instead of to the ticket brokers. We are in favor of a free market system where the market ultimately sets the price on premium tickets.   Q: You were the first producer to charge $100 for a single ticket, for The Producers. What was the impact and response?   A: It had no effect whatsoever on demand. We could have sold all the tickets we could print.   Q: How true to life is The Producers?   Max Bialystock was based on a real life producer that Mel Brooks knew personally. Current producers are not all crooks -- at least, most of them aren't.   Q: So much of Broadway seems to be derived from movies today (partly thanks to The Producers, which has done it better than anyone before or since). Is this a healthy trend? More broadly, will people still produce original plays and musicals in 5 or 10 years, or will originality be left to off- and off-off-Broadway? What message should playwrights take from this trend?   A: The creators of musicals are always looking for stories. Once upon a time, the stories were found in short stories, novels, plays, and other literary sources. Now, many of the stories are in movies. This is a natural and healthy migration, and the actual process [of creating Broadway shows] hasn't changed.   Q: It seems that in the last few years, there have been a number of shows that exist primarily to showcase the music of one particular artist or band (e.g., Billy Joel, ABBA, Elvis). Is this a trend for the future as well? Should we expect to see ""Madonna: The Musical"" in the next five to ten years?   A: I truly hope not. But the success of Jersey Boys will probably extend the cycle of so-called jukebox musicals. Usually, if I like the music, I will like the musical, but there has been a wide spectrum of quality in these shows. Compare Good Vibrations with Smokey Joe's Cafe or Jersey Boys.   Q: How well do these so-called jukebox musicals do when measured against traditional musicals?   A: Smokey Joe's Cafe was the longest running review in history. I expect it will be surpassed by Jersey Boys. Generally, these shows are more successful financially because their costs are much lower. The casts are usually smaller and they don't depend on stars or expensive scenery.   Q: If Jujamcyn scores a big advance sale, how do you invest the money?   A: In certificates of deposit.   Q: If you weren't a successful producer and had nothing to do with the entertainment industry, and you had a daughter in high school, would you encourage her to pursue a career on Broadway?   A: I once asked my wife how she would feel if one of our three sons turned out to be gay. She thought for a while, and answered that she didn't think she'd have a problem with it, but she would be upset if one of them decided to become an actor. It is a very tough life, one in which you have little control over your own career.   Q: What benchmarks do you use to judge the success of a show?   A: Critical response and financial reward.   Q: Do you lose more sleep when you first started producing than you do now?   A: Yes. At first, everything was life and death, because that's true at the beginning of a career. My whole career stems from the success of my first show, Big River. After you've had a few hits, everything is not at stake with each show. So I still worry, but I don't lose sleep.  Q: When were you a professional gambler? What kind of gambling did you do?  A: Horse racing. I never bet in casinos.   Q: Do you feel that Broadway is better off after going through a ""Disneyfication""?   A: I don't accept the term ""Disneyfication."" They are producers like everyone else, with their own taste and point of view. The more the merrier.   Q: How do you ""break in"" as a director or performer? How do you then balance family, children, auditions, rehearsals, etc.?   A: I can't really help on this one. It's very hard, and you have to be incredibly determined -- to be incapable of not doing it. There is no real work/life balancing -- the profession tends to be all-consuming.  Q: How is your relationship with your backstage crew post-strike, and how much do you rely on them?   A: Our stagehands are highly skilled, which is why we never tried to run shows without them during the strike. My relationships -- in many cases, friendships -- with the stagehands I work with was good before the strike, and continues to be good after it. We each did what we felt we had to do.   Q: What is Jerzy Kosinski doing?  A: You'll have to ask God. Or maybe the other guy.   Q: What was the purpose behind the $20 million strike fund that the producers have been accumulating over the last 4 years? Presumably, it was established to keep the shows running during a strike -- which didn't happen.   A: If all of the producers' requests had been granted during the IATSE negotiations, resulting in lowering expenses for the producers, would ticket prices have been reduced? They would have stabilized. That in itself is progress. ",2008-01-18T17:00:21+0000

us,Why Caucus at All?," People who have been close to political campaigns will tell you that the spouse always takes things more personally than the candidate; its just easier to be attacked yourself than it is to watch the person you love get hurt.

Of course, Clinton is a persuasive man, but his tirade would have been more convincing had anyone in the Clinton camp complained about Nevadas system before the powerful culinary unions endorsed Barack Obama. And that probably explains why a judge in Nevada ruled Thursday that the caucuses should go on as planned. (Clintons opposition to the plan would also have been more credible, by the way, had Hillary Rodham Clinton herself not noted, after the Iowa caucuses, that a lot of Iowas shift workers hadnt been able to take part. Fair enough, but can you really advocate helping workers caucus in Iowa, where you think they would have voted for you, and then argue against exactly that in Nevada, where you fear they might not?)",2008-01-18T21:03:52+0000

They scorn it, and so does Junya, now showing the coat with ties and shirts that are so glossy and colorful as to perhaps tempt the militant boys into an establishment uniform.

The Yankees are likely to settle with Bruney before a hearing. They believe their offer to Wang is fair, but a settlement seems possible because the figures are not far apart. Cans case is trickier, since the salary he is seeking would be higher than the $4.5 million earned by Justin Morneau of the Twins last season, after Morneau had won the Most Valuable Player award.

Now its reality-check time. After early contests in friendlier territories, the nomination fight moves this week into the heart of the Old South, where the inspiring story line of a woman dueling with an African-American will collide, at last, with another side of history.

The books reviews were essentially positive, with one notable exception: Mary McCarthys scorched-earth put-down in The New York Review of Books.

And thats a friendly passage.) McCarthys 7,000-word review didnt stop the book from selling; it remained on the hardcover list for 36 weeks, and Halberstam sold the paperback rights for $700,000.

By the time President Bush nominated him to run the Federal Reserve, at the end of 2005, Bernanke knew more about central banking than any economist alive. On virtually every topic of significance  how to prevent deflationary panics, for instance, or to gauge the effect of Fed moves on stock-market prices  Bernanke wrote one of the seminal papers. He championed ideas for improving communications between the Fed  whose previous chairman, Alan Greenspan, spoke in riddles  and the public, believing that clearer guidance about the Feds aims would help the economy run more smoothly. And having devoted much of his career to studying the causes of the Great Depression, Bernanke was the academic expert on how to prevent financial crises from spinning out of control and threatening the general economy. One line from his Essays on the Great Depression sounds especially prescient today: To the extent that bank panics interfere with normal flows of credit, they may affect the performance of the real economy.",2008-01-20T05:00:00+0000

The procedure takes several minutes. There is little blood involved. Afterward, the girls genital area is swabbed with the antiseptic Betadine. She is then helped back into her underwear and returned to a waiting area, where shes given a small, celebratory gift  some fruit or a donated piece of clothing  and offered a cup of milk for refreshment. She has now joined a quiet majority in Indonesia, where, according to a 2003 study by the Population Council, an international research group, 96 percent of families surveyed reported that their daughters had undergone some form of circumcision by the time they reached 14.

Those who did make it inside underwent further taxonomy: A hierarchy of wrist bands told them where they could and could not go. For the wired but unwashed who made it in to the main mosh, 50s imperative that they put their hands in the air was met with compliance, in part because there was no where else to put them. Servers had to be flanked front and back by burly security guys with winking flashlights to make their way. Smoke from tobacco and other products filled the place while toes were crushed and egos were in conflict. I would not have given that wrist band to you if I had known you were going to be such a jerk about it, shouted one guy to another. Six cameras panned live shots, feeding back to the crowd what they already knew. They were there, they saw the thing, they had juice. Whats up, Park City? 50 Cent shouted. Only you man, only you.

Wallace asked several questions about the initiative, but four minutes into the interview also brought up criticisms of the Clinton administrations counterterrorism policies that had been aired in Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Lawrence Wrights history of Al Qaeda, The Looming Tower. Whereupon Clinton went  ballistic. His face turned red. His voice rose. He tore into Wallace, accusing the veteran journalist, who over the decades has worked for several mainstream networks and whose credibility seldom has been questioned, of being a right-wing shill. He claimed the neocons who now say he did too little to capture or kill Osama bin Laden had in fact during the 1990s been highly critical of his administrations emphasis on counterterrorism, that they thought I was too obsessed with bin Laden and had no meetings on bin Laden for nine months after I left office.

Though Amy Winehouse, the troubled British singer, sang, They tried to make me go to rehab/I said no, no, no, on her breakthrough hit last year, she has assented to the idea and entered a rehabilitation clinic in the wake of a recently surfaced video that appears to depict her smoking crack. In a statement Thursday her British publicist said Ms. Winehouse, right, has come to understand that she requires specialist treatment to continue her ongoing recovery from drug addiction and prepare for her planned appearance at the Grammy Awards on Feb. 10 in Los Angeles, where she is up for six awards, and is the only nominee to be considered in all four marquee categories. But the statement also said she had canceled a planned appearance at the NRJ Music Awards in Cannes, France, on Saturday, the latest in a string of events she has scratched from her schedule amid her own legal troubles and those of her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, who is in jail for perverting the cause of justice after a pub brawl. Ms. Winehouses appearance on the Grammy show is still seen as a long shot, not only because of uncertainty about her ability to perform but also because of doubts about her effort to secure a visa to travel to the United States given an arrest for marijuana possession in Norway in October. But the publicist, Chris Goodman, said, If shes well enough to do it, she certainly wants to do it. He added that in terms of her recovery, What better incentive than six nominations? The latest blow to what had seemed a rising career came in the form of a grainy video posted on the Web site of the British tabloid The Sun. In the clip Ms. Winehouse is seen lighting a glass pipe and smoking what The Sun reported is crack cocaine. A copy of the video on YouTube has been viewed more than 800,000 times, according to the Web site. In an interview after the video had surfaced, Neil Portnow, the president of the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, which organizes the Grammy Awards, left open the possibility that Ms. Winehouse might yet manage to appear. Mr. Portnow said her representatives had notified the academy that they still are working on all of the possibilities of making this happen, and we want to give them an opportunity to work on that.

Eventually, Mr. Hermesh said, he removed Frank to prevent further damage but offered to put it up again elsewhere.

The lawsuit, filed Wednesday on behalf of John Doe in Los Angeles County Superior Court, seeks an injunction to prevent the agency from ever testing the B sample. The agency originally planned to test the B sample Jan. 15, the lawsuit says, but after the plaintiffs lawyers demanded the agency scrap that test, the agency canceled it.The lawsuit calls for a jury trial and seeks to recoup damages the plaintiff claims were incurred when the antidoping agency revealed the case to race organizers and the U.C.L.A. testing lab.The plaintiffs name is redacted in the 25-page lawsuit, but the cyclists lawyers are Maurice Suh and Howard Jacobs, the same team that represents Floyd Landis in his doping case.Landis told The Associated Press he was not the plaintiff.

Lueck finds. The netting proved a lifesaver last week, when a construction worker fell from the 42nd floor of the Trump SoHo, a condominium hotel being built at Varick and Spring Streets, and was snared by a net that protruded 10 feet from the side of the building about two floors below where he was working. He was then lowered to the ground safely. But for another worker, who also fell from the 42nd floor, a similar net proved useless. For reasons that remain under investigation, he fell to the ground and died. For developers, contractors and construction workers, the accident in SoHo on Jan. 15 has raised questions about whether the citys requirement for safety netting, which has generally been applauded, goes far enough.",2008-01-25T14:16:37+0000

In December, following a long gestation and much anticipation, the company finally soft opened its second property in the country, Rosewood Mayakob on the Riviera Maya; the resorts official, full-scale launch is next week. Rosewood is the second company to open in the big mixed-use residential-hotel-golf community north of Playa del Carmen called Mayakob. (Fairmont was the first, and a Viceroy and Banyan Tree are slated to open later this year.) Though we havent yet booked ourselves in, early reports suggest the new Rosewood is a winner. Of the 128 suites  all done in a stylish, pared-down style using local limestone and woods from renewable sources  the 16 on the beach are obviously prime real estate, though the remainder, arranged along a network of lagoons that wend their way through mangrove forest, provide a novel take on the typical Mexican resort experience: each has its own dock, and guests are transported around the property via silent boats (silent, to avoid disturbing the wildlife). All rooms have a private plunge pool, and theres a staff of 40 butlers to take care of your needs. The nice thing about the Riviera Maya in general, of course, is that theres more to do than just loll on the beach  youve got Mayan ruins at Tulum; some decent shopping, restaurants and bars in Playa del Carmen and coral reef for diving and snorkeling offshore  but looking at the images from Rosewood, we think it might be hard to tear yourself away.",2008-01-25T18:05:43+0000

His ennui is almost French in its intensity: He felt weak at the thought of reading another story about vampires having sex with other vampires. He tried to struggle through Lovecraft pastiches, but at the first painfully serious reference to the Elder Gods, he felt some important part of him going numb inside, the way a foot or a hand will go to sleep when the circulation is cut off.

Beinart (pictured at right), a columnist at Time magazine and The Washington Post, urges Democrats to prepare for the future by remembering the past  the heyday of cold-war liberalism during the 1940s. He urges a foreign policy based on humility, restraint and generous foreign aid to fragile democracies, as well as domestic policies that embody the humane values we promote abroad. Beinart writes clearly and concisely, with a pellucid intelligence, our reviewer, Joe Klein, said. The political scientist Thomas F. Schallers advice to the Democrats focuses on tactics. In WHISTLING PAST DIXIE: How Democrats Can Win Without the South (Simon & Schuster, $15), he argues that the party should let go of their electoral past and begin building a non-Southern majority coalition by solidifying the coastal states and the Midwest and reaching out to the Southwest. The recipient of Beinarts and Schallers advice may be Hillary Clinton. In A WOMAN IN CHARGE: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton (Vintage, $15.95), Carl Bernstein, who helped break the Watergate story, surveys Clintons career. Bernstein has written a serious, energetically researched and largely fluent book, Michiko Kakutani said in The Times, often sympathetic toward the former first lady as an individual ... just as often critical of judgment calls shes made on both policy and politics.",2008-01-27T05:00:00+0000

The autobiography of a man with locked-in syndrome, a rare form of stroke that paralyzes the body while the mind remains intact and vital, Baubys memoir, which was published in 1997, having been painstakingly dictated by a blink of his left eye when the correct letter of the alphabet was read aloud, is a glimpse into the other side of consciousness. It is a surprisingly ebullient, liberated view of a man approaching what would seem to be a terrible fate. When Schnabel eventually read the book  it was pushed on him by the performance artist Laurie Anderson when she was staying at his house in Montauk and she grabbed it from the stacks  he began to see the cinematic possibilities, the ways in which reality could be blurred with memories and dreams. Schnabels two other films, Basquiat and Before Night Falls, were both about artists and the ambitions that can thwart the creative process.

us,Il Miglior Fabbro,"T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound were the Odd Couple of 20th-century poetry, a most unlikely pair who between them rewrote the rules for everyone else. Eliot was Felix, of course: fussy, clerkish, conservative in both politics and religion, so somber that as a young man he sometimes dabbed his face with powder to make himself look even grayer. And Pound was Oscar: a yapper, provocateur and shameless self-promoter with a radical opinion on just about anything; he signed his name with a caricature of a gadfly and strode about London in the years before World War I wearing an earring, a sombrero and trousers made of green billiard cloth. From our perspective, almost a hundred years later, its hard to imagine that these two ever sat in the same room, let alone shared meals, friends, manuscripts. Eliot is now an almost churchly figure in our cultural imagination, the prelate of modernism, while Pound, if we bother to think of him at all, is remembered mostly as an embarrassment  a crank, a Fascist and anti-Semite confined to an asylum.

His sensational trial inspired the Theodore Dreiser novel An American Tragedy, the 1951 film A Place in the Sun and an opera staged by the Metropolitan Opera. Now, as the 100th anniversary of Gillettes electrocution approaches, Hamilton College has published The Prison Diary and Letters of Chester Gillette, taken from papers donated to the college last year by Gillettes grandniece, Marlynn McWade-Murray, The Associated Press reported. The editors, Jack Sherman and Craig Brandon, said Gillettes writings offer neither an explicit admission of guilt nor any clear assertion of innocence, but they do provide a window into his character and his metamorphosis in prison from a blithe youth into an introspective, compassionate, religious adult. In the penultimate entry in the diary, Gillette wrote: In all that I have done, I hope I have done as men would have me do.

In 2005, Ford was a guest on the National Public Radio program The Connection, for a series called The Book That Changed My Life. The book Ford chose to talk about was indeed The Moviegoer. It was a fine discussion. Ford views the books dynamic as a renewing experience and Binx as a hero headed toward the light and trying to find a vocabulary for affirmation, trying to find the institutions in life that will let him like life better and be better at it. It intrigues me that Ford never mentions religion as a force in the novel. This despite the fact that the exchange features a cameo call-in by Linda, evidently Linda Whitney Hobson, who wrote an accessible little book, Understanding Walker Percy, in which Percys Christianity is the single most important critical thread.

Europe buys about 25 percent of its gas from Gazprom, and about 25 percent of it is shipped through Ukraine.

The suit, filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, centers on complex terms in Mr. Wolfs contract. NBC argues that Mr. Wolf, right, is misinterpreting them to demand millions of dollars in executive-producer fees for two years after his shows leave the air. NBCs interpretation is that if the network produces a sufficient number of episodes it can fulfill the contract and not owe Mr. Wolf for work he is no longer doing. Mr. Wolfs side contends that the contract guarantees the money as a kind of termination payment, or kill fee. No matter when NBC decides to end his series, Mr. Wolf argues, he is to be paid for 48 more episodes. NBC asks that if the court finds the contract language ambiguous, it direct that the errors be fixed rather than force NBC to pay the money. A representative of Mr. Wolf, who like other Hollywood writers is on strike, said he was traveling on Tuesday and could not be reached. But Mr. Wolf issued a statement last week saying: NBC Universal is trying to rewrite an existing contract.

Now that I have that locked up, I can go do battle elsewhere.Instead, hubris and strategic miscalculations plagued his campaign, political observers say. For one, he allowed a tight coterie of New York aides, none with national political experience, to run much of his campaign. And while he accumulated a fat war chest  he had $16.6 million on hand at the end of September, more than Mitt Romney ($9.5 million) or Senator John McCain ($3.2 million)  he spent vast sums on direct mail instead of building strong organizations on the ground in South Carolina and New Hampshire.",2008-01-30T14:06:53+0000

But the truth is that especially in Percys part of the world, those sorts of women do waft in and out of casual conversation in just such a way. Its another spot-on detail he gets exactly right. In my youth, women were forever collecting the equivalent of iron deer, or auditioning and being discovered and going off to Biloxi or maybe even New York or Busch Gardens. They certainly did  and do  a fair share of going off to Natchez, of checking in and out of nuthouses, and all such activities were usually reported or repeated at the dinner table. Percy and his brothers believed that their own mothers accident was likely no such thing, that, despite the fact that youngest brother Phin was in the car with her, she drove off the road intentionally.

us,The Day After," Were at that stage of a campaign now where once serious contenders for the nominations of their parties are forced to cancel events and huddle with their families, to make those difficult calls to friends and supporters who already knew it was coming, to direct their own final scenes on the national stage. It is, in a sense, like planning your own funeral, and Im sure it feels that way, or at least for a while. I can remember sitting with Bill Bradley in his bare campaign office just after his withdrawal speech in 2000. Everyone was already gone except for a few loyal staff members and the last two Secret Service agents guarding the door. All the noise from all the rallies had subsided, and all that remained were a few empty cubicles and the occasional unanswered phone. I will never forget how one of the agents, checking his watch, offered the candidate a ride home before the final shift came to an end. Its not just the candidate, though, who suffers the trauma. For all the people who work on a campaign, who share cramped apartments with other true believers and keep most of their belongings in a car, the end really does feel like The End. I stood in the Ohio headquarters of America Coming Together, the massive Democratic voter turnout operation, as John Kerry and John Edwards gave their concession speech the day after the 2004 election. A smart young organizer was weeping on her bosss shoulder. I knew that if she lived to be 90, no matter what else she did or how successfully, the memory of that moment would probably still feel like a kick in the gut.",2008-01-31T19:09:59+0000
