As a Republican running for re-election in 1997, Mayor Giuliani had balked at the demand for performance audits by Mr. McCall, a Democrat. The Mayor labeled the requests for extra data as ''partisan'' and gave Mr. McCall access only to financial records of the city.",1999-04-03T05:00:00+0000

There's the midnight boarding of a Spanish warship, the sneak raid of Hornblower's lone ship on a French port and the his mates from their captors in France.

Sure!,"Rather than claiming to have constructed a definitive history of performance art, RoseLee Goldberg acts like a diligent film editor or museum curator to assemble PERFORMANCE: Live Art Since 1960 (Abrams, $60), a collection of photographs of performance art. There are shots of Marina Abramovic weeping as she scrubs cow bones and Yasumasa Morimura striking a pose as Scarlett O'Hara. While such images may be difficult to comprehend, much less to form into a coherent narrative, Goldberg does isolate what the works of this genre -- inspired by everything from classical theater to digital animation -- share: origins in a world on the verge of information overload, a world more and more coming to resemble an outlandish theatrical event, a world devoid of stable definitions. And although she has divided the images into such ostensibly tidy categories as ''The Body'' and ''Identities,'' Goldberg ultimately refrains from defining these inherently unclassifiable works; she seldom goes beyond asserting that an artist's works ''have an underlying social commentary'' or put forth a ''sophisticated take on American society.'' Goldberg in fact works much like a performance artist, allowing the images to speak for themselves. ''Performance,'' accordingly, mimics the culture that informs them; readers are barraged with data and are subjected to a parade of fragmented images in the place of real, firsthand experience. In the end, Goldberg's self-conscious, anticritical stance is admirably respectful to the spirit of performance, but one wishes she had not forfeited eloquence to make her point.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; The Internal Combustion Novel,"''All of my fingers have been broken from being stomped on,'' says T-Bird Murphy, the teen-age narrator of Eric Miles Williamson's first novel, EAST BAY GREASE (Picador USA, $23). ''My head's been knocked so many times, I wouldn't be surprised if I was permanently stupid.'' Set in Oakland during the 1960's and 1970's, this novel is a lively -- not to say wrenching -- contribution to a seldom recognized genre: the Internal Combustion Novel. As in Harry Crews's ''Car'' and Joseph Torra's more mystical ''Gas Station,'' the hero of ''East Bay Grease'' spends his days in an environment that's so filthy nothing can ennoble it. T-Bird may be the best trumpeter in the Jack London High School band and a pretty smart kid despite all the hard knocks he's taken, but it would take a miracle to get him out of the asphalt hell he inhabits along with his mother, a bikers' moll, and his father, an auto mechanic and a savage rube. Only in the sour air of the dockside bars, in punishing work and in music does he find relief. Williamson so convincingly depicts the cruelty of some of his characters that he seems almost scared of them. The feeling is contagious. Yet when T-Bird is finally ready for his shining moment soloing with Los Asesinos, a Mexican-American band as brilliant as it is tough, Williamson's writing becomes transcendent. His prose cuts loose in torrid rhythms that evoke the peril and exuberance of jazz. Sally Eckhoff",1999-04-04T05:00:00+0000

She was an award winning photographer; one of her photos hung at the 1963-1964 New York World's Fair. Roly travelled widely: she caught a trophy tuna in Nova Scotia, helped Milo photograph the East African Plains wildlife, investigated the pyramids of Mexico and Egypt, explored Europe, the Near and Far East, North and South America, Micronesia and Australia. Roly volunteered throughout her life: from the Women's Auxiliary Armed Forces to Civil Defense and as secretary for the Roslyn Visiting Nurse Association 27 years, as a Friend of the Zoo Docent for 28 years, in her local Vassar Club, as well as for the Boy and Girl Scouts. She loved completing The New York Times and London Times crossword puzzles, playing a vigorous hand of bridge and stimulating, scintillating conversations in several languages. Roly was a student of life, wife, mother to John, Thomas and Helen and beloved grandmother of David, Brian and Elizabeth. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave at 81 St, Wednesday 2-5 & 7-9pm with services Thursday 11:30am.

These sleek modern garbage cans, designed by the architecture firm Cooper Robertson & Partners, are replacing 600 corroding ones south of City Hall. Each one costs $500, and local businesses are being asked to ''adopt'' -- that is, pay for -- them. The waste bins are part of a program called the Downtown New York Streetscape Plan, which aims to give lower Manhattan a ''much needed face lift, transforming it into a lively and dynamic 24-hour, seven-day-a-week community,'' said Valerie Lewis, a spokeswoman for the alliance, which manages the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Business Improvement District. ''We wanted a trash basket that easily seconds as a work of art,'' Ms. Lewis said. ''We think these modern and stylish new baskets meet the challenge.'' What else is planned? New street names and signs in the first year of the program, followed by reconstruction of lower Broadway in the next five years, including new sidewalks, granite curbs, street and pedestrian lights, building facade lighting and seasonal plantings.",1999-04-11T05:00:00+0000

But now at restaurants around town, that liquor made from distilled cactus goo has become as upscale as Bordeaux, or single-malt Scotch. Tequila menus have been turning up at places like Pablo's, 1584 Second Avenue (82d Street), which offers 43 varieties. Cafe Frida, a month-old Mexican restaurant at 368 Columbus Avenue (77th Street), sells 25 tequilas, including a house brand of mescal (unrefined tequila with a worm at the bottom) from Oaxaca, and has just started tequila tastings. Most brands are not downed with salt, but sipped like grappa. At L-Ray, which opened last fall at 64 West 10th Street, there are 33 varieties of tequila, smooth, silky and expensive. Shots range from $6.50 for Sauza Hornitos or Monte Alban to a staggering $50 for Herradura Seleccion Suprema. Gerad Argeros, a bartender at L-Ray, said patrons sometimes scoff at $50 shots, only to end up ordering them after a few rounds. ''One night, these guys ordered six shots of the $50 tequila,'' he said. ''But I don't think they could really appreciate it. By that point, they were speaking pidgin Mexican.''

The center of gravity of the poems in HANDWRITING (Knopf, $22) is not in the language -- which is generally direct and unpatterned, proceeding in curt lines and stanzas -- so much as in the richly sensual images, which are drawn largely from the history, mythology and landscape of India and China. Ondaatje uses the serene juxtapositions of haiku (''This year's kisses / like diving a hundred times / from a moving train / into the harbour'') or the directness of a catalogue (''Palanquins carried the weapons of a goddess. / Bamboo tubes cut in 17th-century Japan / we used as poem holders'') to eliminate the need for explanation and exposition, leaving us with the things themselves. Even when telling a story -- as in ''Buried,'' which recounts the history of a Buddha statue buried for safekeeping during a war -- he contracts the narrative to a few concrete images, giving his verse a mysterious reticence. And the erotic strain in the book -- always below the surface of its lush descriptions -- bursts into full bloom in the sequence ''The Nine Sentiments'': ''Walking through rainstorms to a tryst, /",1999-04-11T05:00:00+0000

He was the cosseted youngest child of an eccentric and prosperous family of inventors. Lartigue's one regret, the critic Vicki Goldberg writes in JACQUES HENRI LARTIGUE, PHOTOGRAPHER (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $95) was that he couldn't remain forever a child. When he did finally grow up, he was absent-minded, charmingly impractical and oblivious of earthly problems. His fanciful photographs, which he began taking at the age of 6, were equally devoid of darkness. Filled with antics and inventions, fashion and coquetry (Lartigue was also arguably the first fashion photographer), wind, sun and flying machines, they captured the end of the belle epoque in all its whimsy and privilege. He was fascinated by speed and the suspension of time and gravity. Whether it was a car careering around a curve, a man prankishly leapfrogging over a cafe chair or a high diver on his descent, Lartigue was intent on ensnaring action in midair. Often his photographs were purposely unbalanced. He strove to catch the tentative and unstable -- the vertiginous tilt of a glider landing on a grassy field or a spread-eagled cat frozen in midair while batting a ball. ''Jacques Henri Lartigue, Photographer'' is beautiful: the black-and-white prints have been gorgeously reproduced, giving this volume more the feel of a portfolio than a book. Goldberg's comments are illuminating. But most of all, she lets these exuberant images speak for themselves. Andrea Barnet",1999-04-11T05:00:00+0000

Dr. Whittam, President and CEO of the San Francisco based Shaklee Companies, died April 15, 1999, at Stanford University Hospital after a long and heroic battle with cancer. He was 49. Both a scientist and business leader, Dr. Whittam played key roles in the operations of the domestic and international Shaklee marketing operations as well as science and technology functions. Dr. Whittam spearheaded the establishment of Yamanouchi Shaklee Pharma (YSPharma, Inc) in 1997. Located at Stanford Research Park, YSPharma, Inc. is dedicated to the development of novel drug delivery technologies, representing the pharmaceutical division of Shaklee Corporation. His professional experience also included top management research and development positions at Proctor & Gamble, Vidal Sassoon and The Gillette Company. Successfully operating in the academic, scientific and business worlds, he was unique in the industry as the only scientist to head a major direct selling company. ''Dr. Whittam will be remembered as an outstanding executive, an accomplished scientist and, above all, a caring person,'' commented Dr. Earl Cheit, Chairman of the Board of Shaklee Corporation and Dean Emeritus of Haas Business School at the University of California, Berkeley. Born in Queens, New York in 1949, Whittam was graduated magna cum laude from New York City College in 1972 with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. He taught chemistry at City Univeristy of New York (CUNY) while earning his Ph.D. there in chemistry and biochemistry in 1975. CUNY honored Dr. Whittam with the Curtman and Myron Pantzer Awards. He then went on to complete an MBA degree from Boston University School of Management in 1977. A Bay Area resident for over 20 years, Dr. Whittam served on various community boards, including UCSF Foundation's Science Committee. He is a member of numerous professional and scientific organizations and has published extensively in scientific and trade journals. An avid runner and athlete, Dr. Whittam competed in both the Boston and New York marathons as well as numerous local races. He served as a member of the U.S. Ski Team Sports Medicine Council and as nutritional consultant to the U.S. Ski Team for eight years. Along with William L. Haskell, Ph.D. of Stanford University and the American College of Sports Medicine, he initiated one of the first academic conferences on ''Nutritional Determinants in Athletic Performance.'' Dr. Whittam is survived by his wife Sibylle, daughter Lauren, and sons Christopher and Alexandre, of Hillsborough, CA, as well as his mother, Barbara Whittam, sisters Denise Whittam and Barbara Schechter, and brother Dennis Whittam, all from the New York area.

The relationship that embodies those strains is a love affair that develops between May (Charlie Hardwick) and Roy (Bill Speed), two proud working-class Britons now in their 50's. May was once a fiery activist in the 1984-85 miners strike. Roy manages a nearby private open-cast mine run by a development company with plans to revitalize the region. May has two bitter teen-age children looking for a foothold in a community that disintegrated after the British Government closed the local mine and left the town in economic ruins. By falling in love with Roy, May, who is having severe physical problems connected with menopause, is, in effect, sleeping with the enemy. But if the two are on opposite sides of a political divide, the movie also shows them to be soul mates who share a salty humor and a fondness for the same 1950's show tunes.",1999-04-16T05:00:00+0000

Everywhere he went, farmers and villagers turned out in larger and larger numbers to hear his message of personal and national liberation. By the time he reached the coast, where he illegally made salt by boiling seawater, his journey had mobilized thousands of Indians in opposition to British policies and stunned the Raj itself by demonstrating, almost for the first time in history, the enormous power of peaceful, nonviolent revolution.

The sentiment of romantic love as we know it was the homoerotic love of older Greek men for boys; marital love, which surely existed, seems oddly not to have been much honored, at least in surviving literature. Plato's elaborately extended metaphor of the republic, or the perfectly balanced state, discusses marriage primarily as mating; by contrast, Plato's ''Symposium'' celebrates homoerotic love in the most blushingly romantic terms. How different this is from the extramarital erotic attraction of heterosexuals, which results in devastation and violent death. In Euripides' ''Hippolytus,'' for instance, the young Queen Phaedra falls in love with her husband's illegitimate son, who rejects her, and causes her to commit suicide; Phaedra is no romantic, but rather the victim of an ungovernable, unwished-for passion imposed upon her by Aphrodite.

us,Best Stage Comedy; Just for Laughs,"Who wrote the best comedy of the last thousand years? At first sight this looks like a straight contest between Moli re and Shakespeare, generally acknowledged as the two greatest dramatists of the millennium who wrote comedy. Don't expect much hesitation from French judges of this competition. But chauvinism aside, Moli re must be a strong candidate, because he was a specialist -- he wrote practically nothing but comedy. Unfortunately, I know Moli re in performance only through the distorting medium of translation. I appreciate the consummate craftsmanship of the plotting, but his rhyming couplets tend to sound like doggerel in English. Moli re remains a foreign country: great to visit, but you don't really feel you belong there. Shakespeare presents a different problem. His finest comedies -- A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' ''As You Like It,'' ''Much Ado About Nothing,'' ''Twelfth Night'' -- are not pure comedies, or, to put it another way, not just comedies. Lysander in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' can sound like Romeo: ''Or if there were a sympathy in choice,/War, death or sickness did lay siege to it,/Making it momentany as a sound,/Swift as a shadow, short as any dream..../So quick bright things come to confusion.''",1999-04-18T05:00:00+0000

Einstein knew that giddy feeling back in 1915 when he realized that his theory of general relativity correctly predicted a puzzling motion of the planet Mercury that had bedeviled astronomers for decades; he later confessed to a friend that he had had heart palpitations. Today those same palpitations are being provoked in his successors by something called M theory, a shadowy concept posited to lie at the end of a mathematical labyrinth known as superstrings. The theory seems to contain everything that physicists ever wanted to know about the forces of nature but were afraid to ask. Curiously, nobody claims to know what M theory actually will say, only that it seems to be there at the end of the mathematical rainbow, still undiscovered, a metaphysical headwaters of the Nile.

But Carrie Carlin has both of these distractions while trying to solve the slaying of a wealthy local businesswoman, in ''Shooting Stars and Other Deadly Things'' (Dell, $5.99), Nancy Tesler's third Carrie Carlin mystery. We have lately noted a number of murder mysteries in which the author and the crime solver (these are amateur detectives) are women and live in New Jersey. Carrie Carlin is a biofeedback clinician who lives in Norwood and works across the border in Piermont, N.Y. Her two children are in therapy to help deal with their parents' messy divorce. Her boyfriend (she hates the term) is a Bergen County police officer. Ms. Tesler, who lives in Tenafly, suggests women are writing murder mysteries because ''lots of us have reached a point in our lives when there's somebody we want to kill'' and choose to commit the deed in fiction. Why New Jersey? Ms. Tesler notes that women are feeling vulnerable in places they once felt safe, leafy residential roads or shopping mall parking lots.

''Daddy, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, and that was one of the greatest inventions in history.'' I learned that, too, when I was a child. I suspect that the same view is taught in most other American and European schools. What we are told about printing is partly true, or at least defensible. Personally, I would rate it as the best single ''invention'' of this millennium. Just think of its enormous consequences for modern societies. Without printing, millions of people wouldn't have read quickly, with no transmission errors, Martin Luther's 95 Theses, the Declaration of Independence, the Communist Manifesto or other world-changing texts. Without printing, we wouldn't have modern science. Without printing, Europeans might not have spread over the globe since 1492, because consolidation of initial European conquests required the emigration of thousands of would-be conquistadors motivated by written accounts of Pizarro's capture of the Incan emperor Atahualpa.",1999-04-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Miserable in Brooklyn,"The walls are literally catching fire in GEOGRAPHIES OF HOME (Viking, $23.95), Loida Maritza Perez's vivid first novel about a family in crisis. For Iliana's Dominican parents, who are eking out an existence in a dilapidated Brooklyn town house, the troubles seem insurmountable. One daughter, Marina, is a rape victim who burns imaginary spiders off the kitchen walls and is descending into schizophrenia. The eldest daughter, Rebecca, routinely brutalized by her husband, is neglecting her small children. Yet another daughter, Beatriz, has simply disappeared. While at college, Iliana is visited by the apparition of her mother, who teases her and beckons her to come home. When she does, Iliana is little prepared for the dire conditions she encounters -- she is struck by her parent's helplessness, their material and emotional poverty. Her transplanted family has not taken root in its adopted country, and is losing its strength and identity. Perez relates much of this story in eerie flashbacks. Memories of a plentiful island life in the Dominican Republic collide with Brooklyn's alienating landscapes. The result is a deluge of intense imagery where the magical and the real occupy the same awful and sometimes sensual space. This novel's narrative is too often fragmented by kaleidoscopic shifts in tense and perspective, dispersing the tension that numerous emotionally chaotic passages build. This is not a flawless book, but one suspects Perez's next one could be. Erica Sanders",1999-04-18T05:00:00+0000

On opening day, Ricky finds out that a Hollywood bigwig will be in the audience and wants back in.

Then, Michelangelo was given a chance at the site. He cleared out a space defined at the sides by palazzi opening diagonally from it. In the center he placed an equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius with his arm stretched out, as if pushing the buildings back.

Perhaps the story of the two brothers, both kings, who found that their wives were unfaithful, took bloody vengeance, and set out into the world to travel until they found someone less fortunate than they were. They encountered a demon who kept a woman in a glass chest with four locks; she came out while he slept and showed them 98 rings she had collected from chance lovers and insisted on having sex with the princes to make it a round 100. The princes decided that the demon was more unfortunate than they were and returned to their kingdoms. There the elder brother, Shahrayar, still angry over his wife's betrayal, instituted a reign of terror, marrying a virgin each day and handing her to his vizier for execution at dawn. The vizier's daughter Shahrazad, a woman both wise and learned, beseeched her father to give her to the king. On the wedding night, the bride asked that her younger sister, Dinarzad, might sleep under the bed, so that when the king had ''finished with Shahrazad,'' the younger girl, as the sisters had agreed, might ask Shahrazad to tell a story to while away the time until dawn. When dawn came, the story was not finished, and the curious king stayed execution for a night. Shahrazad continued to tell tales, which gave rise to other tales, all of which were unfinished at dawn. The king's narrative curiosity kept Shahrazad alive, day after day. She narrated a stay of execution, a space in which she bore three children.

It was a bewildering experience to pass with a few steps from ancient Rome to Renaissance Italy and on to 17th-century Holland. The jumble of paintings, gems and furniture reminded me of visits to my grandmother, but the museum was obviously not someone's home.",1999-04-18T05:00:00+0000
us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Vox Pop With Pix,"From ''The Arkansas Traveler'' to ''The Unsinkable Mrs. Brown,'' AMERICAN FOLK: Classic Tales Retold (Abrams, $39.95) is a treasury of stories. What's more, it is fun for children and adults and has been beautifully illustrated by Warren Infield. Since many folk tales are anonymous and ever changing, Charles Sullivan has done the retelling of what he calls the most interesting American tales, carefully sorting the 60 stories into categories like ''Characters Larger Than Life'' and ''Incredible Animals.'' Sullivan writes with a relaxed, modern tone (''easy come, easy go,'' as Jesse James used to say) but never slangy. Although he skillfully slips in details of history and geography, he also conveys a sense of spirit and energy. There are Davy Crockett, ''fed up with politics, still looking for a good fight''; the Presidential trio, Honest Abe, George and his cherry tree and Teddy and his bear; the irrepressible Kilroy. Paul Bunyan's Babe the Blue Ox astounds Winifred Winslow, Radcliffe graduate, by sending 12-foot logs flying out of her sawmill ''like bullets from a machine gun.'' Joe Magarac from Hungary is the man of steel: people ''shut up quickly when Joe lifted two of the 1,000-pound steel bars together in his right hand.'' Bertrand Charpentier from Paris had a plan to saw off Manhattan. Eliza, daughter and granddaughter of slaves, wanted to name her baby Freedom. Infield's simple watercolors and thematic borders give Rosie the Riveter's lunchbox and Uncle Sam's hat a mythological flair. Finally, each chapter ends with helpful notes on where to find more tales. Patricia Ryan",1999-04-18T05:00:00+0000

The buyer was the British Government, bolstered by a timely advance of 4 million [pounds] from N.M. Rothschild & Sons in London. Spiced with intrigue and flush with flamboyant figures, the affair has all the flair of a thriller. There have been bigger real-estate bonanzas -- notably the $15 million deal that won the Louisiana Purchase from France and the $7 million payment that wrested Alaska from Russia. But none have had quite the elegance, speed and daring of the Suez Canal transaction.

Without it, there would be no end to the sorrows of young Werther, and the travels of the Hobbit would have never been completed. Its absence allowed James Joyce to weave ''Finnegans Wake'' into a perfect circle, and its presence made Henri Michaux compare our essential being to this dot, ''a dot that death devours.'' It crowns the fulfillment of thought, gives the illusion of conclusiveness, possesses a certain haughtiness that stems, like Napoleon's, from its minuscule size. Anxious to get going, we require nothing to signal our beginnings, but we need to know when to stop: this tiny memento mori reminds us that everything, ourselves included, must one day come to a halt. As an anonymous English teacher suggested in the 1680 ''Treatise of Stops, Points or Pauses,'' a full stop is ''a Note of perfect Sense, and of a perfect Sentence.''",1999-04-18T05:00:00+0000

An Iranian immigrant, Col. Genob Sarhang Massoud Amir Behrani, accustomed to the trappings of power, now works at menial jobs. He seizes an opportunity to make money by purchasing, at a county auction, a nice bungalow in Corona, Calif. Kathy Lazaro, who lost the bungalow because of a bureaucratic tax error and whose husband has abandoned her, struggles to reclaim it. When a deputy sheriff named Lester Burdon becomes involved, he falls in love with Lazaro, losing everything else he values in the process. Dubus builds a sturdy narrative about how these characters' visions of the American dream (shelter, security, even love) collide and collapse. Set amid the frequent, flowing fogs and unsteady sands of Pacific suburbia, the novel examines what happens when ordinary men and women move across that tenuous barrier between the normal and the irrational. This is a story, told in highly visual, descriptive language, about how people you might choose to be your neighbors are repeatedly trapped by circumstances and transformed by events until finally they can -- and do -- destroy one another.

Now, sans-theater dining takes center stage as the restaurant adds a lunchtime ''grill express,'' a daily special of salad and pasta served in 15 minutes or less. other items on the expanded lunch menu, with the clock ticking slightly longer, include soups, salads, pastas and entrees ranging from Jamaican jerk chicken to Southern pan-fried catfish with hush puppies to chicken mole quesadilla. The express lunch is served Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 A.M. to 2 P.M., with a soup-and-sandwich special for $10 and the highest-priced entrees at $12. Timewise, it may not beat the five-minute lunch guarantee at your local pizza chain, but the food is probably better and the setting is certainly more elegant. Information: (973) 642-1226.

Universally acclaimed for his integrity by all who knew him, including Bishops, Deans, Governors, Legislators, Judges and fellow citizens on the streets of New York, Bernard Newman consistently credited his parents, and his wife for 59 years, Kathryn Bereano, and his life time friend and surviving spouse, Fritzi W. Rudolph, for his sterling reputation. A Governor of New York, once marveled how Bernard ''could engage in political activities and in a post of leadership and retain his...reputation for integrity.'' Born on October 28, 1907 to Isidor J. and Sarah C. Newman, and life time resident of New York City, Bernard Newman was a gentleman of profound wisdom, integrity and generosity, and a man of great compassion. More significantly Bernard Newman was a man completely devoted and dedicated to his family, and tremendously adored and loved by his family and friends. An honor graduate of the college and law school of New York University and an Associate Editor of the Law Review, Bernard Newman was a lawyer's lawyer and a judge's judge. As a young attorney, Bernard was attracted at an early age to public service. First as an Assistant Corporation Counsel assigned to the office of Chamberlain A.A. Berle, Jr., and next as a law secretary to New York State Supreme Court Justice, Samuel H. Hofstadler. For 16 years, presiding justices David W. Peck and Bernard Botein designated lawyer Newman an official referee of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. On December 12, 1965, Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. appointed him to the family court, which was followed by an appointment to the State Supreme Court by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. Then, on July 21, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson, nominated the Judge to the Customs Court, situated in New York. The jurisdiction of which was expanded by Congress in 1980 under the name United States Court of International Trade. Judge Newman, who delighted in the distinction of having been appointed by Mayor, the Governor, and the President, presided for more than 30 years over complex Federal Customs and international trade cases, while also sitting in recent years in the federal district court in Manhattan. Judge Newman also once served as Council to, and Chairman of, the New York County Republican Party; as a delegate to Republican National Nominating Conventions; as a referee on special panels of the New York State Labor Relations and Mediation Boards. Judge Newman also was a Director of the Civic Center Synagogue, Community, Synagogue Center, Metropolitan Advisory Board of Anti Defamation League, and Laguardia Memorial Association. He was also the recipient of the Judge Edward Weinfeld Award, and Man of the Year Award. In addition to his wife Fritzi, the Judge is survived by daughters Phyllis Cechini and Helene Bernstein, grandchildren Craig and Kathy, John and Kathy, Mark and Hayley Cechini, Scott and Marcia, Brad and Annette Bernstein, and eight great-grandchildren.

On the staff of British Information Services (latterly as Head, Press Section, News Division), awarded M.B.E. by Queen Elizabeth II in 1972 for more than twenty-five years devoted to promoting understanding between the USA and Britain. Polly served Vassar College in many capacities: as a member of the AAVC Board of Directors, Chairman of the Alumnae House Committee, AAVC Representative to the Investor Responsibility Committee, President of the Class of 1933 and Chairman of the Class's 50th Reunion. As a volunteer for Vassar, whenever writing was needed to be lucid, fluent and concise, it was Polly who was called upon.

The tape also documents an Abbott and Costello convention (held in Clifton), and a bus tour of Paterson narrated by Lou Rege, a cousin of Costello's.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Cropping the World,"W. Eugene Smith's powerful convictions and high aspirations drove him to produce this century's best-known photo essays and some of its most powerful images. His pictures for Life magazine shot between 1948 and 1954 -- Country Doctor,'' ''Nurse Midwife,'' ''A Man of Mercy'' (Albert Schweitzer) and ''Spanish Village'' -- set the standard for photojournalists who followed him. Contrary to the journalistic ethic of objectivity -- producing an undoctored version of events -- Smith often manipulated both his subjects and the photographic process to create what he called intensified reality. He produced dramatic prints by means of cropping, burning, dodging and bleaching. Before he started shooting he meticulously researched his subjects, and once on the job he consistently extended deadlines to get deeper into his story. If Smith envisioned a shot that would make his point, he was not above orchestrating the resulting image by, for example, renting cattle to block a truck on a rural Welsh road to illustrate the intersection of modern and traditional life. He called this ''rearranging for the truth of actuality.'' Despite his reputation as one of the seminal figures of 20th-century photography, his legacy and reputation are complicated. W. EUGENE SMITH: Photographs 1934-1975 (Abrams, $75), edited by Gilles Mora and John T. Hill, presents a balanced assessment of this talented and troubled figure. The 350 photographs are richly reproduced and reflect the scope of Smith's work from banal early magazine pictures to the searing image of a mother holding her deformed daughter. The layouts of his Life stories and sample pages from a projected autobiography (to be told through photos) remind us that Smith's works were meant to be read like stories, not treated as precious art objects. Interspersed throughout are informative essays that deal with Smith's psyche, technique and enduring influence. Rosemary Ranck",1999-04-25T05:00:00+0000

That claim is true, however. Most Nigerians of my generation were weaned on opera, complete with every structural component, from overture to stand-and-deliver arias to tragic climaxes. The overture went by a different name, of course; it was called the Opening Glee, which meant that our opera went one better than others in that it also boasted a Closing Glee.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  NEWMAN, BERNARD","NEWMAN-Bernard, Judge. Universally acclaimed for his integrity by all who knew him, including Bishops, Deans, Governors, Legislators, Judges and fellow citizens on the streets of New York, Bernard Newman consistently credited his parents, and his wife for 59 years, Kathryn Bereano, and his life time friend and surviving spouse, Fritzi W. Rudolph, for his sterling reputation. A Governor of New York, once marveled how Bernard ''could engage in political activities and in a post of leadership and retain his...reputation for integrity.'' Born on October 28, 1907 to Isidor J. and Sarah C. Newman, and life time resident of New York City, Bernard Newman was a gentleman of profound wisdom, integrity and generosity, and a man of great compassion. More significantly Bernard Newman was a man completely devoted and dedicated to his family, and tremendously adored and loved by his family and friends. An honor graduate of the college and law school of New York University and an Associate Editor of the Law Review, Bernard Newman was a lawyer's lawyer and a judge's judge. As a young attorney, Bernard was attracted at an early age to public service. First as an Assistant Corporation Counsel assigned to the office of Chamberlain A.A. Berle, Jr., and next as a law secretary to New York State Supreme Court Justice, Samuel H. Hofstadler. For 16 years, presiding justices David W. Peck and Bernard Botein designated lawyer Newman an official referee of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. On December 12, 1965, Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. appointed him to the family court, which was followed by an appointment to the State Supreme Court by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. Then, on July 21, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson, nominated the Judge to the Customs Court, situated in New York. The jurisdiction of which was expanded by Congress in 1980 under the name United States Court of International Trade.

us,'We Know These Faces',"How can the Holocaust not come burningly to mind? Yet the differences are acute. Half a century ago, the Jews of Europe had no land dispute with their annihilators. They were loyal citizens everywhere. They had neither arms nor hope of rescue. The Serbs, in that merciless period, were among that minuscule fraction of Europe's Christian population who actively resisted Hitler's murderous pursuit of Jews. Now this once-principled nation has, unaccountably, given birth to Slobodan Milosevic, promulgator of the term ''ethnic cleansing'' and relentless proponent of its brutalities. At the same time, the Kosovo Liberation Army, seeking full independence for the largely Muslim ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, receives financing from fanatical Iran, backer of Hezbollah and inciter of religious terrorism abroad. And meanwhile German bombers are once again in Europe's skies. The political kaleidoscope shifts and shifts; the old patterns are unrecognizable.",1999-04-25T05:00:00+0000

Everything about Rio left him sad. Contact with the West had corrupted the tropics, he was convinced; Rio and Sao Paulo, too, where he taught for a time, were little more than modern urban ruins, their up-to-date streetscapes masking an epic loss of human difference. Only when he ventured deep into the interior, and encountered the Bororo -- the pure, unadulterated Other -- did he like what he heard. At night, the men of the tribe, naked except for straw penis-sheaths, shook gourd rattles and chanted in a low-pitched guttural tongue; the ''intensity and quality'' of the principal players was so remarkable, he wrote, ''that no conductor of a large European orchestra could have surpassed them.''",1999-04-25T05:00:00+0000

Together with his late brother, Charles, he owned and lovingly piloted one of the leading antique jewelry establishments in NYC for nearly seven decades, striving always to provide the right object for the right occasion, at a reasonable price consistent with the high quality of the merchandise, and his clientele included many of the artistic, literary, musical and theatrical leading lights of the time. The store, evolving through later reincarnations on East 48 and East 61 Streets, finally closed in 1991 with his retirement. He was as well a rare chamber musician, occupying first violin chair in his ''Tanglefoot String Quartet'' for some sixty years of joyous amateur music-making. Born on Thanksvgiving Day 1903, he was a liferaft and an anchor for many, at a time when there are few human heroes. When asked what mattered to him most, he said, ''Each day, to give meaning to the lives touched by mine.'' He will be sorely missed by many.

Now Droog has an even more ambitious task: to revitalize a small town in eastern Germany through product design. The commission is from a German cultural organization intent on restoring the formerly flourishing town of Oranienbaum, a 17th-century market town whose palace was built for a Dutch princess. (It's not far from Dessau, birthplace of the Bauhaus.) Four Droog designers have come up with 20 prototypes that celebrate local crafts and materials, comment on global homogenization and try to create an identity for the town. There's a willow swing that looks like a basket on steroids (right, with Marcel Wanders, its designer), bright crayoned packaging for the town's shops (inset) and a park bench (left) made of a tree trunk and bronze chair backs in historical styles. While they may not put Oranienbaum on the map, the designs hint that there is such a thing as pride of place. JULIE V. IOVINE",1999-04-29T05:00:00+0000

us,Album of the Week,"KREIDLER: ''APPEARANCE AND THE PARK'' (Mute). In the 1970's, German bands like Can and Neu wandered from psychedelic jamming to the minimalistic delights of laying pattern upon pattern. Kreidler, a four-member band -- bass, drums, samplers, turntables -- from Dusseldorf, is part of the rediscovery of that era, when eager, goofy futurism was expressed in the shallow tones of early synthesizers. Kreidler brings back the lightweight clanks and blips and hand claps, the hisses and gurgles and tootles of those instruments, while tucking its more realistic modern sounds behind the vintage analog timbres. Its pieces are unhurried and sparsely arranged; only one, luckily, has vocals. And after the tinniness provides its amusements, Kreidler's ingenuity takes over. Mechanized repetitions, just out of phase, turn into dizzying polyrhythms; vaguely ominous melodies float into earshot and linger. Somehow, the limited sounds become poignant as well as funny, as if even simple machines had hearts. JON PARELES",1999-04-30T05:00:00+0000
