It is a revolution without a major breakthrough, without a miracle drug, without a Salk or a DeVries as its champion. It is a revolution spread over decades, not days, an accumulation of technique and technology that is changing the way we deal with our musculoskeletal structure, that organization of bones, cartilage, tendons, ligaments and muscles that holds us together and gives us form. These are some of the developments that have resulted directly from this ongoing revolution: Victims of bone cancer, a disease once among the grimmest of killers, now have a fairly high rate of survival. Athletes with serious knee and shoulder injuries are being operated on and returned to action in weeks instead of months. Surgeons are able to design orthopedic prostheses - the artificial implants that take the place of bones in the body - on computers. Researchers are experimenting with the advanced concept of growing new bones by ''tricking'' old bones into reproducing themselves. Osteoporosis - the condition of fragile bones in the elderly - once considered inescapable for older women, is now being arrested and even prevented. The implantation of artificial joints is giving mobility and freedom from pain to hundreds of thousands of people.

The Gallery falls into this last-named category. Of particular importance is its location: On U.S. 1 and just a stone's throw from the various shopping centers that crowd this area. Add to that the attractive interior - hanging plants, rattan furniture intermingled with comfortable leather-like seats and the large flower paintings - and the accommodating and friendly service, and the Gallery is a pleasant place to stop for lunch or dinner.",1985-05-05T05:00:00+0000

Conditions vary, of course, because it is a big country, but generally late September and early October in Peking and many other cities are sunny and mild. One Chinese official likened Peking's fall weather to New York's. Farther south visitors might experience some humid weather. In Peking in September the average daily maximum temperature is 78 degrees Fahrenheit and the average daily minimum is 57. The corresponding temperatures for October are 66 and 44.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE DOUBLE MAN. By William S. Cohen and Gary Hart. (Morrow, $16.95.) This cloak-and-blather confection by Senators William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, and Gary Hart, Democrat of Colorado, is as plausible as any labor done thus far this year in Washington. The book is much like the capital, breathless with self-conceit and silly with ruminations on ''power.'' The hero-senator, Thomas Chandler, would be President except for the machinations of the C.I.A. and K.G.B. in a plot crammed with the high stakes and casuistries worthy of the MX debate. The authors have done President Reagan the favor of accepting his all-purpose foreign policy premise - the elevation of terrorist acts, in this case attempts on the lives of American officials, from violent symptoms of life's complicated travails, to a singular, diabolical problem. This helps the scenario bubble like a large pizza to go, studded with pieces of Kennedy conspiracy, Star Wars, Mafioso patriots, the omniscient source in the shadows - every D.C. cliche but the Federal deficit. The characters are self-important enough to be believable by Washington standards. Senator Tom's beauteous, green-eyed, doubly intriguing staffer, Elaine Dunham, is as tough and unfluffy as one of those business-suit neckties that capital women wear like modern-day wimples. She finally melts and joins with him in a tableau blessedly free of detailed hydraulics. One of the authors' nicer sentences goes: ''Later, back at her place, they made love.''

us,NOTED WITH PLEASURE,"The Love of the Uncommon It would be difficult to find a more classical characterization of the nature of fiction than this one quoted from Hardy by Irving Howe in his ''Thomas Hardy'' (Collier). Mr. Howe calls it an ''esthetic of incongruity,'' a phrase which might apply to fiction's latest shimmering product. The real if unavowed purpose of fiction is to give pleasure by gratifying the love of the uncommon in human experience, mental or corporeal. This is done all the more perfectly in proportion as the reader is illuded to believe the personages true and real like himself. Solely to this latter end a work of fiction should be a precise transcript of ordinary life: but the uncommon would be absent and the interest lost. Hence the writer's problem is, how to strike the balance between the uncommon and the ordinary so as on the one hand to give interest, on the other to give reality. In working out this problem, human nature must never be made abnormal, which is introducing incredibility. The uncommonness must be in the events, not in the characters; and all the writer's art lies in shaping the uncommonness while disguising its unlikelihood, if it be unlikely. The Intimate Stranger Feminists too have fathers, whom they sometimes have to reconcile with their principles.

us,THEATER: WILSON'S 'FENCES',"In ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,'' the playwright August Wilson took us into a Chicago band room of 1927, where black musicians channeled a heritage of unspeakable suffering into beautiful blues music, and, on occasion, eruptions of self-destructive rage. In ''Fences,'' the new Wilson play at the Yale Repertory Theater, the setting is again the urban industrial North, and the characters are again transplanted blacks from the South, some of whom tote musical instruments.

This means you have time to figure out and predict the results of roulette. All you have to do is wait for the ball to leave the croupier's hand, then calculate the various Newtonian laws that go into operation (like the coefficients of friction and drag) and place your bets. It's no harder than applying a set of mathematical equations similar to those used by NASA for landing spaceships on the moon. You have 10 to 20 seconds. Simple, right?",1985-05-08T05:00:00+0000

Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 2, 1983. The film opens today at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street. IN the first section of Chantal Akerman's ''Golden Eighties,'' a number of actors are seen on videotape, rehearsing lines that are intentionally absurd. The camera studies the auditioners intently as they invest meaningless dialogue with unwarranted passion (''Actually red is not my color, you see,'' one woman declares emotionally in a clothing store). They seem to be speaking about a broken love affair, a tryst that takes place in a shop's dressing room, and the glories of Canada, among other things.

He felt that better performances would have proved how worthy it was. Now, thanks to a major reconstruction by Toni Lander and Bruce Marks, Ballet West's young dancers bring the ballet back to life on new and valid terms, though the production is more of a curiosity than a major work of substance. Mainly, it is an excuse for transformation scenes and Bournonville-style dancing.

In 1941, nine months after Hitler invaded the Netherlands, Etty Hillesum, a 27-year-old Dutch woman began a diary. Terrence Des Pres wrote in these pages that this sample of ''survivor testimony'' offers ''a story of spiritual growth such as I have seldom seen anywhere, least of all in accounts of the shut-down world of the Holocaust.'' It is not about war and Nazi terror, he added, but ''about Eros and the soul.'' Published here in 1984, it was translated by Arno Pomerans. THE ONLY PROBLEM, by Muriel Spark. (Wideview-Perigee/Putnam, $8.95.) This 1984 novel is an account of the perils that surround our unsuspecting lives, and that metaphysical component customary in Muriel Spark's fiction - in this case, a disputation on the Book of Job. The major characters are Harvey, a rich Canadian living in France, and Effie, his wife, who plants bombs in supermarkets and department stores as a member of the Front de la Liberation de l'Europe. Our reviewer, Anita Brookner, termed the narrative ''unnerving and as expert as her readers have come to expect from this most excellent of storytellers.''

When my mother-in-law dies, can I retain it for myself or my daughter? . . . I. I. A., Flushing, Queens Answer: Although you have been paying the rent, your mother-in-law is probably the tenant of record, according to Martin A. Shlufman, deputy counsel for rent administration for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. An immediate-family member can remain only if it was his or her primary residence; staying there ''on occasion'' does not qualify. House-Rule Violations Question: What recourse does a co-op board have with respect to a tenant-shareholder who persists in flouting such house rules as the requirement that bicycles be transported via service elevators, or that no more than two washing machines be used at a time? . . . L. R. M., Manhattan Answer: Violations of the house rules are a default of the lease, says Marc Luxemburg, president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, and you can seek an injunction in State Supreme Court to stop the conduct or terminate the lease and bring an eviction proceeding in Housing Court.

Thus our recent visits to The Cookshop revealed ingredients decent enough, but dishes once memorable for their culinary craft and finesse seemed artless and roughhoused; and, perhaps to justify the prices (once modest enough to make the food seem a bargain, now in league with places that offer a good deal more by way of amenities and comfort), frankly burly, give-'em-their-money's-worth portions daunted even those diners brought up according to the bylaws of that diabolical invention of determined parents - the Clean Plate Club.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"DAYS BETWEEN STATIONS. By Steve Erickson. (Poseidon, $15.95.) Sometime in the not too distant future, the planet Earth is rapidly going to the dogs. Los Angeles is swept by sandstorms that darken the sky and send dunes crawling up the buildings. A pall of smoke hangs over Paris, where the lights have gone out and bonfires burn out of control. The canals of Venice have inexplicably dried up, and the streets, smelling of garbage, are periodically plunged into deep fog. The landscape is fabulous, bleak; the lovers who travel through it, Michel and Lauren, are just the opposite - romantically alienated and drunk on their own eroticism. There is a healthy dose of cinematic surrealism in the Los Angeles writer Steve Erickson's moody first novel, along with a decidedly unhealthy dose of overwrought ''Fleurs du Mal'' bad dreams. Lauren, wife of a Vietnam veteran and world-class cyclist named Jason, stumbles into an adventure with the estranged, degenerate Michel (or Adrien - a victim of amnesia, he isn't sure which). Tortured by the past he cannot remember, with only a reel of film for a clue, he makes a voyage via flashbacks to Paris of the 1920's, where his grandfather is filming an epic of the death of Marat. With the magical ease of a movie that floats back and forth in space and time, the author at one point sets Lauren adrift on a houseboat from the Seine out onto the Atlantic, through the straits of Gibralter to meet Jason in the desiccated Venice.",1985-05-12T05:00:00+0000

Young chefs such as Nicholas Gill, Allan Garth and John Webber, who are English, and Raymond Blanc, who is French-born, have carried the message of fresh, creative cuisine to the counties too. Nowadays, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire, West Sussex and Devon, among others, can claim excellent restaurants of their own.

The limits, of $1,000 a month, are intended to stem a run on deposits that began last week at Maryland's second-largest thrift institution. Governor Hughes, acting three months after a similar crisis in Ohio, said he would ask the legislature for the right to declare a full bank holiday if needed. [Page A1.] Federal regulators are undertaking an all-out effort to make Federal deposit insurance available to the Maryland institutions. [D19.] The crisis has focused renewed attention on private insurance of thrift institutions in the four states besides Ohio and Maryland that have such insurance. Retail sales climbed 0.9 percent in April. The decline in March was also less drastic than originally reported - 0.7 percent rather than 1.9 percent. The White House and some economists said the report indicated that the economy was reviving. [D1.] Sales of new American-made cars fell 8.6 percent in the first 10 days of May, compared with that period last year. That results were slightly below what most auto industry analysts had been expecting. [D13.] Consumer credit rose by $8.34 billion in March. [D13.] Aides gave President Reagan three tax alternatives for reducing the 50 percent top rate that applies to individuals, according to Administration officials.

Embodying Cage's innovative principles of silence, repetition and processes of gradual change, the piece reflects the composer's preoccupation with disturbances of the mind at a turning point in his life, shortly before he discovered Asian philosophy and Zen Buddhism. Tonight the Asia Society will present the New York premiere of ''Four Walls,'' with new choreography by Sin Cha Hong, the Korean dancer and founder of the Laughing Stone Dance Theater Company. Also featured will be Margaret Leng Tan, one of Asia's leading pianists, and Andrea Goodman, an original member of Meredith Monk's Vocal Ensemble. The performance is at 8 P.M. in the auditorium at 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street. Tickets are $20. Information: 288-6400.",1985-05-17T05:00:00+0000

One final bastion of charm does remain to delight those who crave its airy pleasures: light music, or more precisely, light-hearted music. When performed with good taste and an appropriate sense of style, music of this nature affords a splendid antidote to the rudest shocks that modern civilization can heave at us.

The explosion went off on the doorstep of Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the fiery preacher who is widely believed to be the inspiration behind the rapidly growing fundamentalist Party of God movement.

The heroine is an illiterate Appalachian girl who strikes out on her own, works, marries, bootlegs and gradually, as she examines her life, acquires a workable philosophy. Stanley Young commented here that in this work, unlike his previous novels, Anderson ''begins to suggest possible answers, possible faiths, possible staffs to cling to.'' FIRST LADY FROM PLAINS, by Rosalynn Carter. (Fawcett Gold Medal, $3.95.) Jimmy Carter, Jody Pow-ell and Hamilton Jordan had also written on their White House experiences when Rosalynn Carter's account appeared last year. But our reviewer, Phil Gailey, said her book was probably more useful than theirs to readers who wanted to understand Jimmy Carter. The most interesting and valuable parts of the book, he said, flowed from her access to power. ''Mrs. Carter has written what may turn out to be the best human account of the Carter Presidency that we are likely to get.'' THE VIEW FROM POMPEY'S HEAD, by Hamilton Basso. (Arbor House, $6.95.) Anson Page, hero of this 1954 novel, is a New York lawyer who returns to his Southern home town to unravel an embezzlement, and unearths the mysteries of his own life. Our reviewer, John Brooks, called it ''the most pleasantly and sensibly romantic novel to come my way in a long time.''

Like Granada TV's ''Jewel in the Crown,'' this is adapted from an ambitious literary work - nothing less than C. P.

It has been adapted for the British Broadcasting Corporation by Julian Bond, a relatively distinguished veteran of mini-series credits.

us,CANDLE IN AN ICY DRAFT,"WHAT THE LIGHT WAS LIKE By Amy Clampitt. 110 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. Cloth, $14.95. Paper, $8.95. THE acclaim that has greeted Amy Clampitt's work is the more surprising in that its special characteristics are among those routinely disparaged by mainstream contemporary taste. Instead of ''natural speech'' and Hemingway terseness she gives us baroque profusion, the romance of the adjective, labyrinthine syntax, a festival lexicon. She is as ''literary'' and allusive as Eliot and Pound, as filled with grubby realia as William Carlos Williams, as ornamented as Wallace Stevens and as descriptive as Marianne Moore. Moore's Socratic tone, her appetite for fact and abrupt leaps of association have shaped Miss Clampitt's talent, and so has Hopkins - the accumulation of sensory ecstasies, the Saxonism of his diction and syntax, the multiplied coinages. All of this amounts to saying that Miss Clampitt is found among the famous eccentrics of style, like Milton, Dickinson, Mallarme and Stevens who write in a special poetic dialect of their own confection.",1985-05-19T05:00:00+0000

us,HIS LONG ORDEAL BY LAUGHTER,"ZUCKERMAN BOUND A Trilogy and Epilogue. By Philip Roth. 784 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. Cloth, $22.50. Paper, $9.95. PHILIP ROTH'S ''Zuckerman Bound'' binds together ''The Ghost Writer,'' ''Zuckerman Unbound'' and ''The Anatomy Lesson,'' adding to them as epilogue a wild short novel, ''The Prague Orgy,'' which is at once the bleakest and the funniest writing Roth has done. The totality is certainly the novelist's finest achievement to date, eclipsing even his best single fictions, the exuberantly notorious ''Portnoy's Complaint'' and the undervalued and ferocious ''My Life as a Man.'' ''Zuckerman Bound'' is a classic apologia, an aggressive defense of Roth's moral stance as an author. Its cosmos derives candidly from the Freudian interpretation of ambivalence as being primal, and the Kafkan evasion of interpretation as being unbearable. Roth knows that Freud and Kafka mark the origins and limits of a literary culture, American and Jewish, which has an uneasy relationship to Talmudic Judaism and its waning culture. Freud's psychologizing of every religious and moral impulse, and Kafka's imaginative despair as to whether these same impulses ever could find realistic embodiment again, have combined to render problematical the Jewish tradition's hopes for human nature. I suspect that Roth knows and accepts also what his surrogate, Zuckerman, is sometimes too outraged to recognize: breaking a new road causes outrage in others and suffering in himself. Perhaps that is the Jewish version of Emerson's American Law of Compensation: nothing is got for nothing.",1985-05-19T05:00:00+0000

Then the judges of the nation's premier literary prize, the Miles Franklin Award, declined to award it, although Elizabeth Jolley, David Malouf, David Foster, Nigel Krauth and John Hooker, to name a few, have published novels recently and thus were eligible. David Williamson and half a dozen other dramatists have been drawn into writing scripts for the growing film and television mini-series industries. The editor of a short story anthology noted in his preface that contemporary Australian short fiction is fragmentary, materialist, unpolitical. And a recent survey by the Australia Council found that the average earnings of authors from their writing was $6,700 (Australian) a year.

Answer:Almost all resorts that offer sailing either provide boats at extra cost or are associated with a company that makes separate sailing arrangements. An exception is Caneel Bay on St. John in the United States Virgin Islands, which offers a Best of Both Worlds program, combining a sailboat with accommodations. The seven-night package includes four nights at the resort, three meals a day and use of sports facilities, and three nights aboard a sailboat without crew. With a 35-foot Hinckley Pilot, the package costs $794 a person; with a 40-foot Hinckley Bermuda, it costs $824 a person (both through Oct. 31). Both sleep one or two couples. Either land or sea stays may be extended by paying one-seventh of the weekly rate for each extra day. For the Bermuda, a captain is available for $100 a day extra, a cook/mate for $80 a day extra. Arrangements can be made through St. John Water Sports (809-776-6256), which also offers a two-week package for four (a week at the hotel and a week at sea with captain and cook) for $1,290 a person.

Though the judge held the rent was too low, he said an owner may discount the fair rental value by 20 percent to reflect the gain realized by avoiding a management fee and renting to trustworthy tenants.",1985-05-19T05:00:00+0000
us,SEEING THE NEW LIGHT,"PEOPLE usually spend most of their time indoors under light that is quite dim -a kind of perpetual twilight. It may be adequate for reading and routine activities at home and at work, but researchers now find that this low level of light can throw a person's body rhythms out of kilter and seriously affect physical and mental well-being. What they recommend is to get outdoors daily for a good dose of bright light. Plain daylight, which is easily a hundred times brighter than typical indoor lighting, is all it takes. Direct sunlight is neither necessary nor advisable; its only known benefit, vitamin D synthesis, requires no more than 15 minutes of exposure every other day on an area as small as the back of the neck.",1985-05-19T05:00:00+0000

us,  NEW RULES BREED WASTEFUL MERGERS,"PUBLIC policy is always fertile ground for irony. Today, for example, the economic landsacpe is strewn with merger fiascos, but current antitrust policy toward these combinations is increasingly lenient. ''Economic efficiency'' is now the ''only goal'' of merger policy, according to a former Justice Department official. As a result, the merger wave of the 1980's surges ahead, reaching a new peak last week with the Allied Corporation's $5 billion planned union with the Signal Companies, the largest industrial merger ever (outside the oil industry). This preoccupation with economic efficiency ignores Congressional intent and judicial precedent. The legislative history of the antitrust laws contains almost no mention of efficiency, production or price. Rather, there is an insistent Jeffersonian concern for the small entrepreneur - for social, not economic reasons. Thus, the Supreme Court has always ruled that efficiencies cannot save an otherwise illegal merger.",1985-05-19T05:00:00+0000

The mystery story, which has been with us in its present form for almost a century and a half and helped while away the night hours for innumerable insomniacs, can now be heard as well as read.

Auguste Dupin, and the tough-guy American tones of Raymond Chandler's private eye Philip Marlowe, as well as all types and classes of Englishmen. The results are certainly entertaining, the only real disadvantage being that you can't riffle back through the pages to clear up a missed point in the puzzle; pressing the rewind button on a cassette player or trying to find your way back through the grooves of a phonograph record is much too hit or miss a business.",1985-05-19T05:00:00+0000

Among the participants were State Senator Ernest Chambers of Nebraska, who has introduced a bill to pay college athletes as if they were university employees; Dr. Harry Edwards, associate professor of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley, who organized the protest by some black athletes at the 1968 Olympics, and Dr. James H.

Calder was too large as an artist, and as a human being, to be stuck with a title that can only remind the visitor of ''Picasso's Picassos.'' Besides, Picasso was a hoarder of genius. What he kept for himself related to the private economy of an immensely complex and inter-echoing output. He kept what he needed, what he couldn't bear to let go, and - coincidentally -what in many cases would eventually put Picasso scholarship on a completely new track. That was not the way that Calder's mind operated.",1985-05-24T05:00:00+0000

That, at least, is the thesis of the critic Barbara Rose, who with Susie Kalil, a Houston art writer, assembled ''Fresh Paint,'' the first ''major'' exhibition of painting by Houston artists, for the Museum of Fine Arts in that city.

Romanticism, perhaps because it never went out of fashion, has not been so fortunate. How ironic it is that, despite our evident affection for 19th-century music, we have been content to repeat the same warhorses, only rarely venturing into unfamiliar terrain.",1985-05-26T05:00:00+0000

ON ASYLUM: SOME OF THE INS AND OUTS OF WHO GETS IN,"The United States has a history of offering refuge to people fleeing persecution, but in recent years the Government has turned down thousands of applications from citizens of foreign countries seeking asylum here. The denial of asylum to many Salvadorans, in particular, has stirred protests in recent weeks from members of Congress and church groups. The following questions and answers review the confusion and controversy. Question. Who qualifies for asylum? Answer. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, an alien may qualify for asylum if he has ''a well-founded fear of persecution'' in his homeland ''on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.'' It is common to speak of political asylum, but the law does not restrict asylum to cases of political persecution. Q. How many people get asylum? A. The Immigration and Naturalization Service granted 8,278 applications and denied 32,344 last year as it made a major effort to reduce its backlog of cases. Most of the successful applications came from citizens of Iran (5,017), Nicaragua (1,018) and Poland (721).",1985-05-26T05:00:00+0000

The book's step-by-step route starts in Amsterdam and leads through West Germany to Austria, Venice and Rome and then northward through Switzerland and finally to Paris. The trip is designed as a 3,000-mile car tour but it can be adapted to rail travel and includes train schedules. Each day is treated as a separate unit, so travelers needn't stick to a 22-day routine. For each day there is a suggested schedule, sightseeing, budget accommodations with addresses and telephone numbers, transportation notes and a map. ''Europe in 22 Days'' is available in some bookstores for $4.95 or from Mr. Steves' company, Europe Through the Back Door, 111 Fourth Avenue North, Edmonds, Wash. 98020, for $4 postpaid.",1985-05-26T05:00:00+0000

But after a moment, the man turned to Mr. Badea and said, ''I was at your concert Sunday, and I really enjoyed the Ligeti.'' The conductor was taken aback. ''First of all,'' he says, ''I never would have taken this man for a concertgoer. But can you imagine - he didn't say he liked the Mozart or the Schubert, but the Ligeti.

It was rough, rude and apparently caricatural - the very antithesis, in other words, of what was expected of a reborn School of Paris. Yet in no time at all it cut the fat off French painting. Within three years of that first exhibition he was shown at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York and recognized by Clement Greenberg as the most substantial new talent to have come out of Paris since World War II.

In ''Fiskadoro,'' which joins the growing ranks of novels set beyond the end of the world, the poet and novelist Denis Johnson attempts something much more daring and provocative. He doesn't entirely avoid the millenarian impulse. But his startlingly original book is an examination of the cataclysmic imagination, a parable of apocalypse that is always present and precedes redemption in a cycle of death and birth, forgetting and remembering.",1985-05-26T05:00:00+0000
