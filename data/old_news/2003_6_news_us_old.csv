As a member of the Columbia faculty for more than 30 years, Dr. Lattes trained many of today's leaders in surgical pathology. During WWII he and his colleague, Dr. Virginia Frantz, developed a new cellulose - based hemostatic agent. Throughout his career, his contributions to the characterization of the pathology of soft tissue tumors have become the international standard. We will remember his wit and his generosity in making himself available for consultation with surgeons long after he retired. We extend deepest condolences to his family and friends.

He may remind viewers of Wallace, the teenage character who last season gave up a rural safe haven to return to his housing project -- where he was pretty sure he would die -- because ''them [expletive] crickets don't let you sleep.'' Like the other characters on ''The Wire,'' these two have been made provincial by the big city.

Then he slowed down a little, bending forward, as if preparing to leap up, ready to kick the music into a higher gear. The audience took this as a cue and started clapping in rhythm. Lang glanced toward the crowd, surprised. He had something else in mind. He plunged ahead, gradually upping the tempo and leaving the clappers behind. He ended in a torrent of thundering chords, the last one propelling his head backward, eyes skyward and arms out. He looked as if he had just been struck by a bolt from heaven, which is also how the audience reacted: people jumped to their feet, roaring in unison even before the sound of the last chord had died.

And the noise is confusing me. London and its airport must have been busy but I feel that we have emerged from near silence into this aggressive, lighthearted tumult. Years of disciplined dieting have left me stick-thin and as I shuffle the travel papers and passports and begin to worry about the baggage, I am aware that there's nothing much in the way of protection between my flame and the demands that are being made on it by this expedition. No ordinary journey for me or for the tall figure standing a little to the side, detached, aloof and rather grand but in fact carefully positioned so as not to be conspicuous and finding the place of maximum safety in this press of people. If I'm scared, he must be terrified. Not that he's showing it. Only a slight over-stillness and a too-studied air of relaxation betray him. ",2003-06-01T05:00:00+0000

A Moroccan roast lamb features a wildly aromatic spice mix that promises to float you off on a waft of flavor. For the most part, though, Lawson favors lightness and simplicity. And color.

Then, they caravan in trucks and S.U.V.'s to a private ranch northeast of Douglas, six blank miles from the border.

us,George W. Bush and the Poet,"GIVEN that the artistic muse of the Clinton administration was Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, the creator of the sitcom ''Designing Women,'' George W. Bush's appointment of Bo Derek to the board of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts could hardly be faulted for breaking with tradition. Ever since Abraham Lincoln overruled his advisers to attend ''Our American Cousin,'' culture has been considered ladies' work in Washington -- first ladies' work. It was Jacqueline Kennedy who brought Pablo Casals to the East Room, not her husband, who celebrated his inaugural with a command performance by the Rat Pack. It is Laura Bush who invites writers to the White House, not the president, whose inaugural concert featured Andrew Lloyd Webber, Ricky Martin and Wayne Newton.

us,How I Learned to Love Quotas,"Not long ago, I had an unexpected opportunity to explain to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor why I've changed my mind about affirmative action. I had been invited to give a talk about racial preferences for the justices of the Supreme Court of India, who were in Washington on a judicial exchange program. When I arrived at the conference room, I found, to my surprise and alarm, that the assembled Indian justices were accompanied by their hosts, Justices O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer, who decided at the last moment to come along for the discussion. The thought of presuming to give an academic lecture about affirmative action in front of the woman who represents the swing vote on the Rehnquist Court -- and who will soon decide the fate of affirmative action in America -- was too harrowing to contemplate. So I abandoned my notes and chose instead to appeal to O'Connor in personal terms, describing why I had long been skeptical of affirmative action in higher education and why I recently have come to support it -- not for moral or social reasons but for purely practical ones.",2003-06-01T05:00:00+0000

A book about the garden is a gardener's best friend. Another gardener is not a gardener's best friend. Another gardener is very complicated. Other gardeners have all sorts of opinions about your garden, about their garden, about somebody else's garden and they are not afraid to voice them. And then again, another gardener in your garden, this whole relationship will be brimming over with feelings. They love yellow flowers so very much, you love blue flowers so very much; you both then try to love red flowers only a little. On it goes, so exhausting.

us,Disparate Views Emerge Over North Korean Nuclear Strength," SEOUL, South Korea, June 2  Conflicting statements by a senior Pentagon official, United States congressmen returning from Pyongyang and South Koreas president deepened the sense of uncertainty today about the Korean nuclear standoff and prospects for war or peace on the Korean Peninsula. At issue was how far North Korea had gone in developing nuclear weapons, the degree to which it was bluffing and the depth of the United States basic commitment to South Koreans veering between insecurity about their defenses and uncertainty about United States intentions mingled with edginess about the continued American military presence. President Roh Moo Hyun of South Korea caught the mood in ambivalent remarks timed for the 100th day of his presidency in which he seemed to dispute United States intelligence estimates that the North has one or two nuclear warheads. Although North Korea had told American officials that it had developed nuclear weapons and reprocessed spent fuel rods, Mr. Roh said in remarks broadcast by Korean television networks, the North ""has not confirmed that to anyone else."" The deputy secretary of defense, Paul Wolfowitz, said after seeing Mr. Roh that such uncertainty reinforced the need for ""some way to verify what we know and those things we don't know."" In the meantime, he said, ""What we know suggests we should take what they say very seriously."" Representative Curt Weldon, Republican of Pennsylvania and vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, stopping here after leading six members of Congress on a visit to Pyongyang, reflected the the impressions that North Korea has been spreading in recent months of both its nuclear potential and its desire for dialogue with the United States. Senior North Korean officials had not only admitted having nuclear weapons, he said, but had confirmed they were expanding their nuclear weapons program and moreover had almost finished reprocessing 8,000 spent fuel rods. That claim, if correct, would enable the North to build several more nuclear warheads in a matter of months. The disparate views of North Korean nuclear strength underlined major differences among influential Americans, and also between the United States and South Korea, over how to respond to the North Korean threat in terms of a buildup of forces in the South, aid to North Korea and negotiations toward a brand new agreement under which the North would again promise to renounce nuclear weapons. Some analysts believe the resulting tensions form the prelude to a new chapter in which North Korea's economic difficulties may also help decide the outcome. ""We always talk about a critical juncture,"" said Kent Calder, director of Korean studies at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C. ""We are clearly on the eve of something major. This year will be the beginning. It's juche twilight"" -- a reference to the fading power of North Korea's philosophy of juche, meaning self-reliance. Some of the differences were clear from the contrast between the unbridled optimism reflected by the congressmen, including both Republicans and Democrats, and the preparations outlined by Mr. Wolfowitz for what he said would be a ""united, immediate and devastatingly effective"" answer to North Korean attack. Mr. Weldon said he and his congressional colleagues had left Pyongyang ""hugging our hosts"" after having managed ""to interact as friends and human beings with the people and the leaders of North Korea."" Although they did not meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, Mr. Weldon said, they had ""extensive and lengthy meetings"" with senior North Korean officials in which they had raised the issues of North Korean nuclear weapons, missiles and human rights ""in a spirit of assuring the North Koreans that we can prevent the crisis"" from ""escalating into a nuclear war."" He was convinced, he said, that ""there is a window of opportunity"" in which it should be possible to reach agreement with the North ""without having to resort to military conflict."" North Korean officials, he said, ""feel let down"" that they had not had the chance for ""bilateral talks"" with the United States, possibly in the context of multilateral talks. Mr. Weldon's remarks diverged sharply from United States efforts, promoted by Mr. Wolfowitz here and by President Bush at the Group of 8 meeting in France, at convincing North Korea there would be no alternative to five-party talks involving China, Russia, Japan and South Korea as well as the United States. Mr. Bush, after meeting China's president, Hu Jin Tao, said United States policy ""hasn't changed"" on the need to have all powers in the region at the negotating table. Mr. Wolfowitz outlined a program on the future of the American-Korean alliance that the United States command here has said will entail an $11 billion overhaul of American defense for South Korea. Any changes, he said, would necessarily affect the Second Infantry Division, a force of 16,000 troops, nearly half the 37,000 United States troops in the country, astride the invasion route between here and the line with North Korea, 30 miles to the north. It was time, he said, ""to move beyond outmoded concepts or catch phrases such as the term 'tripwire,' "" asSouth Koreans often describe the role of American forces in case of North Korean attack.Rather than keep a large force in one place, he said, ""We place a great premium on mobility, and on the ability to move great distances rapidly."" Mr. Wolfowitz was surprisingly critical of South Korea, however, for not contributing enough to its own defense. ""South Korea could certainly do more,"" he said, observing that South Korea's defense budget was only about 2.7 percent of its gross national product of approximately $500 billion. ""We're in this together, allies together,"" he said. ""We're investing to increase our capabilities,"" adding ""South Korea could do the same."" ",2003-06-02T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Meckler, who just months ago said he planned to put Comdex out of business, refused to explain the problem except to say, ''There's no contract and therefore there is no show. It's in abeyance.

The curfew ends at 5 a.m. A resident, Janet Ramos, challenged the ordinance on behalf of her sons Angel and Richard. On Monday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York ruled 2 to 1 that the authority to decide when children should be home resides with parents, not with local governments. ''Surely a parent can decide that a child must generally be home between midnight and 5 in the morning,'' Senior Judge Richard J. Cardamone wrote. But Judge Ralph K. Winter dissented, saying that the curfew helped parents in ''rebutting the 'all the other kids do it' argument.'' Paul von Zielbauer (NYT)",2003-06-04T05:00:00+0000

Rabbi Lupolianski, who was appointed acting mayor in February after the incumbent, Ehud Olmert, joined the national government, defeated Nir Barkat, a millionaire businessman, by 52 percent to 42 percent, according to unofficial results. In his victory speech, Rabbi Lupolianski promised not to alter the current balance between religious and secular Jews. His victory reflects the growing influence of the ultra-Orthodox in Jerusalem, who now account for around one-third of the city's 680,000 residents. Secular Jews also account for about a third, as do the Arabs who are concentrated in east Jerusalem. Greg Myre (NYT)",2003-06-05T05:00:00+0000

Besides the union, the United Federation of Teachers, the coalition includes the Community Service Society, the advocacy group Acorn, the Alliance for Quality Education, the United Parents Association and other groups. The coalition would have to collect at least 45,000 voters' signatures to put the question on the ballot. A spokesman for Chancellor Joel I. Klein said yesterday, ""By moving ahead with our Children First reforms we are continuing to reduce class size in our city schools.""

SBC and BellSouth, both leading providers of local phone service, are seeking to win back business from wireless carriers, including Cingular. SBC and BellSouth lost a combined 497,000 local lines in the first quarter as some customers started using cellphones, exclusively, to save money. The plan, called MinuteShare, is being tested in Texas and will be available later this year, SBC and BellSouth said yesterday. The alliance underlines phone companies' desire to attract customers in a shrinking market by linking products. Wireless companies like Cingular sell calling packages that include 900 minutes for as little as $39.99 a month. Under MinuteShare, a Cingular customer paying a fixed monthly fee for a certain number of minutes could use those minutes to make long-distance calls over the SBC or BellSouth networks, an SBC spokesman, Michael Coe, said. He declined to say how much the new call package would cost. SBC shares rose 35 cents, to $26.53. BellSouth shares fell 14 cents, to $26.89.&#0160;&#0160; (Bloomberg News) ",2003-06-06T05:00:00+0000

Analysts at the rating agency said the $92.8 billion budget passed by the State Legislature last month relied too much on borrowing to pay current bills. The budget also pushed the state's already high level of debt even higher, they said. Claire Cohen, the agency's top analyst of state bonds, said that there was little hope the state would reduce spending, since the Legislature had rejected most of the $2 billion in spending cuts that Gov. George E. Pataki had proposed and had raised taxes to restore them. She added that the $4.2 billion in new borrowing would simply forestall cuts, which made future shortfalls inevitable.

SBC and BellSouth, both leading providers of local phone service, are seeking to win back business from wireless carriers, including Cingular. SBC and BellSouth lost a combined 497,000 local lines in the first quarter as some customers started using cellphones, exclusively, to save money. The plan, called MinuteShare, is being tested in Texas and will be available later this year, SBC and BellSouth said yesterday. The alliance underlines phone companies' desire to attract customers in a shrinking market by linking products. Wireless companies like Cingular sell calling packages that include 900 minutes for as little as $39.99 a month. Under MinuteShare, a Cingular customer paying a fixed monthly fee for a certain number of minutes could use those minutes to make long-distance calls over the SBC or BellSouth networks, an SBC spokesman, Michael Coe, said. He declined to say how much the new call package would cost. SBC shares rose 35 cents, to $26.53. BellSouth shares fell 14 cents, to $26.89.",2003-06-06T05:00:00+0000

The ingenious plot delivers its first twist when the bathing beauty turns out to be a criminal profiler working on the case of a serial killer who dispatches his victims with a crossbow and dispenses clues from Coleridge's ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner.'' Being ''the kind of murderer who plans his crime like an architect, every detail worked out, measured and costed,'' the Mariner is a fit adversary for Peter Diamond, although no more of a handful, it seems, than the spirited women who play key roles in this shape-shifting case. The tough-minded homicide detective is entranced by the murder victim, whose keen brain and lusty sexual appetites are revealed in her journals, and bowled over by Anna Walpurgis, the earthy rock star he must protect from the Mariner. Never a slave to gender politics, he also makes a buddy of Inspector Henrietta Mallin, a brisk, boisterous, cigar-smoking colleague who can match him in pigheadedness and teach him how to take a joke.",2003-06-08T05:00:00+0000

McGreevey staff members said the increased tax burden would be reduced to $90 million from $135 million, but they did not say in what areas the proposal would be trimmed. The original plan was to raise the room tax for Atlantic City hotels and the tax on casino profits as well as adding a tax on the value of rooms and meals that the casinos give away to preferred customers. In recent weeks, the casinos have run television advertisements saying that the tax increases would stifle business in Atlantic City, which faces increased competition from gambling sites around the country.

But some leading foundations are terrified that the seemingly innocuous bill would virtually ensure their demise by forcing them to spend down their endowments faster than they can make money through investments. The foundations may well be ''crying wolf,'' but Congress needs to explore the consequences carefully before making a potentially momentous change.",2003-06-08T05:00:00+0000

us,'Long for This World'," It was a big old pleasant high school gym, built in the twenties and not much disturbed by renovation. The iron rafters met at a shallow angle at the roofline, and the tall windows were made up of a dozen big panes, each reinforced with chicken wire, and the two ancient clocks sat on opposing brick walls, ratcheting their works forward with an audible whir, hiss, clunk. The gym smelled nostalgically of varnish, sweat, and paint, but it was not an obsolete or shabby place. An electronic scoreboard reading garfield - visitors - quarter - fouls - time out had been added on the east wall, and a recent grant from FareWatchers.com had supplied the courtside officials with a new Huston-Marke computerized scoring system, a sleek blue box that sat beneath the long scorers' table and extended its heavy gray cables to an outlet hidden under the bleachers. The purple Garfield bulldog, wearing its studded collar, snarled up from the court's center circle, and the backboards were regulation glass, and the nets were in good repair, and when the boys played here a riotous, explosive sort of crowd would gather, and the breakaway rims actually got some use, and once in a while - once a decade or so - someone would appear who was so obviously superior to the rest of the boys that his future would be discussed with the frank and half-informed calculation any phenomenon inspires. The boys' team often played in the state tournament and had won it six years ago, and its purple banners hung from the rafters, drifting sideways when the big purple entry doors were left open to the hall.

us,Money 2003,"It's probably too late to invoke an updated version of that old Chinese curse: May you live in volatile times. We already do. But that's not to say that every one of us is riding the same wave, economically speaking -- or even that our own individual waves are all that big or dynamic. What we're in the midst of collectively is, to borrow a term economists use, idiosyncratic volatility. Which means that however the broader economy is moving -- maybe even up -- its component parts can be experiencing significant and wildly differing swings in fortune. As Harris Collingwood explains in ''The Sink-or-Swim Economy,'' the march toward ever-increasing efficiency at the macro level has meant spreading volatility around at the micro level. And that's what this issue is about: some individuals or groups cresting, others living in the trough. The newly rich in ''Suddenly Popular,'' by Stephen J. Dubner, have inherited their windfalls, putting them in the vanguard of the largest transfer of private wealth in history, while the states' governors and other local public officials in ''Drip, Drip, Drip,'' by Matt Bai, are inheriting only woe from Washington these days. To future generations, Peter G. Peterson argues, the Republican administration, in its tax-cutting zeal, is bequeathing debt, deficits and a legacy of abandoned fiscal stewardship. Elsewhere in these pages, Matthew Brzezinski, a contributing writer, recounts his own bankruptcy; Mitch Epstein, a photographer, offers pictures from the demise of Epstein Furniture, his family's business. A series of What They Were Thinking photographs presents both halves of pairs in which one is up, the other down. Home isn't the only place caught in the tidal pull of the American economy, obviously, and Peter Maass, in ''Meet the New Boss,'' introduces us to Dathar Khashab, who is (still) doing quite nicely as an engineer in Iraq's oil industry. But if there's one body that can always be counted on to thrive, it is that very set of people who explain why all these things happen to us: economists themselves. See ''Ivy Envy,'' by Mark Levine, for a look at how one university hopes to ride its economics department to the top.",2003-06-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Lacquer on Everything,"Like the spare and prescribed movements of a Japanese tea ceremony, the stories in THE LAWS OF EVENING (Scribner, $21), Mary Yukari Waters's first collection, present a deceptively smooth and elegant surface. Underneath this unruffled exterior, however, the smallest nuances convey real depth of feeling. ''The Laws of Evening'' moves in a cohesive arc from ''Seed,'' in which the drumming made by a procession of Chinese prisoners announces the end of a housewife's cloistered prewar life, to ''Mirror Studies,'' which observes the popularity of nostalgic ''wartime'' cuisine among jaded city dwellers. In between, a series of Japanese men and women grow old in the wake of their generation's great calamity. Alone late in life, the narrator of the title story spends evenings wandering the grounds of a temple, her mind floating through a world gone pleasantly abstract: ''Having little left to lose, little left to desire, had lifted her onto a halcyon mountaintop from which she saw all the sufferings of mankind blending beautifully, like tiny trees, into the landscape below.'' In ''Aftermath,'' a war widow struggles to salvage her memories in a country that seems bent on forgetting as quickly as possible, while ''Rationing'' explores the demands strong emotions place on a father and son unaccustomed to such exercise: ''It reminded him of track days: anguish escalating unbearably in oxygen-deprived lungs, the blind rush down the homestretch on legs that were too slow.'' Measured, deliberate and often nearly plotless, these stories require a certain patience, and the delicacy of their construction is not always apparent until the second reading. But such effort is amply repaid. You come away from this collection wondering, like the scientists in ''Mirror Studies,'' ''Isn't life a resilient force . . . turning the worst of its disasters into something like this?''

As it crosscuts between tacky Los Angeles, refined Paris and rural England, this British novel artfully interweaves two seemingly unrelated stories: the first about a former teacher dying of cancer and the return of her two sons, the second about a gay Hungarian playwright filled with regret for his actions during the 1956 revolution. ''Only a writer of verve and talent would be able to pull off the creation of such varied milieus, and happily, Miller is such a writer,'' Margot Livesey wrote here in 2002.

us,The Back Page; Play Ball! (Just Don't Get Caught),"FOR as long as there has been sport, there has been cheating and few sports have developed as rich a history in chicanery and fraud as baseball. Some of these smudges on the game's reputation were made brazenly: the Chicago Black Sox scandal of 1919, for instance, or Pete Rose's gambling. Other cases have been decidedly less grand, as when rubber balls came bouncing out of a broken bat, or when a pitcher dropped an emery board on the mound. And of course, many tactics occupy that gray area of sport where aggression and dirty play, ingenuity and flat-out cheating blur. Sammy Sosa's corked bat falls squarely outside that gray area, but even his eight-game suspension, which was immediately appealed after being handed down on Friday, is not likely to provide an object lesson for other players. Cheating, after all, is steeped in tradition. Highlights from some of baseball's greatest moments in foul play follow. TOM ZELLER",2003-06-08T05:00:00+0000

Since Bruce's martyrdom to mid-century prudery, stand-up has emerged out of the nightclubs, from which Bruce was often forcibly removed by vice officers, and moved onto basic cable, where the race to be America's favorite problem child is on. And so we have arrived at Jimmy Kimmel's wide-eyed realization that virtually no whim, however inane, will find itself punished by the network suits.

us,Midwood Takes New York City Softball Championship," Midwood High School Coach Artie Leitner thought this would be a rebuilding year because his softball team had lost five starters to graduation. Almost one month into the season, pitcher Dawn Duggan thought the Hornets would have difficulty advancing past the quarterfinals in the Public Schools Athletic League playoffs. Yesterday, they became New York City champions. Duggan, a junior who pitched every inning of every game this season, scattered six hits and the freshman Jo Marie Sinagria scored the games only run as sixth-seeded Midwood of Brooklyn defeated top-seeded Tottenville of Staten Island, 1-0, at St. Johns University to win its first city championship. At the beginning of the year, I thought that this team had a lot of potential, but I never expected anything like this, Leitner said. The Hornets (23-7) scored in the third inning. With runners on first and second and two outs, left fielder Lauren Kantouris hit a sharp single to right field off Tottenvilles Allison Castellucci. Sinagria, running from second, stopped at third, then saw that the ball had been misplayed in the outfield and headed home. The throw from the outfield was on line but late, and the Hornets had the lead. But they had to sweat out the final four innings as Tottenville (19-3) put runners in scoring position in three of them. With two outs in the seventh, Nicole Composto singled to right field and advanced to second on an error with two outs. But Duggan struck out pinch-hitter Joanna Pellicchia on three pitches to seal the victory. ",2003-06-08T05:00:00+0000

That's why many economists, among them Jeffrey Frankel, a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, are inclined to dismiss today's complaints about economic stress and anxiety.

us,Prospect Theory,"From the infamous Dutch tulip hysteria of the 17th century to the Great Depression to the dot-com crash, wild bouts of speculation have occasionally inflated big fat financial bubbles that soaked investors when they burst. Daniel Kahneman, a professor at Princeton who was the first psychologist to win the Nobel in economics (which he was awarded last year for studies he conducted with Amos Tversky), has attributed market manias partly to investors' ''illusion of control.'' Kahneman recently explained the basic weirdness of the dot-com bomb to The Financial Times: ''A high percentage of investors knew it was a bubble and still invested because they thought they could get out in time.'' Why did so few heed the alarms? According to Kahneman's ''prospect theory,'' most of us find losses roughly twice as painful as we find gains pleasurable. This radical precept subverts much of ''utility theory,'' the longstanding economic doctrine that says we weigh gain and loss rationally. When combined with the reality that some market winners display the same recklessness as some victorious gamblers -- a phenomenon that Richard Thaler, an economist at the University of Chicago, calls ''the house-money effect'' -- the market is often revealed to be downright loony. Indeed, the findings of ''behavioral finance'' in recent years have increasingly challenged the fundamental rationality assumed by defenders of ''efficient markets,'' those who believe Eugene Fama's famous dictum that prices ''fully reflect available information.'' Fama, another economist from the University of Chicago, is saying that you can't get ahead of the market by building a clever model, because you can't predict the news that will affect prices. (As for the crazy players, Fama has contended that big-time rational arbitrageurs counterbalance them.) So, as stocks have shown some new life this spring, can you put your trust back in the market?",2003-06-08T05:00:00+0000

But they have found plenty of proof that Iraq suffered under a brutal dictator who slaughtered thousands, perhaps tens or hundreds of thousands of his own people, and that is reason enough to justify the invasion. We disagree. We are as pleased as anyone to see Saddam Hussein removed from power, but the United States cannot now simply erase from the record the Bush administration's dire warnings about the Iraqi weapons threat. The good word of the United States is too central to America's leadership abroad -- and to President Bush's dubious doctrine of pre-emptive warfare -- to be treated so cavalierly.",2003-06-08T05:00:00+0000

The state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, argued that the city should have studied the environmental impact of particulate emissions as small as 2.5 microns. Instead, the city studied larger emissions. The state appeals court found on Thursday that there was no technologically feasible method to evaluate the smaller particulate emissions at that time. A spokeswoman for the city's Sanitation Department, Kathy Dawkins, said its trucks in Manhattan and the Bronx switched to ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel last year to reduce emissions and would expand that to all its routes in the next few years.

He found that recipients faced excessive waits in getting services like rent assistance and that the city's case managers had too many cases. Yesterday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the decision.

A company spokesman, Kipp A. Bedard, speaking at a Bear Stearns technology conference in New York, also said that Micron customers had indicated that they were shipping more personal computers this quarter than they had expected. Micron is cutting costs as part of a restructuring that stems partly from the worst downturn in demand for semiconductors on record. The chip company, which plans to close a Virginia plant, cut some product lines and trimmed its work force but has not posted a profit in more than two years. Mr. Bedard said Micron now expected to beat its earlier projections for production growth. In March, the company told investors to expect third-quarter production to grow by a percentage in the ""midteens"" over the second quarter. Mr. Bedard said the company expected capital spending to be close to $1.1 billion, rather than the $1 billion it had previously forecast. Shares of Micron rose 84 cents, or 6.8 percent, to $13.15.

''We can have them made to order if we want.'' But no two are alike. Buyers include military officers as well as civilians like Peter Roy, a lawyer in Ellsworth, Me.

The company cut 130 jobs, a 15 percent reduction, in April after first-quarter sales missed its forecast.

The agency cited concerns about how the unit was approving loans, pointing out that the bank has forced a borrower, New Nongkai Global Investments Ltd., into bankruptcy a little less than a year after extending it a loan of $270 million, with $95 million of that still outstanding as of June 5. The downgrading is a humiliation for the Bank of China, one of China's four main state-owned banks; all of them are plagued with bad debts on the mainland. Bank of China made an initial public offering of shares in the Hong Kong unit last summer, with UBS Warburg, Goldman Sachs and Bank of China International as the lead managers.

The agency cited concerns about how the unit was approving loans, pointing out that the bank has forced a borrower, New Nongkai Global Investments Ltd., into bankruptcy a little less than a year after extending it a loan of $270 million, with $95 million of that still outstanding as of June 5. The downgrading is a humiliation for the Bank of China, one of China's four main state-owned banks; all of them are plagued with bad debts on the mainland. Bank of China made an initial public offering of shares in the Hong Kong unit last summer, with UBS Warburg, Goldman Sachs and Bank of China International as the lead managers.

For his first store outside Brazil, he wanted a space where fashion, architecture and art could meet -- reflecting his own interests as couturier and performance, installation and video artist. Asymptote (known for virtual environments, furniture and exhibitions) has renovated the trading floor for the New York Stock Exchange, and created HydraPier, an exhibition pavilion in the Netherlands. For Mr. Miele, the architects made a dreamy, melting landscape, above, whose Arctic palette makes the intricate clothing -- body-baring fashions blending primitive and high-tech materials and processes -- appear like a chimera. The store's drippy heat-formed plastic ceiling and swirl-patterned epoxy floor echo work of Brazilian modernists like Oscar Niemeyer and Roberto Burle Marx.

Having avoided detection by the Allies for three months since the outbreak of hostilities, it was their great misfortune to head straight for the Falklands just hours after the British fleet put in to coal there. Had they borne in and launched an offensive, they would have caught the British in the disarray of refueling. Instead, and for unknown reasons, all eight ships, under the command of Vice Admiral Graf Von Spee, tried to flee. Compounding this fatal decision was atypical weather-a bright, cloudless sky hung overhead; there were neither the usual fog banks nor the low-lying squall clouds to afford even momentary concealment. The British, with their superior cruisers, were quick to pursue. From all sides gunfire bombarded the Germans. After three hours of battle, Von Spee's flagship, the Scharnhorst, turned over on her beam, heeled gradually to port, and slid into the icy Atlantic, a cloud of black smoke shooting up from the boilers as she submerged. Only a coal collier, which was later interned in Argentina, and the small cruiser Dresden, which was to be run down and blown up in three months, escaped the fiery battle. Within hours, the rest of the squadron met its fate at the bottom of the sea. ",2003-06-15T05:00:00+0000

us,What Would Ernst Lubitsch Have Done?,"A famous sign on the wall in Billy Wilder's office asked, ''What would Lubitsch have done?'' Wilder meant the question as a tribute to Ernst Lubitsch, his master, mentor and sometime boss -- a comic filmmaker whose elegant and effortless command represented, to Wilder and many others, the apogee of cinematic wit, sophistication and technical precision. These qualities are what critics mean when they talk about ''the Lubitsch touch,'' which is also the name of the three-week retrospective that began on Friday at Film Forum. The phrase, which honors Lubitsch's light tone and meticulous pacing, also implies a limiting judgment, as if he were, in the end, little more than a playful, skillful technician. It would never do, of course, to speak of ''the Lubitsch vision,'' ''the Lubitsch ideology'' or ''the Lubitsch Weltanschauung'' -- such talk would be soundly and justly mocked in one of his pictures -- but his unerring jokes and deftly plotted conundrums have an undertow of unsettling wisdom.

It marked -- if it did not initiate -- the moment when documentary filmmakers started giving their full attention to Hitler's planned extermination of the Jews. ''When I began exploring how films have grappled with the Holocaust in 1979, there were merely a few dozen titles to warrant attention,'' Annette Insdorf writes in her encyclopedic study ''Indelible Shadows: Film and the Holocaust.'' But for the book's third edition, published this year, she lists, together with the fiction films, 69 documentaries made since 1990 alone -- a rate of almost one every two months. Elsewhere she estimates that there are at least six completed Holocaust documentaries that do not get distribution for every one that does. And the stream has continued at flood tide into 2003. Last month ''Secret Lives,'' Aviva Slesin's emotionally complex film about Jewish children hidden by gentile families during the Nazi era, opened in New York. Shortly after, PBS showed Charles Guggenheim's ''Berga: Soldiers of Another War,'' about Jewish-American soldiers captured by the Germans. ''Bonhoeffer,'' Martin Doblmeier's intellectual, spiritually suffused account of the anti-Nazi German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, is opening on June 27, two days before A & E broadcasts Liz Garbus's ''Nazi Officer's Wife,'' the biography of a Jewish woman who survived by assuming an Aryan identity and marrying a Nazi party member.",2003-06-15T05:00:00+0000

Lehman. Born in Germany, he emigrated to the United States in 1938. Rabbi Lehman was a graduate of Stuyvesant High School and was ordained from Hebrew Union College in 1954. He served with distinction as our Rabbi for 41 years. After his retirement he served as an interim Rabbi at both Or Chadash in Vienna, Austria, and later at Temple Israel in Lawrence, LI. Rabbi Lehman earned his Doctor of Ministry degree from the New York Theological Seminary in 1985. As a member of the Central Conference of American Rabbis he served on several of its national committees. He was President of both the New York Association of Reform Rabbis and the American Federation of Jews from Central Europe. He worked tirelessly on the Executive Committee of the World Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors.

us,The News From Spain,"How 17th-century Spanish painting came to influence late 19th-century French art is brilliantly illuminated in MANET/VELZQUEZ: The French Taste for Spanish Painting (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Yale University, $75). Spanish paintings, with their blend of mysticism and earthy naturalism, were prized for their scarcity in France at the start of the 19th century, when few had actually been seen. Soon thereafter, Napoleon plundered hundreds of these paintings from Spanish churches, palaces and monasteries, and for the first time these works by Velzquez, Zurbarn, Goya and Murillo were exhibited in Paris. Even when the war loot was returned to Spain after Napoleon's abdication, the paintings stayed in the public eye as the core of the Prado, formed in 1819. Spanish bounty ricocheted once more to France, purchased this time by King Louis Philippe, who put his 400 paintings on view in the Galerie Espagnole at the Louvre in 1838 (10 years later politics once again ousted the ruler and the paintings). Gary Tinterow, a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, argues that direct contact with these anticlassical works infected young French artists with the germ of modernism. Delacroix, ruminating on Velzquez, recorded in his journal around 1824, ''I'd like to spread some nice oily, thick paint across a brown or red canvas.'' That same visceral quality about Spanish painting would grip Manet, who after visiting the Prado in 1865 wrote about a portrait by Velzquez: ''There's nothing but air surrounding the fellow, who is all in black and appears alive.''

Maybe it was a consolation prize for parents whose kids can't get enough of games like ''Grand Theft Auto 3,'' ''Rogue Spear'' and ''Medal of Honor,'' where the object is to terminate with extreme prejudice as many enemies as you can. Regular players of action video games may be wreaking virtual mayhem, but they also have awesome peripheral vision and can keep track of lots of objects at once (though not necessarily the ones their parents want them to keep track of).

All-consuming news stories have been a staple of our culture even further back than the Lindbergh kidnapping, but the advent of competing, 24/7 cable news networks and the Internet had produced a thicker, faster-paced infotainment spectacle by the mid-1990's.

The skulls roughly coincide with what genetic evidence suggests is ''the origin of modern human variation,'' as one scientist puts it, and they date from a period when the fossil evidence for hominids is extremely thin.

The crash occurred at 5:19 p.m. when the 1999 BMW was turning from East Merrick Road on to Cornwell Avenue and was struck by the van, a Chevrolet. The BMW veered out of control and slid sideways, hitting a parking meter and utility pole on the north side of Merrick Road. The BMW became engulfed in flames, but not before a witness ran to the wreckage and pulled the unconscious body of the driver free, investigators said. The two other occupants were pronounced dead at the scene. The driver was taken to a nearby hospital, but his condition was not known early this morning, according to Officer Adele Burke, a police spokeswoman.

Gov. Tim Pawlenty signed the authorization bill on Thursday. Construction is to start late this summer, and the complex, its estimated total cost at $125 million, is expected to open in 2005. The Guthrie, founded in 1963, is one of the leading regional theaters in the United States and a center of cultural life in and around Minneapolis. The theater's artistic director, Joe Dowling, said new complex would allow the Guthrie to continue presenting classic drama while offering more space for touring works, new plays and educational programs. ''To say we are overjoyed is an understatement,'' he said. The French architect Jean Nouvel has completed a design for the complex, which will overlook the Mississippi River. Theater officials have raised $64.5 million from private donors, and Charles Zelle, board chairman, said he would try to make up the remainder by a combination of cost-cutting and additional fund-raising.

It would gain a cancer drug that is in the final stages of clinical trials. Novuspharma's leading drug, Pixantrone, which is being tested for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, may have fewer side effects than other chemotherapy drugs in the class known as anthracyclines, Cell Therapeutics said. James A. Bianco, chief executive of Cell Therapeutics, said Pixantrone might reach the market by 2005 or 2006 and complement his company's Trisenox, which is on the market, and Xyotax, the company's experimental treatment for lung cancer. Separately, Cell Therapeutics said that federal regulators would speed their review of Xyotax. The company said in a statement the drug received fast-track status from the Food and Drug Administration. Xyotax is being tested in two late-stage, or Phase III, clinical trials for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, which accounts for almost 80 percent of lung cancer cases. The company's shares rose $1.73, or 13 percent, to $14.75. Andrew Pollack (NYT)",2003-06-17T05:00:00+0000

us,World Business Briefing | Europe: Belgium: Competition Rankings,"Europe's competition regulators rank fourth in the world, behind the United States, Germany and Britain, according to a new survey by the British trade journal Global Competition Review. The commission was considered weaker in economics than its American counterparts. This weakness was highlighted last year when the European Commission lost three court cases. The commission was also seen as more instinctively interventionist than the American authorities, according to the survey, which covered 500 executives, lawyers and competition officials. Last year the commission levied about 944 million euros ($1.11 billion) in antitrust fines. American officials levied $102 million in fines. American antitrust procedures, however, were regarded as less open than European procedures and more prone to political interference, the survey said. Paul Meller (NYT)",2003-06-18T05:00:00+0000

In their decision on Tuesday, Judges James L. Oakes, Guido Calabresi and Robert D.

The Justice Department asked the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to uphold a lower court ruling that the Computer and Communications Industry Association and the Software and Information Industry Association lacked legal standing to challenge the settlement. The two groups had filed friend-of-the-court briefs with Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly arguing in favor of stricter sanctions against Microsoft. In January, Judge Kollar-Kotelly said the trade groups could file a private case against the world's biggest software company if they wanted to pursue the matter further. The appeals court had ruled in June 2001 that Microsoft had illegally maintained its Windows operating system monopoly, but rejected a trial court proposal to break the company in two. In the settlement approved by Judge Kollar-Kotelly last year, Microsoft agreed to measures that include giving computer makers greater freedom to feature rival software by allowing them to hide some Microsoft icons on the Windows desktop.

''The prices were too good to pass up,'' Graham Head, the president of ABC, said. ''The rug dealers in Nepal were rug-rich and cash-poor.'' Each week a container of 800 rugs will arrive at ABC. Patterns are not copies of traditional tribal rugs, but are contemporary, like the mosaic 8-by-10-foot rug above ($899). They range from 2 by 4 feet to 12 by 15 feet. Prices are $110 to $5,400. Two years ago, the rugs would have been $250 to $11,000. The sale will continue until all the rugs are sold. ABC Carpet, 888 Broadway (19th Street); (212) 473-3000.

Anti-monarchist German immigrants established a tradition of liberalism (in the early 1900's Golda Meir spent her formative years in Milwaukee, absorbing socialist vibes), and activism endures in lively local politics. Other German immigrants started rolling out barrels in the 1840's, and Milwaukee still enjoys its famous locally brewed beer.

The three were severely injured. In Paris, the police detained nearly 100 people to prevent further attempts at self-immolation and banned demonstrations by the group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Mujahedeen. One woman was reported to have died of her injuries after she set herself on fire in Paris a day earlier.

His was a meticulous homage, beautifully shot, brilliantly acted -- it wasn't far from a masterpiece -- and yet, something went missing: Dennis Haysbert's gardener was so noble, and so genteel, that he was almost unreal. Julianne Moore's betrayed housewife was equally noble and genteel, and their love affair was unlike any affair that most of us have known. Watching it unfold, there was never a doubt that the two were meant to be together, and that the racism keeping them apart was evil.",2003-06-22T05:00:00+0000

us,'At War With Ourselves'," George W. Bush seemed surprised to get any applause at all. Gazing out at his audience at the United Nations, the president gave what an aide described as his ""trademark smirk"" as the delegates clapped coolly. There was a definite chill in the air. Only a year before, America had been bathed in sympathy from around the world after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Hundreds of thousands of Germans had gathered at the Brandenburg Gate, the site of JFK's ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" speech, to say that they now stood with America. France's Le Monde newspaper, normally no friend of Washington's, declared, ""We are all Americans today."" But this was September 12, 2002, a year and a day after the attacks, and the mood was very different. Other nations were angry at what they perceived to be American arrogance, the Bush administration's insistence on carrying a big stick-U.S. might-and talking loudly at the same time. This same week Bush would issue a new national security strategy, one that would mark the most historic shift in American thinking since the early days of the Cold War. While couched in diplomatic language, it was an unprecedentedly frank assertion that American dominance was here to stay, and that it was American values that would define the world.

us,'When Hollywood Had a King'," On a spring day in Chicago in 1922, two young men stood deep in conversation on the sidewalk outside the headquarters of Local 10, a branch of the American Federation of Musicians union. They might have conferred inside the building instead-one of them, James Caesar Petrillo, was the local's vice president-but he thought the walls had ears, and the message he wanted to deliver was confidential. He had sent word to his companion, Jules Caesar Stein, that he wanted to see him. Stein was a recent medical school graduate who booked bands on the side, and, in his relatively short career, he had already run afoul of the musicians union, and gotten caught in the crossfire of Chicago's ongoing, internecine labor wars. It seemed, moreover, to be Petrillo's fire that had caught Stein; the bombs that had recently exploded at several Chinese restaurants where Stein was booking bands were Petrillo's handiwork, Stein was convinced. At one of them, the Canton Tea Garden on Wabash, the damage had been especially severe. But the nature of the band-booking business-and more, of the city itself-was such that Stein had little recourse. If he wanted to continue in this business, he had to make his peace with this, the dominant musicians union. So he was eager to hear what Petrillo had to say. ",2003-06-22T05:00:00+0000

us,'A Palestine Affair'," 1. Bloomberg came out of the house in North Talpiot and bicycled toward the Arab village of Abu Tor. After ten minutes or so he dismounted and found a spot where the moonlight shone brightest on a stone wall. It was a clear night. He unstrapped his artist's box and retrieved his pallete. Back in London Joyce had carefully, kindly numbered the tubes in white so that he would be able to continue to paint even when the light grew dim. He couldn't love her anymore, although he wished that he could. His withdrawal from his wife was almost embarrassing-a man Bloomberg's age shouldn't be so damaged by the death of his mother. But he was. Late night at the London Hospital, the sky a sheet of midnight blue in the rain-streaked window beside her bed, and his mother, suddenly alert, recognizing him for the first time in weeks: ""I will always remember you,"" she'd said. But of course it was the other way round. It was Bloomberg who would always remember her: the immigrant boy's mother ship and protector, the sails of her broad skirts and him cowering in the hold, gripping the cloth, his face pressed to the side of her leg. Meanwhile, as he mourned, Joyce continued to make small supportive gestures that made him feel sick inside. Her concern and consideration only highlighted his impoverishment of feeling. He was numb to her, and haunted. His mother wasn't the only ghost. Her death had released the others. Six years on from the war's end and here were his dead friends, appearing, like Banquo's ghost, mutilated and bloody, whenever his head snapped into a dream or reverie: Jacob Rosen, his ripped face covered in tawny phlegm; Gideon Schiff, his sweet smile intact but not his body.

Since then, the county has cut spending by $15 million and raised the county property tax by 15 percent. Mr. Spano declined to be interviewed through his spokeswoman. Richard G.

us,The Road to Yossarian,"With ''Catch-22,'' Joseph Heller (1923-99) delivered perhaps the most original and sardonic war novel of the previous century and added to the cultural lexicon. But his beginnings as a short-story writer are less well known. In CATCH AS CATCH CAN: The Collected Stories and Other Writings (Simon & Schuster, $25), the editors, Matthew J. Bruccoli and Park Bucker, bring us a selection of Heller's earliest fiction -- some of it originally appeared in magazines like Esquire and The Atlantic Monthly -- that includes five previously unpublished stories. As its title implies, ''Catch as Catch Can'' is something of a grab bag. In Heller's juvenilia we see experiments with style and detect hints of the irreverent, frenzied voice that he would eventually make his own. ''A Day in the Country,'' for example, reaches a kind of crescendo of panic as it expresses a heroin addict's anguish. ''MacAdam's Log'' tells of a lonely grandfather who, desperate for a purpose, embarks on imagined sea voyages. And ''Bookies, Beware!'' records how a college student uses ''pure science'' to pick winners at the track. Heller's signature absurdism surfaces only in the later work, notably in a handful of stories and a one-act play spun from his masterpiece. The author's comments on ''Catch-22'' and an affecting essay about growing up in Coney Island make up the rest of this scattered but occasionally fascinating book.

Chronologically she was 72, but her intellectual presence was always with the here and now. Marilyn was born into a conservative midwestern culture in Tiffin, OH. By her college years at Denison she had become a confirmed liberal and activist in Democratic politics that lasted the rest of her lifetime. She was a living example that a first rate public school education could match up with the best that private institutions could produce. Having a wonderful sense of humor she could laugh at a remonstrance of having ''leftist'' views and lived with the premise ''protect me from zealots of any stripe.'' An omnivorous reader and naturally fast, she loved the libraries in whatever community she lived in, often taking a half dozen books at a time for a week's reading. Marilyn could be scathingly effective in argument but she always looked for the best in people. Her greatest compliment to anyone was that ''he has no side.'' We miss her physical presence, but she will always be part of our lives. Her last words ''so what are you thinking?'' provoke staggering introspection. She is survived by her husband James, daughter Claire Wolfenden of Hillsborough, CA, son Stone of Las Vegas, NV, son J.T. of Newport Beach, CA, two granddaughters Abby and Page Wolfenden, sister Mary Radigan of Vermont, and sister Peggy Walker of Florida.

The woman at the very top of the picture, at the very top of the star, was Sylvia Plath, who immortalized the guest editor program in her autobiographical novel, ''The Bell Jar.''

This season, despite (or perhaps because of) dangerously short lengths and body-hugging silhouettes, miniskirts are more popular than ever. They are ''not for the self-conscious,'' cautions Jenny Altman, a freelance fashion stylist, who says slim hips and ''the legs of a 20-year-old, even if you're not a 20-year-old'' certainly help.

The new Harry Potter, ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' went on sale yesterday, and at 896 pages, it is significantly longer than Potter IV (''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''), which was already a serious doorstop. Any day now we can expect to see 9- and 10-year-olds with painfully elongated arms and curved spines from trying to haul the new volume around, or with crushed ribs and bruised sternums from trying to prop it up on their frail, undeveloped chests. If the new book catches on, that is. Potter's publisher, Scholastic, has already printed 8.5 million copies, more than twice as many as the first printing of Potter IV, and advance sales are similarly way ahead of those for the earlier volume. But some booksellers are concerned that the fad may have finally played itself out, and that the two Potter movies in particular have stripped the books of some of their magic.

us,Blue Men of Scotland,"Nine-year-old Tiffany Aching, a farm girl, has decided that she wants to be a witch when she grows up, despite being saddled with a name that she suspects won't work as a witch-worthy moniker because ''people would laugh.'' But Terry Pratchett provides no fancy schools or well-funded training programs for young witches in THE WEE FREE MEN (HarperCollins, $16.99; ages 12 and up), only the power of dreams -- both real and imaginary. In the very first chapter, Tiffany resourcefully uses her sticky little brother, Wentworth, as bait to smack a toothy green sea monster in the face with a frying pan. This minor adventure brings her to the attention of Miss Tick, a full-fledged witch who gives Tiffany some tips about what being a witch is really about: ''Witches don't use magic unless they really have to. It's hard work and difficult to control. . . . A witch pays attention to everything that's going on.'' As Tiffany mulls all this over, she meets a rowdy band of six-inch-tall, kilt-wearing blue men who call themselves the Nac Mac Feegle, or the Wee Free Men, who speak lovingly in their thick Scottish accents about stealing and fighting. Later, when Tiffany must prove herself and rescue Wentworth from the clutches of an evil queen from another dimension, the Wee Free Men and a cranky talking toad with a flair for legal terminology serve as her guides and companions on her quest in the strange land. With its wry wit and acerbic collision of the mystical with the mundane, the latest book in Pratchett's internationally popular Discworld series of fantasy novels, this one specially for young adults, is good solid storytelling done in a style that reads like Celtic mythology fused with the girl power of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' with dialogue by Robert Burns.

Only that he's 20 and what the N.B.A. auditors of flesh and bone call ''a freak'' enabled him to even imagine that he could make this play. From a little triangular section of seats right behind the Suns bench, reserved for homeboys, lovers, swindlers and kin, Stoudemire's people looked on. Among them was Marwan Stoudemire, Amare's 14-year-old half-brother, whom Amare brought west with him from central Florida and enrolled in a private Phoenix day school. Marwan is not a freak. He wears a metal cast of the Cartoon Network antihero ''The Brain'' on a chain around his neck, has a heartbreaking smile and soft, ancient eyes, and if anything, he is small and slight for a ninth grader.

Up he scrambled, past the lower deck gun ports and an instant stink of stale humanity and bilge water, past the main deck ports, until at last he hauled himself on to the upper deck which suddenly appeared, smooth and shining white under its great banded masts and filigree rigging, the air heavy with the mingled aromas of wood, rope, tar, paint and metal.

Growth in the overall market has slowed as customers look to a smaller number of suppliers that can offer a broad range of functions.

Officials of Geac, which got its start as a mainframe computer maker, said the Comshare deal would help further transform the company into a broad-based supplier of business planning software, and return it to sales growth next year after three successive years of declines. Geac shares fell 13 cents, or 2.3 percent, to 5.50 Canadian dollars ($4.05). Shares of Comshare rose 92 cents, or 25.3 percent, to $4.56. (Reuters) ",2003-06-24T05:00:00+0000

Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, had predicted a hole almost that large would open up in the budget later this year. But Mr. Hevesi said the governor had been right about deficits in the next two fiscal years, which the comptroller estimated would be $5.3 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. James C.

A graduate of Fordham Preparatory School, Columbia College and the University of Notre Dame, he maintained a life-long love of history. From 1958 to 1989 he was a financial manager for the Dept. of the Navy, mostly with the Office of Naval Research. He was a charter member of the Senior Executive Service. A committed and knowledgeable community activist, he served on the Arlington Planning Commission in the 1970's, as well as on the Fiscal Affairs Committee. Upon retirement, Tom began a distinguished second career as a volunteer. In 1989, he and a small group of friends founded the Arlington Partnership for Affordable Housing (APAH); Tom was the organization's first CEO. When APAH was well established, he turned his time and attention to the Arlington Street People's Assistance Network (ASPAN) where he served as treasurer until 2001. Tom's home and family were cherished by him, and he worked diligently to help others know that kind of comfort. In 1997, Arlington County recognized him as the first community hero, for his work on behalf of the vulnerable members of society. He leaves behind his beloved wife of 46 years, Dolores (Conklin) and his dear children Mary Kate Marcellus, her husband Ronald and their sons Cameron and Conor; Dr. Celia Leckey and her son Samuel X.

Dr. McEwen graduated from the School of Medicine in 1926, completed his internship at Bellevue Hospital and joined the faculty in 1932. In 1937, at the age of thirty-five, he became the youngest man ever to be appointed Dean of a leading American medical school, up to that time. His service as Dean was interrupted during WWII, when he served as a Colonel with the renowned Bellevue Hospital Unit. Before retiring as Dean in 1955, Dr. McEwen's many accomplishments included the establishment of what is now NYU Medical Center. He was one of the nation's leading authorities on rheumatic diseases, and through his research, patient care and academic pursuits, he made many outstanding contributions to this field. Dr. McEwen retired in 1970 as Professor of Medicine. He embodied the finest traditions of the medical profession throughout his career, and his many years of service to NYU will always be remembered with respect and admiration. Robert M.

The deal, to be announced today, was prompted in part by the terror attack of Sept. 11, when NYU Medical Center had to evacuate its main data center in Lower Manhattan. The I.B.M. pact also includes several other research and information management projects. Richard Prez-Pea (NYT)",2003-06-26T05:00:00+0000

Qwest and other regional phone companies must prove they have opened networks to rivals in states where they are the dominant local carriers before they can sell long distance in those areas. Qwest is now cleared to offer long-distance service in 13 of 14 states where it is the largest local operator, leaving Arizona as the only state where it needs approval from the Federal Communications Commission. The big local carriers are trying to sell more long-distance services after losing millions of lines to AT&T and other, new competitors in the local market. Minnesota regulators had argued for rejection of Qwest's application because of the company's failure to disclose discounts given to two local rivals who rent parts of Qwest's network in the state. Those actions resulted in a $26 million state fine that Qwest is appealing. Shares of Qwest rose 13 cents, to $4.90.",2003-06-27T05:00:00+0000

On those rare occasions when it has merited any national coverage, journalists have snickered at the city's beady-eyed provincialism (the Robert Mapplethorpe trial), the outspoken former owner of the Reds (Marge Schott) who was forced out of baseball, and a pro football franchise that has become a punch line (the Bengals). The city's most visible export to the nation at large is probably Jerry Springer, who served as mayor from 1977 to 1981 and had his first talk show at the Westin Hotel on Fountain Square. Larry Flynt started Hustler magazine in this buttoned-up Republican burg. Not so funny is a history of racial polarization that gutted the downtown in the 70's and led to riots against police brutality in 2001. Well, for once the news from Cincinnati is upbeat and decidedly not sleazy. New art and architectural projects have put the city back on the cultural map. These attractions complement a distinguished group of well-established institutions, including the country's second oldest opera company.

John Baldacci signed legislation that requires the state to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2010, and an additional 10 percent by 2020, making Maine the first state to pass a comprehensive law addressing global warming. The legislation is one of a number of state-level climate change initiatives that have emerged since the United States pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol. Maine officials said they were motivated partly by evidence that climate change might already be affecting the state's environment. According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the average temperature in Lewiston has risen by 3.4 degrees in the past century, and rainfall has fallen by up to 20 percent in many parts of the state.

Washington State passed a law last month aimed at keeping children from buying games that depict violence against police, more than two years after St. Louis banned the sale of violent titles to minors. The ban was struck down by a United States appeals court, which said the measure was prohibited by the Constitution.

So I do not know how my dreams end, and it might be inconsiderate of me to tell you about them, knowing that I can offer neither conclusion nor lesson. But they strike me as both inventive and vivid.

A few minutes later, as we walked up a quiet lane toward the theater's backstage entrance, the proprietor of a rival coffeehouse popped onto the sidewalk with his camera, requesting a snapshot of Mr. James for his establishment's collection of celebrity portraits. Then, a few paces on, a nervous, eager man appeared with a large red autograph book, a rubber band marking the page reserved for Mr. James, who took all the unsolicited attention with the gracious, faintly self-mocking air of one long accustomed to the intrusions and obligations of fame, making genial small talk and duly signing whatever was put in front of him.",2003-06-29T05:00:00+0000

us,A Brotherhood of Ham,"When I was 12 years old I failed my amateur radio license test three times because I could not master Morse code. I wanted desperately to be a ham, so I saved up, bought an old Hallicrafters shortwave rig and made up my own call sign, which I then had printed on QSL cards -- personal calling cards that ham operators mail to each other to confirm their airwave encounters. Hams wallpapered their radio shacks with these cards to show just how far and to whom they reached. (I decided to accumulate as many as possible, but cheated by ordering hundreds of QSL's from an advertisement in the back of a ham magazine.) Most QSL's were beautiful -- not because of their artistic design but because the odd juxtaposition of letters and numerals, along with graphics and cartoons of antennas, radio waves, lightning bolts and technical doodads, gave them the allure of a secret society. Reproduced in HELLO WORLD: A Life in Ham Radio (Princeton Architectural Press, paper, $24.95), by Danny Gregory and Paul Sahre, they have acquired a curious folk-art quality. This book is a profusely visual, clever and handsomely designed (the title on the book cover is not set in words but in Morse code) paean to ham radio presented through reproductions of hundreds of QSL cards and other ephemera collected and annotated for more than 70 years by an avid New Jersey enthusiast and found by the authors at a flea market after he died. Instant messaging and e-mail have made ham radio virtually obsolete, but these QSL's from all over the world recall the days when strange and wonderful voices filled the airwaves.

So it's not surprising that voters in all but two of the county's school districts passed their school budgets on June 3. What is surprising is that the two districts that rejected budgets, Katonah-Lewisboro and Valhalla, are far from being troubled districts, and in fact have solid academic reputations. The rejections are perhaps even more surprising given that statewide, 94 percent of the school districts passed their budgets successfully, despite the difficult economy. And Valhalla passed its budget on the second try last Tuesday.The budget defeat in Katonah-Lewisboro reflects a number of issues in a complex , far-flung set of diverse communities, with somewhat attenuated ties to the school district as a whole, people in the district say. The 4,200-student district covers 54 square miles, encompassing Katonah as well as hamlets like Vista, South Salem and Cross River. The district is economically diverse, with lavish weekend homes, modest cottages as well as new houses that sell for $825,000 in recently built housing developments.

The family's descent, he wrote, went 'straight back to a Norman who came over with the Conqueror', while Kedleston had belonged to the Curzons, most of whom were buried in its church, since the twelfth century.

Not with vague charges of cultural bias still clinging to them. Not at a time when multiple intelligences -- that happy, inclusive vision in which nearly everybody is good at something -- are on the ascendancy. If you do take a Stanford-Binet or a Wechsler, and you score in the average range, well, there you'll be, with hardly a reason to mention it. If you score high, the particular number won't matter much -- unless you're the sort to join Mensa, and then it will matter only to your fellow Mensa members. But if you are in the bottom 3 percent of the population that scores 70 or lower, your actual I.Q. number will mean a great deal. Scores in that range will most likely lead to a diagnosis of mental retardation, and that diagnosis will entail many things, starting with mandated special education. Since last June, across the United States, it has also entailed exemption from capital punishment. And so, for someone who has committed a capital crime, an I.Q. score can mean the difference, quite literally, between life and death.

Rostowtzeff of Yale University, Mr. Vander Poel rescued the MSS of the volumes prepared by Prof. Della Corte for publication in East Berlin, and especially concerning later works on the ancient walled-city of Pompeii. Since 1959 he was occupied in the RICA (Researches in Campanian Archaeology) series of publications in Pompeian Topography, having produced several volumes on the subject as well as delineated maps of Pompeii and its environs. His most recent contribution comprises the production and analysis of the Giornale degli Scavi (from 1861-1867), which had never been published. He was honoured by election to the German Archaeological Institute of Rome (KM) in 1981. A lifelong collector of rare books and scholarly archeological materials, Mr. Vander Poel donated his architectural library (The Vander Poel Campanian Collection) to The Getty Research Institute in 2001. Until his death, he was the longest tenured member of the Grolier Club. Halsted B. Vander Poel was born in 1911 on his grandfather's, the C.K.G. Billings' estate on Manhattan Island, N.Y., the present site of the Cloisters. He attended St. George's School and went on to get a degree from Yale University. He was very happily married for 50 years to his late wife, Dorothy Marlatt Vander Poel, and is survived by his three daughters, Jane Stuart Lenzetti of Washington, D.C., Virginia Stuart Muse of Aurora, Colorado, Deborah Billings Jorgensen of King William, VA, a son, Halsted B. Vander Poel II of Lakewood, Colorado, and a sister, Wendy Russell of Oyster Bay, NY, and six grandchildren. The funeral will be held at Christ Church, 3116 O Street N.W., Washington, D.C., on July 2nd at 11:00 am. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Washington Home & Hospice, 3720 Upton Street N.W., Washington D.C. 20016. >>AD#",2003-06-30T05:00:00+0000
