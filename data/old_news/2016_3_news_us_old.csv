Abenaki Indians were threatening colonists on land while pirates were marauding at sea. Alternative sources of authority were scarce. Fallout from the Salem witch trials of 1692 had discredited the colonys Congregationalist ministers. It didnt help that a young firebrand named Franklin began to print a newspaper that mocked both the government and the ministers. Perhaps most dangerously, smallpox had spread from an infected ship to people ashore. The resulting epidemic is the fever Stephen Coss places at the center of his first book, The Fever of 1721, though his title bundles up all of the citys hot troubles into one big crisis.",2016-03-04T06:27:28+0000

A lot of my books have to do with forgiveness, Macomber has said. I dont know why thats so important to me, but it seems to be a common theme. Macomber is a regular on the fiction list, often for series novels about knitting or Christmas or new beginnings (as this one is, although the only knitting in it involves the tangling of human limbs). But the work didnt always come easy. When I started out 35 years ago, she told a newspaper in Savannah, Ga., recently, I saw a quote from Phyllis Whitney: There has never been an easy time to sell a book. I wanted this more than I ever wanted anything in my life. I got rejected so fast, my manuscripts would hit me in the back of the head on my way back from the post office. But Macomber never gave up. It has a lot to do with stubbornness and desire, she said, adding that she similarly trained herself to run despite a lack of athletic ability.

Despite growing up in what he describes as a very musical household, Abraham eschewed the family business as an 18-year-old in favor of five years of film school, turning to music only after a professor (a scary, kind of crotchety stalwart of the Australian writing scene) offered a particularly stinging critique of his work.

The United Nations has sponsored several failed attempts to halt the fighting, which has killed more than 3,000 civilians and left most of the country in need of humanitarian aid. Representatives of the Houthis traveled to Saudi Arabia this week to discuss prisoner exchanges and a de-escalation of fighting along the Saudi-Yemeni border.

Despite the Liberal governments push to admit Syrian refugees, many private groups that have raised money to sponsor refugee families still find themselves without anyone to host. John McCallum, the immigration minister, said that the government would triple the annual limit for privately sponsored refugees to 18,000 people this year. The new limits are part of an overall goal of admitting 305,000 immigrants, a portion of whom are political refugees, as permanent residents this year, compared with 285,000 last year. Mr. McCallum said the rules would be changed to make it easier for previous immigrants to bring family members to the country. ",2016-03-09T01:09:39+0000

And the migrant writer hatched a new language along the way. To conquer English may be to complete the process of making ourselves free, Rushdie wrote in his 1991 essay collection, Imaginary Homelands.

us,Inside the List,"Lets Get Physical: If you believe Einstein, time as we usually understand it is nothing more than a persistent, stubborn illusion. That may be. But timing is still everything  and the timing could hardly be better for the theoretical physicist Carlo Rovellis latest book, Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No.5. Originally published two years ago in Rovellis native Italy (where it outsold Fifty Shades of Grey), the book arrives in America less than a month after scientists announced the first direct evidence of gravitational waves, confirming Einsteins theory of general relativity and reigniting the publics occasional love affair with what may be the hardest of the hard sciences. (Over the years, other theoretical physicists to hit the list have included Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene, Lisa Randall and Lawrence Krauss.) Rovelli, as it happens, is an expert on gravity: Hes a founder of the loop quantum gravity theory, the chief competitor to string theory among efforts to unite the macro world of relativity with the micro world of quantum mechanics. So he was giddy at the news that gravitational waves had been detected. For physicists this is an ecstatic moment, he wrote on Slate. If a benign nature wanted to honor the centenary of Einsteins idea, she has found the most elegant way. Its hard to imagine a more vivid indication of the power of scientific reason: From indirect evidence and clarity of thought, reason sees so far that it takes another century before our eyes and our hands can follow up.",2016-03-11T16:07:20+0000
us,"Anna and the Swallow Man, by Gavriel Savit","There are two questions about Gavriel Savits splendid debut novel that are sure to be asked repeatedly: Is it an allegory, and at whom is it aimed? The first I believe Savit answers clearly. The world understands stories, he has one of his main characters come to realize, not as absolute, irrevocably factual truths that simply dont exist, but as flaccid allegories or metaphors. You may read the novel as allegory; go ahead. All stories are allegory. This one makes use of stock figures from European folklore (the fool, the golem, the trickster, the demon, animal shape-changers). Its also tempting to expand on ways in which the novels characters represent aspects of the Polish people during World War II. Even the winsome chapter-heading designs created by the illustrator Laura Carlin can be interpreted in more than one way. But Anna and the Swallow Man, and the very human people they meet in the course of the novel, also have their own plausible existence within the rules of the world we know. Indeed, they learn to question and distrust allegory as the tale progresses. For every apparent piece of magic performed in the text, there is a scientific explanation. When the Swallow Man gives Anna a fantastical description of the medicine he takes, for example, there is a literal interpretation as well. This is masterly storytelling.",2016-03-11T16:09:16+0000

But at this handsome new restaurant, it is given top billing and an elegance rarely associated with what in Japan is usually a quick meal of grilled chicken bits. Yakitori is changing in Japan, said Yuko Hagiwara, the manager of the restaurant, which is owned by a Japanese company. Its becoming more high-end because chicken is very expensive. Here, several yakitori dishes, made with chicken from Bo Bo Poultry in Brooklyn, include chicken breast with beets and chicken tenders with mushrooms. They are part of a $150 10-course kaiseki menu served at a U-shaped stone counter facing the open kitchen and at tables around the room. The chef is Nobutaka Watanabe, working alongside Yuichiro Yoshimura, a yakitori expert. The room is designed to suggest the ryokan, a type of traditional country inn, that the parent company owns in northern Japan. Layers of wavy maple meant to resemble the sea cover one wall.

Their skin, moving in waves, gradually transforms from rippling flesh into a more mysterious, unknowable entity; what starts out as a meditation on the female form gradually becomes a poetic look at skin and aging. On Sunday, March 20, at 3:30 p.m., the collaborators will host a discussion with other choreographers who work in film, including Jillian Pea.

us,Trump Rises,"My insta-reaction to last nights primaries focused on the defeat of Marco Rubio, but its worth saying something about the overall state of the race as well and what I have to say, unfortunately for the anti-Trumpist cause, is that my analysis from eight daysago predicting a contested convention (and a not-Trump outcome) looks weaker than it did. The reason is straightforward: A week ago Trump was still averaging, as hed averaged from the earliest contests onward, about 34 percent of the primary vote. But last night Trump won at least 39 percent of the vote in every state except Ohio, and even there, in his loss to John Kasich, he still came away with more than 35 percent. That five point boost is why he beat Ted Cruz in both Missouri and North Carolina: Cruz reached 40 percent in the formerand the high 30s in the latter, which would have been enough to beat Trump in a lot of prior contests, from Michigan to Arkansas to Kentucky  but wasnt enough to win this time around. And if that boost holds, if Trumps new average is 40 percent,in a three-way race that could certainly open a path to 1,237 delegates; its still a path without a huge margin for error, but it makes his nomination much more likely than when he appeared to be stuckfive points lower.",2016-03-16T18:34:02+0000

That term infuriated Moroccan leaders and led to demonstrations in Morocco last Sunday directed against Mr. Ban, who described them as disrespectful. Moroccos foreign minister, Salaheddine Mezouar, who conferred with Mr. Ban on Monday in what diplomats described as a tense meeting, said he had informed Mr. Ban that his country was cutting a large part of its civilian support for the United Nations Mission in Western Sahara and evaluating whether to withdraw Moroccan troops from all peacekeeping operations. Stphane Dujarric, a spokesman for Mr. Ban, described the Moroccan response as regrettable. Morocco seized Western Sahara, a former Spanish protectorate, in 1976, and fought a war against a pro-independence movement, the Polisario Front. The United Nations has been trying since 1991 to resolve the conflict. Morocco has insisted on its sovereignty. ",2016-03-17T02:28:29+0000

If successful, he would prove that one of the most sophisticated navigational techniques ever developed still existed and, he hoped, inspire efforts to save it from extinction. Monitoring his progress from the power boat were an unlikely trio of Western scientists  an anthropologist, a physicist and an oceanographer  who were hoping his journey might help them explain how wave pilots, in defiance of the dizzying complexities of fluid dynamics, detect direction and proximity to land. More broadly, they wondered if watching him sail, in the context of growing concerns about the neurological effects of navigation-by-smartphone, would yield hints about how our orienteering skills influence our sense of place, our sense of home, even our sense of self.",2016-03-17T11:00:06+0000

Vige Le Brun then became a society portraitist, and for more than a century was looked down upon for that. (Theres a drawback to having your lucky break be a commissioned painting of Marie Antoinette.) At first Vige Le Bruns stepfather made off with much of her earnings; she then married a charismatic man of taste who again and again spent her money on finery, though he did successfully market Vige Le Brun as an artist, and arranged high fees for her work. Some said the fees were too high, that she was not that good; others said her work was too good to have actually been done by a woman, that it must in fact have been done by a man, maybe a lover. Perhaps the most predictable of the gripes directed against Vige Le Brun was Simone de Beauvoirs: In dismissing a series of female artists, she wrote disparagingly of Vige Le Brun that she never wearied of putting her smiling maternity on her canvases, even though only two of the extant Vige Le Brun portraits are of herself with her daughter.

Or the Sixty-Third Street Music Hall, as it was more properly called. A kind of multipurpose performance space, not very big, not very nice, sandwiched in between garages, Walton wrote, and little known to the average Broadway theatergoer. You could rent the place for the night. It had philosophical lectures, amateur violin recitals and religious meetings, and during the day it showed silent movies: Puddn Head Wilson, with Theodore Roberts, tomorrow. But on this evening  and for many months to come, as it turned out  the stage belonged to an all-black show called Shuffle Along, a comedy with lots of singing and dancing. A problem: The music hall had no orchestra pit, and this show needed an orchestra. It needed space for the band, which happened to include a 25-year-old musician known as Bill Still, later to become the famous composer William Grant Still, but in 1921 a mostly unheard-of young man from Arkansas, switching among the six or seven instruments he taught himself to play. The production was forced to rip out seats in the front three rows to make room. These were people used to improvising.

When you rinse a mask off, that ends your skins absorption, says Tata Harper, whose popular all-natural skin-care line features several no-rinse options. Leave-on masks extend the time your skin has to absorb benefits. These formulas are translucent and porous enough to work well with other products, offering a lifted, protected and smoothed-out base for further skin care and makeup.

None of the paintings in the show, Waplingtons first stateside exhibition sans photography, have a single vantage point, a conscious choice to make it deliberately difficult to perceive order, he explains. My paintings deal with this inner world, whereas my photographic work deals with the world around me, says Waplington, who will appear Thursday in New York at the Rizzoli bookstore alongside Isaac Mizrahi, whose backstage scene he documented every season from 1989 to 1993.
