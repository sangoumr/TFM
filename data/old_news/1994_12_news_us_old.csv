Is this reasoning sound? We are in the 28 percent tax bracket. For each child, we have about 73 shares of AT&T; stock, three or four zero-coupon municipal bonds, about $10,000 in the Fidelity Growth and Income Fund and about $3,000 in savings bonds.

The Game Is Afoot","IT is rather like a box of the very best chocolates, in which you like all the centers. I keep having just one more. ENCYCLOPEDIA SHERLOCKIANA: An A-to-Z Guide to the World of the Great Detective (Macmillan, $25) is exceedingly well set out; you can quickly find whatever you wish. All of Sherlock Holmes's life is chronicled in one piece, so you may read it as a biography, rather than episodically. Every novel and story of the original canon is noted, with its date and vehicle of publication. The author, Matthew E. Bunson, who previously wrote ""The Vampire Encyclopedia,"" also includes reproductions of many original drawings, full of great character and life, by artists like Sidney Paget. All of Arthur Conan Doyle's works, as well as writings on Holmesian themes by other authors, are outlined, but in such a way as to intrigue, not to give away plots or solutions. There are excellent lists; for example, at a glance are all the actors who have portrayed Holmes in the movies or on television. (They include such unlikely candidates as Buster Keaton and John Cleese, making Holmes, like Cleopatra, a person of infinite variety.) There are similar lists for Dr. Watson, Mrs. Hudson, Inspector Lestrade and Professor Moriarty. I especially like the assessments of the non-canonical works, like that of what I consider the best Holmes movie of all, ""Murder by Decree,"" with Christopher Plummer as Holmes and James Mason as Watson. Mr. Bunson even picked out my favorite scene from that film, which ""involves Holmes ruthlessly squashing a pea to the consternation of the good doctor.""

If I could spare time on my day off, I might accompany patients to social activities.

President Clinton called the old, humbled Congress back for a bittersweet farewell to deal with the issue, and after he pacified Bob Dole with some last-minute tinkering, the House and then the Senate gave their overwhelming blessings. Now this nation's main trading partners, like Japan and Europe, can act, too -- they were waiting for Washington. Then what? Will the pact, as Mr. Clinton said, keep America ""moving forward"" to ""create more high-wage jobs""? Or will it, as some critics contend, allow a global group to undercut American laws if they are seen as harmful to trade? The pact isn't perfect, said George Mitchell in his farewell.

Power Commuting","GIVEN that, after the birth of the motor car, Long Island Sound was less crowded than the Boston Post Road, it quite naturally occurred to men of means and ingenuity that the logical way to get to Wall Street from such places as Oyster Bay was to travel by boat. The vogue reached its peak at about the time of the First World War, lingered during the Depression, briefly revived in the 1930's and, after the war, went the way of privately owned railroad cars. Two things about YACHTS IN A HURRY: An Illustrated History of the Great Commuter Yachts (Norton, $40): The text by C. Philip Moore (himself the former owner of a commuter boat, the Saga) is buoyantly well written, miles removed from the technical cant one might expect in a 200-page book given over to describing one boat after another. Second, the introduction, written by Robert B. MacKay, the director of the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities, is sheer joy. His narrative of what the commuter boats were expected to do and did do could not have been improved upon by the writers of ""Saturday Night Live."": ""Typically, owners were picked up at their docks or from their yacht clubs, often clad only in their nightgowns since they waited to don their business attire on board. It appears, however, that there were many variations in routine. . . . The sons of James D. Mooney . . . remember that their father would walk to the end of his Center Island dock in Oyster Bay promptly at 7:30 A.M. clad only in his bathing suit. Captain H. R. O. Johnson . . . would already have the twin Liberties purring aboard Rosemarie . . . and Mr. Mooney's mail and the daily papers already on board. Halfway down the sound toward Manhattan, Captain Johnson would cut off the engines and Mr. Mooney would take an invigorating morning dip before dressing for work.""

The director of the dig, Eric Sjogvist, amused at my reaction, observed how much more exciting it would have been to have found ""the rich glory of the commonplace"" -- you know, the things that would tell us so much more about antiquity than the official pieces -- Helen of Troy's shoe closet or Alexander the Great's collection of drinking cups (he was a notorious boozer in his last year). Had we had in our hands a copy of the imaginative, beautiful book called MAGNIFICENT OBSESSIONS: Twenty Remarkable Collectors in Pursuit of Their Dreams (Chronicle, paper, $19.95), by Mitch Tuchman, with spectacular photographs by Peter Brenner, we would have dreamed up far better ideas. This amusing and serious book is about 20 real collectors who are most certainly not collecting ""dignified"" things like Renaissance bronzes or Manet paintings, but vast, gorgeous and thoughtful works like Lionel trains, puzzles, toy soldiers and swizzle sticks. The book is a revelation and a joy. Mr. Tuchman, a California collector himself and editor in chief at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Mr. Brenner, the museum's supervising photographer, present the collectors, their beliefs and their pieces compellingly. After reading the lucid and mesmerizing explanations of why these gifted collectors acquire puzzles or aquarium furniture and after looking at the dazzling photographs, you may become as hooked on the book as its subjects are by their satisfyingly strange artifacts.

us,"The Joy of Compulsion;
Robber Baronesses at Leisure","THIS book resembles a modern opera production: Louis Auchincloss gives us a melodious score and an elegant libretto; Deborah Turbeville, the photographer, is the director whose interpretation tells us more about her bias than it does about the subject. Mr. Auchincloss, who like his literary ancestors Henry James and Edith Wharton, feels quite at home with the educated and the rich, has written in DEBORAH TURBEVILLE'S NEWPORT REMEMBERED: A Photographic Portrait of a Gilded Past (Abrams, $60) an admirably concise, witty and yet sensitive history of the Rhode Island summer resort, from the 18th century through its social apogee at the turn of the century to today. Ms. Turbeville's photographs are beautifully shot through fog and cheesecloth, creating partly an aura of an old family album, and partly an atmosphere of decomposition and decay. Artistic distributions of dust, debris, disorder and dead leaves make us expect the sudden appearance of a ghost. But no, the only inhabitants of these images are some pretty fashion models looking uncomfortable, as if they had gate-crashed Mrs. Astor's wake. The book suffers from selective recall. Whereas Mr. Auchincloss pays erudite tribute to the town's distinctive and beautiful architectural heritage from the 17th and 18th centuries, Ms. Turbeville, like most of the tourists, focuses exclusively on the gaudy mansions. She compares them to ""the palaces of the czars . . . of the doges, or Versailles."" But these houses were not built by America's industrial czars; they only paid for them. They were built for, and ruled over, by their wives, the robber baronesses. Newport was always a matriarchy. Mr. Auchincloss mentions the Touro Synagogue, the oldest in America. It stands within a stone's throw of Trinity Church; its existence is symbolic of the spirit of tolerance that led to the founding of Rhode Island. That spirit is clearly embraced by Mr. Auchincloss, who quotes from George Washington's moving letter to the congregation, but it was certainly not adopted by the owners of the Newport mansions photographed by Ms. Turbeville, or by their descendants. Hence the cobwebs and the decay. Edith Wharton was invited; Proust would have been shown the door.Claus von Bulow",1994-12-04T05:00:00+0000

Our objection to the conservancy's term ""alien pests"" is not, as your article implies, that we think the animals are indigenous. It is that, despite the availability of more humane animal-control methods, the conservancy persists in using one of the cruelest means ever devised. The snare's wire noose cuts a deep gash in a struggling animal's neck. Struggling increases the pain and deepens the wound, so some animals lie still, unable to seek food or shelter, or to end their pain. Maggots breed in the still-living animal's wound and enter eyes, nose and mouth. The animal lingers for many days before dying of infection, starvation or dehydration.

Is it just pulp entertainment, sensationalizing and exploiting real suffering? Is it propaganda that promotes a vicious, woman-hating subculture? Does it reinforce negative stereotypes of young black men as feral, sex-crazed, armed predators? Is it, as some of its practitioners insist, simply reportage from the inner city, a critique of the lives and deaths it describes? And have its adherents confused fiction with reality?",1994-12-11T05:00:00+0000

The relationship between partners in love affairs and marriages is the territory explored in these nine tales, which examine the often confused feelings that intimacy engenders.

Winner of a Pulitzer Prize and selected as one of the best books of 1994 by the editors of The New York Times Book Review, this study reconstructs the first half of a long and complicated life. The book shows how W. E. B. Du Bois worked to create an image of himself as well as one of the future of black people, whose civil rights he tirelessly championed both in the United States and the rest of the world. Our reviewer, Waldo E. Martin Jr., said: ""Mr. Lewis is a deft and sensitive guide. . . .

us,"Games People Are Playing. A Gift, Perhaps?","Here are four games that are popular this holiday season. WHAT: VISIONARY. IDEAL PLAYERS: People who can't get enough of Jeopardy, 7 years old and up. HOW TO PLAY: There are five categories of subjects, including music and entertainment, travel and geography, and animals and nature. Cards display multiple choice questions, plus an optional ""risk"" question, on which players gamble for bonus points. THE APPEAL: The questions are more basic (and less trivial) than in Trivial Pursuit, so different age groups can play together. There are also special cards for younger children, and parents can tell themselves that the game is educational. SAMPLE QUESTION: The twisted shape of the pretzel was derived from: (a) arms folded in prayer, (b) people seated cross-legged, (c) the Boy Scouts' slip knot. Risk question: A pretzel is displayed on the emblem of what group of tradesmen? (Answers: (a), bakers.) AVAILABLE: At specialty stores, like F. A. O. Schwarz, Learningsmith and the Museum Company, and through the Worldwide Games catalogue, (800) 243-9232. Suggested price is $36. WHAT: CAREY DeVUONO'S HOLLYWOOD MOGUL . EQUIPMENT NEEDED: An I.B.M.-compatible computer and Windows 3.1. IDEAL PLAYER: Hard-hearted, with a head for negotiation, and tall enough to reach the mouse. HOW TO PLAY: You are the owner of a studio and make all the decisions to produce your own movies, from choosing the script and hiring stars to budgeting the production and the release of the films. If a movie loses money, the game moves to the natural next step: choosing whom to blame. One option is to fire everybody. EDUCATIONAL? Sure. The instruction book explains the lingo of ""players,"" like above-the-line costs and P & A. You don't go to a meeting, you take a meeting. Got it, babe? RAISON D'ETRE: A struggling screenwriter, Carey DeVuono, wanted to prove that his screenplay, ""The Highland Street Generals,"" would be a hit. He taught himself to program and created Hollywood Mogul. ""The Highland Street Generals"" is one of the scripts available in the game, but outside Hollywood Mogul, it has yet to be sold. AVAILABLE: Only by mail, for $39.99. Telephone: (800) 350-5550. WHAT: THE DOONESBURY GAME. IDEAL PLAYER: Opinionated and makes sure everyone knows it. Likes parlor games to show off a mocking wit. Can talk about any subject without knowing anything about it. HOW TO PLAY: Land on squares with categories like Public Opinion, Flashback and Soundbites. Pick a card, which supplies a topic for that category. Depending on the category, a player gives a presentation or tells a story from his own life relating to the topic, and the other players judge the performance. Or a player writes down words in response to the topic, while other players write their responses and try to match his words. Points are scored. Sarcasm ensues. SAMPLE TOPICS: ""John Kennedy Jr. dials you by mistake. Keep him on the line."" ""Talk about a rock group you saw before they were who they became."" WHAT THIS GAME HAS TO DO WITH DOONESBURY: Not much, except for capturing the comic strip's satiric baby-boomer sensibility. Reading the Garry Trudeau strip is not a requirement, although some board spaces make more sense with some background. For example, landing on Boopsie's Channel Change makes players switch places, identities and points. AVAILABLE: At specialty stores and through the Worldwide Games catalogue for $32. WHAT: MANCALA . ORIGINS: Commonly believed to be 3,000 years old, the game is thought to have originated in Egypt, and it is played throughout Africa, with regional variations. IDEAL PLAYER: Any age; enjoys strategy games. HOW TO PLAY: Two players face each other across a wooden board. Colored stones are distributed equally in the 12 shallow bowls carved into the board; the two larger bowls (the mancala) on either end are empty. Each player in turn distributes his stones among the six bowls on his side. There are many variations to the game, but in the most common set of rules, each time a stone is placed in an empty bowl, the player captures the stones from the opposite bowl and places them in his mancala. The object of the game is to capture the most stones. THE APPEAL: Like backgammon or chess, the complexity of the game depends on the skill of the players, so all ages can play. And it looks nice on the coffee table: the woods used for the board include pine and oak, and some versions use semiprecious stones. AVAILABLE: Widely available from many different manufacturers. Prices range from $10.95 to $26. MICHELLE SHIH",1994-12-11T05:00:00+0000

It was a gloriously warm autumn Sunday and the Pontiff was about to begin another of what has for so many years been a triumphal procession to the canopied outdoor altar set on a wooden platform overlooking St. Peter's Square.

us,"IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
Representations of Emotion","Delicious. Luscious. Scrumptious. These are just a few of the adjectives that appropriately describe the paintings in HOWARD HODGKIN (Abrams, $49.50). Andrew Graham-Dixon, the chief art critic at the London newspaper The Independent, argues that while Hodgkin's work cannot be limited to one school of painting, if it falls within any tradition at all it is that of the Intimists -- Matisse, Bonnard, Vuillard -- ""only insofar as his concern has always been with the articulation in paint of moments of thought or feeling."" Or as the 62-year-old Hodgkin, who was knighted in 1992, puts it himself: ""I paint representational pictures of emotional situations."" Hodgkin's art has been slow to evolve. It was not until the mid-1970's, Mr. Graham-Dixon believes, that the painter's work reached its potential. Most of the paintings from the 1980's on are rendered in vivid, evanescent oils on wood and frame, with the frame becoming inseparable from the painting itself. ""Howard Hodgkin"" is that rare but sublime match of author and subject, paintings and text. Indeed, Mr. Graham-Dixon's erudite and endlessly quotable study is a profound meditation not only on this particular artist's work and career, but on the nature of art itself.ROBIN LIPPINCOTT",1994-12-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"Hey, It's Fashion: Major Protection From Bad Elements","WHAT: The Weathertech 1620 EMS Protective Parka -- the Armani jacket of ambulance-worker wear. Made of wind- and water-repellent Supplex nylon, the 1620 is said to be both waterproof and breathable. It is trimmed with 200 square inches of silver Scotchlite reflective material, which makes the wearer visible on a clear night from 675 feet away. WHY: As authentic, high-tech street wear, it meets the style requirements of both ravers (who like to wear shiny, man-made fibers) and rappers (who have turned blue-collar staples like Carhartt and Dickies into fashion labels.) Patricia Field, the Greenwich Village emporium that specializes in club clothes, has been selling the 1620 jacket ($120) since last fall. ""It was the kids who discovered it and inspired us to buy it,"" said Annex Song, the manager of the store at 10 East Eighth Street. ""It wasn't something a company came up with to market to them."" LIFELINE: The 1620 was conceived four years ago by I. Spiewak & Sons, a 90-year-old New York City uniform manufacturer that supplies clothes for police officers, airline mechanics and toll collectors, among others. The company spent two years developing and testing the jacket so that it would meet National Fire Protection Association standards. YOU BET YOUR LIFE: The jacket is designed to protect against blood-borne pathogens, which provides peace of mind to emergency health-care workers in the age of AIDS. AS SEEN IN SOHO: Phat Farm, on Prince Street, has the Spiewak coat (in blue or red) with the Phat Farm ""All City"" logo embroidered over the breast pocket; it costs $150. At the Anna Sui boutique on Greene Street, there is a black nylon coat with reflective tape that mimics the Spiewak version; it costs $415 (but was on sale last week for $335.) AS SEEN IN MILAN: The Spiewak coat has an upscale cousin: the ultra-chic, rather expensive industrial-strength nylon coat from Prada, the 81-year-old Italian leather-goods house. AS SEEN IN NEW JERSEY: When Katzins Uniform in Newark put the 1620 in its window, the hip-hop crowd, which was already buying coveralls and Carhartt parkas from the store, started making inquiries. ""It just proves that style knows no bounds,"" said Len Schlosberg, an owner, who is also the chairman of the National Association of Uniform Manufacturers and Distributors. Katzins sells the 1620 for $181. (For an additional cost, the parka can be accessorized with matching protective pants and Hollofil or Thinsulate liners.) POETIC JUSTICE: At first, the 1620 seems like more protection than anyone but an Emergency Medical Service worker would need. But, alas, when one considers the dangers of city life today, it makes sense that a jacket designed for bloody medical emergencies would become a contemporary fashion statement.

This is pertinent because one of the items Santa should be distributing this season is THE HISTORICAL ATLAS OF NEW YORK CITY: A Visual Celebration of Nearly 400 Years of New York City's History (Holt, $45). The book, by Eric Homberger, who teaches American studies at the University of East Anglia in England, may be as close to a printed CD-ROM as paper can get; it is a triumph of graphics, with text, maps and photographs sharing space in a variety of colors, typefaces and layouts. These brilliant displays are built around Mr. Homberger's history of the city from precolonial days to the current 42d Street renewal. It is a fair and lucid commentary that includes a plethora of relevant and not-so-relevant but descriptive detail. Although other boroughs are mentioned and mapped, this is essentially a Manhattan book, and no less interesting for that. Alice Hudson, chief of the New York Public Library's Map Division, has presided over a magnificent assortment of maps that, with other charts and graphs, tells the reader about the bewildering demographics of the city. The material, which might otherwise seem too academic, comes to life in these clear-cut, simplified expositions. Most useful is the chronology that wraps up the city's history -- a hodgepodge of notable incident and era-dividing development. The spread of material across the pages may seem difficult to assimilate all at once, but you do not need to -- it is a book that lends itself remarkably well to dip-and-flip reading. RICHARD F.

He said that under the City Council's bill, the panel would have had too much investigative power and might interfere with other law-enforcement agencies. Page 1. WHITMAN'S SCHOOL VOUCHER PLAN FALTERS Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey has a national reputation, a Legislature controlled by fellow Republicans and enough popularity points to make most politicians turn green with envy. Yet she is having a surprising amount of trouble mobilizing support for an issue dear to many in her party's conservative wing: school vouchers. Page 1. Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City is offering city employees $500 toward private-school tuition starting next fall. But critics say he has gone too far. Page 30.

But now, in the wake of the November election, many are wondering how Mr. Ritter's conciliatory approach will work in a different political climate.

us,Business Diary: December 18-23,"INTERNATIONAL The Mexican Miracle, Apparently, Was Not What It Seemed Ross Perot, trying to head off the North American Free Trade Agreement, warned that if the accord became reality, Mexico would devalue the peso, letting low-price goods flood northward. He may have been partly right. Mexico, it seems, tried mightily to prop up the peso, but last week that effort failed -- failed big. The peso, already weakening, plummeted when Mexico let it go into free-fall against the dollar. Some costs were quick: banks and other investors lost a bundle. And some will stick around: an abrupt loss of confidence in the new President, Ernesto Zedillo, and a fear of new economic chaos in a nation seemingly getting its footing. So how did the Mexican Miracle take such a nasty spill? Perhaps because that miracle was kept alive more on hope than on basics. The hope now: a new, solid beginning with the peso at a lower, more stable level. Listen to the Children Think of ""hand-held electronic organizers"" and you naturally think of sleek, solemn, hyped-up executives. At least American companies think that way; in Japan they had a better idea -- make them for children. And now they're a big hit with preteen-age girls (the boys are still hooked on Sega and the like), who use them for fortune-telling games, or to create computer-animated virtual pets, or perhaps to ""whisper"" messages across a room. Casio, heeding the lesson, has started selling kid-level organizers in the United States. There's probably a lesson here for Apple Computer and its Newton ""personal digital assistant"": The children know. THE ECONOMY Carter Plays Softball Talk about the sacred and the mundane! Jimmy Carter, hopping about the globe in a crusade for world peace, last week offered his services in a surprisingly humble dispute -- one in which, though feelings run high, no bloodshed seems likely. Yes, we're talking baseball, and Mr. Carter's gesture didn't seem to help. Players and owners have so far managed to erase a sizable business from the American map, and the owners just declared an impasse and decreed a salary cap -- when, that is, salaries are paid. Of Owls and 'Welfare Cowboys' On the environmental front, President Clinton just got his way in one battle and retreated from another. He put a lot of effort into resolving a dispute about logging in Northwest forests that house the fabled spotted owl, and the Administration came up with a plan allowing harvests at less than a fifth of 80's levels. And last week a Federal judge approved the plan. At the same time, Interior Secretary Babbitt backed down from a plan to increase grazing fees for public lands, leaving the issue to the Republicans. Environmentalists jumped hard on this one, with one lawyer predicting that Congress would ""perpetuate subsidies for welfare cowboys."" Open Gift, Insert Foot The Christmas gift to clients -- it's usually a cliche so tired it's snoring on arrival. A bottle of Scotch, perhaps -- or maybe a bottle of Scotch. But now, into this imaginative void, leaps Raoul Felder. After Mr. Felder, a Manhattan divorce lawyer, dropped a knife on his foot some years ago, he was flooded with slippers of sympathy -- 150 pairs, which he then had to give away. Aha! he said, and a furry idea was born. This year, when gift season descended, he sent out 200 pairs of slippers that have a marked likeness to Mr. Felder -- hardly surprising, since he'd sent off multiple photographs and sketches to a slipper importer, which in turn got a Chinese factory to do the deed. With stuff like this, who needs lawyer jokes? Tax, Spend, Cut, Duck Robert Byrd hit it on the head last week. Gazing at the jumble of tax cuts and spending cuts sprouting on both sides of the aisle, Senator Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat, called it all ""drag racing"" that would end in a ""demolition derby."" No sooner had President Clinton leaped for the tax-cut wagon than the Republicans yanked it from under him, saying spending cuts would have to come first. Sure enough, the next day Mr. Clinton came up with $24 billion in spending cuts, nearly half of it from the Energy Department. Newt Gingrich had no comment; ""we have our own plan,"" his press secretary said. All this commotion, and it isn't even Jan. 1 yet. Tax advice for '95: duck. Prancer for Vice President? Perhaps it's part of the migration back to traditional values, perhaps it's just a cyclical quirk, but Santa Claus was hot, hot, hot this time around. Hallmark reports that the image of the revered Mr. Claus -- whether on card or gift wrap -- was especially strong, and Coke has splashed a jolly Santa on bottles and cans. And he's managed to put a pudgy, fur-draped foot squarely in the land of the serious (an episode on A&E's ""Biography,"" putting him in a league with F.D.R.) and the popular (a Better Homes and Gardens cover, in a league with Oprah and Di). Clearly, he'll be running for President in '96. COMPANIES A Pentium in Time . . . It was fun while it lasted -- watching the computer types debate the difference between ""perfect"" and ""99.989 percent perfect"" (or was it 99.898?). But the great Pentium drama seems to be over: last week Intel blinked, saying it would gladly replace those flawed chips. Andrew Grove, Intel's president, said he regretted a policy that ""seemed arrogant and uncaring,"" and the company ran large ads apologizing. The impact on Intel: of the five million Pentiums, perhaps a million will be replaced; at $100 a shot, that might cost Intel $100 million. Pretty minor, investors thought, as the stock shot up. The impact on you (if your computer has a Pentium): call (800) 628-8686 now, and you'll get a replacement, though it may take two months. Or wait a decade or two -- the offer's open-ended. But by then, of course, today's computers will seem like amusing antiques. . . . Did the Pentium, by the way, make Intel directors and executives nervous? Perhaps. In the last couple of months, as the crisis was unfolding, eight insiders sold more than 250,000 shares (roughly $15 million worth); in last year's fourth quarter, they sold none. . . . Windows a Bit Late Just half an hour after Intel threw in the chip, Microsoft said the release of its new operating system would be delayed yet again, possibly till August. It's the successor to Windows 3.1 -- the giant-killer among operating systems -- and when it appears, it could rake in $1 billion in sales in a year. But so far it's been called Windows 95 -- not, as it turns out, the greatest name. At last report, no delay is expected in the onset of the new year, so ""we may have to rename it,"" a Microsoft executive said. But at least it seems determined to get it right before it goes public. Microsoft's shares took a fast dip. A Matter of a Few Zeros When Prudential Securities agreed last week to pay $550,000 for making illegal political donations, it was the largest civil settlement ever for the Federal Election Commission. But put it in perspective: Prudential has paid more than 1,000 times that -- $700 million -- to settle civil and criminal charges linked to the sale of limited partnerships. 'Liberal Books Don't Sell' Newt Gingrich once accused House Speaker Jim Wright of fuzzy ethics concerning sales of a book Mr. Wright had written (and earned $55,000 from). Soon, farewell Mr. Wright; five years later, enter Mr. Gingrich. And last week came reports that Mr. Gingrich had signed a $4 million-plus book contract with HarperCollins, a Murdoch publishing house. Representative David Bonior labeled the deal a ""$4 million Christmas gift"" from an empire that includes the Fox network, which faces a regulatory battle. A spokesman for Mr. Gingrich called Mr. Bonior ""an attack dog."" As for Mr. Gingrich, he said, ""Conservative books sell. I can't help it if liberal books don't sell."" Quick! Where's the Perfume? Guess what, guys: the stores are on to you. It's a retailing axiom that merchants make half their annual sales during Macy's Gridlock Month (sometimes known as December, though it starts the second that Thanksgiving's over). But store executives know this bizarre season can be broken into more precise fragments. Last week, for instance, was the week of the panic shopper -- and ""men,"" a Bloomingdale's manager said with assurance, ""are panic shoppers."" So if you dashed into a store and grabbed the first gifts you saw, you can be sure those gifts were deliberately placed in your line of sight -- and that just over the next rise of perfumes, clerks nodded knowingly.",1994-12-25T05:00:00+0000

The author shows how I.B.M.'s rigid policies and company culture failed to keep pace with the times, with the resultant loss of dominance in the personal computer market. It is ""a detailed and devastating portrait,"" William Taylor said here last year. GARBAGE By A. R. Ammons. Norton, $9. Winner of a National Book Award, this poem is a long ode to trash -- but it is also an autobiographical meditation and a reflection on humanity, which is, the poet points out not uncharitably, a form of garbage, too. Last year our reviewer, Edward Hirsch, said, ""In this major new installment to his life work, A. R. Ammons has given us an American testament."" Mortality and trash are also subjects explored in THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI, by Italo Calvino, translated by Tim Parks (Vintage International, $10). In these five essays detailing his life and development as a writer, Calvino reflects on language and the significance of events like the disposal of rubbish, which he calls ""an offering made to the underworld."" The book is ""a provocative reminder of how truly international"" Calvino's writing is, Lawrence Venuti said here last year. FIMA By Amos Oz. Translated by Nicholas de Lange. Helen and Kurt Wolff/Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11.95. This novel charts the transformation through tragedy of the man of the title, a 54-year-old Israeli whose political commitments and promise as a poet have, like his marriage, dwindled away. Last year our reviewer, Francine Prose, said the author ""succeeds in making us believe in the particular, individual life of this man."" THE WHOLE TEN YARDS By Frank Gifford and Harry Waters Jr. Ivy, $5.99. Those who can tear themselves away from televised football long enough to read about the sport will find several new paperbacks, like this autobiography of the man who gained celebrity first as a star player for the New York Giants and then as an ABC-TV commentator. His book ""will attract even more"" attention, Michael Swindle said here last year. A player who had talent but not discipline is remembered in 3RD DOWN AND FOREVER: Joe Don Looney and the Rise and Fall of an American Hero, by J. Brent Clark (St. Martin's, $12.95). Looney, who appeared to have a sure future in professional football, threw it away through erratic and rebellious behavior. Last year our reviewer, Michael Lichtenstein, called the book ""a compassionate, sensitive account of a frustrated life."" There's a happier story in TURNING THE THING AROUND: Pulling America's Team Out of the Dumps -- and Myself Out of the Doghouse, by Jimmy Johnson as told to Ed Hinton (Hyperion, $14.95). This memoir by the former coach of the Dallas Cowboys chronicles Mr. Johnson's early career as well as his stint with Dallas, which began inauspiciously but ended with Super Bowl glory. ""Perhaps best of all is a chapter entitled 'Hair,' "" Charles Salzberg said here last year. LOVE, STARS, AND ALL THAT By Kirin Narayan. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $10. This first novel describes the long pursuit of the perfect mate, beginning with a meeting in Berkeley, Calif., between the heroine, a graduate student from India, and a local poet. Earlier this year our reviewer, Bapsi Sidhwa, called it ""an engaging portrait."" VARIATIONS ON NIGHT AND DAY By Abdelrahman Munif. Translated by Peter Theroux. Vintage International, $12. Set in the 1930's in a fictional desert land that is obviously Saudi Arabia, this novel depicts the fortunes of Sultan Khureybit, a character patterned after the real desert chieftain and king Abdul Aziz ibn Saud. This final volume in the author's ""Cities of Salt"" trilogy allows the reader to ""get to know something of the desert itself,"" Fouad Ajami said here last year. THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD By Lawrence Block. Avon, $5.99. This Matthew Scudder mystery has the unlicensed private eye coming to the aid of a mentally unstable derelict accused of murdering a yuppie lawyer. Earlier this year our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, called this ""streetwise sleuth . . . just about the best there is."" ALBURQUERQUE By Rudolfo Anaya. Warner, $5.99. A young man of mixed Indian and Anglo ancestry learns of his true parentage in this novel, which takes place during a bitter mayoral race in Albuquerque, N.M., once called Alburquerque.

us,A Century of Rolling 'Em,"The movie business may be said to have started in 1894 with ""Fred Ott's Sneeze,"" a kinetoscope that featured Thomas Edison's assistant. Hollywood has been tickling and irritating the national fancy ever since. In AMERICAN CINEMA: One Hundred Years of Filmmaking (Rizzoli, $50), Jeanine Basinger, who teaches film studies at Wesleyan University, has combined informative text and sumptuous photographs to tell the story of movies, beginning in earnest with the definitive victory of sound over silence around 1928. A knowledgeable guide, Ms. Basinger briskly, if somewhat pedantically, covers all her subject's angles. She cuts quickly, for example, from a glance at technical tricks of the trade to a thumbnail discussion of that glittering phenomenon known as the star. She discusses screwball comedy and film noir, and traces the decline of the studio system and the rise of conglomerates and powerful agents, with their deals and packages. Readers looking for discussion of Hollywood's treatment of minorities or of its timorous or distored responses to momentous off-screen events, however, will be disappointed. The allure of Ms. Basinger's book, like that of its subject, lies in its glamorous photographs. Catch Rita Hayworth stairing voluptuously off into space. LEE SIEGEL",1994-12-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Fresh Ways of Looking at the Masters,"The Unknown Stella -- As one walked through the Joseph Stella show last summer at the Whitney Museum of American Art, expecting little, the exhibition revealed an artist more compelling, original and plain weird than anyone might have guessed on the basis of his Brooklyn Bridge pictures. Stella's mix of Madonnas, flowers and Caribbean landscapes were the product of a ripe and iconoclastic imagination that found inspiration in everything from the Sienese Renaissance through Marcel Duchamp. Altogether, the sleeper of the year. Another Face of Picasso -- ""Picasso and the Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese and Dora Maar,"" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art over the summer, sounded as if it would be a mess but turned out to be a beautiful, quirky and inspiring near-mess. Even by Picasso's standards, the work was unusually personal and suggestive (of his gigantic psyche). Especially striking were the extraordinarily colored paintings from the 30's, which aren't usually thought of as his best years. Poussin as Poet -- In the last rooms in the Poussin retrospective now at the Grand Palais in Paris, as one was feeling respectful of the brainy 17th-century French master but not passionate about him, something finally clicked. It happened in front of Virgilian scenes of Arcadia like ""Landscape With Diogenes"" and awesome tempests like ""Landscape With Pyramus and Thisbe"" and in front of a touching self-portrait that reveals the artist as poet. The Great Unveiling -- Michelangelo's ""Last Judgment"" in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, the cleaning of which was completed last spring, finally revealed itself as a grand, unified composition instead of the patchwork quilt it had seemed before. Walking into the chapel, one is now struck by an image of brilliant color that sweeps the eye upward from hell to heaven, with the heroic figure of Christ as the anchor at the center.",1994-12-25T05:00:00+0000

Riveting Medea -- In the spring revival of ""Medea,"" Diana Rigg chose to emphasize the fierce intellect of the title character who slaughters her children in order to drive her faithless husband mad. Once the forbidden deeds were done, the metal walls of Medea's palace fell to the ground with a crash, leaving her profiled against the racing clouds. It was the year's most stunning coup de theatre.

Albee Reborn -- Early in the first act of ""Three Tall Women,"" which opened at the Vineyard Theater in February, there was a jubilant moment when it became clear that Edward Albee had discovered a brilliant, barbed cosmic poetry in the wandering rhythms of a mean old woman's senile speech and that in the magnificent Myra Carter, he had just the right actress to put it across.

Although her portrayal may have been highly mannered, it was a convincing portrait of a lonely alcoholic malcontent with a viper's tongue. Best Performance in a Dress -- Terence Stamp's portrayal of Bernadette, an aging drag queen, in ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" had a witty mixed message about sexual identity and role playing. The oldest of a trio of transvestite entertainers traveling through the Australian outback, Bernadette personified genteel drag-queen hauteur.

His literary interests, his extensive writings on art and his activity as the editor of the influential series of translations ""The Documents of 20th-Century Art"" have all conspired to leave an image of an artist who was too intelligent for his own good. Abstract Expressionist painting was supposed to come from the gut, or so the cliche ran, while Motherwell painted with his head. Knoedler & Company has set out to dispel this image by presenting a selection of pictures from Motherwell's most successful series of paintings, ""Elegies to the Spanish Republic."" Four large canvases devoted to this theme are accompanied by a closely related work, ""At Five in the Afternoon,"" and by a dozen smaller studies on paper and cardboard.

Forgotton Artifacts Surface as Valuable Treasures","As a boy, Richard W. Towne played with American Indian artifacts collected by his great-grandfather during an 1870's trip out West. As he grew up, they were relegated to his parents' attic. When his parents prepared to sell their home last year, they came across the collection and mentioned it to their son. Mr. Towne wondered if the pieces were valuable and took them to the Bolton, Mass., office of Skinner Inc., an auction company.Skinner had an upcoming auction for native artifacts and offered to include the Townes' collection.The family negotiated a contract.The items were photographed for a sales brochure.At auction, in July 1993, the collection brought $20,000. The Townes paid a 10 percent commission, or $2,000. Within 3 days of the sale, the Townes received a check for $18,000.In January 1994, Skinner sold two more pieces the Townes subsequently found -- a beaded pipe bag and moccasins -- for $5,000 at auction. The commission: 15 percent, or $750. The Skinners received $4,250.Mr. Towne said he was more comfortable using a major auction house than making a private sale because the auctioneer worked on commission and had an incentive to fetch as much as possible.Skinner's commission schedule:20 percent on sales of less than $2,00015 percent on sales of $2,000 to $7,50010 percent on sales of more than $7,500.All charges are negotiable if the auction house is eager for the property.

MCI lodged a formal complaint with state regulators. At issue are toll calls that are farther than 16 miles but still within the coverage area of the local telephone monopoly. Customers who want to place calls from one local toll call area to another through one of the 95 new competitors will need to dial a five-digit access number before dialing the phone number. Pacific Bell officials defended the practice. ""This whole notion that we're locking out competitors is ridiculous,"" said Lou Saviano, a Pacific Bell spokesman. ""We're the ones who are locked out.

It has, however, recently produced its own version of hip-hop: a popular inner-city music known as jungle, which was performed live on Wednesday night at the Cooler in Greenwich Village.",1994-12-31T05:00:00+0000
