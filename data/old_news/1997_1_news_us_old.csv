Loving husband of his late wife, Marcia Dubey Ullman. Survived by his second wife Susie Press Ullman; his son Steven M. Ullman and daughter Marjorie Ullman; grandchildren Jerry and Michael Ullman. Mr. Ullman graudated with honors from Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School. Prior to enlistment in the U.S. Army in 1941 he served on the staff of Assemblyman Irving M. Ives (R), Majority Leader. Upon his honorable discharge as Captain in 1946, Mr. Ullman again served U.S. Senator Ives in Washington, D.C. Thereafter he was counsel to two New York state legislative committees under Republican New York States Senators McNeil Mitchell and Seymour Halprin. Mr. Ullman began his private law practice in New York City in 1948 specializing in international ocean transportation. He was General Counsel for the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association along with many other firms including freight forwarders, customs brokers, steamship lines, customs brokers, steamship lines, NVOCCs, motor property brokers, exporters and importers, and public warehouses. During his more than forty years in practice, Mr. Ullman litigated shipping issues extensively in federal trial and appelate courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and often appeared before Congressional committees on shipping matters. Mr. Ullman drafted the 1961 amendment providing of the licensing of ocean freight forwarders and participated in the drafting of the Shipping Act of 1984. In addition, Mr. Ullman recently served as lead counsel before the U.S. Supreme Court obtaining a final ruling holding unlawful restrictive and costly union requirements (the ''50 Mile Container Rule'') that seriously impeded movement of U.S. exports and imports. This victory has been described as a major contribution candidate for New York State Assembly in 1960 and 1962, and for civil court in 1969. Mr. Ullman was described by the nonpartisan Citizens' Union as ''a distinguished and able lawyer ... who is highly regarded for his ability and high integrity.'' Mr. Ullman was the author of the books ''The Ocean Freight Forwarder, the Exporter and the Law,'' and ''U.S. Regulation of Ocean Transportation Under the Shipping Act of 1984,'' which are widely used in shipping circles, in law schools, and by merchant marine academies. In addition, Mr. Ullman wrote extensively in law journals in the United States and Europe on the legal issues involved in the intermodal movement of traffic and has had articles cited by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The itch of waking won't subside. This is an old and by now not particularly troublesome habit, though its effects are sometimes tedious and grow more pronounced the older I get.

us,Moscow on the Thames,"In his first collection of short stories, Zinovy Zinik guides us through the hall of mirrors of his own emigre experience. A Russian writer who left the former Soviet Union in 1975 and now lives in London, Mr. Zinik has written six novels, but only one of them, ''The Mushroom Picker,'' has been translated into English. Abetted by a bitingly ironic voice and an openly autobiographical terrain, ONE-WAY TICKET (New Directions, $19.95) has the freshness of a first impression. Mr. Zinik's wry narrator, who appears in all eight stories, is, not surprisingly, a Russian emigre living in London, a man caught in a crossfire of conflicting emotions about his past and present worlds. By turns caustic and uneasily nostalgic about his homeland, he is nonetheless wounded when he returns on two visits and finds his friends and family bitter and divided. England, however, is no more welcoming: Mr. Zinik memorably portrays literary London as a sort of Mad Hatter's tea party, floating on Pimm's Cup and sexual intrigue. In this purgatory, the narrator feels threatened by more recent emigres who beseech him for help and force him to face the hard fact of his own displacement. Mr. Zinik unflinchingly shows this man's cravenness, but he also illuminates lovely and delicate moments of communion, as when the narrator, waiting in a Vienna bus stop with a Lebanese Jewish immigrant, suddenly finds himself reading the man a newspaper article about Lebanon. Throughout these stories (which have been translated by Frank Williams, Jamey Gambrell, Alan Meyers, Bernard Meares and Priscilla Meyer), Mr. Zinik excels at depicting such shifts in himself and others, calibrating the subtle distinctions between generosity and fear, pride and pity. If at times he tells too much, spelling out emotion rather than trusting his imagery, nonetheless his insights into the pains of statelessness are poetic and powerful.

us,Earth Works,"In most art books pictures are peripheral; the art seems to snub or humiliate them. The photographs taken by the British artist Andy Goldsworthy of the ephemeral objects he constructs are part of the art: the perfect moment when light, shade and shape reveal what he imagined from the start. His latest volume, WOOD (Abrams, $49.50), is a sequel to his ''Stone.'' The several years of work recorded here are intimately related to a ballet, ''Vegetal,'' which Mr. Goldsworthy created for a French dance company, and the book's sections follow the order of the ballet's scenes. The stone cairns he builds around tree trunks are familiar in many countries by now, as are the conical ''houses'' made of broken tree branches in which he balances impossible pinnacles of round stones each atop another unsupported. Here the most vivid work, done on four continents, is in sand, clay, leaves and ice: clay packed into haunting presences emerging from trees, red sand carved into womb shapes, sand swirled into serpentine forms among Egyptian statues in museums, a leafy hazel branch wrapped with poppy petals, hickory leaves snailed into a stone hole, stalks of horse chestnut leaves dancing below a wall of fern fronds, a giant hollow snowball sheltering under an oak, a handmade ice ribbon curling around a tree to catch one moment of blazing late winter light. Mr. Goldsworthy's remarks are mostly journal entries laconically recording his relentless labor, day and night, spent in shaping wonders that cannot endure. His eloquence is reserved for the splendidly reproduced photographs of creations that immediately convince one -- at the most basic, sensual level of knowing -- that the beauty of the world lies in the fragility of Earth itself, in its impermanence and in the swiftness of its self-transformations.

us,A River Runs Through It,"The Mississippi River is at once a mystical landmark soaked in historical and literary associations and an easily accessible but sprawling and multifaceted physical fact. In MISSISSIPPI CURRENTS: Journeys Through Time and a Valley (Morrow, $35), Andrew H. Malcolm, a former reporter for The New York Times who now works for the Governor of Montana, and Roger Straus 3d, a photographer and the chairman of High Tide Press, succeed to a remarkable degree in capturing both Mississippis, the matter-of-fact and the mythic. Most of Mr. Straus's photographs, even those of the grittier, workaday aspects of the river and its people, evoke the Mississippi's mystical aspects, while Mr. Malcolm's text, with a permanent tinge of cynicism, tends to focus on the reality of the river and the sillier, sadder side of being an American tourist attraction. Mr. Straus's shots of Minnesota's Lake Itasca, the source of the Mississippi, show a sunrise and an icebound winter scene; it is left to Mr. Malcolm to describe the T-shirt and postcard vendors and the coins tossed into the water by tourists. In Hannibal, Mo., Mark Twain's hometown, Mr. Straus offers two placid images -- one of the riverboat Mark Twain, the other of the dilapidated Hotel Mark Twain, without a human visible in either one. It is Mr. Malcolm who describes the tacky theme park that the town has become. Even Mr. Straus's photos of the interior of Federal Express's vast Memphis sorting facility speak to the reader's sense of geography and logistics, while Mr. Malcolm sarcastically puts things into modern perspective, noting that ''a parcel can get across town in Phoenix faster and cheaper by going through Memphis.'' Mr. Malcolm and Mr. Straus manage to capture much of the magic of the river without ignoring even the less attractive parts of the reality. Hal Goodman",1997-01-12T05:00:00+0000

Set primarily in Switzerland in the early decades of this century, it concerns a pastor's son named Jacques de Todi, a poet named Luc Pascal and a melancholy Russian woman, Baladine Nikolaievna. Jacques is torn between his longing for the absolute -- especially as it is manifested in nature -- and a particular attraction to young boys. Baladine is drawn out of her deep apathy only by her love for Jacques. And Luc, who starts off as Jacques's friend and protector, falls for Baladine. Depending on your perspective, the narrative is either startlingly modernist or naively primitive. As translated by Lydia Davis, it ignores conventions of plot and structure, wanders through multiple points of view and occasionally offers oddly constructed sentences. Though the novel begins with Jacques and meanders through Baladine's story, it ends with Luc (who may be a stand-in for the author) trying to make sense of it all. A contemporary author would psychologize this story to death -- these people all need a good shrink -- but Jouve leaves it mysterious, yielding a haunting story from a time when love affairs could still be tragic and people still believed in the redemptive power of art.

us,"No Pants, No Head","The Chilean author Jaime Collyer was trained as a psychologist, but judging by PEOPLE ON THE PROWL (Latin American Literary Review, paper, $13.95), he is a born storyteller. The briefest entry in this elegant and engaging collection of short fiction is less than a page long but in no way slight, either in style or content; called ''Entropy,'' it employs its very brevity as an expression of its theme. Mr. Collyer writes stories that are centered on the striking incident, the odd turn of events or the perennial peculiarities of human nature -- like the scenario in ''Our Neighbor's Last Days,'' in which a man is much more interesting to his neighbors when he might be fatally ill than when his malady turns out to be treatable. As translated by Lillian Lorca de Tagle, Mr. Collyer's style is eminently clear and dry. (Consider, for example, this description of the title character from ''A Businessman Disappears'': ''He would pierce pasta, sauce and cheese with his fork, and twirl it solemnly, like a deposed prince brought down to the gutter, intent on regaining the privileges of his position under the humblest of circumstances, even when ingesting a dish of noodles.'') Whether telling of the fishmonger's forebear whose literal understanding of the phrase ''sans culottes'' leads him to the guillotine or of a ragtag band of youths who hijack a Santiago subway train, intent on somehow taking it to Cuba, Mr. Collyer is keenly aware of the absurdity that can infect the politics of rebellion, and his sense of irony is just as keen. He seems to know full well that armchair revolutionaries do less harm to themselves and the world if they remain seated. His supremely civilized intelligence, given to teasing the imagination, is predominantly on display, but a more emotional side occasionally surfaces. And in ''Round Trip Ticket,'' when the narrator explains why he cannot face a final encounter with a woman he once loved, Mr. Collyer reveals that he is just as deft at probing the heart.

Her first 33 years of work in the medium is collected in FRANKENTHALER: A Catalogue Raisonne, Prints 1961-1994 (Abrams, $125). Pegram Harrison, an art dealer, has done the heavy lifting of documenting the finished prints and their antecedents. Suzanne Boorsch, associate curator in the department of prints and drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, contributes an essay that discusses Frankenthaler's work in printmaking and flags the seminal works; it prepares the reader to enjoy the colors and textures of the 235 prints. The excellent reproductions show to good advantage Ms. Frankenthaler's disciplined compositions, whose artful simplicity exemplified what Ms. Boorsch calls the ''endless, stunning possibilities that can result from extreme restriction.'' Of course, it only looks simple; we learn how painstaking the process of printmaking is, and that Ms. Frankenthaler sometimes tinkers for years. That her work is highly thought out does not mean it cannot also be romantic, as is shown in VALENTINE FOR MR. WONDERFUL (Rizzoli, $35). This volume, dedicated to Ms. Frankenthaler's husband, comprises just seven hand-printed intaglios and William Carlos Williams's poem ''St. Valentine.'' The prints are marked by pink tones, hearts and even Cupid himself. Although unusually literal, the images retain the artist's characteristic elegance. Ms. Frankenthaler writes in her dedication that the book ''just fell into place like a little rose'' and that she had ''very little to do with it.''

The overarching theme of the entire ceremony, in fact, was of racial healing, drawing from the celebration the same day of the Rev. Martin Luther King's birthday. The selection of speakers such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson at a morning prayer service and a series of inclusive religious and musical events during the day were especially appropriate for the swearing in of Mr. Clinton and another Southerner, Vice President Gore.

Boeing had been testing airlines' responses to the proposed extended versions. One proposed version would carry 400 passengers, like current 747's, but would have a greater range. Another would be able to fly slightly farther than the current models, with as many as 550 passengers.

Of Rowayton, CT, who led the efforts to revitalize South Norwalk in the late 1970's and 80's, died Wednesday night in Norwalk Hospital of complications following an emergency operation. Beloved wife of Francis X. Fay, Jr. and loving mother of Valle Gaynor Blake of Brighton, MA, was 77. As Founder and President of the Norwalk Preservation Trust in 1977, Mrs. Fay arranged the educational programs and forums that redirected the focus of Norwalk's urban redevelopment from demolition to rehabilitation. Concurrently, as one of five Norwalk Redevelopment Agency Commissioners, she influenced the agency between 1978 and 1981 to adopt the rehabilitation of the Washington Street Historic District, a project that won two national awards in 1988. Mrs. Fay was one of five cited in the US Department of Interior Historic Preservation Award for the ''creative use of contemporary historic preservation techniques.'' The project was also selected and she was cited for the Downtown Development Award of the Downtown Research & Development Center of NYC, ''as a demonstration of public/private partnerships creating a vibrant downtown.'' ''Valle was the inspiration behind the city's approach to restoring the wonderful assets of South Norwalk,'' said former Mayor William A. Collins, who had appointed her to the Redevelopment Agency. ''I don't belive we could have gathered enough strength in the community to support the program without her effort.'' ''Valle was the pivotal person, and her voice was the stongest in saving the South Norwalk heritage despite the tremendous opposition at the time,'' said Rod Johnson, former Redevelopment Agency Excecutive Director. Mrs. Fay's interest in architectural antiquity had been inspired as a youngster by visits to St. Genevieve, Missouri, 60 miles south of St. Louis. Her paternal ancestors, the LaVallee family, had been among the early settlers in that first white development of Missouri (1735), and had produced three governors general of what was then known as the Louisana Territory. Mrs. Fay was Chairman of the Norwalk Green Historic Commission, Trustee and Secretary of the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum and served twelve years as a member and Vice Chairman of the Norwalk Historical Commission. Mrs. Fay had been Post Master of the Rowayton Post Office from 1961 to 1963. She had been a trainee with the Women's Air Service Pilots (WASP) during WW II. She was cited for her accomplishments in 1995 by Celebrate Women!, a Norwalk organization honoring women's achievements. Mrs. Fay was born in St. Louis on March 5, 1919, and raised in nearby Webster Groves, MO, the only child of the late John A. and Ethel Bass Weber. She was a gradaute of Mary Institute (1936) in the St. Louis area. She also attended Mills and Barnard colleges. She was predeceased in 1969 by a son, Robert E. Blake III. A memorial program will be held at 7 PM, February 2, at the Norwalk Maritime Aquarium. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Norwalk Museum, 141 East Ave., Norwalk, CT 06851, or the Norwalk Maritime Aquarium, 10 Water St, South Norwalk, CT 06854.",1997-01-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"Glue, Glaze, Gum, Grabs","Combining 27 new poems with others from 10 previous collections, Nancy Willard's SWIMMING LESSONS: New and Selected Poems (Knopf, $25) reveals a poet whose gifts have remained constant throughout her career. In an early selection entitled ''Picture Puzzles,'' she claims, while assembling a jigsaw puzzle of a Nativity by Fra Angelico, ''It's because we're broken / that we love / puzzles.'' This sense of brokenness propels Ms. Willard toward discovery and understanding. Her imagery is both elemental and ethereal, her characteristic forms the litany, elegy and ballad. While she doesn't shy away from singularly painful subjects (''Clearing the Air,'' for instance, addresses the assailant who ''tried to kill me''), her overriding impulse is to celebrate the ordinary: a puffball, her son's wooden alphabet, even the hardware store: ''In a world not perfect but not bad either / let there be glue, glaze, gum, and grabs.'' Personal relationships, history and nature furnish the material for her newest work. ''The Alligator Wrestler,'' ''The Exodus of Peaches,'' ''The Wisdom of the Jellyfish'' and ''Sand Shark'' stand out and delight with their fresh, precise imagery, rendering the natural world mysterious as well as instructional. ''Swimming Lessons'' is a generous collection -- one that will please Ms. Willard's established fans and attract many new ones. Gardner McFall",1997-01-26T05:00:00+0000

She cocked her head at me and blurted: ''Why? That guy who fight the tank - he totally crazy!'' She then twirled an index finger around her temple, her way of saying ''Duh.'' Hardly a ''Miracle Worker'' moment. But it was typical of my experiences with Renzhen, a former university math instructor who came to the United States in 1991 believing (wrongly) that she would find a better teaching job. My reasons for becoming a tutor combined Pollyanna-ish social activism with too much free time. Her motivation was a more prosaic desire to pass the English-proficiency exam and a nagging suspicion that she was getting shortchanged in stores.

The main fare is usually pozole, a pork broth with a floating hunk of corn on the cob, or menudo, a stew of cow stomach and chile, often fiery hot. It's supposedly great for hangovers -- though it's unclear whether for producing or curing them.",1997-01-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Collective Art,"As the forms of fine art and the content of commercial art continue to merge, one thing that separates them is the exhibition space itself. Art on the wall is fine art; art in print is commercial. A few respected artists, like Barbara Kruger, Robbie Conal and Rodney Alan Greenblat, bridge both worlds without sacrificing either integrity or stature. And there are others, like Mark Kostabi. His paintings, prints and objects are at once satiric commentaries on the nature of the art business and a lampoon of artistic pretensions. But what makes him unique -- and anathema to the art world -- is that his art is produced on an assembly line. As he explains in his book CONVERSATIONS WITH KOSTABI (Journey Editions, $50), he takes pride in the commodification of his work and has built a reputation on the fact that he does not actually conceive or paint most his of own pictures. Virtually every canvas released from Kostabi World, his art factory, is the work of various art workers and idea people. ''I couldn't come up with that many different good ideas a day,'' he writes. The committee, as he calls his production group, develops ideas and renders the narrative and surrealist paintings in Mr. Kostabi's airbrushed-looking velvet style. Like Keith Haring's pop store, Mr. Kostabi's Kostabi World loft/gallery in SoHo sells art, artifacts and souvenirs. Owing to the large scope of production, many of his images are repetitive and some are frankly kitsch, but what makes Mr. Kostabi the artist more interesting than his conceit of creating assembly-line art is that many of the paintings, like the absurd ''Mario and His Muse,'' are genuinely funny. Despite a few bouts of pretension (''my creation of Kostabi World is like Gauguin's move to Tahiti, or like van Gogh's cutting off his ear''), ''Conversations With Kostabi'' is a genuinely honest view of a distinct artistic vision.
