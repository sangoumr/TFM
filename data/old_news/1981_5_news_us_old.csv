But last March 2nd, after finishing work at a fast-food fish restaurant near his home in southwest Atlanta, Joseph disappeared. On Easter Sunday afternoon, April 19, his mud-caked, decomposing body was pulled from the South River, in neighboring DeKalb County. The body, snagged on fallen branches at a bend in the narrow river, was discovered by a couple enjoying the budding green foliage along a bike trail. It was clad only in gym shorts. Jo-Jo Bell, who was suffocated before being dumped in the river, became still another victim of a tragedy that, with relentless regularity, knocks the breath out of a bewildered city. The table near the entrance to Northside High School's gymnasium is laden with brightly printed posters, bumper stickers and pamphlets that say ''Take a Minute, Save a Child'' and ''Help Keep Our Children Safe - Reward Up to $100,000.'' The adults filing in pick up the materials and head for the folding chairs. Most of the crowd is young and most of it, like the neighborhood around the school, is white. Off to the side, his hands in the pockets of his beige suit jacket as he chats with reporters and waits for the television cameras to be set up, is a tall, solidly built, light-complexioned black man. The woman who introduces him says he is here to discuss ''the situation in our city.''",1981-05-03T05:00:00+0000

After passing through the glitzy and extravagant lobby Trumpets turns out to be plush, somewhat sedate and thoroughly restful. Long beveled mirrors reflect the sparkle of candlelight, floral arrangements are graceful and the noise level is benign even when the place is filled or when the pianist plays in the adjoining cocktail lounge. The only flaws in the setting are chairs that are too low and slightly inadequate lighting that makes it difficult to read menus and checks. The staff is friendly and efficient, if somewhat unpolished. An especially hospitable touch comes in the matchbooks stamped with the name in which the reservation was made.",1981-05-08T05:00:00+0000

The formal response from the Syrian Defense Ministry said the missiles ''exist now, and will in the future, wherever Syrian troops are, when they need them.'' Meanwhile, Philip C. Habib, the American special envoy, began discussions in Beirut toward averting a Syrian-Israeli war. (Page 1, Column 1.) Prime Minister Begin was pessimistic about Syria's removal of the missiles in Lebanon, and American and Israeli officials believed he might soon order air strikes on the missile positions. The officials said that Mr. Begin had said in a letter to President Reagan that he was willing to allow additional time for American diplomacy to resolve the issue, but the situation was similar to that 1967, when diplomatic efforts failed.

The answer: ''Curious.'' If the opinions of a movie reviewer coincide consistently with those of the ticket-buyers, he is clearly in the wrong job. He should be producing films instead of merely submitting to them for pay. But there are times when it's quite as difficult to understand - after the fact - why a certain picture has become a hit as it is to predict what the response will be before it opens.

The Royal Court, home of the English Stage Company, was the launching pad, on May 8, 1956, for John Osborne's ''Look Back in Anger,'' the play that decisively broke open a theatrical world that was, in Arthur Miller's words, ''hermetically sealed off from life.''",1981-05-10T05:00:00+0000

Kaufman wrote ''The Fabulous Invalid'' in the late 1930's, a comedy about the ailments of the contemporary theater, Broadway has been periodically pronounced dead, dying, or at best limping along, helped, some say, by glitz, hype, or the obsessive illusions of those who work in it. Through the years, prophets of doom have bemoaned the lost Golden Age of the theater and waited in the wings for the Broadway funeral procession. And with good reason: In the 1930's, radio and the Depression seemed to be the theater's nemeses; in the 1940's, it was the war; in the 1950's, television and films (along with Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway) were the new usurpers; in the 1960's, it was American youth, whose counterculture rejected everything connected with the Establishment. And just recently, in the early 1970's, urban decay and cultural displacement were seen as the final blows: The theater was considered to be economically unviable, and its staunchest defenders and practitioners headed for the hills of California.",1981-05-10T05:00:00+0000

It is quite likely, although no document has been discovered to prove it, that after the first performance in 1597 of history's first opera, some critic had sharp things to say about the staging of Jacopo Peri's ''Dafne'': ''Why was it necessary for the composer, who himself portrayed Apollo in this stylistically muddled enterprise, to take the opportunity of studiously examining his fingernails and stalking about the stage whenever another performer was declaiming his part? And why could not Apollo himself, of all godly musicians, sing more clearly and enunciate more distinctly over the decidedly subdued accompaniment of the mistuned lutes? Does no one care anymore about the art of Italian diction?''

Entitled ''Hans Baldung Grien: Prints & Drawings,'' it is the largest and most ambitious show of the artist's work ever put on in this country. Although his name is by no means a household word, Baldung, as he is usually called, since Grien was his nickname, is considered by scholars and connoisseurs to be among the greatest of German artists, ranking only slightly behind artists such as Albrecht Durer, his teacher. His extraordinary paintings are certainly equal in quality to his drawings and prints, but Baldung worked on wood panels, which we know today to be too fragile to travel. Only three of his paintings are in this hemisphere, and those in Europe are unlikely ever to leave the museums and churches where they are currently located.

us,'A SECOND CHANCE' WITH CATHERINE DENEUVE,"Claude Lelouch's ''A Second Chance'' casts Catherine Deneuve as a murderer who has just spent 16 years in jail. Granted, there are other roles in which Miss Deneuve would be no less believable; as a salty old fisherman or a traffic cop she would undoubtedly be just as out of place. And granted, this is only one of Mr. Lelouch's feats of unnecessary daring in the film. He fractures the narrative. He disrupts scenes by zooming back and forth like a honeybee. He even sabotages his own drama at every turn. If this isn't daring, what can it be?",1981-05-15T05:00:00+0000

The director of surgery at Gemelli Hospital in Rome said that the vital signs of Pope John Paul II were ''satisfactory, but the prognosis remains guarded.'' His doctors said he was expected to be hospitalized for at least a month. (Page A1, Column 6.) The accused assailant of the Pope underwent more than 12 hours of questioning by the police in Rome. The chief of the antiterrorist squad described the prisoner, Mehmet Ali Agca, as ''cold, lucid and well trained to shoot.'' Officials in Ankara said they had uncovered links between the 23-year-old Turk and extreme right-wingers. But the Italian authorities were uncertain who had trained him, who had helped him to escape from prison in Turkey and who had paid for his extensive wanderings through Europe.

The latest figures show that their combined assets have climbed above $41 billion but that inflation had actually reduced the purchasing power of their holdings over the last seven years by 30 percent. The 1,100 participants at the four-day conference which ended yeaterday agreed that requests for assistance have soared. Some estimate that requests had risen by 30 percent; others said that they had doubled. For many, these developments underscore a widespread and what they consider to be an unrealistic expectation among the public and government officials that foundations and corporations will somehow find funds to make up for the expected reductions in Federal spending for a broad range of services. ""The gap between the resources available and the sizeof the job is too great,"" said Richard W. Lyman, president of the Rockefeller Foundation. ""It is bad tactics as well as bad thinking to let America at large believe that foundations rolling up their sleeves can take care of what's needed."" No 'Gloom and Doom' But others, including Dr. David E. Roger, president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, expressed a more optimistic outlook. ""I don't find gloom and doom out there, and I see a positive response. I see a lot of people saying 'yes we can'."" The Johnson Foundation, the country's largest in the field of health with $1 billion in assets, spends about $50 million a year on improving care for what it terms the 'underserved population.""",1981-05-17T05:00:00+0000

Growing up gradually alongside this in the past five or six decades, a vigorous literature in the Afrikaans language emerged, distinguished especially for its poets, about whom non-Afrikaners in South Africa as well as in the outside world knew little. And in the 1950's some distinctive black voices began to be heard, only to be smothered by an official persecution, of which censorship was by no means the harshest form. (In South Africa, not just specific writings but the writers themselves -and, consequently, any words they have ever spoken or written - can be ''listed'' and ''banned.'') As the apartheid era unfolded, the experience and orientation of the writers in the various ethnic and racial groups differed so drastically that only literary do-gooders, in their most fatuous moments, were disposed to speak of a South African literature.",1981-05-17T05:00:00+0000

In contrast to the sepia-toned shadows of the photographs, in which darkness tends to dominate and control the light, the paintings of landcape tend to be sun-drenched. Even the shadows in the paintings tend to be more light-filled than Mr. Cantor's photographs ever are, and there is an obvious effort to confer on every painted image - whether it is a landscape or an interior still life - a degree of clarity and luminosity.",1981-05-17T05:00:00+0000

Aged picturesque specimens are often 25 to 30 feet tall with branches strong enough to support a swing. Several varieties remain shrubs of 15 feet of less and are ideal for small scale gardens. Crabapples flower from late April into early June depending on the variety. Blossoms may be one-to-two inch singles of doubles in hues of white blush, pink, rose and carmine red. Some deliciously fragrant. Many bear tiny 1/2 to 1 1/2 inch berrylike apples which ripen to brilliant red, rusty-orange or golden-yellow in September cultivated crabapple varieties, some of which are my favorite speing flowering trees. Crabapples, Malus species and hybrids, differ from apples by the size and taste of their fruits. Both are members of the Rose Family. Not all crabapples exhibit the glorious traits for year-round bequty. Some are generally unattractive, flower sparingly and only in alternate years. Fruits can be large and messy when they fall. There are also disease problems. Several crabapple varieties are disease resistant while other are only slightly susceptible. Still other are severely susceptible. The following favorite varieties are special in their flower, fruit, frangrance, color or habit. They are available at quality nurseries and garden centers or from mail-orders sources.

SUGGESTIONS FOR TAKING BETTER VACATION SLIDES","Many people dread seeing slide shows that consist of vacation pictures taken by friends or relatives - and with good reason. All too often, these shows are long and boring as a result of insufficient planning, haphazard shooting and careless editing. However, interesting slide shows of vacation pictures have been presented by diligent photographers who plan properly, and a slide show that will be interesting to watch can also be put together by almost any photographer capable of using a camera successfully. All you have to do is resist the temptation to shoot endless succession of typical vacation snapshots in which family members or friends are posed next to or in front of some all-too-familiar tourist attractions. Instead, by making an effort to communicate the distinctive character of a particular setting you can shoot vacation pictures that will eventually form a presentation which will inform and entertain a wide range of viewers. The photographic techique of avoiding the obvious and staying away from sterotypes can be successfully applied to practically every vacation picturetaking sequence, but it is even more important that the photographer first realize that not everything that happens in front of the lens will be worth recording on film Being selective in you shooting not only saves time, it also conserves expensive film and cuts down on the amount of work you will have to do during the editing process. Although it has often been said that what separates the professional photographer from the amateur is the greater amount of film the professional uses, it would be more accurate to say that what distinguishes the professional is that he knows when not to shoot.",1981-05-17T05:00:00+0000

Here are a few of the latest: The Fujica HD-S ""All Weather"" CAmera (List $265) is a new concept in compact, lightweight cameras that will be of interest to sports enthusiasts, travelers, and photographers who like to take pictures under any and all weather conditions. This 35mm, autoexposure camera has a built in electronic flash and is completely sealed to protect it against drenching rain, sleet, snow and blowing dust or sand. A big, bright optical finder shows zone-focusing symbols while the camera is at the eye-level viewing postion, making it possible for the photographer to change focus without taking his eye away from the finder. The programmed electronic shutter automatically sets itself for continous speeds of from 1/8th to 1/500th of a second, and a shutter lock prevents accidental shutter release. Although not an underwater camera, the HD-S is completely water-resistant. Built-in 'O' rings and silicone rubber packing around all moving joints keeps out water and dust, while resin/ fiber materials serve to shockproof the camera. All this makes it an ideal instrument for such outdoor sports as swimming, fishing, boating, backpacking, and camping in all kinds of weather. Minolta Auto-Meter III (List $175) is a dual-function exposure meter for measuring both incident and reflected light. Despite the proliferation of cameras with built-in exposure meters, there are conditions which still require hand-held meters for accurate metering of light, and the Auto-Meter III is unlike any hand-held exposure meter now on the market.",1981-05-17T05:00:00+0000

Yet these Wilis look very different from the ones in Ballet Theater's previous staging of ''Giselle'' by David Blair. They have longer white tutus and each woman, with hair parted in the middle, is a replica of Giselle. What is really new is the entire stance of the corps.

Young musicians especially must be allowed considerable room in which to try on personalities and be granted license to abandon them if they happen not to fit, like last year's suit. So let it merely be noted here at the start that Ivo Pogorelich, the 22-year-old Yugoslav pianist who appeared last evening at Carnegie Hall is something of an eccentric in dress and stage manners. He affected a string tie and a shirt with a stand-up collar, and wore his hair in a style that might be called electrified shaggy. He struck dazed postures between numbers (Oh, where am I? Do I wake or sleep?) and in general did what he could to avoid appearing in the least conventional.

us,"MORALITY IN MAKING POLICY;
PHILADELPHIA - Our ethical systems are irrelevant, inconsistent, and ineffective as tools of consensus in policy making. A confluence of historical factors has produced this disorder in the moral dimension of policy formation. Judeo-Christian morality is ill-suited as a guideline in dealing with increasingly complex problems. In addition, the utilitarianism that pervades policy generates a stream of dissenters who consider social choices unjust.  The utilitarian principle of promoting the greatest good for the greatest number is a political slogan that is rarely a useful tool of policy. And so, the moral regimes propose, and the moral minorities, through obstruction and indifference, dispose.","The policymaker's role is to reconcile technical and moral judgments. He confronts three major categories of moral posture. A large segment of the public, the religionists, is hostile to the policymaker because his policy rubs against their religious sentiments. The ethic of a second segment, the utilitarian situationalists, comprises assessing contemplated behavior in terms of probable benefits and costs; the extent to which the situationalists tolerate costs varies inversely with the proximity to themselves of those who bear the costs. The third group, which lacks a structured moral system, is the narcissists. They affect policy because of the policymaker's inability to count on them for its effective execution. Their behavior is summarized by the dictum: If it makes you feel good, do it, unless the action creates intolerable costs to the doer. The narcissists have the least sense of moral obligation - a requisite for the effective operation of a society.",1981-05-22T05:00:00+0000

BAD MANAGERS AREN'T THE B-SCHOOLS FAULT","The short-term profit orientation of United States corporate managers is increasingly blamed for the failure of American companies' capital spending to keep pace with that of their foreign counterparts. In turn, that failing is increasingly being traced to the nation's business schools. ''Modern corporations,'' the story goes, ''are run by financial managers who are excessively concerned with 'the bottom line.'

Around 5 P.M. on April 22, 1915, after an idle afternoon, heavy German guns resumed their bombardment of the small market town of Ypres.

Perhaps when the French colonials (mostly Algerian Arabs) and Canadians in the forward positions first heard the hissing sound coming from the German side, they thought some rounds had misfired - or maybe they thought nothing. But within minutes a greenish-yellow cloud, which distant observers compared to mist ''such as is seen over water meadows on a frosty night,'' stretched itself for five miles over the front.

These were not news events in the manner of space shots or historic journeys or a royal marriage. Such events generally follow tight and tidy schedules. They can be followed and reported, for the most part, with the precision found in a scripted movie. The breaking news story is a decidedly messy affair, especially in the first hours. It takes time for the giant networks of electronic apparatus to gear up to full working strength. Then, the on-air correspondents are forced to juggle conflicting reports, rumors and speculations. The worst that can happen did when, during the Reagan story, all three networks were verifying an erroneous report that James S. Brady, the President's press secretary, had died. Stung by subsequent criticism, television news was noticeably more cautious in covering the shooting of the Pope.",1981-05-24T05:00:00+0000

us,ART: THE IMPASTO WORLD OF WALTER DARBY BANNARD,"ARTISTS have been mixing their paint with ''alien'' substances for most of the 20th century. But it has taken the invention of plastics to make the practice widespread and, while in earlier times the use of additives sometimes denoted the material poverty of the artist, the reverse is true today. Pigment now is as likely to be combined with body-building compounds as it is with mere oil and turpentine, and the texture of a canvas can resemble practically anything from a hooked rug to junk food. The ''process'' movement of the 1960's greatly encouraged the trend by giving a new twist to the old notion of ''truth to materials.'' Similarly, the very style of Color-Field painting was to a great extent determined by the synthetic paints employed. It was logical, therefore, that such representatives of the movement as Jules Olitski and Walter Darby Bannard should have continued experimenting with new materials.",1981-05-29T05:00:00+0000

Gelb The late-afternoon sun barely penetrated the sedate office, with its wood-paneled walls and Colonial-style furniture, as the Secretary of State mused on America's situation in the world. ''I think we've got more going for us,'' he said during the course of a 90-minute interview, ''than we've had historically in the last 30 years.'' The ''beleaguered'' Russian leaders, he added, must understand that ''there are hopes for arms control, hopes for the West to assist them in solving their dilemmas in the economic and agricultural spheres.'' Of course, there would be a price - ''some reining in of what has been a hemorrhaging of risk-taking.''",1981-05-31T05:00:00+0000

True, you may know less in some ways. Time does not necessarily improve memory. But in the course of time, strange odds and ends - or even fundamental facts not recognized in the noonday sun -may, out of blank idleness of a later mind, rise up, trailing God knows what, like a half-rotten log disturbed in a creek bed trailing algae, patched with moss, clung to by some strange, snail-like creatures, with a rusty length of barbed wire still nailed to it. What rises so gratuitously out of the deep of time may be a set of relationships and connections of which you had been unaware when things were fresh. The unconscious thing may, years later, become startlingly conscious, seemingly by accident. That is why it is always hard to say precisely when and how a book - or anything else - ''began.''",1981-05-31T05:00:00+0000

NEW YORK'S JOB LAG","T HE limited nature of the city's economic revival is mirrored in the labor markets. Although the unemployment rate in 1980 was basically unchanged in New York City while rising sharply in the rest of the country, joblessness continued to be much higher in the city. The stability of the city's jobless rate was largely the result of a reduction of the size of the city's labor force and not because its job market was substantially stronger than the nation's. Indeed, if the city's labor force had grown in 1980 at the same rate as the nation's, all other things being the same, the city's unemployment rate would have risen to 10.9 percent instread of remaining unchanged at 8.6 percent.",1981-05-31T05:00:00+0000

Certainly, the great novelists of the mid 19th century, celebrated in F.O. Matthiessen's ''The American Renaissance'' and D.H. Lawrence's ''Studies in Classic American Literature,'' have chosen self-pity over irony or frankness in talking about their relationship to the marketplace. The classic statement is Melville's, ''Dollars damn me ... all my books are botches. ...'' And implicit in this melancholy cry from the heart is a belief, as strong and pertinacious as any myth by which we live, that the authentic writer is neither drawn to nor confirmed in his vocation by the hope of marketplace success, the dream of becoming rich and famous; but can only be seduced by lucre, led to betray or prostitute his talent.",1981-05-31T05:00:00+0000

The 12-year, $3-million project, which has been underway for several months, has already produced evidence that Vatican scholars triumphantly contend makes possible a new evaluation of the master artist as a painter. Michelangelo's frescoes in the famous chapel include the monumental ''Last Judgment'' on the huge altar wall, the even more gigantic depiction of the origins of the universe that covers the entire huge ceiling and 14 more modest lunettes depicting the ancestors of Jesus. So far the restorers have finished one lunette and started work on a second. The result is startling. The restored lunette, on the entrance wall, is bursting with colors. The figures have become so three-dimensional they fairly jump out of the wall. The part of the adjoining lunette that has not yet been cleaned is dark and dull by comparison and its figures are shadowy against a dim background.",1981-05-31T05:00:00+0000

With power centered in West Pakistan, the more populous East Pakistan demanded greater economic benefits and political change. Rioting broke out in the East in 1968. In 1970 the separatists in the East won a majority in the National Assembly and called for more independence, but Assembly sessions were postponed by Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan, who was then President. Rioting in the East erupted into civil war and Bangladesh was declared independent, forcing the resignation of Mr. Yahya Khan. Sheik Mujibur Rahman, a leader of the Bengali nationalists in the East, became Prime Minister but was killed in a 1975 coup. His successor was also deposed, and Maj. Gen.

An old man, as I knowed, as good a sailor as ever sailed, was mighty fussy over his eating and he first showed me how to make potted salmon out of the fish in cans. It is a tip-top relish spread on a bit of bread. Take your salmon out of the can, and pick out bones, but mostly they are so soft as to do no harm. Just you pound that smooth in a mortar. Take that pounded fish and put it in a jar, which jar place in a pipkin with hot water. Bring up the water to a boil; when your fish is hot, say for a two-pound can, stir in a quarter of a pound of good butter and a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy; or you may take three anchovies and bruise them up fine and mix them in. It must be hot, so put in a saltspoonful of cayenne pepper and a shred of mace; chop your mace fine.
