The opposition leader, Sheik Ahmad Moaz al-Khatib, said many critics had not fully read the explanations he had posted Wednesday on his Facebook page. Sheik Khatibs offer to open a dialogue with the government, which contained several conditions, received a measure of support from Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, and Lakhdar Brahimi, the peace envoy for the Arab League and the United Nations. But the offer to start talks broke a longstanding opposition demand: no talks until Mr. Assad steps down. Sheik Khatib said in his Facebook posting that he would be willing to talk with Mr. Assads representatives in Egypt, Tunisia or Turkey, all of which support the Syrian opposition. He also demanded other preconditions, including the release of 160,000 prisoners in Syria. Nobody has said it is going to be easy, Mr. Brahimi said. But perhaps negotiating is better than killing each other. ",2013-02-01T01:37:29+0000

Mayor Mitch Landrieu had invited in Department of Justice officials to investigate the department in 2010, and celebrated the signing of the consent decree last July. But on Jan. 11, when a federal judge formally approved the document, the mayor made known publicly that the city wanted out, insisting that the costs of police reform combined with the costs of a separate consent decree pertaining to the city jail would do catastrophic damage to the city budget.

But when we got to the field the next day, Shepherds enthusiasm evaporated. While Beau and the other kids ran zigzags around the cones, Shepherd stood still and looked bewildered. When it was his turn to kick the ball, he seemed lost. After 15 minutes, he walked off the field and sat down in my lap, saying he was too tired to play. We watched the other kids, and I pointed out to him the drills I thought he might enjoy, the ones that Beau was charging through. But he refused to go back to the field. His passivity didnt concern me much  he was 3, after all, and I already thought of him, in the way that parents tend to categorize their children even as we tell ourselves we shouldnt, as a little clingy and not especially athletic. My husband, Darin, and I had recently noticed that Shepherd occasionally walked with a limp, but it was faint enough that sometimes when you looked for it, it was gone.

Mr. Airikyan was shot in the shoulder by an unknown assailant but is expected to make a full recovery. Investigators offered no immediate motive for the attack. He spent years in Soviet prisons for promoting Armenian independence and was stripped of his citizenship and expelled to Ethiopia in 1988. He lived in Los Angeles before returning to Armenia after the fall of the Soviet Union. He has run for president several times but never won more than a small share of the vote. A provision in the Constitution allows for the postponement of elections by two weeks if a candidate faces an insurmountable obstacle and potentially for another 40 days if the obstacle cannot be removed.

Concentrating on the broken sidewalk under my feet, and wishing not to trip, I hadnt noticed the elephant until I nearly walked smack into him, eyeball to eyeball. Needless to say, it was a startling encounter. In my beloved Bronx, I had bumped into plenty of interesting creatures but no elephants.

Murphy, above, a Roman Catholic priest in Wisconsin who died in 1998 after having molested dozens if not hundreds of children in his care at a boarding school for the deaf, resulting in a trail of denial and cover-up from rural America to the Vatican. Mr. Gibneys methods are a blend of solid journalism and cinematic sensationalism, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The reliance on melodramatic music and lurid  though not explicit  re-enactments does not seem to me to make the movie more powerful, but rather the opposite. There is something to be said for a clear and unblinking recitation of facts, and thankfully Mr. Gibney does a lot of that. But the heart of the film, the real source of its emotional impact, Mr. Scott said, lies in a remarkable series of interviews with some of the men, most now in their 60s, who endured Father Murphys assaults when they were children and who have worked for almost 40 years to bring his crimes to light. John Slattery, Jamey Sheridan, Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke interpret their words. ",2013-02-04T05:01:21+0000

(Three additional auctions will follow in May, August and November, each featuring three covers from the original 12-issue series published by DC Comics.) Written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons, Watchmen ushered in a new level of mature storytelling with adult themes and flawed heroes. Gibbons sold the covers and original artwork to Watchmen  pitifully cheap, he noted  nearly as quickly as he created it, fearing that there would be no takers. It seemed like a good idea to me at the time, he said. In my experience, the sort of comic art that sold well were kind of money shots  big action shots of the heroes in costumes doing something interesting. I realized that Watchmen was filled with a lot of meat and potatoes stuff, people standing around talking, which I didnt think would be as popular. The series went on to become a perennial best seller. It was adapted into a live action film that was released in 2009 and, last year, DC began publishing a series of prequels called Before Watchmen, which caused some consternation with fans and creators who felt that Watchmen should stand alone.",2013-02-06T14:00:56+0000

(MoreMax) THE DESCENDANTS (2011) Matt King (George Clooney, in an Oscar-nominated role), a real estate lawyer whose family tree includes the earliest white settlers in Hawaii as well as indigenous royalty, struggles to make the right decision regarding his familys birthright: a pristine and picturesque tract on Kauai. Should it be sold to developers? In the meantime his wife, Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), is in a coma in a Honolulu hospital after a boating accident. Not long after her doctors inform Matt that he is about to become a widower and a single father to two difficult daughters, Scottie (Amara Miller) and Alex (Shailene Woodley), he learns that Elizabeth was having an affair. Robert Forster portrays Elizabeths enraged father, who blames his daughters condition on Matts tightwad ways; Matthew Lillard plays Brian, the object of Elizabeths affection; Judy Greer is Brians wife; Nick Krause (above, with, from left, Mr. Clooney, Ms. Miller and Ms. Woodley) is Alexs goofy sidekick; and Beau Bridges is Matts cousin. Mr. Clooneys actorly instincts have never been keener or more generous, and Ms. Woodley gives one of the toughest, smartest, most credible adolescent performances in recent memory, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this drama directed by Alexander Payne and based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings. He added: Mr. Payne, with a light touch and a keen sense of place  this Hawaii is as real and peculiar as the Nebraska of About Schmidt or the California wine country of Sideways  has made a movie that, for all its modesty, is as big as life. Its heart is occupied by grief, pain and the haunting silence of Elizabeth, whose version of events is the only one we never hear. And yet it is also full of warmth, humor and the kind of grace that can result from our clumsy attempts to make things better. ",2013-02-07T06:00:05+0000

This years awards will almost certainly include Ernest Borgnine, Charles Durning, Nora Ephron, Tony Scott, Richard Zanuck and Marvin Hamlisch, but since the Academy expanded the list to include notable film industry figures like makeup artists and publicists, there are often unpredictable honors and snubs. The commemoration of lesser-known figures has led to the exclusion of Corey Haim, Farrah Fawcett and Bea Arthur, among others, omissions that can feel less like benign neglect than a slight.

If that isnt fodder for a writing career  coupled with the fact that I would never be a beauty queen or shrink  I dont know what is. When I was very young, working in my grandfathers corner grocery in West Virginia, I would sneak on top of the giant freezers and hide so I could watch folks come in and out, listening to what they said, what they didnt say, my grandfather at the register in his apron, smoking, or in the back making hamburg from an entire side of beef. (After breaking down the cow, cleaver in hand, hed flex his biceps and dare me to hang off of it.) I remember feeling like everything I was watching was operatic somehow. Like I was privy to secrets. I knew even then that if I kept quiet and paid attention, my world would be filled with stories. That this suggestion of boundless possibility happened in a tar-strip-road factory town was an additional gift. Stories that count are everywhere, all the time. Beauty too.",2013-02-08T16:38:27+0000

Put down the foundation brush, forget about using your fingertips and opt for her favorite skin-perfecting tool: the Beautyblender cosmetic sponge. Designed to be used in a dabbing motion, It gives you the effect of actual skin texture, so it amazingly looks like youre not wearing anything, she says. In addition, its rounded egg-shape allows you to blend makeup without leaving behind a single streak. For the Costello Tagliapietra runway show yesterday, Ryoke gave the models faces a slightly dewy finish by first wetting the sponge with mineral water.

Sheriff Leroy D. Baca began the termination process against the deputies this week after reviewing results of an internal affairs investigation. The deputies can appeal the firings to the states civil service board. While investigators did not find any criminal behavior by the group, officials have recently begun to discipline such cliques because of concerns that they encourage unethical, ganglike and violent behavior and hurt the departments reputation, particularly in black and Latino neighborhoods. A pamphlet explaining the groups creed said members were not afraid to get our hands dirty, according to The Los Angeles Times, which first reported on the groups existence. The seven deputies were removed from duty with pay last year, officials said. ",2013-02-09T00:42:32+0000

Hugo had begun the sprawling novel in the 1840s, put it aside, and come back to complete it between 1860 and 1862. He was an opponent of slavery, and in 1859 defended John Brown. Insurrection, he said, was a sacred duty. In the novel, Hugo name-checked Brown in a list of celebrated revolutionaries that included Washington, Bolivar and Garibaldi. Hugos focus was the July Revolution of 1830, but it is possible he had the American conflict in mind when he wrote, Civil war  What did the words mean? Was there any such thing as foreign war?

(Sundance) IN THE LOOP (2009) While giving an interview to the BBC, the British minister of international development (Tom Hollander) departs from the official line and becomes the focus of tensions between Britain and the United States as they gear up to invade a Middle Eastern country. Given a chance to backtrack, he digs himself in deeper. Peter Capaldi plays a British press officer. James Gandolfini (above, with Mimi Kennedy) is a dovish Pentagon general. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said, The genius of In the Loop, directed by Armando Iannucci and written by a crack team of British wits, is that it turns this mountain into a series of festering molehills. While the film is a highly disciplined inquiry into a very serious subject, he added, it is also, line by filthy line, scene by chaotic scene, by far the funniest big-screen satire in recent memory.",2013-02-09T06:00:06+0000

Business investment isnt actually all that low; you expect it to be relatively weak in a weak economy with excess capacity, but in fact its about as high a share of GDP as in the middle Bush years.

And audiences responded, overlooking sharply negative reviews.

All the extensions were dyed by Larry [Raspanti] at Whittemore House Salon, and its sort of the idea of seeing hair as a cosmetic, Palau says. The fakeness of the extensions is a part of the look; its about taking away each girls individual personality and creating a uniformity. To give the hairstyle a futuristic feel, the front portion was tightly slicked back with loads of styling gel, and Palau amped up the shine factor even further by applying a small amount of Redken Diamond Oil (available in May) onto each models head right before she stepped out onto the runway.",2013-02-10T19:35:33+0000

A dedicatory letter was appended from the rector of the University of Wittenberg, Johannes Gottfried Kraus, who praised the natural genius of Africa, its appreciation for learning, and its inestimable contribution to the knowledge of human affairs and of divine things. Kraus placed Amo in a lineage that includes many North African Latin authors of antiquity, such as Terence, Tertullian and St. Augustine.In the following decade, the Scottish philosopher David Hume would write: I am apt to suspect the Negroes, and in general all other species of men to be naturally inferior to the whites. There never was any civilized nation of any other complection than white, nor even any individual eminent in action or speculation.Hume had not heard of Amo, that much is clear. But we can also detect a tremendous difference between Humes understanding of human capacities and that of Kraus: the author of Amos dedicatory letter doesnt even consider the possibility of anchoring what individual human beings are capable of doing to something as arbitrary as complection. For Kraus, Amo represents a continent and its long and distinguished history; he does not represent a race.",2013-02-11T00:15:41+0000

Hisstatement of resignationbasically acknowledges as much, citing the realities of todays world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith as a particular reason why greater strength of mind and body than he now possesses is required of the successor to Saint Peter. These lines are an implicit nod not only to the particular challenges facing his pontificate, but also to the vast changes that mass media and global travel have wrought in the papacys role. Now that globetrotting face of Catholicism and media-savvy C.E.O. of a controversial brand have been added to the theological and administrative obligations inherent in the office, the burdens of age are arguably more of an impediment to papal effectiveness than ever before, and the mix of stasis and confusion created by a pontiffs slow decline can have more immediately disastrous effects than they might have had in an era when papal incapacity could be a Roman secret rather than a global spectacle.",2013-02-11T21:13:23+0000

Among their children, the researchers identified 270 with autism spectrum disorders, including 114 with autism disorder. The researchers found that the risk of having a child with autism disorder was reduced by 40 percent among women who had taken folic acid supplements during the critical developmental period from four weeks before conception and continuing eight weeks into the pregnancy. Still, the absolute risk that a child would have autism disorder was very low: 0.2 percent among women not taking folic acid, versus 0.1 percent among those who did. The study was published online on Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association. ",2013-02-13T01:07:37+0000

Naming Marianne Faithfull and Joan Jett as the muses for the smoky-eyed, monochromatic look, Nars says the process of arriving at this concept was quite easy: We both love the 60s and 70s era. There were so many great characters at that time! The focus on black-and-white tones not only referenced the punk-rock chic inspiration, but was also a practical consideration. With the first part of the runway show taking place under a sepia glow, Nars needed to come up with an idea that would look striking in both types of lighting. So we did a black smoky eye with white pencil used on the inner rim to make the eyes pop and look bigger, and the eyebrows are strong and defined, he says. The skin is totally matte, and at the last minute I put a little grease on top of the eye makeup and clear gloss on the lips so it looks like the girl went out, stayed out all night and got her makeup a little sweaty.",2013-02-15T20:20:03+0000

us,Iran: Pistachio Exports Are Suspended,"Pistachio nuts, one of Irans most profitable products, appear to be latest victim of domestic inflation, so much so that the government has ordered a moratorium on exports as part of an effort to increase the supply at home and reduce the price, which has doubled just in the past month. The Associated Press quoted Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi as saying the export ban would last for six months. But it was unclear whether the move, which he announced Friday, would reduce domestic prices, particularly in time for Nowruz, the coming New Year holiday when pistachios are in especially high demand. It was also unclear to what extent the higher price reflected the declining value of the rial, Irans currency, which has been weakened by the effects of Western sanctions and what critics call the governments economic mismanagement. The chairman of Irans chamber of exports, Asadollah Asgaroladi, was quoted by the Fars News Agency as calling the export moratorium a mistake that would do little to ease the price and probably cost Iran more than $500 million in lost export revenue.

The police officers were captured by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in January, shortly after the group ended a two-month unilateral cease-fire. Government peace negotiators reacted angrily to the officers capture and the FARC quickly promised to release them. The FARC and the government began talks last fall to end their nearly 50-year war. Also on Friday, another rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, released five mining company contractors it kidnapped last month, said the International Committee of the Red Cross, which assisted with the release. In a Twitter post President Juan Manuel Santos criticized the ELN for not also releasing a Canadian captive. ",2013-02-16T05:15:23+0000

So there are two possibilities: the police version, which is that he murdered her in cold blood after a violent argument, or the Pistorius version, which is that it was a regrettable accident. Either way, if there was no gun in the house, Steenkamp would still be alive.

us,Renewal of AIDS Program Backed," The 10-year-old program to fight global AIDS started by the Bush administration is doing a good job and should be funded again after it expires this year, a panel of medical experts recommended Wednesday. But countries getting aid should be pushed to manage more of their own programs and pay more of the costs, the panel said. The experts, from the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academies of Science, were asked by Congress to evaluate the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which has spent about $38 billion. In 2007, the institute criticized Congressional restrictions, saying too much money went to abstinence education. The new report said the program had become increasingly flexible about preventing H.I.V. infections, but needs to do more about sexual transmission. It also needs to do better at getting patients into medical care and assuring that they take their antiretroviral drugs daily. ",2013-02-21T01:23:49+0000

The Catholic Church has faced strong criticism after a rape victim was recently turned away by two hospitals it runs in Cologne, because staff members were concerned about having to counsel the woman about emergency contraception. In a statement issued Thursday, the bishops said they had not been aware that various forms of emergency contraception were available, and after consulting with medical experts and with the Vatican, agreed that administering drugs that in no way aborted a fertilized egg was justified in cases of rape. The bishops said the new policy would be discussed with hospitals run by the church to ensure that women who have been the victims of rape are provided human, medical, psychological and pastoral support, which could include administration of the morning-after pill.

American Masters begins its 27th season with this chronicle of Ms. Tharpes life, from her impoverished childhood as the daughter of cotton pickers in Arkansas and her adolescence in Chicago, where she developed her distinctive performing style in church, to her move to New York. There she caught the eye of Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington through songs laden with sexual innuendo at the Cotton Club and Caf Society. But soon she returned to her gospel roots and drew packed houses throughout the United States and Europe. Directed by Mick Csaky, this documentary merges archival performance footage with new interviews with Joe Boyd, the tour manager of the 1964 American Folk, Blues and Gospel Caravan; Howard Carroll of the Dixie Hummingbirds; Roxie Moore, a lifelong friend; and Gayle Wald, a Tharpe biographer.",2013-02-22T06:00:15+0000

us,Me and My Shadow,"For creative writing teachers, stalkers are such a basic condition of employment that, in the interest of full disclosure, they should probably be included in the job ad: Poor pay; negligible benefits (if any); and yes, you will be stalked. As James Lasdun discovers in this smart, rigorous and beautifully written memoir about being on the unwelcome end of someone elses attention, its not always easy to determine that precise moment when the already peculiar relationship between a creative writing student and a teacher starts to go horribly wrong. Sometimes, the student might just be a bit too conscientious about doing the homework  and that homework turns out to be you.",2013-02-22T15:33:01+0000

That sea  wide, deep and often treacherous  is what remains of the British Empire for historians to trawl, though few attempt to chart the whole of it in one relatively compact volume. Darwin managed something similar with his previous books The Empire Project: The Rise and Fall of the British World-System, 1830-1970 and After Tamerlane: The Global History of Empire Since 1405  emerging from the imperial brine with poise and balance where lesser historians would have beached themselves like lost whales or glugged down to the depths, tangled in the tentacles of a giant squid. In Unfinished Empire, he turns his attention to the British Empires why, who and how: small words that signify very big questions.",2013-02-22T15:34:12+0000

Umbrellas do play bit parts in Will Selfs ambitious new novel, but they also echo the fates of its characters, themselves bit players in the vast, indifferent dramas that dominate modern British life. Impersonal bureaucracies and brutal industrial processes serve less as backdrops than as the central obsessions of the book, which moves us through the munitions factories and killing fields of World War I, a psychiatric hospital and a creepily gentrified modern London where those who cant afford exorbitant rents are ruthlessly pushed out. In this world, people are as disposable as umbrellas, which are never contracted for, only mysteriously acquired, to be fleetingly useful, then annoying and cumbersome before eventually being lost.

When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, she welcomed the collapse of the Communist government. Four years later, however, Wolfs reputation was stained by a shocking revelation: she had collaborated with East German intelligence officers in the early 1960s.

The assassination this month of a leftist opposition leader set off protests against the Islamist-led government. Many blamed the governing party, Ennahda, for failing to prevent the killing, in part by failing to crack down on more hard-line Islamist groups. In response, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali of Ennahda called for the replacement of the coalition government with a cabinet of technocrats. He resigned when his party overruled him. Some Tunisians fault Mr. Laarayedh, the interior minister, for failing to protect the assassinated opposition leader, Chokri Belaid, or to apprehend his killers. Mr. Laarayehd endured more than a decade of imprisonment and torture under Tunisias former dictator. He is considered among the least conservative members of his party, which is less conservative than most other Islamist parties in the region.

(ABC) DREAMGIRLS (2006) Three Detroit singers, portrayed, above from left, by Anika Noni Rose, Beyonc Knowles and Jennifer Hudson, discover the price of fame in Bill Condons adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same title.

Eddie Murphy won an Oscar nomination for his turn as James (Thunder) Early, a soul man loosely based on James Brown.

That song has been this musicals calling card since the first Broadway production 25 years ago, but to see Ms. Hudson tear into it on screen nonetheless brings the goose-bumped thrill of witnessing something new, even historic.

us,Banksy Work Removed From Miami Auction,"A stenciled work by the British graffiti artist Banksy was withdrawn from auction in Miami on Saturday after residents of a London community lobbied to reclaim it, The Associated Press reported. The mural, Slave Labor (Bunting Boy), above, features a young boy using an old-fashioned sewing machine to create Union Jack flags. It appeared last May on a wall outside a discount store in Haringey, a north London borough, but subsequently vanished this month, leaving only a patch of exposed brick. After learning that the work would be auctioned, members of the Haringey Council sent an open letter to Fine Art Auctions Miami requesting that the work be returned. The piece was expected to fetch $500,000 to $700,000, but the auction house removed it from the planned sale without explanation. Claire Kober, who leads the Haringey Council, said the council wants to bring the work back to London.",2013-02-24T22:48:57+0000

At the end of last week, in a bill of six ballets by the founding choreographer Frederick Ashton (1904-88), the most conservative of mid-20th century theater masters, the dancers looked unaffected, fulfilled and marvelously contemporary. Yet in a program of George Balanchines Apollo and world premieres by Alexei Ratmansky and Christopher Wheeldon, the two finest choreographers working internationally in ballet today, everybody applied lots of exaggerated facial expressions, as if nobody trusted the movement to speak for itself. I shall return to the Ashton program in a later review. Here I respond to the premieres and Apollo. ",2013-02-24T22:55:42+0000

The announcement last week that the elections would begin on April 27 and 28 and continue on May 4 and 5 set off an uproar among Coptic Christians because the overlap with their holidays would have put a special burden on Coptic voters. Mr. Morsi is a Muslim who led the Muslim Brotherhoods political arm, and the scheduling decision also raised questions about his awareness of the concerns of Coptic Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Egypts 85 million residents. Almost any Copt could have told the government that the initial voting plan called for balloting on both holidays. Citing unnamed sources in the presidents office, Egyptian state media said the initial scheduling was an unintentional error and quickly fixed. The elections will now begin on April 22.

An economy open to new concepts and novel ventures is bound to generate unequal gains. To tax all of those gains would close off the prospects for success that many entrepreneurs need if they are to undertake ambitious ventures  a big mistake. But it would also be a mistake to misunderstand the relation of inequality and innovation. It is less innovation  not more  that has widened inequality in the United States in recent decades.Americas peak years of indigenous innovation ran from the 1820s to the 1960s. There were a few financial panics and two depressions, to be sure. But in this period, a frenzy of creative activity, economic competition and rapid growth in national income provided widening economic inclusion, rising wages for all and engaging careers for most. Innovations gave workers better tools to work with and better products to make, thus lifting their wages. Then this innovation began to retreat, most of it to an area of land along the West Coast. In the early 1970s the rate of indigenous innovation (as measured by its estimated contribution to the rate of growth in labor productivity) dropped by about half  to around 1 percent since then, from about 2 percent before then.",2013-02-25T02:13:34+0000

The appeals court concluded that the state did not show a substantial special need in requiring that applicants be tested when no suspicion of drug use was evident.

us,The Magical Realism of Norwegian Nights,"It was in the late 80s that I saw the northern lights for the first time. I was 18 and had moved to an island in the far north of Norway to take a job as a teacher in a little school in one of the small villages up there. The village was located in the shadow of a steep, barren mountain chain, looking out on the Atlantic Ocean. Fewer than 300 people lived there, and almost all of them were involved in fishing, either as fishermen on small vessels, or as workers in the fish warehouse. It was an exposed place. One night a roof was ripped off and a camping trailer was overturned by high winds; some of the buildings had been fastened to guy wires. Everything came from the sea: the wind, the clouds, the rain, the waves and the fish, which were at the center of village life. Few of the houses had gardens; there was no buffer between civilization and nature. When you opened the door, it felt as if you were stepping out into nature, and that left its mark on the people who lived there. The social life was different from what I was used to; it was more raw and much more direct, but also warmer and more inclusive. Maybe because thats all there was  a few clusters of buildings near the sea  and those who lived there were dependent on one another. A decade later I wrote a novel set in that place, and what stayed with me  aside from the odd social reality, in which, after only a few days, I became mercilessly entangled  what settled as a memory in my body was the light.",2013-02-28T15:12:05+0000

us,The Brutal Years,"The question of whether humans are becoming more brutal or more civilized has been debated urgently by the Athenians, the philosophers of the Renaissance, the Victorians and the existentialists. Those who argue that cruelty is currently becoming more acute point to the Rwandan genocide, global warming, and the malicious acts of selfish corporations and corrupt politicians. Contrariwise, others point to a safer and kinder society of greater prosperity and less prejudice against social, religious and ethnic minorities; Steven Pinkers 2011 book, The Better Angels of Our Nature, proposes that we live more peaceably now than ever before. The dichotomous argument has particular resonance in the context of childhood. Teachers no longer routinely hit students; laws require accommodations for young people with learning disabilities; parents keep watch for teachers abuse and vice versa; developmental therapists are around every corner. Yet the Internet has unleashed meanness of a previously unimagined scope and celerity; broken households escalate childrens proclivity to launch unmonitored assaults on weaker kids; ethics are preached neither at home nor at school; and the accessibility of assault rifles enables nearly apocalyptic juvenile excess. Adult bullies from talk radio to Congress get constant airtime, and in many quarters their belligerence is applauded. Still, we are shocked when children behave belligerently toward one another. Youthful aggression has always been a problem and always will be; the pitilessness of childhood, like that of the world, is most likely a constant quantity.",2013-02-28T21:52:41+0000
