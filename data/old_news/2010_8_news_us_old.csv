It has sold a cumulative $193.4 million in North America, making it one of the biggest nonanimated hits of the year. Dinner for Schmucks, a comedy from Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Studios, was a soft second with about $23.3 million. That film, which stars Steve Carell, must now hope to replicate the pattern of Date Night, Mr. Carells last comedy, which opened with a so-so $25 million but managed to take in about $100 million before its run was over. Angelina Jolies Salt (Columbia Pictures) was third with about $19.3 million, for a new domestic total of $70.8 million. Despicable Me, the animated blockbuster from Universal Studios, sold another $15.5 million for fourth place and a new total of $190.3 million.

Francos intellectual pretentions are celebrated and his eccentricities are smiled upon; Sorvinos intellectual ambitions are used against her and her eccentricities mercilessly mocked. Anderson goes out of his way to insist that Francos academic work is legitimate; Corsello makes fun of Sorvino for talking about her honors thesis. Anderson takes a rueful attitude toward the gulf between Francos ambitions and his actual body of work; Corsello has a good time making fun of Romy and Michelles High School Reunion.

The deal, which was approved on July 15, includes the Broad Collection at Grand Avenue and Second Street as the cultural site that will fulfill a large part of Related Companies percent-for-art obligation. If the Grand Avenue Project costs its estimated $3 billion, the 1 percent requirement would generate $30 million for arts and culture, and Mr. Broads museum would receive about a third of that under the plan approved last month.",2010-08-02T20:42:15+0000

us,Oscilloscope Appealing Film Unfinished Rating,"Oscilloscope Laboratories said it planned to appeal an R rating assigned by the Classification and Rating Administration to the Holocaust documentary A Film Unfinished (a scene, above). The documentary, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival this year, dissects a Nazi propaganda film that was shot in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942. In assigning an R rating, which requires viewers under the age of 17 to be accompanied by an adult, the ratings board cited disturbing images of Holocaust atrocities, including graphic nudity. Adam Yauch, an owner of Oscilloscope and its Oscilloscope Pictures operation, said the proposed rating would block use of the film as an educational tool. This is too important of a historical document to ban from classrooms, Mr. Yauch said in a statement on Monday. A Film Unfinished is to open in New York on Aug. 18, and two days later in Los Angeles, before a planned national release.",2010-08-02T20:43:14+0000

us,Return Engagement | Camelot,"In an extreme case of camel coat envy, a frustrated New York socialite who had long fetishized the trench coat Ali MacGraw wore in Love Story engaged a patternmaker last year to copy it in caramel cashmere, down to the patch pockets and double-wide lapel and collar (which, like MacGraws character, Jenny, you gotta wear popped). From Paris to New York, from Kate Moss to Blake Lively (who seem to be as attached to their fawn-colored coats as Grace Kelly and Katharine Hepburn were to theirs), camel is dans lair this fall. Clines Phoebe Philo jump-started the trend last spring with the ultimate boyfriend coat, a honey-toned Crombie. Jean Paul Gaultier  in his penultimate, fall collection for Herms  showed a three-quarter camel coat pinched from the guys, saving his most luxurious discursion for duffel coats like the ones once worn by the British Royal Navy. Michael Kors imagined a gender mix-up at the coat check, or maybe that blushingly erotic moment when a gentleman slips his camel coat over his dates chilly shoulders. If its all beginning to sound like a male conspiracy, well, a lot of womens outerwear in the buff register does lead back to the blokes. Think of the peacoat  and the polo coat. Around 1900, polo players began wrapping themselves in camel wait coats  patterned, essentially, on a dressing gown  to keep warm between chukkers. Later, women borrowed freely of the details: half belt, full cut, chest pocket. In 1949 the camel coat was the American coeds favorite. Kors made winking reference to all that history, pairing a great big muff of a fur skirt with a camel knit tee. Among the other camel offerings were satin blouses and high-waisted slacks (Chlo), even a strapless dress (Gianfranco Ferr). But in the end, it was the camel coat that scored, whether sable-trimmed at Carolina Herrera or sleeveless at Alexander Wang. A real love story. ",2010-08-03T13:41:59+0000

Bands took advantage of the full raw bar with oysters shucked on the spot and scallops on the half shell. Beach House dug the smoothie station, and fried Mars bars were a hit as Arcade Fire was getting ready to play Saturday night.

us,Phys Ed: How Much Does Knee Surgery Really Help?,"A study published late last month in The New England Journal of Medicine is raising provocative questions about how best to treat a torn anterior cruciate ligament. For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)",2010-08-04T04:01:31+0000

And so I was sent to what would prove to be the first of many psychiatrists in the four and a half decades to follow  indeed, I could be said to be a one-person boon to the therapeutic establishment  and was initiated into the curious and slippery business of self-disclosure.

Mr. Taylors defense had argued that prosecutors had not provided a full statement of Ms. Campbells planned testimony. The judges rejected the motion on Wednesday, saying that Ms. Campbell, a hostile witness, had been uncooperative and that prosecutors could not be expected to provide such a statement from her. Ms. Campbell was subpoenaed to testify whether Mr. Taylor had sent her a gift of rough diamonds after they met at a charity dinner in 1997 in South Africa. Prosecutors hope to show that Mr. Taylor lied under oath when he said that he never had any diamonds and did not trade any for weapons to support the bloody rampage by rebels in Sierra Leone during the countrys civil war.

The film, directed by Yael Hersonski, dissects a Nazi propaganda film that purported to depict life among Jews in the Warsaw ghetto during World War II but actually manipulated its portrayal to reinforce anti-Jewish policies. The rating bars those under 17 from seeing the film without an accompanying parent or guardian. Oscilloscope argued that a similar film, The Last Days, on which Steven Spielberg was an executive producer, had been rated PG-13.

Mr. Henley, above, and his fellow musicians Mike Campbell and Danny Kortchmar filed suit against Mr. DeVore, a Republican member of the California State Assembly, and Mr. Hart, saying that parodies of The Boys of Summer (originally written by Mr. Henley and Mr. Campbell) and All She Wants to Do Is Dance (Mr. Kortchmar) that Mr. DeVore used in his campaign ads were made without permission.

Ravis a guy weve been watching for a long time, said Bruce Lundvall, the chairman emeritus of Blue Note. The decision to sign Mr. Coltrane was made last year, he said, in the midst of festivities around the labels 70th anniversary.

A report in March from the Population Reference Bureau showed that more than 70 percent of Americans age 40 and over felt they had been affected by the economic crisis. Government data indicate that the net worth of the average American household has shrunk by about 20 percent  the greatest such decline since the end of World War II. Long-term unemployment  joblessness lasting six months or more  is also at its highest level since the mid-1940s.

Some insinuate themselves because they are comforting and friendly, which is not the case with Last Year at Marienbad, a famously impenetrable monument to the avant-garde directed by Alain Resnais. But the discovery of six reels of behind-the-scenes footage from 1960 forever fractures the movies cool, calculated surface. With a Super-8 camera, Franoise Spira, a young cast member with a bit part, produced what seems like an amateur version of the film itself, her relationship to its protagonist, played by Delphine Seyrig, as intimate as Resnaiss. Spira committed suicide a few years later, and her celluloid diary languished until 2008. The movies second assistant director, Volker Schlndorff, later turned it into the documentary The Making of Last Year at Marienbad, which Diane von Furstenberg toasted at her studio in June after a screening at New York University. Schlndorff was there, as well as Jean-Luc Godards biographer Richard Brody, the photographer Steven Klein, Ahn Duong, Daphne Guinness and the documentarys principal promoter, Bernard-Henri Lvy.

What distinguishes the comic novel is that it takes the spiritual rather than the tragic view of life. It tries to reconcile us to existence as it really is, rather than suggesting that we try to change things or chuck the whole mess. This is why Miguel de Unamuno once remarked that, given the choice between Christ and Don Quixote, the Spanish take sides with the knight of the doleful countenance.

In a 12-to-3 vote, the appeals board of the Classification and Rating Administration, which rates films released in the United States, upheld an earlier R rating that cited the movies disturbing images of Holocaust atrocities including graphic nudity. Directed by Yael Hersonski, A Film Unfinished dissects a Nazi propaganda film that purported to depict life among Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II, but was later discovered to have manipulated situations to help reinforce negative images of Jews. David Fenkel, who with Adam Yauch founded Oscilloscope Laboratories, the movies distributor, said that the rating makes it much harder for libraries to accept it and that some wont. The film is set to open in New York on Aug. 18, and is expected to play later across the United States according to Oscilloscope.

us,Will Ferrell Gets a Boost From The Other Guys," Will Ferrell, right, badly needed a hit  his last outing in theaters was the disastrous Land of the Lost  and he got one over the weekend with The Other Guys, a buddy comedy that took in about $35.6 million at the North American box office. The Other Guys, which cost Columbia Pictures about $90 million to make, was easily No. 1 for the weekend and represented one of the strongest openings of Mr. Ferrells career. It continued a winning streak at Columbia, owned by Sony, which was behind the hit remake of The Karate Kid and also scored with Grown Ups and Salt. In second place for the weekend was Christopher Nolans Inception with about $18.6 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. This Warner Brothers film has shown remarkable holding power over the last month, selling a total of $227.7 million in North America. Step Up 3D, the third in a series from Walt Disney Studios and Summit Entertainment, was a weak third, selling $15.5 million and marking a low point for the franchise, despite having the benefit of premium-price 3-D tickets for the first time. One reason may have been marketing: Step Up 3-D was backed by dark, difficult-to-decipher images that baffled many Hollywood veterans. Salt, the Angelina Jolie spy caper, was fourth with about $11.1 million, for a new domestic total of $92 million. The comedy Dinner for Schmucks, from Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Studios, was fifth with $10.5 million ($46.7 million total.)",2010-08-08T23:34:23+0000

Directed by Thom Zimny, who has made several films about Mr. Springsteen and his band, including the Emmy-nominated Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: Live in New York City, the film chronicles Mr. Springsteens work on Darkness from 1975, after the release of his pivotal album Born to Run, until 1978, a time when he was prohibited from recording any music because of a pending lawsuit with Mike Appel, his former manager. The film mixes footage from rehearsals during that time with recent commentary from Mr. Springsteen and the band. (Above, Mr. Springsteen, right, with Southside Johnny.) The fact that this footage has been sitting in a vault, and no one has seen it for more than 30 years is just extraordinary, Richard L. Plepler, a co-president of HBO, said at a Television Critics Association meeting on Saturday.

Directed by Julie Taymor, the Tony Award-winning creator of the long-running musical The Lion King, Spider-Man appears to have rebounded from a production delay that involved scuttling its original plan to start performances last February. According to executives involved with Spider-Man, the new producers have secured enough financing for the creative team to begin rehearsals next week and commit to performance dates and a box-office schedule. Tickets will go on sale in September; an exclusive presale to American Express cardholders begins on Saturday. People who previously bought tickets will be contacted by Ticketmaster and given priority access for tickets again.",2010-08-10T22:14:17+0000

On Monday a federal judge dismissed a copyright claim brought by a writer who said that a scene in the 2009 film was very similar to his own original script, titled Himbos, Reuters reported. John Musero filed suit against Mr. Baron Cohen, in character above, the director Larry Charles, the producers Mosaic Media Group and MRC and others in March. Mr. Musero had claimed that a scene in which Bruno wrecks havoc at a fashion show because he is stuck in a Velcro suit came from a script that Mr. Musero had pitched to Mosaic, which later rejected it. The court ruled that the idea of a man in a Velcro suit was not subject to copyright and that the two works were not that similar. The protagonist in Himbos is chased by a rabbit and cats after rabbit food gets stuck to the back of his suit. Bruno shows its title character crashing into a rack of clothes and falling onto a runway.",2010-08-10T22:16:08+0000
us,The Drawing Center Will Stay In Soho,"After years of seeking a new downtown home, the Drawing Center has decided to stay put in its SoHo neighborhood. The economy made us re-evaluate what scale of project we want, Brett Littman, the Drawing Centers director, said in an interview on Monday. Were like a nice small jazz club  the scale of what we do is intimate; drawings tend to be pretty small. The center has 2,500 square feet in its main gallery at 35 Wooster Street, which it owns, and about 500 square feet across the street at 40 Wooster Street, where it has a lease that must be renegotiated every two years. Mr. Littman said the center was looking at alternatives to its secondary space and considering ways to better utilize its main gallery with a possible redesign. Until recently, the Drawing Center had been exploring a wholesale move, a search that included ground zero and the South Street Seaport and Pier 18. But now SoHo has become even more of a cultural haven, fueled by an influx of commercial galleries and the opening of the New Museum on the Bowery. There is a kind of understanding that the circumstances have shifted and maybe this is a good moment for the Drawing Center to reinvest in the neighborhood it built its reputation in, Mr. Littman said.",2010-08-10T22:16:43+0000

But he apparently wants a half-hour each week. Mr. Johnston, a bit player in the last presidential election, is pitching a reality television show to several cable channels. Producers are filming in Hollywood this week for the show, which would be called Loving Levi: The Road to the Mayors Office. That would be the mayors office in Wasilla, Alaska, where Sarah Palin got her start. According to the producers, the series would show Mr. Johnston campaigning to be the mayor of Wasilla, even though that job does not come up for election until 2012. Without a channel, though, the show is little more than an idea. Asked why Mr. Johnstons show was publicized even though it lacks a channel, Canaan Rubin, an executive producer, said in an e-mail that a pilot is in preproduction and several networks are interested.

Flesh also suggests the threateningly female, moistness and blood, the hothouse clutches of a heavy-breasted mother  off-putting images for male fashion designers, who are more often than not gay. (Think of Karl Lagerfelds withering disdain on hearing that a German magazine would now be using only regular-size women in its fashion spreads: No one wants to see curvy women. . . .

The too-essentialist critique has been raised by The American Prospects Adam Serwer, among others, who scoffs at my suggestion that theres anything distinctive about heterosexual relationships as heterosexual relationships: Every intimate relationship, he suggests, is distinct in its challenges and potential fruit,' and so theres no reason why heterosexual marriages as a category deserve to be singled out or idealized in any way. The too-complicated critique was raised by Matt Feeney, who writes (well, tweets) that if theres an Ockhams Razor/Parsimony standard for ideals,' then my marriage ideal doesnt meet it, because any marriage ideal strong enough to function qua ideal, as Ross uses the term, would have to be parsimonious enough to allow gay marriage.",2010-08-12T15:45:38+0000

us,Chilled to the Bone,"I had no name, no home in time, thinks Arvid Jansen, the narrator of Per Pettersons slender, subtly incisive new novel, I Curse the River of Time. Its a statement that could apply to most of Pettersons lonely Scandinavian souls. In his books  the best known is probably Out Stealing Horses  Petterson depicts a literal and figurative geography that, to American readers, might feel a little like the starker reaches of the West, a little like the stonier shores of Maine, a little like Edward Hopper, a little like Raymond Carver. His characters are decent, laconic and perpetually, possibly existentially, chilled. They just cant get warm, cant stay warm, no matter how hard they try. At the risk of perpetrating a geographical clich, I have to say that Pettersons world feels Far Northern to the core  windswept, dimly lit, its summers and romances hard-won, deeply felt, reluctantly left behind. Memory, in this unregenerate landscape, is often the only thing these people have to get them through the winter of their discontents. They hoard it, hide it, keep it close at all times. Pettersons narratives tend to unspool in the first person, in hushed, confidential tones. Tight-lipped with one another, his characters open their hearts to the reader, making us witnesses to their most private selves. He makes the reader lean in, out of the wind, to listen closely.",2010-08-13T15:26:20+0000

Born into a family of classically trained Italian painters and sculptors, Canevari came to New York in the 1980s to assist the South Korean experimental video artist Nam June Paik. Since his first New York show in 1989, Canevari has produced politically responsive artworks in a diverse array of mediums: sculptures made of car tires, video installations and photographs. He even dipped a toe into the slightly more frivolous world of fashion after meeting Riccardo Tisci in 2007 to collaborate on a project for AnOther magazine. He gave me a Givenchy haute couture dress and said, Do what you like with it.  I burned it on a wooden cross. As for the clothing he doesnt set aflame, Canevari sticks to vintage. I have a collection of vintage suits and several vintage motorcycle jackets  around 35! Concerning the overall inspiration behind his works, including his 2007 Venice Biennale entry, Bouncing Skull, the artist is very frank. Life and death have been a source of inspiration for centuries for artists, he says. Im not an exception.",2010-08-13T20:23:17+0000

Many writers seem convinced that that assimilation and nativism arent intertwined at all, but rather diametrically opposed. Nativism in the late 19th century was preoccupied with keeping foreigners out of the United States, not assimilating them, Jamelle Bouie writes. The pro-assimilation forces are on the progressive side, in the first camp Douthat mentions, objects Phoebe Maltz, rather than having anything to do with cultural conservatives.

The online-only VIP Art Fair, which will take place for the first time in January, is similarly time-limited (a week long), but different in almost every other way from a normal fair. The booths are virtual; conversation (and haggling over prices) will take place by instant messaging, phone or Skype; and no one will get sore feet. The event is the brainchild of two couples, the art dealers James and Jane Cohan and the Internet entrepreneurs Jonas and Alessandra Almgren. So far several major galleries have signed up, including Gagosian, David Zwirner, White Cube, Hauser & Wirth and L&M Arts. The cost to galleries in the most elite category is $20,000, which Mr. Cohan said the founders estimated to be about a fifth the cost of doing a conventional art fair (including booth, transportation, hotels and shipping). Asked whether people would be willing to spend money on art they hadnt seen in person, Mr. Cohan said that buyers most likely would be people already familiar with a given artists work. The fair will take place Jan. 22 to 30. Anyone can browse, but to interact with dealers, you will have to be invited by one of the exhibiting galleries or pay a fee of $20 or $100.",2010-08-17T22:19:18+0000

As Kaspar Monrad, the museums curator and director, told Agence France-Presse, the works will include paintings of Brazil, like the one above, containing scenes from daily life in the cities, the slums and the countryside in Brazil where Bob Dylan has been several times. The exhibition, which will run at the museum (known locally as the Statens Museum for Kunst) from Sept. 4 through Jan. 30, was announced last year. The museum said on Monday that it would include 40 acrylic paintings and 8 drawings created by Mr. Dylan specifically for the show. Mr. Monrad said the paintings, whose subjects also include a familiarly Dylan-esque array of gypsies, gangsters and politicians, were inspired by American realism from the start of the 20th century and a deep affinity with painters like Matisse. In a statement Mr. Dylan simply said, It was an honor to be asked and a thrilling challenge to create the works.",2010-08-17T22:19:42+0000

The East Village master of decoupage plates, trays, lamps and other decorative items has followed his 2008 effort for the design-centric retailer with a bigger, more varied collection that includes stationery, home dcor, housewares and storage  all at Ill-take-10-of-those prices. Signature designs run through the collection: for example, a silhouette that adorns the cover of a composition book ($2.50) also appears on a ceramic mug ($4.99). Storage bins covered in geranium-leaf or moth prints are too pretty to hide in a closet, and there are plastic trays for every possible use. My favorites among the latter are the Tapered Tray ($19.99, shown here in pale geranium), which is large enough to carry drinks outside, or to stack books or magazines. A smaller tray ($12.99) is perfect for organizing jars of cotton swabs and makeup brushes in the bathroom or for putting your keys on near the front door. Its image of a pink room (called House-Mouse in the collection), taken from a late-19th-century German print, is one of Derians favorites. Its so conceptual, he said, as if youre putting your things down in a room. And the oval tray ($12.99), with its Home Sweet Home motto (based on a print that Derian found when he bought an old frame), would look great hanging on a wall, with its old-fashioned, almost camp sensibility. Derian particularly likes the way that these pieces work in modern as well as more traditional rooms. They all cross over, which is cool, he added. The collection will be available beginning Sept. 5, but as always with Targets designer collaborations, supplies are limited.",2010-08-18T13:00:05+0000

But he said that in the meantime, BP was preparing to replace the damaged blowout preventer on the Macondo well with a new one, which could be used to help manage pressure within the well. BP has estimated that there are about 1,000 barrels of oil in the Macondo well, trapped between seals at the top and cement at the bottom that was pumped in this month. One concern is that using the relief well to pump more cement into the Macondo well could raise the pressure within that well, damage the seals and, potentially, result in a spill of the oil.

It was in the 1800s, though, that anxiety over usage really started to mount, with hundreds of grammars and polemics finding their way to print: 1829 saw The Vulgarities of Speech Corrected: With Elegant Expressions for Provincial and Vulgar English, Scots, and Irish; for the Use of Those Who are Unacquainted With Grammar; in 1841 there was Decline of the English Language: The Cause and Probable Consequences; and A Plea for the Queens English came out in 1863.

Sam Tanenhaus, who calls the new novel a masterpiece of American fiction on our Aug. 29 cover, recently wrote in a blog post, Franzen is attuned to the differences between the Eastern Seaboards voluptuary pleasures and indulgences, and the midlands homelier values. Meanwhile, Sam Anderson of New York magazine, in his rave, scored the Midwestern literary metaphor of the year, saying that some of Franzens sentences are so well written you want to pluck them out, stab them with little corn holders and eat them.",2010-08-20T15:18:15+0000

Our cover star, Freida Pinto, of Slumdog fame, a rare beauty with a candor to match, throws a few curve balls at Horacio Silva  and a glass of wine at the photographer Ryan McGinley. Linda Yablonsky encounters the artist Nathalie Djurberg, whose twisted, animated feats of clay celebrate bodies emaciated, voluptuous and obese; Christopher Petkanas delves into Maxime de la Falaises smoldering unpublished memoirs and discovers a true lady Libertine; and Holly Brubach rediscovers the work of Caroline Blackwood, a brilliant writer whose talents are often eclipsed by her status as muse to Lucian Freud. Elsewhere, Daphne Merkin wonders if a couple of bosomy looks on the Louis Vuitton runway can conquer our much larger social fear of flesh (probably not); Ford Models revs up its engines with a more diverse lineup of faces and bodies; and the actress Laetitia Casta fills Brigitte Bardots shoes  and everything else.

Notably, Betty White was named best guest actress in a comedy for her appearance on Saturday Night Live. The Tony Awards telecast in June 2009, hosted by Neil Patrick Harris, was the winner in the special class category.

Dorothy Jane Mills, below, the widow of the revered baseball historian Harold Seymour, has been belatedly recognized by Oxford University Press as co-author, along with Mr. Seymour, of three landmark scholarly works on the history of baseball, Publishers Weekly reported. Tim Bent, Oxfords executive editor, said that Ms. Mills, 81, formerly Dorothy Z. Seymour, would be given formal credit and that her name would now accompany her late husbands on the covers and title pages of Baseball: The Early Years (1960); Baseball: The Golden Age, (1971); and Baseball: The Peoples Game (1991). Mr. Bent said that to his knowledge, Oxford had never before changed the authorship of a major scholarly work. In an interview with The New York Times in March, when she was recognized for the first time along with Mr. Seymour by the Society for American Baseball Research, Ms. Mills said that she had served as the primary researcher and essentially a co-author of all three books but that her husband had steadfastly refused her request that her work be credited. All these things were done jointly, she said. He just couldnt share credit. And I didnt say anything at the time, because at the time, wives just didnt do that. He died in 1992, and in her 2004 autobiography, A Womans Work, she described her extensive role in the creation of the books. Ms. Mills, who is now at work on a historical novel about baseball, said that even after all these years, she still does not consider herself a fan: You write a lot more objectively about a subject youre not in love with.",2010-08-22T22:32:14+0000

The Expendables (Lions Gate), with Sylvester Stallone leading an ensemble cast, was No. 1 with about $16.5 million, bringing the cumulative total to about $65 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticketing data. Vampires Suck (20th Century Fox), a low-budget spoof of the Twilight movies, was second with about $12.2 million for a five-day total of $18.6 million. Vampires Suck, which opened on Wednesday, appeared to narrowly beat Julia Roberts as her Eat Pray Love (Sony Pictures Entertainment) took third place with $12 million, earning a total of $47.1 million in North America since it opened on Aug. 13, a soft result that has renewed worries that Ms. Roberts has faded as a box-office draw. The comedy Lottery Ticket, from Alcon Entertainment and Warner Brothers, opened in fourth place with about $11.1 million. Fifth place appeared to be a tie, with each earning about $10.1 million: The Other Guys (Sony), with a new total of $88.2 million, and Piranha 3-D, a new horror romp from the Weinstein Company. Two other new movies fared poorly despite wide releases: Nanny McPhee Returns (Universal Pictures), already a hit overseas, earned $8.3 million.

The culture minister, Farouk Hosni, announced shortly after the disappearance of the painting was made public that it had been recovered at the Cairo airport and that two Italians had been arrested in connection with theft. But Mr. Hosni said later that he had been given bad information and that the search continued.

us,Imam Rauf and Moderate Islam,"To some extent, the controversy surrounding the Cordoba Initiatives Lower Manhattan venture is really a controversy about how non-Muslim Westerners should relate to the would-be spokesmen for a moderate (or moderate, depending on your point of view) Islam. One school of thought, prominent among conservatives but associated with liberal thinkers like Paul Berman as well, holds that anything short of an absolute commitment to Enlightenment values is unacceptable from such figures, and that moderate Muslims must demonstrate this commitment, and prove their secular bona fides, by making a frontal assault on Islamic culture as it currently exists. To this school, explicitly-liberal figures like Ayaan Hirsi Ali or Irshad Manji represent the beau ideal of moderate Islam, because theyre forthright in their critiques of Muslim societies failings, and unstinting in their insistence that the Western way of faith and politics is ultimately superior. A high-profile bridge-builder like the ubiquitous Tariq Ramadan, on the other hand, is much more suspect, and possibly beyond the pale because he tends to use different language and strike different notes depending on his audience, because he often seems to be making excuses for illiberalism in the Islamic world, because hes less-than-forthright in his condemnations of certain kinds of extremism, and so on down the line. To his critics, such bobbing and weaving is proof enough that his moderate Islam project is really just a flowery fraud and a Trojan Horse for Wahhabism, with no redeeming value whatsoever. And this critique is easily extended to many other self-described moderates as well  including, lately, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who arguably has a stronger claim to moderation than Ramadan, but who seems to share some of his more evasive qualities when the conversation turns to, say, Hamas or the Islamic Republic of Iran.",2010-08-25T23:34:00+0000

In addition, the M.T.A. will forgive $59,000 to settle claims related to 3-Legged Dogs construction costs in the building.

Under the act, small business establishments can play audio music from radio, television, cable or satellite sources without having to pay any licensing fee, provided that certain guidelines are met. This exemption is called the home-style exemption. Generally, to qualify for the home-style exemption, the business must use a consumer-style receiver and cannot transmit the music beyond its establishment or charge admission for listening to the music.",2010-08-26T17:19:58+0000

I come from a developing country, where technology has more connotations than connectivity, and have found that it is important to be in the stream of people, if only virtually, before one can dwell on know thyself. In cities like Mumbai or remote villages in India with their sprawling inequality and islands of poverty, Twitter and other social-networking sites, for all their drawbacks with regards to privacy, intimacy and introspection, have provided a platform of equal sharing and have been silently revolutionary from the bottom up. Social-networking sites have gone a step ahead in expanding the notion of the self and democratizing the essence of the social consciousness. No doubt ruminations of the self and the complete attention to the joy of the moment are lifes DNA of emotional existence, but the Internet and social-networking sites can be a ladder in reaching that level of awareness for the entirety of humanity.",2010-08-26T17:22:11+0000

Most fortuitously, he was apparently a graphomaniac who documented his long, dark, exuberant, sad, dangerous life in journals, an unpublished memoir, reams of letters, poems, erotica, semifictionalized short stories and even a 746-entry card catalog of his sexual history, scrupulously maintained over five decades and in some cases ornamented  perhaps for future biographers?  with what Spring decorously calls DNA-verifiable evidence of his liaisons.",2010-08-26T19:35:46+0000

Bella Abzug, long before she became a congresswoman, served as McGees defense lawyer during the appeals process, working on a case that today evokes the story line of Harper Lees To Kill a Mockingbird. Albert Einstein, Norman Mailer and Paul Robeson supported McGee, and left-wing journalists ranted about the trial in The Daily Worker.

Human Sexual Response, published in 1966, attempted to analyze sex scientifically, and it debunked many myths (while introducing a few new ones). This biography explores the complicated and not especially happy lives of Masters and Johnson, for whom sex was part of the job description and love was elusive. THE EAST, THE WEST, AND SEX: A History, by Richard Bernstein. (Vintage, $16.) Bernstein searches for evidence that the vision of a sexualized East we know as Orientalism exists in reality in this accessible, much-researched and far-reaching book, as our reviewer, Toni Bentley, described it. Along the way he examines Marco Polos report on imperial concubines in the 14th century and the writings of Gustave Flaubert and Sir Richard Burton.

Indeed, for much of its span between New York and Boston, the Post Road is, in Eric Jaffes apt phrase, a gluttonous commercial wild. But in his valuable if uneven history, The Kings Best Highway, Jaffe burrows under the asphalt to reveal a thoroughfare of deeper distinction. Starting with its pastoral founding by American colonists, who exploited rocky, slippery paths that Indians had burned out of the wilderness, he tells how the road became the artery for an inchoate mail service, with loping riders carrying wax-sealed letters from tavern to tavern  the first post offices  and distributing newspapers that united the scattered colonists to revolt against the British. He traces the changes brought on by stagecoach, trolley, bicycle, reminding us that robust railroads led to the neglect of highways, until the automobile enabled the highways revenge.

ORourke wrote in his 1986 essay Among the Euro-Weenies that the French are a smallish, monkey-looking bunch and not dressed any better, on average, than the citizens of Baltimore. Jokes at the expense of many nations are dicey, and Europe has a small safety zone that includes the Austrians and the French. Credit goes to David Sedaris for wringing the last possible shred of humor out of the American-in-Paris tale 10 years ago, in Me Talk Pretty One Day. At that point, travel writers probably should have banded together in one of those self-regulating industry associations aimed at defusing public hostility and declared a moratorium on wisecracks about Old Europe.

us,Her Darkest Places,"Near the end of Shirley Jacksons most famous novel, The Haunting of Hill House, the heroine, a lonely young woman named Eleanor, thinks to herself, What I want in all this world is peace, a quiet spot to lie and think, a quiet spot up among the flowers where I can dream and tell myself sweet stories. And Eleanor does dream, but the stories, for her as for her creator, are rarely sweet. The very welcome Library of America edition of Jacksons work, edited by Joyce Carol Oates, contains, in addition to Hill House, 46 of her short stories, another novel  her last, We Have Always Lived in the Castle  and an essay on the furious reactions to the magazine publication of her peerlessly disturbing 1948 tale The Lottery. Although few of the narratives collected here are as terrifying as Hill House or as shocking as The Lottery (which is about an exceptionally nasty small-town ritual), theres precious little comfort in any of them. Theyre quiet, usually, told in calm, precise, scrupulously unsensational prose, but peace of the kind for which poor Eleanor yearns is always elusive. Theres none apparent in the wide world  Jackson wrote at the height of the cold war, when anxiety was general, even fashionable. The first story in the book, The Intoxicated, is about a 17-year-old girl who sobers up an inebriated partygoer with a coolly imagined vision of the end of civilization: Maybe therell be a law, she speculates, not to live in houses, so then no one can hide from anyone else, you see.

When Gehry was playing around with the material, he broke a piece, which looked to him like a fish scale  and the rest is design history, with the fish swimming into the collections of art world notables like Jasper Johns. On Sunday, Fish Forms: Lamps by Frank Gehry opens at the Jewish Museum. Organized by Ruth Beesch, the museums deputy director for program, the exhibition, which includes just eight lamps, was inspired by the glass fish lamp in the museums own collection. The lamps themselves are engaging objects, the gentle glow of the light within them contrasting with their substantial, expressionist bases. But they were never designed just for the sake of making something. The fish form was something that had fascinated Gehry for its purity and its dynamism and was well on its way to becoming a major theme in his architecture, a point that is made quite well in a video that accompanies the exhibition, which runs through Oct. 31.",2010-08-27T15:59:26+0000

For Daydreaming With James Lavelle, Lavelle, the founder of the MoWax record label and the trip-hop collaborative UNKLE, used his personal street-art collection as a starting point, including works by the graffiti legends Futura, Bst and Faile, and added music-inspired conceptual art by James Shovlin, art-inspired fashion by the London label Boudiccas and new works made in response to Lavelles own compositions to the mix.",2010-08-27T19:34:50+0000

The October screening had been arranged by Arnold Peter, an alumnus who is a lawyer for Rick Norsigian, the man who bought the negatives, one of which is above, at a garage sale 10 years ago. Mr. Peter, who is the executive producer of the film, told the university last week that he no longer wanted to show it there. He said in a statement to The Bay Citizen on Friday that the screening no longer made sense because Adamss grandson and the managing director of the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust, who dispute that the 65 negatives are the work of Adams, had not agreed to take part in a discussion at the screening. The trust has filed a lawsuit to block the marketing of the negatives as Adamss works. Experts working with Mr. Norsigian say they feel sure that Adams created the negatives. But the finding has been challenged by several parties, including the Center for Creative Photography, which Adams co-founded and which had been neutral in the debate. We have no reason to believe that these negatives are, in fact, the work of Ansel Adams, and we support the efforts of the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust to protect its rights in this matter, the center said in a statement on Friday.",2010-08-27T21:51:28+0000

The official title that Mr. Nunn will hold, however, is the Cameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theater, a post endowed by a fund named for that producer of theatrical hits like Phantom of the Opera and Les Misrables, among others. Students of theater (and of good ol slapfests) may recall that Mr. Nunn said earlier this summer that he felt betrayed by Mr. Mackintosh, who hired new directors for a 25th-anniversary Les Misrables revival being staged at the Barbican this fall; Mr. Mackintosh responded that he was saddened by Nunns inaccurate and ungracious remarks. But in his acceptance of the Oxford position Mr. Nunn was gracious, writing in a statement: Having been invited to fulfill this role on two previous occasions, I am so pleased that this time the dates have worked out.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police of London told The Daily Telegraph that visitors had reported a funny smell on the premises and had mild irritation to the throat and eyes. A museum spokeswoman told the BBC that firefighters had come to the scene and searched the building but could not find anything. A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade told the BBC that the museum had been checked for four hours but that nothing had been detected. He added, People may well have smelled something, but it dispersed before we got there. No injuries were reported, and the museum reopened on Sunday.",2010-08-30T21:26:56+0000
us,Emmy Ratings Stable,"The Primetime Emmys on Sunday, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, drew almost exactly as many viewers as last years awards telecast, which was hosted by Neil Patrick Harris, preliminary Nielsen ratings indicated Monday morning. In the ever-more-fragmented world of television, thats a victory for NBC, which carried the show. About 13.5 million viewers tuned in, according to the data, up about 32,000 viewers from last years telecast. Those extra tens of thousands are enough to make Mr. Fallons Emmys the top-scoring Emmy Awards in total viewers in four years, NBC said  if the preliminary numbers hold, that is. The awards sank to an all-time low, 12.2 million viewers, in 2008. Among viewers ages 18 to 49, the telecast was down just one-tenth of a ratings point, to 4.1 from 4.2 last year, according to the early data. Because the Emmys were held in August this year, there was less formidable competition on other networks.",2010-08-30T21:27:28+0000
us,"The Met Goes to Egypt, in High Definition","The Metropolitan Operas high-definition cinema broadcast series is about to make another foray into the Middle East. The Met recently reached an agreement with the authorities at the Cairo Opera House to show productions there this season. The company announced the deal on Monday. Now in their fifth year, the live broadcasts will increase to 12 productions from 9 and reach 46 countries, including Spain and Portugal for the first time. The number of theaters showing the operas will rise to 1,500 from 1,200, the Met said. For a season, the program included Dubai, which stopped after the economic crisis hit, a Met spokesman said. Peter Gelb, the Mets general manager, said he was negotiating with theaters in Israel to show the operas. A shortage of digital theaters that can receive the broadcasts has kept them out of Spain and Portugal until now, he said, and for the same reason the Met has been unable to find a foothold in Italy, the birthplace of opera. An Egyptian-born businessman, Mahmoud M. Abdallah, who sits on the Mets board, helped broker the agreement with the National Cultural Center, which is the umbrella organization for activities at the Cairo Opera House, Mr. Gelb said. The broadcasts will be shown in a theater at the complex that seats about 350 people. The HD season begins on Oct. 9 with Wagners Rheingold, the first installment of the companys new Ring cycle, directed by Robert Lepage.",2010-08-30T21:27:31+0000

And thats what representatives of the O.E.D. did in a statement released on Monday after remarks by the chief executive of Oxford University Press were interpreted to mean that the venerable reference work would not be released in a paper format for its coming third edition.

When he was asked if the new edition of the O.E.D. would appear in print, Mr. Portwood replied, I dont think so.

But he added, I dont believe negotiations have gone well. There are difficulties, he said, over accessibility, because Mr. John would essentially be committing four months of his life to the Fox singing competition. Mr. Tyler and Ms. Lopez are said to be the leading candidates to replace Simon Cowell and Ellen DeGeneres. Asked on Sunday who the ""Idol"" judges would be, Mr. Lythgoe named only Randy Jackson.

The biennale committees decision to ask the Japanese architect (and this years Pritzker Prize winner) Kazuyo Sejima of SANAA to be the director of its 12th installment certainly was an interesting one.

Even the mention of people in the title of the exhibition, People Meet in Architecture, is a first in the history of the architecture biennale. Of the exhibition, Sejima said in her own few words that it will have multiple viewpoints rather than a single orientation.
