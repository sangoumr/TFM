Lean and easily engaged, Mr. Longstreth, 30, the groups singer-songwriter and guitarist, is a critical darling and musical overachiever who has collaborated with the likes of Bjrk and David Byrne. Especially after Bitte Orca, their 2009 breakthrough album, Dirty Projectors became synonymous with complicated, conceptual indie rock. But Swing Lo Magellan took a different tack. These are songs without any context, Mr. Longstreth said. Theyre less about arrangement. Theyre less about orchestration. And they were made with a slightly different lineup from the bands previous albums: Mr. Longstreth wrote with the singer Amber Coffman; another regular vocalist, Angel Deradoorian, was on hiatus. I think change and flux is a bit in the DNA of the band, he said.",2012-07-02T12:00:02+0000

Jules Evans, however, thinks he sees change on the horizon. In an article at the Financial Times, Evans, a journalist and amateur philosopher who heads the 2,000 member-strong London Philosophy Club, describes an emerging scene in which people from a diverse range of backgrounds gather at cafs, pubs and pizza parlors to tackle the great philosophical questions. He also traces the historical ebb and flow of public philosophizing, from the Greeks through the Enlightenment, concluding that such clubs flourish during periods of economic and moral crisis. Professional philosophers are of course still welcome, and indeed, because Evans sees a huge popular demand for academics to share their expertise, are encouraged to participate. Ending with cautious optimism, Evans adds that to ensure that these kinds of gatherings are more than a fashionable trend, they will have to find the shared ethical commitments that are necessary to create genuine communities.",2012-07-03T21:30:41+0000

Mr. Arafat, left, fell ill in October 2004 and died at a hospital in France on Nov. 11 of unannounced causes. He was 75.

Research involving intentional exposure to infectious pathogens had been done before, and still occurs today, but with ethical safeguards that were not in place in Guatemala. What happened there was wrong because of the lack of individual consent, the subjects vulnerability and the degrading nature of some research methods; in addition, the science was shoddy and the record-keeping so poor that it is hard to know how many Guatemalans were exposed to infection, successfully infected or adequately treated, let alone precisely who the subjects were.

Mary Helen Bowers, a former dancer for the New York City Ballet and founder of the ballet-inspired isolated-muscle fitness regimen, was busy performing inner-thigh reps alongside her laptop. As I made small talk (I was early for class), I noticed that she was politely juggling my chitchat with someone on the other end of the computer screen. Soon after, a classmate warned Bowers that she would be away the following week but would tune in to her workout from her hotel room. The idea, explains Bowers, who almost always leads the class, was born out of necessity. I had the opportunity to train with Natalie Portman for Black Swan, and the program we created was intense and involved a lot of travel. So to stay in touch with my New York clients during that period, my solution was to work them out online. Like Portman, who is still a Ballet Beautiful regular, other celebrities have begun to prefer the privacy of exercising remotely. Rumor has it that Lady Gaga does her Soul Cycle spin sessions on the road via recorded classes. (Soul Cycle will have streaming content in the next six to eight months.) Its a new experience in fitness, points out Bowers, who charges $35 per broadcasted class or $280 per month for unlimited access.

After all, what seductress would want to be seen picking tobacco flecks off her tongue? In the early 1950s, when scientific reports showed just how dangerous smoking could be, tobacco companies scrambled to add mouthpieces to most cigarettes, hiring labs at Dow and DuPont to design them. In 1952, the Kent Micronite came equipped with a filter that sucked particles out of the smoke  Heres proof you can see. . . . Kent gives greater protection than any other cigarette, the ad read. But the Micronite contained asbestos fibers that were far more dangerous than tobacco smoke.

Stiglitz makes the case that the growing gulf between haves and have-nots is a drag on the economy and a drain on society. Meanwhile, in Unintended Consequences (at No. 12), the former Bain Capital managing director Edward Conard says inequality is healthy and America could use more of it. This is a political dispute as much as an economic one, of course: Conard is close to his old Bain colleague Mitt Romney, and Stiglitz was chairman of President Clintons Council of Economic Advisers from 1995 to 1997.

The priests, who have been removed from ministry and may ultimately be laicized, are among 26 who were placed on administrative leave after a 2011 grand jury report found that several dozen priests accused of abuse were still in active ministry. Five other priests have been found unsuitable for ministry, and 12 others are still under investigation. On June 22, Msgr. William J.

The logic of both is obvious enough, but since beauty counters and boudoir boutiques offer so many expensive options, figuring out what works and  most important  whats worth it can quickly become an illogically pricey endeavor. Stella McCartney is now solving one of these dilemmas with a new line of everyday lingerie called Stella. Well-made lingerie is key, says the designer, whose frilly, pretty main lines underthings already have an adoring audience.

Holt is concerned, naturally enough, to address the question of the books title, but in an idiosyncratic and personal way (Its subtitled An Existential Detective Story).

Among them are the physicists Roger Penrose and Steven Weinberg, the novelist John Updike, the theologian Richard Swinburne and the philosopher John Leslie. Along the way, Holt suggests that cosmology is still conceptually stuck in its religious past, where the existence of the world is just assumed to require an explanation: When we ask why there is something rather than nothing at all, we are, wittingly or not, heirs to a way of thinking that is a vestige of early Judeo-Christianity. Also interesting is how the concepts of goodness and perfection end up figuring in Holts metaphysical inquiry: one critical modern source for this injection of normativity, says Holt, is Leibniz and his notion of our living, necessarily, in the best of all possible worlds.",2012-07-10T22:43:49+0000

Mr. Gersten, who turned 89 in January, is one of the last titans of the 1970s and 80s, when nonprofit theaters emerged as artistic and financial rivals to commercial Broadway. Acclaimed hits like A Chorus Line opened at the Public Theater in 1975 and then ran on Broadway for 15 years. Mr. Gersten helped create Lincoln Center Theater in 1985 after a revolving door of companies had struggled for two decades to mount shows at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on the Lincoln Center campus. Before moving uptown Mr. Gersten helped to run the Public in the East Village from 1954 until 1978. I stayed as long as Lincoln Center Theater would have me, and I would have stayed longer, but the timing is appropriate, Mr. Gersten said. He is among the highest paid executives in American nonprofit theater; in 2010, according to the latest available tax records, he was paid $506,417, and he will receive a payout of $450,000 in deferred compensation upon leaving. Lincoln Center Theater will not appoint a successor to Mr. Gersten; his duties will be shared among executives including Andr Bishop, the artistic director, and Adam Siegel, the managing director.",2012-07-10T23:07:42+0000

The groups claim that the Interior Department failed to adequately assess the risks of an oil spill in the fragile Arctic ecosystem when it approved Shells response plans this year.

The board voted unanimously to accept the findings and recommendations of its investigators, which include revising the federal pipeline safety agencys rules on identifying and fixing cracks, conducting a comprehensive inspection of Enbridges pipeline management program and requiring operators to train first responders in best practices for responding to spills.

The condition of the man was unclear. Free Tibet said he was Tsewang Dorjee, 22, a nomad. Radio Free Asia, citing a person from Lhasa, said the self-immolation took place in an area that Tibetans call Damshung, and the Chinese call Dangxiong. The Chinese government has denounced the self-immolations as the work of separatists. In May, two men self-immolated in Lhasa in front of the Jokhang, the holiest temple of Tibetan Buddhism. The Chinese government generally does not allow foreigners, including foreign journalists, to travel independently to Lhasa or other parts of central Tibet.

us,This Is London,"In Capital, a modern offshoot of juicy social satires like Trollopes novel The Way We Live Now, John Lanchester puts two of his characters in a compartment of the London Eye, the Ferris wheel that went up on the south bank of the Thames to celebrate the millennium. Its the spring of 2008, a sunny day for once, and a Polish builder named Zbigniew and a Hungarian nanny named Matya are on a date. Though Britain is reeling from the double whammy of global economic woes and terrorism jitters, Zbigniew and Matya take in their birds-eye view with no special feeling of unease, apart from a twinge of motion sickness. On terra firma, both work for wealthy homeowners on a gentrified street called Pepys Road in the up-and-coming South London neighborhood of Clapham. At the beginning of the 21st century, before the bursting of the real estate bubble, property values on Pepys Road had soared  even for the modest end house, owned by a Muslim family, that holds a corner shop, and even for the crumbling terraced house owned by an elderly grandmother, which hasnt had a change of linoleum, wallpaper or electrical wiring in 50 years. Owning property there, Lanchester writes, was like being in a casino in which you were guaranteed to be a winner. Lately, though, all is not well on Pepys Road. The high rollers holiday bonuses arent secure, cash in hand is getting scarce, and ominous postcards have been arriving in every mail slot, reading: We Want What You Have. If that werent alarming enough, a young man in a hoodie has been seen lurking in the dawn hours. We all know what that means.",2012-07-12T20:37:30+0000
us,A Friend of the Family,"It takes a while for the reader to get the proper hang of Frances Thorpe, the narrator and protagonist of Harriet Lanes debut novel, Alys, Always, because we meet her at a moment when a crisis has brought out the best in her. Driving home to London one Sunday evening after a visit with her parents in the suburbs, Frances happens upon a car that has flipped onto its side. She pulls over, approaches cautiously and hears from inside the car a womans voice  not screaming or moaning, but a sort of muttering, in a low, conversational tone. The windshield is shattered in such a way as to have turned opaque, and the injured driver cannot be seen; Frances image of her is formed entirely by her expensive, cultured voice, and by a kind of upper-class conversational refinement that even an apparent head injury cannot undermine. Frances, while neither a doctor nor a paramedic  she is just a subeditor, which is to say copy editor, in the beleaguered books section of a downsizing London newspaper called The Questioner  does unflinchingly what little she can: first she phones for an ambulance, and then she stays beside the car and talks soothingly with the trapped woman, whose name is Alice, until Alices frightened yet still genteel voice turns unintelligible.

Witnesses quoted by the Tibetan government in exile said he shouted slogans before he collapsed. It was the 44th self-immolation since the suicidal protests began in 2009. In March, two monks from the same monastery died after setting themselves on fire. The Chinese news media did not immediately report Tuesdays death, but in the past it has portrayed the spate of self-immolations as acts of terrorism orchestrated by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.

Available in two washes  a dark vintage and a lighter shade with a green cast  the one-year-old style was originally inspired by a pair worn by Norma Jeane Baker in photographs taken by Andr de Dienes in the 1940s. Just like those jeans, the Jenny has a straight side seam, a high waist and a cuff (thats easy to undo, as shown here). Back then women were buying mens jeans and rolling them up, Goldschmied explains. I was in some way a little bit tired of the skinny that was born in L.A. and thats been very successful. I was looking for whats next. My way of designing is about starting from something thats part of a tradition and not just replicating it but innovating through fabric, fit and wash. Its a lot like what J. Crew does with American classics like striped tees and khakis: it twists and turns them through styling into more forward-thinking fashion. J.

All this is richly ironic in view of the fact that the founder of the Boy Scouts, Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell (raised to the peerage as Lord Baden-Powell) was in probability a gay man himself  though closeted, of course, considering the circumstances. A Victorian military hero who skyrocketed to fame after his valiant defense of the besieged city of Mafeking during the Second Boer War, Baden-Powell was one of the British Empires most adulated soldiers, looked to as the very model of muscular Christianity. Baden-Powell, the author of the hugely popular and influential Scouting for Boys (1908), inspired a national cult of manliness even as he entertained serious worry about his own sexuality.",2012-07-20T01:33:46+0000

Members had hoped to move in for the holy month of Ramadan as it began this week. But the mosques opening will be delayed until it passes a building inspection and gets its occupancy permit. For two years, construction of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboros 12,000-square-foot mosque has been a heated issue in the central Tennessee city. In May, a judge voided the approval for construction of the mosque, saying the Rutherford County Planning Commission did not adequately inform the public of a meeting when it approved the plan for the mosque. On Wednesday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order allowing the congregation to begin using the mosque pending an inspection. It is unfortunate that we cannot be in our building for the start of Ramadan tonight, the mosques leaders said in a written statement. However, it does look like we will get to enjoy most of Ramadan in our building, especially the breaking of the fast at the end of Ramadan, on Eid-ul-Fitr. ",2012-07-20T05:05:26+0000

They are centrists, not ideologues like the neoconservative Republicans who preceded them. Strikingly, however, they do not cling religiously to the middle ground come what may.

Rice, American ambassador to the United Nations, to press the international organization to take the lead in responding to cholera in Haiti given the strong suspicions that its troops imported the disease. As cholera was brought to Haiti due to the actions of the U.N., we believe that it is imperative for the U.N. to now act decisively to control the cholera epidemic, said the letter from John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, and the other representatives. Since mid-April, cholera has killed an additional 400 Haitians and sickened 50,000 more, according to Haitian government statistics. This brings the official death toll to 7,442 and the caseload to 580,947 since the first cases were detected in October 2010. The letter calls for the United Nations to push harder to find financing for water and sanitation systems to control the epidemic. ",2012-07-21T05:20:31+0000

In 1991 he traveled to North Korea to meet its leader, Kim Il-sung, after which he became a vocal opponent of the North.

And its a testament to how rarely one sees that political tilt in American cinema, I suspect, that the mere existence of conservative themes in a major summer movie has inspired extraordinary overreactions from ideologically-inclined movie writers.

Its rust-resistant properties make it especially suitable outdoors. One tip: Apply it in one direction, fairly quickly, said Carl Minchew, director of product development for Benjamin Moore, noting that the hammered-metallic effect sets in very fast, and back-brushing can diminish that effect.

Mr. Serry also said that during a visit this month to Gaza, which is run by the anti-Israeli militant group Hamas, he was struck by the fragility and unsustainability of the present situation. His assessment, part of a broader appraisal that held out little hope for renewed Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations, coincided with the release of a World Bank report that said the Palestinian Authority was facing the worst financial crisis since its founding in 1994 and was not ready to support statehood, partly because of an over-reliance on foreign aid. It is critical for the Palestinian Authority to increase trade and spur private sector growth, the report said. It also said Israeli security restrictions on the Palestinian territories continue to stymie investment. ",2012-07-26T00:04:43+0000

The announcement added to economic pressures confronting Iranians because of the sanctions, which have contributed to steep inflation and caused shortages of foreign goods. The price of chicken, a staple of the Iranian diet, has surged in the past few months, partly because of difficulties in securing imported feed. The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Shahbaz Hasanpur, a member of Parliaments Planning and Budget Committee, as saying new measures would stabilize the price of chicken and other basic goods in coming days.

Indeed, though cheerful and pretty, the pieces also hit an athletic note with a price point that will please a young shoppers budget. Bras and underwear start at $68 and $48; chemises and camisoles go for $128 and $98, respectively.As one of Anthropologies monthly collaborations with independent designers, the collection will be available online for under 10 weeks after its July 30 unveiling.Its based in the roots ofVPL,which lie in the desire to bridge the gap between inner and outerwear, Bartlett says.
