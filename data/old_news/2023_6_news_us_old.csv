He furnished Le Rhodia with a mix of midcentury flea market finds and custom pieces commissioned from French artisans in materials ranging from travertine to oak, while preserving a few original details like a wood-burning stove and a large oculus window (designed by Dufet in the spirit of the ocean liner cabin dcor for which he was best known). Museumgoers can also dine outside on the mezzanine terrace next to a colonnade of watchful bronze busts. The menu offers refreshing fare, with culinary references to Bourdelles hometown in the southwest of France and a Latin American influence  a homage, says the French chef Jean-Ren Chassignol, to the dozens of students from Peru, Chile and Argentina who apprenticed with Bourdelle in these ateliers. Dishes, which skew on the lighter side, include a black-bean pure with pickled beets and corn nuts, and seasonal vegetable empanadas.

There, you cant be taken by surprise, but nor can you hide; any feeling of liberation tends to be constrained by a barb of danger; and while you may be granted a glimpse of the infinite, youre also made to feel hyper-aware of your own body. For Noreen Masud, a lecturer in 20th-century literature at the University of Bristol, its as though the landscape is sending us a message that were unable to decipher. In A Flat Place, she travels to five landscapes in England and Scotland in an effort to interpret them: the Cambridgeshire fens, the shingle promontory of Orford Ness, the tidal flats of Morecambe Bay, the Town Moor in Newcastle and the islands of Orkney. She also seeks to interpret their appeal, for while this is a kind of quest narrative, that quests true objective might be to answer the question: What am I looking for? And though the journeys together have something of the quality of a pilgrimage to a healing spring, Masud is too skeptical to anticipate any sort of nature cure.",2023-06-06T09:00:47+0000

This brick-walled basement space became proof that a windowless underground location could be a destination when run by a notable chef like Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Here, Mr. Sartiano has dipped into his familys legacy from Naples and elsewhere in Italy, alongside Alfred Portale, the culinary director. Mr. Portale will now divide his time between this location and Portale, nearby in Chelsea, and he describes his food as elevated Italian American classics. He adds fennel to the fritto misto, makes a broccoli rabe pesto to coat sausage and orecchiette, inserts shavings of black truffle into the mushroom lasagna, enhances savory cannoli with caviar and prepares Dover sole piccata-style. The menu lists several steaks, including a 36-ounce porterhouse of olive-fed Wagyu. (And you thought Wagyu cattle only like beer.) The open kitchen faces part of the dining room, with one communal table and exposed brick walls. The room is richly upholstered, punctuated with mirrored columns.

Dean started asking the physicians she knew how they felt about their jobs, and many of them confided that they were struggling. Some complained that they didnt have enough time to talk to their patients because they were too busy filling out electronic medical records. Others bemoaned having to fight with insurers about whether a person with a serious illness would be preapproved for medication. The doctors Dean surveyed were deeply committed to the medical profession. But many of them were frustrated and unhappy, she sensed, not because they were burned out from working too hard but because the health care system made it so difficult to care for their patients.",2023-06-15T09:00:52+0000

Vasconceloss newest project is her most ambitious yet: Wedding Cake, an almost 40-foot-high three-tiered wedding cake pavilion in pastel shades of pink, green and blue, was installed this spring on the grounds of Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire, England. The whimsical creation is clad in 25,000 ceramic tiles (manufactured in Vasconceloss native Lisbon) and adorned with ceramic cherubs, dolphins and a water feature. Commissioned by the collector and arts philanthropist Lord Jacob Rothschild, the impossible project, as the artist describes it, has been five years in the making and is the culmination of Vasconceloss long-held fascination with the dynamics of weddings: Weddings are the most important moment in some womens lives, she says. Its the transition from one identity to another. All transition moments are marked by symbols. This is my way of working through these symbols and asking if they still make sense.
