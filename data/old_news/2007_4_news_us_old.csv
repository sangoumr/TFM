us,Designs for Living,"I confess that when I heard the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum had scheduled an exhibition titled Design for the Other 90%, I thought it was a survey of the welcome trend of retailers marketing stylish furnishings at prices that freelance journalists like me could afford. What a solipsist! The 90 % refers to the staggering 5.8 billion of the worlds population whose lives are defined not by rarefied yearnings but by the pangs of need. The kinds of products they require for survival have been ignored by most designers  until now. Whats so exciting about this show is that it marks a sea change, says Cynthia E. Smith, who curated the exhibition, which opens May 4. It surveys the trend toward more socially responsible design. A whole range of nonprofits and for-profits, community groups and international organizations are getting involved to create products that can lift the marginalized out of a subsistence existence. Smith cites a treadle pump from International Development Enterprises (IDE) that farmers can use to lift water from deep below ground. IDE re-engineered the traditional pump out of inexpensive metal cylinders and a bamboo frame so that those earning as little as a dollar a day could afford to buy it. Since it was introduced some 20 years ago, nearly 1.25 million have been sold in Asia and Africa, enabling farmers to extend their growing season and often double their incomes. And its not just groups that are making a difference  individuals are, too. Wanting to find a way for subsistence farmers to refrigerate their food, a Nigerian teacher, Mohammed Bah Abba, looked to African pottery for a solution. His earthenware pot-in-pot system draws on principles of physics used by the ancient Egyptians for food preservation. Now farmers can preserve enough produce to sell at market. The South African team of P. J. and J. P. S. Hendrikse created the Q-Drum wheel, to simplify transporting water. By demonstrating how ingenious, sustainable products can transform lives, the exhibit underscores the critical role design has to play in ending world poverty. Its admittedly a bigger notion than those of us with Cassina dreams and Target budgets typically entertain, but surely one we can all embrace.",2007-04-01T04:00:00+0000

Such a man secures hope against illusion, and by example refutes any argument against the plausibility of historical action. It would be too hard to act if decency itself had still to be invented. And yet the uncommonness of such a man casts a long shadow over the faith in eventual justice or eventual peace, because the figure is so lonely against the ground. The good man in a dark time is the unrepresentative man. He has the honor of an anomaly. He marks the distance that still has to be traveled.

Florence Broadhurst: Her Secret and Extraordinary Lives (Chronicle, $25) charts the career of a woman born to outback obscurity in 1899. In her 20s, she was a nightclub star. By 1927, Broadhurst had moved to London, where, as Madame Pellier, she ran a Bond Street dress shop. After World War II, she returned to Australia with a 10-year-old son and a man who may or may not have been her legal husband, cultivating the persona of a genteel British lady. In 1960, when a tenant  a struggling wallpaper manufacturer  fell behind in rent, she stepped in and began issuing the prints that made her famous, whether or not she actually designed them herself. The final mystery of Broadhursts life is her brutal, still-unsolved murder, perhaps by one of Australias most notorious serial killers, in 1977. In 2002 her patterns were resurrected by Signature Prints to great acclaim. Clearly, Broadhurst deserves another moment in the spotlight. Despite somewhat jejune writing, this beautiful book  covered with one of her patterns and bursting with reproductions of many others  makes an excellent curtain call.",2007-04-01T04:00:00+0000

This spring, following Bubbles, an inflatable environment of glowing white orbs, M&A is moving in a subtler direction with ukendt/igloo (above), a collaboration with the Danish conceptual artist Anja Franke. Past M&A projects have included the Mylar canopy called Maximilians Schell and Here There Be Monsters!, a bamboo bridge over an interactive water installation. But Frankes vision of a hand-woven textile igloo presented a new challenge: how to continue to push the boundaries of the built environment and peoples imaginations while working within the low-tech, glitz-free realm of crafts. The answer, Didier and her partner, Oliver Hess, have discovered, lies less in ancient basket-weaving techniques or in Buckminster Fullers tensegrity principle (both of which theyve studied in depth) than in the values of community and working with ones hands. I think people wake up and realize they can affect positive change when they start using their hands, says Didier, who notes that their network of volunteers keeps expanding. Whether the goal is changing the world or learning to weave, volunteering is a fun way to spend a Saturday.

Fukuyama, whose 1992 book The End of History and the Last Man was hailed as a classic neoconservative text on the end of the cold war, traces the origins and key principles of neoconservatism. He also proposes a post-Bush foreign policy, realistic Wilsonianism, which discredits forceful regime change and favors economic development and the creation of social capital, or soft power.

us,Once Upon a Country: A Palestinian Life," When I was a child it seemed that everywhere I went I came across traces of my family's history in Jerusalem. My father once told me that we Nusseibehs came from a long line of thieves. All family dynasties, he explained with an expression between earnestness and jest, can trace their histories back to some act of brigandage. I think he said this because of the pride Arabs often take in their ancient roots. You have to live in the present, Father lectured to me over and over when I was a child. Whereas I never pinned down precisely who the thieves were, I had no trouble finding old gravestones with names chiseled into the eroded limestone that in my imagination magically connected me up with 1,300 years of forbears, all the way back to the hot sands of Arabia.

us,Why the French Don't Like Headscarves," IN EARLY 2004, the French government passed a law prohibiting from public schools any clothing that clearly indicated a pupil's religious affiliation. Although worded in a religion-neutral way, everyone understood the law to be aimed at keeping Muslim girls from wearing headscarves in school. The law was based on recommendations issued in late 2003 by two prestigious commissions, one formed by the Parliament, the other appointed by President Jacques Chirac (the Stasi Commission). Their hearings and the media coverage of the issue depicted grave dangers to French society and its tradition of secularism (lacit) presented by Islamic radicalism, a trend toward ""communalism,"" and the oppression of women in the poor suburbs. Although some Muslims objected that the proposed law would violate their right to express religious beliefs and many observers doubted that a law banning scarves would seriously address the severe problems of integration in French society, the two commissions voted with near-unanimity for the law, and the measure passed with large majorities in the National Assembly and in the Senate. It went into effect in September 2004. ",2007-04-01T14:37:00+0000

One or two houses were new, and the town hall had been renovated, but the church was, of course, still there. The square remained open on one side, looking out over roof-tops and fields.

This special looks at seven stories that dared to challenge the fiction of the American dream: works from Theodore Dreisers Sister Carrie and Edith Whartons House of Mirth to F.

And so, over the last few years, scientists have unleashed a blitzkrieg of books in defense of Darwinism, summarizing the Everest of supportive evidence for evolutionary theory, filleting the arguments of the naysayers or reciting, yet again, the story of Charles Darwin, depressive naturalist extraordinaire, whose increasingly pervasive avuncular profile has lofted him to logo status on par with Einstein and the Nike swoosh.",2007-04-08T04:00:00+0000

Add a woman, opaque and mysterious, her past a dark negative the narrator holds up to the light, finding only his own reflection. Throw in a war, a disillusioned journalist as the antagonist whose world-weary asides counter the young mans tedious ignorance. Its an old story, made fresh by the first-time novelist Michael FitzGerald, who places his novel at the cusp of the Web boom and the end of the war in the Balkans, when Anthony Sinclair, a CNET producer disgusted by the soulless ease of his life, meets Gisela, a Hungarian bartender. He soon finds himself traveling from San Francisco to Budapest with her, supposedly to retrieve her son from an orphanage. There, they meet Marsh, a young British journalist covering the conflict, whose affection for Anthony takes the form of brutal proddings. (As they walk the streets of a trashed Serbian city in Croatia, Marsh tells Anthony to put his hands up and remain silent: Maybe just save your opinions for something you know about, like snowboarding, or whatever it is you did in college?) As Giselas story unravels, so does Anthony. But Radiant Days is more than a case study of Western apathy, circa 1995. With painful precision, FitzGerald shows us how little of Anthony  and the fractured countries he visits  there remains to redeem.",2007-04-08T04:00:00+0000

The same polls show that 60 to 70 percent of the American people believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction, and there is no doubt that President Bushs rating numbers are also headed in the wrong direction. Why then do Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Barack Obama consistently lose to Rudy Giuliani and John McCain in head-to-head matchups? (The three Democrats do outpoll Mitt Romney, but who wouldnt?)The answer usually given is that its early. Two years out voters are reacting to personalities, or rather, to their perception of personalities.

The east wind that whips Spain's southwest coast can be so trying, explains one of the characters in this long and pleasantly meandering novel, that the courts allow it to be cited ""as an extenuating circumstance in cases of assault and battery, physical abuse, even murder."" Juan, a doctor in his early 40s, and Sara, 53, a single woman of some means, become friends after settling in the same new beachfront development. For these emotional refugees from Madrid, the wind takes some getting used to. Why they each came to Andalusia are the mysteries that propel the narrative forward, and Grandes unravels them at a perfect pace, with just enough tension between the revealed and the hidden, the past and present. Sara's story, one of betrayal on many sides, reaches back to the Civil War, and the deal her impoverished parents struck with the devil, in the guise of a well-to-do woman who for a time was Sara's surrogate mother. Juan, who arrives with his 10-year-old niece and mentally disabled brother, has left behind a decade-long affair with his sister-in-law, now dead, and one terrible night he can't forget. The mix also includes an attractive single mother who cleans house for these two neighbors. It's all the ingredients for a sentimental daytime soap. But although she edges dangerously close, Grandes, whose book will appear next month, manages to keep this intricate story of flawed people engaging and fresh.",2007-04-15T04:00:00+0000

us,2007: A Face Odyssey,"We have always been slightly uneasy  notwithstanding our growing cultural obsession with youth and physical perfection  about the enormous value we assign to female physiognomy, based as it is on nothing more substantive than an undemocratic rolling of the genetic dice. Clearly, although we have all been bequeathed a more or less similar arrangement of facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, neck, skin), there are some women who emerge, either by way of felicitous lineage or a hazard of good fortune, with mugs to die for. Audrey Hepburn. Vivien Leigh. Grace Kelly. Julie Christie. Julia Roberts. Halle Berry. Penlope Cruz. The variations may range from the gamine to the sultry, the classic to the exotic  stopping along the way for the slightly more Nordic look that often goes with blond lovelies  but the theme is the same. They are undeniably beautiful; we, by and large, however attractive or striking, are not. This tragic and unearned differential (one that is becoming ever more tragic in a looksist society) has led us to devise ways of minimizing beautys importance with dispassionate abstractions or consoling, somewhat grandmotherly mantras. If you want to get high-minded about it, you can clutch for solace at the conjecture of the 18th-century philosopher David Hume that beauty exists merely in the mind . . . and each mind perceives a different beauty and hope that no one will notice that this observation, if it ever held up, preceded the invention of photography. Closer at hand is the adage Beauty is as beauty does, which is the kind of snippy comment Mary Poppins might have made if she came upon one of her charges preening before his or her reflection. Then there is the old platitude Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, which attempts a similar leveling of the playing field.",2007-04-15T04:00:00+0000

It may be true, in other words, that nobody knows anything, as the screenwriter William Goldman once said about Hollywood. But why?

(Back Bay/Little, Brown, $15.99. ) Gladwells best-selling first book, The Tipping Point, argued that small actions can ignite positive social change; Blink, a paean to the power of first impressions, makes the case for thin-slicing. There is, Gladwell suggests, a subconscious process through which we sift huge amounts of information, isolate telling details and come to rapid conclusions, even in the first two seconds of seeing something.  Blink is a book about those first two seconds, he writes. The book moves through dozens of stories about thin-slicing, from a Pentagon war game to New Coke, which tested well but flopped in the marketplace. Gladwell has us flying around the world and across disciplines at hectic speed, and hes always dazzling us with fascinating information and phenomena, David Brooks wrote in the Book Review.

us,The Story of the Cannibal Woman," Cape Town always slept in the same position, curled up in the muzzle of a gun. After hours of grim silence as heavy as a great fur coat of a former Soviet leader, the sound of engines began to sputter and roar throughout the city. In the distance, like the cries of cormorants, the horns of the first ferries split the clouds of mist grazing the sea as they left for Robben Island, once a concentration camp, now transformed into an international tourist attraction. Then the brakes of the overcrowded buses, arriving from the wretchedness of the shantytowns and converging on the splendors of the city center, screeched to a halt at the same stops. The feet of thousands of blacks in cheap shoes tramped toward the subaltern jobs that had always been their lot. All these sounds were preceded by the throbbing rounds of the police helicopters as their eyes pierced the dawn, searching to oust the criminals from their rat holes. For Cape Town at night oozed with all sorts of foulness and rottenness, a nightmare from which the city awoke completely drained, its storm channels churning bile and pus, its head of medlar trees and maritime pines bristling with fright.

us,"Religion Without Truth, Part Two","In a March 31st Op-Ed column I critiqued Professor Stephen Protheros claim (quoted in Time magazines April 2nd issue) that the academic study of religion  takes the biblical truth claims seriously and yet brackets them for purposes of classroom discussion. I questioned how anyone could take something seriously by leaving it at the door or putting it on the shelf. And I said that in the absence of its truth claims  claims like salvation is through belief in Jesus Christ who rose from the dead and redeemed us by taking upon himself all our sins  a religion was nothing more than a set of stories and ritual practices bereft of any transcendent meaning of which they would be the expression. You can teach those stories and practices  just as you might teach the stories and practices of baseball (which is, I know, the religion of some people)  but you wouldnt, I insisted, be teaching religion, only its empty shell.Of the hundred or so comments I received, only a few indicated agreement with my point. The others raised a number of objections, and among those objections three were prominent: 1) I fail to understand that one can teach the truth claims of religion as historical and cultural facts without either believing or disbelieving in them: To understand the works of Christians such as Chaucer, Dante, Milton or Shakespeare, one must understand something of Christianity. One must not, however, become a Christian. 2) Teaching the exclusive truth claims of a religion as matters of fact goes against the principles of liberal democracy and liberal education: Teaching religious thought as dogma is not education, but theocracy. 3) What I said in this column is contradicted by what I said in earlier columns: The argument you present seems to run counter to your prior claim that any potentially controversial topic can and should be studied within academicized grounds.First of all, I stipulate to the usefulness of teaching the bible as an aid to the study of literature and history. Im just saying that when you do that you are teaching religion as a pedagogical resource, not as a distinctive discourse the truth or falsehood of which is a matter of salvation for its adherents. One can of course teach that too; one can, that is, get students to understand that at least some believers hold to their faith in a way that is absolute and exclusionary; in their view nonbelievers have not merely made a mistake  as one might be mistaken about the causes of global warming  they have condemned themselves to eternal perdition. (I am the way.) What one cannot do  at least under the liberal democratic dispensation  is teach that assertion of an exclusive and absolute truth as anything but someones opinion; and in many classes that opinion will be rehearsed with at best a sympathetic condescension (lets hope they grow out of it) and at worst a condemning ridicule (even in this day and age, there are benighted people).

Mike Townsley of Greenpeace International suggests that question ahead of the first-ever debate on climate change at the UN Security Council on Tuesday. Time is of the essence, Townsely wrote in a discussion paper he forwarded to me over the weekend. The Council must live up to its mandate and address the threat of Weather of Mass Destruction with the same vigor as it is currently pursuing Weapons of Mass Destruction, he said in the paper, to be posted on the Greenpeace website on Tuesday. Townsleys point is that climate change will lead to increased geopolitical tension and conflict because of shifts in where food can grow and water can be accessed, and because of mass migrations from rising temperatures and sea levels. The looming challenges could mean a radical change in how nations cooperate and distribute aid money around the world. Thats something the Security Council could help to address. But, as Townsley points out, the United Nations plans no resolution and ultimately the job of finding enough money to help curb climate change and adapt to its effects will fall to nation states. Instead of more talk, Townsely wants governments to walk the walk by starting to channel massive chunks of their military budgets  including money to replace aging nuclear weapons  into renewable energy projects and efficiency to slash global emissions dramatically by mid-century.Is Townsley right? Do we live in a world where turning swords into ploughshares  or into biomass for making clean electricity  is the highest priority?

us,Beam Me Up,"How lasers work: In dermatology-speak, the word laser is a catchall for devises that use intense beams of focused bright light, those that use intense pulsed light (producing short, quick flashes) and ones that employ radio frequency or electromagnetic energy. To diminish wrinkles, some types of lasers, like Titan and Thermage, send energy deep into the dermis (the lower layers of skin) without damaging the epidermis (the upper layer). That energy creates heat and a slight injury, which sends the body into repair mode, encouraging existing collagen (a building block of skin) to contract and become tighter, and stimulating new collagen and elastin (another building block) to be produced. The result? Smoother, plumper, more youthful-looking skin. Other lasers, like Lyra, Affirm and V-Beam, have specific wavelengths that are attracted only to certain pigments, such as red or brown, and destroy anything within that color range, so they work well on blood vessels, spider veins, sunspots and hair. What a laser procedure is like: Most involve an application of topical anesthesia or a cooling gel, followed by a few passes of the device over the area to be treated. Patients usually experience slight warmth or a mild burning sensation, which dissipates quickly. Aftereffects can be similar to a sunburn  including some redness, swelling or flaking for up to a few days. How to find the right person to perform the procedure: Since you do not need a license to operate a laser, its best to look for a board-certified dermatologist (check the American Academy of Dermatology Web site at www.aad.org) who has lasers as a major part of his or her practice. Be sure to do your research: in the wrong hands, you could be burned or scarred. Adds Dennis Gross, M.D., a dermatologist and dermatological surgeon in New York (212-725-4555), A word-of-mouth recommendation never hurts. How to take care of post-laser skin: Use gentle products, dont scrub and slather on a nonirritating sunscreen  like one with zinc oxide  on a daily basis. Cost: It depends on the doctor, the size of the area to be treated and the strength of the laser. ",2007-04-17T04:00:00+0000

So it is that many newspapers and magazines no longer use images of cars with tobacco sponsors.

If the spirit should finally move me, and I answer the call to care for my fellow man unconditionally, the biggest challenge will be extending my newfound caritas to the religious zealots, for it is the zealots  more than the child molesters, petro-dictators or certain on-air personalities of the Fox News persuasion  whom I despise above all. Is it any wonder that from the Redeemer to Augustine, from Pascal to W. H. Auden, it has been the doubters, more than the believers, who have kept up religions good name? A skeptic in this tradition, Darcey Steinke is also, in her own way, a skeptic about the virtues of the contemporary memoir, now a mostly secular genre in which every human unhappiness is trendily medicalized or assigned its origin in a topical childhood trauma. In her memoir, Easter Everywhere, Steinke has dared to ask, What if my abiding sense of misery isnt due to abuse or balky neurotransmission, but to the absence of God in my life, to an unfulfilled relationship with my own divinity, as vouchsafed to me by the Creator?",2007-04-22T04:00:00+0000

Using the tools of his trade, computer-assisted reporting, Jaspin discovered a troubling demographic pattern: between 1890 and 1930, United States census data showed 260 suspect counties in which the black population appeared to fall suddenly by more than 50 percent. Jaspin ingeniously investigated the historical background of those statistical anomalies in 12 counties and found unequivocal evidence of mass racial expulsions. These incidents often began when the more familiar form of Jim Crow vigilantism, lynching, failed to satiate the mob's fury. The underlying motivation was usually economic competition. Two waves of intimidation in 1905 and 1909 that drove blacks out of Boone County, Ark., were typical. Ostensibly precipitated by crimes attributed to African-Americans, the expulsions followed closely on the arrival of an influx of unemployed black laborers. Why was this history ""hidden""? Jaspin points out that the concept of ""racial cleansing"" is of recent vintage, and wasn't understood by contemporaries, including the N.A.A.C.P., as a distinct category of persecution. His implied analogy to the Balkan ethnic cleansing campaigns of the 1990s is imprecise, since these American atrocities seem to have been more spontaneous and isolated. But Jaspin passionately defends his use of the term, and he recounts a rancorous struggle with his employers at Cox Newspapers, who eventually published only expurgated versions of the articles that are the basis of this book. For Jaspin, who was later demoted from editor to reporter, this was ""a demonstration of exactly how racial cleansings had come to be concealed in a thicket of lies, half-truths and euphemisms.""",2007-04-22T04:00:00+0000

Another time, he flatly rejected a Narcissus naked Yul Brynner, who was begging him to sleep with him and pathetically murmuring, Why wont you? Why wont you? The first, and probably only, woman Lerman ever saw naked was his great friend Marlene Dietrich, at a time when she was having what he described in a diary entry as an intense affair with Yul. According to Lermans lifelong love and partner, the artist Gray Foy, Dietrich had asked Lerman into her bath to demonstrate the female anatomy. Apparently, Lerman took in the view with respectful attention, if not passion. But he was not always so above-it-all. Meeting a young writer at a New York gathering in the mid-1940s, he complied with good humor when the man jumped on his back in a stairwell and demanded a piggyback ride. That man turned out to be Truman Capote.

Her romance with the paper proved far more enduring than the marriage  and the two that followed, for that matter, and her countless love affairs, which Schiff used as both extramarital diversions and sorbet courses between spouses. (Her most famous paramour, though never confirmed, was Franklin Roosevelt.) Schiff didnt sell The Post until she was 73.

Converging on the downtown convention center, reproductive endocrinologists, embryologists, andrologists, urologists, therapists, and psychologists attended courses in packed seminar rooms.

What I mean is that there are no serious issues that might be appropriately  as opposed to opportunistically  attached to this incident.

Many commentators have said that Imus should have distinguished between his usual targets  Hollywood celebrities, politicians, sports icons  and 10 innocent and vulnerable young women. But this criticism assumes that behind what Imus said over the years was some kind of social or moral or philosophical calculation.

us,Theater Listings,"I LAND What does the phrase hula dancing bring to mind? For some its the Elvis Presley movie Blue Hawaii. Or plastic flowers, cellophane skirts, perhaps even a coconut brassiere. It is unlikely to suggest the image of Hiiaka, the patron goddess of Hawaii, dancing for her sister Pele, the goddess of volcanic fire, to introduce a sacred ritual. But thats where it all started, according to this solo show, written and performed by Keo Woolford, whose first name, he says, is pronounced like O.K. backwards. To Mr. Woolford, left, hula is more than Hollywood kitsch. It is an important aspect of his identity and that of his home state. His show, he said after a recent preview performance, is not a history lesson or educational device, though it does much to counteract the perception that Hawaii is merely a vacation fantasy land. As Mr. Woolford reveals his journey, from growing up in Hawaii to starring in The King and I on the West End to performing with the Hawaiian boy band Brownskin, his sense of humor is apparent throughout. Created with and directed by Roberta Uno, and produced by the Ma-Yi Theater Company, I Land features plenty of dancing too  a combination of hula, hip-hop and even a dose of disco  choreographed by the hula kuma (teacher) Robert Cazimero and Ana (Rokafella) Garcia. But the shows serious underpinnings are clear. We wanted to open this window, so that you would actually ask yourself the question, What do I now know about this world that I assumed I knew everything about?  Ms. Uno said.

On Wednesday night Epitaph, made still bigger by new material, had its third New York iteration, at Jazz at Lincoln Centers Rose Theater. It started shakily, but by the end it had made its case.

Heck, it was tough to get things exactly right in the first round. But here is a name to look out for in the third round: Daniel Bazuin, a defensive end from Central Michigan.

Four teams  San Diego, San Francisco, Indianapolis and Oakland  have compensatory picks at the end of the round. Whats a compensatory pick? I had to double-check myself. When a team loses a free agent, the league awards that team a compensatory pick, based on that players value, as determined by the league. Confused? Youre not alone. Lets say the Colts lose Edgerrin James to free agency. The league might award Indianapolis an extra third-round pick. Thats exactly what happened this season.

us,The Post-Money Era,"Money is the great corrupter of American politics, turning candidates into the puppets of soulless corporations and selfish millionaires  unless, of course, you happen to be on the side that has more of it. Which is why Democrats who have long railed against the venality of their better-financed opponents now find themselves trumpeting their own superiority in presidential fund-raising. There are probably several reasons why Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama each managed to raise more than $25 million during the first quarter of 2007, easily surpassing their Republican rivals: outrage over the war in Iraq, the new primacy of the Internet (Obama hauled in 50,000 donations online) and a shift at the highest brackets. (According to a new Pew poll, there are now about as many affluent Democrats as there are Republicans.) Whatever the reasons, though, it seems likely that the nominees of both parties will ultimately decide to spurn federal matching funds in the general election, leaving them free to raise as much as they want  and effectively destroying the last vestiges of the system that has governed campaigns for the last 30 years. To put it another way, that distant rumble youre hearing is the sound of the dam that once held back a torrent of campaign cash, tumbling down onto itself.",2007-04-29T04:00:00+0000

Sharansky, as judge, would sentence Kissinger to exile in the Soviet Union without benefit of the Jackson amendment, which pressured the Soviets to permit Jews to emigrate. One can scarcely imagine the punishment he would have meted out to George Kennan (1904-2005), the diplomat-scholar who laid the foundations for the cold war policy Kissinger later executed, and who, we learn from John Lukacss elegant and elegiac biography, sharply opposed the American insistence that the Soviet Union facilitate emigration of its citizens in accord with some American preferences. Sharansky would not have been surprised to learn that Kennan also felt fairly at home in Berlin in the years before Americas entry into World War II, and regretted our involvement in the war (though he later wrote that the Holocaust was sufficient reason to fight Germany).",2007-04-29T04:00:00+0000

Born in the United States to a Canadian mother and a French father, she spent her childhood in Canada and Australia but made many holiday visits to her paternal grandparents, who lived outside Toulon. By that time, Whartons mansion in nearby Hyres had been turned into a restaurant and, as Messud recalled in an e-mail message, she has wonderful memories of running in those gardens while my parents and grandparents finished their interminable lunches on the terrace. In her teens, Messud read Whartons novels with great avidity and cites both Wharton and Henry James as influences on her own fiction  which wont surprise readers of her much-praised recent comedy of manners, The Emperors Children. There was, Messud added, great romance in her familys visits to Paris, and when she read Wharton she conflated the Paris of my childhood and the Paris that appears in her fiction.

Hell is other people, all right, but in these parched, futuristic landscapes, the devils are more likely Hells Angels than Sartres French neurotics.

They picked Korey Hall (linebacker, Boise State), Desmond Bishop (linebacker, California) and Mason Crosby (kicker, Colorado). Crosby is the only player of the three I had heard of. He was the third kicker taken in the draft, and he can consistently hit from beyond 50 yards. So, yes, Id say they found value with such a late pick.

On April 26 the student senate turned back a committee recommendation to derecognize the College Republicans because the group refused to apologize for one of its actions. What the College Republicans had done was invite applications for the First Annual White Heterosexual Male Scholarship, otherwise known by the acronym WHAM. Applicants were asked, first, to certify that they were indeed white, heterosexual, American and male and then to answer two questions: In 100 words or less, what does being a White Heterosexual American Male mean to you? As a White Heterosexual American Male, what adversities have you had to deal with and overcome?Many of the 40 or so who sent in applications recognized the satirical intention (to ridicule and parody raced-based scholarships and other forms of campus affirmative action) of the obviously bogus scholarship and wrote in the same spirit. But the student senate was not amused, and in February the Student Organizations Advisory and Review Committee demanded that the College Republicans: A) not award the $100 scholarship, B) apologize in writing for having violated the anti-discrimination section of the senates bylaws, and C) seek permission from the senate before mounting any programs in the next 12 months.

us,Coachella: Sponsored by ,"Indio, Calif., April 29One thing that sets Coachella apart from most other major live music events is the relative invisibility of the festivals sponsors. There are no logos emblazoned on the stages scattered across the grounds - all part of the promoters belief that alternative rock fans may recoil from the whole affair if they sense how much they are in the crosshairs of cachet-starved advertisers. But Madison Avenue is still more than eager to establish a beachhead here. During the day - while many fans at the polo field are scrambling to find shelter from the sweltering weather - a sunny ranch house, one dusty mile down the road, had been turned into a luxury lounge for guests of DKNY Jeans and the Los Angeles radio station Indie 103, hosts of one of the buzzed-about daytime parties that have become a constant of the festival. An ever-revolving crowd that included fashion designers, musicians and an iTunes executive or two drifted in. Hipsters inside snacked on grilled turkey burgers or played Guitar Hero II on an Xbox 360; outside, DKNY created a swag paradise, handing out free bikinis and swim trunks to guests and inviting them to take a dip in the pool, which sat atop a small pond with a rock waterfall. Others sunned themselves on white mattresses. Members of the buzzy Los Angeles band the Like stopped by, and organizers whispered that they expected one or more of the Reid brothers from the Jesus and Mary Chain.
