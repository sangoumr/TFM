In a statement on Thursday, Kenya said it had conducted a major aerial offensive on a militant training camp run by the group, the Shabab, in the Dinsoor region of Somalia, possibly killing as many as 300 militants and destroying the site. The casualty estimate could not be independently confirmed. Kenya said that the training camp had been used by Shabab operatives who had infiltrated Kenya, and that it was where those who carried out the mall attack had received their training. A spokesman for the African Union peacekeeping mission said the attack was part of the forces broader campaign against the Shabab. A Shabab spokesman denied that any of its camps had been attacked, Reuters reported. ",2013-11-01T00:59:06+0000

us,Mexico: Junk Food Tax Is Approved," Aiming to curb unhealthy consumption habits, Mexicos Congress on Thursday approved new taxes on sugary drinks and junk food. Lawmakers approved a tax of one peso per liter, or about 8 cents, on soft drinks and an 8 percent sales tax on high-calorie foods, including potato chips, sweets and cereal. President Enrique Pea Nieto is expected to sign the taxes into law in January. The soft drink and food industries lobbied heavily to defeat the plan, but lawmakers said it was necessary to reduce rising rates of obesity and diabetes, as well as to raise revenue. Almost 70 percent of Mexicans are overweight, and about a third are obese, according to the World Health Organization. The foundation of New York Citys mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, financed an ad campaign to support the so-called soda tax. The taxes were among several revenue-raising measures approved by lawmakers, including higher taxes on the wealthy and the elimination of some breaks for industrial plants on the border with the United States, known as maquiladoras.

Zachariah Deng Majok of the Abyei Referendum High Committee said that 99.9 percent of those who had voted wanted to be part of South Sudan. But the nonbinding referendum was not recognized by the governments of Sudan and South Sudan or by the African Union. Both Sudan and South Sudan claim ownership of oil-rich Abyei, and the region is shared uneasily by two ethnic groups: the more-settled Ngok Dinka and the nomadic Misseriya. The Ngok Dinka, allied with South Sudan, took part in the referendum, but the Misseriya, who are close to Sudans government, did not.

Until now, what theyd never done was try to figure out how to sell broccoli. Or any vegetables or fruits of any kind. This of course is not unique to Victors & Spoils. Major American advertising agencies tend not to get hired by produce growers to help them market fresh fruits and vegetables. They are hired by large companies making huge profits from processed foods to reach into whatever crannies of the American (or global) public they have not yet connected with. Victors & Spoils is exceedingly good at doing just that. The agencys Smile Back campaign for Coca-Cola, which was released this summer, has been hailed as an ingenious use of a kind of guerrilla advertising, albeit with very slick production, composed of footage of grinning, attractive ambassadors for Coca-Cola pedaling through cities and rural areas around the globe, handing out free Cokes to anyone who smiled back.",2013-11-01T09:00:17+0000

Since the founding of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other mainstays of what technology writers have come to call the social Web or Web 2.0, a sizable portion of humanity has learned to be together while apart, sacrificing intimacy for control and spontaneity for predictability. On the Web, we can be whoever we wish to be, editing the face we show to others in ways that arent possible in physical space. We can also fine-tune the complexity and depth of our interactions and relationships. The result is a sense of freedom whose appeal is evident in the exponential growth of the largest social media services, but it may be a misleading sense of freedom since the tools that make it possible are, for the most part, commercial enterprises, subtly shaping our behavior in ways designed to earn profits for their proprietors.

Their efforts, spanning several years, have culminated in the meticulously researched and thoughtful book The App Generation: How Todays Youth Navigate Identity, Intimacy and Imagination in a Digital World, which explores how young people view themselves and their relationships when smart devices are nearly ubiquitous, social rites happen via text message and the currency of popularity is traded in likes and comments on social-sharing apps.

The second is characteristic of the Internet in general and social media in particular. But theres nothing revolutionary about this, Standage says.

I was about to undergo transcranial direct-current stimulation, or tDCS, an experimental technique for delivering extremely low dose electrical stimulation to the brain. Using less than 1 percent of the electrical energy necessary for electroconvulsive therapy, powered by an ordinary nine-volt battery, tDCS has been shown in hundreds of studies to enhance an astonishing, seemingly implausible variety of intellectual, emotional and movement-related brain functions. And its side effects appear limited to a mild tingling at the site of the electrode, sometimes a slight reddening of the skin, very rarely a headache and certainly no seizures or memory loss.

Some, hearing the amounts being offered for drilling rights, are eager to sign up. But troubles arise when an old-timer (Hal Holbrook) starts asking questions about what fracking will do to the water supply, the livestock and the land itself. Then an environmental activist (John Krasinski) appears on the scene. The movie has a point to make, and it does so in a way that is both honorable and disappointing, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this film, directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Mr. Damon and Mr. Krasinski. It admirably tries to represent both sides of the fracking debate, even though its allegiance is clearly to the antifracking position. There is nothing wrong with such advocacy, except that in this case it means that the movie veers away from its strengths, ending in a welter of convenient (and dubious) plot twists and puffed-up speeches.

The works were reportedly confiscated by the Nazis during the 1930s and 40s and, if confirmed as genuine, would be among the largest recoveries of looted art with a possible value over $1.3 billion. The stockpile was discovered by chance in 2011, when tax investigators obtained a warrant to search the home of Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of the art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt. There are international warrants out for at least 200 pieces in the collection, which is being stored in a secured warehouse in Munich. It is unclear why the discovery was not publicly reported until now.

Super Fun Night, which stars Rebel Wilson, received an additional order of only four episodes, setting the show up to be replaced at some point later in the season. Another new comedy, Back in the Game starring James Caan, did not receive an additional episode order, leaving its future in doubt after its initial 13-episode order is completed. The vote of confidence for Trophy Wife was something of a surprise, considering its ratings have been the lowest out of the four shows through the early part of the season. The other three have been on fairly equal ground in terms of viewership, but none could be qualified as hits. The Goldbergs has averaged 6.1 million total viewers; Super Fun Night 6.4 million; Back in the Game 6.7 million; Trophy Wife has averaged 4.7 million.",2013-11-03T22:45:36+0000

(13) LOU REED: ROCK AND ROLL HEART (1998) The director Timothy Greenfield-Sanders tours Mr. Reeds career, from his days with the Velvet Underground and denizen of Warhols Factory to his solo work and collaboration with Robert Wilson. The film also touches on dark side of Mr. Reed, above, but is careful to note that he has gone past all that, Caryn James wrote in The New York Times about this American Masters presentation. And though the documentary takes too much at face value, Mr. Reed himself sounds more sophisticated about how public image and reality bleed together.

The American government, which filed an extradition request for him after his release, this week offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. According to the high court ruling, lower court judges made a mistake when they decided there had been a jurisdiction problem in trying Mr. Caro Quintero in federal court and ordered his release. The new ruling allows the Mexican authorities to order him back to prison to complete the remaining 12 years of his 40-year sentence for the killing of the agent, Enrique Camarena, although Mexico could choose to extradite Mr. Caro Quintero if he is found.

The newspaper said Mr. Priebke, who died last month under house arrest in Rome at the age of 100, was buried in late October. Officials at the Justice Ministry, which oversees Italys prison system, were unable to confirm the report. After Mr. Priebkes death, Italian and church officials in Rome refused to allow a public funeral, and a private commemoration in a town outside the capital turned violent. Fearful that his grave would become a beacon for neo-Nazi sympathizers, officials in Italy, Germany and Argentina, where Mr. Priebke lived until he was extradited to Italy in 1995, refused to accept his body. The newspaper said that the body would eventually be released to Mr. Priebkes two sons. ",2013-11-08T02:02:49+0000

But in Alissa Quarts new book, Republic of Outsiders, we meet the often unlikely agitators who are participating in new social and cultural revolutions using the tools of what we would once have called the Man  technology, entrepreneurialism and even finance. What emerges is a hopeful, if sometimes uneven, portrait of a mainstream culture thats constantly being rewritten by the people at its margins.",2013-11-08T15:29:03+0000

us,Dispatches,"If blinded in one eye by shrapnel, many journalists would consider early retirement. At the very least they would contemplate avoiding areas known for ambushes and land mines. But Marie Colvin, one of the bravest and certainly best-dressed foreign correspondents of our time, simply turned that injury, which she sustained while reporting in Sri Lanka for The Sunday Times of London, into a style statement. After an excruciating recovery involving flashbacks of the attack, this extraordinary American reporter donned a black eye patch and returned to the field to risk her life over and over again. When she was killed by a rocket attack in Syria in February 2012 on yet another assignment, colleagues were stunned, although not exactly surprised. Colvin, after all, often arrived at the front lines first and stayed longer than others. She had been stranded on a 12,000-foot mountain in Chechnya. She was nearly lynched in Egypt. She spent half her 56 years in the worlds most brutal conflict zones. Her luck couldnt last forever.",2013-11-08T15:30:01+0000

us,Holding Court,"In a famous passage in Marbury v. Madison, the 1803 case establishing the power of judicial review, Chief Justice John Marshall observed that the question of whether an act inconsistent with the Constitution could stand is a question deeply interesting to the United States, but, happily, not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest. Two hundred and ten years later, another eminent jurist has turned to questions whose intricacy matches  or exceeds  their interest. Reflections on Judging by Richard A. Posner, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, is about what judges should do when confronted with complexity. Like the rest of us, judges face an increasingly bewildering world, marked by daily advances in such areas as social media, the sciences and globalization. Unlike the rest of us, judges must make decisions that enforce their understanding  or misunderstanding  of that complexity onto millions. In its organization, this is a simple book. Posner recognizes that awesome charge: he decries one common response to complexity, and endorses another.",2013-11-08T15:31:53+0000

But POLICE (Knopf, $25.95) is no place to start. This densely plotted story, translated by Don Bartlett, is one of Nesbos darkest and most disturbing, the tale of a serial killer with a taste for the macabre who observes the anniversary of each of his murders by luring a police detective to a gruesome death at the scene of the very crime the officer failed to solve.

The trip has been planned for months, but just as theyre ready to leave, Matthews wife phones to tell them Matthew has vanished. Should they go on the trip anyway? They decide they will, but now the trip is no longer a vacation, but a missing-person investigation. So begins Meg Rosoffs Picture Me Gone, a melancholy and ruminative book that is part travelogue, part mystery and part coming-of-age for Mila. Mila is a rarefied sort of narrator, familiar to certain parts of Rosoffs adopted London and to places like New York City, if not many other locations. Mila is the only child of a Swedish-Sudanese orchestra-musician mother and a father who translates Portuguese into English; they came to parenthood late, never marrying.",2013-11-08T15:34:45+0000

The others are set around Sylveros, an enchanted town nestled within the Palisade of Thorns. Outside the palisade, Nightmares roam. Inside, Petlings predominate. These are human-size, upright-walking, talking animals that were once the favorite pet of a human child.

Treasure Hunters, Pattersons latest middle-grade novel, was written with his frequent collaborator Chris Grabenstein; another writer, Mark Shulman, and an illustrator, Juliana Neufeld, are also credited inside. As befits the number of human beings involved, the book is pretty jam-packed. The siblings Bick, Beck, Tommy and Storm have grown up on a 63-foot sailboat, helping their father, a famous oceanographer, dredge up Spanish galleons, sunken Ming dynasty pottery and diamond-encrusted Cypriot artifacts. But when their mother disappears in Cyprus and their father is washed overboard, the kids have to keep the vessel and the family treasure-hunting business afloat while escaping from all sorts of villains including, but not limited to, an arms dealer who collects Grecian urns; Ukranian knuckle-draggers; and a vicious coed.",2013-11-08T15:44:28+0000

But the issue never gets much traction, and one reason is the perception that its politically hopeless: Republicans would never go for such a program. My Sunday column tries to push back at the assumption that its hopeless and notes that one of the leaders in providing pre-K in America isnot Massachusetts, not New York, not some other blue state, but reliably red Oklahoma. Its all the more surprising because Oklahoma spends less per pupil on education than almost any other state, and pays its teachers near the bottom. This is not a state that believes in lavish spending on schooling. Yet, quite remarkably, it provides universal high-quality pre-K, with a ratio of no more than 10 students per staff member, and all teachers have a college degree.",2013-11-09T21:40:51+0000

The glimpses of the operas are so good that one wants to see more, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. They include The Marriage of Figaro, about which the Emperor complains that there are too many notes, The Abduction From the Seraglio and The Magic Flute, and, in one of the films most imaginative, most hallucinatory sequences, a parody version of Don Giovanni, whose obscenities, of course, delight the now ailing Mozart.

But it has decided to set out on a mission even more established museums might fear: a comprehensive survey of contemporary American art, formed by visits to hundreds of artists studios across the country. The resulting show, State of the Art, will bring together the work of 100 artists for a show that will open on Sept. 13and continue through Jan. 5, 2015. For the last several months, the museums president, Don Bacigalupi, and an assistant curator for special projects, Chad Alligood, have been traveling by plane and car to almost every part of the country, relying on an initial list of 10,000 artists, to find works they will include in the show. They have visited more than 400 studios and artists so far, in dozens of cities, but also in rural places so small that the roads to them have not shown up on the curators GPS devices. Weve come to recognize that many extraordinary artists may be known in their own locales, but have yet to emerge on the national stage, Mr. Alligood said. Their work, however, deserves consideration from a national audience. State of the Art could be seen as a traditionalist alternative to a show like the Whitney Biennial, but there are currently no plans to make it a recurring event.",2013-11-11T22:56:01+0000

The discovery adds credence to the prevailing theory that the virus originates in bats but usually reaches humans through camels. In three earlier clusters of MERS cases, the first patient to fall ill in each was reported to have had contact with a sick camel. Although antibodies to the disease had been found in camels before, the virus itself had not. Genetic tests will be done, the ministry said, to see if the camels strain is identical to that found in the patient, a 43-year-old man in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, who is still hospitalized. MERS has killed 64 people since it was first isolated a year ago, 53 of them in Saudi Arabia. It can also spread from human to human, but seems to do so less readily than SARS  severe acute respiratory syndrome  did. ",2013-11-12T00:44:56+0000

The men, Bashir Khamkhoyev and the brothers Islam and Ilez Yandiyev, were convicted of providing explosive materials to the bomber, Magomed Yevloyev, 20, and for organizing his stay in Moscow before the January attack. A fourth man, Akhmed Yevloyev, the bombers brother, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Doku Umarov, the leader of an Islamist terrorist group carrying out an insurgency in the countrys North Caucasus region, later claimed responsibility for the bombing. Mr. Umarov, who remains a fugitive, has since called on his followers to disrupt the 2014 Winter Olympics, which Russia will host in Sochi, a resort city on the edge of the turbulent region.

That is the argument that the boycott is wrong because it is selective, because it singles out Israel when there are so many other countries in the world whose policies and actions are just as bad or worse. Actually, this is not an argument; it is a debating point (as some who offer it know): it is a form of reductio ad absurdum, the rhetorical trick of extending an opponents claim until it yields an absurd result, in this case the absurd result that follows if we are required to break off relations with universities housed in nations whose human rights record we find questionable: on this reasoning, we would have to break off relationships with everyone and there would be no academic exchange at all.",2013-11-12T00:52:02+0000

Russias investigative committee explained the transfers by saying that the courts in Murmansk did not have jurisdiction over the hooliganism charges the 30 face and that the investigating body in charge of the case was in St. Petersburg. The Netherlands has appealed to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for the release of the crew and the ship.

Mr. Sinha swiftly released a statement of apology: I regret any hurt caused, as the same was inadvertent and unintended, it read, explaining that he was condemning such reasoning, and adding, I reiterate my deep sense of respect for women and commitment to gender issues.

But to my ear, at least, a specific Springsteenian echo announces itself early and deepens as this movie winds from Billings, Mont., across the Badlands and toward Lincoln, stopping for a while in the tiny and fictitious hamlet of Hawthorne. Beyond the folky intonations of the fiddle-and-guitar waltz (by Mark Orton) that accompanies the opening images (shot by Phedon Papamichael) and beyond the bleak beauty of the images themselves, there is something in the movie that brings to mind the haunting last line of the albums title track: Sir I guess theres just a meanness in this world.",2013-11-14T23:06:43+0000

Second, particularly with the children who are recipients, the malnutrition is real and there is mounting evidence that it has long-term effects that leave those children less equipped to succeed at school and live productive lives. Im particularly swayed by the NBER study that my column cites and links to, indicating that when children under five get food stamps, their long-term health outcomes are better, and they are less likely to end up on welfare.

It was 1988, he was 32 and, for the first time, had an 1,100-seat opera house, an orchestra and a costume department at his disposal. He used it all with relish. LAllegro, which returns to Lincoln Center this week, wasnt immediately acclaimed by the local critics. (Mr. Morriss biographer, Joan Acocella, quotes one review: Where is the profundity?) But it has become Mr. Morriss most famous piece, celebrated for its innocence, exuberance and how it suggests the physical embodiment of ideal worlds. The work is set to the 1740 Handel oratorio from which it takes its title, and which uses the texts of Miltons LAllegro and Il Penseroso, portraits of the joyful and contemplative minds. Filled with nymphs and shepherds, gods and humans, hunters and lovers, the dance is beautiful, lavish and funny. It is, as Ms. Acocella writes, a hymn to the unity of poetry, music and dance.

I wanted to mix modern and classical materials to create a timeless space, said Wang, who cited historic museums as inspiration for the store, his first as the brands creative director. The interiors are also a testament to Wangs point of view for the brand, full of references to his debut collection for Balenciaga, which took place on a faux marble runway back in February. Even the chairs that dot the grand, open floor plan  which also includes several intimate rooms that each house different kinds of goods (ready-to-wear in one room, shoes in another, etc.)  have been upholstered in the same black caviar embroidery he applied to gowns in the fall 2013 collection. Combined with the sofas, they seem to beg shoppers to stay awhile.

When the show begins, Moukarzel is running on a treadmill, his back to us, instantly conjuring images of being borne back ceaselessly into the past (or, stuck in the present).

us,Central African Republic Stirs Concern," Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, raised the possibility on Monday that thousands of international peacekeeping troops in Africa might have to be temporarily redeployed in the Central African Republic, one of the most unstable on the continent. In a dire report, Mr. Ban said an African Union force that was set to assume peacekeeping and security responsibilities in the Central African Republic might not be ready in time for its December deployment schedule. If there were a precipitous deterioration, Mr. Ban said, the United Nations could respond by moving soldiers from neighboring peacekeeping missions, like those in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Sudan, with the approval of the Security Council and countries contributing troops. Outside Bangui, the capital, government authority is nonexistent, Mr. Ban said, and clashes between rebels and their opponents have become increasingly brutal and sectarian. This cycle, if not addressed now, threatens to degenerate into a countrywide religious and ethnic divide, with the potential to spiral into an uncontrollable situation, including atrocity crimes, with serous national and regional implications, he said.

(IFC) EYES WIDE SHUT (1999) A doctor (Tom Cruise), enraged by the desire of his wife (Nicole Kidman, above, with Mr. Cruise) for another man, embarks on an odyssey of sexual temptation in this final film by Stanley Kubrick, inspired by Arthur Schnitzlers Traumnovelle (Dream Story). Open-ended vignettes star Sydney Pollack as the unsavory host of a lavish Christmas party, Alan Cumming as a conspiratorial hotel concierge, Rade Sherbedgia as the proprietor of a costume rental shop, and Leelee Sobieski as his naughty daughter. There is consolation for having to read the words The End on the posthumous work of Mr. Kubrick: this astonishing last film is a spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. Despite some abrupt editing in a work that the director never lived to fine-tune, the film moves effortlessly, and it goes straight under the skin. Its powerful and lingering resonance attests to a final compassion and profundity in Mr. Kubrick, the body-and-soul commitment of Mr. Cruise and Ms. Kidman, and the Rorschach-like ability of this material to envelop audiences in ways unexplained and unexpected. She added: Life goes on, Mr. Pollacks character says cynically late in the film. It always does, until it doesnt. Along with that sentiment, Mr. Kubrick left one more brilliantly provocative tour de force as his epitaph.",2013-11-21T06:00:06+0000

In the years following, though, he had starred in only two live-action films (and provided a voice for the cartoon ParaNorman). His most recent and notorious creative project was in 2010, when he poured his heart, brain and wallet into Im Still Here, a passion project he made with his brother-in-law and close friend, Joaquin Phoenix. The hoax-documentary purported to chronicle Phoenixs real-life personal implosion, as he supposedly made the switch from acting to a rap career.

About the severity of those problems there is no question, and some of them broach primary issues of politics and morality; but Israels problems are too often combined and promoted into a Problem, which has the effect of emptying the Jewish state of its actuality and consigning it to a historical provisionality, a permanent condition of controversy, from which it can be released only by furnishing various justifications and explanations.

us,Before the Sun Rose,"In the Paris spring of 1925, a young American writer sent a letter to his new publisher in which he assessed his chances in the literary marketplace. The only commercial magazine to which he had as yet sold a story was a German number that wanted to translate a piece about a matador, but he nevertheless told Horace Liveright he hoped to become a valuable property. Most readers found modern literature too difficult, and he knew that some wonderful books had been commercial failures; Liveright himself had published more than a few of them. Still, his own collection of stories was different, and he felt he had a good gambling chance to sell. For his work, he thought, would be praised by highbrows and can be read by lowbrows.

One day, as I was staring at the dirt in a heat-induced daze, a younger student commented how hard it was to make sense of it all. I could only agree, but as we chatted, I realized  to my deep embarrassment  that we were talking about entirely different things. I was obsessing over the technicalities of decoding this complex deposit, while he wanted to know what it had felt like to stand there 2,500 years earlier, sacrificing to alien gods.

(Showtime) STAGE BEAUTY (2004) In this high-end costume drama about theater in 17th-century England, directed by Richard Eyre and based on a play by Jeffrey Hatcher, Billy Crudup, above, portrays Ned Kynaston, among the last of the old-school female impersonators and a specialist in doomed Shakespearean heroines. Claire Danes is Maria Hughes, who starts out as his stage-struck dresser and later becomes his rival as women are allowed to appear onstage. Rupert Everett hams it up as King Charles II; and Tom Wilkinson is Othello to Neds Desdemona. For about two-thirds of its length Stage Beauty is propelled by a complex and fascinating set of ideas about sexual identity and theatrical performance, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But as it rushes toward an upbeat ending, the movie at once recoils from this notion and bizarrely succumbs to its logic. In disowning drag and in straightening out Ned Kynaston, Stage Beauty  absurdly for a work that professes to revel in the love of theater  takes a literal-minded stand for the straight and narrow in both sex and art.",2013-11-22T18:25:55+0000

But can she help Tom, who has had writers block since the publication of his first book? Although Mr. Pawlikowski often shows Mr. Hawke in medium and long shots, the actor draws you close, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Theres anguish in Toms face that speaks of a terrible fragility and that leavens the storys mysterioso proceedings with a real, recognizable humanity. In The Words (2012), at 9, Dennis Quaid plays Clay Hammond, a successful author whose new novel tells the story of Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper), a writer turned supervisor at a literary agency who comes upon an unsigned manuscript in a satchel that his wife (Zo Saldana) gave him and decides to pass the work off as his own. And a star is born. Then an old man (Jeremy Irons) approaches Rory in Central Park and reveals his identity, and Rorys eyes widen with alarm. Despite a compelling performance by Mr. Irons, this first feature film directed and written by Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal is a clever, entertaining yarn that doesnt bear close scrutiny, Stephen Holden wrote in The Times.

Journalists questioned the logic of individuals giving to a wealthy country like Japan, and philanthropic advisors encouraged donors to give to organizations that could redirect funds to other more pressing needs outside of Japan after the initial relief effort. It was understandable, perhapsthe fog of disaster makes it hard to immediately know how much is needed, or what help is needed, even where.",2013-11-26T16:11:24+0000

It offers the same cool, casual elegance as the Bowery Hotel, a few blocks across town, but at a fraction of the price. The similarities to the Bowery are no surprise, as the Marlton is the work of the hotelier Sean MacPherson (also a developer of the Maritime and the Jane), who has once again created a hotel that feels as if it wasnt designed just to sleep but also to sidle up to the bar in a dignified way and watch the P.Y.T.s come and go. Its the kind of place you could easily visit for afternoon tea with a parent on one of the plush sofas, or rendezvous with your lover for a martini followed by a trip to one of the small yet charming rooms, where the bed is the main attraction and finishing details are not overlooked. If youre not in the mood for libations  and with creations like the Marvelous Sour (recipe below), the Marlton has taken steps to make sure that never happens  there is an espresso bar in the lobby that makes raw almond cappuccinos and gluten-free, vegan breakfast cookies. Coming soon will be a 98-seat restaurant in the rear of the lobby, Caf Marlton, which will serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. As a longtime neighbor of the building the Marlton now occupies, I can safely say its the best recent addition to the neighborhood where charm reigns supreme. ",2013-11-26T17:02:03+0000

This is a reason, I wrote, for even J.F.K. skeptics like myself to feel a little sympathy for the cult of Camelot because it speaks to a deep and admirable human desirefor grace and beauty, for icons and heroes, for a high-stakes dimension to human affairs that a consumerist, materialist civilization can flatten and exclude. Thevarious things that J.F.K.s admirers cite when they praise the man and his administration  the physical vigor and the soaring rhetoric, the patronage of high culture and the man-on-the-moon technological ambition, the Cuban Missile Crisis drama and the founding of the Peace Corps  might not match up to a reality that was much more personally sleazy, culturally incurious and geopolitically reckless.

As a result, same-sex National Guard spouses in those states could sign up for benefits only by traveling to a federal military installation.

More dangerously, she is supposed to have put herself under the thumb of domineering women favorites with political agendas: first the Whig partisan Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, and subsequently the duchesss upstart cousin Abigail Masham, a Tory sympathizer. (It is suggested from the surviving correspondence that Anne might have had lesbian leanings, though whether these were ever acted upon is unknown.)

Freud was so well known that he was allowed into Clarkes  a small upmarket restaurant frequented by Bryan Ferry, Salman Rushdie, Dame Maggie Smith, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge  before it opened in the morning, and invited to enjoy a leisurely meal in what functioned as his private salon. Over dinner at Londons more glittering establishments, he could pelt strangers with breadsticks, spew obscenities, pummel a waiter, grope the waitresses, amuse his companions by imitating a masturbating whale  and be welcomed back the next evening. At Clarkes, Lucians conversation ranged from dating Greta Garbo to the best way to land a punch without breaking your thumb, to how he had popped in to 10 Downing Street to see Gordon Brown, or had been to a nightclub with Kate Moss.

That she was a breech birth, that the death of women in childbirth was a given in early 19th-century England, are simply facts.

At 5, he was banished from this paradise and sent back to the mother country to be raised by a placid English couple. The husband had the bad manners to die, leaving the boy in the charge of the wife, who was secretly a monster.

(HBO) BEAUTIFUL CREATURES (2013) Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich), an almost-too-good-to-be-true high school boy despairing of his conservative South Carolina existence, meets his dream girl, Lena (Alice Englert), when her family of witches moves to town, and its kind of like Romeo and Juliet, but, like you know, happier, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this pop Southern Gothic amusement about teenage love and other powerful magic. Lena has some spooky relatives, including her Uncle Macon (Jeremy Irons) and cousin Ridley (Emmy Rossum). Ethan comes with a nanny, Amma (Viola Davis, above left, with Ms. Englert and Mr. Ehrenreich). Beautiful Creatures, its sweet young things and supernatural shenanigans have been marshaled to help fill the box office void left by the end of the Harry Potter and Twilight franchises, Ms. Dargis said of this adaptation of Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohls book. Its a void that The Hunger Games has already started to fill, partly by tapping into deeply American themes and giving them thrilling female form. Beautiful Creatures has been spun from thinner material, despite its strong female characters, nods at the Civil War and a story that turns on good versus evil, a fight that  as in many young adult stories  is somewhat mirrored in the struggle between the high school herd and the individual. Theres not much new under the moon here, which makes what the writer and director Richard LaGravenese does with the story all the more notable.",2013-11-30T06:00:05+0000
