us,The Clinton Magic,"In a sweeping, sprawling, drawling 48-minute stemwinder of a speech last night, the former President of the United States drove a rhetorical truck through the biggest opening that Mitt Romney and the Republicans created for Democrats last week. The G.O.P. convention promised to make difficult choices and hard calls and be bracingly honest with the public, but the Republican speakers discussed policy in only the broadest and loosest terms, eschewing detail in favor of generalizations and creativity in favor of boilerplate. In response, Bill Clinton did everything they didnt, diving deep on policy detail, covering issues ranging from Medicaid to welfare to prescription drugs to student loans, and effectively defining the Republicans defining them negatively, it need hardly be said on a range of issues where they declined to define themselves. Writing on Paul Ryan last week, I said that we shouldnt be surprised that his speech was less wonky than his reputation, since a VP address is hardly the time to talk about block grants and premium support and whether to peg spending rates to inflation or G.D.P. plus one percent. But Clinton reminded us that this need not be true  that its possible to get wonky without losing your audience, and to embrace policy detail as a weapon against your opponents. Journalists tend to assume that voters tune policy substance out, and when the substance is delivered droningly or too abstractly no doubt they often do. But for the most effective rhetoricians, the mere act of talking in detail about the work of government can be a more effective way to persuade the public that youre serious than a hundred vague promises to make the hard choices and level with the American people.",2012-09-06T13:44:07+0000

Traveling through Maryland, where slavery was still legal, and Pennsylvania, where anti-black animus still ran high, would have made for tough going for most free blacks.

The novel is equally a tribute to the cinematic style of Quentin Tarantino, whose films its characters study and discuss, and whose preoccupations pepper its pages: kung fu, cinematic allusions and the blaxploitation films of the 1970s; and an interest in African-American characters and experience. Chabon and Tarantino make an unlikely duo; while the latters films tend toward gaudy eruptions of violence, Chabon bends Tarantinos sensibility to a warmhearted novel about fatherhood in which the onstage violence consists of two graphic childbirth scenes and a 15-year-old boy whacking a chubby thug with a wooden sword.

us,The President Plays It Safe,"The strongest impression left by Mitt Romneys convention speech last week was that the Republican nominees campaign sees itself on pace for a narrow victory in November, with no risks or course corrections needed. The impression left by President Obamas convention speech tonight was that incumbents campaign feels exactly the same way. This was a pure stay-the-course speech, workmanlike and occasionally somewhat distant, with a few inspired and moving passages standing out amid a litany of rhetorical moves that the president has made many times before. There was only the most general sketch of a second term agenda, only a relatively cursory defense of the presidents economic stewardship, and mostly assertions, rather than sustained arguments, to back up his claim that the country is headed (slowly) in the right direction. The strongest and most detailed portions of his remarks came on foreign policy (where his record is more popular and easier to defend)and in his late-in-the-speech attacks on the Republican ticket, which did effectively exploit some of the vulnerabilities that Romneys rather content-free address created. And yes, maybe if Bill Clinton hadnt covered so much of that territory so effectively last night, these strengths would have been enough to make the speech feel successful as a whole. But in the shadow of Clintons performance, the president often felt flat, rote, and unconvincing almost as though he wasnt quite convinced by his own arguments and promises, and felt a little awkward selling them to us.",2012-09-07T03:51:19+0000

Soon the miraculous substance was bottled into products like Coppertone QT, which promised 1960s-style convenience: bronze yourself while you sleep; tan groom your legs, so you wont need stockings. DHA produced the color changes by what was called a Maillard reaction, browning the top layer of human skin much the same way a steak browns as it cooks.

It tells a story of political foibles, overly ambitious goals and feckless Afghans and Americans.

As a crowd swooped down on the battered corpse of the archbishop, tearing off pieces of clothing to dip in the gruesome puddle of his blood and brains, the outlines of the story of Beckets sudden conversion from luxury-loving chancellor to ascetic defender of the church were already being rehearsed, soon to be followed by tales of his miraculous powers.",2012-09-07T16:25:10+0000

Next, using a contoured blush brush (in place of the classic, dome-shaped powder brush), Kendal applied two shades of Nars Sheer Glow Powder Foundation  a lighter one on the outside of the face and a darker one across the cheeks  to perfect. (At press time, Kendal was not at liberty to disclose why, but a selection of models were given a more futuristic finish using Nars Light Reflecting Loose Setting Powder and Albatross Highlighting Blush on the high points of their cheeks, with some also sporting bleached or whited-out brows.) Eyes were contoured using Cayenne eyeshadow, while the same product in Blondie (light) or Bali (dark) were used to fill in the brows. Lashes were left bare.The Hair: Ponytails are always very prevalent in New York, says the stylist Guido Palau. Half my career has been based on trying to reinvent it. For Wangs presentation, Palau used a variation on a look hed originally conceived in the early 90s: the taped center-part. To modernize the look, the stylist opted for dual texture  a sleek top with movement in the back  and low positioning. To achieve this, the top of the head (to behind the ears) was first dampened, then parted and treated with Redken Satinwear 02 Ultimate Blow-Dry Lotion before being blown straight.

Krauss, a physicist, takes the view that all answerable questions are empirical; any philosophical question that turns out to be answerable, then, is in fact a disguised (frequently nascent) scientific one. Baggini contends that ethical questions are the great counterexample to Krausss reductive view. They cannot be settled by any simple appeal to empirical facts (concerning biology or evolutionary psychology, say); yet we do not consider them unanswerable or fit merely for idle philosophical debate. (One also wonders what Krauss would say about mathematical knowledge, which is, on most views, nonempirical.) Krauss, however, digs his heels in, arguing that ethical questions can indeed be settled empirically: Ultimately, I think our understanding of neurobiology and evolutionary biology and psychology will reduce our understanding of morality to some well-defined biological constructs.",2012-09-11T19:24:39+0000

Investigators believe that Mr. Bulot, the former president of Relais et Chteaux, a luxury hotel and restaurant network, embezzled more than $2 billion from the company. In a recorded telephone conversation from 2010, Mr. de Villepin, who was no longer in government, appears to tell Mr. Bulot that he pressured managers at the company to keep the fraud a secret, according to French news media reports. Mr. Bulots lawyer told the newsmagazine Le Nouvel Observateur that his client had embezzled about $640,000, but that Mr. de Villepin had been unaware of it. ",2012-09-12T02:02:54+0000

The 1972 earthquake shattered Managuas once glorious boulevards, and today building styles vary wildly, from the squat residential buildings that popped up after the tremors, to older, more majestic neo-Classical and modern edifices. But despite an initial impression of chaos, you will find smooth roads and a full range of hotels and restaurants serving hearty local fare. The years of political upheaval marked by the 1979 revolution and then the brutal civil war of the 1980s have finally given way to stability. Yet travelers on their way to the coasts or quaint colonial towns still rush away from the capital upon arrival. Thats too bad. There is a blossoming of culture in this city that is the key to understanding modern Nicaragua.",2012-09-13T17:40:02+0000

To replicate the program in New York City, to cover the college tuition of all 52,000 students who graduate from the nations largest school system every year, an endowment of something like $20 billion would be needed, according to Keith Luke, at the Connecticut-based Commonfund, which manages $25 billion in assets for nonprofit institutions. Such an endowment, he says, would provide for annual tuition payments of $5,000 for each student for four years, growing annually at the rate of inflation for higher education. Forbes magazine estimates that 57 billionaires live in the city. Mayor Bloomberg himself has donated more than $2.4 billion to favorite causes, and in 2013 Columbia University will finish a $5 billion fund-raising campaign, bringing in $1 billion more than its initial goal.

The collaboration gives the Met some visibility in the slightly hipper, younger and more contemporary music scene, and adds big-institution luster to Le Poisson Rouge, which has become firmly established as a New York concert site. The Met often collaborates with major institutions like Juilliard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art but rarely with such a small fish. It seemed like a good idea, as a way of educating the audience and reaching out to a new audience, to have performances down there, Peter Gelb, the Mets general manager, said. Mr. Gelb said the first performance, on Oct. 26, would involve a few cast members of The Tempest and Mr. Ads as pianist performing scaled-down numbers from the opera. The concert will include works by Ives, Purcell, Stravinsky and Tippett, with other instrumentalists joining in, a spokesman later added. Mr. Muhly will play and program the second concert in May. Mr. Gelb said the Met was paying for the performances and would split the ticket take with Le Poisson Rouge.",2012-09-13T21:51:38+0000

us,Who Made That Marshmallow?,"A century ago, confectioners made marshmallows from a froth of sugar, starch and gelatin, in a laborious process that involved lots of primping. Each candy had to sweat for several hours to form its delicate skin, and then it was sprinkled with starch. In the 1950s, Alex Doumak  an executive at the Doumak candy company  dreamed up an efficient solution to the problem of the slow marshmallow: he treated the candy goo as an industrial material. Machines forced the marshmallow slurry through tubes, subjected it to blasts of gas at 200 pounds per square inch, extruded it into long tails and then cut it into bite-size chunks. Doumak filled the candy with air, like a tire, trapping nothingness in an architecture of sugar. Extrusion allowed for the marshmallow were used to today  with that springy, fluffy texture, Sue Watson, manager of the company archives at Kraft Foods, says. Kraft began extruding its own marshmallows in the late 1950s, but its most creative touch might have been the space-age name it gave to the factory process  jet-puffed  as if the marshmallows had exploded out of a rocket-ship engine. As part of a 1959 promotion, children sent in empty Kraft marshmallow bags for a chance to own a 29-foot spaceship equipped with astronaut suits, countdown lights and an astro projector for space observation. The modern marshmallow may be mostly air, but its a sweet lesson in less is more.",2012-09-14T14:35:43+0000

Opium dens abound. And a serial killer is on the loose. Known as the head cannibal, he decapitates his victims after murdering them, but the heads are never found. The Metropolitan Police are baffled, as they were by Jack the Ripper, active in 1888, who also desecrated the bodies of his victims. Meanwhile, characters with names like One-Eyed Jack make shady deals in low taverns, and at the dinner tables of the upper classes Darwinian ideas are hotly debated. It feels as if were in the disillusioned twilight of the 19th century, but our narrator  or one of our narrators  sitting in his grandfathers library surrounded by Dickens and Collins, claims that his story is set in 1837, the year Victoria ascended to the throne.",2012-09-14T14:48:26+0000

The lawsuit says the state violated the freedom of speech of a chapter of the Klan in Union County, near the North Carolina border. State transportation officials in June denied the chapters application to clean trash along a stretch of Route 515 in the Appalachian Mountains, saying the program was for only civic-minded organizations in good standing. Debbie Seagraves, the executive director of the A.C.L.U. Foundation of Georgia, said: There will always be speech and groups conveying hateful messages that are distasteful to some. That is why the First Amendment protects free speech for all. The State Transportation Department said it had expected the lawsuit and stood by its decision to deny the application.

Much like his Italian counterpart Maurizio Cattelan, Coffin lives on the absurdist fringe of conceptual art where critics are left wondering whether hes a savant or are they the idiots for taking him seriously. Vowels are fundamental sounds, Coffin explains of A, E, I, O, U, the nonsensical title of his new exhibition, which opens at Venus Over Manhattan on Sept. 21. Just reading the vowels has an effect like mouthing the words to a song without the consonants. The vowels are ethereal and consonants are anchors. Many of his artworks strive for the appearance of self-generation, be it the aforementioned hand that looks as though it was whipped up in a tornado or a dodecahedron made of starfish cast in gold. Coffin is quick to point out that this complex five-sided shape is, according to Euclidean geometry, what Plato believed to be a building block of the cosmos, but then immediately offers another read where the starfish couldve come together the way skydivers do for fun in free fall.",2012-09-19T16:01:00+0000

One of them is this: the development of local arms-producing industries in Syrian cities and the countryside. In a war in which the antigovernment fighters have sought outside support and been disappointed by what has been offered, especially from the West, the society that produced the fighters has also undertaken the production of matriel for guerrilla war, a social project of such a scale that it has contributed to the armed oppositions momentum and confidence this year. The progression is both intriguing and relevant to those seeking to understand the Free Syrian Army, as the loosely organized antigovernment fighters are called. This is not just for the view that local production provides of latter-day warfare with do-it-yourself arms.

The United States claims to be neutral but in effect is siding with Japan, and we could be drawn in if a war ever arose. Let me clear that I deplore the violence in the recent anti-Japan protests in China: the violence is reprehensible and makes China look like an irrational bully. Chinas government should rein in this volatile nationalism rather than feed it. This is a dispute that both sides should refer to the International Court of Justice, rather than allow to boil over in the streets. That said, when I look at the underlying question of who has the best claim, Im sympathetic to Chinas position. I dont think it is 100 percent clear, partly because China seemed to acquiesce to Japanese sovereignty between 1945 and 1970, but on balance I find the evidence for Chinese sovereignty quite compelling. The most interesting evidence is emerging from old Japanese government documents and suggests that Japan in effect stole the islands from China in 1895 as booty of war. This article by Han-Yi Shaw, a scholar from Taiwan, explores those documents. I invite any Japanese scholars to make the contrary legal case.  Nicholas Kristof",2012-09-19T23:38:26+0000

To the right hang three small landscapes, all views of Lake Geneva, distant mountains and skies painted in vivid, Impressionistic colors.

In this moment, McCarthy is no longer a boy prone to worry and fret, but rather a wise young soul who knows to his very bones what it is to be alive, his entire being flooded with the exquisite perception that we are at once profoundly connected to the wide and cluttered world and utterly, inexorably alone in it. If I had to cut out the heart of this book, thats where Id put the knife, on that boy in the snow on that dark night long ago. Its an intimate realization that glimmers with universality and sets us up for the question McCarthy grapples with mightily in the course of this engaging debut: How do we manage to nurture our deepest bonds at the same time that we honor our most necessary solitude?

us,Sept. 23  29,"WHEN abstraction in art was still new and confounding, sophisticates sometimes referred to music as an illuminating comparison.

Musical composers, on the other hand, had a longstanding tradition of evoking mental imagery by sonic means. So it came about in 1928 that VASILY KANDINSKY, the artist often credited for creating the first purely abstract paintings, designed movable sets and changing lighting to accompany a performance of Modest Mussorgskys Pictures at an Exhibition. Presented in Dessau, Germany, the show was a great success.",2012-09-21T15:03:12+0000

Produced in an Italian factory that specializes in accessory parts like belt buckles and shoe heels, the seven bags in the fall collection take their cues from cut gemstones, with sharp lines, reflective surfaces and facets as dizzying as diamonds.

Attending on the first night of Rosh Hashanah, and welcomed as a practicing heterosexual, I noted that the audience had at least two things in common: A belief that religion could and should be an open tent.

While there are plenty of photographs of the firms work, theyre shown in the context of the books 40 collecting topics, each of which has its own file folder page. For example, the page for collecting maps, above, is followed by the photo, top, of a bedroom that is decorated with maps. And since Maloney felt strongly that the book had to have a digital component  It was important that it look like 2012, not 2010, he emphasizes  the topics pages have Digimarc watermarks.

From the size of the rounded pebbles embedded in the slab, the scientists estimated that water was flowing about a yard a second and was between ankle and hip deep. NASA has found bountiful evidence of liquid water on early Mars when it might have been warmer, but this was the first observation of an ancient streambed.

Officials now say those approvals were being handled efficiently enough that the number of partnered operations was returning to normal. Before the order, about 90 percent of all missions were conducted jointly. The number is now climbing again, said officials, who declined to offer specifics. ",2012-09-28T03:39:35+0000

He was detained for 81 days last year, and after his release, Beijing officials said Mr. Ai owed $2.4 million in back taxes and penalties. Mr. Ai paid a bond of $1.3 million to contest the government order. Tax officials are expected to keep the bond, which means Mr. Ai will owe $1.1 million.

Twelve years ago, when Chabons novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay was starting to make some noise (it went on to win a Pulitzer in 2001), newspaper profiles mentioned that the author was wrapping up another project: a television pilot called Telegraph Avenue, about a black family and a white family in Oakland and Berkeley, Calif. How did Chabon get from there to here? When I first considered the possibility of transforming the script into a novel, he said via e-mail, I went through the usual process, apparently requisite to my beginning any novel, of lying to myself about how easy it was going to be. I told myself I would just be able to novelize it. Two and a half years later, battered and discouraged and ready to quit, and ready to kill the optimistic idiot who got me into this mess, I belatedly realized my mistake. A pilot is there to set the table. To set it beautifully, and with a proper and adequate complement of utensils for the coming meal. But in terms of nourishment it only really sets out some canaps, maybe a dish of olives. A novel has to serve a full, seven-course meal with sherbet in the middle and maybe a last little passed tray of petits fours.
