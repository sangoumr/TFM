us,GOING OUT Guide,"ANT ART More than 2 million ants, surely the most grandiose cast in town, are the stars of Army Ants Patterns and Structures, Alan Sonfist's exhibition now running, actually running, around a large rectangular enclosure that fills a first floor room at Automation House, 49 East 68th Street. Mr. Sonfist realizing that ants are not too unlike humans, places food, apple cores mostly, in various parts of the sandcovered enclosure and gets them to shape up in different geometric patterns. The ants are rather better behaved than Man at buffet dining and the effect is possibly esthetic depending upon the beholder, and they are absolutely hypnotic, even when they were visited during an uncreative midday. One watches the sinuous stream of traffic, with almost never a tieup and wonders what makes the insects so orderly. The exhibition ends March 17, by which time the artist says the ants will have selected and stabilized their own patterns rather than the ones designed (and shown in a wall display) by Mr. Sonfist. The viewing is done over a high wall surrounding the enclosure, which is lined with an unscalable plastic to prevent ant leakage The ants, who use their own bodies as building modules, were brought here from Panama and are bigger than our usual picnic ants. The hours for visiting are 9:30 A.M. to 7 P.M., Monday through Friday. Admission is free.",1972-03-01T05:00:00+0000

One moreand perhaps finalroot we seem in danger of losing is our sense of place, and we can ill afford it. For the places we have roots in, as David Brower sees it, and the flavor of their light and sound and feel when things are right in those places, are the wellsprings of our serenity. A place, says the poet Richard Wilbur in his Introduction, is a fusion of human and natural order. We need that fusion. We need it because it is as close as many of us can come to a religion. To be continuous with nature, intimate with it, is immensely reassuring in a world of abstractions and inconceivable distances. As Spengler said, religion is tension between man and the universe that man can love. Our placeS are the bases of that tension, and we need to love them just as much as we need to love each other.

us,' Sometimes a Great Notion':Story of Logging Strike Opens at 22 Theaters Fonda Heads Family in Independence Fight,"""Sometimes a Great Notion,"" Ken Kesey's second novel, adapted by John Gay and directed by Paul Newman, opened at 22 theaters here yesterday, which probably means that it will be in and out of town so quickly that a lot of people who might like to see it won't have the chance.It's not a great film, nor is it what the trade likes to describe as an East Side film, that is, something that exhibits a kind of white-collar starchiness towards the idea of manual labor or sweaty physical efort of any sort.""Sometimes a Great Notion"" is an extremely interesting, if impure (happily impure, I might add) example of a genre of action film that flourished in the 1930's in movies about tuna fishermen, bush pilots, high-wire repairmen and just about any physical pursuit you can think of with the possible exception of tolltaking, which (except on some thruways) lacks the necessary element of danger.As in Howard Hawks's ""Only Angels Have Wings,"" these films are, at their best, considerably less simple-minded than they soundbeing expressions of lives lived almost entirely in terms of rugged, essentially individualistic professionalism.""Sometimes a Great Notion"" is set in the remote lumber country of the Pacific Northwest and has to do with the patriarchal Stamper family, which is continuing to run its small, independent logging operation while the other loggers in the area are frozen by a strike against a huge lumber combine.Like old Henry Stamper (Henry Fonda), who sees the strike as a pinko commie conspiracy and pays no attention to the bitterness of his former logging friends, and his son, Hank (Paul Newman), whose social conscience is the size of a pea; the movie evokes a poetic rather than a political truth in the story of the Stampers nutty efforts to maintain their clearly outdated independence. When they are defeated, it's not the result of political pressure but because fateas in the apolitical action films of the 1930'shas stepped in.Mr. Newman, who took over the direction of the film (which is only his second) after Richard A. Colla left the project early in the filming, has been remarkably successful both in creating vivid, quite complicated characters and in communicating the sense of beautiful idiocy that is the strength of the two older Stampers.As he showed in ""Rachel, Rachel,"" Mr. Newman knows how to direct actors, and he has obtained lovely performances from Mr. Fonda, Michael Sarrazin and Richard Jaeckel (as two of the younger Stampers), as well as from Lee Remick, who plays what old Henry obviously considers to be a second-class citizen, that is, the woman who happens to be married to his son and whose only joy in life is a German yellow canary.Mr. Newman's handling of the logging and action sequences, some of which are as melodramatic as anything I've seen since Edward G. Robinson lost his hand in Hawks's ""Tiger Shark,"" is also surprisingly effective, not because of any contemporary fanciness but because of what looks like a straight-forward confidence in the subject.My only real objection to the film, I think, is a certain impatience with the screenplay, which lumberingly sets up almost a very physical and emotional crisis that can (and, indeed) must erupt before this kind of movie can be said to have decently met its obligations.Quite early, you know full well who must suffer the fatal logging accident, who will prove himself to be a man, and who will emerge from defeat unreconstructed and triumphant, leading a log-pack down river to the amazement of the striking lumbermen on the bank. I have not read this particular Kesey novel, but the final gesture is authentic Keseyian comic-horror: a dismembered arm, which has been kept in a deep freeze, is attached to the tugboat mast, the fingers shaped to form the universal hand signal for defiance.",1972-03-02T05:00:00+0000

us,' Tales From the Crypt':Richardson Plays Host of 5 Related Stories Theme Are Noted for Ancient Plot Devices,"In one of the five vaguely related stories that make up ""Tales From the Crypt,"" a philandering husband dreams that he and his mistress are in a terrible automobile accident, only to awaken to find that  well  you can probably guess.In another story, a very dim spin-off of ""Freaks,"" the inmates at a home for blind old men rebel against the repressive rule of the home's director, a nasty ex-Army major who is inclined to remind them: ""In the kingdom of the blind, even a one-eyed man is king.""In a third story, it is Christmas Eve in a house that looks like a collection of model rooms in a department store. Joan Collins puts her daughter to bed, goes downstairs and splits Daddy's skull with a poker, and then hears over the radio that a homicidal maniac has escaped and is heading her way. With an embarrassing immediacy, a strange face appears at the window. . . .If ""Tales From the Crypt"" had any style whatsoever, the philandering husband's dream would not come true, the blind old men would possibly fail, and we might even find ourselves rooting for old Joan in her extremity, despite her momentary lapse in manners.Unfortunately, the only style exhibited by Freddie Francis, who directed the film, and Milton Subotsky, who wrote it, is in their dumb appreciation for ancient plot devices, and especially in their high-handedness with other people's stories, including ""The Monkey's Paw."" This they steal for one episode in which the characters have the poor taste to keep reminding each other that what's happening is just what happened in the classic W. W. Jacobs story.Four years ago, Mr. Subotsky (as the co-producer) and Mr. Francis collaborated on a similar but much wittier compendium, ""Torture Garden,"" which was written by Robert Bloch and included one of horror fiction's most bizarre inventions, a jealous piano.""Tales From the Crypt"" is not, strictly speaking, a horror film at all, although it has its share of silly supernatural effects. Its people are small and spiteful and their bad ends exhibit the kind of heavy morality I associate less with fine horror fiction than with cautionary literature designed to persuade children to brush their teeth.The cast is familiar but not terribly good. Sir Ralph Richardson, dressed in monk's cloth, acts as the host. He is almost always interesting to watch, even in junk like this. There is no other actor in the English-speaking theater who could pronounce the word ""plans"" and somehow break it up into five syllables.",1972-03-09T05:00:00+0000

Both were made by Les Blank, who previously won acclaim for ""The Blues Accordin' to Lightnin' Hopkins,"" also culled from Texas sources.The two new pictures, showing this weekend and next at the uptown Film Forum, already have been hailed with the first as ""three of the best films on music and its cultural roots ever made by an American,"" and all we can do is second the motion. Mr. Blank is a gifted man, born to the movie camera.There is nothing conventionally pretty or picturesque about either of the new films. Using his camera and sound track like an inquiring eavesdropper, with his subjects speaking to the camera and each other, Mr. Blank simply records their lives and utterances. His camera welds them to their backgrounds. Their music says the rest.""Spend It All"" centers on a group of part-time musicians, happily rooted in Louisiana's Cajun bayous, whose lusty old-time ballads and chanteys memorably evoke their traditions and realistic contentment.Even more impressive is ""A Well Spent Life,"" centering on the 75-year-old blues singer, Mance Lipscomb, who is truly a man of remember. This remarkable old Negro plays his guitar, sings, reviews his life, ambles about his native Texas countryside (an intimate close-up that few Northern whites or blacks know) and somehow, by his very proximity, makes our own lives a little better.",1972-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Georgia, Georgia' Arrives at the Forum","Maya Angelou, the black-author-actress-singer-poet who is making her debut as a screenwriter, along with Diana Sands and the rest of the interracial cast of ""Georgia, Georgia,"" which opened yesterday at the Forum, cannot be faulted for lack of purpose and sincerity.They speak with passionate feeling about the stark state of blacks in a world of terrible misunderstanding and dissension. But their emotions are, sadly enough, too often projected in rhetoric and surface histrionics rather than drama.Miss Sands, in the role of an American pop singing star on a concert tour in Stockholm, is caught up in the genuine ecstacy of a love affair with a white, expatriate American photographer. She is also dependent on but dislikes her militantly black, mother-figure of a maid-companion and her homosexual, black manager. And she is constantly importuned by a group of black G.I. deserters from Vietnam who want her help in enlisting sympathy for them back home.These frighteningly real issues are couched in explicit, with-it dialogue, but they are for the most part merely stated, often stridently, and not resolved. Miss Angelou's unexpected, shocking climactic scene, involving Miss Sands and her companion, appears to be not so much of a resolution of the film or her tortured heroine's problems as simply a melodramatic device.Credit Miss Sands with a finely tuned performance as the troubled entertainer desperately seeking identity in her hectic surroundings. She may be, as one of the principals wrly says, a cool, superior type who has ""just about kicked the habit"" of being black.But she is also the lonely success who, detesting her companion, still needs in private her mammy-like lullabies and ministrations. And she is a woman suddenly and defiantly in love.Dirk Benedict, now on Broadway in ""Butterflies Are Free,"" makes his film debut with a sensitive, restrained performance as a young man in love. Minnie Gentry of Broadway's ""Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death"" is forcefully natural as the officious maid-companion consumed by hatred of whites.Along with other actual black deserters, Terry Whitmore, the G. I. subject of a 1969 documentary about his desertion, gives reality, though not much impact, to the proceedings. And Roger Furman, as the homosexual manager, gives a merely conventional performance.Stig Bjorkman, the film's young Swedish director, has competently kept the story and cast moving briskly against the colorful background of Stockholm, where the film was shot. But the basic, essentially important source material provided by Miss Angelou is too often simplistic and only occasionally memorable.",1972-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Talent Festival,"""New Directors/New Films"" is the omnibus title for the very interesting film series currently being shown at the Museum of Modern Art under the joint sponsorship of the museum and the Lincoln Center Film Society.With perhaps remarkable restraint, the members of the selection committee (Richard Roud, for the film society, and Willard Van Dyke, Donald Richie and Adrienne Mancia, for the museum) have imposed no arbitrary theme on the festival. Each of the 10 selections simply represents either the first or second feature by a promising new director not yet known in this country.On the basis of the quality and intensity (if not always the complete success) of the festival's first five film's, which I saw this week, it's particularly disappointing to learn that the seriesending Monday nightis attracting something less than capacity audiences.The show is the first major collaboration of New York's two most imposing film establishments since the ""American Voices"" series, which they presented in conjunction with the 8th New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center in 1970. More importantly, the show is providing some talented young filmmakers with the kind of unhurried presentation not possible at a more or less conventional festival, where the Buuels, the Bergmans, the Godards and the Olmis occupy the attention (with, I should add, some justification).Following the lead of the selection committee, I won't attempt to impose a theme on my report on the first half of the festival. The order in which the films are discussed is the chronological order in which they were seen:""Dear Irene"" is the first feature by two young Danish film critics, Ch. Braad Thomsen, who directed the film and wrote the screenplay with Mette Knudsen, who plays the title role. Irene pretends to be politically concerned but she's actually bored with everythingher husband, her lover and her job.For a film about boredom, ""Dear Irene"" is remarkably humane and unmannered and, finally, very touching as Irene finds herself literally cornered, in a freeze frame, a likely recruit to the ranks of the alienated strangers whom she encounters, talking to themselves, in an anything but gay Copenhagen. Mr. Thomsen's techniques are not new, but the emotions are always genuine.""The Role of My Family in the World Revolution,"" the second feature by Bata Cengic, is another chaotic Marxist political comedy from Yugoslavia, the country that gave us Makavejev's ""WRThe Mysteries of the Organism"" for no great gain. The movie utilizes slapstick comedy techniques, songs, sketches (Adolf and Eva Hitler spending an evening at home with TV) and a number of eccentric actors to pass on what seems to me to be an especially mysterious kind of cynicism (perhaps because I'm not Yugoslav).""The Truce"" (French), the first feature to be directed by Claude Guillemot, is a long, gentle gag film about two Parisian con artists, rivals at their trade, who, with their doxies, spend a very funny weekend in the country, which is, of course, alien ground. One of them likes to fish, not with a pole but with hand grenades; the other by electrifying the waters. Nicely acted by Daniel Gelin and Charles Denner, and very very mild.""Dot Dot Dot"" (meaning "". . ."" for the ellipses used in writing) is the first feature by Edgardo Cozarinsky, a young Argentine whose program notes for the film are much more eloquent than the film itself. From the notes I learn that the film is about a priest who has been defrocked because his views are too right-wing even for the church. (I wouldn't have known otherwise.) The style of the film is nothing if not elliptical, but its comments on the Argentine church and on the bourgeoisie are sometimes quite funny.""The Anxiety of the Goalie at the Penalty Kick"" is the second feature by Wim Wenders, a young German director. Based on a novel to be published here next month by Peter Handke, the film is the most ambitious and most successful of the museum series so far, a beautifully acted and photographed tale of existential alienation, set in a world that is all the more terrifying because it is so familiar. It will deserve further comment when, as I hope, it finds a commercial release here.",1972-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Impact of New Directors Series:Works of 5 Countries Shown at Museum Self-Discovery Theme Found in Each Piece,"The second five programs in the New Directors/New Films series just completed at the Museum of Modern Art offered movies from Switzerland, Hungary, Cuba, England and the United States. They are all first or second features by youngish directors generally unknown here, and, taken all together, they constitute the loveliest body of new cinema work that I have seen in some years. Taken individually, there are distinctions to be made, and I have my favoritesthe Swiss ""Salamander"" and the Cuban ""Memories of Underdevelopment,"" both already acquired for United States distributionand my least favorite alsothe Hungarian ""Horizon.""Pal Gabor's ""Horizon"" is a sensitive, slightly too artful study of a Budapest teenager who skips his school examination, quits his job, and takes off in a few directions that his mother, whom he loves, and the girl who loves him can't follow. He ends up with a factory job as dumb as the office job he's just left, but along the way he had had a few adventures and made some starts in the very crucial process of self-discovery.To a considerable degree, self-discovery is what ""Horizon"" is about. It is also what all the other four films are about, and it constitutes a theme, for at least this part of the series, of quite astonishing consistency.This search for a sense of oneself is not simply a preoccupation of the young. The hero of Tomas Guterrez Alea's ""Memories of Underdevelopment"" is 38 years old, and he is the most boyishly lost of the lot. But the search is a highly individualized activity (consider even the title of Barney Platts-Mills's ""Private Road,"" in which the identity crisis grows out of a love affair that fails between two attractive upper-middle class English kids) and one that presupposes the value, the ultimate legitimacy of personal perceptions.Sometimes such priority of values seems hard won, as in David Schikele's fine ""Bushman."" Mr. Schikele's film, an unusual blend of documentary and fictional vignettes, deals with a Nigerian (Paul Eyam Nzie Okpokam) teaching at San Francisco State, who in fact, and in the middle of production, was deported by the Government for the alleged possession of a bomb. The movie ends with the deportation, but despite all provocation its mood is relaxed, tolerantly ironic, sophisticatedwith a delight in subtle complexities that seems, in its lack of stridency, post-revolutionary.Even more complex, and distinctly more post-revolutionary, Mr. Alea's ""Memories of Underdevelopment"" begins as its bourgeois hero contentedly sends his wife into Stateside exile and settles back in his Havana apartment to wait for whatever will come next. A lot comes, much of it very funny, and none of it the triumph of ideology you might have expected. Mr. Alea's model is early-to-middle Antonioni, but he is dealing with real rather than mythic history, and unlike Antonioni, all his perceptions are touched by wit.Alain Tanner's ""Salamander"" acknowledges its debts more directly, as its heroes, a pair of writers named Pierre and Paul (of course, after Truffaut's ""Jules and Jim"") develop a story based on the life of a shop girl named Rosemond, who may or may not have shot her uncle in the shoulder. They meet Rosemond (Bulle Ogier), are both seduced by her, and ultimately drop the story, find themselves, and lose the girl into a kind of mild insanitywhich is her freedom in this rich, tough, technically modest and marvelously alert new film.",1972-03-15T05:00:00+0000

Jefferson's successors continued the favors. Later, when Big Men in Congress became more powerful than Presidents, subsequent editors Joseph Gales Jr. and W. W. Seaton played ball with them. With the passing years, Gales and Seaton clung to their nationalism but swung from liberalism to conservatism; and the Civil War, the coming of industrial America and the hardening of G & S's arteries caused the paper to expire in 1865. The sheet was attractive, well written and genuinely informed about what was happening on the Potomac.

Are we dealing with something which matters, or which only seems to matter? Do we have here one more of those items of sociological entertainment which the educated classes invent and consume so relentlessly? Will Kate Millet and Germaine Greer go the way of Charles Reich and Timothy Leary, whom you may or may not remember; or do we indeed see the beginnings of something which will change our lives profoundly?

us,Film: Time-Tripping With 'Slaughterhouse-Five',"""Slaughterhouse-Five,"" George Roy Hill's screen version of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s novel, is a wild, noisy, sometimes very funny film that eventually becomes as unstuck in its own exuberance as its hero, Billy Pilgrim, the Illium, N. Y., optometrist, is unstuck in time.The things one remembers most vividly about the movie, which opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater, are its marvelous subsidiary characters and its affection for middle Americans of immense vulgarity and pride. When Billy's overweight wife tries to squeeze into her birthday present, a brand-new white Cadillac, she whines: ""It's a little tight."" When Billy congratulates Derby, his sweet-tempered, over-age Army buddy, on his way with words, Derby answers: ""We didn't mince phraseologies at Boston Trades and Industrial.""""Slaughterhouse-Five,"" however, is not about Valencia or Derby or the absolutely stunning Hollywood starlet, Montana Wildhack, with whom Billy winds up spending the rest of eternity on the planet Tralfamadore. It's about the epic travail of Billy himself, through marriage, childhood, nervous breakdown, death and war (sometimes in that order, sometimes not). Billy time-trips from past to future and back again, thereby attaining the kind of serenity that could look like madness only to the people who find Vonnegut too deep for their tasteswhich would include most of the characters Billy meets in life.Billy Pilgrim, very nicely played by a new young actor named Michael Sacks, who looks like a cartoon fall-guy copied in flesh, is Everyman and, like most Everymen, he becomes a bit tiresome, since he never is allowed to express his own outrage with the human condition. Billy simply endures, a passive figure set against a background in which the author inventories man's idiocies to man, from the little deceptions of childhood to the legalized lunacies of war.I thus have certain reservations about the point of the filmI mean I hate war too and I'm not sure that this sort of work does much more than increase our smug satisfaction with our own high-mindedness. Mr. Vonnegut, however, could not survive on high-mindedness alone, and Mr. Hill's achievement in ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" is in transferring to film, in a way that was lacking in ""Happy Birthday, Wanda June,"" the author's ebullient senses of humor and chaos.Second to ""The Godfather,"" ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" is probably the most perfectly cast film in months, mostly with actors who have had little previous film experience, with the exception of Ron Liebman, so good in ""Where's Poppa,"" who plays Billy's paranoid Army friend. They are all fine, out special mention must be made of Valerie Perrine as Billy's Hollywood starlet, Eugene Roche as Derby, and Sharon Gans as Billy's nice dumbbell of a wife.The problem with the film, as it was with the novel, is that it's really not outraged or outrageous enough, much like its time-tripping gimmick. Not only do all movies time-trip, since all time in movies (including flashbacks) is a type of present, but so also do we, a dozen times a day, slip from the past into the future, and sometimes sideways, into visions of present moments, not as they really are but as they might be.",1972-03-23T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:Concert for Bangladesh Now a Documentary,"On Aug. 1, 1971, Ravi Shankar, along with George Harrison, Leon Russell, Billy Preston, Bob Dylan and several other notable performers of rock music gave a concert at Madison Square Garden to raise money for the suffering people of Bangladesh. The concert was very popular, and in general a critical success, and, in the language of public relations, a historic occasion. In time it was followed by a record album, which was followed by a charge of financial finagling, which was followed by a libel suit, which has been followed by much journalism, which is followed at last  almost eight months after the eventby a movie, ""The Concert for Bangladesh."" It opened yesterday at the DeMille.It is a very good movie as such movies go (and they often go quite badly), and friends who were at the concert tell me that it is a faithful reproduction of the original. This may not sound like much for a documentary filmed on the spot. But anyone who has seen many rock-concert movies will appreciate that in this one there are no unnecessary zooms, no lab-created light shows, almost no exploitation of the on-screen audience, no insistence that a concert of music is somehow a social revolution.Indeed, ""The Concert for Bangladesh"" exhibits less technical nervousness in the face of musical performance than any other remotely similar film I can think of. And because it is so little bothered with what it must do next, say, to turn song into cinema, it probably succeeds in moving with its people more closely, and surely differently, than the audience at Madison Square Garden could have done.There are vocal solos mostly by George Harrison, Leon Russell and Bob Dylan, but also by Ringo Starr and the remarkable Billy Preston, and there are sitar and sarod duets by Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Kahn. Saul Swimmer directed, and Dylan and Harrison apparently helped in editing the work of eight cameramenand I think they all deserve credit for the simplicity with which the film cuts between long shot and medium shot and often very tight close-ups, and leaves dramatic intensity to the music and the musicians, where it belongs.The worst thing in ""The Concert for Bangladesh"" is the sound, which is of course very loud, but neither rich nor full. Somebody had the notion of recording the audience (or an audience) response to each number and producing it from the rear of the theater as a kind of canned aid to enthusiasm. This has nothing to do with the spirit or the look of the film, and, given the reticence and intelligence of everything else, it functions essentially as promotional nonsense, a six-track stereophonic insult.",1972-03-24T05:00:00+0000

us,'Inn of Evil':Moody Japanese Film Arrives at Bijou,"Masachi Kobayshi, the director whose dedication to the stylistically structured, mood-filled Japanese period piece has been distinctively illustrated previously in such features as ""Hara-Kiri,"" ""Kwaidan,"" and ""Rebellion,"" is a good deal more moody and remote in ""Inn of Evil,"" which opened yesterday at the Bijou. His somber saga of smugglers battling against sociological and psychological odds, as well as lawmen of the dim Nipponese past, demands a good deal of dedication by Occidental viewers unschooled in the background history the film does not indicate.A moviegoer unaware that smuggling was a surreptitious way of life long ago when foreign trade was prohibited is left with a nagging mystery. But the director's handling of his varied principals, working under the protection of a mysterious lord on their island inn sanctuary and grapping ineffectively with personal problems, is deft and incisive. And his points of view, slowly but meticulously presented, have a cumulative impact.This is, of course, slowly paced, often introspective, drama, interspersed by stabbings and swordplay. The beleaguered cast is often awash in the suds of soap opera but their serious, if postured, portrayals, as well as English subtitles, make it plain that this is not simply a vintage cops-and-robbers affair.The smugglers, their dour, but compassionate chief, his pretty, lovelorn daughter, a young man desperate to free his fiance from a brothel and a drunk lamenting the loss of his family, make for a convoluted tale. But they emerge as a varied, driven but unselfish lot who readily risk their lives in a final, bloody good deed.They are primitive but genuinely troubled types. And Mr. Kobayashi and the fine black-and-white photography that captures the essence of the gloom-filled script, largely succeed in illuminating their dark, forbidding enclave and the predicaments they only vaguely comprehend.",1972-03-25T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:Breezy James Coburn in 'Carey Treatment',"Blake Edwards's ""The Carey Treatment,"" which opened here yesterday, is an absurdly entertaining movie about a medical pathologist named Peter Carey (James Coburn), the sort of rugged, left-wing individualist who makes $45,-000 a year, spends a good deal of it on a set decorator's dream of a Boston duplex, drives a station wagon a block long and affects the kind of slash-pocket, casual clothes worn mostly by male models for Esquire as they horse around, without damaging the creases.At one point in the film, which pretends to be concerned with his hunt for the person who performed a fatal abortion on the hospital administrator's daughter, Peter is described as a dissident professor who, like disloyal soldiers and renegade priests, is bent on destroying the Establishment. However, I don't think we have to take this too seriously,, for ""The Carey Treatment,"" like so many respectable private-eye movies, is sustained almost entirely by irrelevancies.Because Mr. Edwards (""Gunn,"" ""A Shot in the Dark"") and, apparently, his script writer, James P. Bonner, have a good deal of humor, these irrelevancies become the movie's purpose, or, at least, the reason for seeing it if you don't quite feel up to, say, ""The Sorrow and the Pity.""Almost every red herring that Peter pursues, and every blind alley in which he finds himself trapped, has its comic point, if only a line like the one spoken by a blackmailing photographer the moment Peter is about to beat him up. ""Please,"" he whines, ""I just had a hernia operation.""Under these circumstances it's probably not surprising that the film's most irrelevant character, someone who has absolutely nothing to do with anything, is also most endearingthe hospital's dietitian played by Jennifer O'Neill, who is possibly the most beautiful woman in American movies this week. She never does get fully worked into the plot except as the girl with whom Peter sleeps, more or less because when he first meets her she smells so good. (""It's the vanilla,"" she explains. ""I spilled it down the inside of my dress trying to give some taste to the egg pudding."")Under these circumstances, too, it probably makes no difference that Coburn is one of those actors whomnever for a minutedo you mistake as anything but an actor having a rather breezy time of it, even when he gets run down by an automobile in a telephone booth and survives with the loss of only his spleen, an organ that is, according to 'The Carey Treatment,"" cheerfully expendable.Just about everyone in the film seems to be having a certain amount of fun, including Elizabeth Alien, as the hospital administrator's self-described shanty-Irish wife (""I belong to the club now""): Pat Hingle, as a detective captain; Alex Drier, as a society doctor and leading suspect, and James Hong, the doctor originally charged with the fatal abortion, principally, it seems, because he is Chinese.Mr. Edwards, I understand, was so distressed with the way Metro treated his movie that he once tried to have his name taken off it. Why, I can't imagine, unless it was the producer, or some other Metro flunky who forced him to use a few more Boston locations than were absolutely necessary, and to cast all the men in such a way that leads one to suspect they all have their hair done at the same salon.Otherwise ""The Carey Treatment"" looks to be exactly what might have been intended by a talented director with reasonably venal ambitions to amuse a great many people.",1972-03-30T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Cool Breeze':Heist Planned to Fund Black People's Bank,"From M-G-M, the company that gave you ""Gone With the Wind,"" there now comes ""Cool Breeze,"" a mostly black remake of ""The Asphalt Jungle""also given you by M-G-M. Actually, the quality of blackness is somewhat strained, embracing as it does much of the cast, and most of the attitudes, and virtually all the ad campaign but none of the major technical credits, including Gene Corman as producer and Barry Pollack, who directed and wrote the screenplay.I assume by now that most moviegoers have seen ""The Asphalt Jungle"" and remember the story of the brilliantly planned jewel theft that gradually, inexorably comes undone through the character quirks and frailties of the men who execute it. In ""Cool Breeze"" the story remains roughly the same, set this time in Los Angeles though the motives have been made pseudo-altruistic (to fund a black-people's bank) and the conclusion has been made defiantly inconclusive, leaving the underworld mastermind, Sidney Lord Jones (Thalmus Rasulala), wholly in possession of his icy millions in diamonds and his warm taste for sexy young girls.""Cool Breeze"" has rather a lot to say about sexy young girls, and about sex generally (much of it fairly brutal), and about whatever matters of practical philosophy happen to pass through the minds of its characters. For an action movie it is curiously short on action (the actual heist seems a perfunctory afterthought) and long on characterand it clearly intends more to reflect on a quality of life than to develop the consequences of any specific course of conduct.I don't mean that it's a reflective movie. Rather, it is a movie in which everybody bellyaches or shows off or talks about what it means to be what he is. Everyone plays a role, which is nothing new, but everyone also knows he is playing a role, and so ""Cool Breeze"" tends to function as a kind of serious genre parodynot unlikely for a black man's movie in a white man's world.But ""Cool Breeze"" really has nowhere to take its observations, since it is neither militant nor pacifist, but only, sporadically, ironic. And the film seems at each moment to be diminished below its potential even when it attempts strong bravado. Pollack directs some sequences very well, but he seems unsure of what matters dramatically and what doesn't, and he is unevenly served by his cast. The cast is only good in its sadness, and especially with Raymond St Jacques as Mercer, the high-powered fence (the Louis Calhern role in ""The Asphalt Jungle"") who loses everything except an understanding that the best use of the substance of life is to support a style.",1972-03-30T05:00:00+0000
