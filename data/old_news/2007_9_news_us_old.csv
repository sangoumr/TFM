Nadal was playing on sore knees, but so was his Serbian opponent. Especially after losing a second-set lead and ultimately the set, the 56th-ranked Tipsarevic indeed was in worst shape than Nadal and took a medical break to get his right side taped (giving the TV audience to see the tattoo on his back, which goes with the tattoos on his arms, and dont forget the piercing under his lips).",2007-09-01T03:31:28+0000

Ms. Ross, who was respected for her leadership of Good Morning America in the 1990s, will become the latest executive to try to make the CBS program competitive with Good Morning America and NBCs Today show. The Early Show is currently run by Michael Bass, its senior executive producer, and Steve Friedman, the vice president of morning broadcasts. The future of both men is unclear, the executive briefed on the plans said, but added that the network was hoping to retain them at CBS News. Ms. Ross will most likely overhaul the show, which will change its format in January when CBS ends a deal that allowed some affiliates to use only portions of the first hour of The Early Show, supplementing them with local news.

Its not known how many stations will air the edited version of The War, which begins on Sept. 23. Stations that broadcast obscene words between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. risk fines if viewers complain. F.C.C. policy is not to decide in advance on possible indecency, but the commission had previously ruled that obscenity in Steven Spielbergs film Saving Private Ryan was not indecent, given the World War II context. All the lawyers PBS consulted agreed that the unedited version was legally defensible in light of the Ryan decision, said John Boland, chief content officer of PBS. But after months of debate, he said, PBS decided also to offer the edited version because many stations plan to rerun episodes during the day on weekends, when children could be watching. Caroline Fredrickson, director of the Washington Legislative Office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement that the PBS decision clearly settles any question about the chilling effect of the F.C.C.s vague and contradictory indecency regime, adding that broadcasters should not have to guess if a work is indecent.",2007-09-01T04:00:00+0000

SEUSS AND JIMI HENDRIX: Denis Johnson, whose story collection Jesus Son was voted one of the most important works of fiction of the last 25 years in the Book Reviews 2006 poll of writers and critics, has never placed a book on the Times best-seller list. But hes been on the radar screen here since his first book, a collection of poems called The Incognito Lounge, was released in 1982. Alan Williamson reviewed it in the Book Review, along with two other books of poems, and he presciently wrote: He is the only one who convinces me that he suffers over the anomie he describes. He is hard on himself, as well as on the culture; and he is agonizingly aware that life can be, and has been, different from the life around him. Pain can make his work excessively and awkwardly rhetorical, but he knows how to use his eyes. In 1984, the Book Review asked Johnson about his influences. Heres part of his excellent response: My ear for the diction and rhythms of poetry was trained by  in chronological order  Dr. Seuss, Dylan Thomas, Walt Whitman, the guitar solos of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix, and T. S. Eliot. Other influences come and go, but those I admire the most and those I admired the earliest (I still admire them) have something to say in every line I write. I dont like William Faulkner.

Fahey, a professor of animal and nutritional sciences, could open a spout by hand, fill a bag with whatever happened to ooze out and calculate how much the dog had digested before whatever it had not digested could move farther through its body. The plastic tubing was inserted in the ileum  the exact spot where food absorption ends and fermentation by the microflora and bacteria of the lower bowel begins. Given a large enough sample of any dog food, George Fahey could calculate how much vitamin or mineral or fat or sugar would enter a dogs bloodstream and how much would be irretrievably lost.

Wilson is not the only one who has had a Marc Chagall print on his dorm-room wall  only to discover later that sophisticated people look down on the artist. Most of us have moved on. Luckily, Wilson has not. Critics say Chagall (1887-1985) is near kitsch, and in his lovely, wise book, Wilson often agrees: he refers to the Fiddler on the Roof Chagall because that Broadway musicals title alludes to one of his 1920 wall panels for a Yiddish theater. Apparently, sentimentality ran in the family: on Yom Kippur, Chagalls father wrote an instructional Weep in his wifes prayer book next to certain passages. As Wilson explains, Chagall, too, sometimes made an appeal for a ritualized lachrymose response, at least in his lesser work. There are other problems: Chagall frequently, almost obsessively, chooses Christ as his central symbol of martyrdom  even in depictions of Jewish history and the Holocaust. Moreover, Chagalls behavior was at times a disgrace, as his daughter put it, expressing frustration over his refusal to provide prints for a 1970 International Rescue Committee exhibit at the request of Varian Fry, who had saved Chagall and more than 1,500 other Jews in Nazi-dominated Europe. Nevertheless, Wilson, the author of A Palestine Affair and other books, depicts Chagall as a luftmensch  not in the words metaphorical sense (an individual overly involved in intellectual pursuits) but in its literal one: man of the air. His paintings of adoring couples, valentines to his wife, Bella, levitate above Fiddler ooze, Jesus portraits and personal shortcomings and are rightly adored by crowds of young lovers and those yearning for love, who have taken to them as lasting images of romantic persistence in the face of a world gone mad.

Although he concedes that within our own tradition this kind of internal reformation was once possible, he believes that today it is not. Instead, we must rely entirely on our own lucidity, since religiously inspired hopes for a better world almost always generate violence. But the evidence from the French revolutionary terror to Hiroshima and the Gulag indicates that lucidity (reason?) can be at least as lethal a basis for political life; whereas biblically informed prophets like Bishop Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. can still inspire healthy, nonviolent change. The real challenge of Islam to Western intellectual discourse is for us to ask ourselves whether our unprecedented modern experiment of conducting political life with no transcendent values is really working out as well as once hoped, and if it is not, how can we draw on our own traditions, as we hope the Muslims draw on theirs, to craft a viable way to live together?",2007-09-02T04:00:00+0000

us,The Revelator,"Good morning and please listen to me: Denis Johnson is a true American artist, and Tree of Smoke is a tremendous book, a strange entertainment, very long but very fast, a great whirly ride that starts out sad and gets sadder and sadder, loops unpredictably out and around, and then lurches down so suddenly at the very end that it will make your stomach flop. It comes with the armor and accoutrements of a Major Novel: big historical theme (Vietnam), semi-mythical cultural institution (military intelligence), long time span (1963-70, with a coda set in 1983) and unreasonable length (614 pages), all of which would be off-putting if this were not, in fact, a major novel, and if Johnsons last big book hadnt been the small collection of eccentric and addictive short stories called Jesus Son (1992). Tree of Smoke is a soulful book, even a numinous one (its dedicated Again for H.P. and Ill bet you a bundle that stands for higher power), and it ought to secure Johnsons status as a revelator for this still new century  a prediction I voice confidently but reluctantly, and with a little disappointment and dismay.",2007-09-02T04:00:00+0000

Despite that fresh green name worthy of some rural retreat, Ramalhete was a large stern house of sober walls, with a line of narrow wrought-iron balconies on the second floor, and, above that, a row of timid little windows sheltering under the eaves, a house which, as befitted a building dating from the reign of Queen Maria I, had the gloomy appearance of an ecclesiastical residence, and indeed, to complete its resemblance to a Jesuit college, it needed only a bell and a cross. The name, Ramalhete, doubtless came from the square panel of decorative tiles placed in the spot intended for a coat of arms that had never materialised, and which depicted a large bunch of sunflowers tied with a ribbon on which one could still just make out the letters and numbers of a date.

us,Havel Withdraws Playfrom Czech Theater," Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president, has withdrawn his eagerly anticipated new drama from the National Theater in Prague after it refused to allow his wife to play the leading role, The Guardian of London reported. Mr. Havel, right, 70, who retired from the presidency four years ago, maintains that he wrote the play, Odchazeni (Leaving), for his wife, Dagmar Havlova, and said that if she could not star in it, he would take it to another theater. The play deals with the problems of a former high-ranking politician in surrendering the trappings of power. Although Mr. Havels stance has led to accusations that he is being highhanded, he said that he had promised his wife for years that they would collaborate onstage and that she inspired him to write the play. She was present when I was writing it in the U.S. some months ago, he said. Referring to the presidency, he said: She lived alongside me. I wrote it for her. I imagined her being in it. Ms. Havlova, who called the dispute undignified and embarrassing, has independently announced her withdrawal from the production. The National Theater said its policy is not to allow guest actors. The theaters director, Ondrej Cerny, said, The National Theater would still like to perform the newest Vaclav Havel drama, and we will try to open new talks.",2007-09-03T04:00:00+0000

It means more workers and pattern makers in his sample room. It means having access to great fabrics and embroideries again. Two looks for his spring collection caught my eye: a sweet shirt dress in burnt orange silk with a kimono-like neckline and a short flaring skirt, and a slim gray pantsuit with a narrow-shoulder jacket that had a coy double effect at the hem. The shapes were new, the fit perfect. Oh, what a difference a little money makes. I know expectations are high for his show (on Sept. 9), and in reality we probably wont see the full weight of the Liz deal for at least another six months, but Rodriguez is certainly in a better position today.",2007-09-04T14:52:19+0000

us,2 More Candles for a Firefighter Memorial,"At the Firemen's Memorial, candles for Firefighters Joseph Graffagnino and Robert Beddia, who died on Aug. 18. (Photo: David W. Dunlap/The New York Times) More PhotographsTwo new candles burn at the foot of the Firemen's Memorial in Riverside Park on its 94th anniversary today. They honor Firefighter Joseph Graffagnino of Ladder Company 5 and Firefighter Robert Beddia of Engine Company 24, who were killed Aug. 18 at the former Deutsche Bank building opposite ground zero.  ""New York is adorned with monuments to soldiers and statesmen, and it should have a monument to typify the splendid heroism of this department,"" said Henry C. Potter, the Episcopal bishop of New York, at the funeral of Deputy Fire Chief Charles W. Kruger in February 1908.  This will sound familiar: it took five years to get the memorial built.  There were money problems, of course.  Then there were bitter fights over its location. Union Square was first proposed, but the Fire Department did not want its solemn monument anywhere near that gathering spot for agitators and demonstrations.  There was also a debate over the design, by the architect Harold Van Buren Magonigle and the sculptor Attilio Piccirilli, who also collaborated on the Maine Monument at Columbus Circle. (Piccirilli's mother-and-child groupings at both monuments bear a striking resemblance.)  To complicate matters further, Bishop Potter, the original head of the memorial committee, died five months after Chief Kruger's funeral. He was succeeded by Isidor Straus, who perished aboard the Titanic in 1912.  But finally, on Sept. 5, 1913, the Firemen's Memorial was dedicated at the foot of 100th Street. Four girls whose fathers had died in the line of duty unveiled the imposing marble structure, with sculptures at either end and a bas relief in its center, above a spout filling a broad basin with life-saving water.  At the time the memorial was dedicated, the Fire Department had lost 154 men in its entire history. Since then, 983 more firefighters have been killed on the job -- more than one-third of those on 9/11 alone.  Memorial inscriptions can sometimes be a bit bombastic, but there is no quarreling with the notion expressed here that firefighters are ""soldiers in a war that never ends.""  All you have to do is spend a moment with those two new candles. ",2007-09-05T15:38:34+0000

But someone who had been told of the hiring but would speak only on condition of anonymity so as not to be seen as pre-empting the announcement, said she is Sherri Shepherd. Ms. Shepherd, 40, is a comedian and comic actress perhaps most recognizable to television viewers for her recurring role as Judy, a police officer, on Everybody Loves Raymond. She has served as a guest host on The View several times and is replacing Star Jones, who was effectively fired from the show in spring 2006. Her addition, like that of Ms. Goldberg, is intended to give a measure of stability to the show, which lost Rosie ODonnell last spring and will lose another panelist, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, albeit temporarily, to a maternity leave that is to begin later this year.

Other environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, have endorsed an agreement on the project announced yesterday by Gov. Eliot Spitzer. Under the plan, the developer, Dean Gitter, agreed to sell more than 1,200 acres of land he owns in the Catskills to the state to become part of the forest preserve. A scaled-down development would then be concentrated on 620 acres that Mr. Gitter owns next to the state-run Belleayre Mountain Ski Center. Carolyn Zolas, the chairwoman of the watershed committee of the Sierra Clubs Atlantic chapter, said the project was still far too big for such a sensitive area and could end up sending contaminated runoff into the reservoirs.

The corpse of Dariusz Janiszewski showed signs of starvation and torture; his hands were bound behind his back, and a noose circled his neck. The case had baffled investigators for five years, until a tip led them to Mr. Balas 2003 debut novel, Amok, which contained similarities to the crime that raised police suspicion. In its decision a court in Wroclaw, Poland, ruled that Mr. Bala, 34, planned and directed the killing but found that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of carrying out the murder himself. Judge Lidia Hojenska said significant circumstantial evidence led the court to conclude that Mr. Bala had been driven to kill Mr. Janiszewski, the owner of a small advertising agency, because he suspected him of having an affair with his estranged wife. Mr. Bala sat stone-faced between two policemen as the verdict was read. His family and lawyer said they planned an appeal. The court noted one difference between Mr. Balas fiction and the actual killing. In Amok, the narrator got away with the murder.",2007-09-06T04:00:00+0000

Fittingly, this husband-and-wife team saw the solution in marriage: Ms. Cruzs 41-year union with Pedro Knight, a trumpeter who almost always accompanied her onstage. They met on the day she auditioned for the same band he was in, said Ms. Rivera, whose work includes La Gringa, coming to Repertorio Espaol in the fall. ",2007-09-07T04:00:00+0000

The clinic has examined more than 15,000 workers and volunteers and overseen the examination of 5,000 more at clinics elsewhere; received more than $100 million from the federal government for tracking and treating those workers; published the largest and most often quoted study of recovery workers ills; and testified about the health problems before city and federal committees.But as a front-page investigation by Anthony DePalma and Serge F. Kovaleski shows, the clinics performance in several important areas has been flawed. For years after 9/11, it did not have adequate resources or time to properly collect detailed medical data on workers exposed to ground zero dust. The clinics doctors presented their findings in what other experts say were scientifically questionable ways, exaggerating the health effects with imprecise descriptions of workers symptoms and how long they might be sick.

us,A Seedy Landmark Goes Dark,"Until just a few weeks ago, the World Trade Center continued to glow at night on the facade of the Playpen cinema. (Photo: David W. Dunlap/The New York Times) More PhotographsThe homogenization of the Times Square area (yes, The Times has contributed to the phenomenon with its new headquarters opposite the Port Authority Bus Terminal) has claimed another quirky victim: the Playpen, a former cinema that closed recently after 90-odd years.  Very odd years.  The Playpen is part of a larger parcel at the southwest corner of Eighth Avenue and 44th Street that is owned by a partnership including affiliates of the Tishman Realty Corporation. The partners have not gone public with their plans. They may not even have decided yet among themselves. But the future certainly does not include the old theater.  What Eighth Avenue will lose with its disappearance is more than an adults-only emporium with suggestive neon come-ons -- ""Live Girls,"" ""Preview Booths,"" ""Leather & Lace."" It will lose the last home of the Funny Store, an almost vaudevillian novelty shop. It will lose one of the most distinctive faades of any surviving theater from the early 20th century, a kind of heroic Palladian composition. And will lose a three-dimensional history lesson in the evolution of Times Square.  The Ideal Theater, designed by Eisendrath & Horwitz, opened in 1916 as a modest movie house, with 598 seats. It attracted some notice in 1935 for showing an Italian-language movie, ""Dopo una Notte d'Amore"" (""After a Night of Love""). Briefly known as the Esquire, it stayed in business until early 1937. It reopened a few months later as the Squire. In 1939, it was renamed the Cinecitta and played Italian films for a while.  Once again the Squire in 1941, it showed ""The Eternal Gift,"" said to be the first feature-length depiction of the Roman Catholic high mass, and the documentary, ""Greece on the March.""  Such serious fare had disappeared by 1946, when ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors"" topped the bill. During a tense moment on screen one evening, a 10-by-20-foot section of the theater's ceiling fell down, injuring 19 patrons. Those in the front seats were unruffled, thinking they were hearing weird sound effects. By the 1950s, ""girlie"" films were drawing customers to the Squire.  The theater's next transformation occurred in 1956, when it reopened as the New Cameo, a theater devoted to Russian films, beginning with the Mosfilm production of ""Boris Godunov,"" starring Alexander Pirogov. ""A casual observer must shudder at the thought of the terrible shock and dismay of a former Squire patron who might wander into the theater looking wistfully for Rose La Rose or Lili St. Cyr,"" wrote Bosley Crowther, who was then The Times's movie critic.  Eventually, the theater became simply the Cameo. This was its most fitting name since the central arch is flanked sculptural cameos, showing women in diaphanous robes, one with a spool of movie film and the other with a camera. The Cameo was the showcase in 1970 for the blue movie, ""Sexual Freedom in Denmark.""  Blue gave way to X over time, and then the ""Cameo"" on the marquee gave way to the Adonis, when that gay movie theater was pushed out of its home six blocks north on Eighth Avenue. The new Adonis was closed by the city's Department of Health in 1994 after inspectors observed what they called ""high-risk sexual activities"" taking place among patrons, without ""any attempts to monitor or control them.""  Lately, the theater was the Playpen, whose marquee loosely traced the New York skyline in red neon. It included the twin towers of the World Trade Center, which still stood and still glowed at night in their uptown incarnation. And yes, Eighth Avenue is losing those, too. ",2007-09-07T14:11:03+0000

There, the father, Darius, begins a campaign to protect the local blue jays by belling the complexs cats, provoking the perplexed irritation of his neighbors and the embarrassment of his son, Xerxes. Years later, when Darius visits his now grown son in his apartment in New York, Xerxes asks his father to explain the incident. Darius instead relates a different story, one from his childhood that has weighed on his conscience ever since, a story that also involves birds but in which he is abuser rather than savior. The story so shocks his son and shames Darius that the two resolve never to speak to each other again. What purports to be their final conversation, appropriately enough, concerns the allowable weight of carry-on baggage.",2007-09-09T04:00:00+0000

us,Social Networking Site,"Back in 2003, Kimberly Stouffer worked at an advertising firm that was marketing a new, 184-unit, midrise condominium in a downtown neighborhood of San Diego called East Village. It was a challenging gig for an ambitious up-and-comer. San Diegans were relatively new to the idea of high-density living, having preferred for decades to sprawl into the suburbs. And among the eight downtown neighborhoods undergoing redevelopment, East Village was the sketchiest. Although there was a brand-new major league ballpark just one block away, the area was better known for homeless shelters and drug and alcohol rehab centers. (The condo building site itself was the former location of the San Diego Rescue Mission Mens Center.) Not only was the location dicey, but the market would also be tricky. The projects developer, Barratt American, was taking aim at the last of the Gen Xers (then in their late 20s and early 30s), a group that had long been portrayed as comically indecisive and confused by even the most basic challenges of adult life. Stouffer found herself asking the question, What sort of life do these young people want to live now that they are, at long last, entering independent adulthood? Stouffer had the advantage of being one of those young people herself. At the time she started the campaign, she was 27. A few years earlier, she moved to California after graduating from the University of Central Florida, where she got a bachelors degree in communications. Unlike the stereotypes of early Gen Xers, Stouffer was put together and enterprising. At first she moved to La Jolla, but she wanted to live closer to her work in San Diego and chafed at dropping $1,200 a month for rent. She was single and couldnt see herself living in a cul-de-sac. And she wanted to be in the mix where she could meet guys as motivated and successful as herself.",2007-09-09T04:00:00+0000

When Dantica fled Haiti in 2004, after a battle between United Nations peacekeepers and chimres  gang members  destroyed his church and put his life in jeopardy, he was 81, with high blood pressure and heart problems, and yet for 30 years had resisted his familys pleas to emigrate to the States. He intended to return and rebuild his church as soon as the fighting stopped. But to the Department of Homeland Security officers who examined him in Miami, his plea for temporary asylum meant he was simply another unlucky Haitian determined to slip through their fingers.

The most important periodical of our time, Us Weekly, has already put it best: Stars, theyre just like us. They abuse narcotics, consort with enemies of the state and haggle with prostitutes over services rendered. We know this because our government, when it was not otherwise occupied battling the menaces of Nazism and Communism, was keeping tabs on our most celebrated actors, artists and musicians, with a doggedness that would put any tabloid editor to shame. Redfern, a freelance journalist, knows this because he obtained declassified files the C.I.A., F.B.I. and other federal agencies kept on outspoken stars like Frank Sinatra and John Lennon, and on such seemingly upstanding citizens as John Wayne and John Denver. From Jimi Hendrixs Army file, we learn that this future rock god requires excessive supervision at all times and cannot function while performing duties thinking about his guitar. From F.B.I. documents, we discover that Abbott and Costello were scrutinized for slipping suspicious key words into their radio shows. And in Marilyn Monroes F.B.I. records, we are told that Norman Mailer is an eccentric but well-known author. In small doses, these factoids are good for a laugh. But Redferns book paints a progressively damning portrait of a government obsessed with pop cultures power and paranoid about controlling its message, as unnerved by the possibility of a riot breaking out at a Beatles concert as it is by the thought of Rock Hudson portraying an F.B.I. agent in a motion picture.

Mahe was not re-signed this year as the Eagles sought to energize their punt-return game, which ranked 10th last season. They turned the job over to J.R.

Lewis flubbed a punt, which the Packers recovered in the end zone. Reed flubbed another, which the Packers recovered, unbelievably, at the Eagles 35 with 1 minute 9 seconds left in the game and the score tied. They ran three plays and kicked the winning field goal.Which brings us to Mahe, whom the Eagles flew in from his home in Utah.All they said was, Were flying you out here, and well see you soon,  Mahe told The Philadelphia Inquirer on Monday.

us,Small Cars and a Big Mini,"The Mini Clubman is roughly 10 inches longer than the regular Mini Cooper. (Above left, Sascha Schuermann/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images; above right, John MacDougall/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images)  Suddenly, being small is big news at the Frankfurt auto show. And like surly subway riders during the morning commute, car manufacturers are busy elbowing their way into the city-car market.   In a prelude to the brands arrival next year in the United States, Mercedes-Benzs Smart division showed new diesel and electric-powered versions of its two-passenger Fortwo model.   Volkswagen introduced the Up! concept car, a sign that it's officially returning to its small car roots. VW was light on the specifics of this 135.8-inch hatchback, but the company did admit that the four-passenger Up! is rear-wheel drive. Should the Up! reach production (and this seems very likely) it would be the first rear-wheel drive small Volkswagen since the original Beetle.  Small car fever isnt limited to the Germans. Fiat has an elaborate display dedicated to its successful new 500 model, and Toyota unveiled its edgy iQ concept car. Even beleaguered Ford is displaying a stylish new small hatchback called the Verve. A size or two larger than cars like the Fortwo and Up!, the handsome Verve shows that Ford is serious about revamping its small cars  at least in Europe.  Ironically, as all these manufacturers jostle to introduce tiny cars, the auto company whose name is synonymous with small is now thinking big.  BMWs Mini brand is using Frankfurt to showcase the production version of the new Mini Clubman, a pint-size wagon. At 156.4 inches long, the Clubman is roughly 10 inches longer than the regular Mini Cooper. The Clubman has a novel split barn door rear tailgate, rather than the single-piece hatch of the Mini Cooper. Each of the Clubmans two rear doors has its own wiper and exterior handle. There is even a passenger-side-only, rear-opening half-door. Mini calls this the clubdoor. I call it a smart idea, as it allows easier access to the roomier back seat. With all these clever doors, does the Mini Clubman qualify as the worlds first 4.5-door wagon?  More importantly: Why Mini would risk sacrificing its ""think small"" brand ethos by introducing a less-mini Mini. The answer: bigger sales and profits. According to Mini, the Clubman wagon will help push yearly sales of all Minis past 240,000 in 2008. The Clubman arrives in showrooms later this year. ",2007-09-13T15:47:36+0000

Progress in both spheres, the scientific and the political, was not only analogous and linked, but also, in some sense, inevitable, at least once rigorous standards of clear thinking were adopted. Let people freely and rationally pursue physics, and eventually theyd draw the conclusion that the Earth moves. Let people freely and rationally think about how best to organize human society  with a view toward diminishing turmoil and augmenting the realization of individual potential  and eventually theyd separate church and state. Weve assumed the matter has been thankfully settled, at least in the Western intellectual tradition.

Virginias brilliant, forward-looking, transforming leaders, Dunn writes, created a nation and then controlled the executive branch for 32 of the first 36 years of Americas constitutional government. Virginia was once the wealthiest and most populous state, but by the early decades of the 19th century, its soil had been depleted by primitive farming methods; its schools were miserable, according to Jefferson; and its roads were execrable, a disgruntled visitor said. Its constitution preserved elitist government long after most states had expanded suffrage, and its plantation aristocracy deliberately hindered the economic dynamism that was modernizing the North. Slaverys role in the decline of the South is an old story, but Dunn, a professor of humanities at Williams College, finds fresh insights by making a case study of Virginia. She emphasizes the significance of lesser-known figures like Thomas Roderick Dew, who in 1832 published an essay that laid the intellectual groundwork for an uncompromisingly pro-slavery ideology, and Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, who anticipated secession with an 1836 novel envisioning a Southern rebellion. Dunns chief aim, though, is to show the complicity of Jefferson and Madison in Virginias stagnation. Both men strained against plantation dogma, Jefferson because of his egalitarian creed and Madison because of a wavering faith in the national government hed helped design. Yet they both acquiesced as states rights radicals adduced anti-Federalist pronouncements by the two founders to trump moderate opponents. The seeds of Virginias decline had been adroitly planted in fertile soil by the great patriarchs themselves, Dunn concludes. ",2007-09-16T04:00:00+0000

Menopause, Wilson argued, was not a natural age-related condition; it was an illness, akin to diabetes or kidney failure, and one that could be treated by taking estrogen to replace the hormones that a womans ovaries secreted in ever diminishing amounts. With this argument estrogen evolved into hormone-replacement therapy, or H.R.T., as it came to be called, and became one of the most popular prescription drug treatments in America.",2007-09-16T04:00:00+0000

us,Up Front,"In Grantas recent Best of Young American Novelists issue, the novelist Edmund White, one of the contests judges, took American writers to task for abandoning homegrown class divisions as a theme, preferring to take their encounters with the less fortunate abroad, in what he called the Peace Corps novel. Nell Freudenberger  one of the 21 writers chosen for the Granta list  says she sees his point, but also the difficulty of the enterprise. In her acclaimed books Lucky Girls and The Dissident, Freudenberger has written about relationships between privileged Americans and people from the developing world in locales ranging from New Delhi to Bangkok to Beverly Hills. Class is more fluid in America, and much more intertwined with money, Freudenberger said in an e-mail message. At the same time, we have a national mythology about classlessness. I think thats part of the reason I like to write stories from the point of view of people who arent American. Its a way of getting some distance, and hopefully seeing ourselves as Americans a little more clearly. On this weeks cover, Freudenberger reviews The Indian Clerk, David Leavitts novel about the Oxford mathematician G. H. Hardys friendship with Srinivasa Ramanujan, a modestly educated young man from Madras who turned out to be one of the 20th centurys greatest mathematical minds. Characters from different cultures have more trouble pinning down each others place in the social hierarchy, Freudenberger wrote in her e-mail message.

When many began participating in nationalist and racist violence, the group became hated and feared: playing in front of a skinhead backdrop and waving a Union Jack flag in 1992 made Morrissey a pariah in the left-wing music press. (Though portraying one in the skinhead flick Romper Stomper that same year kick-started Russell Crowes career.) Skinheads went underground until gays, who have disarmed much of the movements racism, recently began dragging them out of the closet  the photographer Slava Mogutin included homoerotic pictures of Berlin skinheads in his book Lost Boys. Nick Knights book Skinhead, which launched the fashion photographers career, is still selling. The director Shane Meadowss recent film, This Is England, follows an 80s skinhead. The designer Hedi Slimanes online photo diary includes an image of a black leather jacket with a patch bearing the name of the early skinhead group Cock Sparrer. And the British singer Paul Weller recently traced his obsessive love of style to his days as a junior skinhead in the late 60s. And then there are this seasons collections: lace-up bovver boots were spotted at Dior Homme, and Yohji Yamamoto even collaborated with Dr. Martens to update the skinheads stomp wear of choice.

I bought it and put it in the window, where it sold within minutes at a price not far from what it cost new. The attraction, I realized, was precisely that it was worn. In no time at all, no self-respecting Sloane Ranger would be seen without this distinctive olive green coat. Young army officers wore them as part of their mufti, teamed with straw-colored corduroys, suede shoes and red socks.

us,Non-alternative Airport Transportation,"BUSINESS travelers who pack light and like to save money and time as they shuttle among Americas major airports and cities might consider one not-so-trammeled route: rapid transit. Since 1989, more than 30 American metropolitan regions have developed or expanded their light-rail and commuter-rail systems, while some have built bus rapid-transit lines. Many of these new services provide airport connections, including ones that serve Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International. The Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, for instance, has been linked since 2000 by the Trinity Railway Express to the center of Dallas (35-minute ride, $4.50 each way), and since 2002 to Fort Worth (31 minutes, $2.50 each way). The Trinity trains run about twice an hour during peak commuting times in the morning and afternoon, and hourly at other times. The airport station can be reached by a shuttle bus from all terminals. Information is available at trinityrailwayexpress.org/newweekeb.html. Figuring out whether rapid transit works for you should take about five minutes on the Internet. Use the search term ground transportation and the airport you are visiting. All major airport Web sites publish instructions with maps about how to get to train stations. The sites also link to the local public-transit agency that operates the service and provide details about routes, schedules and fares. If you are carrying a lot of bags, a shuttle bus, taxi or rental car generally makes more sense even though they cost more than trains. During morning and afternoon rush hours, these more conventional methods can also take considerably longer. But if you are carrying only an overnight bag, a laptop and a briefcase, the train is competitive. Here are six cities that make the transit connection convenient. Boston Logan International Airport has two rapid transit lines to get downtown and to many suburbs, a rapid-transit bus line and a subway. Two years ago, the airport and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority opened the Silver Line rapid-transit bus service on a dedicated right of way from Logan to South Station downtown, which connects to commuter rail, Amtrak, intercity bus service and the Red Line subway to Cambridge and other communities. The bus stops three times in the city, serves all five Logan terminals, costs $1.25 a ride and takes about 20 minutes. A taxi takes much longer during rush hours and costs $25 to $30. Logan is also served by the Blue Line subway, reachable on a free shuttle bus that runs regularly all day and serves every terminal. The Blue Line intersects the Orange Line at the State Street station (three stops) and the Green Line at Government Center (four stops). The one-way fare is $2, and travelers typically can make the total trip, airplane to city destination, in 40 minutes to an hour, better than contending with Boston traffic, especially at peak times. For more information, go to mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/. PhiladelphiaThe Philadelphia International Airport is served by a commuter-rail line that connects all seven terminals to center city. Since the service started in 1985, 20 million passengers have used the R1 high-speed train to get to and from the airport. Trains run every 30 minutes from 5 a.m. to midnight, and take about 20 to 30 minutes to reach three downtown stations that connect with Amtrak and Philadelphias extensive subway and commuter-rail system. The one-way fare is $7 or $8 on the train (a taxi costs about $30), and tickets may be bought from the conductor. Additional information is at septa.org/service/sched/pdfs/R1Airport.pdf. Chicago The Chicago Transit Authority operates the Blue Line subway 24 hours a day from OHare International Airport to downtown Chicago. The authority also operates the Orange Line to Midway Airport. One drawback to taking the train to the city from OHare is that the Blue Line station is tricky to find. Follow the signs to the OHare C.T.A. station, which is on the lowest level of the parking garage in the main terminal area. One advantage, however, of taking the train from OHare is that it runs every 10 minutes during the day, and takes around 45 minutes. The Orange Line station at Midway is a 10-minute walk from the main terminal. Trains operate 21 hours a day during the week, every six to eight minutes during peak times, and take about 30 minutes to make the 121/2-mile trip downtown. The fare from OHare and Midway is $2 each way and could climb at peak times pending budget negotiations. Average taxi fare from OHare to downtown is $35 to $40, and from Midway $25 to $30. The Web site for the Blue Line is transitchicago.com/maps/rail/blue/OHare.pdf. For the Orange Line, transitchicago.com/maps/rail/orange/Midway.pdf. San FranciscoThe Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system has been serving San Francisco International Airport since June 2003 with fast, frequent trains. BART trains stop at a station in Garage G, which is reachable on the airports AirTrain system, an automated people mover that connects terminals with airport services. Its trains run all day, as often as every four minutes. BART operates from the airport from 4 a.m. to nearly midnight during the week. It takes 23 to 33 minutes to reach all San Francisco stations, which connect to four other lines and 37 more stations in the 104-mile system. One-way fares vary by destination, though they are generally in the $5 range. For schedules and a BART map, see bart.gov/stations/schedules/lineSchedules.asp. For fares, bart.gov/tickets/calculator/fareCalculator.asp. WashingtonRonald Reagan Washington National Airport, which lies just across the Potomac River from downtown Washington, is served by the Blue and Yellow Lines of the citys Metrorail, one of the most modern and elegant rapid-transit systems in the world. Trains operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority run every few minutes from 5 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., and to 3:30 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. The 106-mile, 86-station Metro system serves Washington and Virginia and Maryland suburbs. The trip from Reagan National to downtown on the Yellow Line, which is more direct, takes 10 to 15 minutes, depending on your stop. There is no faster way to get downtown. On the Blue Line, which serves more stations on the Virginia side of the river, trips downtown can take 15 to 24 minutes. Fares to center-city stations vary, but are generally around $2 each way. Tickets can be bought at dedicated vending machines at the airport Metro station, in front of the main terminal. The Web site for the Metros map is wmata.com/metrorail/systemmap.cfm. For schedules, wmata.com/timetables/rail/Midday.pdf. MinneapolisThe Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport is connected to downtown Minneapolis by the Hiawatha light-rail line. Trains run every 10 minutes during much of the day. The trip takes 25 minutes and costs $2 each way. Trams connect passengers to light-rail stations at two airport terminals, though this year one of the Hiawatha Light Rail stations is closed for construction at the Humphrey Terminal.

us,The Indian Clerk," The man sitting next to the podium appeared to be very old, at least in the eyes of the members of his audience, most of whom were very young. In fact he was not yet sixty. The curse of men who look younger than they are, Hardy often thought, is that at some moment in their lives they cross a line and start to look older than they are. As an undergraduate at Cambridge, he had regularly been mistaken for a schoolboy up for a visit. As a don, he had regularly been mistaken for an undergraduate. Now age had caught up with him and then outrun him, and he seemed the very embodiment of the elderly mathematician whom progress has left behind. ""Mathematics is a young man's game""-he himself would write these words in a few years time-and he had had a better run of it than most. Ramanujan had died at thirty-three. These days admirers smitten with Ramanujan's legend speculated as to what he might have achieved had he lived longer, but it was Hardy's private opinion that he wouldn't have achieved much. He had died with his best work behind him. ",2007-09-16T16:54:00+0000

Bloomberg has preached a doctrine of fiscal responsibility, but he has been presiding over one of the greatest expansions of city government since the John V. Lindsay administration, fueled by an extraordinary surge in real estate revenues, Diane Cardwell reports in a front-page article. The Times reviewed city data going back to 1980 and found that the city budget, adjusted for inflation, has grown by 23 percent, to $60 billion, since Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002, compared with 8 percent during Mayor Rudolph W. Giulianis eight years; 4 percent under Mayor David N. Dinkinss four years; and 19 percent during the last two terms of Mayor Edward I. Koch.About 75 percent of the growth under Mr. Bloomberg has been driven by expenses that are difficult to control, like employee health care costs and benefits, pension payments and Medicaid. Even so, Mr. Bloomberg has increased spending on controllable expenses, like parks, information technology and schools. The number of city workers has declined by about 1 percent since Mr. Bloomberg took office, but he has been increasing the staff of late. Mr. Bloombergs aides argued that their approach has been restrained and that the mayors investment in services has helped the city thrive.",2007-09-17T12:47:17+0000

George E. Pataki led the deregulation push, in which most of the state utilities, including Consolidated Edison, sold their power plants to independent companies, then brought power on unregulated wholesale markets. But instead of lower prices, New Yorkers have faced increases far larger than consumers in states that kept their power industries regulated, according to a study by Marilyn Showalter of Power in the Public Interest, which oppose energy deregulation.

Many Westerners needing a visa can buy one at the airport, just prior to going through passport control. (Be sure to check in your home country first!) Its a short walk to the baggage carousels and the duty free shops. If you have friends who live in town, ask them before hand if you can pick something up here for them: alcohol, perfumes and, yes, the ever popular cigarettes, are much cheaper here. One annoyance is that the luggage carts are not free of charge as they are in many European airports. Who has Turkish lira coins at this point? Once you have your bags and your duty free treats, proceed to the exit. Yes, there is a customs desk, but controls are few and far between. Once in the main concourse, you will find ATMs for getting local currency and even a Starbucks and a Gloria Jeans in case you just simply cannot wait for a dose of caffeine. Please note that departing passengers really do need to get here 2 hours before their flights.

He called her dark nights of the soul the inevitable result of a dogma that asks people to believe impossible things and then makes them feel abject and guilty when their innate reason rebels.

He mentions the Internet only briefly in the essay, but the topic is in dire need of further exploration. College, as Perlstein considers the subject, has disappeared because the energy that fueled it has found a new outlet via technology.

Knowledge certainly is power, and the more you know, the further in life you can go. But it simply is not this simple anymore. The knowledge of today needs to be backed up by a degree or two from a well-known and respected institution. Knowledge for knowledges sake is wonderful, but knowledge with a B.A., B.S., J.D., M.B.A., or Ph.D. behind it is more likely to pay the bills and obtain status.

This has led to the growth of my university- Temple, an institution geared towards the blue collared population of America, but it also represents a change in the mindset of the American public.

It took a scorching summer evening at a Philadelphia Phillies game for me to finally understand my father and his love for baseball. Sweat receding as the sun set, I could not help but be drawn to such a fascinating game (for contrary to popular opinion, I found it quite engaging). However, the joy and progression of the baseball game was soon overshadowed by the suffocating commercialism and false countenance that filled the stadium. Glancing around I noticed the American stereotype in all its glory: Chase Utley jerseys so snug around big bellies, empty cups of steak flavored slushies strewn about, and somehow an overabundance of cell phone users discussing important business in the middle of the fourth inning. Dolefully, I was overwhelmed by such an oblivion to the beautifully graceful sport that was being played there in the lights.

I recently received my undergraduate degree from Eugene Lang, the undergraduate Liberal Arts division of New School University. The New School University is an appropriate place to examine the streamlining of the college experience. My mothers college experience took place during the golden age of campus activism, the 1960s. Regardless, she finished her undergraduate degree in less than three years, for she did not have the time or financial opportunities to enjoy the frontier of American lifestyles as reminisced in Rick Perlsteins essay. Her only radical act was wearing jeans to school.. Yet, when it came time for her son to start applying to college, she was awash in nostalgia. For my mother, who didnt have the privilege to live on a college campus or take part in any extra-curricular activities, a reminder of these years still exuded a sense of nervous excitement. Herein lies the defining characteristic of my generation: there is no more excitement, because there is no more danger in the college experience; no more lust for danger. By danger, I do not infer acts of violence. By danger, I mean the uncertainty entangled with the new- the mystery in experiencing the never before.

A resolution came more quickly than anyone anticipated: by late afternoon the Dean of Students announced that the President, George Campbell, who had earlier made a reluctant and sheepish appeal to the crowd of students, agreed to meet the demands of the protest. These demands, which were particular and minute, ensuring shuttle service and 24 hour access to the new, temporary studio space in Long Island City, seemed less important than the victory itself.

There is no period of separation from home and intense interaction with peers, no encouraged period of individual growth, both intellectual and emotional. Instead, immediately after high school, Russian teens choose their professions and attend graduate or technical school. Most assume adult responsibilities like marriage and family early in life, at least earlier than comparable young adults in the United States. This happens not only because of economics or similar causes, but also because of a social belief system very different from that of the United States, one in which college  both as a reflection of and an influence on society  is nonexistent. America is nearly unique it its dedication of this time of personal growth in the life of a young adult, and the role college plays in our society  even as different generations pass through it  cannot be underestimated.

That was the definition of college I believed in, until it was time to decide where I wanted to go. As I read more about college life, and as I discussed the reasons as to why even bother spending such a long time in an institution, I realized that college was the path that led to living the life of a normal person who contributes money and time to society and who believes in the altruistic, humanistic approach to life.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000

Now a rising Senior, I have often paused to consider whether my college experience has been everything college might entail, imply or even demand. I have learned to dismiss these questions as unanswerable and irrelevant; I have rejected them for the same reason I dispute Rick Perlsteins assertion that college is disappearing: the very premise is wrong.

But a college degree and a college education are not necessarily one and the same. As an 18 year old entering college, one has already completed 12 continuous years of schooling. He or she is not looking at college in terms of education for educations sake, but rather for what other opportunities, e.g. Social, athletic, or career, might present themselves. That and a small piece of paper which indicates that you are now educated and competent enough to join the work force is the primary focus. This is no different today than it was 32 years ago, when I first entered college. What is different is the level of sophistication that accompanies a college freshman. Gone is the wide-eyed wonder and blatant innocence worn by the matriculating student of the 60s and 70s. Then, for many, it was the first time away from home and the only connection to the familiar was Ma Bell or the US Postal Service. College became home, and friends became family.

But like all the best tales we tell ourselves, this one too went the way of the tooth fairy. In his Whats the Matter with College, Rick Perlstein examines the modern phenomenon of the College Campus that Couldnt, wondering how it devolved from its sixties counterpart, a magical realm that kindled its students intellectual fires and replaced all the worlds answers with questions. Today, he reports, college life is a choice between organization and alienation. College without criticism falls short of being critical; and when campus no longer leads the culture, college as we know it is coming to an end. But if college was college before Perlstein was there, collegians once learned not to question societys values but to uphold them. Whether it translates to a hippies dream or a hipsters nightmare, college is still society, caricatured: the sixties were a liberating time for everyone involved, not just the freshmen, and if college then inculcated an era-appropriate dose of dissent, college these days does just as good a job raising respect for the establishment. Its the very stillness of true conservatism that allows its impact to slide by unnoticed, and so while Perlstein is right to note todays collegiate sea change, I dont see the level of questioning he hearkens to occurring anywhere, whether on campus or off. No wonder the celebration of universities has quieted since the hippies heyday; todays political climate holds its dissidents and intellectuals at bay.

Thus, in order to get that perfect job, college is a must. And its not just about the career. College has become an indication of status. We express more interest in and tend to think higher of those who have gone to the ivy leagues than those who have gone to community college. Those who didnt even go to college we place at the bottom of the social ladder. True, there have been cases of people who have gone on to become successful and highly admired in our society (Steve Jobs, a college dropout, comes to mind).

The period of self expression and experimentation of ideas during four years between the ages of 18 and 22 is a fairytale scenario for the masses. This blissful journey through college where students have time to read books like Measure for Measure in dorm common rooms and have intellectual discussions of what Shakespeares true message was, is not for everyone. Yes, college today is connected with real world issues and students study boring topics (to some) like business. College being practical should not be a novel concept. With the price of higher education today, parents only hope that their children are learning up to date education and not skipping class to discuss classic works of fiction. Immigrant parents, at least mine, are forever advising their children to work hard and obtain a degree that will secure a job after college. I could never dream of studying music, dance or theatre because to my parents, those careers are merely hobbies. I was meant to be a lawyer, a doctor or a diplomat! my mother always said.

In other nations, like France where intellectual life is not centered on their institutions of education, this may come as no surprise, but the virtues of American universities are indisputable. Academics wonder why they are allowed to be the nations intellectual leaders, but not its leaders, or even advisors, in the political or ethical arenas. Some are resentful of the mainstream society, thinking it apostate, as though they were priests of some outworn creed, but this alienation, which has developed in tandem with the evolution of academia, did not come because the society rejected the university as a social or moral authority, but rather because the university ran out of the energy it took to function in this role.

College is less of a national and cultural landmark as it is a necessity and emblem of prestige. More and more students are applying to and attending college today, not because they lust after the new life and independence it will offer, but because it is an obligatory prerequisite for careers. Competition for acceptance into the most prestigious colleges has increased, not because the enlightening landscape these schools offer, but because it is a vehicle for one day acquiring a dream, and for the recognition itself.

us,A Silenced Generation,"In 1974, President Richard Nixon refused to surrender tapes and documents subpoenaed by the Senate Watergate Committee, the American economy was enduring a persistent oil crisis, and my mother turned seventeen. As an early high school graduate, she left Queens, NY for the first time in her life, and began her journey toward a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. The use of the word journey is fundamental in this context because one of the most inspirational stories she has to her name is what my mother fondly recalls as her circuitous path to self-discovery. This winding route took her to and from various schools across the globe, culminating with an eventual Bachelor of Fine Arts from Minneapolis School of Art and Design and, many years later, a medical degree from Cornell University Medical School. Today it is 2007, and while there is another oil crisis devastating the economies of many American communities, and high ranking officials continue to disregard subpoenas, the college experience has certainly diverged from what it once was. We have come from a generation whose youth believed that the answers to lifes most significant questions were blowing in the wind,to become a new generation of students who want those same answers, right here, right now. Preferably collated. My mothers college experience, while unique, was not unheard of in the 1960s and 70s. Those decades brought about an incredible generation of American adolescents who set out to change the world, one campus at a time; my mother was no exception to this trend. These days, my parents both happily recount experiences of peaceful yet poignant dissidencemy father even has a trove of brightly colored (yet, seldom tie-dyed) pins and badges documenting his participation. To be sure, they were fortunate to grow up in a time where this youthful dissent, while discouraged and opposed, was never effectively quelled. Students felt that their opinions warranted change and consequently, united in their beliefs to create a revolution. Through these demonstrative efforts, they fought for myriad causes of paramount importance: civil rights, humanitarian goals, and of course, peace. In turn, college became a critical time in which students learned from the experience of others and put a unified, tangible strain on conservative minds to consider a more progressive way of life. In March of 1970, for example, there was a protest on the steps of Colby Colleges Lorimer Chapel. The protestors quietly assembled for a full week to draw attention to college policies they found were unfair toward minority and underprivileged students. I attend Colby, a private liberal arts college in New England, and I feel extremely proud to be a student at an institution with such a rich history of protest. Yet I admit with resignation, that my college no longer embodies the same activist spirit it once did. Although students sometimes have concerns similar to the Lorimer protestors, nothing remotely comparable to the sit-in would ever occur there today. Indeed, to the dismay of unconventional thinkers everywhere, many of them our own parents, students of my generation are more likely to step either in line or in the box then sit down firmly and block the queue.

We were told that we would be exposed to interesting new people and ideas and that it would be an exciting period of growth like no other. I left home expecting to be immersed in a world of intellectual conversation and stimulating classes. I pictured a college experience like my parents had described to me, full of political activity and freedom of thought but these dreams were shattered shortly after I started school. The whole ordeal seemed to be nothing more than a slightly more intense and less interesting version of high school. I assumed that it was me alone that felt this way and that I simply was not acclimating properly. However, when the issue came up one day in a conversation in the dorm common room, everyone seemed to have similar concerns about the fact that college was not everything they thought it would be. This was two years ago and I am now beginning my junior year at UCLA and have found that these feelings are prevalent in the majority of students that I have met. In truth, college life today is comparatively dry and tedious and leaves students with preciously little free time to pursue their own interests or think about social issues. College has lost its place in the lives of undergraduates because it is no longer the place of freedom of expression and personal growth it once was. As the time and interest students have in political affairs diminishes, so does the value of their experience at universities and the societal importance of college campuses.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000

As if this wasnt enough, we evaluated our own strengths, weaknesses, and dreams, in light of those of our peers, and perhaps even manipulated them, so that we might have a chance, just a chance, at being considered for admission to a competitive university. Most of us were fortunate enough to have had the emotional and financial support of our parents to brace us through the process; however, the average parent is incapable of pulling enough strings to secure a successful future for his or her child.

Now I can see just how much sweat is pouring off of Shaqs forehead when Im shooting free throws on my Playstation 3. He mentions an account of a girl who talks to her dad for 15 minutes on her cell phone and how college students used to dread talking to their parents, trying to distance themselves as much as possible. Maybe it is just me, but that is a perfect example of a generation gap. But yet he claims thats the problem with college. No gap from the students and their parents. My parents dont try to like the same things I do, just simply want to be informed on what their son or daughter is up to. I didnt realize it was a problem to keep in touch with my parents, especially now in a world were I can be reached on my own cell phone, not something my parents had in college, by letter or even better by e-mail.

My Freudian slip, nothing, reveals something interesting though, about our understanding of education, for the slip is hardly individual; its national. We find ourselves in the classic conundrum in which education is directly proportional to ones time in school. In accordance with this logic, for someone like myself in an academic gap, my education is on pause and I can actively do nothing.

Sure, many of my peers are career-minded and nearly all are academically resolute, yet there is always a childlike blitheness around campus that never ceases to pull us through even the most stressful pre-examination periods. Indeed, as Perlstein notes, the gap between childhood and college has shortened, but not solely in the sense that, because of the Internet, pre-college students now have more information and ideas at their fingertips than ever before. Despite this, there is still a very genuine, nostalgic attachment to carefree elementary school days that I have noticed not only in Vassar students, but also in my friends at home, many of whom are still eager to revel in classic Disney movies, immerse themselves in the latest Harry Potter book, or, as a friend and I once decided to do, organize a Barbie party.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000

A time when I didnt automatically refer to my teachers as doctor or professor. And a time when I would never start a sentence with the word and because high school English teachers have a problem with it. But college is above those kinds of rules, its liberating. Its a chance not only to become more independent, but also to be exposed to a higher level of knowledge or a different view of a subject that will hopefully leave you with a new respect for how much humans have achieved. Even more importantly, its a chance for you to hide from the real world under the title of student for one last time while you figure out where exactly you fit into society and what you want to do with your life.

They blathered on about activism in the 60s, how they had fought against censorship and a war they thought was unjust, and how today college students just dont care anymore. I think that they, along with many other aging liberals, suffer from the same problem in their thinking. That is to say that they dont realize it isnt the 60s anymore. The 1960s were a very special time in American cultural history. Young people begin to break away from traditional cultural norms, exploring sex and drugs and reactionary politics. This, coupled with the political atmosphere at the time overshadowed by the controversial Vietnam War and a government that tried to suppress many forms of thought created an explosive situation.

Today, wealth and privilege arguably play less of a role in admissions, at least at a state university like my own. Nevertheless, parents and children of every income level see themselves primarily as customers in a transaction. The Times itself noted in 1998 [1] that colleges are increasingly viewed as employment credentialing stations. Perhaps I am naive to assume that it has ever been otherwise, that college was ever seen as more than a means, but at the least, it was an opinion that would have once elicited consternation instead of cheerful acceptance or weary resignation.

He isundoubtably right in realizing the tides are changing; we need onlylook at the social and political environment of the previous eras inwhich men like Doug Mitchell attended college to see the disparitiesin social perception and life experience between the college youth of,for example, the sixties, and the college youth of today. Mitchellswas a time of social upheaval, when America and its children werequesting for a new identity and an opportunity to improve the world;it was indeed the liberal hour during which the faith thatintellectual idealism and political progressivism held the key to thefuture of humanity ran rampant. Colleges at the time were, of course,intimately linked to this phenomenon, and served as incubators forbudding intellectuals and safe-havens for political theorizing anddebate. Today, we live in a very different social climate, one inwhich faith in the government has greatly dwindled, and dwindlesstill, and a certain mixture of fear and paranoia have cast aparalyzing shadow over the sunny progressivism of days now gone by.Disillusionment with the two-party system, or at least with the twoparties themselves, widely publicized government fiascos and scandal,floundering support for the president, and fear of disturbing worldrealities like terrorism have created a situation where people haveinsulated themselves from the realm of external world affairs,Politics and all it entails. Others have cynically decided that, forthem, opportunism and not philanthropy promises to be the mostfulfilling of philosophies. This I think, is integral to understandingthe circumstances of the change. If the average college student nowgrows up in an environment where political expression andphilosophical cultivation is much less encouraged, he or she willreflect that, and the old perception of American colleges as hotbedsof political activism will come to be outdated.

However I do know that after a year of stressing over college essays, grades, and test scores, I have very high expectations for what my college experience will be. Currently I am undecided in what my major is going to be, and every college I visited promised me that through the curriculum their school provides I will find my passion. This I believe will be true. I have also been promised an environment of strong political activism, where I will have the opportunity to get involved in any sort of issue or cause if I choose to. This I believe will be true. And college has also promised me an environment where I will meet new people, and have the opportunity to try and see things that I previously never have. This I also believe will be true. All of these different experiences are the appeals that college offers to its students, and it has been this way since the 1960s. Therefore, if college is offering the same academic and social experience as before, why are college campuses becoming more and more apathetic?

Today, the college student is more competitive; career focused and has a different agenda for their education than they had in the past. Students now are taught by the very nature of the college admission process that they must compete with grades, SAT scores and many other individuals to be admitted to the college of their first choice. Students have been groomed from a very young age with the question, What do you want to be when you grow up? that many have been focused on their lifes aspirations for many years prior to stepping foot on campus. Students seem to almost grow up quicker and have many more life experiences prior to college age. They read books in high school that were once required reading for college and this puts them ahead of where previous college students were at the start of their college experience. They have the chance to go abroad on school trips and have life experiences that were once reserved for the college student. Students in the 1960s and 1970s led more sheltered lives prior to college. Theses students life experiences with politics, taking action for a cause and new found freedoms, began when they left the confines of their homes and arrived on a college campus.

This creates a mentality where working for a grade, a test score, and ultimately a high salary are what students use to judge their own value. A bachelors degree does not hold the prestige it did a generation ago. It is merely a bench mark to even be considered for the majority of jobs in todays globalizing economy.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000

I got a combined SAT score of 1500 and applied to a total of three colleges chosen primarily on the basis of family history and the prestige factor (Harvard, Princeton, etc). I dont stand out in any statistics and no admissions offices are scrambling over themselves to fill the upper-middle class Caucasian woman quota so I guess you could say Im that faceless college student that were all competing against, the overachiever that threatens us with their well-rounded resume and impressive GPA. Im everyones worst nightmare, just like every other college student with their original ideas and their up-n-at-em attitude are incentives for making my own collegeexperience a living hell. Mr. Perlstein asked, Whats wrong with colleges today? I reply that the rat race mentality has poisoned the intellectual atmosphere of our nations universities and turned college into just another cog in the societal machine that rushes us into our graves on the 9-to-5-shift assembly line. Instead of being leaders of our national culture, the college-agecohort has been demoted to the bottom of the corporate ladder, and as college students were all battling for the next promotion.

Nowadays, most students are more willing to protest Friday classes and the food selection in the cafeteria than the genocide in the Sudan. While there are groups at every campus who are politically-minded, many of their peers would consider them, in Ronald Reagans words, to be a noisy, dissident minority.

My generation has been told since childhood that college is a persons only chance to enjoy the independence of adulthood without its responsibilities. It is a time of unparalleled fun, maturation, and intellectual stimulation, after which we will emerge as confident, wise, and self-aware adults with, of course, earning potentials that exceed that of our parents.

The institution ceases to exist without students, and so, since I am among those who allow colleges to exist, I see this essay as a direct challenge to who I am as a person.

Preoccupation with, and anxiety about college are rampant in the United States. Read any news publication for one week, and I guarantee there will be an article about college. But instead of it being a piece decrying the falling moral standards at our nations top educational institutions, as it would have been forty years ago, it will be a mournful article about how expensive college is, or a haughty one about how selective it is, or a human interest story about a student who is the first in her family to attend college.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000

An Uncle Sam on stilts teetered above the crowd, another activist impersonated President Johnson and the San Francisco Mime Troupe appeared in whiteface as the Guerrilla Marching Band. Activists banged tambourines while students assembled to stage an obstructive sit-in at the building where recruiters from Dow Chemical Company, the militarys supplier of napalm, were conducting placement interviews, as David Maraniss described the scene in They Marched Into Sunlight. The crowd of protestors had grown to well over a thousand by noon, and around 1:30 p.m., police forced their way in to clear the building. What happened next shocked the city and eventually the nation, as the churning mass of students inside the building fell like grain under the scything of police batons. Forty-seven students w ere treated at the university medical center that day, and many more left with eyes reddened by tear gas, released for the first time ever on the campus. Madison soon became known as one of the most anti-war campuses in America, considered by some to be the Berkeley of the Midwest. Madison saw protests again at the start of the build-up to the Iraq War, but nothing that could match the Vietnam protests for violence or cultural significance. In this, the campus serves as a microcosm for the nations universities as a whole, a barometer of activism that has fallen over time. And as the status of the American campus has descended to a tepid lull, the attention of the American public has waned. There are no more headlines about student protests. The nation no longer knows or cares what happens on these serene islands of academia, even though someday these students will be solving the problems created by a leadership that came of age in Vietnam. Former Wisconsin administrator Paul Ginsberg, who watched both the Vietnam and Iraq antiwar movements unfold, found that the Iraq protests were marked by a certain placidness that barely disturbed the quiet serenity that reigned over campus. The result was classic pothole theory, a catchphrase harkening back to the Vietnam era: Nobody goes to harangue the city council until a pothole appears on their street.

Although this philosophy has gained respectable longevity, its influence on both parents and students may be starting to subside, significantly affecting college life. Two colleges of interest, Harvard College and the University of California: San Diego, share vastly similar average graduate starting salariesapproximately $51,000 annuallyyet the number of college applicants to available spots at UCSD is only 2 to 1, which is dwarfed in comparison to Harvards colossal 11 to 1 ratio.

More students were attending college, making going to school attractive and exciting. The Vietnam War, the draft, and the fight towards racial integration provided students with issues that they cared deeply about and that affected them personally. Many students were away from home for the first time. Large numbers of young, energetic, like-minded individuals collected in places away from traditional authority.

I was a bit queasy, a bit unsettled, but certainly engaged by the footage. I could have just as easily read up on the footage at any number of news websites, human rights blogs, news channels with multiple shows and personalities  or I could have passed a glance at a headline in a newspaper: IRANIAN WOMAN STONED WITHOUT REMORSE. The event is not particularly news to me. Not in the sense that I have come to expect it (a sensibility I would have indeed come to have exercised, given a literally never-ending deluge of information about such events), but rather in that it has simply lost its interest, its engagement, its flash of relevance in my significantly less afflicting life. I realize now that I have been desensitized to the rapid flow of information not because of the content itself, but because of its close-wed relationship to the laurels upon which the college generation of the Vietnam-era America had established for the future of academia, and it is here as a college student that I can attest to the change of college as I envisioned it in Americas fabric to the lived reality of it. Rick Perlstein writes in Whats the Matter With College? that College has fallen in strength due to the apathy felt among students towards the very distinct changes from high school and post college life, viewing it with an obfuscated sense of their lives great times. College is supposed to be the springtime of ones life; a season that has been muddled into a haze by Perlsteins account, citing the many students who have come to resent their collegiate experience.

Information and its rapid flow  often considered to be one of the defining characteristics of this generation  have served to inform a surge of people in the world to come to maintain keen awareness of its vitality and importance in their lives  or they could maintain a keen faade. The progressive template of the students of the 60s and 70s has come to feel to large to the students of the yet unnamed00s (yet unnamed, appropriately enough) due in large part to this desensitization to information and, tragically enough, the most prevalent of indicators for the generation to come.

As a current undergraduate, I have to agree. In most ways, college life for me has been an extension of my high school years and simultaneously the start of my immersion into the infamous real world. Instead of disassociating myself from the friends, interests, and beliefs I had before college, I, along with most of my fellow classmates, are building on what came before college. We are also looking ahead to what will come after, which often translates to our professional lives. As Perlstein points out, for those who came of age in the cataclysmic 1960s and 1970s, the college experience of today often seems tame and even depressing. After all, to the outside eye my generation is not breaking down entrenched social barriers or reshaping the political landscape like my parents generation did. We appear to stand for little and act on even less. Mostly, we seem disaffected and unaware of the troubles facing our country and world. My challenge to anyone who feels that way is to take another look.

Well I have my own reactions to why this seems so, and I will also explain why college is still very important, but it is not the defining factor in our society today. To compare the college generation today to the college generations of the 1960s and 1970s is to compare two different eras, two different cultures, and two very different citizens of The United States. As a current student at Rutgers University, The State School of New Jersey in the information age I willingly and unwillingly make decisions everyday based on the era in which I lived. My fellow college students and I are constantly connected to the people we interact with. Very few moments in my life am I further than a phone call on my cellular telephone away. Previous generations have not had that luxury; there was a time difference with uncertainty because of the delay of communication. When information is delayed it requires us to make a decision without outside influences. Within the college community the quest for knowledge is no longer verbally transmitted to the extent it once was. The forum to display views is now on the internet. Even television today is not an open communication, what is received by our television and eventually by its patrons is decided by major corporations with their own political agendas.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000

While this may seem like the moment in life to run far, far away without ever looking back, for many young adults it turns out to be nothing of the sort.

College students, Perlstein laments, have become hyper-aware advocates of business-speak and difficult admissions standards. Colleges have lost their place as incubators of radicalism, and no longer provide a discrete experience that provided a radical break between childhood and the real world. Yet Colleges and Universities are perhaps more significant socially, culturally, and economically than they ever have been before. With no raiding of campus buildings to do, how can the modern college student possibly prove his/her worth to society at large? If politicians fail to rail against the depravities of college campuses, then how can they be relevant?This past fall, nearly 18 million college students were enrolled in the 4,216 institutions of higher education that grant degrees in the United States alone, up from the 12 million 25 year ago.

Growing up in the quintessential university town of Madison, Wisconsin, and reared by the generation that created the college image we now know, I have heard countless stories about the best four years of ones life. A wild John Belushi embodied the college experience in 1978s Animal House, reinforcing the enduring collegiate image of chaotic freedom. Touted as the beginning of your life, it is the place to find out who you really are. However, college has changed over time. As I approached this milestone in my own life, I began to wonder what these years would be like for me.

As I embarrassingly explained my lack of desire to actualize the next 20 years of my life before the end of freshman year of college, I realized that I was in the minority. It was almost a running gag in high school that every highly motivated student had planned out most of his or her adult life or simply was in denial. In a time where our parents understand us and try to figure out what is truly best for us, it seems as if our own responsibility for discovering what we find truly important has been taken away. Rick Perlman states that College was aimed at our parents. If that is to be believed, perhaps it is true that this generation has not been given the freedom to chart our own course.

A generation ago, college was an institution, where only a select group of individuals, from the wealthiest upper echelons of society could afford to attend. Devoid of the economic burden, these students were exposed to coming of age experiences vastly different from the children of the average 1950s all-American family and were free to expand their minds. But, today, more and more students from all realms of society are attending college than ever recorded and these new students are singing a different tune.

The truth of the matter is that no matter how much I am truly fascinated with the history of the late 60s and early 70s, and do genuinely admire a great deal of what they accomplished, it is their generation who has asked my peers to stand up and fight for Vietnam the Sequel, or who are at least complicit in its ugly evolution by failing to adequately challenge its conception, when they should have known better. Their participation in the Iraq War, whether active or passive, proves to some extent that they did not have it all right, and makes one wonder how much useful knowledge was actually gleaned from their experiences. To imply that we are in some way failing the college legacy because we do not now resemble them is both narcissistic and false. I believe it is my own generations awareness of the limitations of the peace movement, combined with the fact that protesting today is no longer the radical act of defiance that it once was, that makes us tentative to emerge from the insulation of our iPod universes, and to seek change through the social movements and civil disobedience that evoked the fear and ire of California gubernatorial candidate Ronald Reagan 40 years ago.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000

In response, colleges have had to cater to a much larger and more diverse population of students, many of whom see college only as the next step to a career.

College used to be regarded as a privilege for those who can afford it until recently it has started to be regarded and expected of students to go to college right after high school. Before students go to college and discover it for themselves, they have grandiose ideas conjured in their minds of classes, meeting new people and liberty formerly unknown to them, but what these students dont realize at first is why they are going to college. Some students may just be at college because they are doing what they are told or going because they want to get into graduate school. But the unwritten result of going to college and why college matters is because it transforms them from children into adults and throughout the whole transformation process the students will have learned more about themselves more than ever before.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000

us,My College Experience as I Didnt Plan it,"Whether college is more or less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago depends on who you ask, so the best way for me to approach the question is to describe how critical my college experience has been to me. I think that although the keys to the kingdom of college have survived the generations, the doors seem to have moved; where _Tropic of Capricorn_ may have gotten Doug Mitchell into college in the 1960s, I maintain that Henry Millers other _Tropic_ saved me from it. I discovered _Tropic of Cancer_ in the summer of 2005, when two years of bewildering social and intellectual impotence at the University of Pittsburgh had left me frustrated and misplaced. I had run from high school to college in the earnest pursuit of truth, but had not to stay long before worrying that maybe in spite of my hunger for knowledge, I was not the university type after all. Although I initially flew at college with the intensity of a laser beam, a quick Freshman Studies brainwashing on the value of a liberal arts education was all it took to scatter the force of my curiosity on impact. I had been anxious to jump right in and see what Philosophy was all about, but my advisers at Pitt, operating under a liberal arts theory, prescribed intellectually dilute yet logistically overwhelming schedules for underclassmen  a tight regimen of dabbling  that I think prevented me from ever really taking root in the Philosophy Department. I cant say it was all bad; I did put some solid work into English, for example, which was a critical step in establishing my academic direction. But two years is a long time to feel like an outsider in ones major department, and when those beaming study-abroad veterans regaled my foreign language class with tales of life-changing journeys of self-discovery overseas, I considered study abroad not only as a temporary escape from my frustrations, but as an opportunity to see how Philosophy worked at another university. So, passing over the glossy pamphlets advertising Pitt-affiliated abroad programs, I opted instead for a direct enrollment with University College London.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000

Why do college and college students no longer lead the culture? In fact as more and more students pursue a university education, the question of why they do so at all must take on a new significance for those who care about education. For as we shall see, the fact that students are becoming increasingly unhappy with their college experience suggests that the very concept of education is changing and that we are losing sight of its true value.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000

us,"Climate Chatter, but No Breakthrough Until Bush is Gone","Most Europeans are downplaying a meeting on climate change organized by President Bush this week. The Germans are sending Federal Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel  but other countries and the European Union are sending officials with far less weighty portfolios.The EU will be represented by Humberto Rosa, the deputy environment minister of Portugal. Stavros Dimas, the EUs environment commissioner, is giving the meeting a miss to ensure that the focus for climate change talks stays at the United Nations and on a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, in December. The British government is sending Phil Woolas rather than its environment minister, Hilary Benn.There are a number of cocktail parties leading up to the ball in Bali in December, and the meeting in Washington next week is one of them, a spokeswoman for Britains department for the environment told me.Green Europe may be right to snub America over climate change. After all Europeans have been busy implementing the Kyoto Protocol while the Americans have dawdled. Whats the point of Europeans endorsing a gathering in Washington if Americans dont yet favor binding targets?But Europe still has a lot of work ahead getting its own house in order. A number of EU countries have failed to meet the modest emissions-reduction targets under Kyoto while newer EU members are resisting future targets, saying they should have a chance to industrialize first so they can reach western European standards of living.Major European industries, including carmakers like Volkswagen, protest that new targets are too onerous. European policy makers also differ on the best way to persuade fast-developing countries to sign a new global treaty.With Europe presenting a somewhat fragmented front, the best hope for bringing China and India into a future treaty probably still remains a unilateral move by the United States to cut emissions. Thats unlikely to happen under the Bush administration. So while talks in Washington this week could through up interesting ideas dont expect any real breakthroughs until 2009, when a new U.S. president takes office. ",2007-09-24T11:18:45+0000

These were short-term occurrences that people, in Italy above all, learned to accept without interest. Now, however, fashion appears to be entering longer, less predictable chapters. There are the new, unjaded consumers from Russia and the Far East. Should it surprise anyone that Vivienne Westwood, the former punk rebel and subject of a retrospective here, has 15 shops in Hong Kong and five in Moscow? There is the growing acceptance, not just in the United States but here in Europe, for all kinds of cosmetic surgery. The quest for perfect bodies and youth-enhanced faces is bound to have an impact on the look of fashion. Its all I kept noticing on the streets of Milan over the weekend: tight women, aged 25 to 45, in their tight fashionable clothes. And there are the new fashion capitalists, the investors and private-equity funds like Permira in England, which owns the Valentino Fashion Group.

Her lawyer, Harold Cassidy, asked the court to reconsider what he called very clear errors in the courts decision regarding a doctors responsibility to answer patient questions, whether or not the case should be heard by a jury, and disagreements among expert witnesses over when human life begins. In her suit, Ms. Acuna said she would not have had the abortion if she had received proper answers to her questions. The court ruled that her doctor had no legal duty to tell her that her 6-to-8-week-old embryo was a complete, separate, unique and irreplaceable human being.",2007-09-26T04:00:00+0000

The museum is seeking the commissions permission to paint the exterior in Benjamin Moore HC-35, an egg-finish shade recommended by outside conservation experts, as they found it was the closest match to a paint chip that was signed by Wright and stamped July 24, 1958. The commissions approval is needed because of the Guggenheims status as a protected landmark and its location in the Carnegie Hill historic district. Experts say the buildings original coat was supposed to be the darkest of three samples of a color called Cocoon. Instead, the building was coated in the lightest of the three Cocoon samples, with no clear explanation, the landmarks commission said. A thorough analysis of the museums finish has revealed as many as 12 coats of paint, including four grayish-white layers applied since 1992; four buff layers applied from the 1960s back to the 1950s; the original light Cocoon; and, finally, the blue primer. According to the analysis, Wrights intent was always to coat the building in an egg finish. He apparently hated white, said Elisabeth de Bourbon, a commission spokeswoman.",2007-09-26T04:00:00+0000

Yet there was a sense that the trial atmosphere had lightened as a result of the pact. Marion True, the former curator, is charged with conspiring to acquire artifacts for the Getty that the Italians say were looted from their soil, including some that are to be returned under the agreement. Daniela Rizzo, a prosecution witness, described a visit she made in 2001 to the Getty as part of an Italian delegation gathering evidence for the case. She said Ms. True was very collaborative in discussing potential Italian claims and archaeological projects. We talked at length  I saw this as positive, Ms. Rizzo testified. She was obviously very concerned and sorrowed. Franco Coppi, who heads Ms. Trues Italian defense team, said that the agreement had knocked the drama out of the trial. Although the criminal charges remain, a lawyer for the Italian government said in court that Italy would formally drop civil charges against Ms. True in January. A prosecutor, Paolo Ferri, said in an interview that he hoped that lesser criminal charges against her could now be negotiated. Im hoping to close the trial without losing another two years, he said.

The report found that the National Air and Space Museums inadequate electrical systems have forced it to close galleries occasionally, and its inadequate temperature and humidity controls have corroded historic airplanes; the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and the National Museum of African Art have faulty humidification systems; and the National Zoos sea lion and seal pools are losing 110,000 gallons of water a day. The report put the cost of addressing the overall maintenance backlog at $2.5 billion. Cristin Samper, acting secretary of the Smithsonian, said that some problems noted in the report could not be fixed because we simply do not have the funds to do so. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, yesterday called on the Smithsonians Board of Regents, its governing body, to respond with further details. Time and again I have conveyed to the Regents that the Smithsonian cannot rely on the federal government for this magnitude of funding, she said in a letter to Roger W.

In the follow-up investigations, it comes out that some of the engineers involved knew something was wrong. But too few spoke up or pushed back  and those who did were ignored. This professional deficiency is something the new, tuition-free Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering wants to fix. At its tiny campus in Needham, Mass., outside Boston, Olin is trying to design a new kind of engineer. Most engineering schools stress subjects like differential calculus and physics, and their graduates tend to end up narrowly focused and likely to fit the stereotype of a socially awkward clock-puncher. Richard K. Miller, the president of the school, likes to share a professional joke: How can you tell an extroverted engineer? Hes the one who looks at your shoes when he talks to you. Olin came into being, Miller told me last spring in his office on campus, to make engineers comfortable as citizens and not just calculating machines. Olin is stressing creativity, teamwork and entrepreneurship  and, in no small part, courage.

Passers-by on their way to the Pita Pit or Hodgins Drug barely give the students a second glance. Not a few residents, however, have fought hard to keep them out of downtown.

Bernadette had no daughters. In every generation there had been an uncomfortable moment when the mother had to choose between her children as there was only one statue and these Irish Catholic families were large. The rule in the past had always been to give it to the girl who most resembled the statue, and among Bernadette and her siblings, not that the boys ever had a chance, Bernadette was the clear winner: iron rust hair, dark blue eyes, a long, narrow nose.

A good chiste is, among other things, a defense against fear, despair, and the loneliness of not daring to speak your mind. In the most tense, uncomfortable, or frightening circumstances, a Guatemalan always seems to come forward with a chiste or two, delivered with an almost formal air, often in a recitative rush of words, the emphasis less in the voice, rarely raised, than in the hand gestures. Even when laughter is forced, it seems like a release. ",2007-09-30T07:16:00+0000

I need to bear witness to an uncertain event. I feel it roaring inside me - this thing that may not have taken place. I don't even know what name to put on it. I think you might call it a crime of the flesh, but the flesh is long fallen away and I am not sure what hurt may linger in the bones. ",2007-09-30T07:16:00+0000

us,"Brutes, Galoots and Thugs","THERES nothing more wonderful in literature than when a writer makes us feel deeply for a distasteful character. And theres nothing more hateful in literature than when a writer goes out of his way to make sure we know hes better  smarter, more sensitive, less boorish  than the characters hes writing about. The Scottish writer Irvine Welshs If You Liked School, Youll Love Work  is a collection of short stories (his first since The Acid House in 1995 ) largely about lamebrained men and the women who turn their heads  not a bad subject by itself, necessarily. But Welsh is the kind of writer who floats above the world scribbling passionately in his notebook, observing with great fascination the direction less, antlike creatures below him. Hes a wry observer but rarely a sympathizer: hes happy to describe the flaws of his fictional creations, but mostly, he seems happy hes not them. Or, to quote one of his Scottish characters: Good tae see yis, dinnae want tae be yis! ",2007-09-30T07:29:00+0000
us,Paperback Row,"MURDER IN AMSTERDAM: Liberal Europe, Islam and the Limits of Tolerance, by Ian Buruma. (Penguin, $15.) Buruma, who was born in the Netherlands but has lived mostly abroad for the past 30 years, has made a career of analyzing foreign cultures. Here he returns to his native land to examine the 2004 murder of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh. A Dutch-born Islamist of Moroccan descent shot van Gogh, angry at Submission, a film he had made with the Somali-born feminist Ayaan Hirsi Ali about the treatment of women under Islam. Buruma tries to understand why the Dutch multi cultural experiment has not gone well, despite the governments liberal immigration policies and lavish social services. More important than Islams influence, Buruma suggests, is the question of authority  in a society from which a young Moroccan male might find it easier to receive subsidies than respect.

Funny thing about mud, it smells exactly the same whether its being hurled from the left or the right.That said, I do wonder whether youre right in suggesting that the Times should have forced MoveOn.org to lose the Betray Us line as a condition of publication.Its my impression that the First Amendment protects, among other things, our right to make perfect fools of ourselves, and Im not sure The Times should be in the business of shielding political groups (or anyone else) from exposing themselves to richly justified ridicule.It would have been far better to publish the ad as submitted, while running an editorial, on the same day if possible, properly taking MoveOn.org to task for its savage characterization of an honorable soldier trying to make the best of an impossible mission.
