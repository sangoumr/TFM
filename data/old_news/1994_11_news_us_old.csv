Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Shoreham nuclear plant, plus newspaper headlines and highlights of the script over ominous music. Ends with photograph of Mr. Cuomo scratching his head. SCRIPT: Announcer: ""First, Mario Cuomo cut a cynical deal to buy votes with a $9 billion bailout of Lilco. Now he's cut another deal -- for Rudy Giuliani's support. Just three days after Giuliani's endorsement, The New York Times reported that Giuliani is already counting on $150 million more of your state tax dollars. Billions for Lilco, hundreds of millions for Giuliani and tax increases for us. Don't let Mario Cuomo buy this election with your money."" ACCURACY: The Governor has proposed a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, which would cost about $9 billion, to be financed through tax-exempt bonds. Politicians of many stripes and the financial markets greeted the idea skeptically. Mr. Cuomo contends a takeover would lead to lower electric rates, by eliminating shareholder dividends and Federal taxes the utility now pays. Mayor Giuliani's proposed budget modification, announced a day after his endorsement of the Governor, does depend on $150 million in new aid from Albany, although he and Mr. Cuomo insist they never discussed any deal, and no governor can deliver much in the way of state aid without the cooperation of the Legislature. Mr. Cuomo has proposed no tax increases. SCORECARD: Mr. Pataki is vulnerable to the charge -- by Mr. Giuliani and other local officials -- that his proposed state income tax cuts would force higher local taxes. This ad tries to turn that attack around, arguing that Mr. Cuomo is the taxer who is pitting different parts of the state against each other. In making that claim, of course, Mr. Pataki seeks to divide the state further, and energize his base in the upstate areas that have provided a growing share of the electorate. The ad's anti-tax message could hit home, as does its suggestion that the Lilco plan is an election-year gambit. But its conspiracy theory may strike voters as hard to believe, and it does nothing to sketch in Mr. Pataki's own personality or ideas. TODD S. PURDUM",1994-11-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Race for Governor: Cuomo Labels Pataki as Radical,"CANDIDATE Mario M. Cuomo (paid for by the New York State Democratic Committee) PRODUCER Axelrod & Associates, Chicago and Washington ON THE SCREEN Black-and-white scenes of State Senator George E. Pataki, Pat Robertson and a newspaper headline reading ""George is 100 percent 'right' according to Pat Robertson,"" then of assault weapons laid out together, as white letters on black background come zooming into view to highlight parts of script over ominous music. SCRIPT Announcer: ""The more you learn about George Pataki's friends, the more you wonder. As a State Senator, Pataki won the top rating from Pat Robertson's radical coalition, which preaches a ban on abortion and wants creationism taught in our schools. And now, the National Rifle Association's endorsed Pataki, who's opposed tougher gun laws, like the ban on assault weapons. The N.R.A., Pat Robertson and the radical right. If George Pataki's their man, can he really be ours?"" ACCURACY In 1993, Mr. Pataki did receive a 100 percent rating from the Christian Coalition, based on four votes: Medicaid funding for abortions, a bill that finances the Medicaid program through aid to local governments, the section of the budget that provided for postponing scheduled tax cuts and a bill on child pornography. This year, his rating was 83 percent. Mr. Pataki supports abortion rights, though he has voted consistently for restrictions. He says he supports a ban on assault weapons, but in April he voted against an amendment to a gun-licensing bill that included sharp restrictions on a number of assault weapons. At first, he denied the vote, then said it was procedural and now says it was a partisan vote with the Republican majority on a measure that did not go far enough. SCORECARD This is one of the harshest ads of the race, produced and paid for by the State Democratic Committee in part because the Governor's media adviser, David Garth, has opposed making such attacks. But for weeks now, Mr. Cuomo has sought to define Mr. Pataki as out of step with a state that retains a strong plurality of Democratic voters likely to reject a strongly conservative candidate, and polls suggest the Governor's attacks have been working. The risk is that the imputed link between Mr. Pataki and the Christian right is tenuous, and voters may be put off by the tough tone. TODD S. PURDUM",1994-11-02T05:00:00+0000

(AP) YACHT RACING One Australia Wins The new 75-foot yacht One Australia won the third race yesterday of the International America's Cup Class World Championship, but not without a battle to the finish with the all-women's team, America . The women's team led at the start of the 18.5-mile race off San Diego. The boat, skippered by J. J. Isler at the start, and later by Leslie Egnot, led six other cup yachts. But at the fourth mark in the six-stage race, John Bertrand, skipper of One Australia, passed America . A 17-knot wind, far brisker than the 5-6 knots that prevailed at the first two races of the championship, made the fight for first place all the more dramatic. One Australia crossed the start line prematurely, and had to re-round. In the meantime, America was off to a clean start, well ahead of One Australia on the right side of the course. After finally passing America , Bertrand found himself in a tough tactical battle, having to jibe back and forth to hold his slim lead in the fifth leg. At the finish, One Australia was 32 seconds ahead of America .",1994-11-03T05:00:00+0000

VIRGINIA -- Two new polls show that the race for Senate in Virginia is still unsettled in the final days and Senator Charles S. Robb may be gaining ground. Both suggest that the Democratic incumbent has overtaken his Republican challenger, Oliver L. North, but the leads are within the statistical margin of sampling error. The surveys were conducted by the Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research company and the Virginia Commonwealth University. Scott Keeter, a director of the Virginia Commonwealth poll, said that the most notable difference in the last two polls was a decline in the percentage of voters who said they trust Mr. North to tell the truth -- from 37 percent last month to 26 percent this time. One explanation, Dr. Keeter said, could be Nancy Reagan's comment last week that Mr. North ""lied to my husband and lied about him."" MICHIGAN -- Detroit's largest black-owned newspaper, The Michigan Chronicle, has sent shock waves through state political circles by endorsing Gov. John Engler, a conservative Republican, for re-election on its front page. While polls have shown Mr. Engler far ahead of his challenger, former Representative Howard Wolpe, the Governor has been even less popular than most Republicans among black voters. Indeed, he received only 13 percent of the vote in Detroit in 1990. The Chronicle, which has historically endorsed Democratic candidates, described Governor Engler as having shown a lack of ""compassion"" toward blacks, but said Mr. Wolpe had failed to describe how he would improve Michigan's economy. The editorial said black Americans want ""our civil rights recognized, but we also want to see a better return on our tax dollars.""",1994-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Santoro closed the gap to 20-12 when he scored from 8 yards out to cap the scoring in the third. In the fourth quarter, Jones returned a kick 94 yards to help Freeport extend its lead to 28-12.

Heartbeat Wrist-Radio","WHAT: The Polar Vantage XL, a wireless heart-rate monitor that looks like an ordinary wristwatch. The unseen component is an elastic chest belt containing two electrodes and a transmitter, which detects the heart's electrical signals and relays the data to a receiver housed within the watch. A digital readout of beats per minute is displayed instantaneously. This high-tech toy will be the status symbol for runners at today's New York Marathon.WHY DO I NEED A $400 SWATCH? So you can have the most efficient workout in the shortest amount of time. The prevailing wisdom has been that the ideal workout is a 20-minute regimen of aerobic exercise at 70 percent of your maximum heart rate (the maximum is determined by subtracting your age from 220). This regimen has since been debunked by the sports science community. Research now indicates that to achieve optimum fitness an individual should exercise in short, intense intervals (followed by a recovery period), maintaining a heart rate of 85 percent. Only a heart-rate monitor can give an accurate reading (to within one beat per minute).B.P. (BEFORE POLAR): In the mid-1970's, East Germany outfitted its cycling team with the first wireless heart-rate monitors. Transmitter belts were sewn into the athletes' jerseys. The belt used a radio antenna to transmit a signal to a receiver in a van following the cyclists. Coaches would listen to the heart rate through earphones, count the beats and plot the data on graph paper. By 1982, Dr. Seppo Saynajakangas, a professor of electronics at Oulu University in Finland, revolutionized sports training when he introduced the first generation of Polar heart-rate monitors. The monitors, manufactured by Polar CIC Inc. of Port Washington, L.I., are now available through most serious sports stores, including Paragon's, which sells the Polar Vantage XL for $389.WHAT, NO MOON PHASE? The Polar XL is more than a heart-rate monitor; it's a computer. In addition to providing heart-rate figures, it performs all chronograph functions and sounds alarms to let the wearer know when the heart rate creeps below or above a target zone. The XL also stores up to eight separate workouts. With the appropriate software, these data can be downloaded to a computer, where performance can be graphically displayed and evaluated.POLAROBICS: Anyone attending Heart Attack, a class at Crunch Fitness (54 East 13th Street, at Broadway), not only straps on a Polar heart-rate monitor, but also gets to sweat with Jim Wharton, one of the country's premiere exercise physiologists. Mr. Wharton has personally trained 33 Olympic athletes, 11 of whom went on to win medals. ""What people have to understand is that a heart-rate monitor is not just another exercise gimmick,"" Mr. Wharton said. ""This is the way world-class athletes have been training for the past decade.""HEART THROBS: High-profile celebrities and athletes who train with Polar monitors include Tom Hanks, Joe Montana, Sylvester Stallone, Pete Sampras, Cher, Dan Jansen and John Travolta. Polar heart-rate monitors are also used by the Pritikin Center in Santa Monica, Calif.; Duke University; Stanford University; the United States Army and Air Force; NASA, and health spas around the world.BETTER THAN A ROLEX: Mentally Tough, a training program that is designed to teach corporate competitors how to cope with stress, encourages executives to check their pulse frequently and recommends lowering heart rates through relaxation exercises. This crude form of biofeedback could be greatly enhanced by wearing a heart-rate monitor Example: When news of a hostile takeover breaks and your Polar reads 250 beats a minute, take several deep breaths and recite some W.

That mission failed disastrously, and as German film exports under the Nazis fell, Goebbels turned his efforts toward conquering the audience at home. His theory was that propaganda worked best when an audience didn't know it was there. So while emigrant German film makers like Fritz Lang successfully planted the roots of film noir in Hollywood, those who stayed behind were given the far more difficult task of transplanting the light, optimistic American style to the Third Reich -- of creating a dream factory in hell.",1994-11-06T05:00:00+0000

As the agency has grown, from an emergency self-help group in 1981 to an employer of 300, challenges have arisen from within and without over the organization's leadership and mission. Jim Fielding and Scott Melvin, who are producing the fliers, say they represent present and former G.M.H.C. workers, volunteers, clients and donors ""who have become disillusioned"" with some of its policies. But Daniel Wolfe, a G.M.H.C. spokesman, called them ""two disgruntled former employees with a fax machine"" and an ax to grind. The two, who left G.M.H.C. this year, led a failed attempt to unionize the staff, and Mr. Fielding has filed an AIDS discrimination suit against G.M.H.C. The fliers, mailed to a list of about 300, accuse G.M.H.C. of dropping its distribution of free condoms at gay bars and clubs. Mr. Wolfe said G.M.H.C. is simply asking bar and club owners to pay about eight cents a condom. B.L.",1994-11-06T05:00:00+0000

Ms. Andrews's sensitive, stirring collection of 70 black-and-white photographs with accompanying oral histories, FAMILY: A Portrait of Gay and Lesbian America (HarperSanFrancisco, paper, $25), is an important record of 20th-century gay life and a joy to read. From the conventional to the outlandish, Ms. Andrews portrays an extraordinary range of subjects: a World War II veteran, shyly proud in his American Legion cap; the pastor of the Full Truth Unity Fellowship of Christ Church, singing a gospel song, eyes closed in ecstasy; a cowboy, muscular and self-assured, who rides on the gay rodeo circuit; a lesbian garden club in Georgia called the Digging Dykes of Decatur; even a Mardi Gras ""krewe"" or club, featuring transvestites in Las Vegas-style beaded costumes. Though the more eccentric photos grab attention, the substance of the book lies in its soulful depiction of people as simply themselves. Ms. Andrews's portraits are filled with texture and natural light and reveal a skillful photographer who makes her subjects comfortable. The text conveys each person's story and manner of speaking, and varies from rambling to eloquent. ""Family"" affirms gay men and lesbians in all their diversity, while widening the reader's image of what a family can be. ANDREA COOPER",1994-11-06T05:00:00+0000

The top-seeded Sampras allowed the 157th-ranked player to take him to a first-set tie breaker, but then Van Herck could not handle the pressure play of Sampras. After winning the tie breaker, 7-2, the sluggish defending champion did just enough to take the second set at 6-4. ""I've had my better days,"" said Sampras, the world's top-ranked player, who is suffering from a throat infection. ""I feel depleted and I haven't eaten too much."" Tomorrow, he will face Richey Reneberg, who defeated David Wheaton, 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (7-9), 6-1. Jaime Yzaga of Peru, seeded eighth, beat the German qualifier Arne Thoms, 6-2, 7-6 (7-1), ending a string of upsets that had sent two seeded players home on the first day.

You land at McCarran Airport, rent your nondescript, air-conditioned Lanugo or Aquire or Flabia, crack open a roll of quarters, and you're ready to surf the treacherous metaphorical waters of the capital of the American dream. The American dream, distilled, is to get rich by turning nothing into something, no place into someplace.

Edgar Hoover and Emma Goldman. These 63 ""first encounters,"" which have appeared separately in The Atlantic Monthly over the past 12 years, prove how reliably fact can be stranger than fiction. Isak Dinesen and Marilyn Monroe got along fine. So did Houdini and Arthur Conan Doyle. Less compatible were the more celebrated pairings of Chopin and George Sand, Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, and Capt. John Smith and Pocahontas. But their stories, illustrated in color by Edward Sorel and retold spiritedly and concisely by Nancy Caldwell Sorel (they relate their own first meeting and subsequent marriage in an afterword), all benefit from a light touch. What is the book's most memorable meeting? Possibly the one between Fats Waller and Al Capone, who kidnapped the musician for a three-day party. Equally appealing, though it relies entirely on Welles's authority, is the story of the encounter between William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles in an elevator in the Fairmont Hotel the day of the San Francisco premiere of ""Citizen Kane."" Welles introduced himself and invited Hearst to attend, but was met with stony silence. As Hearst got off at his floor, Welles called after him: ""Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.""

us,"Many Fingers, Many Pies","In 1923 an affable high school dropout, Miguel Covarrubias (1904-57), arrived in New York from Mexico City armed with an extraordinary talent for drawing, a keen intellect, boundless curiosity and good connections. His gifts were immediately recognized by the likes of Carl Van Vechten and Frank Crowninshield, and he soon found work doing caricatures and illustrations for Vanity Fair and other leading magazines. Gallery shows, book publication and commissions for set designs followed. Rosa Roland was a celebrated dancer and choreographer when Covarrubias met her, but by the time they married in 1930, she had left the stage. A striking beauty photographed by, among others, Edward Weston and Cartier-Bresson, she became an accomplished painter, photographer and cook. In COVARRUBIAS (University of Texas, $29.95), Adriana Williams, an independent scholar, chronicles the lives and times of Miguel and Rosa Covarrubias with a veritable torrent of names, places and events. Most of the notable artists and intellectuals from the 1920's and 30's seem to have crossed their paths, either in New York, on their travels, or in Mexico City, where they moved in the mid-30's. Their wide range of friends included Al Hirschfeld, Nelson Rockefeller, Diego Rivera and John Huston. Covarrubias was fascinated by the ethnic roots of culture and eager to experience authentic forms of dance, music and art before they were lost to the leveling effect of modern life. This passion not only enriched his art -- from the Harlem drawings to his murals for San Francisco's 1938 international exposition -- but also led to books on Balinese culture and the archeology of Mexico. Ms. Williams has not worked this rich material into an authoritative biography, but the abundant information she has gathered should serve future biographers well.

Except for the loss to George Mason in the 1985 championship game, North Carolina has captured the title every year since the N.C.A.A. instituted the women's tournament in 1982. After a fairly close game before intermission, the Tar Heels erupted for four goals in the second half to hand Notre Dame (22-1-1) its only loss of the season. The Tar Heels finished at 25-1-1, with their only loss coming against Duke and their tie against Notre Dame earlier in the season. MEN'S SOCCER Two Upsets as N.C.A.A. Play Starts Two big upsets marked the first round of the N.C.A.A. Division I men's tournament yesterday.

Virginia, the defending by beat North Carolina-Greensboro, 3-0. WOMEN'S BASKETBALL Tennessee Takes Tip-Off Classic Dana Johnson scored 10 points in a 14-2 run that started the second half yesterday, helping top-ranked Tennessee to a 69-62 victory over Louisiana Tech at the State Farm Hall of Fame Tip-Off Classic in Jackson, Tenn. The run pulled the Lady Vols (1-0) ahead, 45-32. They built the cushion to 60-43 before the Lady Techsters took advantage of 5 turnovers to score 11 straight points and cut the lead to 60-54 with 47 seconds left. Debra Williams, who finished with 23 points, had 5 during that run. Louisiana Tech was forced to foul at that point, and point guard Michelle Marciniak hit 4 straight free throws to put Tennessee out of reach, 68-59, with 30 seconds left. (AP) FIELD HOCKEY James Madison Triumphs in Overtime Gwen Stoltzfus's shot in overtime clinched James Madison's 2-1 victory over top-ranked North Carolina for the N.C.A.A. field hockey championship yesterday in Brookline, Mass. After two scoreless 15-minute overtimes, Stoltzfus clinched James Madison's first crown in the stroke-off when she beat North Carolina goalkeeper Jana Withrow with a hard, low shot. The Dukes (20-3-1) won the shootout, 4-2. No. 1 North Carolina finished 21-2.

After settling into fourth place early in yesterday's mile-and-an-eighth race, Tabasco Cat, the 2-1 favorite with Pat Day aboard, found room to rally along the rail at the top of the stretch, but he had no punch and dropped back. River Flyer, ridden by Chris Antley, won his fourth straight race on the turf in 1:472/5 and paid $10 for $2 to win. Dare and Go took second. GOLF 3 Weeks, 3 Championships for Ozaki Jumbo Ozaki birdied the final hole yesterday for his third victory in three weeks, a one-shot triumph over Tom Watson in the Dunlop Phoenix event in Miyazaki, Japan.

Watson missed three birdie putts in a row from less than 8 feet on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes and left a tying 25-foot eagle putt on the last hole 2 feet short.

Urbane Cowboys Need Not Apply","WHAT: Wrangler Cowboy Cut blue jeans, the favorite style of rodeo competitors, country music singers, hangers-on and cowboy wannabees in the Southwest.WHY: While Levi's is hoping to build a market with its new line of customized, computer-styled jeans, Cowboy Cut fans don't need a computer to know what they like. Wrangler does not ship its Cowboy Cut jeans to the Northeast, where the company says no market for the style exists, but in Texas the jeans are as common as gun racks. Nearly every detail of these jeans, originally designed 50 years ago by a Philadelphia tailor known as Rodeo Ben, is based on the very specific demands of real-life cowboys. Rodeo Ben sewed 12 prototypes before one finally satisfied all of Wrangler's requirements, which is why the number 13 is stamped on the inside label. The MWZ next to it stands for ""men's western zipper,"" which set the Wranglers apart from the button-fly jeans. The two W's on the back pockets stand for western wear.WHY PLUMBERS SHOULD WEAR WRANGLERS: They are cut two inches higher in the back than in the front, partly to allow for a big ol' belt buckle, but also to prevent rear cleavage from showing, since traditionally very few cowboys wear underwear. (This is also why Wrangler shirts have extralong shirttails.)WHY PEOPLE SAY THEY WEAR THEM: Naturally, the jeans are cut a bit wider in the leg to allow for cowboy boots underneath. They also have two extra belt loops in the back so that a belt stays exactly where it should. The opening to the small pocket on the right front hip is positioned so the belt will cover it; this keeps keys or a pocket watch from flying out during bull riding (or while taking a cab to La Guardia). And since the rear pockets are positioned a bit higher, the wearer also won't be, in the words of one cowboy, ""a-settin' on your wallet."" Finally, the inseams on Wranglers are rolled and soft, unlikely to chafe a wearer who is on horseback all day.THE REAL REASON: Wrangler uses the biggest, toughest zipper in the industry, a No. 5, so that the pants can function like a reinforced corset, meeting the demand for the tightest possible fit. The higher- positioned rear pockets accentuate the positive, and to ease the eye-popping sensation somewhat for the wearer, the hole for the top fly button can be safely cut to the very edge of the seam, giving a crucial half-inch of breathing space. This bit of cheating is well hidden, of course, beneath the belt buckle.WHY WOMEN PREFER TO WEAR MEN'S WRANGLERS: Not only are the jeans cut so that they hold the hips in and curve the rear out, but most wearers also appreciate that tiny bit of roominess in the crotch.HOW THEY SHOULD BE WORN: Cowboys buy them in threes: one pair a size larger for practice riding, one pair the correct size for rodeo competition and one pair a size too small to wear out at night. Whatever the size, the jeans must be way too long so that they drape heavily around the wearer's boots. A cowboy doesn't want to look lame in high-water pants while he's busy defying death, and neither should you.LYNN SNOWDEN",1994-11-27T05:00:00+0000

If so, they were a bit slow on the uptake -- it had been a full week since the Federal Reserve gave its latest shove to rates. There was also talk that weakness in ""cyclical"" stocks -- the ones that rely on a strong economy -- yanked the wider market down. But a lot of it is probably just trigger-happy traders: no economy is as bumpy as this market.

Kennedy, and almost without realizing it found himself a member of a campaign in those early days when few people bothered to turn out for Kennedy appearances. Only slowly, he recalls, did he come to realize that ""we"" were running for President. The 1960 election won, J.F.K. asked Lowe to stick around and record his Administration. Given carte blanche to roam the White House, Mr. Lowe amassed, in the end, some 40,000 negatives of the Camelot years, what he calls ""the most complete photographic record of any Administration in American history"" in his selection of these shots, JFK REMEMBERED (Random House, $37.50). His commentary, witty and just a bit offbeat, accompanies stunning photographs, some familiar, some never before published. Mr. Lowe lends a new dimension to some of the era's most historic moments: the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Bay of Pigs discussions, the Paris meeting with Charles de Gaulle when the French leader used every ruse to keep the photographer away, the Khrushchev summit in Vienna with the Russian leader totally charmed by Mrs. Kennedy while the President looked miserable with Mrs. Khrushchev. Always at Kennedy's heels, the photographer was inevitably drawn into the private moments; the President insisted that Mr. Lowe take pictures of his daughter, Caroline, knowing that her mother did not want the children photographed. We have finally a personal retrospective on Kennedy history, private and public. In his foreword, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. writes that he recognized in Lowe a fellow historian ""with a passion to record actualities -- not to reconstruct for the sake of a prettier photograph.""

They represent a long-overdue correction of the ills of the past, in which minority groups were ignored, sex was taboo and gender was covered only in grammar.

Although their effect on world history is dubious, and the facts of their lives even more so, parental pressure groups should enjoy them immensely.""Georgie Has 22 Daddies, 36 Mommies and 13 Relatives He's Not Sure Of"" -- Sensitively told and beautifully illustrated, this book will teach children to no longer be ashamed of parents who are into group sex.""The Nontraditional, Nonsexist, Nondenominational, Nonreligious Christmas Book"" -- Fun for all ages. Santa allows her elves to unionize, asks parents for permission before sliding down their chimneys and replaces candy canes on trees with carrot sticks. In the book's heartwarming finale, Santa gives all politically correct boys and girls unisex dolls, and is rewarded for her generosity with soy burgers and wheat-grass juice.""Mr. Condom's Fun Book"" -- The lovable Mr. Condom teaches prepubescent children that the prophylactic is a friend through the use of many fun activities.""Ms. Dinosaur's Monthly Cramps"" -- Take a subject that's fascinating to all children: dinosaurs. Add morals about menstruation and masturbation and what have you got? A book that teaches kids to hate both sex and dinosaurs.""1001 Boring Activities for Kids That Parents Will Find Educational"" -- Written by people who give their own children underwear instead of toys for presents, this book contains games and activities that involve no mess, no competition, no undue excitement and no fun. In fact, the most stimulating activity this book will prompt children to do is to tear it apart by page three.""Some of My Best Friends Are Height-Challenged Gypsies With Leather Fixations"" -- A dull yet meaningful book in which people of all sizes, shapes, colors, ethnic backgrounds and sexual persuasions get along in peace and harmony (unlike most parents and school board members).
