us,Business Diary: November 26 - December 3,"THE ECONOMY If the Numbers Don't Lie, America's Going Back to Work Is it as good news as it seems that the nation's unemployment rate plunged from 6.8 percent to 6.4 percent in November? Skeptics were quick to say that for complicated statistical reasons, the progress reported by the Labor Department last week was almost surely overstated, and financial markets shrugged it off. But with any kind of faith, what you see is a stunning number -- the biggest improvement in a decade, and a compelling sign that this on-again, off-again economy is at last performing its most basic function: creating jobs. Employers added jobs from California to Florida to New York, and most places in between -- and they were more likely to be full-time jobs, too. As those of you with jobs well know, companies have been putting off hiring and leaning on existing workers, uncertain about things like medical costs, but this news may show that they just couldn't hold out any longer. An Economy on a Spree It's more than jobs. The economic engine keeps gaining speed as it barrels toward that year-end blowout -- which long ago, rumor has it, was some sort of religious celebration. But once Christmas is past, will the vigor survive? Economists are cautious. Last week, though, the numbers were strong: income, construction spending, and factory orders all up, the purchasing managers' index showing the fastest growth since last winter. There were some blips: new-home sales were off, but that followed a surge the month before, so housing still looks good. And retail sales rose just slightly -- but of course any shoppers worth their credit cards would not dream of going wild till it's almost Christmas. Tired of Waiting for S.& L. Job It's clearly liberating to be nominated for a Government job and then decide it isn't worth jumping through all the hoops. Stanley Tate, named in July to head the Resolution Trust Corporation, but still awaiting a confirmation hearing, didn't mince words last week when he called it quits. ""Washington,"" he said, ""is a vicious city, with all kinds of hidden agendas. It is a city full of rumors, allegations and accusations."" And why did his nomination die? Because he's a Republican? Because Bill Clinton didn't back him fully? Or because there was something to the ""serious questions"" that Donald Riegle, Senate Banking chairman, had about Mr. Tate? Mr. Tate's version: bureaucrats were afraid he'd root out mismanagement. Whatever the reason, Mr. Tate, a Florida developer, said he felt ""disposable and dispensable."" And the bailout agency just keeps on drifting. Mending Hubble, Mending NASA If NASA were a corporation, it would long since have become an obscure Wal-Mart subsidiary. It's made one cosmic gaffe after another: the Challenger disaster, the flawed Hubble Space Telescope, the apparent kidnapping of the Mars Observer by little green spacepersons. It's no understatement to say, as one space expert did last week, ""NASA can't afford another highly visible failure."" So the pressure's on the astronauts on the shuttle Endeavour, which lifted off on Thursday. The astronauts' mission: to fix Hubble in mid-space, essentially by putting a pair of eyeglasses on it. If they succeed, secrets of the universe could snap into focus; if they fail, the focus will be on NASA's jugular. But as one Hubble scientist put it, ""This is not like going to Grandma's to fix a leaky faucet."" OPEC, Where Is Thy Sting? Twenty years ago, OPEC seemed sure to strangle America with ever-higher oil prices. But last week it was clear just how times had changed. After slipping all year, oil prices plunged to a five-year low after OPEC failed to agree to cut output. So gasoline, steadily cheaper in 1973 dollars, seems likely to get cheaper still, which would help the economy. But everything has a cost, and cheaper gas means auto makers are less likely to put their efforts into making more efficient cars. Victor Posner Is Out of Play It was an unusual penalty, but the judge said the scope of the violations justified it. Saying they ""have had a long and notorious history of engaging in self-dealing and corporate waste,"" a Federal judge last week banned Victor Posner and his son, Steven, from serving as officers or directors of any public company. The order came in a civil suit brought by the S.E.C. as part of a broader case against Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, and it involved charges that the Posners made secret stock deals with Mr. Boesky. In light of past abuses, the judge said, another warning ""would serve little purpose."" COMPANIES Paying a Price for Family Values Family values. So simple a term, yet so laden with subtext. On the surface, it means apple pie, caring, a cozy hearth; but it can also be a code phrase for excluding, condemning, even denying the existence of anything but cookie-cutter Americans. Normally, to cry ""family values"" is just free speech, but in Texas last week, the price was high. Apple Computer planned to build an $80 million office complex north of Austin, creating 1,500 jobs. But county officials rejected a $750,000 tax abatement, citing Apple's policy of granting health benefits to employees' unmarried partners, and Apple took its blueprints and hit the road. Sony's Pain, And the World's In 1946, in a bombed-out Tokyo department store, a young man named Akio Morita helped found the Sony Corporation. Since then, as both Sony and Japan grew mighty, Mr. Morita became, in one American's words, the world's ""leading Japanese business statesman."" So it is symbolic that as Japan's phenomenal half-century shows distinct wear and tear, Sony's chairman falters. Last week Mr. Morita, 72, underwent brain surgery, and he may have to retire. That would be bad news for Sony, where, even removed from day-to-day operations, he remained the ""psychological backbone."" And it would be bad news abroad, for Mr. Morita has played a leading role in smoothing trade tensions with America. Volvo Vants to Be Alone The planned Volvo-Renault merger created serious friction at Volvo. Many executives wanted to back out, loath to let Sweden lose one of its corporate stars. But the chairman, Pehr Gyllenhammar, stuck to the plan, seeing strength in having a European partner. Last week Mr. Gyllenhammar lost his fight: The merger was called off, and he quickly resigned, saying that Volvo's managers had ""turned their backs on Europe."" Job Cuts: A Weekly Ritual It almost stops being news, squarely in a class with ""Dog Bites Man."" Another week, and more corporate giants cut thousands of jobs. Last week was no exception. A. T.& T. may cut as many as 4,500 jobs as the long-distance wars take their toll. And airline woes continue to seep through to Boeing, which will cut production, meaning a loss of up to 3,000 jobs. Even the beer industry is pulling in its belly, as Miller said it would close a plant in upstate New York, eliminating 900 jobs. G.M. Downsizes Its Data Saturated with economic numbers? Good news: Detroit is going to spare you some. Much as eager-beaver pundits crave the latest word, General Motors decided last week that 10-day sales reports were overkill and would scrap them in January; Ford will probably follow suit. Chrysler went to monthly figures a couple of years ago, but then some helpful souls started estimating 10-day sales. While some analysts found the figures useful, most were relieved. ""About time,"" said one. INTERNATIONAL Again, Hope for World Trade Your eyes glaze over at the words ""Uruguay Round""? You're forgiven: these trade talks have long since taken on a Dickensian dimension. Begun seven years ago to lower tariffs worldwide, the talks have hit more snags than ""Bleak House"" has characters. But yet again last week the tireless negotiators, including Mickey Kantor of the United States, cried, ""Breakthrough!"" One snag has been French objections to cutting farm subsidies, but a resolution may be at hand. If there is an accord, it could do much for the world economy. But that's still a big ""if."" Trade progress is possible, though: last week Canada's new Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dropped his opposition to Nafta.

Unless care is taken, the house tends to dictate a formal treatment, exquisite in its own time but hardly livable by modern standards. The architects Carey Maloney and Hermes Mallea of M (Group) of Manhattan, along with the owners of this Chelsea town house, have refused to succumb to period drag. The double-parlor floor and the garden level have become a self-contained duplex for the owners. The furnishings are anything but historically correct: Stripped, gilded, polished and generally taken out of context (a mirrored vanity is now a bar), once common pieces are now head-turners. A subtly subversive color scheme -- apricot living-room walls, a deep shrimp-pink sofa -- tones down the imposing grandeur.

Ranked 22d and unseeded, Ferreira broke Becker once in each set to win, 7-5, 6-4, in 1 hour 37 minutes in Munich, Germany. The seventh-seeded Becker's ground strokes lacked consistency and confidence, his volleys were erratic and his 13 aces were nearly erased by 10 double-faults. Two straight double-faults by Becker gave Ferreira a key break in the 11th game. Becker also announced that Eric Jelen, a longtime friend who became his sixth coach less than six months ago, had decided to end the partnership. Becker has now gone through four coaches in nearly three years. (AP) N.F.L. Johnson Cites a Weakness: Coaching A grim Jimmy Johnson has decided that one of the main problems with the Dallas Cowboys is coaching. Johnson came to that conclusion yesterday, the day after the Cowboys struggled to a 23-17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in Irving, Tex. The victory kept them a game behind the National Football Conference East-leading Giants with an 8-4 record. ""It's not the effort and the talent of the players,"" Johnson said. ""We've got to do a better job of coaching. It took a 172-yard rushing effort from Emmitt Smith to save the Cowboys against the Eagles."" (AP) FIGURE SKATING N.H.L. Verbeek Scores 3 to Lead Whalers Pat Verbeek had three goals and Sean Burke enjoyed a successful return to the goal as the streaking Whalers beat the Washington Capitals, 6-1, in Landover, Md., last night. Verbeek scored twice and Geoff Sanderson added his 18th goal in the first period to help Hartford take a 3-0 lead. That proved to be more than enough offense for Burke, who stopped 30 shots in his first start since Oct. 27. The Whalers led, 6-0, after two periods. Hartford is 5-2 in its last seven games after a 4-14-2 start. Burke, plagued by hamstring problems, was playing in only his third game of the season. (AP) Blues 3, Blackhawks 2: Curtis Joseph had another oustanding game in goal for host St. Louis, making 37 saves. The Blues were outshot by 39-18 but had the trump card in Joseph. Last season he faced 2,202 shots, more than any goaltender since the league began keeping that statistic in 1982-83, and his shots-per-game average of 34 is above last year's figure of 32.4. (AP) Flames 4, Nordiques 4: Gary Roberts scored his second goal of the game with 2:12 left in regulation, giving Calgary the tie. Rookie Iain Fraser had a pair of first-period goals and Valery Kamensky snapped a tie 1:59 into the third period for the Nordiques. (AP) Panthers 3, Mighty Ducks 2: Scott Mellanby and Jesse Belanger scored less than three and a half minutes apart in the first period as Florida beat host Anaheim in the first meeting between the expansion teams. The Ducks lost for the fifth time in six games since their four-game winning streak through Canada and have dropped all seven games they have played against teams that entered the league after the 1990-91 season. The Ducks also lost leading scorer Anatoli Semenov with a dislocated left elbow.

At CBGB on Thursday night, Mark Hennessy sang his lyrics in a deep, bleak baritone growl; Grant Fitch on guitar, Charles Bryan on bass and Peter Fitch on drums blasted out belligerent, bulldozing riffs. But while Paw's songs often start out thrashing, they don't stay that way; heavy-metal verses give way to choruses and bridges that ease back into folk-rock and sometimes hint at country-rock. Often, Paw (which comes from Lawrence, Kan.) does what might be called a reverse Nirvana; where Nirvana's songs often start out quietly and break into a roar, Paw's songs move from metal to melody. The music's colliding styles match shifting emotions in the lyrics. On Paw's album, ""Dragline"" (A & M Records), Mr. Hennessy sings about anger and trust, about breaking connections and trying to save them, about the inevitability of death. In ""Jessie,"" the singer is trying to run away from home, but his dog follows him; in ""Lolita,"" a father romances and denounces the daughter he has abused. ""Sleeping Bag"" juxtaposes an attempted suicide and an auto accident; in ""Pansy,"" an old man howls, ""I just want to lay down long enough to die!"" Mr. Hennessy's conviction, and his ability to distill situations into terse, allusive lyrics, make him a rival of Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. And Paw's music, unsettled but carefully shaped, suits a band that distrusts its only inheritance.",1993-12-08T05:00:00+0000

Among the brightest are Peggy's Lee 1960 version of ""The Christmas Song,"" Margaret Whiting's 1949 ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" and Lena Horne's 1966 ""What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?"" The album also has its share of fatuity by performers like the Lettermen (a bland ""Christmas Waltz"") and Dean Martin (a terminally blase ""White Christmas"").

Is it any wonder that the scent in the air at the spring collections was the aroma of apprehension? Wariness wafted through tents and showrooms the way the smell of lilies drifts over the Loire in May. Few designers embraced any one idea and went runwaying with it. Most offered some of this, some of that and something else just in case. Here are six to consider. Last season's free fall into shapelessness has been refined to a supple and body-conscious liquidity. The collections of Dries van Noten and Victor Alfaro displayed such ease as to actually revive the word pretty. Donna Karan eliminated all flouncy flourishes for a sleekness reminiscent of her earliest best work. Todd Oldham, pared down to his simplest, revealed a lush femininity. Issey Miyake's separates miraculously became an inseparable whole. Gianni Versace floated through a Ziegfeld dream.

Shades of Blue","Not only can't white men jump, they can't play the blues either -- at least in the opinion of some of the 11 critics whose contributions are included in the voluminous history NOTHING BUT THE BLUES: The Music and the Musicians (Abbeville, $45). For example, Jim O'Neal exhumes a stereotype when he writes: ""White performers could play the music, sing the lyrics and express personal emotions within a blues framework with all degrees of talent and sincerity, but only those born to the blues culture could deliver the blues as defined by B. B. King's 'Why I Sing the Blues.' "" As other contributors note, however, the blues has served as an ""incestuous"" musical relationship between the races since its beginnings. ""Nothing but the Blues,"" edited by Lawrence Cohn, who compiled the Grammy-winning ""Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings,"" also shows that even the so-called experts cannot agree on what the genre is or where it began. However, besides the photographs, and the inspiring design by Molly Shields, chapters by Mark A. Humphrey and Charles Wolfe are insightful contributions to the scholarship on the blues. Still, some evident prejudices by some of the essayists rankle. The essays by Samuel Charters and David Evans give off the moldy whiff of academia. And Mary Katherine Aldin, writing about ""the blues today,"" manages to give but a single reference to Stevie Ray Vaughan. When she writes that ""not a single young artist is carrying on the tradition of, say, John Lee Hooker,"" one wants to tell her to turn on the radio.TOM GRAVES",1993-12-12T05:00:00+0000

us,London Calling,"Chronically underfinanced but consistently creative, the London shows always seem to run a distant fourth to Paris, New York and Milan. But the spring '94 collections prove, without a doubt, the importance of British fashion. The designers, a geographically diverse group from Sri Lanka and Hong Kong as well as nooks and crannies all over Britain, showed a cross-section of clothes and accessories that ranged from wacky to wearable. While the styles were in sync with worldwide trends -- slip dresses, sheer layering, fluid lines, pastel colors -- offbeat fabrics like stretch silks and seersucker knits made them unique. In cases where more traditional fabrics were used, they were often twisted, unraveled and turned inside out. Alas, while few of the clothes shown in London will actually make their way into American department stores, the six designers on these pages are making a successful leap across the Atlantic. SELINA BLOW Luxurious Fabrics and attention to details are the essentials of Blow's elegant designs. A sense of wit pokes through, but Blow's jackets are successful because of their timeless style and because they shun theatrics and focus on clean silhouettes. Here, a full length damask coat from Blow's sprint-summer collection. ELLIS FLYTE Ellis Flyte and Richard Ostell teamed up six seasons ago to create a collection of timeless, easy pieces. Their off-center, affordable classics have carved out a comfortable niche in the American retail market. This year, in their first runway show, they emphasized stretch silks, bias cuts and subtle colors ranging from soft cream to sand to a deep indigo. JOHN ROCHA His clothing sells well in more than 21 countries. Known primarily for his knitwear, the Hong Kong-born designer mixes textures the same way he mixes cultural references: his version of a silk chiffon kimono ties with a belt that is woven with a Celtic cross. ABE HAMILTON Like many English designers, Hamilton works in almost Dickensian digs. His humble studio, right, reflects the simplicity of his collection. A former chef, he spins cloth and appliques flowers as he once spun sugar and decorated cakes. Hamilton also hand-paints fabrics for gently deconstructed dresses. GHOST Ghost owner Tanya Sarne is no ethereal being, but a real-live source of style and substance. The line -- a mix of body-hugging shapes and loose silhouettes -- is such a commercial success that the company was able to stage a second show during the recent New York collections. PHILIP TREACY Philip Treacy is used to the big time. For several seasons, top designers like Valentino and Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel have summoned him to Paris to accessorize their collections. Last month, the milliner decided to strike out on his own. In his new London studio, Treacy custom-designs sensible hats as well as his signature over-the-top toques.",1993-12-19T05:00:00+0000

Giant Steps","Alvin Ailey's choreography carves out the stage with giant leaps and stretches. Jack Mitchell, who has photographed Ailey's dance company since 1961, has captured the excitement of an Ailey performance in ALVINAILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER / JACK MITCHELL PHOTOGRAPHS (Donna Martin/Andrews & McMeel, cloth, $29.95; paper, $19.95). Miguel Godreau nearly leaps off the page in the ""Sinner Man"" solo from ""Revelations."" Exuberance bursts from every line of Elizabeth Roxas's body in ""The Lark Ascending,"" not to mention her expression. There are no tight little smiles in the Ailey repertory. The dancers' warmth is all the more remarkable considering the circumstances in which they often had to work. During the company's first tours, they frequently danced on makeshift floors and didn't know where they were going to spend the night, according to DANCING SPIRIT: An Autobiography (Doubleday, $25), the memoir of Judith Jamison, who became the company's artistic director shortly after Ailey's death in 1989. Written with the poet Howard Kaplan, the book is filled with rare pictures from Ms. Jamison's personal collection. Ms. Jamison was one of Ailey's outstanding dancers, and he took full advantage of her extraordinary body when creating such signature works as ""Cry."" Although Ms. Jamison lavishes praise on Ailey and her fellow dancers, she offers little insight into the choreographic process. Recounting how Ulysses Dove mercilessly made her rehearse despite the fact that she had four steel pins in her hip, her only comment is, ""He challenges the dancers."" Frustrating as this kind of circumspection can be -- Ms. Jamison spends all of a paragraph on her own failed marriage -- her book is a refreshing change from the graphic tell-alls that dancers have published in recent years.HANNA RUBIN",1993-12-19T05:00:00+0000

No one can deny Horowitz's genius. Much of his music making was exquisite. But much of it was just awful.

For even as political flash fires flare worldwide, the business world is rapidly making borders irrelevant -- a reality negotiators recognized in cutting many tariffs and moving toward ending subsidies. The goal was clear: raise everyone's living standards. And the cheers were equally clear. ""The world has chosen openness and cooperation,"" said Peter Sutherland, GATT's director general. There was also a sense that in the deadline dash, negotiators lopped off anything sticky -- like a late spat over European limits on American movies -- to deal with another day. President Clinton met his ""fast track"" goal, however -- Congress must vote ""yes"" or ""no,"" not amend the pact to death. A comment by France's Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, best captures the mood: ""I never want to hear the word GATT again.""",1993-12-19T05:00:00+0000

The apparent Western air -- the glitzy boutiques in the Ginza, the English-language signs everywhere -- leads many visitors to the quick conclusion that this is a familiar place, albeit one so sprawling that getting around is a bit intimidating. In fact, getting around is a cinch, with an outstanding subway and train system.

Of course, this wasn't the first time the industry had fixated on a single city. In the late 60's all ears were on San Francisco's psychedelic groups; a decade later, the minimalist, punk-inspired bands of the East Village in New York drew national attention. In the 80's, the pace of discovery reached breakneck speed: Minneapolis, then Athens, Ga., then Austin, Tex., then Chapel Hill, N.C.

us,New & Noteworthy Paperbacks,"STELLA By Peter Wyden. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. The woman of the title was a classmate of the author's in a Jewish school in prewar Berlin. Ultimately, she made a horrific moral compromise: To save her parents and herself, she became a Nazi collaborator. Last year our reviewer, Alexander Stille, called the book a ""powerful and fascinating story."" THE ENGLISH PATIENT By Michael Ondaatje. Vintage International, $11. Four people are left in an abandoned Italian villa used as a hospital toward the end of World War II: a thief turned military spy, an emotionally scarred nurse, the Sikh soldier who is her lover, and, finally, a dying pilot burned beyond recognition, who may or may not be the Englishman he claims to be. This novel, winner of Britain's Booker Prize and chosen one of the best books of 1992 by The New York Times Book Review, is ""a tale of many pleasures -- an intensely theatrical tour de force, but grounded in Michael Ondaatje's strong feeling for distant times and places,"" Judith Grossman said here. This feeling is also reflected in Mr. Ondaatje's 1982 memoir, RUNNING IN THE FAMILY (Vintage International, $10), which describes the author's Dutch-Ceylonese ancestry and his return in the 1970's to Sri Lanka, where he was born. One critic said, ""His consciously blurred memory is the artistic triumph of this splendid book."" BOOK: A Novel By Robert Grudin. Penguin, $10. Anyone who has ever been associated with academia knows that what is dry and scholarly to others is life and death here. Such is the case at the University of Washagon, where an unfashionably traditional professor is subjected to both intellectual and physical attack. We ""marvel at the cleverness of the author's structural artifice,"" Sven Birkerts said here last year. More satire of university life is to be found in TILL THE FAT LADY SINGS, by Alisa Kwitney (Aaron Asher Books/Harper Perennial, $10), in which female Columbia students with various eating disorders grapple with questions of literature and love. Last year our reviewer, Maxine Chernoff, found it ""a bright and engrossing novel."" ARCHITECTURE: The Natural and the Manmade By Vincent Scully. St. Martin's, $24.95. One of the most renowned educators in the field expounds on his favorite subject, surveying the history of human edifices and analyzing the evolving relationship between the landscape and what we build upon it. ""His book throws new light on human attitudes to nature and will make an indelible impression on anyone who cares about architecture,"" Sir Keith Thomas said here in 1991. For those who care specifically about the buildings of the urban Southwest, there is L.A. LOST & FOUND: An Architectural History of Los Angeles, by Sam Hall Kaplan (Crown, $19), in which the author discusses certain forms indigenous to that city. Helped by the work of the book's principal photographer, Julius Shulman, he ""provides a lively, streamlined chronology,"" our reviewer, Julie V. Iovine, said in 1987. Also out in paperback is FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT, by Meryle Secrest (Harper Perennial, $15), a biography that is more about the architect's life than his work. Writing in these pages last year, Thomas S. Hines found the author at her best in analyzing the women surrounding Wright: ""Ms. Secrest is so good at interpreting these relationships that her book reads at times like an upscale romance novel."" HER MONSTER By Jeff Collignon. Soho, $10. A grossly misshapen man isolates himself in a cabin, where he supports himself by writing fiction. Ultimately, love -- in the form of a young woman who has never seen him but is interested in his plight -- comes knocking. ""The result is a moving and unforgettable first novel,"" Scott Bradfield said here last year. ANNA: A Daughter's Life By William Loizeaux. Arcade, $9.95. This is a journal about the author's first child, born with a series of congenital defects that ultimately proved fatal. Earlier this year our reviewer, Helen Epstein, said, ""This is honest writing that chooses to risk pathos and embarrassment rather than rewrite reality."" MOTOR CITY By Bill Morris. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $10. At a Buick plant in the 1950's, the obsessions range from industrial espionage to Elvis. The author has ""a gift for delineating his characters' inner lives,"" Michiko Kakutani said in The New York Times last year. KWANZAA: An African-American Celebration of Culture and Cooking By Eric V. Copage. Quill/William Morrow, $12. The author, an editor at The New York Times Magazine, describes his discovery of the meaning of this mid-winter, African-influenced festival in his own life, offering up anecdotes and extensive recipes. In 1991 our reviewer, Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor, called the book ""the best celebration of a holiday I've ever read."" WOMEN OF THE SILK By Gail Tsukiyama. St. Martin's, $11.95. Before the rise of Communism in China, female workers were subject to other kinds of tyranny. The heroine of this novel, Pei, is one of many who was forced by poverty to toil long hours in a silk factory. Last year our reviewer, Fran Handman, found the book ""straightforward and fast moving, its prose succinct and delicate."" SANTIAGO AND THE DRINKING PARTY By Clay Morgan. Penguin, $10. In this novel, the author interprets Latin America's reputation for being a land of the fantastic as a fiction spun by both natives and visitors for their own ends. It is ""an affectionate parody of magical realism,"" Ilan Stavans said here last year. LAUREL GRAEBER",1993-12-19T05:00:00+0000

There is grief, nostalgia, some mourning perhaps, a making of peace, a wakelike revelry, and finally, a passage in hope and trepidation into the unknown. ",1993-12-26T05:00:00+0000

The real Hollywood seductions are'nt the ones we see on the screen but the dramas in restaurants, settings with their own kind of stagy, tricked-up opulence where talent and studio come together. That's why Australian director Jocelyn Moorehouse is sitting in the ivy on a Sunday in late September. The Ivy id one of Hollywood's more tasteful places. There's painted country furniture against white plastered walls. Indian baskets, majolica plates. Moorehouse is lovely. She has fine, pale skin and dark hair. Her arms, bared in a green blouse, have a hint of motherly roundness. Last year, she made ""Proof,"" a rather experimental film about a blind photographer.

He discovered his toy in the early 1960's, around the time Leo Castelli gave him his first one-man show, and after that he was scarcely to be caught painting without it. Indeed, even though Diane Waldman, the author of ROY LICHTENSTEIN (Guggenheim Museum/Rizzoli, $59.95) -- the hefty, bright catalogue for the artist's retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum through Jan. 16 -- quotes him as saying, ""I want my painting to look as if it has been programmed. I want to hide the record of my hand,"" he obviously has had no such luck. The Benday dots are the record of his own hand, and it is one of the most recognizable hands around. Conveniently for Ms. Waldman, the Guggenheim's deputy director, who is sometimes a bit too ponderous about her subject, Mr. Lichtenstein's untroubled and uncomplicated life's work fits neatly into thematic chapters: his caricatures of comic strips, of advertisements, landscapes, brush strokes, mirrors, entablatures, still lifes, various Expressionist, Surrealist and Futurist paintings, and interiors of suburban houses. We see the artist latching onto a theme, playing it out and then easing into the next theme, often looking casually backward to incorporate elements of his past paintings into the new ones. The amazing thing is that regardless of Mr. Lichtenstein's subject he has been able to hold the same ironic pose for 30 years without flinching. His consistent style serves somewhat the same role as a person with an unchangeably wry expression. Just as the wry look seems to take on different meanings depending on what it confronts, so Mr. Lichtenstein's Benday dots and flat primary colors read like a running commentary, pointing out the proper objects for parody at each moment and suggesting that at some point virtually everything is fair game.

us,THE WILD WILD EAST,"AS HE DROVE ACROSS THE LONGVIEW BRIDGE over the Black River one day in the winter of 1985, David W. Stahle, a researcher at the University of Arkansas, gave a long, low whistle. He had come to the Cape Fear region of North Carolina in search of old trees that he could core for his ongoing climatic research, hoping for specimens as old as the 600- and 700-year-old stands he already knew about on other lonely rivers. What he found along the Black, though, defied every stereotype of the East Coast -- an untouched stretch of river bordered by bald cypresses that dated back at least 1,700 years. ""Since one of the characteristics of these old trees is hollowness in the cores, there's no question in my mind that many of those trees are 2,000 years old,"" Stahle says. And little question that they are the oldest living things in eastern North America, the most venerable organisms this side of the bristlecone pines of eastern California. This place exists as much in time as in place; it was protected by the Washington-based Nature Conservancy in the wake of Stahle's discovery and is now a living museum of natural history -- a kind of Pleistocene park. ""These trees -- these very trees -- had Carolina parakeets and ivory-billed woodpeckers in them,"" said J. Merrill Lynch, a protection specialist at the North Carolina chapter of the conservancy, as we paddled the sleepy river in the spring of 1993. ""Now those species are both extinct.

""All this is told with a mixture of humor and compassion,"" Robert Coles said here earlier this year. THE CERTIFICATE By Isaac Bashevis Singer. Translated by Leonard Wolf. Plume, $10. The hero of this novel is David Bendiger, a young Polish Jew in 1922 who is consumed by conflicts: he doesn't really identify with Zionism, Communism or his humble provincial roots, and yet women who seem to represent each of these influences are eager to tie their fortunes to his. The reason? David possesses an emigration certificate to Palestine. Last year our reviewer, Lore Dickstein, said, ""Singer is the most magical of writers, transforming reality into art with seemingly effortless sleight of hand."" Questions of Jewish identity are also at the heart of A PERFECT PEACE, by Amos Oz, translated by Hillel Halkin (Helen and Kurt Wolff/Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11.95).

But at the dawn of a new epoch, many Israelis seem unable to shed the memories of church-induced pain. A1 The Vatican still seeks to defend its position in the Arab world. A8 In the U.S., praise from Catholic officials and Jewish groups. A8 SETBACKS RATTLE BOSNIAN CROATS The killings of two Catholic priests have deepened doubts among Bosnia's Croats that the Muslim-led Government is committed to an ethnically mixed country. A1 A U.N. commander wants more peacekeepers, not resolutions. A3 CAUTIOUS FAITH IN MIDEAST TALKS Palestinian and Egyptian officials said they expected Israeli-P.L.O. talks to resume soon. A10 FIRE RUINS SYNAGOGUE IN MOSCOW A synagogue in Moscow was destroyed by fire, fanning fears among some Jews of a new wave of anti-Semitic vandalism. A8 NORTH KOREA PLEDGES ACCESS North Korea has told the United States that international monitors can visit its seven disclosed nuclear sites, Clinton Administration officials said. But it has not proposed procedures for inspections. A1 I.R.A.

A4 GERMANY INDICTS 4 IN FIREBOMBING Prosecutors indicted four men in connection with a firebombing that killed five Turks in May. A6 The Honduran Army pledged to open files on political killings. A7 In Cairo, private burial is a luxury only the rich can afford. A10 National A12-20 A CRISIS ON DEATH ROW In Texas, the number of inmates on death row continues to rise, but the number of lawyers willing to represent them is shrinking, creating what their legal advocates are calling a crisis. A1 DISPUTE OVER HOWARD STERN The F.C.C. has delayed Infinity Broadcasting's purchase of three radio stations for $170 million while it considers complaints about Howard Stern, the radio personality whose scatological humor has already generated $1.2 million in fines. A1 SURGEON GENERAL'S SPOTLIGHT Dr. Joycelyn Elders, the bluntspoken Surgeon General, has only been in office four months, and she has already attracted more attention without even trying than many other Administration officials. A1 FLORIDA PREPARES TO FILE SUIT The governor of Florida has ordered his state to sue the Federal Government in an effort to recoup the hundreds of millions of dollars the state spends on social services for illegal aliens. A12 TOUGH-TALK BARBIE, SWEET G.I. JOE A group of Manhattan performance artists have swapped the voice boxes of Talking Dukes and ""Teen Talk"" Barbies. The result? Barbies who roar, ""Eat lead, Cobra!"" G.I. Joe's who twitter, ""Will we ever have enough clothes?"" A12 BATTLE OVER BABY CONTINUES In Chicago, a woman gave birth to a baby who, while still a fetus, was the center of an intense legal battle that reached the Supreme Court when doctors said the child would die or be retarded if carried to term. A12 STRATEGY SHIFT ON DEMJANJUK The Justice Department no longer contends that John Demjanjuk was one of the most barbaric Nazi figures of the Holocaust. But it still accuses him of being a lesser war criminal. A13 RADIATION INVESTIGATION WIDENS The Clinton Administration has expanded an inquiry into the propriety and safety of human radiation experimentation conducted by the Government in the decades after World War II.
