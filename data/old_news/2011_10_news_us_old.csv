us,Canada: Court Saves Drug Injection Center from Shutdown," An effort by the Conservative government to close the only center in North America where addicts may legally inject drugs was thwarted by the countrys Supreme Court in a unanimous decision released Friday. In 2008, the government said it would not extend the centers exemption from federal narcotics laws, a position endorsed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Insite center in Vancouver, British Columbia, does not supply drugs, but allows addicts to inject them without fear of arrest under medical supervision on the condition that they undergo treatment. The court ruled that denying that permit and closing the clinic violated its users constitutional rights by threatening their health and indeed their lives. The justices also said that during its eight years of operation, Insite has been proven to save lives with no discernible negative impact on the public safety and health objectives of Canada.

There is even an on-site seamstress, to whip up, say, a set of napkins in Unikko, the signature poppy print, or a pillow cover in the artist Astrid Sylwans brush strokey Vattenblnk.

There were a whole lot of black-and-white New Directions paperbacks, mostly poetry by people like H.D. or Denise Levertov. There were the Colette novels she read on the sly. There was the first edition of Couples, belonging to her mother, which Madeleine had surreptitiously dipped into back in sixth grade and which she was using now to provide textual support in her English honors thesis on the marriage plot.

What came next, of course, is well known  a vote in the General Assembly on Nov. 29, 1947, in favor of partition, and the war that immediately followed. The decision is viewed in the Arab world as the great crime, and Palestinian leaders, including the current president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, regard it as the original sin that led to the catastrophe, the nakba, that befell their nation  a disaster they now want the General Assembly to remedy. What is not widely known is how a possibly pro-Arab committee, or at least one that was supposed to be neutral, came to issue a report that led directly to the establishment of the state of Israel.

Matchups: Another Turning Point,"Packers (4-0) at Falcons (2-2)Sunday, 8:20 p.m.Line: Packers by 6.Tramon Williamss end-of-half interception return for the Packers against the Falcons in last years playoffs may be remembered as a turning point in N.F.L. history. The Falcons were the better team entering the game, and while the Packers held a 21-14 lead before the play, the Falcons were driving and appeared likely to score. Williamss interception turned the game into a rout, and the Packers have been unbeatable ever since, while the Falcons have replaced them as the team with a young quarterback and lots of talent that cannot quite get its act together.Of course, for some that turning point arrived a little late. Im really surprised that it kind of took him so long, Brett Favre said of the three interminable years it took Aaron Rodgers to lead the Packers to the Super Bowl. Who knew that through all of those quasi-retirements, through his stints with the Jets and the Vikings, Favre was just impatiently waiting for Rodgers to close the deal? Favre did not sound as if he was trying to insult Rodgers  he has simply lost the ability to compliment people who are not him  but teammates and analysts have rushed to Rodgerss defense, which he does not really need.It had been peaceful months since the last self-serving Favre rant.

Over the past three decades, the massacre has been explored in numerous books and even several television documentaries. Yet the story does bear retelling, not least for those too young to recall the shock that swept the world at the time, but also because Scheeres adds insights harvested from some 50,000 pages of letters, journals and other documents found in Jonestown and recently released by the F.B.I.

Her book thus alternates between the nitty-gritty of particle physics and meditations of a more rarefied sort. Stitching the whole thing together are passages recounting the authors globe-trotting adventures: accepting the key to the city from the mayor of Padua, chatting up a scientifically curious actor on a flight to Los Angeles, attending the Barcelona premiere of an opera about physics for which she had written the libretto.

Doesnt that sound terrible, like a kind of spiritual deformity  hating John Lennon?

The same thing happened again three years later, and the smell was finally identified: fenugreek, carried on breezes from a New Jersey flavor and fragrance factory. The incident reminded me of a passage in Andr Acimans fine 1995 memoir, Out of Egypt, in which he writes about the fragrance of hilba, fenugreek. Arab Egyptians drank it for its curative powers, and reeked afterward, but for many Alexandrian Jews who aspired to being European, nothing could be more dclass than the smell of hilba. Acimans father called it une odeur darabe, an Arab smell, and hated any trace of it in the house or on his clothes. But, Aciman points out, all homes bear ethnic odors, and from the various smells of foods and perfumes the stories of communities and persons emerge. The opening chapter of Alibis, Acimans beautiful new book of essays, is an extended aria on the sense of smell.",2011-10-07T16:43:41+0000

us,Erin Morgensterns Magician Death Match,"Let me say at the outset that glamour and charm are notoriously difficult qualities to render on the page, and all those words like mercury and lightning and ineffability certainly apply, ditto catching, capturing and chasing. It may well be the case that we still hold The Great Gatsby in such high esteem because of those amazing parties to which none of us will ever be invited, and wouldnt have been in the 1920s, either. If glamour were easy, the entire fashion industry could do its thing on Sunday afternoons with a spool of thread and a few yards of gauze. Moreover, for the true geniuses of glamour, a spool of thread and a few yards of gauze are all it takes to make one feel that one is Marie Antoinette spinning around Versailles. For the rest of us, glamour is a sweaty struggle, rife with pricked thumbs, bulges and gaffes. This is why it is a risky business indeed to devote nearly 400 pages to a confection called le Cirque des Rves, a circus that occurs at night (as opposed to what other sort of circus, by the way?) and is famous, apparently, for doing wild, magical, life-changing, impossible things. Like a magician, the writer must pull the rabbit from the hat, cut the lady in half, make the elephant disappear and so on. We long to be fooled. In The Night Circus, her debut novel, Erin Morgenstern works hard to create just such a sense of magic, but there finally seems to be something too sensible about her sensibility to pull off the trick. The novel is  and its an odd thing to say about a work of fiction  just too real to be believed. True magic is dangerous, and there is little of that sort of propulsive danger in these pages; where it does occur is surprising, and oddly marginalized.",2011-10-07T16:46:50+0000

Shes a perfect client, he thinks. Surprisingly smart and self-aware and honestly self-critical. Michael could easily be describing any of the characters who populate Butlers vast and diverse body of fiction  a dozen novels and some half-dozen story collections, some more successful than others  from the Vietnamese immigrants in A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain, which won the Pulitzer in 1993, to the panoply of the famous damned in his 2009 novel Hell.

First, he gets slapped around in Paula McLains best-selling revenge novel The Paris Wife, which retells the story of his years in France from the point of view of his jilted first wife, Hadley Richardson. Then hes mocked in Woody Allens Midnight in Paris as a self-serious blowhard. But a little bit of rehabilitation is on the way, thanks to Hemingways Boat, Paul Hendricksons sympathetic biography (new at No. 14 on the hardcover nonfiction list), not to mention the first installment of Hemingways complete letters, just out from Cambridge University Press. That project, which includes previously unseen materials from the Finca Viga, Hemingways estate outside Havana, reminds us why we fell in love with the guy to begin with  or at least why Hadley did, even if his spelling and grammar werent always so hot. The book  the first of a projected 16 volumes  includes his earliest recorded love letter to Hash, written a few days before Christmas 1920.

At the same time, the orchestra has 16 openings. Members of the orchestras negotiating committee declined to comment. In a statement the orchestras management said the strike authorization vote, held last week, was standard procedure and had no effect on its desire to reach an agreement.

It will be run by Hazelden, the Minnesota-based operator of a network of rehab centers, and be housed in a planned luxury condo development on West Broadway that Hazelden bought after the development went belly up. The Columbia University psychiatry department is a partner in the effort. Although the popular image of live-in centers for people recovering from substance abuse runs more toward campus-like complexes in bucolic settings, where fresh air and natural beauty replace the lures of drugs and alcohol, this one  intended to serve as a transition from rehab to real life  is in the midst of a heavily traveled night life zone, near bars, clubs and restaurants that would seem to pose threats to a residents hard-won sobriety. Have you or has someone you know been in rehab or a similar situation and found the temptations of city life hard to resist? Or do you think that treatment centers need not be remote to be effective?

He had his models paint their faces in the bohemian-urchin style of Paris in the 20s, with darkened eyes and red lips, finished off with shingle haircuts. Then he put the girls in pants. Technically these were split skirts, but who cares? The effect was the same. Long before Yves Saint Laurent issued le smoking, square Norman was there. They may seem a little avant-garde at first, he told The Times after his 1960 show, for which he received a standing ovation, but I really do believe in the look. He had uncanny instincts for anticipating change: the elongated sweater look, the return of waistlines in the mid-60s, the dolman-sleeve rage of the early 70s. He showed leopard patterns in the 40s. The flapper makeup told a lot about Norell as well: stage-struck at an early age, he designed costumes in the 20s at the Astoria studio of Paramount Pictures, dressing Gloria Swanson in Zaza, and later worked on Broadway musicals and burlesque shows before moving to ladies fashion.",2011-10-10T21:00:20+0000

Spanish Elegy, the painting at the center of the dispute, was sold to a European gallery, Killala Fine Art, for $650,000 in 2007 by Julian Weissman, who had previously worked as a salesman at Knoedler & Company in Manhattan. Before the sale Dedalus initially concluded that Spanish Elegy was authentic, but later backtracked and declared the work, supposedly painted by Motherwell in 1953, to be a fake. The Killala gallery said in its lawsuit that it had relied on the foundations assurance in making the purchase. Mr. Weissman was accused of acquiring the painting from Glafira Rosales, a dealer on Long Island, and of hiding its provenance, according to court papers. As part of the settlement, Ms. Rosales and her gallery will pick up most of the cost of reimbursing Killala for the price of the painting and Dedalus for its expenses. Mr. Weissman will pay the remaining portion. The foundation marked the back of Spanish Elegy (above) with a stamp in capital letters and indelible ink that says Dedalus has determined that this painting is not an authentic work by Robert Motherwell but a forgery.",2011-10-11T21:31:13+0000

Many of the documents have unique historical importance, like the 1493 papal bull granting to Spain lands recently discovered by Christopher Columbus. The document, known as the Inter Caetera bull, is well known to scholars but perhaps less so to the general public, which will be able to peruse a fragment online at luxinarcana.org on Wednesday, the day denoting Columbuss arrival in the Americas in 1492. It is one of 100 documents that will go on a rare public viewing at the Capitoline Museum in Rome in February as part of an exhibition celebrating the 400th anniversary of the foundation of the archives. Drafted by Pope Alexander VI, the papal bull not only granted Spain certain rights in the newly discovered lands but also called for the evangelization of the indigenous people there. It is part of the history of the colonization of the Americas that gave rise to a series of problems whose consequences would be felt over time, said Luca Carboni, secretary general of the archives.",2011-10-12T04:02:39+0000

Holder Jr. for Justice Department documents related to the program, called Fast and Furious. Mr. Issa has said that Mr. Holder provided misleading testimony to Congress on May 3 about when he first learned of Fast and Furious, which was overseen by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A Justice Department spokeswoman, Tracy Schmaler, said that the department had already provided thousands of documents and made many officials available for interviews and testimony.

But the decision to appoint a prominent British human rights lawyer to prepare a report on the extent of police and army collusion in the 1989 killing of Patrick Finucane, a lawyer who had represented Irish Republic Army activists, angered his family. They had demanded a full judicial inquiry similar to the one that was completed last year into the Bloody Sunday killings of 1972, when British troops shot and killed 13 unarmed Catholic protesters, with another protester dying later of his wounds. The $300 million cost of that inquiry, and the 12 years it took to complete, were cited by the government as reasons for not appointing a similar inquiry in the Finucane case. A previous inquiry had shown that Mr. Finucane was shot 14 times by Protestant gunmen as he ate a meal at his home with his wife and children. ",2011-10-13T04:15:19+0000

Mr. Cameron told the House of Commons on Wednesday that he had written to the governments of 15 other Commonwealth nations that recognize Queen Elizabeth as head of state urging their acceptance of a change in the succession rules set by the Act of Settlement, adopted in 1701, which stipulates that male children have precedence over their older sisters in succession to the throne. Mr. Cameron also urged that the law be changed to eliminate a prohibition on the accession of any monarch who is married to a Roman Catholic, calling the ban an historical anomaly. The changes are said to have broad support in the other Commonwealth nations, though some are said to have reservations about opening a discussion out of concern that it might reopen potentially acrimonious debate on whether the monarchy should be abolished.

I started at the beginning, the bottom floor, where walls of cashmere V-neck sweaters bragged grand-opening price tags ($89.90 marked down to $49.90). So as not to throw the entirety of my allowance at four candy-colored sweaters, I jumped on the theme-park-style escalators and went straight up to the third floor. It was there that I did a double take: Japanese engineered denim for $9.90! With $190 left, I grabbed a mens flannel shirt ($29.90), a fluffy down vest ($49.90), a two-for-one Breton-striped lounge set ($24.90) and a pair of very holiday slippers ($12.90; if I dont wear them, someone in my family will come Christmastime); $72.50 to go and my winter shopping was almost done. Then I turned a corner and found myself staring into an aquarium-like tube filled with the companys famous (and effective!) Heattech pieces. I chose a knit cap ($12.90) and matching gloves ($12.90), a pack of socks ($9.90) and a camisole ($12.90). I had $23.90 left, enough for a pink umbrella ($12.90). Who knew Uniqlo sold umbrellas? Chic ones! Had I just $2 more  $11 was all that was left  Id have bought two.",2011-10-14T16:23:44+0000

To its detractors, the brain is a kludge, a hacked-up device beset with bugs, biases and self-deceptions that undermine our decision making and well-being at every turn. To its admirers, it contains vast potential we can all unlock to improve our lives, thanks to neural plasticity that enables the adult nervous system to change in more dramatic ways than previously thought.

Faced with such narrative restrictions, you might be tempted to invent a brother who was everything that Keats was not: practical, rich, footloose, married with a child, healthy enough to reach middle age. Why not send this imaginary brother across the Atlantic to the rank-grown forests (as Keats wrote in a later poem) of America, Kentucky, say, and invent encounters with luminous figures like John James Audubon and giant catfish and backwoods swindlers living on bear sandwiches greased with bear fat? A lively correspondence between the two brothers, spiced with verses, might serve to delineate the striking differences in their situations, and cast a reciprocal light on the poetry and the prairies.",2011-10-14T17:41:18+0000

Thompsons work is much prettier than anything drawn by Crumb, but the anxieties are similar. If Habibi had been content to mine this narrow but rich vein of adolescent angst it might have been a comics comic, or at least an instructive book for young adults.

A copy has simply lived more: it contains within it not just the image or idea at hand, but also the imprint of time, place or identity linked with that moment as well as the motive of duplication. Versions, Larics video treatise on this subject, features an animated slide show of contemporary copies (the infamously Photoshopped 2008 image of missile tests in Iran, in which the missiles were cloned for heightened visual impact; Internet memes like the Zidane head butt, remixed and disseminated by users around the world); and historical antecedents (recycled character animations from early Disney movies; figurative archetypes taken from classical sculpture) that trace its relevance back to far before copy and paste was a way of life. Laric updates the piece regularly, and now a handful of versions of Versions are circulating online with many of his other works, causing discrepancies and redundancies that surface as a digitally savvy form of authenticity.",2011-10-17T18:00:49+0000

I felt like your choices in Oregon were a hippie hot springs experience or really spendy, overly attentive spa experiences, neither of which had ever appealed to me, she says. The Lyly vibe is one of communal shvitzing rather than solitary pampering. A $15 fee gets you access to an elegantly designed cedar sauna, wet steam room and lounge; though massages and facials are available by appointment, scrubs, salts, masks and foot soaks are do-it-yourself.

He was given some of the items, in smaller portions, but ate nothing. After the states decision, Brian D.

us,Frieze Frame | Ken Okiishis Manhattan Transfer,"The Frame section of the Frieze Art Fair, curated by Cecilia Alemani and Rodrigo Moura, made space for experimentation on the fairs fringes in the form of 25 solo artist presentations presented by a younger batch of international galleries. Among them was Alex Zachary, one of New Yorks most idiosyncratic galleries both in terms of space and location. (It has been operating out of a multilevel, formerly residential condominium a couple of blocks from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.) Fittingly, the artist Ken Okiishis project at Zacharys Frame booth was a curious meditation on the psychogeography of Manhattan real estate and mythologies of uptown bohemia. Eulogizing the recently shuttered Lexington Avenue establishment Gino as a point of departure (which over time has hosted luminaries as diverse as Sophia Loren, I. M. Pei and Robin Byrd), Okiishi began by outfitting the booth in the iconic Scalamandr-designed zebra wallpaper that made its debut in the restaurants dining room circa 1930. He applied the same print to parasols bolted to the walls, whose slow and steady motorized twirling evoked bygone pageantry and ritziness. Faux-antique photographs of an early-20th-century apartment were hung beside the umbrellas; in actuality these were digital images lifted from the present-day Streeteasy.com listing for a unit on West 67th Street that was once home to Marcel Duchamp, from 1916 to 1918. East Side, West Side, Depression era, recession era: Okiishis project drew foggy connections between places and times that are factually disparate but psychically proximate.

Her slightly grumpy apprehension derived from the fact that Hand and Flowers had just received two Michelin stars, a first for any British pub. I do loathe the term gastropub, she added.

us,The Herms Time Machine,"The quest to counter the relentless march of time has been pursued by dreamers and puzzled over by scientists since, well, the beginning of time. Now, the French luxury giant Herms has cleverly succeeded in achieving the very appearance of slowing time with its new watch the Cape Cod Grands Heures, first introduced at Baselworld 2011, and available in stores in time for the holidays. The face of the new watch, which has three choices of distinct dials, shows numeric hour indicators that are clustered together, spread far apart, standing solo and intermittently spaced  all allowing for a variable speed that gives the illusion that time is moving more slowly, or more quickly. Want your afternoons to seemingly pass at a more leisurely pace? Choose a dial with wide open spaces between 2 and 4. Prefer a purportedly longer happy hour? Try the version with larger gaps between 5 and 7. This ingenious trick of time is managed by an oval wheel system that allows for the speeding and slowing of its motion, while the minutes and seconds march steadily, and constantly, on. The clever dial design encourages the romantic notion that time can actually take its time, but the hours, alas, remain the same. Always the hours.",2011-10-19T17:30:46+0000

us,"Afghan Gun Locker: Battlefield Ingenuity, and a Weapons Longevity","This year, after Western journalists poured into Libya as the civilian population took up arms and lunged into war, a line of coverage on makeshift arms production and distribution found its way into many newspapers, magazines and Web sites. The New York Times was part of this, with coverage on the anti-Qaddafi forces hasty acquisition, production and fielding of all manner of repurposed arms and the vehicles to carry them. Often these weapons were poorly used. Sometimes they were fired just as indiscriminately as the weapons fired by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafis troops that NATO, in its United Nations-approved bid to protect civilians, claimed to marshal international will to stop. Some of these weapons were also instrumental in the anti-Qaddafi militias eventual success, as was visible in Misurata. (For a fuller view of many of these themes, read this report on the hidden plant in Misurata, or these explainers on the dangerous repurposing of 57-mm air-to-ground rockets or 122-millimeter Grad rockets or, in this case, the knuckleheaded firing of plainly labeled inert rockets toward Qaddafi forces in Libyas mountainous west.)",2011-10-20T19:50:17+0000

us,Support for Move to Broaden Definition of Rape," Police officials and womens groups on Thursday applauded a recommendation by a Federal Bureau of Investigation subcommittee that the definition of rape used by the agency be revised. The definition, written more than 80 years ago, has been criticized as too narrow, resulting in thousands of rapes being excluded from the F.B.I.s annual Uniform Crime Report. The subcommittee recommends a broader definition, to include anal and oral rape, as well as rapes involving male victims. Currently, only sexual assaults that involved force and vaginal penetration are included. The proposal is subject to approval of a full advisory board, which meets in December. Womens groups have been trying for years to get the definition changed. What Im happiest about is that such a clear consensus is emerging from law enforcement officials all over the country that this has to happen, said Carol Tracy, executive director of the Womens Law Project in Philadelphia.

The leagues carefully maintained competitive balance almost guarantees that every week will feature several compelling games between high-quality, evenly matched opponents. Almost.Bell would never imagine a week like this, in which the best (the Patriots) and most fascinating (the Eagles, the 49ers) teams have byes, while the top contenders face pushovers and the mediocre slug it out with the middling. Matchups that looked good when the schedule was announced now merit double-digit point spreads. Case in point: the Colts vs. the Saints, a rematch of Super Bowl XLIV that promised to be a seesaw offensive battle, is now little more than a three-hour wake for Indianapolis and a chance to watch Sean Payton coach New Orleans from the booth instead of the sideline.Granted, Curtis Painter, like a frozen burrito under a filling station heat lamp, is slowly warming to the Colts starting quarterback job. His completion percentage has gone up every week, and the Colts offense no longer looks like an intramural team playing in a downpour. Also, Drew Brees offered hope that Payton might find a way to stand on, or slightly above, the field on the surgically repaired leg he broke in last weeks game.

The limited damage led the plants operator, Dominion, and the commission to debate whether their standard for measuring a quakes strength  based simply on ground motion  was the best one. That measure indicated that the ground motion on Aug. 23 exceeded what the reactors were designed for. But when engineers measured the quake by the total amount of energy it delivered, the quake was far too weak to produce significant damage. (The energy measure is based on both the shaking and its duration.) Most of the cosmetic damage found at the plant was limited to concrete, Dominion said. ",2011-10-22T02:55:08+0000

Instead of the original stars from the film, a different group of actors joined for the occasion. Jennifer Garner played the popular Claire (Molly Ringwalds part in the movie), James Van Der Beek was Andy the jock (Emilio Estevez), Patton Oswalt was the nerdy Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), Mindy Kaling was the misunderstood Allison (Ally Sheedy), and Aaron Paul was the school-detention lifer Bender (Judd Nelson).  J. K. Simmons and Michael Chiklis were the only two (fictional) adults in the room, portraying Carl the janitor and the hard-line teacher Mr. Vernon. The event was the brainchild of the director Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air). I needed a film that was in a contained location with not too many characters, that was funny, that was populous, that had a great script that the audience would have a relationship with, Mr. Reitman told Entertainment Weekly.

When tested in 6,000 infants ages 5 to 17 months in seven sub-Saharan nations, it reduced the risk of infection with severe malaria by 47 percent during the year after the shots, far less than the 90 percent efficacy rate typically sought for other vaccines. And there are other big hurdles still to surmount. There are hints that the protection may wane over time and results from administering a booster shot wont be known until 2014. Side effects could pose a problem; seizures and fevers were higher among children given the vaccine. ",2011-10-24T01:18:22+0000

For the Performa 11 biennial (11.performa-arts.org), the Los Angeles artist Liz Glynn will retrace Fullers steps, pratfalls and all. Part 1 of her performance  a loosely choreographed re-enactment of Fullers failed attempt  takes place on the first Sunday of the biennial in locations throughout New York City, including Times Square; for Part 2, 25 volunteers will assist in building a dome. Whether it will stand remains to be seen.

us,Hidden Gem,"Ten years is the length of an average commercial lease, but its also, as the designer Ted Muehling has discovered, the approximate life span of a neighborhood. Back in 2001, Muehling moved his storefront workshop from a formerly desolate block on Greene Street to Howard Street  at the time SoHos final frontier. But when a Mondrian hotel went up nearby, so did Muehlings rent, and the designer moved on once again. His new store, on White Street in TriBeCa, is grander in proportion and there is more selling space, but also more space for Muehling to display the many things he collects and that inspire him, from natural wonders like seashells or insects to the work of his partner, the artist Mats Gustafson, or that of his friend Jan Baracz, who carves bellybuttons into large stones. And while his workrooms are smaller, for the first time Muehling has a little studio all his own  an attic tucked into a mezzanine under a skylight in the back. The timing could not have been better. With his product collaborations with Nymphenburg and Steuben winding down, Muehling is eager to get back to making jewelry. On a recent morning, a pair of canaries twittered joyfully, and an installation of monarch butterflies on a dried mullein stem was magically animated by a breeze from the air-conditioner. As with his previous store, this one is livened by sounds from behind the scenes  the bang of metal on metal, the murmur of NPR  evidence that this is a place where things are made and not just sold. Its the kind of neighborhood place, Muehling points out, where you can walk in and theyll make a new wire for your earring if you dont mind waiting 20 minutes. ",2011-10-24T15:00:31+0000

The law, which took effect in July, is the only one in the country that requires people receiving cash assistance through welfare to pass a drug test. The applicants must pay for the test themselves but are reimbursed if they test negative. A similar law in Michigan was struck down as unconstitutional a decade ago. In her ruling, Judge Mary S. Scriven of Federal District Court in Orlando said that there was no special need for the state to require drug tests and that it should stop, at least until the court made a final determination in the case. The court concludes that preliminarily enjoining what appears likely to be deemed an unconstitutional intrusion on the Fourth Amendment rights of applicants serves the public interest, Judge Scriven said. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by Luis Lebron, a Navy veteran, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. ",2011-10-24T23:43:57+0000

Their arguments had lost none of their sting over the years; as always, Pauline seemed to enjoy pushing Shawn to the limits, trying to find a crack in his gentlemanly decorum. I can remember a couple of times, at least, seeing him turn so red when they would start arguing, remembered William Whitworth, who served as Paulines immediate editor for a time in the 1970s. She would never let it go. Shawn had had a heart attack, and I thought a couple of times that he might fall over on the floor right there in the office.

Its cultivated side, the bright lights and big buildings of the city center, collides with its geography  the dazzle and danger of the wind-whipped mountains and the two oceans that embrace it. The 2010 World Cup soccer tournament transformed parts of its infrastructure. A 55,000-seat stadium was built. High-end hotels, boutiques, restaurants, art galleries and B&Bs opened.

Such was the power of Kaels voluminous writing about movies that she transformed the sensibility and standards of mainstream pop culture criticism in America  mostly for the better, despite her bullying personality (in print and in life), her sloppy professional ethics and her at times careerist escapades in self-dramatizing contrarianism. She had a lot to write about. Her prime years as a critic happily coincided with sequential renaissances in foreign cinema (the 1960s) and American movies (the 1970s). Week after week, she whipped up torrents of copy that could make causes clbres out of even the most ephemeral Hollywood fluff. She upended journalistic criticism the way contemporaneous New Journalists like Tom Wolfe and Hunter Thompson revolutionized reportage. Her essays, fiercely present in the moment and epic in length, buttonholed readers so theyd feel as if they were sitting next to her in the dark, seeing everything she saw.

Forty-nine animals were hunted down and killed by law enforcement officers who said they feared the animals, which included lions and tigers, might attack people. A snow monkey was never found, and is believed to have been eaten by one of the big cats. State officials said the quarantine was ordered because the animals might be infected with a dangerous, contagious disease related to the squalid conditions under which they were kept at the Zanesville, Ohio, preserve.

In fact, one of the easiest arguments to win in the Middle East might be that Tel Avivs urban core has not sprouted a truly remarkable structure in the more than half a century since the Bauhaus inkwell  which left its curvilinear imprint on hundreds of buildings in The White City  began to dry up. But with the completion of the Herta and Paul Amir Building at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, opening on Wednesday, things are set to get noticeably whiter and brighter. The new wing, designed by the Cambridge, Mass.-based architect Preston Scott Cohen (who is also chairman of the architecture department at Harvard University), looks a bit like an elongated Rubiks Cube doused with bleach. The gleaming white parabolas of the facade are composed of 465 flat, interlocking, precast concrete panels of different shapes and sizes. The buildings three floors are linked to two more below grade by an 87-foot-high, top-lit atrium, a lightfall that will shine on the worlds largest collection of Israeli art. The buildings confident yet supple geometries provide a nifty counterpoint to the museums main building, a 1971 Brutalist number by the Israeli architect Dan Eytan (who also designed Israels decidedly unfussy Dimona nuclear reactor). Next to that chunky monkey, Cohens creation is pure pizazz. Fittingly, in honor of the buildings inauguration later this month, the city of Tel Aviv has declared 2012 to be Art Year, culminating in a four-day blowout Art Weekend March 21-24.",2011-10-28T15:15:47+0000

You can never, so runs the elegiac argument, precisely reproduce a line of poetry in another language. Poetry! You can hardly even translate maman. . . .

And he was at least arguably the most powerful American writer of horror fiction between Poe and Lovecraft. (Henry Jamess supernatural tales are in a class by themselves.) In his career Bierce wrote more than 40 spooky stories, most of them about ghosts, along with a fair number of short narratives  some true, some fanciful  about the horrors of war. All his tales, both the ones about soldiers and the ones about the haunted and the haunting, are steeped in loneliness and dread, which he evokes with the precision of someone familiar with their every nuance.

De Beers practice first took root through domestically appointed video installations that channeled deep, dark, suburban, subcultural angst. She has steadily drifted toward explorations of the paranormal, conjuring Puritan New England for her 2007 horror film, The Quickening, and more recently  and more minimally  evoking the inherent eeriness of spaces through structures inspired by Brion Gysins Dream Machine or corporate entities like the Seagram Building. Haunt Room, which opened over the weekend on the 14th Street passageway of the High Line, is a 15-foot-wide frosted plexiglass tetradecagon outfitted with powerful infrasound speakers that pump low-frequency tones outside the range of human hearing. According to experiments conducted by Goldsmiths College, these vibrations are capable, in theory, of producing a haunted feeling  or at the very least the perception of strange smells and physiological hallucinations like dizziness. Visitors may enter and judge for themselves how easily their sensory perceptions are smeared. This is a New York haunted house' de Beer says.

But a Rangers victory over the Saint Louis Cardinals, he suggested, might change all that: If these Rangers find a way to win just one more time, life in Texas may never be the same all-Cowboys-all-the-time universe again.",2011-10-31T21:04:18+0000
