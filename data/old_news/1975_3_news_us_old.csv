The 40milelong county between Philadelphia and Bethlehem may have more of the fine old stone houses and barns of Colonial days than any other area of the country; 13 covered bridges still stand, one dating to 1832.

New Hope has been an artists' colony for half a century and draws tourists by the thousands on weekends.

us,Film: 'Coup Pour Coup':A Realistic Appeal for Rights of Labor,"Women's liberation, or better still, universal liberation from industrial injustice, is emphatically served in ""Coup Pour Coup,"" which had its premiere yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room. The French feature made in and around Rouen in 1971 and dealing with a garment-factory strike is labeled ""a fiction film."" It is as realistic as a forceful documentary. And if ""Coup Pour Coup"" is pro-labor and shouts its pleas for justice with the fervor of Soviet agitprop films of the past, it nevertheless presents a strong case, even if passionately slanted.Despite subtitles, ""Coup Pour Coup"" calls for further explanation. According to program notes, it is a collective effort involving about 100 people, including some ""60 unemployed working women, film makers and actors and actresses,"" who were paid the same $300 a month fee and who collaborated on the filming and dialogue.In shooting the film in a manner that was ""a metaphor for the story of the film,"" the producers have achieved striking naturalism both in their, simple story line and from their unprofessional cast. Essentially, ""Coup Pour Coup"" traces the stultifying effects of the assembly line on these women, some of whom do double duty as mothers after work. Inadequate pay, a hard-driving management, lip-serving union officials and the dismissals of two workers finally serve to provoke a strike and a sit-in take-over of the plant, a revolt that leads to ultimate victory and the meeting of their demands.Although it is impossible to differentiate actor from authentic worker, the ""performances"" are, by and large, properly rough-hewn and seemingly ad lib. The old woman who reminisces about her strike experience in 1936 seems to be as real as the young, harried sit-in mother who rails at her husband's inability to handle their youngsters.Perhaps the seizing of the plant owner, whom the workers plague ""blow for blow"" with the indignities they have had to endure, is a bit melodramatic. But the cast appears to project truth as well as passion and understanding of their newly found camaraderie in their resistance to hired thugs and the police, their cynical put-downs of union leaders and in the help from friends, farmers and other workers who have joined them in sympathy strikes.""Coup Pour Coup"" does not list credits for either a writer or a director, but if the collaborators here have fashioned a tract, they have also invested it with a good deal of human drama.",1975-03-03T05:00:00+0000

us,At Long Last Love' Evokes Past Films,"""At Long Last Love,"" which opened yesterday at Radio City Music Hall, is Peter Bogdanovich's audacious attempt to make a stylish, nineteen-thirties Hollywood musical comedy with a superb score by Cole Porter but with performers who don't dance much and whose singing abilities might be best hidden in a very large choir.It's a movie compounded of nerve and a lot of cinematic intelligence, which is no substitute for fun. ""At Long Last Love"" is almost entirely devoid of the kind of wit, vigor and staggering self-assurance with which real musical comedy performers  people like Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Ethel Merman, Clifton Webb, Nanette Fabray, Charlotte Greenwood, Jack Buchanancould turn a leaky rowboat of a show into the Ile de France.""At Long Last Love"" never quite sinks, but then it never leaves the pier. It may be some measure of my own feelings toward it that, at the end, I was exhausted. I'd been wanting it to work and had been straining to enjoy the good things that came along.In the forefront of the good things are the Cole Porter songs, more than a dozen (most of them complete with their verses), some so beautifully integrated into the story that no seams show. I also liked the intentional vacuousness of Mr. Bogdanovich's screenplay, which is about what used to be called a madcap heiress who loves a playboy millionaire, who loves a wisecracking Broadway star who, in turn, loves a charming Italian rou. There's also a comic valet and a no-nonsense ladies maid.Then, too, there are some great art deco sets representing posh New York hotel suites, an elegant country club and a Long Island mansion with a foyer bigger than the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. They are the frankly fake artifacts out of our Great Depression movies, settings made for Fred and Ginger and Eric Blore.But there are no Fred and Ginger to inhabit them. Instead there is, most prominently, Cybill Shepherd as the madcap heiress, and casting Cybil Shepherd in a musical comedy is like entering a horse in a cat show. She's beautiful and lithe and has great lines but she's the wrong species. She's too big. She'd look terrific on a tennis court or playing golf but she's too literal to seem anything except gross in these fairy-tale surroundings.When she attempts to sing, she also attempts to ""act"" the lyrics, and there is no sense of fantasy. The bluntness and naivet that made her so appealing and so right in ""Daisy Miller"" are simply abrasive here.The other performers have an easier time, especially the indestructibly funny Madeline Kahn, who plays the Broadway star, and Eileen Brennan, who plays the ladies maid, a role that manages to evoke performances by both Patsy Kelly and Helen Broderick. Duilio Del Prete, as the Italian rou, is a macho Erik Rhodes who signs passably, and John Hillerman is nicely stuffy as the valet who puts great store on social form.The problem that Mr. Bogdanovich set himself in ""At Long Last Love""and which he never solvesis how to top these evocations of the past for our current pleasure. Because the past is always right, it may be that ""At Long Last Love"" would have seemed as vapid as it does even if it were an immensely clever film, which it isn't.The film's most pleasant surprise is Burt Reynolds as the playboy millionaire, a performance that doesn't invite comparisons with any except earlier ones by Mr. Reynolds. He sings reasonably well. He dances. He plays the comedy lightly and earnestly, with low-key good humor of the kind that everyone else (except Miss Kahn) lacks.Best of all is the Cole Porter score and it's to the director's credit that we can at least understand all the lyrics. But this joy is not unalloyed: You keep remembering how they sound when done by Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald or Ethel Merman.",1975-03-07T05:00:00+0000

Other places for splendid viewing are Ueno Park, where there will be a festival April 6 and 7; Shinjuku Gyoen Garden, where the blossoms are double and in midApril the Prime Minister holds bis annual cherry blossom viewing party; Yasukuni Shrine to Japan's war dead, which will hold a festival April 115; and, in the center of the city, the East Garden of the Imperial Palace and the grounds around the palace moat.

us,"Learning to love, learning to work","He's a mere child, you're a typical teenager, we're sort of middleaged, she's really getting on, and he's practically dead. How ironic that technological America can accept so vaguely calibrated a continuum to tick off the ages of man. The way we dress now expresses the way we gloss over society's compartmentalization by age and generation. Lately, the young, in rebellion against tailormade conformity, broke out into a revolution of dress, if not ultimately one in fact, and now, like most revolutions, it has become a model for antirevolutionary imitation. A grandmother in St. Petersburg strolls under the palms in a size 16 duplicate of the doublek??it pants suit her daughter inlaw wears while carpooling her jerseyclad children to school in Mamaroneck yet their life expectations are as different as chalk and cheese. Now, less than five years after Kent State, coliege students (boys or girls) dip into their mother's bureau for her Yves Saint Laurent shirt, silk scarf or bulky cardigan. Even at the height of what may be described as the Mannerist Sixties, when inspired originality was the universal cry, the withit people from Harvard Square to HaightAshbury ended up looking like so many interchangeable characters in an allAmerican ethnohistoricotheatrical motley.

Though time faded the toy's features, the Boy came to love him as if he were a real rabbit. Then the Boy caught scarlet fever and the Rabbit was doomed for destruction. Providentially a loving flower fairy turned him into a rent rabbit, free to hop for eternity through a universe filled with other real rabbits. An English lady, Margery Williams, wrote 4,000 wellchosen words about him. Illustrated with 7 nostalgic drawings by William Nicholson, these were quietly published as The Velveteen Rabbit in England in 1922, four years later in the United States. Very quietlyfor, with a few exceptions, children's reviewers ignored the book. Sales were modest  a few thousand copies a year  but Doubleday kept it in print. Then about 1967, when Love had become a Big Thing, college students, hippies, Protestant clergymen and Catholic nuns began to dis cover the tale as a parable they could take to their hearts. Since then more than 400,000 copies have been bought in hardcover. Now, in good time for Easter, Avon is publishing it in a format identical with Doubleday's except that the covers are soft  at $1.50 a treasure for Rabbit lovers regardless of age.",1975-03-09T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Israeli Comedy:'Daughters, Daughters!' Falls Short of Style","""Daughters, Daughters!"" is an Israeli comedy that becomes bleak when it means to be bittersweet and sentimental when it means to be robust. I suspect the reason it keeps falling short is that its central character is a man whose self-absorption is more cruel than comic.Sabbetay Alfandari (Shai K. Ophir) is a rich, middle-aged businessman, a tyrant around the house, a man obsessed by the fact that he has eight daughters and no sons. He's terrible to his wife, to his daughters, to his young mistress. In a last desperate effort to get a male heir he resorts to magic and succeeds in making both his wife and his mistress even more miserable.""Daughters, Daughters!,"" the official Israeli entry at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, treats its male chauvinist pig too seriously to allow us laughs at his expense. We are, instead, appalled, mostly because Mr. Ophir is an actor of such heaviness that he never seems to be kidding, nor does his plight seem especially important in the context of the real-life Israel we see around him.Like ""the House on Chelouche Street,"" which was also directed by Menahem Golan, ""Daughters, Daughters!"" is a film that fails to find a distinctive tragic comic style. What charm it has depends entirely on the performances, particularly on that of Zaharira Harifal, a big, handsome, expansive actress who transforms the wife into a woman of real comic pathos.""Daughters, Daughters!"" opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse.",1975-03-10T05:00:00+0000

Alvin Dark was sitting there, in a green chair, when Wes Stock, the pitching coach, stopped by with a suggestion that would slightly alter the workout schedule. It's all right with me, Dark agreed, as long as the hitters get plenty of battng practice. Now that the threetime World Series champions no longer employ Jim (Catfish) Hunter, their manager realizes that the hitters must produce more runs this season if the A's are to win their fifth consecutive American League West title. And that's where the color scheme continues. Much of the pitching staff is green except for the golden arms of Ken Holtzman, Vida Blue and Rollie Fingers; the new second baseman, Phil Garner, is green but the other hitters are solid gold, so much so that Alvin Dark's primary cerebral concern is where to insert Billy Williams, the designated hitter ransomed from the Chicago Cubs, in the batting order.",1975-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Streisand as Fanny Brice (Continued),"""Funny Lady,"" wherein Ray Stark, the producer, and Barbra Streisand, his star, continue the Fanny Brice story they began in ""Funny Girl,"" looks like a somewhat aged mirror-image of the first film. Everything that happens to Fanny, including the crises that prompt her to burst into song, as well as the new songs she bursts into, are calculated to repeat the responses evoked by ""Funny Girl."" If you have a good thing going for you, you obviously don't junk it.In ""Funny Lady"" Fanny is a little older and a big Broadway star of the depressed nineteen-thirties, but her private life is a mess. Stardom is a hollow thing for poor Fanny. Her luck in men is still terrible. No sooner has she been dumped for the umpteenth time by Nick Arnstein, again played by Omar Sharif, than she becomes involved with and marries pint-sized song writer-producer Billy Rose, played by tall, athletic James Caan in the casting non sequitur of the decade.Billy, like Nick, bristles at being referred to as ""Mr. Brice."" He also wears garish pajamas, a habit that, when combined with his own ambition for fame, makes their marriage an impossibility. It isn't long before Fanny is singing the blues again. And again and again.As long as Miss Streisand as Fanny is singing the blues, or singing anything else, ""Funny Lady"" is superb entertainment, but the minute she stops the movie turns into a concrete souffl. It's heavy and tasteless. Also, in attempting to be understanding to all its real-life characters (or to their memories), the movie is so bland that it makes little sense. Moments meant to be dramatic are embarrassingly bad.The score includes a lot of fine old standards written by the late Mr. Rose (""Me and My Shadow,"" ""More Than You Know,"" ""Paper Moon"") and a bunch of new songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb. Mr. Kander and Mr. Ebb are talented composers (they did ""Cabaret"" among other things) but I had the feeling that they wrote their score for ""Funny Lady"" with a gun at their heads, being told to come up with song-by-song equivalents to the great ""Funny Girl"" numbers by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill.To match ""Don't Rain on My Parade"" from ""Funny Girl,"" they have written ""Let's Hear It for Me."" For ""Who Are You Now?"" they've written ""How Lucky Can You Get?"" Herbert Ross, who staged the musical numbers in ""Funny Girl"" and directed everything in ""Funny Lady,"" even repeats staging tricks from the first film, including a helicopter sequence. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with this, I suppose, but it makes ""Funny Lady"" predictable and it works against the star in unintended ways.When Miss Streisand takes over a good song or tears into a revue sketch, there should be the sense of discovery we always get with unique performers. Our awareness of the calculation that went into this film diminishes even its good moments.Miss Streisand looks sensational most of the time and is so forceful that even a good strong actor like Mr. Caan seems sort of feeble.Nostalgia note: James Wong Howe, the great old Hollywood cameraman who did such films as ""The Thin Man,"" ""Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" ""Sweet Smell of Success"" and ""The Rose Tattoo,"" was the cinematographer for ""Funny Lady,"" which is as full of microscopically loving close-ups as a nature film about the life of a queen bee.",1975-03-12T05:00:00+0000

The documentary was screened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art.The record of those three weeks in April and Mayand 2,000 miles of travelis picturesque, authentic and sincere but unfortunately no more inclusive of all points of view than those of the comparatively few, uniformly contented, industrious Chinese who appear on film.Although this ""China Memoir"" is not explicit as to why the Mao Government invited Miss MacLaine and the ""regular American women"" she chose for the junket, as well as the ""regular Chinese"" and the English-speaking guides they met, all were charming and natural. Included were a Texas housewife (Pat Branson), a black Mississippi activist (Unita Blackwell), a Navajo (Ninibah Crawford), a California psychologist (Phyllis Kornhauden), a Bostonian (Margaret Whitman), a Puerto Rican sociologist (Rosa Marin) and a 13-year-old Californian (Karen Boutilier).The tripshot in appealing color by Claudia Weill, who led the distaff technical crewjumps kaleidoscopically in visits to Canton, Shanghai, Hangchow and Peking. But the film evolves as a generally eye-catching spectrum of happy people in such places as homes, farms, day-care centers, city communes, schools, hospitals, the Great Wall, the ballet and Peking's May Day celebration, which was apparently appreciated by the inquisitive tourists and their cooperative hosts.If this curious group concentrated on ""the other half of the sky"" achieved by the liberated Chinese women; it also focuses on some unusual vignettes of mainland life. Included among these is a Caesarian delivery filmed in intimate, clinical detail in which the mother is anesthetized by acupuncture and is even fed a meal during the painless operation. Also, there's a discussion of social and political issues with Teng Ying-chao, which unfolds as a rare and effective close-up of Premier Chou Enlai's wife.Nowhere, however, is there an indication of crime, poverty, deprivation or unhappiness among China's 800 million people. And some of the Chinese seriously questioned by Miss MacLaine and the others, gently point out that artistic, musical and literary creativity must conform to Maoist principles.While it is not noted on screen, Miss MacLaine told reporters on the eve of her journey that ""in China, the equality of women is an official fact. In America we haven't achieved it. I'm curious to see how it all compares.""The comparison in ""The Other Side of the Sky"" is not entirely conclusive. It is an interesting, sometimes fascinating, if one-sided picture of the East that is still fairly mysterious.",1975-03-13T05:00:00+0000

us,"Redford Is Waldo Pepper, Jaunty Pilot","Goggles, gallantry and white silk scarves flying from the cockpits of ancient biplanes. George Roy Hill's ""The Great Waldo Pepper,"" which opened at three theaters yesterday, is set in the nineteen-twenties and is about stunt flying when airplanes were truly dangerous, when they expressed a pilot's eccentricities, and when he could feel the immediate force of the air he was flying through. It's set in that long-ago time before airplanes had become flying bus terminals.The film is about self-confident, nervy Waldo Pepper (Robert Redford), a former World War I pilot who, Snoopy-like, dreams of the glory he was denied during real combat and then, in a Pirandellian twist, realizes it at long last in Hollywood, where dreams are manufactured by the yard.""The Great Waldo Pepper"" is a most appealing movie. Its moods don't quite mesh and its aerial sequences are so vividsometimes literally breathtakingthat they upstage the human drama, but the total effect is healthily romantic. It's the kind of movie that enriches dreams even though its story seems sort of strung-out, like a first draft, and includes moments that slip into bathos.As much as the movie is carried by its marvelous aerial sequences, it is made moving by Mr. Hill's passion for flying and his generosity toward the fanatics who bounced around the country after World War I, picking up small change"" while risking their lives at air circuses or running sightseeing tours from cleared cornfields.It's this passion and generosity that make ""The Great Waldo Pepper"" seem a more important, a more personal film than either of his two earlier smash hits, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and the phenomenally profitable ""The Sting."" You get the feeling that in this film, as well as in his ""Slaughterhouse-Five,"" he has put himself on the line.The faults of the film are real. The character of Waldo Pepper doesn't seem either mad or possessed enough to support the movie's ending. I'm not sure whether this has to do with the way the role is written or with the way Mr. Redford plays it, which is as a cheerful, fundamentally decent rogue, not too different from any number of other conventional adventure heroes. But Waldo Pepper should be different, someone who is probably as nasty as he is poetic, if the drama is to make sense.The subsidiary characters are, with one important exception, more interesting. They include Waldo's good-natured, indestructible stunt-pilot pal, played by Bo Svenson, Margot Kidder as the girl to whom Waldo returns after every accident, Susan Sarandon as a small-town girl who gets a star-complex when she joins the flying circus, and Edward Herrmann who plays Waldo's designer-friend who has the crazy dream of building a monoplane.The exception is Bo Brundin, who plays the former German ace who, in the postwar years, is reduced to tank-town stunting to make a living. His life has been all downhill since the momentous morning when, over a French countryside during the war, he shot down four Allied pilots in a matter of seconds.

us,Film: A New Neil Simon:'Prisoner of Second Avenue' Opens,"If Neil Simon's adaptation of his 1971 Broadway hit, ""The Prisoner of Second Avenue,"" which arrived at the Sutton yesterday, is less than an overpowering study of a married couple driven to distraction by the irritations and indignities of local middle-class living, it still scores valid points, both serious and funny. This time, the largely farcical kind of Manhattan madnesses Mr. Simon observed in his 1970 film, ""The Out-of-Towners,"" have the impact of reality that has been humanely dulled by injections of relevant comedy.Comparisons are odious, but it should be noted that the play hasn't been changed appreciably in its transition to the screen. And, if Melvin Frank's direction is polished but not innovative, he is ably aided by a cast headed by Jack Lemmon and Anne Bancroft, who project forcefully natural characterization that are as realistic as the authentic Second Avenue and other New York sites caught by the color cameras.As in the original, New York is hardly a wonderful town for Mr. Simon's principals. Mr. Lemmon is frustrated and anxiety-ridden because of the faulty air-conditioning and inconsiderate neighbors in his high-rise apartment house, among other things. And, his fraying nerves aren't helped much when he is dismissed by his faltering firm. As a jobless ad executive, he cannot be blamed for railing at an unemployment office clerk. And he shouldn't be criticized for banging on fragile walls, cursing the neighbors, who douse him with water in retaliation, and developing neuroses inflamed by enforced idleness and visits to a non-committal psychiatrist.If Anne Bancroft, as his truly loving helpmate who resolutely gets a job to support them, becomes tense and confused to the point of paranoia, she, too, can't be faulted for her rising fears when she loses that job and must decide whether to accept financial help from her husband's concerned, if questioning, relatives.Mr. Lemmon, no stranger to Mr. Simon's work (""The Odd Couple,"" ""The Out-of-Towners""), and Miss Bancroft are simply an unromanticized, believable team as recognizable in their comic and serious give-and-take as many of New York's scrambling millions. And they get sturdy, pointed support from Gene Saks, as Mr. Lemmon's well-to-do, plain-speaking but doting older brother and Elizabeth Wilson and Florence Stanley, as his careful-sisters, among others.They aren't involved in Greek tragedy or in common-place television situation comedy. Mr. Simon is serious about a theme that isn't earth-shaking and he understandably cloaks its gravity with genuine chuckles that pop up mostly as radio news bulletins such as the flash that a Polish freighter has just run into the Statue of Liberty. And, with a cast whose members appreciate what they're saying and doing, the gnawing problems of ""Second Avenue"" become a pleasure.",1975-03-15T05:00:00+0000

Although it is unlikely that Ibsen took this image for the title of his play directly from Dickens, it is noteworthy that two such different artists employed the same metaphor to describe the destiny that society expected of the married woman in the 19th century. One need not be biased to believe that this coincidence of expression was not an isolated accident, but was rather an indication of how prevalent the notion had become that something was very much. amiss in the Victorian household. Indeed, it is hard to think of any novelist or dramatist of the time who did not depict and analyze the use and abuse of female energy, showing it either being coerced into romantic disaster or being subjected to the deadening attrition of the mores of a middleclass parlor. Male writers who would never have endorsed feminist proposals nevertheless, as artists, had enough intellectual conscience to agree with George Eliot that the need for a female epos was both pressing and dangerous.",1975-03-16T05:00:00+0000

But it also shows that women have responded to these changes in a variety of waysas millenarian prophetesses, bread rioters, writers of tracts; workers on strikeand that these roles and beliefs have shaped the contemporary movement for women's social equality.

Thirtyfive years after its founding at Antioch College amidst the alarums of a distant war, The Antioch Review is bogged down in another nasty little war between its former editor and college officials. The latest issue of the literary magazine (the last issue appeared in November; 1973) is being held up at the printers, awaiting binding, in the thrall of an unpaid $3,000 bill. The college says it will pay the bill but only if an offending editorial by the deposed editor, Lawrence Grauman, is kept out. Mr. Graumairs contract was terminated, and he was subsequently summarily dismissed, last summer after he had incensed college officials by (1) taking a blind ad in The New York Review offering the financially strapped magazine for adoption and (2) sending out a letter to its subscribers in June of last year predicting the magazine's probable demise. Later, Mr. Grauman refused to sign a memorandum of understanding with the college promising not to make any derogatory remarks about the college or any references to the dispute in the issue. Claiming that such an agreement constituted prior restraint, Mr. Grauman wrote a rambling editorial with blank spaces where references to the dispute would have appeared. The editorial, he said, was intended to demonstrate 'what censorship would be like if I had knuckled under. College officials then sought an injunction against the publication of the magazine (by Mr. Grauman, that is), and Mr. Grauman has filed a blizzard of countersuits. The upshot is that any hope of a settlement that would free the delayed issue seems increasingly remote. A college official has said that it will not pay the $3,000 printer's bill for the thoughts of a cashiered editor and called the editorial petulant and selfserving.",1975-03-16T05:00:00+0000

us,They stumbled blindly into marriage,"This precise, affecting and gently clairvoyant first novel (by an accomplished writer of short stories) has formed a rather peculiar triad in my mind: with Rona Jaffe's Family Secrets and Ingmar Bergman's Scenes From a Marriage! Alice Adams's book is warmer, surer of what it is doing, and more closely focused on its people than Rona Jaffe's; it does not have the extreme closeup quality, the stifling, riveting intensity, of Bergman's film. In accomplishment too it falls somewhere in between Bergman's discomfiting genius and Jaffe's flawed but intriguing venture beyond the autobiographical. But what all three have in commonafter a period of interminable, sweating subjectivityis a tone of perspective and reconciliation that comes of seeing human lives and relationships across time. I wonder whether this is a tendency, a reaction or swing towards the classical temper; certainly it's a swing back towards regarding the social and interpersonal as a rich field for artistic exploration. After our long immersion in the individual psyche and its obsessions, we are rediscovering the pleasures of the omniscient point of view: the pleasures, differently, of Austen and of James.",1975-03-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Storey's 'In Celebration' Is Moving Film,"David Storey's ""In Celebration,"" the American Film Theater's third offering in its current subscription season, brilliantly demonstrates what the A.F.T. is supposed to be up to: presenting films that preserve the quality and excitement of superior theatrical performances of plays we might not otherwise be able to see.""In Celebration"" is an early play by Mr. Storey, the English novelist (""This Sporting Life"") and playwright who has been represented on Broadway by ""Home"" and ""The Changing Room."" Although ""In Celebration"" has been done by the Arena Stage in Washington, it's never been seen in New York, an oversight now corrected by this fine, spare screen adaptation, directed by Lindsay Anderson with most of the cast he directed in the play's original Royal Court production in London.The film, which was given two performances at selected theaters here yesterday, will be repeated twice today.""In Celebration"" is a family play that recalls most immediately O'Neill's ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" though the spectacular passions of the O'Neill characters appear muted in Mr. Storey's work. The passions are there, certainly, but they are inhibited as much by love as by class attitudes. Also, they lack the furious poetry with which the Tyrones of ""Long Day's Journey"" expressed themselves while tearing into one another.The outbursts of Mr. Storey's characters are in no way cathartic. They reveal ancient wounds, which, seen briefly, are scratched again in passing. New scabs form on old scars and everyone tries to ignore the pain.The setting is a coal mining town in the north of England and the occasion is the wedding anniversary of a wiry, 64-year-old miner named Shaw (Bill Owen) and the girl above his station he married 40 years earlier after getting her in trouble. Mrs. Shaw (Constance Chapman) is a model wife and mother, the principal mover behind the three sons who went to the university, moved out of the working class and now, each in a different way, feel disconnected from their environments.Andrew (Alan Bates), the eldest, has thrown over his career as a lawyer to become an abstract painter of no great drive or talent. Colin (James Bolam) is a successful labor negotiator for a large automobile company. Colin is a fastidious man. He talks in upbeat clichs but he clings to his self-confidence with desperation, as if it were the only life-preserver around. Steven Shaw (Brian Cox), the youngest son, is on dead-center, the father of four children and a writer with a block the size of the Tower of London.In the course of the reunion, Mr. Storey presents a family portrait that is immensely moving and sad. The cramped, neat little row house, recently refurnished by the affluent Colin, hides skeletons everywhere. Resentments fester but only Andrew, played with edgy flamboyance by Mr. Bates, comes close to exposing them. Andrew remembers his mother bragging of having once studied ""human hygiene,"" then he adds: ""There are no alien bodies in this house.""They are all alien bodies, Mr. Storey seems to be saying, but through no conscious fault of anyone. Mrs. Shaw, played by Miss Chapman with a kind of near-sighted innocence, may well be the villain even though there's never been any malice in her.Mr. Anderson, who directed the film version of ""This Sporting Life,"" has succeeded in making a very complete, full-bodied film of Mr. Storey's play without being tricky or intrusive. When the camera ranges beyond the Shaw parlor, the principal battleground, there is always a point to the movement. Mr. Anderson has also gotten terrific performances from everyone, especially Mr. Bates, Miss Chapman and Mr. Cox, as the most troubled of the Shaw sons.Toward the end of the film, ""In Celebration"" recalls Chekhov. More things have been said than anyone wants to acknowledge. In spite of this, life will go on more or less as before. There is a major difference between Chekhov and Mr. Storey, however. There is no brighter tomorrow for the Shaws. It's already arrivedand it's no less bleak than yesterday.",1975-03-18T05:00:00+0000

As a first feature recently completed on the West Coast by a 30-year-old Californian, Richard R. Schmidt, with the cooperation of a relatively unknown small team, the convoluted comedy-drama rarely rises above an over-all look of unresolved improvisations.The film, a program note explains, ""presents itself as a gangster story,"" which actually becomes the portraits of ""three lives searching through the script to find their own identities."" Much of the script is projected through the ""writings"" of one of the actors, Richard A. Richardson, and much of this dialogue is, for no especially effective reason, repeated as subtitles.Mr. Richardson, lanky, laconic and square-jawed, is, we discover after many circuitous reflections, a Vietnam veteran who has knocked around and ""always wanted to make a film"" but whose ""writings"" and performance hardly sparkle. Caroline Zaremba, a pretty, if somewhat wan brunette given to posing and sudden bursts of laughter is, we learn, finding her identity through her all-too-recent discovery of Mr. Richardson in the making of the film. And, Edward Nylund, a benign 60-year-old man enlisted to play the ""killer,"" is cheerfully involved because ""I'm the only older person they knew.""But despite their obvious sincerity, their identities remain vague and unimpressive and ""A Man, a Woman and a Killer"" emerges as a largely static and undramatic film about the making of a film.",1975-03-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"'The Yakuza,' a Cinematic Hybrid About Obligation","Beware ""The Yakuza."" This movie, which opened yesterday at the Criterion and Beekman theaters, is a cinematic hybrid that crosses American stars, writers and a director with a popular Japanese film form. To come upon it unsuspecting is a little like opening an Almond Joy wrapper and finding inside the arrangement of fish, rice and seaweed known as nori maki.The effect is surprising; the contents prove, upon examination, not unattractive; but the product as a whole has a potential for evoking revulsion or ridicule from anyone whose mind clenches at the exotic or whose heart is firmly set upon an Almond Joy.Yakuza are Japanese thugs, who, in their most romanticized form, are latter-day samurai with a touch of Robin Hood thrown in. As a group, they are comparable to the Mafia, with warring factions, overlords, a boss of bosses and a formal code of behavior.""The Yakuza"" is a movie about obligationof American to American, of Japanese to American and of American to Japanese. It is also, in keeping with its genre, a movie of bloody gunplay and swordplay, of death and dismemberment unreeled with such momentum that the expectant and horrified mind's eye is sent hurtling repeatedly past the audacious brinksmanship of the editing into unseen but imagined freshets of gore.Out of a sense of obligation, Harry Kilmer (Robert Mitchum) agrees to help and old friend, George Tanner (Brian Keith), whose daughter has been kidnapped by a yakuza boss who believes that Keith has cheated him on a gun deal. To accomplish his undertaking, Mitchum is compelled to enlist the aid of Tanaka Ken played by Takakura Ken), a former yakuza and a moral relic who is obligated to Mitchum despite long-standing enmity.What follows is predictably combative, reaching a breathtakingly tense climax as Takakura, armed with a sword and backed by a gun-toting Mitchum, takes on a swarm of adversaries.Although admirable for its understated contrast of hoary ritual with modern trappings, ""The Yakuza,"" written by Paul Schrader and Robert Towne (""Chinatown"") and with Sydney Pollack (""The Way We Were"") as producer-director, is also didactic. It is slowed by the need to instruct its audience in the way of the yakuza; it is marred in its early exposition by some impenetrable Japanese-accented English; it is burdened by the attenuation of an unexciting love interest (which Mitchum's character freely admits being too old for); and a couple of formidably important revelations are simply dropped in, as though no one had the time to plot them properly.To some extent this movie pays the penalty for breaking ground with a new audience.But its merits as an action film strongly dosed with exotic culture and subculture are offset by obvious flaws. Neither fans of Almond Joy nor of nori maki are likely to be wholly satisfied by ""The Yakuza,"" but those who don't mind sampling both won't go away famished.",1975-03-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Four Cheers for Lester's Light-Headed 'Musketeers',"""What could be better than The Three Musketeers?"" the ads ask, and then go on to answer, ""The Four Musketeer."" I agree.Richard Lester's ""The Four Musketeers,"" which opened yesterday at Loew's State 2 and Cine Theaters, is the concluding and (to my way of thinking) better half of the two part film Mr. Lester introduced last year as ""The Three Musketeers."" Everything about the film  including the cast  is the same only lighter, funnier, less burdened by exposition, though there are still large remnants of the old Dumas plot to be got through.The Queen of France (Geraldine Chaplin) is still carrying on with the English Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward) who is warring with Anne's husband, Louis XIII (Jean Pierre Casse). The King's loyal Musketeers spend a great deal of their time saving pretty Anne's reputation from exposure by the ambitious Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston), who is always the villain of the piece though his vision of France is positively DeGaullean.Even the romantic criss-crossing of loyalties seems funnier in this second film, perhaps because one doesn't spend too much time worrying about who is doing what to whom or why. It doesn't matter.""The Four Musketeers"" is beautifully light-headed, the sort of movie in which Raquel Welch (as the Queen's seamstress) gets herself kidnapped by what is, in effect, a pile of watermelons. It's a movie that asks the questions: How do you blindfold a one-eyed man who already wears an eye-patch on his bad eye? Vertically?The 17th-century settings are grand and occasionally almost surreal, as when we watch the King and Queen picnicking in a field of daisies, listening to a portable pipe organ, while several rebels hang by their necks from a nearby tree.The time is seasonless, as in any good fairy tale, winter one day and midsummer the next. The funniest, most stylish performances are those of Mr. Heston as the wicked Cardinal, and Faye Dunaway as Richelieu's most accomplished spy, though everyone else is also in top form, including Michael York as D'Artagnan and Miss Welch as his accident-prone mistress.One of these days ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"" will make a terrific double-bill.",1975-03-20T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film::'Tommy,' The Who's Rock Saga","Ken Russell makes movies the way another man might design a ride through a funhouse. He deals in headlong but harmless plunges from giddy heights, abrupt changes of pace, joke turns, anachronistic visual effects, ghouls that pop out of the dark, all accompanied by sound of a force to loosen one's most firmly rooted back teeth.The method is spectacular but it has seemed wickedly foolish in movies like ""The Music Lovers"" (about Tchaikovsky), ""The Savage Messiah"" (about Gaudier-Brzeska) and ""The Devils"" (an adaptation of Huxley's ""The Devils of Loudun""). Now at long last the man and his method have found a nearly perfect match in subject matter, ""Tommy,"" The Who's rock opera written by guitarist-composer Pete Townshend.""Tommy"" can take being fiddled with, and Mr. Russell's ""Tommy"" virtually explodes with excitement on the screen. A lot of it is not quite the profound social commentary it pretends to be, but that's beside the point of the fun. ""Tommy,"" which opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld Theater, is mad, funny, irreverent, passionately overproduced, very very loud and full of the kind of magnificent physical energy that usually wrecks a movie by calling attention to performance.""Tommy"" is a solemn tale that must not be taken too seriously. It's an elaborate put-on about the terrible victimization of a small boy who is traumatized deaf, dumb and blind when he sees his stepfather murder his real father. Young Tommy then goes on to become the pinball champ of the world and, eventually, after he miraculously regains his senses, the new messiah who preaches salvation through pinball playing.Mr. Russell's style, which had the effect of literalizing the artistic impulse in ""The Music Lovers"" and ""The Savage Messiah,"" seems to liberate Mr. Townshend's rock score and lyrics, which are sometimes in embarrassingly dead earnest.""Tommy"" is composed of excesses. Bad jokes or heavy-handed satire are redeemed by everyonedirector, production designer, orchestrators, actorsgoing too far, which is, after all, what the original ""Tommy"" is all about: a world inhabited by people too jaded to react to anything but overdoses.The performers are extravagantly fine, particularly Ann-Margret who, as Tommy's mother, ages 20 years in the course of the film (largely through the increased application of blue eye shadow) and sings and dances as if the fate of Western civilization depended upon it. She is tough, vulgar, witty and game. The Who's lead singer, Roger Daltrey, plays the grown-up Tommy with a drive that matches Ann-Margret's while successfully simulating show biz innocence. Oliver Reed is, correctly, almost a cartoon as the opportunistic stepdad. He also sings quite nicely.The movie, which has the structure of a vaudeville show, is laced together with specialty bits, some of which are simply jokes (Jack Nicholson playing a vacuous Harley Street medical specialist) and some of which are production numbers as riveting as rock can be at its best. These include a sequence in which Tina Turner shows up as The Acid Queen who attempts to cure the catatonic Tommy, and others with Elton John, as the Pinball Wizard defeated by Tommy, and Eric Clapton, as the Preacher who presides over a Lourdes-like shrine devoted to the healing powers of St. Marilyn (Monroe).As I said, it's all fairly excessive and far from subtle, but in this case good taste would have been wildly inappropriate and a fearful drag.",1975-03-20T05:00:00+0000

The question is: Do you wish to designate $1 of your taxes to this [Presidential Election Campaign] fund? A checkmark in the Yes box on that line authorizes the Internal Revenue Service to place one dollar of that return into the fundat no cost whatsoever to the taxpayer, either in actual payments or in the amount of refund.",1975-03-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Encore Lelouch,"As a somewhat cynical French romantic in love with love and with movie cameras, Claude Lelouch first clicked here in 1966 with ""A Man and a Woman."" He scores with ""And Now My Love,"" which arrived at the Fine Arts yesterday. This exploration of how an attractive young pair of Parisian strangers come to be smitten at first sight evolves as a tender dissection of the couple and of the two generations that preceded them. It makes the improbable fairy-tale ending realistic and persuasive.""And Now My Love"" is, in fact, more sweeping than its French title, ""Tout Une Vie,"" implies in the succession of lives exposed to illustrate the family backgrounds of the hero and heroine, who are fated to meet only at the film's end. If the director was a mite self-indulgent with his camera in ""A Man and a Woman,"" ""The Crook,"" and ""Love Is a Funny Thing,"" he has used it this time for constructive and illuminating effect.The past, he strongly indicates, impinges on the present. So, with speed, humor and appreciation of vintage movie making, we're introduced to the respective grandparents by way of pre-World War I silent but subtitled black-and-white footage, then to the couple-to-be's Jewish parents, who've met after being freed from Nazi concentration camps.Thus, the parallel inspections of preceding generations add substance to the film's contemporary personalities. Sarah, the daughter of the concentration-camp survivor, is as troubled as her doting father. When she falls in love as a teen-ager with the pop singer Gilbert Becaud, her opposite number, Simon, is being jailed for stealing some Becaud records.Their careers proceed along trying paths to maturity; she goes from bored dilettante to conscientious social awareness, and he from convict to work with porno and commercial films and, eventually, to recognition as a rising movie maker.But Mr. Lelouch is not just spinning a chronology. Included in his kaleidoscopic inspection are pertinent observations on the spinning social scene. And the implications of ideologies and the future being spelled out by scientists also serve to develop believable human beings.In their portrayals of the major characters over the years, a slim, blond, photogenic Marthe Keller and an intense Charles Denner project the anxieties, sorrows and joys of people making the best of changing worlds. Andr Dusssollier is natural and appealing as Simon, whose instincts remain decent despite a rough road to success. They are professionally supported by, among others, Mr. Becaud and Charles Grard as Mr. Dussollier's jailmate and friend.Mr. Lelouch, of course, gives amour its due in ""And Now My Love,"" but this is not nearly so impressive as his perceptive, often touching portraits of three eras and their principals.",1975-03-22T05:00:00+0000

These two young, gifted and very attractive women spent hours exchanging details of their suicide attempts; and after Sylvia Plath's successful attempt some years later, Anne Sexton wrote a poem that belongs with the most terrible and yet the most intelligent and convincing work of what is loosely called the confessional mode. The poem is Wanting to Die. and it is included in Live or Die, Anne Sexton's third volume.

The hardbound advance for the Luciano book was reportedly $150,000it is also a Bookofthe Month Club main selectionand a paperback house at one point weighed in with an $800,000 bid for its rights, which is pretty good dough even at Carlo Gambino's level.

Try to get a flight that arrives before 6 P.M., when the sun goes down. As your plane approaches Barbados, it will skirt the island's west and southcoast beaches and you will get a glimpse of seas so blue you'll catch your breath. The island, 21 miles long and 14 miles wide, is a former British colony that was granted independence in 1966 and has a population of 249,000, relatively large for the Caribbean. It stands outside the arc of islands called the Lesser Antilles, 100 miles to the west, which form a dividing line between the calm Caribbean and the Atlantic surge. Barbados gets the best of both worlds: on the western side an endless sandy shoreline and an azure sea, on the eastern side a rugged, breezy coastline with whitetopped rollers, good for experienced surfers but not so safe for a lazy swim. Barbados is a coral island, flat compared to the wild, volcanic terrain of the Antilles, but it does have 1,100foot Mount Hillaby, which is high enough for you to admire both coastlines from. Photographers should test their skill by shooting the sunset over the west coast waters.

us,"'Hearts and Minds,' a Film Study of Power","Power is virtually the first word heard in Peter Davis's epic documentary, ""Hearts and Minds,"" and power, real and mythical, is what the film contemplates in as many tones and moods as you might expect in superior fiction.""Hearts and Minds,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema 2, recalls this nation's agoninzing involvement in Vietnam, something you may think you know all about, including the ending. But you don't. Just as television's presentation of the war made it seem small, orderly and comprehensible, to fit the physical dimensions of the television set and the programing schedules of the television industry, ""Hearts and Minds"" deals in disorderliness, contradictions and historical perspectives that are often shadowy, subject to any number of interpretations.Mr. Davis, who made the award-winning television documentary. ""The Selling of the Pentagon,"" makes no attempt to justify the American involvement in Vietnam, which, it's obvious, he believes to have been a disaster. ""Hearts and Minds,"" however, is so various, so full of associations that go beyond the war, that the film does a lot more than preach to the committed.Some sympathetic, liberal criticslistening to their own well-meaning, must-be-fair-to-everyone conscienceshave expressed sorrow that Mr. Davis has occasionally loaded his dice, that he has allowed himself to make points cheaply by, for example, cross-cutting between a pious Gen. William C. Westmoreland talking about the cheapness of life in the Orient and a small Vietnamese boy's sobbing at a gravesite. This is correct as far as it goes, but to dwell on it is to miss the more profound meaning of an extraordinary movie, which may well be the true film for America's bicentennial.""Hearts and Minds"" is not about General Westmoreland, nor the succession of United States Presidents and their advisers who sought desperately and probably sincerely to understand Vietnam. Rather it's about the generations of attitudes, wishes and beliefs that these men represented. It's about the power the country inherited.Mr. Davis uses old newsreel footage as well as new material that he shot in Vietnam, in this country and in France. He also uses clips from old Hollywood movies and dozens of interviews with peasants and policy-makers, with American civilians and fighting men, some of whom survived as physical wrecks and some of whom returned home more convinced than ever of America's mission to save the world from what J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon B. Johnson pronounced ""Comun-ism.""An interview with Clark Clifford, the former Secretary of Defense, at the beginning of the film sets what I take to be the theme when Mr. Clifford recalls the extraordinary economic, military and industrial power the United States found itself with at the end of World War II. The film then goes on to examine the nearly suicidal effects of that power when it was explained, justified, defined and, in particular, when it was wielded as something that had been God-given rather than as something inherited through one of the most marvelous accidents  the unplanned conjunction of people, place and timein recorded history.I don't think the film means to knock American achievements but only to point out that a certain lack of perspective, of modesty, perhaps, can be close to fatal.""Hearts and Minds"" has a lot to say about an average American's education and, indeed, about his ability to reeducate himself as conditions change. At one point Daniel Ellsberg remembers having looked at Vietnam in gung-ho World War II terms, when it was possible easily to distinguish the good guys from the bad, to see a war clearly in terms of territory won and lost. Vietnam was something terrifyingly new to the World War II people. The origins and the issues were not neat and tidy.This is what ""Hearts and Minds"" so vividly recognizes in a collage of scenes that, though blunt and often harrowing, eventually demonstrate something that I. F. Stone once said about the survival of the Vietnamese people through years of bombing. Their incredible survival, said Mr. Stone, has reestablished ""the primacy of man in the age of technology.""""Hearts and Minds"" is a tough film but it is no mere rehash of sad events. It is always aware of the primacy of man when man's given even half a chance.",1975-03-24T05:00:00+0000

When Talent wins, Mr. Preminger makes good, tough commercial films""Such Good Friends,"" ""The Man With the Golden Arm,"" and ""Anatomy of a Murder."" When Nerve triumphs he may come up with ""Skidoo"" or something like his latest, ""Rosebud,"" a suspense melodrama of such ineptitude, lethargy and loose ends that only someone with his arm being twisted would take credit for it.Though there is some action in the film, and a lot of moving around, ""Rosebud"" consists principally of exposition, spoken by people with accents so thick that only Mr. Preminger might understand them, about a group of Arab terrorists who have kidnapped five rich girls and hold them for a ransom I'm not sure is ever defined.The exposition takes place in Paris, the south of France, Corsica and Israel, but which scenes are set where is one of the film's lesser mysteries. The people we hear most often are a tattered Central Intelligence Agency man (Peter O'Toole ), who masquerades as a Newsweek correspondent: a renegade Englishman (Richard Attenborough) who has turned Muslim and is planning his own holy war against Israel and Communist-leaning Arabs, and a nice, clean-cut Israeli intelligence officer (Cliff Gorman).Some of the other speakers include actors of the stature of Claude Dauphin, Peter Lawford and Raf Vallone, and one former Mayor, John V. Lindsay, whose discomfiture seems no greater or lesser than that of his colleagues.Mr. Lindsay plays a United States Senator, the father of one of the hijacked girls, a man whose manner of looking worried is to look elegant. Mr. Lindsay thus is reduced to displaying haberdashery, which, as those of us know who've seen him sing and dance in local Inner Circle shows, is a waste of one of the city's natural resources.The screenplay was written by Eric Lee Preminger, the director's son, with additional dialogue by Marjorie Kellogg, the author of ""Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon."" Their consistently idiotic work includes the following bit of dialogue about Rosebud, which is the name of the yacht on which the kidnapped girls disappear: ""Rosebud,"" says someone, ""that's a strange name for a yacht. What's it mean?"" ""I'm not sure,"" is the reply, ""I think it has something to do with a movie.""This ""Rosebud,"" which opened yesterday at the Plaza and Paramount Theaters, is pure camp.",1975-03-25T05:00:00+0000

But there's little in ""Brannigan"" to dispel the nagging notion that after more than 200 largely Western adventures shot over 45 years, he is still the indestructible cow-poke despite a Chicago detective's badge and the contemporary London locale. The results are no more convincing than a standard shootout on a Hollywood set.""Brannigan,"" it should be noted, generates a suspicion of self-parody since, it will be recalled, our hero also played a police lieutenant in last year's ""McQ."" But as a cop, he again is the rough, if tiring, hombre, who's quick with his gun and fists, hates bad guys as much as rustlers and relishes taking them on singly on gangs.This time he's the veteran dispatched to London to extradite a top racketeer for the Windy City's grand jury. As the fugitive mobster, John Vernon is blatantly obvious despite Savile Row clothes and the rich life in Mayfair. But he's surrounded by sordid types like James Booth, who kidnap him, and a double-dealing lawyer blandly played by Mel Ferrer. Of course, there's John Wayne simultaneously contending with a tenacious hit man, Daniel Pilon, imported to get him and Richard Attenborough, as Scotland Yard's smoothest sleuth, in pursuit of the rackets chief.If we're exposed to an improbable blitz of gun battles, bombings, car chases, a saloon slug fest and Judy Geeson, as Wayne's pretty, British detective aide, we're also guided on a colorful Cook's tour of such landmarks as the Garrick Club, Piccadilly, Tower Bridge and the Thames docksides. Unfortunately, Mr. Wayne's first film trip to London doesn't appear to have been necessary.

us,"Film: 'Homo Eroticus,' an Italian Farce","""Homo Eroticus,"" an Italian farce filmed in 1971 that arrived at the Eastside Cinema yesterday, is, like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, unusual but unlikely. The film's basic idea may be scientifically possible, but as a light-hearted attempt to detail the amours and trials of a young man endowed with extraordinary genitalia and drives, it doesn't kid sex so much as leer at it.As the title and English subtitles make plain, ""Homo Eroticus"" focuses largely on the dark and handsome Lando Buzzanca and his effect on the women and men of Bergamo. Let's just say that our contemporary Casanova is more than equal to his rare anatomical attributes. Up to a traumatic point, that is, which leads to a fairly happy ending.Mr. Bazzanca is athletic, if nothing else, as the peasant who has fled from his native Sicily and quickly adjusts to the romantic needs of Bergamo's society women and their maids.

It is a crowded, noisy, bustling metropolis that rose on sand dunes on the Mediterranean coast faster than it could be planned. With its flat, unexciting landscape, it never, matched the majestic grandeur of Jerusalem, Israel's capital, or the beauty of Haifa, the main harbor city. But because it was the only city in the world where the mayor, the bankers, the judges, the policemen, the firemen and the street cleaners were all Jews, it became the magnet for Jewish immigrants during the decades of British rule in Palestine. Now that there is a whole Jewish state, an allJewish city is no longer so noteworthy, but, as the biggest population center (386,000), Tel Aviv continues to set the pace in Israeli life. It is the home of the leading theaters, the best orchestra, the opera, the ballet, the press, the political parties and the big financial, commercial and business enterprises. It is a city of contrasts where immigrants from the casbahs of North Africa and from the centers of European civilization made impacts on the mode of life. One can shop for secondhand junk in an oriental bazaar in the cacophonic flea market in the Jaffa section or against the background of soft music in airconditioned department stores (Kol Bo Shalom at the corner of Ahad Haam and Herzl Street or Hamashbir Lazarhan at 115 Allenby Road). The main attraction for tourists is Jaffa, a former Arab city that was incorporated into Tel Aviv after Israel gained independence. The ancient section of the city has been restored as an artists' colony. Galleries, boutiques and gift shops have been built into the maze of alleys and vaulted walls. Exotic restaurants operate in the reconstructed ruins, and nightclubs offer strip shows or folk lore. Tel Aviv is the main base for tourists mainly because its location and transport facilities make it a convenient hub for travel around the country.",1975-03-30T05:00:00+0000
