Just follow the step-by-step that comes with Famlia Geisses Cave Amadeu Rstico Nature from southern Brazil. In sparkling wine parlance, disgorging refers to extracting the sediment, or lees, that accumulate as the wine develops. Traditionally its done by gradually turning the bottle upside down in a special rack, a technique called riddling. Once upended, the sediment falls into the neck of the bottle, which is then briefly frozen so when the cap is removed the frozen plug of sediment is expelled by the carbonation of the wine; the bottle is then corked. And you do not have to be in Mme. Pommerys chalky cellar in Reims to do it. At home you leave the bottle nearly upside down for a week, then freeze it for 90 minutes, pop off the metal cap and the sediment shoots out. Mine was perfect. Its best done outside or maybe over a bathtub. The disgorged wine is light, fizzy and pleasant. I also tried a bottle of the wine without disgorging, making it whats called a pt-nat these days. It was cloudy but with more complexity on the palate. Disgorging is worth trying at least once, and understanding what lees contribute to the wine made it doubly worthwhile.",2020-05-06T01:44:29+0000

The day will come when all the new comedy will have been made in a world after the pandemic, but we are not there yet.

But with artworks arriving and her guests expected, she shrugged at the massing clouds, determined the evening should go on. The furniture was taken inside and then reassembled an hour later once the shower had passed.

But the pilgrims on my flight from South Korea had an altogether different purpose. It was here, scarcely 15 miles from the airport, among fields now yellow with mustard flowers, that a renunciant prince had, upon gaining enlightenment some 25 centuries ago, given his first sermon, setting what Buddhists call the Wheel of Dharma into motion. At a deer park once called Isipatana, now Sarnath, a 35-year-old Gautama Buddha, hardly older than Christ when he climbed the hill of Calvary, revealed the eightfold path to liberation from suffering, his four noble truths and the doctrine of the impermanence of everything, including the Self. It was to the remains of the monastery and shrine at Sarnath that the pilgrims from East and Southeast Asia came, as pilgrims had for well over 1,500 years, along a subsidiary branch of the Great Silk Road, which ran through the high snowy mountains that girdle the Indian subcontinent into a riverine plain that stretches across what is today Pakistan and north India. The pilgrims took an exit off that highway of goods and ideas that ran from China to Rome in order to honor what may well have been the most influential doctrine to travel along its lines of transmission  the word of the Buddha, and the art made in his name.",2020-05-11T13:00:24+0000

Raoult, who has achieved international fame since his proposed treatment for Covid-19 was touted as a miracle cure by President Trump, believes that his colleagues fail to see that their ideas are the products of mere intellectual fashions  that they are hypnotized by methodology into believing that they understand what they do not and that they lack the discipline of mind that would permit them to comprehend their error. Hubris, Raoult told me recently, at his institute in Marseille, is the most common thing in the world. It is a particularly dangerous malady in doctors like him, whose opinions are freighted with the responsibility of life and death. Someone who doesnt know is less stupid than someone who wrongly thinks he does, he said. Because it is a terrible thing to be wrong.",2020-05-12T09:00:06+0000

us,Whats on TV Wednesday: Ophelia and Solar Opposites,"OPHELIA (2019) 10 p.m. on Showtime. The suggestion that Shakespeare wrote King Lear during plague lockdown has been widely circulated recently (online, at least), and some ambitious souls may be inspired to take advantage of social distancing to try to write the next great play, novel or TV pilot. For the rest of us, catching up on movies will have to suffice. One option, for those who missed it, is this revisionist take on Hamlet. As the title suggests, the movie takes the characters and plot of that Shakespeare play but gives them its own spin: It focuses on Ophelia (Daisy Ridley), the lover of Hamlet (George MacKay), who gets her own story line here as the action of the play takes a back seat. Directed by Claire McCarthy and based on a young adult novel by Lisa Klein, the movie makes for an interesting exercise and, for the most part, a passably diverting one, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. This, Dargis added, is Ophelia as a 21st-century heroine, who after a smudge-faced childhood running wild in her kings castle  and being excluded from studying with the boys  grows into a woman with desires, ambitions and a pronounced rebellious streak.",2020-05-13T05:00:05+0000

Nearly eight years after an investigation by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency found that Lance Armstrong had been using performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career  making him a pariah essentially overnight  the disgraced athlete has resurfaced to reflect on his misdeeds. This two-part documentary by the director Marina Zenovich (Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind), airing as part of ESPNs 30 for 30 series, gives him ample opportunity to do so. (Although if youve already made up your mind on Armstrong, the former superstar cyclist, this movie might not change it.) The film packs plenty of back story, chronicling his early days as a cyclist, his battle with testicular cancer and the demise of his reputation after he admitted to doping in 2013. Zenovich doesnt shy away from tough questions, and by interviewing Armstrongs family, friends, rivals and others, she manages to create an objective portrait of a shunned star.

Decades later, as social media has catapulted academic jargon into everyday vocabulary, the term has become warped to signify a restructuring of society, with minorities at the top. But still this theory  that identity categories are not mutually exclusive, but integrated components of a single, multidimensional experience  remains immensely relevant today.

This will mean firing large numbers of adjunct professors, some of whom will lose their health insurance, in the middle of a pandemic. (Mass firings have already started at other CUNY campuses, 450 to date at John Jay alone; they could happen at Brooklyn any day.) Remaining classes will then swell, which is bad for in-person education, but worse if classes remain online, as anybody who has tried to teach on Zoom can attest. The administration has said the projected savings from terminating adjuncts and ballooning classes at Brooklyn College would be $1.4 million. On the scale of New York States budget, the systems main funding source, thats a rounding error; for our adjuncts and our students, its a disaster. After years of being brutalized by Albany, CUNY has apparently so thoroughly internalized the backward logic of austerity that it responds to crisis by attacking itself.",2020-05-26T09:00:11+0000

Virtual theater productions, of course, are mediated through technology and thus not experienced as they would be from the front mezzanine, and yet theyre not fully polished or always prerecorded, either. Part of the thrill of theater is its immediacy and, along with it, the potential for something to fall to pieces. That aspect remains perfectly intact, and recent performances have been felled by late starts, spotty internet and A/V connections, missed cues and poor lighting.

us,An Artist Who Delights in the Minor Key,"In I Confess, the final essay in Moyra Daveys new collection of prose pieces, Index Cards (2020), she recalls losing, as a child at school, a pencil given to her by her mother. Thinking it was stolen, she began to sob. Her teacher asked her: Pourquoi as-tu tant de peine pour un crayon? (Why so much grief over a pencil?) That question has remained with Davey, the New York-based artist, for 50 years. The anecdote  the triviality of the pencil, the pinprick of a particular line  is emblematic of her art, in which tension comes from small traumas and everyday talismans. Moving between video, photography and prose, Daveys work is bound by idiosyncratic references and quasi-dreamed connections. An acute chronicler of quotidian life, she is both the narrator and protagonist of her work. She paces her apartment hallways in her videos; she photographs the dust under her bed; she reads and writes restlessly, hoping to find what Walter Benjamin called the tiny spark of accident that will set off stray thoughts and images. Index Cards, which she wrote between 2003 to 2019, reads like a serial novel and distills Daveys methodology: Her art is rooted in finding a way to practice and is a record of its own creation.",2020-05-29T19:41:01+0000
