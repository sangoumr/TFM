Voting had been going on through the mail, over the phone and on the Internet for almost three months. And while only a few turned out at the only polling place on the only day when votes could be cast in person, Prudential executives suggested that they were not worried about getting the required minimum of a million votes -- two-thirds of them in favor -- for authorization of the reorganization. Mary Flowers, a spokeswoman for Prudential, said Prudential would not say how many people had voted until an official tally was completed in several days. The approval of New Jersey's banking and insurance commissioner would also be required for the reorganization. If the reorganization takes place, as Prudential executives hope, the policy holders will share $20 billion in accumulated profits.

William Hinman, prominent member of the Buddhist community and longtime business leader in Chicago passed away early on Friday July 27 of natural causes. Mr. Hinman was born in February 1945 in Evanston, Illinois and grew up in Lake Bluff, Illinois. During his years at Lake Forest High School he was an all-state athlete in baseball and football and he quarterbacked a football team that was undefeated during his four year high school career. He graduated second in his class, summa cum laude, National Honor Society and was a National Merit Scholar. At the age of 15, he became a union musician and played bass professionally in a jazz band for his remaining high school years. He graduated from Cornell University in 1968 with a major in Philosophy. He was a member of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. Beginning at the age of 26, he pursued a career as an executive recruiter in Chicago for twenty years with great success. His clients included many Fortune 100 companies. He was an avid sailor and sailed many Chicago-Mac races; he also skied and ran many marathons. In 1992, he created SSC, an Information Technology consulting company that married his recruiting and consulting skills. For seven years he built this company as a vision and reflection of his Buddhist practice planting the seeds of Buddhist principles into the business model of corporate America. In 1998, he sold the company in order to devote full time to his philanthropic endeavors. He was an active Buddhist practitioner and leader for over 10 years. He worked tirelessly to preserve the precious Tibetan Buddhist teachings and texts. He traveled all over the world amassing an extensive collection of religious art, cultural material and literature that he made available to the American Buddhist community. He supported the construction and restoration of major monasteries in the United States, India and Tibet. Throughout his life he inspired people to aim for their highest dreams and to achieve them. His own crowning achievement was to play a major role in the conception and creation of a full Nyingma Buddhist retreat center and university in upstate New York with the help and guidance of his longtime teachers, two Tibetan Masters. The temple was consecrated three days before his death; he was honored for the fulfillment of his dream at this ceremony. His great joy and gusto for life, loving nature, generosity, creative mind and ability to listen to people will be missed by his many friends and family. Those who heard his infectious laugh will never forget it. He was a larger than life character who touched many people deeply and with whom many people identified as their best friend. There will be a celebration of his life in the Grand Ballroom at the Marriott Resort in Lincolnshire, Illinois on Wednesday, August 8 at 6 P.M. There will also be a memorial service at the Buddhist temple in September. For details please contact Barrie Hinman at 847-382-8420.

The company preferred to focus on a pro forma loss for the quarter of $1.6 million, or 2 cents a share. The pro forma figure, which excludes some legal costs and costs related to MP3.com's pending acquisition by Vivendi Universal, is an improvement from the first quarter, when the company lost 3 cents a share, and from the comparable quarter of 2000, when the company lost 8 cents a share. But while earnings improved for the San Diego-based company, revenue in the latest quarter fell to $17.5 million from $21.8 million in the first quarter and $20.2 million a year earlier. MP3.com agreed in May to be acquired by Vivendi for $5 a share, or $372 million. MP3.com shares rose 2 cents, to $4.96. Matt Richtel (NYT)",2001-08-02T05:00:00+0000

Sally was a senior editor when she left Sports Illustrated in 1995, shortly before Emma was born, then an editor at Bishop Books until Cameron arrived in 1998. After that, she devoted her time to her girls and to David, with whom she found enormous joy and fulfillment. She will be remembered for her wit, her artful turn of phrase, her letters, her love of music, language and arts, her honesty, generosity, and for her commitment to family and friends. She was a unique and loving soul, and will be deeply missed. A memorial service will be held at The Orensanz Foundation for the Arts, 172 Norfolk St, NYC on Saturday, August 11, at 1PM. Contributions in her memory may be made to The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, 475 Park Ave So., 21 Fl, NY, NY 10016. Please include Sally's name and that acknowledgement should be made to David Burger, 50 Walker St, Apt 4B, NY, NY 10013.",2001-08-02T05:00:00+0000

The court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ruled in favor of the Internal Revenue Service, which had appealed a trial court's ruling in favor of the company. The court said it agreed with the I.R.S. that Boeing's method of allocating research and development costs violated a requirement for the allocation of total costs. The I.R.S. argued that Boeing improperly allocated those costs to two sales units that qualified for favorable tax treatment, when it should have spread the costs among all sales units. Boeing had paid the required amount to the I.R.S. and requested a refund. It sued in 1996 after the I.R.S. did not grant its request.",2001-08-03T05:00:00+0000

The three women complained last year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that they were subjected to a hostile work environment while working for Tratoros Construction Inc., a general contractor hired by the New York Housing Authority to renovate the Williamsburg Houses in northern Brooklyn. After investigating their claims, the commission filed a sexual discrimination suit on their behalf in United States District Court in Brooklyn. In its formal complaint, the commission said, ''Offensive and unwelcome comments were made regarding women's menstruation and sexual activity.'' The complaint accuses one of the company's male supervisors of telling his male colleagues to leave the women alone ''because they had cramps'' and ordered the women to ''change their Pampers.'' The supervisor also asked the women if they had recently had sex and publicly accused two of them of having an affair, according to the complaint. The three women say they were forced to clean bathrooms and kitchens and wash windows while the men did demolition and paint jobs. Chris Curis, a spokesman for Tratoros, said the company denied all of the allegations and he could not discuss continuing litigation. Alan Feuer (NYT)",2001-08-03T05:00:00+0000

The comments were the first by a bank policy maker since the bank left interest rates unchanged on Thursday. On the same day, the Bank of England unexpectedly trimmed its rate for a fourth time this year, citing slackening world growth. Lowering interest rates now would go ''against the logic of growth in current circumstances,'' said Mr. Trichet, who is also governor of the Bank of France.

By combining their efforts, they hope to present a stronger bid than the other companies.

The project is a centerpiece of China's plan to develop the country's poorer western provinces.

Plastic grapes festoon the walls above cracked gray vinyl booths. The chow is strictly short order. In the center of the restaurant, her tweed coat slipping onto the speckled linoleum, a 40-year-old woman sketches in a notebook. When she looks up, time bends. Phoebe Gloeckner has expectant hazel eyes and brown hair shot through with red highlights. She wears round antique spectacles over a small Band-Aid where her 2-year-old accidentally jammed them into the bridge of her nose. She may be an established medical illustrator and mother of two married to a chemistry professor, but she also, quite startlingly, has the face of her 15-year-old alter ego, Minnie, the subject of Gloeckner's semiautobiographical cartoons. Minnie, who was booted from some of the finest Bay Area private schools. Minnie, who was sexually involved with her mother's boyfriend. Minnie, whose best friend dosed her with Quaaludes then traded Minnie's body for more drugs. In fact, if you set the Way Back machine to a quarter-century ago, you could find the teenage Phoebe sitting in this very spot, scribbling in her diary, bearing witness to her life.

''Not a terrible film by any means,'' said Martin Landau, who played the Roman officer Rufio in the movie, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. It was pretty bad, though, despite its front-rank talent. When it opened in the summer of 1963, the film was as notorious for its extravagant production costs as for the tumultuous affair between Burton and Ms. Taylor that had begun on the set. On screen, the machinations in Roman and Egyptian high places had their moments, but artistically ''Cleopatra'' was swallowed by its gilded pavilions.

Sometimes that assumption works to the advantage of the seller. ''The most money I ever made as a salesman was in August, when people thought they were getting the best deal of the year,'' says Ed Wallace, host of an automotive radio talk show in Dallas. The very best bargains can be found in September and October, when dealers are trying to clear the lots for the next year's models. ''Our managers would tell us not to let anyone walk in late October,'' says Joe Girard, the Guinness world-record holder for most cars sold retail. But for buyers looking for the widest selection and the latest model, August can indeed be a good time to shop -- especially this year, when cash rebates and other incentives are averaging $2,619 a vehicle, according to Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research.

us,Gertrude Stein Meets Veruschka,"Perhaps the greatest tribute to Horst, the photographer who made celebrities out of models and models out of celebrities, is that several of his portraits are as familiar as their subjects. HORST PORTRAITS: 60 Years of Style (Abrams, $55) includes an astonishing photograph of Joan Crawford, depicting her face engulfed by an oversize black hat -- which is, in turn, dwarfed by her imposing personality. Here, too, is an image of a contemplative Gertrude Stein, peering while her large white poodle, Basket, directs the viewers toward her. Horst Paul Albert Bohrmann was born in Germany in 1906; his first name alone would come to signify the elegant style with which he glamorized his famous sitters. Beginning in 1931, Horst's career as a photographer spanned six decades, during which he worked predominantly for Vogue. While fashion magazines initially relied on royalty, society women and movie stars as models, Horst helped establish the use of professionals, from Helen Bennett and Lud to Suzy Parker and Veruschka. In an introductory essay, Terence Pepper, curator of photographs at the National Portrait Gallery in London, writes that Horst's mastery of light and shadow followed his relationship with George Hoyningen-Huene, the chief photographer of Paris Vogue. Horst evolved his own, more baroque technique with elaborate sets that sometimes required days to construct. Robin Muir's extensive notes on the 133 plates include short biographies of their subjects and anecdotes regarding the shoots. For instance, rather than obey Marlene Dietrich's instruction to duplicate the lighting methods of her Svengali-like film director, Josef von Sternberg, Horst said that he ''moved the light down slightly below her face . . . and all the wrinkles disappeared.'' If his skills could improve the looks of a Dietrich, his appreciative glance demonstrated time and again that beauty is, indeed, in the eye of the beholder. David Kaufman",2001-08-05T05:00:00+0000

By the time I finally made the trek, both places had vanished. Life was passing me by like an S.U.V. in the E-ZPass lane. But hope, and hunger, spring eternal, and it wasn't long before the giant violet banner of Jersey Boy Bagels caught my eye. The inside was big, clean and bright, with vast amounts of food behind a long glass counter. I squinted at the overwhelming menu board: eggels (egg on a bagel), omelettes, 15 different types of fresh-baked bagels, muffins, cookies, brownies, crumb cake, salads, soups and knishes. Many of the 25 sandwiches have Jersey-inspired names, from the Trenton Sunrise (chicken salad, bacon, lettuce and tomatoes on wheat) to the Meatless Manasquan (grilled vegetables, roasted peppers and melted mozzarella on a hero). I decided to go south of the border, past Delaware even, and ordered the Tex-Mex, featuring grilled chicken, melted cheddar and salsa on a kaiser roll. All sandwiches are $3.50 to $4.95. Fear not, this Jersey boy also ate a bagel. It was crisp outside, chewy inside, and still hot. For catering, one choice is Jumbo Party Bagels ($49.95, serving up to 18), also with Jersey names.

us,Enlightenment's Greatest Hits,"When the first sentence in a book about Zen refers to Gene Kelly, you know you're not in for one hand clapping. Rather, it's both hands clapping for joy in ''The Zen Commandments'' (Jeremy P. Tarcher, paperback, $14.95), by Dean Sluyter, an English teacher in the Pingry School's Martinsville campus. The commandments are in fact ''suggestions,'' the author says, to help develop ''a life of inner freedom.'' A ''Singin' in the Rain'' attitude -- joyfully jumping in puddles -- is what seekers should (though should isn't a useful attitude) be after. The book includes quotations from Zen masters and other sages, but there are also Willie Nelson, Miles Davis and Bob Dylan and . . . Homer Simpson. Mr. Sluyter, who lives in Plainfield, teaches a popular Pingry course called ''Literature of Enlightenment.'' Mr. Sluyter, who also gives talks on meditation, is hoping to teach it in the state's prisons.",2001-08-05T05:00:00+0000

Worried about a sharp falloff in business, Mr. Claflin moved to cut thousands of jobs. He was among the first prominent technology executive to say publicly that things were looking bad. But what really gnawed at Mr. Claflin, he said, was that his wife preferred to believe the less gloomy outlook offered at the time by John Chambers, the chief executive of 3Com's rival, Cisco Systems.

For a two-year period ending in June, violators paid fines totalling $6 million while another nearly $20 million is owed and considered collectable. That is far short of the $101 million officials originally had predicted would be collected in 2001. Revised budget estimates show the system falling $65 million in debt by 2008 rather than having a surplus at that time. Any shortfall will be paid by the road authorities that operate the Garden State Parkway, New Jersey Turnpike and Atlantic City Expressway. Edward Gross, director of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority which oversees the system, said the 2 percent of drivers violating tolls is what was expected and revenues will increase as the system for collecting fines becomes fully operational.

Unlike the thousands of abandoned cemeteries across the state, Woodland gained attention when it was suspected an unknown number of graves of children, who died during the flu epidemics in the early part of the 20th century, had been covered over by more recent graves of adults who died in the 1960s and 1970s. Partly in response to the rumor of lost children's graves and partly because of complaints from neighbors about the deteriorating condition of the cemetery, the state Cemetery Board ordered the graveyard cleaned up and is in the midst of researching exactly who is buried in the plots.

Revenue in 2001 will be $420 million to $440 million, down from the $530 million to $540 million forecast, the chief executive, Eugene Lockhart, said. The company expects to have a million customers by the end of the year, less than the 1.2 million projected. The revenue projection was lowered partly because of delays in Texas's plan to open its electricity market to competition. Milder-than-expected weather and a higher power-grid fee in the market that includes Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland also hurt business, Mr. Lockhart said on a conference call with analysts and investors.

It is also excellent for pie crust because of its flavor and low moisture content. Next week, Citarella stores will have it, in an almost-9-ounce package for $4.29.

An appeals court stayed the order, but Napster has remained offline. Sources close to the case said record labels' request for a summary judgment was essentially a procedural maneuver that was not a surprise. Judge Patel has not set dates for argument on the summary request or for the trial. Napster officials had no comment on the summary judgment request. But in their own papers, filed on Tuesday, they asked the appeals court to force Judge Patel to modify an injunction she issued in March that ordered Napster to prevent the exchange of copyright files.

us,A Facelift Recalls A Fin de Sicle Era,"It was time to spruce up Jo Jo, above right, a French restaurant on East 64th Street, and the owner, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, handed the $1 million job of taking it back to a new future to Christophe Tollemer, 35, a designer from Provence all but unknown in the United States. Mr. Vongerichten, 44, had hired Mr. Tollemer to fix up a farmhouse in Mougins, France, where he has family. He wanted Jo Jo (his first restaurant, opened in 1991) to have ''a homey, neighborhood feel'' inspired by Parisian botes in the era of Zola and Proust. Mr. Tollemer, who likes neither minimalism nor computer renderings, made watercolor drawings of the two upstairs dining rooms (right, the front; above, the back) and a dining room downstairs. The look is reminiscent of Victorian club cars. Silk and velour furnishings have been ordered in contemporary shades of plum, lavender and green. The walls will be finished using an ancient tinted-plaster technique, and the terra-cotta floors will be courtesy of a 300-year-old teardown in southern France. ''I wanted something that would last,'' said Mr. Vongerichten, whose restaurant holdings have spread from Manhattan to Chicago, London, Hong Kong and the Bahamas. Customers may need to pack reading glasses for Jo Jo, which will seat 90: much of the lighting will come from reproduction 19th-century candle sconces.

Concluding a career with Schering as Vice President, Corporate Scientific Liaison, Dr. Papa secured licensing agreements with several foreign companies such as Glaxo. He was also responsible for securing the patent for the antibiotic Garamicyn. Prior to this, as Co-Director of Scientific Research for Schering, Dr. Papa was instrumental in the development of the Trimeton family of drugs, some of which are still key products for the company today. In 1958, Dr. Papa received an award from the nation of Chile, recognizing his accomplishments in the development of an x-ray contrast agent, Priodax. However, what Dr. Papa considered his ''greatest triumph'' was the awarding of patents to Schering for Prednisone and Prednisolone following a long battle with several larger competing companies. Over the course of his career, Dr. Papa authored or coauthored over 60 papers in organic and medicinal chemistry. Also, Dr. Papa was named as inventor or co-inventor on 40 U.S. patents and several hundred corresponding foreign patents. Concurrent with his career as a chemist, Dr. Papa enjoyed extensive travel to Europe, South America and Asia. He developed an affinity for gourmet cooking and was as fond of his ''Skillet'' diploma as he was any of his other professional accomplishments. Following his retirement from Schering in 1976, he pursued a very active and successful enterprise in antique furniture collecting and restoration. Dr. Papa was born in NYC in 1913, graduated from Brooklyn College in 1935 and earned Masters and Doctoral degrees from Columbia University. He lived in NJ until early 1998 when he and his wife relocated to AZ. Dr. Papa is survived by his wife RoseMarie, daughters Fay, Janice and Cynthia, son William, brother Joseph, sister Mary, four grandchildren and one greatgrandson.

us,A Reggie for an Andrew Jackson,"Think of it as an ''Antiques Roadshow'' for baseball card collectors. Alan Rosen of Montvale knows all about what autographed bats, gloves, photographs and especially baseball cards are worth, and he will be at the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center in Little Falls today from 2 to 6 p.m. to appraise visitors' items. Mr. Rosen, who got the nickname Mr. Mint during his Paterson childhood for his obsession with mint-condition baseball cards, has been a full-time dealer since 1982, and says he's bought and sold $115 million worth of baseball collectibles and his clients include Spike Lee, Len Berman and Reggie Jackson. Unlike the mavens on the PBS show, Mr. Rosen will put his money where his expertise is -- he may make offers, and will have $100,000 in cash on hand to make good on them. There is a limit of five items per person. If your mom sold your childhood baseball card collection, you learn what you lost. The museum, on the Montclair State University campus at 8 Quarry Road in Little Falls, will charge standard admission ($4; $2 for students and children; those 5 and younger are admitted free) for the event.

In a craft book, she and a friend learned of a plastic lid that shrinks in an oven. That sounded interesting, but the lids were too small to be much fun. Mrs. Morris found a company willing to send her plastic sheets, if she bought 1,000 pounds. She persuaded them to give her a dozen-sheet sample. The scouts loved coloring and then shrinking the plastic so much that they often fought over the scraps. Mrs. Morris organized a company to market the new toy and ordered the full shipment. When it arrived, her garage floor cracked. ",2001-08-12T05:00:00+0000

us,The Joys of Being Watched,"The characters in Elizabeth Searle's new collection, CELEBRITIES IN DISGRACE (Graywolf, paper, $14), don't jump off the pages so much as cling to them for dear life. An avalanche of sexual tension propels these narratives -- five short stories and one novella -- toward the occasional moment of self-discovery. The title novella, which features a woman who wants to portray the skater Nancy Kerrigan in a television movie, is a miniature masterpiece that holds a dirty mirror up to our often obsessive fascination with the rich and famous. Searle examines the tenuous relationship between one's public and private personas. Many of his characters are most comfortable in front of a camera or some imagined audience, and they gladly accept the personal compromises that accompany fame, or even infamy. The epiphany, if it comes, is awash in things that resemble bodily fluids, like the beige-pink makeup stain smeared on a burial dress that was owned by a spinster aunt in ''What It's Worth.'' Elsewhere a foil-wrapped condom is mistaken for a Hershey's Kiss, and ketchup is used to simulate blood in an amateur film production of Stephen King's ''Carrie.'' The result is a study in voyeurism seen from the perspective of the one being watched. Andrew Ervin",2001-08-12T05:00:00+0000

Best of all, the warm staff keeps the freshly brewed coffee coming, with no need to ask for refills. If a sit-down breakfast is not your thing, head over to the cheese shop (stocked with 500 varieties) for a bagel and a schmear. Choose from a dozen cheese spreads (all made there) like Garden Vegetable, a blend of cream cheese, cheddar, peppers, scallions, and radishes, or Tijuana Hot, a blend of yellow cheddar and jalapeo, which will wake you up as surely as the coffee. For lunch, sandwiches like prosciutto, roasted peppers, and fresh mozzarella ($6.95) share menu space with juicy burgers. And for the bikinied crowd, there's a good selection of salads ($6.99 to $9.95).

Garden State closed its racing operations in May after 59 years and Realen Properties Inc., of Berwyn, Pa., got the rights to develop the property. Realen plans to build one million square feet of office space and 500,000 square feet of retail space on the site. In addition, the company plans four condominium villages, a conference center and a 150-room hotel with a seven-acre lake and 75 acres of open space through the entire complex. Most of the housing is planned to be age-restricted so that few children will live on the site, thus cutting down on the possibility that the development would cause school taxes to rise. The developers said it could take as long as 20 years before the whole complex would be completed. The plan now goes to the Cherry Hill planning board for review.

There are a few exceptions, most notably Brian De Palma's bold and hilarious ''Phantom of the Paradise,'' an underappreciated 1974 classic that borrowed from ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' ''Faust'' and the Brechtian underpinnings of David Bowie's stage persona to tell the tale of a jealous rock composer who haunts a rock palace much like the Fillmore. In 1975, with Tim Curry's corseted, lipsticked Frank 'N' Furter leading the charge, ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' made the case for glam decadence and became a camp touchstone during its initial release -- perhaps the first time such a thing had happened.

The nonironic book, by Mark I. Pinsky, a religion writer for The Orlando Sentinel, is only the latest nod to the show's spirituality. A recent California State University study found that 70 percent of the show's episodes contain religious themes. Christian Century magazine put the family on its cover, stating that ''The Simpsons'' ''is exceptionally aware of the significant place religion has in the American landscape.'' And in the magazine Prism, from Evangelicals for Social Action, ''The Simpsons'' was called ''the most pro-family, God-preoccupied, home-based program on television.'' It appears that the show most memorably lambasted by Bush the elder in 1992 -- We need a nation closer to 'The Waltons' than 'The Simpsons' '' -- and criticized by Catholics and Hindus is now a model of family values.

us,Private Sector; From King of Wall Street To Sultan of Supplements,"Ten years have passed since a Treasury bond trading scandal tainted the house of Salomon Brothers and brought down its tough-willed chairman, John H. Gutfreund. Salomon ultimately did not survive independently -- it is now part of Citigroup, which plans to scrap the Salomon name altogether next year. But Mr. Gutfreund, once known as the ''King of Wall Street'' for his gutsy trading instincts, survived, albeit less regally, as a financial adviser and venture capital investor. Last week, he got a job as the next chairman of a business that is as about as far removed from the Treasury bond trading pits as you can get: Nutrition21, a dietary supplements company that sells ''Lite Bites'' fat-fighting remedies and other food ingredients. Mr. Gutfreund, 70, had served on the board since February 2000. He succeeds Robert E. Flynn, former chief executive of the NutraSweet Company. Nutrition21 said in a statement that Mr. Gutfreund ''brings an enormous wealth of knowledge and expertise,'' citing his years running Salomon but making no mention of the scandal in August 1991. Mr. Gutfreund did not return telephone messages. His office said he was traveling.",2001-08-12T05:00:00+0000

Gabriel Axel made this delectable movie about a French-woman (Stephane Audran) in distress who goes to work as an unpaid house-keeper for two pious spinster sisters in a bleak Danish village. Fourteen years later, the housekeeper wins the French lottery and decides to blow the whole 10,000 francs on a dinner to end all dinners. Little do her employers know she was a renowned chef back in Paris. No other film has come this close to conveying on screen the bliss of blinis De-midoff with caviar and an 1845 Clos Vougeot.

Mr. O'Neal, 49, joined the G.M. board last Tuesday, just two weeks after he was named president and chief operating officer of Merrill Lynch. But his relationship with G.M. spans three decades. In 1969, he attended the cooperative education program at the General Motors Institute, working part-time at the same G.M. plant in Doraville, Ga., where his father had worked. Mr. O'Neal said his most vivid memory was the body shop: ''They had these huge pneumatic bolters, sparks flying everywhere.'' He later worked as an assembly-line supervisor, won a scholarship from G.M. to attend business school at Harvard, received his M.B.A. in 1978 and returned to G.M. as a financial executive. Eight years later he joined Merrill Lynch. Until last week, he had resisted G.M.'s entreaties to join its board. ''From a personal point of view, it is coming back full circle,'' he said.

And Viacom had been talking to Equitable about swapping its stake in the CBS Building, 51 West 52nd Street, for 1515 Broadway.

He told the investors that their money would be used to buy and repair the homes, which would then be sold at a large profit, Mr. Spitzer said.

And Adam, who this season became the general music director of the opera house in Mannheim, Germany, was prevented from conducting the ensemble he founded, the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra, in its Mostly Mozart appearances this week because he was summoned to Bayreuth to replace the late Giuseppe Sinopoli as conductor of the ''Ring'' cycle -- a supreme example of an offer you can't refuse.",2001-08-15T05:00:00+0000

us,"Big Enough for 3 Chickens, 30 Burgers or a Fat Bass","After a long quest for the perfect grill, I found happiness on the Web. I had a list of requirements drawn from past frustrations. Charcoal kettles were not convenient, but gas grills never got hot enough. Although the flames could be adjusted, the racks could not. I did not want to return to the kettle-style charcoal grill, because the distance between the coals and the food was fixed, it was hard to add more coals during cooking and I didn't like having to cover the grill to adjust the heat. But a fancy $3,000 outdoor kitchen was not for me. I ordered a Bar-B-Chef Texas Charcoal Grill from www.bbqgalore.com, the site of the country's largest grill and grilling accessories company, based in Los Angeles. Mine is big, with 589 square inches of surface, generous enough for 3 chickens or 30 hamburgers or a whole 9-pound striped bass. Yet the cast-iron grates have closely spaced openings, so small that shrimp do not fall through. There's a trapdoor in front to allow fuel to be added during cooking, and, best of all, a crank to move the coals up or down, with about eight inches of play. The unit comes on a cart or with directions for building it into a brick housing. It has two side shelves and a lid. A waterproof cover, warming rack and rotisserie are optional accessories. Without those, in black it's $589 plus shipping; in stainless steel it's $959 plus shipping. You have to assemble it, which took two people a little less than three hours. The company is very accommodating, replacing almost overnight one defective part that came in the kit.

She was 90 years old. A native of New York City she taught acting and speech skills to a wide range of public figures from the late director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William J. Casey, and the late New York City Mayor, John Lindsay, to actors, Jack Palance and Tony Curtis. She was born in New York and began her professional acting career at age 4. Betty graduated with honors from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and began her coaching career in New York City. During the 1950's, Ms. Cashman received four consecutive ''Show Business Oscars'' for ''Greatest Development of New Talent in the Theatre.'' Over the years, her list of clients included Dr. Joyce Brothers, Nancy Sinatra, Zsa Zsa and Eva Gabor, Gene Shalit, and Eileen Ford. Co-Founder of Ford Models, Eileen Ford said that ''Betty Cashman was very much a part of my life and that of Ford Models in the early days of television commercials. She gave us lessons that not only improved our speech, but gave us all the confidence we all needed. Betty Cashman was the best there was. We all owed her a lot.'' In an interview with Charlie Rose on Rose's PBS program, Academy Award-winning actor, Jack Palance, singled Ms. Cashman out for praise as ''a fantastic coach.'' Bernadette Casey-Smith, daughter of the late CIA Director, William J. Casey, said her father called Betty Cashman ''a national treasure.'' Betty's technique attracted her to show producers who hired her as an ''Actor's Doctor,'' working with performers on a dramatic role. She was the author of several books on acting, one of which, ''Betty Cashman and You in Personality, Acting and Public Speaking,'' earned the coveted International Mark Twain Award. Betty is also listed in the ''Who's Who of American Women'' and ''Who's Who of the American Theatre.'' A celebration of Betty Cashman's life will be held at a later date.

I'd just take photographs of everything. (I started taking the digital camera with me wherever I went. That got to be impinging too much on my daily life.) I wanted to take the stance of a 19th-century scientist, creating a taxonomy of species. I was looking for the essence of the species McDonald's. Because these corporations do have, I'm sure, this bible of what the ideal McDonald's looks like. Or maybe not the ideal, but the code for it. And I've been trying to arrive at that code from the opposite direction. So it kind of has that mock-scientific quality.",2001-08-19T05:00:00+0000

When I finally met Lillian Kiesler toward the end of her life, I assured her that I would naturally record Kiesler's wishes but probably not honor them. Not all of his work was Surrealist, but the term does not, in my view, misrepresent the projects that hold the greatest interest for architects today. She was agreeable about it.

us,Poetry in Brief; The Lone Deranger Rides Again,"Not many books of poems put you in mind of Robert Penn Warren, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the brainiac whimsy of McSweeney's quarterly at the same time. In his first book, LAWRENCE BOOTH'S BOOK OF VISIONS (Yale University, cloth, $19; paper, $12), Maurice Manning displays not just terrific cunning but terrific aim -- he nails his images the way a restless boy, up in a tree with a slingshot, nails anything sentient that wanders into view. Manning's book, which won this year's Yale Series of Younger Poets competition, is set in the rural South -- probably Kentucky, where the author was born -- and it's a cycle of hallucinatory, vinegary and often plaintive poems about the coming of age of a troubled boy. These are poems in which offhandedly shrewd images (''The night-time smells / like creosote and shirtless boys, mixed with june bugs and grease'') mingle with confusing and disturbing ones: in one poem, Lawrence's violent father -- who is referred to, variously, as ''Ole Dreadful Daddy,'' ''Ninety-Proof Daddy'' and ''Real Mad Daddy'' -- appears on a horse, drenched in kerosene, and bellows ''I love you like / a furnace, son! Heigh-Ho Silver, away!'' before lighting a match. That's a nightmarish snapshot -- one of many -- but Manning's book doesn't sink into a Big Muddy of gothic imagery. The poems here are frequently poured into playful forms: progress reports from teachers, court complaints, lists of nicknames, even a page of personal ads: ''Eccentric (?) gentleman (negotiable)- / tinker/farmer searching the heavens / for the true spark of love (breast-size unimportant). Please.'' File under: books that shouldn't work, but do. Dwight Garner",2001-08-19T05:00:00+0000

They can indeed be ''crabby,'' which Webster's defines as cross or ill-tempered, and ''crabbed'' (morose and peevish), and they are very adept at ''crabbing'' (making sour) what were, just moments earlier, the best of times. They are moody and sensitive and vulnerable, and you want to kill them, but they are saved by the fact that they also share the crab's more irresistible nature.

Bedbugs -- flat, reddish brown, wingless creatures -- are enjoying a feeding frenzy these days. Surviving on human blood, they attack only at night and leave red streaks on a victim's sheets as their calling card. Orkin, the Atlanta-based pest control company, estimates a 20 percent nationwide increase in bedbug calls in the last two years. Florida's hotels in particular have placed 10 times as many bedbug-related calls to fumigators since 1999, according to a University of Florida study released last month. Increased international tourism is to blame, suggests Phil Koehler, the urban entomologist that led the research team. And no hotels -- from hip boutique upstarts to rundown economy chains -- are safe. Tourists unwittingly carry them in their luggage, says Koehler, so every hotel is a potential target. ''Bedbugs are just as happy eating in a five-star resort as a youth hostel.''",2001-08-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Still Haywire,"Brooke Hayward is Hollywood royalty. Her mother was Margaret Sullavan, the revered stage actress and star of the Hollywood golden age who was married to Henry Fonda and William Wyler before she married her agent, Leland Hayward. Leland, Brooke's father, was an ber agent whose client list included the likes of Katharine Hepburn, Greta Garbo, Judy Garland, Jimmy Stewart and Fred Astaire. Leland later produced Broadway hits like ''South Pacific'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' After their divorce, he married Slim Keith, who was previously married to Howard Hawks and inspired Lauren Bacall's character in ''To Have and Have Not.'' After Slim, Leland married Pamela Digby Churchill, Winston Churchill's daughter-in-law and later the mistress of Gianni Agnelli, the Prince Aly Khan and Baron Elie de Rothschild. After Leland died, Churchill married the powerful and ultrarich Averell Harriman, became the United States ambassador to France and died after swimming laps in the pool of the Ritz Hotel in Paris. While Brooke was growing up, her best friends were Jane and Peter Fonda, who later made ''Easy Rider'' with Brooke's brother Bill Hayward and her husband, Dennis Hopper -- the actor, director and American icon. Brooke and Dennis had a daughter, Marin. In 1977, Brooke wrote ''Haywire,'' a best-seller about her extraordinary family. She is now married to Eddie Duchin's son Peter, who was raised by Averell Harriman, who was later married to Brooke's stepmother, Pamela. Confused? Imagine what it's like for Marin.

Courrges has been on the tip of every fashionista's tongue, so it's no surprise that Anna wanted to have ''coffee.'' When Anna and Hamish arrived, Madame Courrges introduced herself, served them their ''coffee'' and walked out -- never to be seen again.

Just as pleasing was the texture -- evenly frozen, with no spiky crystals and enough liquid to keep it smooth. The Ice Hut makes 14 flavors, six of which are sold daily. Lemon is the only constant, while watermelon, orange, cherry, chocolate and others rotate in weekly. Up to three flavors can be requested together in a seven-ounce medium ($1.75) or four flavors in a nine-ounce large ($2) at no extra charge. The Ice Hut also sells a parfait-like Combo Cooler ($2.50 medium; $3 large), with your choice of ice layered between chocolate or vanilla soft-serve ice cream.

Naloxone, a narcotic antagonist, could be incorporated into the OxyContin tablets. Narcotic antagonists reverse the effects of opiates but are effective only intravenously. The oral effect of OxyContin would not be changed. But when injected, Naloxone would prevent an opiate high and would precipitate opiate withdrawal in a regular opiate user.

Furthermore, to dismiss Edward by pointing out that he has many more bad readings than good ones misses the point: just one scientifically unexplainable event is a phenomenon worthy of serious consideration. Unless there is enormous, professionally orchestrated fraud involved, which I doubt (nor do I believe has ever been alleged), there is simply no way to explain the best of Edward's results.

The institution had taken repeated critical batterings during the Communist era, when it was forced to play poor relation to the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. Ever since Mr. Gergiev's ascension, the Kirov has been seen to carry the cultural banner for Russia. But during a brief residency at the Royal Opera House here last month, it severely tarnished its reputation with the public and critics alike, and the sometimes hostile reception must have shocked a company more accustomed to accolades.",2001-08-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Downhill to Here,"Trash, bare trees and granite skies; ragtag children and worn-out adults. The setting is Dorchester, Mass., its deteriorating buildings fronting on splotched and cracked sidewalks. In the mid-1970's, a young photographer, Eugene Richards, returned home to this working-class Boston neighborhood to photograph the life around him -- on the street, in bars, in empty lots, and, when he could wangle it, inside homes. The population had changed since he was a child, with a new wave of immigrants, so though Richards was not technically an outsider, neither was he an insider. He photographed in black and white, using a bare-bones, no-nonsense style, and he set about creating a body of work that would bear witness to the time and place. This included racial conflict, the passing of the older generation, social alienation and urban decline. In 1978, he self-published a book from his Dorchester photos. It marked the beginning of his distinguished career as a documentarian of the poor and alienated. Now DORCHESTER DAYS (Phaidon, $39.95) has been republished, recovered and refurbished. The new edition benefits from additional images as well as greatly improved design and printing. Artful touches, like text written in the photographer's hand, have also been added. The result is a book that is much more accessible to contemporary readers, but with the original photographs' rawness and intensity left intact. Rosemary Ranck",2001-08-19T05:00:00+0000

Instead she now visits toxic-waste sites. ''At least today is a clean day,'' Whitman notes. Often when she travels to inspect something, it's garbage or ooze or worse. ",2001-08-20T05:00:00+0000

Kayakers use New York's original mass transit system, riding currents that change direction about every six hours.

A chip's so-called clock speed, or frequency, is only one factor in its overall performance, but one that Intel has flaunted as a marketing advantage over its rival Advanced Micro Devices, which is preparing to release its fastest chip, the 1.5-gigahertz Athlon. ''Intel is playing the frequency hand,'' said Kevin Krewell, a senior analyst with The Microprocessor Report, a trade publication. ''They keep cranking them up.''

But, the lawsuit asserted, this method of storing and retrieving made it possible for the songs to be given to people who might not own them.

Legal matters will prevent the company from beating estimates, Bruce Nelson, the chief executive, said on a conference call, without elaborating. The company is expected to earn 20 cents a share in the quarter ending Sept. 29, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Mr. Nelson has been closing stores, revamping displays and trying to improve customer service since he was appointed in July 2000. He said that sales at stores open at least a year had shown ''meaningful improvement'' this quarter and that gross margin, or the percentage of sales that remains after product costs are subtracted, was improving.

us,The Rural Life; August Corn,"A few days ago, at the edge of a desolate mall in the Mohawk Valley, I saw a young Amish woman sitting on the back end of a horseless carriage -- horseless, because the horse was elsewhere. She was selling sweet corn. Everyone is selling sweet corn right now and selling it with an almost touching earnestness, knowing that this is the season of sweet-corn glut. I've come across a few ears and a coffee can lying on a board beside a garden. I've seen children's wagons mounded with dark ears parked on the sidewalk. At some of the bigger roadside stands, it looks as if the proprietors are really selling brown paper bags and using the corn to hold them up. The bags absorb the moisture the corn gives off and collapse while being carried into the house. Everyone says the best way to prepare sweet corn is to remove it from the stalk, husk it on the way to the kitchen and drop it into already boiling water. I get good results if I drive it home, drop it on the lawn when the bag breaks and then prepare it as usual.",2001-08-25T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Brodeur, a Green Party candidate, poked fun at the other candidates and offered suggestions that seemed to come from a college dorm room. Among his ideas: to sell Gracie Mansion and to use undercover agents, posing as criminals, to catch abusive officers. Mr. Brodeur got laughs from the audience and even managed to rankle two of his opponents, who showed flashes of humor themselves. When Mr. Brodeur chided the candidates for posing in photographs that show them reading to children, Alan G. Hevesi, a Democratic candidate, shot back with a smirk, ''I will continue as mayor to read to children.'' And when Mr. Brodeur, who is white, labeled the candidates ''all wealthy white men who don't care about the little people,'' Fernando Ferrer, a Bronx native of Puerto Rican descent, rose, saying, ''I want to thank my friend from the Green Party for the ephiphany-like revelation that I am a wealthy white man.''

In initially turning the project down, without reading it, I wondered when would it end, this ruining of classic texts by teening them down? There had been the successes, beginning in 1995 with ''Clueless,'' based on Jane Austen's novel ''Emma,'' but many subsequent adaptations of literature typified the film industry's appetite for soullessly copying previous hits. When I finally did agree at least to read ''O,'' I found Brad Kaaya's script as provocative as it was challenging, setting myself (and many others who would work on the film) on the strange journey of making ''O'' and then navigating it toward release.",2001-08-26T05:00:00+0000

Though the level of perchloroethylene in the air at the former Munsey Cleaners site was under the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation limit of 100 parts per million as of the last sample taken in May, the adjacent store, which shares a basement, was found to have levels exceeding these standards. Even with the Sbarro site in compliance with these state standards this brings new concerns to light. Because an active source of perc is still in place at the site, this may result in the perc going above the acceptable safety limits. Just because a narrow reading of the law may permit commercial use of the site once a final remediation plan is in place, it doesn't mean that approval of a restaurant to open for business makes any sense.

He found his man in Gen. Richard B. Meyers, a soft-spoken fighter pilot during the Vietnam War, former commander of United States Forces in Japan, former head of the Space Command -- and current vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

us,The Pro-Choice Extremist,"Before she had a ship, before she had any money for a ship or a nurse to go with the ship or a media representative to handle all the reporters who would want to know what she was doing with the ship, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts had an idea. It was 1997, and she was a 31-year-old abortion doctor based in Amsterdam, and to her, the idea seemed straightforward and reasonable, as so many ideas do before they take on the weight of reality. She wanted to buy a ship and sail it around the world, providing abortions at sea for women who could not otherwise get them. Gomperts, whose activist roots stem from a stint as the resident doctor on Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior II boat, planned to visit countries where the procedure is either illegal or highly restricted and transport women seeking abortions into international waters, 12 miles offshore. There, a Dutch-registered ship would be subject to Dutch law, and she could legally perform abortions -- something she intended to do free. ''In my trips with Greenpeace, I became aware of the enormous and invisible suffering of women due to illegal abortions,'' Gomperts says.

The reconciliation of North and South required a national repudiation of Reconstruction as ''a disastrous mistake''; a wide-ranging white acceptance of ''Negro inferiority'' and of white supremacy in the South; and a distorted view of slavery as an unfortunate but benign institution that was damaging for whites morally but helped civilize and Christianize ''African savages.''",2001-08-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Slackers in Ireland,"Julian Gough has written a first novel that's full of sardonic yet good-humored riffs. As JUNO & JULIET (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $23.95) begins, two sisters from Tipperary, Juno and Juliet Taylor, are trying to cope with their first day at the University of Galway. The young women are identical twins, 18 and beautiful to a fault -- if we are to believe Juliet, the narrator, who sometimes uses descriptions of her sister as a sly way of commenting on herself. (We're told, for example, that Juno's beauty ''refines and upgrades itself constantly.'') Their student life is amply complemented by liquor, drugs and sex; they are also studying English, apparently in moderation. Juno gets her romantic life in order with dispatch. Juliet takes longer, perhaps because for a while she doesn't realize she's in love with her tutor, a young lecturer named David Hennessey. David is ferociously critical of literary theory, but in ridiculing fashionable academics he somehow manages to sound even more pedantic than they are. There is one dark area in this ostensibly carefree narrative: someone is writing obscene and threatening letters to women on campus, including Juno and, later, Juliet. But this malefactor's tragic end, when it finally comes, seems utterly out of place, even to the other characters. As a narrator, Juliet is consistently, agreeably flippant, and from time to time comes across with a truly memorable line. (''Ah, the old make us philosophical. No wonder we avoid them.'') ''Juno & Juliet,'' with all its adolescent ironies, still manages to be intelligent, lighthearted and thoroughly entertaining. William Ferguson",2001-08-26T05:00:00+0000

Born in Moscow in 1918, she lived in Berlin and Paris before immigrating to New York in 1938. Following her father's deportation to Auschwitz, she was the driving force in bringing her mother and sister to the United States in 1947. She loved all things beautiful: nature, art, theater, music and dance. Once a professional dancer, she received an MFA from Queens College. She translated the fluid beauty of the body into insights about character, creating a vision called Imageology. Knowing how important self-image can be, especially for those struggling with cancer, she pushed tirelessly for increased use of creative and alternative therapies, especially dance, music and art therapies, to enhance the quality of patients' lives, even as she herself was battling debilitating illness. She was well ahead of her time in recognizing the value of these creative therapies in helping patients. Surviving her are her beloved sister Vera Stern, her six nephews and nieces by birth and marriage, her five great-nephews and great-nieces, and her many friends and students. Both she and her family are grateful to Patricia and Precilla, and all the doctors, nurses and staff on the 12th floor of Memorial Hospital.

With Yemen's network of militant Islamic groups declared off-limits by Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the bureau's chances slipped further away of proving its ''working theory'' -- that the Cole attack was the latest directed by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian millionaire who has become an icon among Islamic militants for his ''holy war'' against the United States.

One evening, in a fervor to impress a group of parents whose children would be the next crop of freshmen, a vice principal swept through the corridors removing every handmade poster from the walls -- every indication that there was extra-curricular life in the place -- as if it were trash. The next morning I watched this man face a delegation of students who wanted to know why their posters had been ripped down, and what I remember most vividly is his unwavering tone of certainty, his absolute conviction that he had behaved reasonably and in everyone's best interests.",2001-08-26T05:00:00+0000

It is a Freehold orchard, coincidentally, in which he used to pick strawberries and other fruit when he was 12 years old. The ice cream -- peach and 14 other flavors, including chocolate cake, chocolate nut surprise and rum raisin -- gets top billing on his menus, particularly during the summer. A double scoop is $1.95; three scoops, $2.45. Soft ice cream is a bit less. ''People pass three or four other ice cream places to come here,'' he said, coming to sample hard and soft ice cream and yogurt, plus 12 flavors of Italian ices (which Mr. Folts also wholesales to other places) and sherbet. ''It's all about weekends,'' he explained of the crux of his business. Mr. Folts has owned the 40-year-old unofficial landmark for seven years. It seats 55 at a time, with 12 tables, plus six stools at the counter facing the ''Jack Frost BBQ Pit'' preparing ribs, chicken and hot dogs. Breakfast and hot and cold lunch items also are available in the $3 to $7 range. Mr. Folts and his partner, Vinnie Lanza Jr. -- from whose father Folts bought the business -- have a staff of about 30, mostly teenagers. For the 36-year-old Folts, Jack Frost is more than a business. ''It's my passion.'' he said. Norm Oshrin",2001-08-26T05:00:00+0000

In May, Portugal Telecom said it would issue 253 million shares to swap for the 58.8 percent it does not own in Telesp Celular, Brazil's largest cellular company. But the company said a 10 percent drop in its shares would allow them to back out of the deal. Although the stock broke that level in early trading, the shares recovered to 7.10 escudos, slightly above the 7.02 cut-off by the close.

In her almost 70-year close association with the Museum, she gave generously of her time and resources, following in the tradition of her aunt, Lillie P. Bliss, one of the three founders of the Museum in 1929. From her first formal involvement with the Museum, at the invitation of Nelson Rockefeller, as Chairman of the Junior Advisory Committee, to her election as a Trustee in 1939, and her subsequent involvement in the founding of the Museum's International Council on which she served as President from 1957 to 1966, Eliza remained active in the Council for many years thereafter, & was deeply linked to every facet of the Museum's activities. She served as a member of virtually every Museum Trustee committee, participating in curatorial, administrative, financial, educational, and archival areas, chairing the Photography Committee from 1983 to 1987 and the Building Committee from 1968 to 1977, among others. Her deep and abiding intererest in the Museum's staff was well known, and she encouraged its growth with the same vigor and spirit she showed in support of young artists. Eliza was President of the Museum from 1965 to 1968, and remained an active Vice Chairman until 1993 when she became a Life Trustee. We extend our deepest sympathy and affection to her devoted family: her daughter Zaidee Parkinson; her son John Parkinson III and her daughter-in-law Charlotte; her step-children Alex & Sheila Ewing, Ian and Victoria Mackintosh, and John and Bayard Cobb; 5 grandchildren, John Parkinson, Allston Parkinson, Elizabeth ParkinsonWyner, Basil Dufallo and Cornelius Dufallo; and three great-grandchildren.

Bliss, one of the three founders of the Museum in 1929. From her first formal involvement with the Museum, at the invitation of Nelson Rockefeller, as Chairman of the Junior Advisory Committee, to her election as a Trustee in 1939, and her subsequent involvement in the founding of the Museum's International Council on which she served as President from 1957 to 1966, Eliza remained active in the Council for many years thereafter, & was deeply linked to every facet of the Museum's activities. She served as a member of virtually every Museum Trustee committee, participating in curatorial, administrative, financial, educational, and archival areas, chairing the Photography Committee from 1983 to 1987 and the Building Committee from 1968 to 1977, among others. Her deep and abiding intererest in the Museum's staff was well known, and she encouraged its growth with the same vigor and spirit she showed in support of young artists. Eliza was President of the Museum from 1965 to 1968, and remained an active Vice Chairman until 1993 when she became a Life Trustee. We extend our deepest sympathy and affection to her devoted family: her daughter Zaidee Parkinson; her son John Parkinson III and her daughter-in-law Charlotte; her step-children Alex & Sheila Ewing, Ian and Victoria Mackintosh, and John and Bayard Cobb; 5 grandchildren, John Parkinson, Allston Parkinson, Elizabeth ParkinsonWyner, Basil Dufallo and Cornelius Dufallo; and three great-grandchildren.
