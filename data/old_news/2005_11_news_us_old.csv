us,"The Arts, Briefly; 'Anatomy' Is Destiny","Even without a new episode of ""Desperate Housewives"" on its schedule, ABC beat all the other networks on Sunday. Its ""Grey's Anatomy,"" during which Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) found out that Dr. Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey, below) was ditching her to go back to his wife, was the night's most popular show, with an estimated 17.09 million viewers. That was the comedic hospital soap opera's smallest audience of the season, but since its lead-in, ""Housewives"" (14.79 million), was a rerun, its ratings represented the ability of ""Grey's"" to stand alone. ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" (16.8 million) also contributed to ABC's victory. It drew the second highest 18-to-49 rating for the night (""Grey's"" topped that category). Without a new ""Housewives"" to contend with at 9 p.m., a repeat of ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" (13.8 million) brought in that show's best ratings in more than seven months and helped NBC place second among total viewers over all. Fox was No. 2 in the 18-to-49 demographic, helped by a football spillover into prime time. For computer-bound fans of television news, NBC plans to broadcast its ""Nightly News"" online at MSNBC.com beginning at 10 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday. KATE AURTHUR",2005-11-01T05:00:00+0000

That is partly because airlines, including those in bankruptcy protection, have cut domestic schedules and capacity, said Prashanth Kuchibhotla, the senior manager for air procurement for eClipse Advisers, an American Express subsidiary.

The journal credited the proposal to Dr. Joe Howton, medical director at the Adventist Medical Center in Portland, Ore., who said he got the idea recently after reading a 2002 study on drug interactions by Tamiflu's manufacturer, Roche.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   PIFER, ALAN","PIFER--Alan. We deeply mourn the loss of Alan Pifer, past president of Carnegie Corporation of New York, who passed away on October 31 at the age of 84. Throughout Pifer's career, his focus was on social justice and the rights of disadvantaged groups, including women. In particular, beginning in the 1970s, Pifer was instrumental in reinstituting Carnegie Corporation's involvement in South Africa after a long hiatus and led the foundation in supporting the formation of public interest law projects in South Africa that challenged apartheid policies. These organizations continue to have a lasting impact on South African society. Pifer formally assumed the Corporation presidency in 1967, succeeding John W. Gardner who left to become HEW Secretary. Under Pifer's leadership, the Corporation renewed its commitment to early childhood education, supporting research and applications of experimental and demonstration programs that later provided evidence of the positive long-term effects of high-quality early education, particularly for disadvantaged students. Carnegie Corporation also promoted educational children's television, which launched Sesame Street. Other landmarks achieved under Pifer's leadership include recommendations from the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television, which were adopted in the Public Broadcasting Act of 1968. After retiring from Carnegie Corporation in 1982, Pifer continued his public service by remaining focused on social inequality, heading the Aging Society Project that studied the social consequences that might develop as America's aging population reached retirement age. Pifer also established the University of Cape Town Fund, which raised funds in the United States to support black students at the South African university and promote activities to aid the advancement and welfare of blacks. Many other organizations and governmental agencies also benefited from his guidance and his wisdom. Pifer was a leader in philanthropy and the nonprofit world, and his legacy will always be insitutional transparency, accountability and the highest ethical standards.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   BAKER, WILLIAM O.","BAKER--William O. The Board of Trustees, faculty, students, and staff of The Rockefeller University deeply mourn the passing of our cherished friend, Dr. William O. Baker. A man of remarkable abilities and compassionate humanism, Bill Baker was a vital force in shaping The Rockefeller University over the course of four decades, as Trustee and then Board Chairman, and finally as Chairman Emeritus. It was our great privilege to award him an honorary degree in 1990 and the David Rockefeller Award for Extraordinary Service to the University in 1997. His memory lives on in the numerous outstanding scientists he recruited to the University (including two Nobel laureates), the research building and two residential towers constructed on his watch, and the William O. Baker Graduate Fellowships, established in his honor by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Bill Baker possessed one of the most broad-gauged, deep, and penetrating minds of the 20th Century. Equally remarkable was his eloquent and extraordinarily beautiful use of the English language in writing and in speech. As head of Bell Labs, he was responsible for directing programs that led to such technological wonders as the laser, digital computing, cellular telephones, and superconducting magnets. What Bell Labs achieved under his leadership, during an extraordinary period of technological growth and development, created an entirely new paradigm for the enlightened corporation. Bill Baker once wrote that ""humanism and science coexist, occasionally connect, but rarely conjoin."" In him, they did indeed conjoin. His humanism and compassion, as well as his kind and gracious way of treating others, has had a lasting impact on so many lives and is part of the cultural fabric we cherish at The Rockefeller University. He and his beloved Frances, who predeceased him, embodied all that is best in human nature and the human spirit. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to their son, Joseph, and everyone whose life he touched. Paul Nurse, President Joshua Lederberg and Torsten Wiesel, Presidents Emeritus Thomas Sakmar, Former Acting President Russell Carson, Chairman Richard Furlaud, Chairman Emeritus David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman The Rockefeller University",2005-11-02T05:00:00+0000

us,That May 6 Column,"The indictment of Scooter Libby has called attention to my May 6, 2003, column, in which I wrote about the Niger uranium events. Some bloggers on the right have been fuming about the column  and since Im big on Cheney opening windows and being transparent, heres my effort to do the same. (By the way, Ive tinkered with this entry and added material since I first put this up.)First, heres the relevant chunk of that column:Im told by a person involved in the Niger caper that more than a year ago the vice presidents office asked for an investigation of the uranium deal, so a former U.S. ambassador to Africa was dispatched to Niger. In February 2002, according to someone present at the meetings, that envoy reported to the C.I.A. and State Department that the information was unequivocally wrong and that the documents had been forged. The envoy reported, for example, that a Niger minister whose signature was on one of the documents had in fact been out of office for more than a decade. In addition, the Niger mining program was structured so that the uranium diversion had been impossible. The envoys debunking of the forgery was passed around the administration and seemed to be accepted  except that President Bush and the State Department kept citing it anyway. Its disingenuous for the State Department people to say they were bamboozled because they knew about this for a year, one insider said. The envoy is, of course, Ambassador Wilson, and he has outed himself as one of the sources for that column (yes, there were others). One of the criticisms from the right is that I say that the vice president dispatched Wilson to Niger, but thats incorrect. The wording in the column is simply that Cheney asked for more information about the uranium deal, and then the former ambassador was dispatched. And thats what happened. In fairness, though, it is true that Cheney apparently didnt know that Wilson had been dispatched. If Id known that I would have said so. And in a later column I said Wilson had been dispatched at the behest of Cheneys office; its true that he was sent in response to Cheneys prodding, but that wording wasnt choice because it can easily be read to mean that Cheney asked for the trip.The better objection is that the references to the documents themselves make it sound as if the envoy may have had the documents in possession, while in fact he didnt. The U.S. didnt obtain the documents themselves until the fall of that year. But we did then have the information in them, including the full text and the names of the ministers who signed the contracts. And Wilson was briefed on the details of the contracts in his meeting with C.I.A. and State Department experts on Feb. 19, 2003. As the Senate Intelligence Committee report says: The INR analysts meeting notes and electronic mail (e-mail) from other participants indicate that INR explained its skepticism that the alleged uranium contract could possibly be carried out.The INR analysts notes also indicate that specific details of the classified report on the Iraq-Niger uranium deal were discussed at the meeting, as well as whether analysts believed it was plausible that Niger would be capable of delivering such a large quantity of uranium to Iraq. So could Wilson have debunked documents that he hadnt seen? Well, yes. If he knew details of the contract and reported back that it was implausible, sure. Did he? By the spring of 2003, the problems in the signatures of the documents had been pointed out, but I dont see much evidence that they had been noted in 2002 by Wilson or anybody else. Rather, the debunking of the contract was based mostly on the implausibility of obtaining uranium in Niger because of the way the industry was structured. So Wilson has said that he misspoke when he made references to the documents to me and to two other journalists.Theres also a suggestion from the right that Wilson was wildly spinning me and others and exaggerating how strongly he debunked the deal. The Senate Intelligence Committee Report is very harsh on Wilson, and theres a sense in spookdom that it came down too hard on him and was based on interviews with too few people. The C.I.A. seems to have thought that a Niger uranium deal was conceivable but not very likely, while at State the intelligence bureau (INR) was sure that it never happened. But it does seem to be true that Wilson claims to have debunked the Niger deal more firmly than some people remember him debunking it.As for the quote about the State Department and bamboozlement, I think thats stands up well. The State Department accepted from the start that the Niger deal was phony. Indeed, an INR report saying so was circulated to the White House and elsewhere in February 2002. And apparently the information from Wilsons trip was also sent to the White House, although it didnt seem to make much of a splash and theres no evidence that Cheney saw it.So where does that leave us? I think that the attacks on Wilson are overdone. He clearly was wrong in any hinting that he had seen the documents, but he has acknowledged that. He may have exaggerated how strongly he debunked the documents, but that seems to depend a bit on who was listening.Then theres a separate question of whether Valerie Wilson was responsible for sending him to Niger. His critics have said that she was the key player in getting him the trip, and theyve cited the letter she wrote. He has cited various counter-arguments and other authorities. I havent done my own reporting on that issue, and so I wont get into it. More generally, I find the attacks on a private citizen like Wilson rather distasteful. Sure, he injected himself into the public arena with his op-ed column and TV appearances, and so some scrutiny is fair. But I figure its more important to examine and probe the credibility of, say, the vice president than a retired ambassador. And the fact is that his wifes career at CIA has been destroyed; shes never going to be Rome Station Chief. Incidentally, when the White House did once raise the issue of my Niger reporting with me, the senior official who complained did not argue that any of this was incorrect. Rather, he noted that Bushs reference in the State of the Union address was to Africa rather than to Niger  and that even if the Niger connection was fraudulent, there were possible linkages to other African countries like Congo that could have made Bushs 16 words technically correct. That was a very flimsy branch, and the official gave up the argument pretty quickly.",2005-11-02T16:22:45+0000

Dr. Arditti pioneered futures contracts that transformed how businesses and individuals manage risk, most notably the CME's Eurodollar futures, the world's most actively traded futures contact. The Eurodollar contract was the first futures instrument based on ""cash settlement,"" a seminal feature of its incredible success. Dr. Arditti returned to the CME in 1997 to assume a leadership role in the development of the exchange's weather derivatives market, its Research, Marketing and Clearing functions, as well as its electronic trading business, which now account for approximately 75% of all its trade. Fred Arditti's 40-year career exemplifies his commitment to financial market innovation as recognized by the CME's award named in his honor. His achievements embody the kind of innovative thinking and practical benefit to commerce and markets that this award strives to honor. William F. Sharpe, the 1990 Nobel Laureate in economics, became the first recipient of the Fred Arditti Innovation Award in 2004. In his many activities outside of CME, Dr. Arditti taught courses in futures and options at a number of prestigious universities, both in the U.S. and abroad and has been published in various academic journals. His book ""Derivatives: A Comprehensive Resource for Futures, Interest Rate Swaps and Mortgage Securities,"" are among the most assigned books on the subject in many universities. A native New Yorker, Dr. Arditti was born and raised in the Bronx. He received his Undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering, and his PhD. in Economics from M.I.T. in 1966. At the time of his death at age 66, Dr. Arditti was a tenured professor of Finance at DePaul University, having retired from the position of Senior Executive Vice President of the CME in March 2000. A life-long Yankee fan, Dr. Arditti lived in Chicago, and is survived by his mother, Marie Arditti, his children Elizabeth (Johnson) and her husband Bart, Annie Arditti and David Arditti.

Therefore, it will be missing from the list of the top 15 best-selling books, to be published in the Nov. 13 edition of The Times Book Review. On the list to be published this Sunday, which is currently available online at www.nytimes.com, ""The Da Vinci Code"" ranks No. 12, in its 136th consecutive week on the list. The decline, while somewhat related to an inevitable lag in sales for a book that has been out so long, can also be traced to the publication in recent weeks of a raft of new highly anticipated books from authors like Patricia Cornwell, Danielle Steel and Nicholas Sparks. All of the books ahead of ""Da Vinci"" on the list have been on sale for five weeks or less.

Business leaders praised the proposal, but Denis M. Hughes, the president of the state's A.F.L.-C.I.O., said it appeared to make it harder for injured workers to receive benefits. Assemblywoman Susan V.

us,The Listings: Nov. 4 -- Nov. 10; BEBO VALDS,"The triumphant re-emergence of elderly Cuban musicians has become something of a clich in recent years. But the pianist and composer Bebo Valds, above, has more than earned his late acclaim. During the 1950's, Mr. Valds was musical director of the Tropicana nightclub in Havana and a top-flight bandleader and sideman; he lays claim to inventing the batanga rhythm. His career took a turn with his defection in 1960; after settling in Stockholm, he spent three decades in obscurity. What brought him back was an invitation from the alto saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera to create what would become the 1995 album ""Bebo Rides Again"" (Universal Latino). A follow-up album, ""El Arte Del Sabor"" (Blue Note) reunited Mr. Valds with the great bassist Israel Lpez(known as Cachao) and won a Grammy Award. Mr. Valds received even wider exposure in ""Calle 54,"" a 2000 documentary by Fernando Trueba, and on a subsequent run of albums produced by Mr. Trueba and Nat Chediak. The best known, ""Lgrimas Negras"" (Calle 54), was a rapturous meeting with the Spanish flamenco singer Diego El Cigala; the latest, ""Bebo de Cuba"" (Calle 54), is a brilliantly sprawling showcase, featuring a coterie of highly skilled New York musicians in both arranged and ad hoc settings. At the Village Vanguard -- a setting more familiar to the pianist Chucho Valds, his son -- Mr. Valds, now 87, will cast a more intimate spell. Backed by the bassist Javier Colina, a partner from the Cigala project, he will attest to the majesty of Latin music, but light-handedly, with a genuine jazz touch. (Tuesday through Nov. 13, 9 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum.)",2005-11-04T05:00:00+0000

us,'In Cold Blood',"The release of Bennett Miller's ""Capote"" has given Film Forum an excuse to screen a new print of Richard Brooks's ""In Cold Blood."" That movie, released in 1967 -- remarkably soon after the publication of Truman Capote's book and the execution of its two main characters -- is well worth revisiting. Filmed in some of the places in Kansas where the events depicted actually happened (including the penitentiary where Perry Smith and Dick Hickock were executed and the house where their victims lived and died), ""In Cold Blood"" is a potent and atmospheric example of noir-tinged naturalism. Conrad Hall's black-and-white cinematography takes us into a shadowy world of irrational evil, while Quincy Jones's score provides a hint of human warmth to the bleak landscape. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake (above right, with Mr. Wilson) play the killers, and John Forsythe plays Alvin Dewey, the investigator played by Chris Cooper in ""Capote."" Together, the movies, separated by almost 40 years, offer some intriguing meshes and contrasts. In some ways, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote provides the piece of ""In Cold Blood"" that has always been missing, but ""In Cold Blood,"" on the screen and on the page, remains terrifyingly complete and coherent unto itself.

Quirkily modified humanimals, they have features ranging from hominid to rodent, with expanses of hairless skin. Some get cuddly with people; others bare feral teeth. These could-be-real creatures, revealed in sculptures and photographs, spring from the mind of Patricia Piccinini, an Australian artist concerned with new reproductive technologies. She calls her beasties ""Nature's Little Helpers"" for their role in ""assisting"" endangered Australian wildlife. One is the winsome little ""Surrogate,"" a smiling, potbellied being sculptured in silicon and acrylic resin whose function is to incubate the fetuses of the endangered northern hairy-nosed wombat until the wombat can cope with a less friendly environment. Another is the scary, snarling ""Bodyguard (for the Golden Helmeted Honeyeater),"" envisioned by the artist as a protector for a small yellow-and-black bird. The monkeylike physique of ""Bodyguard"" enables it to swing quickly from tree to tree to scare off predators; its ferocious fangs can act as sap-releasers for the bird's nutrition. Others in the Piccinini menagerie bond more mysteriously with humans (endangered species, too, come to think of it), like the cute little quadruped (above) that has sprung onto the shoulders of a startled woman to embrace her face and hair, or the peculiar but loving nanny with bony spine plates and blobby growths on (her?) back, who snuggles protectively with a sleeping child. Finally, a human-to-human relationship is seen in the out-of-the-loop Neanderthal mom who suckles a newly minted 21st-century infant out of rote motherly instinct. A little harder to fathom are Ms. Piccinini's ""Cyclepups,"" modified embryonic motorcycles in which biological processes are seen as affecting technology. Still, lovers of car culture will understand the need to nurture these creatures, too.

Her paternal grandparents were Zelig Laub Mandelkern (circa 1864-1936) and Yente (Yetta, Yiteleh) Gold, daughter of Schifre and Rafael Gold. Sylvia's first cousins were, paternally: Fancha Mandelkern and Rose (Ruchel) Gelbard (Mendel, 'Max'); and maternally: J. Barney Gross (Hazel), Klara Gruber, Ruchel Pasturnack, Fannie Schwalb (Joseph), and Regina Woolf (Stanley). A lifetime New Yorker, Sylvia's family moved to Bronx, Manhattan, and Brooklyn residences; and around 1921 to Astoria, Queens where they owned and lived above a small grocery store. Sylvia attended PS 6 and JHS 126 in Queens; and Julia Richman High School in Manhattan, which she graduated in 1932. Sylvia also attended college at CCNY, where she met William (Michalefsky) Michaels (1916 -1989), whom she married in 1939. Sylvia is survived by son Richard of Manhattan, son Robert and daughter-in-law Eileen Michaels of Niskayuna, NY; and grandchildren Isaac (17), Valerie (15), and Benjamin (13). Sylvia exhibited unwavering spirit, humor, courage, love of culture and travel, and high ethical standards. She taught these values by example. Graveside funeral services will be held privately at Riverside Cemetery (Rochelle Park, NJ). In lieu of flowers, cash donations may be made to Congregation Gates of Heaven (852 Ashmore Avenue, Schenectady, New York 12309) in memory of Sylvia Michaels.",2005-11-05T05:00:00+0000

An audience of 18.43 million saw Brandon's luck run out on ""Survivor""; on ""CSI"" (28.45 million), Grissom (William Petersen, left) exposed bogus bug evidence in court; and Alex Kingston (formerly of ""ER"") appeared on ""Without a Trace"" (20.25 million) as the femme fatale wife of a man being held for ransom in Mexico. NBC placed a distant second in both total viewers and the 18-to-49 demographic. ""The Apprentice"" (11.04 million) delivered its biggest audience of the season, perhaps because of Donald Trump's rash quadruple firing in last week's boardroom, but it's still way down, compared with last season's editions. CBS also ranked first on Wednesday: without a new episode of ABC's ""Lost"" on the schedule, its ""Criminal Minds"" was the night's most-watched program, with 16.3 million viewers. That night, an hourlong season premiere of ""That 70's Show"" (7.83 million) finished a strong first among adults 18 to 49 in the 8 o'clock hour. Overnight Nielsen figures indicated a nearly threefold increase in the New York area audience for the Latin Grammys, seen for the first time on Thursday on the Spanish-language television station Univision 41. The audience for the three-hour broadcast, close-captioned in English, from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles was put at 626,000, in contrast to the 212,000 viewers who watched it on WCBS-TV last year.

The reason for this is as simple and as complicated as the plates themselves -- severe white ramekins and square service pieces imported from France for the occasion.

us,The Grown-Ups' Table,"Some things never lose their cool, no matter how many times you see them. Eero Saarinen's Pedestal table, designed for Knoll in the mid-1950's, is one of them. It's elegant but not pretentious, giving it the ability to blend into any dining room. Like its companion, the iconic Pedestal chair (also known as the Tulip chair), the table -- with its sweeping base of synthetic-coated aluminum -- was Saarinen's attempt at clearing up ""the slum of legs"" that he felt plagued most interiors. It's a graceful solution, although not without its drawbacks: because the base has so much surface area, it requires constant dusting. But that seems like a small price to pay for the pleasure of the table's company. It first appeared in my life when I was an adolescent and my father bought one, with six chairs, from an architect friend for his office conference room. My parents hadn't owned anything modernist since the early years of their marriage, so the Saarinen seemed especially groovy. Later, it became my parents' informal dining table, and while ridding its white laminate top of the ink from breakfast newspapers was a minor annoyance, there was something quite satisfying about a table that came with swivel chairs. Sometimes there's nothing like a good spin after a meal. Today, the table has moved into my father's home office, and I miss it. A few years ago, in a fit of nostalgia, I went to the annual Knoll sale and bought a Saarinen side table with a marble top for my apartment. I thought it would provide a nice contrast to the mostly traditional upholstered furniture in my living room. It did, indeed, so why wasn't I happy with it? The answer came to me only recently: you can't eat breakfast or read the paper at a side table. Time to trade up. Pilar Viladas TIMELESS",2005-11-06T05:00:00+0000

Crew continues its partnership with Loro Piana in addition to starting several others for the winter men's wear line.

""Can there be anything new to say about our 16th president?"" He answers with a firm ""yes."" McPherson -- who retired in 2004 after teaching at Princeton for 42 years, and who holds the title of George Henry Davis '86 professor emeritus of American history -- elaborated on his strong endorsement of Goodwin's book in an e-mail message to the editors. He explained that there have been many studies of Lincoln published this year alone, including volumes on his speeches, his melancholy, his sexual orientation, his racial attitudes and his civil liberties record. But none tells us so much about Lincoln's political skills, policy decisions and management of the war. ""Team of Rivals"" is not a biography of Lincoln as such; for that, McPherson recommends Richard J. Carwardine's ""Lincoln"" (2003) or David Herbert Donald's ""Lincoln"" (1995). Instead, Goodwin has given us a group portrait of the Union's major leaders and, McPherson writes, woven their lives into a book ""that presents the whole as greater than the sum of its parts.""",2005-11-06T05:00:00+0000

Born in 1926, he grew up in Yonkers, and after law school, returned to New York City where he worked for the next 50 years as a litigator, prosecutor and eventually as a financial consultant and money manager. He graduated from Roosevelt High School, and went on to Princeton in 1944. He entered the Navy in WW II, serving until 1946 in the Pacific. He returned to Princeton where he became one of the founding members of the acapella group, The Tigertones. He went on to Harvard Law School, graduating in 1952. He returned to New York joining the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. In 1956, he became an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. He returned to private practice with Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom in 1958. In 1960, he helped start what is now Mackay Shields Financial in pension fund asset management. Since then, he continued to be a money manager and financial consultant, having sat on the boards of five publically held corporations including Gleason Works, Kollmorgen Corporation and others. More recently, he was on the advisory board for Sageworks, and for the last eight years, he has been affiliated with Jefferson Financial Group of Stamford, CT.

Leon was a generous and caring man who gave and asked for nothing in return. He was a long time member of Walnut Hill United Methodist Church where he was considered family by many. Leon was born in New York, NY to Harry and Sophia (Greene) Pritzker. After attending New York City College, Leon entered the United States Army and served as a cryptanalyst in World War II from 1943-1946. Leon was a master of seven languages. Upon leaving the Army, he went to work for the Census Bureau where he worked as a Statistician in Washington DC from 1947-1961, and in the Chief Response Research branch from 1961-1967. In 1967 Leon left the Census Bureau to become the Director of Marketing Information Services for Anheuser-Busch, Inc. in St. Louis, MO. In 1973 he became the Director of Management Systems for Anheuser-Busch, Inc. In 1984 he was asked to be the Executive Vice-President of Staff Operations for Campbell Taggart, Inc. Dallas, a newly acquired company by Anheuser-Busch, Inc. In 1990 Leon retired from AnheuserBusch and Campbell Taggart, but consulted for many years thereafter. Leon was well known in the mathematics and statistics communities as well as being a respected food company executive. Leon married his beloved wife MaryAnne E. (Watts) Pritzker on her birthday, December 12, 1970. They have five children and 12 grandchildren, with one greatgrandchild on the way. Leon earned his BS from the City College of New York in 1942. After W.W.II, he earned his Master's from the University of Pennsylvania in 1947. Leon was a member of Sigma Xi and Phi Beta Kappa. Leon Pritzker is listed in the Who's Who in America, Who's Who in the Midwest, and the American Men of Science. Leon was a visiting faculty member of the Case Institute Technical College in Cleveland, OH from 1954-1955, consulted for the Census and Statistical Bureau, Government of Israel, Jerusalem in 1961, and was an Instructor of Statistics for the Government of Turkey, Ankara, in 1967. Leon served with honor in the United States Army from 1943-46. He was a recipient of the Commerce Departments Meritorious Service Award (1954). Leon contributed numerous articles to professional journals and was cited in many other publications. Leon is a Fellow in the American Statistical Association, and member in Operations Research Society, Society for Information Management, International Association of Survey Statisticians, and the Walnut Hill United Methodist Church. Leon taught Sunday school and was a mentor to many of his fellow parishioners. Leon truly lived as if each day was the day that the Lord had made, and rejoiced in each of them. Leon was a wonderful father, husband, grandfather and friend. His passing will leave an unimaginable void on this earth, and he will be dearly missed. A memorial was held to celebrate the life of Leon Pritzker at Walnut Hill United Methodist Church in Dallas on November 4, 2005. A private committal was held at Restland Memorial Park. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to the Walnut Hill United Methodist Church, Salvation Army, or the Red Cross.",2005-11-06T05:00:00+0000

The crash was made worse, however, because the pilots delayed using the thrust reversers, according to investigators. A sheaf of reports released by the National Transportation Safety Board found flaws in split-second decision making just before the crash, which badly injured both of the pilots and two men in a car that the plane hit after crashing through the airport fence. The reports also identified a variety of problems with the training of both pilots and of the cabin aide,' a 22-year-old woman who had previously worked as a model and a waitress. Her brief training did not include handling a fire extinguisher or learning how to instruct passengers to assume a braced position before a crash, the reports said.

""One is the artful charmer, prone to the gossamer and the exquisite. . . . The other, darker and stronger, is the discoverer of death. . . . He now broods with the austerity of a Greek or an Elizabethan."" Almost 40 years later, Capote's book is once again a best seller -- it's at No. 7 on the nonfiction paperback list, in a crisp edition tied into the new movie. (In 1966, the book was a hardcover best seller for more than eight months; it would later spend eight months on the paperback list.) Knickerbocker's review was accompanied by a rambling interview with the author, conducted by George Plimpton. Capote defended the ""nonfiction novel,"" telling Plimpton, ""It seems to me that most contemporary novelists, especially the Americans and the French, are too subjective, mesmerized by private demons; they're enraptured by their navels, and confined by a view that ends with their own toes."" That sounds like the complaint Tom Wolfe would make two decades later about American fiction, writing in Harper's Magazine. But, interestingly, Capote was no fan of Wolfe's writing, at least not back in 1966. When Plimpton asked him what he thought of the New Journalism, which was then only nascent, Capote defended his turf: ""If you mean James Breslin and Tom Wolfe, and that crowd, they have nothing to do with creative journalism -- in the sense that I use the term -- because neither of them, nor any of that school of reporting, have the proper fictional technical equipment.""",2005-11-06T05:00:00+0000

Many people believe this is true. It is not. Only if a person under 65 is on some Federal aid program such as AFDC or a disability program is he/she eligible for Medicaid. Others have an option of a free clinic, if available, or an E.R. for an emergency condition. However, E.R.s only stabilize a person if further care or diagnostic work is indicated, such as a mammogram or even chemo for cancer, usually such a person is totally out of luck.

Resident of New York City, NY, Fire Island Pines, NY and Palm Springs, CA died suddenly of a heart attack on Thursday, November 3, 2005 in Manhattan. Born May 24, 1941, the cherished third son of Edwin S. Sr. and Benita ""Bonnie"" Brokken, Jim's childhood was spent on the family cattle farm with five brothers and a sister west of Harmony, MN. In his early teens, occasional trips to visit relatives in the United States sparked an interest in travel that would continue throughout his life. Despite the untimely death of his father and resulting family obligations, he remained undeterred in pursuing his education. After receiving a B.S. in Business from the University of Minnesota, in 1963, he served his country as a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy aboard the aircraft carrier USS Independence in the Vietnam and European Theatres. Returning stateside, he joined Northwestern Bank in Minneapolis, MN and continued his education receiving in 1969, a Master's in International Business from the American Graduate School of International Management (Thunderbird), Phoenix, AZ. After a year at Ford Motor Company in Detroit, MI, Jim accepted a position with Manufacturers Hanover Bank and moved to New York City. He remained with the bank from 1970 until his retirement in 1991, as Executive Vice President-Group Head of Europe. In retirement, he continued to provide advisory services through JR Brokken Investments to select clients and has pursued personal interests in history, travel and family, as well as philanthropic interests in education, human rights, and social services. Jim's passing leaves an unimaginable void for his family and friends. He had a loving generous spirit and lived life to the fullest measure. Preceded in death by his parents, partner of 22 years, Ed Schroer and brother Bingham Brokken. Survived by brothers Dr. Edwin (Pat) Brokken of NJ, Dr. William (Doris) Brokken of CA, Dr. Thomas (Sally) Brokken of FL, Frederick (Kay) Brokken of MN, and sister Bonnie (Jim) Bradt of CA and many loving nephews and nieces and devoted friends.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   WHITE, JEFF","WHITE--Jeff. President of JWT Atlanta, died Saturday, November 5, while on a business trip to Washington to attend the Annual Marines Corps Birthday Ball. The U.S. Marines played a key role in Jeff's life. He served during the Viet Nam War, from 196871, rising to the rank of Captain. But his active service with the Marines continued, in effect, all his life. As the senior JWT executive supervising the Marine Corps advertising account, one of JWT's longest tenured, Jeff helped lead the creation of some of the most memorable and effective recruitment advertising programs in advertising history. ""The Few,the Proud, the Marines"" campaigns have won more awards for effectiveness than any other for military recruitment. Innovative use of public service announcements, internet advertising, and recruitment efforts aimed at women and minority officer candidates broke new ground under his direction. A native of Chicago and graduate of University of Illinois, Jeff White joined JWT in Chicago in 1968, and shortly went on leave for active duty in Viet Nam. Returning to JWT in 1971, he worked on the Gillette Safety Razor account, and later supervised the Northwestern Mutual Life insurance account. In the late 70's JWT recruited him to move to Washington, D.C. to lead the Marine Corps account, and he later ran that office. Subsequently, the Washington, D.C. office merged with the Atlanta office, and Jeff was selected to run that office. Other clients he served include Orkin, Norfolk Southern, FEMA, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Bridgestone Golf. Friends observed that Jeff White broke a lot of ""rules"" about advertising people. But he lived the basic truths that mattered. He shied away from spot lights. He believed credit belonged to the team, not to him. Never a fashion plate, the only suit that mattered was the Marine's dress blues. Tough, quiet, thoughtful--Jeff believed actions spoke louder than boastful claims. Jeff's sanctuary was his home, which he shared with his wife, Sue, their son Brad, and three bull dogs. He planned to retire next year to a new home being completed in South Carolina. He would have turned 60 on December 4. He is survived by his twin brother, Randy. Jeff White made a difference to his country. He made a difference to his Company. He made a difference to his friends. And he made all the difference to his family. We will miss him enormously. Visitation for Mr. White will be 6:00-8:00 P.M. Thursday evening, November 11, at Patterson Funeral Home, Oglethorpe Hill, 4550 Peachtree Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30319, Phone: 404-261-3510. A Marine Corps Honor Guard will be in attendance. In lieu of flowers, the family has requested donations of toys or money to the Toys for Tots program sponsored by the Marine Corps Reserves.

Excluding Novelis, Alcan's pretax profit in the quarter rose by $4 million, to $725 million, from a year earlier because of higher shipments and selling prices for raw aluminum.

Arthur Falek born March 23, 1924 in Brooklyn, NY died on November 7, 2005 from congestive heart failure. Dr. Falek was well loved for his humor and grace and will be missed by family and friends. He completed his Masters Degree in Education and a doctorate in Human Genetics in 1956 from Columbia University. In 1965 he became Director of the Human Genetics Laboratory in the Psychiatry Department of Emory University, which led to his interest in the developing field of behavior genetics. In 1967, Dr. Falek started working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP), which has made major contributions to understanding the incidence and causes of birth defects and is the foundation upon which the current National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at CDC was built. In 1979, he was awarded Georgia Mental Health Institute's Individual of the Year Award for his research into the causes of behavorial differences. At that time, he also became a national board member of the Committee on the Problems of Drug Dependency--a group devoted to understanding and combating drug abuse. Dr. Falek established the Georgia Huntington's Disease registry to track families in which HD occurred and to provide genetic counseling for those families. In the late 60's, Dr. Falek and Marjorie Guthrie, the wife of folksinger Woody Guthrie, co-founded the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease--a support group for HD families and a lobbying agency for HD research. Dr. Falek served on the boards of both the Georgia HDSA chapter and of the national organization as science advisor. For this service he won the HDSA Mason Thompson Award. In the mid-70s, Dr. Falek received the first National Institute on Drug Abuse grant to study how drugs affect the health of AIDS addicts based on their ability to fight disease both from HIV and from other opportunistic infections. This field has expanded greatly over the last two decades and led directly to a dozen international conferences on drugs and AIDS, the formation of a scientific society (Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology) and recently a Journal of NeuroImmune Pharmacology--all of which Dr. Falek was involved in starting. For his work on the effects of illicit drugs on AIDS progression, Arthur Falek received The Medal of the City of Paris, awarded in May 1990 by Mayor Jacques Chirac. In 1980, Dr. Falek initiated the Fetal Alcohol Surveillance project in Georgia. This project was one of the first to identify the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and to describe the behavioral characteristics of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and has contributed to the prevention of this common disorder. While at Emory, Arthur Falek taught several generations of medical students and was mentor to a large number of doctoral students and faculty members who went on to carve out their own distinguished careers in human genetic research, psychiatry and substance abuse. In addition to his academic excellence, Dr. Falek was well known for his community contributions including his service on numerous boards including the Jewish Family and Career Services in Atlanta; the Georgia Fetal Alcohol Task Force; Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies; the Robischer Society, and a myriad of other community service organizations in Atlanta. Dr. Falek was active in many local, national and international Jewish organizations including the Jewish Educational Loan Fund, where he was President and Chairman of the Board; Jewish Family and Career Services of Atlanta; and at Hebrew University where he helped to establish The Sheinfeld Center for Behavior Genetics. Dr. Falek was also an advisor to Hillel on the Emory campus. Dr. Falek is survived by his wife Rhoda, his children Linda and husband Andrew Aymes; James Falek and wife Wendy Tanson; six grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, his sister Nina Epstein and his caregivers Juanita ""Christy"" Bowen and Rosa Parpolov.

He offered me the most sage advice. His optimism and love of life which helped get him through trying times rubbed off on me too. Fred always knew how to get me through a difficult time. He was truly one-of-a-kind. His friendship will be missed beyond words. His spirit and my love for him will be with me always. You should know, Fred, that there are so many people who will support your family as you supported your friends for so many years. Thank you, Fred. My heart goes out to Janice, Joanie, Lisa, Mindy, Julie and their families. Arthur Pergament $(6$)WEISBERG--Fred. All of us at Weisberg, Mole, Krantz & Goldfarb wish to express our deepest sympathies to the Weisberg family on the passing of our dear friend, Fred Weisberg. Throughout the years, Fred's friendships and relationships provided the bedrock that this firm has used as its foundation. Fred's compassion, guidance and wisdom were a beacon for all of us that were fortunate to have been touched by his life. His character and dignity earned him respect and loyalty on a level not often attained in life. His devotion to his family and friends was uncompromised and the love he displayed and shared was returned to him many times over by all of us who had the privilege of his friendship and companionship over the years. We perceive Fred's life to be summed up in one simple word--Love; Love for the Deal, Love for Life, Love for Friends and most importantly, Love for Family. He will be deeply missed and forever remembered. $(6$)WEISBERG--Fred. The Employees of Pergament Advisors are deeply saddened by the passing of our good friend and company mentor, Fred Weisberg.

I made a bet with him that he would be in the pros after graduation. I won. But thats not the point. Pat Tillman was my hero, then as well as today. He never gave up. I saw him repeatedly defy all odds. He was a singular person. I am so upset as to what the military did upon his death. Nothing but lies and cover ups. I pray for Pats parents and wife. Thank you for writing about a man I will never forget as long as I live. He was betrayed as well as our country.

us,The Listings: Nov. 11 -- Nov. 18; 'WYNTON WITH STRINGS: 25TH-YEAR CELEBRATION',"At first glance, a concert featuring Wynton Marsalis with a string orchestra might seem like a step in the wrong direction. Mr. Marsalis, above, whose high-culture bona fides were established well before he became the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, has recently done his strongest work in casual settings. His most recent album, ""Live at the House of Tribes"" (Blue Note), documents a small-group performance in vibrant close quarters; it's clear, from Mr. Marsalis's high-stakes trumpet soloing, that the crowd's whoops and hollers provide more than background noise. As a programmatic concept, ""Wynton With Strings"" offers more muted pleasures. But Mr. Marsalis set romantic jazz standards against lush orchestral settings as early as 1984, on the album ""Hot House Flowers"" (Columbia); he offered a sequel in 1998, ""Standard Time, Vol. 5: The Midnight Blues"" (Columbia). During his three consecutive nights at the Rose Theater, he'll revisit this material with his quartet and an orchestra led by the jazz-literate conductor Robert Sadin. The music will shimmer and swell, and Mr. Marsalis will favor a tender sort of effulgence. What makes the project especially enticing is the potential for small surprises: the string arrangements have been updated, and Mr. Marsalis is a more thoughtful improviser than he was a decade or even five years ago. For those familiar with the scope of his 25-year solo career, these concerts could serve as a benchmark. For most everyone else, the romance of the evening will be more than enough.

Then, after trying to ease as many of the production stresses as they could, they stepped away to let choreographers and dancers figure things out for themselves.

us,The Listings: Nov. 11 -- Nov. 17; 'CHRISTIAN SCHUMANN: VARIATIONS AND SUPPOSITIONS',"Known until now for his densely worked paintings of goofy cartoon imagery, Christian Schumann has taken a surprising turn to abstraction. He is now making atmospheric color fields, hard-edged stripe paintings (""Low Tide,"" above) and glowing, hourglass-shaped images. What remains from his earlier style is his propensity for finely grained graphic articulation: each painting is overlaid by a neatly brushed, see-through basket-weave grid, a kind of sheer netting that gives it a pixilated appearance. Up close you see that the colors of the weave pattern change subtly in response to the more broadly painted underlying areas. The paintings are absorbing and meditative, but something feels not fully realized about them. They seem tentative compared with the earlier, brashly comical works, and it looks as if Mr. Schumann is searching for something that so far has eluded his grasp. Three paintings are in Mr. Schumann's more familiar style: finely outlined cartoon landscapes with sprawling developments of rubbery architecture, roadways, cars and trucks. They are like collaborations between Yves Tanguy and R. Crumb, and though they appear more resolved than the abstractions, in the context of the show they look more like the end than the beginning of something.

us,The Listings: Nov. 11 -- Nov. 17; LARRY MOSS,"If you are interested in starring in a one-person show, here's some advice: don't do it. This genre is already far too crowded and you would be better off working with dialogue instead. But if you must, here's some more advice: call Larry Moss. Over the last few years, Mr. Moss, above, the director and distinguished acting coach, has shaped and staged some of the best solo work in the city. His latest effort is directing ""RFK,"" a biographical play about the Kennedy who might have been president, starring Jack Holmes as the title character. It is running at the Culture Project. When watching an actor directed by Mr. Moss, one gets the sense that each choice has been mulled over and decided with considerable intelligence, and each moment fits snugly into the whole. ""The Syringa Tree,"" Pamela Gien's piece about the final years of apartheid South Africa, may be one of the most successful solo shows in recent years, and it grew out of an acting class conducted by Mr. Moss. ""Who Is Floyd Stearn?"" was one of the better confessional plays about family that I've seen. But Mr. Moss really impressed with the underrated ""Runt of the Litter,"" an account of life in the N.F.L. starring a former jock and theater novice, Bo Eason, who made the most of his limited acting skills. To use a sports clich, the great coaches get the best out of their players. (Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983.)",2005-11-11T05:00:00+0000

A further spell in office for such an exhausted man, assuming he survived, would have sapped his energy and dulled his appetite for any major writing project. But while electoral defeat made possible literary triumphs, Churchill did not retire from politics and statecraft. Such was the scale of his defeat in 1945 that he burned for political vindication, and the story of The Second World War is inextricably bound up with his zeal to keep on making history. Nor, despite expectations, did he embark straightaway on the war memoirs. He was to take the plunge only when the conditions were right, and they took time to establish. It was not until the spring of 1946 that Churchill resolved the conundrum: to write or not to write. ",2005-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Not so fast, charged the Center for Consumer Freedom in a press release e-mailed to those same editors about two hours later, calling the Physicians Committee an ""animal-rights front group"" with a hidden agenda. The Center for Consumer Freedom, identified as a nonprofit coalition of restaurants and food companies, said that the word ""healthy"" was ""just another term for PETA-approved,"" referring to the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The Center said it wanted to stop travelers from being misled into thinking ""that all nonvegetarian food is unhealthy.""

Released in 1995, the first film, directed by Chris Noonan, who also wrote the screenplay with Mr. Miller, spins an enchantingly sunny tale about a young orphaned pig who becomes a prize-winning sheep herder, thereby earning the affections of the farmer (James Cromwell) who might otherwise have made bacon and chops of him. Three years later, Mr. Miller took up the directing reins for the dark and rather more grown-up sequel, which tracks Babe (voiced by E. G. DAILY) as he and the farmer's wife (MAGDA SZUBANSKI) travel to a Dickensian city following a calamity at the farm. A grim metropolis roiling with peril, the city introduces Babe to a world of exotic excitement and a new menagerie whose numbers include chimps and a rampaging pit bull. Babe's nearly fateful meeting with the pit bull conveys more terror and tenderness than similar encounters in most human-centered films, and suggests that the film's bold message -- ""a kind and steady heart can mend a sorry world"" -- may not be so unattainable after all.

The new title at No. 1 is ""The Truth (With Jokes),"" by Al Franken, a gloomier, more astringent book than his ""Lies (and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them),"" which came out in 2003. Franken's new one has dark circles under its eyes. ""The Truth (With Jokes)"" went to press before Katrina and the indictment of Lewis Libby, so it already feels mildly dated; and regular readers of political blogs, which have multiplied exponentially since Franken's last book, may feel a lot of the material here (on John Kerry and his ""Swift Boat"" attackers, Abu Ghraib, Fox News) has already been hashed to death. But Franken is more wicked than your average blogger. In his new book he recalls how Paul Wolfowitz, then the deputy secretary of defense, told Congress in April 2004 that ""approximately 500"" Americans had been killed in Iraq up to that point, when the actual number was 722. ""The next Saturday,"" Franken writes, ""I happened to run into Wolfowitz at the White House Correspondents Dinner. 'You want to hear the joke I've been using about your not knowing how many of our troops had died in Iraq?' I asked. The small group that had gathered around us made it impossible for him to say no.

The alloy of glamour and artistry that great screen actors embody may not survive the currency crisis precipitated by reality television and the Internet. At least for the moment, however, movie stars still serve as the gold standard of modern fame. Indeed, the rise of cheap, interchangeable, mass-produced celebrity may have endowed those whose primary medium is the big screen with a bit of added gravity, renewing their license to be taken (or to take themselves) seriously.

us,Beverly Hills Coup?,"Last August, in Beverly Hills, I stopped in to see the actor, director and producer Rob Reiner, who has emerged in recent years as a highly articulate spokesman for Democratic causes and an acid critic of the president and his war in Iraq. There was a time, decades ago, when studio executives were the main political players in Hollywood, and like the heads of other profitable American industries, they spent their capital on their own parochial interests, things like intellectual property rights and access to foreign markets. Hollywood was as political as any other company town, but it was the bosses, and not the movie stars, who did the lobbying. Ronald Reagan helped change that tradition when he entered politics in the 1960's, opening the forbidden portal between two disconnected worlds, and by the time Bill Clinton occupied the White House in the 1990's, it was not unusual for Michael Douglas or Warren Beatty to turn up at a formal Washington dinner, or for Barbra Streisand to send a policy memo to a Congressional leader. The edict that Sam Goldwyn is said to have issued to filmmakers -- ""If you want to send a message, try Western Union"" -- has never seemed more pass. Both on-screen and off, famous and wealthy activists like Reiner now regard themselves not just as messengers but also as their own kind of opposition party, an essential bulwark against a president who would transform America into a ruthless global aggressor.",2005-11-13T05:00:00+0000

The year is 2001. The Englishman is ninety-one years old. He carries a cane, the old-fashioned kind, wooden with a hooked handle, although he does not always use it. The dome of his head, smooth as an eggshell, gleams pale in the bright midday Roman sun. He is dressed in his customary manner-a dark blue double-breasted suit, hand tailored on Savile Row more than thirty years ago, and a freshly starched white shirt with gold cuff links and a gold collar pin. His hearing is still sharp, his eyes clear and unclouded. He wears glasses, but then he has worn glasses ever since he was a child. The current pair are tortoiseshell and sit cockeyed on his face, the left earpiece broken at the joint. He has fashioned a temporary repair with tape. The lenses are smudged with his fingerprints.

""Conduct Under Fire"" is a chaotic, undisciplined, seriously flawed, and wonderful book. Glusman's father, a Navy doctor, was captured by the Japanese on Corregidor in 1942 and imprisoned, along with three of his colleagues, for nearly three and a half years. This is supposed to be their story, but the author wanders so haphazardly that we never really get to know the men, not even Glusman's father, Murray. Instead, Glusman has amassed a truly astounding amount of information about P.O.W.'s in the Pacific, down to what seems to be every last illness, ration and death. At one point, describing a sinking ship, he writes: ""Her position was 20.00N 118.44E, southeast of the Pratas Reefs."" (Yes, I can picture it now.) Still, the details have a cumulative power. Lucille Ferguson continued to receive postcards from her husband, one of the four doctors, listing his health as excellent, for nearly a year after his death. One American nightclub owner, known as ""High Pockets"" because she stuffed her bra with valuables, smuggled 10,000 quinine tablets into a camp. And there's the story of Second Lt. Robert Overbeck, a P.O.W. on a Japanese ship hit by the Americans. Overbeck swam out the torpedo hole, found a lifeboat, discovered a sail in a crate that was floating by, and made it 250 miles to the only strip of China's coast not occupied by the Japanese. If Glusman had exerted more control over these riches, ""Conduct"" might have been a home run. As it is, the details get him to third base.",2005-11-13T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Lost Painting': The Caravaggio Trail,"Historians take windows where they can find them, and in certain circles this entry from a 17th-century ledger bears particularly vivid witness: On Jan. 2, 1603, a Roman nobleman named Ciriaco Mattei paid 125 scudi - the liras of the day - for what his bookkeeper described as ""a painting with its frame of Christ taken in the garden."" The artist in question, Michelangelo Merisi, known to most of us as Caravaggio (after his hometown outside Milan), was then among the most famous, innovative and copied painters in Rome - the Picasso of his day, more or less. But tastes change, and the realism that was bracing and revelatory to his contemporaries left a bad odor in the 18th and 19th centuries. By the turn of the last one Caravaggio had become but a footnote in art history. And so, another window: on April 16, 1921, according to the notation on a catalog from a now defunct auction house, ""The Taking of Christ,"" misattributed at the time to a minor Dutch painter, was sold at auction in Edinburgh, for a mere eight guineas, a silk purse pawned off as a pig's ear.",2005-11-13T05:00:00+0000

The first fully computer-animated movie produced by Walt Disney, it grossed $32 million, a second-weekend slip of just 20 percent; its cumulative take so far is $80.7 million, according to studio estimates. ""This is what we would consider a very minimal drop,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, a box-office tracking company in Los Angeles. ""It says that word of mouth is great, and that obviously families are enjoying the movie. Disney's foray into their own homegrown computer-animated film is obviously highly successful. There's no question now that they can do this."" Three new films in wide release trailed far behind. ""Zathura"" (Sony), a space adventure directed by Jon Favreau, opened at No. 2 with $14 million. ""Derailed"" (Weinstein Company), starring Ms. Aniston and Clive Owen, was third with $12.8 million. And ""Get Rich or Die Tryin' "" (Paramount), the semifictional 50 Cent biopic directed by Jim Sheridan, took in $12.5 million over the weekend; in the five days since it opened on Wednesday, it has grossed $18.2 million. The Desert Storm war drama ""Jarhead"" (Universal) rounded out the Top 5 with $12.3 million in its second week of release. But the most successful film of the weekend, by one measure, was ""Pride & Prejudice"" (Focus Features), the new adaptation of the Jane Austen novel starring Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland. It made $2.8 million in a limited release at 215 theaters, but its per-screen average of $13,000 was the highest of this week's Top 12 movies. CATHERINE BILLEY",2005-11-14T05:00:00+0000

The show, which has five episodes left to run, has posted mainly meager ratings for NBC in two different time periods on Wednesday nights. Still, NBC is not cutting the show off in midrun as it would for a cancellation but will allow it to continue to its finale on Dec. 21. Network executives insisted yesterday that they were not changing any plan in not carrying Ms. Stewart's ""Apprentice"" forward. Mark Burnett, the executive producer of Ms. Stewart's ""Apprentice"" show and her daily show, said that he and NBC had agreed before the ""The Apprentice"" show started that Ms. Stewart ""could not possibly do another prime-time show"" because of her other television commitments and her other businesses. ""The 'Apprentice' deal was made to reintroduce Martha to the television landscape,"" he said. Most reality shows start out with open-ended futures and receive orders for additional runs only after they post good ratings. That was the case with the original ""Apprentice,"" starring Donald Trump, which was a breakout hit within its first few episodes and thus won quick approval from NBC for more editions. Mr. Trump's show, while its ratings have declined, remains among the top 20 shows in the weekly ratings in the category of viewers ages of 18 and 49 -- the group NBC cares most about -- and posted its best ratings of the year in the last two weeks.

The Fisheries Service expects that efforts to increase local salmon stocks will benefit the 89 remaining whales, whose number is up from 79 in 2001 but still lower than the 97 counted in the 1990's. The whales' small population makes them more vulnerable to disease, oil spills, toxic chemicals and declining salmon upon which to feed.

The decision yesterday was the latest development in several countries between Lego, based in Billund, Denmark, and Mega Bloks, a maker of interlocking bricks based in Montreal. Lego's fundamental patents on the toy expired in 1978. But nine years ago, it sued Mega Bloks for trademark infringement and asked for an injunction blocking sales of that company's toy blocks. The distinctive knobs on the top of the interlocking bricks, Lego argued, were so closely associated with the company that they had become an unregistered trademark. In upholding a lower court ruling against Lego, the Supreme Court dismissed that idea."" A purely functional design cannot be the basis of a trademark and trademark law should not be used to perpetuate monopoly rights enjoyed under now-expired patents,"" the court wrote in its decision.

It is worth seeking out, not only because ""Classe Tous Risques"" represents a missing piece of film history -- a link between the great postwar policiers and the brooding 1960's gangster dramas of Jean-Pierre Melville -- but because it is a tough and touching exploration of honor and friendship among thieves.",2005-11-18T05:00:00+0000

It also marked the rightful acknowledgment of what has become one of the most expressive large groups in jazz. The playing on ""Concert in the Garden"" captivates both in solo and ensemble terms; Ms. Schneider's billowing compositions, laced with Latin American harmony and rhythm, breathe in such a manner as to mask their scrupulous precision. This deceptively airy quality multiplies in concert, as the orchestra has proved on countless New York engagements. One, in January 2000, yielded ""Live at the Jazz Standard -- Days of Wine and Roses,"" a recording originally issued only to buyers of a Maria Schneider Riesling. Now available through ArtistShare (at www.mariaschneider.com), the album offers a glimpse at Ms. Schneider's history as a composer and arranger; several pieces date as far back as her student years at the Eastman School of Music. Most of the arrangements were staples of a mid-1990's residency at the now-defunct Greenwich Village club Visiones; Ms. Schneider, above, led the orchestra there every Monday night for five years. It was during that time that she began to reshape the harmonically astute big-band syntax of her mentors, the composers Gil Evans and Bob Brookmeyer, into a dialect of her own. Returning to the Jazz Standard this week, Ms. Schneider and her colleagues will speak it fluently.

us,The Listings: Nov. 18 -- Nov. 24; 'THE WOMEN OF GIACOMETTI',"Unlike the female subjects of Picasso and Matisse, women in the paintings and sculptures of Alberto Giacometti are rarely if ever objects of purely erotic desire -- not judging by this impressive, museum-quality exhibition of works depicting women from all phases of his career. In painted, mostly gray portraits, women described by innumerable fine lines appear inapproachably isolated in large rooms. (A recurrent sitter is the artist's mother, a formidable Swiss woman to whom he was deeply devoted.) Whether they are clothed or nude, Giacometti's painted women have a sad, disembodied remoteness, as if they were fading memories of an abandoned child. Nondescript, studentlike efforts from the 1920's provide few clues to Giacometti's feelings about his female subjects, but one of his best-known sculptures from the 30's, the Surrealistic semi-abstraction called ""Woman With Her Throat Cut,"" naturally invites suspicions of misogyny. However, murderous rage is not the animating spirit of the elongated, skinny, big-footed and heavily textured figures from the 50's for which he is most famous. Barely differentiated as female (see ""Women of Venice,"" above) they are like idols made by a tribe of prehistoric cave dwellers. These figures have been so widely reproduced that they start to look like a species of kitsch -- especially the ones riding on big chariots -- but in the gallery they still have a mysteriously urgent presence. Whether male or female, they are a valiant attempt to honor primordial gods who have continued to haunt the margins of rational consciousness ever since they were banished by the Enlightenment.

Ms. True, who is on trial in Rome on charges of conspiring to import illegally excavated antiquities for the Getty's collection, received the $400,000 loan from Lawrence Fleischman in 1996, three days after the Getty paid $20 million to acquire part of a renowned collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities owned by Mr. Fleischman and his wife, Barbara, the newspaper reported, citing loan documents and interviews. The couple gave the rest of the collection, valued at much more than $20 million, to the museum. The loan from Mr. Fleischman was used to repay money Ms. True had borrowed in 1995 in an original loan for the house, according to the article. When Ms. True stepped down in October, the Getty said only that she ""failed to report certain aspects of her Greek house purchase transaction in violation of Getty policy."" Ms. True's lawyer, Harry Stang, said yesterday that any implication that the loan from the collectors had any bearing on the sale and gift of their collection was false, adding that Ms. True's involvement in negotiations for the collection ended long before the loan offer was made. Ms. Fleischman, whose husband died in 1997 and who joined the Getty's board in 2000, said in an interview yesterday that she was aware of the loan but did not report it to the board because she did not believe it presented an ethical conflict. ""Looking back is very easy,"" she said. ""At the time, I was, well, call it nave or inexperienced."" She added, ""I do stand corrected, but I don't stand condemned.""",2005-11-18T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: Nov. 18 -- Nov. 24; 'IN THE CONTINUUM',"An H.I.V. diagnosis collapses the wide distance between the distinct worlds brought to life in this affecting new play written and performed by a pair of enterprising young actresses. The subject is journalistic, the approach intimately personal. Danai Gurira plays Abigail, a pregnant, proudly middle-class professional in Zimbabwe who learns that her husband has infected her with the AIDS virus. Nikkole Salter (above left, with Ms. Gurira) is Nia, a troubled 19-year-old in Los Angeles who contracted it from the hotshot basketball star about to leave her behind for a college scholarship. Ms. Gurira and Ms. Salter also play the various men and women Abigail and Nia look to for guidance or support, widening the play's focus to establish how both women's lives are circumscribed by dismayingly similar economic and cultural forces. Both are desperate not to alienate the men who have infected them. The buoyant performances and sharply detailed writing ensure that the play never moves to a drumbeat of doom. Warm and often disarmingly funny, it pulses with life from start to finish. Produced by Primary Stages and directed by Robert O'Hara, the production has moved to the Perry Street Theater in the West Village for a limited run after playing two performances a week uptown.

us,The Listings: Nov. 18 -- Nov. 24; SALLY SILVERS,"Ms. Silvers has been moving to her own drumbeat for 25 years now. Her dances are often dense and gnomic. But they repay the close attention they demand with continual small, surprising revelations: some slyly funny, some tender, and all springing from the unruliest of imaginations. Ms. Silvers, above, hasn't changed much from the keen-eyed political science major at Antioch College -- born in eastern Tennessee, too, for a little extra edge of exoticism -- who was turned on to performing partly by the avant-garde musicianship of the pianist Cecil Taylor. In New York, she was too odd to be chosen at auditions, and dance teachers suggested gently that what she was doing was nice enough, but not what everyone else was doing. She found herself in classes with Sara Rudner, who got the point of her. And she presented a first dance program that included a 30-minute piece in which she gave herself 30 problems to solve, like how to assume a sleeping position while standing up. Her anniversary program, at Performance Space 122 through Sunday, will feature a sextet called ""Puppy-Skills"" that will be performed by some of the favorite stars of the downtown dance and performance worlds, among them Vicky Shick, Paige Martin, Julie Atlas Muz and Jamie Di Mare. Two other starry types -- Pooh Kaye and Cydney Wilkes -- will perform an improvisation, dressed in inflatable-art costumes, with a different musician at each performance. And a different guest will create a dance on the spot at every performance in ""Live Choreography."" Ms. Silvers's longtime collaborator Bruce Andrews will provide the music, with Michael Schumacher. (Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 5 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m. and Nov. 25 and 26 at 8 p.m.; Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or www.ps122.org.)",2005-11-18T05:00:00+0000

After earning his B.S. from St. Joseph's University in 1974 and his M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in 1979, John went on to a distinguished 22-year career at Goldman Sachs. Under his leadership, the firm built a global investment management business that became a significant and integral part of the firm. John became a partner in 1990 and a managing director in 1996. He retired in June of 2001, but continued to serve as a Senior Director at the firm. At the time of his retirement, John was the head of the Investment Management Division and a member of the firm's Management Committee. Outside of Goldman Sachs, John was a strong advocate for education and the arts. He served on the Board of Trustees at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business, chaired St. Joseph's University's Finance Committee and was an advisory director at the Metropolitan Opera. He also was a patron of St. Joseph's School in Chinatown. In addition, John served as a trustee of The Aspen Institute and on the board of the Carnival Corporation & PLC. John is survived by his wife, Anne, and their three children, John, Brynne and Kevin, his mother and his siblings, Noreen Tully, Charles McNulty, Kevin McNulty and Mary Grady.

During his all too short life Maximilian (universally known as Max) Warner LeRoy--beloved son of Kay LeRoy and precious brother to Bridget Warner LeRoy, Carolyn Plum LeRoy and Jennifer Oz LeRoy--embraced an extraordinary number of people with a singular charisma during his 30 years; a life ended by a motorcycle accident in Los Angeles on November 3rd. He was a literal, as well as figurative, embrace. Max was a hugger par excellence, a habit that started in early childhood when his parents tried to teach him how to shake hands in greeting; he preferred hugging. Visitors to the LeRoy household were routinely assaulted by a dark-haired, dark-eyed ball of energy who threw himself at them, hugging whatever body parts he could best reach. After what became his signature hug (just a little longer, just a little tighter and just a little more loving than anyone else's), Max would step back to ask the hug-ee's name. He embraced life just as ferociously and with as much abandon. And he had an enormous capacity for living, because he was so prodigiously talented. The word ""best"" always surfaced when Max was discussed by his family and friends. He was the best musician, the best writer, the best cook, the best at getting the party going, the best at getting the girls, the best son, the best brother and the best friend. Most of all, he was the best at loving those same family and friends, the latter an always increasing circle of people he embraced--literally! Without that special Max love, reinforced by that patented Max hug, the world is a colder, harsher and lonelier place for all who knew him. The solace is that Max will now always be so young, so handsome and so vital, while the rest of us will not be so lucky.",2005-11-20T05:00:00+0000

He was a handsome man, with a broad brow and piercing dark eyes, and he was a social creature, stylishly dressed and coiffed and noticeable on the D.C. cocktail circuit, where he could be seen in the company of many of the president's closest advisers. Engman was a personable, if tightly wound, man as well, comfortable with business types and staff typists alike; when a young FTC appointee named Elizabeth Hanford (later Dole) had a minor accident and ended up in the emergency room on the day she was to be installed, Engman took his entire staff over to the hospital and swore her in while she was still in bed.

The Civil War, like any long-established brand, requires periodic repackaging to induce its fans to buy the new and improved version. But fresh angles on this conflict are as scarce as Mini balls in Iraq. It's not news that Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman were friends, and that together they led the Union to victory. Flood's inspiration is to devote an entire book to their friendship. Except that he doesn't, really: most of ""Grant and Sherman"" is given over to a battle-by-battle narrative of the war, from Fort Donelson to Appomattox. Flood, the author of books on Hitler and Robert E. Lee, pauses occasionally during the action to highlight the personal dynamics that allowed Grant and Sherman to forge an effective partnership, while other Union generals bickered and plotted. ""He stood by me when I was crazy,"" Sherman said of Grant, ""and I stood by him when he was drunk, and now, sir, we stand by each other always."" Actually, they had a falling out after the war, when Grant was president and Sherman led the Army. Flood unfortunately glosses over that period, giving it only a few pages. Which means, inevitably, that some enterprising author soon will give us ""Grant and Sherman: The Postwar Years."" Aprs Flood, le dluge.",2005-11-20T05:00:00+0000

Montemarano's remarkable stories are united by their dyspeptic outlook and not much else: this collection, his first, includes straightforward narratives and metafictional experiments, a surreal fantasy about grief, an acerbic parable of torture and the commercialization of 9/11, and one audacious 11-page sentence that hilariously (but grimly) details the tyranny of an obsessive-compulsive mother who demands that her children clean house just so. If there's a theme, it might be that damaged people have no business taking care of others, or even interacting with them. On the other hand, it might be that everybody is damaged beyond repair. One narrator, a passive-aggressive home health aide, does a good job describing all of Montemarano's characters when he talks about ""the usual human disabilities, like not knowing how to be nice or being a little too funny for your own good."" As the book proceeds, the experimental detours start to feel less ambitious and more perfunctory, but Montemarano's deft storytelling and ruthless honesty ensure that this collection is as dark and dazzling as a mine shaft studded with diamonds.",2005-11-20T05:00:00+0000

It's a lifelong habit, but it became something of a fixation about 15 years ago when I was sent by Granta magazine to the town of Hammerfest. Stuck above the Arctic Circle in Norway, in the dead of winter, I ran out of things to read. Hammerfest is the loneliest town in Europe -- 1,200 miles north of Oslo -- and it passes most of the winter in frigid darkness. I was there to write about the aurora borealis. (I believe the commissioning editor's hope was that I would just go amusingly insane.) I expected to be there for a week. Instead I got more thantwo weeks of cloud cover with no aurora. There is little to do in Hammerfest in winter but go for creeping walks in the pitch-blackness, watch the single channel of Norwegian television or read. I read. By the end of the second week, I had read everything in my possession, including the labels inside my suitcase and every word of the three English-language magazines sold in the local newspaper shop. I reached the point where I was calling in twice a day to find out if the new issue of Woman's Weekly had arrived. Since then I have never ventured abroad without packing more books than is strictly sensible and enough magazines that I can always have one rolled up in a back pocket. More often than not, it is a copy of The Economist, which I like very much except sometimes when it reviews my books. I'm pleased to report that on my 16th day in Hammerfest, the clouds parted and I saw an aurora. It was wonderful -- worth the trip. Just as good, the latest issue of The Lady arrived at the shop, so I had something to read -- and reread and read again -- on the 30-hour bus trip back to Oslo. TIMELESS",2005-11-20T05:00:00+0000

Like similar struggles on all the inhabited continents, it ran back millennia, perhaps to the moment humans first found their way across the Arctic plain from Asia. Oral tradition and archaeological evidence indicate that conflict was a regular feature of life among the North Americans. They fought for forests where the game was most abundant, for rivers where the fish were thickest, for bottomlands where their corn and beans and squashes grew most readily. Great warriors were the heroes of their tribes, emulated by other men, sought by women, hallowed in memory. Strong tribes expanded their territories, driving the weak to less-favored regions and sometimes to extinction.

The book, like Norman Mailer's ""Gospel According to the Son"" (1997), is a first-person account of the life of Jesus, though Rice cannily breaks off a smaller piece of that life, writing about him at age 7. (""It's as if Rice is casting Christ as the new Harry Potter,"" Chris Ayres wrote in The Times of London.) The book has arrived to some of the best reviews of Rice's career. There's something about writing in the voice of Jesus that smooths out a writer's prose; Reynolds Price, reviewing Mailer's book in the Book Review, didn't like Mailer's ""excess of self-effacement."" Yet Rice has been praised for pretty much the same thing. As Laura Miller put it in Salon: ""Gone are such Ricean devices as passages of florid description, conspicuous high-end consumption, endless assurances of the main characters' beauty and that odd, pseudo-archaic Germanic syntax that would later become a trademark of Yoda. (Pretentious it was.)"" Rice, who was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church, was an atheist for 30 years -- and wrote ""Interview With the Vampire"" and a pile of other pop-gothic novels -- before returning to the church in 1998. On ""Charlie Rose,"" she seemed grateful she's been welcomed back. ""I thought maybe,"" she said, ""I had been officially excommunicated.""",2005-11-20T05:00:00+0000

The two parties compete to win over the unassuming but pivotal figure that political scientists call the ""median voter"" -- the swing voter in the ideological center, who plays the decisive role come Election Day. The theory of the median voter is inspired by the analogy of two stores competing for customers: if consumers are evenly scattered in a region, the stores' best strategy is to locate right next to each other; otherwise, they take an unnecessary risk of losing potential customers. Political parties, too, should seek the center. Like a pendulum, politics swings back to the middle when governance strays too far to the extremes.",2005-11-20T05:00:00+0000

As well as the Harvard lectures, he'd agreed to a small American book tour, which was to have brought him as far as Cody's Books in Berkeley. I was to have been sitting in the front row, breathless. Instead, I learned of Calvino's death by reading a notice taped to Cody's doors, explaining the cancellation of the event, together with a clipping of the obituary I'd happened not to see.",2005-11-20T05:00:00+0000

Upon returning from service in the Navy, he attended LIU, later receiving his BA in Fine Arts from SUNY New Paltz. In the intervening years, he owned and managed a wine and liquor store in Belrose, Queens and founded and operated a printing and publishing firm, Pastoral Press, in Grahamsville, NY. He received an MA in Musicology and a PhD in Humanities from Syracuse University. His research in that period focused on Beethoven's use of humor, Wagner's Ring Cycle, and American Studies of the early-to-mid 19th century, while serving as an instructor at Utica College, Cayuga County Community College and Syracuse University. He later was an assistant professor at Augusta College, Lake Superior State University and LaSalle College. He retired from teaching in 1991 to focus on research and writing. ""Utopian Episodes: Daily Life in Experimental Colonies Dedicated to Changing the World,"" a work that grew out of research he had begun in the 1970's, was published in 1993 and is considered a seminal work on the subject. At the time of his death he was working on two further manuscripts relating to this time in history.

True genomic medicine seeks to understand both the underlying causal genes and environmental factors in order to provide more precise predictions of health outcomes, as well as more tailored and effective therapies.

Since this is chain-smoking China, men sometimes slalom with cigarettes in their mouths. Accommodations are basic at best, and the black-diamond-rated trails will bore daredevils. At least the fees are thrilling: $35 a day. And don't worry about making a fashion statement. Most visitors rent the resort's yellow snowsuits. Here are three slopes to ski.

During his all too short life Maximilian (universally known as Max) Warner LeRoy--beloved son of Kay LeRoy and precious brother to Bridget Warner LeRoy, Carolyn Plum LeRoy and Jennifer Oz LeRoy--embraced an extraordinary number of people with a singular charisma during his 30 years; a life ended by a motorcycle accident in Los Angeles on November 3rd. He was a literal, as well as figurative, embrace. Max was a hugger par excellence, a habit that started in early childhood when his parents tried to teach him how to shake hands in greeting; he preferred hugging. Visitors to the LeRoy household were routinely assaulted by a dark-haired, dark-eyed ball of energy who threw himself at them, hugging whatever body parts he could best reach. After what became his signature hug (just a little longer, just a little tighter and just a little more loving than anyone else's), Max would step back to ask the hug-ee's name. He embraced life just as ferociously and with as much abandon. And he had an enormous capacity for living, because he was so prodigiously talented. The word ""best"" always surfaced when Max was discussed by his family and friends. He was the best musician, the best writer, the best cook, the best at getting the party going, the best at getting the girls, the best son, the best brother and the best friend. Most of all, he was the best at loving those same family and friends, the latter an always increasing circle of people he embraced--literally! Without that special Max love, reinforced by that patented Max hug, the world is a colder, harsher and lonelier place for all who knew him. The solace is that Max will now always be so young, so handsome and so vital, while the rest of us will not be so lucky.",2005-11-21T05:00:00+0000

Several teams of climate researchers have concluded that 2005 will at least tie, and probably surpass, 1998 as the planet's warmest year since records began. The previous record was achieved in part because of a strong natural push from a cyclical El Nio warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean.

Mr. Toussaint said the authority had called for a greater employee contribution toward health care expenses and for a longer period of service before new workers can receive pensions. Mr. Kelly said it was too early to comment on negotiations. Sewell Chan (NYT)",2005-11-22T05:00:00+0000

Now it appears that Mr. Letterman's persistent invitations to Ms. Winfrey have paid off. Mr. Letterman was scheduled to announce during the taping of last night's show that Ms. Winfrey, right, has agreed to appear on the ""Late Show"" on Dec. 1. It will be her first appearance on Mr. Letterman's show since he moved from NBC to CBS in 1993, and her first since he famously transposed her name with that of Uma Thurman -- ""Uma, Oprah"" -- for a bit he did, to little laughter, as host of the 1995 Academy Awards telecast. Ms. Winfrey will be in New York, where Mr. Letterman tapes his program, for the premiere of the Broadway show ""The Color Purple,"" of which she is a producer.

Paul Getty Museum, left, in Los Angeles in a fresh bid to win back four ancient artifacts it says had been stolen before the museum purchased them in 1993. The culture minister, Kostas Karamanlis, said in a statement that ""orders had been given for the immediate start of legal proceedings"" against the Getty, the only American museum to face such legal action from Greece. It did not give further details. Greece first challenged the Getty nine years ago about the four objects, dating from the fourth century B.C., and renewed its efforts for their return last May. This month, the Getty returned three artifacts to Italy shortly before the opening of the criminal trial in Rome of Marion True, the museum's former antiquities curator, who is charged with conspiring to import looted antiquities. American museums with big antiquities collections, like the Getty, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, are coming under growing pressure from countries that are the source of many archaeological relics to disclose specific details of how they acquired such works and to open talks on their return.

Pirro, announced yesterday. The man, Eddie W. Cordero Sr., had previously served three years in prison for sexually abusing a 10-year-old girl, and the subsequent charges against Mr. Cordero prompted Ms. Pirro to ask the State Legislature for a civil confinement law. The measure, which passed the Senate but is stalled in the Assembly, would require sex offenders to be confined in psychiatric institutions after completing their sentences. Ms. Pirro said Mr. Cordero abducted the girl from a bus stop near her home, dragged her into a wooded area, and then repeatedly raped and sodomized her. He faces 27 years in prison.

Profit included a net gain of 419 million euros ($495 million) from the sale of a stake in Amadeus Global Distribution, a travel reservation company.

The union's three-year contract with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority expires on Dec. 15. State law already prohibits public employees from striking, but in 1999 and 2002, the city went to court to impose exorbitant fines on any employee who walked out. In both instances, a settlement was reached and no strike occurred. The new lawsuit contends that both suits violated union members' right to free speech and that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg abused his authority by filing the 2002 suit. A spokeswoman for the city's Law Department said last night that it had not seen the complaint. Sewell Chan (NYT)",2005-11-24T05:00:00+0000

Hector, Esq., an esteemed member of the Board of Trustees for twenty-five years. Louis Hector joined The Rockefeller University Council in 1977 and was elected to the Board in 1981. He became an emeritus trustee in 1991. Louis will be remembered for his generosity of spirit, wise counsel, and the enormous personal integrity that guided all aspects of his long and productive life. His enthusiasm for basic science encouraged Lucille P. Markey, one of the prominent clients of his law firm, Steel Hector & Davis, to become a benefactor of many research institutions, including this one. Following Mrs. Markey's death, he was instrumental in establishing the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust as an organization dedicated to the advancement of biomedical research. Under his chairmanship, the Markey Trust had a profound impact on the quality of scientific research in the United States, shining a bright light on the need for philanthropic investment in science and serving as a model for many foundations which followed. In 1994, The Rockefeller University recognized Louis Hector's enormous contributions to the advancement of science and medicine with an honorary doctoral degree. We will miss his keen intelligence, astute judgment, and inspiring optimism. His influence and legacy will be felt throughout the University for many years to come. We extend our condolences to his wife, Nancy; their beloved children; and the entire Hector family.

That price, which includes a 15 percent commission, was the highest ever paid at auction for a letter written by an African-American, and appears to have set an auction record for a letter written by a woman, said Jeremy Markowitz, an autograph specialist at Swann Galleries in New York, which sold it. The two-page letter is considered especially valuable because in it Wheatley talks about the American Revolution, and obliquely about slavery, and because it was written to an enslaved friend, Obour Tanner, in Newport, R.I. ""This is a happy day for those of us who love African-American literature,"" said Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the department of African and African-American studies at Harvard. ""Phillis Wheatley is the mother of the African-American literary tradition. Anything that surfaces from her is extremely valuable."" The buyer was anonymous, Mr. Markowitz said. The Wheatley letter, the only one known to exist outside the 19 in institutions in America and Britain, had been estimated to sell for $80,000 to $120,000. FELICIA R. LEE",2005-11-24T05:00:00+0000

Fifty-four paintings, including works by Czanne, Manet, Poussin and Renoir, had been on display at the Pierre Gianadda Foundation in Martigny, Switzerland, for five months before the businessman, Nessim D. Gaon, obtained a court order to have them confiscated. Mr. Gaon said the Russian government had reneged on loans made by his company, NOGA, which had grown from an original debt of $60 million to nearly $900 million, plus interest. The paintings were the latest Russian state property to be sought by Mr. Gaon, and their seizure prompted an outcry in Russia. Museum officials were concerned that the paintings, insured for more than $1 billion, might be damaged since the truck drivers had to turn over their keys, deactivating the climate control. Specialists are to inspect the paintings. A final delivery is expected tomorrow. SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY",2005-11-24T05:00:00+0000

Released in 1972, it was activist rock criticism: a fuzz-toned counterattack against overblown 1970's rock. And it worked, stimulating both punk-rock and widespread 1960's revivalism. The revival once called the Paisley Underground -- mingling garage-rock, folk-rock and power pop -- fills this collection. It mixes long-running bands (Flamin' Groovies, the Fleshtones, the Posies, Teenage Fanclub) with side projects (XTC as the Dukes of Stratosphear) and obscurities. As on ""Nuggets,"" the songs are terse and catchy, the equipment is vintage and distortion-happy, and the recording budgets sound minimal; girl trouble is still the perennial subject.

The debate over whether it should do so rages on.

Inflation in Europe is running at roughly 2.3 percent, above the bank's threshold of 2 percent. Some economists, however, forecast that it will fall back below 2 percent by next summer.

us,The Listings | Nov. 25 - Dec. 1; ORNETTE COLEMAN QUARTET AND THE BAD PLUS,"The alto saxophonist and composer Ornette Coleman, above, has updated the definitions of his music more than a few times since he first turned heads as the chief provocateur of 1960's free jazz. His latest bit of terminology, Sound Grammar, builds on the Harmolodic theory that he introduced in the early 1970s; it is a holistic ideal of improvised group communication that is easier to recognize than define. Mr. Coleman, above, has been enacting these principles lately with an excellent ensemble including two bassists (Tony Falanga and Greg Cohen) and a drummer (Denardo Coleman, his son). The quartet had its premiere at Carnegie Hall at the 2003 JVC Jazz Festival, with an uninterrupted concert-length whorl; returning to the same setting one year later, the band took the opposite tack, with discrete compositions as skeletal and scintillating as Zen haiku. Both concerts hinted at the way in which Mr. Coleman's aesthetic had gradually, and sometimes grudgingly, been absorbed by jazz's mainstream in recent years: Jazz at Lincoln Center has paid homage, and the Bad Plus, a puckishly unconventional piano trio (Ethan Iverson, pianist; Reid Anderson, bassist; and David King, drummer), has been earning standing ovations with an explosive rendition of Mr. Coleman's ""Street Woman."" The Bad Plus took part in a three-day tribute to Mr. Coleman at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis this spring, and Mr. Coleman later praised their efforts -- so it is possible that tomorrow's concert in Newark will include an intergenerational collaboration. Even if it doesn't, one suspects that, as is usually the case when Mr. Coleman performs, bridges will be crossed.

Twenty-two of these sessions are represented here, and many are sharply turned out, not particularly inspired evidence of the working life of jazz in the 50's.

Charles's pioneering 1950's recordings forged soul music from blues, jazz, country, gospel, pop and mambo. At Atlantic, the young Charles grew up fast, trading the suavity of Nat King Cole for something rawer and bluer, more cantankerous and more jubilant. He soaked up regional ideas from every place he visited; he touched down regularly in jazz and transformed any song he chose, finding sorrow and redemption. Unreleased material includes Charles toying with songs on solo piano -- it's all he needs -- and a low-fi DVD of a 1960 Newport Jazz Festival set that moves from swing-band elegance to full-tilt, house-rocking soul.

The first is that the ideal body type of movie stars and models has slimmed down so radically in the last few decades that Monroe would now be considered too well padded. The other is that Ms. Atkinson, above, is just a wonderful actress. Certainly, her heartbreaking turn opposite Jeremy Piven last year did a beautiful job of illustrating the multiple lines of defense built up by an emotionally bruised woman before the actress, devastatingly, stripped them away. Ms. Atkinson found a romantic core to the cruel world of Mr. LaBute, and for that impressive trick she was rewarded with rave reviews and nominations for the Lucille Lortel and the Outer Critics Circle awards.

The first is that the ideal body type of movie stars and models has slimmed down so radically in the last few decades that Monroe would now be considered too well padded. The other is that Ms. Atkinson is just a wonderful actress. Certainly, her heartbreaking turn opposite Jeremy Piven last year did a beautiful job of illustrating the multiple lines of defense built up by an emotionally bruised woman before the actress, devastatingly, stripped them away. Ms. Atkinson found a romantic core to the cruel world of Mr. LaBute, and for that impressive trick she was rewarded with rave reviews and nominations for the Lucille Lortel and the Outer Critics Circle awards.

A new boxed set attempts to share the spoils with a singularly un-obscure old murmurer: Donovan. Inside the purple velvety box (which also contains a brief documentary on DVD), you'll find a clue about the intended audience: there are tributes not only from Jimmy Page and Alice Cooper but also from indie rockers like James Mercer (of the Shins) and Devendra Banhart. And the three CD's include a well-pruned selection of Donovan's music, focusing on his marvelous late-60's run; only five of the songs here were recorded after 1973. Donovan was once caricatured as a symbol of 60's self-absorption run amok, but decades later his best hits (the grand ""Sunshine Superman"") and not-quite-hits (the mischievous ""Clara Clairvoyant"") make a gentle but unsettling noise: a mellow, mesmerizing collision between acute self-consciousness and its opposite.

us,The Listings | Nov. 25 - Dec. 1; PEDRO RUIZ,"Mr. Ruiz has danced everything from sleek jazz-flavored modern-dance abstractions to Columbus in his 20 years with Ballet Hispanico, which opens its 35th-anniversary season on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. He also began a choreographic career with the company, starting in 1999 with ""Guajira,"" a tribute to the hard-working rural women of his native Cuba. On Dec. 6 Ballet Hispanico will celebrate Mr. Ruiz, above, in his final season with the troupe. Mr. Ruiz came close to not having a career in dance at all. He had studied folk dance and classical ballet as a child in Havana and continued his training when the family moved to Venezuela. Then came another move, to the United States and New York. ""I was accepted at the School of American Ballet, but I had to work,"" Mr. Ruiz, who is 42, recalled. ""I found a job in an insecticide factory in New Jersey. They put me in a line, hammering plastic in a bottle. Lucille Ball in the chocolate factory? That happened to me."" A friend introduced him to Tina Ramirez, the founder and director of Ballet Hispanico, and soon he was studying at night at the company school. Dancing lead roles from the start as a company member, the Bessie Award-winning Mr. Ruiz became known for the heart-stealing warmth and subtlety of his performing. He began to think about choreographing when he worked with the Catalan modern-dance choreographer Ramn Oller in the late 1990's at Ballet Hispanico. ""He started giving me an opportunity to be spontaneous and put myself into solos,"" Mr. Ruiz said. In 1998, Ms. Ramirez saw and liked a duet he was working on and asked him for a full piece. Mr. Ruiz's dances for the company have ranged from ""Club Havana,"" a sultry, stylized ballroom piece, to ""Cecilia,"" a ballet about incest. He has also choreographed for the Luna Negra company in Chicago and will present a new work in New York in May at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center. Dancing has taught him about himself, Mr. Ruiz said. And choreography, he added, ""is a way to pass on my knowledge of my life and who I am.""

The parade of early performances is often intriguing, but it inevitably pales next to the Dorsey Orchestra material that follows. The band sounds especially vital on the third disc, an assortment of radio air checks that benefits greatly from the sterling contribution of Frank Sinatra. (Legacy has also recently issued a strong two-disc compilation, ""The Essential Frank Sinatra and Tommy Dorsey."")

Many of the songs here are familiar, some hugely so: anyone with even a passing interest in soul music has probably memorized chestnuts like Freda Payne's ""Band of Gold"" and the Supremes' ""Stop! In the Name of Love."" But these three discs spotlight not the singers but the songwriters: Eddie Holland, his younger brother Brian, and their partner Lamont Dozier, who churned out an astonishing number of Motown classics (and sang a handful, too). The three had a knack for writing buoyant melodies that only hinted at melancholy and lyrics that emphasized a particular sort of heartache: not the feeling of love's absence but the feeling of its overabundance. Part of the fun of this set is hearing that spirit echoed in recordings by such a wide variety of performers, from Dusty Springfield to Michael Jackson to the Band. The only gripe is the liner notes, which trace the trio's biographies without ever explaining how, exactly, they did what they did. Hip-O/Universal. Three CD's. $39.98.

Its principles are canonical, but anti-purist (a couple of Depression-era Hawaiian guitarists make the grade, as do Jimi Hendrix and Carlos Santana), and its process strictly egalitarian: each of the 78 guitarists included makes only one appearance, with a recording identified as somehow emblematic. This policy creates some strange imbalances, although there's a refreshing justice in John Scofield, one of the set's producers, receiving the same track allotment as, say, the obscure swing player Otto (Coco) Heimel. A glossy and informative booklet, with several solo transcriptions, underscores the package's target audience.

Unfortunately, grunge dominates, with Tad, Mudhoney and Screaming Trees crowding out hip-hop beyond novelties like ""O.P.P."" and ""They Want EFX."" Oddly, the Northwestern stalwarts Sleater-Kinney and Mudhoney are represented by second-rate songs, though the box does right by grunge knockoffs like Bush and Stone Temple Pilots. Thankfully, there are happy glimpses of postalternative quirkiness that briefly passed as mainstream pop, like the Cardigans' ""Lovefool,"" Fountains of Wayne's ""Radiation Vibe"" and Len's ""Steal My Sunshine."" But this overview may not sound like the 90's to anyone who followed electronic music beyond the Sneaker Pimps, alt-country past Wilco or hip-hop deeper than ""Whoomp! (There It Is)."" Rhino.

us,My Lives; Billy Joel,"After more than three decades, it's easy to imagine that we've experienced all of Billy Joel's moods and incarnations: Tin Pan Alley piano man, bridge-and-tunnel striver, muscular balladeer, headline historian, Broadway dance inspiration, classical dabbler. But a new sweetness emerges with ""My Lives,"" four CD's and a DVD of clips from a 1994 Frankfurt show. Starting with youthful forays into folk, British Invasion pop and jazz-rock, the set mingles demos with the hits they later became, candidly exposing clunky scrapped lyrics that accompanied budding melodicism. Even if some covers showcase Mr. Joel's taste rather than his talents (Brian Wilson works well; Bob Dylan not so much), ""My Lives"" is sequenced for listeners, not archivists. A loose-limbed live version of the goofy tough-guy proclamation ""I Go to Extremes"" finds Mr. Joel at his least chameleonic. After Disc Four's vigorous live run through hits like ""Goodnight Saigon"" and ""Movin' Out,"" you almost owe him a spin through the set's final classical numbers. Columbia. Four CD's, one DVD. 59.98. LAURA SINAGRA",2005-11-25T05:00:00+0000

us,"Bill Evans; The Complete Village Vanguard Recordings, 1961","Two great albums were picked from the recordings of these five sets during one single afternoon-into-evening at the Vanguard -- ""Sunday at the Village Vanguard"" and ""Waltz for Debby."" But if you've heard those, you will understand why you might want whatever else there might be, and in the order they really unfolded, to replicate that day. Bill Evans's chords, nearly all fascinating and unmoored by the expected root notes, motored along in muted drift. No single statement sounds complete; he's always gesturing ahead toward what's to come. His trio, with the bassist Scott LaFaro and the drummer Paul Motian, was operating at its peak: bass and drums working around and sometimes above the piano, not just beneath it; everyone melodically improvising. The set was released in Japan in 2003 and last year in Europe, but it's new to the American market. With the remastering, both the music -- particularly Mr. Motian's cymbals -- and the low crowd rumble are clearer. At one point there is a minute and 43 seconds of milling about. (""You want some ice in that?"" ""I'm gonna run out and go get something to eat."" ""I'll come with ya."") It's all of a piece. Fantasy. Three CD's. $29.98. BEN RATLIFF",2005-11-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Johnny Cash; The Legend,"The somber-voiced country singer Johnny Cash was almost a mythological figure during his lifetime; two years after his death, his legend has assumed Mount Rushmore proportions. Yet, as the biopic ""Walk the Line"" asserts, the Cash mystique had as much to do with human fallibility as with faith and redemption. That might explain why the deluxe version of this set feels so formal, despite an abundance of snapshots, testimonials and scrapbook reproductions: it captures the legend better than the man. The musical selection on both editions is unassailable, although most of it has already been thoughtfully repackaged in recent years. Previously unreleased material -- including, in the deluxe edition, an early radio broadcast and a DVD with highlights from a 1980 CBS special -- reinforces Cash's workmanlike professionalism, which is no small thing. But for a more intimate portrayal, turn to the 2003 collection ""Unearthed"" (American Recordings), which undercuts its monumentalizing tendencies with a chilling mortal clarity. Columbia/Legacy. Five CD's, one DVD and a limited-edition coffee-table book. $199.98. (Also available as just four CD's. $39.98.) NATE CHINEN",2005-11-25T05:00:00+0000

Kit was a delightful, caring person who made the world a better place in which to live. She was an avid reader, but enjoyed social interaction and had a quick wit. She could exchange jokes with the best. She was also proficient in many athletic pursuits, but the game of tennis, the skills of which she acquired as a teenager from the incomparable teachings of Dorothy Wightman, was her first love. She practiced it artfully and effectively much to the dismay of opponents, the gratitude of partners and the admiration of all. Kit also derived much pleasure from the intimate and enduring friendships she maintained with many persons from all over. These relationships were of utmost importance to her and remained at the top of her mind until the bitter end. Were she able, she would be the first among her family to thank all those dear friends for their tender condolences, for which the severity of her illness impaired direct and timely acknowledgement; likewise to express her and our gratitude to the loving and tireless caregivers who comforted her and her family during her passing.

From Fred Grandy to Sonny Bono to Schwarzenegger to Reagan, it's always the right-wing entertainers who decide they want to make policy instead of just complaining about it. That's why, although I happen to share his political bent, I'm disgusted when Rob Reiner tries to compare senatorial responsibilities with his own; making a hard decision about film locations is not the same as making a hard decision about Social Security.

Next spring the couple -- who spend roughly half of each month in the field, chasing down culinary tips -- will publish a memoir, ""Two for the Road"" (named for their monthly column in Gourmet magazine), which aims to give readers a backseat view of their continuing million-mile road trip.

He was a News Editor (1937-1945) at the Associated Press; a News Writer, News Supervisor at NBC Radio (1945-1952); Managing Editor at CBS-TV News (1952-54); Director of News and Special Events at ABC. At ABC he made the decision to carry live coverage of the ArmyMcCarthy Hearings in 1954. He supervised the entire coverage. His decision was backed by John Daly, Vice President of News and Robert Kintner, President of ABC. ABC and Dumont Television were the only networks to cover the McCarthy hearings live for 36 days. Many consider this extended live coverage a hallmark in television news. Mr. Littlejohn finished his career at the Voice of America (1967-1973) where he was Deputy to Director John Charles Daly and Head of the English Lan guage division. He was born in Pacolet, South Carolina, the son of Frank Littlejohn, who became Chief of Police in Charlotte, North Carolina and Bessie Black Littlejohn.

us,Poetry Chronicle,"STARTLE RESPONSE. By Heather Fuller. (O Books, paper, $12.) There are as many good poetry books being written as ever, but goodness gets wearisome. Fuller's third book is a relief from this, lacking the steady-handed competence, ingratiating charm and middle-aged melancholia from which much verse suffers. Despite a table of contents promising careful, cubic order -- three sections of nine parts (less one at the end) -- ""Startle Response"" is uneven, unfamiliar and charged with intensity. It wants to be new speech: ""G says jargon is like J's new language / like prisoners invent a code in other words"" a poem called ""Comic"" begins, encoding the desires that come when regular speech feels anesthetic. This quest to rescue real experience by telling it in other words is central to poetry, and erotically charged in its urge for raw experience. This can be unsettling. Over and over we're asked to steady ourselves, to recalibrate how that line got us to this one: ""when you sleep you miss / the courtesy service dream,"" Fuller writes in ""Notes on the Tarmac,"" tracking something about mobility and modernity. Prufrock's cheap retreats return as the future's anonymous motels in which the personal is the perishable. Just then, one decides ""dream"" is an imperative commanding what follows, ""the trouble of the ones / who'd slept there but / that is now your trouble."" Endlessly displacing one another in featureless rooms, we have to share nightmares, the language and displacement itself. One is always trying to catch one's balance, as if startled, as one often is amid this jagged and terrific book.",2005-11-27T05:00:00+0000

A survey of veterans, it was addressed to Henry McDaniel, a former Civil War soldier who had served in Tennessee's Twelfth United States Colored Infantry. In failing health and with a limited education, he called upon his youngest daughter, Hattie, to help fill out the form. As her father spoke, Hattie McDaniel carefully inscribed the story of her family, detailing the events of her father's life before, during, and after the Civil War. Indeed, that war had impacted both the nation and Henry McDaniel. He had returned from battle so badly injured that it would shape the rest of his life and, later, the lives of his wife and children. In many ways, although she was born almost thirty years after the conflict was over, Hattie McDaniel was a child of the Civil War. Her father's war wounds were a daily reminder of his fight for his country and against slavery and racism. On that spring day in 1915, many, many miles away from Hollywood, the town that would make her famous, Hattie McDaniel sat with her father, listening as he told her about his past and her history.

The tectonic plates had been grating against each other for millenniums, and now the higher of the two was lifted perhaps 60 feet. For a planet where landmasses are in constant motion across geological time, the event was of no great moment. But for people -- who mark the calendar in days and months rather than eons -- a monumental catastrophe had begun, not only the largest earthquake in 40 years but also the displacement of billions of tons of water, unleashing a series of mammoth waves: a tsunami. These surging mounds of water raced toward land with the speed of a jet aircraft and then slowed as they reared up to leap ashore at heights of 50 feet and higher. They were long as well as tall, stampeding inland and carrying with them all they were destroying. People caught in the waves became small ingredients in an enormous blender, bludgeoned by concrete slabs and felled trees, stabbed by jagged sheets of glass, tangled up in manacles of wire.",2005-11-27T05:00:00+0000

New Jersey Transit said last Monday that it had reached an agreement with the State of New York to be the anchor tenant of Moynihan Station, on the west side of Eighth Avenue at 33rd Street. The deal, which is expected to lead to a 99-year lease by summer that will cost the railroad about $4.8 million a year, would make New Jersey commuters the prime beneficiaries of the $818 million redevelopment of the city's main post office into a palatial train station. The station, across the avenue from Penn Station, was originally intended to serve as a new home for Amtrak. But Amtrak backed out of plans to move there and the Long Island Rail Road also chose to stay put at Penn Station. That left Moynihan Station, the pet project of Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, who died in 2003, without a railroad and in jeopardy of becoming Moynihan Mall. New Jersey Transit jumped into the void, grabbing the chance to move its Manhattan operations one block west and gain operational control over a home of its own.

Affectionately known by his friends as ""Coco,"" real estate developer, screenwriter, and former film and theater producer, died this past Wednesday, November 23. He was 71 years old and lived partly in West Palm Beach, FL, and partly in New York City, where he died at home with his family around him after a courageous battle with cancer. Mr. Brown, who came from a prominent Hollywood family--his father was the producer/director Harry Joe Brown and his mother was the screen star Sally Eilers--first made his mark in the theatrical world in the late '50s and the early '60s with original, award-winning New York productions of works by Edward Albee, Samuel Beckett, Jean Anouilh, and Tennessee Williams. In subsequent years Mr. Brown was in charge of a creative development program for Twentieth Century Fox and had an original screenplay, Duffy, produced by Columbia Pictures in 1970. Duffy was also published as a novel. Educated at Phillips Exeter Academy, Stanford, and Yale, where he graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, Mr. Brown went on to earn an master's degree at Oxford University under a Marshall Scholarship. With a keen instinct for real estate value, Mr. Brown made his first foray into development with a large and lucrative residential sub-division project called Mulholland Estates above Beverly Hills. Over the next three decades he assembled a highly eclectic portfolio of largely commercial real estate in many parts of the U.S. as well as in South America, Europe, and Canada. But Mr. Brown would undoubtedly be best remembered for his conversion of a failed housing development in the hamlet of Sagaponac, NY, into an historic showcase of architecture called The Houses of Sagaponac. With curatorial assistance from architect Richared Meier, Mr. Brown assembled thirty four of the most talented architects practicing today, both seasoned and new, to design Hampton weekend homes which were aesthetically fresh, sensibly sized, and relatively affordable, going against the current trend of affluent house design that emphasized size and strayed away from innovative design. Mr. Brown is survived by his partner Catherine Nelson Brown, his former wife Karen Dempsey, his two daughters Morgan Brown and Esme Brown, of Beverly Hills and Manhattan respectively, and a grandson, Remington Rivers. Mr. Brown was predeceased by his first wife Marcia Stillman. The family will be receiving friends at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, on Monday, November 28, 2005, from 7 to 9 pm, with a memorial service to be held at a future date.

us,Inside the List,"THEY RISE AND CURSE YOU: What is it about men and football coaches? In his 1967 poem ""The Bee,"" James Dickey caught the way ""Dead coaches live in the air . . . live / In the ear / Like fathers, and urge and urge. They want you better / Than you are. When needed, they rise and curse you they scream / When something must be saved."" These days, if you want the sound of a gruff but kindly coach in your ear, ordering you to get the lead out, you merely have to go to a bookstore, where every coach with a decent winning percentage has had his wisdom scattered between hard covers. Case in point: The new book from David Halberstam (at right), ""The Education of a Coach,"" which is No. 19 on the extended hardcover nonfiction list. ""The Education of a Coach"" lays bare the teachings of Bill Belichick, the head coach of the New England Patriots. It's a good book, even if Halberstam does, at times, make Belichick sound as if he's just stumbled out of a Hemingway novel with a head wound. (""He did the things he wanted to do the way he wanted to do them, because in any given instance it was something he had thought about for a long time, and he had decided his way was right for him."") Halberstam's book will jostle for bookstore table space this holiday with Allen Barra's ""Last Coach: A Life of Paul 'Bear' Bryant,"" Frank Fitzpatrick's ""Lion in Autumn: A Season With Joe Paterno and Penn State Football"" and Bill Bradley and Andrew Blauner's ""Coach: 25 Writers Reflect on People Who Made a Difference,"" among others. Dickey's poem gets at part of the appeal of these books.

A quiet philanthropist and active supporter of numerous charitable organizations and a prominent member of the American Cancer Society, died peacefully on November 21, 2005 with her immediate family by her side in Manhattan. She was 74 years old. She was born and raised in Philadelphia, and was the only daughter of Isaac D. and Rita K. Levy. Her father was a prominent attorney and one of the founders of CBS. She graduated from the Stevens School and continued her education at Centenary Junior College and received a degree from the New York School of Design. She met her husband, Herb, in the summer of 1946 when she was 15 and they married following his graduation from Lehigh University in June 29, 1950. Moving to New York in 1961 she later worked on two cable TV shows: ""The Book Of The Month Club"" and ""A Conversation With"", where she arranged interviews with many she counted as close friends including Grace Kelly and Gloria Steinem, as well as Coretta Scott King, Pierre Salinger, and Indira Gandhi. She was tireless in her charitable and educational fundraising efforts for many charities including the Phoenix House, Literacy Partners, and the Frank Sinatra School of Arts. She created the Ann L. Siegel Scholarships in journalism and pre medical studies at Lehigh University. Following her own diagnosis with breast cancer she focused primarily on cancer. She created and became the Chairperson for the American Cancer Society's Gift Giving Program -The Holiday Card Collection, and became a Trustee of the American Cancer Foundation. As a member of the President's Council at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center, she actively supported the Breast Cancer Research Kettering Cancer Center and also established the Ann L. Siegel Postdoctoral Fellowship. For the Memorial Sloan Kettering Diagnostic Breast Cancer Center she established three rooms, each housing its own mammography machine. In recognition of her efforts she was awarded the prestigious Alfred P.Sloane, Jr. Memorial Award. In addition to Herbert J. Siegel, her loving husband of 55 years, she is survived by her two sons, John C. Siegel, and William D. Siegel, her daughter-in-law Jane E. Siegel and her adored grandchildren, Jack and Holly Siegel.

This splendid account of the last year of World War II ranges from the Allies' failure to capture the bridge at Arnhem in mid-September 1944 to the final extinction of German resistance in May 1945. Hastings's central question about the war's final phase is not why the Allies won, but why it took the Germans, against overwhelming odds, so long to lose. ""Armageddon"" is a sequel to Hastings's ""Overlord"" (1984), which reconstructs the Normandy landings; our reviewer, James J. Sheehan, said both books display the author's ""clear, uncluttered style"" and ""absolute mastery of the technical details of combat.""",2005-11-27T05:00:00+0000

The man, Flores Gomez, 27, was arrested shortly before 6 a.m. when he drove his Mercedes-Benz into three parked cars at Broadway and 192nd Street, investigators said. Officer Johnny Diaz, who saw the collision and made the arrest, said it was clear that Mr. Gomez was drunk when he got out of his car uninjured but staggering. Officer Diaz said Mr. Gomez offered the bribe in a holding cell at the 34th Precinct, setting the amount at $10,000, then raising it to $15,000. Officer Diaz said that he refused the bribe, but that Mr. Gomez insisted, and Sgt. Joseph Kourakos was called into the holding cell, where Mr. Gomez repeated his offer. Detectives from the Internal Affairs Bureau were called in, and fitted Sergeant Kourakos with a concealed tape recorder. Investigators said Mr. Gomez was led to think his bribe would be accepted, and was recorded as he called an acquaintance, telling her to bring $15,000 to the precinct. The woman, who was not charged, arrived with neatly packed stacks of $20 and $50 bills in a grocery bag, believing the money was for bail, the police said.",2005-11-28T05:00:00+0000

The network was No. 1 on Thursday and Friday among total viewers and adults 18 to 49. And on Wednesday, its lineup -- ""Still Standing"" (8.24 million), ""Yes, Dear"" (8.46 million), ""Criminal Minds"" (12.84 million) and ""CSI: New York"" (14.28 million) -- drew more total viewers than ABC's, which relies almost exclusively on ""Lost"" (19.14 million). But the dominant ratings enjoyed by that plane crash mystery (with Matthew Fox, above) among adults 18 to 49 were strong enough to lift the network into first place on Wednesday in the demographic. On Thanksgiving, CBS broadcast new episodes of its regular Thursday schedule -- ""Survivor"" (19.41 million), ""CSI"" (25.33 million) and ""Without a Trace"" (19.58 million) -- which fared nearly as well as usual. The ""CSI"" episode, seemingly designed to torture viewers satiated by holiday dinners -- it was about a man who died after an eating competition -- was the most-watched program of the three-day period.

The festival is to announce its slate of 64 feature films today in competition for four main categories: American documentary and dramatic categories, and foreign documentaries and dramas. Geoffrey Gilmore, its director, said the festival would feature more risky films than it has recently. A number of the films ""may not play very broadly in the mainstream,"" he said in an interview. The full lineup of 120 films, to be announced in coming weeks, was chosen from 3,148 submissions, a rise from 2,613 last year, and a sign that the festival continues to attract aspiring filmmakers in a digital age. Three documentaries deal with Iraq, including one focusing on the effect of the war on returning American veterans, and another on ordinary Iraqis.

The plastic and mesh lunchboxes have lead levels that exceed state environmental packaging regulations, which raised concerns about their eventual disposal, the attorney general's office said. The executive director of the Center for Environmental Health, a nonprofit group that sued Fast Forward and other sellers of lunchboxes, said parents should not panic if their children used them. The director, Michael Green, said the amount of lead would not cause acute toxic exposure by itself, but parents should have children's blood tested during checkups because lead exposure can come from many sources. The Fast Forward label can be spotted inside the boxes. Consumers who bought them between March and September this year can return the boxes by Feb. 28, 2006, to the retailer or to Fast Forward with a refund request form available from the New York attorney general's office.",2005-11-30T05:00:00+0000

Loving husband of Harriet Newman Cohen Feinberg, and before that of Jean Dilbert Feinberg, the wife he lost in 1973, devoted father of Nancy Rheingrover (Jim), David Feinberg (Madeleine), Martha Cohen Stine (Carl), Amy Ziegelbaum (Michael), Susan Hirsch (Bruce), Patricia Epstein (Steven) and doting grandfather of Jennifer, Andrew, Gillian, Matthew, Eric, Benjamin, Ezra, Zachary, Gabriel, Sarah, Jonathan, Jacob, Oliver and Natalie, brother of Martin Feinberg and the late Evelyn and Doris, he was a man without equal in any century. Beloved by all, a brilliant physician (internist and geriatrician), he leaves this world in deep mourning. A proud graduate of Boys High School, Columbia College and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, he served as an Army doctor in the Philippine Islands at the end of World War II. A founding doctor of North Shore University Hospital and a leader in medical education, he was the Associate Director of the Department of Medicine from 1974 until 1989. He received a Federal grant to establish one of the first primary care training programs in the country. Dr. Feinberg was also Dean of Admissions at Cornell University Medical College, was involved with the medical students for many years and was honored with AOA membership. When asked by NSUH, he became the first Director of the NSUH's Center for Extended Care and Rehabilitation upon its opening and the first Chief of the Division of Geriatric Medicine at NSUH. He was a founding father of the Division of Ambulatory Care that brings home care to the frail and elderly. His commitment to the problems of vascular disease led to his establishment of the Vascular Diseases laboratory at NSUH. The CECR's Home Visit program for the elderly was created by Dr. Feinberg. He was also a leader of the American College of Physicians, where he chaired their Postgraduate Education Committee, was a leader of their Ethics Committee and served as a Regent of the College. He was honored by being named a Master of the ACP. Dr. Feinberg was the Chair of the NSUH Ethics Committee and at the time of his death, he held the rank of Professor of Clinical Medicine at NYU School of Medicine. He wrote extensively, including a medical column for Newsday and hosted a television program on Lifetime Medical Television. At the time of his death, Dr. Feinberg was teaching medical interns at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, writing articles for continuing medical education, working for the New York State Office of Professional Medical Conduct, giving his sought after medical lectures and providing counsel and comfort to all, professionally and personally. His loss to vascular disease is profound and unspeakable. We will love you and miss you forever.
