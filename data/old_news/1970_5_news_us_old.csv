us,Books of The Times,"THE triumphs in P. M. Pasinetti's latest novel are minor ones. In one passage a young man comes to the home of his girl friend, bouncy, energetic, hungry. The maid, who had once had the same job in his own home, whips up an omelette lunch for him. During the preparation and consumption of the meal, the strong affection and trust they have for each other show themselves in small gestures and half expressed phrases. They are even held by a physical though innocent bond. The render ing is perfect; another touch of color would have spoiled it, another detail would have pushed it out of shape. In another scene, the same young man, who is on his way to America, bargains with an editor for more money for the pieces he plans to write. He does so in the presence of an aging and not overly successful journalist. The young man's as surance, indifference, and cruelty bring on contrasting reactions. The editor rather likes the boy's confidence and independ ence, seeing, perhaps, something of him self in the youngster before him. The older writer stands in silent resentment, know ing he wouldn't dare behave in similar fashion, that he couldn't afford such a gesture or get away with it. It's what is not said here that counts. The unspoken mixture of frustration, admiration and un caring deviltry gives the incident a tragic force.",1970-05-02T05:00:00+0000

It is about the joys and pains of married love in New York City. Particu larly the pains. Creatively, Mr. Sondheim's lyrics are way above the rest of the show; they have a lyric suppleness, sparse, elegant vit, and range from the virtuosity of a patter song to a kind of sweetly lacon ic cynicism in a modern love song. Mr. Sond heim must be one of the most sophisticated compos ers ever to write a Broad way musical, yet the re sult is slick, clever and eclectic rather than ex citing. The conception has two difficulties. In the first place, these people are just the kind you expend hours each day trying to escape from. The second fault is a structural one. Here is a series of linked scenes, all basically similar to one an other, and it is left to the director to find a variety of pace and character, and to impose a satisfactory unity on the show. This Harold Prince has not done. The cast, apart from the lead ing man, Dean Jones, is ex cellent. I was antagonized by the slickness, the ob viousness of Company.

The mother earns some money by selling eggs, but on the other hand the father owns few horses in training. There are 30 pubs in the village, if a nun's recol lections are to be taken literally.

us,A War-Waging Computer Is Hero-Villain of 'Forbin',"EARLY in ""The Forbin Project,"" Colossus, a supercomputer that controls the United States's military defense system, goes into an unprogrammed rage and launches a missile toward the Soviet Union. The President of the United States turns to Forbin, the man who invented Colossus, and gives him a petulant look that seems to say: ""There goes the stock market . . . . the urban vote . . . . my golf game . . . .my image. You've made a fool out of me.""It's one of the appealing things about ""The Forbin Project,"" an unpretentious science fiction film with a satiric point of view, that when the world is about to blow up, the President of the United States can only bring to the occasion something akin to embarrassment.The film, which opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvous, is no ""Dr. Strangelove,"" but it's full of surprising moments of humor and intelligence, a practically perfect movie to see when you want to go to a movie and have nothing special in mind.It may also be a practically perfect movie for these times, since its villain, who may really be its hero, is a computer, roughly the size of the Astrodome, in the Rocky Mountains and so cleverly protected by electronic devices and radiation belts that it can never be disconnected, or put out of office, even when it mysteriously assumes the prerogatives of the men who made it.James Bridge's screenplay is based on D. F. Jones's novel, ""Colossus,"" published in 1967, the year before Stanley Kubrick gave us ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" which also had to do a machine so brilliant that it goes positively ape. The time of ""The Forbin Project"" is never specifically stated, but everything suggests neo-contemporary. The President, who is always rather ostentatiously accompanied by a black aide, has the hairline and profile of the late John F. Kennedy, and the rhetorical gifts of his two successors.Joseph Sargent, the director, and Stanley Chase, the producer, earlier collaborated on ""The Hell With Heroes"" (1968), but nothing in that terrible little movie suggested they were capable of a film as nicely disciplined as this.""The Forbin Project"" has a bit of a personal story, but it's never meant to obscure its real concern: How Colossus and its (his?) Soviet counterpart, Guardian, link up memory banks to blackmail the world into an era of terrifying Orwellian, machine-monitored peace. On second thought, I'm not sure it's all that terrifying, in view of the alternatives. Both the American President and the Soviet First Chairman are represented as un-imaginative political hacks, capable only of managing the news.The movie is full of marvelous, absurd dialogue ""This thing,"" says Forbin as he watches Colossus absorb information, ""is deep in finite obsolutes!"") and science fiction artifacts like TV screens, blinking warning lights, keyboards and all the other paraphernalia of places called command headquarters and situation rooms.The cast is headed by Eric Braeden (Forbin), Susan Clark (the beautiful scientist no sci-fi movie can do without) and Gordon Pinsent (the President). They take themselves seriously (as I do) which could not have been easy since most of the time they are only required to react to a mad, very photogenic machine. This must be worse than playing opposite a small child, or a dog, or a porpoise.",1970-05-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Lincoln Center Film Festival Has 'Sign of Leo',"TO be down and outor simply boredin Paris in the month of August is to face one of sanity's most awful survival tests. The weather is hot in a hopeless, dull way. The days are maddeningly alike, all Sundays. The interesting stores and shops, and the restaurants worth eating in, are closed. Friends vanish. The city is like a land locked Marie Celeste, abandoned, and the haggard tourists and those cranky Parisians who are too poor or too lazy or too venal to leave are no more substantial than ghosts. A month turns into an endless, sunlit nightmare.Eric Rohmer's first feature film, ""The Sign of Leo,"" made in 1959, is about one man's soul as it endures its own private Paris in the month of August. Pierre (Jess Hahn) is a befy good-hearted, extroverted American expatriate without a sou. Like all American expatriates who somehow are marooned in Paris in the late nineteen-forties and nineteen-fifties, Pierre has an excuse for being there. He is a composer, but he dreams his best compositions and people are always waking him up, either before he finishes anything or in such an abrupt manner that he immediately forgets what he dreamed.One such morning in June, Pierre is forced out of bed by the arrival of a telegram that informs him his aunt has died. Because the lady, who sounds rather like Charley's aunt (she has such exotic possessions as ""factories in Germany"" and ""villas in Guatemala"") was fabulously wealthy, Pierre asumes himself to be rich. Borrowing money from a friend on Paris-Match, he throws a marvelous party for his Left Bank acquaintances, only to learn later that the entire estate has gone to a cretin of a cousin.Comes August, Pierre's friends disappear. With desperate dignity, he quietly becomes the bumsleeping on river banks, eating from garbage cans  he always suspected he was.Anyone who has seen Rohmer's much later, much more complex ""My Night at Maud's"" (at the 68th Street Playhouse will probably guess correctly that Pierre's story does not end quite that simply. Rohmer has a nice, old-fashioned fondness for the de Maupassant twins, which, in 'The Sign of Leo,"" is not very satisfactory. However, just about everything else about the film is, in a small, civilized, unspctacular way.Rohmer, the former Cahiers du Cinema critic and one of the principal intelligences of the old New Wave, is now to be recognized as one of the most interesting filmmaking talents to emerge from that long-ago period. Interesting and, in the context of that time, original. For Rohmer is a comparatively classical director who makes films about people of a certain worth and moral awareness, about people who talk well and respect each other's privacy, and who have within them the vestiges of now almost forgotten, established social orders.In much the same way, Rohmer reflects these things in the manner in which he tells stories, with a civilized wit and style that come close to seeming austere. Pierre is really a bit of a bore (a major fault of the film), but he's basically decent, as are his friends, and Rohmer respects them by avoiding tricks, narnative or visual.The last third of ""The Sign of Leo"" is one of the most effective, though unhysterical, depictions of emotional breakdown ever put on film. Pierre doesn't cry, or get drunk, or have hunger visions. Instead, he loses the sole of one shoe, which he has to tie with a string, and the world around him simply becomes increasingly clear and distant, as if seen through the wrong end of a telescope.""The Sign of 'Leo,"" which was shown last night at Alice Tully Hall as part of Lincoln Center's spring film festival, is of unmistakable historical interest as the first work of the man who made ""Maud.""It is also something of a documentary record of the New Wave camaraderie that existed in 1959, and is now pretty well shattered. Look closely. There's Jean-Luc Godard, in dark glasses and, even then, shy, as one of Pierre's friends in a party scene. In another episode, the elegant, extraordinary Stephane Audran, plays (and beautifully too, haeven help me) an arrogant, franc-pinching concirge.",1970-05-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Wood's 'In Search of Gregory' Opens,"WITH ""In Search of Gregory,"" true love again eludes Julie Christie (""Darling"" 1965, ""Petulla"" 1967, etc.) and leaves her with little more than a wealthy lover and a cup of sweet despair in yet another city (Rome) near a sun-kissed sea (Mediterranean) of that warm south in whichever hemisphere, where she generally repairs to savor her sadness.She has come to Geneva for her father's fifth wedding, to renew incestuous ties with her ne'er-do-well brother, and to seek the secret Gregorya wild young American, friend of father and brother, whose free spirit has made him a legend in his own time. He loves her because he's seen her picture. She probably loves him, and throughout her visit she keeps fantasizing him, though she hasn't even seen his picture. So you can imagine her surprise when she finally goes to bed with a fellow she thinks is Gregorysoundlessly, the way they do in some great movie seductionsand she finds out afterward, when he starts talking, that he has a slight German accent and is, in fact, a medical student named Gunter.At the end she almost meets Gregory, the real Gregory, in a telephone booth in the Geneva airport, but by a series of unlikely non-coincidences Unkind Fate keeps them apart. All of which makes Unkind Fate seem rather a nitwitperfect type casting for this movie.""In Search of Gregory,"" fails not so much from the stupidity of its plot as from the dim timidity of its inventions. From the fantasy Gregory's demonstrations of personal uniqueness to Gunter-Gregory's climactic game of ""Autoball"" (a form of soccer-field pollution that looks like lacrosse played out of the back seats of little cars) every crucial incident dulls and strains, and does not excite, the imagination.It turns out, for example, that the real Gregory has a business, a garage-factory where he cans a little nothing that he labels ""Air des Alpes."" One might grant the symbolism if the cans weren't vacuum sealedso that the only reasonable interpretation is consumer fraud.Among the principal actors, John Hurt (the brother) survives the best because he is very talented and because his role allows him at least the hint of a characterization in the question of whether he's queerer for his sister or his best friend. Michael Sarrazin falls the hardest because his role allows him nothing on which to build a characterization.And Julie Christie, who is now old enough, and whose lovely mobile face is now drawn fine enough to add poignancy to her sense of wistfulness  she is being destined by her movies to pass from anticipation to nostalgia for a life that she has never been allowed to live at all.",1970-05-07T05:00:00+0000

He was down from Har vard, and he joined his father for lunch at the St. Regis. Afterwards, they spent a few hours shopping, then decided to stop for a drink at 21. They talked about this and that for a while: the son's sister's boyfriends, an old story of the father's that Es quire was about to publish. One of the restaurant's owners stopped to ask why the father didn't drop in any more. As they were leaving, a voice boomed out, calling the father. It was Hemingway. They stopped and the father talked with him for a while. The son remem bers a kindness that seemed to exist between the two men, in the resonance of the voices, in the eyes, in the echoes that moved back and forth across the tablecloth. As they parted, Hemingway said to the father, I still owe you a favor, Michael. Out on 52d Street, the son asked his father what Hemingway meant about the favor. Oh that, he said he laughed. A nice laugh. An old private joke, he said. One autumn in Paris I introduced Ernest to a girl I was with, he said. Duff Twysden. Ernest later made that book around her. You know: Lady Brett.

us,Nascent Liberal Played By Mastroianni in 'Leo',"JOHN BOORMAN'S ""Leo the Last"" begins as comedy of elegant sensibilities, ends as reasonable imitation of guerrilla theater and touches a few more bases along the way than it needs or has really earned. From ""Prufrock"" to protest; from individual alienation to community action  its themes sound, and indeed feel, like the material for a study in the dilemma of modern man. And like many such studies, ""Leo the Last"" indulges in a certain measure of intellectual opportunism.Leo (Marcello Mastroianni), living in London, the last remnant of some unspecified European aristocracy, watches through a spyglass from behind his windows the tough and vital life of the largely blackslum immediately outside his front door. Much inhibited by his own tendency to inaction and restrained by the attentions of his fiance (Billie Whitelaw) and a household full of ancien rgime servants, advisers and hangers-on, he nevertheless leans toward the slum people, especially toward the Madi family, their neighbors, and their daughter (Glenna Forster Jones).A series of crises, observed and experienced, finally enable him to break free, to champion the slum people (he discovers with horror that he is their landlord), and to fight with them in a glorious street assault against his own stately mansion.Involved as it is with the esthetics of commitment, the film's plot remains a liberal's wish-fulfillment fantasy to the endthe wicked patron becoming the good patron, the voyeur becoming the activist without ever really violating the shell of his own impotence. But some fantasies are better than others, and those in ""Leo the Last"" manage to pick up a lot of life along the way.Boorman has set his film largely in tones of black, blue and grayin everything extending from the stock of the local supermarket, to the pigeons overhead (nature's gift to the moviemaker), to the dcor of Leo's highly theatrical mansion. Because it proclaims itself theater, the film keeps discovering theatrical and cinematic sources of vitalityespecially in the streets, in the dumb-show joys and miseries of the distantly observed Madi family, and in the incredibly elaborate and often shockingly beautiful program of optics that accompanies Leo's secret life as voyeur.Also accompanying that life is a most engagingly shy and sensitive Marcello Mastroianni, in a performance of great self-effacing intelligence. Everybody around him is good, but the black family across the way, that is not even heard until near the end, is superb. Glenna Forster Jones  skinny, sexy, bright and toughwould by herself be reason for going to any movie. And Boorman seems to excel in sensing where his actors most vividly and subtly meet the characters he has in mind.Boorman, who won aknowledgeable cult following for crime in ""Point Blank"" (1967) and then lost with allegory in ""Hell in the Pacific"" (1968), should get some of it back with ""Leo the Last.""It is worth remembering that, unfashionably, he prefers big to small subjects, that he is a persistent and sometimes overbearing moralist, and that, together with Peter Suschitzky, the cinematographer, he has developed a visual technique that might be more moving if it were less dazzling. But even where he fails, and sometimes most excitingly where he seems bound to fail, in his newest movie he reveals a taste for profitable risk-taking that is a characteristic of the very best directors.",1970-05-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Festivolution Now!,"CANNES, France. IF and when the world ends, I wouldn't be at all surprised if there weren't at least two or three American movie companies willing to bid for the distri bution rights, on the outside chance that the cataclysm might turn out to be a good show, as well as something less than total. One of the most impressive things about the justended 23d Inter national Cannes Film Festival was the apparent enthusiasm of American film people to merchandise national disas ter. Sometimes this was simply a coincidence, as when Stuart Hagmann's The Strawberry Statement, a drama of campus unrest that has a brutal police riot as its climax, was shown here the day after the news came in from Kent, Ohio. Sometimes it seemed more selfconscious, more selfserving. The direc tor of Woodstock, Michael Wadleigh, a handsome young man who wears his hair in a long, Christlike bob, and his associates passed out black arm bands at the screening of their film, which they an nounced was being dedicated to the four students who were killed by U.S. troops while manifesting their oppo sition to the Vietnam and Cambodian wars. Unfortu nately, this gesture, no mat ter how sincere, followed a lot of conventional, high pressure publicity organized on behalf of the film by War ner Brothers, the distributor, and thus suggested oppor tunism, at least to members of the press corps. Warners had celebrated the film's ap pearance here by, among other things, passing out Wood stock headbands and lapel pins (the sort of things that are printed to order on 42d Street), bringing in a couple of bus loads of American students from AixenPro vence to carry antiwar ban ners in a small manifesta tion, by staging a rock con cert on the beach and by throwing a hippiestyle party that had, I'm told; a couple of the most elegant of the local couturiers working overtime.

In Eng land and in the Scandinavian countries, the creation of democratic political parties (a debt we owe the Marxists), trade unions and coopera tives all served to distribute political power to the proletariat without a violent convulsion. In Russia, the revolution occurred less because of the proletariata small group in 1917than be cause of the inflexibility of Russian institutions combined with the disaster of the war. When the Czar stumbled from power in April, 1917, it was a surprise to everyone, including Lenin.

It is a wonder fully verbal play, toying with words as if they were firecrackers, and sentences as if they were bombs. Of all his plays, I'm inclined to think What the Butler Saw is the most riotously funny. The play has its rough momentsI believe it was not its final draft at Orton's deathbut as a whole it dazzles. Joseph Hardy is to be congratu lated for the cool and classic approach of his staging, which makes this by far the most successful Orton production seen in New York. Laurence Luck inbill has just the right approach to the belea guered psychiatrist; Jan Farrand is equally comical ly adept, and Diana Davila, Lucian Scott, Tom Rosqui and Charles Murphy all Jones, pleased eight of the nine critics who reviewed it, although two had reser vations. Clive Barnes: I forget when it was that I first read Colette, but I know I instantly fell in love with her. In Miss Cald well's performance I can see just what it was that made me adore this writer. Miss Caldwell is a delight and her performance, cal culatedly and neatly stagy, is a privilege to watch. What of the play? The play starts strongly enough, but in the second act the chaos of too many succeeding years takes command. The first act sounds like a biog raphy, the second like a scurried digest. Gerald Freedman has staged the show with a sense of pe riod not impaired by a very clear sense of reverence for his subject. It is Miss Caldwell's show, but she is surrounded by an unusual ly good cast. Mildred Dun nock is marvelous as Colette's mother and Charles Siebert, Barry Bost wick and Keene Curtis also scored. As a dramatic mas terpiece, Colette,' with all its lovely virtues, does not reach first base. Yet its lovely virtues warm the heart. Dear Miss Caldwell. Dear Colette.",1970-05-17T05:00:00+0000

us,'I Am Curious (Blue)' Colors a Collage of People,"Aside from the fact that ""I Am Curious (Blue),"" which opened yesterday at the Evergreen, Cine Malibu and neighborhood theaters is decidedly less blue than ""I Am Curious (Yellow),"" it is so similar to the first that it almost seems to be the same movie, which indeed, it is.When he was making his film in 1966 and 1967, Vilgot Sjoman, the Swedish director, called it simply ""I Am Curious,"" and in its first rough cut, its running time was something more than three hours. Sjoman thereupon took the footage and edited it into the two parallel films that can be immediately distinguished only by the title parentheses, which refer to the colors of the Swedish flag.Sjoman has thus been able to indulge himself in a way denied to most movie directors, who judge every bit of exposed film to be unique and dear. If ""I Am Curious"" were nothing else (and I think it is), it would still be noteworthy in cinematic history as a stunt, one that recalls Billy Wilder's suggestion that Hollywood give an Oscar each year to the most successful wheeler-dealer.One West Coast critic, who saw both films back-to-back at the Sandrews screening room in Stockholm, has written a long and careful essay in Film Quarterly noting the schematic differences in the two. 'Yellow,"" he says, emphasizes social ills and is ""a man's film."" ""Blue,"" a woman's film, is ""more concerned with the relations between people."" It's possible to make such distinctions, but it's difficult and precious work, and I'm not at all sure it's really valid.""Because ""Yellow"" and ""Blue"" were conceived as a single film, they overlap and reiterate each other, and to discuss them as separate works is no more rewarding than seeking out the differences between the first 16 chapters of ""Women in Love"" and the last 15.As in ""Yellow,"" Sjman, who describes himself in one of ""Blue's"" many title cards, slogans and chapter headings as a ""young film director, age 42,"" is his own leading actor, playing a film director named Vilgot Sjman, who is making a movie starring Lena Nyman, age 20, with whom he is having a rather bumpy, unsatisfactory affair.Mostly through Lena, both the actress in real life and the character in the film-within-the-film, Sjman conducts a relentless, often very funny inquiry into Swedish political, social and sexual attitudes. Sjman's methods amounts to a kind of cinematic collage consisting of man-in-the-street interviews, fiction, still photographs, posters and newsreels.Not so surprisingly, smugness and hypocrisy are rampant. Nobody quite manages to practice what he preaches. One of Lena's former lovers, the man who schooled her in nonviolence, can only make love after he has beaten up his partner-to-be. Lena herself spends a lot of time trying to be unfaithful to Sjman with Borge Ahlstedt, her co-star in the film-within-the-film.In ""Yellow,"" Lena was militantly concerned on behalf of disarmament and peace. In ""Blue,"" she is concerned with women's liberation, with religion and with prison reform. As in ""Yellow,"" she exhibits a marvelous faith in the efficacy of home-made, wall posters (""Message to the Prison Board/You have stopped thinking radical"").In ""Yellow,"" it was often impossible to tell whether you were watching the main film, or the film-within. There is no such confusion in ""Blue,"" but because the differences between the frame and the interior movie are so slight, they effectively become a single, slightly mocking experience.I'm not very fond of this sort of moviemaking, which tries to disarm conventional criticism by exploiting formlessness as meaningful itself, but I like Sjoman's sense of humor and sense of humanity, and his obvious affection for Lena of the earnest, pretty face and the somewhat rotund figure that betrays every candy bar she has ever eaten. It looks like real love.",1970-05-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Last Grenade':Mercenaries in Battle While Love Blooms,"Gordon Flemyng, as director, is faced with an insuperable tactical problem in ""The Last Grenade,"" which landed with a dull thud at local houses yesterday. He is simultaneously manipulating a sanguinary vendetta between tough mercenary fighters, Stanley Baker and Alex Cord, and a sudden, improbable love affair between Mr. Baker and Honor Blackman, the general's lady. The crossfire between the battlers and the boudoir is a deadly Anglo-American standoff that would befuddle any commander as well as an attentive viewer.Sadly enough, neither the script nor the director and his athletic cast do or say anything impressive enough to justify a willing observer's wholehearted belief in the half hectic, half romantic proceedings, which were shot in good color in Hong Kong and in Spanish and London locales. The reason for all the shooting? Mr. Baker, as a former English major who has been clandestinely fighting Chinese Communists near Hong Kong, has seen Mr. Cord, an erstwhile American buddy, turn on him  for money, of courseand he is out to get him on secret orders from Whitehall. Mr. Cord, an equally wily operator, is, naturally, a hard man to get.Why Miss Blackman, the cool, willowy, seemingly happy wife of Richard Attenborough, a slight caricature of the clipped speech, reserved but appreciative general, should develop an instant passion for Mr. Baker, a gruff, insulting type she detests at first, is one of this adventure's minor mysteries. Nor is it explained completely why Mr. Baker, apparently a terminal tubercular case despite his droopy mustache, hard exterior and grim dedication to seek out and destroy his enemy, should take time out for dalliance.Mr. Cord, wearing an equally droopy mustache, unshorn locks that would not be out of place among the mod set of London's King's Road and given to such hip dialogue as ""I got some heavy bread to lay on you, man,"" appears to be somewhat of a displaced preson in the Communist-held Hong Kong hinterland. Even though most of the principals are dispatched with ""The Last Grenade,"" the end leaves a disturbing, unanswered question. Mr. Cord constantly wears a Dartmouth sweatshirt while cackling sophomorically after each kill and twirling his six-shooter, Western style. Why involve the Ivy League, which has its own problems, in Far Eastern Communist imbroglios?",1970-05-21T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Bo Widerberg's 'Raven's End',"Anders (Thommy Berggren), a remarkably patient, sensitive young man, sits in an ancient armchair, brooding. His first novel has just been rejected, although the publishers have offered encouragement. His mother is at the dining room table, torturing her hair with an antique curling iron. ""Whenever I smell burn, hair,"" says Anders, ""I know we're off to the circus."" ""It's not the animals and the music I like,"" says his mother. ""It's because we actually go.""Bo Widerberg's ""Raven's End,"" set in 1936 in the working class district of Malmo, Sweden, that gives the film its title, is not only about the 1930's but also it has a kind of 1930's literacy sensibility. It is a fine, full cinematic equivalent to those novels by young, socially conscious writers who once started their careers by writing about young, socially conscious writers trying to move out of closed environments (and who, quite often, wound up with houses in Hollywood and Gstaad).For most of ""Raven's End,"" nobody goes anywhere, not even to the circus. Finally, however, Anders, faced with a future with the pregnant girl he doesn't want to marry, and with the spectacle of his alcoholic father who knows how to smoke cigars properly but not how to pass out handbills (""Can I help it,"" asks his father, ""if I have good taste?""), abandons Raven's End for what could be a career as a novelist, and maybe even as a film director.""Raven's End,"" which opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater with Chris Marker's ""Letter From Siberia,"" was shown at the 1965 New York Film Festival and preceded the production of Widerberg's ""Elvira Madigan"" and ""Adalen 31."" It is actually the Swedish director's second feature (his first, ""The Baby Carriage,"" has not been released here), but, if we are receiving Widerberg's movies in reverse chronological order, we also are receiving them in an ascending order of excellence.Of the three Widerberg films seen in this country, ""Raven's End"" most perfectly integrates the director's exuberant lyricism and the social consciousness he wears on his sleeve.Widerberg, who was a novelist before becoming a movie director, makes movies with a novelist's appreciation for detail of time and place, character and speech. ""Raven's End"" has a completeness to it that seems almost archaic today. Throughout the film, you are aware of a world outside Raven's End, whether it is communicated by radio broadcasts from the German Olympics, or by Anders's friend fantasizing about French whores who wear fur coats in summer as well as winter coats.Widerberg also shoots his scenes with an equivalent visual thoroughness, moving from close-ups of people to long shots of places, often without cutting. The characters behave with an exasperating, touching contrariness made up of love and hate and exhaustion, and they talk well. ""A cigar,"" lectures Anders's father, ""should never be stubbed out. It should die in the ash tray, its band like a shroud, until the servants carry it away.""Berggren (who played the young officer of ""Elvira Madigan""), Keve Hjelm (his father) and Emy Storm (his mother) are all admirable.Chris Marker's ""Letters from Siberia"" is a 60-minute, documentary made by the French director of ""Joli Mai"" and ""The Koumiko Mystery"" in 1957. There are lots of shots of vast forests, broad rivers, dams, hydroelectric plants and new cities, all accompanied by English narration that is full of statistics and occasional attempts to satirize its own, rather stolid form. The whole thing looks quite safely ""authorized,"" but that doesn't make it any less interesting. I meanhow many Siberian travelogues have you seen recently?",1970-05-22T05:00:00+0000

Loafshaped and off white, it looks like a huge abandoned wedding cake, something that has been sit ting too long in the baker's window. The other night in the main dining room, which has the air of lost empire and lost tea dansants, a young, beardless waiter stared with fascination at the round head of frizzy, hippie hair on a British rock performer. The waiter simply could not re sist the temptation. Without warning he walked over and ran his fingers through the extraordinary coiffure. The musicians and the other din ers were startled but not re ally surprised. It was at that time during the festival when one was ready to believe al most anything, including the terrifying rumor that The Strawberry Statement, a serious script about youthful revolution directed with all of the nitwit devices usually found in a hairspray com mercial, was the oddson favorite to win the Palm d'Or.

You may not have been that fond of the Post, nor felt that sorry when it finally crashed on Jan. 10, 1969. I know I wasn't and didn't. But the point is that Otto Fried rich was not only fond of the maga zine that he helped to edit during its de clining years; he loved it with all his quiz zical German soul.

us,Screen: A Plastic Garden:Don Johnson Portrays 'Stanley Sweetheart',"Stanley Sweetheart, a junior at Columbia, lost his virginity at 16, wears his hair discreetly long and has the kind of trouble with girls that a liberated Henry Aldrich might have. After a very earnest campaign, he succeeds in deflowering one of Grosse Pointe's prettiest and dimmest candidates for higher education. Later, he himself is seduced by her ravenous, overweight roommate (while starring her in an underground movie called ""Masturbation""). Depending on the way you regard such things, Stanley finally hits bottom, or top, when he winds up in an East Village mnage  trois with two extremely cheerful (and flexible) Lesbians.Stanley is a role-playerbasically innocent. ""The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart"" isn't.It peers and peeks more than any average Russ Meyer movie, and it talks dirtier than just about any commercial movie that I can remember. Its camera swings and there is a lot of rock music on the soundtrack. However, like so many other places of expensive, modish, retail merchandise, it remains calculatingly bland, with no more wit or point of view than ""Search for Tomorrow,"" although it occasionally takes a reproving, almost motherly look at the dirty dishes, the piled-up garbage and empty beer cans that litter Stanley's apartment.The film, which opened yesterday at the Paris Theater, was adapted for the screen by Robert T. Westbrook from his own quite funny, reportedly semi-autobiographical novel. Although the novel was not specifically dated in time, it was apparently meant to be more or less contemporary.The novel's Stanley is not a political animal (the book makes no attempt to cover the Columbia riots of 1968), but its Stanley is facing Vietnam and, in one of Stanley's nicest, Mittyesque moments, he commits himself to non-commitment by tearing up his draft card and sending it off to his draft board with a letter that starts: ""I've been watching your ugly, stupid viciousness on TV for long enough. . . .""In spite of the fact that the movie's Stanley goes to the real-life Columbia (the film was photographed entirely in New York), there is no draft and no Vietnam. There is only a terrible feeling of dj vu about the life styles it does cover. Underground movies were funny about seven or eight years ago, and Don Johnson plays Stanley as if he were imitating Marlon Brando, who was imitable 20 years ago. Stanley's encounters with women seem not to be patterned on life as much as on movies like ""Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers."" Women rampant leave him exhausted, and exhaustion, more than anything else, is the basis of his sentimental education.Of the women in the film, two are memorable: Dianne Hull, who manages to act the role of a sweet, dull girl without ever being dull, and Holly Near, who plays a big fat girl with the unfinished facial features of an irritable 6-year-old and the sexual hungers of Catherine of Russia. The film is the first theatrical feature directed by Leonard Horn, who comes from television where, among other things, he directed segments of ""Mannix"" and ""Mission: Impossible.""

us,"Screen: 'Grasshopper,' a Rare Truth:Work by Jerry Paris at Local Theaters Jacqueline Bisset Stars in Girl's life Story","If I were to construct a vehicle for the romantic sensibility in the movies, I should avoid all the lush presences of, say, ""A Man and a Woman,"" or the misty distances of, say, ""Elvira Madigan,"" and choose instead the bright colors and clear perspectives of Jerry Paris's ""The Grasshopper,"" a film of ordinary ambitions and of limited but sometimes stunning success.""The Grasshopper,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, does not simply invoke, but actively seeks to earn its moods. And although it strikes little new ground and discovers few new combinations, it achieves a fairly rare kind of intelligence and truth in the clarity and fluidity of its style.The ad copy says it is ""the story of a beautiful girl's lifetime between the ages of 19 and 22,"" and though I wouldn't have put it quite that way, the ad copy does not lie. Christine (Jacqueline Bisset) descends from Canada upon a Los Angeles boyfriend, splits when the future (a bank job and many sound investments) seems too dull, and heads for Las Vegas. She dances in a club and, after a few adventures, marries a black former football star (Jim Brown, surely the most type-cast actor in the movies), demeans herself advancing his career, and learns she doesn't like domesticity.When her husband dies (murdered in a hood's revenge for a well-deserved beating) her decline begins in earnest. She goes from call-girl to kept woman (for Joseph Cotten), to $50 whore, to ultimate despair in which, with the help of a flying fool, she sky-writes an appropriate message (which I cannot repeat) while on the ground, young America applauds and the silent majority faints dead in its tracks.As usual among us, failure is more instructive, more complicated, and more attractive than success. Committed to the morality of each moment, Christine is never wise but also she is never wrong, and her very aimlessness (like the many non sequiturs of the plot) has a kind of shapeliness to it that justifies imprudence and even indecision on esthetic grounds.I don't think the film intends any program of maturation through hard times, but Christine at the end suggests a lovely and reckless intensity that Christine at the beginning could scarcely have imagined.As a movie, ""The Grasshopper"" lives in its visual rhythms, and I am not sure that the photographer (Sam Leavitt) and the film editor (Aaron Stell) shouldn't share major credit with the director. Nothing else really equals the handsome montage of Las Vegas shows that appears early on, but the film repeatedly transcends its own vulgarity, always survives its actors (there are no performances to speak of except for Miss Bisset's), and improves upon the conventions that keep it moving.Jacqueline Bisset looks rather like a more voluptuous Julie Christie, and her role in ""The Grasshopper"" probably owes a little to the heroines of ""Darling"" and ""Petulia."" But she seems more durable and forthright, less secretive and sensitive than Julie Christie, and better adapted to suggest, without pathos, tough luck that is more than misfortune and less than tragedy.When her movie is over, she has gotten somewhere; she really has won the knowledge for which she has lost in innocence.",1970-05-28T05:00:00+0000

""I don't have to,"" is the calm rejoinder, ""I can look at my own.""This dreadfully unfunny joke of a movie falls crashingly flat on its black-and-white face. There is certainly leeway for good, healthy amusement and a racial mouthful in a subtle, ironic satire of a new-skinned man and his adjustment to himself and the world. Yesterday's new picture literally demands that the viewer find hilarious one long, stultifying clich, smirkily encompassing every racial clich ever invented, ranging from crude and tasteless to dull. Pulling it all behind him like a rusty-wheeled train of vaudeville gags and dominating every moment of the picture, as though it were one of his well-known monologues, is Godfrey Cambridge, the comedian.Let us sincerely hope, judging by the gleeful fervor and calliope steam of his performance, that Mr. Cambridge simply got carried away and didn't realize the excruciating travesty sputtering around him and more often in his wake. How Estelle Parsons, as his wife, fell into itand maybe that's whyis another mystery. Saddest of all, and ""Watermelon Man"" is a sad occasion, is the waste of an able new director, Melvin Van Peebles.
