That's why I thought of the sheep. Mr. Drake, sketched a sheep and sent the drawings to Arts & Crafters, a three-dimensional-display house at 175 Johnson Street in Brooklyn. There, Karl Pehme made plaster molds and cast the legs and heads of the sheep in hard latex rubber. These were then assembled and painted. The sheep bodies were made of pressed paper and covered with two and a half yards of the tweed wool fabric, and each sheep was given a yoke of curly unspun yarn. Mr. Drake was pleased with the finished flock. In the beginning, I thought the animals should have been more abstract, said Mr. Drake, but Karl made them look like real sheep.

George S. Patton Jr. in charge of a tap-dancing class for tiny tots. Not knowing exactly what to do, he doesn't seem to do very much at all. The result is harmless chaos. People keep coming and going and doing ferociously cute things, but never anything that could appeal to anyone except a close relative or someone with a built-in weakness for anything ethnic whatsoever.Mr. Aldrich's strength is his weakness for the violent and the macabre (""The Dirty Dozen,"" ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" and ""Ulzana's Raid,"" among others). ""The Frisco Kid"" is neither.It's a Gene Wilder comedy of a lesser sort, about a young, nave Polish rabbi who is sent to this country in 1850 to take charge of a San Francisco congregation. The original screenplay by Michael Elias and Frank Shaw is all heart and two inches wide. There's scarcely a plot development, from the moment the rabbi is swindled out of his money on his arrival in Philadelphia, through his adventures on the open range in the company of a kind-hearted, WASP outlaw (Harrison Ford), that isn't telegraphed from the opening, pre-credit sequences. I must admit, though, that this is one of those movies in which the credits don't come on the screen until the film seems half over.I'm a great admirer of Mr. Wilder when, as in his own ""Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother"" and ""The World's Greatest Lover,"" and especially in Mel Brooks's ""Young Frankenstein,"" he plays a character of patently unjustifiable self-assurance, a fellow who's funny because of his complete absorption by the absurd. One of the great, solemnly funny sequences of all time is the ""Putting on the Ritz"" number from ""Young Frankenstein,"" when the young doctor (Mr. Wilder) and his monster-pupil (Gene Hackman) strut their stuff for the convention of Viennese alienists.Mr. Wilder has two distinct public personalities. As I heard a lady say on a Broadway bus the other day, speaking of a friend's unreliable husband, ""He's a regular Dr. Jacobs and Mr. Hyde."" So is Mr. Wilder.He's most appealing  nice  when he's being somewhat eccentric. In movies like ""Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx"" and ""The Silver Streak,"" when he attempts to represent a kind of gentle blessedness, the intelligence of the actor shows through the disguise. The characterization becomes too calculated to be appealing. One suspects the innocent creature of being, at heart, Mr. Hyde.""The Frisco Kid,"" which opens today at the Cinema One, is a movie based on a great idea that, when realized, isn't. The gimmick is exhausted in the telling of it. A Polish rabbi out West? Wow! But unless the gimmick is in some way topped, such a movie runs down hill, like this one.Mr. Ford has a somewhat easier time of it than Mr. Wilder, being required to be little more than stalwart straight-man to the star. From the evidence here, Mr. Aldrich is not most at home in the kind of lovable comedy this film wants to be. The comic timing is always a couple of beats off. Even Leo Fuchs, who was one of the great comic actors in the Yiddish theater and who has a small role at the beginning of the film, is wasted. He seems to be just another dress extra.There's no shortage of talent in ""The Frisco Kid,"" but it's the wrong talent for the wrong material.""The Frisco Kid,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains some mildly vulgar language.",1979-07-06T05:00:00+0000

Seeing a bad production, they merely thank God that no one is required to write in iambic pentameter any longer. Either way, they certainly don't say to themselves, Hey! There's a dandy little device! I could use that. When they go to a play written by one of their contemporaries, they may very well be tempted to steal a trick here, transform a gimmick there. Borrowing from competitors goes on all the time.

Its resident population or two million includes fewer than 17,000 people who are not black Africans. Nearly all are Xhosaspeaking, though English is also an official language. Extremely undeveloped and thoroughly tribal in its social structure, Transkei is surely one of the world's economic and social backwaters. But diplomatically, the new state is even more isolated from the modern world. Since 1976 no government outside South Africa has been willing to recognize Transkei, because of Pretoria's original sponsorship of it as part of its internationally condemned policy of separate development.

us,"Screen: 'The Wanderers,' a Bronx Gangs Story","""THE Wanderers"" is a hit-or-miss movie full of rambunctious triumphs, terrible gaffes, likable new players and even more vitality than it needs. Based on Richard Price's dazzling first novel, which it loots rather than adapts, the movie never attempts to tell a single story; instead, it settles for a string of boisterous vignettes, which are heaped carelessly atop one another without any consistent scheme. The movie's unflaggingly high energy level and the neon hues of Michael Chapman's cinematography are the only things that really hold it together.""The Wanderers,"" which opens today at Loews State I and other theaters, isn't a gang movie, although it has all the earmarks of one. The Wanderers are sweet, harmless high school kids united by their matching satin jackets, their spirit of fraternity and their very understandable fear of some of the bat-wielding loonies in their Bronx neighborhood. The movie introduces all this in a magical opening sequence, with an overhead shot of the gleaming skulls of the Fordham Baldies, who are hanging around outside Alexander's until a Wanderer has the bad luck to annoy them. The very funny musical accompaniment for this, the beginning of a terrific set of early-60's East Coast rock songs, is the Four Seasons' ""Walk Like a Man.""The beauty of Mr. Price's novel was its economy and thoroughness in locating the Wanderers' exact place in the world. Without venturing outside a very circumscribed environment, Mr. Price was able to suggest what these characters would aspire to once their adolescences ended, what alternatives they believed life could offer and what sorts of possibilities they were not even able to imagine. The movie, on the other hand, has a lot of trouble figuring out where the Wanderers stand.So Mr. Kaufman and Rose Kaufman, who together wrote the screenplay, introduce a few extra characters and situations to suggest what the climate is like beyond a 10-block radius of the intersection of the Grand Concourse and Fordham Road. Most prominent of these is a friendly beatnik love interest, a girl first seen carrying her guitar and a copy of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover."" The year is 1963. There is also an amazingly tasteless reference to the John F. Kennedy assassination, with a rock song played over footage of the killing, plus some uneasy attempts to demonstrate that race relations in the neighborhood are implausibly strained and friendly at the same time. These are the least successful parts of a movie that should have stayed closer to home.Home is, in this case, the growing pains of the various principals. The four chief Wanderers  the easygoing leader Richie (Ken Wahl), the group pipsqueak Joey (John Friedrich), the kindly giant Perry (Tony Ganios) and rakish Buddy (Jim Youngs, younger brother of John Savage)  are glimpsed at parties, in school, at a crazy, pointless football game, with their families and with their girlfriends. In the film's best episode, Richie and Joey get involved in a strip poker game with the nice girl they hardly know (Karen Allen) and Despie (Toni Kalem), the nagging girlfriend Richie will wind up marrying, though he is already tired of her at 17. This scene is as affecting, as sweetly played, and as delicately comic as anything the movie has to offer.Although much of ""The Wanderers"" has a spirit all its own, just as much of it derives from other works as various as ""Mean Streets,"" ""West Side Story"" and Mr. Kaufman's own version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" released last year. This last is perhaps the most out of place, as Mr. Kaufman occasionally lets the principals stray into foreign territory so he can summon up clouds of blue smoke, shadowy figures and scary electronic music.To the extent that this is meant to demonstrate how eerie and frightening the outside world seems to the characters, it's heavy-handed. To the extent that it's heavy-handed, it's peanuts compared to Mr. Kaufman's use of religious statuary. Or, for that matter, to a silly business at the end of the movie that shows Richie watching Nina go into a tiny cafe where Bob Dylan just happens to be on the stage singing ""The Times They Are A-Changin'."" Mr. Kaufman might better have thrown in an extra number by the Shirelles or Dion and left it at that.",1979-07-13T05:00:00+0000

As directed by David Giles, the version of the play is shrill and even more claustrophobic than is necessary, populated by characters whose nastiness is asserted and reasserted when it most needs to be expanded upon. Lord Olivier's Edgar is a flexible figure relative to the others. But even he fails to develop in a manner that might help focus the play.Lord Olivier's performance in the film, which opens at the D.W. Griffith today, never fails to be entertaining, nor is it lacking in charm. But it is, if anything, too charming, especially since Geraldine McEwan plays Alice, the wife with whom Edgar has been locked in battle for 25 years, as such an unrelieved shrew. Miss McEwan is giving a stage performance in front of a movie camera, which greatly magnifies its flaws, and she winds up seeming not just a poor foil but a disproportionate one.The play revolves around the interchangeable love and cruelty of these two married characters, yet Miss McEwan and Lord Olivier are very much out of step with each other. The intensity of their viciousness demands that they function as a team.Edgar's monstrousness, which propels the play as it overwhelms the last remnants of his kinder instincts, never manages to become a dominant aspect of Lord Olivier's performance. From the other characters, though, monstrousness is by no means in short supply.Janina Faye desperately overworks the coquettishness of Judith, the couple's daughter; Robert Lang turns Kurt, the man Edgar destroys, into someone whose destruction is entirely too long in coming. Miss McEwan's sniping is so repetitive that the play's final revelation  that a hatred this intense must also be love  becomes the only one it is allowed to offer.",1979-07-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Langella's Seductive 'Dracula' Adapted From Stage:Mobile Movie Theater To Play Three Boroughs,"IN making this latest trip to the screen in living  or maybe it's undead  color, ""Dracula"" has lost some blood. The movie version, which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza, is by no means lacking in stylishness; if anything, it's got style to spare. But so many of its sequences are at fever pitch, and the mood varies so drastically from episode to episode, that the pace becomes pointless, even taxing, after a while.No expense has been spared: here are all the cobwebs (for the gloomy-castle scenes) and white lace ruffles (for the love scenes) and live bats and ghoul makeup (for the scary moments) and fake-looking matte shots (to suggest Merrie Olde England, circa 1880) that money can buy. What money couldn't or didn't buy, though, was a guiding spirit that might have kept all these flights of fancy from canceling one another out. This ""Dracula"" is so recklessly flashy that it winds up seeming vague.The director, John Badham, also directed ""Saturday Night Fever,"" which makes him no stranger to sensationalism, or to staging highly overstated material with great success. ""Dracula"" sometimes achieves a similar pizazz, most notably in its moments of exaggerated courtliness and in one long chasing-vampires-in-the-graveyard interlude. Mr. Badham even manages a sedately comic dinner-party sequence, as Count Dracula is welcomed to Englandafter a long and unsightly shipwreck episode, which the movie doesn't need  by the aristocratic family he will soon be trying to destroy. Frank Langella, as the Count, is at his most entertainingly high-toned in delivering lines like, ""No thank you, I never drink . . . wine,"" or in trying to stifle his keen interest when the butler cuts his finger.Mr. Langella is still playing Dracula as the compleat ladykiller, a dashing and romantic figure who just happens to have one little kink. This works beautifully in those portions of the film that aspire to elegance, and a lot less well when Mr. Badham switches abruptly from glamour to ghoulishness. Mr. Langella creates a Dracula who's seductive rather than scary, only to have Mr. Badham periodically spice up the movie with graphic horror tricks that undermine the performance. Mr. Langella never seems like anyone who would hobnob with a drooling, white-faced zombie, like the one who provides the movie's biggest scare. Nor does he seem capable of head-twisting tricks  la ""Exorcist,"" although he's obliged to try that, too.What does he seem capable of, then? The movie hedges its bets shamelessly when it comes to Dracula lore, never explaining the vampire's habits or nutritional requirements. This reaches a bewildering crescendo in the film's final moments, which provide an ambiguous ending that is nothing but a dirty trick at the audience's expense. Does the vampire die? By all logic of the story, he does. But you never know when somebody might want to make a sequel.The Van Helsing character has been drawn more deeply into the story, to accommodate Laurence Olivier, who is supposed to be Dutch but sounds much as he did in ""Marathon Man"" and ""The Boys From Brazil."" Lord Olivier and Mr. Langella meet primarily for action scenes, which are the forte of neither. Lord Olivier has some delightful moments with Donald Pleasence, though, as each plays the father of a beautiful young woman with nasty-looking puncture marks on her neck.The first of these, Van Helsing's daughter Mina (Jan Francis), serves primarily to keep Mr. Langella from going hungry and to draw Lord Olivier into the story. The second, Miss Lucy (Kate Nelligan), becomes the woman Dracula loves. The scene in which he seduces her, which ought to be the erotic high point of a movie with considerable erotic pretensions, is proceeding along steamily until Mr. Badham interrupts it with an amazingly ill-advised special-effects sequence, full of abstract shapes in a stark red-and-black scheme.This is on an overwrought par with all the cobwebs, dry ice, loony-bin scenes and yellowish landscapes Mr. Badham also supplies, in an attempt to leave absolutely nothing to the viewer's imagination. Yet ""Dracula"" is a story that remains most eloquent at its sparest, and that surely didn't need to be overtold.One of the most impressive things about ""Dracula"" is its soundtrack. John Williams has contributed yet another ravishing score.",1979-07-13T05:00:00+0000

Today, however, Wright's professional progeny has far less cause to sneer. In recent years, a hybrid has emerged, the interior designer, who addresses the problems of interior architecture and tackles decoration as well. Interior designers are serious modernists, as concerned with form, light and space as any architect. Yet they are schooled in the elements of decoration  color, texture, fabric and furniture  to an extent most architects are not. When I was in school, it was sufficient to know that a room needed a chair, says Daniel Goldner, the architect who renovated and furnished the Manhattan apartment shown on the preceding pages.

Translated by Michael Glenny. 220 pp. New York: Simon and Schuster. $9.95. writer's idea of hell, yet generations of Soviet writers have drawn a kind of strength from it. This hell has bred a tradition of fierce humanism and hard selfreliance, which treats the act of writing not only as an act of moral survival but also as a form of testimony. The deskdrawer writer writes with his life, as Mr. Vladimov made clear two years ago in his scathing letter of resignation to the Soviet Writers Union. Faithful Ruslan is the story of a guard dog at a Siberian prison camp. It begins in that ambiguous dawn of the mid1950's, when, on Nikita Khrushchev's order, the camps were being emptied of their countless thousands of prisoners. The book opens in the silence of the empty camp, the prisoners gone, the gates swung ominously open. Ruslan is bewildered, afraid he has stopped understanding, which is dogtalk for a senile spooking of the mind, leading inexorably to a bullet in the head. For the camp code is all that Ruslan has ever known, having been trained for it by the ingenious cruelty of his masters. To him, the prisoners are shabby, halfstarved creatures, capable of unspeakable betrayal. The masters, with their godlike eyes and automatic rifles, punish unerringly, but also caress and give food. From them Ruslan has learned the bliss of obedience. He knows that to obey is to belong to the gods, whom he loves.",1979-07-15T05:00:00+0000

The score itself had its own integrity and had to be studied in a vacuum, as if its author were anonymous. Life and art, for the most extreme of these writers, never did intersect, except on some higher geometrical plane beyond human hope of comprehension. On one side of the line was the composer, with his personal problems, his sorrows and his joys; on the other, the music he produced, separate and unrelated. This notion of a mystic division between the work and the worker was best summed up in Stravinsky's famous words, which he copyrighted in 1961: I am the vessel through which Le Sacre passed.",1979-07-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Diane Kurys 'Peppermint Soda':The Cast,"The only thing more impressive than the wit and talent Diane Kurys demonstrates in her writing and direction of ""Peppermint Soda""  an expert, utterly charming movie that miraculously happens to be her first  is Miss Kurys's memory. Here is a letter-perfect recollection of what it's like to be a 13-year-old, in this case a French schoolgirl, with skinny legs and a bossy sister and a mother who doesn't understand she may be ruining her' daughter's life if she keeps on refusing to let the kid wear stockings.Miss Kurys presents details like these, and enough others to span an entire school year, with a flawless understanding of how the events most earth-shattering to a girl in her early teens can mean not a fig to anyone around her. The movie's most memorable quality is its flair for taking things absolutely seriously while never forgetting to take them lightly, too.""Peppermint Soda"" has the form of a scrapbook, giving separate and even-handed attention to the various events that mark the heroine's and her sister's 1963-64 school year. Miss Kurys, who was herself 13 at that time, has her own little Antoinette Doinel in the character of Anne Weber, played beautifully by the lovely and solemn Eleonore Klarwein. In fact, Miss Kurys is about to start work on a second Anne Weber film, also named for a sort of beverage: ""Molotov Cocktail,"" about Anne and, presumably, her politics in 1968.In 1963, the issues Anne finds most absorbing revolve around fights with her sister, life at a girls' school and her parents' divorce; everything else is so peripheral that Miss Kurys turns each school vacation into a series of cursory  though wonderfully revealing  snapshots. Her older sister, Frederique (Odile Michel), has a boyfriend, whose letters Anne routinely steams open. The math teacher is afraid of her students. The gym teacher wears a fur coat while the girls are outdoors in shorts. The art teacher is a sadistic old bat who picks on her students as they sketch a little statuette of Bambi.One of Frederique's friends, more precocious than the others, is privately but unmistakably in love. Anne is sullen to her mother's boyfriend, but just as sullen to her own father when he comes to visit. Frederique's best friend deserts her, and she suffers and mourns and then finds a better one. Anne, usually estranged from Frederique, grows suddenly loyal during this calamity. Miss Kurys illustrates this as delicately as she illustrates anything else, and as marvelously matter-of-factly. You can tell Anne's sympathies have changed simply by watching the way she sits listening to a conversation in the schoolyard.""Peppermint Soda,"" which opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse, formerly the Playboy Theater, takes its title from a grown-up drink Anne orders in a cafe. Before she can touch it, Frederique barges in and threatens to tattle to the girls' preoccupied, intermittently strict and sometimes unexpectedly fond mother. The French title, ""Diabolo Menthe,"" perhaps does a better job of evoking Anne's slender efforts to live dangerously. By either name, though, the movie is handsomely crafted yet also sweet and buoyant in its innocence  a first film likely to leave audiences eager to see Miss Kurys's second.""Peppermint Soda,"" which is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a few references to adolescent sexuality.",1979-07-15T05:00:00+0000

The night last month that Billy Martin returned as manager and Bob Lemon suddenly found himself kicked upstairs to be the general manager, the Yankees lost again.

Federal regulators do appear to have resolved the specific problem that caused an American Airlines DC10 to crash in Chicago on May 25, incurring more deaths than any other air disaster in this country. But the episode has also raised more general safety issues that have not yet been resolved. The immediate goal of the investigation  the most thorough in two decades  was to pinpoint the reason for the crash and prevent it from happening again. Investigators concluded that improper handling during maintenance caused a bad crack in an enginemount. As the illfated plane lifted off the ground, the left engine and its mount ripped away from the wing, the slats on the wing's leading edge retracted and lost lifting power and the plane rolled to the left and crashed. Warning devices that might have alerted the pilot to take corrective action were knocked out when the engine broke away.

She believed then, as she does now, that the best defense against high meat prices is not a boycott or a protest, but a wellinformed consumer. Last year, each American consumed more than 137 pounds of meat  84 pounds of that in beef, 49 in pork products, such as hams, sausages, pork chops and roasts.

us,"Film: 'Breaking Away,' a Classic Sleeper:Back Home in Indiana","""BREAKING AWAY"" was made in Bloomington, Ind., which is perhaps the film world's equivalent of left field. For that and other reasons, it's a classic sleeper. The cast is unknown, the director has a spotty history, and the basic premise falls into this year's most hackneyed category (unknown boxer/bowler/jogger hopes to become sports hero). Even so, the finished product is wonderful. Here is a movie so fresh and funny it didn't even need a big budget or a pedigree.""Breaking Away,"" which opens today at the Coronet and other theaters, has a sense of place that goes hand in hand with its sense of humor. In Bloomington, on the outskirts of Indiana University, four boys endure the confusion of being nonstudents  and pariahs of a sort  in a college town. The college kids, who seem privileged and carefree, instill the Bloomington boys with both an uneasy class-consciousness and a feeling that life is passing them by. As Mike (Dennis Quaid), the angriest of the four, remarks bitterly, ""These college kids out here, they're never gonna get old. There'll always be new ones coming along.""While his father (Paul Dooley, who gives a fabulous supporting performance) sells used cars with names like Magna Cum Laude and Varsity Squad, Dave (Dennis Christopher) indulges in a form of escapism that's both hilarious and touching. Dave is a first-rate bicycle racer, which makes him an outsider in another way: the really topnotch bicyclists, the royalty who occasionally deign to visit Bloomington, are Italians. Dave, who is nothing if not enterprising, sees no choice but to try to become Italian too.So he sings operatic arias as he rides, and feeds his cat out of a Cinzano ashtray. He uses Neapolitan Sunset cologne. He drives his father wild by crying ""Ciao,"" and by conspiring with his mother (Barbara Barrie) to insinuate foreign dishes  ""all them '-ini' foods, zucchini and linguini and fettucine,"" Mr. Dooley shrieks  into the family's french fry-based diet. Mr. Dooley is finally driven to take out his frustrations on the family cat, whom he warns ""Your name is Jake, not Fellini!""The proof of Dave's success in transforming himself comes when he starts serenading a pretty college girl named Katherine (Robyn Douglass), who falls for the act, perhaps because she loves being called Caterine. But, much to the movie's credit, it follows Dave beyond these endearingly transparent efforts. In fact, it even passes the point at which he realizes that escaping his status as a town kid  ""cutters,"" they're calledwill require something more strenuous than whimsy. Halfway through the movie, the cutters begin in earnest to carve out an identity they can be proud of. They pit themselves against the college boys, who are snobs, not fighters, and want a sporting contest, not a dangerous one. The movie culminates in a bike race that left at least one screening-room audience cheering. Screening-room crowds don't ordinarily cheer.The cutters, who make very convincing misfits, are played by a well-chosen ensemble including Mr. Christopher, Mr. Quaid (Randy Quaid's younger brother, though he bears more resemblance to Jan-Michael Vincent), Daniel Stern and Jackie Earle Haley. Mr. Stern's scarecrow manner and offbeat comic timing work very nicely here, as does Mr. Haley's almost dwarfish physical presence. Mr. Haley, who played the little blond androgyne in ""The Day of the Locust"" and then the most unmistakable juvenile delinquent among the Bad News Bears, has grown into an odd actor and a gifted one too.Peter Yates, the director, has been euphemistically remembered as the director of ""Bullitt"" while he turned out more questionable offerings, such as ""For Pete's Sake"" and ""The Deep"" and ""Mother, Jugs and Speed."" This time, to anyone who said it couldn't be done, Mr. Yates can say ""Hah!"" and point to a subtle and imaginative success. Much of the credit undoubtedly also goes to the screenwriter, Steve Tesich, whose keen feeling for Americana belies his childhood overseas. But perhaps his background accounts for why Mr. Tesich, who spent his first 13 years in Yugoslavia and is now 35, can render both the Middle Western settings and the boys' feeling sense of themselves as outsiders so beautifully.As enjoyable as those scenes centering on the young actors are, it's always a pleasure to get back to Mr. Dooley and Miss Barrie, who are at the comic heart of the story, reflecting those aspects of Indiana life that seem most incapable of changing  and yet, by the end of the story, do give way. Midway through the movie, they have a particularly memorable love scene, in which Miss Barrie attempts to seduce her husband with her own wiles plus the Italian music he professes to hate.All of this, not to mention a good dinner, goes to Mr. Dooley's head. And he is charmed beyond all reason when Miss Barrie removes the flower she's put in her hair. In response, he tempestuously rips the plastic pencil case out of his breast pocket. He doesn't know it, but this is the first sign that he'll be eating pizza by the end of the story.""Breaking Away"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains one fight scene, not a violent one, and a few mild obscenities.",1979-07-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Comedy Vehicle For Laura Antonelli:Bette Davis in New TV Movie,"""TILL Marriage Do Us Part"" is a five-year-old Italian comedy predicated on Laura Antonelli's delectability and her way of crying ""No! No!"" when ""Si! Si!"" is what she means. The plot, designed to make comic use of Miss Antonelli's mock passivity while also exploiting her statuesque frame, has her playing a convent-bred virgin who accidentally manages to marry her own brother.Just as they are about to consummate the marriage  which will presumably take some doing, because Miss Antonelli plays things very, very dumba telegram arrives. It advises the bridgroom to open a certain bureau drawer, in which he will find a letter from his father revealing the bad news, but the drawer is jammed. So he calls for a hammer and chisel. ""The bridegroom needs a hammer and chisel!"" everybody cries. The movie's jokes tend to be very broad.Fighting what is, of course, a losing battle to preserve her virtue, Miss Antonelli spends her time either swooning or trying to look forbidding. Because everyone knows what's ailing her, and since she in any case couldn't scare a fly, she doesn't scare the chauffeur. He eventually proves most helpful.The resolution of their flirtation is a long while off, though, because Miss Antonelli winds up teasing this poor fellow almost as relentlessly as she teases the audience. The movie, while periodically robbing the leading lady of her turn-of-the-century clothing, steers clear of graphic sex scenes, preferring to keep the actress's allure mysterious. And that's wise: Miss Antonelli is so richly suggestive that she promises things no mere flesh-and-blood creature could deliver.""Till Marriage Do Us Part,"" which opens today at the Plaza, may be dated, but it's still one of Miss Antonelli's later films, made after she had established herself as an Italian star. So it's designed primarily as a vehicle for her, and a funny, relatively classy vehicle at that. Should her earliest films begin to be distributed here, they may turn out to be a lot less distinguished. In cinematic terms, mind you, not even this one amounts to a very large hill of beans. But ""Till Marriage Do Us Part,"" which begins with a sepia montage of old-fashioned pornographic post cards, makes no bones about its limited aspirations.The director, Luigi Comenici, throws in occasional bits of historical perspective  the time span is 1908-20  and makes funny use of the poet D'Annunzio. But he also throws in a brief and completely gratuitous lesbian love scene, not to mention one glimpse of Miss Antonelli taking a bath standing up. Real people are much less likely than sex-movie bombshells to bathe this way.The official biography of Miss Antonelli states that she started off as a gym teacher. If that's true, then quick, everybody into the pool!",1979-07-20T05:00:00+0000

Kirk Douglas plays the Road Runner role, as he falls off cliffs or lights the wrong end of the dynamite or glues himself to the railroad tracks, in a series of futile efforts to catch Ann-Margret and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who play the good guys.Catching Ann-Margret, who is done up in Bob Mackie's idea of what Daisy Mae might wear to a formal barbecue, seems like a fine idea. As for Mr. Schwarzenegger, he's more of a weight on the movie than even he might be able to lift. Ann-Margret makes some game attempts to play comedy scenes with him, but she might have had better luck trading smart remarks with the prairie dogs.Hal Needham, who directed ""The Villain,"" is the former stuntman  with 42 broken bones to prove it, the production notes say  who directed ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Hooper,"" both starring Burt Reynolds. A caricature of Mr. Reynolds turns up on a wall somewhere, and the names of the producers appear on prominently placed signposts. As in-jokes, perhaps these are funny enough to the family members of everyone involved. But they're a waste of energy in a movie that needed out-jokes much more desperately.Mr. Douglas does a lot of stunts, some of them reasonably good; these seem to be the would-be comic backbone of a movie that's not after laughs but heehaws, which in any case it doesn't get. Mr. Douglas's horse does stunts, too. The cleverest thing the horse can do is sit down on cue.The film opens today at Loews State 2 and other theaters.""The Villain"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance suggested"").

It is a question that he must, like any poet, have asked himself repeatedly during a lifetime of writing. No simple answer to it can be had; but tantalizing clues emerge from this collection covering 50 years. One of the earliest lyrics, Change, speaks of man as Dissolving in the chemic vat/ Of time . . ./ Becoming, never being, till/ Becoming is being still. The deep pun that reverberates in the last word expresses the paradox of identity somehow persisting amid flux. One of the latest poems, The Layers, surveys this philosophic idea in its most personal aspect: I have walked through many lives,/ some of them my own, / and I am not who I was,/ though some principle of being/ abides ... .  The Roem ends, I am not done with my changes. The self is protean, plastic, and the successful poem is one that glimpses the hidden order governing its transformations.",1979-07-22T05:00:00+0000

Within five years he had prospered so well that he built a theater at the corner of Mercer and Bleecker Streets on a site called The African Grove. This was much farther uptown, in what later became known as Greenwich Village which was by then, New York's chief black neighborhood. The theater held between 300 and 400 seats and was usually packed on the weekends. And what sort of entertainments did Mr. Brown put on? Well, there was an occasional vaudeville (that is, any play of a light or satiric nature) as well as antislavery classics of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as Oroonoko and Pizarro. But The African Grove's primary attraction  indeed, what made the theater famous  was its productions of Shakespeare, notably Richard III",1979-07-22T05:00:00+0000

Other people, whose attitude toward sea turtles is sharply commercial, are less admirable. In one of the most moving scenes in the book, .Mr. Rudloe confronts a group of Floridapanhandle fishermen who are crassly butchering a 780pound leatherback turtle  an endangered species. Mr. Rudloe rescues the animal's heart and returns it respectfully to the Gulf waters, and then ponders why he didn't turn the fishermen in for committing a Federal crime.",1979-07-22T05:00:00+0000

(Why Not!)"" which opens at the Paris Theater today, are occasionally seen in bed together, but their arrangement apparently has little to do with sex. The sight of these characters asleep as a group  peaceful, carnal and comfortable  merely suggests that theirs is a stable household, in spite of all the vicissitudes the movie sees them through. The movie is by no means as continuous or satisfying as the characters' design for living is supposed to be. But it has its share of warmth, and offers a few amusing glimpses of the bohemian frontier, or what's left of it these days.If ""Pourquoi Pas!"" has any particular point to make, it's that nonconformity isn't what it used to be. Fernand (Sami Frey), Louis (Mario Gonzalez) and Alexa (Christine Murillo) may be a bit more daring than the bourgeois husband Alexa ran away from, or the wife who won't let Fernand see his children because of his bisexuality. But they have the same chores to attend to as anyone else might, and much of the film's interest lies in the tiny details of their communal plan.Fernand is the tidy one, the one in charge of getting the vacuum cleaner fixed. Alexa brings home the bacon, so to speak; she has a job reading to a bedridden woman who, unfortunately, likes to hear the same book over and over again. Louis's contribution is less apparent, and he's a more weakly drawn character than the other two. This is a curiously uneven film, vivid one moment and terribly sketchy the next.The writer and director, Coline Serreau, has a much easier time staging individual episodes than she does in stringing a story together; the film is almost amateurish in its timing, with an abruptness that clashes with the disarmingly offhanded performances of Miss Murillo and the glamorous Mr. Frey. Another discordant note comes from Mr. Gonzalez's more feverish acting, as he plays a character with a family history of madness that is explained awkwardly and confusingly. Miss Serreau's script incorporates a lot more tangential information  like a tiny subplot about Louis's mother  than her film can easily encompass.Midway through the story, the film introduces pretty, very nave and relatively straitlaced Sylvie (Nicole Jamet), whom Fernand tries to incorporate into the menage. Her presence is appealing but somehow airy, insofar as it neither disrupts nor enhances the domestic arrangement. Like the movie; she seems pleasant, often interesting, capable of great tenderness and yet not as involving one might hope her to be.",1979-07-23T05:00:00+0000

He communicates with his formerly happy family in monosyllables, and spends too much time sharpening his ax. One night, Kathleen Lutz  played by Margot Kidder, who stubbornly remains the bright-eyed life of the party in ""The Amityville Horror,"" despite signs that plenty is amiss  finds George sitting in the livingroom alone. He is screaming that he is about to crack up, and he has fresh toothmarks on his legs. Kathleen studies the situation, then asks sweetly, ""Honey, are you O.K.?""There isn't nearly enough of this sort of inadvertent merriment in ""The Amityville Horror,"" which isn't horrifying enough to do without a few laughs. Still, so many horror-movie clichs have been assembled under the roof of a single haunted house that the effect is sometimes mind-bogglingly messy. There is apparently very little to which the director, Stuart Rosenberg, will not resort. But he still can't come up with anything more hair-raising than the trick of having one Lutz experience a severe start when he or she doesn't realize other Lutzes are in the room. Whenever Mr. Rosenberg stumbles upon an idea as good as this one, he's bound to repeat it over and over again.Scary things do happen in the movie, but they're always telegraphed in advance and make too little sense to have a cumulative effect. The Lutzes, you see, have moved into a house where a man murdered his entire family a year earlier, and the house doesn't want the Lutzes around. ""Get out!"" the house cries. The house works in very literal ways.It also causes members of the clergy to vomit whenever they visit the place, and has toilets that spew forth black goo. So much for the niceties. There are also mechanical difficulties, like a telephone that severs the connection every time Kathleen tries to call her priest, played by Rod Steiger. Mr. Steiger bellows and weeps and overdoes absolutely everything. He won't even pick up the phone before it's rung 12 or 15 times.However  such is the logic of this story  the clock radio always works perfectly. And whenever it reads 3:15 A.M. something terrible happens. Eventually, it turns out that the house's problem is in the basement, and that behind the basement wall are the gates of hell. This will come as a great surprise to any fans of ""The Sentinel,"" a movie of several years ago that definitively located the gates of hell on the top floor of a Brooklyn Heights brownstone, guarded by John Carradine, Burgess Meredith and Sylvia Miles.""The Amityville Horror"" opens today at the Cinerama and other theaters. It was also screened at the Museum of Modern Art on Tuesday, to introduce the museum's tribute to the movies made by American International Pictures. The A.I.P. festival will include ""The Amityville Horror,"" but it's too lifeless to be on a par with the fast, funny, deliberatly slapdash movies that have made A.I.P. such a B-movie bastion.

Late last year, he and two partners opened Claude's on Lexington Avenue, a venture that was shortlived primarily because of a clash of personalities.

us,Screen: 'Nighthawks':Documentary Tone,"""NIGHTHAWKS"" is so realistic, or at least so intimately close to its main character, that it has the feeling of a documentary. A London schoolteacher named Jim (Ken Robertson) is seen cruising homosexual bars by night and at work in the daytime, with the camera watching him almost as impartially and guardedly as he seems to be watching the world. The camera works so passively, in fact, that it never establishes anything about Jim directly. And since Jim is quite taciturn, ""Nighthawks,"" which opens at Quad 1 today, sometimes suffers from a dearth of information. But the character is intriguing and well-played, a fellow about whom one would want to know more. And the film, though it's overlong and aimless at times, presents a vivid if mysterious portrait.Certain things can be deduced about Jim from his tendency to choose elusive younger men, from his impenetrable politeness, from the tiny differences between his behavior in homosexual surroundings and his manner at work. He makes no attempt to conceal his homosexuality from his colleagues, nor does he announce it; consequently, a lot of them assume he is heterosexual. There's a very delicate scene in the film between Jim and a woman co-worker who has become his friend, an unhappily married woman who seems to have designs on him. She complains about domestic life with her husband, and Jim talks about his difficulties in living with anyone, too.Jim avoids pronouns for a while, but when he finally refers to a lover as ""he,"" the woman can barely control her disappointment and surprise. But control it she does, because she doesn't want to jeopardize a good friendship. Meanwhile, Jim does the kindest possible thing by staring into his drink to give her time to compose herself.The only other episode that stands out from the film's deliberate pattern of repetition is the moment when a few budding juvenile delinquents in Jim's class taunt him with rumors that he is a homosexual. Jim handles this beautifully, explaining matter-of-factly that the rumors are true and answering a patient ""No"" each time they ask whether he wears women's dresses or carries a purse. Ron Peck and Paul Hallam, who collaborated on writing, producing and directing the film, almost make the episode look like cinema vrit, and in fact much of the kids' rude catcalling becomes a jumble of noise. So Jim's evenness stands out all the more, as the one constant element in a heated, chaotic scene.There surely must be more to Jim than meets the eye, or than Mr. Hallam and Mr. Peck bother to explain. In the interests of depicting London's homosexual nightlife honestly and accurately, they've short-changed the character to a certain degree, generalizing his experience more than they needed to. They have also sacrificed any shapeliness the film might have had to this same desire for verisimilitude. Still, ""Nighthawks"" is gentle and believable, and Mr. Robertson gives a performance that's as touching and consistent as the circumstances allow.",1979-07-27T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Just You and Me, Kid':Nice, Nice, Nice","BROOKE SHIELDS plays a foster child nobody wants in ""Just You and Me, Kid,"" a movie with a sense of reality that is, at best, a little dim. George Burns finds her in the trunk of his car, where she is dressed in nothing but an inner tube, looking too coquettish for a film as clean-cut and cheery as this one means to be. Her involvement in a drug deal and her habit of swearing don't add anything to the fairy-tale atmosphere, either. But by the end of the movie she does give Mr. Burns a new lease on life, which is the second most important thing he needs here. The first is a script full of jokes. A very few mild chuckles are all this screenplay has to offer.""Just You and Me, Kid""  which opens today at Loews State and other theaters  is utterly benign, less like a movie than like a warm bath. There are no strong sentiments except nice ones, nothing unpleasant to look at. Not a chair is out of place in the overdecorated, expensive, brightly colored house where Mr. Burns is supposed to live. When a villain knocks down a frosted-glass door in one scene, the door is magically intact a moment later.This house, carefully geared to the character's vaudeville history, has an alarm clock that wakes him with the sound of applause and later in the day plays ""Swanee."" The ingenuity and efficiency of the place are meant to testify to this old fellow's unimpaired competence, to take the sting out of the aging process. The effect of this is so antiseptic that a relatively hard-edged subplot, involving Mr. Burns's daughter (Lorraine Gary) and her attempts to have him declared senile, is nasty but welcome. And anyway, Miss Gary is a much better sparring partner for Mr. Burns than Miss Shields is.Goodness knows, Mr. Burns can go it alone; he seems more at ease when talking or singing or dancing a soft-shoe by himself than he does in anyone's company. In fact, by teaming him with Miss Shields the film effec-tively bogs him down. She can't match his wit, or even converse with him comfortably. She can only look pretty, admire his geriatric spunk and give off a sentimental glow. Mr. Burns doesn't benefit from being enshrined in this way.Ray Bolger turns up briefly as one of Mr. Burns's old vaudeville pals, and John Schuck and Andrea Howard play the couple next door who spy on him and alway wear matching outfits. Burl Ives has the film's most dismal chore, that of making a miracle recovery from catatonia thanks entirely to the kindly advice of Mr. Burns's young friend, who in a movie of this sort is bound to be wise beyond her years.""Just You and Me, Kid"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") because of some of Miss Shields's language.",1979-07-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Len Cariou Stars in 'One Man':Crusading Newscaster,"THERE may be a good performance by Len Cariou buried in ""One Man,"" but this is such a poorly made movie that it's hard to tell. When the director, Robin Spry, wants to show two characters conducting a conversation, he cuts so often that no one sentence ever seems to have been completed in a single take. The shots seldom match. The locations are sometimes confusing. Too often, all one sees of Mr. Cariou is the back of his head.Mr. Cariou's success in ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway, and certain plot resemblances between ""One Man"" and ""The China Syndrome,"" are enough to explain why this slightly dated Canadian film is now being released; it opens at the Sutton Theater today. In addition, this is obviously a well-intentioned effort, seriously concerned with the effects of environmental pollution. But its story is predictable, and its characters disagreeable, and in any case good motives don't guarantee a good movie.Mr. Cariou plays, a television newscaster, and though he's supposed to seem a crusading man of conscience by the film's end, he comes across as an ambulance-chaser much of the time. He finds out about the leakage of chemicals that have poisoned children and realizes that a very large factory in the area is to blame. The factory wants him to keep quiet about this and threats are made against his family. Meanwhile, he has a love affair with the whiny girl who first alerted him to the story and this upsets his whiny wife. These two women seem like too much for any man to put up with. Certainly they're too much for the movie.In a heated confrontation, set in the vegetable department of the supermarket, the wife screams that she knows her husband has been unfaithful. She embraces him, then draws away, maintaining that he smells like his mistress. Since this drama is staged right beside the onion counter, it's impressive in its way, if only on account of the wife's formidable nose.""One Man"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains some strong language and a plot involving extramarital sex.",1979-07-27T05:00:00+0000

Nineteenthcentury anthropology, with its concern for primitive sexual promiscuity, incest, infanticide and marriage by abduction, often reads like a contreroman to Victorian propriety. Twentiethcentury anthropology, with its emphasis on intensive field work, has tended to be more cautious, but the old generalizations, now in scientific disguise, have still taken hold from time to time. Early on, anthropologists traced all culture to ancient Egypt; Geoffrey Gorer traced the Russian temperament to the custom of swaddling; the new sociobiologists look to genes to explain man's aggression, imperialism and possessiveness.",1979-07-29T05:00:00+0000
