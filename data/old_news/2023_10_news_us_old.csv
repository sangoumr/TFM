Even white pigment, which has frequently appeared in Martinezs pieces since his 2018 White Out series, has a charged presence, boldly countering a base painting or washed thinly across the canvas so that the ghost of an underlying color peeks through. His teeming works seem, on the one hand, to be urgently composed, but the carefully accrued coats of paint  sprayed, silk-screened or directly applied from pigment sticks  also point to an artist who knows how to surrender to the pace set by his materials. I need the paint to dry to produce the layers, Martinez tells me one overcast afternoon in his studio in Ridgewood, Queens, ahead of his solo show at Londons Timothy Taylor gallery, opening October 12. The walls are hung with pieces in varying stages of completion. He pauses in front of one and leaves a single, deliberate stroke of brown.

Others, like the Danish chef Mads Refslunds new Brooklyn project, are years in the planning  eight years exactly, said Mr. Refslund, a founder of Noma in Copenhagen. What he set out to achieve is a fluid fine-dining concept, where the cooks are the servers. Everyone is a cook, he said. They can best explain the food to the customers, but turning cooks into waiters is a challenge. There are 26 of them, all dressed in black and rotating their stations. Theyre in full view at work: The dining room amounts to a huge square kitchen, surrounded by 58 counter and table seats, and a bar and a lounge in an industrial space  previously a rubber factory  with a white brick 1930s facade. The restaurants menu lists ingredients, each of which can be ordered, in consultation with a cook/waiter, hot or cold, grilled or chilled, or, as the name has it, fire (ild in Danish) and ice (is). The only meat options are sustainable American bison and venison. Custom carts bearing produce and seafood snacks to start a meal (priced per item) patrol the dining area. The menu is  la carte with a minimum of five dishes per person ($150); some are served family-style. The 18-seat bar also serves food with no minimum requirement. Among the dishes devised by Mr. Refslund and Bryce Shuman, his chef de cuisine (who knows his way around a grill if his food at Sweetbriar, his previous gig, is any indication), are Shigoku oysters with green almonds and cucumber, venison tartare wrapped in beet rosettes, tuna lightly roasted on kombu, grilled wild duck with plum juice, grilled sea scallop dumplings, surf clam shells sealed to form a vessel and filled with clam and tomato water to drink, and smoked barbecued eel.

It comprises 251 seats  a mere hamlet in the vast 64,000-seat general kingdom of the place, but it was our hamlet, and on the last Saturday in July, we took up each one of those seats and watched, our collective breath held, as Taylor Swift emerged from a bevy of billowing pastel parachutes and rose up on a platform to perform the 47th show of her Eras Tour. A few songs in, she announced, laughing, that her father told her that Santa Clara had named her its honorary mayor during her two-night stay there and that the entire town had been renamed Swiftie Clara. On the way in, we saw the Police Department cheerfully exchanging friendship bracelets with legions of Swifties. The microcosm of Section 301 offered this same sense of sorority. What a nice neighborhood we had moved into, my 15-year-old son, Ezra, and I. Within minutes of sitting down, we were already a community with a shared, ardent sense of purpose.

That includes the opening of a clutch of new hotels, like Farasha Farmhouse, a four-room boutique property. Formerly an artists private retreat, Farasha, which lies 30 minutes outside of the city center, is the vision of Rosena and Fred Charmoy. The Marrakesh-based couple are the founders of Boutique Souk  a local high-end events company popular with visiting celebrities and fashion brands (their client list includes Chanel and Saint Laurent)  and are known for their theatrical, over-the-top parties and weddings. Farasha, though, is a more tranquil endeavor. We loved the mountain views on both sides of the property, says Rosena, referring to the Atlas and Jbilet ranges that appear to envelop the acres of olive groves and herb gardens. The two-story main building, which holds three suites and the soaring, open-plan common space, is complemented by a neighboring stand-alone cottage. To furnish the place, the Charmoys turned to local creative friends: floors are laid with custom tapestries from Beni Rugs; sculptures were installed by the Moroccan contemporary artist Amine El Gotaibi; and the book collection comes from the family estate of Diana Vreeland, the legendary former editor of Vogue, donated to the hotel by her son Freck, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Morocco. Food here is similarly considered, overseen by the chef Aniss Meski. The olive oil is made on-site, most vegetable dishes use the farms produce and a flock of chickens provides a daily supply of fresh eggs. And if the prospect of snagging one of only four guest rooms seems like a tall challenge, fear not: six more will be available to book starting next year.

And the prettiest radicchios are the hardest to grow, says Jessi Okamoto, one of the co-owners of Campo Rosso, the specialty vegetable farm in Pennsylvania that developed the Rosa di Campo Rosso. As with a handful of other varieties, the Rosa is beautiful, in part, because it has been lied to: In the fall, young plants are transferred from the field into a heated greenhouse, tricking them into a second round of growth and an overdressed debut amid Decembers brassicas and tubers.",2023-10-18T09:01:57+0000

us,These Vessels Are Meant to Deceive,"The London-born, downtown Manhattan-based designer and art director Anna Karlin has always embraced a bit of creative tension. I always just think everything is possible and I figure it out, she says, having entered the interiors world as a self-taught product designer 11 years ago. Today, Karlin releases a new furniture and lighting collection that is a study in contrasts rather than bound by an overarching theme. Among nine new lighting series, the Mulberry set, made from sinuous oak bentwood and delicate horn-shaped silk shades, is evocative of Art Nouveau, while the Field headboard, upholstered in an abstract floral-patterned crewel embroidery, is a nod to Arts and Crafts. Other designs include wrought-iron chairs, lanterns made from ecru-hued fiberglass and colored marble side tables. A totemic bar cabinet, inspired by massive 18th-century Swedish wood stoves called kakelugn, is clad in ceramic tiles adorned with glyphlike shapes that are a recurring motif in her work. Each piece revisits Karlins previous designs while experimenting with scale and material. Im really beginning to solidify my language, says Karlin, who developed the collection over the past three years. My alphabet is there, I just get to keep making new words. From $4,250, annakarlin.com.",2023-10-19T13:03:35+0000

It felt like there had been a past that was so much more beautiful and vibrant, Bindslev Henriksen says. That past is now the present: In short order, Portugals second-largest city has transformed from a quiet, industrious town into a lively creative hub. It is flush with concept shops and casual fine-dining restaurants. Young winemakers and sommeliers are bringing a fresh perspective to old vineyards. Expats are returning home to be part of the revival. Attribute some of it to the costs and crowds in other European destinations. But chefs and designers are also drawn to the innate charms of the city, whose roots go back thousands of years. The settlement on the Douro River near the Atlantic Ocean became an important port for the Romans, who dubbed it Portus Cale and are believed to have made wine along the riverbanks. The centuries brought other conquerors, including the Visigoths, the Spanish, the Moors and the French, and a wide range of architectural styles.

Its Storico, run by Stephen Starrs organization, closed in July. Next up is the Oberon Group from Brooklyn, where it runs Rucola, Rhodora, June Bar and more, with a focus on sustainability. Diego Moya, the groups culinary director and a chef who rose to prominence during his pre-Covid stint at Racines, in TriBeCa, is the executive chef here, with Joseph Gaglio as his chef de cuisine. The restaurant takes its name from Clara Driscoll, who was in charge of the womens glass-cutting department at Tiffany Studios from 1892 to 1909. She designed many Tiffany lamps, some of which are in the museums outstanding collection. A few Tiffany pieces and other items from that era fill the shelves that decorate the airy, off-white dining room but, like shards of truffle over pasta, not enough to make a statement. Mr. Moyas menu has its eye on New York history with a lobster Newburg and a charlotte russe. Other dishes, like winter chicories with green goddess dressing, fluke crudo, carrot tartare, duck breast au poivre, steelhead trout and bay leaf mousse with burnt cranberries, depend on local and regional purveyors.

Once youve chosen which of the settings and stones to offer your giftee, Prounis will, she says, ask you or the betrothed a series of questions about the couples relationship before suggesting a design, which is then etched on the stone by a specialized intaglio carver. Or shell present a menu of options  among them, palm trees, clasped hands and olive branches. Prouniss designs have also included pet portraits, initials and dates. Its kind of like an anthropological study of what modern-day people want to inscribe in stone, she says. And for the newly engaged, an intaglio can also function as a wax seal: perfect for sending off invitations and thank-you notes.",2023-10-27T19:00:21+0000

In the 1980s, as if in response to the repressive evangelical movement gaining hold in American politics, grotesque body horror (The Fly, Society) became a defining genre, along with a succession of gratuitously violent slasher films in which hormonal teenagers meet gruesome ends, usually just beyond the sphere of adult supervision (The Burning, Friday the 13th, Sleepaway Camp). In the 1990s, horror films grew more excessive, with bigger budgets, but some added irony and self-awareness to speak to a generation of jaded young viewers who had seen it all: The potential victims in Wes Cravens Scream (1996) display a deep knowledge of horror film tropes.",2023-10-31T09:01:11+0000
