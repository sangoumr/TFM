PARTY FOOD: Small & Savory (Morrow, $25) is encyclopedic in scope and splendid to browse, aided by Tom Eckerle's luscious and artfully conceived photographs; it is an excellent gift for career-oriented thirtysomethings. It will inspire the recipient beyond takeout pizza and answers such diverse questions as how much food serves how many people, what one should prepare at home versus what can decently be bought, when to use the blender instead of the food processor, how many glasses for how many guests; it includes such esoterica as the use of agar-agar instead of gelatin when making terrines for uncompromising vegetarians. I personally find Ms. Kafka's emphasis on microwave cooking somewhat disconcerting. Other personal quibbles include what seems to me to be too much salt in the recipes, an unwarranted passion for reconstituting sun-dried tomatoes and the use of plain water instead of court bouillon for boiling shrimp and poaching salmon. I am also put off by chapter titles such as ""Fear of Frying"" and ""Veggie Good.""

Why 1840? That was when, Mr. Secord writes, the first single-breed dog shows were held in England. Not that dog painting didn't exist previously: in the 18th century, the painting of sporting dogs flourished among royalty and the landed gentry. With the rise of the middle class, having a purebred dog as a pet became a status symbol. ""Nobody now who is anybody can afford to be followed about by a mongrel dog,"" noted Gordon Stables in 1877, the year in which the first kennel club in England was founded. Breeders, eager to have their champions celebrated, commissioned portraits; the genre reached a sort of frenzied peak in the late 19th century under the inspiration and patronage of Queen Victoria. The most outstanding Victorian dog painter was undoubtedly Sir Edwin Landseer, although Mr. Secord includes a good selection of work by other notable artists, among them Charles Burton Barber, Gourlay Steell and the prolific Maud Earl.

This organization should focus on a two-prong attack. First, mount an educational campaign to convince the masses that affluence affords intolerance, and immunity from differences, whether it's on the Upper West Side or Nassau-Suffolk County. But more importantly, it should muster all of its resources to halt these unwelcome efforts, for there could be dire consequences to integrating the deaf, the mentally ill, the homeless, the developmentally disabled and the retarded into the community.

us,Taste of the Town,"Craig Claiborne created a new kind of food journalism during the 1960's and 70's in his weekly column in The New York Times. He wrote about both professional and amateur cooks and treated the home cook with the same respect and interest he accorded the professionals. He also wrote about the unbelievable diversity of ethnic cooking in New York City. Molly O'Neill, the food columnist for The New York Times Magazine, continues his approach in her NEW YORK COOKING (Workman, $17.95). This is not a cookbook in the traditional sense of the word, but rather an enthusiastic collection of food lore, essays and recipes gathered over the past five years. The approach is not necessarily focused on the best recipes available; it reflects the tastes of the people Ms. O'Neill writes about. There are, however, some wonderful recipes, like Sirio Maccioni's pasta primavera, La Cote Basque's stuffed vegetables and Eileen Yin-Fei Lo's honey walnut appetizer. There are also recipes from celebrities, among them the painter Robert Motherwell, the restaurateurs Jennifer and George Lang, Estee Lauder and Katharine Hepburn. From home cooks there are interesting recipes like potato focaccia and an unusual version of minestrone alla Genovese in which lard is used instead of olive oil, a practice that was common in Italian households until concern for saturated fat hastened the substitution of olive oil. Some recipes are slightly changed versions of well-known ones; some, like a pasta sauce with 17 ingredients, gave me heartburn just to read. Ms. O'Neill offers an antipasto of ethnic cooking with something for every taste. But in her zeal to capture the true diversity of New York cooking, she has given us a book that is complicated by a somewhat confusing format. Besides recipes and anecdotes, there is a great deal of information on where to shop for particular ingredients, as well as dates and places for ethnic festivals. For me the least attractive feature of this book is the constant reference, no matter the origin of a particular recipe, to chicken broth as ""New York penicillin."" Molly O'Neill is too good a writer to depend on such cliches. Overall, however, ""New York Cooking"" is well written, informative and entertaining.",1992-12-06T05:00:00+0000

(AP) Blackhawks 3, Red Wings 2: Detroit lost its fourth straight game at home for the first time in three years as Michel Goulet's third-period goal was the difference for Chicago. The last time Detroit lost four consecutive games at Joe Louis Arena was November 1989. The Blackhawks, 3-0-1 in their last four games, outshot Detroit, 41-30, to give goalie Tim Cheveldae his first five-game losing streak since January 1991. An apparent goal by Shawn Burr of the Red Wings with 5 minutes 39 seconds left in the game was waved off by Referee Dan Marouelli, who ruled Burr kicked the puck in. (AP) Oilers 3, Flames 1: The Oilers ended a six-game streak without a victory against their provincial rival as Bernie Nicholls's disputed goal in the first period helped Edmonton defeat Calgary. With the Flames a man short, Craig Simpson sent a pass through the crease that hit Nicholls in the skate and went past goaltender Mike Vernon at 17:50 for a 2-1 lead. Vernon complained to Referee Ron Hoggarth, who called for a video review. Replays showed the puck went in off Nicholls's skate, but also that he was in the crease at the time. Hoggarth allowed the goal to stand.

Drawing From Life","The child psychiatrist Robert Coles has long encouraged children to draw in order to help them express feelings that would otherwise be hard to articulate: the pictures take over where the words leave off. But to Dr. Coles, children's art is not merely another therapeutic tool. Each drawing provides more than a glimpse into one child's psychic vision; it suggests the intellectual, esthetic and empathetic potential of all children. In example after example of the drawings collected in THEIR EYES MEETING THE WORLD: The Drawings and Paintings of Children (Houghton Mifflin, $30), a child is able to transcend his or her circumstances through the understanding and commitment that come with creating art. The 11-year-old son of a wealthy landowner, for instance, draws rows of migrant workers bending before a large, imposing sun. He identifies with the laborers and shuns the smiling suns of his classmates because, he explains, ""I'm sure if the sun was a person, he'd be sad and he'd feel pretty sorry for what he does to those folks who have to pick our crops!"" A 10-year-old girl dying of leukemia snubs Dr. Coles's cheerful chitchat, then illustrates her struggle with an allegory in crayon: an arrow points to a flower-filled island while a human figure lies prone, being kept afloat by a river colored red, like the blood transfusions that sustain her. The author has collected the artwork of children from different social and ethnic groups worldwide, from Tunisia to Texas, and he explores the role of culture and history in what and how we see. To Dr. Coles each picture is a gift, creating a vision of the world as comprehended and transformed by a child. With the numerous full-color drawings that accompany the thoughtful, often poetic text -- edited by Margaret Sartor, a photographer and book designer -- readers are certain to share Robert Coles's awe.",1992-12-13T05:00:00+0000

Her creature of choice was Bufo boreas, named for the ancient Greek god of the north wind, an extravagant tag for a warty, blotchy, four-inch toad. It is more commonly and appropriately known as the western toad, its range encompassing the mountains of western North America. Twice a week, Carey went into the vast, pristine wilderness of Colorado to do her research.

The striking artwork on their postcards and letters, some of which have to be pulled from envelopes pasted into the book, are the strength of this otherwise self-conscious narrative.

Jagr's Overtime Goal Wins It for Penguins Jaromir Jagr scored with 2 minutes 10 seconds remaining in overtime to lift the Pittsburgh Penguins over the host Philadelphia Flyers, 5-4, last night. Jagr picked up a deflected pass from Mario Lemieux in the right circle and beat Philadelphia goaltender Tommy Soderstrom, who was making his National Hockey League debut. The winning goal was Jagr's league-leading seventh of the season. He has 14 goals over all. Pittsburgh has won five of its last six and is unbeaten in its last 11 against the Flyers (8-0-3). Philadelphia's sixth straight loss tied the club record set in 1970. Kevin Dineen had given Philadelphia a 4-4 tie at 5:10 of the third period when he skated in front of the Pittsburgh net and lifted a backhander that beat Tom Barrasso. The goal also snapped an 11-game scoreless drought for Dineen. (AP) Canadiens 8, Nordiques 3: Montreal scored six first-period goals in Quebec and went on to avenge a loss to its provincial rival a night earlier. The Canadiens, who lost by 5-1 to Quebec at Montreal on Wednesday, retained first place in the Adams Division, 4 points ahead of the second-place Nordiques. In the wild first period, the teams combined for 9 goals on 18 shots: Montreal took a 4-0 lead, Quebec rallied to make the score 4-3, and the Canadiens added two more goals to lead by 6-3. Montreal stopped Quebec's five-game unbeaten streak and also earned its first victory over the Nordiques in five regular-season games since last Dec. 26. (AP) Blackhawks 5, Jets, 1: Ed Belfour ran his unbeaten streak to seven games as Chicago remained unbeaten for the 11th straight time at home by beating Winnipeg. Belfour stopped 29 shots to extend his streak to 6-0-1. The Blackhawks' penalty-killers shut down the Jets on all 10 of their power plays. Jeremy Roenick scored two goals to lead the Blackhawks, who are 9-0-2 in their last 11 at home and have won five straight over all. (AP) TENNIS Injured Cash Quits Match The former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash, bothered by a recurring knee injury, retired yesterday while trailing fellow Australian Wally Limberger in the Colonial Mutual Classic, an exhibition tournament in Melbourne, Australia. Limberger had taken the first set, 6-4, when Cash decided that the tendinitis in his knee was too painful to continue. Cash, who did not withdraw from the round-robin tournament, said he was still hoping to play for Australia in its first-round Davis Cup match against the United States in late March.

us,Gems of the Desert,"""Walk in beauty,"" the Navajo blessing says, and SOUTHWESTERN INDIAN JEWELRY (Abbeville, $49.95) shows how generations of American Indian artists have achieved the balance, order and symmetry that phrase implies. Since ancient times, Indians have fashioned jewelry and religious artifacts from turquoise and shells, which signify sky and water, growth and renewal. With the introduction of silversmithing, modern tools and a greater variety of materials, Dexter Cirillo writes, younger artists are going far beyond traditional designs and are creating works of singular beauty and technical sophistication. Ms. Cirillo, an independent curator and dealer, discusses such influential earlier figures as Kenneth Begay, a silversmith known as the father of modern Navajo jewelry, and Charles Loloma, a Hopi who perfected the sculptural inlay technique. Each tribe has a distinctive style and preferred material for jewelry, Ms. Cirillo writes; for example, the Santo Domingo Pueblo people are known for their beadwork, the Zuni for their fine stone-cutting work. Ms. Cirillo also includes a collector's guide, glossary and tips on avoiding the purchase of fraudulent pieces. Stephen Northup provides excellent photographs of the artists, but Michel Monteaux's shots of the jewelry are the true glories of the book.

Stanford upset previously unbeaten U.C.L.A, the two-time defending champion, by 3-1 yesterday in Albuquerque, N.M., to win the women's volleyball championship of National Collegiate Athletic Association. The second-ranked Cardinal (31-2) took the match by scores of 15-8, 15-9, 6-15 and 15-10. U.C.L.A.

The top-ranked Bruins had beaten Stanford twice during the regular season. But U.C.L.A.'s poor passing and hitting, and the combination of 21 kills by Bev Oden, a four-time all-American, and 6 blocks by reserve Anne Wicks enabled the Cardinal to dominate.

He found a place where revered monuments and golden arches exist side by side. Consumerism and Western products reflect a thriving economy, especially in southern cities like Shenzhen; a pace-setter for style, food and business, it has been imitated by cities to the north like Beijing and Shanghai. Billboards exhort people to buy; soaring new office towers glitter both inside and out; clothes, jewelry and hairdos speak of commercial individuality and affluence. The country's leader, Deng Xiaoping, propounds a message of new socialism over a modern skyline on a billboard in Shenzhen. A Beijing sign shows a family on a shopping spree. They have only one child, as the law prescribes, but a girl, to show that to be ""out"" in some respects is ""in."" Their packages are covered in stars and stripes, currently the rage in fashion.

Ethan Mordden's RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN (Abrams, $45) examines the team's output on a show-by-show basis, with the benefit of the author's encyclopedic knowledge of musical theater. He discusses each show in the context of other Broadway developments, both before and since its premiere. According to Mr. Mordden, with Rodgers and Hammerstein ""the writing of the script became the fundamental act of composition"" and ""the musical-comedy composer and the operetta lyricist developed a 'healing' art as interested in discussing the advantages of community or analyzing the nature of love as in entertaining."" Mr. Mordden, a prolific writer on the theater, argues that ""State Fair,"" the team's only original film score, is ""the one dud of their 17-year career,"" ""Pipe Dream"" is their ""only bomb"" and ""Carousel"" is their ""masterpiece."" He also contends persuasively that ""Allegro"" deserves another look because it paved the way for the more contemporary ""concept"" musicals further developed by Michael Bennett and Stephen Sondheim.

us,Glass Will Tell,"The story of the Baccarat crystal works is fascinating, the evolution of its complex manufacturing techniques amazing, and the products themselves of great worth both historically and artistically. Yet BACCARAT (Abrams, $95), glossily luxurious though it may appear, is curiously lacking in substance, organization and purpose. The photographs, by Jacques Boulay and Jean-Michel Tardy, are grainy and not lustrous. The cursory and very brief text by the French Academician Jean-Louis Curtis tells the basic facts about this illustrious company, tracing its history from its founding in 1764 by the Bishop of Metz, who recognized France's potential to compete with Bohemian artisans in creative glass design and manufacture. Swiftly we are told of the various interruptions at the factory due to political upheavals and wars, and about the reorganizations after such interludes. There is little mentioned about why particular designs were favored, nor is there explanation of why 19th-century society desired or required such elaborate crystal. The oversize photographs are not arranged chronologically, and the placement of most of the captions makes identification very difficult. An incomplete but useful glossary at the end of the book makes the reader wish that such information had been included throughout the text, describing more fully the objects themselves and using the objects in turn as examples. Two pages from an early Baccarat catalogue illustrate the elaborate ornamentation of a tableware service, but nowhere in the book is such a service described in detail or illustrated by photographs. For most of us, such information would have been most useful, since we might conceivably own a set of table crystal, but probably not a crystal Medici vase, scrolled, gadrooned and mounted on gilded bronze lion claws.",1992-12-27T05:00:00+0000
