Then we learned that it couldn't. Not long after our move, the owners of Yanagi said they too were moving, to the Cherry Hill Mall a few miles away. Ugh, we thought, what could be worse than mall sushi? But what could be better, if it's made at Yanagi? Set among the pizza and sandwich stands at the food court of New Jersey's first mall, Yanagi does the run of Japanese food, but it outdoes itself in sushi. Yanagi's sushi chefs are speedier than most, as they would have to be in Food Court Land, but their preparations do not suffer for it. I'm partial to the octopus roll with hot and spicy soy dressing ($2.82) and the eel roll ($3.07). My wife, remembering our year-of-much-sushi on the West Coast, is a fan of the avocado-stuffed California roll ($2.82), while my young daughters go for the more traditional salmon ($3.07) or tuna ($2.82). Among the interesting combinations are the L.A. roll ($3.59), of tuna, avocado, cucumber, scallion and hot pepper, and the Garden roll ($3.59), of cucumber, avocado, pickles and Japanese squash. Though we're no wine mavens, we often have our Yanagi sushi with Champagne (which probably proves it) in a candlelit dining room on Saturday nights. It may not be Windows on the World, but somehow Yanagi makes our little corner of suburbia a bit more cosmopolitan. ROBERT STRAUSS",2001-04-01T05:00:00+0000

He is survived by his wife Barbara Fish, M.D., his son Mark and two grandchildren. Born on April 17th, 1917 in Brooklyn, NY, Max received his B.S. degree in chemistry from the College of the City of New York in 1936. During World War II, he was in civilian service with the Chemical Warfare Service. Following the war, Max joined the technical staff of Harmon Colors (later a part of Allied Chemical Corporation). From 1945 to 1961 he served in various research & development positions in the field of color pigments and color measurement. From 1961 to 1973 he held several management positions at the corporate headquarters of Allied. He retired as manager of color technology in 1973. He was also an Adjunct Professor for 20 years at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Color Measurement Laboratory. He was the co-author of the 1966 classic ''Principles of Color Technology'' (2nd Ed. 1981) which was recently updated by R. Berns. The book's philosophy reflected Max's penchant for quality control and common sense. After retirement Max was able to devote his full attentions to his passion for colorants and their history. His interest began during the early 1950 s while at Harmon Colors. He was often consulted on color and colorant issues by New York City museums such as the Museum of Natural History. In 1973, Max moved to Los Angeles and soon established a color laboratory in the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California at Los Angeles. Through this new laboratory, he performed research on ancient dyestuffs and the applications of color technology to art conservation science. A Fellow of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, he was asked to present the George L. Stout Memorial Lecture in 1984, one of their most prestigious honors. In 1986, he received the Macbeth Award from the Inter-Society Color Council for his pioneering research in dye identification of ancient textiles. The week before his death, the ISCC voted to give him the 2001 Godlove Award for his lifelong contributions to the field of color. He was also a member of the American Chemical Society, the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, the Society of Plastics Engineers, the Optical Society of America, the Society of Dyers and Colourists (U.K.), The Colour Group (Great Britain), the Dry Color Manufacturers Association, the Los Angeles Society for Coatings Technology, and the Federation of Societies for Paint Technology. In 1967, he received the Federation s Armin J. Bruning Award. In Max's memory, a fund has been established to support student research in art conservation science using color technology. Donations to this fund should be made out to Rochester Institute of Technology: Saltzman Fund & sent to Roy Berns, RIT Center for Imaging Science, 54 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, New York 14623-5604.",2001-04-01T05:00:00+0000

In invitations, press releases, catalogs or corporate stationery, the hyphen is being replaced with periods, underscores, asterisks or, sometimes, nothing at all. ''People started disowning the hyphen about a year ago,'' said Jane Wagman, founder of Janedesign, a graphic design firm whose clients include 60 Thompson, the SoHo hotel; Liz Lange Maternity; and Sephora. ''First, the hyphen got edged out by dots -- mostly by places that wanted to convey a European feeling, like art galleries.'' She said the trend has recently moved toward underscores (''It's a very Internet influence, used to create a young, high-tech effect.'') And while asterisks and bullets have also been visited, Ms. Wagman noted that ''it becomes too in-your-face.'' Her preference? Nothing at all.

And mercifully, no rude minimalist deconstruction confronts you, either. Instead, Wheatleigh's gracefulness seems effortless, like a turn by Astaire, a finger snap by Der Bingle or an illustration by Norman Rockwell (whose deceptively simple work is featured in a museum nearby).

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; But This Is a Review,"If David Markson is anything like Writer, a lugubrious fellow who pops up intermittently in THIS IS NOT A NOVEL (Counterpoint, paper, $15), his latest experimental outing, he seems to have written a book that's entertaining in spite of himself. Writer mopes around, feeling ''weary unto death of making up stories'' and ''equally tired of inventing characters.'' In an apparent bid to make his readers just as miserable, he wishes to ''contrive'' a ''novel'' without either. (Next on his to-do list: a disloyal dog and a flavorless cassoulet.) The result, like Markson's previous novel, ''Reader's Block,'' looks a bit like an old-fashioned commonplace book, a compendium of phrases, quotations, notions and facts, in this case mostly about famous writers, artists, composers, scientists and other historical figures. Despite its atomized condition, the book does, as Writer hopes, seduce the reader into turning pages. Why it should succeed at that when most other books with the same anti-narrative agenda fail isn't hard to explain. ''This Is Not a Novel'' may not be a story, but it is something equally addictive: gossip, with a dash of puzzle. Sexual improprieties aren't a primary focus, but professional sniping is, from Michelangelo calling Leonardo ''as ignorant as a maidservant'' to Orwell describing Auden as ''the kind of person who is always somewhere else when the trigger is pulled.'' Those with investigative proclivities can trace Writer's gloomy preoccupations through the items about how various notables died (and which in states of financial destitution). Other items are more enigmatic (why did Henry James hide behind a tree to avoid Ford Madox Ford?), and a handful have an evocative, lovely melancholy: ''When and where did the last person die who still believed in the existence of Zeus?''

On Tuesday at the Spanish Institute in New York City, Mr. Fraga unveiled his ambitious plans for an arts complex called the City of Culture of Galicia. He wants the project, designed by Eisenman Architects of Manhattan, to aid tourism in the town of Santiago de Compostela. Bilbao, 300 miles east, transformed itself in 1997 with Frank Gehry's $100 million Guggenheim Museum. For $125 million, Mr. Fraga is planning six buildings (the first is scheduled to open in 2003), including a museum of Galician history, a technology center and a 1,500-seat music theater. ''It's like creating a jazz sextet where different instruments play together,'' Peter Eisenman, the project's architect, said. Above, an interior perspective of the theater; below, a lobby rendering.

Judge James Ware of United States District Court in San Jose, Calif., ruled that Stephen Cohen used fraud when he took over use of the domain name www.sex.com five years ago. Since then, Mr. Cohen has built sex.com into a thriving pornography business. Gary Kremen, the Internet entrepreneur who filed the lawsuit against Mr. Cohen, said that he had been granted use of the domain name in 1994 and that Mr. Cohen had usurped it by forging a letter to Network Solutions , which grants the rights to domain name. The award is considered the largest ever in a cybersquatting case. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT) ",2001-04-06T05:00:00+0000

University Meal Deal, based in Sharon, Mass., has introduced a prepaid debit card that lets members eat at 20 or so local restaurants. Meal plans are available in Boston (Boston College, Boston University and Newbury College); Ithaca, N.Y. (Cornell University and Ithaca College); and College Park (University of Maryland). Prices are competitive with dining halls', ranging from $1,626 a semester (19 meals a week) to $282 (three a week) for students who have a mandatory meal plan. ",2001-04-08T05:00:00+0000

Especially at lunchtime when people from nearby businesses descend. One of them recently was Lisa Chapple from New Brunswick, who works in a local insurance office and on this particular day was digging in to one of Mr. Weber's best-sellers, Chinese chicken salad ($8.50 for a large portion, $6.50 for small). It's only one of his chicken-dish variations, including chicken pot pie ($4.95), rotisserie or fried chicken ($5.50 to $8.50, with two sides and corn bread) and Buffalo wings ($3.50 for 6 up to $10.95 for 24). The side dishes include homemade roasted-garlic potato salad and tangy cranberry supreme (cranberries, oranges and more), and there are 22 kinds of sandwiches ($5.95 to $7.95), including pulled barbecue chicken and a chicken chili wrap. David's is self-service with diners selecting what Mr. Weber calls ''fast food with a flair'' at a counter before settling at indoor or outdoor tables or taking their food away. When Mr. Weber, who is 39, opened his place four years ago it was like returning to his roots: his father, Bernard, a partner in the venture until his death last fall, also used to be a partner in Sammy's Romanian Restaurant in Manhattan, where David once waited on tables.

His movies -- particularly the trilogy of ''Breaking the Waves'' (1996), ''The Idiots'' (1998) and ''Dancer in the Dark'' (2000) -- routinely make critics' best and worst-film lists. Film enthusiasts have reportedly come to blows over his work. ''Dancer in the Dark'' won the Golden Palm at Cannes. Yet A. O. Scott, in two thoughtful reviews in The New York Times, saw the ''real struggle'' of that film as between Bjork's ''artistic conviction'' and Mr. von Trier's ''aestheticized cynicism,'' and wrote that the final scene of ''The Idiots,'' which I found among the most moving artistic experiences I've encountered, ''descends to truly contemptible emotional brutality.''",2001-04-08T05:00:00+0000

Nor do you have to have loved Nathan Lane in last year's Roundabout Theater revival. Sheridan Whiteside, the character based on Woollcott, played almost flawlessly by Monty Woolley in the film, is an ogre you'll love hating on sight. When Whiteside's nurse suggests that a box of fudge is probably not good for an injured man, he replies: ''My great-aunt Jennifer ate a whole box of candy every day of her life. She lived to be 102. And when she'd been dead three days, she looked better than you do now.'' The story of Whiteside, who takes over a nice Ohio family's house after injuring his leg there, is a comedy for the ages. Bette Davis is the great man's secretary, who falls for a local newspaperman. Ann Sheridan is the famous actress who drops by to interfere. Oddly, Jimmy Durante isn't nearly as good as Lewis J.

BUSTER KEATON REMEMBERED (Abrams, $45), written by Keaton's widow, Eleanor, and the film historian Jeffrey Vance, offers superb visual documentation of the great silent filmmaker. The 225 superb photographs marshaled by the photo editor, Manoah Bowman, mix images from the sets of his greatest films with some unexpected shots: Keaton looking sexy in pictures by George Hurrell, and even the rarest of the rare, Keaton smiling. Many are published for the first time, thanks in part to the contribution of Eleanor Keaton, who worked with Vance before her death in 1998. The authors provide a succinct biography and candid background about each film. Keaton's devotion to craft was single-minded, and he was happy to sacrifice his body on the altar of comedy, breaking his neck on a stunt and only finding out about it 11 years later. He once said that his landmark film, ''The General,'' had to be ''so authentic it hurts.'' Eleanor Keaton's oddball appendix -- How to Make a Porkpie Hat,'' about her husband's signature accessory -- evinces some of the perfectionism that made Keaton himself a legend.

A noted vitreoretinal surgeon, educator, clinical scientist and leader in the field of ophthalmology, died on April 4, 2001 at the age of 89. He was a graduate of Columbia University Medical School and retired lieutenant colonel of the US Army Medical Corps. During his illustrious career, he made numerous clinical and scientific contributions to the subspecialty of vitreoretinal surgical diseases. A gifted surgeon and teacher, he will be remembered most for his innovative work on the detection of findings indicative of retinal tears and detachments, known as ''Shafer's Sign.'' Above all, his pioneering work in vitreoretinal surgery set the stage for further developments leading to technological advances which made it posssible to remove and replace the vitreous in order to repair complex retinal detachments. He was equally prominent as a teacher and administrator. An elite corps of trainees represent a new generation of vitreoretinal surgeons who have already distinguished themselves within the diagnostics and management of vitreoretinal diseases. Each will remember Don as a teacher with wisdom, wit and warmth. As an administrator, he served as surgeon director and president of the medical board at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital for more than 3 decades, and he was chairman and professor of the department of ophthalmology at Cornell University Medical School for more than 11 years. He leaves a legacy of numerous clinical and scientific publications which led to international admiration, esteem and prestigious awards such as the Lucien Howe Prize from the New York Medical Society and the Pocklington Memorial Lectureship in London. As a result of his distinguished work, he was a member of the most elite vitreoretinal societies, including the Jules Gonin Club and the American Retinal Society. A former Westport, Connecticut resident, he spent the latter part of his life living in Dunedin Isles, Florida, where he lived with Ann Brady, his wife of 63 years.

He went to work in the mailrom of the NY Times in 1929. He then went on to work in Auditing where he supervised the Tabulating Department. He was a self-educated man, but early in his career his talents were recognized specifically with regard to his ''analytical nature, his ability to grasp the essence of a matter, and think clearly, and practically.'' During his tenure with the company, he worked as Systems Analyst in the Systems Department, and as the Manager of the General Accounting Department. He retired in 1970 as the Manager of Electronic Data Processing Services after 41 years of loyal service. Various letters, including ones from then President and Publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, acknowledged Edward's many accomplishments and thanked him for his devoted service. Edward's most notable accomplishment was the service he provided the News Department in November 1956 in setting up and directing an IBM Election Night Innovation. The innovation allowed the NY Times to tabulate and publish the National Presidential Election results ahead of the Associated Press. He also played on the NY Times Baseball Team. Edward enlisted in the Navy and served his country from 1944-46 with pride during World War II. His skills with tabulating equipment made him a prime candidate to support the Navy in Special Services. Edward's professional and military accomplishments were many, but he was more than just a resume of job titles. He was deeply loved by all his surviving family, especially by his wonderfull wife, Margaret, to whom he was married for sixty-five years. His daughters, Margaret Drum, and Patricia Zanchelli, remember him for his many wonderful qualities including his incredible sense of fairness. To his nine grandchildren and nine great grandchildren, he was affectionately known as ''Poppie''. He shared much with them including the joys of sand dunes, tadpoles, fishing, and boating at his home in East Hampton, NY. He gave his grandchildren fonder memories of youth than a child could ask for. Edward passed away on March 29, 2001 after a long illness and was laid to rest with military honors at Calverton National Cemetery in New York. A New York Times colleague of his once wrote of him ''The Times is a considerably better company with you as one of their officials than they could ever be without you.'' To his family, the world was a considerably better place with him than without him and we are all far better people because he touched our lives.

The redevelopment of the site, which has remained vacant since Macy's left it in 1996, has been the cornerstone of the city's plan to revitalize its commercial district. Tishman Speyer bought the property for $12.2 million in 1998 and planned a $125 million project with a multiplex and shopping center, but withdrew the proposal after having problems with financing. A Cappelli spokesman would not disclose the purchase price or specific tenants, but said the closing is scheduled for April 23, with demolition due to begin this summer. The company will meet with the White Plains Common Council and the mayor on April 24 to present the proposal, city officials said. The company, based in Valhalla, N.Y., and owned by Louis Cappelli, developed the New Roc City sports, entertainment and retail complex in New Rochelle, N.Y., and recently announced plans for a 320-foot tower nearby, which would be the tallest building in Westchester.

The companybased in Austin, Tex., said revenue for the quarter would be about $90 million. And Mr. Peters said the company should finish the quarter with about $420 million in cash. Changing the ''economic climate'' of the company and cutting costs, he said, improved the financial outlook.

The Bush team has obviously learned the virtues of speaking softly. Basic services will survive and no departments will be eliminated. Yet a careful reading of the fine print does little to dispel the impression that on the whole the budget's conservatism outweighs its compassion, even though there are some surprising cuts in corporate welfare in the form of budget reductions for the Export-Import Bank and for shipbuilding subsidies.

Both the state and central governments had guaranteed that they would pay the bills for the huge power plant if the electricity board failed to do so, but are refusing on the ground that the company owes a penalty for a technical failure to meet other contractual terms. The dispute now goes to a conciliation panel, and, if that fails, to arbitration in London. American diplomats have warned that the government's failure to live up to the guarantee could endanger future foreign investment in India.

Much of the increase for Mr. McGrath, who is also the chief executive, came in the form of restricted stock valued at $6.2 million, a benefit he had not received in previous years, according to the company's April 9 filing. In addition, his salary was increased 9.1 percent to $1.03 million and his bonus 67 percent to $981,000.

In addition, his salary was increased 9.1 percent to $1.03 million and his bonus 67 percent to $981,000. A statement included in the filing credited Mr. McGrath with several achievements, including ''good financial and operating results,'' ''motivating the company's work force'' and ''continued progress in achieving the goal of environmental excellence.'' Con Edison's stock price gained nearly 12 percent last year over the previous year, but the company also confronted some problems, including the shutdown of the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor for 11 months because of a small radioactive leak.

Nicholson, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus in Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Dr. Nicholson joined the faculty in 1969 at the request of Dr. Irving J. Selikoff to develop an asbestos exposure assessment unit for the Environmental Sciences Laboratory. A physicist by training with degrees from MIT and the Univ. of Washington, Dr. Nicholson created a quantitative approach to assessing asbestos exposure. His analysis of construction activity of the World Trade Center Towers led to studies of asbestos-related air pollution in lower Manhattan. His findings led to a ban on spraying of asbestos insulation in the city in 1971. The Environmental Protection Agency issued a national ban the following year. Dr. Nicholson's extensive research included projections of the magnitude of the asbestos epidemic and analysis of mortality rates of vinyl chloride-exposed workers and pressmen exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. His work led to the development of asbestos exposure standards internationally and OSHA's 1986 regulations. An activist in public health, Dr. Nicholson will be remembered for his great contributions to protecting the health and safety of working men and women in America and around the world. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his companion, Valerie Josephson, his children, Jamie, Darcy and David. Philip J. Landrigan, MD, MSC Ethel H.

Well, maybe it's not that extreme, but a golf package at the 700-suite Westin Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor, Fla., 25 minutes from Tampa's airport, may require participants to be ready for some hot weather. It is available May 24 to Sept. 23, at $159 a person, based on double occupancy, per night. That includes a daily round of golf at one of Innisbrook's four courses (one of which, Copperhead, is the site of a PGA Tour event) and a second round free at the Highlands North or South course when booked on the same day of play. The price also includes daily breakfast, unlimited use of the practice ranges, club storage and a daily golf clinic. Children ages 4 to 18 play free with a green-fee paying adult.

It was lower- to upper-middle-class and black and white, with subtle boundaries, to be sure -- but we all went together to elementary school and played in each other's backyards and basements. When the riots started, some of my playmates offered to put a ''Soul Brother'' sign on the lawn below our house so the mob, like the angel of death, would pass this Jewish family by.",2001-04-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Mudville Can Never Die,"Baseball is not a metaphor. Life does not imitate the World Series. Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better learn professional wrestling. People who agree with all this might still enjoy a new edition of Ernest L. Thayer's CASEY AT THE BAT: A Ballad of the Republic Sung in the Year 1888 (Handprint/Chronicle, $17.95; ages 9 to 12), splendidly illustrated by Christopher Bing. If you manage to slide safely past the dedication -- to all those children of spring who have found moments of heaven in the smell of a freshly mowed ballpark . . .'' -- you'll find that Bing has imagined something called The Mudville Sunday Monitor, which in June 1888 reports on Casey's legendary at-bat, while other news appears at the bottom of each page. The unusual pen-and-ink scratchboard drawings give this Caldecott Honor Book the look of a late-19th-century paper. Interspersed throughout are pertinent advertisements as well as editorials from another fictional publication, The National Sports Reporter & Gazette, one of which argues against the forthcoming exclusion of black players from organized baseball. Thayer's mock-heroic verse is, as Donald Hall said, a celebration of failure, and perhaps for that reason has always seemed especially popular in New England. The poet grew up in Massachusetts and attended Harvard, and the illustrator ''lives and dies'' (mostly dies) with the Boston Red Sox; even Bing's catcher looks a lot like another Harvard man, Henry Louis Gates Jr. This book should appeal to Red Sox fans of all ages, and prepare the young ones for the failures to come: ''Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright; / The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light; / And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout; / But there is no joy in Beantown -- mighty Manny has struck out.''

us,Folk Rock for Small Folk,"For parents who can't take the commercial blitz of Mars 2112 or ''Pokmon 3: The Movie,'' Dan Zanes and his band, Rocket Ship Review, are offering a hip, folky take on kiddie entertainment. Last month, Mr. Zanes began putting on weekly Sunday family concerts at the Park, the new Chelsea restaurant owned by Eric Goode (of Area and MK fame) and Sean MacPherson. In the restaurant's backroom, Mr. Zanes (who was the lead singer and songwriter for the Del Fuegos through the 1980's) performs roots-rock music for children -- much of it from the new band's first album, ''Rocket Ship Beach,'' which includes appearances by Sheryl Crow, Suzanne Vega and Lisa Loeb. Apparently, ''Polly Wolly Doodle,'' Bob Dylan-style, has charms that extend beyond the toddler set: in the audience last Sunday were Gwyneth Paltrow, Stella McCartney and Liv Tyler. The Sunday before, David Duchovny and Ta Leoni followed their daughter onto the dance floor. The response has inspired Mr. Zanes to start his own record label, Festival Five Records, on which the band's second album is scheduled for release in September. The musicians include, from left, Rosita Isles, Barbara Brousal, Mr. Zanes John DeNicola and Alyssa Lamb. ''There's so much soulless, corporate-produced stuff out there,'' Mr. Zanes said. ''Hopefully, we're making music that has a do-it-yourself feeling, as though a bunch of people got together to sing and have a good time. I want it to be homemade and fun.''",2001-04-15T05:00:00+0000

Medical Doctor during World War II in the Italian Marines. He was Health Immigration Officer from 1948-49.

The city had decayed, but otherwise not much else had changed since the glorious moment in the late 17th century when Aurangzeb, the last of the great Mogul emperors, moved the capital from Delhi to this little outpost at the top of the Deccan Plateau.

us,The Past Tense of Feel,"In Alice Fulton's poetry, those charged instances when the literal and the metaphysical (and the sensual and the philosophical) overlap are often mediated by wordplay -- a pun, a double entendre, a witty turn of phrase. The title of her marvelous fifth collection, FELT (Norton, $22), is meant to signify both an emotion once experienced -- or, as one poem is called, ''The Permeable Past Tense of Feel'' -- but also the fabric constructed by fibers that are forcibly pressed, rather than woven, together. In ''Fair Use,'' these two meanings fuse, so that felt represents the joyous and maddening experience of human interconnectedness -- a fabric of entanglement == / my consciousness felted with yours.'' (Fulton sparingly uses an amplified version of Emily Dickinson's dash -- double equal signs, which look like little train tracks along which one image speeds into the next.) Throughout these kinetically textured lyric poems -- they have varied indentations and line lengths, and are aurally rich with slant rhymes and musical rhythms -- the meanings of words shift, contort and refract (one point of creating art, as Fulton puts it, is ''to / origami thought''). In the long poem ''About Music for Bone and Membrane Instrument,'' written in a series of 13 sections, a Japanese fan metamorphoses into fan's other usage -- a devotee or admirer -- as the loss of self shared by both a star performer and a swooning audience member is revealed. In poems obsessed with identity, yearning and intimacy, the power of Fulton's verbal pyrotechnics is that they precisely animate these mutable, ever-changing states.

Marcellus is so affected by this event that at first he seems to be having a breakdown, then he does a little reflecting and joins Jesus' followers.

Recently, some board members expressed the desire to alter the occupancy agreement so that fees can be charged for repairs. Would such a change be legal? . . . David H.

Giuliani into Times Square on Tuesday afternoon in a prototype of General Motors' three-ton Hummer H2 sport utility truck, he declared that the vehicle combined ''ruggedness with luxury.'' But creating that combination appears to have provoked a little culture clash between G.M. and A. M. General, the military contractor that sold the Hummer brand to G.M. and assembles the vehicle for it. The differences were visible at a dinner on Monday at AZ, a restaurant in the Flatiron district of Manhattan. The two A. M. General executives ordered the beef, rare and bloody, while all five executives from G.M.'s new Hummer division ordered the sea bass -- with watercress. But James A. Armour, A. M. General's chief executive, rose to the defense of G.M.'s managers, sort of. ''I'm spending a lot of my time in Florida, so that's where I'm getting my seafood,'' he said. ''I have a boat.''

Alfred Poe, a former vice president of marketing for M&M/Mars in Hackettstown, was an original investor in Testamints five years ago and then became its chief executive. ''The candy presented an opportunity to spread the word of Christ that I could not resist,'' he said. The candy, 69 cents a package or $2.99 for a six-ounce bag, is sold mainly in religious bookstores, and is available in some catalogs and a few supermarkets.

But more often than I'd care to admit, I pick restaurants because they have cool names. This is how I arrived at Big Stash's. It didn't hurt that the sign below read ''Bar, Restaurant, Sandwiches.'' Give me two slices of bread, put something between them, and I'm happy. But this day I had stumbled upon no ordinary sandwich joint. For one thing, Big Stash's is, well, big. In addition to a massive horseshoe bar, there are two large dining areas, banquet facilities and a cafeteria-style counter. (Waitress service is also available.) Atop the wood paneling is a vaguely Middle Eastern trim. Don't look for couscous on the menu, however. Linden has a large Polish community, and Big Stash's offerings reflect that. Bigos, or sauerkraut stew, was a special this Sunday. Other Polish favorites included beef goulash, sausage, and pirogi. I devoured a kielbasa sandwich ($4.25). My seventh-grade wood shop teacher, Mr. Mika, often sang the praises of kielbasa. He was not a small man, and clearly knew a thing or two about animal intestines stuffed with meat. I believe Mr. Mika would give Big Stash's juicy kielbasa an A plus. Aside from Polish specialties and deli sandwiches, Big Stash's has a full menu of American-style beef, chicken and seafood entrees. They're all reasonably priced, with the surf and turf (lobster and filet mignon) the most expensive item at $22.75. At Big Stash's on a Sunday at noon, all the stools around the bar are filled. Hungry men eat. And every one of them looks like his nickname might be Big Stash. JACK SILBERT",2001-04-15T05:00:00+0000

Lashpro and the Petite Lashpro (both $19 at Henri Bendel) improve on the standard curler by repositioning and rounding the curved plates that grasp the lashes and the blunt-tip posts at both ends. The Lashpro design helps guard eyelids and the skin around the eyes against inadvertent crimping, and it prevents that undesirable 90-degree lash kink. The gadget is cleverly angled away from the face, providing access to individual lashes. In an informal test, the Lashpro was easier to use than a traditional drugstore curler (although instructions to hold it in place for 20 to 30 seconds proved a bit of an eyestrain; shorter sessions worked as well, with fewer tears). The Petite Lashpro allows even more attention to detail for Asian women with softer eye slopes, as well as for beauty micromanagers who want to achieve their curl a few lashes at a time.",2001-04-15T05:00:00+0000

In 1983, he became the first member of the Department of Psychiatry and the first and only clinical psychologist and nonphysician to receive the Medical College's highest teaching honor, the Elliott Hochstein Award. On February 5 of this year, he became the first recipient of the Dean's Award for Lifetime Achievement in Teaching. We extend our deepest condolences to his brother, nieces, and nephews. Antonio M.

But because of a drop in orders from its customers -- about 40 companies, including I.B.M., Motorola and Hewlett-Packard -- Celestica said it would eliminate about 3,000 jobs, representing 10 percent of its global work force, in the second quarter. First-quarter profit was $87.3 million, or 39 cents a share, on revenue of $2.69 billion, up 67 percent from a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had forecast profit of 38 cents a share. The company said it expected second-quarter profit of 40 to 42 cents a share, but backed off its full-year forecast of at least $2.05 a share, citing ''continuing caution'' among its customers. Celestica shares rose $9.67, or 29 percent, to $43. Timothy Pritchard",2001-04-19T05:00:00+0000

The number of private-sector jobs in the state hit a record 7,264,000 in March, an increase of 1.9 percent over the past 12 months. While that is slower than the 2.9 percent growth rate hit last September, it is far above the 1.1 percent national average for March. Unemployment for the entire state fell to 4 percent from 4.3 percent, and for the first time in a decade is well below the national rate of 4.3 percent. The rate in New York City was 5.1 percent, the same as in January. Private-sector jobs grew by 2.4 percent in the city but still slipped to the lowest level in more than three years.

us,"What He Hunted, What He Gathered","Succumbing to what he calls ''mal Afrique,'' or the need to return to Africa, in 1997 James Stephenson suspended his career as a terrace gardener in New York to spend nine months in Tanzania among the Hadzabe, ''perhaps the last hunter-gatherers living a traditional life in Africa.'' In the bush he learned, among other things, how to extract honey from a nest in the baobab tree and how to pass a lion's den without being attacked. He hunted wildebeest, traversed the parched bush in search of a sacred mountain and viewed secret rock paintings. He tried to save a Hadza girl from dying of a dog's bite. As in the best of travel literature, the account of the physical journey in THE LANGUAGE OF THE LAND: Living Among the Hadzabe in Africa (St. Martin's, $24.95) becomes a voyage of the self. Among Stephenson's personal realizations, the most central was his ''new union with nature.'' ''The energy of the stars, the earth, the trees, the animals, the water,'' he writes, ''all seemed to channel through me. . . . To have experienced this harmony was the greatest lesson of my life.'' Stephenson also treats readers to a memorable portrait of the Hadzabe, a shy people who relish the moment, do not understand greed and manifest profound reverence for nature and their ancestors. Their way of life is being threatened by encroaching farmers and hunters, and by the alcoholic drink pombe, available in nearby villages. Stephenson fears even his book may draw harmful attention to the Hadzabe. With alluring descriptions of nature and an inspiring depiction of this ancient tribe, he will more likely provoke readers into a new respect for remote corners of the earth, where people still understand ''the language of the land.''

Beckinsale, who is sipping fizzy water at the Mercer Hotel in SoHo, has luminous pale skin, which accentuates her dark eyes and long, wavy hair. She is speaking about two things, or really, they merge as one: the sudden death of her father, Richard Beckinsale, at age 31, and the very likely possibility of her own fame. ''My mother is an actress, and my father was a huge TV star in England,'' Beckinsale explains. ''He couldn't go anywhere. As a young girl, it was quite a thrill -- I got to meet the Monkees.'' In 1979, when Beckinsale, who is now 27, was 5, her father died in his sleep of a massive heart attack. ''Suddenly, everything was over, but then again it wasn't. My father has been dead for 22 years, and he's still on TV all the time. I'm so used to seeing him. Whenever there's a really significant moment in my life, he's on the TV. When my daughter, Lily, was born two years ago, I said, 'Let's turn on the TV,' and there he was. At first, it was hard to watch him, but now I see it differently. Now it almost feels like he's watching me.'' Beckinsale pauses. ''My father's death -- well, his fame and his death -- have given me a strong sense of the power of film. The work, if it has resonance, will outlive me.''",2001-04-22T05:00:00+0000

Dr. Parris found its remains in the Inversand Mine in Mantua Township in 1972, but it took years to determine that the three wing bones belonged to an undiscovered species. It was the first time in 100 years that fossil bird remains had been found in the state and the only find ever with more than one bone. The bird won't get its official Latin moniker until an article about it appears in a paleontology journal, so until then we'll call it the Ewnay Ersey Jaybird. Margo Nash",2001-04-22T05:00:00+0000

The cover photo initially struck me more as a Ralph Lauren Polo advertisement than as an image of a displaced teenager. But after reading the article, I realized just how deep this paradox cuts. In our effort to give these children ''better'' lives (i.e., lives filled with all the creature comforts we have come to enjoy and expect), are we not merely replacing one set of physical and psychological hurdles with another? Have we simply transplanted them into another predatory environment in which only the strongest survive?

Do to His Father?,"Michael Ignatieff (April1) describes Harold Abramson, a medical consultant used by the C.I.A., as an allergist, thereby casting doubt on the C.I.A.'s assertion that it sought psychiatric advice for Frank Olson. Although Dr. Abramson specialized in the treatment of patients with allergies, he was indeed a psychiatrist. In his extensive research on LSD (in which he used informed volunteers), he studied chemical inhibitors in the hope that they might be useful in the treatment of psychoses, and he tested LSD as an adjunct to psychotherapy and explored its possible military use through aerosols. His subjects were often treated afterward to cocktails because he uniquely believed that alcohol was an antidote for LSD.

Stateside, Department of Agriculture inspectors seized more than 300,000 illegal animal products in the last fiscal year, which they immediately incinerated or ground up to eliminate the risk of disease. Travelers try to smuggle not only the flesh of cloven-hoofed animals from nations where foot-and-mouth disease is endemic but also meats from vermin and bush animals that could harbor deadly viruses like Ebola. People use all kinds of surreptitious tactics -- pork sausages hidden in diapers or disguised as cigars in cigar boxes -- to evade authorities. ''It's really difficult confiscating meat,'' says Shirlene Ceballos, the port director of Dulles International Airport near Washington.

Am I the only gardener who, especially at this time of year, identifies with these bees? I doubt it.

Success, as it so often happens, has made major-label country music only more conservative, closed not only to innovation but also to its own uproarious history. Increasingly, the sounds emanating from Nashville are indistinguishable, one from another. What often passes for country now, particularly on radio stations playing that tightly controlled format, is a bland blend of tried-and-true formulas, with every edge smoothed by waves of hit-making experience. Country these days is defined more by what it lacks than by what it is: it's 70's rock without the sexual knowingness; singer-songwriter narratives without the desperate confessions; friendly, slickly packaged Southernness with none of the region's literary flair or ungovernable eccentricities.",2001-04-22T05:00:00+0000

Loving and beloved wife of Eugene Kleiner for 54 years, mother of Robert Kleiner and Lisa Kleiner Chanoff, grandmother of Jake Kleiner and Yael, Talia and Eli Chanoff, and sister of Bruno Wassertheil. Rose was born in 1925 in Katowice, Poland. In the fall of 1939 her family set out across the Atlantic for the New York World's Fair. While they were en route, Germany invaded Poland, and Rose and her family were suddenly emigres. They settled in Manhattan. Rose graduated from Brooklyn College in 1946, and served as a social worker at Quaker House. In 1947 Rose married Eugene Kleiner, an engineering student at Polytechnic University and also an emigre from Europe. In 1952 their first child, Robert, was born. In 1956 the family moved to California where Eugene was one of a group assembled by Willliam Schockley to produce the transistor. In 1959 their second child, Lisa, was born. Rose put her lifelong passion for social work on hold to devote her considerable energy and talent to raising her family. She created a house of abundance, filled with delicious food, music, laughter and fun. She sang in madrigal and jazz singing groups, and moved two pianos into her living room to play duets with her daughter Lisa. At age 49, after raising her two children, Rose returned to school and earned a master's degree in gerontology at Berkeley's School of Social Welfare. She became the first program director of the Senior Coordinating Council's Senior Day Health program. In 1982, Rose founded Older Adults Care Management (OACM), a pioneer in designing support plans, training companions, and providing support services for the elderly. Rose merged OACM with The Goldman Institute in 2000. As a community leader, Rose was a thoughtful and unstoppable force for good. She served on the boards of El Camino Hospital Foundation, the Career Action Center, the International Tremor Foundation, The Parkinson's Institute, Respite & Research for Alzheimer's Disease, the U.C. Berkeley Center for Aging Research, the International Longevity Center and the Goldman Institute, and was a member of the Citizen's Advisory Committee at Duke University Council on Aging & Human Development and of the Geriatric Advisory Council of Mt. Sinai Medical Center, NY. She was honored with a Woman of Vision award from the Career Action Center, an Athena award from the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce, and the Adele Elkind award from the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers. In 1988 she received a Lifetime of Achievement Award from the Senior Coordinating Council of Palo Alto. Rose was a positive thinking woman of action. She was enormously generous with gifts, spirit and love. She loved to take care of people and to make them happy. She always found the good in people and situations, and never spoke badly about another human being. She was wise, innovative, had a great sense of humor, a great sense of style and was completely original. She loved life and was adored by her family, friends and colleagues. She was and will continue to be an inspiration to everyone who knew her. ''I have always tried not to complain,'' Rose once said, ''but to see what I can do about something, to embrace life no matter what it brings.'' We celebrate her memory.

us,"QUICK BITE/Highland Park; Bagels in the Name, More on the Menu","Ensconced in the bustling downtown of Highland Park is the Bagel Dish Cafe, a cross between a restaurant, a coffee shop, a luncheonette and maybe even a diner. Its eclectic menu is testament to that. Consider, for example, the specials offered on one recent day: Grilled vegetables and portobello mushrooms over baby greens with goat cheese; balsamic grilled shrimps over bay greens; and hickory-grilled cheeseburger on a hard roll. On the daily menu, among other inventive dishes, are wraps: hot or cold, from tuna and grilled vegetables with goat cheese, to veggie burger, Buffalo chicken, honey mustard chicken and cracked-pepper turkey. The bagel part of the name is represented, but bagels are not a primary item and are not sold by the dozen as might be assumed. In fact, the bagel moniker is a holdover from when the place under a former owner was an extension of another bagel maker a few blocks down Raritan Avenue. Stephanie and Valilio Papagiannis bought what she prefers to call her ''gourmet cafe'' four years ago. The Papagiannises previously owned eating places in Sparta and Elizabeth, with Valilio, who began as a dishwasher, the chief cook, which he still is. Because of some of the items on the menu -- including fish and more strictly vegetarian items -- she also refers to it as ''a healthful eating place.'' This might account for the abundance of medical personnel who are regular customers. ''Doctors are No. 1,'' she said. Politicians come in too: ''The mayor was just in with her husband,'' Stephanie said. And to add a note of sanity: ''Every therapist in town comes in.'' Norman Oshrin",2001-04-22T05:00:00+0000

The IFO index of business confidence, based on a monthly survey by the IFO research institute in Munich, dropped for the ninth consecutive month and reached its lowest level in 12 months. But the decline was much smaller than last month, and it merely seemed to corroborate expectations that economic growth in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, will drop from about 3 percent last year to nearly 2 percent this year. Despite signs of trouble, the European Central Bank reiterated its view that European growth will remain relatively healthy and that there is no need to emulate the United States in lowering interest rates.

Prices for the widely traded floating-rate government bond fell 5.6 percent, pushing its yield up to 22.1 percent, higher than that of bonds issued by Russia, which defaulted in 1998. Cooler heads prevailed in the stock market, where the benchmark Merval index fell a more moderate 2.05 percent.

The increase in the fourth quarter from the fourth quarter of 1999, when ad revenue totaled $1.78 billion, was 21.3 percent, also well below usual.

The Norwalk, Conn., company, known for its pitch urging customers to name their own price, has cut staff and put expansion plans on hold to try to achieve its first profit.

The company also forgave Mr. Schulman $4.8 million of debt, half of the loans he has received from the company since joining in 1999, plus interest. He earned a $329,808 salary for the year.

This $95 million building is one result of the Design Excellence Program, started 10 years ago by the General Services Administration in an effort to hire notable architects to help improve civic architecture. Under the program, Richard Meier designed two courthouses, in Phoenix and in Islip, N.Y. Mr. Yazdani's other public designs include the Vermont/ Santa Monica Metro Rail Station, with a stainless steel canopy like a giant eye. In Las Vegas he has created a courthouse that weds public and private, stately and light, the monumental leavened with human scale. The public plaza (inset), shaded by a steel and aluminum canopy, is a point of entry to the three-story rotunda and the jury assembly room. ''We think the courthouse needs to show the democratic nature of the justice system,'' Mr. Yazdani said. Above, a view through the rotunda, which serves as a ceremonial public lobby.

That is why the aging veterans of D-Day still weep to recall the costly landing on the Normandy beaches, and that is why a new generation of men in their 40's and 50's are haunted by operations such as that conducted by former Senator Bob Kerrey and six other Navy Seals in the village of Thanh Phong on the night of Feb. 25, 1969. A story to be published in The New York Times Magazine on Sunday and now available at The New York Times on the Web relates the tangled story of how Mr. Kerrey, then a lieutenant, and his men killed as many as 20 unarmed Vietnamese men, women and children in what was supposed to be an operation to capture a Vietcong official. The former senator says the event arose from the confusion of night combat but nonetheless filled him with shame, guilt and remorse throughout a political career based in part on the fact that he won the Medal of Honor under heroic circumstances in a later engagement. Another member of the squad says the victims included 14 or 15 women and children rounded up as a group and shot on Mr. Kerrey's direct order. It is a story that -- with its conflicting evidence, undeniable carnage and tragic aftermath -- sums up the American experience in Vietnam and the madness of a war that then, as now, seemed to lack any rationale except the wrecking of as many lives as possible on both sides.",2001-04-26T05:00:00+0000

The agreement appears to end a dispute by the nations, the world's largest trading partners, that was important enough to be raised at last week's Summit of the Americas in Quebec. United States officials banned the potatoes in October after a disease was found on a Prince Edward Island field. The disease is not harmful to humans, but it causes malformations in the potatoes.

(The new CD, unbound by the time restraints of the LP, puts before the listener every second of tape recorded that night.) And though by the end of her short, cometic life, Garland had made 32 films, 60 television appearances and almost 400 radio shows, ''Judy at Carnegie Hall'' is the most conclusive document we have of her extraordinary talent.

us,Strom In the Balance,"In his front-row seat in the Senate chamber, Strom Thurmond sits with mouth slackly agape. His thin, rust-colored hair is stretched back from the top of his head, so straight that some strands do not follow the curve of his skull but float out behind it. His hands have grown enormous, spidery, and the fingers don't bend as easily as they once did at knuckles that have come to look like walnuts. Those hands were cut up in the crash landing of an Army glider flown over the bloody Normandy beaches; Thurmond was already 44 years old then. Now he occasionally raises them to touch his eyebrows, his cheeks and his lips with his index fingers, straight as chopsticks, or to pat that wayward hair. As his name approaches in the roll call -- around about the R's -- the aide seated beside him leans over and whispers urgently in his ear. Then, as the senator's name is called, the aide taps him on the elbow, and Thurmond rises to his feet to cry out, ''No!''",2001-04-29T05:00:00+0000

us,QUICK BITE/Hoboken; Applying the Pita Principle,"''Ruggedly handsome''? Yes, I am. ''Simply irresistible''? Guilty as charged. But ''positively healthy''? Sorry, you've got the wrong guy. So when the Pita Grill opened and advertised itself as ''positively healthy,'' I wasn't sure it was the place for me. Walking in, I was caught off guard by the fairly elegant dcor. With the name Pita Grill, I was expecting a scene akin to Belushi's ''cheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger'' skit. Instead, this restaurant offers exposed brick walls, a pressed-tin ceiling, tiled floor, muted lighting and flowers on the tables. I also didn't anticipate waiter service. And imagine my surprise when, after I had ordered a 20-ounce bottle of Coke, the server poured it for me at the table. Was I supposed to sniff the cap? With the stiff competition along Washington Street, it's important for a place like Pita Grill to distinguish itself. Hoboken patrons can be fickle: Johnny Rockets has thrived, for example, while Small Burgers folded faster than an American flag at Arlington National Cemetery. Pita Grill also claimed to have the ''best grilled chicken anywhere.'' So I selected grilled chicken on a pita, topped with roasted garlic sauce ($6). I added fresh mozzarella ($1.50). Best anywhere, I'm not sure, but the chicken was juicy, and with the garlic sauce, quite flavorful. On the side, I skipped hummus, baba ganouj, tabbouleh and couscous to find my old unhealthy friend french fries ($3). They were hand-cut, golden brown and not at all greasy. The menu promises live jazz Wednesday evenings and Sundays noon to 3, but on a recent Sunday no musicians were on hand. I didn't mind; there was piped-in music, and it had been a while since I last heard Andy Gibb's ''I Just Want to Be Your Everything.'' JACK SILBERT",2001-04-29T05:00:00+0000
