They had arrived there desperate to gain admission to the United States, many fleeing persecution in Haiti and seeking the protection of our asylum law. The administrations unsteady response to this crisis has revealed, once again, the broken nature of this countrys asylum system.

As the investigation into Bill Clinton unfolded, Lewinsky came under scrutiny as the most infamous intern in Washington, but kept largely silent due to an immunity deal with investigators. In this conversation with Kara Swisher, Lewinsky says she and the other women entangled in the presidents impeachment were all reduced in different ways to serve purposes for other people: for either political points or to make money.

Those early memories of color blocking, as he calls it, eventually found vivid expression in Iloris work: The artist uses kaleidoscopic hues and energetic shapes in an eclectic range of projects, from architecture and furniture to public sculpture and urban interventions. Whether hes creating carnivalesque cultural and social spaces (like his summer installation in the courtyard of Londons historic Somerset House) or reimagining forgotten elements of the cityscape (swathing a dreary underpass in rainbow tones), he seeks to spark euphoria and foster connection via an aesthetic that marries the sensory richness of his Nigerian heritage with pristine yet provocative designs.",2021-10-04T09:00:29+0000

And though the bulk of their oeuvres are distinct  Johanson is considered a linchpin of the Mission School, the post-punk movement that borrowed from both graffiti and folk art, for his colorful semi-figurative paintings, while Jackson is known for exploring the poetic and surrealist potential of handmade household objects, as with a U-shaped porcelain candelabra or a sculpture that incorporates sweaters she hand-knit  the couple have also been quietly collaborating for a decade on collage-like salvaged-wood furniture and functional structures, which populate their own home and studios. This fall, some of these pieces will make their way into his-and-hers solo shows in New York (Johansons opens in October at Mitchell-Innes & Nash, Jacksons in November at Tennis Elbow at The Journal Gallery), each offering an immersive view of the artists range and overlap during this recent housebound era.",2021-10-04T09:00:32+0000

Such questions stuck with her when she was an undergraduate at Tufts, where she majored in a multidisciplinary mix of art history, neuroscience and visual anthropology.

If his work space leaves an inchoate impression on this August afternoon, its likely because the 32-year-old designer hasnt had time to fully inhabit it, having quit his job at the prestigious design firm Studio Giancarlo Valle only a few weeks earlier in order to become a furniture designer full-time. His decision to venture out on his own was the culmination of a heady year and a half, during which Kim established himself as one of the most sought-after furniture makers in the contemporary design space, using primarily wood and fiberglass to fashion chairs, tables, lamps and cabinets possessed of a poetic, off-kilter presence.

Recall, first, that in many states it was illegal for an enslaved person even to learn how to read and how to write. Then the barbarities of the slave trade, the Middle Passage and cradle-to-grave bondage, were followed by another century of lynching, Jim Crow segregation, disenfranchisement and officially sanctioned forms of violence. Does the English language fail us, Baldwin wonders, in the face of racist terror? No, he decides; we must embrace it, occupy it, refashion it in our images, speak it in our own voices. We must deploy it to redress this terror. To accept ones past  ones history, as Baldwin insisted, is not the same as drowning with it; it is learning how to use it. This, surely, is integral to the freedom to write  the freedom to bear witness to the full range of our common humanity, and all that that entails, no matter how uncomfortable the process can be.",2021-10-12T19:52:15+0000

He wears a striped polo shirt and springy ringlets of hair that, observers insist, absolutely must be a wig. Sometimes youre offered a still picture of him sobbing, his expression wrenched and tortured  the way a stage actor, exaggerating for Broadways rearmost seats, might portray grief. Sometimes its a seven-second video in which Platt stammers and then takes off running down a high school hallway  an awkward jog, somehow both hypnotic and bewildering, from a 28-year-old who has been playing the same 17-year-old, onstage and now in film, for some seven years.",2021-10-13T09:00:05+0000

The flappers boyish silhouette became the ideal, leading to the popularity of the sautoir, a long necklace often ending in a tassel, strung with tiny pearls or gemstones, that nestled against the breastbone. It could be twirled languidly as one stood in sophisticated conversation during the cocktail hour  a ritual that was born during that heady era. Bulgari, the Rome-based house founded in 1884 by the Greek silversmith Sotirio Bulgari, was responsible for creating iconic versions of such Jazz Age passementerie, and has never stopped innovating the form.

Here, Mexican ingredients and their own corn tortillas will be for sale. To make their tortillas, they are importing more than a dozen varieties of heirloom corn in a rainbow of colors; about 20,000 pounds, in sacks, are stacked throughout the premises. A glassed-in, tortilla-making area is adjacent to the future shop; beyond is the dining room and bar. Mr. Wangeman came from Oaxaca right after high school and studied at the Culinary Institute of America to become a pastry chef, and worked at El Celler de Can Roca in Spain and Per Se in New York. He returned home to deepen his understanding of Mexican cuisine, and later, back in New York, opened pop-ups featuring traditional Mexican ingredients. His wife, a physician whose mother, Carina Santiago Bautista, is the owner and chef of Tierra Antigua near Oaxaca, joined him in the business. Mr. Wangeman said they feature tacos al pastor and that their gringas are made with corn tortillas instead of the more typical wheat but that they use cacahuazintle, an heirloom varietal that is soft and white like wheat flour. There are also side dishes, and the drinks menu focuses on mezcals, tequilas and other Mexican spirits.",2021-10-19T17:07:30+0000

In some cases, such views are rewarding; in others, unforgettable. In any event, one sees things somewhat differently, especially if the reporting is done with an irreverent eye, a waspish tongue and a no holds barred attitude to customary villains, heroes, strategy and tactics.

Or would this novel (which I loved) have been relegated to Womens Fiction, that close-quartered lower shelf where books emphasizing relationships and the interior lives of women are often relegated? Certainly The Marriage Plot, Eugenidess first novel since his Pulitzer Prize-winning Middlesex, was poised to receive tremendous literary interest regardless of subject matter, but the presence of a female protagonist, the gracefulness, the sometimes nostalgic tone and the relationship-heavy nature of the book only highlight the fact that many first-rate books by women and about womens lives never find a way to escape Womens Fiction and make the leap onto the upper shelf where certain books, most of them written by men, are prominently displayed and admired.",2021-10-21T14:55:06+0000

He advises us also never to tell another person that he is wrong, but adds that if we are wrong ourselves we can turn a liability into an asset by admitting it quickly and emphatically.

The materials of The Makioka Sisters, widely regarded as the most important Japanese novel since the Second World War, are therefore quite familiar to us in the West.

He must also value experience and have a truth-telling nature. I think I have that. In their youth most people worry whether or not other people will like them. Not me. I had the choice of going under or surviving, and I survived by understanding (after the iron  if not the silver  had entered my soul) that it is I who am keeping score. What matters is what I think, not what others think of me; and I am willing to say what I think. That is the critical temperament.

One might be inclined to assume that Smith, who began writing the book when still a Cambridge undergraduate, has bitten off more than she can chew; one might even feel a little huffy that one so young (she is 24) has aimed so high.

Anne Boleyn, the tease eager to supplant her, wont let the king know what shes wearing until their wedding night; she says yes, yes, yes to him, then she says no.

Yet, firm as they both were in achievement and promise, they didnt fully forecast her new book, Song of Solomon. Here the depths of the younger work are still evident, but now they thrust outward, into wider fields, for longer intervals, encompassing many more lives. The result is a long prose tale that surveys nearly a century of American history as it impinges upon a single family.

Not the intoxication of words which keep tumbling into rhyme, as one little girl neatly described it; not the irresistible rhythm of such songs as Bring me bread, bring me butter and Round is around, nor the fun which flashes out when least expected, can fully explain its success. Perhaps it is because, in addition to these virtues, Miss Stein has caught within this architectural structure of words which rhyme and rhyme again the essence of certain moods of childhood: the first exploration of ones own personality, the feeling of lostness in a world of night skies and mountain peaks.",2021-10-21T14:55:19+0000

She died in 1964 at the age of 39; she published 31 stories, of which 12 have been uncollected until now.

The pair spent 10 pounds on wood for a screen, dyes and linen and, after poring over a handful of instructional library books, began silk-screening textiles at the kitchen table of their small London flat. The following year, while awaiting the birth of their first child, they printed scarves, largely because they had just returned from a trip to Italy, where young girls were emulating Audrey Hepburns character in Roman Holiday (1953) and knotting them around their necks. Orders from high street shops soon flooded in. Next, they made tea towels, napkins and place mats with simple geometric patterns. Not long after, in March 1954, the couple, Laura and Bernard Ashley, officially founded Ashley Mountney Ltd.  Mountney being Lauras maiden name.

In 1996, he co-founded the influential arts and culture magazine Index. And between 2002 and 2011, he served as the director of Yales M.F.A. painting program. But he is best known for his often gargantuan neon abstract canvases, which he has made in subtly varying forms for four decades (a show of his recent works is currently on view at Dallas Contemporary). Comprising cell-like shapes connected by conduits, his paintings are at once luminous and austere, with textured surfaces he laboriously builds up using layers of acrylic frequently mixed with Roll-a-Tex, a surfacing material for houses. A native New Yorker, he works mostly from a 5,000-square-foot studio in West Chelsea, a former industrial building filled with buckets of Day-Glo paint and bins of splattered rollers. But his studio in Connecticut, a modest two-story house wrapped in black-stained shingles that he bought and renovated in 2010, and where he now spends a few days each week, is a very different kind of work space. It serves as both a refuge for making the 17-by-22-inch studies on which his large-scale paintings are based  a meditative process he likens to composing music but with colors instead of chords  and as a memory palace of sorts, filled with furniture and objects from each chapter of his life.",2021-10-27T21:28:05+0000
