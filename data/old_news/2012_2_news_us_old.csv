There are many reasons. For one, its long. At the operas 1842 premiere in Dresden, the performance, including intermissions separating its five acts, ran more than six hours. Wagner later sanctioned many cuts to make the piece more doable. Rienzi also poses epic challenges, including a big chorus, marches and processions. Musically, it is the young Wagners attempt to do a German version of a French grand opera, and then some.",2012-02-01T00:07:10+0000

The unusual action follows the decision of British officials to pursue criminal investigations into the role of MI6 in the rendition of the men, Abdel Hakim Belhaj, left, now head of the Tripoli Military Council, and Sami al-Saadi. Mr. Allens role became a focus of police inquiries when British newspapers published details of a letter found in Tripoli in which he told the former Libyan spy chief, Moussa Koussa, that the handing over of Mr. Belhaj and Mr. Saadi was the least we could do for you and Libya after Colonel Qaddafi agreed to dismantle Libyas nuclear weapons program.

us,Map of Earthquake Risks Is Updated,"A new map detailing all known geologic faults east of Denver was issued Tuesday by the government and a nonprofit electric research group, opening the way for nuclear power plants in the United States to embark on a broad re-evaluation of their vulnerability to earthquakes. It was the first major update of the map since 1989. While researchers began the computer modeling for the map long before the earthquake and tsunami that caused last years Fukushima Daiichi plant disaster in Japan, that calamity lent urgency to a renewed effort to assess the American plants. Further concerns were raised by a quake last summer near Mineral, Va., that shook a twin-reactor plant there beyond the extent that its designers anticipated, resulting in its shutdown for safety checks. The study does not calculate the risk of damage from an earthquake or even specify what amount of ground motion is likely at the reactor sites, leaving that to their owners. The model is the first step, said Scott Brunell, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The computer model was developed by the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium, with help from the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

The potential risk that a terrorist, a hostile government or a mentally unbalanced scientist could use the details to build a lethal, highly transmissible flu virus was of unusually high magnitude, the panel said. Physicists faced a similar dilemma in the 1940s when publishing nuclear weapons research, the panel said.

After a Marine unit found nine I.E.D.s hidden beneath Ugly Hills scarred and caverned faces last year, coalition forces seldom ventured near it. Until one night this October, when members of Echo Company, from the Second Battalion, Fourth Marines  known since Vietnam as the Magnificent Bastards  quietly sneaked into Juz Ghoray and posted signs on peoples doors and windows. Their idea was to co-opt the infamous Taliban practice of intimidating government sympathizers with night letters threatening execution. The Marines signs were bordered with the nations colors, and in Pashto and Dari they announced: The Afghan National Security Forces are coming. Two weeks later, about 60 members of Echo Company, along with 30 Afghan National Army soldiers, traveled on foot through the night and took Ugly Hill without a shot. At dawn, as villagers emerged from their homes, they found laborers stacking bastions to fortify a new Afghan police post.

Inexplicably, the N.C.A.A. rulebook says that taking that exam means that the student has finished high school, which is completely untrue. Rather, the exam is a passageway to the last few years of high school. The rulebook also states that a British student must then enter college within two years of completing high school.

Filings to the Federal Election Commission offered the first detailed look at a crucial source of support for Mr. Romney and showed his ability to win substantial backing from a small number of his partys most influential and wealthy patrons, each contributing to the super PAC far more than the $2,500 each could donate to his campaign. Fund-raising documents filed by President Obama showed the kind of financial juggernaut Mr. Romney will face if he becomes his partys nominee: Mr. Obama reported raising a total of $140 million in 2011, far eclipsing the $57 million Mr. Romney raised for the year. The figures underscored the deep divide between how each partys presidential contenders are financing their early bids for the White House: Mr. Obama exploiting the well-oiled machinery of an incumbent with a powerful grass-roots apparatus and hundreds of bundlers gathering checks of up to $2,500 per person from friends and associates, and his Republican opponents relying far more heavily on independent groups empowered by court decisions that have made it easier for wealthy individuals and corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to intervene directly in election contests.

Janet Pierson, producer of the festivals movie portion, noted a kind of aggressiveness, a boldness, risk-taking in 130 feature films that will screen between March 9 and March 17 in Austin, Tex. Ms. Pierson pointed, for example, to Dollhouse, an Irish film, from the writer-director Kirsten Sheridan, about five street kids who create havoc after breaking into a suburban Dublin home. Several documentaries in the program look at Los Angeles and the raucous past of its music culture. Those include Sunset Strip, about the history of that iconic portion of Sunset Boulevard, and Uprising: Hip Hop & the L.A. Riots. Celebrity figures in $ellebrity, a documentary by the star photographer Kevin Mazur, and in Decoding Deepak, also a documentary, in which Gotham Chopra examines his famous father, Deepak. The festival earlier announced that it would host the premiere of The Cabin in the Woods, a long-awaited horror film directed by Drew Goddard and written by Mr. Goddard and Joss Whedon. In all, programmers reviewed 1,957 feature-length submissions, including 1,387 from the United States, and 570 from abroad, the festival said. The full feature film program is listed here.",2012-02-01T20:00:19+0000

us,Coming Soon | Man Slippers,"Opera pumps, evening slippers, court shoes  all are fairly off-putting, emasculating names for the footwear that made its way down many runways during the recent mens shows in Europe. A more user-friendly term might be evening slip-ons. Those prim, shiny black-patent shoes, traditionally finished with grosgrain ribbon and worn to the opera and other after-five affairs, have been transformed into red-carpet walkers ornately decorated with embroidery, tassels, metal studs, glitter and prints. Dries van Noten chose sleek brown pony and black astrakhan for his version. Almost every single pair of shoes that walked down the Etro runway was a slip-on that was either jacquarded, paisleyed, embroidered or feathered. Jimmy Choos hyper elegant and wildly expanding mens line has so many varieties of their evening shoe, the Sloane, that is seems almost a wardrobe staple  leopard prints, studded stars and a house-designed porno camo are just some of whats offered. Sarah Burtons rich, dandified Alexander McQueen collection, with its Prince of Wales plaids, trompe loeil moir and knickered suits, had an elegant evening outfit in black and white with a shoe embroidered with such large white roses they looked life-sized. Tom Ford, ever the night bird, has shown elegant evening shoes in his line from the get go: rich velvets ready for a monogram and extravagant brocades, some with slinky tassels. Perfect for a handsome Beverly Hills house husband. And Christian Louboutin, who presented his growing mens line in Paris, added some more slip-ons in velvet with studded cap toes and a properly regal crest. Given the recent stateside popularity of the espadrille, and similar styles by Toms Shoes, the evening slip-on has big potential for a life outside the opera house.

I wrote a screenplay based on the play several years ago, and for me the obvious comparison was to Rudy Giuliani. As a federal prosecutor taking down gangsters and white-collar criminals, Giuliani won some dramatic battles, and after 9/11 he was widely praised for making the city feel under control. Like Coriolanus, he came across as a man of action. But he displayed open contempt for those who disagreed with him, and he dismissed the voices of many of his constituents. Shakespeare portrays the public as fickle, but its not unreasonable to admire some of a leaders qualities while finding serious fault with others. Coriolanus is a great warrior, but hes a terrible model for a civic leader. ",2012-02-03T15:47:07+0000

One point raised by Peter Weyand, a biomechanics professor at Southern Methodist University, is that Pistoriuss prosthetic running legs are much lighter than real human legs would be for a man of his size. He gives the figure of 5.4 pounds for the prosthetic, compared with 12.6 pounds for a real human leg, and states that as a result, Pistorius can move his legs much quicker than those with real legs, and generate more speed. If this is the true point of contention, why not simply design a heavier running prosthetic, one that models the accurate weight of a human leg, and end the debate? Then there could be no claim that Pistorius was at an unfair advantage. ",2012-02-03T15:47:10+0000

Naked Lunch had just been published by the Olympia Press; because of censorship it would not be published in the United States for another three years. He was collaborating with the British artist and writer Brion Gysin on a variety of experimental procedures. Gysin had just accidentally discovered the cut-up method, in which pages of different texts are cut into sections and combined and rearranged to form new meanings. The two were also making tape-recorder montages and tinkering with a stroboscopic device called the dream machine. Burroughs was then at the height of his literary activity, working on many of his most important books, from The Soft Machine to The Wild Boys, within the following few years. Consequently, Rub Out the Words, unlike its predecessor (The Letters of William S.

But Broad brings neither the boosterism of a yoga devotee nor the leeriness of a professional skeptic to his project  just curiosity, energy and a commitment to follow where his investigations lead. That route turns out to be a long and meandering one, ending up at an ambiguous, or at least ambivalent, conclusion. Though The Science of Yoga lacks the clarity of a book that sets out to define and defend a preconceived position, what it does offer is an intellectually honest exploration that is true to yogas own winding path.",2012-02-03T16:36:24+0000

Its centerpiece was the Great Expectations boat ride, which started in a rat-infested creek, flew over the Thames, snaked through a graveyard and splashed into a sewer. Its staff had all been trained in Victorian accents and body language. Visitors could sit at a wooden desk and get berated by an angry Victorian schoolteacher, watch Dickensian holograms antagonize one another in a haunted house or set their kids loose in a rainbow-colored play area called, ominously, Fagins Den, after the filthy kidnapper from Oliver Twist.

Next month the Russian starlet will perform Grahams 1947 Errand Into the Maze, along with two other contemporary works, in New York. The Graham piece is inspired by Ariadne and the Minotaur and is a riff on sexual self-awareness. Vishneva is flat-footed throughout and wears a floaty, quite lyrical dress  a far cry from her usual tutus  a design done for the original Graham production. In classical roles you dont have the freedom to express deep inner emotions the way I do now, says the 35-year-old, conceding that she could never have taken on the part as a young girl. Even in Ariadnes weakness, the role of the maid, she is still strong and powerful. For the other two works, Dialogue by John Neumeier and Subject to Change by Paul Lightfoot and Sol Len, she dances in a maroon housedress-like leotard and white Victorian blouson and briefs, respectively. Asked how this new program and new look have been received thus far in Moscow and St. Petersburg, she said cutely: Taking the roof off. Vishneva and crew arrive at New York City Center on March 14.

They were officially qualified now for four more years of flight. But the petty officer reminded them that their course was just an orientation for something that, if their luck turned bad, would probably be much worse. Who thinks that if this happens it is going to be a comfortable environment? he asked. Nobody, he answered. I am not going to lie to you.

The admission came as two judges at the High Court in London were hearing evidence in a lawsuit brought by a former deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and a group of other litigants. Top officers at Scotland Yard have previously rejected allegations that they tried to quash a wide-ranging inquiry into the hacking as part of a cozy relationship with the British newspaper subsidiary of Rupert Murdochs News Corporation, owner of the now-defunct News of the World. At the High Court, Scotland Yard lawyers said the failure to investigate more thoroughly resulted from the pressure the police were under to investigate terrorism threats. ",2012-02-08T03:28:32+0000

An e-mail petition for a pardon for Mr. Turing, who committed suicide by eating a cyanide-laced apple in 1954, when he was 41, has drawn worldwide support from scientists and others. But Tom McNally, a minister of state for justice, told the House of Lords that the Cameron government stood by the decision of previous governments not to grant a pardon for Mr. Turings conviction for gross indecency. Mr. McNally noted that the former prime minister, Gordon Brown, had issued an unequivocal a posthumous apology to Mr. Turing in 2009, but he said that Mr. Turing would have known that he was committing an offense under the law as it stood at the time.

If found guilty, Mr. Garzn, 56, could be suspended as a judge for as long as 20 years, a sanction that would effectively end his career. His 2008 attempt to investigate killings from the Spanish Civil War was brought to a swift end because of the political controversy that it set off. But right-wing groups started legal action against him, charging that he had overreached his authority and knowingly contravened a 1977 general amnesty that covers crimes perpetrated during the war.

While teaching a class called Form Studies in the early 1970s, the Hungarian architect Erno Rubik had his students slice a large cube of foam horizontally and vertically. He quickly realized that you could rotate the top half relative to the bottom half, the puzzle expert Jerry Slocum says. And thats where the idea of the Rubiks Cube came from. In 1975, Rubik patented it under the name Magic Cube and pitched toy executives on the notion that something that forced players to exert extraordinary mental energy was loads of fun.

Free Tibet, a London-based group, said the monk, in his 30s, was alive but in serious condition. More than 20 Tibetans, most of them monks or former monks, have died from self-immolations in the past three years, protesting what they say is Chinas repression of Tibetan culture and religion. The state-run Tibet Daily said Thursday that Tibets Communist Party secretary had dismissed three subordinates for failing to crack down on a recent wave of Tibetan unrest, which China says was caused by subversion by disciples of the Dalai Lama, Tibets spiritual leader in exile.

In Pink Smog: Becoming Weetzie Bat, nearly everything about Weetzie changes  except for her love of these two things. In fact, these two bedrocks become inextricably linked as Weetzie learns to use Los Angeles and the lessons it has taught her to cope with her fathers departure. Charlies absence would be difficult enough on its own, but Weetzie also has to deal with a new school, an alcoholic mother, the first flutter of adolescent attraction, a boy who may be either an angel or a surfer, and a next-door neighbor who is either a witch with a passion for voodoo or a psychotic girl with a hateful agenda and a pair of chow chows.

That, of course, leaves a $24 billion trade deficit. Currencies work like any other salable good in that they adjust based on supply and demand. The natural result should be for the dollar to get weaker as the renminbi gets stronger. Not so. Just as foreigners need (and, hence, demand) dollars to spend on American exports, foreigners need (and, hence, demand) dollars to invest in America. Because a rising U.S. trade deficit often signals increased foreign demand to invest in America, its a mistake to suppose that dollars that foreigners dont spend on American exports necessarily are dollars not demanded by foreigners for use in America. In short, a rising U.S. trade deficit does not necessarily unleash market forces that weaken the dollar against other currencies.",2012-02-10T16:53:09+0000

I dont remember what age I was  feels like it could have happened anytime between the 6th and 11th birthdays  but I picture the scene with a strange, time-slurred clarity of detail. His offices were always in the basement, because thats where he could smoke his endless, extra-long menthols, exhaling nasally over the red mustache. I can smell it in his sweat when he bends down to kiss me goodbye, and I smell it in this room. I also note cat urine, because our vicious, lonely old calico, Skipper, tends to relieve herself on the dark green chair in the corner when stressed, and the scent has soaked into the stuffing, and my father wont throw away the chair, because it belonged to his father. The mottled surface of the desk where he writes is dark green, almost black, and glowing green are the little letters on the screen of the primitive Tandy word processor the newspaper has given him, and an excellent forest green is the cover of The Portable James Joyce, my mothers Penguin paperback from college. Hes holding it close to his face. He was blind in one eye and couldnt see especially well out of the other, wore dark-framed, vaguely government-issue glasses, but theyre lowered, hes turning his head and squinting over the top of them. He reads me the famous last paragraph, The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. . . . Nothing of the actual language remained with me, except, years later, reading the story at school, there was something like dj vu at the part where Joyce first says the snow was falling faintly, then four words later says it was, faintly falling.

Among the documents available on the Web site are notes from Darwins time aboard the HMS Beagle, pocket diaries, early drafts of works like The Origin of Species (viewable with and without Darwins revisions), and previously unpublished manuscripts like an experiment book describing Darwins original research on plant breeding strategies, begun in 1856. In addition to revealing Darwins intellectual evolution, the project also reveals Darwins sometimes less-than-careful treatment of some of his own papers. Today, a first-edition of the Origin is a highly sought after rare book, but pages of the original manuscript are even rarer, thanks to Darwins habit of passing them out as scrap paper. Among the 42 full pages known to survive today, a few feature fanciful drawings on the reverse by his son Francis showing birds undreamed of in the Galpagos Islands as well as a soldier on a carrot battling a cavalier on an eggplant.

Davis assertions, detailed in an unclassified report and an essay in Armed Forces Journal , have prompted much debate, pro and con. Below, two special forces officers, one an American who spent last year working with Afghan forces, and the other an Afghan, offer a different view. The officers did not write with the explicit purpose of countering Lt. Col. Davis, but merely to document their observations on the progress and pitfalls of training Afghan security forces in one very unsettled province.

I remember this beautiful, skinny, confident, 21-year-old girl-child coming to the microphone that night and silencing all of us in the middle of our conversations, our drinks, our meals as she toe up I Am Changing, from the Broadway show Dreamgirls.

To channel Ervells vision of contrasts, the hairstylist Holli Smith played with juxtaposing textures and lots of different sprays: Theres a frizzy, dry feel on top, with strokes of shine below, right around the edges. After amplifying volume with Oribe Maximista Thickening Hair Spray, Smith spritzed Oribe Soft Lacquer Hair Spray to the top of the head, and went in with a curling iron. The newly-created waves were then dulled down with the help of Oribe Dry Texturizing Hair Spray. To keep the bottom and sides looking glossy, Smith layered on generous amounts of Oribe Superfine Strong Hair Spray. Continuing the theme of opposites, the makeup artist Maki Ryoke said, Im keeping the T-zone very matte, but highlighting the cheekbones for an almost 3-D effect. Skin was cleaned with Bioderma Crealine, then lightly moisturized with Embryolisse Concentrated Lait Cream, both of which are fashion-world cult favorites. Ryoke proceeded by correcting complexions with Bobbi Brown concealers and hydrating lips with Australian Lucas Papaw Ointment.

For Smalls, he said he didnt need any product aside from Moroccan Oil Luminous Hairspray to build up the crown. The less we stress the hair, the better, he said, explaining that hed give Smalls a bottle of Moroccan Oil treatment to use on her 10 minutes off. Each model was wearing a curious black loop around her neck, which turned out to be a headband that would crown the teased up hair when done. Some girls would also have the ends pulled back and secured with a black bow. It was statement hair for Herrera, which meant Kendal wanted subtle makeup. Back to the other side, where she was using M.A.C. Sculpt contouring powder and Tenderling blush on cheeks, Taupe eyeshadow on lids and Black Cremestick Liner applied superclose to the lash line with a little brush. Its a beautiful, soft effect, without looking too normal, she said of the liner bleeding in between the lashes as a substitute for mascara.

They grew up in the Chicago area eating sandwiches made with the gadget, whose brief life ran from 1945 to 1953. Recently, they learned that the company had gone out of business and that the patent had expired, but after buying a Toas-Tite on eBay, they reverse engineered it to figure out how to make it again. They now have the contraption made in China, and have trademarked it and reproduced the original packaging. Lightly grease the domelike cast-aluminum forms, place a slice of bread in each, add a filling, close the device and place it on a burner or grill for a minute or so. Turn it over, and in another minute you have a toasted sandwich. It demands cheese. Vintage Toas-Tites cost as much as $95 on eBay, so the replica is a relative bargain.",2012-02-14T23:00:24+0000

They argued that the Legislature had failed to properly analyze the impact that privatizing so many prisons would have on the state. The bill, one of the most contentious of the legislative session, prompted the Senate president to remove one Republican, Mike Fasano, an outspoken opponent of privatization, as chairman of the Senate budget subcommittee on public safety earlier this year.

This strong, smoky eye was finished off with mascara, brushed brows, matte skin and a new nude peach lipstick. Pecheux explained the back story imagined for the collection, describing the intricate eye as the result of a fallen starlets sleight of hand learned during her celebrity heyday. She may have no money, but she knows how to do her makeup. In contrast, he explained, dong ones own hair can be harder, which is why Didier Malige created a roughed-up ponytail. He used Aveda Volumizing Tonic to dampen hair, blow-dry and then finger rake it into a center part with a teased crown. Pure Abundance Hair Potion, a powder to liquid, was then applied as the hair was pulled back with a strand to cover the elastic set with Air Control Hairspray.

The two essays overlap in many ways, but they ultimately make an interesting contrast: Gopnik is a liberal whose moral outrage at our prison systems cruelties coexists with a confidence that better policy can keep crime rates low without locking so many people up; Glazek is a radical who insists that the [U.S.] prison system doesnt need reformit needs to be abolished, and flatly states that you cannot relieve the suffering of the prison population without increasing safety risks for the rest of us. This radicalism leads him to distinctive and, indeed, one might even say conservative  conclusions: He argues, for instance, that pro-gun control progressives should be willing to live with a heavily-armed population in order to make Americans feel safe enough to countenance emptying our prisons, and he has a skepticism about the consequences of the anti-death penalty movement that overlaps substantially with my own views. Like Reihan Salam I wouldnt endorse many of Glazeks more sweeping claims, but he makes important points that both liberal and conservative reformers need to reckon with  and hes almost certainly right any real prison reform effort is likely to prove much more wrenching than the optimism of policy wonks would sometimes lead one to expect.",2012-02-15T20:25:46+0000

And now that several animated films have cracked the best picture list  including Up and Toy Story 3  animation should no longer be accorded what amounts to a consolation prize, Mr. Harris writes, adding: A separate award feels redundant in a great year  and worse than that in an off year.

The cost was the destruction of a pristine valley that the naturalist John Muir once called one of natures rarest and most precious mountain temples. The project, completed in 1923 despite a national outcry, included a sweetheart deal for San Francisco: the right to buy the water for $30,000 a year. There have been many attempts to re-examine this deal and study whether the dam could be breached, the reservoir emptied and the valley restored. In the latest, Representative Dan Lungren, a Republican from California, has asked Ken Salazar, secretary of the interior, to investigate whether San Francisco is fulfilling its end of the deal, which requires the city to use all its local water sources before turning to Hetch Hetchy.

Also anticipating Logans arrival are her husband, Joseph Burkett, a work-at-home Congressional liaison, who is doing what all work-at-home dads do, i.e. strategically skirting past areas populated by children; Joseph and Lola, ages 3 and nearly 2, in pjs and pacifiers, just up from their naps and on the prowl for snacks; and Ruby, the nanny, installed at the kitchen table from which she can attend to everyones needs with minimal motion. Logan, a 60 Minutes correspondent, is now 90 minutes late, but one gets the sense from Burketts periodic updates (shes just been held up, leaving soon) that a long office stint on a weekend is not out of the ordinary. When she eventually arrives  in flat boots and skinny fleece, looking freckled, tousled, sporty  she is greeted by the siege on Mommy, an attack of love and neediness all working mothers know too well.

us,Two-Part Harmony,"By Charlie Louvins own account, people who saw the Louvin Brothers perform were mystified by the experience. Ira Louvin was a full head taller than his younger brother, played the mandolin like Bill Monroe and sang in an impossibly high, tense, quivering tenor. Charlie strummed a guitar, grinned like a vaudevillian and handled the bottom register. But every so often, in the middle of a song, some hidden signal flashed and the brothers switched places  with Ira swooping down from the heights, and Charlie angling upward  and even the most careful listeners would lose track of which man was carrying the lead. This was more than close-harmony singing; each instance was an act of transubstantiation. It baffled a lot of people, Charlie Louvin explains in his crackling new memoir. We could change in the middle of a word. Part of the reason we could do that was that wed learned to have a good ear for other peoples voices when we sang Sacred Harp. But the other part is that we were brothers. ",2012-02-17T16:12:04+0000
us,"Next Time, Try Unflagging","It started with the jacket copy for the British hardback of Richard Holmess wonderful Age of Wonder. We learn there of the astronomer William Herschels tireless dedication to the stars (the actual stars, that is, the ones out there in space, before they were superseded  and possibly even outnumbered  by those in the realm of film, pop and sport). This connection between an adjective and the stars made me curious about the extent to which a word can continue to shine after the life has gone out of it. Thereafter I started to notice that tireless and tirelessly were cropping up all over the place, often in works of considerable literary merit. In Jonathan Coes biography of the experimental novelist, for example, I read that B. S. Johnson worked tirelessly for the trade union movement. There was nothing particularly wrong with this particular instance, but the cumulative effect of encountering tirelesslys made me  taking my cue from Holmes again  wonder. Like a tired person trying to get to sleep who is kept awake by sounds from the street that he or she has for years scarcely noticed, I found that the word had become suddenly unignorable.

American troops are greeted on foreign soil as saviors and then quickly despised as occupiers. The United States triumphantly declares a victorious end to the war, even as bitter fighting continues.

There was no major player in American politics whom Mrs. Obama treasured more than Ted Kennedy. For most of her adult life, wherever he stood on public policy issues, she pretty much stood. The first lady ardently believed that Kennedys endorsement of her husband for the 2008 Democratic nomination had been a real act of courage, the straw that tipped the scales in his favor against Hillary Clinton. Recognizing Browns surprise win as a threat to her husbands entire health care initiative (the election cost Senate Democrats their supermajority), Mrs. Obama went scalp hunting. She blamed senior White House officials like Rahm Emanuel, David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs for the Massachusetts disaster  and her husband for not riding herd on them. She feels, President Obama sheepishly told aides, as if our rudder isnt set right. ",2012-02-17T16:16:18+0000

For a man of equanimity, Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham and lord of Downton Abbey, is surprisingly prone to fits of temper  nothing sparks his ire like an injustice done to a social inferior in his employ. You half-expect him to tear off his dinner jacket and reveal a spandex unitard as he rushes to succor an admiring serf. When a young woman accuses his footman of cowardice, the master leaps to the mans defense, chin quivering in righteous indignation. When his shellshocked interim valet tells him people look at him and wonder why hes not in uniform, the master bellows, You refer them to me and Ill give them a piece of my mind! Earlier, when Bates, his original, beloved valet, resigned without an explanation, the master reacted like a spurned lover, hurling threats and vitriol, only to collapse in a puddle of remorse and apologize for the low shot.

Armed with hook-shaped knives, Barrett and his party hack away at a grove of bare, shrublike trees called kozo, a Japanese relative of the common mulberry. At his nearby studio, which is housed in the former sanitariums laundry facility, the bundles of cut kozo are steamed in a steel caldron to loosen the bark. After the bark is stripped from the kozo, it is hung on racks, where it shrivels to a crisp over a matter of days. Eventually the bark is rehydrated and sliced apart from its middle, green layer, and that layer, in turn, is sheared from the prized inner layer. It takes about a hundred pounds of harvested kozo trees to yield eight pounds of this white bark, from which Barrett will ultimately make a few hundred sheets of what connoisseurs consider to be some of the worlds most perfect paper.",2012-02-17T16:57:37+0000

We were making camp on a training mission to set up an emergency medical station about six miles from the DMZ. A private in my platoon uncovered a Marine dog tag when digging to anchor a field hospital tent on a deserted hilltop, identified only by its height in meters. We dug a wide swath and found nothing else and turned in the tag to quartermaster graves registration the next day.

us,Who Made That Artificial Snow?,"Before humans conquered snowmaking, ski resorts relied on the vagaries of Old Man Winter. He was not always forthcoming. So in the dry Connecticut chill of 1949-1950, Walter Schoenknecht, the owner of the Mohawk Mountain ski resort, took matters into his own hands. He trucked in 700 tons of ice, recalled Arthur Hunt, a forefather of artificial snow, in a retrospective in Ski Area Management magazine. Schoenknecht subsequently had it chopped up and spread over a single slope. It was the first known use of fake snow on a ski slope. It also helped spark an idea. One Monday that March, Hunts colleague Wayne Pierce came up with a shrewder plan. He figured that a drop of water, propelled through below-freezing air, would turn into a snowflake, Hunt recalled. Along with Dave Richey, their partner in a ski factory, they slapped together a spray-gun nozzle, a 10-horsepower compressor and a garden hose into something of a D.I.Y. snow gun. They experimented with it all night. By morning, Hunt wrote, we had a 20-inch pile of snow over a diameter of 20 feet. The contraption was later used at Mohawk Mountain.",2012-02-17T16:59:19+0000

It was that same gift for empathy that made him such a good reporter. You could see it in his face as he stood in Tahrir Square or on the Tripoli seafront: his head tilted slightly and nodding, his dark eyes narrowed in focus as he listened to some young revolutionary. It was Anthonys sense of mission that set him apart, I think, and gave his temperament and his work a uniquely unselfish aspect. He wasnt in it to win prizes or lucrative desk jobs or to retail his adventures in a bar. He felt he had a duty to record the voices and emotions of Arabs as their world was unraveling. Where that sense of mission came from I do not know. But I was grateful for it.

Perot won close to 20 percent of the vote, and his success was instrumental in making deficit reduction one of Bill Clintons top priorities.

Few victories in American Olympic play have provoked reaction comparable to tonights decision at the red-seated, smallish Olympic Field House, wrote The New York Times. At the final buzzer, after the fans had chanted seconds away, fathers and mothers and friends of the United Sates players dashed onto the ice, hugging anyone they could find in red, white and blue uniforms.The Soviet hockey team was the dominant team of amateur international hockey. It won four straight gold medals from 1964 to 1976, nearly defeated a team of Canadas top professional players in 1972, and beat several N.H.L. teams in 1970s exhibition games.

In a nutshell, he suggests that the decline of marriage in the American working class doesnt necessarily reflect a social or an economic crisis. Rather, its a rational  and in certain ways, laudableresponse to an age of female empowermentand material abundance. In the current socioeconomic landscape, the sexes simply need each other less: Women are newly empowered and less dependent on male economic support, he notes, which has made them somewhat choosier about their mates; men, meanwhile, are less likely to do the hard work necessary to be solid marriage material because hard work is unpleasant, and its easier to lead a life of leisure than ever before. To a certain puritanical frame of mind that views toil as a virtue in and of itself, he writes, this may seem unfortunate, but leisure is one of civilizations great achievements: George Jetson, after all, only worked nine hours a week. Why should we aspire to anything less? Yes, the new order may be somewhat harder on children, but absent evidence of true social disintegration (soaring crime rates, collapsing educational attainment, riots in the streets),why not just look at progress and call it progress?",2012-02-22T20:22:36+0000
us,Vain Glorious | Phylia de M.,"Everyones hair has the potential to look amazing, says Kazu Namise of Phylia de M., the Los Angeles-based hair care brand she founded late last year. For anyone whos spent a lifetime abusing their mane via dye, diet and/or questionable styling techniques, that statement is as much a challenge as an affirmation. But Phylia de M. is hair care with a difference: its based on science, specifically research conducted by Namises godfather, oncologist Dr. Dick Miyayama, who dealt with his own impending hair loss by delving into the root cause (pun entirely intended) of the problem. What he found was that over time, the nerves that supply keratin (which is vital to hair health) to the hair become disconnected, which can lead to hair loss, thinning and dryness. But if you reconnect the nerves, then your hair is restored to good health, Namise explains. What makes the reconnection possible is Phylia de M.s proprietary blend of aloe, a powerful antioxidant; tannic acid, a plant-based reparative; and pure, humic-free fulvic acid (created by Miyayama), which provides vital keratin to cells and reminds them to perform at optimum capacity. This restorative triumvirate is the basis for all three Phylia de M. products, but is especially potent in the ultra-concentrated Connect spray, which has the power to transform even parched hair into the lush locks worthy of a romance novel heroine. And that, Namise says, is a promise.",2012-02-22T20:25:23+0000

In reality, the charming capital of West Flanders in northwestern Belgium is indeed tranquil, with swans gliding along medieval canals and cobblestone lanes dotted with lace shops and quiet cafes. But Bruges now has much more to offer. Ambitious restaurants are run by talented young chefs, and creative chocolate shops stock the confections of experimental chocolatiers. New and renovated museums are opening their doors and, after dark, local beer pubs offer mind-boggling selections of rare Belgian beers from the regions celebrated breweries. Hell? Hardly.",2012-02-23T16:11:55+0000

us,How to Be a European (Union) Philosopher,"One of the motivations behind the creation of the European Union was to assist in the social, economic and individual flourishing of citizens and workers who actually felt European regardless of their birthplace or current residence. Ive been told that I not only embody such citizenship  I was raised in Rome, Vienna and Geneva, studied philosophy in Turin and Berlin, and now work in Barcelona  but also present a model of a European Union philosopher (because I promote and teach continental philosophy). While as an E.U. citizen Im delighted we are all allowed to reside in all these beautiful cities of the continent, as a philosopher Im alarmed by the E.U.s ongoing existential exclusions  that is, its forgetfulness of being. Im not referring simply to a devaluation of the philosophers role in society, which is much more pronounced in other parts of the world, but rather something much more vital.When we speak of being from the existential-hermeneutic point of view, as those interested in philosophy well know, we are not referring to the factual existence of things but rather to the force of the people, thinkers and artists who generated our history. Thus, each epoch can be alluded to in the name that great philosophers have given to being in their work  act in Aquinas Middle Ages, absolute spirit in Hegels modernity, or trace in Derridas postmodernity. It is between being and nothing. But being also denotes how our existence is hermeneutic, in other words, a distinctive interpretative project in search of autonomous life. We exist first and foremost as creatures who manage to question our own being and in this way project our lives. Without this distinctiveness we would not exist; that is, our lives would be reduced to a predetermined subordination to the dominant philosophical or political system.",2012-02-24T02:15:18+0000

She greets one admirers expression of love by knocking him down, slams a door on anothers face during an argument, shoots an arrow at a panel of judges before the Games begin and threatens a mentor with a knife when he says something she doesnt like. In short, she belongs to a recent tribe of popular heroines: the small, difficult teenage girl who manifests enormous physical and moral strength.

The case involved a landowner who had been unable to get permission from local groundwater managers to use as much groundwater as he sought. Thomas Mason, a lawyer who specializes in water rights with the Austin firm of Graves Dougherty Heron & Moody, said the ruling was likely to prompt litigation by landowners wanting to sink more wells or draw more water than the local authorities had permitted. At the same time, he said, groundwater managers were less likely to be aggressive in enforcing limits on water usage. Texas has 96 groundwater districts. ",2012-02-25T00:50:17+0000

Act of Valor (Relativity Media) took in an estimated $24.7 million, as audiences responded to a marketing campaign that played up the SEALs angle; Bandito Brothers, a media company, financed the film at a cost of about $12 million. Tyler Perrys Mr. Deeds (Lionsgate) was second, selling $16 million in tickets, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. Mr. Deeds cost a bit under $15 million to make; among Mr. Perrys 11 films, only Daddys Little Girls in 2007 had a lower opening-weekend total; Lionsgate noted that the film had an uptick in sales from Friday to Saturday, a sign of positive word of mouth. Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (Warner Brothers) showed notable strength in its third weekend, taking in about $13.5 million for a new total of $76.7 million. Safe House (Universal) was fourth, selling about $11.4 million in tickets for a three-week total of $98 million, and The Vow (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was fifth, taking in $10 million for three-week total of $103 million. Two new releases flopped badly: Wanderlust, a comedy starring Jennifer Anniston and Paul Rudd that cost Universal and its partners about $35 million to make, took in just $6.6 million in eighth place; Gone, a thriller starring Amanda Seyfried that cost under $20 million to make, extended Summit Entertainments poor distribution track record for non-Twilight fare, placing ninth with $5 million in ticket sales.",2012-02-26T21:25:28+0000

To create a violet eye and plum mouth, she used Cl de Peau eye shadow in Pewter 118 and 116 Wine, while lips were covered in R10.
