Last week, in a news conference, President Carter called on a member of that commission to resign. Responding to a reporter's question, Mr. Carter said he had decided that David Gartner, confirmed by the Senate last  May after being appointed by Mr. Caner, should resign. The President confirmed more: Mr. Gartner had called the White House and said he declined to resign, and Mr. Carter did not believe he had the authority to fire him. What was Mr. Gartner's sin? Between 1975 and 1977, while working as an aide Senator Hubert Humphrey, he had accepted a gift of $72,000 worth of stock on behalf of his children from the chairman the ArcherDanielsMidland Company, a big grain firm whose business is partly regulated by the commission Mr. Gartner now sits on. He had told the White House this before being appointed, and told the Senate the same. Then, apparently, the White House changed the rules and now, Mr. Gartner said, if he were to resign it would look like an admission wrongdoing.

In 1975 was Jaws, in 1976 The Omen, in 1977 Star Wars. Grease is drawing thousands of John Travolta's young fans into the theaters, but how many of them will go on to the racks for Pocket Books's novelization remains to be seen (521,000 copies so far). NAL/Signet's Damien: Omen II has 1,650,000 copies out so far, but the pattern of its sales hasn't been particularly affected by the film's release. Bantam promoted its softcover version of Jaws 2 so expertly that it was a best seller long before the movie was on exhibit; now that the shark thriller is drawing long lines at the box office, the sales continue strong (nearly 4,000,000 copies).",1978-07-02T05:00:00+0000

But a long and complicated series of adventures lead them to witness beatings, slavery, warfare, an electrocution and a very bad experimental play. They also have occasion to explore the idea of infinity, think about what it means to be self-winding and generally ponder the philosophical condition of Toyhood.As expertly as this animated film has been directed (by Fred Wolf and Chuck Swenson), scored (by Roger Kellaway and Gene Lees) and, especially, written (by Carol MonPere, who adapted Russell Hoban's novel), 83 minutes is a long time for an adult to think about mice. And for children, many of the bleak, gray, rat-ridden settings may seem at least as scary as they are whimsical.Violence and destruction are often made to appear harmless enough in the world of animated films, a world in which characters can be squashed by boulders or run over by trucks and then trot away with nary a scratch. But here, the comic relief comes in the form of grown-up witticisms a young child won't necessarily understand. And the darkish backdrops, though artfully rendered, generate a cumulative gloom.Manny the Rat, the villain of the piece, has the wickedest front teeth in the garbage dump, over which he presides. He also has the voice of Peter Ustinov, all flourishes and rolling r's, to make him the most high-toned blackguard this side of Captain Hook. And the supporting cast, including a big green bird with theatrical pretensions (whose lines are spoken by Cloris Leachman) and a frog dressed as a giant white glove (played by Andy Devine), is correspondingly clever. A great deal of talent has gone into the making of a movie that may never find its audience  or may not have any audience to find.",1978-07-07T05:00:00+0000

Now Syria seems bent on using a new outburst of fighting among Christian factions as a pretext for destroying the Phalangists, perhaps in the hope of drawing the entire country under its control.

us,"'Viva Italia!,' Starring Vittorio Gassman, Returns to Day of Separate-Sketch Film:The Cast","""Viva Italia!"" is a cheerful attempt to revive the sort of European sketch film (""Love at Twenty,"" ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow,"" ""Boccaccio 70"") that was so popular in the 50's and 60's but slipped out of style (and public favor) in the 70's, as much because of the availability of the half-hour television drama as because the quality of the sketch films themselves declined.""Viva Italia!"" isn't likely to turn back any clocks, but it is so good-humored and, on balance, so entertaining that one feels like wishing it well. Of the film's nine episodes, four are very, very good and two are quite nice. The other three can be sat through without too much pain.The Italian movie, which opens today at the Paris, is the work of three directors  Dino Risi, Mario Monicelli and Ettore Scola  who, for reasons of modesty or maybe friendship, have declined to identify their individual contributions. It may be just as well. Of the three, only Mr. Scola (""We All Loved Each Other So Much,"" ""A Special Day"") has had any success here recently. Neither Mr. Risi (""The Easy Life,"" ""The Priest's Wife"") nor Mr. Monicelli (""The Organizer,"" ""My Friends"") has a distinctive style that would make it easy for anyone not a psychic to attach the director to his sketch.The three film makers, however, do share an amused, appreciative, sometimes jaundiced view of Italian life that fuses the parts into a charming entity. It's not by chance that each of the film's best sketches has a particularly national identity, if not as the Italians really are, then as Italians like to see themselves, especially in the persons of three of the country's finest actors, Vittorio Gassman, Alberto Sordi and Ugo Tognazzi.The three throw-away pieces are stateless, jokey stories that could as easily be French, Japanese or American.Largely because of their material, Mr. Gassman and Mr. Sordi dominate the movie, with Mr. Sordi starring in three of the four best sketches. The actor, whom you may remember in the early Fellini classic, ""The White Sheik,"" is supremely funny as a lecherous Papal aristocrat who, on his way to a dreaded family dinner, attempts to help a pedestrian who's been run over. Never has a noble been so ineffectually obliging.The rich fellow, a cartoon character of the sort Peter Sellers loves to play, drives an ancient Rolls-Royce that he describes as his ""itinerant living room"" (because the back seat is so handy for casual assignations). He also suspects (happily) that everyone he meets is either on his way to an orgy or going home from one, and he fusses constantly about ""the Lefevre schism,"" which he fears is the only thing his family will be able to talk about. He is, of course, oblivious to the death rattles of the injured pedestrian beside him.Mr. Sordi is also marvelous in the concluding sketch, a funeral that turns into a Fellini-esque celebration, and in the movie's most effectively moving episode, which is about a middle-aged son (Mr. Sordi) who cons his old mother (beautifully played by Emilia Fabi) into a freezingly efficient home for the elderly.Mr. Gassman has great fun with the role of a Cardinal of the church who, by force of his oratory (and such theatrical props as candles, bells and liturgical music), more or less neutralizes the reform-minded, socialist spirit of the members of a working-class parish, and as a waiter in one of those simple, rustic country restaurants that's become popular with the jet set. This sketch features a magnificent kitchen brawl between the waiter and his lover, the chef (Mr. Tognazzi) during which shoes get left in the minestrone, one combatant's toup is replaced by a large squid and a cigar goes into the stew. It's the kind of mayhem to warm any very small child's heart.The movie pretty much comes to a halt in a sketch about an Arab terrorist and an airline stewardess, in another sketch about a fellow whose wife has been kidnapped, and in one about a couple of actors being interviewed in connection with a porn film. None of them, though, is very long.",1978-07-09T05:00:00+0000

Last week, the news arrived from next to nowhere: The Cocos Islands, nearly on the equator about 1,600 miles west of Australia, are joining the modern world of national sovereignties and cash economies. The Australian Government announced that will pay John CluniesRoss, known as King of the Cocos, $7 million for the islands. Settled with Malay laborers by Mr. CluniesRoss great-great-grandfather 150 years ago, the islands were granted in perpetuity to his family by Queen Victoria in 1886. Since then, CluniesRosses have been the virtual monarchs over five and a half square miles of coconut palms, distributed over 27 islands in two atolls. The present Mr. CluniesRoss, sometimes called Ross V, succeeded at 16 when his father was killed by Japanese bombs. After the war, a United Nations factfinding mission visited the islands and described Mr. CluniesRoss rule as feudal and anachronistic, and no doubt it was, with Ross V, barefooted and bedaggered, exercising what authority got exercised. Britain formally transferred administration of the islands to Australia in 1955. Ross V, after years of rejecting Australian sovereignty, formally gave in in 1972 but retained title to the property. Now, after rejecting previous offers, he will cash in as well. The first thing Australia will have to do, apparently, is find out where Cocos is for sure and count the newborn democrats. News reports in the last few years have given the islands population at 490 (1972), 150 (1975), 500 (1975 again), 654",1978-07-09T05:00:00+0000

The writer and narrator is Robert Kee, who provides a clue to the success of the project. Remarkably well preserved for a man who will be 60 next year, Mr. Kee has been described by one lofty British publication as the most alert and learned of all television journalists. At the very least, on the basis of these four programs, he appears to be unusually competent. Born in Calcutta, he has had a busy journalistic career, including the position of correspondent for The Observer during the Suez crisis and, from 1972 to 1976, anchorman for the British commercial channel's lunchtime news. In the latter position, a press release notes, he built a huge following, particularly among housewives. Mr. Kee is also a historian, with a special interest in Ireland.

us,"Screen: 'Replay,' In French:Case of Amnesia","THERE is a taxi driver character in ""Replay,"" and oh! what a terrible time he has. His passenger is a high-strung sophisticate with no definite destination in mind, and with a tendency to leap frantically out of the cab without warning, forgetting all about paying her fare. ""Left? Right?"" asks the driver. The woman replies that she doesn't care. She is too desperate, too agonized to care, and the movie's premise depends upon the notion that hers is an interesting condition. This poor, exasperated cabbie has ample reason to think otherwise, though. So will poor, exasperated you.It seems that there has been a slow-motion automobile accident, one that landed Cecile (Marie-Jose Nat) in the hospital, swathed in bandages but with her mascara intact. When she awakens from her coma, she does not recognize Franois, her husband (Victor Lanoux). He, realizing that his wife has total amnesia, lumbers out to the hospital corridor and stares off into space. And she, understanding the extent of her predicament, begins to cry. She does this very photogenically, standing with her back against a wall and photographed in profile, wearing a black negligee. One arm is flung across her chronically furrowed brow.All too early in ""Replay,"" the director Michel Drach, establishes himself as a man of problematically refined tastes. Miss Nat's search for her true identity leads her to pretty sites all over Paris, and wherever she flees, she manages to do most of her running in the same ensemble of leather skirt and fur-trimmed coat, with a pair of shoes to match.It's certainly possible to make an effective romantic thriller while worrying about nice shots and just the right outfits, but Mr. Drach simply isn't the man for the job. When he wants to show that Cecile, who thinks she has run away from Franois, is actually being pursued by him, Mr. Drach positions the two of them on a beautiful, rain-drenched street, with Cecile walking briskly and Franois following alongside in his car. This is lovely to look at, but  since the street is otherwise deserted, and Cecile takes no notice of the car at her elbow  it does give one pause about the plot.Perhaps the convoluted story line is unimportant, since ""Replay"" is, au fond, a tale of amour. But Mr. Drach, in attempting to interweave two highly compatible genres, manages to make Cecile and Franois's love affair play second fiddle to the secret of Cecile's past. And the secret, when it is at long last revealed, merely serves to place everyone in a very unflattering light. This is hardly necessary, since Mr. Lanoux has been vaguely boorish throughout, and Miss Nat (who is actually Mrs. Drach) has been nothing but tiresome in her hysteria.Mr. Drach's premise, from a book by Dominique St. Alban, is not without intriguing possibilities, but the director's attention to cosmetic details is at odds with the sense of estrangement and rediscovery that is pivotal to the tale. And his heroine's amnesia, which ought to be the film's most compelling element, is simply one more gimmick in a movie that's overloaded with them.",1978-07-10T05:00:00+0000

For years and years films have been draining the theater of its best talents. Up pops a new playwright and, after a single hit, he's gone, never to return. Hollywood, or wherever it is they make pictures now, has claimed him, chained him. Along comes a new actor, trained in the theater's workshops and nursed along from one Off Broadway production to another until at last he lands big in the center of town, and, of course he's gone, too.

us,"Four Movies, Two for Children and Two From Abroad, Open:Screen: 'Bread and Chocolate'","WE COULD be in Elysium where it's always summer. We watch a boat with a pair of lovers laze its way across sun-bleached water. On shore, a family prepares to picnic on grass whose greeness is absolute. Nearby we see some friends stand self-consciously for a group photograph. The chamber music that scores this idyll is real. It's being supplied by a tense-looking quartet that sits on camp chairs and civilizes the landscape with sound.Everything is perfect until the arrival of an outsider. He is tall and well-built but, close up, he looks most peculiar. His face is aged but his hair is remarkably full and youthfully brown. There is something so unblemished about his skin, so dramatically dark about his eyebrows and mustache, he could be wearing make-up or  and this is the thought that occurred to me  he might possibly be dead. Is he the new arrival in Elysium who's not yet had time to unpack?The fellow sits down to listen to the music while he eats a sandwich. When he takes a bite, the chamber music group abruptly stops playing. The leader stares at him in disapproval. They can't play if he's going to eat in that fashion. He is clearly a fellow who's never given much thought to his manner of munching.This sequence, which opens Franco Brusati's new Italian film, ""Bread and Chocolate,"" is filled with mystery and a good deal of wit. Nino (Nino Manfredi), the fellow who has so rudely interrupted the concert on the lawn, has not died and gone to heaven, but he has wandered into a setting almost as unreal, at least to him.Nino, an immigrant worker from southern Italy, has made himself comfortable on the lawn of an elegant Swiss resort hotel where, most of the day and much of the night, he works as a temporary waiter. The hotel guests are people who travel through life first-class. Nino is forever steerage.In ""Bread and Chocolate,"" which opens today at the Baronet, Nino aspires to move upward in a world of rigidly fixed rules. The film is the picaresque tale of his attempts to fit into the life of a place that speaks a different language (German) and tolerates him only as long as he accepts the crumbs left on tables by a voraciously consuming, casually unfeeling society. The Swiss bourgeoisie loathe the invaders from the south.In one of the moments of clarity that the screenwriters impose on Nino from time to time (for our edification if not his). Nino says, in effect, there is bound to be friction when you have two million Italian workers in a nation of five million people.""Bread and Chocolate,"" which was written by Mr. Brusati, Mr. Manfredi and Iaia Fiastri, means for us to accept Nino as a tragicomic hero as he wanders, like a lead-footed Candide, into one hard-luck situation after another. He is wrongly accused of a child's sex murder (actually committed by a priest, who makes no effort to hide his guilt). He's later dischargedd from the hotel because he has urinated in the street in broad daylight.A millionaire Italian banker, who recognizes Nino's homesickness and befriends him, turns out to be an embezzler who loses all Nino's savings. In the film's most bizarre episode, Nino is taken in by a group of Italian immigrants who run an illicit chicken-plucking business. They live in a chicken coop and, so the movie indicates in a sequence that desperately needs the humor and discipline of Luis Bunuel, are quite happily turning into chickens.Through all this, Nino maintains a muddled optimism of the sort that has the effect of patronizing a character rather than illuminating it. Nino is patronized not only by the Swiss but also by the people who made the film.Neither Mr. Brusati nor Mr. Manfredi possesses the kind of overview of man and his society that would fuse the various comic and melodramatic episodes into a consistent whole. Instead of being shocking or moving or funny, their movie is sentimental.Mr. Manfredi, like his makeup, is much too obvious and mechanical an actor to be able to sneak up on us with something unexpected. Every scene is a confrontation between us and Mr. Manfredi's busy, pushy performance, which negates the character he plays and calls attention, instead, to the actor behind it.The script is not great. It wants to have several characters for the price of one. When it suits the convenience of the authors, Nino assumes a sort of bargain-basement, Chaplinesque innocence. At other times he must behave as one who is basically dim-witted. Then, too, he's a fellow who can question the gods.Innocence, especially, is being hustled here. The film reaches a low point in a drag show put on by Nino and two friends at the Italian workers' barracks. I think we are meant to be touched by the condition of these virtually stateless persons, but they have so much in the way of costumes, makeup and lighting that you might be reminded of an act at Reno Sweeney.Anna Karina has the film's few genuine moments as a young Greek woman, a teacher, who has come to Switzerland to make her fortune and who, briefly, is infatuated by Nino. There are many moments of promise  as when Nino attempts to pass for German by dying his hair blond  but Mr. Brusati and Mr. Manfredi, having had their inspiration, make no decent theatrical of it. They are all too knowing as film makers, but not especially interesting ones.",1978-07-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Spacelings:Earthbound Spacelings,"IF I WERE 10 again, I don't think I'd mind the fact that the space vehicle featured in the opening of ""Return From Witch Mountain"" looks like a flying pith helmet, or that the subsequent special effects are equally tinny.On the other hand, I think I'd very much enjoy watching telekinetically gifted kids from another planet applying their special powers to such earth-bound situations as car chases (when another vehicle gets in the way, they lift it) and fight scenes (they vanquish enemies with the flip of a flying garbage can). On balance, I think I'd be even more tickled by this Disney movie's abundance of mischief than tired by its emphasis on good, clean, freckle-faced fun.Two young spacelings, a cute boy and an adorable girl, are transported from Witch Mountain to the Rose Bowl, where their Space Uncle instructs them to ""have a lot of fun"" and ""never energize unless it's absolutely necessary.""They plan only an ordinary, Disneyland kind of visit to Los Angeles (""I can't wait to see the museums and go to all the concerts!"" the girl exclaims).But soon they are separated, and involved in all sorts of intrigue: Tia (Kim Richards) has been adopted by a harmless, good-hearted, perfectly interracial gang called the Earthquakes, and Tony (Ike Eisenmann) has been captured by Christopher Lee and Bette Davis, who play the gruesome twosome of the piece. Mr. Lee and Miss Davis mean to incorporate poor Tony into their plan to take over the entire world.Tony is brainwashed by the villains, and Tia sets out to rescue him, aided only by the Earthquakes and a very smart goat.Tia has been so nicely brought up, on whatever planet she came from in ""Escape to Witch Mountain,"" this film's predecessor, that she is forever thanking people, even  as when the goat does her a good turn  when it isn't exactly necessary. But her search for Tony affords the film some authentically hilarious moments, especially when the goat takes a taxi ride, and during an elaborate sequence in which the siblings wreak havoc with an Old West exhibit at a museum.The two young principals are serviceable, but not nearly as lively as some of their co-stars  Christian Juttner, as the tallest Earthquake, steals virtually every scene he doesn't share with Miss Davis or Mr. Lee.The material makes negligible demands upon the latter pair, but they manage to be agreeably wicked throughout. Mr. Lee's particular vice is supposed to be wild ambition; we know this because he dresses much more elegantly than the average megalomanic might. And Miss Davis's weakness is her greed, which she amply demonstrates with a series of dry asides.John Hough's direction, ungainly at its best, is occasionally downright cruel. Shooting snub-nosed kids from a low camera angle is not a very nice thing to do, and neither is shooting Miss Davis in close-up when her heavy makeup seems designed for long shots. She's supposed to look frightening much of the time, but there's such a thing as gallantry, too.",1978-07-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: More 'Bad News Bears',"""THE BAD NEWS BEARS Go to Japan"" is the third in the comedy series about the California baseball team with the pint-sized players who have dirty mouths and hearts of driven mush. The title tells only part of the story.The Bad News Bears, who last time out won their big game in the Houston Astrodome, do go to Japan and they do play some baseball, but most of the time they and their schlock promoter (Tony Curtis) are searching for material worthy of their raffish talents. The film is a demonstration of the kind of desperation experienced by people trying to make something out of a voyage to nowhere.Though this film was written by Bill Lancaster, who wrote the original ""Bad News Bears,"" produced by Michael Ritchie, who directed the first film, and directed by John Berry, who helped to make ""Claudine"" such a lark, ""The Bad News Bears Go to Japan"" has the appearance of a movie made by people who didn't know how, or who didn't care, or who possibly turned over their responsibilities to Japanese Airlines and the Japanese Tourist Bureau, whose principal interests are prominent among the screen images.Mr. Curtis plays a seedy agent named Marvin Lazar, a character who seems to be a comic valentine to Irving (Swifty) Lazar, one of Hollywood's most successful agents and most active legends. Marvin, after conning the Bears into going to Japan to make his fortune, is himself conned and conquered by the Bears who persuade him to go straight, which is just about the only road left open to a fellow whose credit cards have all been ceremoniously cut in two. When given a chance by the material, Mr. Curtis projects a picture of second-rate hucksterism that is all the more funny for being so blatantly rude and transparent.Of the original Bears remaining in the new movie, Jackie Earle Haley is perhaps best remembered as the little Bear who seemed old for his size and years but now, with his years and growth in size, he seems only a little old to be hanging around the Bears. A most attractive newcomer is 6-year-old Scoody Thornton, a small, incurably optimistic boy who persists in sticking up for Marvin when all the other Bears know him to be the failed scoundrel he is.A Japanese star, Tomisaburo Wakayama, plays the taciturn coach of the Japanese team and Dick Button appears in a comic cameo as himself as he describes a televised karate match entirely in figure-skating terms.""The Bad News Bears,"" which opens today at neighborhood theaters, isn't the sort of bad movie that angers you. It's sad in the way of something that's been abandoned. It deserved better from the people involved.""The Bad News Bears Go to Japan,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains most of the mildly vulgar language that was so popular in the first two ""Bears"" films.",1978-07-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"'The Swarm,' By Allen, Flies Onto Screens","Some day, African killer bees may wind up having the last buzz on us, but for the time being they simply aren't scary, at least not in Irwin Allen's ""The Swarm."" When Mr. Allen films large numbers of bees from afar, they look like clouds of nutmeg or, sometimes, like peculiarly chunky smog; up close, they suggest a naturalist's documentary about habits of the hive. A couple of times, Mr. Allen offers gigantic blowups of the bugs, in hopes of generating a ""Towering Antennae"" effect, but still the bees don't look as if they'd hurt a fly. Mr. Allen might just as well have devoted his talents to man-eating goldfish, poodles on the rampage or carniverous canaries.""Oh, my God  bees, bees, millions of bees!"" cries a helicopter pilot, who, needless to say, is not long for this world. The horde is headed for a sweet little town where the movie theater is playing ""The Towering Inferno,"" Mr. Allen's previous exercise in pre-fab pandemonium, and where the local drugstore must do land-office business selling hair spray to the schoolmistress, played by Olivia de Havilland. Once they arrive, the bees slaughter everybody they can get their stingers on.Mr. Allen stands to gain a great deal from the bloodthirstiness of his swarm, but there isn't much in it for the bees. We see a few bee's-eye point-of-view shots of innocent picnickers and the like, but their motives are never made clear. Are they out to avenge themselves on mankind? Michael Caine, playing the entomologist of the piece, hazards a guess or two, but nothing he says is helpful to Richard Widmark, as a general on Bee Patrol. ""I always credit my enemy, no matter what he may be, with equal intelligence,"" Mr. Widmark grimly observes. Because the military's first 10 or 12 schemes to outsmart the little devils are unsuccessful, Mr. Widmark's assessment sounds very fair.It could be argued that ""The Swarm"" is the surprise comedy hit of the season, what with Katharine Ross as a doctor, Mr. Allen's cutting to something noisy every time he doesn't know how to end a scene and exchanges like this one, as an attempt to poison the pests goes kerflooey:Entomologist Caine: ""They're not touching the pellets. They seem to sense it's something that will kill them.""Rival scientist Richard Chamberlain (worriedly): ""They're brighter than I thought.""Distinguished senior scientist Henry Fonda (knowingly): ""They always are.""There ought to be a word for what actors do in movies like this one; in fact, there probably is. In any case, players like Mr. Fonda and Mr. Caine manage to cooperate with the material without seeming compromised by it. Mr. Caine can apparently do anything, except give a bad performance.There are no black principals in the large, all-star cast. There are frequent references to ""the war against the Africans,"" by which the characters, of course, mean their battle with the bees. Nevertheless, it's a very unfortunate bit of phrasing.""The Swarm"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") for no discernible reason. The film contains no harsh language, very little romance, and only the mildest and phoniest-looking kind of violence.",1978-07-15T05:00:00+0000

I'm thinking of a tradition that begins with Pope's Rape of the Lock and extends through Thomas Love Peacock, Oscar Wilde, Ronald Firbank and Henry Green and that ends, implausibly enough, in America with W. M. Spackman and his splendid, recently published An Armful of Warm Girl. The distinguishing characteristics of the style of sublime silliness are its atmosphere of innocent romance and gorgeous effects, its tight design and economy of expression played off against an almost total absence of content.

Yet in spite of these attachments and his general popularity in this country, he is subjected to special visa restrictions. Although he won't say so himself, he feels that this bizarre situation is an insult to writers everywhere. At the same time, it occasionally produces comic side effects. Because of his friendship with Gen. Omar Torrijos, he was made a member of the Panamanian delegation that visited Washington to sign the Panama Canal treaty. The official plane landed at Andrews Air Force Base, and Garcia Mdrquez, who is a short and stocky man, gestured in the manner of Charlie Chaplin to show how he felt when he found himself being welcomed by the trumpet salute of an Air Force band as he stepped off the plane into this topsecret military enclave.",1978-07-16T05:00:00+0000

Worst of all, Mr. Blackmur questioned Freud, one of Mr. Bloom's principal authorities in his continuing systembuilding. Little wonder Mr. Bloom is upset.

us,Screen: Goldie Hawn in 'Foul Play':Jumping Hybrid,"COUNTLESS attacks are made on Goldie Hawn's life during the course of ""Foul Play,"" but she is clearly not in any real danger. When a midget tries to menace her, for instance, she simply picks up a broom and chases him around her apartment, eventually knocking him out a window. Later, feeling sorry about the incident, she goes to visit the poor traumatized midget in a hospital, and behaves so sweetly and contritely that she gives him an even worse scare.In another scene, when a thug makes the mistake of catching Miss Hawn by surprise, she greets him with the most adorably indignant little shriek the movies have witnessed in years. Miss Hawn often looks frightened, as befits the complicated suspense plot of ""Foul Play,"" but she even more often looks tremulously furious, and that's her secret weapon. Gloria, the librarian Miss Hawn plays here, may be so disarmingly dense she can't spot trouble brewing on the horizon, but once it arrives she's never too out-to-lunch to lose her temper. And her anger, imbued with all the quivering, outraged self-righteousness Miss Hawn can muster, is enough to make the most hardened villain or moviegoer melt.If Miss Hawn does a wide-eyed deadpan through most of the film, her costar, Chevy Chase, is correspondingly cool. ""Enjoy your dinner, there's nothing to worry about,"" says Mr. Chase's detective character reassuringly, having just crashed his car through the front window of a restaurant. ""Be careful, it's very slippery here,"" he warns Miss Hawn, as he escorts her to the houseboat that serves as his lair. No one familiar with Mr. Chase's career on television's ""Saturday Night Live"" need wonder which of them is about to fall into the drink.Miss Hawn and Mr. Chase meet very early in the film, looking bright and funny and all set to make beautiful music together. Accordingly, it's quite a surprise when ""Foul Play"" turns out to be more like a thriller than a comedy, and when neither performer is given much opportunity to cut loose. ""Foul Play"" is a slick, attractive, enjoyable movie with all the earmarks of a hit. But as ""House Calls"" did a few months ago, it starts out promising genuine wit and originality only to fall back on more familiar tactics after a half-hour or so. If either film had a less winning opening, perhaps it wouldn't leave a vague aftertaste of disappointment.Colin Higgins, who wrote and directed ""Foul Play,"" has aimed for the same kind of thriller-comedy-romance hybrid he attempted in writing ""Silver Streak,"" and this time he's much more successful. Parts of the film, like a few aerial shots at the beginning, that mean to recall Hitchcock do, and there are enough good scares to keep things jumping. Still, Mr. Higgins isn't a facile enough juggler to keep the film's diverse elements from colliding at times. The finale, with two lovers flanked by two corpses, surrounded by the cast of ""The Mikado"" and cheered on by a religious leader, is bewildering at the very least.Mr. Higgins's penchant for mixing visual elegance with coarse gags is equally ill-advised, especially because it makes him work the gags so hard. Dudley Moore, as a swinging single Miss Hawn unwittingly picks up in a bar, would have been a great deal funnier had Mr. Higgins decorated his bachelor pad with only half the sex-aid devices in the world, instead of all of them. Indeed, the soundtrack from ""Saturday Night Fever,"" which Mr. Moore slaps on the turntable the moment Miss Hawn walks in, would probably have been enough. Here and elsewhere, Mr. Higgins would have done well to demonstrate more confidence in both his actors and his audience.""Foul Play"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") because it contains several innocent love scenes and a modicum of violence.",1978-07-19T05:00:00+0000

Now they see cultural politics at work: Irishmen against Englishmen, Chicanos against WASPs, moralists against free thinkers, blacks against white.s, Catholics against Protestants, teetotallers against drinkers, and Yankees against white Southerners. Ethnic identity, religion, styles of life - these figure prominently in the newer histories, and they give us a strikingly new picture of the American past.

That is true whether one makes ice cream by the French or Neapolitan method (based on the cooked egg custard sauce, creme Anglaise) or by the American method, which consists merely of whipping and freezing pure heavy sweet cream with sugar and flavorings and which may include egg yolks.

us,Pink Panther Tries Revenge in 5th Film:For the Pun of It,"""THE REVENGE of the pink Panther,"" the fifth in the series of Inspector Clouzot comedies by Blake Edwards, the writer and director, and Peter Sellers, the star, drives a wooden stake through the heart of reason.If you have the Clouzot habit, as I have, there's very little that Mr. Edwards and Mr. Sellers could do that would make you find the movie disappointing, or not up to their own standards, or slow in spots, or, unfortunately, not as much fun as ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again,"" ""The Return of the Pink Panther,"" ""A Shot in the Dark"" or ""The Pink Panther.""Such comments are pointless when one has come to the realization that the ""Panther"" films are not separate entities but one continuing, effervescent saga about man (Inspector Clouzot) and his deficiencies.Clouzot rides (walks, stumbles, falls, trips) again in ""The Revenge of the Pink Panther,"" which opens today at the Ziegfeld and other theaters, and which provides Clouzot with all sorts of marvelously transparent excuses for physical bungling and for interfering with the progress of what he calls ""loowa"" and order.Once more on hand to complement and support Mr. Sellers are Burt Kwouk as Cato, his reliably unreliable, karate-chopping manservant, and the inestimably funny Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Dreyfus, Clouzot's former superior who's been driven mad by Clouzot's internationally acclaimed triumphs.Robert Webber plays it more or less straight as Clouzot's latest archenemy, an American business tycoon who deals in heroin. Most important of all, Dyan Cannon is around to play what might be called a flawed femme fatale, a person who, like Clouzot, has a tendency to bend  successfully  all the laws of nature. They are most winning sleuths, especially when, disguised as Chinese coolies, they register at a fancy Hong Kong hotel as Mr. and Mrs. Low Key.Horrendous puns, slapstick gags and disguises are the material of the comedy that, for no particular purpose that I can think of, has Clouzot, at one point and another, masquerade as a woman, a peg-legged sailor who carries an inflatable rubber parrot on his shoulder, and as Toulouse-Lautrec, a masquerade that prompts someone to say in admiration, ""Now you can work both the Left Bank and Montmartre in anonymity!""""The Revenge of the Pink Panther,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains one or two suggestive sequences that will go over the head of anyone less than three feet tall and 9 years of age.",1978-07-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Tatum O'Neal,"""INTERNATIONAL VELVET,"" Bryan Forbes's sequel to Clarence Brown's classic 1944 film, ""National Velvet,"" is a racking experience for any reasonably self-possessed adult, continuously pulling the viewer between a sneer and a tear.The film, which opens today at the Guild and other theaters, exploits without shame, wit or subtlety our sympathy for misunderstood children, for animals, for pluck, progress, perseverance and, especially, for against-all-odds success.The photography is so lyrical you may feel airsick by the end, while the soundtrack score by Francis Lai should be labeled with a skull and crossbones. After listening to this music for more than two hours, you get an idea of what it would have been like to be in Pompeii that fatal day had Vesuvius been full of butterscotch instead of lava.Yet ""International Velvet"" has more than its share of moments, almost all of them centering on the performance of the eerily talented, immensely appealing Tatum O'Neal, who was 14 years old when the film was made and, for the purposes of Mr. Forbes's fiction, ages (if that's the right word) from 10 to 18 in the course of the movie. She just may be a superlative actress. It's not easy to tell yet, though she seems to possess the sort of infinitely adaptable personality that film directors dream of. Her face, still in process of being formed, reflects degrees of feeling that transform the child into someone beyond identifiable age. She's unique.The movie is something else. Mr. Forbes's screenplay picks up the character played by Elizabeth Taylor in ""National Velvet"" about 25 years later (though the movie is very fast and loose with time), when the girl, now played by Nanette Newman (Mrs. Bryan Forbes), becomes the guardian of her orphaned niece, Sarah Brown (Miss O'Neal).The niece, a very large 10-year-old who's been raised in Arizona, arrives in England with a chip on her shoulder that can be removed only by an obsessive interest in horses and by the love and understanding of her aunt and Christopher Plummer, the writer Miss Newman lives with.Whereas Velvet won her nickname by winning the Grand National steeplechase as a girl, Sarah becomes International Velvet by being the youngest member of the British Olympic riding team.As domestic drama, ""International Velvet"" is facetious and coy and just about unbearable. Miss Newman and Mr. Plummer have silly roles that they play with a kind of provincial sophistication, which may be what the director wanted (since nothing in this film is uncalculated). As a movie about a girl, her horse and the big race. ""International Velvet"" sneaks up on you in unexpectedly moving ways.The steeplechase sequences are superb and the film has a first-class performance by Anthony Hopkins as the tough, no-nonsense trainer of the Olympic riding team. Mr. Hopkins is an actor of such crisp intelligence that he seems to be in a movie completely removed from the sentimental romantic drama inhabited by Miss Newman and Mr. Plummer. It's to Miss O'Neal's credit that she moves from one to the other not only without visible strain but with (dare I say womanly?) ease.",1978-07-19T05:00:00+0000

Frozen desserts in the form of water ices were thus  according to that exotic account  established in Italy.

us,Screen: Son of 'Sgt. Pepper':Many Forms Involved,"IS IT A film? Is it a record album? Is it a poster, or a T-shirt, or a specially embossed frisbee? ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" is the ultimate multimedia mishmash, so diversified that it doesn't fully exist in any one medium at all. This isn't a movie, it's a business deal set to music.There are three brief sequences good enough to put the rest of the picture to shame. Steve Martin, cackling his completely unhinged rendition of ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer,"" is a reminder that the film is otherwise humorless. Billy Preston, doing a flashy, rousing dance to the tune of ""Get Back,"" makes the other hoofers look sadly two-left-feet. And Aerosmith, singing a piercing rock version of ""Come Together,"" bring a taste of the 60's to a movie dead-set on both exploiting and soft-pedaling that era.The point behind turning Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees into the Beatlesque band of the title was, presumably, to lure both young rock fans and members of the rocking chair set. But the plan has its drawbacks.However much of a fan rave Mr. Frampton may be, he's a musician, not a movie star, and even a plot that merely requires him to look sad, peppy or joyful from time to time is more than he can manage.In the role of Mr. Frampton's brother, Paul Nicholas, the actor who played nasty Cousin Kevin in ""Tommy,"" provides a particularly unhelpful contrast, since he is every bit as lively as the singer is stiff. Still, Mr. Frampton looks like Marlon Brando beside the even more wooden Brothers Gibb.Even if the Bee Gees aren't natural-born cutups, their principal job here is to perform a number of Beatles songs, mostly from the title album and ""Abbey Road.""This sounds as if it ought to be child's play, in view of arrangements and production by George Martin (who worked with the Beatles in the first place), and considering the uncanny way the Bee Gees first rose to popularity by perfecting a Beatlish sound. However, the brothers have since risen to even greater popularity doing something different, so different that their newest fans may be dismayed to find not a whit of disco in the movie's soundtrack. And their Beatle numbers vary dramatically in quality, depending upon the nature of the particular song.""Nowhere Man"" suits them beautifully, for instance. But a less pretty number requiring zest and a strong lead singer  such as the title song, or ""With a Little Help From My Friends,"" both sung with Mr. Frampton  merely makes them sound short on character. The Bee Gees's special gift for elaborate musical teamwork is often undercut by songs that cry out for individual personalities. Accordingly, Robin Gibb's bluesy solo on ""Oh! Darling"" is a sweet and surprising exception.The musical numbers are strung together so mindlessly that the movie has the feel of an interminable variety show. Characters are named, invented or introduced to one another simply to provide excuses for the various songs.This reaches a pinnacle of idiocy when a character named Strawberry Fields (Sandy Farina) sings ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" to her beau, Billy Shears (Mr. Frampton), who has been knocked unconscious. ""Living is easy with eyes closed/Misunderstanding all you see,"" Strawberry sings, prettily but for absolutely no good reason. Even worse, when the screenplay has Strawberry killed (temporarily) so that a few sad songs can be sung, Mr. Frampton is obliged to croon ""Golden Slumbers"" to a woman in a see-through coffin.The movie may have been conceived in a spirit of merriment, but watching it feels like playing shuffleboard at the absolute insistence of a bossy shipboard social director. When whimsy gets to be this overbearing, it simply isn't whimsy any more.""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). Its most risque moments, having to do with the morals and drug habits of people in the record business, are among its few funny ones.",1978-07-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Buddy Holly Story':Tale of Rock Star,"THERE are a lot of actors in ""The Buddy Holly Story""  some of them very nice  but the movie is really a one-man show. It's Gary Busey's galvanizing solo performance that gives meaning to an otherwise shapeless and bland feature-length film about the American rock-and-roll star who was killed in a plane crash in 1959.The film, which opens today at the Criterion and other theaters, was made with the cooperation of Holly's widow, Maria Elena Holly, and may be a demonstration of why keepers of the flame are not the best people to have around when you're making a movie""The Buddy Holly Story"" has a story of sorts, but it's a B-picture plot with all of the crises and villains discreetly removed, about the virtually unimpeded rise to the top, within three years, of a nice, gawky kid from Lubbock, Tex., who could express himself only through his music.Buddy Holly was not Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. What he expresses are not the contradictory impulses of a society of rare sophistication, but the pounding lusts and comic heartbreaks of people who have trouble dealing with any gratification not instant.It may be argued that the film, written by Robert Gittler and directed by Steve Rash, reflects the essential simplicity of Holly's music, but that, I think, is to confuse simplicity with lack of technique, which is the manner of the film. Holly's music  including the dozen songs (""That'll Be the Day,"" ""Well Alright,"" ""Every Day,"" among others) that are reprised in the movie  is not especially complex but it expresses a kind of youthful vitality that has nothing much to do with the conventions of dopey movie making.Which brings us to Mr. Busey, who's already been seen in ""The Last American Hero,"" ""Thunderbolt and Light-foot"" and, most recently, in ""Straight Time,"" as Dustin Hoffman's junkie pal. Mr. Busey, tall and slightly awkward, a fellow whose teeth appear to have been grown and not styled, has the look of middle America all over him. He's also capable of making articulate a character who remains inarticulate except in his music. He's not only an actor who possesses a center of gravity  of intelligence  but he's also a pop musician (professional name: Teddy Jack Eddy) who understands the mysterious (to the rest of us) transformation that takes place during a performance.Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith (""American Grafitti"") are effective and functional as Buddy Holly's two hometown pals who accompany him to stardom. Maria Richwine plays the Puerto Rican girl he marries, Gloria Irricari is her skeptical, watchful aunt (who doesn't trust musicians), and Paul Mooney, Gilbert Melgar and George Simonelli show up as some of the other rock stars (Sam Cooke, Richie Valens and Dion) whose careers crossed that of Holly.Although ""The Buddy Holly Story"" can't be classified as a musical, it's a movie that comes alive only during the musical sequences, and these sequences, featuring Mr. Busey's transformed country-boy, are so good, so full of energy, they turn the material that frames them into wood.""The Buddy Holly Story,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains some mildly vulgar language.",1978-07-21T05:00:00+0000

American television is simply incapable, as currently constituted, of producing a series on the level of Frederick Raphael's The Glittering Prizes (seen here recently on Channel 13). One obvious reason is that British programming executives actually have considerable experience in programming. Their American counterparts are too often refugees from sales or research departments.

us,Screen: 'Animal House':Daffy Deltas,"IT'S Rush Week of 1962 at Faber College, where ""Knowledge Is Good"" was the founder's most memorable witticism. The classiest fraternity on campus  the one to which the editor of the Daily Bavarian belongs  is wowing potential pledges with an elaborate show of gentility and a pianist who can play ""Tammy."" But right next door, at the eyesore that is the Delta House, something a little less civilized is going on.The Deltas are the kind of guys who bash beer cans against their foreheads, wheel their dates home in shopping carts and think they know the words to ""Louie, Louie,"" which they will sing in off-key unison at less than the slightest provocation. Needless to say, they will not be having a very good year. The brother who racks up a 1.2 grade point average will be the brightest of the bunch, and the house Romeo will be reduced to gearing his visits to a nearby girls' school to the obituary notices. Pretending to be the grieving fianc of a dead coed is evidently a successful, if pitiable, gambit.""National Lampoon's Animal House"" is by no means one long howl, but it's often very funny, with gags that are effective in a dependable, all-purpose way. The movie works hard to supply something for the broadest possible audience, instead of aiming only at the viewer who'd like to watch John Belushi  as the Delta who knows the fewest words of more than one syllableeating Jell-O with his fingers.""Animal House"" is too cheerfully sleazy to be termed tame, but the film makers have been smart enough to leaven each gross-out with an element of innocent fun. Even the action-packed finale amounts to nothing more dangerous than the spectacle of all heck breaking loose.Except for Mr. Belushi, who mugs like crazy and spills a wide variety of substances all over himself, the actors tend to be as clean-cut and dopey as the movie's setting. Tim Matheson is a particularly self-congratulatory Joe College who whistles ""Peter and the Wolf"" as he loiters in a women's dorm; Stephen Furst does some very successful scene-stealing as the house blimp.And Thomas Hulce is appropriately dim playing the first guy in the frat to be offered a reefer, by the obligatory hyper-hip English professor (Donald Sutherland, in a throwaway role). ""O.K., so that means our whole solar system could be one tiny atom in the fingernail of some other giant being,"" Mr. Hulce postulates, while under the influence. Then he breaks out in uncontrollable giggles.At its best, in moments like this, the movie isn't strictly satirical, because it doesn't need to be. The film makers have simply supplied the appropriate panty-girdles, crew-neck sweaters, frat-house initiation rites and rituals of the toga party, and let all that idiocy speak  very eloquently, and with a lot of comic fervorfor itself.",1978-07-28T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Driver' Takes a Rocky Road:No Names, Please!","HE drives getaway cars, so he's called The Driver. The man who's obsessed with catching The Driver is a member of the police force. He's called The Detective. The young woman who's hired by The Driver to be his alibi when The Detective attempts to frame The Driver is called The Player, probably because when we first see her she's in a gambling casino, playing five-card stud.There are a lot of other people in ""The Driver"" (hereafter referred to as The Movie), including phantoms with names like The Connection, Red Plainclothesman, Gold Plainclothesman, Glasses, Teeth and The Kid.The movie, which opens today at neighborhood theaters, was written and directed by Walter Hill, who once wrote and directed a good movie, ""Hard Times,"" with Charles Bronson. This one is not good. It is Awful Movie. It is Pretentious Movie. It is Silly Movie. It talks just like this.According to the program notes, Mr. Hill thinks he is getting at ""the muscle, the sinew, the tissue, the very nerve center of a getaway driver."" It doesn't work, though. By stripping away the individual idiosyncracies, Mr. Hill simply lays bare The Clich, and The Clich is Horrendous, if sometimes horrendously funny.Ryan O'Neal plays The Driver, who is supposed to be to getaway driving what Matisse was to scissors and colored paper. Not so. The Driver always does too much. He's too fancy. He's to getaway driving what Edgar Guest was to poetry. He doesn't know when to stop. Truly.He couldn't put his car into a parking lot without attracting the attention of the sleepiest traffic cop. All those screaming accelerations, those two-wheel turns and those brake-slammings have less to do with effective getting away than with random self-expresssion. Having no role to act, Mr. O'Neal seems bewildered.As The Detective, Bruce Dern snarls a lot, more or less repeating the rabbit-toothed psychotic he played in ""Black Sunday"" and ""Coming Home,"" an unreliable fellow full of distress and possibly an upset stomach. Isabel Adjani, in her first (and possibly last) American film (Hollywood doesn't like a loser) is The Player, a beautiful young woman who means to be mysterious but more often may remind you of the trick-turning Barnard girls in Woody Allen's classic sketch, ""The Whore of Mensa.""She wears her mouth turned down at both ends and generally affects the world-weary manner of a jaded complit student who's been through it all  Cather, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Dos Passos, Irwin Shaw and Harold Robbins.For a movie in which there are so many chases. The Movie is singularly unexciting and uninvolving, though it does have its laughs.I'm fascinated by Mr. Hill's way of emphasizing the peak emotional moment in a scene by having one character talk intently to the back of another character's head. And he must mean us to break up when Miss Adjani, trying to sneak into a busy railroad station to fetch a satchel full of stolen loot, appears wearing a black costume of such arresting style she'd stop the music at Studio 54.Ronee Blakely, nominated for an Oscar after her fine performance in ""Nashville,"" appears to no particular purpose in the throwaway role of The Connection, The Driver's business agent.

us,Screen: 'Big Wednesday' Gets Caught in Some Rough Surf:Buddyhood of Surfing,"IT wasn't very long ago that John Milius's expensive, ambitious ""Big Wednesday"" was one of the more widely touted movies on the horizon, so what's it doing sneaking into Flagship theaters for only a weeklong run? The honorable thing, that's what. ""Big Wednesday"" isn't even a tiny fraction of what it was once cracked up to be.The surprise is not that Mr. Milius has made such a resoundingly awful film, but rather that he's made a bland one. Mr. Milius's reputation, after all, rests at least as heavily on his well-publicized walk-softly-and-carry-an-elephantgun world view as it does on his several screenplays and his direction of ""Dillinger"" and ""The Wind and the Lion."" So one might have supposed that ""Big Wednesday,"" his epic about surfing and buddyhood, would have boasted at least enough trigger-happy machismo to make it controversial.True, ""radical"" is something of a dirty word in the screenplay Mr. Milius co-wrote with Dennis Aaberg. And Jan-Michael Vincent, as one of the three legendary surfers a narrator describes as ""the big names, the kings, our own royalty,"" has a strident hippie-baiting scene during the segment of the film that's set in 1968. Mr. Vincent, outraged to find that his favorite hangout now serves organic food instead of cheeseburgers, and that a waiter in a butterfly-patterned undershirt keeps calling him ""brother,"" douses the incense on his table with water and cautions the waiter to turn down the music.This, plus a scene that shows the three surfers quietly watching the Watts riots on television, is about as much of a nod ""Big Wednesday"" cares to give the real world.But it's not just the film's rapt attention to wave patterns that makes it so emphatically all wet. Mr. Milius's three adventurers, whom we watch over the course of 12 years and still never get to know, have an unbecoming horror of growing up, not just of growing old. ""It's really different here,"" gushes a girl from Chicago who is just becoming initiated to the glories of beach life in L.A. ""Back home, being young was just something you'd do until you grew up. Here . . . it's everything!""Being young means different things to our three respective heroes. For Leroy (Gary Busey), it's a chance to experience the joys of painting his torso with what looks like barbecue sauce and then trying to crawl into an oven. For Jack (William Katt), it's going to Vietnam for three years and then coming home expecting an old girlfriend to be a current girlfriend, even though he hasn't kept in close enough touch with her to find out she's now married. For Matt (Mr. Vincent), it means saying everying he needs to say through very careful flexing of the neck and the nostrils.For all of them, being young means acquiring a kind of oral history of wavesmanship from a senior surfer named Bear. Bear tells his biggest, saddest story at a party early in the film, after everyone has finished pouring beer on everyone else's head. He tells his much too solemn audience about a time when ""the water was hittin' the cliffs and splashin' 100 feet high  it was like the end of the world."" A surfer disappeared that day, and ""they never found his body  they just found little pieces of his board.""The movie often seems even more uneventful than material like this need make it, and Mr. Milius's attention to his actors focuses more closely on their pectorals than on their performances. He encourages such stiffness in his players that Barbara Hale, for instance, is quite unconvincing as Mr. Katt's mother. This is a faux pas of no mean eminence; after all, Miss Hale actually is Mr. Katt's mother.The score for the film includes a number of hit songs from the early 60's, which makes the absence of any ""surf music"" of that period worth noting. Surely the Beach Boys or Jan and Dean were just as deeply in love with the sport as Mr. Milius, and for them, too, it had connotations of masculine daring. However, it also had a spirit of fun. And there's no room for real levity or pleasure in Mr. Milius's grim, dispirited and too often incoherent scheme of things.""Big Wednesday"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") apparently because its characters pranks tend to be violent, and their language slightly rough.",1978-07-28T05:00:00+0000
