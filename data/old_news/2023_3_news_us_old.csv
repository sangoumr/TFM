The act of recovery means something different now, says Kenton Rambsy, an associate professor of English and digital humanities at the University of Texas at Arlington, whose research uses data analytics to tell new stories about the Black literary past. Sometimes recovery demands peering into the shadows cast by towering canonical figures. It might mean finding that writer who is just being overlooked because of the canonicity of, say, Toni Morrison, Rambsy says. Sometimes its even simpler than that. We dont have to go deep into archives to find undervalued Black authors, says the poet and U.C.L.A. English professor Harryette Mullen.

Their goal was to amplify Black voices, critique their exclusion from art history and draw attention to the racism they experienced as children of Caribbean migrants in conservative Britain. Claudette Johnson, born in Manchester in 1959, and studying at Wolverhampton Polytechnic at the time, joined the Blk Art Group soon after its formation and began working and exhibiting alongside her fellow members Eddie Chambers, Keith Piper, Marlene Smith and Donald Rodney. The Black arts community that I became a part of in the 80s was invaluable. It gave me people to talk to about my work. It made me feel a part of a movement, says Johnson. There was definitely a belief that we were going to change things. That we were shaking things up. But despite this fervent start, the spotlight soon faded and the groups contribution to contemporary art became largely overshadowed by the provocations of the Young British Artists, the loose affiliation that included Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin. We just couldnt fit in in the way the Y.B.A.s could, Johnson says.",2023-03-09T20:48:36+0000

With smidgens of oat fiber and chick pea flour, plus vegetable and fruit extracts for color, the Boulder, Colo., company has created white meat cutlets  with and without breading  that easily pass for boneless chicken breast.

The steak rendition, a disk thats ready to sear and comes pre-seasoned, is an adequate mimic but could benefit from the addition of some fat. The protein content is around 15 grams per serving, the fiber around eight. The products are used at several Momofuku restaurants: in New York at Noodle Bar as a crispy cutlet with hot honey and chili crunch, at Ssam Bar in pieces with gochujang glaze, and in Los Angeles at Majordomo in a larb salad.",2023-03-20T20:50:52+0000

Labyrinths and mazes have appeared across cultures and time, made by digging ruts into the soil, laying out rock or mosaic or enclosing paths within hedges, walls, bamboo, corn and mirrors. The first recorded labyrinth dates to the 19th century B.C., built by Egyptians near the ancient city Arsinoe to hold the sepulcher of kings and crocodiles. In the desert of Peru, the Nazca dug winding geoglyphs in the shape of birds, flora and monkeys; some of them were thought to be traversed by gods and spirits, by priests and pilgrims during ceremonies. Rock-lined labyrinths along the coasts of the Baltic Sea may have been created in the Bronze Age. Surviving lore suggests they were used in spring pagan dances and light exorcisms, trapping malevolent spirits in their confounding geometry. And of course, one of the most enduring myths of ancient Greece is that of the Minotaur lying in wait at the center of the maze.",2023-03-22T09:00:50+0000

The sculpture referenced the bronze Statue of Freedom (designed by the sculptor Thomas Crawford and fabricated by enslaved laborers) perched atop the dome of the U.S. Capitol since 1863, while sinking it into the earth. Rather than destroying a cherished American symbol, Williams was once again staging its decomposition  now in a larger sense and in view of the public. I hate to use the word magic, Williams says.

Born in 1957, Ai grew up during the Cultural Revolution in China, a time when the government, as he puts it, went to great lengths to erase evidence of the past that might contradict its rule. Now based in Portugal, the artist says that ruins are slices of history that are essential to human development. Every advance is built on failures, he explains. Its only through these fragments that we have the possibility of redefining history. As its title suggests, the show will encourage people to make sense of these objects, which are strewn across the Design Museums floor alongside Stone Age tools and Lego bricks that Ai has collected over the years. While viewers explore the exhibition, Ai wants them to question what they value and why. Sculptures of toilet rolls  mundane objects that became almost sacred during the pandemic  cast in marble and glass should bring home the point.
