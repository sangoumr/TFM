There she gathered a historical perspective of the nuns in the days of Maria Von Trapp. She learned that in the atmosphere at Salzburg Abbey, carved into the side of a mountain in 1741, ''nuns were not solely concerned with quiet meditation, but also occupied themselves restoring frescoes in the abbey, making pottery on the kick-wheel and using hand building techniques with molds.''",1998-03-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Raiders of the Lost Codex,"Patricia Finney's intricate novel, as carefully laid out as a Renaissance knot garden, tells a tale of intrigue, corruption and (occasional) true innocence at Queen Elizabeth I's roiling royal court. UNICORN'S BLOOD (Picador, $25) centers on a book whose blue velvet cover is wrought with a white-and-silver unicorn with a ruby for an eye. Rumored to be in the possession of a former nun, the so-called Book of the Unicorn is said to contain the 14-year-old future ''Virgin'' Queen's confession of her affair with Lord Admiral Thomas Seymour, her subsequent abortion and, most empire-upheavingly, her naming of Mary Queen of Scots as heir. Many courtiers and Roman Catholic foreign powers are lusting for the book, the better to unseat Elizabeth, and she herself is understandably desperate to recover it. The resulting scramble involves, among others, Sir Philip Sidney and his sword-master, an undercover priest, the Queen's secretary and her royal fool (a midget named Thomasina), and the chase unfolds in such varied precincts as the Tower of London, a bawdy house and even, most rankly, the royal sewage chambers. Swiftly moving and deftly woven, this courtly tale is as engrossing as it is improbable -- and thus all the more delightful. Julie Gray",1998-03-01T05:00:00+0000

After all, some leftist critics contend that Babar, Queen Celeste and their royal entourage symbolize European imperialism. (One angry book from this school is called ''Should We Burn Babar?)

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Head for Heights,"A kaleidoscopic panorama of sky, stone, glass and steel, striated with film noir shadows and the glint of sunlight: It's a view of New York City more familiar to first-time visitors than to harried locals, most of whom wouldn't be caught dead craning their necks in appreciation of what soars above them. With unabashed enthusiasm, the German photographer and Manhattan resident Horst Hamann celebrates New York's loftiest sphere in NEW YORK VERTICAL (Te Neues Publishing, $98). For Hamann -- with his panoramic camera tipped 90 degrees, his apparent fearlessness of heights and his infatuation with what the journalist Volker Skierka calls, in the book's introduction, the fifth compass point (''upwards, above and beyond'') -- the vertical perspective was an obvious one. Indeed, flipping through the 66 black-and-white depictions of the stark, distorted geometry of New York's upper regions, one wonders why such a collection hasn't been compiled before. Here are the famous landmarks -- the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, Trinity Church -- looking as if they have just been launched into ''vertical infinity.'' And here, also, are the anonymous places: the Brooklyn Bridge as viewed from a desolate corner; a nondescript building on Bond Street in Manhattan, sprayed with graffiti and accompanied by an artist's lonely words (''In the last 12 months, many of my friends have advised me to leave New York''). All the photographs are set off with observations from Woody Allen, E. B. White and other writers, artists and working people. Together, the quotations and photographs manage to convey with tension and eloquence the obvious but unavoidable metaphor inherent in such a thematic treatment of New York. The skyscrapers, the bridges, the not-so-grand buildings are nothing if not the architectural embodiment of the vertiginous passions that define life in the vertical city.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Otherworldly Stories,"In ''The Brew,'' a powerful story from Karen Joy Fowler's new collection, BLACK GLASS (Marian Wood/Holt, $23), a woman stands in a hotel lobby staring at an aquarium. ''Sometimes,'' she tells herself, ''we can find a smaller world where we can live, inside the bigger world where we cannot.'' Other worlds, worlds within worlds, shifting realities -- all these inform Fowler's highly imaginative short fiction. In the title story, a zombie terrorizes the United States in the form of Carry Nation, and this gigantic hatchet-wielding Amazon becomes the obsession of Patrick Harris, an undercover Federal drug agent. A Christ story involving a 15-year-old boy unfolds in 17th-century Japan in ''Shimabara.'' ''The Elizabeth Complex'' assembles a composite life story from those of formidable figures like Lizzie Borden, Elizabeth Taylor and Elizabeth I. In ''Duplicity,'' two American women are taken captive by noseless aliens in the Brazilian rain forest. And in ''The View From Venus: A Case Study,'' Venusians analyze the romantic practices of college-age students in Berkeley in the late 1960's. More earthly but equally inventive narratives include ''Contention,'' which describes a housewife's loneliness; ''Go Back,'' in which a young girl discovers her father's infidelity; and ''Letters From Home,'' an affecting meditation on what became of the narrator's boyfriend in Vietnam. There is much that is fantastical about Fowler's fiction, but also much that is rooted in a solid emotional reality; in fine-edged and discerning prose, she manages to re-create both life's extraordinary and its ordinary magic.

us,Bear Facts,"In BEARS!, a National Geographic Explorer special, the veteran host of the series, Boyd Matson, introduces three separate stories of the fearsome beasts while Coco, a brown bear, toys with his hand like a domestic pet. The first story, ''Lights! Camera! Bears!,'' focuses on the Seus family , who train animals for television and movies -- most famously, that scene stealer Bart (above with Doug Seus), who upstaged his co-stars Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins in the 1997 film ''The Edge.'' The second story, ''Realm of the Great White Bear,'' is David Wright's paeon to polar bears, from the moment twin cubs emerge from their den to blink in the icy glare until they're almost ready to face life alone at age two. Narrated by Keith David, the story was filmed on the island of Svalbard, halfway between Norway and the North Pole, and captures surprisingly tender maternal moments as the mother teaches the cubs to observe their icy world. But don't be fooled by the apparent docile nature of a bear, warn the rangers at Montana's Glacier National Park; they can run 35 miles an hour and kill within seconds if they are scared or surprised. This is made chillingly clear in the final story, ''Bear Attack,'' through accounts of survivors and filming of grizzlies in the wild -- SUNDAY at 7 and 11:05 P.M. and SATURDAY at 10 A.M. on TBS.

No Werewolves?,"Americans ''twixt 12 and 20'' have been driving their parents crazy since the days of George Washington -- in the 1770's, according to Michael Barson and Steven Heller, unmarried couples were criticized for ''irregular night walking, frolicking and keeping bad company.'' With color images as in-your-face as the average adolescent, TEENAGE CONFIDENTIAL: An Illustrated History of the American Teen (Chronicle, paper, $16.95) takes a multimedia look at the teen-age subculture since World War II. Examining advertising artwork, magazine articles, paperback book covers, movie posters and romance comics, this lively and well-researched retrospective suggests that ''the more things change, the more they remain the same.'' For American teen-agers, music (from Frank Sinatra to Elvis Presley and the Beatles) has always been a catalyst, the opposite sex an often heart-wrenching mystery, and parents there to rebel against. In ''a masterful display of bifurcated vision,'' the mass media promoted the ''Kleen Teen,'' as embodied by the redheaded, bow-tied comic book hero Archie Andrews and immortalized on movie screens by Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, even while sounding the alarm with dire warnings of juvenile delinquents on the rampage. Magazine exposes, dime novels and low-budget films fanned the flames of parental panic side by side with their coverage of saddle shoes, sock hops and slumber parties. Magazines like Teen Life addressed ''Kissing . . . Petting . . . Going Steady'' while instructional films tackled subjects like ''What to Do on a Date.'' Love comics flourished throughout the 50's and 60's, ''offering pithy lessons on dating behavior that teens could ignore at their own peril.'' ''Teenage Confidential'' is a wryly nostalgic trip back to the future, a tribute to ''the way we were . . . when we weren't in detention, that is.'' Leslie Chess Feller",1998-03-08T05:00:00+0000

us,"Our Memories, Our Selves","The question that actors find most irritating is, ''How did you learn all those lines?'' It's irritating because memorizing, for the actor, is the most pedestrian of all the acting tasks, and certainly no indicator of talent. But acting is the one profession in which rather incredible feats of memory are all in a day's work. In reading Hall's article, it occurred to me that quite a few of the actor's challenges offer a perfect canvas for scientific study. For example, Hall writes that in 1885 a German psychologist ''discovered that he could memorize a list of nonsense syllables much better if he spaced out the learning sessions with a rest interval'' rather than ''repeating the drill over and over without a break.'' This is something that actors know, too. Also, memorizing happens even faster if the lines are learned in tandem with the physical blocking of the play.

We serve very upscale business travelers. We have very intellectual drinkers. Our guests like old fashioneds and martinis. I always introduce the guests to each other at the bar because everybody in the world has something in common. They had a bad day, they missed their plane, the weather was bad, they hate their boss. And business: What's your business? What's my business? They find something to talk about. For a couple of days it was the Clinton affair, but everyone just figures, it's his business.

She asked if the passenger knew my wife and two sons, and the passenger said yes. But I've got daughters. Another passenger came right up to me and said, 'I'm a friend of Ray Mingo.'

Some treat it almost like a sort of confessional because they're just passing through and they won't meet me again.

For female business travelers especially -- airline seats, like office furniture, are designed for men. But for men, too, they're constantly in those little seats, they're sleeping in a different hotel every night, on a different mattress -- and most people don't carry their cervical pillows with them when they travel.

Generally, early in the week people are feeling their way around. They're still getting used to the climate, the food, the booze, the hotel. You tailor the music to their mood and play something soothing, like 'Misty.' Once they get over the middle of the week, they're winding up their business. That's when you play 'New York, New York' or 'Kansas City' -- upbeat music. I can tell by the way they walk through the lobby what kind of day they had. I can see if they've had a stressful day. You can tell if they're smiling that they just closed a business deal, and you know that pretty soon the Champagne corks are going to start popping. Sometimes you might see someone looking lonely. I'll invite them over to the piano and sometimes a crowd will gather around and they'll exchange business cards. I'm like the mortar between the bricks. The busiest times are happy hour -- 4:30 to 6:30. Then they'll come back after dinner and get their spreadsheets out right there in the bar.''",1998-03-08T05:00:00+0000

But in these days of downsized management and Scrooge-like budgeting, purse strings everywhere are a lot tighter. Filing an expense report can call for creative gamesmanship. The dollar bill handed to a baggage handler mysteriously becomes $2. The entertainment bill for $78, split down the middle with your lunch partner, goes on the expense report as yours alone. However petty the sum, the cost of travel and entertainment, or T and E, still adds up -- to more than $156 billion annually, according to American Express Travel-Related Services, with almost half going to hotels, meals, entertainment and ''other.'' With an attitude of ''they owe it to me,'' expense-report novelists will try to cover the costs of a hairdresser, golf game, kennel and traffic ticket. The I.R.S. has raised the ceiling for undocumented expenses to $75, but as one corporate travel manager puts it, ''we're still at $25 because the minute we make it higher, we'll get taxi fares for $74.65 -- with no receipts.

Rothman. Isadore Cohen's life mixed great ability, hard work, and professional accomplishment with family difficulties. He was born on the lower East Side of Manhattan to poor Russian immigrant parents, and moved with them to Connecticut when he was a young child, where his father owned and operated a series of small dairy farms. He attended the Norwich Free Academy where he was a gifted student, and won several scholarships to Yale. He graduated Yale College in 1929 Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude, and the Yale Law School in 1932, second in his class and a member of the Yale Law Review. Mr. Cohen took a position with Austrian and Lance in New York City after graduation, and worked for more than ten years on bank liquidations and other matters related to the Great Depression. In the course of that decade he published more than a dozen scholarly articles in the Columbia, Yale and other law reviews, while carrying on a full-time legal practice. He married the late Eleanor Kastner in 1932. They moved to Valley Cottage in Rockland County for a year in 1938, and then to West Nyack in 1939. He continued to practice law in New York City for several decades, moving to private practice in Rockland County in the late 60's. His marriage and family life grew increasingly troubled, and Isadore and Eleanor Cohen separated permanently in 1962, which began a long estrangement from his family. But in recent years Mr. Cohen was reconciled with his sons and their families, and greatly enjoyed their company and love. He moved to Grandview-on-Hudson in 1962, and lived there until a few weeks before his death.",1998-03-08T05:00:00+0000

Just when Burch's flight should have been touching down, the pilot pulled into a sudden climb. It had been so foggy that Burch couldn't see the runway. Neither, apparently, could the pilot.

A thrilling and moving performer, she seared her roles into our memories with her glorious, gleaming soprano and heartstopping dramatic intensity. From her triumphant debut as Lady Macbeth in 1959 when she overcame the Herculean odds of substituting for Maria Callas, she gained the respect and adoration of the public and her colleagues alike. Standing ovations were a well-deserved commonplace at her performances. At the Met she was the first artist to sing the roles of Lady Macbeth in Verdi's ''Macbeth,'' Abigaille in Verdi's ''Nabucco,'' Ariadne in Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' the Empress in Strauss's ''Die Frau ohne Schatten,'' and Kabanicha in Janacek's ''Katya Kabanova.'' She had a special affinity for the operas of Wagner and Strauss, and her Senta, Sieglinde, Marschallin, Elisabeth, Chrysothemis, Elsa, Salome, Kundry, Ortrud, and Klytaemnestra were magnificent protrayals. In all she sang 299 performances of 24 roles over a period of 31 seasons at the Met. She sang in 12 new production premieres, including Leonore in the Beethoven Bicentennial year production of ''Fidelio.'' Her farewell performance here was just over two years ago, as the Countess in ''The Queen of Spades,'' making her Met career an amazing 37 years long. In addition to the immense respect her artistic achievements demanded, Leonie was much loved by her colleagues and company members at the Met. Her professionalism and hard work were total, and her easy smile, winning sense of humor, and open-hearted warmth made her every engagement here a delightful occasion. Her death has struck an unexpected and severe blow to this company's heart. We offer our sincerest condolences to her husband, Elu, who is also a great friend of many of our company, and to all her family.

Rooms are shredded one by one in a crescendo of chaos. Finally -- poof! -- the Krazees vanish. Out comes the sun, and Iggie is free. It's really O.K., cool, cathartic even, that in THE KRAZEES (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16; ages 3 to 6), there are undercurrents of transactional analysis. It's popular psychology for the preschool set. The text is so charmingly wrought by Sam Swope and envisioned by Eric Brace that the therapeutic instruction rests easily upon it. Seussian wordplay abounds: ''Do you ever get the Krazees? / Do they make your razzle tig? / Do they frazzle your bombazzle / Till you shilly up your shig?'' And my favorite: ''Do they biggle your bumdiggle? / Do they make you wriggle red?'' These are marvelous lines to read -- or squeak or growl or rumble -- aloud. Brace's illustrations have the fully realized, 3-D quality of Claymation, as well as that medium's rather funky esthetic and Taos palette. What a short film this book would make! Krazees are, variously, snouted or striped or snaggletoothed. There are Krazees like little beans, or winged piglets; there are plaid Krazees and Krazees with polka dots. Iggie's like a brunette Penny from the old ''Pee-wee's Playhouse.'' And the manic kitty is just terrific. Penelope Green",1998-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,SOAPBOX; Just Give 'Em the Money,"SINCE my daughter entered elementary school six years ago, I have lived through countless fund-raising activities. Several times a semester, I am called upon for combinations of donating, selling and buying. Bake sales, for instance, require that I do all three. Bake sales are one of my favorite fund-raisers, since they also involve eating, but I must report that they have declined appallingly. Not only do parents no longer bake the goods they send in, they no longer even send in baked goods. At one ''bake'' sale last year canned soda was offered. ''Did you bake that?'' I asked the fifth grader standing behind the table. ''No,'' he said blankly, ''I think my friend's mother did.'' But even canned soda sales have a kind of homemade charm when compared with the (much more profitable) fund-raisers run by professional companies hired by the Parent Teacher Organization. About twice each year, Lindsay brings home a shiny catalogue full of pictures of the wrapping paper or chocolate or plants or magazines that she is selling, and sometimes another shiny catalogue picturing the incredibly cheap prizes that will be bestowed on the juvenile salespeople. I am not against P.T.O. fund-raising per se. I realize that public school budgets in even the richest districts do not extend as far as one might hope. I want my daughter to have the benefit of the field trips and assemblies and playground equipment that these funds provide. The problem is in the sales process. The instructions sent home by the school sensibly discourage the children from selling door to door. My daughter does have nine households of grandparents, aunts and uncles, so for the first year or two she fared pretty well on telephone sales to them. Over time, though, the appeal of a 6- or 7- or 8-year-old niece peddling $10 cans of peanut brittle began to wear off, not to mention the fact that her (mostly younger) cousins are fast maturing and entering the fund-raising market themselves. If my sisters buy Lindsay's pear-shaped, vanilla-scented candles, then sooner or later I will have to buy their children's kosher-for-Passover coconut patties. The combination of guilt and self-interest produced by this situation leaves me a less than eager salesperson; I have been known to stand behind my daughter when she is giving a sales pitch and shout, ''Don't feel you have to buy any!'' into the phone. Not all of the products my daughter is instructed to peddle are hopelessly overpriced; one fund-raiser of which I was rather fond was a magazine subscription sale run by her school. Magazines strike me as more genuinely desirable than, say, a tiny ceramic coin bank shaped like a baseball mitt, and the magazines are reasonably priced. The problem is that the deadline for the magazine sales forces me to write a check to the school to cover the sales my daughter makes by telephone, and then wait for the purchasers to reimburse me. Mom has always paid promptly, but we've had trouble with some of the other customers. Last year my sister's husband ordered a subscription to Consumer Reports from Lindsay in October, but then, despite a touching dunning letter written in my daughter's childish hand, failed to follow up with a check. I had to recoup the $22 by giving the subscription to him as a Christmas present. Lindsay made a telephone sale to my ex in Philadelphia, who gave his new girlfriend's address and then never sent me the $14.95. So when the envelope came home last semester, I put an end to the sales. Over my daughter's protests, I sent $2O to the organizers, which I suspect is more than they would have netted from $50 worth of sales. And I still had enough money left to buy my daughter the 75-cent flashlight she would have won as a sales incentive.",1998-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Great Big River,"You're on the Amazon. Suddenly you come upon five blindfolded, pot-bellied American businessmen, dressed in war paint and loincloths, their wrists loosely tied to trees, the river's muddy water lapping at their knees. You turn to your tour guide for some insight into this bizarre ritual. All he says is, ''North American salesmen celebrating the year's successes.'' Such are the frustrations of AMAZON: From the Floodplains to the Clouds (Monacelli, $60), a book of photographs of the world's most mysterious river. Alex Webb presents readers with a jumbled variety of images from the entire 4,000-mile length of the Amazon -- from its mouth on the Brazilian coast to its source in the mountains of Peru -- but his captions fail to provide any context for them. Though many of the photographs are arresting, too many others are incapable of communicating their message without adequate text. Worse, the layout is a disservice to Webb's work: each photograph has an overwhelming white border, diminishing the verisimilitude of the entire you-are-there experience. That said, there is much work of merit here, from the photograph of an overheated gentleman who escapes the sun in the shadows of a satellite dish in backwater Tapia, Brazil, to a shot of a Peruvian militia whose uniforms seem to consist of white headbands, hand-me-down soccer shirts, bare feet and primitive firearms. Webb's best images capture the fluidity not only of the river but of the life along its banks. Lance Gould",1998-03-15T05:00:00+0000

In addition to his Juilliard degrees, he held the Premier Prix de Virtuosite (with Distinction) from the Geneva Conservatory where he worked with Lionel Rogg, as well as other international competition prizes. During the Bach tercentenary year 1985 he performed all the organ works of Bach to great acclaim in thirteen recitals in New York, and was scheduled to repeat this series at the Lincoln Center Festival '98. Many performances and two CD's grew out of another great interest, in Iberian and Mexican organ music; at his death he was writing a monograph on Mexican historic organs. All his life he was a strong advocate for contemporary organ music, performing and recording many new works. He was Music Director and Organist at the Church of the Holy Apostles in Chelsea; Organist at the Central Synagogue and taught organ at Queens College. As winner of a Fulbright-Garcia Robles grant from the U.S. and Mexican governments, he established a class in organ studies at the University of Guanajuato, Mexico last summer.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; The Family Honor,"Despite the near-microscopic scrutiny to which our politicians' love lives are currently subjected, we may still be astonished to encounter a culture in which ordinary girls' sexual intimacies are known by every neighbor, mothers probe their sleeping daughters' private parts to confirm the ''family honor,'' and a girl's first menstruation is announced from the rooftops. Dorit Rabinyan, an Israeli journalist, poet and playwright, has conjured precisely such a society in PERSIAN BRIDES (Braziller, $22.50), her lush, lyrical and disturbing first novel. Set in a Jewish community in a village in turn-of-the-century Persia, the story contrasts the experiences and aspirations of two young women: Flora, a 15-year-old pining for her deadbeat husband, a cloth merchant who ditched her with ''a baby in her belly and lice in her hair,'' and Flora's 11-year-old cousin, Nazie, desperate to achieve her menses so she can be wed to Flora's brother. Nazie and Flora's frantic longing for married life is artfully contrasted with the reality of what's in store for them: wives and mothers in their world are violently mistreated by their husbands, spat upon, even threatened with death for bearing female children. With unwaveringly authentic period detail, Rabinyan grounds her themes of sexual politics in scenes mingling exotic beauty and gritty horror. Only 23 when her book was published in Hebrew, she writes with the wise and leisurely assurance of a town bard recounting communal myths. In this translation by Yael Lotan, Rabinyan's marvelously digressive style and rich prose give the story the feel of a nightlong wedding feast. ''Persian Brides'' is an auspicious debut.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  NOVECK, CAROLYN SCHNURER","NOVECK-Carolyn Schnurer. Mrs. Noveck, of Palm Beach, Florida died in Palm Beach on Sunday, March 15, 1998 with her son, Tony, at her bedside. Mrs. Noveck was born and educated in New York City, and moved to Palm Beach over twenty years ago. In New York, she taught at New York University and the Fashion Institute of Technology. Carolyn Schnurer was instrumental in changing women's fashions in beachwear and sportswear, designing complete outfits, and adapting the two-piece bathing suit for the United States market. For these innovations her designs appeared in the pages of ''Vogue'', ''Harper's Bazaar'' and ''Life'' magazines, as well as on the covers. The Awards presented to her from Coty, The Cotton Council, International Sportswear, Miami Sportswear, and Boston Sportswear were among other special recognitions for her achievements. Her sense of humor was often chronicled in newspaper columns. The oft-told tale was the time when she was cautioned in traveling from India to Paris to be sure not to be routed via Iran, as her passport was stamped as having visited Israel, and that was reason enough to be taken from the plane, detained in Iran, and perhaps the cause of an international situation. Announcement was made by the Captain of the plane that they would make an unscheduled stop in Iran, before proceeding on with the itinerary. Immediately a landing card was distributed to each passanger to be filled out, including ''Religion''. In a panic and fear that she would be in trouble on landing in Iran, she thought of her headquarters in New York on Seventh Avenue, and wrote under ''Religion'' Seventh Avenue Adventist, and all was well. In essence, Carolyn Schnurer had flair and style and grace, and devoted herself to her family, and to the successful development of a catering service with her late husband, Lawrence Noveck. Survivors include her son, Anthony T. Schnurer, M.D., her sister, Selma Frank, and her step-children, Jane Strompf and Ralph Noveck. Funeral Services will be private. Interment will take place in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California. A memorial Service will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers the family requests contributions In Memory of Carolyn Schnurer to Hospice of Palm Beach County, 3300 East Avenue, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Retaining walls can be added to restore crispness to sagging middle-aged gardens. They don't come cheap, however. A three-foot-high wall will run between $90 and $120 a linear foot.

The law currently allows them into bars, even while it prohibits them from buying or drinking alcohol. The law is widely flouted, however, and most of the task-force members -- highway officials, state legislators, local sheriffs, a representative from Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) -- were united on the need to change what they saw as a loophole. The loophole, they believed, was encouraging college students to spend their nights carousing rather than studying. They also felt it was contributing to the carnage on the state's highways.

For Bill Mumy, who played the precocious young son, Will, the movie is a reminder of a missed opportunity: he once wrote his own ''Lost in Space'' script, a 1980 teleplay called ''The Epilogue.'' It never got filmed because the late Irwin Allen, the show's creator, wouldn't sign on. ''He was really rude,'' recalls Mumy, 44, now an actor based in Los Angeles. (He has a recurring role on ''Babylon 5.'') ''He was making feature films, and the last words he said were, 'If at any future time I want to do ''Lost in Space,'' it will be because I want to, not you.'

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Stalin's War,"Yevgeny Khaldei beat the odds against his survival many times. He was a poor Ukrainian Jew who became the top Soviet photographer of World War II, then endured neglect and outbreaks of Russian anti-Semitism during the subsequent decades. He even lived long enough to outlast his own obscurity. Before he died last year at the age of 80, two American museums had devoted exhibits to his work, and his images were made available to collectors via the Internet. WITNESS TO HISTORY: The Photographs of Yevgeny Khaldei (Aperture, $40), with a biographical essay by Alexander and Alice Nakhimovsky, who teach computer science and Russian, respectively, at Colgate, that focuses on Khaldei's record of World War II, the pinnacle of his professional career. He covered the war from arctic Russia south through eastern and central Europe and back to Berlin, creating images of epic sweep and surreal destruction: a reindeer stands frozen amid exploding stones and rubble; an airplane hangs perilously from the facade of an apartment building; weary soldiers move through vast landscapes. His most widely reproduced image, of Russian soldiers raising the hammer and sickle over Germany's Reichstag, was inspired by Joe Rosenthal's photo of marines raising the Stars and Stripes at Iwo Jima. A model of enterprise, if not of journalistic scruples, Khaldei managed a quick trip back from the front to Moscow, where he persuaded a tailor friend to construct three Soviet flags out of purloined red tablecloths. After photographing soldiers and flags at two other Berlin locations, he found the composition he had been seeking on the roof of the Reichstag. However much some of his photos may have been orchestrated, they effectively convey the brutal strangeness of war. Rosemary Ranck",1998-03-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; The Things That Got Away,"On a dazzling autumn morning, Mark Random, the narrator of the title story in Dabney Stuart's delightful collection, THE WAY TO COBBS CREEK (University of Missouri, paper, $16.95), is standing knee-deep in the Connecticut River when he hooks a ''gorgeous'' brown trout, then inexplicably lets it slide out of his grasp. But maybe this isn't so surprising, since Mark seems to have let much in life slip away -- marriages, children, jobs. Now ''nearing the bogey of middle age,'' he is lost in his memories, trying to come to terms with his distant, hard-drinking father and thinking about ''making my manhood my own -- you know, catching it.'' Fishing serves as both primary setting and central metaphor for Mark's struggle. As his last name suggests, there is a haphazard quality to his ruminations, and the story, composed of a series of vignettes from his life, moves back and forth through time, sometimes in a confusing fashion. Yet Stuart's lush and lyrical prose propels the reader onward. Scene after scene is described with remarkable attention to detail, slowly and subtly building in emotional intensity. The three other stories in this collection are equally strong, and each concerns a character who has had an influence on Mark's life. The final one, about Willy Parole, a handyman who worked for Mark's grandparents, features a gleeful abundance of appropriately colorful language. ''No one would ever know how long he could have sustained his prodigious capacity for pleasure and recuperation,'' Stuart writes, describing Willy's father, Phoenix, a legendary drunk who died at 35, ''and his legend had no fitting cap, no ecstatic expiration at the moment of climax among a bevy of his doves.'' What's memorable in these stories is not the climax but the prose that's encountered along the way. Maggie Garb",1998-03-22T05:00:00+0000

From Art Tatum to Sonny Rollins, jazz musicians have taken American popular songs into the laboratory of improvisation, proving their staying power as standards. Today, a new generation of jazz musicians is attempting a similar experiment with a different sort of pop: the rock and rhythm-and-blues of the last three decades. And although jazz musicians have occasionally dabbled with the tunes of Lennon and McCartney and the like, the breadth of today's work -- and its inclusion of rock -- is striking. Jazz musicians are riffing on everything from James Brown to Nirvana, and their interpretive approaches vary just as widely.",1998-03-22T05:00:00+0000
us,Teaching My Daughter The World Is Open,"Your article ''What to Teach Our Daughters'' [March 1] prompted much discussion among mothers in my community, especially those of us who would fall within the author's ''strange breed of woman'' known as ''soccer Moms.'' The author seemingly looks at the decision whether or not to stay at home and raise one's children as an all-or-nothing proposition -- and, unfortunately, she is missing what is probably the most important aspect of that decision. Most stay-at-home moms (which is in itself an oxymoron since we rarely seem to be home at all and are anything but the robotic-like drones she conjures up) I know are well-educated women who left, temporarily, very exciting and rewarding careers. Many of us (myself included) are fortunate enough to achieve a wonderful balance by working part-time to keep our careers afloat during the children's younger years and to keep a sense of ourselves. But what the author fails to discuss is the fact that most women (I am not referring to those who must work due to economic factors) make a deliberate, conscious decision to raise their children because they want to! It's something that comes so naturally to many, if not most, women -- that old maternal instinct kicks in from the first wail in the delivery room, and the thought of having a stranger care for and guide that precious child through its childhood is completely incompatible with everything you've ever dreamed of. This is not to say that women who chose to work are doing anything wrong. It's just that I don't believe that we have to ''teach'' our daughters that they must make a decision between having a career and having an identity. One can take a break from a carreer and still be a successful and fulfilled woman. It's all in how you look at it and how you prioritize.",1998-03-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Their Inward Parts,"At first, there seems to be no trace of a smile in Francis Bacon's ''Study of Henrietta Moraes Laughing'' (1969), one of many portraits of Moraes that Bacon (1909-92) painted over the years. All one sees is a distorted face with eyelids closed over deep-set eyes, the face in shades of white, ocher and black, overlaid in patches with marks in red and magenta like bloody fingerprints. Yet in the mangled lower half of the face (where violent white brushstrokes and superimposed volumes compete for attention and hint at turmoil), the viewer eventually can distinguish what may be a row of pearly white teeth; to their left, perhaps, is Moraes's restrained smile a moment before (or after) laughter; to their right, an ominous black patch, like a bullet hole. With 233 color reproductions illustrating Bacon's variations on a theme -- series of three (or two) studies for a portrait or self-portrait, single portraits and studies, diptychs portraying different subjects, as well as details of all of the above -- BACON: Portraits and Self-Portraits (Thames and Hudson, $60), by France Borel, a Belgian art historian, provides ample opportunity to examine the ways the artist had of delving into his subjects -- friends, lovers, admirers and himself. Most of these approaches appear violent, involving painterly renditions of flayed skin; cheekbones, jaws and necks defined by savage brushstrokes; hollowed eye sockets; torn ears; extreme dislocation of features, all in a riot of spurting colors, except for one constant: the portraits' solid background. Again and again, Bacon returned to the same subjects -- Moraes, George Dyer, Isabel Rawsthorne, Lucian Freud, Peter Beard and Muriel Belcher -- in an effort to capture and convey their inner turmoils, secrets, beauty and mortality. He directed the same relentless attention to his own features (his ample cheeks, his squarish jaw) with the same purpose. In one series from 1967, his face seems to be sucking itself in; in a 1979 study, the contours of his eyes and lips, and the line that joins his nostril to the corner of his mouth, are ghoulish, drawn in purple on a bluish-white face; and in a 1980 series, bloody marks cover large areas of his emaciated self-portrait. In his introduction, Milan Kundera writes that Bacon was in search of an ''infinitely fragile self shivering in a body.'' As this book makes clear, Bacon's search never ended.

The lawyer who established the precedent that a purchasor of a ticket on the New York Central Railroad is contractually entitled to a seat, died March 26, 1998 in Basking Ridge, NJ at the age of 90. Mr. Davis was born January 10, 1908 and worked from the age of 12 when his father died. He graduated from Fordham Law School in 1929 and opened his own office for the practice of law in November 1930. He continued to practice law in New York City until October 17, 1997 when he suffered a stroke. During law school, Mr. Davis worked as the chief usher at the Mark Strand Theatre. In 1937, Mr. Davis purchased a ticket to travel on the New York Central Railroad from Albany to N.Y. The train did not have sufficient seats for some of the ticketholders and Mr. Davis filed suit seeking recovery of $47.80. In 1937, Mr. Davis won a decision from the New York Court of Appeals holding that a ticketholder is entitled to a seat and that the railroad had an obligation to add additional cars to accommodate all of the passengers. In 1973, Mr. Davis sued the Penn Central Railroad for $1.80 because he was not provided with a seat on a trip from Grand Central Station to North White Plains. Relying on his prior precedent, he won a judgment against Penn Central Railroad for $1.80 plus $10 for discomfort. Mr. Davis became a Mason on December 6, 1934 and served as Grand Master of Pacific Lodge No. 233 in 1942. He was also president of Rehoboth Lodge No. 38 of B'nai B'rith in 1941. He was an active and devoted alumnus of Fordham Law School & organized reunions of the Class of 1929 every five years from 1934 through 1994. Mr. Davis organized a group called ''The Strand Alumni'' comprised of the ushers at the Mark Strand Theatre from 1926-1930 which met every five years from 1935 on. Mr. Davis is survived by his wife, Miriam, his son, Jed Davis; his daughter, Helen Davis Chaitman; by his grandchildren, Jennifer Chaitman, Alison Davis Curry, Larissa Rose, Aglaia Davis, and Rhadamanthus Davis; and by his great-grandchild, Emma Davis Curry.

Here are two stories of the sea (Hanley's trademark), another about soldiers at war and yet another about a disillusioned former sailor struggling for recognition, as well as a bizarre, haunting portrait of a man on death row. In Hanley's fiction, working-class men of action face crises and decisions -- some simple, some complex -- that will forever alter their existence. In every story, time is brutally compressed; similarly, any unnecessary detail is washed out of the language. What's left are stark feelings, what one story describes as the ''full orchestra of the emotions -- anger, dejection, sorrow.'' Sometimes excruciating, these elemental human reactions are nevertheless always on carefully controlled display. In the final story, ''Narrative,'' chance plays a key role as a party of men is chosen to join a doomed ship, sailing in wartime and bound for parts unknown. The strangest story, ''A Passion Before Death,'' is a tightly written evocation of the moments in which a man faces execution, his last wish one of sexual desire that can be expressed only toward his burly warders. In contrast, ''The German Prisoner'' details the more generalized brutality and futile hatred engendered by the trench warfare of World War I. Each story explores the fine line between sanity and madness; thanks to Hanley's skill, each also reveals ''the terrible power of words.'' Erik Burns",1998-03-29T05:00:00+0000

The ruling did not turn on any question of Federal law, so it cannot be appealed, but similar challenges to the Scouts' membership policies are pending in other states, and a New Jersey state appeals court recently ruled in favor of a gay Scoutmaster's efforts to stay in the organization.
