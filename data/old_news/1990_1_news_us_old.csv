Alice Hatton is an Englishwoman in her early 50's who, like countless other middle-aged people, has been left staring discontentedly at an empty nest when her children have grown. She comes face to face with vast spaces of time to be filled - and the bleak realization that years of bustling have masked her dislike of her self-absorbed husband, to whom she has nothing to say. At first she merely dabbles with a new image, dying her hair. But soon she drifts into a one-night stand, then into a longer affair with a dentist, who is a decent enough chap, separated from his wife. When the time comes - when, as Lorelei Lee warned, the louse goes back to his spouse - Alice is saved by the return of her youngest daughter, who is disillusioned with men (naturally) and pregnant (of course). If they were even marginally lifelike, the characters in ''Alice Alone'' would be unlikable. Nor does Ms. Brookfield shun a contrived plot. And the quality of her writing may be discerned from the book's final sentence: ''She felt the springs of a new life stirring within her; like all the raw elation of childbirth with none of the pain.''",1990-01-07T05:00:00+0000

No Central American - save Guatemala's 1967 Nobel Prize winner, Miguel Angel Asturias - figured in the literary boom that brought so many young Latin American writers to print in the 1970's and 80's. With the publication of this groundbreaking anthology, North Americans have the chance to see 20 of the isthmus' relatively unknown writers as they forge powerful visions out of the civil wars, death squads, hopeless poverty, dislocation and crippling foreign debt that have exhausted and desensitized less tenacious observers. These writers speak individually, yet one hears a medley of voices crying out for sanity and justice. As the scholar and translator Jo Anne Engelbert remarks in her probing introduction, stories are the means by which the popular imagination can ''express sorrow, pain, and rage, reflect on contemporary events, and register dissent.'' But it is worth noting, lest we believe that it is now safe to speak openly throughout Central America about social injustice, that the stories in this book often do so through allegory, magic realism or surrealism. Among my favorite entries are a story from El Salvador's Jacinta Escudos, which tells how the poor and uncommitted get sucked into playing repressive roles in a war they care little or nothing about; the Guatemalan Rodrigo Rey Rosa's parable about a young boy who kills a canary and then expects it to come back to life to prove God's existence; and the Costa Rican Carmen Naranjo's hilarious tale, from which the collection takes its title, about a fictitious country's scheme to sell rain to an Arab emirate as a way of avoiding bankruptcy. Many of the translations, particularly those by Paul Bowles, Edith Grossman and George Yudice, are excellent. (It's a shame, though, that the translators' names could not have appeared in the table of contents, rather than being appended to the end of the stories.) ''And We Sold the Rain'' is an anthology that should give rise to the publication of a more generous sampling of contemporary fiction from Central America.",1990-01-07T05:00:00+0000

All of the above, as evidenced by a complex new show, ''Facing History: The Black Image in American Art, 1710-1940,'' to open at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington on Saturday. (After closing in Washington, it will move to the Brooklyn Museum in New York, opening April 25.) The show was organized by Guy C. McElroy, a black art historian, and takes cues from the ''new'' scholarship that examines works of art in their political and socioeconomic context. It documents the ways in which American artists ''reinforced a number of largely restrictive stereotypes of black identity, '' as Mr. McElroy writes in his introduction to the handsome catalogue. Yet so subtly were some of of many of the artists, that they are not always apparent to the viewer. In recent years, many art historians have been digging into such works as John Singleton Copley's ''Watson and the Shark,'' a 1788 painting of a rescue attempt, to find in it a subtext of racial and political conflict.",1990-01-07T05:00:00+0000

The setting of this first novel is Concord, Mass., the time 1971 - and the prospects for adventure rich. Which is not to say that Sam and his older brother, Murray, prosper in their new milieu. Sam narrates the story of his and his brother's education, which the reader soon knows will not be narrowly confined to books and the classroom. The boys' real instruction is given by the Mansfield sisters, two glowing, nubile teen-agers who are knowledgeable about such basics as contraceptives and skinny-dipping. Berry, the older sister, has hair the color of ''wild honey'' and the flesh of a ''brand-new egg-filled woman.'' Emma, the younger, is an artist who likes to murmur soulful remarks just when Sam longs to squeeze her waist, which is as ''soft and warm as custard.'' Sam's great, lasting hope is to lose his virginity with either sister, though his lust eventually gathers round the bosomy Berry. In his quest, Sam learns a painful lesson: the Mansfield beauties are impossible to snare. Unfortunately, David Michaelis never extends his reach any further than the depiction of Sam's romantic frustration. The tension that arises from being one of a handful of boys amid so many girls is quickly snuffed out after a few chapters and replaced with the more particular anxiety of chasing Berry and Emma. And so the plot veers away from anything more serious than adolescent angst.

us,  FICTION,"ALL ABOUT WOMEN. By Andrew M. Greeley. (Tom Doherty/Tor, Cloth, $18.95; Paper, $12.95.) As he did with his 1986 novel ''Patience of a Saint,'' the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley affixes an introductory note to this collection, explaining that its title is less audacious than it sounds. He does not, he says, ''purport to know 'all about women.' '' Rather, each of these 23 stories is about a woman, and in each ''a woman either is or creates an opportunity of grace . . . or is visited by an offer of grace.'' Father Greeley's best story, ''Andrea,'' provides an absorbing and chilling account of an eerie young widow being driven through Arizona by a former Navy officer, who is as captivated by her beauty as he is haunted by guilt over the men who died under his command in World War II. Three other interrelated tales - ''Peggy,'' ''Paula'' and ''Deirdre'' - present the collection's only rounded and convincing character, Peggy Walsh, a woman struggling to resume her life after the death of her husband. Unfortunately, despite the benevolence behind them, the remaining stories in ''All About Women'' contribute to the mounting evidence that Father Greeley's talents are best displayed in his theological polemics rather than in his novels and short stories. Long a champion of a more powerful role for women within the church, he treats them here with a syrupy reverence that itself becomes patronizing. As if to serve as a metaphor for the collection, the Virgin Mary is a contemporary character in one story (passing as Ms. Mary Carpenter), and even she cloys. Father Greeley's women simply aren't real. But then, neither are the pulpy narratives in which they appear. These are cumbersome, antiseptic tales whose sentimentality is reminiscent of Hollywood movies in the 1930's and television comedies in the 1950's. Often narrated with thin sanctimony by haughty priests, many of these stories might be retitled ''Father Knows Best.'' That may be so, but not when it comes to fiction.",1990-01-07T05:00:00+0000

Parents, however, say they experience more stress and less satisfaction when children are in a latchkey arrangement instead of at a child-care center or with their mothers at home. The survey of 544 children, kindergarten through sixth grade, from randomly selected schools in North Carolina was sponsored by Project Home Safe, a nonprofit national program to improve the well-being of children in self-care, which is funded by the Whirlpool Foundation.

us,  HAS FIFTH AVENUE BECOME BESIDE THE POINT?,"There is a fragility inherent in the symbolism of every great street in New York: Broadway stands for a theater that is perpetually in crisis, Wall Street for financial empires that seem ever ready to decamp to New Jersey, and Fifth Avenue, perhaps the most celebrated of them all, for a luxury and a style that once seemed unique to New York, but now feels more and more like what can be found in every medium-sized city and shopping mall from here to La Jolla. Something has gone from Fifth Avenue, and it is difficult to put your finger on exactly what it is, since the avenue in some ways is grander now than it has ever been: today there are more super-expensive shops, particularly around the epicenter of conspicuous consumption at the intersection of 57th Street, and there are several new skyscrapers, including one of the city's most luxurious new office towers. The avenue is booming by most conventional measures, despite the abrupt and widely mourned closing of one of its great landmarks, B. Altman's, perhaps as beloved a piece of retail architecture as Fifth Avenue has ever had. (But Altman's demise is the result of an overleveraged corporate owner, not of any ailment attributable to Fifth Avenue itself, even though its location at 34th Street, south of most of the avenue's fancy retailing, didn't help matters any.) Fifth Avenue from 34th Street to Central Park has always embodied the most endearing side of Manhattan's ability to satisfy haute bourgeois fantasies: a street of grand shops, fine department stores, churches, and a smattering of banks, clubs, hotels and office buildings, all organized to make a coherent, though hardly repetitive, whole. As on all the best streets in New York, the buildings were different one from the next, but not too different: St. Patrick's Cathedral enjoyed a cordial relationship with Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman had something to say to Tiffany. And presiding over it all for more than half a century now have been several buildings that are not only truly great works of architecture but active, functioning parts of the public realm: the Plaza Hotel, Rockefeller Center and the New York Public Library. To have its greatest monuments also be places with which the public interacted constantly, buildings rich in symbolism but also central to daily life - what street could ask for more?",1990-01-07T05:00:00+0000

Barry Parker explores what may be the ultimate mystery in ''Invisible Matter and the Fate of the Universe,'' combining history, astronomy, cosmology and physics. Mr. Parker, a professor of physics and astronomy at Idaho State University, traces a line of research from the first faint questions about our own galaxy's missing mass in 1932 to those questions' growth into a major concern for thousands of astronomers worldwide. He argues that only 10 percent of our universe may be observable using current methods. So where is the missing matter? Moreover, what is the missing matter? Various researchers propose small planets, burned-out stars or stars that never quite started burning, black holes, neutrinos and exotic particles as the missing mass. Mr. Parker surveys the field and reports on advocates of these theories and their solutions to the mystery. He makes it clear that learning more about missing matter will be crucial in determining the fate of the universe. In an earlier book, ''Creation,'' Mr. Parker gave a stunning description of the first moments of the universe as cosmologists understand it. In the latter part of this new book he conjectures about whether the universe might continue expanding forever or eventually collapse back on itself. Guessing about the past is much simpler than guessing about the future, so it should not be surprising that this book is not as powerful as ''Creation.'' Both, however, help bring cosmology well within the grasp of the lay reader.",1990-01-07T05:00:00+0000

Like the Bronx Democratic chairman Stanley Friedman and Representative Mario Biaggi before him, Representative Robert Garcia was caught up in scandal and convicted and now faces sentencing. In a move that his friends said was calculated to win leniency from the judge who is to sentence him later this month on conspiracy and extortion charges, Mr. Garcia resigned from office last week. The former Congressman and his wife, Jane, could each get up to 45 years in prison and fines of $750,000 on the charges, which grew out of his involvement with the Wedtech Corporation, a Bronx military contractor. The Garcias, who were found guilty last October of extorting $76,000 from Wedtech, have denied wrongdoing and are appealing. The six-term Representative issued a brief statement on his resignation, saying that serving his Bronx constituents had been ''the greatest honor I could ever know.'' He added, ''But I have always said that if I could not serve their best interests, I would leave office.''",1990-01-07T05:00:00+0000

The explorer Thor Heyerdahl argues in ''Easter Island,'' as he has in such books as ''Kon-Tiki,'' that ancient peoples were more developed and mobile than modern thinking gives them credit for. Easter Island, off South America in the Pacific Ocean, has long been a subject of scientific speculation for its large stone statues, its cultural history, its language and even its plant life, all of which are distinct from those of its island neighbors. On his first visit to the island in 1955, Mr. Heyerdahl was struck by the similarity of Easter Island's sculptures to those of pre-Incan Peru. Scientists found numerous plants on Easter Island that exist nowhere else in Polynesia but do grow in South America - more evidence to bolster the legend that an early king arrived from a land to the east, a legend that had been summarily rejected by scientists. Mr. Heyerdahl, however, finds the legend both compelling and plausible. In fact, the mobility of ancient peoples has penetrated the public consciousness so thoroughly that his extensive arguments now seem almost redundant. The account of Mr. Heyerdahl's 1986 return to Easter Island is fascinating, as his team finds further links to South American civilizations and even to the ancient Hittites. Most intriguing is that scientists finally show how enormous 20-ton stone statues were moved from quarries to their resting places all over the island. The islanders had always said that their statues ''walked'' - were transported by humans - and, of course, the scientists had always rejected that answer. It is this triumph of ancient civilization and the humbling of science that should most appeal to the general reader.",1990-01-07T05:00:00+0000

First there is the divorce, still a shock to a good Baptist girl, even though ''it was a miracle - an honest-to-goodness one - she'd managed to hold her marriage with Eddie together as long as she had.'' Her job as a nurse's aide at Quiet Meadows would challenge even the most Christian woman, which Lila Mae is. And then there's Wellesley Coe, an all too real man who is all too eager to get close to Lila Mae. So it's understandable that Lila Mae has organized her day to revolve around ''World of Love,'' an evangelical television program that never raises the ''larger theological questions'' that always ''gave her a headache.'' In his third novel, Christopher T. Leland strikes just the right tone. He's funny without belittling his characters, whose weaknesses are always obvious yet always well integrated with their strengths. It's no surprise when Ted and Becky Standish, the smiling ''World of Love'' couple, do a moral nose dive parallel to that of the real-life Jim and Tammy Bakker. And as she is disillusioned by her television religion, it's also no surprise that Lila Mae begins to put her life back together, deciding that maybe she was just a tad too judgmental about Wellesley Coe. This section of the novel, in fact, feels uncomfortably contrived. Mr. Leland, and his characters, are more intriguing in the seeking than in the finding.",1990-01-14T05:00:00+0000

us,  NONFICTION,"TRACKINGS: Composers Speak With Richard Dufallo. By Richard Dufallo. (Oxford University, $35.) No one should require more of this book of splendid interviews. Still, how wonderful it would be if Richard Dufallo's ''Trackings'' rekindled the old passions and rancor surrounding 20th-century music before the composers and their scores fade into the next century. The interviews are with 26 men who explain what they have tried to do in their work since World War II. They talk and talk about how and why they tried to shift harmonies, rhythms, orchestration and scoring away from 19th-century traditions. Their talk is technical, as if they were speaking with a peer, which Mr. Dufallo, a conductor, indeed is. What they describe is fascinating, from new types of scoring to electronically synthesized music to stealing themes from other composers. A revealing anecdote comes from John Cage about a concert in the Netherlands at which several musicians preferred to drink too much and leave the hall rather than perform what he wanted. George Rochberg asks a telling question: ''Can we compose again with passion? That's what I miss in almost everything that's written these days.'' Suddenly, the avant-garde is old. Mr. Cage, the former enfant terrible, is 77 years old; Aaron Copland is 89. They all stuck to their creative guns without much carping about public indifference. I wonder, though, how these distinguished men, accused of writing awful music in their time, feel about the fame and fortunes earned by the cacophonous sounds of rock-and-roll. That is the only question Mr. Dufallo failed to ask.",1990-01-14T05:00:00+0000

In 1972, Mr. Rowell sold his small automotive business in California and took off with camera in hand on an odyssey that would take him in search of adventure around the world. He traversed Pakistan's Karakoram Mountains, a 285-mile trek across uninhabitable highlands, where the temperature dropped to 25 below. On a one-day climb of Mount McKinley in Alaska, he slipped and fell toward an ice cliff that plunged 3,000 feet, before being rescued by a teammate. During an expedition to the top of Fitz Roy, an Argentine peak known for its vicious weather, Mr. Rowell's team, forced by darkness to spend the night trapped on an icy ledge a few hundred feet from the top, jogged in place to keep warm while waiting for dawn. Mr. Rowell's photograph of the Fitz Roy range - sheer granite towers draped in ice reaching up into an indigo sky brushed in a light that looks like molten gold - is one of the more spectacular in the book. The beauty of ''The Art of Adventure'' is not so much in the photographs but in the words that relay to us the courage and sheer joy the author gets from his experiences. Mr. Rowell lets us know that adventure is not in the dreaming but in the doing.",1990-01-14T05:00:00+0000

Vincent Eaton's dark, angry and intense first novel uses police documents, psychological evaluations, interviews, straight narration and interior monologues to chronicle the self-destruction of Tim Buckles. At 28, Buckles appears at first to be leading a normal life. He has a steady job as a lifeguard, a bungalow in Los Angeles and a loving girlfriend named Alisa. The problem is, he feels as if he's living someone else's life. When Alisa becomes pregnant, she encourages him to take a job in her father's business. Tim's feelings of alienation escalate. A drowning and then a disastrous visit to his elderly parents, who have become more miserable with the years, push Tim over the edge. In sparse prose, Mr. Eaton leads us through a series of violent events, many of which take place inside Tim's mind. In the most powerful sections of the book, Tim pretends he is a healthy and productive individual, telling everyone exactly what they want to hear. At the same time, both Tim and the reader realize that he is descending into madness. Mr. Eaton is not subtle. He immerses us in Freudian nightmares and is not afraid to twist psychoanalytic cliches into graphically detailed scenes, such as the lurid one in which a son takes the ultimate revenge on an unloving father. In ''Self-Portrait of Someone Else,'' Mr. Eaton concocts a puzzle out of a depraved childhood, a retarded twin brother, multiple murder mysteries, flashbacks, hallucinations, a love story and self-analysis. The pieces all come together in a brave literary debut about an intelligent man who, struggling to understand and control his rage at his past, ''realizes himself away.''",1990-01-14T05:00:00+0000

These pithy sayings are directed at Blake's enemies in London's Royal Academy and reveal his pejorative view of Classicism.

The long opening sequence, with River Phoenix as the young Indiana, is a playful feast of clues that allows Steven Spielberg to fill in some crucial details about his hero; here Indiana acquires his trademark fedora, whip and fear of snakes.

us,  FICTION,"THE GARDEN WHERE THE BRASS BAND PLAYED. By Simon Vestdijk. Translated by A. Brotherton. (New Amsterdam, $18.95.) Originally published in the Netherlands in 1950, ''The Garden Where the Brass Band Played'' is now being published in an able translation by A. Brotherton as part of a series of modern Dutch classics. But while Simon Vestdijk's novel may be considered modern in his native country, its tone and subject seem to belong more to 19th-century Dickensian sagas. Its narrator, Nol Rieske, introduces himself to the reader almost as early in life as David Copperfield, and provides just as many details of his sentimental education. Unlike most of Dickens's protagonists, however, Nol is born into privilege, the son of a judge. And unlike the 19th-century master of epic fictional memoirs, Vestdijk takes such a circuitous route through Nol's life that it is difficult to determine just what his maturation is supposed to illustrate. At first, Nol's story seems to focus on family relationships, as the author reveals Nol's distant dealings with his father, his restrained worship of his mother and his enmity toward his spoiled older brother, Chris. Then the book becomes a celebration of musical genius when Nol, at age 8, is mesmerized in the town garden by a brass band conducted by Henri Cuperus, an eccentric who later becomes the boy's piano teacher. Finally, the novel fixes on the timeworn theme of class distinctions versus romantic love, as a grown-up Nol pursues Trix, Cuperus's mercurial daughter. Led astray by a member of the local aristocracy, Trix has a tarnished reputation that threatens to destroy any chance of happiness with Nol. Unfortunately, the reader can't enjoy the enigmatic Trix much longer than Nol can. And the other pivotal figures in his life - his mother and Cuperus - seem more silly than saintly. Even Nol himself reveals his snobbish upbringing. In the end, reading the novel is like perusing the diary of someone you don't much like - distaste ultimately triumphs over curiosity.",1990-01-14T05:00:00+0000

When Mr. Hashimoto and Mr. Tanaka emerged from the woods last week after 45 years, they made it clear that they had stayed on after the big war to fight a smaller one. They joined the local Communist insurgents in 1948 to fight for Malaysian independence from Britain. Though Malaysia won its independence in 1957, the Communist guerrillas did not officially lay down their arms until last month. The 71-year-old Mr. Hashimoto said that for he and his comrade, now 77, it was a matter of honor. ''We thought Malaysians would think we were taking advantage of them if we let Britain reclaim their country,'' he said.

Paramount contended that ''Coming to America'' was based on an idea developed by Eddie Murphy, who starred in the movie and was not named in the suit. But the court said the plot lines of Mr. Buchwald's ''King for a Day'' and the Paramount movie were definitely consanguine: Each is about a member of African royalty who comes to the United States and ends up working in a menial job. The studio said it would appeal the ruling. In the meantime, another phase of the trial will determine just how much money the movie made - and how much is due Mr. Buchwald, who appeared unconcerned with that aspect of the case.

us,  WHEN THE MEN IN BLUE FADE INTO BLAND,"Climbing from the bottom to the top of the ratings heap during the last decade or so, NBC was adventurous, taking chances on series such as ''Miami Vice,'' ''Hill Street Blues,'' ''Cheers'' and ''The Cosby Show.'' Today, undoubtedly under pressure to stay a very profitable No. 1, the network, now owned by General Electric, has become noticeably more cautious. Instead of shaping popular tastes, NBC is struggling merely to reflect them. Discouraging proof is currently available in the new series called ''True Blue,'' broadcast on Fridays at 9 P.M. Oddly enough, at a time when commercial network audiences are eroding because of stiff competition from cable and VCR's, the need for programming innovations at CBS, NBC and ABC might seem obvious. But ''True Blue'' is pure old-style formula. Its roots can be traced at least as far back as the early 1970's when ''Emergency,'' another NBC series, offered weekly compilations of interwoven incidents involving the Los Angeles County Fire Department's Paramedical Rescue Service. Randolph Mantooth, as trivia collectors will recall, became a television star playing Paramedic John Gage. Countless television series have used the same formula, regularly serving up a stew of funny, sad, sentimental and tragic anecdotes.",1990-01-14T05:00:00+0000

Don't laugh. Gil Clancy didn't. ''When George got Gerry hurt, he didn't just hit him with ordinary punches, he hit him with five bombs,'' Cooney's trainer said.

I suspect somebody gave it to him, and I plan to pass it on to a third person, a neighbor who is beside herself with excitement.

I am a bit vague about Elsie de Wolfe Mendl, but aware enough to know that 50 or so years ago she was a famous decorator, that she ascribed her longevity to frequently standing on her head and that her husband, Sir Charles Mendl, had his custom-made union suits embroidered with the year of purchase. My neighbor tells me that Lady Mendl pops up in several books, the best of which includes luncheon recipes. I envision thin women eating creamed chicken in patty shells, the sun over Sutton Place striking a bottle of Pouilly-Fuisse, and chatter akin to that in the autobiography of Lady Mendl's fellow decorator, Billy Baldwin.

Shortly before noon on Dec. 9, 1985, Dale Burr, an Iowa farmer, grabbed his shotgun, entered the kitchen where his wife of 40 years was baking cookies and shot her through the heart. He then drove into town, where he killed his banker. He was not finished. At a neighboring farm, he pumped two lethal shots into a young farmer against whom he had held a grudge. The last of Burr's acts of brutality, all of which took place in under an hour, was to turn the gun on himself, blowing two holes in his chest. Bruce Brown, the author of ''Mountain in the Clouds: A Search for the Wild Salmon,'' has chosen this shocking incident as the basis for ''Lone Tree,'' a thoroughly researched sociological examination of the plight of the American farmer. It is not a pretty picture. That same fall, reports Mr. Brown, ''three first-rate Iowa farmers committed suicide in one seven-day stretch.'' These men, like Burr, had been successful farmers and model citizens. But around the time President Jimmy Carter chose to fight Russian expansionism with an American grain embargo, farmland values tumbled, as did crop prices. Left with huge debts and no way to pay them off, farmers were distraught; foreclosure notices became as commonplace as garage sales. As one neighbor remarked: ''If farming would have been paying off, Dale would have farmed forever, wouldn't he? . . . Some people can handle debt, and some people can't.'' Mr. Brown meticulously details problems faced by American farmers over the years, and notes the Government's grim prediction that half of this country's 2.2 million farms will be eliminated over the next 14 years. As he writes, ''The deeper personal tragedy of Dale Burr was the fact that he became a victim of a historic process that he himself advanced.''",1990-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,  Airport Security: A Case in Point,"ISSUES of travel security make everyone uneasy. The yes-no aspect of an airport is an example. At departure, an airport is supposed to lure you in and cosset you into the wonders of travel; at the end of the flight, the arrival airport is supposed to welcome you to the new place and hint at its attractions. Instead, corridors are full of barricades that have nothing to do with the architect's plan; plastic shields and conveyor belts impede vistas. It seems unlikely that this stuff, however temporary looking, will ever disappear. On the contrary, airports will in time probably be built to incorporate tight security. will perhaps one day be put into booths or behind panels with little windows like those used by X-ray technicians. The only way that most travelers can cope with hazards beyond their control is to shut them out. If some event makes passengers anxious, they may find themselves in a tug of war between saying nothing - and letting the trip continue, presumably without event - or pointing out a problem and creating a fuss.",1990-01-21T05:00:00+0000

Foreman (above, delivering a punch), the oldest and heaviest of heavyweights, was so impressive as he knocked Cooney out in the second round that sportswriters, who had joked that the 253-pound Foreman would be ordering food between rounds, turned to speculating that the 41-year-old former champion might make a fit opponent for the current titleholder, 22-year-old Mike Tyson. Foreman, who returned to the ring in 1987 after a 10-year absence during which he became an evangelical preacher, turned reporters' earlier derision to his advantage. The press had called the Atlantic City fight ''two geezers at Ceasars,'' so Foreman said that his ring name would henceforth be The Geezer. Archie Moore, the 70-ish former light-heavyweight champion, declared that Foreman's victory had cosmic significance beyond boxing.

Such has been the discouraging story for Jack Levine, one of the foremost Social Realists of his generation, a satirist whose gritty urban iconography and brassy style have often led to comparisons with Goya and Daumier. The son of poor Lithuanian Jews, born in 1915 in Boston, Mr. Levine came to painting with all the ideological baggage of his times. Schooled on the Expressionism of George Grosz, Max Beckmann and Oscar Kokoschka, on Brecht's ''Threepenny Opera'' and the social themes of the Mexican fresco painters, Mr. Levine is dedicated to painting as storytelling, a medium through which one could dramatize good and evil. His has always been an art with a moral edge, an art peopled with victims and villains: skid row derelicts, pompous socialites, corrupt politicians. All of this Mr. Levine tells us in a refreshingly lucid monograph, JACK LEVINE (Rizzoli, $45). Except for the brief and illuminating introduction by Milton W. Brown, a professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center, who helps place Mr. Levine in some historical context, most of the commentary has been taken from recorded interviews. If at times this informality allows for emotional digressions - for example, when Mr. Levine inveighs against the Abstract Expressionists or the shabby treatment he feels he has received at the hands of the art establishment - it is not his rancor that the reader will remember. Rather, it is his humor, erudition and high ideals - and the raw power of his paintings, nearly 200 of which have been reproduced in this handsome volume.",1990-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"Cold, in the Winter Years","The golden years. Senior citizenship. These aren't necessarily euphemisms for age and infirmity. Many Americans age gracefully, in good health, with sound finances and close to children and grandchildren. A half-century of advances in medicine and Social Security has made retirement something to look forward to. For many. For many others, the winter of life is not warmed by any such golden glow. What they are closest to is pain, poverty, loneliness and despair. They may lack a permanent home or -look at the streets - any home at all. That is why The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund pays special attention to older adults. The fund tries to bring warmth and comfort to shivering bodies and desolate minds. It helps many to retain their independence and to avoid institutionalization. For instance, many can remain in their own homes if given assistance, like regular visits by trained and caring aides who can help them shop and cook and provide occasional companionship.",1990-01-21T05:00:00+0000
us,  FICTION,"BALANCING ACTS: Contemporary Stories by Russian Women. Edited by Helena Goscilo. (Indiana University, Cloth, $39.95; Paper, $17.50). What do Russian women want? Everything, apparently, that many other women do: the stable love of a good man and the mad passion of a lover, the security of home and hearth and the fulfillment of professional achievement, the gratitude of their children and freedom from the noose of motherhood. Yet having it all isn't possible, in the Russian view. In ''Balancing Acts,'' 14 modern Russian women look at the contradictions facing them in Soviet society and come up with some poignant portrayals of life's sober realities. In most of these stories, life is a battle between clashing desires on the professional and private fronts, between secret hopes and daily exigencies. The embittered heroine of ''The Wall,'' by Galina Shcherbakova, has risen high on the job, but lives with her husband in mutual loathing. The childless, fading leading lady of Maya Ganina's ''Stage Actress'' sheds her latest lover and wonders what she has lived for. Anna Mass examines both sides of the personal/professional coin: the heroine of one story puts her work first and alienates her young son; in another, a 32-year-old geologist learns she is pregnant and joyfully plans to give up her career. The strongest of the stories capture the universal in the individual, and some of them are about men: ''Peters,'' by the brilliant Tatyana Tolstaya, analyzes, for example, the bittersweet existence of a born outsider. Cleanly translated by a variety of American specialists in Russian literature, this sampling of some of the best writing in today's Soviet Union provides a revelatory glimpse of life ''over there'' and asserts once again the simple truth that in the end, in the things that count, we are all alike.",1990-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,SOME KEEPSAKES,"They are ideas whose time has come. Notions that once seemed far-fetched or just fanciful, they've found a lasting place in the fashion lexicon. Some, like the lean six-button suit, the unmatched vest or the raucously patterned, bottle-shaped tie, have been around before. Wardrobe staples of earlier decades, they've emerged in new contexts as classics for the 1990's. Other now-classic looks once stood at fashion's vanguard. Here to stay, for the foreseeable future at least, are mock turtleneck T-shirts, bold-shouldered jackets and unpadded sport coats with a sweatery feel. Partnerships that would have seemed jarring or even unthinkable only a decade ago are suddenly respectable. Hooded sweatshirts now combine with prep-school blazers; sturdy parkas top off suits. Like the sweatshirt, favored by Manhattan bicycle messengers, a few of these fashions have worked their way up from the streets. Others, once strictly reserved for the woods or high seas, the locker room or the basketball court, are turning up increasingly in urban settings. It's a rare man these days who hasn't tossed an oilcloth slicker over a business suit, toted his files in a backpack, dressed up a denim workshirt with a tie or hiked to the office in sneakers.These days, stiff dress codes seem dated, and style is defined by the way clothes are mixed.

Connecticut boy, born and bred; staunch believer in ''a cheerful Christianity.'' Smart fellow, and clever, too. Had a wicked sense of humor for practical jokes - those Yankees weren't all glum and gloomy. Has been described as con artist, charlatan, hypocrite. Insisted he always gave value for money paid, despite being the self-described ''Prince of Humbugs.'' Supposedly said ''There's a sucker born every minute,'' but did he? (According to A. H. Saxon, definitely not.) Big museum man in New York before he went into circus work. Made a lot of money and set the standard for natural history museums since. Liked to let people know about his achievements; would have been a gold mine for a good public relations man. Also had side ventures in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Boston. First traveling show, in 1871, was ''P. T. Barnum's Museum, Menagerie, and Circus''; great title. Understood the power of promotion and was brilliant at it. ''Advertising,'' he said, ''is like learning -a little is a dangerous thing.'' Fascinating, complex character. ''P. T. Barnum: The Legend and the Man'' should have been a riveting book. Doubt that P. T. would have written it like Mr. Saxon, the editor of ''Selected Letters of P. T. Barnum''; reads like a dissertation: very scholarly, but without much soul. Pity.",1990-01-21T05:00:00+0000

Born prematurely at 25 weeks in Oxford, Imogen lived for five weeks. She was tiny: she weighed one and a half pounds, and her entire hand was only as large as the top joint of her mother's thumb. As recorded here by her mother, the novelist Susan Hill, Imogen's was a staccato life of fits and starts: she was infected during delivery and required antibiotics and a blood transfusion; delicate surgery was required to remove an obstruction in the baby's bowels. Yet, like most preemies, Imogen was a conundrum - one day she was thriving, pink and wriggly, grasping her mother's finger; the next day she developed apnea and suddenly stopped breathing. Ms. Hill describes how she remained dauntless, eager to cling to the small chance that her baby would survive. In fact, Ms. Hill's determination is what drives ''Family'': her first pregnancy at the age of 35 was smooth, and her daughter was born healthy and on time. Ms. Hill tells how, attempting to conceive again, she encountered serious hurdles: she miscarried three times before giving birth prematurely to Imogen. A year and a half after Imogen's death, Clemency was born. Ms. Hill's detailed chronicle should inspire those women who have had problems with pregnancies or are starting families at an older age. Most especially, this book offers a telescopic look at one very young and courageous life.",1990-01-21T05:00:00+0000

In 1983, Mr. Jagger said they would be married ''any day now.'' Then in 1986, after the birth of their son, reports emanated from the Jagger-Hall camp that Mr. Jagger had simply put off the nuptials until a male heir was born. Four years later, Miss Hall has announced that, ''For the first time, we both think marriage is a good thing.'' It was presumed that she meant marriage to each other. Miss Hall, who was in London to star in a revival of ''Bus Stop,'' declined to name the date. Mr. Jagger was unavailable for comment, but one report quoted a Jagger spokesman as saying, ''There are no marriage plans at the present time.''",1990-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,  FICTION,"VOICES IN THE EVENING. By Natalia Ginzburg. Translated by D. M. Low. (Arcade/Little, Brown, $16.95.) Natalia Ginzburg has been recognized for many decades as a major force in Italian letters, but it is only in recent years that her work has begun to be read and appreciated in the English-speaking world. ''Voices in the Evening,'' a short novel first published in Italy in 1961, is the story of a northern Italian factory town during and after World War II. In its pages, quiet ironies abound, despite an occasionally awkward translation. The local patriarch, old Balotta, is a Socialist who has grown rich as the owner of the local textile mill; Purillo, his adopted son, becomes a Fascist, yet is put in control of the business by Balotta because he ''has a good brain.'' Aside from Purillo, Balotta's children are of two kinds: some leave home for vaguely defined lives in other countries, while others stay near their native village. The novel is principally about these latter souls, suffocated in a society that no longer either sparks or nourishes. Elsa, a local woman who narrates most of the book, is only a gentle background presence, transmitting the minutiae of village gossip. The daughter of the factory's accountant, she eventually falls in love with Tommasino, the youngest of Balotta's children; yet this handsome, rich and intelligent young man finds he is unable to love her in return, or indeed to feel anything at all with genuine passion. ''Those others before me,'' he complains, ''they have already consumed all the reserves, all the vitality that there was for us.'' The war, in this fatalistic context, has a curiously intimate quality, as if the characters found it only one more in a series of domestic agonies.",1990-01-21T05:00:00+0000

They're hot stuff. The classic pump that will be shown with the new Chanel collection Wednesday has been completely revamped by Karl Lagerfeld's team.

UAL sold Westin Hotel Co. on Jan. 31, 1988. During the fourth quarter of 1988, it recorded a $24.5 million charge to recognize additional costs assciated with the sale of its nonairline subsidiaries. The provisions for income taxes were $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 1988 and $323.5 million in the year 1988. Latest fourth-quarter results recognized $60 million of actual and estimated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the pilots-management buyout offer, which collapsed in October after financing could not be arranged. Partially offsetting those buyout-related costs was a $40.7 million reversal of accrued expense for stock appreciation rights related to the plunge in the value of UAL stock after the original bid failed. Latest fourth-quarter results also included a $34 million gain on the sale of certain property rights and a $53.6 million gain on disposition of property, principally aircraft. The average number of common shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per share was 21,656,887 for the year 1989 and 29,681,394 for the year 1988.

Maps, to begin with, are of little use. Of course, they tell you which street is where, but they do not - cannot - indicate the abrupt slopes, the sheer valleys, drops, ascents. Genoa is a city of steps, arches, tunnels, funiculars, elevators. You set out for one place, and you end up in another. Where is Genoa's focus? Is it the port? The Piazza De Ferrari? Or the 19th-century Via 20 Settembre with its hotels and shops? Other Italian cities have a specific center: in Naples it is Piazza del Plebescito and the Gallery; in Milan, La Scala or the Duomo; in Venice, Piazza San Marco. But in Genoa, the Duomo, with its tall, horizontally striped facade and its stunning works of art, is on a kind of side street, the open space in front of it is cramped, a dead end.

In 10 years, no one has claimed the prize, but last November a team of students at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo managed, momentarily, to get off the ground - a first.

Saiki (in dinner jacket, above and right), is a Cal Poly senior and manager of the Da Vinci project, with which he has been involved since 1988. Then, Da Vinci 2b was in the works, an improvement on two previous designs. But it didn't fly. Da Vinci 3 was conceived last June by Saiki and a fellow student, Kyle Naydo.

While the story elements central to Greek mythology have remained relatively stable, the oral tradition of Irish storytelling has frequently produced legends that have subtly shifted over time. Such is the case with the tale of Mael Duin, an ancient story of a questing son who sets out in a skin-covered boat called a curragh with a crew of 16 men in order to avenge his father's death. What he finds, as he travels in strange seas, is one bizarre and surrealistic island after another. In a series of dreamlike passages, the men encounter an impassable bridge of glass, giant insects, rivers of fire, strange sacrifices and rituals, and such sights as a small island inhabited by two flocks of sheep, one white and one black, with a brass fence dividing them. The first written fragments of this legend, which the writer and literary critic Frank O'Connor called ''autonomous and primary in the way of Greek and Hebrew literature,'' occur in medieval Irish Christian manuscripts. The monks who recorded the story in ''The Yellow Book of Lecan'' gave it a religious spin, incorporating God's will into the narrative. This shift, notes Patricia Aakhus in a useful introduction to her version of the quest, ''robs the story of dramatic tension.'' More recently, Victorian Celtic revivalists with another agenda cleansed the text of its pagan - and earthy - elements. Now, in this version by an American teacher, writer and actress, pagan elements are properly restored and superfluous additions have been stripped away. What remains is a scholarly yet exciting and vivid rendition of the voyage of Mael Duin, one that has never before been accessible to those without fluent Old Irish. It rings true, and that's what becomes a legend most.",1990-01-28T05:00:00+0000

By the end of the week, the dollar had fallen to 142.85 yen, down from 146.00. At the same time, the Canadian dollar continued to fall sharply against the American dollar as interest rates in Canada appeared to be headed even lower. Since the Bank of Canada signaled in mid-January that it would allow interest rates to fall, investors have been dumping their Canadian dollars.

us,  NONFICTION,"UNFINISHED CONVERSATIONS: Mayas and Foreigners Between Two Wars. By Paul Sullivan, (Knopf, $22.95.) In the annals of peasant and Indian uprisings, the Mayan Caste War of 1847 ranks as one of the most prolonged revolts against a postcolonial government. For more than half a century, the oppressed Maya posed a serious threat to Mexican authority in the Yucatan Peninsula. For the Maya of Quintana Roo state, once a stronghold of the rebellion, it has accrued apocalyptic significance and, through legend and folklore, has served to define their relationship with outsiders and the nature of wars to come. In ''Unfinished Conversations,'' Paul Sullivan, who teaches anthropology at Yale University, uses an intriguing combination of anthropological, linguistic and historical methods to examine the effects of the Caste War on the Mayas' perception of outsiders - missionaries and scholars who have come into contact with the Mayas since the uprising. Relying on letters, journals and scholarly treatises, as well as on his own field work, Mr. Sullivan traces the evolution of that perception, which, over the years, has been characterized by both suspicion and a disarming trust. Most important, Mr. Sullivan's book reveals the process by which a historical event can embed itself in the collective memory of a contemporary society. For the Maya of Quintana Roo, the Caste War, far from being over, is expected to resume someday in the form of a decisive battle; already rumors have drifted in from places like Guatemala or El Salvador. That war, a total war, will once again determine the relationships betwen Mayas and foreigners.",1990-01-28T05:00:00+0000

us,  FICTION,"GOOD INTENTIONS. By Joy Fielding. (Doubleday, $18.95.) Joy Fielding's eighth novel introduces us to Lynn Schuster, a social worker, and Renee Bower, her divorce lawyer, as their seemingly perfect marriages are ending in sexual betrayal. Resentful children, unloving parents, embittered clients and sabotaging male bosses are carefully interspersed throughout the plot to develop well-paced parallels between the two women's experiences. Despite its title, the love in ''Good Intentions'' is warped by male control and female powerlessness; cruelties, both intentional and accidental, are the norm. Ms. Fielding has a keen ear for the stream-of-consciousness monologues of women with low self-esteem. In harsh contrast to the nurturing and assertive stances of their professional lives, Lynn and Renee delude and blame themselves indiscriminately. Renee's husband is a diabolical manipulator who consistently undermines his wife, but his humiliating acts are so overstated that one can't believe this seemingly intelligent woman wouldn't see right through him. Thus even Renee's belated escape evokes more exasperation than empathy. The reluctance behind her liberation, as well as Lynn's, evokes merely pity and implies little growth. One is left with only a cynical and simplistic message: men are strong, women weak.",1990-01-28T05:00:00+0000

He was explaining why he did not buy into the New Germany Fund Inc., which was launched last week. Plenty of other people did buy. The German stock market has fallen 4 percent since it hit a record high on Jan. 3, propelled downward partly by jitters over the outlook for the economic development of Eastern Europe, which have replaced much of the euphoria of last fall. But the New Germany Fund opened at 21 7/8, more than 50 percent above the initial offering price minus underwriting fees. On Friday it traded even higher, closing at 24, which meant buyers were paying an even higher premium of 72 percent. Those who bought more than 19 million shares over the two days - 76 percent of the fund's 25 million shares - were paying $1.57 to $1.72 for $1 of equity.",1990-01-28T05:00:00+0000

For its February issue, Harper's solicited responses from Philip Roth, Walker Percy and other novelists. And on Feb. 5, Lewis H.

Now some of them would like to see the favor returned by means of a jail sentence for Mr. Morris, a 24-year-old computer science student who last week became the first person to be convicted by a jury of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. Mr. Morris admitted planting the rogue program that disrupted 2,500 to 6,000 computers, forcing the days-long shutdown of some systems. His lawyers cast the deed as simply a hacker's prank that went awry. But others argued that it was high time to start meting out real punishment to those who disrupted computer networks.

us,  NONFICTION,"BODY MIKE: An Unsparing Expose by the Mafia Insider Who Turned on the Mob. By Joseph Cantalupo and Thomas C. Renner. (Villard, $18.95.) Any minute now, it seems, there will be more mob canaries with tell-all books than there are mobsters to sing about. ''Body Mike'' comes from Joseph Cantalupo, a Brooklyn real estate salesman, loan shark, con artist and hustler at large, and Thomas C. Renner, whose previous books include ''Mafia Princess'' and ''Mafia Enforcer.'' For years, Mr. Cantalupo had a front-row seat on the daily doings of the mob boss Joe Colombo, who used the realty office owned by Mr. Cantalupo's father as a cover. But Mr. Cantalupo was not privy to what went down behind the closed door where Colombo held court, which is the ultimate weakness of this ''insider'' book. Mr. Cantalupo ran with mob guys and saw and heard plenty, but he was not a ''made,'' or fully initiated, member. He cooked up his share of scams, but he was not a capo or even a soldier. He was not present when murders were plotted or carried out; only after the fact would he learn that someone was ''gone.'' He says he does not even know if his own father was a made member. So his book is a succession of cracked safes, punched noses and quick-buck grabs - sleazy, illegal and small-time. His greatest value as a witness in various Federal trials was his ability to confirm a chain of succession among mob bosses, although he had little contact with the executive branch. As a mere mob associate, Mr. Cantalupo did not flash the audacious perks of organized crime, like the $20,000 pinky rings sported by Colombo. Instead, he filled his days with adulterous trysts, betting, cardplaying, borrowing to bet and sweating out ways to make a quick score to stay ahead of the leg-breakers. He would even steal from the dead: $30,000, in one instance, from a scrubwoman's bank account, before the estate could notify the bank that she had died. Mr. Cantalupo got so deeply in hock that he turned Federal informant for six years. In the book, he whines that various Federal agencies used and discarded him, but his protests ring hollow. He's still hustling, and this book is his latest scam.",1990-01-28T05:00:00+0000
us,  A Losing Temper,"Like a couple of his forehand shots, John McEnroe went over the line during the Australian Open in Melbourne last week. After repeated displays of his well-known ill temper and foul mouth in a tough match against Mikael Pernfors, McEnroe was booted off the court, becoming the first player in 27 years to be disqualified from a Grand Slam event. The 30-year-old former champion at first claimed not to have known that stricter prohibitions against behavior like his went into effect this year. He cursed the umpire, attempted to intimidate a line judge, angrily hit a ball in the direction of the ballboy and, finally, cracked his racquet against the court. He did not apologize, but said that he would have acted differently if he had been aware of the rule change. ''I would probably have still broken my racquet,'' he said. ''But I wouldn't have said what I said to the guy.'' That guy was Gerry Armstrong, the umpire. Ken Farrar, the tournament's chief of supervisors, said that McEnroe's language was the worst he had ever heard in a tennis match. With Farrar's approval, Armstrong called, ''Code violation, further abuse, default Mr. McEnroe. Game, set, match.''",1990-01-28T05:00:00+0000

Word for Windows (which lists for $495 and is intended for high-end I.B.M. PC and PS/2 compatibles that use the DOS operating system) is the first program that combines advanced ''what you see is what you get'' word processing, desktop publishing features, an easy-to-use graphical command structure and powerful tools for customization. Simply put, Word for Windows is a model for the next generation of word processing programs for the DOS and OS/2 operating systems used by most personal computers. More than that, though, it may turn out to be the compelling application that finally prompts many users of DOS-based machines to embrace Windows. It is impossible to discuss Words for Windows without discussing Windows, an ''operating environment'' that sits atop DOS and replaces character-based commands with graphical ones. Windows was introduced by Microsoft nearly five years ago, but it is only now reaching critical mass. The first major Windows-based word processor, Ami, from the Samna Corporation, did not show up until last year, and Word for Windows is only the second to be widely distributed.",1990-01-28T05:00:00+0000

Opposition leaders had criticized her decision to have a second child, saying that the country would be leaderless while she was hospitalized. When that time came, Ms. Bhutto temporarily transferred authority to her mother, Nusrat, who is a member of the National Assembly. In contrast to the opposition, the Prime Minister's supporters danced in the streets a day earlier to celebrate.

In fact, said Dr. Donahue, a science historian, Kepler derived his calculations from his own theory. None of which is to say that the German astronomer is being demoted from the ranks of science immortals to the level of the Piltdown perpetrators. Experts everywhere, while not disputing Dr. Donahue, generally agreed that Kepler's reputation would not suffer. Nor did Dr. Donahue seem to lose any respect for the early scientist.
