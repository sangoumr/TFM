This time, she said, the rifle saved her life and the lives of her three children, and she supports Republican efforts to repeal a law passed last year banning them. But in the audience was another woman, Byrl Phillips-Taylor, whose 17-year-old son, Scott, was shot six times with an AK-47 fired by an 18-year-old classmate, and she was there to show her support of the assault-weapons ban. DELAYS IN CONGRESS -- A new political skirmish broke out in the Senate, again delaying a vote on midyear budget cuts and prompting the majority leader, Senator Bob Dole, to threaten political war against the White House. ""We're not bringing up any more bills that the White House wants until we have some understanding on the legislation that we thought would go through here in a normal way,"" Mr. Dole said, suggesting that President Clinton was orchestrating Democratic efforts to slow work in the Senate. Mr. Clinton responded by chiding Mr. Dole for not having approved millions of dollars in emergency spending to cover the costs of military operations in Haiti, Somalia and elsewhere. But any hope of a quick vote on that bill or the separate midyear budget cuts was further dimmed by a partisan fight over taxation of multimillionaires. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, vowed to tie up debate in the Senate unless it first considered his proposal to close a loophole that has allowed a handful of multimillionaires to renounce their United States citizenship to avoid taxes.

When Next Year Finally Came","Many a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers can remember waiting till next year, for another chance to best the hated Yankees in the World Series. In 1955, the Bums finally avenged five defeats at the hands of their rivals from the Bronx. Stewart Wolpin's BUMS NO MORE! The Championship Season of the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers (Harkavy/St. Martin's, $25) is an affectionate salute to that season of redemption. Pitch-by-pitch accounts of the seven games and dramatic photographs of key plays are the next best thing to a box seat in Ebbets Field or Yankee Stadium. As Mr. Wolpin, a former sportswriter at The Newark Star-Ledger, recounts, the Yankee dominance was such that even oddsmakers in Brooklyn bet against the Dodgers. When the Yankees won the first two games, it looked as if the bookies were right. But the Dodgers won the next three, and after another Yankees victory, ended a 55-year championship drought behind the fielding of Sandy Amoros and the pitching of Johnny Podres. Some of baseball's brightest legends feature in Mr. Wolpin's account, from Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider to Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra and Whitey Ford. But he also vividly evokes life in Brooklyn in the mid-1950's and the euphoria that gripped the borough when next year finally arrived. HANNA RUBIN",1995-04-02T05:00:00+0000

The absent shareholders have sued and will most certainly win, because the board is at fault. The minimum amount of damages acceptable to the plaintiffs is $15,000, which is the cost of the lawsuit so far. Can the board members pay for the lawsuit with funds from the shareholders' maintenance payments or must they use their personal finances first? . . . Caroline Ponticelli, Brooklyn.

The date assigned to Kawakubo for her show was, as it happened, the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and two critics saw in the striped pajamas a reminder of the Nazi death camps. Their outraged reviews, in Le Figaro and The International Herald Tribune, prompted a visit to the Comme des Garcons showroom by members of the European Jewish Congress and a spate of articles denouncing Kawakubo as, at best, an unwitting anti-Semite. As a gesture of conciliation, she withdrew the pajamas from the line. Other items in the collection had been stenciled with numerals, randomly scattered, and with footprints. As the scandal escalated, the pajamas came to be described as stamped with ""identification numbers""; the models, as ""emaciated,"" with ""shaved heads""; and the footprints, as made by military boots trampling the Jews underfoot. (In fact, no numbers appeared on any of the striped garments; many of the models had long hair; and the tread had been made by a basketball sneaker.)

Why not replace the perfectly good headlights while they're at it? You'd be excused for finding Chrysler's deal with regulators a bit convoluted, but it all comes down to that ugly word ""recall."" Even though 29 deaths have been linked to the latches' tendency to pop open in crashes, Chrysler didn't want this to be an official recall, and it got its way. A recall, you see, wouldn't look too great in some coming lawsuits. But how, asked one safety advocate, do you get van owners to come in if you're ""telling them there is no hazard""? (Don't rush in, by the way -- it'll take months to build enough latches.) BANKING The Biggest Get Bigger Nomination for understatement of the week: a merger with the Mitsubishi Bank would, in the words of the Bank of Tokyo's president, ""make an interesting bank."" Interesting, that is, as in huge. The merger of those Japanese banks will create, by far, the world's largest bank -- with $819 billion in assets, it will have more than three times the assets of the not exactly tiny Citicorp -- and 100 times the assets of Bill Gates. Will life change for the rest of the world? Not really. Japan's always had the bank giants, and those banks have been trimming overseas activities, and that's not expected to change. In California, though, Union Bank is 70 percent owned by Bank of Tokyo, and Bank of California is owned by Mitsubishi. No doubt either they'll be merged or one will be sold. UPHEAVALS Will the Flag's Colors Be Next? Americans face a wrenching adjustment. No, it isn't the death of the New Deal, the fall of Communism. It's -- brace yourself -- the colors of M&M's, a constant for nearly half a century. M&M's were born in 1941, in six colors (brown, yellow, red, orange, green and violet). In 1949, tan replaced violet, and that mix outlasted Elvis, Liberace, even Nixon. But Mars Inc. concluded that people don't like tan and ran a poll to pick a new color. And last week it named the winner: blue (even with Communism dead, people weren't ready for pink; it got just a 10 percent vote). The new mix is due in September. In the meantime, save those tans; they'll be collectors' items (if they don't melt). EXECUTIVE SUITE Sex. $20 Million. Read On. Odd as it may sound, this seems to have been W.R. Grace's message to J.P. Bolduc: You've been accused of sexual harassment, so you'd better resign as chief executive, and instead of a $15 million farewell handshake, let's make it $20 million. Yes, when Mr. Bolduc quit unexpectedly a month ago, the official version featured executive-suite boilerplate: ""differences of style and philosophy."" Plus that $5 million bonus. But last week it turned out that a former Federal judge advising the board had concluded that, though Mr. Bolduc was vehement in his denials, allegations of sexual harassment were on solid ground. Add to that the recent resignation of J. Peter Grace as chairman, and it's not exactly a smooth passing of the baton for a $5 billion company. TELEPHONES Whose Long-Distance Savings? Americans must be as sick of hearing about long-distance deals as they are of that Los Angeles trial. But at least the O.J. lawyers, pro and con, don't call you or mass-mail you or ad-blitz you with the latest twist (well, not yet). The question now is whether AT&T, MCI et al. will now rush to tell you the latest news -- that the F.C.C. last week cut by $1 billion a year the access charges they must pay local phone companies, the biggest single cost cut since the Bell breakup. The access charge is a big part of a call's cost -- 4 cents a minute, on each end -- and long-distance companies have been lobbying hard to get them down. But watch carefully to see if those savings are passed along (or -- horrors! -- pay for even more aggressive marketing). TRAVEL Agents' Fees: Never Mind It's the old story. Airlines get together and trumpet some historic change, but then, under market pressure, things slip right back where they were. A few years ago, American, with much huffing and puffing about simplified fares, swept away all the nonsense of having 97 different fares for the same route, and many other carriers piped up, ""Me too."" But there are no simple skies, and when that became clear, the notion collapsed. Then this February came a ""revolution"" in travel agents' fees: No more 10 percent commissions, the airlines said -- the top fee is $50 for a round-trip domestic ticket. But cracks are already appearing: Continental is offering agents a $50 ""bonus payment"" for some costly tickets, and Delta's offering incentives, too. Consumer tip: while this backtracking sorts itself out, don't let yourself get steered to a high-commission fare that's not the best deal. INCOME TAXES It's in the Form? So What? Tax season wasn't already complicated enough, right? Tax forms, it seems, say the self-employed can deduct 25 percent of health-insurance costs. The trouble is, that deduction expired in 1993. But the I.R.S. put it in the form anyway, assuming it would be reinstated. Well, it hasn't -- yet. Why rush? April 17 is two weeks away. The House did vote it back in last week, but the Senate has still to act. If it affects you, better not file till the last minute. . . . Also, for $250-plus donations, you can now, if necessary, get the required receipt after filing. MARKETS Stocks Hit a Bad Bump The stock market heard what it wanted to hear most of the week, and the Dow industrials bumped to a few more new highs. First the Fed met without raising interest rates. Then new-home sales fell 14 percent, to the lowest point in three years -- investors like things cooling off. But Friday morning the bubble burst, partly because of a report that fourth-quarter G.D.P. had grown at a 5.1 percent rate -- too hot for comfort. This was compounded by worries about the dollar -- it rose 2 percent on Thursday after Germany cut its interest rates, but traders wanted more. As a result, the Dow plunged 60 points in the opening minutes, though it later steadied to be off just 14 for the day. INVESTING Ready! Set! Lose Your Shirt! Speaking of Barings -- O.K., nobody's spoken of Barings lately; that's why an update is in order. Nicholas Leeson, who has insisted that he was being a company man when his risky trading brought down Barings, is in a prison in Frankfurt -- that's where he was arrested, en route from Singapore -- as Singapore tries to extradite him on fraud charges. Back in London, though, a stiff upper lip has curled into a sly grin: The Independent is running a ""Lose Your Bearings"" contest. The goal: create an imaginary Asian stock portfolio, and see how much you can lose. Whoever loses the most by April 4 gets a vacation to Singapore -- with, yes, a stopover in Frankfurt (not, presumably, in handcuffs).",1995-04-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Cleanliness Is Next to Chic-ness,"WHAT: The designer bar of soap, a luxury bath accessory produced by companies like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, and most recently by Banana Republic and Gap Scents. Many come with traveling cases or special soap dishes that fit the bar's specific shape. 101 MORE USES FOR THE BATH: Designer soaps are part of a larger trend toward more luxurious bath rituals, said Allan G. Mottus, an independent consultant to the cosmetics industry. The bathroom is increasingly being seen as a place to unwind from a stressful day, and homeowners are upgrading bathrooms with additions like Jacuzzis and multihead showers. Bathing or showering two or three times a day has also become more common, especially with the physically and socially active, said Lois Mander, a spokeswoman at Ralph Lauren Fragrances. These groups often bathe once in the morning, again after working out and maybe once more before going out at night. THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING SOAP: Specialty soaps are both simpler and more advanced than ""off the shelf"" soaps. They boast only natural fats and oils, but their formulas also include additives that their manufacturers say distinguish them from lower-priced bars. The Polo Sport soap, for example, contains luffa particles, and the Safari for Men bar has oatmeal, both to help with exfoliation. Calvin Klein's Escape for Men soaps have algae extracts for moisturizing. Glycerine soaps, like those made by Gap Scents, also act as moisturizers. HOW FAT BECOMES SOAP: The ancient Babylonians began making soap around 2800 B.C. by mixing animal and vegetable fats and oils with plant ashes. Today, commercial alkalis have replaced plant ashes, and many ""soaps"" on the drugstore shelves, like Dove, are made mostly of synthetic detergents. SIGNS OF THE TIMES: For label-conscious consumers, stylish soaps are an inexpensive way to indulge, like designer jeans in the 1970's and couture perfumes in the 80's. ""If you can't actually improve your life style, you take ordinary items and give them the aura of aristocracy,"" the sociologist Stuart Ewen said. FOR ONE SEX OR BOTH: Unlike the traditional designer soaps, whose scents have designated them for one sex or the other, the latest ones, like those from Gap Scents and Banana Republic, have gone unisex. Still, few are economical, even if all members of the household can share them. Gap, designer to the masses, prices its soap at $2.50 for 5 ounces, or 50 cents an ounce, while Calvin Klein's Eternity comes in at the high end, at $27.50 for three 3-ounce bars -- more than $3 an ounce. (A 7-ounce bar of Ivory costs around $1.) MAKING THE GRADE: Although they're proliferating, designer soaps make up only 5 to 10 percent of the $1.6 billion soap industry, said Eric Jungermann, a consultant to the soap industry. Antibacterial soaps like Dial, in comparison, make up 35 percent of all soaps sold nationwide. ""Specialty soaps may be high-quality natural soaps with a better finish,"" Mr. Jungermann said, ""but they're not more effective. A good soap is a good soap."" At a time when flesh-eating bacteria make the cover of news magazines and the recent top-grossing movie ""Outbreak"" is about a highly contagious killer virus, perhaps it's no wonder that the latest product to flex its muscles is soap.

us,Yesterday in Washington,"TAXES -- Speaker Newt Gingrich agreed to demands by dissident Republicans to tie tax-relief legislation loosely to future reductions in the Federal deficit. That removed a big barrier to House passage of the tax bill later this week. The dissidents had held the bill hostage for two weeks, obliquely threatening to block a final vote on it unless they were guaranteed that Congress would not rush tax cuts into law and then renege on its promise to cut spending as well. The accord yesterday gave leaders assurance that their five-year, $189 billion package of tax cuts would pass an increasingly skeptical House. HEALTH INSURANCE DEDUCTION -- The Senate agreed to extend a tax deduction for health insurance for self-employed workers. The measure, contained in a House-Senate conference report, cleared the Senate by a unanimous voice vote and now goes to President Clinton, who is expected to sign it. The measure would allow an estimated 3.2 million self-employed people to deduct for tax purposes 25 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums. MEDICARE -- The Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the elderly will run out of money in 2002, the Clinton Administration told Congress. The annual report said that Medicare's hospital insurance program was now ""severely out of financial balance"" and that there was an urgent need for Congress to address the problem. But it recommended no specific measures. POLICY ON HOMOSEXUALS -- Gay-rights advocates, senior military officers and even some Republicans expressed surprise at Speaker Newt Gingrich's assertion that Congress would try to undo a two-year-old compromise policy on homosexuals in the military. ""This certainly isn't a part of the Contract With America,"" said Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican on the Armed Services Committee.

us,DIARY,"TAXES Numbers Don't (Always) Lie Would it be humanly possible to come up with tax cuts universally considered fair? Of course not. Seventeen experts will get out calculators and show, with mathematical certainty, 17 different evaluations -- which just might be linked to those experts' politics. And so it was when the House passed its tax cuts last week -- triumphantly waving the Contract With America. Republicans pointed proudly to cuts that bulged to 4.4 percent for the middle class and trickled down to 2.9 percent for the wealthy, while Democrats complained that the wealthy would get an outsized share of the cuts. Yes, both were probably right. But more to the point: the Senate is likely to have different ideas, and a Clinton veto looms if it doesn't. In any case, can the nation really afford a tax cut now? In a poll, 55 percent of Americans said no. ENTERTAINMENT Mr. Bronfman Goes Hollywood The lure of Hollywood is powerful, and laden with risk. Sony found that out, losing billions on Columbia Pictures. And Matsushita found it out in its stormy ownership of MCA. But Edgar Bronfman Jr. of Seagram wants to try his hand anyway, agreeing last week to buy 80 percent of MCA from Matsushita. The deal involves some big reshuffling of corporate money -- Seagram's getting the cash by selling most of its Du Pont stake for $8.8 billion -- as well as marking a big shift by Seagram, from drinks to entertainment. And it will undoubtedly involve some big reshuffling in Hollywood, for MCA is likely to lose Lew Wasserman, its 82-year-old chairman, and it's unlikely that Steven Spielberg would keep providing the studio with his golden touch. ADVERTISING Where There's Smoke . . . Cigarette ads on television are illegal, of course -- have been for two decades. It couldn't be clearer. Or could it? If a sports arena advertises cigarettes to fans, and the camera lingers on those ads, does that constitute television advertising? The Justice Department says it does -- though arenas and stadiums are loaded with such ads -- and last week it settled its first lawsuit to close that loophole, as Madison Square Garden agreed to keep the offending ads out of camera range. The Garden called the deal a ""formality,"" since it had removed tobacco signs in November. But the agreement sends a clear signal to other sports sites. Just days later came word that the Marlboro sign at Shea Stadium would be moved to be less visible to cameras. TRANSPORTATION Taxing Interstate Tickets Taxes. Everywhere you go, taxes. And now, if where you go is across state lines by public transportation -- yes, another tax. It used to be that states didn't tax interstate tickets -- the Supreme Court apparently barred that in 1948. But last week the Court said no, that was different -- New York wanted then to tax a bus company's gross receipts. Now it says the ticket price itself is fair game as long as the trip originates in the state -- that way there's no danger of taxing a company twice for the same ticket. But the question is whether states, no matter how starved for cash, would want to take the political heat for levying what would undoubtedly be an unpopular tax. For passengers, not transportation companies, would be hit hardest. COMMUNICATIONS Whatever You Say, Mr. McCaw Craig McCaw had a lot of money burning a hole in his pocket after selling his company to AT&T, and he knows a lot about wireless communications. Nextel, once a high flier in that very field, was badly in need of an investor. So last week, in a marriage that both surely hope was made in technology heaven, Mr. McCaw said he and his family would invest $300 million now -- and perhaps $1.1 billion over six years -- in the struggling company. The deal: Nextel would scrap its effort to build a nationwide cellular network -- ""been there,"" said Mr. McCaw, ""done that"" -- and focus on private dispatch networks, like those for truck or taxi fleets. Nextel's stock sold for a quarter of what it did in the fall before jumping on this news; for $1 billion, it would probably have gone into the diaper business. BANKING Adding Up Chase's Parts In banking, bigger is better, right? Consumer banking, corporate business, global lending -- adding up to a strong, diverse business. That's what giants like Chase Manhattan believe, and Chase is doing fine at it -- its profits growing steadily. But some investors like things simple and easy to size up. If something looks muddled, they want to break it into bite-size pieces -- parts, they bet, worth more than the whole. That's clearly what's happening at Chase. Last week a money manager named Michael Price -- known for pushing to wring all the value he can out of companies -- said he'd bought 6.1 percent of Chase, and the stock shot up 10 percent. THE ECONOMY Too Hard a Landing? What gives? The markets like signs that the economy's slowing to a nice even pace, and most of the week the Dow industrials bumped to new highs for that very reason. But when word came Friday that the unemployment rate had reversed course and risen to 5.5 percent -- a sure sign of slowing -- stocks retreated, with the Dow ending up off 12 after being off 36 earlier. Could things be slowing too much? Manufacturing lost a lot of jobs, and total payroll jobs rose just 203,000. ""We can kiss the soft landing goodbye,"" said one economist. But the Administration was more upbeat -- it needs that soft landing badly -- as Labor Secretary Reich saw the economy in a steady ""glide pattern."" AIR POLLUTION Smog? Cars Have It for Dinner Forget ""zero emission"" vehicles, the lab-coat name for electric cars. The latest answer to foul air is a ""negative emission"" car. No, there's no Mobius strip of a tailpipe, twisted in on itself and spewing exhaust into some Star Trek-style parallel universe. Well, not exactly. Last week Engelhard, which developed catalytic converters in the 70's, came up with a way for cars to, essentially, devour any smog in their path. A new catalyst would break down existing smog, or ozone, into breathable oxygen -- but would do nothing for the car's own exhaust. Sound far-fetched? The stock market didn't think so, as Engelhard stock jumped 30 percent in a day, and futures prices for platinum -- a key part of the process -- hit a four-year high. An unanswered question: after it eats all Los Angeles smog, will it eat Los Angeles too? GEOGRAPHY Take a Left at the Berlin Wall Be realistic. With national boundaries sometimes seeming to shift by the day, with countries born and countries dying, no one could possibly keep up.

us,A Knife to Fool the Cossacks,"David Mamet's PASSOVER (St. Martin's, $14.95) is not a classic retelling of the biblical story in which the Jews of Egypt are freed from slavery. It is instead a particular family's story, an account of how one clever woman, long ago in a Polish shtetl, managed to save her household. Like all of Mr. Mamet's work, this dark little tale is laced with foreboding and imminent violence. It is also rife with trademark Mametian dialogue; the aborted, unfinished sentences have an edgy, staccato rhythm that creates an undercurrent of tension. The setting is one of pure domesticity: an older woman and her granddaughter are in the kitchen preparing food for the seder table. They are making haroset, the mix of apples, raisins, honey, walnuts and wine that symbolizes the mortar used to bind the bricks of ancient Egypt. As the young girl cuts up the apples and chops the nuts, bits and pieces of family lore are revealed. The grandmother has been in the Israeli Army; the samovar brought over from the old country, which an aunt had made into a lamp, has disappeared; but great-great-great grandmother Clara's candlesticks have been saved. Inevitably, since this is a Mamet story, attention is focused on the knife the girl is wielding. And a large, glittering chef's knife figures ominously in many of Michael McCurdy's beautifully rendered drawings. The young girl asks if this was the knife Clara had used, so many years earlier, to thwart death. Her grandmother then tells how Clara, during a pogrom at Passover, created a scene of bloody devastation that fooled the enemy. The rampaging Cossacks miraculously passed over Clara's house; her family survived to tell the tale. The story echoes back to the Jews of ancient Egypt, who marked their homes with blood, avoiding the Angel of Death. But it is also a modern-day parable of survival, a Passover story that in only a few dozen riveting pages showcases Mr. Mamet's fascination with lies, duplicity and a reality that is not quite what it seems.

The company said it would not pay a dividend, because its parent company lost money. That is because the profits in 1994 from the tire and cable companies will not be passed on to the parent, which would make the payout, until this year. Pirelli said the results from the first few months of 1995 indicated that the profit would rise again this year. Consolidated net profit was 110 billion lire, or $65 million, in 1994, in contrast to a loss of 62 billion lire in 1993. Pirelli lost almost 229 billion lire from 1991 to 1993.

us,"Writer, Nice Guy, Has Crush on Bird","It's a certain sign of movie stardom when an actor's early work is hauled off a shelf. Sometimes this is comically embarrassing, as stars turn up with bit parts or bad hair. But ""The Cormorant"" suggests that Ralph Fiennes's current golden-boy aura has at least something to do with wise career moves. This 1993 made-for-the-BBC movie is not some humiliating skeleton falling out of his closet, but a quirky, modest psychological thriller about a man who inherits a possibly malevolent bird. It is also a showcase for Mr. Fiennes, who is in almost every scene. While he is onstage in ""Hamlet,"" which begins its Broadway previews tonight, ""The Cormorant"" will be opening at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, where it was shown briefly in December as part of a BBC retrospective.",1995-04-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Staging A Revolution,"The countercultural revolution in the United States was personified in the Living Theater, the radical theater collective. Founded in New York City after World War II by Judith Malina and Julian Beck, the company began by producing the works of Gertrude Stein and William Carlos Williams before embracing the theories of Brecht and Artaud's esthetic of spectacle and ""cruelty."" The result was a merger of theater, politics and art, John Tytell writes in THE LIVING THEATER: Art, Exile, and Outrage (Grove, $30). The group gained notoriety with productions of ""The Connection,"" about drug addiction, in 1959 and of ""The Brig,"" about brutality in a Marine prison, in 1963. Later in that year, the Living Theater was in the news when the Internal Revenue Service seized its 14th Street loft in lieu of back taxes; members of the troupe staged a sit-in in protest. The company moved to Europe, where members were involved in some of the student strikes of 1968, and did not return to the United States until 1983. Beck died two years later, but the theater continues under Ms. Malina and the playwright and director Hanon Reznikov. Although Mr. Tytell, who teaches English at Queens College, has captured the spirit of the era, he focuses mainly on the dynamics between Beck and Ms. Malina, with long accounts of their personal and sexual activities, as well as a pop history filled with a Who's Who of painters, writers and actors whose lives intersected with the Living Theater.

The 12-mile New Jersey stretch of the four-lane parkway is to be resurfaced for the first time in 23 years, beginning in August. But Bergen County residents are worried about the detours the project will require. In particular, they are concerned about Route 9W, a two-lane highway where four people were injured in a collision last month and two teen-agers died in an accident in December. Transportation officials say that only a fraction of the Palisades' 65,000 weekday drivers would be affected, because resurfacing would be done from 10 P.M. to 7 A.M., one section at a time.

It was associated with women, at a time when buyers of filter cigarettes were most likely to be women. But filters were beginning to catch on with men too, and the redesign was prompted by the desire of Philip Morris, the tobacco company, to have a filter cigarette that would appeal to all. Gianninoto's simplification was, in fact, very like the Campbell's soup can -- red on top, white on the bottom, with a coat of arms that like Campbell's gold medal, tends to disappear.

us,DIARY,"AUTOS No Frugality Goes Unpunished Only in corporate America. A company is prudent, tucks a few billion away for a rainy day and what does it get? Well, just look. Chrysler, recalling past woes, socked $7 billion away, but then Kirk Kerkorian, already Chrysler's biggest shareholder with 10 percent of its stock, said he and Lee Iacocca wanted to buy the whole thing -- in a huge $22.8 billion deal. Not only that, but he wants to reach in and use $5.5 billion of that company nest egg as part of the down payment. If he's just trying to get the share price up, he succeeded, as the stock rose $9.50 in a day. And if he really wants to own it, he's betting big that Chrysler won't need that money. If he's right, he may get more billions; how wonderful for him. But if he's wrong? Few people care if a multibillionaire loses a billion, but it's not just Mr. Kerkorian's gamble. If Chrysler dances on the precipice again, lots of innocent bystanders will pay. AIRLINES Continental Scraps Its Diet Purists may see it as justice for using that mangled spelling, but the demise of Continental Lite last week was more the failure of an idea that some say was doomed from the start. Not that low-fare ""airlines within airlines"" can never work -- United's doing fine with its West Coast shuttle. But Continental's attempt to go lo-cal -- sorry, low-cal -- just never worked. Too many planes were added too quickly, resulting in lots of repairs -- and lots of canceled flights. So the airline, after losing $140 million on the experiment, scrapped it. The logos on 100 planes will be painted over, the first-class seats brought back -- and no more peanuts, or ""peanuts fares."" So, like the waistline of an erratic dieter, fares go up, fares go down. Someday maybe the airlines will get it right. MARKETING Happy Birthday Dear Blunder Do you suppose that Ford Motor, 10 years after offering the Edsel to a resoundingly ungrateful public, celebrated that fiasco's anniversary? Not likely. But, hey, this is the 90's -- everything's upside down. So it was that Coke, far from being red-faced a decade after the ""new Coke"" follies, last week actually celebrated the anniversary of that too-sweet marketing blunder. Maybe, as Pepsi unsweetly suggested, Coke was just ""trying to put the right spin"" on the inevitable anniversary stories. But then again, as Coke's chairman, Roberto Goizueta, pointed out, the company's market value has grown from $9 billion to $75 billion in that decade. New Coke -- which Mr. Goizueta, by the way, decided to introduce -- has not exactly hurt. NO TRUMP If Eloise Could See It Now On Oct. 1, 1907, when the Plaza opened in a blaze of ornate glory, could guests like the Vanderbilts ever have imagined the wild ride the hotel would be taken on by those who held the cash at the century's far end? Could they, in short, have imagined Donald Trump? Surely not. Mr. Trump, a tireless collector of ""trophies,"" bought the Plaza in 1988 -- with borrowed money -- and then borrowed even more on it to help him buy Eastern Airlines, among other things. This house of loans tottered in 1992, with Citibank and other banks winding up the true owners -- and Mr. Trump a 51 percent owner in name only. The banks wanted out, and last week buyers were found -- a Saudi prince (the same one who put big money in Citicorp a few years back) and a Singapore company. The price: $325 million (Mr. Trump had paid $400 million). Eloise, at last report, was cowering in a closet. CURRENCY A Little Dollar That Wouldn't You'd think that if everyone wanted to stop the dollar from falling in value against the yen, something could be done. But forces greater than mere governments are clearly at work here, for even though both Washington and Tokyo want to even things out, the dollar stays weak -- it now buys just 83 yen, compared with 100 in January. Just last week Japan -- its goods becoming awfully costly on world markets -- offered an emergency rescue plan, including a cut in its discount rate to an unheard-of 1 percent. It also moved to promote imports and cut regulations to whittle away at its trade deficit -- seen as the main culprit. To no avail. Exchange rates barely budged, and Tokyo stock prices fell sharply. Back to the drawing boards. LEGALITIES His Appeal Was Not Insane At the 1993 sentencing hearing, the judge in the Crazy Eddie case said his goal from the start had been to redress the wrongs resulting from ""the fraudulent activities of this defendant"" -- Eddie Antar, that is. Irate as he may have been at one of the largest stock frauds ever, that's not the way a judge should talk. At least that's what a Federal appeals panel ruled last week as it overturned Mr. Antar's stock fraud and racketeering convictions, saying the judge had shown prejudice. Mr. Antar may now face a new trial on charges that he inflated the price of Crazy Eddie stock in the 80's. THE ECONOMY Inflation Made at the Fed It really becomes a chicken-and-egg problem: Which came first -- Federal Reserve interest-rate increases or inflation? Yes, the Fed kept saying it was lifting rates to keep inflation nice and cool. But a funny thing turned up in the price figures last week. Yes, inflation was still in check -- producer prices were up just 0.1 percent, consumer prices just 0.2 percent. But where did a big part of that 0.2 percent come from? Directly from the Fed -- its rate increases have driven up automobile finance charges by a third in the past year. And -- surprise! -- that drove transportation costs up far faster than the overall rate. RESTAURANTS The Day the Smoke Cleared ""Excruciating and bothersome"" -- one can easily imagine such words being uttered by a nonsmoker who felt an enjoyable meal had been ruined by someone else's cigarette smoke. But last week it was a smoker voicing that sentiment, as a strict New York law went into effect that bars smoking in most city restaurants. It's ""part of the whole Big Brother thing,"" said another smoker. Restaurant owners are worried -- and, in some cases, poorer. One spent $40,000 for renovations to comply with the law. But is it all fair? Smokers, of course, can smoke on the sidewalk. Then again, nonsmokers could always eat on the sidewalk. TAXES No Discount on Boardwalk, Yet Parker Brothers is having a high old time celebrating Monopoly's 60th anniversary.

D'Amato, the junior Senator from New York who rose out of the Republican machine politics of Nassau County to win three terms in Washington, pick up nicknames like the Fonz and Senator Pothole, shake off accusations of impropriety and win the hand of a glamorous woman-about-town. Some of the headlines have been good; others not. Here are notable events, in brief: Nov. 8, 1994 -- Look, Ma! Top of the World!: D'Amato the kingmaker stands revealed as his hand-picked candidate, George E. Pataki, overcomes Mario M. Cuomo to win election as Governor of New York. January 1995 -- That's Chairman Al, Fella: As a new Congress convenes, Mr. D'Amato ascends to the chairmanship of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Feb. 21, 1995 -- Love, Your Magic Spell Is Everywhere: One week after Valentine's Day, the smitten Senator convenes a news conference to announce he's in love. The object of his devotion is Claudia Cohen, 44, quondam gossip columnist, entertainment reporter on morning television, former spouse of the Revlon executive Ronald O. Perelman. The fact-conscious note that Mr. D'Amato, 57, is still married, though separated from his wife of 25 years. March 7, 1995 -- I Got the Horse Right Here: The most powerful Republican in New York throws his heft behind the Presidential candidacy of Robert Dole of Kansas, and less than a week later, delivers the endorsements of New York State's most powerful Republican leaders including Governor Pataki (but not Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani). April 4, 1995 -- Try This With Your O.J.: In an on-air chat with the morning radio personality Don Imus, the Senator ignites a furor with a mocking Japanese-accented parody of Lance A. Ito, the judge in the O.J. Simpson murder case. April 5, 1995 -- On Second Thought: With his gaffe making front-page headlines and attracting denunciations nationwide, the Senator issues apology No. 1: ""If I offended anyone, I'm sorry."" April 6, 1995 -- If at First You Don't Succeed: Buffeted by continuing attacks on his minimalist apology and his insensitivity, an abashed and contrite Mr. D'Amato takes to the Senate floor to try again: ""What I did was a poor attempt at humor,"" he says. ""I am deeply sorry for the pain I have caused Judge Ito and others."" April 7, 1995 -- Farewell, My Lovely: After 13 years of legal separation, the Senator and his wife, the former Penelope Ann Collenburg, a math teacher at Nassau Coummunity College, are divorced. April 11, 1995 -- One From the Heart: Suffering chest pains, the Senator is hospitalized. April 12, 1995 -- So Long for a While: Given a clean bill of health, the Senator walks out of St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, L.I., and says he plans to take a few days off.

Romancing the Bi-Bop: the French and Their Phone","WHAT: The Bi-Bop, a slim, slick wireless phone with a catchy name and a fashionable following. The Bi-Bop (pronounced BEE-bop), from France, a country that was on line before Americans knew what on line meant, weighs just over six ounces and is powered by two AA batteries. It delivers on-the-go freedom at an affordable price, around $1 less per three-minute phone call, than a conventional cellular phone call, which is about $1.70. But there's a catch: the shortwave technology means it can't be used while driving, and the calling area is limited to the city and its environs. And it can't be used in the United States.HOW TO BI-BOP: Unlike conventional cellular phones, which operate on a much higher frequency, the Bi-Bop sends its signal via digital shortwave, CT2, bouncing its signals off Bi-Bop terminals strategically placed throughout the largest cities of France. Les Bi-Bopeurs know that the mark of the Bi-Bop -- stripes of green, white and blue -- on light posts and signs, gives notice that a Bi-Bop terminal is nearby. If used without a terminal in close proximity, about 200 meters, the phone emits a rhythmic ""dee-dooh, dee-dooh,"" a Gallic ""no dice.""",1995-04-23T05:00:00+0000

It was like a debutante marrying a Las Vegas showman: no one understood how the merger of the elite and staid Time Inc. and the plebian, nouveau riche Warner Communications could work. But it has, largely because of Warner's founder, Steve Ross. Last year our reviewer, David McClintick, called this book ""masterly, and probably definitive."" Another media empire, as wholesome as Warner was glitzy, is analyzed in THEIRS WAS THE KINGDOM: Lila and DeWitt Wallace and the Story of the Reader's Digest, by John Heidenry (Norton, $10.95). The making of an American institution is recounted in a ""hugely detailed, engagingly written history,"" Richard Lingeman said here in 1993. THE CROSSING By Cormac McCarthy. Vintage International, $13. The second novel in the author's projected Border trilogy turns a young boy's peregrinations into a kind of mythical quest. In the 1930's Billy Parham, the 16-year-old son of a cattle rancher, captures an elusive wolf who has been plundering local herds. Instead of killing the animal, he decides to take her back to the mountains of Mexico. Our reviewer, Robert Hass, said in 1994, ""Mr. McCarthy is a great and inventive storyteller, and he writes brilliantly and knowledgeably about animals and landscapes -- but finally the power and delight of the book derive from the fact that he seems incapable of writing a boring sentence."" GENERAL JAMES LONGSTREET: The Confederacy's Most Controversial Soldier -- A Biography By Jeffry D. Wert. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $15. Being a close friend of Ulysses S. Grant's didn't endear James Longstreet to Southern historians, who came to regard him as the diffident bungler who had lost Gettysburg. This study attempts to redeem his reputation. ""The reader comes away with sympathy and respect,"" John Eisenhower said here in 1993. The feelings of ordinary soldiers come to light in WHAT THEY FOUGHT FOR, 1861-1865, by James M. McPherson (Anchor/ Doubleday, $10). Using passages from diaries and letters, the author argues that the Civil War rank and file was often as deeply committed as its leaders. Our reviewer, Hal Goodman, found last year that some of the men's opinions were ""striking, most notably the balancing act that many Southern soldiers performed with the concept of slavery."" Intense passion for the Union cause imbues HARD MARCHING EVERY DAY: The Civil War Letters of Private Wilbur Fisk, 1861-1865, edited by Emil and Ruth Rosenblatt (University Press of Kansas, $15.95). This correspondence chronicles a Vermont volunteer's daily life, in and out of battle. ""What may be surprising is just how literate a man Fisk was and what a firm grasp he had on the events of his day,"" John Glenn said here in 1992. The political forces behind the Northern Army are the subject of FREE SOIL, FREE LABOR, FREE MEN: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War, by Eric Foner (Oxford University, $13.95), which has been restored to print in an updated edition. The Republicans' hatred of slavery was genuine and not an excuse to further their economic aims, the author says. In 1970 our reviewer, David Donald, called it a ""carefully researched, fair-minded book."" STONES FROM THE RIVER By Ursula Hegi. Scribner Paperback, $12. Trudi Montag is a dwarf -- in Nazi Germany, that is little better than being a Jew. But her deformity confers on her a kind of independence, which allows her to become a conscience for her town. ""This moving, elegiac novel commands our compassion and respect for the wisdom and courage to be found in unlikely places, in unlikely times,"" Suzanne Ruta said here last year. THE COLOR CURTAIN: A Report on the Bandung Conference By Richard Wright. Banner/University Press of Mississippi, $15.95. In 1955 the author traveled to Indonesia to attend a meeting of 29 African and Asian countries that were to discuss ""problems of colonialism and racialism."" This book is his analysis of the proceedings, which had special resonance for him as a black man and a Westerner. In 1956 the reviewer for The New York Times, Tillman Durdin, called it ""a vivid and illuminating job of reportage."" The same publisher has also reprinted SAVAGE HOLIDAY ($16.95), Wright's only novel with no black characters. First published in 1954, it focuses on a retired, middle-aged insurance executive who has to take measure of his own morality when he inadvertently causes the death of a child. AS MAX SAW IT By Louis Begley. Fawcett Columbine, $10. The pain of deception -- particularly self-deception -- is an underlying current in this novel, which presents a homosexual relationship through the eyes of an uninvolved, ostensibly heterosexual man. In 1994 our reviewer, Bruce Bawer, described it as ""a consummately beautiful -- and major -- work of literary art."" IF YOU KNEW ME By Anne Roiphe. Warner, $11.99. Romance for the unmarried and over 40 is a cautious dance, requiring careful steps, the author suggests. In this novel the lovers are a molecular biologist and a schoolteacher who has assumed the care of his disturbed younger sister. ""It lets us gaze into the honest lives of people caught together as if in the unforgettable, poignant yet almost meaningless arrangements of shell and sea-wrack,"" Robert Kelly said here in 1993. NOW YOU SEE HER By Whitney Otto. Ballantine, $12. Kiki Shaw, a researcher for a game show, is growing invisible as she gets older -- a problem for most women, except that hers is not metaphorical.

us,Diary,"CURRENCY Big Bird to the Rescue? While the American dollar plunged last week to post-World War II lows against the yen, frustrations grew in Japan as hopes for a bright recovery there faced away. In Tokyo, Japanese protesters -- some in animal suits -- blamed the United States for pushing up the yen. HEALTH CARE It's Raining Mergers The way health care companies are pairing two by two, you'd think the Flood were coming tomorrow. Last week -- in the second billion-dollar consolidation of home health care companies in 60 days -- Coram Healthcare agreed to buy Lincare Holdings for about $1.38 billion. On March 2, Abbey Healthcare Group and Homedco Group had announced plans for a $1 billion merger, themselves. The Coram half of soon-to-be Coram-Lincare was itself born of a four-way merger just last year. One analyst indicated the home health care business would, indeed, flood Coram-Lincare and Abbey-Homedco -- with money. She estimated that they would each command about 17 percent of the industry's $7 billion market next year. COPING Japanese Companies on Guard Fearing a relapse into recession, several Japanese companies -- Mazda Motor, Mitsubishi Materials and Sumitomo Metal Industries are included -- have announced austerity plans. Big companies, at least, seem highly capable of coping with the export-threatening rise of the yen. But the Japanese economy might not fare as well. Indeed, analysts indicated last week, the country's lifetime employment system may be in jeopardy. ARMS CONTRACTORS A Moveable, Affordable Feast Georgia's in. Washington's out. Where costs are low, military hardware manufacturing plants are bustling. Where costs are higher, wildflowers are growing around shuttered plants of the same sort. It's as if military contractors are collectively moving the party -- albeit a smaller, post-Reagan affair -- to any location where the tab will be most easily digested. Also on the in list: Colorado, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi. In some cases, the companies are even seeking what economists say are gifts of public goods like roads, schools and municipal airports -- and getting them. Georgia's Cobb County, for example, is about to pay for a multimillion-dollar rail underpass to give a warm welcome to Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest arms contractor. WEALTH The Divided States of America Picture a classroom of third-graders herded into two groups. Less than a quarter of them are sporting Hanna Andersson all-cotton separates. The rest are draped in itchy, ill-sized hand-me-downs. Hands on hearts, they chant, ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands: one nation, under God, economically divisible . . . ."" This amendment to the egalitarian pledge seems fitting: New studies were shown to establish last week that America has become the most economically stratified of industrial nations. A very few possess much of the wealth. And, as a Brookings Institution fellow pointed out, because political campaigns in America are ruled by money, the financial extremes could well intensify. (In what could become a kind of reverse-Robin Hood legend, Republicans today are seeking cuts in Federal welfare programs and taxes.) And the country as a whole may end up suffering right along with those poorly dressed third-graders: One economics expert asserted that America, with a child poverty rate four times the average of its principal industrial competitors', could find itself at a big competitive disadvantage by the time today's children join the work force. AUTOS Mini-van Monday? If the audacious billionaire Kirk Kerkorian succeeds in buying Chrysler -- mind you, this is a big if -- and the auto maker is left heavily in debt as a result, analysts believe the bottom lines of shareholders, along with mini-van buyers, would be affected. The analysts point to Philip Morris scrambling to cut Marlboro cigarette prices two years ago in an effort to stem the loss of sales to lower-priced competitors. Chrysler, it follows, would be forced to cut prices because with the debt on its books, ""Ford and G.M. would have a field day"" going after its product lines, said the automotive stock analyst Nicholas Lobaccaro. After Philip Morris announced its cut, the company suffered a sharp selloff that left its shareholders $13 billion poorer. With Chrysler, Mr. Lobaccaro predicted, instead of a Marlboro Friday, ""you would have a mini-van Monday."" WALL STREET Salomon Is Still Bleeding Somebody get Salomon Brothers a tourniquet! Since a pay plan cutting the compensation of its managing directors was announced late last year, the investment bank has lost 10 percent of those directors. Three were added to the list last week -- even as the firm, which reported 1994 after-tax losses of almost $400 million, announced an easing of the restrictive pay plan. Analysts were skeptical about how effective the new plan would be. If it is shunned, management will probably have to pay still more to keep valued workers. LENDING Sure, It's Less Red Tape, but ... Banks that make loans to small businesses are no doubt sighing in relief. Thanks to an overhaul of regulations aimed at encouraging banks and savings and loan associations to make more loans in moderate- and low-income areas, they face a lot less paperwork. But the relaxed reporting requirements, adopted last week, are more relaxed than some minority-rights activists believe is healthy. Under the new rules, banks do not have to collect and report information on the race and sex of their small-business borrowers -- as they have to do for home mortgages under the Community Reinvestment Act. The collection of those details was sought by community and consumer groups as a method of uncovering lending bias. But Federal regulators sided with bankers and Republicans in control of Congress and dropped the proposal. The Federal Reserve will, however, let banks, insurance companies and investment houses gather and publish data on business loans by sex and race -- on a voluntary basis. MEDIA The Last Word in Houston What to read in Houston? Why, the Chronicle, of course. The choice between it and the Houston Post was eliminated last week when Hearst, the owner of the 94-year-old Chronicle, bought the 111-year-old Post from Consolidated Newspapers -- and shut it down. At a loss for words, printed or spoken, Post staff members embraced to comfort each other. Now, as the country's fourth-largest city, Houston is the largest city in the country with a single major daily metropolitan newspaper. It has plenty of company across the nation. In Milwaukee, the Sentinel merged with the Journal on April 2, and Providence, R.I., the Evening Bulletin is set to merge with the Journal on June 5. SWINDLES 'I'm Not Entirely to Blame' No doubt, this is the headline Steven Hoffenberg would like to have dictated about his guilty plea last week to criminal conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with a $460 million Ponzi-scheme that he ran through his flagship company, Towers Financial. After the Securities and Exchange Commission had accused him of being a swindler, Mr. Hoffenberg had directed the coverage of his own regulatory troubles in what was then his New York Post. (The Post is now owned by the News Corporation.) In his court appearance last week, Mr. Hoffenberg made accusations against Towers accountants. He did the same thing earlier with one of his lawyers.

The tribe had planned on breaking ground for the project last month and being in operation by the end of 1995. In a year, some financial analysts predicted, the Mohegans would be grossing as much as $240 million from slot machines alone with as much as $60 million of that going to the State of Connecticut's coffers. But the tribe and their business partners cannot begin the conversion of a plant that used to make nuclear reactor components for submarines into a casino until the 240-acre site becomes part of the Mohegans' 700-acre Federal Indian reservation.",1995-04-23T05:00:00+0000

us,The Rimbaud Connection,"For his entire life, David Wojnarowicz (1954-92) threw himself whole into art. He had been a wanderer, a hustler and a drug addict; his first serious photographs -- a series called ""Arthur Rimbaud in New York"" (1978-79) -- depicted various young men in T-shirt and jeans (all wearing a mask of the poete maudit) reading a magazine, masturbating on a dingy hotel bed, leaning against a white wall while shooting up or riding in a graffiti-covered subway car. Wojnarowicz died of AIDS and wanted to visualize his pain: over a black-and-white photograph of pleading, bandaged hands, he silk-screened in red the words ""I am a glass human disappearing in rain. I am standing among all of you waving my invisible arms and hands. I am shouting my invisible words. I am getting so weary. I am growing tired."" Through essays and interviews as well as the photographs, paintings and writings reproduced in DAVID WOJNAROWICZ: Brush Fires in the Social Landscape (Aperture, $35), a fresh portrait of the artist -- notorious for his homoerotic art, AIDS activism and battles against censorship -- gradually takes shape. Wojnarowicz emerges not as a major artist but as a young man whose work spoke honestly and poignantly of his fascination with nature, sex and desire, and of his suspicion of authority. Above all, Wojnarowicz seems to have relished photography's possibilities. In ""Where I'll Go After I'm Gone"" (1988-89), vignettes of moons, eyes, trees, men, a horse and a winged foot dance on a grid of wheels and mechanisms. Just like his pain, David Wojnarowicz's delight could be awesome. CHRISTINE SCHWARTZ HARTLEY",1995-04-23T05:00:00+0000

The Marco Polo is distinguished by its four-inch bloom, many medium-size thorns, leathery leaves and large conical buds, all described in some detail in the patent. Also important in plant patents is lineage. Meipaleo's seed parent was Meinuzeten, marketed under the name Ambassador. The pollen parent was a cross between Sunbright and Anne-Lise Rothenberger.

us,Right-Wing Movements Around the Country,"Here are the principal centers of political organizing and training for the right-wing Patriot Movement, an umbrella movement for a loose confederation of militant right-wing groups that believe the Federal Government is seeking to control its citizens. 1. Harbor Springs, Mich.: Headquarters for the Michigan Militia Corps, a paramilitary organization with ""brigades"" in 73 of the state's 83 counties. The militia's leaders said on Saturday that James and Terry Nichols, who are in custody, attended a brigade meeting in Sanilac County and were asked to leave after urging militia members to tear up their driver's licenses and Social Security cards, to stop paying their taxes and to take other steps to defy the Government. The Michigan Militia claims 12,000 members but that cannot be verified. 2. Dexter, Mich.: Home base for Mark Koernke, 37, a building maintenance worker at the University of Michigan, and one of the nation's most militant militia leaders. Koernke has an hourlong radio show, ""The Intelligence Report,"" broadcast nationally five-nights a week on WWCR, a short-wave station in Nashville that broadcasts neo-Nazi and white supremicist programs. 3. Adrian, Mich.: Base of the Proclaim Liberty Ministry, which operates a telephone line for militia organizers and sells has more than 50 videotapes for sale on militia activities and other written militia materials. Accepts only gold or cash for payment. 4. Hillsboro, W.Va.: Headquarters of the National Alliance and home of William Pierce, a white supremacist and author of ""The Turner Diaries,"" a 1979 novel that describes a white supremacy takeover of the United States, including the fertilizer and fuel oil car bombing of the F.B.I. building in Washington. Pierce's radio program, ""American Dissident Voices,"" frequently includes interviews with militia organizers and is heard on nine AM and three FM radio stations in nine states, and on a short-wave radio station in New Orleans. 5. Indianapolis: Headquarters of Linda Thompson's American Justice Federation, which markets aggressively anti-Government books, videotapes and radio programs. Thompson, a former civil liberties lawyer, operates a public relations company and has a program on AM and short-wave radio. She almost single-handedly made the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Tex., a rallying cry for resistance against the Government. She produced two documentaries in 1993, ""Waco, the Big Lie,"" and ""Waco, the Big Lie Continues,"" that accused the Government of used flame throwers to start the fire that destroyed the compound. She also called on militias to stage an armed march on Washington on Sept. 19, 1994. It was canceled after militia leaders said it was too radical. 6. Noxon, Mont.: Headquarters of the Militia of Montana, one of the largest such groups. Founded by John Trochmann, 51, his brother, David, 48, and Randy Trochmann, 27, a nephew. John and David Trochmann, who once operated a snowmobile parts company in Minnesota, run a communications and sales operation for militia videos, books and other materials. They train militia members from other states and have helped hundreds of these groups get started. 7. Kamiah, Idaho: Base of James (Bo) Gritz, a former Green Beret commander in Vietnam and founder of Almost Heaven a Christian Covenant Community, which holds that white people are the masters of the earth and are preparing for possible confrontation with the Government. Gritz's paramilitary training has been copied by other militias. Gritz was instrumental in protests that followed the killing of the wife and son of Randy Weaver, a white supremacist, during a Federal siege of Weaver's Idaho home in 1992. He ran for President in 1992. 8. Blackfoot, Idaho: Base of the influential United States Militia Association and its founder, Samuel Sherwood. Sherwood advocates that militias become prepared for civil war and has trained militia leaders in eight states. His public statements have been extreme. ""Civil War could be coming and with it the need to shoot Idaho legislators,"" he said at a militia meeting on March 2. (Sources: The Coalition for Human Dignity, the Center for Democratic Renewal, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith, the Southern Poverty Law Center, The Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission, Political Research Associates.)",1995-04-24T05:00:00+0000

us,N.B.A. EASTERN CONFERENCE PLAYOFFS,"Orlando Magic, 57-25, First Place, Atlantic Division vs. Boston Celtics, 35-47, Fourth Place, Atlantic Division Key Players Orlando: Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee Hardaway represent the preeminent point guard-center tandem in the league. combine that with Dennis Scott's and Nick Anderson's shooting and Horace Grant's rebounding. They need to avoid going to the line. Key Players Boston: Eric Montross has been known to get under Shaq's skin and Dino Radja will Grant honest on defense, but the backcourt of Dee Brown and Sherman Douglas is the main keys to shaking down the Magic. Season Review Orlando: Magic ran away with the league's best record until fading down the stretch. Never mind the 39-2 mark at the O-rena; Shaq and friends were a very unFinalslike 18-23 on the road. They lost 6 of their last 10. Season Review Boston: After an abysmal start, the Celtics played through distractions and finished strong. They beat Orlando twice in the regular season, but were only 20-21 at Boston Garden. Prediction: Too much Shaq, never mind season series, Orlando in four. New York Knicks, 55-27, Second place, Atlantic Division vs. Cleveland Cavaliers, 43-39, Fourth place, Central Division Key Players Knicks: Patrick Ewing should have monster series, but Knicks need consistency from John Starks and Hubert Davis from perimeter. Derek Harper's job? Harass Mark Price. With Cavs' decimated frontline, Charles Oakley should dominate. Key Players Cavaliers: Cavs are still thin at guard even though price is back, he would have to average 30 points to stop the Knicks. Michael Cage and Greg Dreiling are merely too immobile to stop Ewing, Oakley and Anthony Mason. Season Review Knicks: A year after their championship run, they again found a way to overcome distractions, injuries and an offense that took the holidays off. Mentally, Pat Riley has them poised for a return trip. Season Review Cavaliers: Only the Democratic Party lost more starters than the Cavaliers this season. Coach Mike Fratello somehow found a way to milk 43 victories out of a team wrecked by injury. Recent slide does not bode well for playoffs. Prediction: Cavs simply don't have firepower. Knicks in 3. Charlotte Hornets, 50-32, Second place, Central Division vs. Chicago Bulls, 47-35, Third place, Central Division Key Players Charlotte: Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning represent the main obstacle in Chicago's path. Muggsy Bogues's ability to run the half-court set is important, but Del Curry's scoring role off the bench cannot be overlooked. Key Players Chicago: The Hornets need to treat No. 45 like an infectious disease, and quarantine him. For all Scottie Pippen's contributions, the series may come down to how hard B.J. Armstrong hits the open jumper. Season Review Charlotte: Re-emergence of L.J. and 'Zo helped them dash memories of last season's lottery-bound bunch. Scott Burrell is out for the season, though, and that hurts. Allan Bristow's job was saved by his players, can they save him again in the playoffs? Season Review Chicago: Scottie Pippen wanted out, the new United Center was no place like their old home and the Bulls were talking Urban Renewal Project. Re-enter Jordan, and all is well again. Prediction: Hornets have home-court advantage, but Michael Fever prevails. Bulls in 5. Indiana Pacers, 52-30, First Place, Central Division vs. Atlanta Hawks, 42-40, Fifth Place, Central Division Key Players Pacers: Reggie Miller is priming for another run at the Knicks and Rik Smits has been playing better than at any time in his career. Dale Davis and Antonio Davis are too strong inside for Grant Long and Antonio Lang to handle. Key Players Hawks: Stacie Augmon (sprained left ankle, probable) and Mookie Blaylock will try and rattle Mark Jackson in the foreourt. Craig Ehlo can still create his own shot, but Steve Smith from beyond the arc is key component. Season Review Pacers: Despite their perceived dominance, Indiana is only 19-22 on the road. Sure, Jackson has been a catalyst at the point, but the Pacers still rely too much on Miller to come off screens to save them in the crunch. Season Review Hawks: Lenny Wilkens overtook Red Auerbach, but that was it for milestones. The Hawks are 21-13 since Feb. 6 and have won 5 of their last 7, but they are clearly not the team Indiana beat in 6 games in the second round a year ago. Prediction: Miller may be contained, but not stopped. Indiana in 4.",1995-04-25T05:00:00+0000

us,BUSINESS DIGEST,"As Finance Ministers Meet, Harmony Stays at Home Public harmony was notably absent as finance ministers of seven of the world's leading industrial nations met in Washington. A coordinated response to the world's currency roller coaster is ""not acceptable,"" Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany has said; the Japanese see a weak dollar as an American problem that America should deal with, and Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, blamed the Federal Reserve for failing to raise interest rates even more. The discord has economists worried. A1. Stronger international financial institutions were proposed by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Mr. Camdessus to avert Mexican-style crises. D7. Boeing: Profit Off, Stock Up Boeing earnings dropped 38 percent, to $181 million, or 53 cents a share, mainly because of fewer deliveries -- 59 commercial jets, down from 82 in 1994's first quarter. But Wall Street was expecting an even worse performance, and the company's stock touched a 52-week high. D8. Hillhaven Takes Vencor Bid Hillhaven accepted a $1.4 billion buyout offer from Vencor, a much smaller hospital chain. Hillhaven, the big nursing home chain, had just turned away another bidder. D2. Lloyd's: Down, Not Out Lloyd's of London will survive, it said, responding to news reports of its possible demise. This year looks bleak, but it has ""utter confidence"" for the long haul. D10. Phar-Mor, With or Without Haft Phar-Mor offered two blueprints for emerging from bankruptcy. One would involve Robert Haft, former Dart Group president, but the company filed a separate reorganization plan in case talks with Mr. Haft fall through. D2. Microsoft Defends Antitrust Deal Microsoft and the Justice Department defended their antitrust settlement in a Federal court, while opponents of the deal said a judge was right to strike it down. D4. Chiron Bets on Gene Therapy Chiron will acquire Viagene in a $95 million deal, placing a big bet on a gene therapy company the market had abandoned. D4. Weather Lets Nynex Down Nynex's earnings rose less than expected, and it said one culprit was the weather. A year ago, pinned inside by an exceptionally cold winter, people talked and talked. This year's mild winter meant mild earnings. D7. Urging 'Brand' Appeal For Newspapers Newspapers should build brand identities and imitate the way American auto makers rebuilt their good names, the president of the Newspaper Association of America said at its New Orleans convention. The problem: even though newspapers' revenue is high, their share of ad dollars keeps shrinking and just 62 percent of American adults are daily readers, down from 78 percent in 1970. D4. The Risks of Playing It Safe For a natural gas company, it's an odd way to operate. Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas protects itself from volatile prices by hedging heavily -- which is fine if prices fall, but it'll lose out if prices rise. Investors are not impressed. Market Place. D12.

us,N.B.A. Western Conference Playoffs,"San Antonio, 62-20, First Place, Midwest Division vs. Denver Nuggets, 41-41, Fourth Place, Midwest Division Key Players San Antonio: David Robinson has had trouble venturing into the Land of Mutombo before, but Dennis Rodman's work underneath has freed him up to score more. If Chuck Person gets hot off bench, it's over. Key Players Denver: Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf has missed 5 of last 7 games with bruised right leg and sprained right ankle. Reggie Williams and Dikembe Mutombo need to step up offensively. The rookie Jalen Rose has to neutralize Vinny Del Negro. Season Review San Antonio: Rodman's motorcycle accident notwithstanding, Spurs are unflappable on the road (29-12). After a slow start they have been on fire, winning their last six and a league-best 62 overall. Season Review Denver: Moving from the front office back onto the floor after Dan Issel and Gene Littles could not get the Nuggets to perform, Bernie Bickerstaff somehow guided them away from the lottery and into the postseason with a late rush. Prediction: Spurs won't go down like Seattle a year ago. Spurs in four. Phoenix Suns, 59-23, First Place, Pacific Division vs. Portland Trail Blazers, 44-38, Fourth place, Pacific Division Key players Phoenix: Charles Barkley imposes his will on a series like only Michael Jordan can. Whether Kevin Johnson can contain Rod Strickland is tantamount. Dan Majerle needs to find his stroke by the second round, or Suns are in trouble. Key Players Portland: Cliff Robinson has picked up some of the scoring slack since Clyde Drexler left for Houston. Otis Thorpe has given them more bulk, but Blazers offense no longer puts a premium on creativity. Season Review Phoenix: Danny Manning's injury before all-star break cast a pall over a franchise seemingly destined for the finals. Barkley has carried their hopes for a ring on his shoulders since then. Who says you can't win the N.B.A. championship without a dominant center? Detroit and Chicago, from 1989 to 1993, that's who. Season Review Portland: New coach, new style, but they can't hide the wrinkles. Terry Porter and Buck Williams are role players now. The Blazers, once favored and omnipotent in the West, did very well to finish above .500. Prediction: Rivarly or not, it's a Sir Charles Show. Phoenix in four. Utah Jazz, 60-22, Second Place, Midwest Division vs. Houston Rockets, 47-35, Third Place, Midwest Division Key Players Utah: League's all-time assist leader (John Stockton) and premier power forward (Karl Malone) in sync like they've never been. Key to this series, however, is Jeff Hornacek's all-around play. Key Players Houston: The Drexler Factor is huge. He can post up Hornacek and create in the open floor. Worry not for Hakeem Olajuwon, worry for his teammates. Vernon Maxwell needs to stick the open 3-pointer and Kenny Smith must play with more poise than panache. Season Review Utah: The Jazz get along on and off the floor like no other team. Chemistry may not win a title, but it certainly makes up for the lack of an All-Star center. After a brief lull, they enter playoffs as league's hottest team, having won 7 straight. Season Review Houston: They began their repeat quest with an amazing November run. What happened? Shaky backcourt, Maxwell's temper and general team malaise. May become first defending champion to get knocked off in first round since Philadelphia in 1984. Prediction: Great theater, but Utah controls tempo. Jazz in five. Seattle SuperSonics, 57-25, Second place, Pacific Division vs. Los Angeles Lakers, 48-34, Third place, Pacific Division Key Players Seattle: So many starters lingering on the bench, so few minutes. More important than Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton sparkling in this series is how well Kendall Gill and Sam Perkins defend and shoot from the perimeter. Key Players Lakers: Cedric Ceballos playing well since his return from injury. Challenge of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones is to break the most-aggressive trapping defense in basketball. Season Review Seattle: Sonics as dangerous as Orlando when they get on a run, but also as disastrous when they fall apart offensively. Though Payton's defense and Kemp's power inside compensate, their half-court set is not up to Finals specifications after 82 games. Season Review Lakers: Jerry West has slowly rebuilt an emerging Western Conference power from the ground up. It's not Showtime II, but the Lakers may be one player away from title contention again. Prediction: Sonics lost four of five to Lakers in regular season, but wake up for the playoffs. Seattle in five.",1995-04-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Heavy Metal Heroes,"Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor from 1493 to 1519, aptly illustrated the Renaissance concern with individual consciousness when he said, ""The man who makes himself no memorial in life is forgotten with the tolling of his death bell."" According to Stephen K. Scher, the editor of THE CURRENCY OF FAME: Portrait Medals of the Renaissance (The Frick Collection/ Abrams, $95), the quest for immortality that marked the Renaissance led to the development of the portrait medallion. For, as Mr. Scher argues, these medals were considered the perfect vehicle for the sitter's aspirations of immortality. Emperors, popes, the Medici and wealthy merchants all had their images captured in this medium. Strangely, however, for all their beauty, the medals have wallowed in art-historical obscurity while Renaissance architecture, painting and sculpture have been studied in great detail. ""The Currency of Fame"" seeks to correct this imbalance. Mr. Scher, a former chairman of Brown University's art department, has assembled 31 scholars to write entries on 170 medals. The book is meticulously researched, skillfully written and lavishly illustrated, with 495 photographs, many in color. Often the writing unlocks the psychological depths possible in these portraits; the brief biographical segments place the works in historical context, the only way these political, social and cultural statements could be fully deciphered. Unfortunately, the book settles into a predictable pattern, the short entries giving it an encyclopedic flavor; it is, finally, destined more for research than general reading. DOUGLAS A.

And Cybill is there for Maryann, who has been known to telephone her friend from her walkin closet, nervous that she is seconds from going to bed with a new man. Cybill and Maryann lunch together, work out at the gym together, stalk Maryann's ex-husband together and commiserate on the trials of life after 40. They're part of a long line of sitcom female best friends. But oh, how those twosomes have evolved! They've always been women of their times. ANITA GATES Lucy and Ethel, 1951-57 Era -- Life revolved around home and husbands when Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) and Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance) were pals on ""I Love Lucy"" (CBS). The girls always wanted to go to a nightclub; the boys always wanted to go to the fights. Living Arrangements -- The same New York Apartment building. Specialty -- Silly capers. Balance of Power -- The Mertzes own the building, but Fred (William Frawley) and Ethel are round and middle-aged while Ricky (Desi Arnaz) and Lucy have youth and beauty on their side. Lucy is a little nuts, but Ethel almost always goes along with her schemes, from dressing up as Martians to sneaking into Richard Widmark's backyard. Lucy returns the favor at least once, posing as the Mertzes' maid to impress a visiting friend of Fred's. Togetherness -- The couples go everywhere together (Hollywood, Europe), and when the Ricardos move to Connecticut, the Mertzes soon follow. Loyalty -- Stong, but when Lucy loses her bit part in an Italian movie by soaking up local color literally (during a fight with a fellow grape stomper), Ethel accepts the movie part herself. Gleefully. Mary and Rhoda, 1970-74 Era -- In the 70's, when Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore, right) and Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) were best friends on CBS's ""Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" working women who were over 30 and single had to stick together. Living Arrangements -- Apartments in the same Minneapolis house. Specialty -- Moral support. Balance of Power -- Mary is prettier and thinner and has a better job (television news producer; Rhoda is a window dresser) and a nicer apartment. Even Rhoda's mother likes Mary better. But Rhoda is braver (she even calls Mary's boss by his first name). Togetherness -- Largely home-base, although Rhoda does turn up at Mary's office now and then. Loyalty -- Strong. Mary takes in Mrs. Morgenstern when Rhoda decides she can't deal with one more maternal visit. Rhoda stays up all night helping Mary meet a deadline for writing obituaries. Still, after four seasons, Rhoda dumps her and leaves town faster than you can say ""spinoff."" Laverne and Shirley, 1976-82 Era -- ABC's ""Laverne and Shirley"" was set in the 1950's (as seen nostalgically from the feminist 70's), when single women shared a single goal: as Shirley says just after Laverne has gone face-down into a chopped-liver sculpture, ""I just thought that we might meet a couple of rich guys."" Living Arrangements -- Laverne De Fazio (Penny Marshall) and Shirley Feeney (Cindy Williams) share a modest apartment in Milwaukee. Specialty -- Silly man-hunting capers. Laverne gets her hand stuck in a crematory urn while trying to impress a handsome mortician. Balance of Power -- Shirley is naive. Laverne is manipulative. Togetherness -- They work together at a brewery and double-date a lot. When Shirley really, really wants to attend a cocktail party at the Pfister Hotel to meet businessmen, Laverne accompanies her, even though she has just completed a sleep-deprivation experiment and keeps sliding to the floor. Loyalty -- After the characters relocate to California, Shirley marries and moves overseas, leaving Laverne to face cancellation alone. Kate and Allie, 1984-89 Era -- On CBS's ""Kate and Allie,"" 1980's women had problems that Lucy and Ethel could barely have imagined. Living Arrangements -- Kate McArdle (Susan Saint James, right) and Allie Lowell (Jane Curtin), both divorced, live with their total of three children in a big New York apartment. At one point, they pretend to be lesbians so the landlady won't throw them out for being a two-family household. Specialties -- Hugs and late-night talks about love, children and life. Balance of Power -- Kate is cooler, more worldly; Allie is old-fashioned and keeps tranquilizers in the spice rack. Togetherness -- Allie stays home to cold-shower Kate out of an accidental sedative overdose. Kate rushes home from work when Allie calls, panicked about her 17-year-old daughter's intentions to have sex. Eventually the two women open a catering business. Loyalty -- Even after Allie remarries, Kate moves in with her. Patsy and Edina, 1992- Era -- The 90's, but the dissolute, self-indulgent heroines of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" (BBC; shown here on Comedy Central since 1994) refuse to leave the 60's. Living Arrangements -- No one understands Edina Monsoon (Jennifer Saunders, left), who lives in a chic London house. Thank God for Patsy Stone (Joanna Lumley), who lives somewhere within taxicab distance and keeps moving in. Specialties -- Drinking (Bollinger is a favorite), drug use (Patsy smuggles marijuana into Morocco in her Ivana Trump hairdo), shopping, belittling Eddy's annoyingly sensbile teen-age daughter, Saffron (Julia Sawalha), and complaining in spoken italics (""Why can't life just be made a little easier?"" Eddy asks a traffic court judge). Balance of Power -- Patsy, a magazine fashion director who often can't find her office, has the more glamorous job and looks. But Eddy, a publicist, holds all the cards, as her daughter and her best friend fight for her love. Togetherness -- Absolute. When Eddy was hospitalized for foot surgery (a lost acupuncture needle), Patsy checked in for moral support -- and a face-lift. Loyalty -- Total. Who but Patsy would call Saffron pretending to be the Betty Ford Clinic confirming Edina's reservation? Hope and Gloria, 1995- Era -- Here and now (NBC's ""Hope and Gloria""). Living Arrangements -- The same apartment building in Pittsburgh. Specialty -- Too soon to tell. Balance of Power -- Mixed. Hope Davidson (Cynthia Stevenson), recently dumped by her unfaithful husband, is a television producer so meek she accepts applying cream cheese to her boss's bagel as part of her job. Gloria Utz (Jessica Luncy) is a twice-divorced hairdresser and mother of one who carries a tote bag the size of a coffee table and talks back to just about anyone. Togetherness -- Growing. They do visit each other's apartments constantly. Loyalty -- Promising, but Hope could have been alittle more supportive when she hired Gloria at the television station, then pretty much took the job offer back.",1995-04-30T05:00:00+0000

In it appear lawyers who claim to have been disabled by picking up their briefcases; a lawyer who billed for 50-hour workdays; a judge who persecutes his auditors with outrageous puns and sesquipedalian locutions; a 63-year-old who was named New York's outstanding young lawyer for 1992; and several lawyers of a decency that would be uncommon in any profession who specialize in doing what Mr. Margolick (himself a lawyer, and now the chief of The Times's San Francisco bureau) calls ""God's work.""

The characters in the author's first short-story collection come from all walks of life and range in age from 5 to 50-plus; frequently they are Irish-American. What most have in common is a tendency to carry love to its extremes, no matter how much it hurts. ""Unflinching but tender, cruel and loving as a candid snapshot of a difficult relative, Ms. Currie's stories take us by surprise,"" Michael Malone said here last year. COLORED PEOPLE: A Memoir By Henry Louis Gates Jr. Vintage, $11. The West Virginia panhandle in the 1950's and 60's is the setting for many of the author's reminiscences. He reflects on the early days of desegregation, which were as bittersweet as they were welcome: they signaled the demise of beloved black rituals and institutions as well as of exclusionary white ones. Last year our reviewer, Louis D. Rubin Jr., praised the ""rich and often comic detail"" to be found among ""the considerable pleasures in this splendidly told memoir."" A slightly earlier era comes to life in WHEN WE WERE COLORED, by Clifton L. Taulbert (Penguin, $8.95), which re-creates the author's boyhood in Glen Allan, Miss., a small town where separate facilities for whites and blacks were all he knew. Originally published as ""Once Upon a Time When We Were Colored,"" the book relates the ways in which the members of Mr. Taulbert's family rose above prejudice by nurturing their love for one another. ""He has evoked such loving memories of Glen Allan and its residents that readers will come away . . . at least a little sorry that they didn't grow up there too,"" Rosemary L. Bray said in the Book Review in 1990. A sequel, THE LAST TRAIN NORTH (Penguin, $8.95), chronicles Mr. Taulbert's move to St. Louis after his high school graduation in 1963 and the life he found there. ""So much gives pleasure here,"" one reviewer commented in 1992. PROFANE FRIENDSHIP By Harold Brodkey. Mercury House, $14. This novel examines the relationship between two boys -- one Italian, one American -- growing up in Venice in the 1930's. It is narrated by the American, now a writer in his 60's, who uses his memories to explore the nature of love. Last year our reviewer, Michael Wood, said, ""I was caught up in Mr. Brodkey's project, compelled by . . . its intelligence and its rhythm."" THE RACE TO FASHODA: Colonialism and African Resistance By David Levering Lewis. Owl/Holt, $13.95. The battle for Africa drew in many European powers. The focus of this history is a fort on the Nile called Fashoda, the site of a memorable showdown between a British commander and a French one in 1898. Writing in these pages in 1988, William Boyd called the book ""elegantly written and thoroughly researched."" The same publisher has also restored to print Mr. Lewis's PRISONERS OF HONOR: The Dreyfus Affair ($12), which details the famous military case that became a study in anti-Semitism. It is ""readable and well-researched popular history,"" Nicholas Wahl said here in 1973. WITHOUT A HERO: Stories By T. Coraghessan Boyle. Penguin, $10.95. In these tales satire illuminates all the crowded corners of contemporary culture. Not surprisingly, there are few heroes among the odd aspirants and adventurers. ""The literary performances here retain Mr. Boyle's astonishing and characteristic verve, his unaverted gaze,"" Lorrie Moore said in the Book Review last year. NOAH'S GARDEN: Restoring the Ecology of Our Own Back Yards By Sara Stein. Houghton Mifflin, $10.95. The author demonstrates what affronts to nature are the standard gardens of suburbia: their manicured lawns and exotic flowers have driven out native flora and fauna to an alarming degree. Her suggestions for remedy are ""persuasive, succinct and entertainingly written,"" our reviewer, Ian L. McHarg, said in 1993. Civilization versus the wild is also at issue in THE CITY AND TOWN GARDENER: A Handbook for Planting Small Spaces and Containers, by Linda Yang (Random House, $18). In this volume, originally published as ""The City Gardener's Handbook,"" Ms. Yang, who writes a gardening column for The Home Section of The New York Times, explains how to create patches of nature in the most unlikely urban places. Ann Lovejoy, writing in the Book Review in 1990, said the author ""knows her audience's needs inside out."" THE BIRTHDAY BOYS By Beryl Bainbridge. Carroll & Graf, $9.95. The men who died on Capt. Robert Scott's expedition to the South Pole in 1912 were long presumed to have given their lives for King and country. This novel indicates that the five may have sacrificed themselves through mismanagement and for less lofty ends. Monologues for each doomed explorer ""contain some of the most convincing and slyly revealing first-person narrative I've ever read,"" Gary Krist said here last year. ""K"" IS FOR KILLER By Sue Grafton. Fawcett Crest, $6.99. Kinsey Millhone takes a walk on the dark side. Investigating the death of a young call girl, this private eye is drawn into an examination of both night life and shadowy impulses. In 1994 our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, called the book ""intriguingly offbeat."" TRY By Dennis Cooper. Grove, $11. Two teen-age boys, Ziggy and Calhoun, muddled by drugs and various sorts of deprivation, try to eke out an existence in a bleak world dominated by pornography and abuse. Their tale is ""a love story, all the more poignant because it is so brutally crushed,"" Catherine Texier said in these pages last year. LAUREL GRAEBER",1995-04-30T05:00:00+0000

us,DIARY,"TAKEOVERS The Day Chrysler Fever Broke Two weeks ago, Chrysler's stock soared -- simply because one man, Kirk Kerkorian, said he wanted to buy the company. Since then, the stock has done a tentative dance, with doubts creeping in about the deal but investors, remembering the power of Mr. Kerkorian's 10 percent stake, not quite ready to bail out. But last week the company lashed out at its uninvited suitor, saying it had no interest in ""gambling with Chrysler's future"" and brushing off Mr. Kerkorian's request for a tripling of the dividend (which would add over $100 million to Mr. Kerkorian's annual income). For investors, that seemed to settle it, as the stock fell $2.50 on Wednesday, close to its pre-hysteria level, before creeping up again by week's end. THE ECONOMY Slowing to a Steady Walk Surprise! Interest rates went up -- thanks to the Federal Reserve -- and people stopped buying so much stuff. At the end of last year, Americans were still spending big, and the economy grew at a fast 5.1 percent pace -- just the type of too-frantic growth the Fed wanted to head off. But in this year's first quarter, reality set in, wallets closed -- well, part way -- and economic growth slowed to a 2.8 percent rate, the laziest in two years. Keeping things going were corporations that made big investments in equipment and buildings. All this was apparently fine with the stock market, as the Dow industrials kept bumping along to new records. MUTUAL FUNDS Follow the Money Trail Mutual funds are where the nation's money is, so their vital signs provide good indicators of what, in an economic sense, is going on. If, that is, you can make sense of those vital signs. Last week came word that cash levels in stock funds were down to 7 percent -- the lowest in well over a decade. What's cash for? Basically, redemptions and safety. But with money flowing in and stocks rising, fund managers seem worried about neither. Fund cash is often what powers the market, though, so is this thin wallet worrisome? Not as long as new cash keeps coming -- which it certainly did recently, going into retirement accounts before the dreaded April 17. THE WORKPLACE Those Vanishing Benefits Most employees already know this, of course: companies are getting stingier with benefits. Workers are paying a bigger share of health coverage or being nudged into H.M.O.'s, and must take greater responsibility for retirement through 401(k)'s and the like. But now it's official. A report last week showed that benefit costs for the first quarter showed the smallest rise in eight years. For the past year, in fact, benefit costs rose no faster than overall compensation -- again, for the first time in eight years. The overall report ""confirms that there's no inflation push from wages,"" said Labor Secretary Reich. It also confirms that the days of the all-giving, kindly-uncle employer are vanishing fast. ANTITRUST One Microsoft, Indivisible Soon, no doubt, there'll be a Government agency called the Microsoft Department, or at least a Microsoft Division at the Justice Department. The giant company seems a perennial Washington topic. Just last week Justice officials were defending Microsoft one minute against being called monopolistic and then going to court to block its acquisition of Intuit, maker of Quicken personal-finance software, saying this dominance could lead to higher prices and fewer choices for consumers. No inconsistency, the agency said -- different legal issues. And there's no truth, by the way, to rumors that Microsoft is planning to acquire the Justice Department. Just the mint. BANKING A Human Teller? Naw! In the old days, we'll tell our grandchildren (by e-mail, of course), you actually saw people at bank windows, talked to human beings on the phone, not multiple-choice recordings. They'll smile an indulgent smile, then log on to their sixth-grade math class. It's true, though. Until late April of '95, you could walk into any bank and hand a teller a deposit. But then First Chicago said you had to pay $3 for that honor (unless you had $2,500 stagnating in a checking account) if you could have used an A.T.M. instead. A teller transaction, you see, costs 6 to 12 times what an A.T.M. transaction does, and they had to watch all those pennies. Even though, in yet older days, the world somehow muddled through with -- brace yourselves -- no A.T.M.'s at all. ORANGE COUNTY Mr. Citron Takes His Lumps ""The dog ate my homework"" may work for a young scholar, but for grown-ups, ""the broker ate my lunch"" goes only so far. When you're managing a $7.4 billion government fund, as Robert Citron was in Orange County, you're ultimately responsible. For a while, Mr. Citron insisted he was just a blushing victim when the county lost $1.7 billion, blaming Merrill Lynch for leading him astray, but last week that excuse crumbled when he pleaded guilty to felonies like misappropriating funds and misleading investors. He could get up to 14 years in prison. In other words, derivatives don't make money vanish; people do. INNER CITY Bodegas vs. Pathmark You can't win. In some people's view, the inner city perpetuates poverty partly because a lack of fair-priced supermarkets forces residents to shop at high-priced bodegas. But when a plan emerged for a Pathmark in East Harlem, opponents cried out that the store would hurt bodega owners. The plan seemed doomed right up to the last minute, but then a City Councilman switched sides and the Manhattan Borough Board approved it, the lure of low prices and added jobs apparently winning the day. TECHNOLOGY High-Tech Coffee Break Sometimes we seem to be rushing headlong into a world with all the high-tech stuff jumbled together -- television shows coming out of phones, phone calls coming out of computers, information coming from just about anywhere. But occasionally the world pauses on this mad dash, as when Bell Atlantic decided last week to rethink its idea of offering video services to three million phone customers. Even though the company was well along in the F.C.C. approval process, it said its executives needed to ""to catch our breath."" So does this point, as some suggested, to mounting confusion in this whole pile-up of technologies? Or does Bell Atlantic just want, as it says, to hold out for better fiber-optic technology? Stay, uh, tuned. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION And the Sons Did Homework Thursday was Take Our Daughters to Work Day, a jubilant little affirmative-action idea cooked up a few years ago by the Ms. Foundation. Nationwide, perhaps six million girls played hooky to get a glimpse of the way the adult world works -- or at least the way it works with six million rosy little souls playing hopscotch in the staid hallways of commerce. But ""affirmative action"" is a dirty word these days -- O.K., two words -- so the glee is now tempered with dissension. Why were boys left out? They get precious little chance to watch Dad -- and Mom -- work. Not to mention that if they saw women doing all sorts of jobs, a lesson might sink in. Then again, why shouldn't girls hog the spotlight for a day? Then again . . . oh, who knows.",1995-04-30T05:00:00+0000

A New Map of the Brain","These are exiting days in brain research. Until recently, activity in the brain had been relatively difficult to map. Now, using sophisticated new technologies like functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET scans), scientists have been able to locate the precise regions of the brain that govern various thoughts, feelings, and sensations. In PET scans, for example, subjects are injected with radioactive glucose and placed in a tunnel-like scanning machine. When they are asked to, say, solve a complex math problem or think about something sad, corresponding areas of their brains begin to glow. ",1995-04-30T05:00:00+0000
