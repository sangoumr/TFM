These were largely (though not exclusively) midcentury dwellings  some neglected, others wildly overgrown  on or in the park that seemed to reify my sense of the citys layered strangeness, of its mystery and opportunity for discovery. Even more than other European cities, Berlin is marked by the remains of all kinds of ideologies past, from the TV Tower in the vast main square, Alexanderplatz, a retro-future icon erected in the late 1960s by the East German government in a now poignant display of might, to the buildings the Nazis left behind. (Hitler never did fully realize his vision of a rebuilt Berlin as the capital of Germania, but the kind of neo-Classical bombast he had in mind is evident in the Olympic Stadium, which he commissioned shortly after he took power in 1933 and was completed in time for the 1936 Summer Games, and the limestone Tempelhof Airport terminal, which was constructed between 1936 and 1941 and, following the war, became a site of the airlift that sustained the city with food and supplies when Stalin blocked access to West Berlin.) All architecture conveys a set of narratives, histories and values for how best to live, and todays Berlin, a jumble of tragedy and utopian ambitions past  and, these days, encroaching foreign investment  can feel like an especially dark choose-your-own-adventure story.",2020-11-10T15:00:15+0000

Part of the kitchen is set aside for takeout and delivery. Its probably going to make up almost half of our business from what I can see, he said. This winter, it will be the norm. The menu lists what Mr. Strausman calls his greatest hits, including Estelles chicken soup, lasagna della nonna, sauted chicken livers, smoked fish platters and coffee cake for brunch.

us,A Vibrant Screen That Resurrects an Artists Vision,"The Turin, Italy-born artist Giacomo Balla was among the great early 20th-century Futurists  radical thinkers who venerated the automobile, the airplane and the kinetic, sometimes violent power of modern life. Influenced by Cubisms fractured light and geometry, as well as the motion of tienne-Jules Mareys pioneering chronophotography, Balla captured the eras dynamism with such paintings as his 1912 Girl Running on a Balcony but also turned his brightly hued abstractions into furniture, lampshades and avant-garde clothing. In 1917, he flipped over a couple of discarded photographs and sketched a folding screen, coloring it with tempera and pencil. The drawing remained unpublished until it appeared in a 1968 Balla monograph, but now Cassina has produced the partition, silk-screened on both sides of an asymmetrically cut wooden armature with satin-brass hinges. The colors pictured here are those that Balla himself specified: a smoldering combination of cinnabar, citron and deep forest.

The riches of this territory are once more conveyed by entanglements of bodies and faces, now joined by horses, cowboy hats and hints of frontier buildings. All motifs benefit from ingenious combinations of strident drawing and suave stained color; they are often simultaneously transparent and opaque, explicit and mysterious.

From the small-time grifters like Anna Sorokin, who adopted the last name Delvey to masquerade in downtown New York circles as a European heiress for four years before she was convicted of second-degree grand larceny in 2019, to the murderous faux WASP Clark Rockefeller, as the serial impostor Christian Gerhartsreiter was known until his clubby life was upended by kidnapping charges in 2008, all impostors come equipped with a tall tale and a look to match. In Sorokins case, it seemed to be largely about the chunky Celine glasses, code for jolie-laide cool; in Gerhartsreiters, it was the Lacoste shirts and East Coast lockjaw copied from the millionaire character on Gilligans Island.

That ginseng improves energy, say, or that ginger alleviates nausea, or that horsetail, which contains silica, might help hair to grow? One theory, possibly apocryphal and certainly much maligned by modern medicine, is that the physical characteristics of plants themselves provided clues as to how they might be used. This notion, known among scholars of ethnobotany and practitioners of herbal medicine as the doctrine of signatures, holds that plants have a signature  color, texture, shape, scent, even the environment in which they grow  that resembles the body parts and diseases they heal. Thus bloodroot, or Sanguinaria canadensis, whose roots and rhizomes secrete a red sap when cut, was once thought to heal blood disorders and hasten wound healing. And eyebright, or euphrasia, whose flowers resemble the human eye (or rather, with its yellow dots and purple stripes, a jaundiced, bloodshot one), has for centuries been used to treat ocular ailments, like conjunctivitis. (In German, eyebright is called Augentrost, or consolation of the eyes.) Signatures, in other words, made it easy to divine a plants medicinal properties.

Nevertheless, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the scion and creative director of the 183-year-old brand, was confident that Hardys talent for creating objects that are both easy to wear and transcendent would prove enough. As might be expected of someone who began his career as a ballet dancer, the designers sinuous pieces dont merely adorn the body, they pour over it. This necklace, a serpentine armature of rose gold with pav diamonds, incorporates an elegant palette that is pure Herms: apple-green prehnite cabochons, a pale blue-gray sapphire and pink, brown and blue tourmalines.

It was a phrase that many Americans were surely longing to hear, given the precarious state of the nations political culture. But it was also one that carried significant historical weight and possible implications for the future. When President Gerald R. Ford pardoned Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal, he, too, spoke about the need for healing. (Ford titled his subsequent memoir A Time to Heal.) When President Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address during the waning days of the Civil War, he spoke in similar terms about the imperative to bind up the nations wounds. Whether Biden intended to do so, his words provided an early signal about one of the first questions he is going to confront as president: What to do about Donald Trump?

But in a year marked by both isolation and turmoil, a delivery of blooms, a gift that also helps support financially hard-hit small businesses, feels especially poignant. And so for the first in our new series of Black Book guides, weve created a directory of the most imaginative and masterful florists working today in six major cities. These 22 designers make arrangements that are often wildly different in style, ranging from understated bouquets to experimental showpieces, and weve tried to offer a range of classic, earthy and unusual options in each place. But if these florists aesthetics are diverse  informed by everything from old master paintings to modern dance  they all bring a singular vision to the centuries-old art they practice. Many are also united in rejecting the methods of the contemporary globalized flower trade, in which blooms are cut sometimes months before theyre sold, sprayed with toxic preservatives and then shipped great distances at great environmental cost. Some are instead championing local growers and avoiding harmful substances like flower foam, while others are even cultivating their own flowers or privileging historically overlooked materials such as seedpods, roots and weeds.

Stacks of boxes filled with books and products shed made, as well as paintings  both her own and ones shed purchased  lined the walls, and the countertops of the kitchenette were barely visible beneath the countless cases of spray paint piled on top of them. When the pandemic hit New Jersey in March, and the state went into lockdown, Abney  who also lives in the building, in an apartment a few flights below  became even more aware of her spatial confines. And so, in May, she bought a bike and a rack for her car and began taking road trips to rural areas outside of the city to find some relief from all the time spent indoors. Inspired in part by these excursions, Abneys new body of work conveys a sense of expansiveness  one that she also found in the form of an additional studio that she rented in the same building this fall. This larger temporary space, with a view of the Manhattan skyline, gave the artist enough room to finish the 22 paintings  ranging from 2 feet by 2 feet to 8 feet by 8 feet  that are currently on display in The Great Escape, a solo exhibition at Jack Shainman Gallery in New York.",2020-11-19T22:59:49+0000

They issued the nations first shelter in place order, promptly shut down schools and businesses and made masks routine. It worked: The city has experienced some of the lowest test positivity rates in the country.Now, city officials are forging ahead with a tentative school reopening plan hatched earlier this month, and it couldnt have come at a worse time. The coronavirus has entered a frightening new stage nationwide  triggering school districts around the country to shutter, including in New York City and the entire state of Kentucky  and putting San Francisco on the horns of a dilemma.The districts goal of opening some schools could bring relief to thousands of parents and students, but their plan was written for another reality. Virus rates are suddenly spiking, prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday to issue a nighttime curfew affecting nearly every county in the state, though San Francisco is below the threshold. As a result, officials here face pushback from some unions, teachers and parents.Whether San Francisco ultimately proceeds can be a bellwether: If schools cannot reopen here where virus rates remain comparatively low, what hope do other cities have for a return to something resembling normalcy?There is mounting evidence that prolonged distance learning could have long-term effects on schoolchildren and their families, including higher dropout rates and lower income in later years.

Brown: An Excerpt","In the Educations double-edged opening pages, Adams recalls a golden nativity: Probably no child, born in the year, held better cards than he. From there, the narrative, interested in the price of privilege, moves on to an involved, ironic discussion surveying the special burdens of belonging to a pedigree of presidents. Henry knew well each hurdle before him. Raised, as he put it, in the long shadows cast by the First Church, the Boston State House, Beacon Hill, John Hancock and John Adams, he internalized past glories, old prejudices, and dying traditions. This demanding ancestor worship, as stifling as a posh sarcophagus, led eventually to a self-imposed Washington exile where, in the nations capital city, he produced a vast nine-volume history of the early American republic, in whose final book he dedicated an epitaphic chapter to the decline of Massachusetts. An efficient autopsy of the Bay States imminent eclipse before the combined might of the slaveholding South and the democratic West, it might be said to have served as spadework for the one puzzling question never far from his thoughts: How did the prized child, the holder of so many better cards, come to lose the hand?",2020-11-24T10:01:00+0000
