As Mr. Brown sees it, an anguished war could also be, for those who waged it, painfully boring.

Shere Hite rewrote portions of her 1981 best seller to produce this shorter version, which includes a new preface. Although her sample population - 7,239 men aged 13 to 97 - is not representative and her findings won't be news to therapists, our reviewer, Roger L. Gould, credited the book with pulverizing any remaining myths about ''normal'' male sexuality. The general reader, he said, might find it ''an eye opener in the tradition of the original reports of Alfred Kinsey.'' (Wardell B. Pomeroy's 1972 biography, DR. KINSEY AND THE INSTITUTE FOR SEX RESEARCH, has now been reissued by Yale University Press at $10.95 in paperback.

I have escaped Goethe's pronouncement, but I fear that as a Jew I am still convinced, deep within me where it may matter most, that I will spend my last days in a camp - defeated, disempowered, unable to protect my family. Though for an American Jew this is anything but a realistic expectation, it remains quite possible for others, and, perhaps for their sake, in 1972 and 1973 I found myself, along with many other Americans, in the Israeli Army. Most of us were there, I believe, in much the same way that the Flying Tigers were in China, that Faulkner joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, and that Americans enlisted in the R.A.F. or fought with the Loyalists in Spain.

One of the small band who joined the revolution of European painting in the early 1900's, he is known to the art world today by only a few things, including a one-shot Dada assemblage of plumbing pipes he did around 1916, titled ''God.'' Yet he was an impressive colorist, one of the first painters to bring Cubism to America and a pioneer of the Precisionist movement that was further developed by such artists as Charles Sheeler, Georgia O'Keeffe and Ralston Crawford. What's more, the meticulous renderings of mechanical parts he did in 1916 were among the earliest in that genre, today even thought to antedate the Dada ''machine'' paintings of Francis Picabia.",1982-11-12T05:00:00+0000

An era in Soviet history has obviously ended with the death of Leonid I. Brezhnev. We now await the unfolding of the succession process, which does not end with the appointment of Yuri V. Andropov as the new General Secretary of the Communist Party. The 1980's may well be decisive in determining the course of the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. The relationship will either move toward an accommodation or much closer to war. The odds are, however, that a superpower settlement of sorts will be reached.","The period of change in the Soviet Union will extend well beyond Ronald Reagan's Administration, even if he serves a second term. But Mr. Reagan occupies a pivotal position. As a conservative Republican, he can explore an accommodation with the Soviet Union without arousing a domestic backlash. He has a good chance of continuing the defense buildup that must form the backbone of any American foreign policy in the 1980's. After Mr. Brezhnev, the United States could easily pursue a policy of pressure on the Soviet Union's new leaders. Such a policy would force Mr. Andropov to dig in, if only out of self-preservation.

Universal's ''Halloween III'' had a brief flurry, and M-G-M/UA's comedy, ''My Favorite Year,'' with Peter O'Toole, which started slowly, seems to be building something of an audience.

us,PARTIAL WALLS: NEW WAYS TO SHAPE SPACE,"LOFT and apartment renovation used to involve a lot more tearing down than building up. Walls, in particular, were often ripped out to create open areas. But nowadays a growing number of architects and designers are balancing a desire for privacy and spaciousness by modulating space with partial walls. The walls they use are either free-standing partitions that do not reach the ceiling or portions of walls that simply suggest enclosure. The result is a layout that architects are calling the modified open plan. ''People today seem tired of living in one large loftlike area,'' said Peter Wilson, a New York architect, who recently used this partial-wall technique in a major renovation job. ''Most of my clients ask for the privacy of enclosed rooms, but at the same time they want a feeling of more spaciousness than the traditional apartment can offer.'' What the partial wall provides that the conventional wall cannot is flexibility at a reasonable cost. In apartments or lofts where windows are on only one side of the space, for example, using a partial-height wall can achieve visual enclosure while allowing light and air circula-tion to filter in from the rest of the loft or apartment. The expense of installing separate heating and airconditioning units is then avoided.",1982-11-18T05:00:00+0000

City Council President Carol Bellamy was particularly irked that the Mayor seemed to be ''throwing overboard'' $20 million of the $48 million in modifications the board and the Council made in June. And even as Mr. Koch warned in a memo to city department heads that layoffs might be needed after all - he issued a similar alarm earlier this month, only to change his mind 24 hours later -Harrison J. Goldin, the City Comptroller, challenged the Mayor's conclusion that the city could not afford 1,000 new police officers. ''I cannot believe this program will emerge unscathed,'' said Edward L. Sadowsky, chairman of the Finance Committee of the Council, which must approve the $22 million in new and increased taxes Mr. Koch is seeking this fiscal year and the $200 million he wants in the year beginning July 1. Another official with a say in the matter is Comer S. Coppie, Executive Director of the Emergency Financial Control Board, which must approve the city's fiscal plan.

For, improbable though it might seem to us now, when renowned though sometimes modestly gifted conductors can become multimillionaires whose names are clues on television game shows, the chances for their surviving - at least in their traditional role as conduit between audience and composer - look dim. The principal reason their disappearance is likely is that conductors have lost the tight one-to-one connection with living composers that traditionally has provided the performing musician with his reason for existence. The conductor's most important job is to find new music an [ TEXT OMITTED ] Granted, it is entirely possible that the symphony orchestra conductor will survive in any of several roles superficially similar to his present one. But, barring some cultural upheaval still unforeseen, he is fated to play a part profoundly different from that of his predecessors in earlier centuries. Spenglerian thinkers have been suggesting for some time that Western music is entering a period of dormancy or decline, like the classical art of certain ancient civilizations. If that is so, the conductor could become our version of the Kabuki artist, the singer-actor-dancer who has for centuries been entrusted with the duty of preserving a Japanese performance tradition that long ago passed into that shimmering state of stability known as entropy.",1982-11-28T05:00:00+0000

In the form as well as the subject matter of his poems he registered dissent. His early poems, we now learn, were in free verse. Later, under the influence of new critical theories, he revolted toward strict forms; at this point William Carlos Williams called him ''a tiger behind bars.'' He uncaged himself in ''Life Studies'' and subsequent volumes. In response to internal as well as external challenges, he adopted various strategies. His aim was to make himself a representative man, whose reactions to war, politics, love, family and friends would add up to archetypal completeness.

But if infrastructure has become a watchword, finding the funds for the increasingly huge public works bills spawned by postponement of perhaps a decade's worth of rebuilding, resurfacing and repairing seems as hard as ever, even if such work can no longer safely be delayed. There was good news, however, from an unexpected quarter last week, as President Reagan endorsed a 5-cent-a-gallon Federal gasoline tax to help the states and the unemployed. In New Jersey, Transportation Commissioner John P. Sheridan Jr. estimated that the five-year, $32.9 billion program under discussion on Capitol Hill could boost the state's share of Federal transportation aid from $183 million to $270 million and provide 7,500 new construction jobs of the 320,000 to be created around the country (assuming New Jersey provides the matching funds to qualify for the new aid). It couldn't have come at a more opportune time: Mr. Sheridan had just announced the indefinite postponement of $100 million in new road construction. Staff cutbacks brought about by the state's budget squeeze, he said, left too few supervisors to oversee the work. Of course, roads are by no means the region's only problem.
