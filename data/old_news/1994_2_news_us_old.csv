In every event, the 15 highest-ranked skiers are seeded and allowed to ski first, which is usually when course conditions are optimal. If conditions are extremely poor, a few luckless, low-ranked skiers are occasionally sent out to ski before the seeded skiers in order to pack down the trail. In a race made up of two runs, the top 15 finishers after the first run reverse order for the second run. THE SETUP: Slalom (a Norwegian word) and giant slalom, both contested over two runs, are known as ""technical"" events because they require skiers to negotiate their way through red- and blue-flagged double poles known as ""gates"" by making dozens of quick, tight turns. A slalom course must have a minimum of 55 gates for men and 45 for women. A giant slalom course is longer, faster and more open, with a minimum distance between gates of about 13 feet as opposed to about two and a half feet in slalom.

us,FREESTYLE SKIING,"A combination of figure skating with gymnastics, freestyle skiing is one of the newer Olympic sports, with moguls gaining medal status in 1992 and aerials becoming a medal sport in Lillehammer. THE SETUP: In moguls, skiers race a qualifying and final run down a steep course about two football fields long, cluttered with moguls, or snow bumps, while incorporating two upright jumps. In aerials, the skiers jump off a chute to perform their two jumps (like in skateboarding), and are judged for takeoff, height and distance (called the air of a jump), execution and landing, among other criteria. THE SCORING: For moguls, think figure skating with a clock, complete with music and scoring on a scale of 0 to 7.5 points. Judges decide how well a skier tackles the moguls (50 percent of his score) and the air of the jump (25 percent) and then his total time (another 25 percent). In aerials, the judges, score on air (20 percent), execution and precision (50 percent) and landing (30 percent. THE STRATEGY: In moguls, it's watch out for the bumps while maintaining jumping style; in aerials, acrobatics rule, with somersaults and twists leading the way. THE NAMES: Recovered from major surgery on her right knee, Donna Weinbrecht of West Milford, N.J., is favored to defend her 1992 gold medal in moguls. Her top challenge should come from Stine Lise Hattestad, the 1993 world champion from Norway. Also back is the 1992 men's champion, Edgar Grospiron of France.",1994-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Nine Atlantic Islands of Balmy Beauty,"ACCORDING to local lore, the Azores -- the nine islands jutting up from the Atlantic floor some 900 miles off the coast of Portugal -- are all that remain of the fabled Atlantis after it sank beneath the waves. Whatever their origin, few would dispute the beauty of this balmy archipelago, where misty peaks loom over whitewashed villages and, in the summer months, hydrangea hedges wind like lavender ribbons across verdant hillsides. Temperatures in the Azores average 55 degrees in winter and 74 in summer, ideal for plants and people. Wild ginger, yellow cannas, miniature roses, pink azaleas and heathergrow riotously along the roadsides. With an uncharacteristic thrift of words, William F. Buckley Jr. wrote in his book ""Atlantic High"" that the Azores ""are, quite simply stated, the most beautiful group of islands in the world."" Yet tourism has remained modest in the Azores: about 122,000 people visited the Azores from January through October 1993, down from 145,000 for the corresponding period the year before. After a five-hour direct flight from Boston, we touched down in late July on the largest of the Azores: Sao Miguel, reminiscent of New Zealand, Hawaii, even Ireland. ",1994-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Born to Be Seen as Well as Heard,"Miles Davis (1926-91) was not just one of the most influential musicians in the history of jazz; he was also one of the most charismatic, and one of the most photogenic. He stares out from the pages of MILES DAVIS: The Man in the Green Shirt (Holt, $40) with an intensity that is almost tangible. Even as a very young man in a very conventional mid-40's publicity shot, he has fire in his eyes; even as a ravaged-looking sexagenarian, his eyes hidden behind huge sunglasses, he holds himself like a man born for the spotlight. As a visual record of a remarkable career, this book is exemplary. Unfortunately, the photographs accompany a text by Richard Williams that is by turns pedestrian and bizarre (and marred by the occasional factual error). Mr. Williams, a veteran English music journalist who now writes about sports for The Independent, does a workmanlike job of rehashing the salient facts of Davis's life. When he attempts to provide a fresh perspective on the great trumpeter's music and mystique, however, the results can be downright silly. The book's title, for example, is a reference to what Davis wore in the striking photograph that graced the cover of his 1958 album ""Milestones."" Mr. Williams lucidly explains why this recording was one of the most significant of Davis's career, but wildly overreaches himself by attempting to make the curious case that the picture and the shirt were as significant as the music. For all his heavy breathing, he fails to demonstrate that Miles Davis's green shirt was anything more or less than a nice-looking shirt. Similarly, ""Miles Davis: The Man in the Green Shirt"" is ultimately no more or less than a nice-looking coffeetable book about a brilliant musician. PETER KEEPNEWS",1994-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Putting the Queen in Queens,"It will be several years before a monument to Catherine of Braganza, for whom the borough of Queens was named, is installed in Hunters Point. But it is already beginning to take shape in a studio on the Upper West Side. WHO?: A Portuguese princess, Catherine became Queen of England in 1662 by marrying Charles II. Through trade with Portugal, she is said to have helped introduce tea to England. And because her dowry included Bombay, England gained entry to India. WHY QUEENS?: During the reign of Charles and Catherine, New York City passed from the Dutch to the English, back to the Dutch, then finally to England again. Kings County (Brooklyn) was named for Charles, and Queens County for Catherine. SIZE: The statue will be about 36 feet tall on a 50-foot-high base. HOW FAR ALONG IS IT?: The project started with a 26-inch clay statuette with succeeding models that size in plaster, wax and then bronze. Enlarged by the sculptor in stages for adjustments in its proportions, the statue is now in its second size, four feet tall. The next incarnation will be at 10 feet tall, followed by full height. SYMBOLISM: Catherine stands atop a large globe and holds a smaller one in her left hand, which convey her role in bridging the old and new worlds and also represent the diversity of Queens today. THE BOTTOM LINE: $1 million; cost of base unknown. WHO'S PAYING?: The Government of Portugal donated $270,000, and $730,000 more is to be raised there. American donors will be asked to pay for the base. FACING: Undecided. The artist wants a rotating base to give Catherine a one-quarter turn with each season. SPONSOR: Friends of Queen Catherine, a nonprofit organization promoting her contributions and Portuguese-American ties.

Five other judges give scores of up to 20 points for the jumpers' style (the highest and lowest scores are dropped). Form on the in-run, or the ramp, is not judged. The scoring system awards about 50 percent for style and 50 percent for distance. The jumper with the highest point total from the two jumps wins.

us,Endpaper; Thinking About You,"Monday. I'm worried about Heidi. A friend of mine visiting from L.A. says Heidi is interviewed on the news there all the time and looks tired and run-down. She's so thin. I'm sure Dr. Fleiss has given her excellent nutritional tips. But since when has a child paid attention to a parent's advice? Heidi, Heidi, listen to your father. Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal warns that many Americans overuse over-the-counter drugs. I've only read about Heidi using prescription medication like Percodan and Quaaludes. Still, I'm concerned. The Journal also mentions that 36 percent of 18-to-34-year-olds plan to purchase a recreational vehicle. I hope that Heidi is one of them. She needs a break. What if Heidi's trial is on Court TV? That's quite an ordeal. Just watching Leslie Abramson from 3,000 miles away during the Menendez trial was exhausting. Heidi should take some time off in a Winnebago now. Instead, she's promoting a new line of sleepwear. Admirable, yes. Idle hands are the devil's playground. But she's obviously working too hard. I myself have just joined a gym and think Heidi should too. And if I could get her to join Equinox, I'd get a free month. Wednesday A.M. Heidi refers to her arrest for drugs and pandering as The Troubles. She is obviously a serious person. I hope she received her invitation to the Tikkun Conference of Liberal and Progressive Jews. Tikkun is ""disappointed with the degree to which the Clinton Administration has been able to follow through on its commitment to a politics of meaning."" Heidi probably is too. I hope Heidi can attend the Tikkun conference. There's a workshop called ""Twenty-somethings: Finding Our Voice."" P.M. Equinox has the best shampoo. Sometimes I go just to wash my hair. I read in Vanity Fair that Heidi's $1.6 million house has the feel of a sorority. So does Equinox! All those naked women gossiping in the locker room. Today, eavesdropping, I learned that if you're allergic to it, you can return all your makeup to a department store. Thursday. There was an article in the paper about rotary phones. I have a rotary phone in my bedroom and am often vilified as a Luddite for it. But now many neighborhoods are requesting that their push-button phones be replaced by old-fashioned rotary phones in order to prevent drug dealers from beeping their couriers from corner Touch-Tone phones. I have never had a drug dealer beep a courier from my bedroom phone, and now I know why. If Heidi does join my gym and I get a chance to chat with her in the locker room in a sorority-like fashion, I will strongly recommend she change her telephones to rotary instruments. The Vanity Fair article mentioned some exchange of small packets -- I hope they were not over-the-counter remedies -- that could easily have been prevented by this simple change. Friday A.M. I really miss Leslie Abramson. To take my mind off her, I drive with a friend to Montauk in an ice storm for the annual winter weekend beach walk of the American Littoral Society. Trying to be brave myself, I think of Heidi, how brave she's been. And loyal. ""I can't get mad at them,"" she says of the young women who have been arrested and agreed to testify against her. ""I won't turn on them. Not those girls. . . . I just know them. . . . I know them."" P.M. We arrive early and after dinner hear a lecture by Mickey Cohen, for whom I would travel six hours in a snowstorm any day. Mickey is a naturalist and a brilliant teacher. He told us all about Yankee Whaling. I do not have a strong predisposition for lectures on Yankee Whaling, but Mickey can talk about fungus (and often does) and make its life cycle sound like a wonderful 19th-century novel. If only Heidi had come. The Vanity Fair article about her says a lot of her friends have deserted her. So she needs some ways to fill her evenings. Will she have to go to jail? Maybe it will be a growth experience and she'll study law there, or Yankee Whaling, or help incarcerated mothers, the way Jean Harris did, while Charlie Sheen and Robert Evans just keep going to shallow Hollywood parties and exposing themselves to secondhand cigarette smoke. Who says prostitution laws are unjust? Saturday. Walked on the beach. Mickey pointed out garnets and red seaweed, which is used to make agar, a sponge, star coral and a long spiny thing with a row of little packets that he said was a case for whelk eggs. Each little packet contains lots of tiny whelks. One of them sticks its stomach out of its shell and eats up its siblings. All the empty little shells are left behind. Maybe Vanity Fair should do a piece on whelks. Maybe Heidi should call Elizabeth Taylor. Liz is also loyal. Maybe she'd join the gym. Sunday. So cold the tide pools were frozen. Rocks covered with an icy glaze. Saw one harbor seal, a gannet, some mergansers. Decided not to worry about Heidi anymore. She wouldn't like it. No culture of victimization for her! It was Heidi herself who said, ""Every man was taken advantage of"" about those who paid $3,000 for sex, and I think she may have a point. Drove home into the sun, tired but eager for the Tikkun Conference next weekend. ""Recent attempts to construe women as sexually passive and in need of much public protection,"" the flier says, ""and detailed guidelines for men about acceptable sexual behavior has stimulated an important debate about the relationship between private life and public concerns."" Heidi, you have already contributed so many important insights to this debate. See you there!",1994-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,"Who Wins, Who Loses","President Clinton's 1995 budget makes changes largely at Government's edge. Its cuts and additions -- a billion here, a few hundred million there -- are dwarfed by the total spending proposal of $1.5 trillion. But the tinkering does follow themes, and some areas will fare better, or worse, than others. Here are some examples. Dollar figures show what the Administration seeks from Congress for each program, not what may be spent in the 1995 fiscal year. WINNERS Technology Just about any program whose title boasts the words ""computer"" or ""research"" gains money. Some big winners: the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, once known only for winding the national clock but now a grantor for private research; information ""superhighway"" research. Still, the total Federal research and development budget, up 4 per cent to $72 billion for 1995, only slightly beats inflation. Program 1994 spending 1995 spending Increase or in millions in mill-prop. decrease-per. National Institute of Standards and Technology $520 $935 80% Information highway grants 26 100 285% Human genome project 128.7 152 18.1% Education and Training George Bush substantially boosted Head Start funding, but Mr. Clinton goes him several better: he would raise Head Start spending again; sharply increase Federal aid to schools in poor neighborhoods, and pour new money into retraining laid-off workers, among other initiatives. Chapter I programs for low-income schools $6,912 $7,579 10% Safe and Drug-free schools 472 660 40% ""Dislocated"" workers 1,118 1,465 31% Health Mr. Clinton's health plan aside, the budget envisions large spending increases for a select series of preventive care and drug-rehabilitation programs. Spending in the 1995 fiscal year for the National Institutes of Health's many units -- the National Cancer Institute, National Institute for Mental Health, and so on -- would rise a little over 7 per cent, to $11 billion. Childhood immunization $528 $588 68% Ryan White Act: AIDS 579 672 16% Childhood immunizations 755 1,040 68% Crime-Fighting Law enforcement is basically a state and local responsibility; only 10 percent of the money spent here comes from Washington. But with crime atop the list of public concerns in polls, the new budget mirrors political reality, and seeks big increases for more police and for prosecuting and jailing wrongdoers. A caveat: much funding relies on passage of the crime bill now before Congress. New police officers (none) 1,720 N.A Federal prisons 2,200 2,600 18% Criminal records upgrade (none) 100 N.A. Public Works One area where the Clinton Administration differs from its Republican predecessors is in its support for construction projects. Democrats believe economic growth flows directly from investments in highways and mass transportation. But even here, the Administration is selective: for example, grants for operating expenses of mass transit systems (13 percent of which is spent in metropolitan New York) would be cut to $600 million from $800 million. Highway construction 19,978 20,301 2% Transit capital grants 659 1,115 69% High-speed rail (none) 28 N.A. LOSERS Foreign Affairs The State Department would take it on the nose, losing a bigger share of its budget than any other Cabinet agency. Total foreign affairs funding, which includes items like Pentagon military aid and export loans, stays stable but loses ground to inflation. Aid to Israel ($3 billion) and Egypt ($1.8 billion) would not change. A growth area: aid to the United Nations for troops in foreign war zones, up 33 per cent. Program 1994 spending 1995 spending Increase or in millions in mill-prop. decrease-per. State Department 5,300 4,900 7.5% Refugees/migration assistance 720 683 5.1% Weapons The Administration wants to stretch out contracts for some ships, tanks and planes and to cancel others outright. Energy Department stockpiles of nuclear materials would be drawn down. One weapon prospers: the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice, beloved by the National Rifle Association and despised by liberals, rises $61,000 to $2.54 million. It sells ammunition and trains youngsters to shoot. B-2 Bomber 1,543 800 48% F-18 Fighter 1,520 1,032 32% Bradley Armored Vehicle 71 14 80% Agriculture Long a treasure chest of subsidies to farm interests, the Agriculture Department is ripe for cuts in tight fiscal times, and its budget would drop next year by 5.5 per cent -- before inflation. In trouble: foreign food aid, oilseed subsidies, the Rural Electrification Administration, the Commodity Credit Corporation (which makes loans for farm exports) and a raft of others. Foreign food assistance 1,412 1,245 11.8% Wool subsidies 193 133.7 30.7% Electric, telephone loan subsidies 70 19 73% Public Housing Funding for HUD rises a bit in the budget, by $1 billion to $26.1 billion. But traditional public-housing monies dry up: new construction funding plummets, as does money for renovating old units. Officials say enough money is in the pipeline to keep such programs going; some of the savings would be spent on a Republican idea, housing vouchers, for the poor and homeless.

Clearly, phone companies and the like have to battle constantly over what is really a finite market: people have time for only so much communicating; they've got other things to do, like shovel snow. And to compete, of course, companies have to fit the 90's style: lean, lean, lean. In the latest dieting blitz, A.T.& T. said last week that it would cut up to 15,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its long-distance work force. Yes, the competition's brutal, but are such drastic steps necessary? One analyst, noting that over half the cuts would be white-collar jobs, said, ""This is an effort to de-bureaucratize.""

us,"IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
Pictures of a Gone World","In a peculiar melding of art history and murder mystery, DISCOVERING ELLIS RULEY (Crown, $30) breathlessly explores Ruley's work, life and mysterious death. A self-taught black painter working in Norwich, Conn., Ruley died violently in 1959, at the age of 77, under suspicious circumstances. Or, as Glenn Robert Smith argues (with the help of Robert Kenner), convincingly if luridly, he was murdered in a racially motivated attack. Married to a white woman and the imperious patriarch of a racially mixed extended family, Ruley took up painting in his later years. His surviving production, presented here in rich color illustrations, comprises small, highly simplified works on board, including pastoral and hunting scenes, landscapes and motifs reworked from photographs in popular magazines. An essay by Stacy Hollander, a curator, and Lee Kogan, a senior research fellow, at the Museum of American Folk Art, traces Ruley's likely sources, primarily stock images of popular heroes and bathing beauties that the artist appropriated to construct a kind of private idyll, a fantasy imagery of male desire with some affinity, as the authors note, to the work of Rousseau. The monographic approach by Mr. Smith, a California collector of folk art, and Mr. Kenner, the former editor of Art & Antiques -- a melodramatic account of Ruley's life and a search for sources and influences -- seems intended primarily to establish a market for Ruley's paintings. The book does not address a range of issues currently being raised in relation to the work of self-taught artists, like the ways race, class and difference shape their work. The book does, however, present interesting new material to be explored in those discussions.MIGNON NIXON",1994-02-13T05:00:00+0000

WHY: The traditional flat lid -- the one that allows coffee to slosh over the top and onto the drinker's clothing -- may be acceptable for the 50-cent, no-name brew from the corner deli. But not for $2.75 cappuccino or espresso doppio. With their stylish brews, coffees bars have introduced the lids to Manhattan. DOUBLES AS A HAT: The visual effect is startling. The lid looks like a white derby sitting atop the cup. Although there are several variations on the dome lid, all of them let the coffee drinker sip through a small hole in the curved mouthpiece. The lid goes by a variety of names, depending on the manufacturer: Traveler Lid, Sipping Lid, Gourmet Lid. SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE: Manufacturers claim that by raising the roof on the coffee cup, they have advanced the technology of take-out coffee in two ways. First, they talk about ""a splash barrier"" or a ""spill-free drinking environment."" They say that with an inch of air above the cup, ""coffee doesn't slosh out, doesn't bounce out."" Second, they say the dome provides space for whipped cream or steamed milk. In other words, they say they have eliminated ""the squish factor."" WHO MAKES IT: With the growing popularity of both coffee bars and America's takeout life style, competition in the lid business is steaming. Solo Cup Company of Highland Park, Ill., says that it created the genre of the dome lid five years ago and holds a patent on it. Sweetheart Cup Company of Chicago came out with a dome lid a few months ago.",1994-02-13T05:00:00+0000

Shareholders of Blockbuster, which Viacom agreed to buy to help cover that debt, aren't too happy with Viacom's stock slide.

us,Black Perspectives,"In 1965, when the Museum of Modern Art asked Romare Bearden to speak on the history of black artists in the United States, the painter was disturbed to discover how little relevant material was available. With his friend the journalist Harry Henderson, Bearden began working on A HISTORY OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN ARTISTS: From 1792 to the Present (Pantheon, $65). The book, completed by Mr. Henderson after Bearden's death in 1988, is the first in-depth reference work on the history and development of art by black Americans. Beginning in 1792 with the portraitist Joshua Johnston and ending with the contemporary landscape painter Richard Mayhew, the authors concentrate on significant painters and sculptors in specific historical periods; they provide a wealth of detail on the lives and achievements of more than 50 artists. Excellent reproductions, both in color and in black and white, of famous, lesser-known and rediscovered works illustrate the diversity of interests and styles in black American art. A few of the artists included here, like Henry Ossawa Tanner, Robert S. Duncanson, William H. Johnson and Jacob Lawrence, have been the subjects of recent scholarly attention; Romare Bearden and Harry Henderson give powerful evidence that many other black artists are equally deserving of attention.

Clinton was at his gloomiest during a conference call with his closest aides at the White House when the Vice President spoke up with words to raise the Presidential spirits.

Today, many of the streets and buildings look the same, but the faces have changed with new comers including immigrants from Sicily, Russia, China and Pakistan. ""We have a huge influx of new residents to this community,"" said Assemblyman Frank J. Barbaro, a Brooklyn Democrat. ""It's important that they know some of the history of Bensonhurst, so that they can link themselves up with it."" So Mr. Barbaro founded the Bensonhurst Historical Society last month, along with the Bensonhurst West End Community Council. The organization, will be based at the Bensonhurst School, or Public School 128, at 84th Street and 20th Avenue, in the heart of Bensonhurst. ""We've been kicking this idea around for years,"" said Carmine Santa Maria, executive director of the Community Council and a member of School Board 21. ""I'm pleased that we were finally able to do something about it because our history is rich. This community has produced many great athletes, entertainers, doctors and business owners."" Sandy Koufax, the baseball pitcher, Larry King, the talk-show host, and Robert Merrill, the singer, are three prominent examples of residents who went on to fame. LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 1643: Anthony Jansen van Salee, the first European settler, arrives from Holland in what is now known as Bensonhurst. 1652: Cornelius van Wekhoven, a functionary for the Dutch West India Company from Utrecht, Holland, acquired the land from a tribe of Indians. For the property, he traded six shirts, two pairs of shoes, six pairs of socks, six hatchets, six knives, two scissors and six combs. 1657: The property was divided into 21 50-acre plots and granted to 19 settlers. Two of the plots were reserved for the poor. The settlers named it New Utrecht. 1783: Rebellious Americans erected a liberty pole with a flag at what is now 83d Street and 18th Avenue. The Fifth replica of the pole still stands in that spot, a patch of green in front of the New Utrecht Dutch Reformed Church. 1828: The New Utrecht Dutch Reformed Church was built at 83d Street and 18th Avenue. 1887: A one-mile-square area of New Utrecht made up of nine farms, four of which were owned by members of the Benson family, was named Bensonhurst. 1915: Jewish and Italian families from the lower East Side of Manhattan began building two-family homes and semi-attached brick and stucco houses. 1939: Lafayette High School was built at 2630 Benson Avenue. It was later attended by Sandy Koufax, who became a pitcher for the Brooklyn and L.A. Dodgers, and Fred Wilpon, president of the New York Mets. 1964: 1964--The Varrazano-Narrows Bridge opened, establishing a pathway to a more rural area for many Brooklynites. 1975: ""Welcome Back Kotter,"" first aired on ABC. Gabe Kaplan played a remedial student who returned to teach at his alma mater, New Utrecht High School in Bensonhurst. 1979: When the Soviet Union began easing Jewish emigration, many of the newcomers settled in this community. 1989: Yusuf Hawkins, a 16-year-old black youth from East New York, was shot twice in the chest as he was surrounded by a gang of 30 white youths. 1994: Assemblyman Frank J.

First published in Polish in 1990, the book was edited by Teresa Swiebocka, a senior curator at the museum, with the English edition prepared by Jonathan Webber, who teaches social anthropology at Oxford University, and Connie Wilsack, the managing editor of the Littman Library of Jewish Civilization in Oxford. Auschwitz, the largest Nazi concentration camp, was established in occupied Poland in 1940. More than a million Jews perished there, along with 120,000 Poles, Gypsies, Soviet prisoners of war, Yugoslavs and homosexuals. They died from starvation, disease, torture, hard labor and executions by shooting, hanging or gassing. When the camp was liberated by the Soviet Army in January 1945, there were 7,000 survivors. The horrifying photographs in this book depict gas chambers, barracks and crematoriums, as well as prisoners, dead bodies, arms tattooed with prison numbers and piles of teeth, glasses, human hair and artificial limbs. Most stunning is the juxtaposition of photographs with the reproductions of drawings and paintings by former prisoners, some actually done in the camp. The drawings and paintings are as intensely detailed as the photographs. ""The works represented here spell out an accusation,"" writes Kazimierz Smolen, a survivor of Auschwitz and former director of its museum. ""Each brushstroke and pencil mark is a condemnation of the Nazi system."" Elsewhere, he writes: ""We remember as part of our homage to the victims. If we fail to remember, then their suffering and death will have no meaning: history will be incomplete."" SUSAN SHAPIRO",1994-02-27T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Rifles',"While ""The Rifles"" is the third book to be published, it is Volume 6 of William T. Vollmann's startlingly ambitious project, ""Seven Dreams: A Book of North American Landscapes,"" seven long novels in which he proposes to narrate the entire ""symbolic history"" of the settlement of North America. Volume 1, ""The Ice-Shirt"" (1990), recounts the arrival of the Norse in Greenland in A.D. 981, and their clashes and accommodations with the native Inuit during the next 300 years. Volume 2, the 990-page ""Fathers and Crows"" (1992), chronicles in prodigious detail the savagery that attended the 16th-century confrontations between the French and the Iroquois in what is now southern Canada. In both of these volumes Mr. Vollmann made wide-ranging imaginative use of legend, native and Christian mythology and historical sources intercut with his observations as a traveler in these regions, as well as his own illustrations and maps. In ""The Rifles"" he has enriched this strange brew by insinuating himself and his novelistic preoccupations even more flagrantly into the narrative.",1994-02-27T05:00:00+0000

Graf, of Germany, needed only 25 minutes to blitz South Africa's Coetzer in the first set. She ended the match in 57 minutes. Graf lost only 3 points in the three games she served in the first set, and she won the last 14 points of the set. ""I had to concentrate on every point,"" Graf said. ""She's the kind of player who makes you play the points."" (AP) Agassi Defeats Mattar: Andre Agassi, playing in his first tournament in nearly five months, defeated Luiz Mattar of Brazil, 6-3, 6-4, yesterday to win the Nuveen Championships in Scottsdale, Ariz. Agassi, seeded fifth, had been sidelined since Sept. 24 with a wrist injury that required surgery Dec. 20. (AP) GOLF Stadler Wins at Home Craig Stadler trudged up the 18th green to roaring cheers yesterday, waving a club to acknowledge his first PGA victory before a hometown crowd in San Diego. Stadler, one of the tour's more popular players, shot a closing 6-under-par 66 to beat Steve Lowery by one stroke in the Buick Invitational. Stadler, 40, whose 10 previous tour victories did not include the San Diego tournament, finished 20 under par at Torrey Pines, where he had played daily as a high school golfer. He came to the final green with a two-shot lead over Lowery. Lowery birdied the hole, and Stadler missed a two-and-a-half-foot birdie try, but he only had to tap in for the victory. With cards of 67-67-68-66, Stadler earned $198,000 for his first victory since the World Series of Golf in 1992. Lowery got what is by far his biggest paycheck, $118,800.
