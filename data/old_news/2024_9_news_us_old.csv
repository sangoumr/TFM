us,"Courrèges’s Designer Is Inspired by Parks, Empty Nightclubs and, Well, Trash","When I started [working as the artistic director] at Courrèges in 2020, we occupied just one floor of a seven-story building [in Paris’s Eighth Arrondissement; André Courrèges founded the company in 1961 and opened his first store there six years later]. Little by little, we’ve begun renting the others. This picture (above) was taken a year into the job, on the day I moved into my new office. When I arrived, I found a piece of paper with a note for me from André’s wife [Coqueline Barrière]. It said, “Never repeat the past. Create your own future.” The spring 2023 show was about the passage of time. The fabric on this dress (below, right) is molded from silicone to look like coral, which can last thousands of years under the sea. When it comes to embellishment, it really needs to add a layer to the story of the collection. I’ll never make a special fabric just for the sake of it. I recently did [a one-off] couture [collection] for Jean Paul Gaultier, and people were telling me, “Dream, dream.” But in my dreams, I don’t see crazy fabrics. For my [fall 2022 Courrèges] show, we covered the floor with thousands of crushed cans (below, center left). They were so shiny they looked like diamonds, but it was just rubbish. I try to find beauty where it’s not.",2024-09-02T09:02:00+0000
us,The Chrysanthemum Is No Longer Just for Grocery Store Bouquets,"Though many Americans associate chrysanthemums with the flower baskets that decorate New England doorsteps each fall, the plant actually has its roots in ancient China. Buddhist monks likely introduced the flower to Japan around the eighth century, where it later captivated Emperor Go-Toba (1180-1239), inspiring him to incorporate its likeness into his crest, a precursor to the one that’s still used by the imperial family today. Since then, the chrysanthemum has been a national symbol of Japan, even embossed in gold on the country’s passports. But it’s beloved across East Asia, celebrated with festivals and memorialized in art, textiles and ceramics.",2024-09-02T09:02:00+0000

But while starting at a new school may cause anxiety, it can also, as these 10 stories illustrate, create opportunities for growth, resilience and an increased capacity for compassion.

And lately, chefs have been finding new uses for the fungus, which has a fruity aroma and an ability to make “anything it touches better,” says Jeremy Umansky, 41, the owner of Larder deli in Cleveland. He uses koji for almost everything: to cure pastrami; to ferment Chinese-style black beans, which are ground and swirled into chocolate babka to embolden the chocolate; and to sprinkle over salads and fries in the form of what the restaurant calls Special K, a seasoning of dried ground koji. “It’s a harmonizer,” he says. Bartenders, too, are taking note. At Nancy’s Hustle in Houston, the bar manager, Zach Hornberger, 32, adds it to the nonalcoholic Silver Brining cocktail, a sweet-sour-salty mix of pickle brine, grapefruit and lime juices, koji and tonic. “It brings this umami background to beverages, and it plays well with citrus, taming the high acid notes and rounding the drink as a whole,” he says. At the restaurant Fête in Honolulu, the bar manager, Fabrice McCarthy, 41, infuses rum with shio koji (a slurry of koji, water and salt) and shakes it into a mai tai to add salinity — the effect, he says, is similar to how salted peanuts make you want to drink more beer. Ryan Chetiyawardana, 40, the owner of the bar Lyaness in London, experiments with koji in multiple forms — for one cocktail, he ferments parsnips with koji, which he says unlocks the sweetness and delivers “a huge tropical brightness.” While koji often plays a supporting role, at Paradiso in Barcelona, it wraps around the entire lip of the glass used for the Fleming, named for Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, another influential mold. For this fungus-inspired cocktail, which includes grapefruit, tequila and miso, the manager of Paradiso’s research lab, Matteo Ciarpaglini, 30, one-upped a classic salt rim with a fluffy cloud of koji, its floral fragrance accompanying every taste. — Martha Cheng",2024-09-03T09:01:42+0000

Hendricks, then 45, was associated with the Fluxus movement, a loose affiliation of 1960s conceptual artists, including Joseph Beuys, John Cage and Yoko Ono, who rejected traditional practices like abstract painting in favor of elaborate performances. Five years earlier, he’d co-starred in a notable one: In the summer of 1971, Hendricks and his wife of 10 years, the artist Nye Ffarrabas (then Bici Forbes), who were both gay, staged a piece called “Flux Divorce,” which involved taking a chain saw to their marriage bed and dividing the entryway to their home with barbed wire. (Their young children, Tyche and Bracken, weren’t around for the actual show; they only observed the cleanup afterward.) Buczak, a painter who was 23 years Hendricks’s junior, had recently relocated from Detroit, where he was raised. As luck would have it, Hendricks had been staying in a dilapidated townhouse in Hudson Square, then a manufacturing neighborhood on the west side of Lower Manhattan, which he’d eventually buy from his younger brother Jon, a Fluxus artist and archivist who lived next door.

Often lustrous and intricately patterned, shells have served as passports, currency, navigation aids, jewelry and decoration. In Renaissance Italy, for instance, they were used to adorn artificial grottos built on the grounds of prominent villas, including those of the Medicis. These heavily adorned faux caves — often outfitted with hidden water spouts, stalactites, glass gems and sculptures of mermaids and other mythical sea dwellers — provided refuge from summer heat and counterpoints to the formal gardens that surrounded them. Later, in Victorian Britain, shell mania boomed among the general public as the empire expanded into tropical regions. Women integrated their collections into handicrafts, affixing them to picture frames and boxes and creating shell bouquets. In the time since, shells have remained on the fringes of contemporary art and décor, largely deemed kitsch and relegated to coastal souvenir shops. But now — amid renewed appreciation for organic media in art-making and a climate crisis that renders ocean life ever more precious — artists are once again embracing the shell as both a raw material and muse.",2024-09-04T20:18:54+0000

To do the same for men’s wear, we first had to assemble a group of esteemed jurors: the Colombian-born French fashion designer Haider Ackermann; Emily Adams Bode Aujla, the American founder of Bode, a brand known for its vintage-inspired men’s wear; T’s men’s style director, David Farber; the New York-based stylist, creative consultant and T contributor Carlos Nazario; and the New York-based Canadian photographer and creative director Tommy Ton. This past April, on a video call that lasted almost three hours, the group debated the merits of 50 collections, with each panelist making the case for the 10 or so that they’d been asked to nominate beforehand. Although there were favorites (four jurors picked at least one Giorgio Armani and Comme des Garçons collection), there were also some upsets (the inclusion of Helmut Lang over his minimalist peers Calvin Klein and Jil Sander) and a few difficult conversations. Could the group, for example, justify putting Abercrombie & Fitch, a mall retailer with a checkered past, on the same list as Junya Watanabe and Dries Van Noten?",2024-09-05T09:03:33+0000

Most Latinos still identify as Democrats, and in 2020 most of them voted for Joe Biden. But Trump still made some serious — and startling — inroads, especially along the border. Take Zapata County, Texas, where 94 percent of the population is Hispanic: Trump flipped it red.",2024-09-18T09:02:31+0000

us,The Life-Affirming Properties of Sichuan Pepper,"IT BEGINS WITH a hum. More precisely, you find yourself humming, only not of your own volition or making any sound. At first it’s faint, little micro-oscillations along the edges of the tongue, as if your mouth were a rung bell. Then, depending on the purity of what you’ve eaten and how much, it builds. People often describe the experience as numbing, but numbness is the loss of sensation, and this is the opposite: You are suddenly aware of your tongue’s every pore, of this strange landscape that is the tongue, an entire world within you. If you have eaten enough, you feel your lips balloon, except they don’t; nothing is happening that would be visible to the outside eye. If you speak, you’ll lisp. It’s as if you were being kissed by a horde of tiny bees. ",2024-09-18T09:02:51+0000

Every summer, his parents and two older sisters would drive up from Bethesda, Md., for “two months of never wearing shoes,” he recalls over a late breakfast on the house’s weathered gray deck. “ ‘Sunblock’ wasn’t a word I understood, and I remember the feeling at the end of summer: Putting on proper clothes felt so harsh.”",2024-09-18T09:03:21+0000

When Rachel stares into the distance, as she tends to do, lost in thought or maybe just lost — her huge eyes shining, her face edged by flaming red hair — she brings to mind a hummingbird hovering in midair, its wings beating impossibly fast against the strongest headwind.",2024-09-19T09:02:12+0000
us,‘The Substance’ Review: An Indecent Disclosure,"In Vladimir Nabokov’s 1930 novel “The Eye,” a sad-sack Russian tutor living in Berlin dies by suicide, and then spends the rest of the book skulking around the living — watching, obsessing over their lives. He eventually realizes something bleak: Most of us see ourselves only through the eyes of others, through the stories we think they make up about us from the glimpses they get of our lives. “I do not exist,” the narrator writes near the end of the book. “There exist but the thousands of mirrors that reflect me.”",2024-09-19T09:02:17+0000

us,‘Wolfs’ Review: Brad Pitt and George Clooney as Themselves,"“Wolfs” — a new something or other starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt — would like you to think it’s a thriller with a helping of comedy, though maybe a comedy with guns and guts. Whatever the case, it isn’t remotely tense or mysterious, and its modest thrills derive wholly from the spectacle of two beautifully aged, primped, pampered and expensive film stars going through the motions with winks and a degree of brittle charm. The movie is a trifle, and it knows it. Mostly, though, “Wolfs,” written and directed by Jon Watts, is an excuse for its two leads to riff on their own personas, which can be faintly amusing and certainly watchable but also insufferably smug. It’s insufferable a lot.",2024-09-19T09:02:28+0000

My $1,988 Spring Break Rental Was Canceled at the Last Minute.","I found a great deal for a short-term rental on St. Thomas this past March: eight nights for me and my two kids at a villa at Marriott’s Frenchman’s Cove for $1,988 through Vrbo, booked two months in advance. I wrote to the owner five days before the trip and didn’t hear back, so I tried again. No answer. The day before departure, I contacted Vrbo, who got in touch with the owner, who canceled. Vrbo said it would be in touch about rebooking, but as we boarded the first flight of our trip from Denver, we still had no place to stay. To buy time, I agreed to be bumped from our next flight in the connecting city. Vrbo told me I could take a refund (and find same-day lodging in the Caribbean during spring break, no thanks) or reserve a hotel through their partner Expedia while they helped me book a new Vrbo property. They said I could spend up to $3,976 for the new booking — double what I had originally paid — but when I said that might not be enough, the agent told me she would advocate for covering additional costs. After a lot of stress, we ended up staying at a Westin resort for two nights via Expedia, at a Vrbo rental at the Ritz-Carlton resort for four nights and the final night at a Vrbo in town. The lodging cost was $4,147 on top of my original reservation, an amount that doesn’t include $200 in “environmental” fees at the Ritz, all the taxi fares and the loss of a vacation day. After lots of back and forth, Vrbo offered me $3,330. I think they should cover at least the full amount. Can you help? Lane, Arvada, Colo.",2024-09-19T09:03:04+0000

us,Can a Scotch Egg Be Fancy?,"While there are countless ways to cook eggs, chefs currently seem fixated on the most hedonistic option: hard boiling and then coating them in a layer of ground meat before breading and frying them. Known as Scotch eggs, the treats are said to have been pioneered by the London epicurean shop Fortnum & Mason in 1738, after which they quickly became a fixture of British pub cuisine. The chef Ed Szymanski, 31, of Lord’s in New York recalls the Scotch eggs he encountered growing up in London as both ubiquitous and “quite bad.” His version features Madras-style spiced lamb in place of the usual pork sausage. “It’s like a supercharged croquette with an egg in the middle,” he says. In Seattle, the chef Sean Arakaki, 30, is also seeking to elevate the flavors of his childhood. Born and raised in Hawaii, he grew up eating loco moco: a hamburger patty served over gravy-drenched white rice with a sunny-side-up egg. At Itsumono, his restaurant in Seattle’s Japantown, his loco moco Scotch egg arrives atop rice and gravy with a side of macaroni salad. “You cut through the crumb to get to a runny yolk,” he says. For his Portland, Ore., food cart Tokyo Sando, the owner Taiki Nakajima, 36, makes a rendition with ajitama — soy-marinated boiled eggs — enveloped in a gyoza-inspired mix of ground pork and chicken with ginger and soy. Encrusted with panko and deep-fried, the eggs are sandwiched between slices of Japanese bread with mayo, roasted black garlic and cabbage. And in Mumbai, India, the chef Hussain Shahzad, 37, of O Pedro wraps his version in chile- and vinegar-laced ground lamb, drizzling on vindaloo sauce when the egg comes out of the fryer. “It’s not a monotonous dish,” he says. “You get crisp crust, juiciness from the meat and the runny yolk … playing on the palate at the same time. There are so many layers to it.” — Mehr Singh",2024-09-23T09:00:51+0000

The unimaginable scale of its defeat on July 4, when it won the fewest seats in its history, looks like the downfall of moderate conservatism. It appears to be the final straw for the center-right parties offering pragmatism, prosperity and opportunity that have dominated Western politics since World War II. Almost everywhere conservatism’s brash rival, nationalist populism, is on the march: already in power with its colorful leaders in Hungary, Italy and Argentina; on the brink of it in the United States and France; and eroding the old-style conservatives in Germany, the Netherlands and now Britain. The rivalry on the right is in danger of becoming a rout, with the senior, steadier force swallowed by its insurgent challenger.",2024-09-26T05:00:07+0000

Though her body was healed by St. Peter, Agatha died anyway after Quintianus ordered her burned on a bed of coals, wrapped only in her red veil.

Just as the soloist, María Dueñas, ventures from tremulous, weeping articulations to slashing outbursts with impressive security, so too does the Philharmonic snap back and forth with alertness when approaching Ortiz’s contrasting, hurtling designs in the opening movement.

us,A Hudson Valley Spot That Channels Japanese Listening Bars,"As a fashion industry veteran, the men’s wear designer Jesse Rowe has been to countless stores. The one he can’t stop thinking about is Marcello, a hidden shop in Fukuoka, Japan. “You walk into a nondescript building, go up a couple of flights of stairs to the rooftop, walk along a stone path, then go down a fire escape to this completely transporting clothing shop,” says Rowe. The designer has brought that spirit of discovery to Zebra Room, a boutique in Germantown, N.Y., that’s equal parts coffee shop, cabinet of curiosities and listening lounge. Housed in a converted barn, Zebra Room devotes most of its square footage to a collection of midcentury Scandinavian furniture that Rowe’s brother imports from Copenhagen (highlights include an Inca chair by Arne Norell). There are also secondhand clothes and goods, from vintage marinière shirts to handmade leather dog collars. A coffee bar (which serves everything from Mexican café de olla to cold brew tonics topped with yuzu) is set up in a cube leftover from an exhibition held by the shop’s next-door neighbors Alexander Gray Associates. Rowe and his wife, the interior designer Loren Daye, clad the plaster installation with hemlock wood to keep with the natural feel of the space, which also has a 1970s cast-iron stove and retains the barn’s bluestone dirt floors. The cube houses Rowe’s record collection and sound system, which the designer has modeled after those in Japan’s kissa cafes. He alternates between vinyl and streaming, but the shop’s soundtrack is always played through a restored vintage SunValley/Dynaco tube amplifier and Klipsch LaScala speakers; similar tube amps, turntables and speakers are also for sale. “I want it to feel like someone’s living room — you might have to yell over the music,” says Rowe. instagram.com/_zebra_room.",2024-09-26T09:05:03+0000

us,"‘The Bouncer,’ ‘Pearl’ and More Streaming Gems","It was very easy, for quite some time, to dismiss Jean-Claude Van Damme as just another blank-slate action star. But something truly fascinating has happened as he’s grown older — in his best roles, he’s leaned into his vulnerability, playing his age rather than ignoring it. He no longer seems like a guy who can win every fight, so his fights are far more interesting. His face, like Clint Eastwood’s, has grown richer as its lines grow deeper and harder, and like Eastwood, he does his best acting when he seems to be doing nothing at all. This rough-and-tumble crime thriller from the gifted action director Julien Leclercq (“Sentinelle”) gives Van Damme plenty of character moments — it’s quieter and moodier than your typical bone-cruncher — but when the action beats arrive, they’re lean, mean and effective.",2024-09-27T09:01:54+0000

us,The Secret Art of David Hammons,"In the 1970s, the artist David Hammons started gathering hair from Black barbershops. In New York, he tacked the strands onto grease-slicked paper bags to make multidimensional collages, topped off with a few bones from barbecue ribs and a sprinkle of glitter. In Los Angeles, he affixed small tufts to pieces of wire and stuck them into the sands of Venice Beach; he let those wash away with the tides. He didn’t care much about making a work that he could sell. Then as now, Hammons wasn’t interested in catering to the art market — or even necessarily speaking to it. Over the course of his approximately 60-year-career, Hammons, 81 and currently based in the New York area, has participated in very few interviews. In a defining one from a 1986 issue of Real Life Magazine with the curator and historian Kellie Jones, he discusses his disdain for traditional galleries. “The rooms are almost always wrong, too much plasterboard, overlit, too shiny and too neat,” he says. “The work should be somewhere in between your house and where you’re going to see it.”",2024-09-30T09:00:54+0000
