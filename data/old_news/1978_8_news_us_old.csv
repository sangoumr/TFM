us,Admiring the Fishes of Summer,"DESPITE an everincreasing availability of creatures from the sea, Americans are not fish lovers. Last year, we consumed a mere 13 pounds of fish and seafood per person  compared with 52 pounds of chicken and 165 of red meat. And it is no wonder. The aquatic woria of fins, scales and shells can indeed be mysterious. And aside from familiarity with fish and chips dinners and an occasional lobster tail, many Americans would have difficulty describing the differences between a mullet and a mussel, a whiting and a weakfish. There are, of course, as many varieties of food of the deep as there are ways to prepare them. And to be at home with the soft brininess of a freshly opened oyster, to drink in the perfume of winesteamed mussels, to savor the essense of salmon in the form of faintly sweet, dillpungent gravlax, is to want to experiment with an even greater range of possibilities. Summer is an ideal time to experiment, to go fishing, since many types of fish and seafood are at their peak now, and can be served raw, lightly pickled or marinated, or cooked and then chilled. While raw fish dishes are common to the Japanese, some Western Indian tribes and the Eskimos, Americans, who have eaten steak tartare and fresh raw oysters for centuries, are just learning to like the delicate aroma and flavor of the Japanese sushi and sashimi. Caution should, of course, be exercised here, limiting raw fish to salt water, not fresh water, varieties. More familiar are the pickled or marinated fish and seafood, in the form or the classic Peruvian seviche, Spanish escabeche or Norwegian herring. Many kinds of fish and seafood can be cured by brief marination in a citric acid base combined with onions, red pepper, oil and spices for a sharp and piquant summer dish. Here, leaner fish are best, with many local varieties reaching peak production this month. Whiting, red snapper, floun- der, halibut and mackerel are all in season, and excellent for marinating. Sea scallops, used for the traditional seviche, also reach peak production in August. Finally there are the many dishes that, while delicious served hot during cool months, take on a totally different flavor in the summer. Among them are poached red snapper, steamed mussels and cooked squid.",1978-08-02T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Interiors,' a Departure for Woody Allen:Culture Shock","TO describe ""Interiors"" as Woody Allen's first serious drama is to stress the irrelevant. Mostly, though, it's to overlook the earnestness of all his comedies, from ""Take the Money and Run"" to ""Annie Hall,"" as well as the upside-down gravity of his familiar comic locutions that shrink Large Subjects to takeout size. ""There is no question that there is an unseen world,"" he once wrote in a trenchant essay titled ""Examining Psychic Phenomena."" ""The problem is, how far is it from midtown and how late is it open?""All of Mr. Allen's films have been serious to a certain degree, and they have been getting seriouser and seriouser as he has developed into one of America's most original, most personal, most audacious writer-directors. ""Annie Hall"" is a comedy of rare spirit, and it's as serious as any American film made in the last decade.Rather than describe ""Interiors"" as his first serious drama, I think it's more precise to say that it's the first Woody Allen film that doesn't care to be funny, That's something else entirely.""Interiors,"" which opens today at the Baronet, is a culture shock. Not to be prepared for it is to embark on a Miami Beach vacation having just taken a total immersion course in 17th-century English literature.""Interiors"" looks beautiful. It has been photographed by Gordon Willis in cool colors that suggest civilization's precarious control of natural forces. Woody himself is nowhere to be seen. It actually looks very much like an Ingmar Bergman film, and even sounds like one  the specific flatness of the Allen dialogue, its fondness for the jargon of the analysand, being the spoken equivalent to the not always inspired but perfectly functional English subtitles for Mr. Bergman's Swedish dialogue.There is even something foreign about the members of the middle-class New York family who are the center of the drama. They seem as socially disconnected from the world around them as they are emotionally and psychically disconnected from themselves and from one another. It's not simply that the movie concentrates so intensely on its characters, but that there are virtually no other people in sight. We do see people passing in the street, in corridors, in cars on highways, and we see, one time each, a small child and a Protestant minister, but it still seems as if the family inhabited its own empty, very spooky universe.""Interiors"" is not inaptly titled. From the opening sequence, a series of shots looking out at the sea from the sparely furnished rooms of a large, handsome Long Island beach house, it's apparent that we are to be given a film about emotional drain, unfulfilled longings and vaguely defined fears  things that are never easy to describe and always difficult to dramatize. Mr. Allen's characters are in the furious grip of making do. They are seized  and sometimes overcome  by the need to accommodate the common-place.They are Renata (Diane Keaton), the eldest daughter who is identified as a successful poet, and her husband Frederick (Richard Jordan), who is an unsuccessful novelist; Joey (Marybeth Hurt), the youngest daughter, a failed artist and actress who'd like to write and who lives on scratchy terms with a film maker named Mike (Sam Waterston); Flyn (Kristin Griffith), the middle daughter, a successful actress who makes dopey television films; Eve (Geraldine Page), the mother of the girls, an interior decorator and a woman who remains on the edge of despair because her longtime marriage to Arthur (E.G. Marshall), a very rich lawyer, is coming apart, and Pearl (Maureen Stapleton), the buxom, warmhearted widow Arthur now wants to marry.My problem with ""Interiors"" is that although I admire the performances and isolated moments, as well as the techniques and the sheer, headlong courage of this great, comic, film-making philosopher, I haven't any real idea what the film is up to. It's almost as if Mr. Allen had set out to make someone else's movie, say a film in the manner of Mr. Bergman, without having any grasp of the material, or first-hand, gut feelings about the characters. They seem like other people's characters, known only through other people's art.Could it possibly be that ""Interiors"" is really a Brooklyn Jewish boy's fantasy about middle-class American Protestantism? But I'm not even sure whether the family in the movie is Protestant, Catholic or Jewish. They could be anything because they are placed in no identifiable social context, something that Mr. Bergman never has had to worry about (until ""The Serpent's Egg"") because he has always dealt with the terrors of a thoroughly homogenized society.Miss Page, looking a bit like a youthful Louise Nevelson with mink-lashed eyes, is marvelous  erratically kind, impossibly demanding, pathetic in her loneliness and desperate in her anger. Miss Stapleton beautifully projects the tone and feelings of a sweet, robust, coarse woman who is never, never ridiculous. Mr. Marshall is also fine as the husband whose desperation matches his wife's, though it is disciplined by purpose. The other roles are more difficult to judge because the material is so nebulous.Miss Hurt is very appealing as the youngest daughter who hates her mother and, thus, goes out of her way to convince herself she doesn't. Her feelings of creative impotence are also understandable, but I don't know what we are meant to feel for her when she writes in her diary, ""Today I couldn't help experiencing a few nostalgic memories."" She suddenly sounds like one of those humorless college types  a young woman who aspires to talk beyond her degree  that appear so frequently in Mr. Allen's written literature.Mr. Waterston's role doesn't make any outrageous demands on him, but Mr. Jordan's unsuccessful novelist  as written  is very much the bearded, hard-drinking, tough-talking novelist that's been a Hollywood clich since movies began to talk. He just writes for higher-toned periodicals (The New York Review of Books).The most difficult role is Miss Keaton's. It's probably impossible to write or act convincingly a character who's supposed to be a successful poet. Just what constitutes success for a poet? Being published in The New Yorker? Winning famous awards (never mentioned in the film)? Not combing your hair and still looking great? Being miserable? From the dialogue and insights Mr. Allen gives her, Renata sounds as if she might really be quite a bad poet, at least when she goes on about being ""hyper-aware of her body.""Though the movie looks beautiful, the elegant style occasionally works against it, showing it up. This happens in a striking close-up of Miss Keaton, sitting alone on a photogenically windswept ocean beach as she is supposed to be thinking sensitive poet-type thoughts. Yet the image is empty. It's not the actress. It's not the director, whose close-ups of Miss Keaton in ""Annie Hall"" burst with love, pride and affection. The movie that contains the image fails to invest it with any associations whatsoever.",1978-08-02T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Magic of Lassie,' at Music Hall:Jaded Pooch","""THE MAGIC OF LASSIE,"" the latest ill-advised lulu at the Radio City Music Hall, begins with a song. James Stewart, playing the newest of Lassie's kindly old grandpas, leads two children in a number about ""that hometown feelin'"" and how wonderful life's simple virtues are. But in a movie in which the local grocery is a supermarket, the old-timey furniture is straight out of a Sears catalogue and the ""bricks"" by the hearth look like wallpaper, this kind of sentimentality is genuinely distressing. If anything, ""The Magic of Lassie"" is a testament to the creeping modernization of just about everything worthwhile. Even Lassie, who used to be just a smart, good-hearted and very, very clean dog, has developed the jaded manner of a veteran movie star.The ostensible villain of the piece is an evil zillionaire (Pernell Roberts), who means to steal Lassie, rename her ""Heatherbelle,"" and annex Grandpa's land to his own vineyards. These lackluster ambitions give rise to a lackluster plot, but never mind  the real heavies are offscreen, creating a monster of a score. The songs, written by Robert B. Sherman and Richard N. Sherman, and sung by either Debby or Pat Boone, are not to be wished upon even that most cloying of creatures, the show-biz dog.It's a well-known fact that Lassie, now a direct male descendant of the original male collie (female collies supposedly have less photogenic coats), has some very special talents. He/she has sixth, seventh and eighth senses when it comes to returning home or retrieving lost children and kittens. And he/she can understand remarks made in English, replying with a hearty ""Bark, bark!"" from time to time.But until now, Lassie's gift for breaking into song (via voiceovers) had been largely unexploited. No more: This time, as Lassie wanders forlornly along a railroad track. Miss Boone supplies Lassie-ish thoughts in the background. Sample lyric: ""I'm gonna get free by and by / I'm gonna get my patch of the sky.""Then there are the numbers attributed to the little boy who has loved and (temporarily) lost his magical pet: ""Lassie, my Lassie, I don't know why/But Lassie, I can't say goodbye."" And, most reprehensible of all, there is the episode in which Lassie, having of course run away from his/her wicked new master, stumbles across the entire Mike Curb congregation in a country field, just as they happen to be rehearsing a big banjo number.To whom is all this a worse insult  the dog lover, the music lover, the child forced to sit through the film by a well-meaning relative, or the optimist who thought the Music Hall's reprieve might amount to something?

us,Screen: Saga of a Car In 'Corvette Summer':A Double Debut,"THERE isn't a line in ""Corvette Summer"" that doesn't read better than it plays. It's not just that Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins, who make their respective producing and directing debuts, are best known as the screen-writing team responsible for ""The Sugarland Express,"" ""MacArthur"" and ""Bingo Long""; it's that they overstate scenes in a way they'd never dream of overwriting them.The central portion of ""Corvette Summmer,"" set in Las Vegas with an ""Alice in Wonderland"" air, has a visual zaniness that meshes effectively with the script. But for the most part, the movie takes a slender, boyish conceit  of the sort that is suddenly so popular among Hollywood's current batch of boy wonders  and invests it with silliness rather than whimsy.Ostensibly, this is the story of a boy (Mark Hamill) and his car (a lovingly customized Corvette). In fact, it is the picaresque saga of a crazy, hopeless search, once the car is stolen and the boy sets out to recover it.The premise is not unlike that of ""The Sugarland Express,"" in which a mother embarked on a long journey to recover her child, traveling across a landscape that seemed increasingly mad as the trip wore on. But Mr. Barwood and Mr. Robbins brought a wisdom to that earlier script that they deliberately eschew here, in the interests of a brand of juvenilia that simply doesn't suit them.""Hal and I really aren't into cars, but we felt the Corvette was the perfect symbol for our story and our hero,"" Mr. Robbins is quoted as saying in production notes for the film. That's the trouble, right there: The movie seems to have been conceived in a fairly sophisticated spirit and then clumsily translated into kiddie-ese.Mr. Hamill, who had just the right insistent innocence for ""Star Wars,"" is this time obliged to affect a navet that would be unconvincing in a tiny child. Annie Potts, as a would-be call girl he meets along his way, has Goldie Hawn's loopiness without the charm.Miss Potts may well be a gifted comedienne, but Mr. Robbins never lets her relax enough for the talent to show. Too often, he strains his actors' enthusiasm to the breaking point.Still, the middle of the movie is appealing, for anyone who can tolerate a mirthlessly nutty beginning and an ungainly shoot-'em-up finale. In Las Vegas, the half-mad buoyancy of Mr. Hamill's search for a four-wheeled Holy Grail finds an appropriately sun-baked setting, and Mr. Robbins's direction tackles pop culture with a gusto that resembles his hero's. It's a pity that the segment of the film that finally achieves a cockeyed conviction is so short-lived.""Corvette Summer"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") because Miss Potts's character makes no bones about what her new line of work is to be, and because of some very fleeting, dimly-lit nudity.",1978-08-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Burt Reynolds In Action in 'Hooper':Moviemaking Fun,"""SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT,"" the Burt Reynolds movie that ""Hooper"" both follows up and improves upon, was a nationwide blockbuster and a washout in New York. The audience for ""Hooper"" won't be so neatly divided, and it may even be just as big. Mr. Reynolds is one of the most effortlessly appealing movie stars around, but consolidating his following has always been a problem: There are fans who like to watch him. tearing up the highway, and there are fans who enjoy his delightfully flippant self-mockery, with all the covert thoughtfulness it implies. This time, Mr. Reynolds has made a movie to please fans of all persuasions, and to please them a great deal.The title character, whom Mr. Reynolds plays, is the greatest Hollywood stuntman of his generation. Accordingly, he is sandwiched between the battered, ex-greatest stuntman of the previous generation (Brian Keith) and a fancy young newcomer (Jan-Michael Vincent) eager to give the old boys a run for their money. Watching Mr. Vincent dive off a skyscraper, Hooper and a friend remark, with a characteristic blend of malice and merriment, ""Well, we probably could've done that when we were his age  'cept they didn't have buildings that high.""Hooper, who is working as stunt coordinator on a movie called ""The Spy Who Laughed at Danger,"" sees retirement in the cards. So does his doctor: ""If you were a horse, I'd shoot you,"" the doctor remarks, looking over the latest demolition job Hooper has done on his vertebrae. The presence of young, handsome and vigorous Mr. Vincent suggests the limitations time will impose on both Hooper's career as a glutton for punishment and Mr. Reynolds's as a matinee idol.But the film, while pensive enough to hint at these things, isn't so morose that it cares to dwell on them. It's far more interested in demonstrating  very convincingly  that making a movie can be more fun than almost anything else in the world.Mr. Reynolds and Hal Needham, who directed ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" use the film-set milieu to generate some lovely in-jokes. At one point, Hooper is shown entertaining guests at a party with a reel of his favorite stunts, including some of Mr. Reynolds's own white-water work in ""Deliverance."" The guests are fast asleep.And then there is the highly unpopular director of the spy film, played with wonderfully humorless self-importance by Robert Klein. Concocting a finale that involves cars crashing into people in wheelchairs, buildings collapsing, explosions everywhere and a spectacular automobile jump across a river, the director is peeved to hear that his crew may not be able to execute all this. ""I don't care. I want it!"" he whines. ""It's the ending I want. It's the statement I want to make."" Later, when the elaborate scene is set up, Mr. Klein pronounces it to have ""a nice grayness, like 'La Strada.'""In another scene. Mr. Klein shrieks something about movies being ""pieces of time."" For anyone unfamiliar with the title of Peter Bogdanovich's book of critical essays, let's just say that Mr. Reynolds has got even for ""Nickelodeon"" and ""At Long Last Love.""There is genuine humor and tenderness in Mr. Reynolds's romantic episodes with Sally Field, who plays Mr. Keith's very patient daughter, and there is real vitality in the large-scale action sequences. Also, Mr. Reynolds's generosity is particularly impressive. It's heartening to watch as scene-stealing an actor as Mr. Reynolds work this hard to make himself an ensemble player, just one of the boys.""Hooper"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), largely because of the innocuous cussing that constitutes part of the stuntmen's camaraderie.",1978-08-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Eyes of Laura Mars':In The Netherworld,"DEAD men in evening clothes; supine women guarded by sleek, ferocious dogs; upside-down corpses wearing garter-belts, with their hair and makeup in exquisite disarray  these are the tricks of Laura Mars's trade, the hallmarks that have established her as the New York fashion photographer who outkinks them all. However, not everyone is a fan. Someone has gotten the notion that there's evil in Laura's work, he/ she/it has decided to wipe out the photographer plus all her super-hyper-ultra chi-chi friends.So far, very good indeed  especially because the ""Eyes of Laura Mars"" audience is given ample opportunity to share the killer's pique. Laura (Faye Dunaway), being much too self-involved an artiste to worry about the implications of her work, merely thinks of herself as someone who gives ""an account of the times in which I'm living,"" times rife with ""moral, spiritual and emotional murder.""Questions about the exploitative aspects of her art merely prompt Laura to snap, ""Look, does anyone have anything positive to ask?"" The models she works with are even more trendily blase.These models are almost certainly being set up, deliciously, during the early parts of the film. They giggle, chew bubble gum, have pet teddy bears, don't seem to know when they're wearing clothes and when they aren't, and date rich idiots when they aren't making eyes at one another.When Laura's whole crew is hauled into a police station for questioning, one of the girls is irate at being treated like a hooker, even though she's more than dressed for the part. Another merely complains of being bored.A couple of Laura's shooting sessions, staged with a delightful blend of nonchalance and depravity, epitomize the wickedly satirical edge of this lively, high-toned thriller.While two cars are aflame in Columbus Circle, and models in lingerie and fur coats prettily smack each other around, Laura, bless her creative little heart, is all business, solemnly snapping away in a Theoni Aldredge creation. Occasional cuts to spectators in the street make it clear that Laura may well have just arrived from the planet for which she is named, as far as workaday Joe or Joan America is concerned.However, right in the middle of the session Laura has a psychic flash, something that neither she nor the movie needs.Laura can witness killings taking place across town, but only from the unseen killer's point of view  the better to forestall a surprise ending that is altogether dumbfounding (with the emphasis on dumb). These flashes leave her understandably frantic, but Laura has already been established as too much of an amoral flake to arouse much sympathy in her lady-in-distress capacity.But forget the faltering finale, and never mind about a score that, although it includes Barbra Streisand's smashing rendition of the theme song, also makes the killer's forays even more ominously heralded than Bruce the Shark's.It's the cleverness of ""Eyes of Laura Mars"" that counts, cleverness that manifests itself in superlative casting, drily controlled direction from Irvin Kershner, and spectacular settings that turn New York into the kind of eerie, lavish dreamland that could exist only in the idle noodlings of the very, very hip.Ren Auberjonois brings his full supply of comic prissiness to the role of Miss Mars's principal artistic whatch-amatcallit, and Raul Julia makes her ex-husband a brooding loon, hence a good suspect.The best supporting performance comes from Brad Dourif (who played the young suicide in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest""), as an ex-con who epitomizes both the movie's taste for voyeurism and its essential seediness. Mr. Dourif, whose bedraggled appearance and half-unhinged manner make it hard to believe he would ever have been hired to carry Miss Mars's lens caps, has been given the job of chauffeur by Mr. Auberjonois, for shady reasons we will never know.Mr. Dourif's awe and fear at what he witnesses during the course of a typical Mars day is the keenest commentary the movie has to offer. His tiniest gestures are noteworthy. Miss Dunaway is perfect for her role, but it's beginning to look like the only role she cares to play.Hysterical jitters, countered by fits of extreme hauteur or assertiveness, have constituted so many of her recent performances that it's hard to remember what else she can do. In any case, high-minded artistic fluttering  the kind Diane Keaton attempts in ""Interiors""  comes so naturally to Miss Dunaway that Tommy Lee Jones, as a down-to-earth, soothing cop, is not just a good foil but an indispensable one. Without his stabilizing presence, the movie might well have turned into a ""Network"" set in the netherworld.A footnote: Miss Dunaway has lately had to play some of the worst-written love scenes on the block, and ""Laura Mars"" gives her another clinker of this ilk. When she and Mr. Jones embrace at long last, she says ""It's terrifying."" He says ""It's beautiful."" She was right the first time.",1978-08-04T05:00:00+0000

Within the terms of its plot, Jodie Foster, a delinquent foster child up to no good in the streets of Los Angeles, is whisked off to a Tudor mansion in Warwickshire, a journey that seems more a vault across generations than across distance.There, ostensibly in league with a blustering villain inspired by Dickens and played by Leo McKern, she is to try to pass herself off as the long-missing marchioness, heir to the estate; and she is to endeavor to find a hidden treasure, whose existence is known only to McKern and Vivian Pickles, who portrays his sister, a servant discharged from Candleshoe.And who should be the kindly current mistress of Candleshoe? Why none other than Helen Hayes, who has taken in a few orphans from the overcrowded local children's home. And who should be the perfect butler, the feisty Scottish gardener, the tippling chauffeur and the old colonel who takes tea with old Lady Gwendolyn? Not four people, but one  David Niven, doffing and donning wigs and mustaches and eyebrows and various articles of clothing in league with the orphans to keep Lady Gwendolyn from knowing that time and the taxman have reduced her circumstances to a point of peril.The cast is beyond reproach. In this summer when Hollywood seems to have concluded that box-office magic lies in setting its best young actresses down in England, Miss Foster as Casey Brown easily keeps pace with Tatum O'Neal as Sarah Brown (could they be related?) in ""International Velvet."" Miss Hayes, Mr. Niven, Mr. McKern and Miss Pickles comport themselves with their customary professionalism.There's a new Walt Disney movie in town. Kids, take grandma.",1978-08-04T05:00:00+0000

The index, which tends to foretell future economic trends, was essentially unchanged in May. Other signs that economic growth may be more sluggish in the remainder of 1978: New factory orders dipped threetenths of percent in June, and sales of new domestic cars injuly eased off the heady pace of May and June. Detroit reported sales gains of only fourtenths of a percent in last month's final 10day selling period from the yearearlier period although for the full month deliveries were 4.2 percent better that in 1977 Prices received by farmers for their goods fell for the first time in nine months, according to the Agriculture Department.

Opposite page: Sequin jumpsuit by Ronald Kolodzie, dress by Norma Kamali and fox coat by Halston for Ben Kahn.","It started because director Sidney Lumet wanted the segment to be all about status and style. It ended up with Oscar de la Renta, Bill Blass, Mary McFadden, Ralph Lauren, Halston, Norma Kamali, Stephen Burrows, Scott Barrie, Zoran, Ronald Kolodzie, Fernando Sanchez and furriers Alixandre and Ben Kahn producing the costumes that help turn the Emerald City scene in the UniversalMotown film The Wiz, due in October, into a razzle dazzle spectacular. While the star, Diana Ross, gets to wear only one simple white blouse and skirt through two hours or more of film, 400 beautiful black dancers get to preen and prance for 10 minutes  changing costumes three times  in original creations by these top fashion talents. The result is an unforgettable extravaganza (for instance, the moment when 20 handsome male dancers hoof it up in impeccably tailored Ralph Lauren tuxedos  of gold lame). It is also a salute to American design talent. The idea came from Joel Schumacher, screenwriter of The Wiz, and, according to most of the designers, it was because of his enthusiasm that they agreed to do it. They were given color swatches and $200 for each costume a pittance compared to the average $1,000 it takes to produce a single sample. Each design was made three times  once in emerald green, once in red and once in gold. Everyone had a field day. Some, like Halston, refused to use inexpensive theatrical fabrics and sent costumes made of stuff costing $100 a yard and more. Bill Blass's arrived with his usual custommade touches. Fernando Sanchez cut short a Paris holiday to personally drape each dress. Said Norma Kamali, When we finished, we all had tears in our eyes. We had enjoyed it so much. All of them made a great contribution of time, talent and money. says Joel Schumacher.
