DEMONSTRATION SPORTS","CURLING: One event for men and one for women in this version of lawn bowling on ice. There is separate competition for men and women. Each match involves two teams (called rinks) of four curlers. One curler slides a 42-pound rounded granite stone down a 146-foot strip of ice. As he releases the stone, he twists the handle to make the stone curl, the way a bowling ball hooks. Two teammates sweep the ice vigorously with brooms. The idea is to make the stone move faster and to get it to stop close to the target at the end of the strip or else bump away an opponent's stone. The team that places the most stones in the center of the target area wins. Canada and Norway are favored. The United States men's team, from Superior, Wis., keeps it in the family. It consists of 54-year-old Bud Somervill;, his 53-year-old brother-in-law, Bill Strum, and their sons.",1992-02-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Kazakhstan's Dark Satanic Mills,"Perhaps it was the desolate vastness of Kazakhstan that led Soviet leaders to believe it was just the spot to try out grandiose schemes. Here, Moscow installed its space center and a major nuclear weapons testing range. Here, too, Moscow decreed that mammoth factories, like the lead smelter (left) in Chimkent, an industrial city, were to be superimposed on a predominantly agricultural society. Since the late 1920's, a succession of Kremlin directives, one seemingly more ambitious than the other, tried to transform a steppeland twice the area of Alaska, a region of endless prairie and rugged mountains, of rivers disappearing in desert sands. First, the Kazakhs -- nomadic stockherders of Mongolian and Turkic origin -- were forced to become collectivized farmers. Then, in the doomed Virgin Lands campaign beginning in the 50's, tens of millions of acres of grassland in the arid north were plowed and planted with wheat. But what probably changed Kazakhstan more than any other edict from Moscow was its conversion into an industrial base. Kazakhstan is rich in mineral deposits, and its industrial centers, developed since the 60's, are crowded with iron and steel works; copper, lead and zinc factories; cement and phosphate plants. Kazakhstan was the Soviet Union's largest producer of lead. Today, the sovereign republic, like the other components of the old Soviet Union, is joining the community of industrialized nations at the same time it is confronted with the legacy of past decades: hugely inefficient factories that have despoiled one of the most pristine lands in Central Asia.",1992-02-02T05:00:00+0000

In 1990, he launched a successful run for the job of Premier of Thuringia, one of Germany's five eastern states, by showing up shortly after unification and presenting himself as a staunch anti-Communist supporter of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. Funny thing, though, he always refused to discuss his past. But, bit by bit, things came out -- like the fact that he had been an officer in the East Gerfman security police and that in another post he had the power to evict critics of the Government from state housing. The breaking point came when newspapers published pictures of Mr. Duchac in pre-unification days dressed in a clown suit for the entertainment of an audience of secret police. This, he said, was just a harmless expression of his interest in theater. But Mr. Duchac's fellow Christian Democrats in Thuringia's legislature weren't buying it.

Streetscapes","Born a slave in 1854, Bill Traylor worked on a plantation near Selma, Ala., until his early 80's, when he arrived, a homeless man, in Montgomery and began sketching. He produced more than 1,000 works in three years. Thirty years after Traylor's death at the age of 93, his art reached a national audience; in 1982, 36 of his works appeared in an exhibition called ""Black Folk Art in America, 1930-1980,"" at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. In recent years his drawings have been featured in exhibitions around the world, including one at the Ricco-Maresca Gallery in New York City, owned by Frank Maresca and Roger Ricco, the authors of BILL TRAYLOR: His Art -- His Life (Knopf, $50). No perspective organizes Traylor's art; the very idea of a vanishing point is beside the point. Each of his works is as bold and corporeal as a stamped impression -- or a shadow -- of a particular presence: someone strolling past the Monroe Street fruit stand where he sketched, for example. What emerges from this monograph is a coherent sensibility of an ingenuous and witty man inspired by the secular world. Traylor's work connects with the broadest tradition of folk art: isolated individuals who excerpted and inventoried from their immediate world without thoughts of posterity. To the academic question ""What's to be made of this?"" one can offer the parsimonious answer ""Nothing more than the glorious fact that it was made.""",1992-02-02T05:00:00+0000

But with the recession, the potential value of the memberships dwindled to $150,000. That meant that Mr. Isutani would have to sell so many memberships that an untouchable tradition at Pebble Beach -- public access -- would be threatened, and the California Coastal Commission rejected the plan. Mr. Isutani has a $400 million loan payment due later this year. A spokesman said last week that Mr. Isutani has not yet come up with a new plan for financing the purchase.

Japan's Nippon downed Spain's Espana 92 by 4:34, completing the course in 2:33:50. New Zealand and Sweden's Tre Kronor paired off in an unofficial race, with New Zealand winning by 9:57. The two boats had been scheduled to race the Australian boats, but both Spirit of Australia and Challenge Australia withdrew to begin keel modifications in preparation for Round 2. New Zealand and Tre Kronor each received a point for their default victories. Nippon and New Zealand, with 6-1 records, have 6 points each and are tied for first place. Ville de Paris (5-2) moved into a second-place tie with Il Moro di Venezia, followed by Spirit of Australia (3-4), Espana 92 (2-5) and Tre Kronor (1-6). Challenge Australia is without a victory. (AP) AUTO RACING Nissan Endures An all-Japanese Nissan R91 prototype ran a virtually flawless race on the way to an overpowering record victory yesterday in the Rolex 24 endurance race at Daytona International Speedway in Florida. The LeMans-style Nissan, co-driven by Masahiro Hasemi, Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Toshio Suzuki, beat the second-place Jaguar XJR-12 by nine laps on the 3.56-mile circuit. The winning car, giving Nissan its first international 24-hour victory in its first attempt in America's most prestigious road race, covered 762 laps -- 2,712.72 miles -- and averaged 112.897 miles an hour. The previous record on the current course was 761 laps, 2,709.16 miles and an average of 112.857 m.p.h., set in 1990 by a Jaguar prototype. (AP)",1992-02-03T05:00:00+0000

However, his belief that Americans can coalesce on a policy that ""discourages"" abortion without making it illegal is probably too optimistic. The polarization of Americans on this issue results from some pretty deep differences. Differences in life style, for one thing, can dictate profound political polarization. Many American women derive their most fundamental sense of self-worth from child-rearing and care of the family; many others find theirs in lives that include participation in the larger society, particularly the work place. For women in ""traditional"" families (and their husbands), untrammeled access to abortion constitutes a form of permissiveness that threatens the things they hold most dear. For women whose identities are tied to work outside the home, the right to control reproductive lives is essential.",1992-02-09T05:00:00+0000

Now airlines, which have long offered business class internationally, are adding business class compartments and seats domestically, enhancing service and pushing tickets that cost more than the rarely paid full coach fare but less than first-class fare. By one estimate, the average price paid one-way for a transcontinental trip in coach class at the end of 1991 was $396; business class tickets can be $400 to $500 more than this.",1992-02-09T05:00:00+0000

He found no takers for his 5-foot-7 frame until he used his last few dollars for a bus to Shaw University in Raleigh, N.C.

us,Headliners; In Harm's Way,"The sound of the whistle gets a lot of attention at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the Government's oldest and dirtiest nuclear laboratories. When Charles D. Varnadore, a 50-year-old mechanic at Oak Ridge, appeared on a CBS News program last year to talk about the incidence of cancer at the lab, including his own, executives of the Martin-Marietta subsidiary that runs the Tennessee lab rushed to do something about it. What they did, Mr. Varnadore said in a complaint to the Labor Department, was assign him to do busywork in an isolated room containing toxic and radioactive chemicals. Last weekend, the Labor Department ruled that Mr. Varnadore's employer had broken several laws and discriminated against him by placing him in a work space of ""questionable"" safety. The company is appealing and Mr. Varnadore is seeking damages. One of his lawyers said, ""What they did borders on attempted murder, knowingly putting a cancer patient with a suppressed immune system in there.""",1992-02-09T05:00:00+0000

But in this genre the distinction blurs. Mr. Crichton's characters frequently deliver short lectures on the subject of Japan's insidious design, mixing established fact with fantasy. The result is a thriller that doubles as a crude polemic. Just in case the reader misses his point, Mr. Crichton warns in an afterword of Japan's ""adversarial trade, trade like war, trade intended to wipe out the competition,"" and encourages readers to verify the claims his characters make by consulting several recent works of nonfiction, which he lists.",1992-02-09T05:00:00+0000

'Desperation is Never Pretty'","Born in 1960 and raised in a middle-class Brooklyn neighborhood, Jean Michel Basquiat made his first splash on the streets of SoHo in the late 1970's as half of the graffiti team known as Samo. From there, with Andy Warhol, whose influence is visible in his work, as his mentor, Basquiat had his 15 minutes of fame in the 80's and died of a drug overdose in 1988. ""There is an intrinsic ugliness to such an appetite for self-intoxication, self-revelation and self-expression,"" the art critic Robert Storr writes in his wise and jazzy introduction to BASQUIAT DRAWINGS (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, Paper, $35), edited by John Cheim, the director of the Robert Miller Gallery in New York City. ""Desperation is never pretty. It can be stylish, however, and Basquiat understood this completely."" Although he is known for his paintings, many critics have argued that Basquiat was best at drawing. Basquiat's sources included dollar bills, Bellini Madonnas and Degas nudes, and cartoon characters such as Bullwinkle and Elmer Fudd. Besides the fact that Basquiat was clearly a gifted draftsman, what is most apparent in these drawings is his frenetic energy. Perhaps more than any other artist's drawings of the 1980's, Basquiat's are a sign of those times.",1992-02-09T05:00:00+0000

There are certain changes that I would need to make to make my home more accessible. My biggest concern is that I be able to have a washer/dryer in my apartment. I understand that some co-op boards frown on this, especially if there is a coin laundry in the building. But it would be nearly impossible for me to use such a facility. Are there laws concerning the rights of the disabled that would give me leverage with a landlord, co-op board of directors or board of managers on this matter? . . . Paul Finnelli, Brooklyn Answer: Yes. According to Janet Eriv, who serves as counsel to the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities, there are several laws that help disabled people with accessibility. Ms. Eriv said the most specific to your case is the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. This law says, in part, that a landlord or co-op or condominium board cannot refuse a disabled person's request to make reasonable modifications to the interior or common areas of a residential building that would provide full use and access. An exception would be if the landlord or board could show that the requested changes would have a harmful effect on the building or its system or would be an impediment to other residents. Your request to install a washer/dryer, for example, could be denied if it would hurt the building's plumbing system or affect water use in some way.",1992-02-09T05:00:00+0000

Wedgwood, a local lad, went to work with Thomas Whieldon in Fenton, next door to Stoke, in 1754 and began his own business in 1759. Josiah Spode was an apprentice to Whieldon and left to open a factory in 1770. Spode used the skills of Thomas Minton who showed a similar entrepreneurial flair. He founded his pottery in 1793. It was the museums on the premises of these three companies -- still very much in business if no longer family owned -- that I visited in Stoke.

About 450 visitors will be allowed into the garden at one time and may stay as long as they wish. On the busiest days, later arrivals will have to wait their turn until people in the garden leave. Some may be asked to return another day. A spokesman for the National Trust said the average time spent in the garden was about one and a half hours, though this depends on the weather.

The Unusual and the Unfamous","Haunting images of society's outsiders and unfortunates have been the continuing interest of the photographer Mary Ellen Mark, as shown in MARY ELLEN MARK: 25 Years (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $60). The book, edited by Marianne Fulton, a curator at the International Museum of Photography, traces, in 130 richly textured images, the photographer's preoccupation with the lives of those who are, in her words, ""the unfamous."" Ms. Mark seeks out disregarded, marginal lives, like the anonymous subject of ""Tattooed Man at Aryan Nations Congress, Hayden Lake, Idaho,"" who, standing alone on a gravel road, turns to display a flaming swastika emblazoned on his back. She is equally drawn to people in bizarrely unusual situations, like the Indian circus performers who were the subject of a 1989 project. Ms. Mark records often sad, and always difficult, situations in images that are both emotional and highly sensuous; moving in close to her subjects, she brings tactile immediacy to both the seductive and the repulsive. Ms. Fulton says that Ms. Mark looks for universals; the photographer's strength lies in her ability to unite the humanity of her subjects with the formal imperatives of art.",1992-02-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Heir Apparent at Time Warner Is Out Amid Signs of Dissension,"Time Warner Inc. said yesterday that N. J. Nicholas Jr., the designated successor to the company's chairman, Steven J. Ross, had resigned and would be replaced by Gerald M. Levin, the vice chairman. Many in the company saw the unexpected resignation as a result of a clash between Mr. Ross and Mr. Nicholas, whose total 1990 compensation of $96.4 million made them the nation's highest-paid executives. But it also meant the collapse of a succession agreement central to the 1990 merger of two corporate empires, Warner Communications and Time Inc., to form the world's largest media company. Mr. Ross and Mr. Nicholas fell out over the company's ultimately successful search for foreign investors, according to two people closely involved in the company's affairs. Mr. Ross wanted to sell minority interests while maintaining control of all the company's properties, while Mr. Nicholas sought other ways for the heavily indebted company to raise money. Expressed No Regrets The company said Mr. Levin -- like Mr. Nicholas, a longtime employee of Time Inc. -- would serve as Time Warner's president and co-chief executive, the title that Mr. Nicholas had shared with Mr. Ross. Mr. Ross, the former chief executive of Warner Communications Inc., and Richard Munro, the former chairman of Time Inc., had agreed at the time of the merger that Mr. Nicholas would first share executive authority, then take charge by himself in the mid-1990's. Although the company's statement simply said Mr. Nicholas resigned, Mr. Ross, in a memo to employees, expressed no regrets and left no doubt that he favored Mr. Nicholas's departure. Several who know Mr. Nicholas well say he was intent on remaining with the company but was forced out. Mr. Ross, 64 years old, is an obsessive deal maker known for fostering loyal and skilled managers. Lately, he has been undergoing intensive chemotherapy for prostate cancer and since December has scarcely been seen at the office. Even if he returns, it is widely expected that he will focus chiefly on strategy, leaving operations to Mr. Levin. Mr. Levin and Mr. Nicholas, both 52 years old, have long been rivals. Mr. Levin was dropped from Time's board in the early 1980's as Mr. Nicholas advanced, but it was Mr. Levin who conceived of the Warner merger to further the company's global ambitions. Strong Ties Forged Since then, say some executives, Mr. Levin has forged strong ties with Warner officials, including Mr. Ross, while Mr. Nicholas did not develop the same rapport. According to one executive at Time Warner, Mr. Nicholas was asked to come back from his vacation home in Vail, Colo., for an unscheduled board meeting, but chose not to do so. The board approved the changes unanimously. Mr. Nicholas's wife, reached in Vail, said her husband would not comment. Graef S. Crystal, a leading expert on executive compensation, said Mr. Ross received compensation of $82.6 million, Mr. Nicholas $13.8 million and Mr. Levin $8.6 million in 1990. The company has disputed Mr. Crystal's figures, which include bonuses and stock options. Wall Street analysts said yesterday that they thought the news, which came after the stock market closed, was favorable for the company. ""The most important ingredient for the leader of the company, and the area in which Steve excels, is broad stratetgic thinking,"" said Emanuel Gerard, a partner at Gerard Klauer Mattison, an investment firm. ""I think Jerry is a much stronger strategic thinker than Nick and has a broader base of support from both the Time and Warner people."" Industry analysts credit Mr. Nicholas, a reserved and rather formal executive, with building Time Inc.'s cable operations and watching over the company's spending. 'Difference in Philosophy' But several executives said Mr. Ross's illness, and the uncertainities it raised, had helped pushed the board to change the line of succession yesterday. But one person with close ties to the company added that such a shift was only a question of timing. ""I think there has been a very, very real difference in philosophy between the two men for some time,"" he said. He said Mr. Nicholas had initially opposed Time Warner's decision to sell a stake in its entertainment business to the Toshiba Corporation and C. Itoh and Company, two big Japanese companies, because he opposed bringing in foreign investors. Mr. Nicholas preferred to sell some properties outright, a course that Mr. Ross opposed. Ultimately, Mr. Nicholas voted for the Toshiba deal. ""You patch things up for a while, but they do not go away,"" said this person, who has detailed knowledge of the company's affairs. ""Jerry was much more in tune with Steve's vision."" Indeed, Mr. Levin had accompanied Mr. Ross to Japan to negotiate the deal. Another person with close ties to the company said Mr. Ross had approached the board about designating a new heir. In yesterday's memo, Mr. Ross acknowledged that he and Mr. Nicholas had clashed over the company's direction. ""Nick's decision was based on his sense that there was sufficient difference regarding our strategic focus, between him on the one hand and the board and his management colleagues on the other,' Mr. Ross's memo said. Mr. Ross said that Mr. Nicholas had left with ""a sense of great and well-deserved pride"" in the company's achievements and ""a host of friendships forged during the merger."" As for Mr. Levin, Mr. Ross was effusive, saying he ""had been unfailingly impressed by Jerry's judgment, his insightful understanding of all our businesses and his commitment to fully realizing Time Warner's enormous potential."" In two years, Mr. Levin has come to be a favorite with the board, distinguishing himself in explaining complicated financial and strategic actions. Mr. Levin had a good sense ofthe board members' personalities and outlooks, one person close to the board said. Several executives in the industry say Mr. Levin was also well liked by Warner's chairman, Robert Daly, and its president, Terry Semel, and had a strong knowledge of the movie business from his days at Home Box Office Inc., a Time Warner cable television subsidiary. Mr. Nicholas, meanwhile, did not manage to form alliances with the top executives at Warner Brothers, the movie studio, and Warner Records, one executive said. Praise for Rising Executive Yesterday's news shows that Mr. Levin made a strong comeback. Until yesterday, Mr. Levin had served as chief operating officer, but had gradually been accruing power for a year. Mr. Levin was also a favorite of Mr. Ross's closest confidant, Ed Aboudi, who worked with Mr. Ross in negotiating the merger. In a recent interview, Mr. Aboudi spoke glowingly of Mr. Levin but failed to mention Mr. Nicholas. In Los Angeles, film executives predicted that the shift would have no substantive effect on Warner Brothers. Officials at the studio declined to comment. But film executives close to the studio said the parent company had adopted a hands-off policy towards decision-making, even on controversial Warner films, like Oliver Stone's ""J.F.K."" ""It's always been a hands-off operation, and we expect that it will continue to be so,"" said one film executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The executive said the emergence of Mr. Levin was viewed positively in the film community. ""You've got a guy who comes more from the creative side, like Steve Ross,"" as opposed to someone with a numbers bent, he said. ime Warner Inc. said yesterday that N. J.

In the last decade alone, poaching for ivory in Africa has reduced the elephant population from 1.3 million to about 600,000 -- a kill rate that would eliminate the elephant from most of that continent in the next 20 years. And for what? The manufacture of ornamental carvings and Asian signature stamps. In THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT: Last Days of Eden (Voyageur, $27.95), Boyd Norton, who has spent more than 20 years photographing wild animals, gives us a magnificent pictorial essay. He shows elephants in their African habitat, playing in a dust bath and affectionately entwining trunks and tusks. His shots depict a wrinkled old matriarch leading a family gathering to a water hole, a calf nestling at its mother's side or trying to stand on wobbly legs, and a bull with ears flapping as he charges. With these and other images not so pretty (bloodied carcasses, pyramids of tusks waiting to be sold), the book makes a strong case for the preservation of these magnificent animals, as well as other species that share their environs. More than a dozen countries in 1989 banned the importing of ivory; we can now hope that the African elephant will be protected.",1992-02-23T05:00:00+0000

us,HOW TO END THE ABORTION WAR,"We must break the deadlock over the abortion issue by rethinking what is essential and central to our beliefs, what is posturing and what we can let go. Surely, we can agree that the beginning of life is a remarkable continuum, from conception to birth -- one with many shades of gray. Can we not also agree that a woman has a right to control her body, but that with that right goes the responsibility that, when a child is not wanted, contraceptives be used and that, when contraceptives fail, an early decision on whether to continue the pregnancy be made? Can we not then agree that a woman who fails to act thus responsibly forfeits a measure of her rights in favor of the developing life now dependent on her? Is there not a point at which the fetus has earned the right to complete its gestation? That it is difficult to define at what point one should protect a developing life should not detract us from the necessity of doing so. KATHERINE H. DANIELS Lancaster, Pa.",1992-02-23T05:00:00+0000

Rookie Paces Canadiens Rookie Gilbert Dionne scored three consecutive goals last night as the Montreal Canadiens extended their unbeaten streak to eight games with a 4-1 victory over the Minnesota North Stars in Bloomington, Minn. Dionne broke open a 1-1 game with two goals in a 24-second span of the second period, then added a third-period goal for the Canadiens, who are 5-0-3 in their last eight games. The hat trick was the first for Dionne -- the brother of Marcel Dionne -- in 24 games since being called up to the Canadiens on Dec. 22.
