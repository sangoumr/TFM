After months of rumors about the sale of the Nets and competing offers from bidders on both sides of the Hudson River, the warring factions within YankeeNets, which owns the Nets, the Yankees, and 30 percent of the Devils, are expected to culminate the matter, said one member of the YankeeNets board. The executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 15-member board would decide whether to put the Nets up for sale through an auction process or come up with an interim financial plan to deal with team losses that could run as high as $100 million over the next two years. One potential bidder as well as state officials in New Jersey and New York said that they, too, had been told of the board meeting.

The decision yesterday struck down the district court's ruling that prison beds in pretrial detention facilities be spaced so that detainees' heads are at least six feet apart, instead of three feet, the current standard. Lawyers with the Legal Aid Society argued that the six-foot standard was necessary for both physical and emotional health reasons. Michael A. Cardozo, the city's corporation counsel, said such a change would require more jail space that would cost more than $100 million to build. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit also rejected another lower court order that the city provide a minimum lighting standard in certain cells and dormitories.

The ministry for development, industry and foreign trade said exports in August were a record $6.4 billion, while imports, slowed by a weak economy, were $3.73 billion. The August surplus was larger than the $1.57 billion surplus recorded 12 months ago, and it lifted the figure for the year through August above the $13 billion for all of last year. Brazil needs a surplus to help compensate for a drop in direct foreign investment, which fell 63 percent, to $3.5 billion, in the first half of the year. Brazil has been a magnet for direct foreign investment in Latin America over the last decade, but inflows have slowed with the end of its privatization program.

The executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 15-member board would decide whether to put the Nets up for sale through an auction process or come up with an interim financial plan to deal with team losses that could run as high as $100 million over the next two years. One potential bidder as well as state officials in New Jersey and New York said that they, too, had been told of the board meeting.

The agreement includes a provision for New Jersey to grant broad powers to an independent panel to shape the direction of the State Division of Youth and Family Services. The panel, for instance, can determine whether state officials are making enough improvements to the child welfare agency and can take the state back to court if enough progress is not being made. The settlement also called for more than $22 million to hire workers and provide better equipment and more than a million dollars to recruit foster parents.

Two studios in upstate New York, however, can provide the patient customer with hand-block-printed wallpaper produced with early-19th-century techniques. The American Paper-Staining Manufactory at the Farmers' Museum in Cooperstown can take up to a year to produce a new pattern. ''The process goes as slowly as your hands can go,'' said Wendy Weeks (right), the shop's supervisor and master printer. Adelphi Paper Hangings (above), a Virginia-based company whose studio is in Sharon Springs, N.Y., has two presses, but there is still a three-month wait. At both, the background paint is hand-brushed onto the paper, then the pattern colors are applied one at a time using a press and wooden blocks. For those who need a quicker fix, the Farmers' Museum sells paper-covered boxes ($20 to $50), and each studio has stock pattern papers (the Adena Pin Rings pattern, from Adelphi, left, is $425 a roll, 11 yards by 21 inches), which take about a third of the time to print. The Farmers' Museum is at (888) 547-1450. Adelphi is at (540) 253-5367. STEPHEN TREFFINGER",2003-09-04T05:00:00+0000

Joseph Krakora, a public defender who now represents Mr. Marshall, spent most of the day questioning Mr. Zeitz about his legal strategy at the trial and its subsequent death penalty phase. Mr. Marshall, 63, has so far submitted 22 arguments to state and federal courts challenging his conviction and death sentence. He has nearly exhausted all his appeals.

He was 79. Mr. Weir was born on February 2, 1924, in South Bend, IN, to David A. and Marie Broussard Weir. Mr. Weir was raised and resided in New Rochelle, NY, until moving to Albany in 1954, when he purchased with his partner, John R. Strachan, the Albany Pepsi-Cola Bottling company. Located in Menands, the company had 13 employees. Over the next five decades, it grew to be one of the largest privately held bottling companies in the United States, with 900 employees, covering the greater portions of New York, Massachusets, and Connecticut. In 1998, Mr. Weir and his partner sold the business to Pepsi-Co. Inc., the parent company, allowing him to continue to pursue his many cultural interests. In addition, Mr. Weir had a distinguished military service record. In 1942, at age 17, Mr. Weir joined the United States Navy to fight in World War II, serving until 1946. In his time in the Navy, Mr. Weir piloted landing craft on D-Day at Normandy, and also served on ammunition convoys in the Pacific theater. During this time, Mr. Weir earned the European African Middle Eastern Ribbon-1 Star, American Theater Ribbon, Asiatic Pacific Ribbon-1 Star, a Good conduct Medal, and a Victory Ribbon. Mr. Weir was a lifelong sailor and an avid collector of antiques and contemporary art. He was a benefactor of many community organizations, including the Albany Institute of History & Art, Albany Academy for Girls, and the Albany Medical Center. He was a member of the Fort Orange Club, the Saratoga Reading Room, and Schuyler Meadows Club. He will be sorely missed by his family and friends for his steadfast integrity, keen intellect, and unfailing humor. He is the beloved husband of Candace King Weir, his wife of 31 years, and loving father of their two daughters, Amelia and Katherine Weir. Mr. Weir is also survived by his son and daughter from a previous marriage, David Weir III of Miami, FL, and Janice Allen of Stowe, VT, and three grandchildren. In addition, he is survived by his sister Frances Marie Strachan. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated 10:30 AM, Tuesday, September 9, at The Historic Church of St. Mary, Lodge and Pine Streets, Albany. Relatives and friends are invited and may call Monday, from 6-8 PM, at the Tebbutt Funeral Home, 633 Central Avenue, Albany. Interment will be in St. Agnes Cemetery, Menands.

In FACE TO FACE WITH THE BOMB: Nuclear Reality After the Cold War (Johns Hopkins University, $34.95), 83 of his color images make the weapons as familiar as home appliances or toys. An airman sweeps up under 12 bombs that together contain six times the explosive power of all the munitions used in World War II. A mechanic worms himself into a missile's propulsion system. Some servicemen wrestle warheads onto mounts; others, men and women, squeezing what look like video game sticks, mind herds of missiles, each nesting many bombs. Minutemen missiles in silos gleam like metal sculptures; a giant CAT scan tube embraces one, probing its innards. It seems incredible that Shambroom was allowed to photograph these things, especially the warheads. The experience obviously terrified him, but his narrative and his endnotes about each picture testify that he has kept his wits and sharp sense of humor. D. J. R. Bruckner",2003-09-07T05:00:00+0000

us,'Journal of the Dead'," There's an old story people still tell their children in New Mexico. It took place in 1598, when the Spanish founders of Santa Fe were forced to cross the hostile Chihuahuan Desert. Stretching from central Mexico to just south of Albuquerque, the Chihuahuan nearly wiped out the two hundred colonists by sapping away their water. They wandered through the cacti and tumbleweeds half mad for a week, and were spared an excruciating death only by a fortuitous rain. Afterward, they came to call the most brutal part of the desert el Jornada del Muerto , ""the journey of the dead."" ",2003-09-07T05:00:00+0000

The Muslim fighters rushing to join the remnants of Saddam Hussein's loyalists in a guerrilla war to reclaim Iraq have understood all along what the war has been about -- that it was never simply a matter of preventing the use of weapons of mass destruction; rather, it was about consolidating American power in the Arab world.

Deputy chief counsel, administrative law division, office of The Judge Advocate General, age 42, died Thursday, September 4, 2003 after a brave battle with cancer, surrounded by his loving family. No words can carry the sweetness and strength of Rafe's character, the power and clarity of his mind, the truth and honesty of his life. Rafe was profoundly devoted to his family, to the military, and to his Jewish heritage, serving on the board of the Jewish congregation at Fort Belvoir, VA. He held himself to the highest standards, graduating first in his college class, attaining a full scholarship to law school, and earning the rank of colonel in May 2003. He had a wide-ranging and embracing intelligence, a direct and purposeful manner, and an unerring moral compass. Yet he retained his childhood sense of wonderment at the world and a deep belief in the goodness of mankind. Rafe was known by all for his clever and gleeful sense of humor, that at times he enjoyed more than anyone. And he measured the success of his stories and anecdotes by the laughter he inspired. Those who loved him are left with the joy and extraordinary privilege of having known him and with the unbearable sorrow of not having had more time. As his presence added so much to our lives, his absence leaves his family and friends a future that will never be as rich, an emptiness that can never be filled, hearts that can never mend and a world that is less kind and less special. Rafe loved and was beloved by his wife Ingela, his sons Jacob and Daniel, his parents Israel Howard and Estelle, his brother Michael and his sisters Stacy, Tamar, and Jody. Though he was with us a short time, he will be missed forever.",2003-09-07T05:00:00+0000

The movie starts out in New York, where Samuel L. Jackson is Trevor Garfield, a caring teacher viciously attacked by a student over a grade. When next we see Garfield it is many months later and on the opposite side of the country, but the California school where he again tries his hand at teaching is even more lawless than the New York one. Mr. Jackson, in a perfectly controlled performance, keeps implying that a Sidney Poitier feel-good moment is around the next bend, but there is only more grimness. When he tells a fellow teacher that the school is ''a world where chaos rules, not order, a world where righteousness is not rewarded,'' the hollowness in his voice is chilling; you know his switch has flipped.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. In it, Mr. McNamara, who is widely blamed for escalating the Vietnam War, sketches a history of how this country has justified its use of military force over the decades.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   BABSON, IRVING K.","BABSON--Irving K. 67, a well known trade publishing executive, passed from this earth on September 2, 2003. He was a resident of Turnberry Isle, Aventura (Miami, FL). Mr. Babson was the former Chairman of BMT Publications, Inc., New York, NY, a division of TSF Communications. He joined BMT in October, 1963, as an advertising sales executive, following a brief carrer in accounting with S. D. Leidersdorf. Mr. Babson flourished in sales and marketing, effectively marrying his background in finance and accounting with marketing and sales strategy. He rapidly advanced to Advertising Director of BMT and subsequently was named Associate Publisher of Ice Cream World, Co-Publisher of United States Tobacco Journal and Publisher of Radio and Television Weekly. In 1974, Mr. Babson became an equal stockholder with the two remaining company founders. Forseeing the growth of commerical gambling in the United States, he set his sights on the development of a publication specifically directed to this rapidly expanding segment of the economy. In 1979, Gaming Business magazine emerged as the first publication of its kind. As founding Publisher, Mr. Babson was active with state gaming commissions and legislatures, providing previously unavailable data on domestic and international commercial gaming, as well as on illegal gaming activities worldwide. Mr. Babson also served as Publisher of BMT's Convenience Store News, Smoke Shop Magazine, Electronic Distribution Weekly and a host of high tech trade show dailies, including IEEE, WESCON and others. During Mr. Babson's tenure, each of BMT's publications became the editorial and advertising leader in its respective industry. In December 1986, BMT was sold to publicly held Tribune/ Swab-Fox Companies, which named Mr. Babson a member of its Board of Directors. He retired in 1991, soon embarking on a second career in currency trading, founding Belize Equity, and, later, Holdsworth Investments. He also served on the Boards of a number of start up ventures. Mr. Babson was graduated from the Baruch School of Business, City College of New York (CCNY, now CUNY), in 1957. In the mid 1960s he participated in tobacco industry sponsored seminars conducted at the Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration. For many years, he was listed in Who's Who in America, Who's Who in Finance and Industry, and the International Directory of Distinguished Leadership. He was invited in the 1970s to become a Friar--a member of the prestigious Friars Club of New York. He was also a member of the National Association of Corporate Directors and a number of other professional organizations. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Laurie, and his parents, Matthew and Miriam Babson. Mr. Babson is survived by his three adult children, Stacey Babson Smith (Craig), Mia Babson Goldklang (Robert, M.D), and Christopher. He is survived by his four grandchildren, Remy and Justin (Stacey), and Matthew and Cole (Mia). Mr. Babson's many, many friends and loved ones are heartbroken at the loss of this truly extraordinary man who possessed a rare combination of outstanding intelligence, exceptionally creative business skills and an utterly bottomless heart. A burial service will be held Monday, September 8, at 10 AM, at the New Mt. Zion section of Hillside Cemetery in Lyndhurst, NJ. Donations may be made in memory of Irving K. Babson to the Gilda's Club of South Florida, 119 Rose Drive, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316.",2003-09-07T05:00:00+0000

The 12 were treated for hypothermia at Bellevue Hospital Center and New York University Downtown Hospital. The 28-foot pleasure boat was nearing Pier 17, at the South Street Seaport, about 4 a.m. when it collided with something, possibly the pier itself, said Timothy Donovan, deputy inspector. Water rushed into the boat's lavatory, which a woman was using at the time, and the boat quickly sank. The passengers, four of whom were clinging to an inflatable raft, were swept away. Within 25 minutes, the inspector said, the passengers and the captain had either been rescued by police officers throwing safety rings or, in a couple of cases, had swum to shore themselves. Investigators searched for the boat using ultrasound equipment but did not recover it. Shaila Dewan (NYT)",2003-09-08T05:00:00+0000

The arrest followed a four-month investigation, Mr. Goodness said, and the archdiocese immediately suspended Mr. Diamonte and began the process of firing him when it learned of his arrest.

us,BERLIN: SEX AND OPERA,"How does an opera house attract young audiences? In the case of the Komische Oper in Berlin, history provides an answer: with sex. The house will open its 2003-4 season on Friday with an operetta and a singles party. During intermission at ''The Gypsy Princess'' by Emmerich Kalman, operagoers can post flirtatious messages to the objects of their desire. The performance will be followed by a dating party in the lounge. In the early 20th century, when the Komische Opera was the Metropol Theater, it was both Berlin's leading house for operetta and a forum for the flirtatious that attracted visitors from all over Germany. Prostitutes seeking customers had only to pay half price for admission at intermission. Kevin Clarke, a spokesman for the Komische Oper and an organizer of Friday's festivities, said, ''We won't issue reduced tickets to prostitutes this time but will definitely provide our guests with a very erotic atmosphere.''

Delivering the annual Nancy Hanks Lecture on Arts and Public Policy to an audience of lawmakers at the Kennedy Center, Mr. Redford said: ''Government support for the arts is not the frivolous giveaway that some would have you believe.'' He added, ''It's a good investment, and it is sound economic development.'' Mr. Redford, who received the 1996 National Medal of Arts, said nonprofit arts were a $134-billion-a-year industry, employing millions and generating nearly $81 billion in spending and $24 billion in state, local and federal taxes. But, he declared, not only are state legislatures cutting arts programs, but the Bush administration has also recommended ''virtually no increase'' in federal arts grants and termination of financing of the arts-in-education program. While Americans cherish freedom, ''to be able to be part of a freedom of expression that allows us to tell stories of our choice in the uniqueness of our own voices as citizens and as artists is not to be taken lightly,'' Mr. Redford said, adding, ''To be able to freely voice dissent in our hearts or in our arts is something to protect at all costs.''

Mukasey of Federal District Court that Ms. Cheng was a major flight risk because of her access to vast financial resources and fake travel documents.

The judge said the council's board of directors failed to follow the proper procedures in voting to sell the six-story building, at 3 West 16th Street, to a developer for $5.4 million. Rabbi Israel Wohlgelernter said, ""Maybe they'll see the light, the light that Jewish law forbids selling a synagogue."" In her ruling, the judge also rejected the synagogue's claim that it, too, was an owner of the building. A lawyer for the umbrella group said it had not decided whether to appeal or to hold another board meeting to approve the sale. Daniel J. Wakin (NYT) ",2003-09-11T05:00:00+0000

The officer, Joseph Freeman, was arrested with several other officers in an investigation into fraudulent disability claims. A county employee videotaped Officer Freeman and the others as they were led away in handcuffs. The tape was later provided to the news media. Officer Freeman sued, accusing the county executive and the Correction Department of violating his right to privacy. A judge in Federal District Court ruled against him in 2001. On Tuesday, the United States Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling. ''The image of the accused being led away to contend with the justice system powerfully communicates government efforts to thwart the criminal element,'' Judge Fred I. Parker wrote.

On Tuesday, a ruling by a judge in State Supreme Court, Debra A. James, rejected the National Council's petition to sell its headquarters, which also houses the Young Israel of Fifth Avenue synagogue. The judge said the council's board of directors failed to follow the proper procedures in voting to sell the six-story building, at 3 West 16th Street, to a developer for $5.4 million. Rabbi Israel Wohlgelernter said, ''Maybe they'll see the light, the light that Jewish law forbids selling a synagogue.'' In her ruling, the judge also rejected the synagogue's claim that it, too, was an owner of the building.

His lawyer, Jeremiah Donovan, asked Judge Ellen Bree Burns to choose another jury for the trial, to start on Monday.

She attended college for two years, while seven of those selected have only high school educations, he said. One alternate is black.

A California resident, Eric Parke, sued the association, a trade group, on Tuesday because of its amnesty program, which it introduced on Monday and that it said would allow people to avoid legal action by stepping forward and forfeiting any illegally traded songs. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of California in Marin County, asserts that the program is a deceptive and fraudulent business practice designed to lure people ''to incriminate themselves and provide the R.I.A.A. and others with actionable admissions of wrongdoing under penalty of perjury.'' But the program provides ''no legally binding release of claims,'' according to the complaint. The association responded to the lawsuit with a maxim: ''No good deed goes unpunished, apparently.'' And added: ''It's also unfortunate that a lawyer would try to prevent others from getting the assurances they want that they will not be sued.''

Revenue in the quarter that ended on July 31 fell 17 percent, to $36.2 million from $43.5 million. The chief financial officer, Frank W. Tilley, said in an interview that Carreker would have a profitable year and positive cash flow. Though Carreker does not give more specific forecasts, he said the company's order backlog for the current quarter, which ends on Oct. 31, totaled $23.6 million at the end of August. Carreker has had to restate profit and sales results since fiscal 1998 because some revenue was recorded too early. Some customers delayed payments because of the restatement, depressing first-quarter revenue and causing a loss, Mr. Tilley said.

In the 19th century, however, intrepid painters like Thomas Cole and Frederick E. Church let out the secret that the Penobscot Bay's rocky pine-covered cliffs and mountains made for pretty spectacular scenery. In the 1880's, when steamships made Camden an easy trip from Boston, rich New Yorkers and Philadelphians known as ''rusticators'' discovered Penobscot Bay in their search for a more authentic immersion in nature than could be found in summer resorts like Lennox and Newport. Their descendants and successors still inhabit the islands of Vinalhaven, North Haven and Isleboro over the summer, sometimes sailing to Camden to pick up groceries or just the morning paper. Camden is no longer so undiscovered. Its merchants are now well aware that their town is picture-book Maine, and they hang ''Lobsta Festival'' and ''Maine Maple Syrup'' signs in their windows to tempt out-of-state eyes.

A jury at a state court in Hillsborough, N.C., found that consumers typically did not expect the cartridge in new printers to be the same as replacement cartridges they bought, said Richard McCune, a lawyer for the consumers. The North Carolina suit, certified as a class action, was the first to go to trial over this issue, and the jury verdict could affect the outcome of other pending cases, Mr. McCune said. Analysts and investors have said ink cartridges are the most profitable part of Hewlett-Packard's business as consumers often buy replacements. Hewlett-Packard began putting in half-filled cartridges in 1998 and told consumers only in 2001 after it was sued, he said. Class-action lawsuits have been filed, in coordination with the original consumers who brought suit, in 32 other states, the company said in a filing. Courts in 13 other states have found no basis for class-action suits on this matter, a Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman, Rebeca Robboy, said, adding that the company was confident that it would win ''copycat lawsuits'' in other states.",2003-09-12T05:00:00+0000

The legal case hinges on whether The Times can invoke the agreement's ''loss operations clause,'' which allows it to back out of the agreement after three consecutive years in the red.

us,First Love Illustrated,"At a time when the overused publishing term ''graphic novel'' most often refers either to ungainly superhero sagas or meandering, I-did-this-I-did-that Harvey Pekar rip-offs, Craig Thompson is correct to try to distinguish BLANKETS (Top Shelf, paper, $29.95) from its genre by calling it an ''illustrated novel.'' His forthright semiautobiographical tale follows a very young Craig, raised in a devout Christian family, through a romance with Raina, a ravishingly idealized first love. It is Raina who sews him a quilt, each square of which has emotional significance to her; it is Craig who questions the constraints of his faith when presented with her vulnerable, soul-bared love. Thompson's art -- black-and-white drawings of simple power, a technique of crosshatched realism that slips without melodrama into a vertiginous surrealism the deeper our hero falls for Raina -- possesses the artistic detail of a novel rendered in comic-book panels, omniscient-narrator description and word-balloon dialogue. Craig's blankets include not only Raina's gift but also the snug Michigan and Wisconsin snow that covers his contained patch of earth. In telling his story, which includes beautifully rendered memories of the small brutalities that parents inflict upon their children and siblings upon each other, Thompson describes the ecstasy and ache of obsession (with a lover, with God) and is unafraid to suggest the ways that obsession can consume itself and evaporate.

But in the Muslim Middle East, where religious terminology permeates the culture, it seems as if almost everyone is a martyr. Realizing this is a small but crucial step in understanding a major cultural gap between the West and the Muslim Middle East, a gap that becomes more obvious with every audiotape supposedly from Osama bin Laden.",2003-09-14T05:00:00+0000

Born in Texas, on September 22, 1940, she attended school in Temple and resided in San Antonio for many years where she married (the late) Bobby Sheerin. She was a self-described spiritualist and kept an open mind, eager to explore everything new. As an avid traveler and true adventuress, her vast and varied interests led her to the far corners of this world and most especially to antiquity's sacred and mystical sites. At home, she was an inveterate volunteer and philanthropist closely associated with the Cancer Therapy and Research Center, the Cancer Center Cabinet, the Winston School of San Antonio, the Rock Art Foundation, the Mind Science Foundation and a diverse mix of other notfor-profit organizations. She also served as a director of local business enterprises and operated her own business, ''Magties.'' Her contributions to her community were recognized with a number of prestigious awards, and she found immense joy in the simple pleasures of photography, reading, collecting, live theater, fine art, entertaining, playing Backgammon, Bridge and Canasta, meeting new people and forming new friendships. The regret of those she leaves behind is tempered by the wonderment of her adventure. They include son and daughter-in-law Jack and Traci Sheerin, son Jimmy Sheerin, daughter and son-in-law Cynthia and Andy Berry, granddaughter Ellie Berry, cousins Nancy Bitting and her daughter Lesley, soulmate Paul Rossbach, devoted helpmates Virginia Lopez and Vivian Little, her Temple High School classmates, many, many more friends in many parts of the world and a large contingent of true admirers.

us,The Calvinist Ethic,"Last October, Frances Stein ran into her old friend and boss Calvin Klein in Paris. It had been years since she had seen the designer, who was in the process of selling his company to Phillips-Van Heusen. The next day, they went to see the ''Matisse Picasso'' exhibit at the Grand Palais and afterward went to lunch at a cafe that Stein knew on the Rue de Verneuil. A woman of mercurial chic, who has spent the last 22 years designing accessories for Chanel, Stein first met Klein in the early 1970's when she was an editor at Vogue under Diana Vreeland. Almost a decade earlier, Vreeland, with her usual farsightedness, pushed Stein toward Halston, then a milliner at Bergdorf Goodman. ''Get to know him,'' she said. And Stein did, becoming part of one of fashion's most glamorous circles. Surrounded by his court of Halstonettes, and catering to a new breed of socialite who hung out with rock stars and Pop artists, Halston cultivated an air of superiority that set him apart from the rag-trade ethos of Seventh Avenue, where Klein started out in 1968 as a coat designer. Though friendly with Klein, Halston was privately dismissive of the younger man's talent, once saying, ''I wouldn't know a Calvin Klein from a load of coal.''",2003-09-14T05:00:00+0000

Built and run mainly by Americans, the packet lines introduced new concepts and comfort levels for ocean voyages. They dominated the transatlantic traffic for decades, setting key precedents for the steamships that eventually replaced them. Along with their more famous contemporaries, the whaling and clipper ships, they comprised the golden age of American sail. Of these three types, the packets lasted the longest and made the most voyages and money for their owners and crews. Yet today whalers and clippers remain drenched in popular legend, while the packets are scarcely known beyond dedicated circles of ship buffs. No packet builder ever became as famous as Donald McKay with his clippers, and no novelist ever wrote a Moby Dick about the packets. They just did their jobs quietly and well, year after year, and then passed into the historical obscurity reserved for predictable competence. ",2003-09-14T05:00:00+0000

Sprung from the mind of Marie Antoinette after her death, this novel takes a soul's-eye view of the queen's life from her marriage at 14 to Louis XVI to her rendezvous with the guillotine. Unbounded by walls or flesh, she wanders the gardens and rooms of Versailles, listening to conversations at which she wasn't present and bearing witness. The book is ''rapturous, like an aria,'' Stacey D'Erasmo wrote here in 2002. The queen is ''very much alive here, and she's magnificent.'' The same publisher has reissued two of Davis's earlier novels. Hell ($13.95)is a mlange of meditations, voices, scenes, sermons and proverbs that cross-cuts between two households: that of a troubled family in 1950's Philadelphia, and the residence of a 19th-century expert on domestic management. In 1998 in these pages, Nancy Willard admired the tale's ''intelligence and verbal brio.'' The Girl Who Trod on a Loaf ($14.95) tells of the friendship between a Juilliard-trained waitress and an elderly Danish composer, who on her death leaves her friend an unfinished opera based on a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale. In 1993 our reviewer, Maggie Paley, found this philosophical novel ''heated, dramatic'' and ''grand in its ambition.''",2003-09-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Arbus Reconsidered,"'Giving a camera to Diane Arbus is like giving a hand grenade to a baby,'' Norman Mailer said after seeing how she had captured him, leaning back in a velvet armchair with his legs splayed cockily. The quip was funny, but a little off base. A camera for Arbus was like a latchkey. With one around her neck, she could open almost any door. Fearless, tenacious, vulnerable -- the combination conquered resistance. In an eye-opening sequence in ''Revelations,'' the compendious new book that is being published in tandem with a full-scale retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, you discover with a start the behind-the-scenes drama that produced her famous photograph of ''A Naked Man Being a Woman.'' As her title indicates, it is a portrait of a young man standing naked in his apartment, genitals tucked out of sight, in a Venus-on-the-half-shell pose. First she photographed him as a bouffant-haired young matron on a park bench; then at home in a bra and half slip; unwigged and unclothed a few moments later, with legs demurely crossed; up posing for the prized shot; and finally, as a seemingly ordinary fellow back on a park bench. Somehow, she had persuaded him to take her home and expose a secret life. It's what she did again and again. ''She got herself to go up to people on the street and ask if she could photograph them,'' recalls her former husband, Allan Arbus. ''One thing she often said was, 'I'm just practicing.''' He chuckles. ''And indeed, I guess she was.''",2003-09-14T05:00:00+0000

I.B.M. sold ''tens of thousands'' of the drives, the suit claims. Problems with the drives drew widespread complaints on Internet message boards, where customers refer to the drives as ''Deathstar.''

Lewis Weiner followed Kurt Wehle, Hugh Colman, and Ludovic Sturc as President of the Society. He brought his vast energies, broad vision and total dedication to the Society in the 1980s and early 1990s, supervising the publication in 1984 of the most challenging volume in the Society's trilogy, ''The Jews of Czechoslovakia,'' dealing with the Holocaust, as well as six annual reviews in the subsequent years, ably assisted by Gertrude Hirschler.

Dr. LoGerfo was a world-renowned leader in the field of thyroid and parathyroid surgery, a superb teacher, and a genuinely loving friend. He developed the thyroglobulin assay, one of the most commonly used methods for detecting recurrent thyroid cancer, and was a pioneer in the field of thyroid and parathyroid surgery by developing a technique using local anesthesia for most of these procedures. He also established the New York Thyroid Center, a comprehensive center dedicated to providing superior medical care and education for patients with thyroid disease, and implemented surgical registries which are invaluable resources for outcomes research. Three years ago, Dr. LoGerfo collaborated on ''The Thyroid Guide'', a comprehensive book intended to empower patients through education about their thyroid condition so they could play an active role in their own treatment decisions. Dr. LoGerfo was an extremely kind and generous person who was beloved by his patients and colleagues, and by scores of students who knew him as both mentor and friend.

The judge, George Greer, also turned down a request that the woman, Terri Schiavo, 39, be given therapy to learn how to eat without the tube, after doctors testified that she could not be rehabilitated.

us,Technology Briefing | Internet: Search Service From I.B.M.,"I.B.M. is introducing a service today that combines World Wide Web searching with text analysis and database queries. The service, called WebFountain, represents the combined effort of 300 I.B.M. scientists, who have collected more than 100 patents on this research since it began in the late 1990's. The project is collecting and indexing 25 million Web pages a day, about 4 billion pages this year, half of them stored in I.B.M. databases. Those not stored include Web pages not likely to be relevant to I.B.M.'s business customers, like the 30 percent of all Web pages that feature pornography. Robert Carlson, a vice president in the company's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., said the technology goes well beyond the text searches and popularity ranking of Google. He said it could analyze billions of Web pages instead of the millions of pages that services like Biz360 and Intelliseek do. The I.B.M. service will also search and analyze commercial information services. I.B.M. is to announce a partnership today with Factiva, a company backed by Dow Jones and Reuters.

Governors and state officials have asserted that millions of dollars are lost in taxes every year because of the ban, which is set to expire on Nov. 1.

The Senate Commerce Committee approved a similar bill in July; the full chamber is expected to take up the matter before November. Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Treasury Secretary John W.

''People stopped talking every 20 minutes when the train went by,'' Donna Robertson, dean of the institute's College of Architecture, said.

Outdoors, decibels dropped from 120 (between loud rock music and a pneumatic drill) to under 80 decibels. Inside the building, the noise is now below 70 decibels, or about the level of a noisy restaurant. The acoustic tube is open at the top, sending the sound upward.

A two-bedroom 1,500-square-foot apartment at Fifth Avenue and 68th Street is $2.4 million. Without a view, it would be $1.5 million. What does a comparable view cost elsewhere? In San Francisco, said Patrick Barber, of Sotheby's International Realty there, an apartment in Pacific Heights with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the bay is worth $1.3 to $1.5 million; $800,000 without a view. In Santa Monica, an apartment facing the ocean costs $1 million. One facing the mountains, said Helmut Lerpscher, of Coldwell Banker, is $700,000 to $800,000. Buyers pay $200,000 more to be in the Turtle Creek-Uptown neighborhood of Dallas with a view of downtown, on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago facing Lake Michigan and on the oceanfront in Miami Beach.

He also served as co-director of the New York Thyroid Center and chief of surgical specialties at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Recognized as one of the world's leading thyroid and parathyroid surgeons, Dr. LoGerfo began his medical career at Columbia University after attending Upstate Medical College where he graduated Alpha Omega Alpha in 1967. Early in his career he developed the thyroglobulin assay, which remains one of the most commonly used methods for detecting recurrent thyroid cancer. In the late 1980's, he pioneered a new technique in the field of thyroid and parathyroid surgery by using local anesthesia on an outpatient basis. His commitment to research won him the recognition of the NIH with the NIH Investigator Award in Cancer Immunology. In addition to his active clinical practice and research laboratory, Dr. LoGerfo was an artist whose sculptures appeared in several galleries around the US.

Pasadena's former role as a winter retreat for the wealthy (and the tubercular) can be seen in architectural wonders like the fantastical Green Hotel; the impressive United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, once the Vista del Arroyo Hotel, built in 1903; plus countless charming Craftsman bungalows and bungalow courts -- not to mention the apex of Arts and Crafts optimism and beauty, the Gamble House.

But one aspect of secondary education hardly anyone is in danger of revisiting is the reading list. This month, teenagers across the nation, under the orders of their teachers, crack open books that will offer them their first taste of serious critical reading, of puzzling out an author's theme and hunting the wily symbol. They might read ''Frankenstein'' or ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' and they will almost certainly be assigned ''The Great Gatsby'' -- those works they're likely to return to as adults. But they will also ponder novels they'll never forget but also never re-read, a category you could call the classroom classic; it's the kind of book that never seems to shake off that fine layer of chalk dust.",2003-09-21T05:00:00+0000

That hot June my ten-year-old brother, Michael, and I were living with friends of my parents, Ben and Sonia Bach, in Toms River, New Jersey. I was a thin, dark-haired, olive-skinned child of average height. My face tapered from a high forehead to a somewhat pointed chin. I'm told my most striking feature was brown eyes that were so deep set they often appeared ringed like a raccoon's. I was finishing my kindergarten year at Toms River Elementary School. That summer I played a lot of ball with my brother and several older neighborhood kids in the Bachs' front yard. I was fairly well coordinated: quick with my hands but not particularly nimble on my feet. Better at athletics than most but always not as good as some. It helped having a big brother who looked out for me. ",2003-09-21T05:00:00+0000

Photographs of such places are gravestones,'' John Huddleston, a professor of art at Middlebury College, writes in KILLING GROUND: Photographs of the Civil War and the Changing American Landscape (Johns Hopkins University, $35). He has paired archival images of the first modern war with his own, contemporary color shots of the same locations, at the same time of year, at the same time of day. Some sites of suicidal charges have become Kmarts, mini-malls or swamps strewn with metal and plastic trash. The juxtapositions possess surprising power. In an overexposed and damaged archival shot of the Confederate prisoner of war camp at Andersonville, Ga., a filthy crowd of anonymous men packs the frame, while on the facing page Huddleston presents his own fine-tuned image of a muted, borderless sky. For an instant the viewer vaults beyond history and aesthetics to a visceral understanding of what it meant to be a prisoner of war. ''Are physical and spiritual traces of the great slaughter still present in these places?,'' Huddleston asks. The answer is ''Yes.'' Frederick Kaufman",2003-09-21T05:00:00+0000

Yeats was keen on dancers, and the book has a chapter called 'The Dancer', which is partly about the excited response of some fin de siecle poets - English and French, and notably, Mallarme - to dancers, actual, historical and mythical. The object of their admiration might be Salome, the most fascinating of them all, but they could also worship the music-hall dancers of the moment, lavishly courted by poets and reviewers both as performers and as exotically strange women. Dowson and Symons, friends of Yeats, haunted the stage doors. The mysteriously neurotic Jane Avril, familiar from the posters of Toulouse-Lautrec, was one famous name, and there were a good many others, not least among them Loie Fuller, in whom Yeats seems to have had a particular interest.

In addition to reissues of ''Family Christmas'' and his thematic Sun album ''All Aboard the Blue Train,'' there's a new CD, videotape and DVD of ''A Concert: Behind Prison Walls'' (Eagle Vision), a 1976 various-artists performance from Tennessee State Penitentiary. Musically and historically, the concert is a footnote, though it's worth seeing what a prison-performing pro Mr. Cash was at that point, placing his material firmly in lock-step with the world of the inmates (as opposed to Linda Ronstadt, who sings an ill-advised ''You're No Good'' to them). Of much more interest and importance is ''Live Recordings From the Louisiana Hayride'' (Scena), which includes some of the same songs but was recorded when they were current (as early as 1955), and in some cases, before they were hits.",2003-09-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Children's Books; Lonely Guys,"When someone says ''tanuki,'' how do you respond? ''You're welcome''? ''I don't dance''? ''Gesundheit''? The real tanuki is a small Japanese mammal, something between a badger and a raccoon. Traditionally thought to be able to assume human form, it is reportedly fond of practical jokes and trouble-making. The tanuki in Tim Myers's story TANUKI'S GIFT: A Japanese Tale (Marshall Cavendish, $16.95; ages 5 to 8), illustrated by R. G. Roth, is cut from a different cloth. One icy night, it calls at the hut of a Buddhist priest, begging shelter. Disregarding the creature's reputation for mischief, the lonely priest offers his hospitality. For years they winter together. Eventually, the tanuki asks what it can do in recompense, and the priest reluctantly admits that three gold coins would buy prayers for his soul to enter Paradise. The tanuki takes its leave. The priest waits and waits, but by the time the tanuki returns, he no longer wants the gold, having learned instead a valuable lesson about friendship. The tale is adroitly told, but the real highlights are Richard Roth's mixed-media collages, a playground of cross-cultural references and Japanese influences from ink painting to paper decoration. The rounded priest in rainbow robes contrasts appealingly with the lithe, scratchy tanuki in black and white. A complement of objects both familiar and mysterious adorns the well-textured settings, and a great sense of whimsy pervades all: watch the tanuki juggle, capering like a river otter; see the priest imagine himself ascending to heaven, wearing a halo and carried by an umbrella, like Mary Poppins. Myers, whose two previous books are set in Japan and Hawaii, notes that he's more interested in telling a story than in elaborating a cultural tradition, and this story is more about universal values of friendship than about either Buddhism or the tanuki. More important, it is lovely and entertaining, and the tanuki, rarely known for repaying generosity in kind, certainly couldn't ask for a better ambassador. Bruno Navasky",2003-09-21T05:00:00+0000

My landlord claims that all the money to be collected over seven years becomes immediately due on the moveout date. If the money is due, can the claimed amount be deducted from the security deposit? Can the claimed amount be collected if the major capital improvement increase is under appeal? . . . Stephen Kampmeier, Wood Ridge, N.J.",2003-09-21T05:00:00+0000

Epic in spirit, scope and structure, this exuberant novel turns on the remarkable identity crisis of its Greek-American narrator, Calliope Stephanides, who discovers at the age of 14 that she is a hermaphrodite. How that gene found its home is traced through three generations, from immigrants who escape the Turkish massacre of Greeks in Smyrna in 1922 to their children and grandchildren, who end up in Detroit. Among many other things, the tale, which was chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2002, explores the tug of war between destiny and free will.

Accompanying Adam were some of his friends from the parish, perhaps including members of the prominent Lavenham families, the Springs, the Risbys, and the Ponders. Jane Burton Winthrop, young Adam's mother, was left lying in at home, denied entry into the holy precincts of the church until she was purified in a rite that usually came about a month after the childbirth.

I had been in New York a year, and even though I worked until five, five in the morning, still I couldn't close my eyes. I had the urgent sense something was happening, something important, the very reason I had come here in the first place.

Active in both government and publishing, Dr. Christman served in the administrations of Mayor John Lindsay as Director of the City Record, under Governor Hugh Carey as a Member of the Worker's Compensation Board, as well as serving under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. His most notable governmental achievement was the work done for the Worker's Compensation Board from 1977 to 1984. During that time, he adjudicated approximately 25,000 cases on appeal and jointly administered about $1 billion annually in insurance benefits. Among the many books he edited and wrote introductions for are ''The South as it Is 1865-1866,'' a collection of articles by John R. Dennett that first appeared in The Nation, published by Viking Press 1965, and more than several other works: ''The Public Papers of Chief Justice Earl Warren,'' Simon and Schuster, 1959, ''Walter Reuther--Selected Papers,'' The Macmillan Company, 1961, ''This is Our Strength-The Selected Papers of Golda Meir,'' The Macmillan Company, 1962; ''Walt Whitman's New York,'' The Macmillan Company, 1963, and for the New American Library, 1966, ''The American Journalism of Marx and Engels.'' Some of these titles are still available from other publishers. He continued to publish until not long before his death. For all the heft of his other works, probably his most widely read book was ''Mahout,'' an original fable that received not only international attention, but an award from an organization of Christians and Jews for its celebration of the triumph of good over evil. He is survived by his companion of 48 years, Abraham Feldman.

The announcement followed the breakdown of talks between Warner Music and BMG last week and comes after the two let an exclusivity agreement lapse. People close to EMI said it could be months before anything concrete was accomplished. Foremost in the mind of EMI and Warner advisers is structuring a deal that will be approved by regulators, these people said. Opposition from European regulators derailed proposed combinations between EMI and Warner and between EMI and BMG in the last few years. EMI's offer is expected to value the Warner unit at about $1.5 billion, and give AOL two seats on its board. EMI was cautious in its statement: ''Discussions are at a very preliminary stage and there is no assurance that they will result in an agreement acceptable to both parties.''

In a motion filed on Monday, the groups -- the New Jersey Animal Rights Alliance and the Bear Group -- asked a state appeals court to overturn the State Fish and Game Council's approval of the hunt. A lawyer for the groups, William Strazza, argued that the hunt, scheduled to begin on Dec. 8, was unjustified because it was not based on a valid count of the bear population and would threaten the safety of hikers and others. Martin J. McHugh, director of the state's division of fish and wildlife, disagreed, calling the six-day hunt a ''conservative'' one.

This year, Mr. Murphy's 2001 conviction was overturned by an appeals court after he had served a year of a 43-month sentence. The appeals panel found that the trial judge had erroneously allowed the jury to view Mr. Murphy, a political party official, as having the same responsibility of fairness and trustworthiness as an elected official. Mr. Murphy was ordered freed pending the retrial, and the prosecutors were directed to use other theories of culpability. Ronald Smothers (NYT)",2003-09-24T05:00:00+0000

''Molly'' came to the U.S. from Croydon, England, in 1936 when her work on the coronation of Edward VI was curtailed by his abdication. At the outbreak of war, she joined the WREN's (U.K. Navy), working in Boston, Washington and New York. In 1946 she joined the original staff of the U.N. ''The Mohigans'', in the transportation department. At the U.N., she met her husband, Joseph W. MacCabe, who, after working in Palestine in 1947 and 1948, went on to a career as a UNDP staff member. She left the U.N. in 1951 to be mother to her only son, Alistair, and the family moved to Connecticut. Always engaged, in 1965 she launched a new career in real estate and promptly opened her own firm as one of the first successful women-owned businesses. After 25 years and many accomplishments, she sold the business. Widowed in 1992, her final years were spent pursuing her lifelong passion for photography, photos taken all over the world, and winning numerous amateur awards.

They and other ''international villages'' -- small housing developments -- were planned by George Merrick, the founder of Coral Gables, to offer architectural diversity in the otherwise Spanish Mediterranean-style town. When William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic nominee for president, was hired to promote the brand-new town in the early 1920's, he proclaimed, ''You can wake up in the morning and tell the biggest lie you can think of about the future of Coral Gables, and before you go to bed at night you will be ashamed of your modesty.'' The latest residents to buy into the undeniable charisma of the place are members of the affluent YUCA population, the local acronym for Young Urban Cuban Americans, who have helped to create the economic miracle referred to in the name Miracle Mile, a centrally located shopping street. Coral Gables today retains some of the most striking architectural and natural sights in Miami-Dade County, but it also has some of its most luxurious hotels and shops, and, many food critics agree, better restaurants than South Beach. It all adds up to a super, if relatively sedate, tropical trip. PAMELA ROBIN BRANDT",2003-09-26T05:00:00+0000

Like President Bush, we believed that Saddam Hussein was hiding potentially large quantities of chemical and biological weapons and aggressively pursuing nuclear arms. Like the president, we thought those weapons posed a grave danger to the United States and the rest of the world. Now it appears that premise was wrong. We cannot in hindsight blame the administration for its original conclusions. They were based on the best intelligence available, which had led the Clinton administration before it and the governments of allied nations to reach the same conclusion. But even the best intelligence can turn out to be mistaken, and the likelihood that this was the case in Iraq shows why pre-emptive war, the Bush administration's strategy since 9/11, is so ill conceived as a foundation for security policy. If intelligence and risk assessment are sketchy -- and when are they not? -- using them as the basis for pre-emptive war poses enormous dangers.",2003-09-26T05:00:00+0000

Such ''tracking'' would have been limited to math classes, where students would still be sorted by elementary-school grades and test scores. For all other core subjects, students -- save extreme underachievers, who would get special help -- would have been randomly assigned to classes and given common curriculums and instruction.

us,Where I Was From," My great-great-great-great-great-grandmother Elizabeth Scott was born in 1766, grew up on the Virginia and Carolina frontiers, at age sixteen married an eighteen-year-old veteran of the Revolution and the Cherokee expeditions named Benjamin Hardin IV, moved with him into Tennessee and Kentucky and died on still another frontier, the Oil Trough Bottom on the south bank of the White River in what is now Arkansas but was then Missouri Territory. Elizabeth Scott Hardin was remembered to have hidden in a cave with her children (there were said to have been eleven, only eight of which got recorded) during Indian fighting, and to have been so strong a swimmer that she could ford a river in flood with an infant in her arms. Either in her defense or for reasons of his own, her husband was said to have killed, not counting English soldiers or Cherokees, ten men. This may be true or it may be, in a local oral tradition inclined to stories that turn on decisive gestures, embroidery. I have it on the word of a cousin who researched the matter that the husband, our great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, ""appears in the standard printed histories of Arkansas as 'Old Colonel Ben Hardin, the hero of so many Indian wars.'"" Elizabeth Scott Hardin had bright blue eyes and sick headaches. The White River on which she lived was the same White River on which, a century and a half later, James McDougal would locate his failed Whitewater development.

I could see him winning a talent contest at a local pub, being written up in the local paper and taken for the first time to London by a sharkish manager. But this is 2003, so his act could just as easily be a finely calibrated irony. Actually, it's a bit of both. His aunt has a pub in East Anglia; he sang Queen's ''Bohemian Rhapsody'' with the rest of the band one night and ended up a member. On the other hand, according to a report last month in Campaign, a British trade magazine for the advertising industry, he wrote commercial jingles until he joined the band three years ago. In any case, the band's first album, ''Permission to Land'' (Atlantic), seems a high-water mark in how confusing it is to know whether to take rock seriously anymore, even when it's good.",2003-09-28T05:00:00+0000

When Norwegian Cruise Line's Pride of America, with a capacity of 2,146, enters service in May, it will be the first new American-flag ship in almost 50 years. VERNON KIDD",2003-09-28T05:00:00+0000

It tells of the enthusiasm for Shakespeare that flooded his mind as a result of that encounter and of his rapturous longing for a world he could touch through Shakespeare, that of the Italian Renaissance.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Grown Men Crying,"In two of his last four novels, John Grisham has abandoned the tropes of the legal thriller to try his hand at a social-realist bildungsroman (''A Painted House'') and a satire of yuletide hype (''Skipping Christmas''). His new novel, BLEACHERS (Doubleday, $19.95), finds him venturing into Pat Conroy territory, where youthful hero worship and idealized manliness collide with adult disillusionment. Neely Crenshaw was once the star quarterback of the Messina Spartans, a high school football team in a small Southern town that deifies its players and coaches. A college injury exiled Neely to life's sidelines, where he wandered aimlessly before accepting the unheroic role of a divorced real-estate agent in Orlando. What brings Neely back to his hometown is the terminal illness of Eddie Rake, the legendary Spartans coach whose win-loss record ''almost anyone on the streets of Messina could rattle off from memory.'' As they keep vigil in the bleachers, Neely and an intergenerational assortment of former Spartans must reconcile their memories of Rake as both a monster and a best friend -- a coach who gleefully drove them into the ground but was always there to lift them up when they truly needed help. This is a book designed to make a certain type of grown man cry, and the author knows exactly which buttons to push: dying father figures, the scars of tough love, middle-aged regret and the mythology of the gridiron. What saves the story from melodrama is Grisham's refusal to offer pat resolutions; he allows his ambivalent characters to remain so. It also helps that he's a sure-footed storyteller with an undeniable mastery of plotting, pacing and tone. Jeff Turrentine",2003-09-28T05:00:00+0000

Over seven years earlier, Michael was diagnosed with brain cancer. Through a powerful intellect and sheer perseverance, reinforced by the loyalty of his family and friends, Michael battled his disease much longer than the doctors predicted. Michael was born to Harold and Fritz Johnson on August 20, 1952. The Johnson household was a loving and nourishing environment that with the addition of his younger sister Barbara, prized intellectual excellence and high competitiveness, both of which Michael put to good use, winning one chess tournament after another. While attending Menlo College, Michael excelled in computer programming. Together with his future business partner Mark Mahan, they had their first commercial success, computerizing the school's grading & admission systems. Following graduation, Michael worked for Data General, and then went on with his partners to start Redmond-based MAJIQ, Inc, which became a major supplier of computer systems for the Pulp and Paper industry. Michael's subsequent success in the business world came through a winning combination of his computer talents, his phenomenal tenacity, and his unusual people and communication skills. And hard work: Day after day, month after month, he traveled from one paper mill to another, winning contract after contract-and making countless friends along the way. In 1990, Inc. Magazine listed MAJIQ as one of the fastest growing private companies in America. At his fiftieth birthday party, a competitor paid tribute to his success and to the man, stating they ''couldn't lose out to a nicer guy''. As MAJIQ went international, Michael garnered recognition from his industry and served as Affiliate Chairman of the PIMA Information Systems Specialist Group. Mike was fortunate in his family life. In 1990 he married Irene (nee Ankudinova) and became a second father and a loving mentor to her daughter Sasha. The warmth of his family helped Michael in his ordeal. Irene was at her husband's side every step of the way and, along with his mother and sister, was at his bedside when he died. Michael Johnson set forth examples for his survivors to live by. He was caring and generous. He attacked life with a steadfast will and quiet confidence to get what he wanted and to share it with those he loved. He laughed. He made others laugh. And, during his illness, he never once felt sorry for himself, or asked ''why me?'' He simply kept looking for solutions with grace and dignity. He was overcome, but he never quit. Michael was preceded in death by his father Harold. He is survived by Irene, Sasha, his mother Fritz, sister Barbara, nephews Cody and Collin, mother in-law Inna, caregiver and friend William Houston, life-long friends and his legacy which will live in the hearts of those who knew him best.",2003-09-28T05:00:00+0000
