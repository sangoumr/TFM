Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. ALO ALO, #1030 Third Avenue, at 61st Street (838-4343) - **(June 21, 1985) The whimsical dining room is in grand cafe style at this colorful and convivial East Side restaurant, and the glass fishbowl effect creates a glittery urban night. The food is as uplifting as the setting and the menu offers options conducive to late-night dining. You might try the grilled vegetable platter; pastas - from spaghetti with tuna and spinach to large shells with Bolognese sauce, mushrooms and rosemary; broiled red snapper with fennel oil and asparagus, or poached Canadian duck breast with Arborio rice. Main dishes $10.50 to $19.50. Fridays to Sundays, 11:45 A.M. to 11:45 P.M. CAFE LUXEMBOURG, #200 West 70th Street (873-7411) - **(May 9, 1986) Just a few blocks north of Lincoln Center is this stylish and serious restaurant with a gleaming zinc bar up front and a sleek tiled dining room with Parisian cafe chairs and red banquettes. The kitchen features essentially American food; and after theater, you might choose crab cakes sauteed with tomato coulis and pesto sauce or smoked salmon and vegetable salad with green beans, asparagus and baby carrots with sherry vinaigrette. Entree selections include grilled warm breast of chicken salad with sweet pepper julienne; steak frites, and grilled tuna with a light aioli sauce and roasted red peppers, fennel, zucchini and eggplant. Entrees $15 to $28. Fridays and Saturdays, 5:30 P.M. to 1:30 A.M.; Sundays, 11 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. and 6 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. CAFE UN DEUX TROIS, #123 West 44th Street (354-4148) - *(May 15, 1987) One of the better bets for Broadway theater-district dining is this big, bustling brasserie with faux marble columns and mustard-colored walls that look as if they're peeling and a generally seedy-by-design look. The short regular menu is supplemented by daily specials, and appetizers include duck liver mousse; chicken and veal sausage, and beef sate, tender strips of beef with a brassy peanut sauce. For a main dish, you might order breaded chicken breast in mustard sauce; mixed grill with calf's liver, boudin blanc and lamb chop, or grilled steak. Dinner entrees $7.50 to $18.50. Fridays, noon to 4 P.M. and 4:30 P.M. to midnight; Saturdays, 10:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. and 5 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. and 5 to 11 P.M.

The first of these Frances Rebeccas, known as Jinx, is a young hotel executive obsessed with the idea of finding her father, Ben Rostov, who abandoned her and her mother when she was a baby. Although her mother pretends that Ben is dead, Jinx discovers he is still alive and is determined to make him acknowledge her. Violently opposed to her plan is Becca, daughter of Ben's second marriage, a competitive socialite who also learns of the past her father has kept secret and resents sharing his love with a half sister. Frankie is plagued with familial problems as well. Her mother, Ben's sister, is a conniving former movie star who takes over Frankie's career as a model and actress with a ruthlessness that makes ''Mommie Dearest'' seem like a primer for maternal devotion. Finally, Cissie, another of Ben's nieces and a big-time boutique manager, suffers from spousal rather than parental neglect. Her husband is a once-idealistic politician whose romantic escapades recall recent headlines. The story follows the women for almost two decades, through accidents, affairs and even a murder plot. Though the result is hardly literary - neither Ms. Mortman nor her editor appears to know the difference between ''compliment'' and ''complement'' or ''peak'' and ''pique'' - the book provides some airy weekend amusement.",1987-10-04T05:00:00+0000

Afterward, shivering over tea in the refuge of a snug little hotel, I looked around the dining room, all shining mahogany, and felt myself a desolate stranger. I was traveling alone. The hotel had once been a way station for missionaries heading for foreign parts; no New Yorker, I thought, could be at ease in such a place. I was banished, lost. I ached with forlornness. The people in the dining room seemed enviably at home. They shuffled their newspapers and hardly spoke, and when they did, the alien syllables shut me decisively out.",1987-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"HOME GROUND, by Lynn Freed. (Penguin, $7.95.) By casting Ruth Frank, the narrator of this novel of South Africa, as a member of a family of theater people, the author provides ''a potent metaphor'' for the stage-managed world of apartheid, Janette Turner Hospital said here last year. ''What is extraordinary about this book is its perspective. . . . Lynn Freed's guileless child-narrator takes us inside the neurosis'' of the country. THE WELL-TEMPERED ANGLER, by Arnold Gingrich. Illustrated by John Groth. (Plume/New American Library, $8.95.) The arts of editing and fly-fishing have much in common: they require a passion for precision, a patience for detail and an appreciation for solitude. It's not surprising, then, that a literature of fishing has emerged, which includes Izaak Walton's ''Compleat Angler'' (1653) and, more recently, Norman Maclean's novella ''A River Runs Through It.'' When Arnold Gingrich, who was the publisher of Esquire and one of its most talented editors, contributed to the genre in 1965, his book was praised by one reviewer as ''a joy and a delight.'' The prose is written with a ''disarming simplicity and artless ease that plainly shows . . . how long and lovingly the man must have toiled over it.'' GROUP SEX: A Romantic Comedy, by Ann Arensberg. (Washington Square Press/Pocket Books, $5.95.) Some editors, particularly those like Frances Girard who work at small publishing houses, might argue that the job requires a tolerance for abuse that borders on masochism. Frances, who is abused by her authors, her colleagues and her landlady, seeks transcendence through an affair with a mad director of avant-garde plays, who ends up abusing her. Last year Tama Janowitz said here that the plot of the novel irked her but the book ''rings true.'' The author ''has a talent for entertainment and wit.'' The same publisher has reissued Ann Arensberg's first novel, SISTER WOLF ($5.95), the story of a woman who loves animals more than people and lives alone on her own private wildlife sanctuary in the Berkshires. In 1981, The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt called the book ''highly original, extravagantly romantic, intensely imagined. . . . [ It ] leaves a deep impression on one's memory.'' THE GREAT CHINESE REVOLUTION: 1800-1985, by John King Fairbank. (Bessie/Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.50.) Having long established his credentials as a Sinologist, John King Fairbank decided that as ''an ex-professor who is not up for tenure, and who doesn't care about reputation,'' he was entitled to engage in ''a bit of irresponsibility.'' Abandoning footnotes and other academic accouterments, Mr. Fairbank draws bold, sweeping parallels between the China of today and its recent dynastic past. ''Though the result can be savored by scholarly connoisseurs,'' Frederic Wakeman Jr. said here last year, the book is ''meant to be appreciated by general readers. . . . The style is brisk, the historical examples are vivid, and the generalizations are both profound and provocative.'' WORLD WITHOUT END, AMEN, by Jimmy Breslin. (Penguin, $4.95.) When this novel about a corrupt, alcoholic cop from Queens who visits his homeland in Northern Ireland was published in 1973, our reviewer, Harvey Gardner, said Jimmy Breslin's tough, wise-guy style seemed inappropriate to ''the horrors of Belfast and Derry.'' But on his own turf, the author captured ''a New York idiom with a shrewdness all his own.'' The same publisher has reissued Mr. Breslin's first novel, THE GANG THAT COULDN'T SHOOT STRAIGHT ($4.50). The story of feuding Brooklyn Mafiosi is a ''hilarious put-on about internecine friction within a Cosa Nostra family,'' one reviewer said in 1969. RE-MAKING LOVE: The Feminization of Sex, by Barbara Ehrenreich, Elizabeth Hess and Gloria Jacobs. (Anchor/Doubleday, $8.95.) Beginning with Beatlemania, sexual liberation has been more a women's than a men's revolution, the authors argue, and one that is often at odds with feminism as well as fundamentalism. ''This intelligent, thought-provoking social history makes very lively reading,'' our reviewer, Judith Viorst, said last year, though she thought the authors went too far in celebrating casual sex. DARK ARROWS: Great Stories of Revenge, edited by Alberto Manguel. (Clarkson N. Potter, $10.95.) ''Life being what it is, one dreams of revenge,'' Paul Gauguin says in an epigraph to this strange mix of stories. Using one of the more regrettable yet powerful of human instincts as a theme, the anthologist, Alberto Manguel, binds together such disparate authors as E. L. Doctorow, Rudyard Kipling, Nadine Gordimer, Jorge Luis Borges, William Trevor and Robert Louis Stevenson. In 1985, one reviewer said the book was ''excellent'' and should appeal to ''a very wide audience. . . . We are all greatly indebted to Manguel's exceptional skill.'' STALIN: The Man and His Era, by Adam B. Ulam. (Beacon, $15.95.) More than any one man, Joseph Stalin is responsible for the totalitarian monolith that Mikhail Gorbachev is chipping away at. This comprehensive book by one of America's pre-eminent Soviet scholars ''is much more than a biography,'' Paul Avrich said in these pages in 1974. ''It is also a history'' and ''will make instructive reading for specialist and layman alike.'' METROPOLIS: New York as Myth, Marketplace, and Magical Land, by Jerome Charyn. (Avon, $8.95.) The novelist's nonfiction portrait of New York City includes among its many characters Mayor Koch, the artist Julian Schnabel and the spider lady of Times Square. It is a ''roller coaster-written, hypnotic, ambitious, often brilliant, often utterly wrongheaded and fascinating book,'' Daniel Stern said here last year.

us,NONFICTION,"LOOKING FORWARD. By George Bush with Victor Gold. (Doubleday, $18.95.) Vice President George Bush establishes the ground rules for his autobiography at the start, warning that it is not an ''inside story'' of his role in the Reagan Administration. That caution is evident throughout, so much so that the book could easily be titled, like President Reagan's autobiography, ''Where's the Rest of Me?'' Mr. Bush elected to call his book ''Looking Forward,'' clearly hoping that it would erase lingering confusion about the political attitudes of the Republican Presidential candidate. But part of his dilemma is inherent in the nature of the book - one written by a sitting Vice President with larger political aspirations. The book, written with Victor Gold, a longtime political adviser, does provide some glimpses of the Vice President's personal history - the bleeding ulcer he suffered and vignettes of his public life, such as his meetings with some of the world's most powerful leaders. But it adds little to our knowledge of what has molded him as a politician or as a man. Mr. Bush leaves uncertain, for example, what is meant by his brand of moderate-conservative politics and why he has maintained a life of public service for nearly three decades, despite personal affronts and major political setbacks. Similarly, he provides some gripping details of personal crises, such as the death of a daughter and his brush with death as a World War II Navy fighter pilot, without explaining their impact on him. Mr. Bush mostly uses the book, whose release coincides with a new push for the Presidency, to argue that he has been an active and effective No. 2.",1987-10-04T05:00:00+0000

The Queen was unusually outspoken last week on the subject of Col. Sitiveni Rabuka, who led a coup in the Pacific island state of Fiji, which, as a Commonwealth member, recognized the monarch as its nominal head of state. Colonel Rabuka, declaring that he, not the Queen, was running things in Fiji, removed the island's Governor General, who is her representative. The Queen, whose powers in the Commonwealth are mostly those of persuasion, issued what was regarded in London as a pretty tough statement. She condemned the Colonel's ''illegal action'' and said that anyone siding with him was ''repudiating his allegiance and loyalty to the Queen.''",1987-10-04T05:00:00+0000

The misadventures of a group of going-nowhere teen-agers in Jill Eisenstadt's first novel, ''From Rockaway,'' would seem to confirm every parent's worst nightmares about what his or her children do when left to their own devices. The book's central characters are a handful of college-age (though not necessarily college-bound) kids, for whom the tedium of their small, dreary world is relieved only by self-destructive rebellion and atavistic ritual. Their realm is the beach in Rockaway (''Rotaway,'' as they refer to it), where many of them work as lifeguards, blowing up seagulls and faking drownings on slow days. What binds Timmy, Peg, and Chowderhead is the suffocating banality of their days on the beach and nights in bars, their friendships cemented by their shared boredom in fast-food emporiums and pizzerias (one of them aptly titled ''The Slice of Life''). They talk about getting out in the way that inmates talk about escaping. Their summer at Rockaway is marked by several hauntingly cruel adolescent rites (not quite rites of passage because nothing is learned or gained). Using shock effects with some skill, ''From Rockaway'' introduces the reader into a little-known subculture on the fringe of New York City. While Ms. Eisenstadt writes fluently and has a sure grasp of her subjects' streetwise vernacular, the novel's relentless focus on this tiresome brat pack fails to generate psychologically valid insights. Possibly, however, this gang is not worth getting to know.",1987-10-04T05:00:00+0000

Since arriving in Miami in 1915, Marjory Stoneman Douglas has been a writer: first a society reporter and editorial-page columnist at The Miami Herald, then a short-story writer of the Saturday Evening Post era, later and most notably the author of ''The Everglades: River of Grass.'' Now Mrs. Douglas has written about all that and about the many other stories in her life. Her autobiography speaks of the Everglades and her fierce advocacy of South Florida's environment, but it says more about other things: Wellesley College in 1910 and the Balkans after World War I, the fight for suffrage, the houses of Coconut Grove, men in general and hundreds of people known and remembered, in mostly fond detail. Now 97, she is nearly blind, and the book resulted from 200 hours of tape that she dictated and the writer John Rothchild edited. She tells a story plainly. She is crabby, sociable and curious, self-deprecating in some respects (''he was kind of unattractive, so we made a good couple'') and not in others (''with those three words I . . . educated the world as to what the Everglades meant''). Without getting overly involved in them, she states her opinions: for example, that families are commonly terrible, that old age is better than middle age and that she cannot accept the dualism of Western religious thought.

Nick Faldo, the British Open champion, sank a 15-foot birdie putt on the final hole to clinch England's place in the final after Rodger Davis of Australia, who had shot a course-record 63 Friday, squandered a three-stroke lead over the final three holes. The United States team never recovered from sluggish starts in all three matches. Curtis Strange trailed Sam Torrance by three strokes at the turn; Mark O'Meara fell four behind Sandy Lyle after eight, and D. A. Weibring was two strokes behind Gordon Brand Jr. after three holes.(AP) Brown Increases Lead: Ken Brown of Britain, closing in on his first PGA Tour victory, conquered the wind to shoot a one-under-par 69 and increase his lead to five strokes entering today's final round of the Southern Open in Columbus, Ga. The 30-year-old Brown, who had earlier rounds of 65 and 64, was at 12-under-par 198 over the par-70, 6,791-yard Green Island Country Club course. Mike Hulbert, who was two shots behind Brown entering yesterday's play managed only a two-over-par 72 and was tied for second at 202 with Hale Irwin, who had a 69, including a 35-foot par-saving putt on No. 18.(AP) Littler Has 1-Shot Lead: Gene Littler shot three consecutive birdies yesterday to score a 67 and take a one-shot lead at 137 after two rounds of the Vantage Championship in Clemmons, N.C., the richest event on the PGA Senior Tour. Littler started his surge with a 6-iron that nestled about a foot from the flag on the 15th. He followed with a 4-iron to within 8 feet on the 16th and stroked a wedge to within 4 feet on the 17th. Gay Brewer, who hasn't won on the Senior Tour for three years, managed a 71 and was one shot behind Littler at 138. The winner will go home with a $135,000 first prize.(AP) Tennis String of Upsets Ends: Jim Pugh ended Todd Nelson's run of upsets yesterday with a 6-3, 6-7, 6-4 victory in the semifinals of the Transamerica Open in San Francisco.

MS is a neurological illness that varies considerably from person to person, and even within the same person. It is certainly not a terminal illness, nor is a downward course inevitable. It is true that it can rapidly progress to life in a wheelchair for about one-third of all patients. On the other hand, many people with MS have exacerbations followed by remissions, when symptoms decrease considerably. The unpredictability of the illness is its most common feature, and one that makes MS an emotional battle as well as a physical one.

The Cafe Nevo is a seedy, dusty Tel Aviv bistro that operates as a stage for the handful of querulous artistic souls who regularly collect there to concoct literary schemes, flaunt extramarital liaisons and achieve respite from the omnipresent reality of the war in Lebanon as well as the past sorrows of the flight from Germany that carried many to the Middle East. Named after the mountain from which Moses espied the Promised Land, the cafe provides a sort of spiritual sustenance for those who frequent it - eating and imbibing are but an afterthought. Nevo is presided over by Emmanuel Sternholz, a crusty, septuagenarian waiter whose dreams died with his wife and child in the Holocaust. Sternholz is an insomniac with an active conscience that more than compensates for the less than astute morals of his clientele; having repressed his own personal life, he now avidly monitors the private lives of his regular customers. Transients - especially women, whom he suspects of stirring things up - are not welcome at Nevo, though there are exceptions, like the aging courtesan, Llana, a woman journalist and a prescient artist. Sexual terrorism, literary one-upmanship and disillusionment over the fate of the Jewish state constitute the conversational mix of Nevo's habitues. Everyone has a weighty problem, and the author rushes along, not always convincingly, trying to connect them all. Eventually Nevo becomes the redemptive vehicle for an often cumbersome array of characters. Sternholtz, the most intriguing of the lot, realizes that thanks to the Mecca that is his cafe, life has its core after all.",1987-10-04T05:00:00+0000

''Jig'' brings the war between Northern Ireland's Roman Catholic nationalists and Protestant loyalists home to America, reportedly the principal source of the funds that keep the Irish Republican Army in business. When $10.2 million of this money is stolen on its way to Ireland, the I.R.A. sends its celebrated superassassin, Jig, to the United States to reclaim it. At the same time, a loyalist terror squad travels here to commit several atrocities that will be laid to Jig and the I.R.A. The loyalists expect a shocked America to respond by sending troops to Ulster on their behalf. Attempting to draw distinctions between terrorists, Campbell Armstrong's improbable plot finds itself in a murky moral landscape. Jig's pursuer is Frank Pagan, a Scotland Yard detective, whose own wife was the random victim of an I.R.A. bomb years earlier. He reluctantly admires Jig's meticulousness in avoiding unnecessary casualties, crediting him with having ''introduced dignity into the whole Irish conflict.'' Jig, like Pagan, despises the ordinary I.R.A. ''home-made grenade groups, the. . . . sad, misguided men who dreamed the dreams of hooligans.'' The reader, however, is more likely to see that one kind of murderer simply serves the writers of thrillers as a romantic protagonist while the other kind doesn't. In his new novel, Mr. Armstrong (the pseudonym of Campbell Black, a former London book editor) writes with glib competence, but nearly every page of this bulky thriller presents the reader with some stunning implausibility. Set in and around New York, ''Jig'' provides ''the troubles'' with much more glamour than they usually wear in the melancholy streets of Londonderry and Belfast.",1987-10-04T05:00:00+0000

In time, America's favorite brunch food met its demise through pure and simple banalization. So what's come about to fill the void? The French have the answer. Although the quiche remains a popular French snack food, that old standby shares the stage with an array of superbly varied open-faced tarts, prepa-rations representing nearly every region of the country. Whether you call it a quiche, a tarte, tourte, galette, pizza or a pie, these quick, uncomplicated dishes remain among the most universally appealing. Depending on the setting and the time of day, an open-faced tart makes a fine first-course offering or an ideal main luncheon dish. It is equally appropriate as picnic fare or a late-evening snack.

The long-sought pact would eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers before the year 2000. Page A1 Eerie silence inside a Sikh shrine and increased violence involving suspected Sikh terrorists beyond its walls symbolize the crisis considered to pose the most serious threat to India's national unity. A1 The next President of Mexico is likely to be a 39-year-old economist, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, chosen by the country's ruling party as its candidate to succeed President Miguel de la Madrid in December 1988. A1 Man in the News: The candidate chosen by Mexico's ruling party, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has paired passions for politics and economics throughout his short but successful career. A8 A prohibited propaganda blitz was operated by the Reagan Administration to ''favorably influence'' public support for the Nicaraguan rebels, a Congressional report says. A3 The Tibetan capital is under curfew and Chinese authorities tried to stop a busload of tourists from leaving Lhasa after demonstrations last week killed at least six people. A6 China has released two Americans who were detained in Tibet during demonstrations there last week, a State Department spokeswoman said. It was not clear why they were held or for how long. A6 El Salvador's President met formally, for the first time in nearly three years, with Marxist-led guerrillas fighting his Government. The meeting, in the Vatican mission, grew out of the Central American peace accord. A3 The remains of a former Moslem who converted back to Christianity on his deathbed have become the focus of a struggle in Malaysia, where religion is an issue of great sensitivity and volatility. A4 A Sputnik anniversary conference in Moscow was marked by a display of space glasnost, X-rays of a supernova, and an appeal by Soviet scientists for international cooperation in exploring the solar system.

Bork's nomination to its empty seat as it opens its new term. A1 Robert H. Bork will not withdraw as a nominee for the Supreme Court even if it becomes apparent after the Judiciary Committee vote that he has little chance of confirmation by the full Senate, a Washington lawyer said. B10 A powerful aftershock jolted Southern California, killing at least one person, causing scattered damage and serving as a reminder of the unpredictability of tremors. The aftershock measured 5.3 on the Richter scale. A16 Political penance performed in Iowa by Governor Michael S. Dukakis has been praised by some politicians as an aggressive form of damage control, but others see his Presidential campaign left with lingering wounds. A21 Elizabeth Hanford Dole embarks this week on one of the most unusual roles of her career: serving as an unpaid, full-time campaign worker in her husband's bid for the Republican Presidential nomination.

B1 Bridgeport officials anxiously await a Federal report on the cause of a building collapse that killed 28 construction workers. The threat of scores of lawsuits is contributing to their anxiety.

''I can't let that hope die within myself and have to pursue that hope somewhere else. I don't see an opportunity here. I have to hope there's an opportunity somewhere else.'' One difficulty in constructing a trade for the 34-year-old right-handed reliever is a contract that calls for a salary of $1.1 million in each of the next three seasons and a real estate partnership with Avon Fogelman, the Royals' co-owner, through 2025. . . .

us,REVITALIZED TRADITION MEETS MATURITY,"Catchers (Average, home runs, r.b.i.) 5 Tony Pena (.214, 5, 44) Acquired last spring from Pittsburgh at steep cost in talent, giving Cardinals the front-line catcher they needed, but then suffered broken bone in thumb on April 10. Hit poorly and struggled to regain stature as prime defensive catcher. Began wearing eyeglasses last week. 25 Steve Lake (.251, 2, 19) Professional for 13 seasons, came to Cardinals after leaving Chicago Cubs' farm system last year. Strong defensively, made one error in 56 games behind plate and threw out 38 percent of baserunners. Lightly used, batted only 176 times. 19 Tom Pagnozzi (.188, 2, 9) Rookie from Arkansas University who suffered setback at AAA level last year when fractured wrist limited his season at Louisville to 30 games. Returned this season as reserve. Infielders(Position, average, home runs, r.b.i.) 22 Jack Clark (First base, 286, 35, 106) Prime power hitter on team, but suffered serious injury for third season in row when he sprained right ankle on Sept. 9 en route to big numbers. Pinch-hit twice this weekend, but remains question mark for playoff. 28 Tommy Herr (Second base, .263, 2, 83) One of five switch-hitters in lineup, now closing seventh season as resident at second base. Has not made full comeback from decline of last year, when he lost 50 points on batting average and drove in 49 fewer runs. 9 Terry Pendleton (Third base, .286, 12, 96) Outstanding glove man at third and helps anchor exceptional infield defense. Also switch-hits with effect. He has surpassed his career highs this year with 167 hits and in home runs and runs batted in, the most by a Cardinal third baseman since Joe Torre in l971. 1 Ozzie Smith (Shortstop, .303, 0, 75) To many, he is even more valuable than Clark. Switch-hitter, still the acrobatic shortstop at the top of his profession, and he keeps rolling: 182 hits (no home runs, but 40 doubles), 75 r.b.i. (the most in his 10-year career) and only 10 errors. 23 Dan Driessen (First base, .233, 1, 11) Veteran left-handed hitter playing for fifth team. Signed to minor-league contract in June, brought up on Aug. 31 and became indispensable when Clark hurt ankle 10 days later. 11 Jose Oquendo (Shortstop, .286, 1, 24) One-time rookie shortstop for Mets who has found home and many roles on Cardinals, including one pitching appearance. Has played eight positions this season, all but catcher. Another switch-hitter, and went 10 for 25 as pinch-hitter. 12 Tom Lawless (Utility, .080, 0, 0) Political-science graduate of Penn State who plays second, third and outfield, and who learned how to catch in spring training. Light right-handed bat, but makes it on versatility. Outfielders(Average, home runs, r.b.i.) 29 Vince Coleman (.289, 3, 43) First player in history to steal 100 bases in his first three seasons, and still the sprinting leadoff man who triggers the offense. He has stolen second and third in the same inning 13 times this season. Leads club with 44 infield hits. 51 Willie McGee (.285, 11, 105) Switch-hitter de luxe who knocked in only 48 runs last year and dropped 97 points in batting average (after leading league the year before). But he has rebounded big, knocked in 100 runs for first time and got 59 extra-base hits. Jammed left thumb against wall on Wednesday. 27 Curt Ford (.285, 3, 26) Left-handed hitter and sprinter from Mississippi who made Cardinals last season and returned this season as frequent right fielder. He will start against right-handers and will be one more threat to steal bases in racing lineup. 21 Lance Johnson (.220, 0, 7) Recalled on Aug. 21 from Louisville, where he won distinction as most valuable player and rookie of year in American Association after hitting .333 and stealing 41 bases in 116 games. 33 John Morris (.261, 3, 23) Left-handed hitter and right fielder from Freeport, L.I., and Seton Hall. Went 10 for 30 as pinch-hitter this season (18 for 55 in career), and knocked in eight runs in pinch role. 15Jim Lindeman (.208, 8, 28) Right-handed hitter from Bradley University who made Cardinals in spring training after hitting 20 home runs at Louisville. Twice disabled this season with back spasms. Starting Pitchers(Record, e.r.a.) 30 John Tudor (10-2, 3.84) Left-handed ace of the staff who won 34 games the last two years. His season took hard turn in April when he suffered broken bone beneath right kneecap in strange accident: He was sitting in dugout when Barry Lyons of Mets slid into him chasing foul pop. But he rejoined staff for final two months. 34 Danny Cox (11-9, 3.88) Right-hander who broke bone in his right foot in early July and joined Tudor on disabled list, giving Cardinals their worst weeks. Since returning, he pitched poorly until Thursday night, when he beat Montreal to clinch division title. 53 Greg Mathews (11-11, 3.73) Left-hander who was called up from Louisville a year ago last June, and won 11 games in final four months. Returned this year and won 11 more. Suffered flat spell as Cardinals squandered big lead in August and September. 41 Joe Magrane (9-7, 3.54) Another big left-hander, a rookie from Arizona University who is considered live-wire personality and poster boy. In spring training, he looked like sure bet to make staff, and he eventually did, but with detours. 31 Bob Forsch (11-7, 4.32) Dean of the staff at 37, he has spent entire 14-year career in majors with the Cardinals. During absence of Tudor and Cox, he helped keep team alive, even though he was pitching with groin-muscle strain. For playoffs, he will a long reliever. Relief Pitchers(Record, e.r.a., saves) 38 Todd Worrell (8-6, 2.66, 33) Continues to be the stopper, the man who pitches to protect the late lead. This is only his second full season, but he already ranks second in Cardinal history in games saved. In last 38 save situations, he has 30. 46 Ken Dayley (9-5, 2.66, 4) The left-handed stopper who made strong comeback after being disabled in July last year by sore elbow. Missed rest of season and underwent surgery in October to repair ligaments and transfer nerves. But he has won nine games in comeback, including five in July. Strikes out more than one an inning. 49 Rick Horton (8-3, 3.82, 7) Left-handed swing man who can start or relieve, and did both: 60 times as starter, six in relief. Won 10 of his last 13 decisions in two seasons. He will be one bridge to Worrell and Dayley.",1987-10-06T05:00:00+0000

Power numbers don't rival Nokes's, but he's a veteran who handles pitchers well and has strong arm. 33 Matt Nokes (.289, 32, 87) If not for Mark McGwire and Kevin Seitzer, Nokes might be league's best-hitting rookie. Greatest liability is on defense, however, where he was partly responsible for Jack Morris's record 24 wild pitches. Infielders(Position, average, home runs, r.b.i.) 41 Darrell Evans (First base, .257, 34, 99) Took pay cut to return to Tigers this season, but where would they be without him? First 40-year-old player to hit at least 30 homers in one season. Manager Sparky Anderson says Evans's clubhouse leadership matches Don Baylor's. 1 Lou Whitaker (Second base, .265, 16, 59) Batting average, homers and r.b.i. took sharp drop from last season while strikeouts rose to career-high 108. Has been formidable double-play combination with Alan Trammell since 1978. 3 Alan Trammell (Shortstop, .343, 28, 105) Moved into cleanup spot after departure of Lance Parrish last winter and made smooth transition. Average, home runs, r.b.i. were all career-best numbers. Might have won most valuable player award from Toronto's George Bell in final weeks of regular season. 17 Jim Morrison (Third base, .205, 4, 19) Numbers were low after trade from Pittsburgh, but he is capable of giving Tigers good defense at third. Hit 23 home runs in 1986 for Pirates, but only 4 for Tigers in 1987. 16 Tom Brookens (.241, 13, 59) May share duties at third with Morrison, although both are right-handed hitters. Made 19 errors, same as Trammell at short. 14 Dave Bergman (First base, .273, 6, 22) Capable glove, but may not see much action in playoff because of Evans. Had 4 hits, 3 r.b.i. as pinch hitter. Outfielders(Average, home runs, r.b.i.) 23 Kirk Gibson (.277, 24, 79) Not as threatening as others in Tiger lineup. Led team with 25 stolen bases and drew 100 walks, but his defense is sometimes costly. Erratic arm forced moved from right field to left this season, yet still made 7 errors. 34 Chet Lemon (.277, 20, 75) Covers deep center-field area (440 feet straightaway) in Tiger Stadium well. Produced superb numbers offensively. Had 53 extra-base hits, more than any Tiger but Trammell, Whitaker and Evans. 31 Larry Herndon (.324, 9, 47) Delivered deciding home run Sunday against Toronto but will likely share duties in right field with Pat Sheridan. Home runs have fallen off last few years, but average was a career high. Led team pinch-hitters with eight hits and five r.b.i. 15 Pat Sheridan (.259, 6, 49) Fighting late-season slump but will play against right-handers because of exceptional defense and left-handed bat. Had 18 steals. Designated Hitters (Average, home runs, r.b.i.) 7 Bill Madlock (.279, 14, 50) Next to Doyle Alexander, was best acquistion this season by General Manager Bill Lajoie. Hit 14 homers in 326 times at bat and probably will start against all pitching. Four-time batting champ in National League has found new life in American League at age 36. 30 John Grubb (.202, 2, 13) Limited to just 114 times at bat, fewest in 10 seasons. Unless he is used as pinch-hitter, will spend series watching from bench. Starting Pitchers(Record, e.r.a.) 19 Doyle Alexander (9-0, 1.53) Went 9-0 after acquired in August; Tigers were 11-0 in his starts. Beat Twins twice without loss during season, allowing 4 runs in 18 innings. If he wins opener, Detroit could take series in five games. 47 Jack Morris (18-11, 3.38) Twins rejected Morris, a native of nearby St. Paul, in winter. Beat Minnesota twice this season and is 11-0 career in Metrodome. Ranked among league leaders this season in victories, e.r.a., innings (266), strikeouts (208) and complete games (13). 35 Walt Terrell (17-10, 4.05) Former Met has 47 victories in three seasons at Detroit, where Tiger Stadium is home sweet home. Was 13-2 in own park this season, 32-7 over three seasons. 26 Frank Tanana (15-10, 3.91) Left-hander might have won chance to start fourth game of playoff with six-hit shutout Sunday against Toronto. Lost spot in rotation late in season, giving up 28 runs in 27 innings but finished with three strong outings. Relief Pitchers(Record, e.r.a., saves) 39 Mike Henneman (11-3, 2.98, 7) Rookie right-hander who faces substantial task in playoff. Worked 96 innings in 55 games during season and totaled 11 victories, 7 saves. Has been effective closer, taking job away from fading Willie Hernandez. 21 Willie Hernandez (3-4, 3.67, 8) Had 87 saves in previous 3 seasons, just 8 this year. Taken to hospital over weekend with abdominal pains but probably won't be used in crucial situations anyway during series. 25 Eric King (6-9, 4.89, 9) Right-hander is No. 2 man in bullpen behind Henneman. Made 51 relief appearances and struck out 89 in 116 innings. Also walked 60. 44 Jeff Robinson (9-6, 5.37, 0) Made 21 starts, but his action may be limited to middle-innings relief against Twins. 40 Mark Thurmond (0-1, 4.23, 5) Occasionally wild left-hander will be used to face one or two left-handed batters. Had 5 saves.",1987-10-06T05:00:00+0000

As the sort of woman who answers a middle-of-the-night phone call by mumbling, ''I'm in a meeting; take a message,'' Miss Keaton's J. C. Wiatt embodies all that is bloodcurdling about today's success-crazed young professionals. Lest anyone consider this a sexist premise, rest assured that J.

The Times's article said Mrs. Braden accused Mr. Whitten of referring to several romantic escapades in the proposal without her knowledge, to make the book more attractive to publishers. The article gave only Mrs. Braden's reasons for withdrawing the proposal and quoted her as saying she did not believe its sexual embellishments ''were germane to what I wanted to write about.'' Mrs. Braden was also quoted as saying that she would not collaborate with Mr. Whitten and that she would write the book with her husband of 39 years, the syndicated columnist Tom Braden. The Times erred in not seeking Mr. Whitten's account of the dispute. He says that only a small part of the proposal had to do with sexual escapades and contends that it was he who dropped Mrs. Braden as a collaborator.",1987-10-07T05:00:00+0000

Page A1 The U.S. won't sell to the Saudis 1,600 Maverick antitank missiles for $360 million to insure Congressional approval of the remaining $1 billion in a pending arms-sale package. A1 Bonn is assigning three naval ships for the first time to the NATO standby force in the Mediterranean in what it termed a ''clear gesture of solidarity'' with Western forces operating in the Persian Gulf. A8 France and Britain are worried that an American-Soviet treaty eliminating medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles might lead West Germany to agree to abolish battlefield nuclear arms under NATO command. A6 Soviet negotiators seemed to retreat in Geneva from a key compromise on a treaty to ban medium- and shorter-range missiles, according to Reagan Administration officials. A1 Poland will hold a referendum this year to seek popular backing for economic changes that could lead to belt-tightening for many Poles, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski said. A1 Nicaragua invited Washington to confer after a Central American peace plan takes effect. But President Daniel Ortega Saavedra, speaking to the United Nations, was harshly critical of President Reagan. A10 Japan will stress nuclear power in a drive for more energy independence and generate 60 percent of its electricity with reactors by the year 2030. The country's nuclear plants now generate 27 percent of its needs. A9 India will buy a supercomputer from the United States under an agreement in principle reached after New Delhi abandoned a request for a more powerful computer. D1 Chad's and Libya's war of waiting Western reporters in Tibet ousted Vienna journal Tunis hangs Moslem rebels despite death threats National A14-22, A30, A40 Liberian rules for illegal aliens toseek amnesty under the new immigration law were set by the Reagan Administration, which predicted that at least 100,000 aliens would be aided. A1 The new Secretary of Transportation nominated by President Reagan is James H. Burnley 4th, now deputy secretary. Mr. Reagan named Mimi W. Dawson, a member of the F.C.C., to succeed Mr. Burnley as deputy. A14 There was no apparent front-runner as Justice Department officials sifted names for other possible nominees amid the apparently doomed nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork for the Supreme Court. A22 News analysis: the split in the Reagan Administration between conservative ideologues and moderate pragmatists has intensified because of the apparent failure of Judge Bork's nomination. A22 The stock market retreated sharply amid worries over inflation, interest rates and next week's major economic reports. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.44 points, to 2,516.64. D1 A second researcher is infected with the AIDS virus, according to health officials. They said the laboratory worker had apparently become infected through a cut in a hand after handling highly concentrated solutions of the virus. B3 Possible health risks from dioxin in consumer paper products are relatively low in most of them, a study said. But officials of the Environmental Protection Agency said more investigation was needed. A18 One nuclear administrator should replace the five member-Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to Senator Alan K. Simpson, the ranking Republican on the Senate Nuclear Energy Subcommittee. A16 Upholding merchant seamen in World War II, a Federal judge in Washington, Louis Oberdorfer, said the Pentagon was arbitrary and capricious in denying them military veteran status.

A1 A policy on handling threats is being adopted by the New York City police. The murder of a crime witness after a death threat against her had been reported to the police prompted officials to adopt the guidelines. A1 A top city school construction official and two of his aides ran a private asbestos-removal consulting concern for seven years until they were ordered last year to end the practice as a possible conflict of interest. B1 Warning on asbestos in schools Governor Cuomo urged Democrats in New York State to back specific Presidential aspirants, even if the result was a divided delegation that would curb his leverage at the national convention. B24 A Queens woman described how she had seen a black man being severely beaten by a dozen white youths and how, after he fled his attackers, she vainly scoured the neighborhood for him in her car to help him flee. B1 Westchester's homeless would be housed for 10 years on land donated by municipalities, and the housing would then be turned over to communities, possibly for housing for the elderly, under a new plan.

''Shreveport is not a contemporary city to me; it is a . . . transparency through which I can see to an overarching past,'' confesses the narrator of this brace of skillfully constructed novellas. He is Albert Sidney Johnston Finch, a recent widower and a retired Louisiana judge whose nostalgic vision of his hometown makes clear the route that John William Corrington (the author of ''Shad Sentell'' and other novels) has chosen to follow here. Largely bypassing the new South of apartment complexes and the rootless souls who inhabit them, Mr. Corrington focuses on the Southern writer's traditional concerns of myth, memory and sense of place. In the first and longer piece, ''Decoration Day,'' Judge Finch is reluctantly drawn into the case of a childhood friend, an elderly black man who refuses to accept a belated Medal of Honor, earned 30 years earlier in the Battle of the Bulge. As the judge reconstructs what really happened to his embittered friend, he finds he can put his own troubles behind him to become involved once more. The second novella, ''The Risi's Wife,'' is a tale within a tale: the judge passes a night listening to an attorney friend spin a ''shaggy divorce story'' about a young streetcar conductor whose war experiences in the Far East transform him into a Risi (a seer) who is unable to adjust to postwar married life in Shreveport. Unabashedly supernatural, ''The Risi's Wife'' shares with ''Decoration Day'' a concern with the past and how one learns to live with it. Both works also demonstrate the writer's skill in creating overlapping plots, which occasionally seem to dovetail too neatly. Nonetheless, we are left feeling we have overheard two good stories well told.",1987-10-11T05:00:00+0000

Shultz as well as dinners, luncheons and chats with a slew of the nation's most powerful Senators. Why the high level treatment for an ''unofficial'' visitor?

His words serve aptly to capture the sometimes uneasy but always respectful tone of the 15 essays in LE CORBUSIER (Princeton University, Paper, $19.95; Garland, Cloth, $60), edited by H. Allen Brooks. None of the impressive contributors, including historian-critics (Reyner Banham, Vincent Scully), practicing architects (Alan Colquhoun, Charles Correa) or former colleagues (Andre Wogenscky, Jerzy Soltan, Iannis Xenakis), have settled for mere laudatory praise of the master's obvious triumphs, although Tim Benton and Daniele Pauly have delivered close appreciations of the Villa Savoye and the Ronchamp chapel. Instead, most of the authors have chosen to grapple with some of the tougher questions and contradictions implicit in the work of a man who loved principles and rules (the Five Points, the Seven V's), but didn't hesitate to dispense with them when more convenient in the service of his art. Indeed, the many conflicts of opinion expressed here - on the influence of monasteries in Le Corbusier's unite d'habitation, on the exclusivity of his design ideas, on whether he was an evil influence or a misunderstood visionary - only add to this collection's fascination. Clearly, the debate over Corbu's contribution to modernism is only gaining momentum or, as Norma Evenson puts it in her consideration of Corbu's devastating effect on urban planning, ''like it or not, we may have Le Corbusier to kick around for quite a while.''",1987-10-11T05:00:00+0000

A person harboring the AIDS virus has not committed a criminal act by virtue of being infected, and, furthermore, poses no risk to other individuals who themselves refrain from unsafe behavior. Unlike detaining armed airline passengers to prevent hijacking or closing unfit restaurants to eliminate food poisoning, the government's ''search'' for AIDS via testing is not the sole means available to protect the public from harm. It is merely one of several measures, no other of which appears to be as politically useful to the Administration. DANIEL NAJJAR Washington",1987-10-11T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"A SUMMONS TO MEMPHIS, by Peter Taylor. (Ballantine, $4.95.) The story of Phillip Carver, called to Memphis by his sisters to stop their widowed father from remarrying, won the Pulitzer Prize. As in his past works, Peter Taylor writes about the ways we use conventions and manners to circumscribe the world, making it an easier, if duller, place to live. Last year our reviewer, Marilynne Robinson, called this a ''beautifully ironic new novel'' that ''reminds us that people, like spiders, impose geometries on thin air.'' SIDESHOW: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia, by William Shawcross. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $12.95.) In a new introduction to his account of the American role in the ''secret'' war in Cambodia, William Shawcross describes a lavish dinner party at a New York hotel in 1985, where bitter enemies are forced by politics to act like friends: the deposed Prince Sihanouk, celebrating his 60th birthday, merrily sings to the sounds of a Cambodian dance band, while representatives of the murderous Khmer Rouge look on. ''This somber and compelling study . . . tells an ugly story,'' one reviewer said in 1979. THE GOOD FATHER, by Peter Prince. (Carroll & Graf, $7.95.) In truth, Karen Ray said here in 1985, this story of two divorced men, their children and their wars with their former wives has no ''good fathers'' in it. The main character, a former radical named Bill Hooper, is annoyingly obsessive and self-centered, the reviewer said, though she admired the novel's minor characters, ''particularly the women, who are the most interesting and believably quirky.'' THE PASSION OF AYN RAND, by Barbara Branden. (Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95.) Ayn Rand is most widely known for her best-selling, critically disparaged novels. But her philosophy of enlightened self-interest has inspired a succession of college students, some of whom have ascended to positions in and around the Reagan Administration. Last year our reviewer, Peter L. Berger, said that Barbara Branden was too close to the subject (her husband had an affair with Rand) to write a completely successful biography, but he found ''something appealing, even a touch of grandeur,'' in her portrait of one of libertarianism's fiercest advocates. DRUNK WITH LOVE: A Book of Stories, by Ellen Gilchrist. (Little, Brown, $7.95.) Ellen Gilchrist writes stories about the many ways in which relationships fall apart, generally because of the inadequacies of men. In 1986 our reviewer, Wendy Lesser, found the author's ethnic and regional stereotypes wearing, but credited her with an ability to capture characters, at various times in their lives, as though ''taking home movies . . . with a clearly focused and artfully held lens.'' ON THE STROLL, by Alix Kates Shulman. (Academy Chicago, $8.95.) Roaming the badlands around New York City's seedy Port Authority Bus Terminal, a bag lady named Owl comes to believe that Robin, a 16-year-old runaway turned prostitute, is her missing daughter; the girl's pimp, Prince, feels possessive for other reasons. While the plot is merely sufficient, Mary Cantwell said here in 1981, ''the book's strength lies in the portraits of [ the characters ] and the evocation of the blasted landscape through which [ they ] move.'' THE GREAT DEPRESSION: An Inquiry Into the Causes, Course, and Consequences of the Worldwide Depression of the Nineteen-Thirties, as Seen by Contemporaries and in the Light of History, by John A. Garraty. (Anchor/Doubleday, $9.95.) In the 1980's, as in the 20's, the banking system is saddled with huge foreign debt (this time in Latin America rather than Europe) and we are faced with an agricultural decline accompanied by cries for protectionism. Though he is not among the doom-sayers predicting another Great Depression, John A. Garraty draws cautionary parallels in a ''timely, troubling book,'' our reviewer, Mancur Olson, said last year. ''The tragic history . . . is disturbingly pertinent to our current concerns.'' MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE, by Eric Hodgins. Illustrated by William Steig. (Academy Chicago, $7.95.) Eric Hodgins's comic novel about an advertising executive whose idyllic house in the country runs and nearly ruins his life was made into a movie starring Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. ''No ordinary joke-smith, Mr. Hodgins is light and expert,'' our reviewer, Brooks Atkinson, said in 1946. WHERE NIGHTS ARE LONGEST: Travels by Car Through Western Russia, by Colin Thubron. (Atlantic Monthly, $7.95.) Convinced that the author was too unadventurous to write convincingly about the Soviet Union, our reviewer, S. Frederick Starr, admitted that he opened the book ''with the same mixture of trepidation and condescension with which one prepares for an evening of neighbors' slides from last summer's vacation.'' But he was pleasantly surprised. ''The results are glorious,'' he said in 1984. ''A subtle and humane writer, Mr. Thubron is able to capture the fleeting words and gestures that define a culture.'' STRINDBERG, by Michael Meyer. (Oxford, $14.95.) When this biography of the eccentric Swedish playwright was published in 1985, The Times's John Gross praised the author, Michael Meyer, for being ''as admirable a guide to this problematic genius as anyone could ask. The good sense of his account is matched by its imaginative sympathy.'' TAKING CHANCES, by M. J. Farrell. (Penguin, $6.95.) Into the calm, pastoral Ireland of M. J. Farrell's novel, a beautiful interloper named Mary Fuller arrives and wrecks a marriage. While the love scenes aren't as artful as the fox-hunting scenes, one reviewer said in 1930, ''Miss Farrell's delight in the open fields [ and ] her enthusiasm for horses . . . give the story its distinctive qualities of color and movement.''",1987-10-11T05:00:00+0000

The increase was the fifth so far this year, and, although it was expected, it still sent a chill down the spines of the people who had been thinking about borrowing money. Short-term interest rates have been on the rise - indeed, yields in the bond market have been at or near two-year highs - and the prime has followed suit. But where in the past the prime was the rate given by banks to their best customers, in recent years it has been tied more closely to consumer rates, like home equity loans and some credit cards. The big guys have found cheaper money from banks and through commercial paper. Even so, higher interest rates, in part, help dampen interest in borrowing money to make purchases that increase demand for products and push prices up - in other words, higher rates help rein in inflation.

Some of the descendants of the Bounty mutineers were moved to North Island from Pitcairn Island by the British in 1856. Air New Zealand (800-262-1234) usually operates two flights a week to Norfolk Island from Auckland, perhaps the best gateway. The flight takes an hour and 55 minutes and the round-trip fare is about $380. The island may also be reached on a somewhat longer flight from Brisbane, Australia, with Air New South Wales. There are three flights a week and round-trip fare is about $450. Air New South Wales is represented in the United States by Qantas (800-227-4500).

One Iraqi attack severely damaged a Liberian-registered oil tanker, and two crewmen were reported killed.

A6 Racism seeps into French politics, particularly in the country's south, where many citizens are flocking to the side of Jean-Marie Le Pen and his calls for curbs on Arab immigration.

A1 Tamil rebels killed 30 Indian troops in the last 24 hours in Sri Lanka, possibly in a single operation, according to a spokeswoman for the Indian Government. A3 The killing of a Haitian who was running for president was part of a plan by loyalists of the deposed Duvalier regime to intimidate candidates and voters, according to Haitian political leaders.

A1 Stocks suffered their biggest loss in history as the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 95.46 points, or 3.81 percent. D1 George Bush, espousing lower taxes, called for cuts of nearly half the maximum capital gains levy for individuals. The Vice President contended the change would spur growth and not cost the Treasury money. A1 G.O.P. senators refused requests by Democratic leaders for a speedy debate and vote on Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court. Fifty-four senators oppose his confirmation.

He said Bonn's action, which was the fourth increase since July, was inconsistent with ''the spirit of our recent consultations.'' A weaker dollar would hurt the West German economy by making its exports more expensive but could also cause higher interest rates and inflation in the United States, two prospects that are already roiling the American financial markets. Mr. Baker's remarks were made as he and other Administration economic officials tried to soothe investor fears. [ Page A1. ] Chemical Bank raised its prime rate half a point, to 9 3/4 percent, saying that its cost of funds had increased. Other banks are expected to follow Chemical's lead soon. [ D6. ] An expansion of part of the Social Security tax was proposed by Democratic tax writers in the Senate. They suggested that all of an employee's wages be made subject to the Medicare portion of the payroll tax. At present, the 1.45 percent hospital insurance tax is imposed only on the first $43,800 of annual wages. [ D1. ] The highest-paid Federal employee will step aside as chief executive of the Federal Asset Disposition Association, which has sold only a tiny fraction of the loans and real estate obtained from failed savings and loan associations. But Roslyn B. Payne, who received $325,000 last year, will remain at the agency as a specialist. [ D1. ] Harvard Business School is counterattacking a book that offers an unflattering portrait of it and its faculty. Harvard lawyers have briefed professors about libel law and some faculty members say they are considering taking legal action. [ D1. ] Santa Fe Southern Pacific received several bids for its Southern Pacific Transportation unit, one of its two railroads. [ D2. ] Retail sales fell 0.4 percent in September after a strong summer. The decline was led by weakness in automobile sales, which fell 1.4 percent in September after a 5.7 percent increase in August. [ D5. ] MARKETS A day of wild gyrations in the credit markets ended with generally higher interest rates. Traders were concerned about official hints that the U.S. might allow the dollar to weaken, a move that could add to inflationary pressures and force the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policy. One area in which yields fell was the safe haven of three-month Treasury bills, where demand was heavy from investors apparently weary of taking risks. [ D1. ] Stocks took another sharp plunge as a wave of selling set in during the final half-hour of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 57.61 points, or 2.39 percent, to 2,355.09. That came after Wednesday's record point drop of 95.46. Volume was the fourth-largest ever, at 263.2 million shares. The late selling wave came from program trading, said analysts, who added that the stage was set by the rise in the prime lending rate. [ D6. ] The dollar turned mostly lower as the disappointing August trade report continued to dampen sentiment toward the currency. Gold prices rose to $463.50 an ounce in New York, up $2.25. [ D13. ] Precious metals futures prices advanced but gave up some of their gains late in the session. [ D13. ] COMPANIES Meritor Financial plans a restructuring that will leave it with a $379.6 million quarterly loss and sharply curtailed expansion plans. Its main subsidiary is the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society. [ D5. ] Transamerica agreed to acquire BWAC Inc. from the Borg-Warner Holdings Corporation for $782.5 million. BWAC, based in Chicago, is a major commercial finance company. [ D5. ] Times Mirror is buying four magazines from Diamandis for $167.5 million. They are Field & Stream, Home Mechanix, Skiing and Yachting. [ D5. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS Although the falling stock market may be implying an economic downturn in the near future, many economists do not expect a recession until 1989. The market is right, though, to worry about thedollar. Leonard Silk. Ecomomic Scene. [ D2. ] This ''October Massacre'' of stocks has reached daunting proportions, amid a growing consensus that the five-year-old bull market may be at a critical juncture. Doubts are even emerging about the optimistic earnings forecasts that have been a principal prop of the market in recent months. Market Place. [ D1. ]",1987-10-16T05:00:00+0000

Fast is the way Thomas (Hollywood) Henderson grew up on the streets of Austin, Tex.; hard is the way he played professional football in Dallas from 1975 to 1979; fast and hard is the way he fell from fame as a result of alcohol and cocaine abuse. In ''Out of Control,'' written with Peter Knobler, the co-author with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of ''Giant Steps,'' Mr. Henderson is candid about his unprotected childhood, his young adulthood as a pool-hall hustler and his days as a star linebacker with the two-time Super Bowl champions, the Dallas Cowboys. Using foul language and pro football jargon, he effectively puts the reader on the playing field and reveals all: the taking of drugs before, during and after games; the coaches concerned only about players' performance; the squabbles among the Cowboys; the crunch of a hard tackle. And he painfully but compellingly describes the nightmare of his cocaine addiction. ''Out of Control'' is sobering. Although Mr. Henderson's explanation of his rehabilitation is crammed into the book's last 15 pages, with few details, he tells football fans in no uncertain terms just what kind of lives some of their heroes lead inside the locker room and outside the stadium.",1987-10-18T05:00:00+0000

The exam was to take the form of identifying a company ripe for a corporate raid; the student who came up with a takeover target that Mr. Edelman decided to pursue would get a $100,000 finder's fee. But those who oversee the teaching of business at Columbia apparently draw the line at doing business in the classroom. Last week, Dean John C.

As a judge in the New York State courts for 17 years, Bruce Wright has never minced his words about the almost inevitable racism of white Americans, and that has often led to accusations that he hates all whites. Justice Wright, now on the New York State Supreme Court, finds that somewhat ironic since his mother was white. Little nuggets of autobiographical detail are scattered throughout this slim volume, which Justice Wright describes as ''reflections and musings, if you will, on a view of America based upon an entire life spent as a black male in a white world.'' The book presumes that the reader knows something of the judge's reputation: in the 1970's he was nicknamed Turn 'Em Loose Bruce by those who disagreed with his policy on setting bail for suspects, and his public comments often created a furor. The major premise of the book, which is often rambling and repetitive, is that white judges are incapable of treating black defendants justly. ''What do they study in college or law school that might tend to qualify them to preside over the doom or liberty of strangers to their kinds of neighborhoods, of aliens to their way of life, of foreigners and outsiders to their clubs, their churches, their folkways?'' he asks. The book suffers when the judge rehashes the views of others on topics as varied as opera and the lingering impact of slavery on blacks. But in relating anecdotes about judges he has known and their treatment of defendants - nearly all of the incidents predate the 1980's - the author comes close to proving his indictment of the court system.",1987-10-18T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"WINTER IN MOSCOW, by Malcolm Muggeridge. (Eerdmans, $8.95.) Half journalism, half fiction, this withering look at the Soviet Union was described by its author, the British satirist, who was a correspondent for The Manchester Guardian in Russia in 1932-33, as ''truth imaginatively expressed.'' ''It is quite possible that Mr. Muggeridge is more than slightly mad,'' one reviewer said in 1934, ''but his is the burning madness of a poet who has come to see the fulfillment of a dream of Utopian equality and finds a hell of human suffering.'' ADA: A Life and a Legacy, by Dorothy Stein. (MIT, $9.95.) As friend and patron of Charles Babbage, who in 1833 designed (but never built) a sophisticated contraption called the Analytical Engine, Ada, the Countess of Lovelace and the daughter of Lord Byron, is sometimes revered as the world's first computer programmer. So captivating is this myth that when the Defense Department began developing a universal computer language - an Esperanto that it hopes will someday supplant the babelesque variety of tongues now in use - it decided to name it after her. Though Dorothy Stein's biography debunks the myth of this heroine of computer science, our reviewer, Tracy Kidder, said he liked it anyway. ''This book's cast of characters could easily sustain a novel,'' he said in 1985. It ''evokes a historical period and sets a record straight.'' RETURN TO REGION, by Juan Benet. Translated by Gregory Rabassa. (Columbia University, $9.95.) Old Dr. Sebastian is living a hellish life with his retarded godson, whom he keeps medicated and under lock and key, when a mysterious woman arrives. The haunting stories they tell each other make for a ''brilliant novel by one of Spain's major writers,'' William Herrick said here in 1985. ''It is a lovely, sad book, and the translation . . . is superb.'' The same publisher has reissued another novel by a contemporary Spanish writer, translated by Helen R. Lane. In EXTRAMUROS ($9.95), by Jesus Fernandez Santos, a religious cult forms around a medieval nun who perpetrates a hoax: she has her hands pierced to fake the stigmata, the wounds of Christ that are said to miraculously appear on certain especially devout mystics. The novel won the Spanish National Prize for Literature in 1979. Our reviewer, David Lodge, said in 1984 that while he was put off by the ''mannered literary style,'' ''there is no doubt of the integrity of the author's artistic intentions.'' A TASTE FOR DEATH, by P. D. James. (Warner, $4.95.) Two corpses, their throats cut, are discovered in the vestry of a London church, and the sardonic Comdr. Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard sets out to find the connection between the victims - a Government minister and a derelict. This novel by the British writer P. D. James ''is graced by one of the most felicitous prose styles I know,'' Robert B. Parker said here in 1986. ''Ms. James is simply a wonderful writer.'' LUISA DOMIC, by George Dennison. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) A Maine poet's circumscribed life is disrupted when he meets Luisa Domic, a Chilean refugee whose family was killed in a right-wing coup. In 1985, our reviewer, Howard Frank Mosher, said he admired the novel for its ability to ''celebrate rural life in contemporary America, yet . . . transcend the limitations traditionally associated with regional fiction.'' THE KOREAN WAR: Pusan to Chosin. An Oral History, by Donald Knox. (Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $10.95.) Wedged in the history texts between World War II and Vietnam, Korea may have been America's forgotten war, but not for the people who fought it. This is ''a superb record of what war and battle are all about . . . [ told ] in the blunt Anglo-Saxon tongue,'' Drew Middleton said here last year. ''Because those telling the story are ordinary officers and men, it has a force and reality that few historians writing today will be able to match.'' THE PEDLOCKS, by Stephen Longstreet. (Primus/ Donald I. Fine, $8.95.) Written before the invention of the television mini-series, this multigenerational saga tells how a Jewish family settled in America around the time of the Civil War and eventually established a dynasty. When it was first published in 1951, one reviewer praised it as ''an opulent, crowded narrative, exuberant in its embrace of Jewish customs, cookery, fervor and fertility. It is also, now and then, a showcase for the novelist's display of sophistication.'' S. J. PERELMAN: A Life, by Dorothy Herrmann. (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) As a recent collection of his letters showed, the humorist S. J. Perelman often found his life more tormenting than amusing. Last year, our reviewer, John Lahr, said Dorothy Hermann's biography ''amply documents [ that ] the writer was also narcissist-nice and erudite-empty.'' !CLICK SONG, by John A. Williams. (Thunder's Mouth Press, $9.95.) In this bitter indictment of the publishing industry, Cato Caldwell Douglass cannot get his fiction published because he is black. When the novel appeared in 1982, one reviewer criticized it for occasionally lapsing into ''stereotyping [ and ] scattershot self-pity,'' but praised it as ''a novel full of truth, savage with neurotic sophistication.'' MARY TODD LINCOLN: Her Life and Letters, edited by Justin G. Turner and Linda Levitt Turner. (Fromm International, $12.95.) For those who would prefer a tidier, G-rated American history, Abraham Lincoln's wife has always been an embarrassment. By reading over her shoulder, the editors of this voluminous but well-annotated collection of correspondence set out to establish whether she was indeed ''a shrew, a spendthrift, a madwoman.'' The result, T. H. Williams said here in 1972, is a book that offers ''countless insights into the life of the period and will be a priceless source for historians.''",1987-10-18T05:00:00+0000

But like most new firms, they began small - renovating antiquated kitchens and bathrooms and adding bedrooms over a garage or onto the back of a house. Six years later, their business has grown considerably, and they are now designing many new homes as well as renovating old ones. As a result of their location, Shope Reno Wharton Associates have become specialists at coping with the varied architectural styles common to a suburban community like Greenwich - knowing to what degree it's appropriate to alter the exterior of a building, for example, and what methods are the most practical. ''It's always more economical to keep rooms where they are,'' explains Shope. ''Even when the design calls for making them larger.''",1987-10-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Trade Data Set Off A Market Plunge,"A brutal week for stocks gave the bull market its first serious correction since 1984 and even provoked some traders to start writing obituaries for the bull. The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 235.48 during the week, to close at 2,246.73. The daily action was even more spectular with what was thought to be a record plunge of 95.46 on Wednesday, followed by a 57.61-point dive on Thursday and then the real topper, a plummet of 108.36 on Friday. As postwar corrections go, in percentage terms, this one would not even make the top 10, but that is probably little comfort to anyone who was buying stocks when the Dow set its record high of 2,722.42 a scant seven weeks ago on Aug. 25.

The young villagers say they have continued to see the vision at the same time each day. Hundreds of thousands of Europeans and many Americans, most of them traveling with Roman Catholic church groups, visit the village and attend services in its church. Pilgrims who spend the night in Medjugorje stay in private homes, which are the only accommodations, but a Yugoslav tour company, Kompas, says it is opening the first hotel in the village this winter.

us,Where Is Architecture Headed?,"''Most of the people in our office, who are younger than we are, are much more conservative, and much less flexible.'' - Alan Wanzenberg, 36, a Manhattan architect, as quoted in Progressive Architecture magazine 'Modernism lasted 80 years before it was severely attacked, but post-modernism has only lasted eight years. . . . At New York City architecture schools 99 percent of the students are designing modernist buildings; the interest in Michael Graves, Philip Johnson, etc., is completely gone there.'' - Peter Pran, 51, former co-chairman of the awards committee, New York Chapter/American Institute of Architects What do these observations mean? Are younger architects really more conservative than their elders? And does being conservative mean that they are trying to turn back the clock toward modernism? The answers, respectively, are ''yes'' and ''sort of.'' Taken together, these quotations clearly suggest that young designers - student architects and those in their first years of work - are not entranced with the creative philosophy of the last few years. These comments indicate that many of them choose not to accept the now common viewpoint that it is not only possible, but desirable, for architecture to rely on the past. That view, so often called post-modernism, has become virtually the establishment attitude, and as it has taken hold, modernism's rigid, somewhat puritanical stance - its belief that purity of form and clarity of structure were often more important than either comfort or visual pleasure - has been all but abandoned.",1987-10-18T05:00:00+0000

So argues an off-the-deep-end Ludwig Wittgenstein in this first novel by the noted Marxist critic Terry Eagleton. Other characters include the Irish labor leader and revolutionary James Connolly, Wittgenstein's sidekick Nikolai Bakhtin and, in a delightful cameo, Joyce's Leopold Bloom. The year is 1916, and all are on the run: Wittgenstein from philosophy and his teaching post at Oxford; Connolly, wounded in the Easter rising, from the British soldiers; Bakhtin from the ideological chaos of Russia; and Bloom from a failed marriage (Molly has just eloped with Stephen). The meeting place is a cottage on the west coast of Ireland. Along the way Mr. Eagleton does a quick sketch of the political and intellectual issues of the period, and the hot spots that spawned them - Vienna, Dublin and St. Petersburg. The book's main concern is with the limitations of thought when dealing with social problems. In a climactic debate, Wittgenstein criticizes the revolutionary's inhuman, philosophical purity, Connolly countering with a lively defense of historical determinism. The Falstaff-like Bakhtin objects to the humorlessness of revolution. Finally Bloom pulls himself out of his free-associating internal monologue to argue that he doesn't know any of them personally, since they only care about ideas. ''I think I'm just about the only real person here,'' he says. Mr. Eagleton's novella of ideas reads quickly and has its humorous moments; he's a lucid, witty explainer. But this is less a work of fiction than the kind of entertaining concert (''Imagine if the Irish rebel James Connolly had encountered . . .'') an enterprising professor might use to liven up his class.",1987-10-18T05:00:00+0000

The FFG-7 Class was conceived, designed and built as convoy escort warships. The Stark and her sister ships were given capabilities in all naval warfare areas so they would be able to defend unarmed merchantmen without battle-group support.

us,FICTION,"GLITTERING IMAGES. By Susan Howatch. (Knopf, $18.95.) Susan Howatch's 12th novel takes place in pre-World War II England, just after Edward VIII abdicated to marry the divorced Wallis Simpson. The event is emblematic, for this novel is about marriage and divorce and proper behavior within a religious context. True to the formulas of romance fiction, ''Glittering Images'' is rife with bad marriages, illegitimacy and discreet sexual liaisons; yet all these goings-on seem oddly out of place within the domestic lives of Anglican clergymen. The narrator is a young intellectual cleric, Charles Ashworth, who is sent by the Archbishop of Canterbury to spy on Alex Jardine, the charismatic, liberal Bishop of Starbridge. Ashworth uncovers evidence in Jardine's household - which includes a depressive wife and her pretty female companion - of sexual scandal and a highly irregular interpretation of Anglican dogma. The revelation of the mystery of Starbridge sends Ashworth into a personal crisis of faith from which he is facilely extricated by a monk, Father Jon Darrow - his confessor-exorcist-psychoanalyst. Most popular novels are driven by a lively, fast-moving plot, but this one creaks along clumsily and is studded with insultingly obvious markers alerting the reader to every minute twist in the action and nuance of emotion. In an attempt to capture the prissy manners and sexual reticence of the age, Ms. Howatch has created sanctimonious characters stifled by convention who lack subtlety and depth. They engage in tedious theological arguments or inane, cliche-ridden exchanges about those inevitable and tired English subjects: class, social standing and the weather. Life within the cathedral close must have been very dull indeed.",1987-10-18T05:00:00+0000

Analysts say that rising interest rates in West Germany and Japan, plus renewed weakness of the dollar, are the key reasons why American interest rates have been rising, and not an exaggerated fear of inflation. [ Page D1. ] Treasury Secretary Baker's decision to let the dollar fall against the mark is the right choice, many economists say, noting that rising West German rates and market turmoil helped force his hand. [ D5. ] Bankers are preoccupied with the next move of the market and prospects for the overall economy, judging from their conversations at the American Bankers Association convention.

The Dow Jones industrial average plunged a record 508.00 points, raising fears of an economic recession. Page A1 Most Americans are likely to be hurt by the dramatic decline in stock values, even those who own no stock at all, unless the market bounces back quickly and substantially, economists say. The biggest threat may be psychological. A1 News analysis: No Great Depression is imminent, many economists say, citing safeguards that are in place, including more Government responsibility, and that would prevent the kind of economic morass that followed the 1929 crash. A1 A global wave of panic selling dominated financial markets following Wall Street's sharp drop and comments from White House officials that Washington may let the dollar fall. Investors throughout Europe and Asia dumped shares. D33 News analysis: Shouts of panic on Wall Street echoed only faintly in the corridors of the Reagan Administration. Few people in official Washington seemed to have any prescription to offer demoralized investors. D32 Agitation stalked the streets in New York City's financial district, as strangers stopped each other to inquire about the market, traders lost their sense of humor and pandemonium reigned on the floor of the stock exchange. D1 Investors watched stock prices dive and wondered what was happening as the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 508 points. Many wondered if there was anything they could do to help themselves; for some, it was too late. D1 President Reagan did not consider ordering a halt to trading as he watched today's stock market plunge, despite consultations with financial experts and White House advisers, his spokesman said. D32 International A3-14 U.S. forces struck back at Iran for attacks on American-registered vessels and other Persian Gulf shipping by blasting two connected offshore platforms that American officials said were used as a base for Iranian gunboats. A1 Iran promised a 'crushing blow' against the United States in revenge for the American attack, saying Washington was embroiled in a full-fledged war with Iran. A11 President Reagan was 'buoyant,' according to his aides, acting ''upbeat'' and ''bouncy'' and cracking jokes despite the plummeting stock market, his wife's illness and the military action in the Persian Gulf. A11 Japan's next Prime Minister is virtually certain to be Noboru Takeshita. The former Finance Minister, and a master of political compromise, was designated by the incumbent, Yasuhiro Nakasone, to be his successor. A3 Man in the News: Noboru Takeshita, the former Finance Minister nominated to be Japan's next Prime Minister, has described himself in parable form as hard-working, little noticed, uncomplaining and absolutely indispensible.

Across the country, people of all ages turned to ticker tapes, to television sets, to any source of news, as they tried to figure out what really was happening in the stock market.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1987","THE STOCK MARKET PLUNGE The stock market had its worst day in history. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged an estimated 508 points, to 1,738.74, on trading so heavy that reporting was delayed for hours. More than 604 million shares changed hands, dwarfing Friday's record of 338.5 million shares, and the decline of 22.6 percent was far greater than the drop of 12.82 percent on Black Monday in 1929, which ignited the Great Depression. The chairman of the New York Stock Exchange said yesterday's debacle was ''the nearest thing to a meltdown that I ever want to see.'' [ Page A1. ] The Tokyo stock market appeared headed for a record one-day drop today, and the Hong Kong market suspended trading for the week. [ D1. ] In United States exchanges, computers strained under a deluge of trading that their designers did not expect until the early 1990's. [ D34. ] The record plunge was fed in part by huge sales of shares in stock-oriented mutual funds, as investors switched their money into money market funds, bonds and gold. [ D33. ] Most Americans are likely to be hurt by the stock market's drop, economists say. If nothing else, people and businesses will feel poorer, which in the long run could cause a slowdown in the economy and a rise in unemployment. [ A1. ] Small investors searched for news much of the day. Many held on to their stocks, as they tried to determine what really was happening. [ D1. ] In the financial district, some participants said yesterday was a day unlike any other they had ever seen. [ D1. ] President Reagan watched the plunge with concern but at no time considered ordering a halt to trading. [ D32. ] Democratic leaders in Congress blamed the Administration's policies and urged the President to accept a deficit-reduction package that would include tax increases. [ D32. ] Leaders of America's top companies admitted they were shaken and confused by the market's fall. [ 32. ] The plunge could hit hard in New York City, where securities industry employment accounts for about 8 percent of the jobs. [ D32. ] Treasury Secretary Baker met with West German officials in Frankfurt and, Mr. Baker's office said, agreed to work to keep currency rates ''around current levels.'' But Mr. Baker decided to cut short his trip because of the market's ordeal. [ D1. ] OTHER MARKETS Treasury securities prices soared as money flowed in from investors who had sold stocks. Interest rates were lower in all maturities. Interest rates on three-month Treasury bills, for example, dropped to about 6.2 percent from 6.64 percent. [ D1. ] The dollar closed lower against all leading currencies except the Canadian dollar. But gold rose to its highest price in more than four years, at $486.50 an ounce, up $15.50, in New York. [ D26. ] Most futures prices plummeted, including those for livestock, cotton, grain and stock indexes. Precious-metals futures, meanwhile, soared as investors sought safe havens. [ D26. ] THE ECONOMY The operating capacity rate stayed at 81.2 percent in September in the nation's factories, mines and utilities. [ D2. ] COMPANIES The buyout offer for GAF is being reconsidered. Samuel J. Heyman, GAF's chairman and leader of the buyout group, said rising loan costs would require that the bid be revised or dropped. [ D5. ] J. P. Morgan's earnings edged up 3.6 percent, and Security Pacific reported an 8.3 percent increase. [ D9. ] A.T&T. reported a 5.3 percent drop in quarterly earnings, while MCI posted a 22 percent gain. [ D5. ] INTERNATIONAL Japan apparently is choosing the General Dynamics F-16 as its jet fighter, and Mitsubishi is expected to build 170 in Japan. [ D5. ] The Administration reportedly will further lift the trade sanctions levied against Japan last April. [ D6. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS A growing number of employers are cutting their payments to health maintenance organizations. Business and Health.

Judge John Gale of the 11th Circuit Court of Dade County in Miami granted a temporary injunction allowing Highsmith to negotiate with other teams and prohibiting the N.F.L. from taking any action against a team that signs him. ''It's essentially a case of collusion between Houston and some other teams to depress the market value of Alonzo,'' said Bruce Greer, Highsmith's attorney. Joe Browne, a spokesman for the N.F.L., said that league lawyers believed the courts would restore Houston's rights to Highsmith quickly. ''We believe the state court's order was issued without notice or hearing and raises serious jurisdictional or procedural issues,'' he said. Highsmith, who has been a holdout since July 28, is seeking between $2.4 million and $2.6 million over four years.

Maxson said he met Tuesday for more than two hours with Coach Jerry Tarkanian and was told by Tarkanian that he wasn't aware of any recruiting violations. Committee members said the investigation was hampered by the refusal of Daniels to answer questions about his living arrangements and about allegations of payoffs to him.

us,Q&A,"Q.A disappearing stairway leads up to my attic. How can I insulate the space over it, since brackets extend up over the attic floor and prevent the upper side from lying flush with the floor in the attic? A.The simplest way is to build a shallow ''box'' that extends up into the attic and forms an enclosure around the stairway opening. This can have a hinged door at the top -much like a trunk lid - that can be swung open as you climb into the attic. You can cover the outside of this enclosure (inside the attic) as well as the top of the access door with rigid boards of foam insulation or even with fiberglass batts. Q.I just moved into an apartment that has the radiators painted with a wall paint, not with the metallic paint that is more suited for this purpose. Is this flat wall paint toxic, and if so, how should I remove it? A.You are misinformed. First, metallic paint is not the ''right kind'' for radiators - it cuts their efficiency. Using a flat paint on the radiators makes it easier for them to radiate heat. Second, wall paint is no more toxic than any other kind of paint, so you don't have to remove it; you can just paint over it. If removal is necessary because of too many layers, strip the metal with a chemical paint and varnish remover. Q.When we moved into our apartment five years ago, it had a rough, uneven cement floor in the kitchen. Our tile dealer recommended putting down asphalt tile to smooth it over, then a self-stick vinyl tile over this. The floor has worn poorly and has bumps, nicks and scratches. What should be done to even it out? What can we put down other than ceramic tile that will last and be easy to keep clean? A.Putting down asphalt tile to smooth out a rough subfloor was a mistake; asphalt tile tends to follow the contours of the floor underneath and transmit them to the finished floor. It would be best to take all the tile up and have a professional install a proper underlayment to smooth out the bare floor. He can trowel on a latex compound sold for this purpose, or he might recommend a heavy felt underlayment. After this, the contractor can install a good grade of vinyl tile or vinyl sheet material. Both are easy to maintain and should last many years. Q.The stone foundation of my 100-year-old house is badly in need of repointing. However, several sources have said that I should avoid a ready-mix mortar or any other mix that contains portland cement because the hardness of such a mix could damage the stones over time. But no one seems to know what I should use. What do you suggest? A.This is the first time I have heard that assertion about mixes with portland cement. As far as I know, standard mortar mix, or in some cases patching cement mixed with a little hydrated lime, is what is recommended. I don't see how this can attack the natural stone. For more specific information, ask a local masonry supply house, or write the Portland Cement Association, Old Orchard Road, Skokie, Ill. 60076.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 77.42 points, at 1,950.43, but even this was an improvement over an earlier 140-point deficit. Trading opened with a blizzard of sell orders that caused many participants to expect a rout as complete as Monday's, but a number of factors helped the market to weather the storm. Volume eased somewhat to a still staggering 392.2 million. [ Page A1. ] The New York and American exchanges will shorten trading by two hours today and on Monday and Tuesday. The Chicago Board Options Exchange also said it would close early. [ D6. ] Unhappiness was expressed about the Big Board's decision to extend restrictions on the use of computer-aided program trading. [ D6. ] Foreign investors continued to hunt for bargains on Wall Street. And many expressed the opinion that some good might result from the plunge, especially if the budget deficit is cut. [ D1. ] Robert S. Prechter's advice reaches so many investors that he may influence the market. Many analysts say that a sell recommendation issued to his clients Wednesday night touched off the panic selling Thursday morning. [ D8. ] Small investors watched and waited cautiously as the market took another dive. [ D9. ] Wertheim Schroder was on the front line of the selling blitz, as the medium-sized brokerage firm stood ready to supply its own capital to accommodate trades. [ D7. ] A. B. Tompane & Company feared losses of more than $10 million from Monday's plunge when the specialist firm accepted Merrill Lynch's takeover offer. [ D7. ] Wall Street firms are telling clients to cut back on stocks or switch to safer, high-yielding equities, such as utilities. [ D7. ] Bowne's stock has been only slightly scorched in the plunge, even though medium-size printing company may seem vulnerable. [ D8. ] Working frantic 14-hour days since last Friday is beginning to take a psychological toll, some Wall Street workers say. [ D8. ] The forces at work in the market's frantic behavior are complicated and contradictory. Leonard Silk. Economic Scene. [ D2. ] The wave of stock buyback announcements continued, but some companies' stocks suffered reversals. Market Place. [ D12. ] OTHER MARKETS Short- and long-term interest rates declined sharply for the fourth consecutive day. The decline in stock prices contributed to a surge in bonds, which rose by more than three points. [ D1. ] The dollar closed mostly higher in domestic trading, and gold rose $1.25 an ounce, to $469, in late trading in New York. [ D19. ] The violent price swings in stock-index futures intensified, but the volume of trading in Chicago was relatively light. [ D19. ] THE ECONOMY President Reagan plans to meet with Congressional leaders to work on reducing the budget deficit. The President also said in a televised news conference that he had chosen Nicholas F. Brady to head a task force to investigate the securities exchanges. [ A1. ] A number of executives said they were encouraged by the President's expression of resolve to deal with the deficit. [ D12. ] Commercial banks lowered their prime rate to 9 percent, a drop of a quarter percentage point. The decrease was led by Citibank, and bankers predicted that rates would drop further.

It was probably inevitable that the current craze for making celebrities out of businessmen would one day give us a hybrid book like ''Tycoon'': part serious biography, part fan magazine. Funny that its subject would be Sir James Goldsmith, the takeover artist once described by a friend as ''Attila the Hun with financial genius.'' Geoffrey Wansell, a British journalist who has written a biography of Cary Grant, had Sir James's cooperation on this project, but the result is a book that is best read deep between the lines. The man who emerges is a shrewd, driven gambler of undeniable intelligence and astonishing luck. Even when he was repulsed in a celebrated 1986 bid to take over the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, he walked away with a profit estimated at $93 million. He can also be a tad temperamental - kicking his car, pouncing on a newspaper photographer, tossing his breakfast tray out a window when displeased by the orange juice. Mr. Wansell duly reports these outbursts and more, but seems to view them as evidence of the man's boyish charm. Sir James clearly plays by his own rules, and whatever else he has coming to him, he deserves a better biography.",1987-10-25T05:00:00+0000

As with most great panics, the market's dramatic drop was most likely precipitated by a convergence of economic and political doubts. Q. Why did all of this come to a head on Monday? A.

So far in the 80's, that tradition has spawned only one new star, Suzanne Vega, who will appear at Radio City Music Hall tomorrow and at the Ritz on Tuesday.

Of course there was 1929 with its Black Monday on Oct. 28. Then there was October 1987. This brutal month's third week completed the task of wiping out all the gains of what had been a stunningly bullish year. The week began with a Black Monday that eclipsed 1929's - the Dow lost an unbelievable 508 points, or 22.61 percent, with volume exceeding 600 million shares. The Dow gained back 102 points on Tuesday, with volume again above 600 million, but the strength was confined to the blue chips. Wednesday brought some encouragement, with the Dow posting a record gain of 186.84 points in a broad-based rally. Thursday had a panicky start but a rout was averted and the Dow ended down 77.42 points, in context a moderate loss. Friday's trading was curtailed by two hours and exhausted traders called it a draw, with the Dow virtually unchanged. The Dow began the week at 2,246.74 and finished at 1,950.76, a loss of 295.98, or 13.2 percent. The Dow began 1987 at 1,895.95 and peaked at 2,722.42 on Aug. 25.

us,IN SHORT,"THE FUTURE 500: Creating Tomorrow's Organizations Today. By Craig R. Hickman and Michael A. Silva. (NAL, $19.95.) Yesterday's exhortation for excellence in management is no longer enough, according to Craig R. Hickman, management consultant, and Michael A. Silva, a businessman. The next generation of corporate officers must be able to cope with paradox. ''The complexity manager should champion individuality and collective culture at the same time,'' the authors write. And they predict that what they call collaborative competition will replace head-to-head combat. Much of this analysis boils down to F. Scott Fitzgerald's dictum: ''The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.'' But in addition to their theory of complexity management, the authors sketch a valuable history of American business and management theory. Case histories of how successful companies have adapted and grown also help to make the authors' abstract points clear. It is difficult, however, to understand just how complexity management will actually work. Excellence, as a management concept, was straightforward and, probably because of that, was widely adopted as a goal for corporations. Whether executives will be stirred by the idea of complexity management remains to be seen. But the authors do make important points about the changing relationships among Government and business, the investor and the corporation and the individual and the organization.",1987-10-25T05:00:00+0000

A particularly dramatic shift in the trend of a major market virtually always constitutes a signal that a fundamental change in the associated environment has occurred or will soon occur. For example, the dramatic eruption of gold and silver prices in 1972-73 presaged an eight-year period of spiraling inflation, just as the breathtaking two-month 44 percent collapse of gold prices and the 75 percent price collapse of silver prices from the highs of January 1980 signaled that same period's end.",1987-10-25T05:00:00+0000

The book, written with the journalist Alan Furst, and subtitled ''How a Housewife's Chocolate Chip Recipe Turned Into a Multimillion-Dollar Business -The Story of Mrs. Fields Cookies,'' filled me with the dread sense of the path not taken. After all, Mrs. Fields grew up in the late 1950's in a tightly knit, middle-class Roman Catholic family - the youngest of five children. So did I. She was the sort of girl who never got A's in high school but who wore her school uniform so short that the nuns made her kneel to see if the hem touched the floor. So was I. As a kid, she spent rainy afternoons making chocolate chip cookies for her older siblings. So did I. But she grew up and rented a space in a California mall and began selling them. Now she's a very wealthy woman who can afford angora outfits and trips to Hawaii and who can order about employees all over the world, telling them the cookies are too hard or soft. ''It's productive, I think, to ask yourself what you enjoy, to take a close look at what you do in your free time,'' Mrs. Fields tells the legions of people who ask her how to make a million dollars. ''Somewhere in there a career is lurking.'' Now that the cookie idea is taken, I'm wondering whether I could get rich quick with those potholders I used to make to take the cookies out of the oven.

The 47-year-old Mr. Brodsky, who was deported from the Soviet Union in 1972 after serving 18 months in a labor camp for ''parasitism,'' is widely regarded as the best living Russian poet. ''This is an example of the Nobel Prize going to a really serious, committed, great poet,'' said the critic Susan Sontag.

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE PIANOPLAYERS, by Anthony Burgess. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $4.95.) Anthony Burgess's 29th novel is about a man, much like the author's own father, whose piano playing provides the real-time soundtrack for silent pictures; his career falls apart with the advent of a new technology called talkies. While Ph.D. candidates might not find the book as fulfilling as Mr. Burgess's more erudite works, Gene Lyons said here last year, its ''modest charms [ include ] its vivid re-creation of the humble joys of working-class Manchester and Blackpool during the 1920's.'' INTERVENTION: How America Became Involved in Vietnam, by George McT. Kahin. (Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95.) For many historians, the manner in which the United States became involved in the Vietnam War is a case study in how the machinery of decision-making can become loosed from its moorings and run like a mad automaton, bereft of the governing influence of reality testing. Drawing on his own interviews and previously classified documents, George McT. Kahin, who teaches international studies at Cornell University, ''has produced an illuminating work about a darkening series of decisions'' that led to America's intervention in Southeast Asia, The Times's Walter Goodman said last year. ''Opponents of the Reagan Administration's truculence toward Nicaragua cannot fail to find . . . a cautionary experience.'' THE ORANGING OF AMERICA: And Other Stories, by Max Apple. (Penguin, $5.95.) Max Apple's first book contains 10 good-natured satirical stories that unearth some of the unexamined oddities of American life. ''Apple's principal asset is his startling imagination,'' one reviewer said in 1976. ''He translates the most battered of our cultural cliches into glistening artifacts.'' THINKING BACK: The Perils of Writing History, by C. Vann Woodward. (Louisiana State University, $6.95.) In this retrospective, C. Vann Woodward, who has made a career of challenging accepted interpretations of the history of the American South, trains his revisionist instincts inward and takes a critical second look at his own career. The book is a ''fascinating meditation on the role of revisionism by a practitioner,'' Linda Orr said here in 1986. ''The original energy that comes from overturning long-accepted ways of seeing the past is still there.'' JANE, by Dee Wells. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) Jane, an American film critic living in London, tries to juggle three love affairs. In 1974, our reviewer, Margaret Drabble, said she felt a bit guilty about liking this ''slick, trendy'' first novel, but ''its sheer readability wins out.'' The author, she said, makes ''some serious comments on modern life, but, more important, her story and her jokes are good.'' COUNSELS OF WAR, by Gregg Herken. (Oxford University, $10.95.) Along with the development of atomic weapons has come an odd new breed of armchair warriors: the civilian scientists and strategists whose harrowing but dispassionate analyses attempt to provide a rational underpinning to nuclear war. This book ''provides a valuable survey of the main debates'' within the strategic community and ''a sense of the personalities of those who have taken part,'' Michael Mandelbaum said here in 1985. THE COLD STOVE LEAGUE, by Thomas Boyle. (Academy Chicago, $4.95.) An unsuspecting American comes to Portugal to help run a bar; instead, he finds himself caught up in an international web of murder and financial misdeeds spun by none other than the gnomes of Zurich, the secretive Swiss bankers who some paranoid investors accuse of manipulating the world economy. ''Most of the book manages to be believable,'' Newgate Callendar said here in 1984, ''and the writing is lively and fast-moving. Just the thing for a pleasant hour or two under a tree.'' UNDER SIEGE: P.L.O. Decisionmaking During the 1982 War, by Rashid Khalidi. (Columbia University, $12.50.) As a Palestinian and an Oxford-trained historian who knows Yasir Arafat, Rashid Khalidi was in a unique position to evaluate the Palestine Liberation Organization's strategy during the Israeli-Lebanese war. Through interviews and an examination of P.L.O. archives, the Columbia University historian has produced a ''generally objective, lucid and incisive account [ that ] fills a critical void in the literature about the Israeli invasion,'' The Times's Thomas L. Friedman said here in 1985. ''One cannot help but be struck by what a graveyard of illusions the 1982 war turned out to be.'' ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, by Peter Cameron. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $5.95.) In a story called ''Homework,'' a boy who is depressed about the death of his dog is pondering the ultimate algebraical conundrum: ''Find the value for n such that n plus everything else in your life makes you feel all right.'' But the problem, like others posed in Peter Cameron's collection of short stories, is unsolvable; the best his people can do to extricate themselves from life's entanglements is to lie to themselves and others. ''Characters can't ease their pain in Mr. Cameron's environment,'' Victor Kantor Burg said here last year, ''but they do engage in interesting deceptions.'' ON ACTING, by Laurence Olivier. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) When Laurence Olivier sat down to record his reflections on the nature of his craft, he was determined to avoid ''boring theatrical gossip.'' The result, Fritz Weaver said here last year, ''is the work everyone hoped we would have from him. . . . In Lord Olivier, perhaps more than any other actor of this century, significance lurks, mystical lights flash; one has a sense of the large past, a kinship with kings and ministers, heroes and monsters.''",1987-10-25T05:00:00+0000

Bilozerchev, 20 years old, won his second world individual title. He won his first at 16 in 1983. But an accident two years after that resulted in a compound fracture in his leg that threatened his career.

us,"Music View; A TALE OF TWO OPERAS, OR WHEN NOT TO INTERFERE","ABOUT HALFWAY INTO THE first scene of the Metropolitan Opera's new ''Rheingold'' on opening night, I became aware that surprisingly little of the staging was distracting my attention from Wagner's own shrewd way of telling his tale of moral decay and betrayal. So hardened have we become to seeing directors and designers intrude their daring little persons into opera productions that the absence of conceptual handstands and theatrical back flips can now be startling. Instead, as the premiere unfolded, I found myself absorbed as seldom before in the musical and narrative flow of this prelude to the ''Ring,'' which the Otto Schenk production was managing to clarify without resorting to cartoon jokes or specious updating. Not once during the evening did Loge pull out the Harvard Law Review. Alberich the exploiter of the colonial masses did not dress up as Uncle Sam or John Bull. Wotan and Fricka were depicted as epic but recognizably human figures, not as soapy caricatures of Ron and Nancy playing scenes from ''Dallas.'' (If no ''Ring'' director has thought of those images as yet, forgive me for suggesting them.) Nowadays, I am always taken aback to find a director showing faith enough in an opera to let the composer and his librettist have it their way. In this ''Rheingold,'' I found myself willingly overlooking many a minor flaw that might have drawn heavy, scornful attention in a more faddish staging. Take the bit of business in which Loge and Wotan trick Alberich into turning himself into a toad so they can capture him and steal his gold. This is one of those transformation scenes whose magical effect the perfect, unreconstructed Wagnerite waits for with childlike expectation, usually in vain. It should not be difficult to manage lighting cues and trapdoors so that the conspirators' net is thrown over a tiny, toady object that thereafter grows immediately into the larger toad known as Alberich. But here the trick was botched again: Alberich already appeared full-grown (or as full-grown as a dwarf can be) by the time the net fell on him. But, in the context of a seriously conceived and remarkably well sung ''Rheingold,'' such details almost deserve to be ignored.",1987-10-25T05:00:00+0000

Not since just after the Depression has there been so much talk about the need to restructure the nation's financial system. Several grand plans have been suggested, but perhaps none so intriguing as that put forward by Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in ''What Should Banks Do?'' The book will be bedtime reading only for the Paul Volckers and Walter Wristons of this world, but Mr. Litan, nevertheless, offers a highly readable history of banking regulation, a discussion of the pros and cons of further deregulation and credible arguments why his concept of banking might work. This concept -''narrow banking'' or safe banking - involves splitting banks as we know them into two distinct entities. The narrow bank is essentially a Government-insured money-market fund, through which the bank takes deposits and invests in Government securities. Since the Government is considered fail-safe, there's no risk here to the public's deposits, and bank failures would be almost nonexistent. The other part of the bank, in Mr. Litan's scheme, would be nearly totally deregulated. It would be free to do everything banks now do, such as business and consumer lending, and everything else it might want to do, from underwriting to real estate developing, even manufacturing. The Litan formula answers many concerns about the further deregulation of banking, but implementing it would be a radical step for a halting Congress.",1987-10-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Mario Merola and the Election,"Mario Merola, who served for 15 years as District Attorney of the Bronx, demonstrated competence, honesty and public spirit. Despite his sudden death on Tuesday he remains on the ballot on the Democratic, Republican and Liberal lines in next Tuesday's general election. Voters can honor his memory by casting votes in his name. A majority for him would block Thomas Lavin, a relatively unknown candidate of the Conservative Party. Governor Cuomo could then appoint a replacement for Mr. Merola, allowing qualified candidates to campaign for election next November. In other Bronx races: Fernando Ferrer (D-L) has been serving with distinction as Borough President since his selection by the Bronx City Council members. He deserves voter support to fill out the remaining two years of the term of Stanley Simon, who resigned under a cloud. Jose Rivera (D-L) has our endorsement to complete Mr. Ferrer's term on the council. Lee Holzman (D-R), highly qualified in surrogate law, warrants election to the post of Surrogate, now vacant. Frank Torres (D-R-L), a civil court judge, and Joseph Giamboi (R-C), an experienced litigator, are well qualified for the two vacant seats on the Supreme Court bench. For Civil Court in the First District (Northeast Bronx), Douglas E.

Why does President Reagan's space defense program seem to give Soviet leaders and strategists so much political trouble, especially if so many on both sides believe it cannot work for 20 or 30 years? A. . . . It is not a matter of political obstacles caused to the Soviet leadership. The thing is, we are deeply convinced that creating a space-based ABM defense to cover the territory of the United States would radically step up the military threat toward the Soviet Union. In that case, the United States would have the strategic defense of its territory, which according to the opinion of the U.S. Administration is intended to defend only the United States from an attack on the part of the Soviet Union.",1987-10-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Dining Out Guide: New Uptown,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. CAFE GRECO, #1390 Second Avenue, at 72d Street (737-4300) - **(Aug. 21, 1987) A pretty little bar up front and an informal dining room with ocher walls, high ceilings and tall arching windows that look out on a lighted backyard garden provide the setting for a melange of Mediterranean cuisines. Starter options are carpaccio of salmon, glossed with olive oil and basil, and a tart layered with eggplant, tomato and zucchini. For a main dish, the chef has a masterly touch with seafood, such as a grilled salmon wth a zesty sauce of roasted red peppers, black olives and tarragon. Also recommended are medallions of lamb with a stock sauce. Entrees $15.50 to $19.50. Fridays, 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 4 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M. COASTAL, #300 Amsterdam Avenue, at 74th Street (769-3988) - **(June 12, 1987) A serious new fish house on the Upper West Side, this contemporary glass-fronted restaurant has a stainless-steel bar and aqua-colored walls covered with a coastline mural. If you can take the decibels, the rewards are considerable: vibrant little ceviche appetizers served in a large mussel shell; lobster bisque, and New England clam chowder. The broiled and sauteed seafood entrees are all recommended - from halibut with a choice of sauces to broiled grouper with Provencal sauce. Entrees $12.50 to $19. Fridays and Saturdays, 6 to 11:30 P.M.; Sundays, 11:45 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 6 to 10 P.M. EAST, 1420 Third Avenue, at 80th Street (472-3975) - *(March 20, 1987) This handsome, countrified Japanese restaurant features an entertaining setting with low-slung communal tables and a knee-deep pit for those who find eating in the lotus position less than comfortable. You might begin with an assortment of sushi, maki rolls or sashimi. The best main course choices are salmon teriyaki with picked ginger garnish; any of the grilled fish options, and chicken teriyaki. Main dishes $8.50 to $20. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 5 to 11:15 P.M ; Saturdays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5 to 11:15 P.M.; closed Sundays. LE FESTIVAL, #134 East 61st Street (838-7987) - **(Dec. 26, 1986) The dining room is soft and comfortable with rust-colored banquettes to punctuate the gray-felt decor, and the all-seafood theme is a timely idea. The Mediterranean fish soup is a very good starter, with morsels of snapper and bass in a saffron fish stock. For a main dish, you might choose dariole of salmon, with julienne of vegetables and set atop tomato beurre blanc; ravioli stuffed with lobster and wild mushrooms with sauteed chanterelles, or a straightforward grilled Dover sole with mustard sauce. Dinner prix fixe $40. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. PRIMOLA, #1226 Second Avenue, at 64th Street (758-1775) - **(Feb. 20, 1987) One of the more spirited and alluring Upper East Side restaurants is this Italian venture with yellow walls holding watercolors and poster art, wood wainscoting and pretty flower clusters. The menu is extensive and specials abound. You might start with a half order of pasta, perhaps the thin fedelini primavera or spinach gnocchi with a gratineed mozzarella and tomato sauce. Main course selections include grilled giant shrimp with lemon, garlic and oregano; veal sauteed with wild mushrooms, and seared baby lamb chops. Entrees $11.50 to $20.50. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5 to midnight; Saturdays, 5 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, 5 to 11 P.M. VIOLETTA, 1590 First Avenue, at 83d Street (517-7090) - **(July 3, 1987) The two narrow dining rooms that make up this little East Side Italian restaurant are long on charm and short on elbow room; they feature salmon-toned walls, mirrors and expansive floral arrangements. Most of the pastas are recommended, and options include fusilli in cream sauce with pancetta and peas, as well as spaghetti with white clam sauce. For a main dish, you might order a double thick veal chop in mustard sauce; the mixed grill of chicken, sausage and cubes of beef in lusty garlic sauce, or red snapper fillet alla Livornaise, with black olives, capers, tomato and herbs. Entrees $15 to 25. Fridays and Saturdays, 5 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, 4 to 11 P.M. What the stars mean, page C24.",1987-10-30T05:00:00+0000

Though in no way ''major,'' he was a quirkful, many-sided and persistently inventive performer who was close to many of the most gifted people of his day and enjoyed their respect and affection. (Marcel Duchamp said that Demuth was great company because ''he didn't care where he belonged, or was, in the social scale.'' And Georgia O'Keeffe, no pushover when it came to a lasting friendship, prized Demuth as someone who was great fun to be with and ''a better friend with me than any of the other artists.'') When he had heroes, living or dead, they were the right ones, and he found new ways of celebrating them. He was a creative reader who did not so much illustrate what he read as take off from it in ways that have kept their fascination intact. Though probably still best known as a painter of flowers and fruit - and superabundantly represented in that context in his current retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art - he was also a pioneer painter (and simplifier) of the American industrial landscape.",1987-10-30T05:00:00+0000
