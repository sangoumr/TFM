us,'Train to Rob':McLaglen Work Opens With 'Lost Flight',"Andrew V. McLaglen's ""One More Train to Rob,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, falls into the tradition of the amiable westerna tradition in which lots of good feeling and jocular comradeship alternates with lots of shoot-em-up. Some of the greatest westerns have been made and are being made in this tradition, and though there is a question as to how many corpses you can reconcile with how much happy glow, that question tends to recede in the presence of a John Ford or a Howard Hawks, and only to emerge in the work of such a lesseralthough amiableimitator as McLaglen.""One More Train to Rob"" concerns a pair of slippery friends (George Peppard and John Vernon), the woman they love and are variously untrue to (Diana Muldaur), a troop of expendable hired guns, and a shipment of gold from a Chinese mining camp to safekeeping in a San Francisco bank. The plot, built out of these elements, is more than usually complex, and the characters who act it out are more than usually completeand where the movie seems to go wrong is neither in its plot or its people but in McLaglen's inability to bring both into a combination that more than hints the vitality it means to exploit.Because it is too lax, too slow, too mechanical, too timid in its inventions, ""One More Train to Rob"" never becomes funny. And because it never becomes funny it has no way really to contain or control the violence that is its other side and that falls after a while from the level of rugged amiability to mere blood lust.I have the feeling that McLaglen rather under-directs his actorsas if George Peppard were John Wayne and could fill in the gaps for himself and for everybody else. John Vernon, who seemed so admirable in ""Topaz,"" becomes under this regime stolid, predictable and finally, very dull.At some theaters ""One More Train to Rob"" is being accompanied by a slightly aged movie called ""Lost Flight,"" directed by Leonard J. Horn and dealing with an airliner that while flying from Hawaii to Australia is forced to ditch near an uninhabited island in the South Pacific.Anybody knowing this much and learning that the plane carries, among others, a brutish businessman, his unhappy mistress, two nuns, a black militant, a black nonmilitant, a racist, a marriage almost on the rocks, a pilot facing dismissal for his quick temper, assorted beautiful young girls, a medical student, a pregnant woman and a little boy suffering from acute appendicitisanybody learning all this will think he has the goods on ""Lost Flight."" But in fact it is a reasonably entertaining, well-paced, technically ambitious movie that receives great assistance from its performersnotably Lloyd Bridges (the pilot) for good, Ralph Meeker (the businessman) for evil, and Anne Francis (the mistress) for marriage and the family.",1971-06-03T05:00:00+0000

Penitentiaries and asylums, as we think of them now, are not ancient institutions.

The insane were kept at home or tended by neighbors; if violent, they were locked in attics and cellars. Orphans, de linquents and the poor were likewise cared for at home whenever possible; the com munity paid toward their support and built almshouses for them only as a last resort if homes were available.

In regard to the master's de grees being passed around so freely by these enterprises, as well as by others in Latin America, those looking for academic positions with such pieces of paper might find that their hopes will not match reality. The fact is that these Mexican credit mills do not enjoy any recognition on the part of the Mexican Gov ernment and their degrees do not legally qualify anyone to practice a profession in Mexico; nor are college credits granted by them recognized by Mexican institutions of higher education.

The urgent hold of Prague on the Western world is a mys terybut Prague itself is per vasive and mysterious. Some of us have known the city for lifetimes. We have lived in it, loved it, suffered with or be cause of it, as love decrees one must suffer at times. Prague is a part of ourselves that we can never root out.

It is a sec, coldeyed, underplayed pitiless assessment of an aging, imperious woman playing a fanciful game that sud denly gets out of hand and of a man in dangerous waters and clearly out of his depth. No one was more in error in judging his own worth than Essex, and no one ?? more dearly for the mistake. Technically his death sentence was due to the revolt he thought he was heading in the winter of 1601. But, as Mr. Lacey tells it, it was such a Mack Sennett affair, so ludicrous in what it professed, so creaky and inadequate in operation, that a juster sentence would have been to dress up the man in motley and set him in the stocks. The ignominy of a custard pie in the eye would have achieved more in bringing the man to his senses than the separation of his head from his body. But I suppose armed insurrection to the Elizabethans was no laughing affair. The excesses of the War of the Roses were still warm in the memory of the Queen and her council. After all, it was Henry Tudor, Elizabeth's grandfather, who finally brought a little quiet to the kingdom and that was not such a long time ago. ",1971-06-09T05:00:00+0000

us,"Morrow's Western, 'A Man Called Sledge,' Opens","""How much gold?""""Enough for a man to die on: More than that, maybe."" Thus the subject and the theme are indicated very early on in Vic Morrow's ""A Man Called Sledge,"" which isn't quite an Italian western (Morrow and most of his leading cast are, of course, Americans) though it was produced in Italy, and though it has in common with many Italian westerns that it cares mostly about its theme and not so much about the people or the places or the sociology or the mythic potential of the old American West.All of which leads to a certain abstractness in movies like ""A Man Called Sledge,"" and though, one may add, a certain purity as well, the end result is really a certain dullnessfor no universal theme can, taken by itself, make up for the people and the places and even the mythic potential that might find their way into any less single-minded fiction.The gold in question is part of a regular shipment sent from the mine in an armed convoy so cautious that it travels only by day, and by night holes up in such unfortunate hiding places as the maximum security cell block of a prison where Sledge (James Garner), guided by The Old Man (John Marley), takes his band of outlaws to steal it. They do, and then set about learning the bitter lesson  more convincing in literature than in life  that gold cannot buy happiness and the wages of sin is death.That really is the point to ""A Man Called Sledge,"" and it is not such an interesting point that a very good movie can come from it despite Mr. Morrow's fancy directing and destiny-driven dialogue. I should say that at almost any given moment ""A Man Called Sledge"" is a bit better than most Italian westerns and quite a bit better than many recent American westerns  and that it is still not good enough to satisfy the demands of its type.In a movie so given to decorative technique and to purple patches at one level or another, it may seem unfair to pick and choose. But I was especially taken with two sequences. One involves the mounted troops guarding the goldwho at the sound of a horn take up a variety of fancy formations that do more to recall the Spanish Riding School than the Old Frontier, but that are nevertheless fun to watch. The other is the final shoot-outin a deserted, sun-baked Mexican town full of menacing alleys and meaningful junctures. This is not so much a film location as symbolic space, and one need only squint through politically colored glasses to see it in the form of the radical didactic cinema of Glauber Rocha.",1971-06-10T05:00:00+0000

The picture is a solid, graphic job by Hollywood professionals that holds interest all the way.The deserter is an Army captain, shattered by the Apache's horrible mutilation of his wife (an opening that will chill you), who takes to the old Southwest hills as a one-man Indian butcher. The story shifts gears. The Army now uses him to mastermind a patrol trek deep into Apache territory.The real star of the picture is the screen writer, Clair Huffaker, trimly etching character and building suspense on the trail, with scorching dialogue spewed by a good, bristling male cast. It's hard to believe but Bekim Fehmiu, having survived a marshmallow blob titled ""The Adventurers,"" is excellent as the deserter, toughest and meanest of the snarling pack.John Huston is wonderfully effective as an earthy Army general. Let's forgive him for ""Myra Breckenridge"" here and now. The other iron-jaws are fine, especially Albert Salmi and Woody Strode. And encompassing it all, in a sun-baked, craggy sweep of color, is the steady, keen-edged direction of Burt Kennedy.For all the mayhem, this picture graphically equates human ferocity with an irony just as terrible, never spelling it out.",1971-06-10T05:00:00+0000

Scott, as a once-brilliant, now lunatic New York judge, who believes he's Sherlock Holmes, meets Joanne Woodward, a spinsterish psychiatrist whose name is Dr. Watson, my toes tingled, then imperceptibly curled. The sensation was not entirely unpleasant.A little later, the couple encounter a small colony of eccentrics who have escaped the real world by taking refuge in the balcony of a movie theater that shows only Westerns. Holmes tells Watson she should try to smile. She does. The patient cures the doctorand my balance became uncertain. My ears buzzed.Still later, Holmes, accompanied by Watson, who is now in love with him, comes upon a nutty old pair who have found love and peace sculpturing shrubbery, holed up in a Front Street loft since 1939. The initial sense of odd intoxication had turned into acute discomfort. I almost blacked outlike a canary in a badly ventilated coal mine.""They Might Be Giants,"" which opened yesterday in the air-conditioned Beekman Theater, is an almost drunkenly sentimental comedy about the lazy capitulation of the sanes to the old-fashioned crazies, a romantic concept that not only needs the skills of a director like Frank Capra and a writer like Robert Riskin, but also an audience whose sensibilities are about 35 years more naive than can be easily faked today.There is, indeed, something not so innocently simple-minded in this fable, which enobles retreat in the name of the sort of mysticism with which the Duchess of Windsor, once explained the downfall of an emperor. ""The heart,"" she wrote at some length, without saying very much, ""has its reasons.""""They Might Be Giants,"" directed by Anthony Harvey and written by James Goldman, who earlier collaborated on ""A Lion in Winter,"" is a mushy movie with occasional, isolated moments of legitimate comedy, all provided by Mr. Scott with an assist by Mr. Goldman, whose sense of humor seems to surface in peripheral incidents only.There is something pixilatedand I use the word advisedlyin the sight of Mr. Scott, dressed in his cape and his deerstalker, trying to teach Miss Woodward, who is supposed to sign his commitment papers, how to ""creep"" properly along a crowded New York sidewalk.There is another moment of decent madness when Holmes invades the offices of the New York Telephone Company, and leaves at least one operator in tears. But this scene, like the entire movie, eventually goes soft, which seems to be the fate of comediesthings like ""The Madwoman of Chaillot""  that prattle on about the joys of individualism and demonstrate mostly witless arrogance.A common denominator of all of Mr. Scott's performances is the sense of mad possession of the actor by his role, and this gives the movie a certain strength denied by the lines Mr. Goldman has written for him""The earth is shining under the soot!"" cries Holmes in an apocalyptic moment toward the end. Miss Woodward acts as straight-woman to her costar, and most of the other actors are distressingly cute.",1971-06-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Japanese Saga:Feudal Spirit Survives in 'Band of Assassins',"""Band of Assassins"" picks up the story of Japan in 1863 and drops it in the spring of 1868, a few months before it was previously picked up by last week's ""Red Lion."" It is just possible that by following the fortunes of Tohshiro Mifune at the Bijou, program after program, one might progress by brief forward spurts through the whole saga of the Japanese nationin reverse. Of course Mifune dies (the question in these movies is never ""whether,"" but only ""how""), but if he keeps on dying several years before each previous death he will achieve a kind of immortal mortality good at least until the dawn of recorded Eastern history.The film's time span covers the last years of the Tokugawa shogunate, the last gasp of the feudal spirit, the last vain struggle to close Japan to modernization and foreign influence. Very little of this seems to get into the film overtly (at least, as well as I can make out by the subtitles), except that the final battle is fought by swords against cannon and rifles. But I think a good deal does get in covertly, and it furnishes the main interest in what is otherwise no better, no livelier, no more subtle and no less bloody a movie than any of the other samurai dramas we have for some time been seeing.Mifune, a farmer turned samurai, joins and eventually leads a band loyal to the emperor and dedicated to eliminating, generally by mass murder, extremist elements of whose loyalties I am not altogether sure.Mifune is strict, severe, solemn, and much given to staring down destinyas evidenced in the portentous profiles that seem to be his favorite way of being photographed in close-up. I don't know what historical status his character has, but its mythic status, like the tremendously solid presence of Mifune himself, is clear enough. He means to transform history, to translate it into personalityand though his films are full of other able, powerful men, they are no more than their ability or power. Only Mifune lives fate inwardly.But ""Band of Assassins"" knows its time as well as its timelessness, and Tadashi Sawahima, whose name is not familiar, seems to have directed in terms of traditional visual styles. Sometimes his work looks like Ichikawa, sometimes it looks like Ozu, but more often it looks like a tribute to the Japanese print and to the arrangements of space in Japanese architecture. I think this tribute is deliberate, and rather lovely. And although it is eventually submerged in the habitual pieties of the Mifune enterprise, it suggests for a while a spirit and a style that is deeper, more delicate and surely more durable than the heavy heroics for which it serves as a backdrop.",1971-06-11T05:00:00+0000

And then: No sooner had the warm liquid, and the crumbs with it, touched my palate, wrote Marcel Proust at the beginning of his monumental, semiautobiographical novel, Re membrance of Things Past, than a shudder ran through my whole body, and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary changes that were taking place. He was not reacting to strychnine. The shudder was a thrill of recognition, for Marcel had suddenly remembered the same taste of tea and madeleines from years before. And with that memory came a flood of other vivid childhood recollections. Out of this accidental collision of cooky and consciousness, Proust constructed his esthetic philosophy, his celebrated theory that art is a way of conquering space and time, of achiev ing immortality through remembered tastes and smells and feelings. And now, exactly 100 years after his birth, Proust's own immortality is assured. The literary world is virtually un animous in acclaiming him as France's greatest modern writer.

Our operations and progress in Laos constitute one step along the route. Our directness and rapidity of reaction, in bombing North Vietnamese installations and deploying U.S. combat forces to Southeast Asia were others. Each step played a part. Their effect was to in terrupt the continually improving Com munist posture, catch the imagination of the Southeast Asian peoples, provide some lift to morale, however temporary, and force CHICOM/DRV assessment or reassessment of U.S. intentions. But these were only steps along the way. What we have not done and must do is make plain to Hanoi and Peiping the cost of pursuing their current objectives and impeding ours. An essential element of our military action in this course is to proceed in the development of our physical readiness posture: deploying troops, ships, aircraft, and logistic re sources in a manner which accords a maximum freedom of action. This is the thrust we should continue to pursue, one which is intended to provide more than one feasible course for considera tion as the changed and changing South east Asian situation develops. Remarks in the paragraphs which follow are sub mitted in light of this assessment and with the view that pressures against the other side once instituted should not be relaxed by any actions or lack of them which would destroy the bene fits of the rewarding steps previously taken in Laos and North Vietnam.",1971-06-13T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Unman, Wittering and Zigo'","I think it was Franois Truffaut who said that he could usually tell within the first five minutes whether or not a movie was any good. In the history of connoisseurship this ploy may be worth recording, but for practical criticism I doubt that it has much to recommend itignoring as it does movies that take a while to find themselves (at least in the viewer's mind), and movies that from a position of relative strength work inexorably toward a condition of absolute, unredeemable loss.In the latter category belongs John Mackenzie's ""Unman, Wittering and Zigo,"" which opened yesterday at Cinema II, and which begins full of ripe and gruesome promise that very shortly turns overripe and openly ridiculous.Unman, Wittering and Zigo are the last three names on the roll call for Lower 5B, a form full of malignant malcontents at Chantry, a second-rate British public school, where young John Ebony (David Hemmings), fresh from the disillusionments of a job in advertising, has come to teach. His appointment is something of a fluke, his predecessor having died in midterm from a tumble down a nearby cliff, and almost no time at all is lost before the gentlemen of Lower 5B inform their new master that the death was no accident; his predecessor was pushed, and they did the pushing.Ebony's problem, as Lower 5B knows full well, is that if he reports the murder, nobody will believe him (he doesn't, at first, believe it himself), but if he keeps quiet and does a few favors for the classnot much work, decent grades for those who want them, bets placed and winnings collected from the local bookie, etc.they will protect his academic career and perhaps let him survive the semester as well.A modus vivendi, the boys call it, but one that fails when Ebony learns that his appointment is not to be renewed and that he has, at Chantry, no academic career to protectbut only his own sanity and the well-being and perhaps respect of a wife (Carolyn Seymour) who is not long on wifely indulgence. It is when this happens, when the mood has all been built and the story begins to move, that ""Unman, Wittering and Zigo"" really falls apart, though it had never been too well glued from the beginning.But at the beginning it is easy to make excuses. And Mackenzie's spectacularly subjective camera and his Latin-encrusted boys' school and even his Lower 5B, which speaks in unison or to instantaneous cuelike some evil, over-trained minstrel troupeinvite if not the willing suspension of disbelief at least the expectation of pleasurable surrender to efficient nonsense. When that expectation is not satisfied, when the movie becomes too absurd in its inventions and too indifferent in how it works them out, the failure seems of more than ordinary proportions.Most of the performances are good, up to the level asked of them. David Hemmings's neophyte master suggests enthusiasm without sentimentality, and the boys mostly manage to project malevolence minus any regrets for their lost innocence. Nicholas Hoye as Cloistermouth, the prettiest of the fallen angels, is especially scary. Carolyn Seymour plays the young wife as if she were competing for the Glenda Jackson award in emotional reserve. But when the chips are down and she must show some feeling, it becomes apparent that there isn't any reserve; there is only no emotion.",1971-06-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Books of The Times,"Without any ands, ifs or buts, let it be said that Pierre Salinger has written a su perior suspense novel that is thoroughly absorbing, splendidly plotted and scrupul ously written. And he has done it by mak ing the suspense derive not from gore, mayhem and derringdo, although the book has its share of these, but from the haz ards of political maneuvering, the clash of ideologies and from the natural complex ity that is inherent in all human situa tions. Although it can and surely will he classed as an entertainment, his book has a darkly se rious side, with a conclusion that may not please everyone. But I can't imagine anyone who will not be pleased along the way. It reveals an ex pertise that rings true on every page. Wheth er the incidents are true, whether govern ment procedures, for eign policy and party maneuvering are shaped as the book says, deponent knoweth not. But they certainly carry a great deal of conviction. After all, Mr. Salinger was press secretary to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. The writing and dialogue are crisp and always to the point. As a former newspaperman, who knows what it is to face a parcel of predatory copy editors, he never wastes a word. All his sentences are fundamental. This qual ity speeds the story along and leaves the reader with the feeling that something is happening on every page. True, his char acters run to types. They are neither high ly original, nor very complicated, and he has leavened the text with some melodra matic exchanges. But these are not defects.

us,"Screen: Nicholson's 'Drive, He Said':Movie Marks Actor's Debut as Director Tale of College Athlete Opens at Tower East","""Drive, He Said,"" loosely adapted by Jeremy Larner and Jack Nicholson from Larner's 1964 Delta Prize novel, and directed by Nicholson (his directorial debut), comes close to being the sort of movie about the anxieties and dilemmas of the sixties that no one ever made in the sixtieswhich were constantly confused with the more innocent fifties. It is not a great film, but it is an often intelligent one, and it is so much better than all of the rest of the campus junk Hollywood has manufactured in the last couple of years that it can be indulged its sentimental conventions.Specifically, it's about a star college athlete, Hector Bloom, to whom basketball is what boxing is to Private Prewitt what playwriting maybe to Tennessee Williams and what risking an arm or a leg or a life probably is to Peter Gimbel. Like some forms of art, it is, simultaneously, a heightened response to the world, a mystical retreat from it, and a practical way of getting along in it.In the course of his senior year, Hector begins to feel, in his word, disconnected. The old game doesn't quite mean what it once did. He is more than a little surprised to find that he is in love with Olive, the professor's wife with whom he's been having an affair, and he is shocked when the joy of his discovery isn't shared by Olive, who is not so simply pregnant.Hector admires and envies the campus radicals, who are so committed to a cause that they can interrupt a basketball game for an anti-Vietnam demonstration, staged as guerrilla theater. He himself hasn't the faintest idea where he is going or why. When a pro ball club asks him to sign, he demands only that the club improve the quality of the frankfurters it sells to the public, and cut the price from 50c to a quarter.In fact, Hector is so disconnectedat least in terms of the character as writtenthat it comes as a major surprise, late in the film, to learn that he is a Greek major. This bit of information, which I assume is presented seriously, is as unsettling as learning that someone you thought you knew extremely well is, in reality, one-half of a pair of twins. It means that an important (or, at the least, a time-consuming) part of Hector's life has been kept secret.Also fairly secret is Hector's state of mind, though William Tepper, a tall, dark-haired young man who may or may not have studied the collected works of Dustin Hoffman, defines well enough Hector's individual attitudes of frustration, anger and what might be called romantic campus lassitude. A reading of Larner's novel fills in a lot of these gaps, but otherwise the novel might mislead the filmgoer into expecting satiric fantasy (which the movie never achieves), having to do with unnamed wars (not in Vietnam), with a lot of bizarre characters who might have been created by Waugh, and with middle-class American-Jewish intellectual and social life.One result of this secrecyperhaps simplification is a better termsis that most of the other characters in the film, just because they are the supporting characters in the film as well as in Hector's life, are more thoroughly and quickly defined, and thus more vivid and appealing than Hector. I especially liked Karen Black as the besieged Olive, a woman who once might have ben fated to be misunderstood and badly used by men, but who finally liberates herself; Robert Towne, as her husband, who would prefer to dry his beard with an electric comb than wory about cuckoldry; Bruce Dern, as the intensely clean-living coach, and Michael Margotta, who looks like a young Elisha Cook Jr., as Hector's radical roommate whose ultimate act of survival provides the film with its obligatory, if shopworn, irony.Most importantly, al of the film's characters, and all of the performances, are touched with the kind of unexpected sensibility and decency that are rare in most films of this genre. It's a quality that I associate with the performances Nicholson himself gave in both ""Easy Rider"" and ""Five Easy Pieces."" Nicholson not only is good with actors, but he also chooses to avoid most of the visual (and aural) clichs of the day, and when he does indulge himselfas in the fine basketballl sequencesthey no longer seem clichs since the rhythm of the sport more or less demands the treatment. I wish I could report that Hector was as interesting as the film that surrounds him.",1971-06-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Fellini's Affectionate Memoir Unfolds:'The Clowns' Recollects Circus Experiences Director and Entourage Seek Out Performers,"At its best moments, which constitute approximately one-third of its running time, Federico Fellini's ""The Clowns"" is a lovely footnotealmost a coda, reallyto a career that, like some of the circus extravaganzas his movies often resemble, has evolved inside three distinct rings. His first films have their roots in post-war Italian neo-realism. Then, in the mid-fifties, came the unique poetic neo-realism of ""La Strada"" and ""Nights of Cabiria,"" a style that gradually gave waythrough films like ""La Dolce Vita"" and ""8""to the triumphantly neo-surreal ""Satyricon"" last year.""The Clowns,"" which Fellini made for Italian television, is an affectionate memoir, a lyrical documentary in which Fellini himself, often on-screen as movie ringmaster eulogizes his lost fantasy world. He evokes the circuses he saw as a boy, especially the clowns who terrified him, spends some time in Paris interviewing surviving clowns, and finally stages an elaborate, mock, clown funeral that ends, as all Fellini films end, in a kind of reconciliation with fate.If I admired Fellini less, I might have admired ""The Clowns"" more. As it is, I didn't dislike itit would be impossible to dislike a film so full of good spirits, so full of love, a show that on occasion virtually erupts with brilliance. I'm not talking about brilliance of dcor, because, indeed, it's this kind of brilliance that makes me uneasy.""The Clowns"" is the movie that seems to give cause to those critics who have described Felliniincorrectlyas a master of spectacular, superficial effect and sentimentality. This, they are likely to say, is his greatest film, simply because this is all there is. I disagree.The first section of ""The Clowns"" is pure enchantment as Fellini recalls his earliest memories of circuses, of people being buried alive for days, of very masculine female wrestlers with names like Miss Tarzan and Miss Matilde, of clowns whose existences were an unending series of physical assaultsmashed fingers, gouged eyes, split skulls, and the like.For the child Fellini, as well as for the adult movie director, the clowns weren't really funny. They reminded him of the village idiot who made obscene propositions to the farm women, of the crazy midget nun who spent her time doing missions that the saints would entrust to no one else, of the pompous stationmaster whom schoolboys could effectively torment with insults no more mortal than Bronx cheers.In the film's second section, which might have been subtitled Pretended Pirandellian Reality Recalled, Fellini goes to Paris attended by his staff, including such real-life clowns as a beautiful dumb-blonde secretary named Maya, who can't withdraw a piece of paper from the typewriter without tearing it, and his wardrobe mistress, a woman with the face of a rumpled Modigliani, who exists only to look scenically comic in a mink coat somewhat too large.In simulated cinema vrit style, Fellini, his secretary, wardrobe mistress, cameraman and soundman pretend to interview survivors of the Age of The Circus, ""discovering"" them at their homes, or eavesdropping on their arguments about who was the greatest White Clown. We sometimes see the camera that is recording it all, and there is a good deal of talk about whether or not the circus deserved to die, but the film is clearly vamping until time for its finale.At this point, ""The Clowns"" almost recoups with its riotous funeral for Auguste, the legendary low clown of clown ritual, the butt of the elegant White Clown's jokes, the clown whom Fellini describes as a ""sub-proletarian image,"" a clown ""capable of revolt but not of revolution.""As Fellini sits on the sidelines watching the funeral go to pieces in strictly clown terms, a journalist asks him what he means to say in this new film. Fellini starts to answer and a bucket falls over his head rather abruptly. The movie director, obviously, is not only ringmaster and White Clown, but also the ridiculous Auguste.The funeral carries on in little explosions of mounting chaos, confusion and confetti, reaching, at last (and I do mean at last, since the show carries on somewhat longer than can be supported by the quality of the spectacle), those moments of the end of ""Cabiria"" and ""8.""There are fire engines, cannons, procession of clowns, clowns dancing with each other, even the front halves of clown-horses dancing with their rear-ends. The marvelous Nino Rota music ( a lot of it from ""Juliet of the Spirits"") wells up and, although there shouldn't have been, there were at least two dry eyes yesterday at the Lincoln Art Theater, where ""The Clowns"" opened.It's not that ""The Clowns"" is not a good deal of fun, or that it is boring; it's just thatto me, anywaythis sort of coda doesn't do justice to the entire career. It acknowledges Fellini's debt to theater, to masquerade and masks, to the magic of fantasy (which is only harnessed madness), but this is only a small aspect of his discipline, which can be both more interesting and more adventurous.",1971-06-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Who Is Harry Kellerman . . . ?' at the Sutton:Grosbard Is Director of Gardner Work Hoffman Takes Role of a Success-Flop,"Georgia Soloway (Dustin Hoffman) is on top of the world and about to jump offeven though, for all intents and purposes, he owns it. He is the country's most successful rock composer (64 songs in one year, not including two peace marches, a commercial and a cancer jingle). He lives in a Fifth Avenue triplex to which women feel honored to be lured, at any hour, at the last minute.His Brooklyn Jewish parents, who have the gloomy optimism of Ocean Avenue philosophers, make no unreasonable demands on him, and he has successfully unloaded a wife whom he only married because she was pregnant, and who rewarded him with two children and a companionship of the sort of frowns that would be a bit too heavy even for an Anacin commercial.He has also made the cover of Time, which may not be certified immortality, though it comes close to it in George's world. He is, nevertheless, isolated, pursued by a sense of panic, as well as by someone named Harry Kellerman who calls up Georgie's friends and tells them what a rat he is.""Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?"", directed by Ulu Grosbard and written by Herb Gardner, belongs to a species of comedy that I always associate with Broadway, even ifas sometimes happensthe locale is not in Manhattan.It is very glib, very funny in short takes and rather tedious and predictable in long ones, and it virtually kills itself trying to convince us that life at the top is even more anxious, more empty, than is life at the bottom, or at the middle. It does, indeed, sound very much like a comedy that was written by someone who has hit the top, or whatever he considers the top to be, and then suffered that form of the psychic bends that is best treated by being written about.Mr. Gardner, who hit the top, at least in Broadway terms, with ""A Thousand Clowns,"" has a real but narrow talent for the creation of eccentric characters who define themselves by wisecracks  the self-deprecating kind (""I feel like I've just auditioned for the human race and lost the job""), the kind that pull the rug out from under the drama itself (""Pills!"" shouts Georgie, who is at the point of suicide, to his psychiatrist, ""I come to you in flames and you treat me for sunburn!""), and, occasionally, the best kind, which sound almost human.When Georgie's wife wants to have a scene with him, she begins by reporting she's been crying ""all over the magazine section,"" by which ploy she manages to blame him not only for being unfaithful, but also for ruining the Sunday paper.Much like that line, which attaches (successfully) major disasters to minor ones, ""Who Is Harry Kellerman . . .?"" attempts (unsuccessfully) to make a breakdown into psychosis comprehensible by attaching it to a gag style better suited to the dilemmas of conventional situation comedy.The dramatization of psychosis demands a tougher treatment, a darker insight, especially of Mr. Gardner, if the narrative is to be meaningful; otherwise it becomes, like ""Who Is Harry Kellerman . . . ?"", a more or less descriptive drama. This is the way Georgie's breakdown looks, this is where it took place and what he said, and these are the fantasies he hadbut the only revelations of the film are the arbitrary ones of event, not the suddenly inevitable ones of emotion, with the realization that this is the way it had to be.The movie, which opened last night at the Sutton, has been rather fancily and stylishly put together by Mr. Grosbard, although I suspect much of this look comes from the look of the fancy sets and from the dozens of stylishly abrupt flashbacks that are never as revealing as they promise to be.The performances, like material, are essentially comic, and I liked everyone, especially Mr. Hoffman and Barbara Harris, as Georgie's finest one-night stand (whom Mr. Gardner has given another one of those laughing-through-her-tears speeches I can now do without), Jack Warden, as an almost murderously myopic psychiatrist, and, in smaller roles, Dom De Luise, David Burns and Rose Gregorio.If Mr. Gardner has exorcised his demons, the film is not a total loss.",1971-06-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Fortune and Men's Eyes' Bows,"A compassionate viewer troubled by man's inhumanity to man, is, nevertheless, left with the disturbing impression of having been shortchanged by ""Fortune and Men's Eyes,"" which opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and Trans-Lux West Theaters. John Herbert's adaptation of his play (staged here in 1967 and 1969) about the corrosive, sometimes destructive results of imprisonment, vacillates between an explicit, largely homosexually slanted dramatization and an implied, surface indictment of callous penal practices that does little justice to either approach.Simply stated, Mr. Herbert, who once was jailed in Canada and obviously is deeply concerned, is saying that men do turn to each other for sexual satisfaction in an all-male prison society. More importantly, he is stressing that some inmates often have no choice and are forced into this life through rape or seduction with disastrous effects.Filmed in color at Canada's Quebec Priosn under the uninspired direction of Harvey Hart (he replaced Jules Schwerin who had clashed with the producers), the bleakness of incarceration is projected with depressing authenticity. However, the shameful fact that prisons breed criminals, including deviates, is hardly new to films or strikingly presented here in interlocking stories involving the naive newcomer who is thrust into the embraces of a tough cellmate in order to avoid gang rape; the equally tough but comic ""queen"" who is at home in the system, and the forlorn, delicate, oppressed type, among others.The sincerity of the principals' performances cannot be questioned. But it is difficult to believe Wendell Burton's quick switch from a confused, terrified, pink-cheecked youngster to the rock-hard guy who beats up Zooey Hall, his rough oppressor, and is about to become a bad case himself. Mr. Hall is properly glum, ominous and moody but he doesn't appear to be the type who would succumb that easily.Danny Freedman is limp and passive as the delicate victim of a series of attacks, who recites the Shakespeare sonnet from which the title is derived. But the acting honors go to Michael Greer as the uninhibited homosexual (he appeared in the 1969 stage version) who is often fascinatingly funny and campy in a larger-than-life role.Nothing is resolved, of of course. But the film's major accent is on the discreetly staged rape scenes (there is a brief flash of frontal nudity in a striptease by Mr. Greer), the shocks of several fights, a brutal beating, a riot, a bloody suicide and a plethora of four-letter words. Unfortunately, not too much sympathy is generated for the men, who in the Bard's words, are ""in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes"" when all the bitchiness, brutality and sexuality has passed in review.",1971-06-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Newley's 'Summertree' Opens:Hume and Yafa Work Revisits the 40's Death of a Serviceman Fixes the Action,"Anybody old enough can remember, and anybody not old enough may imagine, the mood of sentiment about the land and the ordinary people and the quality of tree-shaded life in middle-America that gripped the popular arts, and especially the movies, during and for a few years after World War II. The mood passesfor a good many reasonsby the early 1950's, but a certain nostalgia for it remains. That nostalgia has been felt in several movies recentlymovies that mean to recreate the 1940'sand it now appears brought up to date in Anthony Newley's ""Summertree,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters and which attempts indicting the barbarities of Vietnam in terms of decent emotional strategies developed to illustrate life on the home front 30 years ago.I never saw the successful Ron Cowen play upon which ""Summertree"" is based, but I gather there have been a lot of changesmostly directed toward ""relevance"" and a slight juicing up of the action. There is a new character, a little black boy (Kirk Callaway), who speaks for separatism. And the girl friend (Brenda Vaccaro) is now a somewhat older woman who already has a husbandin Vietnam. But the boy (Michael Douglas) with each toss of his rugged head, each glance from his friendly eyes, bespeaks Young America. And the gruff dad (Jack Warden) who nervously loves his son and finally betrays him into war, and mom who cares and puts on the coffee  they are an older America that appropriately lives for the young. Barbara Bel Geddes plays mom, and one closed-mouth smile of hers is surely worth 350 apple pies cooling in the kitchen window.The central image of the summertree itself  a backyard retreat where the boy goes to dream his life into beingsurvives in rather ridiculous ways: especially in a bit of tinkly music, and a worm-eaten leaf pattern superimposed on the screen over his first night of lovemaking with the girl friend. And his death, which is in fact the reason for the drama, is there also, as a final bitter irony of the war that the movie, not too stupidly, admits wholly through the medium of the television screen.""Summertree"" is a bad movie, but its badness proceeds not from its intentions, which seem honorable, or from its stylistic analogies to past modes, which in different hands could have been interesting. The badness exists, rather, moment by moment, in the insufficiency of each acted scene, in the niggling insecurity of Newley's camera, in the improverishment of each evocation of a quality of lifefrom the boy's dull guitar playing, which is supposed to be great, to the father's love of hunting, which should recreate the landscape, but only signifies a thoughtless and cruel pastime.Nobody's performance quite works in ""Summertree,"" but it is possible at least to respect Jack Warden's tense privacies and Michael Douglas's restraint in projecting a youthful goodwill without either petulance or excessive charm. Brenda Vaccaro is reasonable off-type casting, but she does not seem resourceful enough even to explore the limits of this small, appealingly pathetic role.",1971-06-17T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:'The Anderson Tapes' Stars Connery,"Professionalism in a movie director, the ability to understand the job at hand and to know how to go about doing it, is a virtue that tends to be overlooked by serious moviegoers and critics, partly because it offers no unusual edge for comment, and partly because in the history at least of commercial American film production it has tried to be nearly invisible. But it has been altotherer too nearly invisible in movies lately to go unremarked when it does appear. And in Sidney Lumet's ""The Anderson Tapes"" the quality of professionalism appears in rather lovely manifestations to raise a by no means perfect film to a level of intelligent efficiency that is not so very far beneath the reach of art.""The Anderson Tapes"" is a caper movie, a most unpromising type, dealing with an ambitious attempt at a heist from an upper Fifth Avenue mansion that has been divided into luxury apartments guarded by a television security system that must rival the Pentagon's. Wanting all that loot and confronting all that surveillance stands John Anderson (Sean Connery) exconvict and current lover of the lady in 2B (Dyan Cannon), whose principal support (Richard B. Schull) has had her apartment bugged by Peace of Mind, an organization dedicated to getting the goods on wayward wives and mistresses.As anybody who has read the movie's source will recall, ""The Anderson Tapes"" is a fiction with a gimmick. Lawrence Sanders's novel purports to be a compilation of tapes, depositions, Xeroxed letters and the like, by means of which the caper is revealed and intimate secrets are put on view. The movie preserves the gimmick and even improves upon it to the extent that almost everything in it happens before the electronic eyes and ears of the F.B.I., the I.R.S., the H.U.A.C., the N.Y.P.D., and of course P.O.M. (Peace of Mind surveillance)  none of whom know about the others' work and each of whom is spying on the Mafia, the Reds, junkies, a misbehaving mistress, but never on John Anderson.About the gimmick I am of several minds, mostly negative because it has very little to do with the development of action, and at the end functions as an irrelevantly topical sour joke. But for almost everything else I am full of admirationfor the superb pacing, the tactful understatement of the location shooting, the sharp feel of the citywhich is never in any extraneous sense ""poetic"" but always exactly functional to what is after all a summer's entertainment.Except for Sean Connery's laconic, attractive, beautifully subdued John Anderson, the various roles in ""The Anderson Tapes"" are all character vignettes of more or less detail, but in any case stronger in recognition value than in dramatic development. To a great degree, these vignettes make the movie, and to do them decent credit would require almost a complete cast listing. Among the principle ones I especially liked Alan King as the expansive Mafia captain (a charming stereotype) who finances the caper and Garrett Morris as a black police sergeant whose unspectacular heroism ultimately does it in.Sidney Lumet doesn't usually make great movies, and though he tends to be very selective about his sources, (the plays of O'Neill, Chekhov, etc.) his average has not been too much better than a workmanlike 50 per cent. But when he has a subject or a source that is more alive to him than it is certifiably important he does work of exceptional depth and beauty. Over the years, in movies like ""The Group"" and ""Bye, Bye Braverman,"" he has developed a sort of corner on the subject matter of New York, and in ""The Anderson Tapes"" he takes his profit on it with an assured and harrowing and even good humored understanding. A great deal gets into ""The Anderson Tapes,"" which in telling its minor story shows a quite wonderful accessibility to the multiplicity of life.",1971-06-18T05:00:00+0000

But hold on a minute.Avoid ""Dracula"" like the plague. It's garish, gory junk. The surprise is the first hour of ""Frankenstein,"" about two-thirds of the picture. It's not only painless but also fun. Hammer Productions has finally spared the hammer and applied some deft needlework and snug embroidery.Imagine a kind of ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" detour. Instead of a sly blade gently murdering legacy obstacles, there's a personable young baron, Ralph Bates, crisply dispatching friends and relatives while setting up a castle laboratory for you-know-what.The screenplay, credited to Jeremy Burnham and Jimmy Sangster, the director, is as bright as can be. And the wry, pointed dialogue is nicely clipped off by a game cast, including Graham James, Kate O'Mara and Veronica Carlson. And lo and behold, there is Dennis Price, who bumped off eight Alec Guinnesses in ""Kind Hearts and Coronets.""One scene, when young Baron Victor Frankenstein casually eyes a brain prospect over the dinner table, is funny enough to have come from the earlier film. So far, so goodneat, tasteful, with a steely edge of incoming horror and no gore to the fore.Then the infamous monster materializes, a lumbering giant, casting a pall over the remainder of the movie, much as if the rabbit had appeared in ""Harvey.""

us,Screen: Affinity for Rats:Davison Plays Lead in Horror Film 'Willard',"Willard, says a close friend of his mother, who has made him the man he isn't today, ""is basically an extrovert, but it's all inside."" Willard is 27 years old, a thumb-biter in moments of crisis, the sort of fumbling, neurotic mess whom anonymous bus drivers delight in humiliating. He lives with his dotty old mum (Elsa Lanchester), works for the man (Ernest Borgnine) who took away his late father's business and seethes with undisciplined hatred until, one day, he discovers his gift for communicating with rats.""Willard,"" which opened yesterday at the Penthouse Theater, attempts to be the kind of horror film that allows us to share the satisfaction of Willard's revenge, as he goes around the neighborhood letting his rats run opportunely loose, while simultaneously sharingwith pleasurethe terror of his victims.The movie, however, persists in crossing its lines of stimulation, resulting in a series of little short-circuits that effectively limit pleasure to an occasional line or bit of business. It is quite funny, and sad, for example, when old Mum reduces Willard to the status of a souvenir that she can't, in good conscience, throw away. ""The only evidence of my struggle with the world is you,"" she says in one of those rare moments of introspection when her thoughts aren't concerned with the broken television set.The problem is in the writing (by Gilbert A. Ralston) and in the direction (by Daniel Mann), which tries to find horror in a cheerful, sunny, everyday environment and finds nothing more than a cheerful, sunny, everyday environment. The only halfway interesting characters are the people the movie means us to hatethe rude, penny-pinching boss, played by Borgnine, and a maniacally nosy neighbor, played by Jody Gilbert.Then, too, the rats, whom we get to knowsuperficially, anyway  as Wilbur trains them, seem not so voracious as the people they must eventually attack. They are no more scary than fat, friendly hamsters, except for one or two shots when they are seen by the hundredsand hundreds of anything might be a scary sight, even hundreds of bishops. I, for one, tend to sympathize with the rats as Willard directs them with the same sort of ultimatums as Borgnine has been directing at him.Instead of playing on our fears of rats, by keeping them at a mysterious distance, in a different metaphysical dimension, as Hitchcock did in his ""Birds,"" Mann and Ralston anthropomorphize the rats to such a convincing extent that they become little furry people whom society, especially Willard, has badly used. In this respect, ""Willard,"" which is otherwise a dull movie of no major consequence, is a rather astonishing footnote to a major urban problem.",1971-06-19T05:00:00+0000

Shocked that Cettina also desires other men, including her own husband, he marries his rich pretty young cousinan act of pique that is both a cynical acquiesence in the world's preference for money lust over all other kinds of lust, and also a way of leaving Cettina in the lurch with only her husband and her lovers for consolation.There you have the beginning and the middle and the end of Mauro Bolognini's ""That Splendid November,"" a movie that you may not want to see, now that I've spoiled the suspense.Actually, ""That Splendid November"" displays a certain quota of dj vu without any help from me. Its faces are out of Fellini; its attitudes, out of Bellochio; its Sicilian locale, out of ""L'Avventura"" (also Gabriele Ferzetti, still an architect, and still selling his soul for a mess of pottage); its rabbit hunt, out of ""Rules of the Game;"" and its story, theme and several crucial camera angles, out of ""Before the Revolution.""With so much going for it or, more accurately, going along behind it, one might expect a certain stylistic knowledgeability in ""That Splendid November."" But Bolognini (""La Notte Brava,"" ""La Viaccia,"" etc.), who often makes fancy movies rarely makes good ones, and the enterprise this time leads to cluttered stylistics without much knowledge.Miss Lollobrigida seems wrong for her part not because she is too old (she isn'tquite), but because she is too nervously bright and eager. She brings to her role a kind of infinitely monotonous vivacity that suggests neither seductiveness nor doomwhich, I take it, is what her part should be all about.But it is difficult to discuss performance when everybody has been dubbed into a language resembling English but in fact only spoken in Dubbing Land, where the phonetic laws demand that the sounds never match the lip movements and the speech rhythms never achieve expressiveness.This language fills ""That Splendid November"" with phrases like ""Well, well!

Mr. Antonacci daydreams back to the good old days of the nineteenfifties, with its dances, its early rock music and its sports. And he fantasizes. Boy, how he fantasizes. At times this freefall, freewheeling excursion into the more neurotic byways of a city life goes completely, zanily, mad. But it is always very funny. And all its humor has a firm basis in real life. It is satirical but never pompous, and its humor is often very physical, with roots going way back to the old vaudeville routines. The staging by Joel Zwick is perfect. He draws from such sources as Ladislas Fialka and even, perhaps, Grotowski, but everything is absorbed into a fine group effort. The acting is remarkable,",1971-06-20T05:00:00+0000

Their immediate motive was a religious enthusiasm whipped up by a few spell binders like Peter the Hermit, who may have been the greatest revivalist orator of all time. Behind this was poverty, the monotony of an endless work day, a life almost as confining as a prison. The Cru sades offered a holiday sponsored by God himself, a church picnic to Paradise. The pilgrims were motivated by anger too. All the frus trations or their cramped lives were channeled into moral indignation at the Infidel, who was said to stable his horses in the Christian churches of the Holy Land. For the more so phisticated classes, the Crusades were a gold rush, a means of joining Jesus and Mam mon in holy part nership. Knights and soldiers could hew and hack with God's blessing, could bathe in blood by day and absolution by night. Rape was regarded as a mere byproduct or overflow of religious ardor. In the name of the spirit, man could be as bestial as he pleased. And he was, according to Zo Oldenbourg.

But in such essentially spiritual matters as camera position, editing and the whole range of technique, ""The Crook"" suggests nothing so much as a hard-edged ""A Man and a Woman,"" with analogous self-indulgence, misdirected visual rhetoric and inexpressive stylistic excesses.Lelouch's crook (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is a former lawyer and current escaped convict who, with his ex-wife (Christine Lelouch) and trusty pal (Charles Gerard), masterminds a kidnapping scheme of picturesque but mostly unnecessary complexity. Their plan is to kidnap a little boy (Vincent Roziere) and to hold him for a million dollars ransomnot from his poor parents but from the huge bank his father works for.The scheme works marvelously. The bank takes the bait, pays the money, and in return earns much more than a million dollars worth of goodwill from the sentimental savers of Paris. The crook collects his ransom, and the kid has the time of his life, thinking he has been off on one big out-of-season Christmas party, and all goes well until . . .I won't reveal any more of the plot, but even the central event described in the barest outline may seem a bit too speculatively fancy for efficiencyand in its execution, in the incredibly elaborate scheme of the actual kidnapping, it becomes not so much a crime as a display of hopefully decorative, generally superfluous ideas.To a degree ""The Crook"" means to parody itself and its genre. The guns are never loaded, or are loaded, as nearly as I can tell, with blanks. No one is killed, no one is hurt, and those who go to jail seem to break out again with ease. Prefacing the film and concluding it, and rather messing up its middle with a bit of cyclical coincidence, is a segment of a movie musical called ""Le Voyou"" (the French title of this movie), which is meant to make fun of the molls-and-machine-gun syndrome in the crime film but which also is an overtly theatrical reading of the real-life theatrics in front of the screen.But the action in front of the screen has enough trouble with eyewash of its ownfrom the portentous close-ups of unimportant characters to the through-the-wind-shield photography (a Lelouch specialty) of the principalsnot to need any at second-hand. For all its fussily bright precision and its knowingness about methods, seeing ""The Crook"" is like seeing the genre, and what the genre understands of life, in a distorting mirror.All the performances are more reasonable than the roles call for. I especially liked the delicately beautiful Christine Lelouch (the director's wife) as the type of the modern moll, and Daniele Delorme as an aging career girl who is at first forced to harbor the crook, and then finds herself valuing his company.",1971-06-21T05:00:00+0000

us,A Love Story of a Western:Holden and O'Neal Star in 'Wild Rovers',"""Wild Rovers"" is about a couple of good-natured, none-too-bright Montana cowboys who, on the spur of the moment (and with a fine lack of reluctance), rob a small-town bank of $36,000 and then take off, in the direction of Mexico, with some vague idea of finding a cowboy paradise.As might be expected of Blake Edwards, a director and a writer whose strengths are in romantic comedy (""Darling Lili""), in farce (""A Shot in the Dark"") and in his own sophistication, ""Wild Rovers' is a very odd, very peculiar Western. It uses just about an of the conventions known to the genrefrom barroom brawls and crooked poker games to pursuing posses and passive prostitutesto tell what is essentially a love story. It is, however, a love story in which the only real love takes the form of the idealized comradeship of two men.Although the film, which opened yesterday at the Astor, Juliet 2 and 34th Street East Theaters, is rather long on narrative detail of no great excitement, it's made interesting, at least for me, by its conflicting impulses toward low comedy, realism, adventure and myth. It is, I suspect, exactly the sort of Western that someone who's never tried one before would elect to makea first meal by a cook whose enthusiasms range from bitter melon soup to pche Melba.Ross Bodine (William Holden), pushing 50 and with nothing to show for it except the lines in his face, and Frank Post (Ryan O'Neal), who is half Ross's age, short-tempered, affectionate and tough, are William Remington cowboys, without pasts or futures. They are men who exist only in terms of their jobs. Their mistake, prompted by the accidental death of a friend, and some rather comic musings on their own mortality, comes when they attempt to alter fate.They have no great difficulty in knocking over the bank, but it is apparent, as soon as they do, that they are lost cowboys, doomed not by the posse that follows them but by their own witlessnesses.Holden, who is aging with immense vigor as an actor, and O'Neal, who has what is basically the role that Ali MacGraw played in ""Love Story,"" are most engaging as the odd couple on the range, a relationship that Edwards defines in a slow-motion montage that is more legitimately dramatic than lyrically effective: as Holden sets about to break a wild bronc, O'Neal, who is watching, turns somersaults in the snow in the kind of love dance that Arthur Hiller staged earlier in Harvard Yard.Life was tough in the Old West, Edwards seems to say, and love had a way of getting worn out early or misplaced. The young 0'Neal almost kills a man who wants to take his dog away from him. Leora Dana, as the wife of the rancher for whom Holden and O'Neal work, allows her husband (Karl Malden) to dominate their sons, and blame her for their faults. In extremis, a puppy must be nursed by a mother cat.It is possible, as you might have guessed by this time, to read all sorts of things into ""Wild Rovers,"" which makes it worthy of the attention of film aficionados, though less committed audiences may well become restless.The film is magnificently set in Western locations that lead, finally, to that greatest set of all (built, you might believe, for John Ford), that is, Monument Valley. It is an appropriate backdrop for the conclusion of a film that is more compelling as the work of a specific director (whose thoughts have here turned west) than as an isolated entertainment, as an end in itself.",1971-06-24T05:00:00+0000

Dramatically, the picture is a bore. And neither the oblique approach to these time-out sequences nor a ripe score by Michel Legrand manages to juice things up.The sound-track roar of the motors eventually becomes a long drone as the picture levels off episodically.

us,The Screen: 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller':Miss Christie Portrays Prostitute in West Betty Is a Gambler in Altman's Film,"In the course of Robert Altman's new film, ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" there is a shot of Warren Beatty steaming off a drunk in an old-fashioned, wooden, bathtub, his arms draped along the sides, his eyes closed and his bearded face hanging limply forward. When such a shot prompts the woman behind you to hisswith the excitement of someone who has spotted Rod McKuen at the Russian Tea Room: ""He looks just like Jesus!"", you may be sure you're in the presence of a movie of serious intentions. Shots that make the characters look just like Jesus don't happen by accident.The intentions of ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" are not only serious, they are also meddlesomely imposed on the film by tired symbolism, by a folk-song commentary on the soundtrack that recalls not the old Pacific Northwest but San Francisco's hungry I, and by the sort of metaphysically purposeful photography that, in a tight close-up, attempts to discover the soul's secrets in the iris of an eye and finds, instead, only a very large iris.Such intentions keep spoiling the fun of what might have been an uproarious frontier fable about a smalltime gambler named McCabe (Beatty), a frizzy-haired whore named Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie), and the systematic destruction of their small, free American enterprise by Big Business, with the not so innocent cooperation of organized religion.When McCabe first comes to the bleak little mining town of Presbyterian Church, it doesn't seem as God-for-saken as not yet discovered by God, for whom a church is under construction. It's a scenic mess of squalid shacks, bordered by an even more squalid ghetto for Chinese laborers.McCabe, a man of common sense but very little arithmetic, sets out to bring civilization to Presbyterian Church in the form of a casino and a three-bed bordello. He doesn't do very well, however, until he is joined by Mrs. Miller, who has the heart of a bookkeeper, the aspirations of a madam, and connections with a house in Seattle. They make a marvelous, practical team, and are immensely successful until The Company moves to take over their businesses, via assassination when it becomes apparent McCabe won't sell.There is one moment in the film that achieves, I think, just the right balance between comedy and satire that Altman seeks, unsuccessfully, for the entire film. McCabe, who is not exactly keen on being murdered, asks the help of a lawyer who lectures him on the American way and cheerfully concludes: ""If men stop dying for freedom, freedom itself will be dead!"" When poor McCabe gets hoodwinked into believing he's protecting free enterprise by accepting a showdown with the hired killers, the contemporary allusions become rather thick.I don't automatically object to contemporary allusions, but I prefer to find them myself, and ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" is so busy pointing them out to us that the effect is to undercut its narrative drive and the dignity of its fiction. Dignity may sound like a curious word to use in this case, but the characters of ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" as written and as played, do have an essential dignity that is very real and honest. Beatty's gambler-turned-businessman is a truly comic, clay-footed entrepreneur, and Miss Christie's tough-talking whore is about as appealing as that sentimental character can be until she's required to drift off into opium oblivion, a woman-turned-into-society's victim.As in ""M*A*S*H"" and ""Brewster McCloud,"" Altman fills his screen with sometimes exceptionally vivid detail, such as the casually viewed fight between a knife-wielding prostitute and her customer, the overheard small talk between miners standing at the bar, and the physical growth of Presbyterian Church in the course of the film.As ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" progresses, however, there is also an increasing suspicion that these details are loaded with ulterior motives, which have not as much to do with the time and place of the film, as with its pretentions. One thing the movie does have in beautiful and extraordinary abundance is weatherrain, snow, sleet, wind (it was photographed on location in Canada), which is most attractive, especially to someone who spends most of his life looking at the world through windows sealed for air-conditioning.",1971-06-25T05:00:00+0000

Over the years, Sidney Lumet has devel oped a sort of corner on the subject matter of New York, and in The Anderson Tapes' he takes his profit on it with an assured and harrowing and even good humored understanding.

us,Screen: 'Hellstrom Chronicle' Opens:Nature Provides Topic of Documentary,"""The world,"" says the narrator of ""The Hellstrom Chronicle,"" a man obviously privy to all sorts of secrets, including those of the emotional lives of the planets, ""was created not with the sweetness of love, but with the violence of rape.""The narrator, unfortunately, is never at a loss for words. He expresses a wish to have seen ""the ironic smile on the Creator's face"" as He was going about His business and, a little later, makes us feel almost guilty as he reminds us that insects are ""free from the concept of romance"" (which explains, I guess, why so few termites have been lyric poets). A perfectly well behaved (in her own terms) black widow spider is described as ""throbbing with obese sexuality"" as if she were La Saraghina in some arachnid ""8.""These asinine statements should give you an idea of the viscosity of the various assumptions by which the makers of ""The Hellstrom Chronicle,"" the feature-length documentary that opened yesterday at the Paramount Theater, have glued together a lot of quite beautiful and spectacular footage of insect life.Considering the high quality of the photography, I suspect that many moviegoers will be willing to put up with the narration and the point of view of the film, which earlier this year was awarded the Grand Prix de Technique at the Cannes Film FestivalI, for one, must register an objection. I find it significantand depressingthat someone would feel that a film so full of straightforward scientific data should have to be hyped by the sort of scare-and-doom techniques better applied to the fiction of ""War of the Worlds.""""The Hellstrom Chronicle"" purports to be an ultimatum to mankind delivered by a scientist, Nils Hellstrom (played by an actor named Lawrence Pressman) to the effect that if we don't watch out, the insects will inherit the earth, which, as he notes anyway, was quite comfortably inhabited by insects long before the first man appeared.The movie seems to be making a case for a sane ecological policy, which is all well and good, but it devotes most of its efforts to turning its subjects  driver ants, locusts, bees, moths, butterflies, Venus fly traps, and what notinto monsters of anthropomorphic dimension. Why else would the narrator make such a point of the fact that an insect ""has no muscles to smile with, or with which to betray its thoughts?""""The Hellstrom Chronicle"" is less interested in defining the roles that insects play in maintaining the balance of nature than in creating nightmare visions of their world in strictly human, phobic terms. There is, to be sure, a certain fascination in watching termites at war with harvester ants, or bees disposing of the larvae of unwanted queens, or a fly being consumed by a plant. These scenes are also unpleasant, in an almost abstract fashion, as if all of the maiming, the dismembering and devouring were in themselves evil, and not simply the very well ordered system by which nature survives as well as it does.A number of cameramen contributed the individual sequences, utilizing stop-motion photography, telescopic lenses and microscopic lenses, and their work is superb. The narration and the point of view, however, are sensationally awful and, possibly, misleading. Anyone who has ever lived more than a week in a New York apartment already knows, for example, that an entente with insects must be reached if the world is to survive. I suspect that the only people who worry about whether or not a cockroach can smile are people who have never lived with one. A smile is something one just doesn't ask of a bug.",1971-06-29T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Glory Boy':Violence Is Outcome of Veterans' Return,"Some movies, often the very greatest, are genuinely difficult. Some others, never the greatest, are merely obscure. It is in this second category, films that by their own confusions and inadequacies fail to make the kind of sense they so unclearly intend, that Edwin Sherin's ""Glory Boy,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet and Forum theaters, belongs.""Glory Boy"" is yet another movie made not about, but under the shadow of, the Vietnam War. When its young hero (Michael Moriarty) returns home to his father's run-down farm north of San Francisco, he brings with him a stupid but relatively harmless Army buddy (William Devane) and a Regular Army sergeant (Mitchell Ryan) who is more or less waiting put his 30 days before re-enlisting.The sergeant is no friend, merely somebody picked up because his stern jaw, his medals and his military manner will please the old man. But behind his tough exterior seethes a soul of sulfuric acid, and after he has humiliated dad, knocked unconscious a hitchhiking college girl (Topo Swope) so as to rape her, and dynamited the fish in the trout stream, it becomes fairly obvious that he is a one-man social, moral and ecological disaster.Between the father (Arthur Kennedy) and the sergeant there is a certain equivalence, for the old man has in gentler ways ruined everything he has touched (so you shouldn't miss the point, he keeps praising the farm as a Garden of Eden) and he too represents the militarism of an agethe age of World War II. The film recognizes that the two wars are not equalthe father is fallen from sentimental ideals; the sergeant is pure evil forcebut symbolically and, at last, literally, the two cancel each other out.I think this is the most significant action in ""Glory Boy,"" though there are several others, and there is a whole household full of representative typesincluding the girl who, unaccountably, comes back to cook and clean and put flowers on the dining room table. But except for what fits together all too neatly, nothing seems to belong with anything else, and it all feels like watching a series of strung-together three-minute sketches. Sherin's direction stresses action in the middle distance not all that bad, but limiting and the multiplication of pregnant pauses  so that sometimes it looks as though the actors really are standing around wondering what to do next.Almost everybody figures out something reasonable in timeexcept for William Devane, who plays for a kind of instant insanity and ends up suggesting, say, Jerry Lewis as Macbeth. But the two principle kids, Michael Moriarty and Topo Swope, really are something specialappealing without courting appeal, sympathetic without the production of any unnecessary charm. Michael Moriarty particularly brings a rather intricate intelligence to an almost incomprehensible role. But both he and Miss Swope introduce a quality I should never have expected in this moviea quality of articulate and active lucidity.",1971-06-30T05:00:00+0000
