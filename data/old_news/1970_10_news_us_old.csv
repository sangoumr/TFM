us,Screen: Story of a Student Filmmaker,"""Cover Me Babe,"" which opened yesterday at the Astor and Baronet Theaters, is the sort of movie that needs the words of a critic less than it requires the services of an analyst, displaying, as it does, a compulsive need to ridicule itself, to deny its basic intelligence and to fail. It accomplishes all of these things with an idiocy that should warm the neurotic heart.The film is the second feature to be directed by Noel Black, the young man who gained a worthy reputation in some circles for his first feature, ""Pretty Poison,"" although the good things in that film seemed to me then (and even more so now) to have been the contributions of the scriptwriter, Lorenzo Semple Jr., and the star, Tony Perkins, rather than the decisions made by the director.In ""Cover Me Babe,"" Mr. Black and his scriptwriter, George Wells, are presenting a portrait of an artist as a student filmmaker. The movie opens with a long excerpt from a surreal short made by the hero, Tony Hall, and it's so terrible, so full of the clichs of the avant-garde, that it seems  at least at firstthat Mr. Black and Mr. Wells have some perspective about their subject. However, it's quickly apparent that they didn't.Tony is a rude, quarrelsome fellow who refuses to knuckle under to Establishment procedure. He turns down a chance to work for a major company, saying they'd probably want him to make movies with plots and characters. Instead, Tony seeks to capture reality on screen by running around town with a hand-held camera, shooting such things as a couple making love in a car, which he then juxtaposes with a shot of a mother trying to revive her drowned child, accompanied by a laugh track. (Just one of the film's many improbabilities is that the other film students take Tony seriously. The ones I know would have booted him out of the hall.)When his girl says that his new script makes no sense, Tony comes back with: ""Does war make sense? Does cancer? Does a freeway smashup?"" Lines like these prompt Melisse to go to bed with Tony: ""He makes me feel alive. He shows me the way things are.""They also create the impression that Mr. Black and Mr. Wells have probably made just the kind of film that Tony would have, had he been given the opportunity by a major studioplotless and characterless, all right, but loaded with its own clichs of dialogue, attitude and style. The crowning (I assume, unintentional) irony, of course, is that although Tony keeps railing against the studio system, ""Cover Me Babe"" was financed by 20th Century-Fox, which should really know better. The cast is headed by Robert Forster, who wrestled somewhat more successfully with problems of illusion and reality in ""Medium Cool,"" and who seems a little elderly to be entirely convincing as a student filmmaker.Although ""Cover Me Babe"" is a second feature, it looks very much like a first and had it been a novel, instead of a movie, it would have probably stayed in somebody's trunk. The one truth that the movie presents has to do with the terrible economics of moviemaking. Because of the huge investments involved, even mistakes like this can't be allowed the honor of decent obscurity.",1970-10-02T05:00:00+0000

us,'Tropical Ecstasy' Opens at the Rialto,"One cannot but admire the power that draws Isabel Sarli again and again to taste the passion of Armando Bo, her writer, producer, director, husband and perennial leading man. For this couple, no longer in their first youth (no longer, really, in their second) display a durability of desire that must inspire old lovers everywhere and that in the past considerably toned up the dirty movie businessof which their new ""Tropical Ecstasy,"" which opened yesterday at the Rialto, is not, alas, a very exciting example.The fault is not Miss Sarli's. Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale the infinite voracity with which she vamps anything that is, or possibly could be, male. Friends, enemies, a doorjamb, even an old fish netseem to bring on the strange fits of passion, the undulating hips, the heaving breasts that are her trademark, and, indeed, her stock in trade.Combining as she does the body English of Mae West with an apparent nostalgia for the moral universe of Louisa May Alcott, Miss Sarli has always striven to express the dilemma of a pure spirit fighting the proclivities of the too eager flesh supporting it.It is, of course, the struggle and not the outcome that matters. But in ""Tropical Ecstasy,"" in which Miss Sarli plays a home-loving prostitute who flees her bordello boredom ("". . . will I ever find true love of man?"") only to fall into instant bliss and lasting domesticity in the household of Mr. Bo, a simple fisherman, there simply isn't enough struggle.Certain complications develop as Miss Sarli recalls her sordid pastusually in the midst of present pleasure, so that she has both sexual climax and remorseful flashback at the same timebut they are both too few and too timid to lift the film above the dullest ordinary.Armando Bo's direction is mostly a way of filling in between the points of his own minimal screenplay. Meaningless mood shots, interminable pans across the same sea and landscapes, repeated returns to Miss Sarli writhing in the surfor to the couple awkwardly locked in a strenuous embrace that no longer seems wholly worth the effortit all looks as if there were nothing to do and too much time to do it in.",1970-10-03T05:00:00+0000

His subsequent career as a philanthropist has been indul gently dismissed as useful if cranky eccentricity or Victorian hypoc risy. In this first major biography of Carnegie since Hendrick's author ized Life of 1932, Joseph Frazier Wall makes an impres sive unity of Carnegie the in dustrialist, phil osophizer and philanthropist. Wall shows that Carnegie was a superb salesman from the start. As an 8yearold in a Scottish classroom of more than 150, Carnegie was immediately able to establish himself as the teacher's favorite. As an immigrant telegraph boy in Pittsburgh he quickly caught the eye of Pennsylvania Railroad executives. With their help he parlayed a series of sharp speculations into an income of $50,000 a year by the time he was 33, in 1868. Discovered in a particularly blatant speculation in 1871, he turned fulltime to steelmaking. ",1970-10-03T05:00:00+0000

us,The Terrible Toll of Brush Fires,"LOS ANGELESIn Southern California, fire ranks right below death and taxes on the scale of inevitability, and considerably above salvation. During the last 10 days, dozens of brush fires have scorched more than 600 square miles and destroyed or damaged more than 1,000 homes. At week's end, most of the blazes were contained, but the threat of new outbreaks remained. What causes these fires? And why, when everyone expects them, do they happen anyway? There are essentially three major ingredients for disaster. The first is that the rolling hills of Southern California are blanketed with a plant called chaparral, a sort of scrub evergreen that practically ex plodes into flame when ignited. Second, this area of California is, naturally, almost a desert. Water to supply Los Angeles is piped in from as far as the state of Wash ington. The third, and most freakish, ele ment is the Santa Anas, or devil winds, hot, dry gusts that sweep in from the Mohave Desert at speeds approaching 100 miles an hour. These winds aggravate the dryness, fan the flames when they start and then make it very difficult to fight the fires from the air. What can be done? Ap parently, very little. Brush cutting helps save some houses, but the areas involved are far too vast to consider clearing them on a major scale. Sprinklers are another answer, but often a fire will cut the water pressure. Asbestos siding, tile roofs and other fireresistant building materials also help.

us,The making of a general and how it came abo,"Historians of the last great war have all duly noted that fighting, like most human affairs, is now in the hands of bureaucracy. Hence there are no great generals any more, no strategic brilliance, scarcely even room for the exercise of imagination. Nothing in Stephen E. Ambrose's long and extraordinarily fascinating book argues the contrary. But if from the viewpoint of its victims, bureauc racy may be the quiet, faceless horror that Kafka saw, at the directors level, people still act like people and their world is as rich in the drama of interacting personalities as a castle of old courtiers or a ship of fools. It is Mr. Ambrose's special triumph that he has been able to fight through the memoranda, the directives, plans, reports, and official selfserving pie ties of the World War II establish ment to uncover the idiosyncratic people at its center. At the center of that center Gen. Dwight Eisen hower comes remarkably alive. ",1970-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Andy Warhol's 'Trash' Arrives:Heroin Addict's Life Is Theme of Film Techniques of 30's on View at Cinema II,"The opening credits (""Andy Warhol Presents Trash . . . "") appear as words spelled out in little light bulbs of the sort still used on old theater marquees. On the soundtrack can be heard some breathless, tinny movie music taken from Josef von Sternberg's ""The Blue Angel."" Even if you don't get the point immediately, you will soon after ""Trash"" begins. This second film by Paul Morrissey (his first was ""Flesh,"" described as a tribute to John Ford) is a relentless send-up of attitudes and gestures shanghaied from Hollywood's glamorous nineteen-thirties and forties.The joys of ""Trash,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema II, are not inexhaustible, but compared to things like the pretensions of ""Cover Me, Babe"" and the calculating heart of ""Sunflower,"" ""Trash"" is true-blue movie-making, almost epic, funny and vivid, though a bit rotten at the core. I'm writing this on Monday and I'll say, quite simply, that it's the best American film made in New York that I've seen all day.Like ""Flesh,"" to which it is a kind of moralizing sequel, ""Trash"" is a circular odyssey, only this time Joe (Joe Dallessandro), the male hustler of ""Flesh,"" is a heroin addict. In spite of pimples on his rump and face, his physique is still so magnificently shaped that men as well as women become disconnected at the sight of him, all of which does no one any good, since Joe is impotent.""Trash"" is the story of Joe and his lover-protector Holly (Holly Woodlawn) who, in real life, is a female impersonator, though in the film the matter of Holly's sex is ambiguous. Joe and Holly try to make a go of things in their lower East Side basement, from which Holly goes forth from time to time to cruise the Filmore East and to scavenge garbage cans, while Joe's journeys are in search of real junk. The film takes its shape principally from his encounters, which have the style (and the substance) of grotesque grass fantasies.There is a sweet, absolutely round-breasted go-go dancer (Geri Miller) whose philosophy sounds as if it could have been learned at Judge Hardy's knee: ""If you're sexy, you can be sexy doing anything. Sex is from the inside."" There's a soft-headed girl from Grosse Pointe (Jane Forth), whose apartment Joe intends to rob. Instead, he gets propositioned for a rape.""I'm only a rich newlywed with no furniture,"" she says by way of introduction. Later, while the camera is in a tight close-up on Joe's arm as he gives himself a fix, Jane whines at her husband:""Oh, Bruce, we don't have fun any more. Do you know how long it is since I slept with another man?""All feelings, all values are turned upside down and played for laughs, with the result that it's difficult for me to take ""Trash"" more seriously than it takes itself. In spite of the grubbiness of the scene and the ineffectuality of the various disguises and escapes employed by Joe and Holly and the rest, there is no sense of despair. At heart, the film is a kind of exuberant exhibition of total apathy.Mr. Morrissey is, I think, a talented moviemaker, even though much of the effect of ""Trash"" depends on outrageous shock or on rather curious plays on pathos. I assume that the performers have been handled with skill, in spite of the fact that it's not always possible to tellin this sort of moviejust what the performers themselves have brought to their roles.Holly Woodlawn, especially, is something to behold, a comic book Mother Courage who fancies herself as Marlene Dietrich but sounds more often like Phil Silvers. I shall also remember for some time the very funny performance by Michael Sklar as a welfare investigator who comes to call on Holly and becomes enchanted by her silver shoes, which, he thinks, would make a marvelous lamp.""Trash"" is alive, but like the people in it, it continually parodies itself, and thus it represents a kind of dead end in filmmaking.",1970-10-06T05:00:00+0000

Examples of early masks show how men whipped together some bark, a few feathers and a handful of cowrie shells and presto, they were the personification of evil, in just the right facial outfit for rites of passage. And then there's modern man, wearing the skulllike, white plastic helmet of the hockey player, or slipping into a papiermach structure to walk out on stage. Nonfunctional masks are shown that were created as art or decora tion to make an esthetic statement about faces and faades. Unfortunately, the visitor can't try on the masks in the show however sorely temptedbut can try out some facial adornments. Visitors can watch in a mirror as preprogrammed light pat terns are projected on their faces to show how they look in colored cobwebs or multicolored stripes. There is also a transparent plastic, mask that shows the wearer how she would look in curls and painted cheeksor beards and moustaches (one woman said she was surprised to discover she looked best in a Fu Manchu moustache). At a makeup bar, Edrie Anne Blackwelder paints fanciful designs on visitors faces. There's no charge, beyond the 75cent admission to the show.

us,Screen: Jagger as Outlaw,"In ""Ned Kelly,"" the combined talents of Tony Richardson and Mick Jagger, as a legendary outback outlaw, illustrate scenically, if not emotionally or definitively, the parallel between our Old West and Australia of a century ago. The film clattered into the DeMille yesterday with ""Underground,"" starring Robert Goulet as a daring but all too familiar World War II maverick-hero. ""Underground"" hardly seems to be worth all the gunfire, derring-do and color film.As the impressively better one of these adventures, ""Ned Kelly"" bears all the signs of dedicated movie-making. Unfortunately, Mr. Richardson's direction and script, on which he collaborated with Ian Jones, do not delve too deeply into character. Nor are the principals' motivations projected with relevance to untutored American viewers. ""Ned Kelly,"" with intrusive, explanatory songs by Shel Silverstein sung by Waylon Jennings, emerges as somewhat pretentious folk-ballad fare that often explains little more than its action.Like Jesse James and family, Ned Kelly, his mother, brothers and sisters are depicted as wronged, poor Irish farmers harried by English landowners and constabulary. Freed, after an unjust, three-year prison term for horse stealing, Kelly and his boys, with prices on their heads, conduct a gory but eventually tragic campaign to free their kind from their oppressors.Filmed in lovely colors on authentic Australian locales, ""Ned Kelly"" shimmers fitfully with varied beauties. A homecoming dance to a wild Irish reel is memorable, as are horsemen racing on a wooded hillside and a bare knuckle, friendly fight at a village fair. Equally impressive is the iron armor devised by Kelly as protection against pursuers. But these are colorful vignettes that only touch on but do not fully reveal the drama or the history behind the events.As the ill-fated titular hero, Mick Jagger, the rock singer, with a beard that makes him appear more Amish than Australian, is, sadly, simply a dour renegade who rarely becomes the ""wild colonial boy"" of the legend. Only a few members of the large supporting cast, notably Clarissa Kaye, as his mother; Janne Wolmsley, as his girl, and Martyn Sanderson, as a villainous Irish constable, are momentarily meaningful. ""Such is life, Mick Jagger flatly states before being hanged, an observation that can't quite be applied to ""Ned Kelly.""Lifelike also does not apply to ""Underground,"" which has Mr. Goulet successfully spiriting an important Nazi general out of France to England with the aid of the brave Maquis. ""You'd better be worth it, general,"" the glum, tough but tortured hero says at one point. The general and ""Underground"" are not.",1970-10-08T05:00:00+0000

As the Nobel Prize Committee noted, there is an ethical force in his writing, a compassion for suffering humanity that has permitted his work to transcend the limits of his personal experience and to shed new light on the human condition. It is to Nikita Khrushchev's credit that a decade ago he permitted the publication of Solzhenitsyn's first masterly novel, A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. That moving and unforgettable account of the horrors a Soviet slave labor camp established Solzhenitsyn's reputation at home and abroad almost overnight. But more recently Khrushchev's successors have deemed politically necessary partially to rehabilitate Joseph Stalin. That infamous decision brought in its wake a shameful effort to silence and disgrace Solzhenitsyn in his native land. It is this tragic background which explains why Solzhenitsyn's later superb novels, The Cancer Ward and The First Circle, have been banned in the Soviet Union while Solzhenitsyn himself has been proclaimed a pariah unworthy even of membership in the Union of Soviet Writers.",1970-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,How Mother cast her shadow,"There is a selfconsciousness in the novel these days, a preoccupation with style that calls attention to itself and is inevitably parodistic of other works of fiction. Yet in a Nabokov, a Barth, a Bellow, a Mailer, one does not feel that the reference to experience has become more re mote because we are being delib erately reminded of other books. Parody in these writers, on the con trary, strikes at the roots of style the human behavior and attitudes that underlie all verbal postures. Is Peter De Vries this sort of parodist? He is our most gifted takeoff man whose literary parodies are the hu miliation of anyone who merely criticizes. But there have been occa sions when his novels have seemed smothered or aborted by this faculty as in The Tents of Wickedness, which we read more for its series of mimetic exercises, comic imitations of Marquand, Faulkner, Fitzgerald and others, than for anything else.

us,'Great White Hope' Brought to Screen,"Howard Sackler's The Great White Hope,"" which won the Pulitzer Prize, the Drama Critics Prize and the Antoinette Perry Award as the best drama of the 1968-1969 Broadway season, never was much of a play.The movie that Martin Ritt has made from it, which opened yesterday at the Baronet, is necessarily limited by the nature of the original text. ""The Great White Hope"" is a polemical, black Passion Play about Jack Jefferson, a lightly fictionalized version of Jack Johnson who, in 1908, knocked out Tommy Burns of Canada to become the first black heavyweight champion of the world.The film, like the play, progresses in terms of highly stylized scenes that dramatize Jack Jefferson's initial triumph, his subsequent persecution and his humiliations as if they were the Stations of the Cross.Jack Jefferson, according to Mr. Sackler, is a victim not only of the bigotries of his time, but also of his own completely romantic notion that he is a private person. After he flaunts his white mistress, thus compounding the insult to white America represented by his championship, he is convicted on a trumped - up Mann Act charge, forced into exile in Europe, where he is reduced to playing Uncle Tom to his mistress's Little Eva in a Budapest beerhall, and finally to Mexico, where, in final frustration, he denies the love that originally sustained him.The style of the play, which the film faithfully retains, is most reminiscent of New York's old Group Theater productions. There are choruses of evil (the members of the boxing establishment as they conspire to get Jack to throw a championship bout) and choruses of good (Jack's friends and family, headed by Beah Richards who plays Jack's mother with hair of Scarsdale blue). There's even a mysterious soothsayer who confronts Jack, at the height of his early success, with predictions of doom.As the movie progresses, the tableaus become increasingly overwrought, leading to the climactic one in Juarez, in which the body of a lady, who has just committed suicide by jumping down a well, is hauled on screen like one of Medea's children. That Mr. Sackler's talents cannot support his tragic design is apparent from the fact that one's sympathies are not as much concerned with the poor lady as with the poor peons, who still must use the well into which the lady so thoughtlessly tossed herself.""The Great White Hope"" is one of those liberal, well-meaning, fervently uncontroversial works that pretend to tackle contemporary problems by finding analogies at a safe remove in history. In spite of Muhammad Ali, who was quoted two years ago as saying of the play, ""You just change the time, date and the details and it's about me!"", Mr. Sackler's play and screenplay are too smug, too full of stereotypes to be provocative as drama. Similarly, his method is too pretentious to create the kind of fundamentalist fervor that might prompt one to interrupt the production by shouting an occasional ""Yes, Lord!"" or ""Amen!""However, having said all this, I'd like to add that the film contains a performance that makes the windy, otherwise empty movie seem inhabited, if not by life, at least by art. James Earl Jones, who re-creates the role of Jack Jefferson he played on Broadway, is marvelous to watch, combining heroic physical presence, technique and (to me) a completely mysterious way of projecting intelligence, so that the character commands attention even when the drama doesn't.There's also an initially charming performance by Jane Alexander as Jack's mistress (who is eventually defeated by the hysterics of the script) and good if conventional ones by Lou Gilbert, Hal Holbrook, Robert Webber and the late Chester Morris.Mr. Ritt has staged most of the film in the only way possible, as if all the events were locked inside a huge proscenium arch. The fight sequences are played like dumb shows to the accompaniment of dream - like cheers. The camera seldom looks beyond the sets to a real world, and then the real world is filmed as if it were in theatrical disguise.In this manner the director has served his star exceedingly well, avoiding the usual fate of the epic theatrical performance that becomes grotesque on screen, where, after all, man is always seen in the same dimensions as his settings.It may not be entirely fair to mention, but, throughout ""The Great White Hope,"" I kept wondering how I might respond to a movie, made on a similar scale, that dared touch on some really controversial issues, including the war, the draft, the Black Muslims, black separatism, and all those other things that make Ali such a thorny public person today.",1970-10-12T05:00:00+0000

But with each scene, each camera movement, each gesture from its large and dispirited cast, ""The Mind of Mr. Soames,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema 57 Rendezvous, displays an emptiness and a falseness of response that is beneath even the inadequacy of its ideas and the banality of its plot.John Soames (Terence Stamp), in a coma for all of his 30 years, is finally brought to life by the super surgery of Dr. Bergen (Robert Vaughn) so that he may be educated according to the theories of Dr. Maitland (Nigel Davenport), director of the institute where he had been peacfully sleeping. Between permissive Dr. Bergen and repressive Dr. Maitland a certain ideological conflict develops (e.g. ""How often do you playgameswith him?"" ""Games? What do you mean, games!"") that is the first and, I guess, final cause of the melodrama. But in the background there is a third doctor (Donal Donnelly), a source of hope who keeps his own counsel, patiently watches the wild child, and incidentally looks a bit like Franois Truffaut.""The Mind of Mr. Soames"" is full of boldly introduced but ultimately undeveloped character clichs, which add a touch of bogus mystery to a film that is otherwise 100 per cent predictable. For example, Dr. Bergen drinkstoo muchbut nothing ever comes of it. And the callous TV director (Christian Roberts) who willfully almost wrecks Soames's belated childhoodwhat is his story, full of meaningless dark hints and fitful glimmerings?As Soames himself, a child of Frankenstein dressed in a mansized set of pink Dr. Dentons, without booties, Terence Stamp must have the best fun in the movie. Not only does he get to cry a lot and to play with toys, but he also is allowed at one time or another to dump baby food on all his doctors and keeperswith which inspiration ""The Mind of Mr. Soames"" exhausts itself and falls into moral platitude and heavy breathing.",1970-10-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:A Fauna Legend:Saga Traces Life of the 'King of the Grizzlies',"Having already penned practically all fauna from aardvark to zebra on color film, Walt Disney's fearless hunters, with an ample assist from a willing Canadian contingent, now have trapped a generally benign ""King of the Grizzlies"" for legend lovers, if not zoologists. This adaptation of Ernest Thompson Seton's saga of a storied bear from cub to sovereign, which opened together with Disney's 1959 cartoon legend, ""Sleeping Beauty,"" at local theaters yesterday, should be a delight for cub scouts of all ages.For scouts above the age of 12, say, this adventure is more cute than arresting and has all the tension of ""Sleeping Beauty,"" as it meshes the life cycle of Wahb, the grizzly, and the simple stories of Moki, the Cree Indian ranch foreman, who rescued Wahb as a cub and still reveres him, and his boss, Colonel Pierson, who wants to destroy the grizzly as a threat to his livestock.There is vivid, picturesque beauty in the Alberta Rockies where it was all shot. And, the forests, meadows, waterfalls, snowy peaks and clear streams are striking too, as are cubs cavorting or bears battling each other or other carnivores.But despite Winston. Hibler's off-screen comment that ""grizzlies are unpredictable,"" this 1,200-pound Wahb, ""played"" by a grizzly named Big Ted, is entirely predictable as the ultimate winner over his puny, human adversaries, who after all, have to grapple with an entirely predictable story.",1970-10-15T05:00:00+0000

It's not very long; it pays attention to every hallowed idiocy of its genre, and its characters talk a marvelously unreal type of movie repartee Truck-driver: ""You a student?"" She (cheerfully): ""No. I'm a teen-age prostitute. Give you any ideas?""). What's more, its images are crammed with advertisements (for, among other things, Hamm's Beer, Hondas and Kraft Cheese) that are its own kind of relevant symbology.Even if that weren't enough (and it almost is), the movie stars Joe Namath and Ann-Margret, probably the only two people in the United States who have no identity problems, as, respectively, a nice, clean-cut, long-haired Hell's Angel sort, and a high-fashion writer forif I remember correctlyHarper's Bazaar.Although Joe belongs to a rogue bike gang, the sort that demands the kind of fascist discipline so much of young America seems to find appealing, you suspect he's still essentially a fresh, high-spirited, decent kid from Beaver Falls when he saves Ann-Margret from a gang-rape.You are positive by the time he and Ann-Margret are enjoying a tryst at ""the fabulous Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas"" (a direct quote from the movie's credits) and she asks him if his friends wouldn't be jealous if they could see how he was living. ""Not how,"" he answers, ""with whom.""Any man who shows that much respect for the objective pronoun simply has to love his mother.The film is the first to be directed by Seymour Robbie, whose earlier experience has been in television. Compared to the gaudy theatrical films of other TV-trained directors, ""C.C. and Company"" is simplicity itself, even though the screenplay threads its way through all sorts of obligatory things like cycle duels, dirt races and one love scene in which Joe and Ann-Margret seem to be under the impression that they're in ""Hiroshima, Mon Amour.""""C.C. and Company"" is actually Mr. Namath's second film (his first, ""Norwood,"" hasn't been released in New York yet). He has almost as many changes of wardrobe as his co-star, an easy wit, and the unruffled manner of a guy who'll try anything twice, which means that he's a perfect match for Ann-Margret, who already has, in all sorts of pop movies.The movie opened yesterday at theaters throughout the city, including the DeMille, on Seventh Avenue, where the sound was sometimes faulty and whose projectionist, at the second show, was apparently so taken by the third (or was it the fourth?) reel that he started to show it twice.",1970-10-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Insight Into World of Revolution:Robert Kramer Puts It on Personal Level,"The American revolutionary movie, commercial style, with its now values, its now hairdos and its now stars, has generally proved nothing but the survival of ancient nonsense no matter how new the vehicle. Hollywood's response to the present, in which, say, Eliot Gould gets radicalized and also gets his girl over the gassed-out bodies of his pals in the student union iswellHollywood's response, not without an old-fashioned charm but quite without the relevance it so disingenuously means to capitalize upon.But the movie career of Robert Kramerthe Newsreel, the picketing of the New York Film Festival in 1968 (protesting its perpetuation of ""litist art""), last year's much-publicized field trip to Hanoi, even his current withdrawal from film-makingcontains relevance enough to compensate for an entire misdirected industry. And in his two feature films, ""The Edge"" (1968) and ""Ice,"" which opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater, Kramer's association with the movement pays off not in the power of his polemics, which are not all that powerful, but in his real, if humorless, insight that revolution, like everything else we do, lives in our awareness as a succession of personal relationships.Running for well over two hours, ""Ice"" is of course too longnot only for endurance but also for its own proper form. Nevertheless, that form demands a certain spaciousness, for it is concerned with understanding a revolutionary action in its totality as a complex network, a communications network, if you will, that needs time if only for the dispersal of information, the transmission of its all-important messages.Set in the future (i.e., today), when the United States is committing aggression in Mexico and suppressing freedom at home (the film is very vague about this and Kramer seems congenitally incapable of offering even a reasonable parody-view of the other side), ""Ice follows a group of urban guerrillas as they plot sabotage, proselytize before the unconvinced middle, make love with or make allowances for one another, and live through one night of violent terror.There are assignations at the New Yorker Book Shop, as assassination in the courtyard of the Belnord, an occupation of Washington Square Village. The look and feel of New York City, its airports, its facades, its monuments, its side streets and its avenues are in a sense the documentary evidence the film offers to certify its action. For ""Ice"" seems ultimately to be its own most important communiqu as if it were a film on tape, to be reproduced and delivered to yet other cells in other cities as part of the pattern of propaganda, the technology of which is almost its chief subject.Because it is secretive and yet full of disclosures, because it accepts the melodramatics of its themes, even because it is so prophetically timely, ""Ice"" is much of the time a very exciting film to watch. But it is also a rather moving film.Passing beyond the takeout coffee-carton stage of revolutionary planning (which endeared ""The Edge"" to a good many critics, including me), ""Ice"" nevertheless remains true to its characters alone and with one another. The cast is amateur (and wholly anonymous, though you may recognize a few friends and familiar faces), but it is adequate to the moods, frustrations, accommodations and intolerances of the movie  which always, sometimes awkwardly, sometimes more wisely than it probably intends, patterns its fiction upon the rhythms of life.",1970-10-16T05:00:00+0000

At another, it offers itself as the indispensable ally of radical social reforms, revolutionary political move ments, and attempts to trans form industrial civilization into a new Utopia. On the one hand, it appears to embrace all the excesses of romantic solipsism, and on the other, to detach itself from the vi cissitudes of private feeling with an almost inhuman de tachment. It shows no scruples about involving itself in what ever the Zeitgeist happens to turn up, and yet it retains an energy and an independ ence that mock the importun ities of history.

His fame had spread throughout Russia by the time he reached his 20's. Today his small body of work is as vital as ever, even without the benefit of publication. Perhaps most impressive of all is that he was arrested during the Stalinist terrorostensibly for writing verse uncomplimentary to the leader (His cockroach whiskers leer/ And his boot tops gleam.  /And every killing is a treat/ For the broadchested Ossete.), but actual ly because Mandelstam was too completely a poettoo helplessly his own manto be pressed into the forms of the New Era and made to sing the songs of the Union of Soviet Writers.

us,Finnish 'Time of Roses' Looks at Politics in 2012,"""Time of Roses,"" Risto Jarva's Finnish movie that opened yesterday at the 72d Street Playhouse, is set in 2012, 11 years after Stanley Kubrick's spaceship Discovery set off for Jupiter and 28 years after George Orwell's Big Brother consolidated his grip on Britain. The setting is a Finland in which people communicate by view-phone, laze around on not-so-Finnish-modern, inflatable plastic furniture and take their meals from machines that, in friendly, gravelly voices, announce the calorie content of the items ordered.Politics, not gadgets, however, is Mr. Jarva's principal concern, and his future Finland is one of those brave new worlds that can only be accepted as a projection of the cowardly old one. Class distinctions have disappeared. Everyone contributes according to his capacity and pure, unbiased science has become a repressive political dogma.The symbol of this repression is Raimo, a young man who makes biased, unscientific, immensely popular TV films that reshape history in support of current ideology. When Raimo decides to make a movie about what it was like to be alive in the 1970's, by reconstructing the life of a rather ordinary girl who died in 1976, some of his revolutionary associates plan to expose his methods. At the same time, these associates are also involved in the organization of a strike in an atomic power planta loose plot thread of which absolutely nothing is made.I suspect that ""Time of Roses"" might seem a lot more relevant in Finland, a country that has lived on political edge for some time, than in New York, where Mr. Jarva's view of the future seems not very dark, just dim and rather polite. Although I know it's wrong, I can't help but feel wistful about a state in which love is free and strikes are so rare that the very planning of one becomes an act of heroic affirmation.""Time of Roses"" doesn't occupy the mind, but it does offer some amusing fringe benefits. I liked a futuristic, basketless basketball game, in which hugging and kissing between the boy players and the girl players is encouraged, and the somewhat cautionary final image: the opportunistic filmmaker, having passed out with booze celebrating the success of his new movie, turns on his inflatable couch in such a way that he punctures it. When last seen, he is slowly, mindlessly, sinking to the floor in a heap of clear plastic.",1970-10-20T05:00:00+0000

us,'Goin' Down the Road' Winds Its Way From Canada,"Donald Shebib's ""Goin' Down the Road,"" which opened yesterday at the Carnegie Hall Cinema and 34th Street East Theater, has already won best Canadian picture award at the Toronto Film Festival and has received considerable praise in at least one of its pre-reviews. It is, however, a very dull movie, and because it pretends to a kind of flat realism to certify its fiction, it lacks most of the saving graces that attend ordinary bad movies and sometimes make them fun to watch.""Goin' Down the Road"" concerns two young Nova Scotians (Doug McGrath and Paul Bradley) who, because they are without prospects at home, take off for Toronto, where, in everything they attempt  jobs, seduction, marriage, installment buying, theftthey fail. They are stupid young men, each in his own way elaborately self-deceived. But the film persists in taking them seriously, or, more accurately, in taking their plight seriously. Finally, as the presskit plot synopsis faithfully (alas) sums it up: ""Victims of urban life and institutions, with shattered dreams of quick affluence held out by the media to the uneducated and untrained, leaving behind bad jobs, bad debts, bad apartments and the pressures which turned them eventually to petty crime, they again take to the road.""In spite of its earnestness, and, to a degree, because of its earnestness, the film inevitably condescends toward its charactersplacing them, understanding their motives and reactions, settling their destinies with deterministic rigor. A mostly depressed view of a depressing world, it eschews the clichs of conventional fiction only to be trapped by the banalities of its own social-studies conventions. When somebody in ""Goin' Down the Road"" moves into an expensive apartment, you know exactly what humiliation will follow  even though the attending deities are the Angels of Economics rather than the Avenging Fates.The performances are mostly first-rate, and the scenes that do come to life (I remember especially a pathetically moving wedding banquet) owe a good deal to the skill and sensitive interplay of Doug McGrath and Paul Bradley. In a minor role, voluptuous Nicole Morin plays a kind of walking, talking Playboy centerfold who adds nothing much to the plot but who, for the time she is on screen, indicates at least one of the seven dimensions otherwise lacking in ""Goin' Down the Road.""",1970-10-20T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Marlon Brando and Black Revolution,"""Burn!,"" Gillo Pontecorvo's first film since ""The Battle of Algiers,"" aspires to be a prole epic but winds up as the sort of prole pageant in which characters always seem to be conceptualizing great issues, mostly freedom, as they pass in front of history, as if it were a scenic view, instead of moving in and out of it.The time is the mid-19th century and the setting is the fictitious island of Queimada, a Portuguese sugar colony in the Caribbean. To further their own trade, the British send to Queimada a secret agent, Sir William Walker (Marlon Brando), to preach independence (and greed) to the plantation owners and to teach revolution (and freedom) to the slaves.Largely with the help of Jos Dolores (Evaristo Marquez), a black Bolivar whom he first meets as a dock porter, Sir William is triumphantly successful. The Portuguese are removed and the independent nation of Queimada is established with the support of the British Antilles Sugar Company.At the height of the victory, the now-General Jos Dolores is persuaded to disband his black army and to leave the running of the country to the white commercial interests. Ten years later, Sir William returns to the island to put down a new black rebellion led by the disciple who is of no further interest to the crown.Although it is fiction, ""Burn!"" can never quite bring itself to take advantage of this in order to create a drama of conflict and confrontation. Its scope is so broad, so grand, really, that it can't be dominated by either the British agent, whom Mr. Brando plays with a marvelously complex, rueful intelligence, or by Jos Dolores, a role that is not so much played by Mr. Marquez as represented by him. Mr. Marquez, a nonprofessional Colombian, looks fine, like a mahogany saint, but his speeches are often unintelligible.In the course of its production, ""Burn!"" (originally titled ""Queimada"") turned into a kind of mini ""Cleopatra."" There were stories of illnesses, reports of feuds and rumors of romances. The location of sites near Cartagena, Colombia, became so rugged that shooting was shifted to North Africa. The film went over its schedule and over its budget, but this can only explain some minor technical failings.Mr. Pontecorvo seems to have conceived ""Burn!"" as a kind of super-""Battle of Algiers,"" an attempt to dramatize not only the meaning of freedom but also the black Caribbean heritage, which is a large order. There is a tremendous difference between reconstructing fact, which he did in ""Algiers"" and has its own shape, and creating so-called significant fiction on which a shape has to be imposed.I'm not sure, but it does seem to me that he may actually have made his own compromises with contemporary commercial needs by making Queimada a Portuguese colony. Portugal, which was about the only European power not to colonize in the Caribbean, is not as big a market for imported films as, say, Spain, which takes a dim view of foreigners dipping into its history and rewriting it.Having said all this, I must add that I wasn't bored by the film for a minute. It is lovely to look at, and although it never delivers an ultimate payoff, it keeps promising one. Furthermore, Mr. Brando is worth watching under almost any circumstances, and you should enjoy seeing him here, using that Fletcher Christian accent and, towards the end of the film, looking very much like the late Ernest Hemingway, a tired and tragic hero whom life has somehow double-crossed. The movie opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie.There are points of interest in ""Little Fauss and Big Halsy,"" which opened yesterday at Cinema I, but most have to do with issues beside, behind, and, I guess, beneath the film. It is not so much a bike movie, or a movie about contemporary life styles, as you might believe from the ads, as another in a continuing series of betrayed male relationships that seems central to the screen career (""The Leather Boys,"" ""The Ipcress File,"" ""The Lawyer,"" etc.) of Sidney J. Furie.Little Fauss (Michael J. Pollard) and Halsy Knox (Robert Redford) do ride bikes, and, without much success, they race in various meets throughout the Southwest. Little is the earnest ugly good guy, and Halsy, the handsome womanizing lying louse, and between them grows up an affection more real and more nearly equal than their world or their own ideas might ordinarily allow. But it is a relationship so poorly defined, so genuinely inexpressive in its devious reserve, that when at the climax Little lets down his pal, it feels as if nothing has happened. And, on the whole, nothing has.Between Little and Halsy falls a shadow, a girl (Lauren Hutton as ""Rita Nebraska,"" and you can see where names get to be a problem in this movie) whom Little loves and Halsy has. But the theme of sexual jealousy must be taken almost on faith. Although the film-keeps acting as if it knew what girls were for with many breast shots and an occasional thigh or two, the actual sense of attraction is lacking utterly. What draws Little to Ritaas opposed even to what draws Little to Halsyremains more of a mystery than this movie can bear.If you compare ""Little Fauss and Big Halsy"" with a real movie about speed racing say, Hawks's ""Red Line 7000""you will understand the disadvantage of having, instead of a subject, a series of (mostly negative) attitudes. I'm not sure what the bikes mean to Furie, but he seems to appreciate them for their nuisance value, like a crowd of swarming flies. He is careful also to include a crowd of swarming flies. Everyone drives as if in a mad rageacross a landscape that is good only for the dust that can be raised on it.In this context it is difficult to understand character or admire characterization. Of the two leads, Redford does better at resisting the understated hamming that the camera seems to beg of him. Miss Hutton might be good, and she would be beautiful, in most movies. I suspect that Linda Gaye Scott, a symbolic sex object here, has more to offer than the misuse of her body. But Lucille Benson and Noah Beery, as Little's mom and dad, eagerly push American postgothic into theater of the absurd, and Miss Benson must be credited with one of the creepiest performances in recent movies.",1970-10-22T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: Continuing Tale of 'I, A Woman':Interracial Sex Theme Also Gets Workout 'The Daughter' Makes It a Family Affair","After ""Tamburlaine the Great Part I"" and ""Henry IV Part II"" comes ""I, A Woman Part III,"" also called ""The Daughter."" Whatever the relation of part to part (I never saw Part II, and I can't really remember Part I), it is impossible not to admire the tenacity of titles in this series and to look forward hopefully to the time when ""She, a Woman (Part VIII),"" in a last fillip of unreconstructed lust, seduces her confessor on her deathbed and thereby so traumatizes her eavesdropping great-granddaughter (a frustrated virgin of 12) that it will take a whole movie full of pot parties, Lesbian encounters and willing young men to work out her problems.I'm afraid I've given away half the surprise in Part III, except that the daughter (Inger Sundh) is 17, while ""I, A Woman"" (Gun Falck), is only in her mid-30's and has a wonderful healthy thing for men that only her daughter fails to appreciate. But the pot parties are there, and a lot of five-years-out-of-date go-go dancing, and the Lesbian (Ellen Faison), and the young men, the best of whom (Tom Scott) happens to be the Lesbian's brother.By one of those sleights of character in which Part III specializes, the brother falls in love with the daughter rather before first sight. All he really wants to do is marry her. But since he is black and she is frigid and this is pornography (not much) certain rituals must be recognized before brother can marry daughter and sister, who has all the best in the movie, can cast her first speculative glances at ""I, A Woman.""On the interracial sex question the movie clearly means to have it all four ways  finding it normal, finding it quickly, loving it, and firmly disapproving, by means of a chorus of old biddies who are never shut up. There are also contributions by the Copenhagan chapter of Hell's Angels, who hate the brother because he is black, and by Danish pacifists, who hate him because he happens to be an American.Actually, Tom Scott, who plays the brother, is the film's cutest performerlooking rather like a regenerate dark Tony Curtis. Ellen Faison is the sexiest. But neither Miss Sundh nor Miss Falck are likely to cloud your fantasy life, and Miss Sundh especially keeps pasting on her face a stupid smile that characterizes the kind of girl you may go to dirty movies to forget. Mac Ahlberg's fancy color photography, of which there is a great deal, seems mostly a way of filling time. But it does produce an opening title sequence, perhaps the longest opening title sequence in history, of exceptional decorative nuttiness. In it a naked girl voluptuously slithers and slithers, while all around her fall acres of liquid-suspended snowand for that moment (more like a half hour) ""I, A Woman, Part III"" looks as if Rosebud had met and mated ""Cherry, Harry & Raquel.""""The Daughter (I, A Woman Part III)"" opened yesterday at the New Embassy and Trans-Lux 85th Street theaters.",1970-10-24T05:00:00+0000

Of more immediate conse quence is the fact that the S.E.C. has a club to force com pliance with its wishes.

Clive Barnes: I think The Roths childs will give a lot of pleas ure to a lot of people. It has geniality rather than incan descence, there are showstop ping performances rather than showstopping numbers, and the structure of the show lacks that simple sweep of action more often than not a pre requisite of a hit musical. Yet it is interesting, in parts very witty, has a certain moral force and best of all, it has style. The story is based on Frederic Morton's biography The Rothschilds, and it is one of the musical's clearest successes that you are really made to care for the outcome of a story that is never for a moment in doubt. Mr. Bock's music makes a neat nod in the direction of the 18th century, but blends period pastiche with a gentler, more cultivated version of those Jewish folk melodies that were so success ful in Fiddler on the Roof. The lyrics also have style and a lot of gusto. The cast is a delight. Hal Linden's Mayer Rothschild is one of the best musical performances now on Broadway.

The years 19201929 marked a happy congruence of interests on the part of Law rence and Scofield Thayer, the editor most responsible for the revitalization of The Dial during the twenties. Lawrence, hound ed as he was by a brutal critical reception in England, the cen sors and his own stunning inner torments, was ready for Amer ica in every sense. Thayer, on the other hand, with his limit less financial resources, utter contempt for censors and dis tinctive empathy for Lawrence's artistic principles, was more than anxious to bring Lawrence into what was to be the most distinguished American literary review of the period. Lawrence was no small part of that achievementsome 30 pieces of his were published by Thay er and successive editors in the review. Messrs. Joost and Sulli van have drawn a full portrait of Lawrence's tempestuous re lations with such figures as Ma bel Dodge Luhan, Compton Mackenzie, T. S.

Somewhere between one of its scenes of high council and some earnest debate in Parliament (was it the Rump?), it occurred to me that although fashions in pop historical movies have changed over the years, they haven't changed nearly enough.If Warners had made a movie about Cromwell 30 years ago, it would have starred Errol Flynn in the title role, Olivia DeHavilland as Mrs. Cromwell, George Sanders as poor old Charles I, and Bette Davis, with a French accent, as Queen Henrietta Maria, all under the wonderfully foolish direction of Michael Curtiz. It might have been historically inaccurate, especially when the Queen made a play for Oliver, but it probably would have been fun.In the early 1950's, Fox would have shot it in Cinema-Scope with Richard Burton, George Sanders and maybe Bella Darvi (as the Queen), all under the doggedly faithful direction of Henry King. It would have been as silly as the Curtiz movie, but inching towards the piety of present-day producers.Mr. Hughes's film, which arrives with its credentials for accuracy certified by Will and Ariel Durant, stars Richard Harris as Comwell, Sir Alec Guinness as Charles and Dorothy Tutin as the Queen. Its supporting cast includes some well-trained character actors and dozens of those British extras who apparently devote their lives to playing soldiers, farmers, footmen, nobles, clerks and governesses, always with an abject facelessness that is a reminder of British caste in movies as well as history.""Cromwell"" is not a silly movie in the sublime Hollywood sense. In fact, the film, taken in conjunction with a handsome program prepared by the producers, gives a rather nice, serious, eighth grade introduction to a place and time that produced Prince Rupert and his pet poodle named Boy, the Grand Remonstrance, and the quote: ""Keep your powder dry.""Curiously, however, just because it presents its history with such unimaginative respect for factswhich are necessarily truncated and ellipsized, the effect is more historiographically neutral than was Mr. Curtiz's romantic ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex."" Mr. Hughes, who wrote the screenplay he has directed, has kept the form of the old Hollywood historical film but eliminated its meaning.There are those obligatory early scenes showing commoners being maltreated by the King's men, Oliver refusing to think ill of the crown, finally making his grave decision to fight for freedom, big battle scenes that can only be shot in Spain, lonely vigils, throne room confrontations, and the like. At the same time, however, Mr. Hughes has abandoned the sort of romantic speculation that might have made Cromwell and Charles at least dramatically interesting, without substituting historical speculation that might have given them significance.",1970-10-27T05:00:00+0000

Although he wants Dr. Julia Hoffman (Grayson Hall) to cure him, his reasons (""Do you think anyone could enjoy an existence like mine? I haven't seen the light of day for almost 200 years!"") do not seem the most exalted. As for lovely Maggie Evans (Kathryn Leigh Scott), he wants her any way he can get her. And although he, not she, insists on a wedding ceremonytwo coffins, a stone altar, stage smoke and miles of phony cobwebshis intentions won't bear inspection.Not that they are ever inspected. ""House of Dark Shadows"" really has no subject except its special effects (which aren't very good) and its various shock sequences. Characters are picked up and dropped with an indifference unacceptable even for soap opera. And by the end of the movie everybody is either dead or discarded or a vampire (or all three) except for Miss Scott and her fianc (Roger Davis) and Joan Bennett, who has the good fortune to settle into a catatonic state rather early on.Lest all this sound like good clean fun, prospective audiences should understand that it is neither fun nor even especially clean.

us,Film: 'McKenzie Break':P.O.W. Camp Is Scene of Escape Attempt,"Lamont Johnson's ""The McKenzie Break,"" which opened yesterday at several New York theaters, is so greatly superior to most recent war movies, adventure movies, escape movies and action movies generally that it seems almost unfair to raise the objection that it is not quite as good as it sets out to beor, given the talents involved, as it ought to be. But it is nevertheless modest enough in pretensions and strong enough in achievements to repay the time of anybody not hell-bent on major subjects or total cinema.The film takes its title from a Camp McKenzie, a prisoner-of-war camp in Scotland from which, near the end of World War II, a group of German U-boat men attempt an escape in order to rejoin the failing forces of Admiral Dnitz. The German leader (Helmut Griem) disguises his escapevia the usual painfully dug tunnelwith all manner of nasty prisoner hijinks, thus upsetting the authority of the camp commander (Ian Hendry) and moving British Intelligence to send to McKenzie a troubleshooter (Brian Keith), a free-wheeling, insubordinate, hard-nosed, clever type too rarely seen in modern movies.Between Keith and Griem a certain equivalence by opposition is set up, which, until the mechanics of the escape itself take over, seems to be the main interest of ""The McKenzie Break."" With this relationship the film is by no means subtle, even going so far as to superimpose images of the two men in a final stop shot, but it is also always interesting and valid. Where it fails is in the penultimate identification of Griem as nasty Nazi, which doesn't quite jibe with a central action that has less to do with ideological conflict than with competiing styles of anarchic behavior.But for the most part ""The McKenzie Break"" sticks to a level of intelligent competence that it would be pointless to fault. As usual, the prisoner-of-war camp is run more as an escape factory than a prisoner-of-war camphowever, the film always takes reasonable pains to subordinate machines to men. Near the beginning, there are just enough young Nazi faces by firelight so you might think you were watching second-unit footage for a sequel to ""The Damned,"" but this is one of the very few stylistic excesses in an otherwise gratifyingly economical movie.I liked all the cast. But as the charming and astutely bullish Capt. Jack Connor, Brian Keith is especially goodand sufficiently in control of things to serve for anybody's authoritarian fun father figures.",1970-10-29T05:00:00+0000

It will celebrate the comic genius of the writer-director-occasional performer whose longer works tend to outrun their initial inspiration.If I were in charge of the show, it would include a 60-second visit with the generally quarrelsome, 2,500-year-old brewmaster (""My tongue just threw a party for my mouth"") whom Mr. Brooks created for Ballantine Beer; the opening number from ""Springtime for Hitler"" (the musical within his first film, ""The Producers"") in which myopic Nazi chorines sing ""Here Comes the Master Race!""; ""The Critic,"" the Ernie Pintoff cartoon that Mr. Brooks wrote and narrated, and the parody of ""Death of a Salesman"" (from ""New Faces of 1952"") in which Willy Loman's son absolutely refuses to pay attention to his father, the crook.It might also include the scene from ""The Twelve Chairs,"" Mr. Brooks's newest film, a comedy set in 1927 Russia, in which Ostap Bender (Frank Langella), the con man, asks Tikon (Mr. Brooks), the caretaker at a home for the aged, what goes on there. ""The old ladies,"" says Tikon blandly, ""they tippy-toe in. They have a bowl of porridge, and then they. . . ."" Tikon gives an abrupt, nasty Bronx cheer that, in Mr. Brooks's elastic vocabulary, may be either an insult or a euphemismfor death and lesser failures.""The Twelve Chairs,"" which opened yesterday at the Loew's Tower East Theater, is otherwise a comedy for Brooks-watchers somewhat more indulgent than I. The screenplay is an adaptation of the Soviet comic novel by Ilf and Petrov, who continued the adventures of Ostap Bender in a second novel, ""The Little Golden Calf.""The film is essentially one long chase across the Soviet Union, to Moscow, Siberia and the Crimea, undertaken by three energetic, irritable and inept treasure huntersOstap Bender, the youngest of the trio, Vorobyaninov (Ron Moody), a fallen aristocrat, and Father Fyodor (Dom DeLuise), a fallen priest. Their prize is a dining room chair, one of a set of 12, in which Vorobyaninov's unpleasant mother-in-law hid 50,000 rubles worth of jewels during the Revolution.As able as the three leading actors are, it is Mr. Brooks, who, though he appears only briefly in the film, dominates it from the beginning, which is a death scene, to the end, in which the movie, quite literally, winds up flat on its back, jerking with the spasms of a simulated epileptic fit.Most of the things that happen in between are almost as joyless, and as joyless as the Soviet Union the film purposefully depicts. This is, I think, because Mr. Brooks's sense of humor is expressed almost entirely in varying degrees of rudeness and cruelty, unrelieved by any comic vision of mankind, of the Soviet Union, or even of his characters.There is an innocence about ""The Twelve Chairs,"" but it is the kind of innocence in which one character will say to another ""You aren't worth spitting on."" To which the second replies: ""Well you are!"" and then spits on the first. For some reason, this sort of comedy of physical insult seemed much funnier to me in the Broadway world of ""The Producers,"" which really is aggressive and nasty and cheap, than in a Russia that is not too far removed from the world of Sholem Aleichem.In ""The Twelve Chairs"" Mr. Brooks wants to be lovable, and to stomp on your foot at the same time. I, for one, object.",1970-10-29T05:00:00+0000

us,'Trog' and 'Taste Blood of Dracula',"Three hours of British-made pseudo science fiction and horror, such as ""Trog"" and ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" that drenched the screens of the DeMille and other houses yesterday in ersatz plots and gore, could conceivably encourage potential movie buffs to turn, say, to the charms of plumbing. This might not be a disservice since neither entry shocks entertainingly nor enlivens the ailing cause of the B-type thriller on the lower half of double bills.There is, however, a rudimentary virtue in ""Trog,"" a sort of second cousin, 15 years removed from ""Creature From the Black Lagoon,"" in that it proves that Joan Crawford is grimly working at her craft. Unfortunately, the determined lady, who is fetching in a variety of chic pants suits and dresses, has little else going for her.As the anthropologist chief of a research center that has unearthed a living, hairy, half-caveman half-ape, Ice Age ""missing link,"" a troglodyte she cutely nicknames 'Trog' and attempts to rear as you would a backward child, she poses no threat either to Dr. Margaret Mead or Dr. Spock. Of course, there""s the villainous Michael Gough who goads the gentled 'Trog' 'into murdering several villagers, a rampage that leads to ""Trog's' climactic destruction.""I never expected this,"" one of Trog's discoverers exclaims. But thanks to a script that makes everything vapidly obvious from the start, 'Trog' is no more exciting or scientific than the antics of a rambunctious kid in a progressive school.If anything, ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" is as ""scientific"" and humorless as ""Trog."" Christopher Lee, as Dracula and an old hand in the horror trade (""The Hands of Orlac,"" ""The Gorgon,"" ""Dr. Fu Manchu,"" ""Dracula,"" ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave"") now is involved in dispatching three improper Victorians, who not only are averse to drinking his blood but also have killed one of his disciples.As the vampirish Count, complete with crimson eyes and king-sized incisors, Mr. Lee, his victims, Geoffrey Keen, John Carson and Peter Sallis, and their amorous sons and daughters, Linda Hayden, Martin Jarvis, Isla Blair and Anthony Corlan, succeed in making blood-letting an anemic show.Early in the creepy proceedings in a ruined church, one of the timorous trio whispers, ""My God, I don't like this.""

us,Screen: A Loner vs. a Modern Mafia:'Machine Gun McCain' Stars Cassavetes,"""Machine Gun McCain"" and ""Land Raiders"" opened Wednesday at neighborhood theaters. There were five other openings on Wednesday, and for reasons of space, and the sanity of the staff, a review was delayed until today. For reasons of space, not sanity, the present review won't be long enough to do justice to a pair of mostly awful movies that are nevertheless not without interest and the honor of their genres. By any standards I can recognize, there is more to be said for this failed double bill than, say, for all the schlock earnestness of ""Goin' Down the Road"" or the nasty knowingness of ""Little Fauss and Big Halsy.""Nathan Juran's ""Land Raiders"" is a fairly ambitious blood-feud Western in which Telly Savalas plays an evil older brother, George Maharis plays a good younger brother with a part-time Spanish accent and Janet Landgard plays the love interest in a voice and manner that seem modeled on the style of Tricia Nixon. There are Indians, Apaches, and in the manner of recent Westerns, they winovercoming almost everything except Maharis, Miss Landgard and, presumably, the tide of history. Nothing about ""Land Raiders"" really works, but it is impossible wholly to dismiss a film so full of fancy flashbacks, super-emphatic characterizations and well-loved stereotypes.""Machine Gun McCain"", a modern Mafia movie made by Italians at home and in the United States with a rather illustrious international cast, actually has more to say about family relations than ""Land Raiders."" McCain (John Cassavetes), pardoned after 20 years in prison, confronts his son (Pierluigi Apra), whom he immediately identifies and disowns as a two-bit punk. He picks up a bar girl (Britt Ekland), who becomes his loyal accomplice in a highly improbable raid on a Las Vegas casino owned by the Mafia, whose revenge constitutes the fatal climax of the movie.Between the Mafia with its familial network of courtly captains and deferential lieutenants, and the unyielding loner McCain, whose personal morality will exclude an only son if necessary, a rather interesting contrast develops. At best the contrast is never sufficiently dramatized, and it finally falls in the inexpressiveness of Cassavetes's performance, the vagaries of the screenplay, and the superfluous introduction of an old flame (Gena Rowlands), who adds nothing but conventional confusion to the plot. But it is there to think about; to admire in passing, to lament its loss  as so frequently falls to those of us who love C movies.",1970-10-30T05:00:00+0000
