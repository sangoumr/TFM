Both were Jews, and I too am Jewish. He worked for his father, who was a butcher, put himself through law school and became an attorney. I was born in Harlem in 1904, attended the public schools and De Witt Clinton High and, after college, followed my father's lead by studying law at Fordham. I took a degree and was admitted to the New York Bar in 1928, but by then I'd found what I really wanted to do: write. A year or so earlier, I'd fallen in again with a boyhood friend named Nat Weinstein, and when he announced that he was writing a book - writing a book! - I knew that the law had lost me.

us,"HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD;
Why, despite American-Soviet negotiations since the 1950's and current popular protests, are we closer than ever to the horror of nuclear war? Two fundamental causes of the nuclear arms race are rarely discussed.","First, American and Soviet leaders, who alone have the power, clearly lack the political will to negotiate an end to this 30-year madness. And they lack the will because, unlike ordinary citizens, they do not sufficiently feel the threat of nuclear holocaust as a personal danger. Both leaderships embrace a nuclear strategy of assured destruction of the other's citizenry that leaves both leaderships intact to wage ''controlled and protracted nuclear war.'' Their ''plan for continuity of government'' is reflected in separate and profoundly unequal provisions for civil defense in both countries. Civil defense for ordinary American and Soviet citizens is a government charade inspired by conventional bombardments of past wars. But for hundreds, or even thousands, of American and Soviet leaders (''national command authorities,'' as they call themselves), civil defense is a high-priority and potentially real sanctuary (''survival of strategic command, control, and communications system'') that involves hollowed mountains, special aircraft and superhardened bunkers. No wonder leaders can authorize plans for the instant incineration and radiation of millions of people; they expect to be elsewhere.",1982-07-06T05:00:00+0000

South Korea today is in the midst of a deeprunning, three-year-old crisis. In October 1979 this crisis brought the downfall of Park Chung Hee, and today it threatens his successor, Chun Doo Hwan. Also in jeopardy is the American relationship with Korea, now in its centennial year. Why? Because three American Presidents over the past decade have ignored, or supported, the repression of democratic dissidents.","Recent events, however bad, only symbolize this crisis. There will be worse to come. In March, student dissidents torched the American Cultural Center in Pusan and attacked the American role in backing President Chun and in aiding the suppression of the Kwangju rebellion of May 1980. Theology students did this, and their Roman Catholic priests sheltered them while arranging for their surrender. Now the fathers are on trial under the harsh National Security Law, and the students are termed Marxists. In May came the worst financial scandal in Korean history. Shady manipulations on the informal money market running into the hundreds of millions of dollars shook an economy that exists on state-controlled credit. Several companies went bankrupt, much of the Cabinet resigned and President Chun drew the wagons around the Blue House, stonewalling amid allegations that the loan sharks had close ties to him and his wife. In early June, women who are electronics workers held two Americans hostage for nine hours, until the American Embassy notified the Korean police and had the workers arrested.",1982-07-06T05:00:00+0000

Their creative give and take during the 1970's wasn't well documented on records, but it seems that while Mr. Davis was developing his own taut, aggressive jazz-rock fusion, Mr. Evans, with his big bands of the late 1960's and early to mid-70's, was coming up with something similar.

Yasir Arafat's relationship to the Palestinians remaining in besieged west Beirut was illuminated by a scene following an Israeli aerial bombardment last week. The Israelis had blown up an apartment house in the Fakhani quarter. A corner building, it looked like a slice of cake someone had smashed with a fist. Trapped inside were many civilians, including an old woman's four children. She was wailing outside the twisted debris when Mr. Arafat came walking down the street accompanied by two guards and trailed by neighborhood folk. As soon as she spotted him, the old woman stopped crying, ran up and kissed his forehead.

us,SCHOLARS IN THE MIDDLE OF BATTLES OVER INFORMATION,"IT may have failed to persuade Congress that the Freedom of Information Act is too free, but that hasn't stopped the Reagan Adminstration from attempting to correct what it regards as the excesses of open government spawned by the law. An Executive Order on Classification promulgated this spring, for example, gives officials broader authority to withhold information on the ground of national security. Budget cuts are restricting the compilation and dispersal of Government statistics and slowing declassification of documents at the National Archives. And last month, Mr. Reagan signed a measure making it a crime to disclose the identity of covert agents. These moves have troubled press and public affairs groups, but they are especially vexing to Federal historians, who must mediate between the often conflicting demands of the agencies they work for, outsiders who come to them for information and, of course, history itself. At a recent meeting of The Society for History in the Federal Government, Allen Weinstein, a historian and professor at Georgetown University and executive editor of The Washington Quarterly, Alfred Goldberg, chief historian in the office of the Secretary of Defense, and Quinlan J. Shea Jr., former director of the Office of Privacy and Information Appeal and currently director and counsel for the Justice Department's Executive Office for United States Trustees, discussed the dilemmas confronting Federal historians.

Like our dreams, the stories we tell are also the stories we are told. If I say that I write with the enormous hope of altering the world - and why write without that hope? - I should first say that I write to discover what it is I will have written. A love of reading stimulates the wish to write - so that one can read, as a reader, the words one has written. Storytellers may be finite in number but stories appear to be inexhaustible. For many days - in fact for weeks - I have been tormented by the proposition that if I could set down, in reasonably lucid prose, the story of ''the making of the writer Joyce Carol Oates,'' I might in some rudimentary way be defined, at least to myself. Stretched upon a grammatical framework, who among us does not appear to make sense? But the story will not cohere. The necessary words will not arrange themselves. Of the 40-odd pages I have written (each, I should confess, with the rapt, naive certainty, At last I have it) very little strikes me as useful. The miniature stories I have told myself, by way of analyzing ''myself,'' are not precisely lies; but, since each contains so small a fraction of the truth, it is untrue.",1982-07-11T05:00:00+0000

These twinges, I fully understand, were irrational and unjustified: Edward Downes, who orchestrated several scenes of this one-act opera, most of which the composer left in piano score, allowed us to hear - in admittedly questionable form - an early Prokofiev work that would otherwise have remained buried. We stand in Mr. Downes's debt, especially since the opera as performed proved to be a tolerably interesting period piece.

The state's maximum tax rate for profits on the sale of a house is 14 percent. But long-term capital gains treatment can reduce this to an effective rate of only 5.6 percent (the 40 percent of the gain that is included in income multiplied by the top state tax rate of 14 percent).",1982-07-18T05:00:00+0000

Today, we are witnessing stage two of the museumization process, in which museums cope with the problems of how to store, preserve and display the collections they have assembled. The museum remains the repository of photographic connoisseurship, but the photography curator's essential task has largely changed from one of promotion to one of conservation.",1982-07-18T05:00:00+0000

Others have declared that hundreds of thousands of Lebanese have been made homeless by Israeli bombing. And it has even been said that the Israelis have killed ''thousands of children.'' Now that the first reliable reports are coming out of the war zone, it is, of course, being discovered that all these numbers are wild exaggerations inflated by 1,000 or 2,000 percent. That is scarcely surprising because the original numbers were merely the products of P.L.O. propaganda. Moreover, as the ''innocent people of Lebanon'' are beginning to speak to reporters, it is becoming evident that the vast majority of Lebanese of all faiths deem themselves very fortunate to have been rescued from the disorderly abuses of the P.L.O. - and that, too, is not surprising because long-term occupation by undisciplined gunmen inflicts far worse suffering than short and sharp military action, however powerful in effect.",1982-07-18T05:00:00+0000

The Netherlands Dance Theater will perform it for the first time in New York on Tuesday at the Metropolitan Opera House. Mr. Forsythe is a thoughtful type who is not averse to using brutal political imagery in his ballets. If ''Say Bye Bye'' is anything like his ''Orpheus,'' performed here by the Stuttgart Ballet in 1979, it could be a shocker.",1982-07-18T05:00:00+0000

Last week, the party unveiled a new television commercial designed to counter an earlier, controversial Republican spot that claims President Reagan is solely responsible for the latest Social Security increase. Republicans, for their part, recognize that G.O.P. losses would make it difficult for the President to have his way on the Hill.

Everything else - arms control, relations with allies, improving ties with developing countries - had to be subordinated to this end. Former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. acted as if the only way to halt or derail this locomotive was by throwing his body on the tracks in front of it, frequently in public view. More often than not, the tactic worked, until he overplayed his hand. In a way, his weaknesses, his insecurities and assertiveness, translated into bureaucratic strength.",1982-07-18T05:00:00+0000

Each company has an agent - usually a bank - to whom shareholders send forms indicating their desire to tender their shares. Picking a winner means the shareholder is assured of reaping the windfall the bidder is offering. Conoco shareholders who tendered to Du Pont, for example, received $98 a share for stock they may have bought for only $80 a share at the height of the takeover battle. Shareholders who picked a loser, however, missed out on the winners' premium and, in some cases, even sustained a loss.

Does the apartment fall under rent control or rent stabilization? If so, what guidelines do I use in determining rent for the apartment? ... C.G., Brooklyn Answer:Your building will not be covered by rent control because apartment buildings are not placed under that system unless they have been expelled from the rent stabilization system. It will also not be covered by rent stabilization because that law applies only to buildings with six or more apartments. Thus, unless you are receiving a J-51 tax abatement from the city, you can charge whatever rent you wish, set the length of the lease and whatever increase in rent you want at its termination.",1982-07-25T05:00:00+0000

The Palestinian presence in Lebanon was similar to an independent state until Israel's invasion on June 6. Under the umbrella of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Palestinians maintained an army, a police force, a crude judicial system, an educational and welfare organization, a civil service and a foreign policy.

I am not, let me say, in the process of producing a feminist version of this volume, as a Swedish publisher suggested I should. There will be a certain amount of discreet new-Roget-style rephrasing, but I hope no extravagant claims. It is the very obscurity of some of these women that so interests me; they have no Virago reprint value.The obscure men are interesting too, but not, to me, in quite the same way. John Cunningham (1729-73), author of one successful farce, became an actor, and not a good actor, died in Newcastle, aged 43, and his pages in the British Library were uncut. That is sad, but it is a different style of sadness, and it touches me in a different way from the fates of those women who stretch behind us, some of them wringing their hands, pale, forgotten. ...

That agency is the Food and Drug Administration. Earlier this month, it prohibited the sale of starch blockers saying these purported diet aids are new drugs requiring Federal approval. Now the agency is defending itself in court against 19 manufacturers who claim the products are foods made from beans, not drugs. Last month, the agency began working on labels for aspirin, which has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a children's disease that sometimes follows influenza or chicken pox treated with aspirin. Consumer advocates, however, say agency action is too slow in coming. They said that again last week as they asked the F.D.A. to ban benoxaprofen, a new arthritis treatment, because the drug has been associated with deaths in Britain and the United States. Guiding the agency through this minefield is its commissioner, Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes Jr., who discussed F.D.A. regulatory activities with Michael deCourcy Hinds, a reporter in The New York Times's Washington bureau.

Fall-flowering bulbs may be found at larger garden shops and mail-order suppliers such as John Scheepers (212-422-1177). Plant them with a bit of bone meal, in well-drained soil in window boxes and terrace tubs as well as yards, at a depth approximately twice their diameter. For a free booklet on bulb culture entitled ''From Holland With Love,'' send a self-addressed, stamped, legal-size envelope to Bulbs, P.O. Box 5283, F.D.R.
