The character means exactly what he says. Because God does know, it's up to the Ten Boom family, a family of Dutch Christians living in Haarlem during the Nazi occupation, to rely on that knowledge to accept the terrible things that befall them after they are arrested for helping Jewish refugees.""The Hiding Place,"" which opened yesterday at the Hudson and other theaters, is a pious movie about a very specific kind of faith. It was producedwith no apparent expenses sparedby an adjunct of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. ""The Hiding Place"" is not the sort of film that explores philosophical alternatives. It demonstrates its ideas as dramatically as it's possible to do when there's no real contest.This is not to say the Ten Booms aren't subjected to all sorts of tests, but their faith never wavers. This is a sad story, as well as a true one, based on a book written by Corrie Ten Boom, the only surviving member of the Ten Boom family, after she was released, through a clerical error, from the Ravensbrck concentration camp shortly before the end of the war.The cast includes Julie Harris and Jeannette Clift, as the two middle-age Ten Boom sisters, Arthur O'Connell as their father, and Eileen Heckart as a tough inmate who befriends the sisters on their way to Ravensbrck. The material is not the sort to test the skills of the performers, whose Dutch accents sound quite Swedish on occasion.The film was directed by James F. Collier on locations in the Netherlands and in Britain.",1975-11-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Simon's Comic 'Sunshine Boys' Opens,"For 47 years Al Lewis (George Burns) and Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) had been one of the most successful of all vaudeville comedy teams when they retired 11 years ago, and it's been 12 years since they actually spoke to each other off the stage. Willy hates Al with a fine passion, while Al, as he puts it, doesn't hate Willy; he simply can't stand him.At the start of Neil Simon's new film comedy, ""The Sunshine Boys,"" a broadcasting genius has had the bright idea of reuniting Lewis and Clark in a TV special. The chaos that resultsa lot of it epically funny and all of it cheerfulis the sum and substance of ""The Sunshine Boys,"" which was directed for the screen by Herbert Ross and opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, with the hall's annual Christmas show on the stage.The kind of retirement each man has slipped into describes their differences. Al lives contentedly in New Jersey wtih his married daughter, napping the afternoons away and awaiting the arrival of his grandchildren from school. Willy, who is a widower like Al, remains in the middle of Manhattan, the better to pursue his career as a single, lives in the Ansonia Hotel, plays cards at the Lambs, and occasionally reads for TV commercial jobs he never gets.Al's life is serene. Willy's life has become a continuum of grudgesagainst his nephew-agent Ben (Richard Benjamin), against door locks that never open the same way twice, against people who don't speak up and particularly against Al who, as Willy remembers it, ""retired right in the middle of my career.""Willie and Al, their mutual dislike and their similar habit of asking questions that have just been answered, are all that ""The Sunshine Boys"" has to offer, but with Walter Matthau at the top of his most antisocial form as Willy with George Burns giving a keenly funny, brilliantly straight performance as Al and with Mr. Simon delivering some of his best one-liners, the movie is extremely easy to take.It's only afterward you realize that two complex characters, as well as a unique personal and professional relationship, have been used upwastedin the interests of comedy no more substantial than the insults that Willy and Al throw at each other.There's a moment toward the end of the movie when you get an inkling of the story Mr. Simon chose not to explore. It's during a run-through of Lewis and Clark's ""doctor"" routinea recollection of the great Smith & Dale ""Dr. Kronkhite"" sketchand we are suddenly aware of the stage know-how and the heritage these two old actors represent, though the characters we've seen so far have been fairly standard versions of a couple of ill-humored old men approaching senility.Mr. Burns, now approaching 80, is old enough to be his co-star's father, but he works beautifully with Mr. Matthau, much in the manner in which he played straightman for so many years to his late wife, Gracie Allen. He looks and listens. He uses a minimum of gestures and, by appreciating the chaos he is witnessing, he gives comic importance to the entire enterprise.Without apparent strain, Mr. Simon has opened up his Broadway play to include a lot of local New York color, including a beautifully illogical confrontation between Willy and a garage mechanic when Willy, on his way to an audition, mistakes a garage on West 43d Street with the East 43d Street advertising agency he's looking for. Mr. Matthau is so good playing old men, we may never know when he finally becomes one.",1975-11-07T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Mr. Quilp' Based, Loosely, on Dickens","Dickens may be dead, but anybody trying to pirouette on his grave is going to get broken ankles. Applying musical comedy conventions to his work is like skimming the highlights off a Rembrandt and trying to sell them as a painting. Whether you find him moving or stupefying, Dickens is a grainy accumulation of detailcomic, grotesque, lachrymoseamounting to a complex but integrated whole. Like the man whose character was so strong that he had to change his shirt twice a day, Dickens reeks of himself.""Mr. Quilp,"" a musical film by Anthony Newley that opened yesterday at the Guild Theater, is a boneless and tentative excursion through ""The Old Curiosity Shop."" It starts off fairly directly with the misadventures of Little Nell and her grandfather, but it lags farther and farther behind the mercilessly advancing plot. Soon all you hear are faint voices among the furniture, dwindling finally into the fog that directors pump into Dickens movies when they can't find their way out.To say that ""Mr. Quilp"" is by Anthony Newley is technically inaccurate. The director is Michael Tuchner, and the screenplay, such as it is, was written by Louis and Irene Kamp. But it is clearly fashioned around Mr. Newley as Quilp, the fiendish Cockney entrepreneur who persecutes Little Nell and her grandfather. And Mr. Newley, who seems to be directing himself, also wrote the lyrics and the music.This is part of the problem. Mr. Newley's lyricsexcept for one that may finally put out of their misery the three most abused words in musical comedy: ""somewhere,"" ""sometime"" and ""somehow""are often clever. There is a particularly good one where he catalogues himself as a walking horror who is ""so crooked I have to screw my socks on.""But the music is virtually nonexistent. It runs up and down and goes nowhere. Music can do a lot for a musical. It helped ""Oliver,"" the last Dickens musical around, quite a bit, and it would have been welcome in ""Mr. Quilp.""Without it we are back to Mr. Newley, eyes rolling, teeth like old Gorgonzola, posturing and mugging and putting out his cigara crooked one, of coursein a cucumber sandwich. He is good up to a point, but he can't manage to decide whether he is pantomiming evil or portraying it.When he is on, at least, the picture has a certain vitality. Otherwise it gets by on the pinched-back performance of Sarah Jane Varley as Little Nell, the immovable melancholy of Michael Hordern as her Grandfather and the plain immovableness of David Hemmings, who literally has nothing to do in the role of Richard Swiveller.Bits of Dickens drift in. There are moments when the wanderings of Little Nell and Grandfather, joining first a traveling carnival and then a traveling waxworks, almost become a persuasive image of uprootedness. For the brief time she is on, Jill Bennett does a marvelously palpitating termagant whose feet would stamp except that they don't quite reach the ground.Mostly, though, the picture is becalmed, treacly and about three-quarters of an hour too long.",1975-11-08T05:00:00+0000

As the author was explaining to Mel Gussow (or having him on) in an openingnight interview for this newspaper, he'd been determined to write a play for Mr. Wood for some time when he happened to come across the odd, though not necessarily meaningful, fact that Lenin, Joyce and Tzara all lived in Zurich at the same time during World War 1. Sensing an opportunity for his special brand of cerebral playfulness, and speculating on what it might or mightn't have been like if any two of the three had met, he first thought of turning Wood into Tzara, though he discarded that notion (he says) upon discovering that they didn't look alike. Wood was next to be cast as Joyce, whose riverspill of language he'd have been so capable of managing; no dice there, either, possibly because Joyce just wasn't going to become all that important to the verbal circus (for very good reasons, which I'll get to later). Hence he had no part for him, which led to the one real inspiration that hit him. He'd give him no part, no part to play at all, make him a nobody at a time when the world was coming to nothing, and let him talk a blue streakfantastifications, furies, liesthat would make the sudden emptiness of 1917, and the disintegration of everything from society to language that followed the war years, blitheringly transparent on",1975-11-09T05:00:00+0000

He has a sweet, pretty French mistress, a wife so noble that she won't take money from him, and good chums in the members of his group who call themselves the Stray Cats. But happiness does not buy happiness.That seems to be the point of the terrible English movie, ""Stardust,"" which opened yesterday at the Columbia I and other theaters. The film follows Jim's climb up the ladder to success with such solemnity you suspect it must be joking: ""I'm tired of being locked up in planes and bathrooms, hiding from the people who've made me rich,"" Jim says in one of his bursts of annotated anguish. After all, he tells us without a flicker of a grin, all he's ever wanted to do was to write an opera deifying women.Unfortunately for us he does write that opera, which is also referred to as a rock symphony, and from what we see and hear of it, it seems that Jim has been cribbing from Radio City Music Hall's Easter stage show when the Rockettes dress up like nuns. It's awful. It's also an immense success, viewed by some 300 million people around the world by satellite. From the proceeds of that venture, Jim buys a castle in Spain, where his unhappiness knows no bounds.""Stardust"" is the sequel to an earlier English rock film, ""That'll Be the Day,"" which also starred Mr. Essex and told the story of Jim MacLaine from his grubby beginnings until he bought his first electric guitar.Sometimes the story of Jim and the Stray Cats sounds as if it were meant to recall the rise of the Beatles. Sometimes it suggests the stories of other rock personalities. Mostly, though, it's just superficial claptrap, badly acted (except for Adam Faith, who plays Jim's manager), foolishly written and even more foolishly directed.",1975-11-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Two Fresh and Funny Films on Indonesia and Cuba,"Two men meet at a party. The big one puts out his hand and booms: ""I'm J. Peter Throgmorton. That's me."" The small, sallow one puts out his hand and mumbles: ""I'm Lycurgus Threep. That isn't me.""Michael Rubbo is a Canadian who makes Threeplike documentaries. His theme, as he goes from place to place, is the impossibility of getting at very much reality in any of them.Most documentaries proclaim, stridently or politely: ""This is it,"" or at least, ""This is part of it."" In his two funny fresh and mostly admirable films on Indonesia and Cuba, Mr. Rubbo's message is: ""This isn't it.""The films are being shown by Film Forum at the Vandam Theater through Sunday and, again. Thursday through Nov. 23 at 8 P.M.Mr. Rubbo photographs and asks questions and then asks himself what significance or truth or relevance can possibly be contained in what he has filmed or asked. He and his crew set down their camera in a jammed slum in Jakarta or a mental hospital near Havana. They interrupt life, slide off the realities and leave their footprints all around.But most documentaries carefully conceal their footprints. Mr. Rubbo photographs his.In the film on Indonesia ""Wet Earth and Warm People,"" for example, where Mr. Rubbo is trying to encompass the vast, horrendous population-poverty cycle, we see him visibly lost on a swarming street, wondering what possible question or approach could even begin to make a dent.Husky, copper-bearded, direct, he has that self-awareness so rare in both journalists and film makers. He knows his simple presence is enough to scare off the tenuous clues he is seeking.""My cameraman looks like a small colonialist,"" he muses, standing beside a Landrover from which his crew is unloading equipment. ""I look like one of the Dutch soldiers who used to be here.""He tries: he puts up a line of inquiry. For example he learns that the Jakarta authorities are trying to get rid of the swarms of pedicabs, their place presumably to be taken by taxis. This seems monstrous to him: the one available assetmillions of unemployed legsto be replaced by expensive and polluting gasoline engines.He goes about interviewing a pedicab driver, the Mayor, the Chief of Police; trying to ask why. The answers are vague, bland and polite. Gradually his question fades; so does his own certainty that it is a question to be asked.So he lets his camera roam. There is a splendid sequence showing him projecting a film in a village: in the tropical, bug-ridden night the villagers stare big-eyed at a demonstration of how to build an igloo.Even more surreal is the running relationship of good will and incomprehension between Mr. Rubbo and Indonesia's chief of police. Toward the end he shows the police chief and a few friends, decked out in bright-colored pareus, crooning ""The Way You Look at Me"" on national television.""How much it's calculated is hard to say, but I do know he's trying to change the image of the police,"" Mr. Rubbo comments soberly. He doesn't mock the incongruousness of the scene. He wonders at it, and at his own wonderment. He doesn't spare his own foolishness, and out of it he has constructed a movie that has a beginning of wisdom.""Waiting for Fidel,"" is stronger and tighter but basically it takes the same approach. It is about Cuba, in a way, but it is also about the difficulty in seeing Cuba for what it may be. Again, Mr. Rubbo holds his camera no higher than his own head; it is a perplexed, ambiguous head.What he is filming, in fact, is a traveling argument. His trip to Cuba is taken in the company of two antagonists. One is Joseph Smallwood, a former Premier of Nova Scotia, a lifelong Socialist with a bubbling enthusiasm for the new Cuba. The other is Geoffrey Stirling, a self-made millionaire who is financing the trip and who wields a fierce suspicion of what he is seeing.It is part holiday, part adventure, part inquiry, and it starts with a naive burst of enthusiasm. They have been promised an interview with Fidel Castro. And almost from the first shots it is clear to any journalist who has been promised the same thing that they are in the category of the middling honored visitor: They will get endless hospitality and no interview.While they wait, they take strenuous guided tours around the island. They muse and argue about what they have seen: The fascination is in how little two shrewd and experienced men like Mr. Smallwood and Mr. Stirling really do see.Mr. Rubbo likes the Cuban revolution, but he does not anchor the film to his liking. Perplexity is his instrument for measuring the world, and he never lets go of it.There are disadvantages in the method: a certain blandness, a sameness. If Mr. Rubbo gets around to doing Lapland or Borneo, they may end up more alike than different. He will be standing before the camera in seeming disarray, saying: ""This is Lapland (or Borneo). But it isn't.""But these disadvantages should not mask his accomplishment. Most documentaries are speeches to the audience or stories told to the audience. His come close to being a dialogue.",1975-11-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Other Side of the Mountain',"Just a little more than 20 years ago Jill Kinmont, a 20-year-old California girl, was a sure bet for the United States Olympic ski team. Then, in the course of a trial competition in Utah, Jill took a fall, breaking her neck and becoming paralyzed from the chest down.""The Other Side of the Mountain,"" which opened yesterday at the Columbia 2 and other theaters, is the story of Miss Kinmont's fight to survive as a paraplegic and to find new purpose in her life. According to the film, Jill Kinmont's life really looked very much like a film in which one counts not the years but the lap dissolves, in which every important moment is underscored by a heavenly choir consisting of one voice (Olivia Newton-John's) that, on cue, intones depressing bits of lahrymose philosophy.The life came first, but the movie seems to have less interest in Miss Kinmont than in the devices of romantic fiction that reduce particularity of feeling to a sure-fire formula designed to elicit sentimental responses. If you go to see ""The Other Side of the Mountain,"" load up on handkerchiefs and leave your wits at home. Should you have even half a one with you, you'll be ahead of David Seltzer's screenplay at almost any plastic point.I suspect that Larry Peerce, the director, knew exactly what he was doing in constructing this film the way he did. The audience it's aimed at likes to know in advance each new heartbreak, no matter how clumsily the hints are heaved at them. Such foreknowledge is reassuring and very much a part of the pleasure of weeper movies.Knowing the kind of movie he wanted to make, Mr. Peerce has worked with a singleminded purpose to achieve it. He has an extremely pretty, efficient young actress named Marilyn Hassett to play Jill, and he has Beau Bridges to play the daredevil of a fellowskier, motorcyclist, sky diverwho loves Jill through thick and thin. In a film like this, Mr. Bridges's appearance is the sort of certificate of honor the audience looks for.There are some beautiful ski scenes and some terrifying scenes in the hospital. The movie also contains a couple of moments of genuine feelingall set in a Los Angeles center for the rehabilitation of the handicappedthat raise the over-all tone. Mostly, though, the inspiration one detects in ""The Other Side of the Mountain"" is the inspiration to make the kind of prefabricated romantic movie that every few years turns the American public into a bunch of blubbering idiots.",1975-11-15T05:00:00+0000

So the grateful Berliners have sent to Washington what might be called a cultural CARE package, in the form of a 16performance visit by the Deutsche Oper, West Germany's leading company, the trip being made possible by a halfmilliondollar subsidy by the Berlin and Bonn Governments. (The company can afford it; its annual subsidy from both sources totals $17 million.) The Berlin Opera's visit, one of a series in response to a worldwide invitation by the White House for foreign governments to take part in our Bicentennial, got away to a rather lame start last night with a performance of Lohengrin, in the muchdebated staging by the composer's grandson, Wieland Wagner. Wieland whose often stark, often dark, symbolladen productions revitalized the Bayreuth Festival after World War H, was to have staged this Lohengrin at the Metropolitan Opera in 1966, but he died at the age of 49 about two months before the opening. His conception was carried through by an associate, but nobody can be sure that the production now proclaimed as Wieland Wagner's Lohengrin is actually one he would have recognized. The Washington staging, at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, looks somewhat different from the 1966 version. The first scene of Act II, which at the Met was played out by Ortrud and Telramund in the shadow of a towering turret, has a curved wall that gives one the impression the principals are arguing at the bottom of a cistern.",1975-11-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Finnish 'Earth Is a Sinful Song',"Judging by the readily available evidence, films from Finland arrive here without about the same frequency as kind words from Moscow or Peking. So it is an occasion of more than ordinary note to record not only the arrival of such a film, but also the arrival of a good one.""The Earth Is a Sinful Song"" is the somewhat misleadingly lyrical title of this film, which opens today at the Eighth Street Playhouse. It is based on a novel set in Finnish Lapland in 1947-48 and concerns itself, in unusually intimate detail, with the lives of the inhabitants of a small, rustic community, and with particular emphasis on one familyan old man, his unhappy son, haggard daughter-in-law and teen-age granddaughter.One is tempted to call these lives harsh and brutal. But that would be an urban judgment, passed upon people who exist so close to nature that the appearance of an automobile about midway through the film jars a viewer. No, these lives are simply different, stripped almost bare of what we like to call the amenities of civilization. They have no luxuries. Hardship is omnipresent. Death comes among them frequently, taking people and animals. Pleasures are simplean outdoor dance (where a drifter is killed); drink; religion; the sauna; and sex, indulged in and depicted with a minimum of fuss.The seasons pass. Lives change. People grow up, grow older, die, are killed, are born. The cycle is ancient and eternal; the landscape is literal paradise and figurative hell. Rauni Mollberg, who wrote, produced and directed this film, which was shown at the festivals in Cannes, London, Edinburgh, Berlin and Locarno, gives us stark lives and an impression of witnessing a documentary.Eventsa fatal calving, a reindeer roundup, an initiation into sex, a community religious service, even a partytend to be joyless and devoid of sentiment. Mr. Mollberg seems to save his comment on life for the camerawork by Kari Sohlberg and Hannu Peltomaa. And what they seem to be saying, without incongruity, in scene after scene that dazzles the eye with the glory of nature or caresses the faces of strangers in a way that makes the heart care, is that the human animal is profoundly beautiful.",1975-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Belmondo Is Sleuth in 'Night Caller',"Producers use Jean-Paul Belmondo like a security blanket, and they use him so often he is beginning to resemble one: the nub worn down, the creases gone limp.Through some odd work with the trans-Atlantic scissors, the Franco-Italian production ""Night Caller"" by Henri Verneuil seems to be two completely different movies, neither of them up to much.The overworked Mr. Belmondo is in both of them, and he even plays the same character in both, which saves changing suits. His name is Inspector Le Tellier, and he carries his great nose and jaw structure into battle against criminals and madmen, his misty eyes and bent smile one contemplative pace behind.The main movie is about a deranged man with an artificial eyeball who calls women up and subsequently kills them. Inspector Le Tellier goes to work, but all of a suddenamid screaming women, sinister black leather gloves and oppositely rolling eyeballshe detours to catch a long-sought bank robber.The 15-minute chase has Le Tellier chasing the robber by car through rush-hour Paris and then boarding the new blue-tiled express Mtro line. In a final shoot-out the Inspector plugs the robber in a crowded subway car, dumping him for good measure into the path of an oncoming train.This has absolutely no relation to the madman story. Perhaps it is an advertisement for the new high-speed Paris subways. On the old kind it wouldn't make much sense to have a lot of split-second dashing in and out since the doors open and close with dreamy slowness.Back to the madman. There is this man who decides that women with free-ranging sex lives should be punished. He picks several. They all live in nicely furnished apartments where the phone rings loudly. The madman calls, threatens, and comes around two or three days later to strangle.Le Tellier gets within striking distance of the killer once or twice. There is a long ledge-and-chimney-pot chase that ends inconclusively.Finally, the madman throws a hand grenade into a porno-film theater and is off to hold the star hostage in her apartment. All the top Paris police authorities ask Le Tellier what is to be done. He has the answer. A helicopter lowers him outside the actress's window: he smashes the window and beats the madman to a pulp.That is the end of the two movies. That is two movies out of the way for the priceand the lengthof one.",1975-11-20T05:00:00+0000

us,"Nicholson, the Free Spirit of 'Cuckoo'","People like Randle Patrick McMurphy are foregone conclusions. You gather together at random any 12 men, and one of them will eventually surface as the group's Randle Patrick McMurphy, the organizer, the spokesman, the leading hell-raiser and free spirit, the man who accepts nothing at face value and who likes to shake up the system, sometimes just because it's there. The quality of Randle Patrick McMurphy depends entirely on the intensity of his opposition.Before the start of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" Milos Forman's film version of Ken Kesey's 1962 novel, Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) was strictly small potatoes, his life distinguished by nothing except carelessness.One assumes him to have been a quick-witted but none-too-bright fellow whose vanity, drinking, whoring and short temper have earned him a minor police record consisting mostly of assault - and - battery complaints, concluding with a conviction for statutory rape. The girl, who said she was 19, was only 15.When we first meet Randle, he has served two months of his six-month sentence and has managed to get himself transferred to the state mental hospital for psychiatric observation, figuring that life in the loony bin would be easier than on the prison farm. It's the beginning of the end for Randle, but the ferocity of the system imposes on him a kind of crazy grandeur.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" which opened yesterday at the Sutton and Paramount Theaters, is a comedy that can't quite support its tragic conclusion, which is too schematic to be honestly moving, but it is acted with such a sense of life that one responds to its demonstration of humanity if not to its programmed metaphors.Once in the bin, Randle becomes the self-proclaimed champion of the rights of the other ward patients, his adversary being Nurse Ratched, a severe, once-pretty woman of uncertain age who can be sympathetic and understanding only in ways that reinforce her authority. Nurse Ratched represents the System that all Randles must buck.As played by Louise Fletcher and defined in the screenplay by Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman, the film's Nurse Ratched is a much more interesting, more ambiguous character than in Mr. Kesey's novel, though what we take to be her fleeting impulses of genuine concern only make the film's ending that much more unbelievable.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is at its best when Mr. Forman is exercising his talents as a director of exuberant comedy that challenges preconceived notions of good taste. It's not too far from the mark to describe Randle as a sort of Mister Roberts who finds himself serving aboard the U.S.S Madhouse. It's to Mr. Forman's credit that the other patients in the ward, though suffering from all sorts of psychoses, are never patronized as freaks but are immediately identifiable as variations on ourselves, should we ever go over the edge of what's called sanity.Mr. Nicholson slips into the role of Randle with such easy grace that it's difficult to remember him in any other film. It's a flamboyant performance but not so overbearing that it obscures his fellow actors, all of whom are very good and a few of whom are close to brilliant, including William Redfield (as an egghead patient who talks grave nonsense), Will Sampson (as a deaf-mute Indian) and Brad Dourif (as a young man with a fatal mother complex).There are some unsettling things about ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" I suspect that we are meant to make connections between Randle's confrontation with the oppressive Nurse Ratched and the political turmoil in this country in the 1960's. The connection doesn't work. All it does is conveniently distract us from questioning the accuracy of the film's picture of life in a mental institution where shock treatments are dispensed like aspirins and lobotomies are prescribed as if the mind's frontal lobes were troublesome wisdom teeth.Even granting the artist his license, America is much too big and various to be satisfactorily reduced to the dimensions of one mental ward in a movie like this.",1975-11-20T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen:'Human Factor,' Story of Bloody Vengeance","Vigilante justice, one of the oldest movie staples, is given improbable and gory treatment in ""The Human Factor,"" which opened yesterday at local theaters. The idea of an intellectual's taking the law into his own hands is no newer than, say, last year's ""Death Wish."" But ""The Human Factor,"" despite technological trappings, political innuendo and colorful Italian locales, evolves as a manipulated affair that is no more convincing than its lackluster direction, pedestrian performances and jerry-built script.A modicum of tension is initially generated when George Kennedy, playing an American computer expert with NATO forces in Naples, discovers that the wanton slaughter of his wife and three children is the work of terrorists who, it is dimly indicated, will continue killing expatriate Americans at random if ""political prisoners"" aren't freed.If our shocked hero deserves sympathy, it is diluted when, aided by a good deal of somewhat unbelievable computer sleuthing, he is able not only to unearth the gangsters but also to mow them down singly or en masse in bloodbath style. The gang members, led by Frank Avianca, who is also the film's producer, are a blatantly callous lot who stack the emotional cards in favor of Mr. Kennedy.His drive for vengeance may be conceivable, but it's not entirely logical. Despite the pleas of John Mills, as his NATO scientific sidekick, to let the police do the dirty work, the highly intellectual Mr. Kennedy emerges in effect as a violent man who, under stress, doesn't seem to be much better than the murderers he systematically seeks out and destroys.His characterization of a man racked by grief and hate is generally restrained and occasionally touching. But Mr. Mills as well as Raf Vallone, as the police inspector; Rita Tushingham, as Mr. Kennedy's colleague; Barry Sullivan, as an American Embassy official, and Arthur Franz, as the NATO general, are serious but perfunctory in largely surface stints.In this case, ""The Human Factor"" is no more persuasive than its contrived and bloody melodrama.",1975-11-20T05:00:00+0000

Maternal and infant mortality was appallingly high in those days. As recently as World War I (according to the National Center for Health Statistics), more than 700 out of every 100,000 women died in childbirth, and 96 out of every 1,000 babies died before the age of 1. As the developing specialty of obstetrics attacked this problem, women were persuaded to have their babies in hospitals, and to be delivered by physicians. Today it is rare for a woman to die in childbirth, and infant mortality down to 16.5 per 1,000 live births. And today there are only a handful of granny midwives left, still legally delivering babies, mostly in rural areas the South and Southwest.",1975-11-23T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Rancho':Spoof Western Opens at the D.W. Griffith,"""Rancho DeLuxe"" is handsome, witty, apt and languid. It is so cool it is barely alive. First-rate ingredients and a finesse in assembling them do not quite make either a movie or a cake. At some point it is necessary to light the oven.""Rancho,"" which opened yesterday at the D. W. Griffith Theater, is a kind of parody Western, a genre barely younger than the Western itself. And as long as Frank Perry, the director, and Thomas McGuane, the writer, are being wry about ranch owners who ride around in helicopters and ranch hands whose chores include vacuuming the rancher's Navajo rugs, they do extremely well.All their characters are phonies, and this is fine. They are often very funny phonies. But the heroestwo fey and charming young rustlers who saw up other people's cows as an existential actare infested with humorous self-pity.Through them the portentous message creeps in: the West is dead and inhabited by maggots. Nothing happens to the message; it doesn't go anywhere. It is used as dcor, dressing the set in a fashionable tone of lavender.Affectations aside, there is a great deal that this picture does well. It relates the ill-starred but decidedly non-tragic war between the two rustlers, Jack and Cecil, and the rancher, John Brown.They begin by shooting a cow or two and sawing them up with a portable chainsaw. They go on to hold a prize bull for ransomin a motel bedroom  and finally they attempt to steal a whole trailer-rig of cattle in partnership with Brown's ranch-hands.Jack, played a bit too fatly and lovably by Jeff Bridges, is a rich boy who has left his wife and bums around with Cecil, a literate and spaced-out Indian.Both of them move through a perpetual haze of self-parody. As they drive their pickup truck off from one cow-killing, one asks the other: ""Do you believe in the tooth fairy?""When Jack makes love to one of two sisters who hang out with them, he slips on a comic dog mask at the crucial moment.Cecil, very well acted by Sam Waterston, makes jokes about being an Indian. ""Let's burn and pillage,"" he suggests to Jack as the two sit around with nothing much to do.They are blatantly inauthentic rustlers, and they know it. Their self-knowledge and their deliberate kookiness is their commentaryand the film'son Western pretensions of retaining old values while in fact living off all the comforts and shortcuts of urban American life.The film's other characters are just as inauthentic, but without self-consciousness, and this makes them much funnier. Brown, the rancher, wears lumberjack shirts and goes on about preserving ""a West that's free."" In fact he is a refugee from the hair-dressing business back East and wears his cattleman image as a child wears a soldier suit.His wife puts in game appearances at cattle shows, tries to seduce the ranch hands with war cries of ""how about a little desire under the elms?"" and longs to go back East. Their lavish ranch house is airless, and its picture windows frame the spectacular mountain scenery as if it were, in fact, no more than pictures.Brown's two ranch hands are just as phony. One is a former appliance repairman, the other used to model hot combs. Their beautifully indirect inveiglement by Jack and Cecil into becoming their accomplices, played out in a bar, is the best scene in the movie.As a decrepit and seemingly inept professional rustler-detective, hired by Brown, Slim Pickens for once has a strongly written comic role. He plays it with great effect, and Charlene Dallas, as his sluttish assistant, is almost as good.Their earthy roles and acting styles do a lot to liven up a picture whose artfulness is marred by its own narcissistic excess.",1975-11-24T05:00:00+0000

It's not that the oldfashioned kind of pants is going to wither awayit's simply that nobody raises an eyebrow anymore; most employers accept them and it's a rare restaurateur who dares bar the doorway to women pants. The acceptance by the older crowd, who finds that at least pants keep them warm in winter, has made the more adventurous woman look for a new kind of fashion excitement. And since fashion designers abhor a vacuum, there they are with a new breed of trouser fashions. Some are bloused at the ankles, like parachutists uniforms (an effect that can easily be duplicaled by pushing standard straightleg trousers into short boots), and some are cropped various intervals from above the knees to above the ankles. Attaching the pants to shirts or blouses and creating the jumpsuit, much the way some clever manufacturer in the early part of this century attached shirtwaists to skirts to create the dress, is another way designers give pants new interest. The jumpsuit has been the big runaway success story in fashion this fall. Croppedleg versions are an important entry for spring. Illustrated above are three ways Victor ions has rescued pants for the young crowd in his spring collection for Cuddlecoat. Abovetheknee version, left, resembles Bermuda shorts but is in the new onepiece form. Jumpsuit at center is cropped below the knees. Pants at the right are cut off above the ankles and have an adjustable stringtied waistline.

us,"De Funes, in 'Delusions,' Keeps the Gags Rolling","The refreshing thing about the frenetic comedy of Louis De Funes, one of France's biggest box-office stars, is that it seems to be adrift in time. Whether the setting is contemporary, as in ""The Mad Adventures of 'Rabbi' Jacob,"" seen here last year, or 17th-century Spain, as in ""Delusions of Grandeur,"" which opened at two theaters yesterday, Mr. De Funes seems always to be operating within his own tiny universe, out of touch with everything except his own ill humor, his greed and his schemes to cheat that inevitably fail.Though his comedy is studiously untopical, it is far from being timeless in the manner of the truly great screen comediansChaplin, Keaton, Tati. Indeed, he is funny just because the character he has created seems so furiously petty. It's not simply that this character doesn't possess a generous bone in his body, he also has absolutely no awareness of this fact.In ""Delusions of Grandeur,"" directed by Gerard Oury in 1971, two years before he collaborated with the actor on ""The Mad Adventures,"" Mr. De Funes plays a corrupt but supremely unsuccessful tax minister in the court of the King of Spain. Yves Montand plays the minister's roguish valet and the plot has some connection with Victor Hugo's ""Ruy Blas""though it's a very loose one.The settings are splendid and the gags, some quite funny, are nonstop as Mr. De Funes maneuvers transparently to discredit the queen in order to win back the favor of the king.Mr. Montand looks uneasy under these circumstances. He's a good comedian himself, but it must be trying to act with someone who mugs as outrageously as Mr. De Funes, who also is given the best of the cheerfully foolish lines. ""Did you get my anonymous letter?"" he asks the king at one point.I also liked the pledge of a group of noblemen who are plotting to overthrow the king: ""All for one and every man for himself.""",1975-11-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Obsessed 'Romantic Englishwoman',"Lewis Fielding (Michael Caine) and his wife, Elizabeth (Glenda Jackson), think they have nothing when they have everything, which is just one of the curious reversals that keeps Joseph Losey's ""The Romantic Englishwoman"" interesting long after you've decided that something is decidedly wrong with it.Lewis is a successful novelist and screenwriter. He and his wife have a handsome young son, a big, comfortable house in the country, access to other beautiful/successful people and no maid problems. Lewis and Elizabeth love each other too much or not enough?When Elizabeth gets bored and runs off to Baden-Baden for a weekend, Lewis becomes obsessed with fantasies of her imaginary infidelities. The first two things Elizabeth does when she comes home, is to race to her bedroom, and then to the au pair's, to search for signs of Lewis's hanky-panky with the domestic help. This shared, obsessive fretfulness keeps Lewis and Elizabeth in a state of high, apparently pleasurable, sexual tension until Lewis has the had taste to stage-direct their lives to simulate melodrama.""The Romantic English-woman,"" which opened at two theaters yesterday, is about an unequal, threesomeLewis, Elizabeth and Thomas (Helmut Berger); a self-styled poet and gigolo who sometimes makes ends meet by smuggling heroin, across national boundaries. When Thomas turns up in England after having met Elizabeth in Baden-Baden, Lewis invites the young man to live with them. Lewis has just begun to write a screenplay about a woman, unhappy in her perfect marriage, who runs off to the Continent to find herself and in the process falls in love with another man.""The Romantic Enslishwoman"" is an exceedingly elegant looking movie. It isn't just posh locales and handsome interior decoration that give this effect. The camera sees everything with a singular kind of appreciation for its high-priced mostly cold beauty. The camera is also obsessed with reflections of reality, which, I suppose; is one of the things the movie is meant to be about.The film opens with a reflection of Miss Jackson's face in the train window en route to Baden-Baden. Scene after scene begins in such a way that one can't be quite sure whether one is seeing the real thing or a mirror image. When late in the film Elizabeth finally does fall in love with the gigolo, the question is raised, what has come first, the true passion or its reflection that is, Lewis's suspicions?The screenplay, by Tom Stoppard (author of Broadway's ""Travesties"") and Thomas Wiseman, is full of the sort of auto-critique that seems designed to earn the film makers congratulations for the film they've made and forestall outside criticism. Early in the movie, when a producer asks Lewis to write a script about ""the new woman,"" Lewis says with a sigh, ""It sounds very boring. Why not turn it into a thriller?""Mr. Losey and his writers have not turned ""The Romantic Englishwoman"" into a thriller. They've attempted to make an intelligent film about intelligent people, and as long as Mr. Berger is kept off the screen, it is. Mr. Caine and Miss Jackson are interesting performers. When they are supposed to be thinking, puzzling things out, or caught up in feelings beyond their control, we believe it.Mr. Berger is something else. It's impossible to know when he's supposed to represent fraudulence within the film or if he's simply being himself, a not very good actor defrauding the film of a performance.He's a missing element and the movie, unequally balanced, goes off into a wobbly, out-of-control orbit as a result. When we should be moved or intellectually engaged, we are more inclined to snicker. Which is too bad, since ""The Romantic English-woman"" is in many other ways a film of feeling, tact and intelligence.",1975-11-27T05:00:00+0000

Mary, in flight from her comfortable home, meets Florian from the underside of society, and their intertwined destiny works itself out in sordid rooms, dim bars, greasy spoons. He becomes a succubus eating out her substance; she realizes too late the bankruptcy of her position. Miss Albert conveys intensely the girl's inability to throw off her beginnings, which she carries around with her like original sin, and she reveals, too, the damning shapes that poverty takes.
