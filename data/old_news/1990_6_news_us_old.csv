Mr. Zuck said the craft uses an overhead rotor to take off and land vertically; once it reaches the selected altitude, the overhead rotor stops turning and a rear-mounted propeller pushes the craft forward. To work properly, he added, the wings rotate into a verticle position during takeoff so they do not block air movement through the overhead rotor. During forward flight, the wings rotate back to a normal horizontal position.",1990-06-02T05:00:00+0000

They are still coming down the runways and the fashionable boulevards looking that Coco way. Perhaps Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel (1883-1971) did not actually create the concept of chic. But she at least redefined it in a way that has had lasting meaning. What was so special about this woman? She was well known to be a fabricator of more than boucle wool suits and little black dresses, having reinvented her past, quite romantically, in interviews she gave after achieving fame and fortune. Given the pretensions that then and forever adhere to people who wear the most fashionable clothes, it could be disconcerting to know that an illegitimate daughter of a traveling salesman created the style of the times. Her history has always been rather sketchy. Hence, one presumes, the need for another Chanel biography. Casting Chanel as the personification of postwar feminism in Europe, Axel Madsen, the author of biographies of Yves Saint Laurent and John Huston, has gone back over Chanel's childhood, poring over provincial church records and such to trace her life in a kind of plodding chronological order. For all the rigor of this approach and its abundance of fascinating and extraneous detail, it frequently remains hard to imagine how she came to be who she was and to wield such an enduring power. ''Chanel: A Woman of Her Own'' takes the reader behind the coromandel veneers of Chanel's life, and what is found there turns out to be less than startling. When one examines the facts of her life - the orphaned childhood, the series of tempestuous, ill-fated romantic liaisons, the dalliance with a Nazi occupier in Vichy France, the rumors of lesbianism and drug use - they would seem to make for highly dramatic biography. Somehow, they do not.",1990-06-03T05:00:00+0000

But he concealed his identity and worked as a translator for the German police. ''In the Lion's Den'' carefully recounts the nine months in 1942 that he helped Jews and partisans while ostensibly serving the Germans. Nechama Tec, a professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut, Stamford, chronicles his other identities - shoemaker, prisoner, Jewish resistance fighter, exile in a nunnery - and his present life, at the age of 68, as Brother Daniel, a Roman Catholic convert, priest and Carmelite monk in Israel. Especially riveting are the details of his translations for his German superiors, in which his careful change of two words could save an entire Jewish community. Ms. Tec, the author of two other books on the Holocaust and a survivor herself, has a good eye for historical detail. She illuminates the Russian partisan movement and its connection to the Jewish resistance fighters. She captures well the emotional complexity of Mr. Rufeisen's position, but could have better analyzed and described his successive religious philosophies. At times the author seems too close to her subject. She quotes him extensively, praising and arguing with him instead of trusting his strange story to speak for itself. Another biographer might have been tempted to label Mr. Rufeisen a hero, or an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances, or a religious zealot. To Ms. Tec's credit, she allows these contradictions to coexist in her pages. The portrait of Oswald Rufeisen that emerges from ''In the Lion's Den'' is that of a humanist still desperately searching for a way to fathom the Holocaust.",1990-06-03T05:00:00+0000

us,  NONFICTION,"GREAT OCEAN: An Authorized Biography of the Buddhist Monk Tenzin Gyatso His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama. By Roger Hicks and Ngakpa Chogyam. (Penguin, Paper, $8.95.) The story of His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet is almost mythic in its beginning: the 2-year-old child who, in 1936, unerringly picked from a series of paired objects (two rosaries, two walking sticks, two drums) the one that had belonged to his predecessor, the 13th Dalai Lama, and eventually ascended to spiritual and political leadership of Tibet. But with the Chinese military occupation of Tibet in the 1950's, a harsher reality overtook the man Tibetans call Tenzin Gyatso, ''The Ocean of Wisdom.'' In 1959, the 25-year-old Dalai Lama fled in disguise on horseback over the Himalayas to India. As ''Great Ocean'' makes clear, in a sense he took the spirit of old Tibet with him for safekeeping: in the years to come the Chinese Communists destroyed more than 6,000 Tibetan temples and monasteries and killed tens of thousands of monks and nuns, as well as hundreds of thousands of Tibetans who resisted. In India the Dalai Lama set up a democratic government in exile to aid the growing flood of Tibetan refugees, to rebuild Tibet's culture in pockets of settlement abroad and to plan for the day when he could once again return - a mission that once seemed quixotic but now has the ring of plausibility, in the wake of Tiananmen Square and the fall of the Berlin Wall. For those who seek a picture of Tibet's suffering under the Chinese and of the Dalai Lama's remarkable response - he declines to get angry with the Chinese, though he opposes their rule - John F. Avedon's ''In Exile From the Land of Snows'' remains the biography of choice. But ''Great Ocean'' is an excellent introduction to the 1989 Nobel Peace Price laureate, an evocative thumbnail sketch. What shines through in this telling of the tale - by Roger Hicks, an independent scholar, and Ngakpa Chogyam, who teaches Buddhism in Britain - are the personal qualities that distinguish this monk turned statesman: candor, compassion and a gentleness of spirit.",1990-06-03T05:00:00+0000

In the contrary ways of Wall Street, this may actually be good news, say portfolio strategists, who believe that as long as investors remain skeptical prices can go higher. But when too many investors become optimistic, goes the theory, prices have nowhere to go but down. A weekly survey of investment advisory newsletters by Investors Intelligence, a research firm in New Rochelle, N.Y., found last week that the number of advisers who describe themselves as bears is still high. In the past, the cautious advisers often became more bullish, just as prices peaked. As long as these advisers remain cautious, the market could go higher, say portfolio strategists who monitor the market sentiment numbers.

us,Headliners;   Smooth Exit,"In Derek C. Bok's two decades as president of Harvard, he has become practiced in perhaps the most prestigious job in higher education, and the university has become a more settled place. The endowment has quintupled, Harvard and Radcliffe are peaceably merged, and the new ''core curriculum'' is not new anymore. So the 60-year-old Mr. Bok said last week that he would give up the job. In 1970 Mr. Bok, then the dean of Harvard Law School, was seen as conciliator for a university worn out by antiwar protests. By and large, he was. One hitch was the law school, where the faculty waged marathon ideological quarrels and Mr. Bok alienated some among the liberal faction. But there was much praise last week, including a comment by John Kenneth Galbraith, professor emeritus of economics, about Mr. Bok's ''amiable response to intrusive and even obnoxious professors.''",1990-06-03T05:00:00+0000

The ''Bison'' of this fact-based, eulogistic novel is the great Soviet geneticist Nikolai V. Timofeyev-Resovsky, who died in 1981. Daniil Granin, a Soviet writer who is now a member of the Soviet Parliament, openly admires his subject and assumes that readers are familiar with Timofeyev-Resovsky and numerous other personalities of his country's scientific community. Mr. Granin drops enormous numbers of names, leaving the uninitiated reader feeling excluded. Eventually, however, one can't help getting caught up in the gripping tale of Timofeyev-Resovsky's life, which began in czarist Russia and ended at the dawn of glasnost. (He was given the nickname Bison because of his physical heaviness and strength and his ''oxen stubbornness,'' and because he was a survivor of a bygone era, pre-Soviet Russia.) ''The Bison'' picks up speed when the brilliant young scientist leaves in 1924 to run a research institute outside Berlin; he stays for years and ends up spending the war there, on enemy soil. As Hitler rises to power, the Bison barely notices, partly because he is absorbed in his research and partly because he won't believe what is happening. But when he can no longer ignore the facts, he uses his high position to help save Jewish colleagues and turns a blind eye to the dangerous anti-Nazi activities of his son, Foma. Betrayed by an acquaintance, Foma is caught, sent to Mauthausen and executed. Back in the Soviet Union after the war, the father is arrested by Stalin's henchmen and shipped to a labor camp. The Bison's story is told in brief, engrossing anecdotes, flawlessly translated by Antonina W. Bouis. These segments join to create a vivid rendition of a crucial period in history, a portrait that is particularly stirring in light of recent events in Eastern Europe.",1990-06-03T05:00:00+0000

Alan Trosper, the hero of William Hood's previous novel, ''Spy Wednesday,'' is happily in from the cold and out of the Firm, the fictional United States intelligence agency for which he worked as a case officer. Trosper is just beginning to enjoy his new life in London with his new British wife when an old comrade-in-espionage contracts a rapidly fatal disease. Traces of a Soviet poison are found during an autopsy, and so, at the behest of his old employers, Trosper sets forth to find out who killed his friend and why. British intelligence is miffed at having an American ''cousin'' snooping around on British soil, and early on it is clear that William Hood himself presumes to trespass on literary territory mapped by another former intelligence man, John le Carre. Mr. Hood's novel is peopled with eccentrics of the spy trade and the narrative is far-flung and ambitious, ranging from Byelorussia in 1943 to London, Washington, Florence, Zurich, Vienna and Geneva in the preglasnost days before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Mr. Hood - who spent 30 years in American military intelligence, the O.S.S. and the C.I.A. - endeavors to show us these cities as agents see them, locales reduced to safe houses and offices where spy handlers fret. And he has knit a plot so intricate that readers may need some time to unravel it. Mr. Hood compels us to turn the pages, though his prose rarely rises to anything more than a serviceable level. Ultimately, ''Cry Spy'' disappoints; it ends clumsily, with characterization and plausibility falling away like bad cover.",1990-06-03T05:00:00+0000

Powered by turbofan jet engines, the propeller device has eight forward and nine aft blades.

This collection of Mr. McDowall's elegant photographs of 116 eminent subjects - culled primarily from the stage, film and music worlds - is amplified with commentaries by other celebrities. Predictably, most of these are valentines, but even so contain revelations. ''I suppose as much as I hated most of what he was and did, I somehow knew that he couldn't help it and I loved what was left,'' confides Blake Edwards about Peter Sellers. ''His critiques of films are subtle and can be very amusing, especially of the ones he hasn't seen,'' remarks David Hockney about Billy Wilder. Mr. Wilder, in turn, tells a priceless story recalling bittersweet difficulties directing Jean Arthur in ''A Foreign Affair'' and her phoning him 40 years later. Jane Fonda shares her view of Gregory Peck as ''a sensualist with a Lincolnesque demeanor.'' Other pairings include Helen Hayes on Ina Claire, Charlton Heston on Katharine Cornell, Bette Davis on Claude Rains, Neil Simon on Joan Rivers, Sir John Gielgud on Vivien Leigh, Jules Feiffer on Al Hirschfeld, Zubin Mehta on Beverly Sills and Ringo Starr on Mae West.

But he was no fool when ABC's ''Nightline'' summoned him to tape an interview not long ago; he prepared several convincing sound bites, the standard verbal unit of the electronic media. Two of his carefully sharpened sound bites made it onto the air, whereupon his mother phoned to tell him, ''You looked wonderful, dear, but you didn't really say anything, did you?'' ''Of course not,'' he replied. ''That wasn't the point.'' The point, perhaps, is that in America today, bite makes right. If it sounds like a ''sound bite,'' the ideally compact and colorful remarks by ''talking heads,'' for which television journalists strive tirelessly and around which news pieces are usually constructed, then it must be meaningful (except, naturally, to vigilant relatives). The term has entered the general language with a vengeance, where it lends comments about the media a casual knowingness. Another friend, normally a stranger to television shoptalk, surprised me by saying, as we watched a Government official on a recent network news piece, ''That was a good bite.''

The neatly trimmed grass, the blue canopy and Art Deco mosaic tiles over the front doors of the white, two-story building just two blocks from the serene Pacific, is an odd setting for a soup kitchen. Private volunteers of Family Assistance Involving the Homeless, or Faith, serve 250 or 300 people a hot supper and dessert. Several park rangers stand around in case of trouble, but on this sunny, cool afternoon the line moves quietly along the perimeter of bright green grass toward the tables of food. Wearing down jackets and windbreakers (one or two men are in suits) and carrying knapsacks, duffel bags or black plastic garbage bags, the homeless seem mostly in their 20's or 30's; some are black, some white; men far outnumber women.

But the membership was especially exercised when it was disclosed in early 1989 that Ms. Wine-Banks's attorney had been designated a special prosecutor to seek sanctions against a veterinarian who had unsuccessfully treated her pet Dalmatian. That led Eugene Thomas, a former A.B.A. president, to urge her removal, writing to bar group leaders that Ms. Wine-Banks ''does not understand the use of power and lacks a sense of decorum and propriety.'' But the group's president, L. Stanley Chauvin Jr., said she had done an ''outstanding'' job.

His first Tony, in 1973, was for his role in ''Two for the Seesaw.''

Mrs. Mayhew, now 23 years old, was a senior at Westside High School in Omaha when she and other students were denied school sponsorship of their club. School officials reasoned that to give the group recognition, and the same modest perks enjoyed by such after-school groups as the chess and scuba clubs, would violate the First Amendment prohibition against government aid to religious organizations. But the students, in the role of plaintiffs, said the officials violated the Constitutional right to the free exercise of religion, as well as the freedom of speech and assembly. Their case later became a test of a Federal statute, championed by the religious right, guaranteeing religious groups the same access that other student groups have to public schools. Last week, in Board of Education v. Mergens, the Supreme Court upheld the law in an 8-to-1 vote. Mrs. Mayhew said later that ''it's a source of strength to be able to share your faith.''",1990-06-10T05:00:00+0000

Then there was the curious fact that this flashy celebration of junk bonds was taking place just as the red-hot market for the high-yield securities was flaming out. And finally, there was a sense of deja vu, as Merrill's C.E.O., William A. Schreyer, announced, ''We aim to become No. 1 in the high-yield market.'' Not many months before, he had shut down businesses in New York and London for which he had once proclaimed a similiar goal.",1990-06-10T05:00:00+0000

Now there is also Sir Arthur Keith, museum conservator of the Royal College of Surgeons. In a new book, ''Piltdown: A Scientific Forgery,'' Prof. Frank Spencer of the City University of New York says Dr. Keith, who had hypothesized the early evolution of an enlarged human brain, hatched the plot with Mr. Dawson, helping to doctor the human skull fragment and orangutan jaw that Mr. Dawson later ''discovered'' in 1912.

Pound and Lilli Gordon, contend that the score changes if eight other cases, in which dissidents accomplished only some of their objectives, are included. Dissidents racked up complete or partial victories in 11 out of the 14 cases where there has been resolution. The review of the record indicates a surprising beneficiary: D. F.

us,  FICTION,"PIRATE JENNY. By April Bernard. (Norton, $18.95.) Can a teen-age girl obsessed with Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya survive on the streets of Manhattan? The amoral antiheroine of this frustrating first novel by the poet April Bernard is immediately familiar: bored, alienated Connie Frances LaPlante is the product of a broken home in a dull New England town. Taking drugs and stealing pass the time until, ''enticed by the sinful looks of the striped skirts and rouged faces on the cover,'' she discovers a recording of ''The Threepenny Opera'' in the local library. The music ''was like absolutely nothing she ever heard before - a raggedy, wild sound'' with ''dark, fast ballads advertising a life of theft and agility.'' Especially entranced with Lenya's devilishly droll singing of ''Pirate Jenny,'' Connie transforms herself into a ludicrous caricature of Brecht's cynical demimondaine, renaming herself Jenny Freuhoffer. As Jenny, Connie affects a ''Cherman'' accent, steals her mother's car, pockets her boyfriend's buddy's money, robs a shopping mall for clothes, has her hair dyed blood red and lights out for the big bad city. There, in what we would expect to be a comedy of errors, Jenny slinks into New York society; what we get, unfortunately, is an unsavory rogue's progress as Jenny victimizes friends and foes alike. A temporary job assisting a catered birthday party for rich Upper East Side brats leads her to a full-time position as governess to a creaky family of bigoted White Russians, whom she milks for everything she can get. She lets her elderly employer fondle her so she can investigate the family finances. He gives her money for classes, which she uses as an excuse to leave the house and haunt the city's sleazier corners. She seduces the spoiled older granddaughter's gutless boyfriend and rifles the family's possessions, carrying on with such chilly disregard that, like a character from Brecht, she begins to evoke a rakish charm. But when her sad-sack mother eventually tracks her down, roguery gives way to villainy, blackmail and a capricious marriage. ''Pirate Jenny'' ends on a nihilistic downbeat with Ms. Bernard's heroine neither paying for her crimes nor deriving wisdom from her experiences. She merely survives: a pirate in a world of easy, eager victims.",1990-06-17T05:00:00+0000

Then, when she exits (or is dumped), move in and pick up his wealthy pieces. The smart ones are the ''Seconds.'' Here they are Sienna, Anne and Bronwyn, second wives of men with billion-dollar fortunes and hopes of becoming ambassadors. These fortyish women learn that ''the best job for a very smart woman was marriage to a very successful man,'' a lesson passed along by a widow named Virginia Payne North, who has made them her protegees in social climbing. But while each of the ''seconds'' is enterprising and grows wealthy in her own right, they all share a haunting guilt over a tragedy that occurred many years earlier at a camp for troubled teen-agers. The camp's director, Gregory Sawyer, who has ''made a living out of being sensitive to rich women's needs,'' re-enters their lives to prey on Virginia by blackmailing her three friends. Will Gregory wreck their opulent new lives? Can they continue to reign at New York's most chic charity luncheons? Unless you're fascinated by the life styles of the rich and liposuctioned, you may not want to know. But just when you're ready to hurl this paean to ulteriority and the Junk Bond Generation aside, redemption seeps in, in the form of love. Sienna does love her husband, the only worthy man in the book. Anne, whose ''carefully nursemaided'' children were taught ''not to expect their parents more than twice a week,'' begins to nurture them. Bronwyn pursues a dream of romance. Ms. Wyse, an advertising executive who is the author of several nonfiction books, provides a warm, if slick and predictable turn to a novel that seems tailor-made for its own second life as a television mini-series.",1990-06-17T05:00:00+0000

In the film's final adventure episode, set in a zoo, she is moved to rescue Mel Gibson from hungry tigers. What gives her that last boost of energy is the possibility that Mr. Gibson's character, having long ago left her at the altar, is finally ready for marriage.",1990-06-17T05:00:00+0000

Collets, at 129 Charing Cross Road, was out of the Falk map, too, but expected a supply in any day. My order for a copy was filled in May, with the 12th edition, at $:4.50, or about $7.

us,Currency;   Losing Steam at the Close,"The dollar fizzled as the week ended. It closed slightly lower against the German mark, after managing to trade at times above the key level of 1.70 marks to the dollar. Dealers said the dollar still appeared to be locked in a fairly narrow band of trading, despite the release of a slew of economic indicators in the United States. The reason: The dealers were doubtful that the latest batch of data would spur a change in the Federal Reserve's credit stance. On Friday, a large dollar sale in Europe, rumored to be by West Germany's Bundesbank, slowed whatever momentum the currency had gained from the positive economic data released early in the day. At the close of trading, the dollar finished the week lower against all major currencies. ",1990-06-17T05:00:00+0000

But last week she was on the plane, for her first visit in 31 years, and when she stepped off a crowd began the anti-apartheid anthem, ''God Bless Africa.'' Exile has been a success, professionally speaking. In the 1960's, Miss Makeba became one of the first African performers to gain a popular following in the United States. More recently, she joined Paul Simon's Graceland tour, and in March she sang at the Apollo Theater. She has lived in the United States, Europe and Guinea, and represented Guinea at the United Nations. After she gave an anti-apartheid speech there in 1976, her songs were banned on South African broadcasts for 13 years. Miss Makeba planned no performances on this trip.

The music stopped in 1973 when she was found to have multiple sclerosis. She lived almost 14 years in a wheelchair until her death at the age of 42 in 1987. Carol Easton's biography, the first since du Pre's death, is brimming with wonderful quotations from more than 100 friends, teachers and musicians. ''She was like champagne, freshly uncorked, all the time,'' says the violinist Hugh Maguire. ''She had more than us,'' says her dressmaker. ''She had more of everything: more body, more heart, more talent, more energy, more soul, more emotion.'' Ms. Easton, the author of two previous biographies, provides a readable story of du Pre's life and work, not a scholarly biography. She does not attribute all quotations, is vague about dates and neglects both a bibliography and a discography of available recordings by du Pre. Worse, Ms. Easton - perhaps because she is seeking conflict, not paeans - conjectures that du Pre, who had been a child prodigy, led an unfulfilled life. This pop-psychology theory is often contradicted, even by du Pre herself, who loved the concert experience: ''Walking on stage - the recognition, the applause, the rumble of interest from the audience when I appeared. . . . I thought of the audience as a group of friends who had come to hear me play, and I found that very moving.'' The tragedy was not her life but the silencing of her genius.",1990-06-17T05:00:00+0000

Things were not going well anyway - she can't stand his friends, he fired her assistant, his affairs are more or less public - and the two have lived apart for half of their 23-year marriage.

In ''Outcats,'' the jazz critic Francis Davis has collected a number of the articles he wrote in the late 1980's. He casts a wide net, covering renowned musicians like Cecil Taylor, Sun Ra and Wynton Marsalis; lesser-knowns like the Parisian expatriate Steve Lacy; and jazzwomen like Jane Ira Bloom and Michele Rosewoman. The tissue connecting these disparate musicians is Mr. Davis's conviction that jazz experimentation succeeds not as an end, but as a means of measuring good craft. Elements of reportage and portraiture give his better critical assessments a sense of intimacy. Writing of the South African exile Abdullah Ibrahim, ''a mesmerizing pianist whose rhythms splash across the keyboard in thunderous ostinato waves,'' he notes, ''As with Ellington, you can hear the colors of an orchestra bleeding together and separating in the voicing of each chord.'' Although references to Duke Ellington do not dominate these pages, the Ellington leitmotif courses through like a bright minor chord. His prose may be dry in parts, but Mr. Davis has the considerable gift of focusing our attention on the tiny pools of influence that musicians enlarge via spontaneous melodies. Another of the strengths of ''Outcats'' is that it exposes readers to jazz artists who have not yet become well known.",1990-06-17T05:00:00+0000

Helmsley and his wife, Leona, ranges from $5 billion to $10 billion. So it seems perfectly logical that they'd want to save a few bucks on their taxes. To the Helmsleys, every dollar was as precious as a piece of prime midtown property; as Mrs. Helmsley was reported to have remarked to her housekeeper: ''We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.'' In 1989, Leona Helmsley and two employees, Joseph Licari and Frank Turco, were tried in Federal court for the evasion of in excess of $4 million in Federal and state income taxes, fraud, conspiracy and extortion. (Harry Helmsley was excused from prosecution because he was incapable of aiding in his own defense.) After several months of testimony, Mrs. Helmsley was found guilty on 33 counts of tax evasion, conspiracy, filing false tax returns and mail fraud. Along the way, the public was treated to a view of Leona Helmsley that showed her to be petty, self-absorbed and mean-spirited. This was a woman, writes Richard Hammer in ''The Helmsleys,'' who, upon hearing of the death of her son, turned to an assistant and screamed, ''Don't let them print how old he was.'' Even her own attorney admitted, ''There's no doubt about it, Mrs. Helmsley was a very tough person to do business with, and people went to any lengths to avoid dealing with her.'' Richard Hammer, whose previous books include ''The CBS Murders'' and ''The Last Testament of Lucky Luciano,'' will never be accused of being an accomplished prose stylist: many of his sentences are unwieldy and convoluted. Still, he has done a thorough job of research and is able to put forth his case in a straightforward manner, easily understood even by those of us to whom finance is a foreign language. But if you're looking for revelations here, you won't find much you couldn't have read in the daily newspapers. And for most of us, that was more than enough.",1990-06-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"  WHAT WENT WRONG, WHAT TO DO","PERIL AND PROMISE: A Commentary on America. By John Chancellor. (Harper & Row, $17.95.) As John Chancellor, the television commentator, looks at the United States, he sees a country facing a complex and competitive world with great power but failing confidence. This loss of faith results, he writes, from ''years of hopes raised and hopes dashed'' - defeat in the ''moral blunder'' of Vietnam, the Arab oil embargo, Watergate, the hostage crisis, inflation and the ''wanton mismanagement of the nation's finances.'' The result of this moral, political and financial battering, he writes, was the Reaganism of the 1980's and its greed, its emphasis on short-term profits, its falling savings and rising debt, and the feeling that we will be even worse off in the future. But this country is still No. 1, he writes. It can remain No. 1, and there is no reason why it shouldn't be. Mr. Chancellor offers several remedies, like all-year schooling, compulsory national service, Congressional campaign reform, a Government ''technology policy'' to aid research and development, a means test for Social Security. None are new; even his most startling idea, the abolition of Presidential primaries and the return of the nominating process to the convention floor, has been proposed before. But they are interesting ideas, and it is disappointing that Mr. Chancellor did not devote more time to them. People who have been paying attention to current events may find little to engage them. But the book seems to be aimed at the people who aren't paying attention. It is written in such simple language and assumes so little knowledge on the part of the reader that some may find it off-putting. On the other hand, if it's true that 24 million Americans cannot find their own country on a map, many people need such a user-friendly book. If they can be induced to read it, they will find it valuable and interesting.",1990-06-17T05:00:00+0000

It could, but it won't be unless they have some zany, original twist on seating arrangements that require United Nations intervention, caterers who turn into extortionists and other staples of real life. It is no compliment to say that most families have a version of ''Betsy's Wedding'' on their own home videos. Written and directed by Alan Alda, this is a predictable sitcom of a movie that begins with Molly Ringwald announcing her engagement, goes through the standard squabbling between families, and ends at the wedding reception under a very leaky tent. Mr. Alda, who also stars as the father of the bride, includes every ordinary wedding horror and tosses in a few movie cliches, like a Mafia business partner whose presence leads to a shootout and car chase. None of this is handled with the energy and invention that turn familiar scenes into comic ones.",1990-06-22T05:00:00+0000

But a Hamilton County municipal judge sustained the indictment for displaying photographs of children ''in a state of nudity'' and deferred a ruling on charges involving homoerotic images.

Even before Mapplethorpe, Mr. Barrie doubled the membership of the center, which occupies a gallery above a Walgreen's store.

On the other hand, to follow the ''endless melody'' core of Wagner's vision required 17 hours of attention Monday through Thursday evenings. (Opportunities for cheating included baseball, ''Roseanne,'' ''Cheers'' and ''Doogie Howser, M.D.'') At the end of the week, PBS officials were delighted to report that the four-day cycle drew about 3 percent of the audience, more than they expected and only slightly less than the average rating for public television offerings during prime time the previous week.

''You've lost your wife,'' Reg Vickers tells the recently widowed Andrew Marsh, ''and worse yet, your idea.'' So Reg, a pedantic, stubborn old black man who's lost his son, invites Marsh to share their idea - the plan they had made to retrace the routes that Algie, Reg's father, had taken as an Indian fighter on the Western frontier with the all-black Ninth Cavalry. And Marsh, a wealthy, overly responsible loner who's estranged from his own son, surprises himself by going along on Reg's odyssey from California to Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota. A wacky single mother and her children, several recreational vehicles full of free spirits and Marsh's pregnant and confused daughter-in-law soon join their caravan. Reg gradually tells the group the story, at least as he knows it, of Algie's life, from educated black Englishman to American handyman, teacher and Congressional Medal of Honor winner - and there are lots of helpers along the way to ferret out new secrets. As the pilgrims relive the Battle of the Little Big Horn and see the site of the Wounded Knee massacre, the reality of the white man's past and present treatment of the black and red man rolls out too. By the time they're headed back to California, new frontiers of involvement have opened for a loosened-up Marsh; for Reg, there's a fuller understanding of his identity as a black man. Joanne Meschery, the author of a previous novel, ''In a High Place,'' is such a cracking good storyteller that it hardly seems to matter that more than one incident in ''A Gentleman's Guide to the Frontier'' strains credulity, or that the book is too chock-full of themes, characters and plots ever to jell.

The protagonist in Doris Schwerin's deeply felt memoir is an uppity gray feline named Miss Willow, a moody, highly opinionated creature with a distinctive voice and many roles. Like the pigeons in her earlier autobiographical work, ''Diary of a Pigeon Watcher,'' the cat is a mirror of the author's moods, an extension of her psyche, as well as an object of her projections. At times she acts as Ms. Schwerin's alter ego, the self-doubting inner voice who prods her as she works, posing vexing questions: why does she write? and for whom? At other times she serves as the author's muse, the source of her daydreams as well as her memories. For it is in the act of telling Willow's story that the author unearths her own: the saga of Willow's rape by a tomcat in a dank city cellar sparks long-buried memories of her elderly aunt's murder by the Boston Strangler. An almost fatal encounter between Willow and another tomcat spirals back into the writer's recollections of her own emotional collapse, as well as thoughts about a near-drowning one childhood summer and the premature death of her older sister. Yet happily Ms. Schwerin succeeds in making her cat more than a convenient narrative prop. Because the reader is privy to the emotional interdependence between master and pet, there is always a logic to their intertwined stories. And though there are times when the weaving of Willow's biography with her own seems gratingly self-indulgent, the honesty with which the author confronts such difficult subjects as aging, marital infidelity and death makes these lapses forgivable. Ms. Schwerin is an observant writer whose layered prose beautifully evokes the salient details of time and place. Indeed, some of the most transporting moments of her book are those in which she describes New York City in the 1950's, particularly the underground life of Greenwich Village, with its jazz clubs where Pete Johnson and Art Tatum held sway. If the contrapuntal character of this memoir is often reminiscent of music, it may be because Ms. Schwerin is also a composer.",1990-06-24T05:00:00+0000

The festival exists on income from ticket sales and corporate support and has managed to be financially stable, drawing a faithful local audience as well as theatergoers from London, which is less than 90 minutes away from this cathedral town.

us,  NOWHERE TO HIDE,"THE ART LOVER. By Carole Maso. (North Point, $18.95.) Dedicated to a friend of the author's who died of AIDS, Carole Maso's second novel reads like an anguished meditation on the insufficiency of art as a refuge from life. Fragmented and hesitant, as if unsure of its powers, ''The Art Lover'' eventually centers on a character named Caroline, herself a writer, whose novel-in-progress turns out to have peopled the opening pages of the book we are reading. Like Carole Maso, Caroline has a friend who dies of AIDS. Her recently deceased father, Max, an eminent critic, taught her that art is all that matters; instinct tells her to agree, yet she worries that her mother's suicide may have been encouraged in some way by Max's esthetic distancing. Faced with the awful reality of her friend Steven's terminal illness, Caroline begins to feel that retreating into art may in fact be nothing but an exquisite form of betrayal. (Toward the end of the book, as if repenting her own fictive nature, Caroline actually dissolves for a time and is replaced by Carole Maso herself.) The novel's locus of pain, on many levels, is Greenwich Village; the restoring oasis is an artists' colony in Cummington, Mass., where shattered characters measure emotional losses against the recurring patterns of art, religion and nature. The narration moves brokenly from speaker to speaker, sketching thoughts, dreams, memories. Newspaper clippings on various topics - star maps, artists' lives - are patched in throughout, often as ironic counterpoint. When the story draws to an end, characters from different imaginative levels seem to be melting into one another. Yet none of this is jarring. On the contrary, though it takes the incoherence of grief as a compositional principle, ''The Art Lover'' in its realization is fully coherent, moving and elegiac, a genuine consolation.",1990-06-24T05:00:00+0000

It requires that the writer have a well-wrought sense of irony and an intelligence that strikes but isn't cruel. If this kind of writing pleases you, try spending some time with ''Paper Products,'' James W. Hall's first collection of short stories. Mr. Hall, who has four books of poetry and two novels to his credit, seems to have had his satirical blade honed on Eudora Welty's wheel, with perhaps a turn or two from Walt Kelly. His territory is mainly the South; his characters live in places like Sinking Fork, Ky., and they are often very funny. One of the most amusing stories is ''The Miracles,'' the tale of a man who comes to a small Kentucky town and promises to make the football team a winner by teaching the girls a kind of Zen cheerleading. But Mr. Hall's writing can be dark as well. In the title story, for example, a plumber from a small town in Tennessee drifts down to Mexico, marries an American woman and returns to her home in Florida to live, only to put his profession to a most macabre use. Occasionally Mr. Hall's characters can seem too country cute, a trait that cloys. But most of the time he has everything firmly under control. With satire, that's a must.",1990-06-24T05:00:00+0000

us,  A FAMILY INSTITUTION,"MENNINGER: The Family and the Clinic. By Lawrence J. Friedman. (Knopf, $29.95.) In 1919, Karl Menninger joined his father's medical practice, changing its emphasis to his own specialty, neuropsychiatry. By 1973, the Menninger Foundation, with a budget of nearly $15 million, employed 900 people in 39 buildings across two campuses. It became in the process ''one of the most significant and innovative psychiatric institutions in America,'' writes Lawrence J. Friedman, but then sacrificed some of its creative pre-eminence by transforming itself into a bureaucracy. A professor of history and American studies at Bowling Green State University, Mr. Friedman provides in ''Menninger: The Family and the Clinic'' a comprehensive biography of American psychiatry's first family. Readers receive a psychological analysis of the family's intricate - some might say compulsive - ties to its work. The author benefited from nearly unlimited access to family members, employees and colleagues, along with the family's personal and professional papers. In most instances, he shapes the voluminous data well. Mr. Friedman convincingly argues that Karl Menninger, the innovative, volatile older brother, and Will, his gentle, charming sibling, struggled with one another for control of the institution throughout their lifetimes. Students of the field will be fascinated with descriptions of the Menningers' techniques, from Will's highly structured, Freudian-based milieu therapy to the foundation's novel, contemporary programs in child psychiatry and other disciplines. With its clear if unstylish prose, the book is obviously designed for readers with a keen interest in psychology. Even they may occasionally tire of the excessive space devoted to short-term employees. Still, ''Menninger: The Family and the Clinic'' is a thorough, accomplished addition to the history of American mental health treatment.",1990-06-24T05:00:00+0000

The posters were commissioned by London Transport (then the Underground Group) starting in 1908, with displays of as many as 40 posters a year. More than 200 are beautifully reproduced in ART FOR THE LONDON UNDERGROUND: London Transport Posters, 1908 to the Present (Rizzoli, Paper, $29.95), by Oliver Green, who was the first curator of the London Transport Museum. From the beginning, the standard of poster design was extremely high. The copywriters borrowed liberally from literature - a 1909 poster promoting the train as a refuge from the English climate had as its slogan ''Winter's Discontent Made Glorious.'' A poster from World War I reads, ''Why Bother About the Germans Invading the Country? Invade It Yourself by Underground and Motor-'Bus.'' This sentiment was not repeated during World War II, when fewer and smaller posters were issued because of a paper shortage and because unnecessary travel was discouraged, and publicity posters were largely discontinued. Instead a set of pictorial posters entitled ''They Also Serve'' commemorated the efforts of the Underground staff who kept the system running under difficult wartime conditions. Present-day posters emphasize contemporary art and young artists, and are continuing to turn every Underground station and bus shelter into a venue for constantly changing exhibitions of modern art - free.",1990-06-24T05:00:00+0000
