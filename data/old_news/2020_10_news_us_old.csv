Referred to by the British, straightforwardly, as table football, and by the French, adorably, as le baby-foot (the term foosball comes from the German word for soccer), it was, by some accounts, created in the 1930s by a French automobile engineer, Lucien Rosengart. The Spanish anarchist and publisher Alejandro Finisterre also claimed to have invented futboln while recovering from injuries sustained in the Spanish Civil War, and the Englishman Harold Searles Thornton filed a patent for a similar setup in 1923. The French fashion and leather goods company Louis Vuitton, however, is less concerned with establishing the republics title to le baby-foot than in designing the most aesthetically pleasing version imaginable.

Perettis career grew out of her chance travels as a model in the late 60s and early 70s, when she was a muse to Helmut Newton and Halston. After stumbling upon a very tiny flower vase made of sterling silver at a flea market, which she wanted to wear as a necklace, she began sketching ideas with a silversmith in Spain. Her early creations were instinctive and macabre, inspired by animal skulls, scorpions and even X-rays of her own skeleton. In 1974, she joined Tiffany & Co. as a designer, where her sinuous and sculptural pieces  such as the Bean, Diamonds by the Yard and the Open Heart  quickly became signatures of the 1837-founded American jewelry house. That same year, Peretti traveled throughout Jaipur, India, and the citys glittering light inspired her to begin working with mesh. Halston debuted a gold mesh bra and scarf designed by Peretti for Tiffany in his fall 1975 runway collection, which she produced on old machinery that had been used to make handbags in fine metal netting and chain mail in the early 20th century. The mesh designs were a hit: Tiffany was swamped with calls from people dying to get a gold bra, Peretti recalled.",2020-10-02T15:00:08+0000

Sick and tired of working in kitchens, unseen and uncelebrated, stalling out while the people around him came up. In 1940, working in obscurity as a caterer, he lifted a recipe from his colleagues Irma Rhode and her brother Bill Rhode  known as New Yorks king of hors doeuvres  and published it as his own. It was a cute cocktail sandwich of soft, buttery bread and finely sliced onion called brioche en surprise, a hit at the events he and the Rhodes had worked together. But as Beard became more famous, the sandwich got a new, unofficial name: James Beards onion sandwich. Beard earned (along with a reputation for chronic, unapologetic plagiarism) his own nickname, the Dean of American Cookery. It was a good nickname, a strong nickname, though in suggesting a kind of elite prep school tucked away from the real world, it also gave away some truths about the small circle of people defining American food: They were insular, petty and competitive. And if Beard was their dean  a champion of American regional ingredients and the cooks who supported them  he was also a fragile and sometimes predatory influencer, an outsider aching for companionship and financial success.",2020-10-14T09:00:03+0000

us,The 25 Most Influential Works of American Protest Art Since World War II,"On a recent afternoon, the artists Dread Scott, Catherine Opie and Shirin Neshat, as well as T contributor Nikil Saval and Whitney Museum of American Art assistant curator Rujeko Hockley, joined me on Zoom for a conversation about protest art. I had asked each to nominate five to seven works of what they considered the most powerful or influential American protest art (that is, by an American artist or by an artist who has lived or exhibited their work in America) made anytime after World War II. We focused specifically on visual art  not songs or books  and the hope was that together, we would assemble a list of the top 25. But the question of what, precisely, constitutes protest art is a thorny one  and we kept tripping over it. Is it a slogan? A poster? Does it matter if it was in a museum, in a newspaper or out on the street? Does impact matter? Did it change what you think or believe? Must it endure? What does that mean? And what is the difference, anyway, between protest art and art that is merely political?",2020-10-15T09:00:53+0000

Why does the project propose this? In part because, as its essays show, the system of slavery and oppression that began on this date has led to so many of the problems that define our past and our present; in part because, as Hannah-Jones argues, the struggle against this system of oppression has been a pivotal freedom movement unfolding across many generations to advance progress for American society as a whole; and in part to advance the case that, as the heroes of both of these stories, Black Americans, whose presence in the English colonies that would become the United States began on this date, should occupy a central role in American history.",2020-10-16T18:16:35+0000

us,How to Create Your Own Herbal Tea Garden,"The tea garden  a typically modest plot dedicated to the growing of herbs and flowers for steeping  has its roots in ancient herbalist traditions and helped lay the foundation for modern botany. According to The Gardeners Companion to Medicinal Plants, a 2016 guide to home remedies, the study of herbal medicine can be traced back 5,000 years, to the Sumerians of southern Mesopotamia, who listed the names of hundreds of plants  including fennel, mint, thyme, sage, myrtle and marjoram  on clay tablets that were later rediscovered in what is now Iraq. Modern scholars believe that the Sumerians used what they grew in medicinal preparations such as tea infusions that were intended to treat ailments from toothache to inflammation. And in England, says Timothy dOffay, a tea importer and the founder of Postcard Teas in London, tea gardens have their origins in the work of 17th-century apothecaries such as Nicholas Culpeper, a botanist and physician whose encyclopedia of herbs, The English Physician, has remained in print since it was first published in 1653. The apothecaries focus was on the use of herbs in healing, explains dOffay. It was really the beginnings of modern medicine.

us,Were Living in a World of Walls. Here Is a Window to Escape.,"A long time ago, I read of a torture technique that a journalist heard was used by Hamas on residents of Gaza suspected of being informants: The person is shown a wall onto which a staircase is drawn, and at the top is a drawing of a bicycle. The person is told to go up and get the bicycle. But its only a drawing, he says. He is told that if he doesnt bring the bicycle down the stairs, he will be beaten. And when, again, he appeals to his torturers reason, to the reality in which both the staircase and the bicycle are drawings, he is hit. At this moment he understands that he has been left alone in a reality he believed was shared. He has been abandoned there, while the others have departed to a new reality in which a person can be tortured for being unable to do what is asked because it is physically impossible. In that same article, there was, as I recall, a photograph of the concrete blocks of the Israel/Palestine wall, on which someone had scrawled CTL+ALT+DLT.",2020-10-23T23:01:30+0000

From a handful of single-subject books I still treasure, I spent hours learning about the regional differences in pasta sauces and the individual histories of dozens, if not hundreds, of pasta shapes I hoped to one day taste.
