The study was released ahead of arguments, set for next week, before the Supreme Court in a case that could produce new restrictions on considering race in public college admissions.

us,Good Enough to Eat,"In the last decade or so, Dutch designers became famous for their bold reimaginings and remixings of traditional porcelain decoration. This year, the Amsterdam-based husband-and-wife team of Stefan Scholten and Carole Baijings took that much-copied idea in a more abstract  and strikingly beautiful  direction. Scholten and Baijingss Colour Porcelain dinnerware collection was commissioned by 1616/Arita Japan, a new brand named for the town on the Southern Japanese island of Kyushu that has produced hand-painted porcelain from a stone-based grayish-white clay since the 17th century. Under the creative direction of the up-and-coming young designer Teruhiro Yanagihara, 1616/Arita is putting a contemporary spin on that history. Scholten and Baijings looked at traditional Arita porcelain decoration, deconstructing it into a palette that was surprisingly like their own, which favors tones like aquarelle blue, red-orange and yellow. But instead of applying color just for, say, flowers or figures, they colored entire plates. The way we used it, said Baijings of the palette, it became a lot of color. Its us, but its also Japanese. The collection is based on three degrees of complexity: the monochromatic Minimal; Colourful, with two or three colors; and Extraordinary, with applied grids, lines and layered colors.

For John Derian, whose decoupaged plates, lamps and paperweights evoke the past in a way thats anything but nostalgic, renovating a former artists studio in the East Village for his new home meant leaving its uneven floors, cloudy windows and imperfect moldings intact, in an effort to preserve the patina of the 19th-century space. For Lynn Yaegers story, T followed the project over six months, photographing the renovation from start to finish. While Derian made significant changes to the interior, the envelope itself looked as if it had hardly been touched. Some might recoil at the apparent decrepitude of the space, but in Derians eyes  and ours  he was preserving its tattered poetry, allowing the ghosts of history a place at his often crowded dinner table. In a similar vein, the multilayered arrangements in the artist Nick Caves Chicago loft, as described by Linda Yablonsky, create a portrait of the artist as a human being who is emotionally connected to those who, like himself, live to make things.",2012-10-05T20:30:13+0000

All signatures are secured by Pruitt himself who, in the role of consummate fan, always caries a Sharpie and blank unstretched canvas with him just in case. The odd mix of subjects here  from a before-she-was-famous Lena Dunham to artist friends like Piotr Uklanski, Darren Bader and Elizabeth Peyton  reminds the viewer that context can be content while echoing Peytons painting practice of elevating her personal heroes to equal footing as the cultural centennials she deems worthy of our adoration.

This rapid rise was mostly attributed to her shimmering prose. (One Italian critic compared it to Oriental porcelain.) But Di Grado also stood out for her strange personal style. She wears black lipstick, a sorceress hood and fingerless lace gloves. Recently, she said, she strung naked baby dolls into a necklace. Everyone is kind of suspicious, she said in a telephone interview from Rome. But Ive always dressed like this. In Sicily, where I grew up, I was constantly insulted for it. But that only made me want to do it more. Di Grados writing is similarly defiant. Her novel  available next month in an English translation by Michael Reynolds  is set in Leeds, England, a purulent freckle of a city where the sky is the color of a raw chicken thigh. The heroine, the 20-year-old Camelia, is losing her mind. She has her reasons: Camelias father was killed in a car accident, and her musician mother has turned into a helpless, self-destructive mute. Mother and daughter communicate only through an invented language of glances, one of several linguistic quirks in this novel: others have to do with Chinese ideograms and a sickening affliction called verbal anorexia. While she briefly finds comfort in friendship, or in sex, Camelia is eventually consumed by her madness, and Di Grado seems to mock the reader for imagining a happier ending. Use it to mop the bathroom, that story of yours, or I dont know, to line the hamsters cage, she writes. Your comfort does not interest her. If someone reads the book before bed and then can fall asleep, I think I failed, Di Grado explains. Literature has to make you stop sleeping. ",2012-10-12T15:00:05+0000

Peele was keeping the machine in shape for its owners, a wealthy family that hired him eight months earlier to manage their estate in Los Angeles, as well as this beach house in Malibu. Every two weeks, far more often than his employers, Peele makes the 45-minute drive to the beachfront home. Once there, he runs every faucet for 15 minutes, flushes every toilet and lights every fireplace, so that the house comes maniacally alive; he checks the coffee maker, toaster, televisions and the laptop, inspects the exterior paint job, eyeballs the pipes, advises the landscapers on how to brighten the floral mix, consults with whatever workman is on the job and finally, shortly before leaving, he hits the StairMaster.",2012-10-12T15:11:51+0000

The round house itself stands on reservation land, where tribal courts are in charge, but the suspect is white, and tribal courts cant prosecute non-Native people. Federal law would also seem to apply, but the rape may have taken place on a strip of land that is part of a state park, where North Dakotas authority is in force, or on another that was sold by the tribe and is thus considered fee land, administered under a separate tangle of statutes.",2012-10-12T15:12:09+0000

Theyre shooting only 38 percent from the field, including a woeful 21 percent from 3-point range. While some of this can be attributed to standard preseason sloppiness, its becoming clear - particularly in a much-improved Eastern Conference - that the prolonged recovery of Rose, the teams All-Star point guard, could spell trouble for Chicagos overall success, even more so than did his more sporadic absences a season ago.

us,South Korea: Professor Acquitted in Obscenity Case," A law professor indicted on charges that he posted a series of photographs showing a mans genitals on his Internet blog was acquitted on Thursday. The professor, Park Kyung-sin of Korea University, was charged in February with violating the countrys online obscenity law. At the time, he was a commissioner of the Korea Communications Standards Commission, a government agency with an authority to delete Internet content it considered harmful. When the commission found the photos on a blog last year and discussed whether to remove them, Mr. Park, who was appointed by opposition lawmakers, suggested that they be allowed to stay on the blog, but perhaps with a warning rating. When the other commissioners, most of whom were appointed by President Lee Myung-bak and his governing party, overruled him and deleted the photos without giving their owner a chance to defend himself, Mr. Park posted the photos on his own blog, Censors Diary, and invited a debate of the commissions decision. In the first court ruling in July, he was fined $2,700 for violating the obscenity law. But an appeals court on Thursday reversed the ruling, acquitting Mr. Park. The court said Mr. Parks posting could not be ruled indecent because the photos should be viewed in the context of his attempt to criticize the governments regulations on online content.

You did nothing to address inequality by giving yourself the right to spoil the enjoyment of others, she said.

The B strains are rarer and usually arrive later in the season than the A strains, like A(H1N1), but they cause more hospitalizations and deaths. Until 1978, flu vaccines contained only one A and one B strain; a second A was added to fight A(H3N2), which had first emerged as the 1968 Hong Kong Flu. Two distinct B strains, known as Victoria and Yamagata, have existed since 2002, but it has been hard to predict a dominant one each year. The new quadrivalent vaccines, which are being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration and are not approved for the public, are meant to lower that uncertainty. ",2012-10-23T00:20:37+0000

Muslims are killing Muslims across the Middle East and Central Asia today: Sunnis versus Shiites, Pashtuns versus Pashtuns and Kurds versus Turks. Christians are not faring well there, either. The absence of pluralism and the prevalence of rule or die politics  either my sect or party is in power or Im dead  is the dominant political trend in the Arab-Muslim region today. Nobody trusts anybody, but it is impossible to build a modern state or an innovation economy without trust. Meanwhile, here in America, we are debating whether to replace our first black president  whose middle name is Hussein and whose grandfather was a Muslim  with a Mormon! Who does that? Nobody else.

The space was abandoned for the last 20 years, says the artist Fernanda Brenner, who founded Piv with a small team that includes the art historian Marta Ramos  and the producer Tyaga Sa Brito. The labyrinthine layout, pieced together from a former storage space, a dental clinic and a storefront, may have made the location a hard sell, but at 38,000 square feet, it is an interesting place to display artwork. For the first round of shows, Piv enlisted two local galleries and an independent curator to present projects that largely respond to or intervene with the architecture of the site.

Named after the blues singer Koko Taylor, it is one of the brands three new womens styles.

The Dallas Morning News reported that the mediator, Tom Luce, resigned via an e-mail to Richard Tettamant, the administrator of the Dallas Police and Fire Pension System, the towers owner. Recent events have made clear that the conditions and spirit under which I agreed to serve to help find a mutually beneficial solution for all parties are not being adhered to by you, Mr. Luce wrote. This saddens me, because I believe this is such an important issue for our city as a whole together with the financial future for our wonderful police and fireman.

Both men seek to escape the horrors of their wars, and both, in their egotism and maniacal drive, ignore the desires, needs and safety of the families they bring with them. But the star of the book is the island itself, San Miguel, in all its glorious barrenness, its guano-coated cliffs and its pounding waves that cough up remnants of the frequent shipwrecks around the rocky shore. (A coffin shows up and is converted into a couch, then later is restored to its original purpose.)

Its English translation did not do as well as other recent European blockbusters, which surely explains why Falettis sixth novel, A Pimps Notes, is the first since I Kill to be available in the American market.

I learned this trick a few years ago. High-quality chain hotels in Manhattan can offer rock-bottom rates for Sunday nights because thats the night theyre most likely to have lots of unsold rooms. Think about it: business travelers stay Monday to Friday and weekend tourists stay Friday to Sunday, which leaves available inventory for Sunday nights. Last January I stayed at the Radisson Martinique at Herald Square for $119 on a Sunday night; two months before, I stayed in an identical room there for $379 on a weeknight. In June, my family and I stayed at a brand new, immaculate DoubleTree Suites property on 29th Street near Seventh Avenue on a Sunday evening and paid $107 (the rate was $119 with a further $12 reduction with my AAA or AARP card).

Not that excess Picassos and Pollocks will be flying out the door  sorry!  but a hoard of other stuff will. From Nov. 17 to Nov. 30, the artist Martha Rosler will stock (and restock) the museums atrium with 12,000 donated objects, including neck chains, hankies and underwear, that she has gathered for her Meta-Monumental Garage Sale, possibly the largest ever  at least in an art space. (The image above is from a similar sale in London in 2005.) Rosler is widely known for her seminal Vietnam War-era collages, House Beautiful: Bringing the War Home (1967-72), which are on view elsewhere in the museum, and her sale doubles as a demonstration of the way society values received goods and ideas, and as a commentary on desire for ownership. Thats why she wont reveal which six charities will receive the proceeds, only that she doesnt plan to give MoMA  the Kremlin of the value of art  a single dime. I dont want people walking in there with a sense of virtue, she says. Haggling, on the other hand, is welcome, and a hired wedding photographer will document the transactions, streamed live, Marina Abramovic style, on moma.org/garagesale under Martha Rosler Made Me Buy. Maybe the garage sale is a metaphor for the mind, Rosler says. I find it very stressful. ",2012-10-26T21:00:52+0000

Ms. Arianda, an unknown before this role, ended up winning a Tony Award for it, beating out even Tracie Bennetts praised-to-the-rafters portrayal of a late-career Judy Garland in End of the Rainbow. So a nagging concern sat there. Was it the actress, and not the play, that impressed us so much? Hartford TheaterWorks frisky new production clears things up. Venus in Fur is an entertaining, worthwhile play on its own. Without Ms. Arianda  who in her 20s is being compared to Meryl Streep  it is not quite as intoxicating or as magical. But with the deceptively button-cute Liv Rooth, who was Ms. Ariandas Broadway understudy in both this play and Born Yesterday, it is perhaps a bit sharper and clearer.

The evening continues with Games (1967), at 10, starring Signoret as an aging cosmetics saleswoman and amateur medium who joins two Manhattan socialites (James Caan and Katharine Ross) in a series of novel pastimes, this one involving the seduction of an adolescent delivery boy (Don Stroud).

That came on the heels of the Tea Party-backed Republican Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois saying after a recent debate that he opposed abortion even in cases where the life of the mother is in danger, because with modern technology and science, you cant find one instance in which a woman would not survive without an abortion. Health of the mother has become a tool for abortions anytime, for any reason, Walsh said.

This fall, Brittain will introduce two new faceted fixtures, and a pyrite-inspired pendant that she designed for the rapid-prototyping company .MGX will make its debut next spring at the Milan design fair. Still, she is not quite ready to settle into the title of lighting designer.
