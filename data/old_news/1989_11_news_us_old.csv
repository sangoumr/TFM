The general, Jubal Early, called the payment a contribution, but his subsequent burning down of Chambersburg, Pa., proved extortion was a more accurate term. Frederick officials borrowed the money from five local banks, which financed the loan with bond issues, the last payment being made on Oct. 1, 1951. Senator Charles McC. Mathias of Maryland estimated that the $200,000-plus interest compounded annually since 1864 at 4 percent amounted to almost $14 million, but he never succeeded in persuading Congress that the Government was obligated to reimburse Frederick ''for value received by the Union.''",1989-11-05T05:00:00+0000

Passengers would board or disembark at their option in Montauk, making the rest of the journey by rail. A seven-story office building was erected for this purpose.

The very name of Sterba with its morbid, Germanic overtones, became oppressive to many music appreciators who had learned all they knew about Beethoven from pious program notes and standard iconographies that often were no more than reverential rewrites of Thayer's 19th-century documentary classic.",1989-11-05T05:00:00+0000

Can a nice guy named Lloyd (John Cusack), who has no plans for college, win the love of the beautiful ice princess (Ione Skye), who happens to be class valedictorian, over the objections of her father (John Mahoney)? The romantic comedy was written and directed by Cameron Crowe, who also wrote ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High.'' The film's predictable surface is ''constantly being cracked by characters who think and talk like real people.'' Basically, it's ''all charming performances and grace notes, but there are plenty of worse things to be.'' (Caryn James) Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills 1989. Virgin. $89.95. LD. $39.95. 1:43. CC. R. Newly widowed Clare (Jacqueline Bisset) is simultaneously planning her husband's funeral and her own return to TV. Her house servant (Ray Sharkey) makes a bet with her neighbor's (Robert Beltran) on which of them can seduce the other's boss first. The plot is based on the clear and cynical assumption that the underclass is almost as greedy, callous and silly as the overclass. Paul Bartel's mordant satire ''is one long smile with an occasional belly laugh . . . full of funny lines that are delivered with a pleased self-consciousness that defuses the rudeness.'' (Vincent Canby) Scrooged 1988. Paramount. No list price. LD, $24.95. 1:41. CC. PG-13. As Frank Cross, the ratings-mad program chief of the IBC television network, ''Bill Murray's contemporary Scrooge is a joy as long as he's making life miserable for everyone around him. When, finally, Frank sees the error of his ways, the movie succumbs to its heart of jelly.'' This updated version of ''A Christmas Carol'' works in fits and starts. The mundane demands of the sentimental story keep interrupting what are, essentially, revue sketches, a few of which are hilarious. (Canby) The Navigator 1988. Trylon. $89.95. 1:32. PG. In his dark, thrilling fantasy, the New Zealand film maker Vincent Ward tells the story of a group of 14th-century English villagers who are threatened with the Black Death and travel through time to a New Zealand city in 1988 to find a cure. ''The director takes every artistic risk his bizarre premise allows. . . . Despite his artistic ambition, Mr. Ward always opts for adventure over social comment.'' (James) Dead Calm 1989. Warner. $89.95. LD, $24.98. 1:36. CC. R. In this watery adventure tale, the Australian director Phillip Noyce offers ''an unsettling hybrid of escapist suspense and . . . pure trash.'' John and Rae Ingram (Sam Neill and Nicole Kidman), a husband and wife alone on their yacht in still waters, are joined by a classic intruder, the mysterious stranger (Billy Zane), who doesn't arrive nearly soon enough. The film rises above its shoddy beginning but often sinks back and ultimately becomes disturbing for all the wrong reasons. (James) Miss Firecracker 1989. HBO. $89.99. 1:42. CC. PG. In this film, based on an Off Broadway play by Beth Henley, Holly Hunter plays Carnelle, a young woman who, as part of a campaign to change her image as the tramp of Yazoo City, Miss., enters the Fourth of July Miss Firecracker beauty pageant. It's a ''superficial and sporadically witty piece aimed at such easy targets as family squabbles, small-town folk and beauty contests.

Its circulation dwindled to one-third of its peak and it was hemorrhaging $18 million a year - common ailments among afternoon papers.

Ransdell Pierson depicts Leona Helmsley as a cross between Marie Antoinette and the Wicked Witch. He chronicles her career from receptionist to billionaire hotel queen to 69-year-old convicted felon. From his account, her favorite pastimes are terrorizing her employees and abusing the power of her husband, Harry, the real estate tycoon. Born Leona Mindy Rosenthal in Brooklyn in 1920, Mrs. Helmsley married and divorced twice, although her second marriage was omitted from her subsequent resumes. Also hidden, according to the author, was her insatiable desire for free merchandise from hotel suppliers and her campaign to supplant the long-time first Mrs. Helmsley (which she did in 1972). Mr. Pierson, a reporter for The New York Post, quotes extensively from relatives, ex-husbands, colleagues, friends, ex-friends, managers, drivers, butlers, maitres d'hotel, waiters, housekeepers and advertising agency staffers. Many of these people were fired by Mrs. Helmsley and seem happy to recount the corruption that led to her conviction on 33 felony counts, including conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and evading $1.2 million in taxes.

The softcover book, with more than 75 pictures and drawings of structures in the neighborhood, was written by the architectural historian Andrew Scott Dolkart. It gives details of buildings that illustrate the history - indeed, the romance - of the irregularly shaped area south of Canal Street between Broadway and the Hudson River and north of the Financial District. Copies of the book, which took two years to produce at a cost of about $50,000, may be bought for $12.50 from the TriBeCa Community Association, 42 Hudson Street, New York, N.Y. 10013. The association is one of the leaders of a coalition of groups seeking to have much of the area formally landmarked to preserve the stock of old buildings that still remain there, many of them 100 to 150 years old.

The car was stolen six days later in Miami. Not only did Dollar refuse to provide me with another car, but they also informed me that I would be liable for the price of the car - even though I had paid extra for the collision damage waiver. The CDW only covers an automobile accident - there is no theft insurance, they said. After investigating other car rental liability policies, I have concluded that Dollar is the only major chain that does not offer theft liability. BRETT M. LEWIS New York, N.Y. Editor's note: The car that Mr. Lewis rented was found a few days after it was reported missing. Mr. Lewis said that he was charged for the period that the car was missing and that he had to pay for renting another car for one day from another agency. Mr. Lewis said he wrote to Dollar headquarters in Los Angeles and to the Orlando and Miami offices of Dollar. Asked about Mr. Lewis's letter, Bob Jacobson, the public relations director in Los Angeles, said that the matter had to be settled in Florida since the operation there was a franchise. He declined to comment about Dollar's policy regarding theft at any location. In late October, Mr. Lewis said, he was advised by Sundance Carriage Corporation of Tampa, the Florida licensee, that his credit card was being credited for the extra rental days and the extra one-day car rental.",1989-11-05T05:00:00+0000

As its director and its historian, your authors have an obvious stake in Dr. Pons's and Dr. Fleishmann's being exactly wrong about their fusion-in-a-bottle experiments. The ''mixture of excitement and skepticism'' with which they say they followed the story no doubt stemmed, in part, from anxiety over new and possibly powerful competition.

us,THE WORLD'S WARS,"This is a coffeetable volume of 75 war photographs, and since they depict the conflicts of the 1980's they are all in color; the mangled flesh is red and the flames are orange. These are strong, evocative pictures reminding us that a guerrilla's vengeful rage or a child's poignant grief are just as affecting in little wars - Nicaragua, Northern Ireland, Lebanon and the like - as they were in earlier wars that slew millions. To an older generation of combat photographers, DEEDS OF WAR (Thames and Hudson, $35), a collection of work by the magazine photographer James Nachtwey, is a startling reminder of the technical progress that has been made in photography. Newspaper and magazine readers viewed the mayhem in the Somme trenches, the Tarawa landings, the Pusan perimeter and even the fall of Saigon mostly in black and white, for a simple reason: To catch the fleeting vignettes of war often requires high-speed film as well as fast reflexes, and color film used to be too slow for much of the lightning action of battle. But no longer. Among the eye-catchers in Mr. Nachtwey's book is a picture of a Northern Irish partisan hurling a gasoline bomb at an armored British tow truck as it attempts to move a burning car. Everything in this remarkable picture - vehicles, fires, projectile and man - is in violent motion, and yet the details are almost as crisp as one might expect in a static landscape photographed at leisure. There are some who prefer war in black and white. Perhaps Robert Capa's celebrated 1937 snapshot of a falling Spanish Loyalist soldier at the instant of death would not have been as memorable if its hues and tints had been spelled out in true color.

Three years ago, Ms. Midler accused Young & Rubicam Inc. of perpetrating a ''ripoff'' when the advertising agency used as background music for a Ford Motor Company commercial a recording of ''Do You Wanna Dance'' that sounded mighty like Ms. Midler's well-known 1971 version of the song. The singer sued. Along the way, Ford was dropped as a defendant in the case, but last week the jury found that Young & Rubicam had ''appropriated what is not theirs'' in using an imitation of Ms. Midler's voice -they had actually hired one of the backup singers who worked with her on the original recording - and awarded the singer $400,000. The advertising industry, which has heretofore used ''sound-alike'' music with impunity, was in a tizzy. One entertainment lawyer predicted a flood of new lawsuits curtailing the use of ''sound-alikes.'' Young & Rubicam contended that the ruling would have a ''chilling'' effect on the creative process, but the company seemed relieved that the award had not been closer to the $10 million Ms. Midler originally sought. In a statement, the company called the decision ''unfortunate but bearable.''",1989-11-05T05:00:00+0000

A political polemic presented in the form of a novel is a tricky hybrid. To be persuasive while balancing the message with the medium is no mean feat. ''Ashes of Izalco,'' which was originally published in Spanish in 1966 and is now appearing in a workmanlike translation by Darwin J. Flakoll, accomplishes this with varying degrees of success. The story focuses on two central characters: Carmen Rojas, an upper-class Salvadoran who returns in the mid-1960's to her native village, Santa Ana, for her mother's funeral; and Frank Wolff, an emotionally bankrupt American alcoholic who comes to Santa Ana in 1931. The connection between them is revealed when Carmen reads an old diary and discovers that her mother, Isabel, had an affair with Frank. Carmen is the observer, seeing and commenting on everything: the smug, materialistic American, the frivolousness of the Salvadoran upper class and the inhuman abuse suffered by the exploited peasants. Frank, on the other hand, is the self-absorbed American who, while desperately trying to grasp happiness through Isabel, isn't even aware of the revolutionary turmoil that is taking place around him - until he witnesses the massacre of thousands of peasants in the town of Izalco. The story, whose violent climax is based on actual historical events, is rich with the sights and sounds of a Salvadoran village, with energetic, sometimes humorous insights into the lives and attitudes of the stratified population, even as the Salvadoran writer Claribel Alegria and her husband, Mr. Flakoll, make points, from their perspective, about the behavior and attitudes of North Americans in Latin America.

Fred Mustard Stewart's enjoyable tale of a San Francisco family features an interesting cast of characters, a lively sense of humor and an impressive ability to blend historical fact and popular fiction. Emma de Meyer, daughter of Frankfurt's leading jeweler, comes to America in 1849 after her mother is killed in an anti-Semitic riot. A love affair en route to California with a man wanted for bank robbery leaves her pregnant, but a marriage of convenience to a wealthy ship's captain turns into a love match and a good business arrangement as well. Emma's American descendants, the Collingwoods, become one of California's wealthiest families, and Mr. Stewart traces their fortunes through the 1906 earthquake to the present. Like many multigenerational sagas, ''The Glitter and the Gold'' sags somewhat as time marches on. None of her children and grandchildren are as appealing as the dashing Emma, and the final section, which involves a modern-day Collingwood's attempt to fend off sinister Hong Kong gangsters intent on acquiring the family ranch, falls decidedly flat. In addition, Mr. Stewart is a trifle cavalier with his characters; disasters befall the Collingwoods in such abundance that it eventually becomes rather funny - surely not what the author intended. These flaws are more than counterbalanced, however, by this entertaining novel's sheer vigor and charm.",1989-11-05T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE MAN WHO KNEW CARY GRANT, by Jonathan Schwartz. (Plume/New American Library, $8.95.) The son of a composer with a cast of famous friends finds that his only successful relationship is with his father. ''It is in his portrayal of the past as an abiding presence that Mr. Schwartz excels,'' Janet Kaye said here last year. This novel ''captures the ineffable sadness of lost time.'' WALDHEIM: The Missing Years, by Robert Edwin Herzstein. (Paragon House, $12.95.) After spending two years following a trail of documents from Washington to London, Belgrade and Vienna, a historian tries to close the gaps in the life of Kurt Waldheim, the former Nazi officer who rose through Austrian politics and became Secretary General of the United Nations. Last year our reviewer, Shirley Hazzard, said Robert Edwin Herzstein wasn't hard enough on Mr. Waldheim or his protectors. But she called the book ''a new threshold in the drama, for its volume of pertinent facts and for the portrait of Kurt Waldheim. . . . The reader emerges incredulous that any man could deny such experience.'' MIDNIGHT SWEETS, by Bette Pesetsky. (Ivy, $3.95.) Working in the ephemeral medium of cookie dough, Theodora elevates baking to an art and establishes an empire. ''If it's possible to create a novel whose structure is based on cookies, [ Bette Pesetsky has ] done it,'' David Leavitt said here last year. ''I'm only sorry there aren't recipes.'' FASTING GIRLS: The History of Anorexia Nervosa, by Joan Jacobs Brumberg. (Plume/New American Library, $9.95.) Anorexia is on the rise, the writer argues, because ''the cult of diet and exercise is the closest thing our secular society offers women in terms of a coherent philosophy of the self.'' Last year our reviewer, Eileen Simpson, called this study ''comprehensive and readable.'' THIS IS YOUR LIFE, by Meg Wolitzer. (Penguin, $7.95.) The two daughters of Dottie Engels, a fat stand-up comedian, know their mother mostly from her appearances on the television screen. ''Ms. Wolitzer knows how to draw characters who are trapped in childhood, who feel the pain and novelty that come with fresh experience,'' Kit Reed said here last year. ''Swift and accurate, bristling with detail, 'This Is Your Life' does not so much describe growing up as demonstrate what it's really like.'' AN EMPIRE OF THEIR OWN: How the Jews Invented Hollywood, by Neal Gabler. (Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95.) Spurned by East Coast high society, entrepreneurs like Adolph Zukor, L. B. Mayer, the Warner brothers and Harry Cohn established their own fantasy land in Southern California. Last year our reviewer, Molly Haskell, said Neal Gabler ''has a Balzacian zest for financial data, for how deals and fortunes are made and unravel, and a novelist's eye for the way success and failure are prefigured in character.'' A RECENT MARTYR, by Valerie Martin. (Vintage, $7.95.) In New Orleans an unhappily married woman named Emma becomes tangled up in a sadomasochistic threesome. ''This is a striking book, one with as much depth as the reader dares to plumb,'' Carolyn Banks said here last year. CHASING THE GLORY: Travels Across America, by Michael Parfit. (Collier/Macmillan, $8.95.) A journalist and pilot retraces Charles Lindbergh's flight around America to see how the landscape has changed. This book is ''an elegy for what has been lost and a celebration of what remains unspoiled in America - both in the land and in the people,'' John Byrne Cooke said here earlier this year. ''It is also a pleasure to read.'' PACO'S STORY, by Larry Heinemann. (Penguin, $7.95.) A veteran with nightmares of Vietnam moves to a small town in Texas to lose himself in the meditative repetitions of a simple, mindless job. In 1987 our reviewer, Christopher Benfey, said this ''carefully crafted, oblique narrative'' suggests that the horrors of war ''may be as forcefully conveyed by a haunting scene in a greasy spoon as by the tearing of human flesh.'' The novel won a National Book Award. THE FLOATPLANE NOTEBOOKS, by Clyde Edgerton. (Ballantine, $4.95.) The patriarch of a North Carolina family, who fancies himself an engineer, believes that according to the principle of ''natural suspension,'' even a family stricken by the tragedy of Vietnam can be uplifted. ''So perfect is the author's control that each voice, like an individual bell in a handbell choir, rings true,'' Barbara Kingsolver said in The Book Review last year. ''Mr. Edgerton's gift is for dialect that places its speaker squarely - not only on a geographical map, but a psychological one.'' THE QUESTION OF HU, by Jonathan D. Spence. (Vintage, $8.95.) In early 18th-century France, a curious visitor from China found that in the context of European culture his exuberant behavior qualified him for incarceration in an insane asylum. Jonathan D. Spence's ''delicate but nevertheless ambitious approach makes him one of the most original and exciting historians writing now,'' Angeline Goreau said in these pages in 1988. A SOCIAL HISTORY OF MADNESS: The World Through the Eyes of the Insane, by Roy Porter. (Dutton/Obelisk, $8.95.) In this collection of case studies, the history of the asylum is told from the point of view of the inmates. ''Often the eloquence and cogency of the testimonies are striking,'' Marina Warner said here last year. ''Pugnacious yet soft-spoken, the book gives us new ears to listen to the so-called ravings and gibberish of the mad.''",1989-11-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Question Box,"The Winning Pitcher Q. In Game 2 of the National League playoff last month, the Cubs led San Francisco, 6-2, in Chicago, when the Giants put two runners on base with two out in the fifth inning. With the dangerous Will Clark, a left-handed batter, coming up, Manager Don Zimmer removed his starter, Mike Bielecki, a right-hander, and replaced him with the left-handed Paul Assenmacher, who retired Clark to end the inning. But the switch deprived Bielecki of the victory, since he never pitched the required five innings for a starter. If Zimmer had instead moved Bielecki to the outfield, displacing the left fielder, for example, for one batter, then had returned him to the mound in the sixth inning and inserted a new outfielder, would Bielecki have been eligible for the victory after he retired one batter? A. Not as a starting pitcher, but certainly as a reliever if he had gone on to hold the Giants at bay the rest of the way, as Les Lancaster did for Chicago. Moving a starting pitcher to the outfield ends the pitcher's role as a starter, even if it's just for one batter. When he moves back to the mound, he's a relief pitcher, subject to the conditions of qualifying for the victory that apply to any relief pitcher. So Bielecki could not have got credit for the victory as a starter, even though he would have never left the lineup, because he was not used in the role of a starter for the first five innings. But he could have earned the victory in relief if the Cubs had remained ahead and the official scorer had determined that Bielecki was the most effective Chicago pitcher from the bullpen. More Rizzuto vs. Reese Q. An answer two weeks ago that compared Phil Rizzuto of the New York Yankees and Pee Wee Reese of the Brooklyn Dodgers during the six World Series they played against each other was confined to how they did as hitters. What about their fielding, which is often considered the real value of a shortstop to a team? A. Though Reese swung the bat better and more productively in their total Series matchup, when it came to gloves, Rizzuto had the upper hand, hands down. Over the 37 Series games they had in common from 1941 through 1955, Rizzuto wound up with more putouts (73 to 63), more assists (98 to 93) and fewer errors (3 to 8) than Reese. The Yankee shortstop also came out ahead in three other categories that involved neither hitting nor fielding the ball: stolen bases (7 to 6), walks (18 to 9) and winner's checks cashed (5 to 1). Blaik at Dartmouth Q. When Earl (Red) Blaik coached football at Dartmouth before coaching at West Point, how many Ivy League titles did his teams win? A. None, and for one perfectly good reason: there was no Ivy League title to win until 1956 and Blaik coached at Dartmouth from 1934 through 1940. By the time Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Penn, Cornell, Princeton, Brown and Dartmouth were formally formed into the Ivy League, Blaik was winding down his Hall of Fame career as Army coach.",1989-11-06T05:00:00+0000

Mr. President, the United States is returning $567 million in frozen assets to Iran but says the action is not related to the plight of the eight Americans held hostage in Lebanon. Nevertheless, in mind of your comment that good will brings good will, do you hope that this will encourage Iran to help win the hostages' release? Do you think that this could be a catalyst Mr. Rafsanjani -- A. I don't know. It's a very good question and I don't know the answer to that. They owe money, you know, they, we have accounts that where they owe American interests money and vice versa. And I'd like to get this underbrush cleaned out now. I think they, they have made some positive statements. . . . I hope that they will do what they can to influence those who hold these hostages. We're continuing behind the scenes to try to follow certain rabbit trails there and so far they've ended up a dead end. East Europe Initiatives Q. Despite your aid packages to Hungary and Poland and so forth, President Carter says you've really been slow on the uptake on one of the most transforming political events of our times. You have failed to show the leadership. You've failed to put the U.S. ahead of the curve on these things that are happening. And you are going to the summit without any initiatives at all. I mean this is boasted about. Why don't you have some new ideas of what to talk -- A. Now Helen, that is not a kinder and gentler way to phrase your question. We have done plenty. And the fact that some critics are out there equating progress with spending more money doesn't bother me in the least. Look at the dynamic changes that are taking place around the world. And - well, I'd like to hear some specific suggestions other than triple the spending on every initiative. We are working closely with our allies. We are trying to facilitate the change. I don't hear complaints coming out of our allies or indeed out of Hungary or Poland or Eastern Europe. We've got a seasoned team that are - that's evaluating the change. I will have a wonderful opportunity to discuss the change with Mr. Gorbachev. But I can't be all concerned when, when people jump up and say the answer is to spend more money. Accord on Budget Q. On the budget, there's some question as to whether when Congress finally, if it does, sends you the reconciliation - that is to say, the budget-cutting bill - what it will take for you to sign it. Are you prepared to go beyond the agreement that - that you have reached with the members of Congress or the leaders of Congress? Are you going to require a more stringent budget-cutting measures? Something equal, for example, to the sequester, the cuts that have already gone into effect in order to satisfy you and get you to sign it? A. If we get a clean reconciliation bill - and I'll know that when I see it - I'd be glad to sign such a bill. If it gets the kinds of real reductions that we want, I think the range was $14 billion. But if not, why we have to follow, follow the law. . . . But if they - if they don't send it down here in clean form, if it's all loaded up with a lot of special projects, I will not sign it. . . . Commitment to Quayle Q. Why did you commit to Dan Quayle so early for '92? You're thought to be such a cautious, prudent man. Why did you shut off your options so early? A. I thought that was a prudent and right thing to do. Q. Well, all right, are you saying Dan Quayle is your choice right now A. Well, I'm not saying I'm running. Q. Are you saying he's your choice right now but you leave your options for -- A. No, I said he's my choice. Period. Krenz Leadership Q. When Egon Krenz first came to power in East Germany, you said it was way too early to say whether he represented more of the same -which seemed to be your sense at the time - or whether he represented the leading edge of further reform. Seeing the dramatic events unfold in East Germany, what is your conclusion about Egon Krenz, his intentions and his direction? A. I think it's still too early to sum it up entirely, but some of what he has said about political reform is quite encouraging and really contradicts the very early - I would say global -assessment of the man. In other words, the early predictions were that he's a hard-liner, in the mode of Mr. Honecker. And now, some of what he is saying is quite different from that. And Mr. Honecker's not there anymore. So you're seeing some changes. . . . Change in East Europe Q. Mr. President, do you feel that things have now gone too far in East Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Soviet Union, for the clock to be turned back for a Tiananmen Square-type crackdown? And do you feel any need to assist the West Germans in all of this. A. Well, the West Germans have not requested assistance, and I am in very close touch with the Federal Chancellor. Quayle on Soviets Q. I'd like to return to Vice President Quayle for a minute. On Sunday, the Vice President said that the Soviets retained expansionistic attitudes in Central America, Afghanistan and several other parts of the world. He suggested that Gorbachev was a Stalinist and also suggested that the Soviet defense budget is growing while ours is declining. Do you agree with those three assessments? A. That their defense budget is growing? Yes. Q. And that Gorbachev -- A. I'd like to see - find a way to reverse that and out of the challenge that lies ahead to both Gorbachev and me, perhaps there will be a way to reverse it. One way to do that I think is through prudent arms control. The best way to do it is to do it through success in the conventional force in Europe talks, C.F.E. talks, because that's - that's dollar-intensive or ruble-intensive, if you will. . . .",1989-11-08T05:00:00+0000

But I have been told that if I do so, the new shingles will last only half as long because of heat buildup; two layers of shingles, I was told, will not allow proper cooling between the attic and the top layer. What is your opinion? A.Applying a second layer of asphalt shingles over old shingles, assuming only one layer is already in place, is a common practice, and in most cases there is nothing wrong with this. The idea of heat buildup is new to me and frankly does not make much sense; if the attic gets very hot, as most do in the summer, then it should be ventilated.",1989-11-09T05:00:00+0000

Petroleos paid $290 million, not $400 million, for the stake that it bought in 1986. Southland says it is ahead of schedule in paying off $1.54 billion in bank debt due in 1993; it has not said it expects to become profitable by that year. Because of an editing error, the article also misattributed an estimate of the cash Southland would receive. The company did not provide a figure; $500 million was The Times's estimate, based on available information.",1989-11-09T05:00:00+0000

Quintessentially English, Mr. Ayckbourn seems to require not just a British cast but a made-in-Britain production. And that's what he gets in tonight's ''Great Performances'' presentation of ''Relatively Speaking.'' It's on Channel 13 at 9 P.M. The play, first produced in 1967, is a mistaken-identity farce, which is not immediately apparent. In the first scene, Greg (Michael Maloney) wakes up in an apartment belonging to Ginny (Imogen Stubbs), whose previous lover was an older man. He has known her for only a month but is seriously proposing marriage. With a typical Ayckbourn waffle, Ginny assures Greg: ''I love you very much, more than I ever loved anybody, I think. And I'll probably say yes, but not now.'' She leaves, telling him she is going to visit her parents. He follows, determined to win them over.",1989-11-10T05:00:00+0000

The top-seeded McEnroe, beaten by the deceptive Mecir in their two previous meetings, screamed at line judges who called six foot faults on him, but held on to win in 2 hours 20 minutes. McEnroe started slowly, winning only six points in the first five games as the eighth-seeded Mecir raced to 5-0 lead, confusing McEnroe with a series of unorthodox winners. But McEnroe persisted with his serve-and-volley game, and by the end, Mecir was spraying as many errors as winners around the court. McEnroe was joined in the semifinals by his 17-year-old compatriot Michael Chang, who beat Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union, 6-3, 6-4. Chang's speed and shot selection wore down Chesnokov in a battle of baseliners. In another quarterfinal match, Robert Seguso lost, 7-5, 6-3, to Guy Forget of France. In the other quarterfinal, Wally Masur of Australia upset Brad Gilbert, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3.

Edberg held off Jim Courier, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, to join his fellow Swedes Magnus Gustafsson and Mats Wilander in the semifinals. Gustafsson, a wild-card entry ranked 92d in the world, upset fourth-seeded Andre Agassi, 6-2, 7-6.

Chris Costner Sizemore was the subject of ''The Three Faces of Eve,'' the gripping book and movie about multiple personality disorder. In ''A Mind of My Own'' she recounts her events and tells how she met the challenge of living after the drama and spectacle of her mental illness were over. Not three but 22 separate entities had inhabited her body, three at a time, each with its own distinct voice, handwriting and personality. On the day in 1974 that she achieved ''unification'' after 44 years of illness, all 22 had been done away with. But she was then far from the integrated, energetic and effective woman she is today; she had no idea how to be herself, she missed her ''alters'' like Purple Lady and Strawberry Girl terribly and she felt guilty about her long-suffering family. Though her children were devoted, her husband was a silent stranger who felt used and angry over the poverty and other burdens her illness had placed on them. In the best part of her book, she tells of remaking the intimacy of her marriage and of learning, slowly, to be a mother her children could be proud of. She became a sought-after lecturer, painter and consultant to people with multiple personalities and a force in getting multiple personality disorder recognized as a bona fide mental illness. Ms. Sizemore's book brims with the fullness of the life she and her faithful family have made; it is a warmly satisfying end to a fascinating story.",1989-11-12T05:00:00+0000

Lee Garland, the narrator and title character in Warren Kiefer's fourth novel, has a cowboy drawl and his saga of some 90 years begins, circa 1894 in the New Mexico Territory, with tales of a hoof-pounding, hair-raising, cattle-rustling adolescence that's the stuff of boyhood dreams. But this novel in the form of an autobiographical monologue moves beyond its milieu to link traditional Western themes with the breadth of American experience. At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, Lee and an assortment of rowdy frontier characters are thrown together with the privileged sons of Eastern millionaires and stockbrokers in a regiment led by Col. Teddy Roosevelt, soon to be famed as the Rough Riders. Mr. Kiefer vividly re-creates the battlefield heroics of these men, even while conveying the strong impression that, given the incompetence of their generals and the sheer misery inflicted by disease, lack of food and barbarous weaponry, it's amazing any of them survived. After brief postwar flings with New York high society and Albuquerque banking, Lee heads for adventure in the oil-rich jungles of Tampico, Mexico. Although much of the energy in ''Outlaw'' comes from this remarkable era in history, when risk-takers and visionaries reaped astonishing rewards, the crises of Lee's domestic life are treated with perspective; adventures with exploding oil rigs and Mexican revolutionaries, though numerous, are not allowed to overshadow the tragic loss of a child. The narrative pace falters somewhat in the last hundred pages, but throughout his ups and downs Lee remains a rough-humored, itchy seeker of self-defined justice, hell-bent on living an authentic life. As such, he is an appropriate narrator for this keenly American adventure tale, a saga that stirs the imagination and satisfies the heart. REBECCA SINGLETON",1989-11-12T05:00:00+0000

us,HOME ENTERTANMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Wagner: 'Parsifal' Excerpts, 'Siegfried Idyll' Bayreuth Festival Chorus and Orchestra conducted by Karl Muck (Acts I and II excerpts, ''Idyll''; Columbia, 1927). Gotthelf Pistor, tenor; Cornelis Brongeest, baritone; Ludwig Hofmann, bass; Berlin State Opera Chorus and Orchestra conducted by Muck (Act III; Electrola, 1927-28). Opal CDS 9843; two CD's only. The performance of Act III, virtually complete, dates from the early years of electric recordings, but in some ways has never been surpassed. The sound is remarkably good despite inevitable surface noise. Muck's Wagner, a wonderful combination of flowing melody, intensity and precision, is still a model for ''Parsifal'' interpreters. Hofmann brings a nobility to Gurnemanz that puts one in mind of Hans Hotter in his prime. Muck's ''Parsifal'' is less solemnly paced and not so murkily mystical as more recent versions modeled on the Hans Knappertsbusch recordings from Bayreuth. But for a ''Parsifal'' enthusiast this historic collection, bringing together every scrap of the work Muck ever recorded (nearly two hours), is enough to justify the CD revolution. - Donal Henahan Richard Strauss: 'Metamorphosen,' 'Duett-Concertino,' 'Capriccio' Prelude New Stockholm Chamber Orchestra conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. CBS MK 44702; CD and cassette. It is an almost subversive idea to entrust the last creative breaths of Richard Strauss to a 31-year-old conductor. Esa-Pekka Salonen's hot-blooded surges of tempo and heavily emphasized caesuras represent perhaps the antithesis of Strauss's inspired weariness. On the other hand, they also say things of value about how life passes from the old back to the young. Strauss's music here uses dense textures to create the impression of simplicity. The ''Duett-Concertino'' seems a pointed reference to Mozart, the ''Capriccio'' music is delicately wistful, and the great ''Metamorphosen'' breathes with nostalgia and regret. The Stockholm strings play very well. - Bernard Holland Dvorak: Violin Concerto (Op. 53); 'Romance' (Op. 11) Kyung-Wha Chung, violin; Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Riccardo Muti. EMI/Angel 7 49858; CD and cassette. Midori, violin; New York Philharmonic conducted by Zubin Mehta (with ''Carnaval''). CBS Masterworks MK 44923; CD and cassette. Whether you consider the truncated recapitulation of the concerto's first movement a novel expedient or a structural blunder (as did the violinist Joseph Joachim, who refused to perform it after offering Dvorak considerable advice on its composition), you can't deny the luscious beauty of the work as a whole. Kyung-Wha Chung's interpretation, though thoroughly engaging at first hearing, seems restrained next to Midori's. Midori's full-blooded playing and exquisitely pliant tone are intoxicating, especially in the second movement, where her phrasing and coloration truly touch the heart. Moreover the higher volume level and generally more open sound of the CBS disk add to the overall sense of aural presence. - Barrymore L. Scherer Puccini: Songs, Hymns Placido Domingo, tenor; Julius Rudel, piano, organ. CBS Masterworks MK 44981; CD and cassette. Michael Kaye, the author of the valuable study ''The Unknown Puccini'' (Oxford University Press, 1987), has provided texts, translations and helpful annotations for this interesting release. Included are two religious hymns with organ accompaniment, a sketch for an operatic scene (''Mentia l'Avviso''), the bombastic ''Inno a Roma'' and several brief rarities written for various occasions. For the most part, they are early efforts. The winners are the Tosti-like ''A Te,'' the charming lullaby ''E l'Uccellino'' and the ardent ''Solo e Amore,'' which eventually found its way into the third act of ''La Boheme.'' When the range is comfortable, Placido Domingo is his warm-toned, manly, confident self. But some of his sustained notes are uncharacteristically wavery, and the top is sometimes effortful. - George Jellinek Britten: 'War Requiem' Lorna Haywood, soprano; Anthony Rolfe Johnson, tenor; Benjamin Luxon, baritone; Atlanta Symphony Chorus and Orchestra conducted by Robert Shaw. Telarc 80157; two CD's only. Composed for the 1962 consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral in England (which replaced a medieval building destroyed in World War II), this work is rivaled perhaps only by Penderecki's ''Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima'' as the most searing musical indictment of warfare. Unlike Berlioz and Verdi, who contemplate the spiritual majesty of death, or Brahms and Faure, who celebrate the peace of eternal rest, Britten juxtaposes the Latin Requiem text with poetry by Wilfred Owen to address not so much death as the horror of man's useless killing. Britten's own recording of the work has long been the standard, but this performance by the elder statesman of choral conductors is as vital and as moving. Telarc's sound is superb. - B. L. S. POP/JAZZ Miriam Makeba: 'Welela' Mercury 838 208; all three formats. Revitalized after her magnificent 1988 album of traditional South African songs, ''Sangoma,'' Miriam Makeba mixes old and new on ''Welela,'' using a polished modern production to carry recent and traditional songs. Over rolling vamps steeped in South African pop (and, for one song, in Mexican pop), Miss Makeba looses her grainy, indomitable voice, sometimes riding the harmonies of a hearty chorale. Miss Makeba's repertory is pointedly political alongside her traditional songs, but she puts melody ahead of preaching. The lilt of ''A Luta Continua,'' a tribute to Mozambique, makes it one of the most infectious agitprop songs of the decade. - Jon Pareles Michael Feinstein: 'The M-G-M Album' Elektra 9-60893; all three formats. From musicologist to cabaret performer to Broadway entertainer to old-fashioned pop crooner, Michael Feinstein's musical identity has added many layers in the last five years. On ''The M-G-M Album,'' a collection of songs introduced in M-G-M musicals between 1929 and 1969, he shows he has found a comfortable balance between heart-on-the-sleeve cabaret singing and the rather chilly pop crooning of his last album, ''Isn't It Romantic.'' While he lacks the projection to chew the scenery with numbers like ''That's Entertainment,'' his ballad singing, especially Leslie Bricusse's ''You and I,'' is strong and heartfelt. And Ian Bernard's orchestral arrangements offer a confident stylistic hybrid of movie-musical soundtracks and 50's studio pop. - Stephen Holden The Rev. Lonnie Farris: 'Vocal and Steel Guitar' Eden Records 3-200; LP only (available from Down Home Music, 10341 San Pablo Avenue, El Cerrito, Calif. 94530). Recorded in Los Angeles in the early 1960's, the album captures an American oddity in action. The Rev. Lonnie Farris, a thunder-voiced gospel singer who could sing sweetly, also plays steel guitar. To hear him, backed by an ambling and slightly disheveled gospel rhythm section, the Gospel Flames, is a treat. ''All right, guitar,'' he calls to himself before quivering his way through the melody on guitar, mixing the sound of Hawaii with deep blues and gospel. He is joined by other singers, and an occasional full and robust tenor saxophone as well. - Peter Watrous 'Get With the Beat: The Mar-Vel' Masters' Rykodisc 20126; CD and cassette. From 1949 to 1966, Mar-Vel' Records in Calumet City, Ill., recorded the music of rural Southerners who had recently migrated north, paralleling black blues musicians in nearby Chicago. To judge by the 27 songs on ''Get With the Beat,'' Mar-Vel' brought out a loopy humor, sometimes verging on dementia, in its roster of obscure Midwestern rockabillies. Ginny Carter in ''Seven Lonely Days'' manages to weep and yodel simultaneously; Bobby Sisco's ''Honky Tonkin' Rhythm'' has a steel-guitar solo worthy of a 1980's Lower East Side noise band. Twangy guitars and songs about itchy feet and hot lips and jumpin' all night summon not oldies nostalgia, but astonishment at American music's wild-eyed abundance. - J. P. The Lilac Time: 'Paradise Circus' Polygram 838 641; all three formats. Gentleness can be deceptive. The Lilac Time's lulling acoustic-guitar strums, brushed drums and tender harmonies dress their folk-pop in irresistible softness; the vocalist Stephen Duffy sings the word ''love'' like a 17-year-old in the first blush of it. But his lyrics have an understated wittiness that belies the la-la lushness of the songs: ''I love you through the diesel fumes,'' he pledges in ''The Girl Who Waves at Trains,'' as if even soot couldn't cloud his rosy vision. The title track is an accordion instrumental taken from Wim Wenders's film ''Wings of Desire'' - this Birmingham (England) trio has an affinity for sounds that are sweetly melancholic. - Karen Schoemer",1989-11-12T05:00:00+0000

This year, after he had his heart attack - embarrassingly, 40 minutes into a Politburo meeting - the doctor ordered him to spend a week in bed. But Hu, 74, was impatient; in particular, he was tired of bedpans. In the early morning of April 15, on the seventh day after the heart attack, Hu raised his lithe, 5 foot, 3 inch frame from the bed and stepped toward the bathroom. It was too much for him. Hu Yaobang suffered a seizure, collapsed and died. Hu's seizure was a prelude to China's. His death triggered weeks of massive protests, giddy days last April and May when throngs of more than a million filled the streets of Beijing, criticizing the growing corruption, and in general demanding more of the democracy that Hu had come to symbolize. And then, after seven exhilarating weeks, it all came to a sudden end. In the early hours of June 4, as the world watched in horror, the tanks of the People's Liberation Army rolled toward Tiananmen Square and troops fired on the crowds, killing hundreds and wounding thousands.",1989-11-12T05:00:00+0000

Women, it would seem, cannot love money with this pure, spiritual flame; they prefer to convert abstract wealth into tangible objects. To this end, they go shopping.

He was notably brutal as he entered unlocked houses late at night to kill, rape and maim, in one case gouging a victim's eyes out. Last week, before he was sentenced to death in the gas chamber, the 29-year-old Mr. Ramirez delivered a rambling statement about his crimes. ''You don't understand,'' he said. ''You are not capable of it. I am beyond good and evil. Repeat not the errors of the Night Prowler and show no mercy.'' The convicted murderer then proclaimed, ''Lucifer dwells within us all.'' Said the prosecutor, P. Philip Halpin: ''Baloney.'' He added, ''I wouldn't want anyone to listen to what he has to say because he is a pathetic human being who is grasping at some structure in his life.''

On Tuesday the Fed added money to the banking system when the Federal funds rate was at 8 11/16, bringing the rate down to 8 1/2 percent. But when the rate went below that, to 8 3/8, the Fed acted to drain money from the system, leading analysts to conclude that the easing would be limited. Southwest Bank of St. Louis, a small institution that often is the first to move on rates, cut its prime rate to 10 percent, from 10.5 percent, but no big banks immediately matched the cut. The Fed's actions came in a confusing week, with the Treasury forced to delay its auctions while awaiting Congressional action on the national debt. But once the debt ceiling was raised to $3.12 trillion, the auctions began, and they confirmed a lowering of rates. The three-year notes sold at an average yield of 7.77 percent, the lowest since February 1988. *",1989-11-12T05:00:00+0000

Last week, the insurance company decided to pay off the $100,000 benefit due under the accidental-death clause of the policy, with part of the payment going to Mr. Hartwig's family. Amex maintained that the payment had been delayed only because of a dispute between the Hartwigs and the Truitts. But Mr. Truitt's lawyer said payment had been held up while the company decided whether Mr. Hartwig had committed suicide. ''If the insurance company thought he had committed suicide, they would not have paid,'' the lawyer said.

us,New & Noteworthy,"NATURAL OBSESSIONS: Striving to Unlock the Deepest Secrets of the Cancer Cell, by Natalie Angier. (Warner, $14.95.) A journalist becomes resident anthropologist in a molecular biology lab, chronicling the search for genes that cause cells to become malignant. Natalie Angier ''admirably dispels any thought that the ivory tower of research is a haven for selfless nerds and drudges,'' Eric Lax said here last year. ''The people in her book are as attractive and as complex and even as quirky as their subjects.'' DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words, by Milorad Pavic. Translated by Christina Pribicevic-Zoric. (Vintage, $9.95.) Until their disappearance a millennium ago, the Khazars lived in a land where the seasons were marked by calendars that flowed in both directions and it was possible to read colors as though they were words. Milorad Pavic's novel about this fictional tribe is as malleable as the Khazars' worldview: flipping back and forth among alphabetized, cross-referenced entries, readers can assemble a do-it-yourself narrative. Last year our reviewer, Robert Coover, said he found the book ''rather light and airy,'' but he praised ''the structural novelty and the comic inventiveness of the imagery.'' SEEDS OF FIRE: Chinese Voices of Conscience. Edited by Geremie Barme and John Minford. (Noonday/ Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12.95.) In a new foreword, Orville Schell tells how this collection of works by dissident Chinese writers foreshadowed the recent events in Tiananmen Square. In January, The Times's Richard Bernstein said the book ''fills a yawning gap'' in the West's knowledge of human rights in China. ''It thrusts a candle of illumination into the dark shadow of ignorance that has long cast itself over the world's most populous country.'' THE HIGH ROAD, by Edna O'Brien. (Plume/New American Library, $8.95.) An Irish expatriate shatters the languid calm of a Spanish island when she has an affair with a local peasant girl. ''The language here is often infused with an intense energy,'' Marilynne Robinson said here in 1988. THE DARK SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE: A Scientist Explores the Mysteries of the Cosmos, by James Trefil. (Anchor/Doubleday, $9.95.) The author of ''A Scientist at the Seashore'' explains why physicists have come to believe that 90 percent of the matter in the universe is invisible. James Trefil ''shows once again that he can describe the history and philosophy of science humorously, anecdotally and yet profoundly,'' David Perlman said here last year. ''He can also make a persuasive case for the pure esthetics of physics and astronomy.'' THE AGE OF GRIEF: A Novella and Stories, by Jane Smiley. (Ivy, $3.95.) In the title piece of this collection, the marriage between two dentists becomes so strained that they can talk to each other only about teeth. In 1987 our reviewer, Anne Bernays, said the book ''is artless in the best sense, a triumph of the craft of narrative, for we believe that all written here really happened.'' THE RITES OF AUTUMN: A Falconer's Journey Across the American West, by Dan O'Brien. (Anchor/ Doubleday, $9.95.) A biologist teaches a tamed peregrine falcon how to survive outside civilization. ''We are absorbed not only in the falcon's struggle to regain her place in the wild, but also in the almost symbiotic relationship that develops over time,'' Harry Middleton said here earlier this year. ''It is as if Mr. O'Brien too is somehow participating on a last and desperate migration, a migration to steep himself in what is left of the once great wilderness lands of the American West.'' BROTHERS IN ARMS, by Michael Carson. (Plume/ New American Library, $8.95.) While coming to terms with his homosexuality, an English schoolboy decides to join a seminary. ''The attitudes and motivations of the characters are rendered with precision, yielding what seems to be a realistic depiction of gay rites of passage,'' Richard C. Skidmore said here last year. THE FIRST SALUTE, by Barbara W. Tuchman. (Ballantine, $11.95.) By retelling a selection of favorite stories, Barbara Tuchman puts the American Revolution into the context of 18th-century European politics. She ''chronicles these events with her customary skill,'' John Gross said in The Times last year. ''She rises to the heroic and tragic aspects of the drama, but she can be drily amusing, too.'' SUMMIT, by D. M. Thomas. (Washington Square/ Pocket Books, $4.95.) An actor turned President shows up at a European summit conference with a strategic antimatter defense system (Independent Unilateral Defense, or I.U.D.) that was inspired by a computer game invented by his grandson. Last year Michiko Kakutani said in The Times that D. M. Thomas is ''so adept at using his gifts for mimicry to parody diplomatic double talk that even his wildest scenarios sparkle with a kind of crazy logic.'' THE ESSENTIAL GESTURE: Writing, Politics and Places, by Nadine Gordimer. Edited by Stephen Clingman. (Penguin, $9.95.) In a collection of essays, articles and speeches, the South African novelist tells how she can keep living under a regime that is a ''pact of capitalism and racism.'' Last year our reviewer, William Boyd, called the book ''stimulating and timely.'' AN ARTIST OF THE FLOATING WORLD, by Kazuo Ishiguro. (Vintage, $8.95.) Living in disgrace after World War II, a Japanese artist remembers how as a young man he decided to use his talents to glorify the imperialist movement. Last year our reviewer, Kathryn Morton, said Kazuo Ishiguro's novel ''is the kind that stretches the reader's awareness, teaching him to read more perceptively.''",1989-11-12T05:00:00+0000

Perched, eyes fixed on the distance, he offers raptly, ''To fly/ To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride/ On the curled clouds'' for his master Prospero. He sails across the stage again, supported not by wires but through what appears to be an innate capability of flight, and lands as if on a current of air. He floats. His knees slowly bend and straighten; his arms gradually, just perceptibly, rise and fall on the invisible breeze.

But at home in Connecticut, we'd decided to take advantage of a combination deal that would also give us a taste of Grand Targhee, a resort a little over an hour away from Jackson Hole, on the other side of the Tetons. Word had filtered through that this obscure area in the Targhee National Forest - in Alta, Wyo., but accessible only through Driggs, Idaho - combined some of the West's best powder and deepest snowfall (an average of 500 inches a year) with the kind of low-key atmosphere that's all but disappeared from the big mountains of the American ski scene.",1989-11-12T05:00:00+0000

Of the four people sentenced so far in connection with the illegal sale of arms to Iran to raise money for illegal contributions to the contras, none has been found guilty of actually selling the weapons and none has gone to jail. It appeared last week that Richard V. Secord had made a bid to join the community service corps when, days before his trial on 12 felony charges was to begin, he pleaded guilty to a single count of lying to Congressional investigators. Mr. Secord, a former Air Force major general, could get up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. But he also agreed to testify in coming Iran-contra trials and his sentencing was delayed. Mr. Secord is expected to be helpful in the prosecution of the remaining defendants: John M. Poindexter, the former national security adviser, whose trial is to begin Jan. 22; Albert A.

That is where Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania, who broke the course record by 12 seconds last Sunday, and Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway, the winner of the women's division, trained for the race through the city's five boroughs. Mr. Ikangaa, a 29-year-old Army officer and a world-class runner with a reputation for not winning the big ones, normally trains near his home in Arusha, not far from Mount Kilimanjaro. For New York, however, he moved to Alamosa, Colo., which is flatter but twice as elevated as his home. ''Running there is very difficult because the air is so thin,'' he said. When Ms. Kristiansen, who is 33 years old and who ran the entire marathon in front, returned to her home in Boulder, Colo., in September, she wanted to withdraw from the race. She was exhausted from a bout with bronchitis and a taxing European competition. But after a week's layoff and thinking about what she could accomplish in New York, the only major marathon she had not won, Ms. Kristiansen resumed training, saying to herself, ''I will go for it.''",1989-11-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Talking Business with Olsen of Digital Equipment; Testing I.B.M. On Mainframes,"Kenneth H. Olsen, president and founder of the Digital Equipment Corporation, has made a career of doing well the things that International Business Machines Inc. does not do. But in October Mr. Olsen's Maynard, Mass., company introduced its first mainframe computer, moving into a market where growth is slowing and I.B.M. jealously guards its territory. Q. Some people believe that I.B.M. owns the mainframe market, and that this market may become obsolete. Why did you choose to enter it now? A. It is owned by I.B.M. in this country, but the Japanese have a big part worldwide. One of the things that we have that is unique, that makes our VAX popular, is that you can grow it in increments - you don't have to buy the big one to start with. As the job grows and the company grows, you can add to it. That makes it very attractive. Q. What is the place for your VAX computer architecture in the future? A. If you want to tie things together or make a commercial system, then you have to go with VAX or an I.B.M. system; you have no choice. You're not going to put a commercial system on a desk. You're not going to spread your bank's data out on desks. You want absolute reliability and security. Q. Can you look around the economy today and see whole areas of application that haven't existed? A. Oh yes, very much. We've always been a little bored with supermarket retailing. But other areas of retailing badly need computing, and they know it. Q. Are your sales abroad growing more rapidly than here? There's a suggestion that you found Europe and Japan more receptive and dynamic in some ways than the American economy. A. Capital investment in Japan is 18 to 20 percent of their gross national product. In this country it's almost half that. And the thing that is terrifying for the future is the trade balance is going to mushroom in the wrong direction because we're investing less and less, and they're investing more and more. We look at Europe and think they're going to become protectionist in 1992, and if they're protectionist we'll become even more protectionist. Q. How does Digital play its hand? Do you look abroad for your real growth? A. We keep a stiff upper lip. This year we're investing $1.5 billion in research and development and $1.3 billion in capital equipment, most of it in this country. Q. Have you considered participating in I.B.M.'s X-ray lithography semiconductor development program? A. They've talked to us about it, but it doesn't fit in with our plans. My point is that it isn't specific technology. Semiconductor memories are a good example. Semiconductor memories go to the country with the lowest cost of capital. The cost of capital is a major part of the cost of semiconductor memories. When politicians say that they are going to get semiconductor memories in this country, it's like saying we're going to grow bananas in North Dakota. Only a politician would think he could do that, but it ain't going to work. Q. If Japan has a lower cost of capital, and it has a large capital market, why can't you dip into that and even out that advantage? A. I'm not bashing the Japanese when I say this, but we're having a contest with them in which they're generating low interest rates to support their business and we're taxing exports, keeping our interest rates high. Q. Is U.S. Memories, a proposed consortium of chip makers, a little bit like trying to grow bananas in North Dakota? A. No, in terms of being a great success and being competitive. It's more than just getting a few people together and spending a few dollars. But whether it is a good idea to try is another thing. We ought to have the technology here. Q. Are supercomputers a kind of national asset that the United States should do something about? A. Supercomputers are important, but they're not the overwhelming thing. They don't replace guns. Q. Robert Tappan Morris, who in 1988 wrote the program that crashed the national computer network, worked briefly for your company. Do you think he should be punished? A. On different days I say different things. The attitude of many of our people is that it's a shame to ruin such a creative competent human being who did a dumb thing. The other point of view is that you have to make an example of him. I tend toward the view, don't ruin a human being, but I know the weakness of that, too. Q. Do you think there are potential markets in Eastern Europe and Moscow? A. Yes and no. Somebody ought to sell to the Russians because we have a vested interest in their being successful.",1989-11-14T05:00:00+0000

Since Monday, reports have circulated in Washington that the Administration has directed the Pentagon to cut back financing for high-definition television research and other high-technology efforts. Such programs are viewed by many as vital to American competitiveness. [ Page A1. ] Sun Microsystems and Unisys said they would not participate in U.S. Memories, a company being formed to produce computer memory chips. [ D1. ] Growth of business inventories outpaced business sales in September, the Government said in a report that analysts said included a warning of the slowing economy. [ D1. ] An Ohio appeals court threw out the convictions of the former owner of Home State Savings, Marvin Warner, and one co-defendant that resulted from the collapse of the savings institution. [ D2. ] Rapidly expanding Federal insurance and credit-assistance programs expose the Government to losses of $5 trillion, an amount equal to the value of the economy's annual output. [ D6. ] INTERNATIONAL Moving to take advantage of change in Eastern Europe, G.E. said it had agreed to buy control of a Hungarian light-bulb maker for $150 million, the largest American investment in Hungary since World War II. The deal represents the kind of payoff that East bloc nations have been seeking as they make political and economic changes more attuned to market forces. [ A1. ] John Reed of Citicorp said Argentina's creditor banks will not talk with Argentina about reducing its $64 billion foreign debt until they get a ''good faith'' payment on back interest. [ D2. ] COMPANIES Abandoning its yearlong effort to sell the Sears Tower, Sears, Roebuck said it would instead seek to raise $815 million by taking out a mortgage on the building. [ D1. ] Northrop named Oliver C. Boileau, a former president of General Dynamics, to oversee its B-2 Stealth bomber program. [ D1. ] Southland is considering major changes, saying that slowing sales in its 7-Eleven stores had raised doubts about its ability to generate enough cash for its debt payments in 1991. [ D5. ] Smith International agreed to be acquired by Dresser, an oil services giant, in a deal valued at $675 milllion. [ D5. ] Airbus said it had reached a preliminary agreement to sell five A310 airliners to Aeroflot, the Soviet airline. Airbus said the agreement included options for five more aircraft.

Aureole ** (Jan. 6, 1989), 34 East 61st Street, (319-1660) - This airy, cream-and-beige dining room in a converted town house is an attractive spot for a festive Thanksgiving dinner. The special menu starts with an alder-wood smoked salmon followed by poached Maine lobster and sweet corn chowder. The main course choice is between roast turkey with three dressings or saddle of venison with roast pears. Dessert options are pumpkin-and-praline pie or apple tart with crisp streusel. The Thanksgiving dinner is prix fixe at $55. Dinner from 2 P.M. to 8:30 P.M. Ballroom * (June 30, 1989), 253 West 28th Street (244-3005) - This spacious and comfortable dining room, with its rustic, colorful tapas bar, is having its annual Festival of the Birds. The menu for the day starts with a choice of tapas or soup (pumpkin, black bean or wild turkey consomme). Then, as befitting the festival, there is a plethora of main-course choices: roast turkey with corn-bread stuffing, wild turkey with black walnuts, roast Cornish hen with green peppercorns, braised quail with wild thyme, roast pheasant with wild mushrooms, grilled duck with figs, and cassoulet of goose with braised vegetables. This is followed by the mixed greens with raspberry vinaigrette. Prices range from $28.50 to $48.50 (dessert not included). Seatings at 1, 3:30, 6 and 8:30 P.M. Carolina * (Feb. 14, 1986), 355 West 46th Street (245-0058) - One of the prettiest spots on Restaurant Row, Carolina has an arching skylight, comfortable banquettes and wraparound glass walls that multiply a sole palm tree into an urban grove. The ample Thanksgiving menu starts with a choice or seafood chowder or black bean soup followed by an appetizer choice of crab cakes, hot smoked sausages or smoked salmon. Beyond the requisite roast turkey, there is bourbon baked ham, roast pheasant with corn bread and apple stuffing and herb-roasted smoked leg of lamb (all with maple walnut sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, corn pudding and condiments). A light finale would be pecan fingers or lime pie. Prix fixe at $40. Thanksgiving dinner served from 1 to 8 P.M. Greene Street Restaurant ** (April 29, 1988), 101 Greene Street (925-2415) - This theatrical multi-tier SoHo loft would be a dramatic place to spend Thanksgiving Day, given the bonus of entertainment by the Lynn Bernstein piano-and-bass duo. The chef has provided an enticing selection for the holiday, starting with a choice of pumpkin soup, grilled quail salad or gray sole in a lemon-butter sauce. After a pause for a mixed-green salad, there is a choice of roast turkey with apple-chestnut stuffing, roast partridge in a marjoram cream sauce or loin of venison in a poivrade. Dessert makes for a difficult decision: warm apple-pecan tart, mincemeat strudel with honey-caramel ice cream or frozen rum-pumpkin souffle. Prix-fixe $38.50. Thanksgiving dinner from 3:30 P.M. to 10 P.M. Rainbow Room ** (March 25, 1988), 30 Rockefeller Plaza (632-5000) - This is perhaps one of the most romantic settings in which to spend this festive occasion: a sumptuous Art Moderne dining room evocative of another era of New York with panoramic views of the city. The Thanksgiving menu offers an abundance of temptations. Appetizers include warm seafood sausage on glazed leeks, wild mushrooms in puff pastry and a terrine of game and truffles. After a soup course, there is grilled fillet of salmon on wild rice, crisp duck with tiny wine grapes and lentil flan, medallions of farm venison with toasted barley pilaf and prime rib of beef with Yorkshire pudding. A cranberry cheesecake and a frozen maple souffle with hot chocolate sauce are among the dessert offerings. Prix fixe at $55. Seatings at noon, 12:30, 2:30, 3, 5, 5:30, 7:30 and 8 P.M.

us,"Antilock Brakes, Once Rare, Emerge as Prime Auto Option","DETROIT, Nov. 17 - Antilock brakes, once considered an esoteric device to prevent uncontrolled skidding on slippery roads, are showing up as standard equipment or being offered as optional equipment in many new car, truck and van models. So more new-car buyers than ever before are getting a chance to buy this safety feature. Automotive experts say the proliferation of these specialized braking systems - sometimes called A.B.S. - is likely to continue through the late 1990's, when antilock brakes are expected to become fairly common even on economy models. Some insurance companies are granting discounts to clients whose cars have the brakes. Consumer advocates advise drivers who are shopping for cars now to make antilock brakes an important consideration. A Helpless Feeling The benefits of antilock brakes will be immediately evident to anyone who ever has had the experience of inadvertently braking too hard on a slippery road, only to encounter a frightening loss of control as the car careers or spins toward a possible collision. In this kind of situation, the wheels of the car, having been stopped by the brakes, remain locked while the car continues to skid. The steering wheel is useless: no matter which way it is turned, the vehicle continues to move in the direction it was moving at the moment the wheels were locked. Sometimes the car will turn sideways or begin to spin. Driver-education courses warn against slamming on the brake pedal precisely because it is so easy to lock the wheels on a slippery surface because of the lack of friction between the rubber and the road. Students are taught that on wet or icy roads, they should repeatedly pump the brakes gently then quickly release the pressure until the vehicle slows or stops. The series of short braking actions reduces the chance of lockup. Electronics Take Over In essence, antilock brakes mimic those instructions, automatically applying and releasing pressure even faster than a driver could. As the brakes are applied, an electronic sensor detects when a wheel is about to lock and then releases it, overriding any pressure on the pedal. The driver retains the ability to steer the car and can depress the brakes as hard as possible without releasing pressure: the system will slow the wheels gradually without locking them. In some systems the driver can actually feel the pedal pulsing as the computer is applying and releasing the brakes. The General Motors Corporation is installing antilock brakes as standard equipment in 20 of its 1990 models and will offer the system as optional equipment in 13 models. The most expensive Cadillac models will include antilock brakes, and so will sportier versions of the Pontiac Grand Prix and Buick Electra, as well as the Chevrolet Astro van. Buyers of the Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and other medium-sized models can pay $925 to receive them as an option. For 1990, the Ford Motor Company has made antilock brakes standard on the Lincoln Continental, the Lincoln Mark VII, the Mercury Cougar and the Aerostar van, and some versions of the Taurus, the Thunderbird and other models. If ordered as an option, the brakes cost $924 to $1,085. The Chrysler Corporation offers the system as standard on the Maserati TC, and as an option on the Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer, the Dodge Dynasty, Chrysler Imperial and Chrysler New Yorker for $926 to $998. The brakes are standard on Acuras, and some Mazdas. Toyota, Nissan, , Mitsubishi and Subaru all offer them as an option on a varitety of models; the prices range from $995 to $1,495. They are standard on all BMW's, Jaguars and many models of Mercedes-Benz. G.M., Ford and Chrysler also offer antilock brakes on many pickup trucks. Like many advances in automotive technology, this one has been around for decades. It was first used on airplanes in the 1950's and in large trucks in the 1960's. Only in recent years, however, have auto makers deemed the systems practical and economical enough for industrywide distribution. This follows the pattern of disk brakes, which were introduced in more expensive vehicles and, over time, became commonplace. Josef Mack, a manager for the Robert Bosch Corporation, a leading making of antilock brake systems, estimates that 15 to 20 percent of the cars and trucks on the road will have them in the near future. ""Since 1978 we have produced four million systems worldwide, and many consumers who have them say they'll never own another car without them,"" he said. At present, it is so complicated and costly to retrofit a car or truck with an A.B.S. that it is not practical. Some Practice Needed The brakes take a little getting used to. Deepak Dighe, a G.M. engineer, said pumping them, as many drivers been trained to do with stanbard brakes, will not take full advantage of the antilock technology. Perhaps the greatest potential danger with respect to these systems is that they may imbue drivers with an undue sense of invulnerability when driving on wet or icy pavement. ""Antilock brakes improve controllability, but they don't necessarily reduce the stopping distance on slippery pavement,"" Mr. Dighe said. ""You cannot defy the laws of physics. It still takes longer to stop a vehicle on wet pavement than on dry."" - CONSUMER'S WORLD",1989-11-18T05:00:00+0000

us,FOOTBALL,"LOOKING DEEP. By Terry Bradshaw with Buddy Martin. (Contemporary, $17.95.) As Susan Sontag once remarked, writing well is the best revenge. Revenge is probably not what Terry Bradshaw had in mind when he wrote ''Looking Deep'' with the Denver Post sports columnist Buddy Martin, but that is what he has got: revenge over the scores of sportswriters who called him dumb during his career as a quarterback with the Pittsburg Steelers and who will never write a book about football as good as this one. Mr Bradshaw knows that even his staunchest fans are not very interested in his life outside of football, so he does not spend too much time on it. In fact, he seems not to have had much of a life off the gridiron; he does not dilute his accounts of high school, college and professioanl jock life with attempts at fitting his experiences into the big picture. If you want to know what is feels like to win a Super Bowl or to get knocked cold by a Dallas Cowboys linebacker, Mr. Bradshaw will tell you. Playing in a SuperBowl is all he ever wanted to do, he says, and the purity of his joy at having been fortunate enough to be on the winning side in four of them rings true. Mr Bradshaw is candid about the bigotry he carried with him out of his natuve rural Lousisana (''I simply had never encountered black culture. ... It didn't take me long to figure out I was prejudiced''). He is mercifully brief about the much-publicized breakup of his marriage to the ice skater JoJo Starbuck and completely without illusions about his own status as a celebrity: ''I guess if it means that people pay you money to hang out with them, play golf, and give speeches, then I qualify.'' We can only hope that Ronald Reagan's memoirs will be so honest.",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

Testifying in an Atlanta courtroom last week, Mr. Starr said he and other musicians were under the influence of drink and drugs when they recorded the album, and contended that his musical reputation would be injured if the album's producer, Chips Moman, were allowed to release it. For his part, Mr. Moman contended that he was just trying to help out a fading star and that he had sunk $146,000 into making the album. Mr. Starr conceded that he had not had a hit record in recent years, but denied that he was desperate when he and Mr. Moman made their arrangement. In any case, the world may never know just how bad the record is. The court granted a permanent injunction blocking its release. Still at issue are certain contractural obligations - or lack of same. Mr. Moman said that the disputed album was but the first of three that Mr. Starr had agreed to let him produce.

Here is a history of the conflict. 1979: Reform-minded Army officers stage coup in hopes of stemming appeal of guerrillas, but new junta's efforts to call elections are thwarted. 1980: Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero is assassinated; killer is never caught, but United States says ''convincing evidence'' links Roberto D'Aubuisson, founder of rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, to the killing. Leftist guerrillas unite. In December, rightist death squads kill six leftist political leaders and three American nuns and a lay worker. Five National Guard members are later convicted of killing the church women. In December, Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat, becomes President in junta. 1981: Killings by rightist death squads increase. In January, a land redistribution official and two Americans working with him are killed; two National Guard members are later convicted. Guerrilla offensive fails to set off insurrection. Army is accused of massacres of civilians. American assistance grows. 1982-3: Elections for constituent assembly are held despite leftist boycott and violence. Rightists win dominance. Human rights worker is murdered in March 1983, and in fall weekly total of murders by death squads exceeds 200. Army has only limited success in subduing guerrilla offensive in southwest. New Constitution goes into effect in December. 1984: Mr. Duarte defeats Mr. d'Aubuisson in voting for President and is inaugurated in June. Initial talks between Government and rebels end in recriminations. 1985-86: Reports of political murders decline; efforts to arrange peace talks fail. An earthquake kills 2,000 people. 1987: El Salvador takes part in Central American peace talks, which begin but are canceled after murder of human rights leader, apparently by rightists. Two leftist political leaders, Ruben Zamora and Guillermo Ungo, return from exile. 1988: Mr. Duarte is told he has terminal liver cancer. His party loses legislative elections to Arena. Rebels assassinate at least eight mayors. 1989: In February, Government and rebels open new negotiations in Mexico. Alfredo Cristiani of Arena wins presidential election and promises to curb party's terrorism.

It was a novel about the ribald life of a legendary (and fictitious) Dallas football team. Now the football team has grown up. It is 20 years later and Peter Gent, himself a former Dallas Cowboys flanker and tight end, has given us a sequel, this time concerning the team's reunion. Whether the fan will smile after reading ''North Dallas After Forty'' is another matter. Part of the difficulty lies in the nature of a sequel. The author rightly assumes new readers will not have read ''North Dallas Forty,'' so we are given chapter after chapter of then's and now's. The reader is jolted back and forth in time, which creates jarring breaks in the book's rhythm. With the exception of the narrator, who is drawn fully and sympathetically, the characters emerge as stick figures. The book might have benefited from a more detailed portrait of a few of the teammates as they approach their reunion. Instead Mr. Gent adds character after character to a series of improbable plots and subplots. There is the giant Dallas corporation that milks savings and loans, buys politicians, operates a drug cartel and purchases the football team with its profits. There is the Central Intelligence Agency in the form of two inept agents, a district attorney with a $300-a-day cocaine habit, the narrator's wife (who is sleeping with the evil lawyer who is handling her divorce) and the team's former coach, who as Governor of Texas is almost assassinated in a motorcade in Dallas (sound familiar?). To get his characters out of these plot machinations isn't easy, and the author opts for death - by murder, suicide, AIDS and the tumultuous rise of the Purgatory River, which sweeps some of the bad guys away. This may be a good book for those who loved the original and want to read the next installment. But between you and me, it wouldn't have hurt if the river had swept away the sequel.",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS CULTURE,"Museums reflect culture and to some measure control it. They collect and exhibit what their curators find instructive or exceptional. In MUSEOLOGY (Aperture, $39.95), the photographer Richard Ross presents the results of a 10-year exploration of art and natural history museums in the United States, France, England, Egypt and Greece. His delicate color photographs - disquieting images of stuffed animals, ancient torsos and marble women - are identified only by the museums where they were taken. By refusing to label his images with scientific particulars, Mr. Ross subverts the museum's mandate to educate and forces us to reconsider the nature of the institution. An odd spirit pervades rooms crammed with unlikely combinations of creatures. The French glass case holding a rhino's head is mysteriously cracked, for example; a crocodile seems to scale the wall of a shabby Cairo gallery and a young antelope emerges from storage boxes in Vienna's Naturhistorisches Museum. The one sure life sign that he uncovers is decay: lions locked in combat for decades have moth-eaten hides. If Mr. Ross stresses the deadening atmosphere of museums by focusing on sedate rows of framed paintings and encased samples of the world's wildlife, his photographs achieve a vitality of their own through humorous juxtapositions, suggestive light and, sometimes, sheer glowing beauty. The book ends with a series of Mr. Ross's own photographic triptychs, blurry appropriations of art from an earlier period, proving that museums can encourage the creative spirit as well as stifle it.",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

Unless you happen to be as faithful a Lewis Grizzard fan as, say, my father, you might read his latest collection of Southern-fried columns from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and find yourself asking: Who is he? What is he? Why is he? Mr. Grizzard is, in 1989, still japing about leisure suits (lime-green, of course) and ''girls whose first names end in i.'' When he does hit on a contemporary idea, like the Japanese buying up America, he devotes three columns to it, but comes up with only one funny line, that about Vanna White having ''to learn eight zillion character signs in the Japanese alphabet to keep her job.'' (There is another funny bit, on talking in code in a Soviet hotel room to confuse the K.G.B. ''maid.'' ''Roger. The big polar bear walks late'' is translated, ''Dang right. I'm going over to a bar tonight at a hotel where they are supposed to have ice.'') Other than the Japanese, his favorite targets are fat women, women golfers, and liberal Democrats, which raises the question of what exactly Mr. Grizzard stands for. His objections to men wearing neckties would seem to disqualify him from the Grand Old Party. Perhaps, considering his baiting of professional athletes who speak substandard English, he is one of those states' rights Democrats. My guess is that Mr. Grizzard thinks of himself as a good ol' bad-boy, what with his bathroom jokes (see book title) and studied yahooism. But he lacks the demonic inspiration to truly offend anyone. Nor does his heart seem to be in his trademark autobiographical asides about his heart-valve operations, fear of flying, former wives, sex life.

For 20 years, Bo Schembechler has coached the University of Michigan Wolverines, and if success is to be measured by the number of postseason bowl appearances and Big Ten championships a team earns, he has to be judged one of this country's premier college football coaches. But like other college coaches who have reached the status of demigods - Paul (Bear) Bryant and Mr. Schembechler's mentor, Woody Hayes, leap immediately to mind - he has a reputation for toughness, meanness, bad temper and downright unpleasant behavior both on and off the field. With the help of Mitch Albom, a columnist for The Detroit Free Press, Bo, as he has been known ever since one of his sisters couldn't quite get her lips around the word brother, is out to set the record straight. Beneath this hard-nosed exterior beats the heart of a highly moral, dedicated man, deeply concerned with the best interests of his student athletes. And the funny things is, after readng ''Bo,'' you will likely come away thinking that if you had a son and he had the ability to play college football, you wouldn't mind putting him in the hands of Bo Schembechler. Deservedly or not, Mr. Schembechler has the reputation of being a conservative, predictable coach. He gives a very creditable argument that this reputation is underserved, but in many ways this book follows a conservative, predictable formula. There are wonderful chapters on Hayes and Bryant and some interestng ideas on how to motivate a team, but for the most part the rest of the book is rather hum-drum - no startling revelations here. Nevertheless, if you're sitting around on a Saturday afternoon and there's no game on television, you could do a lot worse than propping your feet up, grabbing a beer and spending a couple of hours with''Bo.''",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT:NEW VIDEO RELEASES,"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen 1989. RCA/Columbia. $89.95. Laser disk, $39.95. 2 hours 6 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Terry Gilliam, the American member of the Monty Python troupe, interpreted and directed this fantastic adventure story about the notorious liar of legend. The baron (John Neville) sails off in a hot-air balloon to find old comrades and do battle against the Ottoman Turks. The film is full of ''moments that dazzle, just for the fun of seeing the impossible come to life on the screen,'' thanks to the cameraman (Giuseppi Rotunno), the production designer (Dante Ferretti) and the creator of special effects (Richard Conway). (Vincent Canby) The Dressmaker 1989. Capitol. $79.95. 1:32. No rating. Nellie (Joan Plowright), a seamstress, and her sister, Margo (Billie Whitelaw), share their grim and tidy little house with their 17-year-old niece, Rita (Jane Horrocks), who falls in love with one of the American servicemen in Liverpool in 1944. A small-scale, exquisitely acted film that is ''constructed as if it were some kind of delayed-action explosive . . . . The images and textures have the density of good prose.'' (Canby) K-9 1989. MCA. $89.95. LD. $34.98. 1:51. CC. PG-13. Dooley (James Belushi) is an unconventional San Diego narcotics officer with a book editor girlfriend (Mel Harris). He is teamed with a new partner, a chili-loving German shepherd named Jerry Lee Lewis, and the two have a number of adventures as they try to bring a drug czar to justice. Although the story ''doesn't have a shred of credibility . . . , with its sure-fire dog tricks and breezy pacing [ it ] is at least mildly diverting.'' (Stephen Holden) See No Evil, Hear No Evil 1989. RCA/Columbia. $89.95. LD. $39.95 1:43. CC. R. Wally (Richard Pryor) is blind, but is so desperate to pass for sighted that he pretends to read the newspaper on the subway. Dave (Gene Wilder) is completely deaf and reads lips. Together they witness a murder; that is, Wally hears the shot and smells the killer's perfume, and David sees her legs. The actors ''have never worked better together,'' and ''the performances remain legitimate even at the wildest farcical moments . . . . It would be difficult to imagine a more benign or entertaining mass-market movie.'' (Canby) Ghostbusters II 1989. RCA/Columbia. $89.95. LD. $24.95 1:42. CC. PG. It is the not wildly improbable premise of this sequel to the 1985 comedy that Manhattan, the angriest place on earth, ''is about to blow, like a frog on a hot plate.'' It's a situation that cries out for the help of the Ghostbusters - Bill Murray and his associates, Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson. Sigourney Weaver again plays a concerned citizen and Peter MacNicol is the devil's new emissary. This is ''a remarkably cheerful film. It has the weight and stylishness of designer toilet tissue, but it doesn't offend.'' (Canby) The Mighty Quinn 1989. CBS/Fox. $89.98. 1:38. R. Xavier Quinn (Denzel Washington) is an island-born, F.B.I.-trained police detective in a Caribbean country who is called in following the grisly murder of a rich American businessman, in which the prime suspect is his boyhood pal, Maubee (Robert Townsend). All is not as it seems, and as the investigation proceeds, political and economic interests come into play. The story ''manages to be lighthearted without being soft in the head.'' And Mr. Washington ''gives the kind of smooth, funny, laid-back performance that could help make him the first black matinee idol since Sidney Poitier.'' (Canby) Gold Diggers of 1935 1935. MGM/ UA. $29.95. 1:36. No Rating. Dick Powell, Adolphe Menjou and Gloria Stuart, in the role usually occupied by Ruby Keeler, star in this generally amusing screen comedy. The Times critic of the day wrote: ''Busby Berkeley, the master of scenic prestidigitation, continues to dazzle the eye and stun the imagination . . . ,'' noting that ''quite the most breathtaking feature is the 'Lullaby of Broadway' number.''",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Getting Even,"Leonard Bernstein apparently felt that if the people in Washington were going to rescind a $10,000 grant to an art show on AIDS, they could keep their National Medal of Arts too. Mr. Bernstein at first refused to comment on why he turned down the chance to be one of 12 recipients of the arts medal this year, but it was generally accepted that he did so in protest of a decision by the National Endowment for the Arts to withdraw support for the AIDS exhibition at the Artists Space gallery in Manhattan. Days later, however, the new chairman of the National Endowment, John E. Frohnmayer, changed his mind and restored the grant - at the urging of members of the National Council on the Arts - with the proviso that it not be used to pay for the show's rather provocative catalogue. Did this mean that Mr. Bernstein could also change his mind and accept the medal? No. It seems that a replacement recipient had already been selected and, as a White House spokesman put it, ''the President is only permitted to give 12 awards a year.'' At the awards ceremony at the White House on Friday, Mr. Frohnmayer obliquely acknowledged the dispute over the AIDS show, saying, ''I feel like John Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs.'' In yesterday's Washington Post, Mr. Bernstein addressed those who would deny support to artistic expression with which they disagree. ''Dear conservatives,'' he wrote, ''What are you conserving? Democracy and human freedom, I should hope.''",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

A most intriguing fact in ''Running Tough'' is that Tony Dorsett has accumulated more rushing yardage than anyone in football history save for the recently retired Walter Payton of the Chicago Bears. as lights on the pantheon go, Mr. Dorsett certainly glimmers far more dimly than many runing backs with lesser statistics, from Jim Brown to Paul Hornung to Gale Sayers, even to contemporaries like Eric Dickerson and John Riggins. Mr. Dorsett, despite his statistics, has never dominated the game as others have. The reason for this, he claims in his autobiography, ''Running Tough,'' is that the Dallas cowboys, the team for which he played the bulk of his career, thwarted him in a variety of ways. In fact, there are so many laments against the Cowboys and humanity in general in ''Running Tough'' that the book could have been subtitled ''Feel Sorry for Me, Because I Sure Do.'' No doubt racism, mendacity and other horrors exist in the National football League and on the Cowboys, but Mr. Dorsett sees it as all directed at him. His career has been dotted by accusations of starting fights in bars and other public places, rumors of a drug investigation and severe financial problems despite a seven-figure contract. ''Running Tough,'' written with the sports journalist Harvey Frommer, portrays Mr. Dorsett as an unwitting victim in nearly every case. He claims persecution because he has been outspoken, but there is little evidence that he has been outspoken about anything other than his own persecution. Mr. Dorsett, who is now n the Denver Broncos' injured list and probably will never play again, makes accusation about the Cowboys organization that are hardly new: that there is a preference for white players over black; the Tom Landry, the team's coach until this year, was distant from his players; the the coaches and excutives preferred team loyalty to individual stardom. But these are traits of almost every football team and, in fact, most American corporations. In addition, ''Running Tough'' is poorly written, done in a trite as-told-to style, lacking any eloquence or direction but for the clanging complaints of its subject.",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,FOOTBALL,"OUT OF BOUNDS. By Jim Brown with Steve Delshon.) Zebra, $17.95.) For most middle-aged sports fans, Jim Brown is professional football's quintessential fullback, an archetypal strongman in an era when the National Football League was more brutal than it is today. As Mr. Brown observes in ''Out of Bounds'': ''Loose rules. Hard men. Not a lot of cash. It made the old NFL a primitive place.'' Of course, Mr. Brown was more than a bruiser. He was ahead of his time in combining power and speed with grace and artful running. He is also one of the few sports legends to have retired virtually at top form. One wonders, after reading his briskly paced autobiography (written with Steve Delshon, the author of several sports books), if he shouldn't have played a little longer. When Mr. Brown retired from football in 1965 at the age of 29, his skills were still awe-inspiring. Perhaps that is why the tone of his narration is often that of a superstar who retires in the prime of life only to be haunted by his image: a living legend with no field to play on. Mr. Brown, now 53, has spent his retirement years meandering about the periphery of society. He has been in and out of Hollywood as an actor. He was a color analyst for CBS Sports - he was fired after a controversial remark about Jimmy (the Greek) Synder - as well as the manager of a singing group and even a one-time magazine centerfold. His autobiography is frank and usually entertaining. For all of the many thought-provoking points Mr. Brown makes - he discusses the need for economic development in the black community, criticizes the modern black athlete for his lack of politcal awareness and gets to the heart of the problem of drugs in sports - ''Out of Bounds'' will be remembered for its spicy accounts of Mr. Brown's sexual exploits. Indeed, long after the memories of his career have faded, what lingers in the memory will be his tossing women out of balconies and occassionally slapping them around. Mr. Brown tackles his image head-on: ''I get the women who are looking for something different.... I've got this public image.... People think I'm the guy who roughs up women, threw one girl off the balcony.... My reputation has also driven away many women.... When that happens with a girl I have high hopes for, it hurts,'' Mr Brown describes the balcony incident. During an altercation with his girlfriend, he says, the police came over and he slammed the door in their faces. He learned later that ''Eva kind of freaked.... She climbed over the top of our balcony, and then fell, and rolled underneath it.'' He also devotes several pages to defending himself agaisnt charges that he and a female companion raped another woman. Those chages were eventually dropped, though the woman still has a civil suit pending. Mr. Brown is candid about his life and revels in the fact that he has lived it his way - from indulging his preference for 19- and 20-year-old women to attacking racism in society and lethargy within the black community. ''I know my lifestye isn't for everyone,'' he writes. ''By no pretending to be a goody-goody, it's actually been easier on me.... And in a sense, I've beaten the game.''",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,MAKING LIKE A RAJAH,"IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS, IT WAS THE MEN WHO GOT to wear the gorgeous stuff. During the heyday of the Mogul era in India, it was the maharajahs who were laden with ropes of pearls and strands of diamonds. Their rings, brooches, belts and sabers dazzled with emeralds and other gems, while thick tassels of pearls and rubies swung against their brocaded robes. Oh, the women wore jewelry, too, but it was much more modest. Naturally, today's women want to imitate the more lavish look. In this period of some pretty excessive fashion statements, imitating a maharajah's booty seems a perfectly normal way to go. Fortunately, this is also a time of prolific costume jewelry production and design. The look can be assembled from a street vendor's tables, or you can move up to the department stores. At Macy's, for instance, a respectably extravagant costume jewelry cache can be acquired for about $500. Add another zero and peruse the glowing cases at such places as Bergdorf Goodman or Kenneth Jay Lane in the Trump Tower. There, one finds such pleasures as cuffs that resemble hammered gold set with half-dollar-sized glass diamonds, collars laden with the same stones and endless ropes of faux pearls. At the very top, of course, is the real thing. Fred Leighton, a Madison Avenue dealer in antique jewelry, is a favorite with women bearing well-known names and plenty of cash. Currently, he is showing a spectacular collection of real Indian gems, many of them from the Mogul era. Here, for, say, $500,000, something very special can be arranged.",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

The flap began last week when a news agency received a note, purportedly from a previously unknown group called the Organization of Just Revenge, claiming that the three had been abducted ''because of their activities in Lebanon.'' The note was accompanied by photocopies of the trio's passports and visas. But Ms. Fahrend and her Lebanese-born West German companion, Munir Sami, turned up at the West German Embassy in Beirut the next day and asked what all the fuss was about. A Government spokesman in Bonn said the two ''could not explain why it was reported that they were kidnapped.'' There was speculation that they had been robbed, but Ms. Fahrend and Mr. Sami were not talking. Meanwhile, State Department officials said they would like to chat with the California woman, who is variously described as a journalist and a poet. A spokeswoman said Ms. Fahrend did not have the necessary special permisssion to enter Lebanon.

us,NONFICTION,"EDUCATION OF A WANDERING MAN. By Louis L'Amour. (Bantam, $16.95.) A few days before his class in Jamestown, N.D., graduated from high school, Louis L'Amour (then Louis LaMoore) sat in a Singapore bar with his shipmates. He had decided that ''school was interfering with my education.'' This intellectual autobiography details the path that L'Amour traveled to become admirably, refreshingly self-educated. Although described as an account of L'Amour's extensive reading by Daniel J. Boorstin in his introduction, ''Education of a Wandering Man,'' conveys far more about the author's exotic travels and the colorful people he learned from, mostly under the austere conditions of his young adult years when he was hungry, alone, believing in himself when no one else did. L'Amour crisscrossed the third world as a sailor, learning about Asian and African cultures. Sometimes he traveled alone, but inevitably he met interesting storytellers to learn from: hobos, retired gunfighters, old cowboys, ancient miners, rugged individualists with names like Old Doc Yak, Singapore Charlie, Russian Joe Smith and Oriental Slim. Yet always he found time to read, and L'Amour lists what he read during the 1930's, averaging more than 100 books a year: eclectic samplings from Edgar Rice Burroughs to Christopher Marlowe, Marcel Proust to Claude McKay. At times officious and pontifical, certainly repetitive in a way that suggests that more revision was planned before L'Amour's death last year, this memoir rises above its tedious moments to provide the same intriguing historical insight that has won praise for the author's fiction. L'Amour's appealing erudition stems from a conviction that history is ''the story of people and how they lived,'' and long before the final page the reader feels more educated for having listened to this piquant chronicler of frontiers one last time.",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Vicenza,"To the Editor: A ''Palladian Journey in Vicenza'' (Travel, Aug. 13) would be incomplete without a tour of the city's Olympic Theater. Palladio's evocation of classical Greco-Roman design was commissioned by fellow members of the Olympic Academy, a civic organization founded in 1556 to promote humanistic thought and cultural activities in Renaissance Vicenza. Although the architect died in 1580, shortly after construction of the theater began, his plans were carried out with some alterations by his son Silla and his pupil Vincenzo Scamozzi. The result is a celebration of the city's intelligentsia and its civic influence. Visitors can see the fascinating trompe-l'oeil background perspectives of an ideal city that Scamozzi designed for the inaugural performance of ''Oedipus Rex'' in March, 1585. Although made of wood, the background is beautifully preserved - in spite of the perils of candle-lit performances and the ravages of time. DONNA S. BLOOM Ithaca, N.Y.",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

This third novel in Susan Howatch's ecclesiastical series (the first two were ''Glittering Images'' and ''Glamorous Powers'') demands so insistently to be taken seriously that - though it flies in the face of good sense - one is left with no choice but to do so. The story of a spiritual crisis, ''Ultimate Prizes'' is narrated by Neville Aysgarth, an ambitious archdeacon in the fictional English diocese of Starbridge. A brilliant administrator with a firm, practical faith in God and the Church of England, Neville has steadily moved up in life by ''chasing the prizes,'' overcoming his humble birth and troubled youth to win for himself a perfect wife, a flock of delightful children and a powerful position, all before age 40. During his climb to success he has kept his mind as tidy as his diocese by relentlessly ''ringing down the curtain'' - a mental curtain, that is - on disturbing memories and desires. But alas for Neville, his curtain is shortly to be twitched off its rod, first by an infatuation with a young society girl, then by a death in his family. Actually it's fun to watch the stodgy Neville's descent into sin, and the society girl is flakily amusing. Unfortunately, the archdeacon hits bottom around page 160, and the society girl's subsequent appearances are limited to brief cameos. The remaining 224 pages detail, in earnest and repetitive prose, the psychological journey that enables Neville finally to confront and make peace with his unhappy early years. During this expedition, Neville discovers that by re-experiencing rather than denying painful childhood emotions, one can free oneself from undesirable compulsive behavior. Ah. Mr. Aysgarth, meet Dr. Freud. I don't think it will be giving anything away to reveal that the true ultimate prizes of life turn out to be faith, hope and love.

Certain that she is the last person on earth, Kate wanders alone through the world's great museums, talking and talking until she self-deconstructs. ''Wittgenstein's Mistress'' is a remarkable technical feat,'' Amy Hempel said here last year. ''It is a novel that can be parsed like a sentence; it is that well made.'' THREE SCIENTISTS AND THEIR GODS: Looking for Meaning in an Age of Information, by Robert Wright. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) ''Personally, I don't like the idea that we're mere specks in a universeJU indifferent to our fates,'' Robert Wright says near the beginning of this book. ''Any hint that life has some meaning, evolution some purpose, would be refreshing.'' And so he sets out on a personal quest, stopping along the way to visit three very introspective scientists, Edward Fredkin, Edward O. Wilson and Kenneth Boulding. Last year The Book Review said the author ''turns his encounters into masterly portraits of three eccentric thinkers [ who invent ] theories so all-encompassing that they serve as the scientists' own personal gods.'' THE GARDEN STATE, by Gary Krist. (Vintage, $7.95.) When these short stories about the stranger aspects of life in the New Jersey suburbs were published last year, our reviewer, Elizabeth Gleick, said Gary Krist ''writes with an honest simplicity and a terrific sense of humor.'' In most of the stories he pays ''such attention to detail and [ has ] such obvious affection for his characters that we get momentarily caught up in new, somewhat absurdist worlds.'' TWO-PART INVENTION: The Story of a Marriage, by Madeleine L'Engle. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) The author of ''A Wrinkle in Time'' tells how she and her husband, the actor Hugh Franklin, collaborated on a marriage that lasted 40 years until his death from cancer in 1986. The story is told in ''a narrative whose painful nature is relieved by intercutting to the full and fulfilling life they led as artists and parents of three children,'' Dan Wakefield said here last year.

A distinguished Japanese novelist sleuths around Tokyo's red-light district, trying to discover how a lewd portrait of him (or of a sinister doppelganger) came to be hanging in a local gallery. Last year The Times's John Gross said the novel is suspenseful and ''extremely gripping.'' THE VIENNESE: Splendor, Twilight, and Exile, by Paul Hofmann. (Anchor/Doubleday, $10.95.) Why does Vienna produce so many great artists and writers, then drive them mad or into exile? Last year our reviewer, Mark Anderson, said this book is ''the most comprehensive, informative and lively introduction to the city currently available, a combination textbook, (veiled) personal memoir and guided tour.'' THE HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS: House Style in the Golden Age of the Movies, by Ethan Mordden. (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, $12.95.) While Paramount was a showcase for directors, allowing them their individual styles, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was dominated by producers and its own cast of well-publicized stars. Last year The Times's John Gross called this book ''an analysis rich in example and anecdote, with excursions on everything from the personality of Irving Thalberg to the cinematic career of Tarzan. . . . Mr. Mordden reflects on the folk values of Fox, the Art Deco sophistication of RKO, and the predominant conservatism of Universal.'' THE PARABLE OF THE BLIND, by Gert Hofmann. Translated by Christopher Middleton. (Fromm International, $7.95.) Six blind men are roused from sleep one morning by an artist who wants to paint a picture that includes ''everything he had to say about the world.'' The result is Bruegel's painting, named, like this novel, ''The Parable of the Blind.'' In 1986 our reviewer, Leigh Hafrey, said, ''There is an earthiness to this book, an immediacy of sensory impression that is enhanced by the continuing, very cerebral meditation on the contradictions of art.'' The publisher has also reissued THE SPECTACLE AT THE TOWER ($8.95), Gert Hofmann's story of a couple whose car breaks down in a remote Sicilian village where sundown is marked by a child's ritual suicide. This is ''a timely introduction to English-speaking readers of an important German novelist,'' Harriet Watts said here in 1984. COURTSHIP IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM, by Mark Jerome Walters. (Anchor/Doubleday, $8.95.) With all the convoluted rigamarole involved in pursuing and attracting mates, some biologists wonder why it wouldn't have been more evolutionarily advantageous for animals to reproduce asexually. ''Mr. Walters uses each colorful case history to illuminate universal patterns in the dance of life, and to raise serious questions,'' Jonathan Weiner said here last year. ''It is clear that the human animal, the snake and the apple tree are part of an experiment that none of them really understands.'' A KILLING KINDNESS, by Reginald Hill. (International Polygonics, $5.95.) Every time the Yorkshire Choker strangles another victim, he calls the local newspaper with a quotation from Hamlet. In 1981 our reviewer, Newgate Callendar, praised Reginald Hill's clearly drawn characters and sophisticated writing. ''The presence of a real writer makes itself felt.'' MARY McCARTHY: A Life, by Carol Gelderman. (St. Martin's, $12.95.) Last year our reviewer, Robert Towers, said the best part of this biography of Mary McCarthy, who died in October, is the story of how she wrote her way into the gang of intellectuals who revived Partisan Review. He called it ''a well-balanced and enjoyable account of a remarkable American life.''",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

The protagonist of Dan Jenkin's highly acclaimed 1972 pro football novel, ''Semi-Tough,''was a hard-drinking, butt-stomping, womanizing country boy named Billy Clyde Puckett, who Mr. Jenkins said was modeled after Alex Hawkins of the Baltimore Colts. Now Mr. Hawkins has come out with an insightful, often funny autobiography focusing on his activities, on and off the field, with the Colts in the 1950's and 1960's. The former running back and wide receiver writes candidly about teammates, opponents and games played during his professional career, including the Colts' bitter loss to the New York Jets in Super Bowl III. However, the strength of ''My Story (and I'm Sticking to It)'' is in Mr. Hawkins's anecdotes and his abiltity to weave in and out of certain disaster. For example, after zeing arrested in an early-morning poker game with a man who had been arrested 33 times, Mr. Hawkins commented, ''When you're up at that time of the night it's tough enough gettng up a game, much less screening the applicants.'' Though not as gifted a storyteller as his teammate Art Donovan was in his 1987 autobiography, ''Fatso,'' Mr Hawkins can nonetheless spin a yarn or two of which even Billy Clyde Puckett would be proud.",1989-11-19T05:00:00+0000

Going beyond theorizing, he has been directly involved with several television dramatizations based on his writings. One, ''Letters From the Park,'' is the most recent presentation on public television's ''Great Performances'' and is being repeated on Channel 13 at 11:30 this evening. On every level, this is indeed quality. The story, offering a variation on ''Cyrano de Bergerac,'' was inspired by a passing mention in Mr. Garcia Marquez's ''Love in the Time of Cholera.'' The screenplay is credited to him with Eliseo Alberto Diego and to Tomas Gutierrez Alea. The co-production of Television Espanola S.A., and the International Network Group S.A., was made in Cuba and directed by Mr. Gutierrez Alea.

Would a closed loop on a hot water line that goes from this tank to the bathroom keep the water in the line hot all the time because of natural circulation, or would the water fail to circulate by itself? A.If the bathroom is definitely higher in elevation than the hot water tank, and if all lines slope that way, you would get a certain amount of natural circulation that would keep the water hot throughout the loop. But in most cases some pipes will slope the wrong way and natural circulation is not enough. That is why with most such installations a small circulation pump is installed near the heater to keep the water moving. Painting a Freezer Q.My chest freezer is kept on an unheated but enclosed back porch, and after several years it is now starting to show rust spots. I would like to repaint the freezer. Can you tell me how to go about it and what type of paint I should use? A.First, using fine-grit emery cloth or aluminum oxide paper, sand the rust spots down to bare metal. Then coat these spots with a rust-resistant metal primer, and allow to dry for 24 hours. Sand the entire surface of the freezer with No. 220 paper, and dust thoroughly, then apply a first coat of enamel undercoat. When this hardens, sand lightly with the same grit paper, then finish with two coats of a top-grade high-gloss exterior enamel. Sand lightly between coats with No. 400 paper. Spraying will give you the smoothest finish if done with a reasonable amount of skill, but using a good brush will also give you a smooth finish if you work carefully to avoid drips and runs and use a good enamel that flows on evenly.",1989-11-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Dining Out Guide: In Chelsea,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current. Chelsea Central ** (Nov. 10, 1989), 227 10th Avenue, at 24th Street (620-0230) - This inviting saloon-style restaurant serves consoling American food. A well-aged steak, cooked precisely to order, comes with fried shallots and potato pancakes. On the seafood side is grilled salmon set over braised leeks with a subtle red-wine sauce. A fine starter is moist crab cakes with remoulade sauce. A fitting finale is a flourless chocolate marquise, rich, semisweet and irresistible. Appetizers are $7 to $9, main courses $14 to $21. Lunch: 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner: 5:30 to 11 P.M. Sunday to Thursday, until midnight Friday and Saturday; Sunday brunch: 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Chelsea Trattoria Italiana ** (Aug. 7, 1987), 108 Eighth Avenue, at 16th Street (924-7786) - This trattoria, with its brick and whitewashed dining room, is friendly and easygoing. Half portions of pastas - a fine way to kick off a meal - include fettuccine tossed with wild mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. A pan-sauteed fillet of beef is superb, tender and juicy. A simple chicken breast sauteed with white wine, mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes is memorable. For dessert, try the strawberry Napoleon. Appetizers are $7 to $8, main courses $13 to $20. Lunch: noon to 3 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner: 5 P.M. to 11:30 Monday to Friday, until midnight Saturday. Eze ** (Oct. 7, 1988), 254 West 23d Street (691-1140) - In this rather formal dining room of a town house, the chef serves beguiling Provencal-Mediterranean cuisine. The frequently changing menu now includes, for appetizers, grilled quail with cranberries and wild rice, and polenta with sausage and sage. A reliable entree is the rack of lamb with a garlic-onion jam. The most impressive seafood entree is the whole braised red snapper for two, moistened with a lemony fish stock and ringed with good couscous and a red pepper puree. An outrageously good dessert is the chocolate cake crowned with caramel ice cream. Dinner prix fixe at $49. Dinner: 6 to 10:15 P.M. Tuesday to Saturday. Periyali ** (May 27, 1988), 35 West 20th Street (463-7890) - This trim and clean whitewashed spot offers down-to-earth Greek food. A standout appetizer is the red-wine-marinated octopus grilled over charcoal. Lamb, naturally, is a highlight among entrees, such as an oregano-dusted leg. Seafood entrees change daily: if you are fortunate, there will be grilled porgies swathed with olive oil. Baklava is a relatively light dessert, made with toasted almonds. Appetizers are $5 to $8, entrees $15 to $20. Lunch: noon to 3 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner: 5:30 to 11 P.M. Monday to Thursday, until 11:30 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Quatorze ** (Feb. 26, 1988), 240 West 14th Street (206-7006) - Quatorze is the sort of place you go to for sustenance, not surprises. . Among the enticing starters are an Armagnac-scented pork-and-chicken terrinewith bacon and pistachios, and marinated herring with onions. A homey entree is the grilled half-chicken with french fries. Grilled fillet of salmon comes with a fine sauce choron (a bearnaise sauce blended with pureed tomatoes). The dessert of choice is the thin, buttery apple tart. Appetizers are $5.50 to $8.50, main courses $16 to $22.50. Lunch: noon to 2:30 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner: 6 to 11:30 P.M. Monday to Saturday, 5:30 to 11 P.M. Sunday.

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Bizet: Symphony in C With Ravel: ''Ma Mere l'Oye,'' ''Pavane Pour une Infante Defunte.'' Scottish Chamber Orchestra conducted by Jukka-Pekka Saraste. Virgin Classics VC 7 90744; CD and cassette. With Prokofiev: Symphony No. 1; Britten: ''Simple Symphony.'' Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Deutsche Grammophon 423 624-2; CD only. The performance standard for the Bizet symphony was set some 50 years ago in a pioneering recording conducted by Walter Goehr, who neatly captured the bubbling good spirits and lively animation of the music. Of the latest entries, the Saraste version reveals more of these qualities than does its rival, and is more vividly recorded. The 33-year-old Finnish conductor also deals lovingly with Ravel's ''Mother Goose'' and ''Pavane.'' Best on the Orpheus release is the Britten symphony, delivered with just the right wit and charm. The Prokofiev performance is stodgy and leaden except for the Gavotte, which manages a bracing elegance. - Martin Bookspan Prokofiev: 'Peter and the Wolf' With Saint-Saens: 'Carnival of the Animals'; Mozart: 'Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.' Academy of London conducted by Richard Stamp; John Gielgud, narrator (''Peter''). Virgin Classics VC 7 90786-2; CD and cassette. With Prokofiev: Symphony No. 1, Violin Concerto No. 1. English String Orchestra conducted by Yehudi Menuhin; Christopher Lee, narrator (''Peter''); Hu Kun, violin (Concerto). Nimbus NI 5192; CD only. If ''Peter and the Wolf'' is the principal consideration, the Virgin Classics is the disk of choice. The American-born Richard Stamp conducts an elegant, witty, charming performance, with razor-sharp playing. Mr. Gielgud's storytelling has a fine sense of the dramatic - though his counterpart, Christopher Lee, is not far behind. But Nimbus's all-Prokofiev disk has other strengths, including the introduction of a 26-year-old Chinese violinist on the brink of a major career. Hu Kun plays with technical assurance, a light but penetrating tone and dead-center intonation. Mr. Menuhin and the English String Orchestra are responsive and sure-footed here and in the ''Classical'' Symphony. The Saint-Saens and Mozart performances on Virgin are less distinguished than the Prokofiev. The tempo in the Mozart finale recalls Beecham's perversely slow one in a recording of a generation ago. - M. B. Einem: Violin Concerto, Transcriptions (Mussorgsky, Schubert) Christiane Edinger, violin; NDR Radio Orchestra (Hannover) conducted by Alfred Walter. Marco Polo 8.223138; CD only. Gottfried von Einem (b. 1918) is an Austrian composer best known for his ability to turn compelling dramas (by Buchner, Kafka, Durrenmatt) into stageworthy but less enduring operas. Highly regarded at home, his works have not traveled well, and the release of his Violin Concerto (1967) is not likely to alter things. It is a highly virtuosic work, lengthy (39 minutes) and constructed with an odd symmetry: two long slow movements framing two short fast ones. The composer does not lack ideas, like a promising dialogue between the solo instrument and bongo drums in the third movement, but rarely makes much of them. His idiom is tonal, with mild dissonances, and his melodies are spun out lyrically but unmemorably. Christiane Edinger, a distinguished artist ignored in the notes, performs laudably; the orchestra does its thankless task diligently, and the recorded sound is adequate. - George Jellinek Brahms: Serenades Nos. 1, 2 London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Istvan Kertesz. London Weekend Classics 421 628-2; CD only. These recordings are dismally transferred, insipidly packaged, inadequately documented and unannotated, but it's great to have them back. Kertesz's First Serenade, from 1968, is a treasure, not because the work is a towering masterpiece (though very near) or the performance flawless (though close enough), but because his manner and temperament suit this limpid music superbly. The piece has come into its own a bit recently, but no recording has rivaled Kertesz's. Alas, London's transfer inflicts an abrupt level shift on the first movement and robs the bass line (and much else) of radiant warmth, most crucially in the slow movement. Still, the disk is inexpensive and will have to serve until London decides to do full justice to this gem. - James R. Oestreich 'A Tribute to Jascha Heifetz' Itzhak Perlman, violin; Samuel Sanders, piano. EMI/Angel 7 49604; CD and cassette. Tuneful, lightweight and showy, encore pieces are the musical counterparts of pickles and jam, and though you can't live on them alone, you can't deny the zing they add to a diet of more substantial fare. Jascha Heifetz, who loved to spice up his recital programs with encore pieces by a wide variety of composers, arranged more than 150 of them for violin and piano, and in this masterly tribute, Itzhak Perlman plays with elegance and panache an engaging selection of 19 of these miniatures ranging from Rameau's ''Rigaudon'' to Manuel Ponce's ''Estrellita'' and Gershwin's ''Three Preludes.'' There's sweetness aplenty here, but honeyed, not saccharine, for the music bespeaks the bracing modernity of Heifetz's own taste - note, for instance, the harmonic touches of Debussy he added to the accompaniment of Saint-Saens's ''The Swan.'' - Barrymore L. Scherer POP/JAZZ The Screaming Blue Messiahs: 'Totally Religious' Elektra 60859; all three formats. ''I woke up this morning/ Bent on destruction,'' Bill Carter yowls to open the third album by the Screaming Blue Messiahs, and for the next 38 minutes his band fills the air with mayhem. Mr. Carter uses his guitar as a blunt instrument, slamming out power chords or leads that sound like tires squealing on a blue highway; behind him, Chris Thompson on bass and Kenny Harris on drums stomp and bash. In Mr. Carter's songs, speed and violence are the only alternatives to self-deception and despair - a brutal world view, but one that makes for savage, vital rock-and-roll. - Jon Pareles Michelle Shocked: 'Captain Swing' Mercury 838-878-2; all three formats. The East Texan folk singer's second solo album is a dramatic change of pace, as she moves from spare acoustic folk into a lusty western swing idiom that shades into rockabilly on some cuts and toward the blues on others. Although it is a big stylistic leap, Ms. Shocked makes it feel perfectly natural. Her new songs, like those on her last album, are wry, feisty little vignettes with a populist political edge. Their blend of humor and social commentary as well as down-to-earth amiability give them much in common with Arlo Guthrie's work. ''God Is a Real Estate Developer'' takes a cheerful swipe at religious pieties, while the bitterly funny ''Streetcorner Ambassador'' compares gatherings of the homeless to diplomatic parleys. Her love songs have the same spirit of irreverent, tomboyish bravado. - Stephen Holden Miles Davis: 'Aura' Columbia 45332; all three formats. Since Miles Davis came out of retirement in the early 1980's, most of his albums have been duds that try to accommodate his trumpet playing to mechanical pop. ''Aura,'' recorded in 1984, is different: Mr. Davis sits in on an orchestral suite that Palle Mikkelborg wrote for him as a tribute. The music is eerie, often dissonant, by turns furious, brassy, choppy, floating; it provides windswept, wide-open spaces for trumpet ruminations. Freed by the compositions and nudged by John McLaughlin's electric guitar solos, Mr. Davis once again sounds like his music matters. - J. P. The Pastels: 'Sittin' Pretty' Homestead 144; all three formats. The Pastels, from Scotland, take a basically lazy approach to playing and writing rock and roll. They just plug in their electric guitars, turn up the distortion and barrel through punk-edged pop songs built on repeated riffs that bury Stephen Pastels's petulant vocals (and even the drums) in the fuzz-tone. ''Sittin' Pretty,'' their second album, has melodies as simple as nursery rhymes, cut to shreds by brazen, bullying guitar solos. But if the Pastels are bored with rock's inability to change the world, their brute-force passion is a slap in the face of acknowledged limitations. - Karen Schoemer",1989-11-26T05:00:00+0000

Caetano Veloso's ''Estrangeiro'' (Elektra/Musician 60898) is a collaboration between a great Brazilian songwriter and the New York-based Ambitious Lovers, its producers; it brings a hint of North American noise to his supple melodies. ''Poi Dog Pondering'' (Columbia 45335), founded in Hawaii and now based in Austin, Tex., turns pop, rock and Caribbean music into a kind of post-modern skiffle with an irrepressible, unforced optimism.

us,New & Noteworthy,"OF SUCH SMALL DIFFERENCES, by Joanne Greenberg. (Signet/New American Library, $4.50.) John Moon, a young poet who is both deaf and blind, falls in love with an actress. As in her earlier book ''I Never Promised You a Rose Garden'' (written under the name Hannah Green), Joanne Greenberg ''calls attention to the slow, painful movement that charts our struggles from isolation toward connectedness,'' Richard Perry said here last year. PARTING THE WATERS: America in the King Years 1954-63, by Taylor Branch. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.95.) In his Pulitzer Prize-winning historyJU of the civil rights movement, Taylor Branch tells how J. Edgar Hoover persuaded Robert Kennedy to let him tap Martin Luther King's telephone by agreeing to keep quiet about President John F. Kennedy's affair with a suspected spy. ''Mr. Branch's wide-ranging search into the details of King's life converges with the onrushing tide that swept up both King and country for a few years of concentrated time,'' Eleanor Holmes Norton said in The Book Review in 1988. ''Mr. Branch, with painstaking research, has reached into the crevices where much of the change occurred. There he has found human dramas of heroism and pettiness, of determination and bewilderment.'' THE RISK POOL, by Richard Russo. (Vintage, $8.95.) When it is time for college, Ned Hall chooses a school as far as possible from his hometown of Mohawk in upstate New York, where his father is a drunk and his mother is strung out on Librium. ''This is a superbly original, maliciously funny book, peopled by characters that most of us would back away from plenty fast if they ever lurched toward our barstool,'' Jack Sullivan said here last year. Vintage has also republished Mr. Russo's first novel, MOHAWK ($8.95), about life in the same dying town. In 1986 The Times's Michiko Kakutani said the story ''has the lonely, melancholy feel of an Edward Hopper painting come to life.'' ABRAHAM LINCOLN: A Press Portrait, edited by Herbert Mitgang. (University of Georgia, $17.95.) Drawing from articles in nearly 100 newspapers and magazines, a New York Times reporter assembled an account of Abraham Lincoln's career as seen through the eyes of reporters. The same publisher has reissued two other journalistic views of Lincoln and his time, also edited by Herbert Mitgang. WASHINGTON, D.C., IN LINCOLN'S TIME ($14.95) is based on the observations of Noah Brooks, who used his friendship with the President to gain entry to the White House. In SPECTATOR OF AMERICA ($14.95), a British journalist, Edward Dicey, tells about a six-month swing through the country during the Civil War. When these books were published as a set in 1971, our reviewer, Gerald Carson, said they ''illuminate as only contemporary writings can the character of Lincoln and his America.'' THE KING OF THE FIELDS, by Isaac Bashevis Singer. (Plume/New American Library, $8.95.) In prehistoric Poland, the Lesniks, a tribe of cave-dwelling hunters and gatherers, fight the farmers, who call themselves Poles after pola, the word for field. Last year our reviewer, Ewa Kuryluk, called this ''a truly absurd fairy tale of sex and violence. . . . The strength of I. B. Singer's novel comes from the language.'' RACIAL HYGIENE: Medicine Under the Nazis, by Robert Proctor. (Harvard University, $14.95.) Defining Nazism as applied biology, the scientists and doctors of the Third Reich set out to cure the German ''folk body'' of people they considered infestations. ''Mr. Proctor's carefully argued book not only forces us to reassess the dynamics of Nazism but also challenges pervasive notions about the political neutrality and objective value of science and the moral innocence of scientists,'' Mary Nolan said in The Book Review last year. THOUGHT REFORM AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TOTALISM: A Study of ''Brainwashing'' in China, by Robert Jay Lifton. (University of North Carolina, $14.95.) In a new introduction to his case studies about victims of Chinese ''thought reform,'' Robert Jay Lifton says the lessons can be applied to American religious cults. In 1961 our reviewer, C. M. Wilbur, predicted that the book would become ''a classic in social-science literature because the problems with which it deals so well extend far beyond . . . China in the early 1950's.'' THE ELEPHANT AND MY JEWISH PROBLEM: Selected Stories and Journals 1957-1987, by Hugh Nissenson. (Edward Burlingame/Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) In a collection of short pieces, some fictional, some true, Hugh Nissenson writes about the difficulties of believing in a God who created such a messy world. Mr. Nissenson's prose ''often serves to heighten the emotional and physical violence it describes,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times last year. AMERICA OBSERVED: From the 1940s to the 1980s, by Alistair Cooke. Edited by Ronald A. Wells. (Collier/Macmillan, $8.95.) Alistair Cooke's essays give a British perspective on the Watts riots, Frank Lloyd Wright, Chappaquiddick and other American topics. ''The subjects are often the ones you would expect, but the pictures themselves . . . are usually taken from an angle that is all the more revealing for being idiosyncratic,'' John Gross said in The Times last year. THE OLD CAPITAL, by Yasunari Kawabata. Translated by J. Martin Holman. (North Point, $8.95.) A young Japanese woman learns that as an infant she was left on the doorstep of the man she now considers her father, a kimono maker in Kyoto. In 1987 our reviewer, Mary Jo Salter, said this novel would be most appreciated by readers already familiar with the Nobel Prize-winning author's other work, which includes ''A Thousand Cranes'' and ''Snow Country.''",1989-11-26T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THE PARADISE MOTEL. By Eric McCormack. (Viking, $17.95.) Eric McCormack's brilliant and unsettling first novel steeps itself in mystery, horror and suspense to tell a story about the very art of storytelling. Each character in ''The Paradise Motel'' is a teller of tales, which makes them all liars, and no one's words are to be trusted. As one of these fabulists puts it, words are the most dangerous weapons: ''They penetrate, like skewers, and they can kill.'' Ezra Stevenson is not so much the narrator of the events as the gatherer of the tales, the keeper of the weapons. He receives this calling from his grandfather, who delivers on his deathbed a gruesome story of domestic violence in which four young children are hideously victimized. Feeling compelled either to verify or to disprove the appalling facts of the case, Ezra embarks on a mythic journey to faraway lands, searching for the lost children and finding, instead, more stories and more storytellers. From such mysterious characters as Dr. Yerdeli of the Institute for the Lost and an ''intellectual boxer'' named Pablo Renowsky, Ezra hears poisonous anecdotes about murder, suicide, torture, self-immolation, sadism and ecstasy. In the end, it is the shapers of these stories who become the true subjects of the novel, and it is these poets of the perverse who suffer most from their own creations. The reader should not be surprised, then, that when Ezra finally finds the lost children of the original story, their meeting at the ironically named Paradise Motel becomes the storyteller's ultimate nightmare.",1989-11-26T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Mays, whose wife died of cancer in 1981, broke his silence on the issue last week, saying that when he told Kimberly of the test results, ''She said, 'Daddy, daddy, what does this mean?' '' It meant that Kimberly was born to Ernest and Regina Twigg of Sebring, Fla., in the same hospital where, three days earlier, Mrs. Mays also gave birth to a daughter. Just before the child they reared died of heart failure last year, the Twiggs learned through blood tests that she was not theirs. They contended that the hospital had switched babies. Mr. Mays consented to the genetic tests provided that the Twiggs agree not to seek custody. Now, he said, ''It's over. It's time for both sides to just think of her.''",1989-11-26T05:00:00+0000

I wish this book had been available when my son came home from kindergarten last year, eagerly starting stories with the invented spelling he had learned through his school's ''Writing to Read'' program. Despite my professional writing credentials and parental desire to see him enjoy writing as much as I do, in my compulsion to ''correct'' spelling and grammar I reacted like the benighted parents and educators Arlene Silberman indicts in her provocative and important new book. At a time when the national educational agenda has increasingly focused on why Johnny can't write, Ms. Silberman, an education writer, explores the observation that while most children come into this world eager to write and tell stories, by the time they have gone through elementary school that delight has disappeared. All too often, she argues, the writing product has been emphasized at the cost of the writing process. And in the collective zeal to restore ''basics'' in the nation's schools, too many teachers have used the emphasis on the writing product as a straitjacket to stifle children's creativity, rather than as a tool to provoke self-expression. ''Even these well-meaning teachers make the mistake of emphasizing early basic skills at the expense of encouraging ideas,'' writes Ms. Silberman. In ''Growing Up Writing,'' which is based on her extensive journeys through the country's classrooms, Ms. Silberman offers examples of innovative solutions to the problem of getting children to write, and to enjoy writing, from kindergarten through high school. Some of it shows up in ''writing across the curriculum'' programs, in which writing is as much a part of a mathematics or science class as of composition or English literature. It's encouraging to hear about teachers who willingly read through many drafts of student papers; students who eagerly dispatch letters to younger classes; and parents who recognize that they have a fundamental role to play at school as well as at home. Ms. Silberman argues that parents are the most important ''writing educators'' their offspring will ever have. This role goes beyond reading aloud or talking with children. Whether it's letting a child sort through junk mail, paint and draw, take down phone messages, draft memos to other family members or write out grocery lists, the writing process can - and should - be easily incorporated into daily life. ''Growing Up Writing'' should be required reading for new parents, along with Benjamin Spock and T. Berry Brazelton, and certainly will be included in the basket of books I routinely send to friends upon the birth of a first child.",1989-11-26T05:00:00+0000
us,FICTION,"EARTHLY REMAINS. By Peter Hernon. (Birch Lane/Carol Publishing, $18.95.) In 1947, the British were pulling out of Palestine, leaving the region's Jews, in their struggle to create an independent state of Israel, to fight the Arabs. At the same time, a startling discovery of a group of ancient scrolls was made by a band of Bedouin tribesmen in a cave located in Trans-Jordan, little more than a stone's throw from the Dead Sea. This much is fact, and it is from here that the journalist Peter Hernon has let his imagination take over - the result of which is a fascinating ''what if?'' novel. What if other scrolls were also found, also written by the Essenes, ''an obscure Jewish sect that was thought to have first existed in Palestine some two hundred years before Christ''? And what if, along with these scrolls, two other discoveries were made: the skeleton of a headless man, suspected to be John the Baptist, and the mummified corpse of a crucified man who might be Jesus Christ? Paul Davoren, a journalist assigned to cover the war, finds himself sucked into a thrilling theological treasure hunt and detective story, the ramifications of which could shake the foundations of modern Christianity. The risks in a novel like this are many. Fortunately, Mr. Hernon is not just a skillful storyteller; his eye for detail and the clever way he entwines fact and fiction do not allow the reader to doubt his premise. Mr. Hernon only falters infrequently, with love scenes between Davoren and a beautiful young scholar that fall rather flat - and at the end, when his tale turns into a more conventional thriller. Otherwise, ''Earthly Remains'' is a well-written, exciting and thought-provoking novel.",1989-11-26T05:00:00+0000

Schneider, who won 14 times last year, negotiated the 427-meter course at the Park City Ski Area in 47.77 seconds on her first run and in 46.88 on her second for a total of 1:34.65. She easily beat Monika Maierhofer of Austria, who was timed in 1:35.97. The Austrian team took the next three places and placed six skiers among the top 10 finishers. Kristi Terzian of Salt Lake City was the leading American, placing seventh in 1:37.03.(AP) Cross-Country Pennsylvanians Northeast Winners: Mike McWilliams and Carole Zajac, both of Pennsylvania, outraced opponents from 11 states to win the boys and girls races yesterday at the Kinney High School Northeast Regional cross-country championships at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. McWilliams, a senior from Grove City, ran 15 minutes 49.9 seconds on the snow-covered, 5,000-meter course to triumph by 20 yards over Mike Going of Wheatley High in Old Westbury, L.I. Zajac, a senior from Baldwin High in Pittsburgh, ran 18:17.8 to win by 150 yards. The top eight finishers in each race earned berths to the Kinney national championships Dec. 9 in San Diego.

Golf Strange Sinks $60,000 Birdie: Curtis Strange, shut out for 22 holes over two years, broke through with a $60,000 birdie putt yesterday in the first nine holes of golf's Skins Game at La Quinta, Calif. ''It wasn't anything fantastic, but it was nice to get that first one,'' Strange said after his six-foot putt found the cup on the fifth hole at the Stadium Club at PGA West. That putt, which followed a five-minute delay while some television equipment was repaired, made him the big winner over the first nine holes of the two-day, 18-hole event. Jack Nicklaus, who has played in all seven Skins Games, won two holes worth a total of $55,000 and Ray Floyd, the big winner last year with $290,000, won $25,000. Lee Trevino was shut out and $25,000 was left on the table when the ninth hole was halved. That money will be carried over to today's play, when $310,000 will at stake.

This is most assuredly not the London of Christopher Wren or of John Nash. Nor is it the London of Prince Charles, who has made it clear that he expects this huge tower to be a desecration of the city's skyline. If it is anything, Canary Wharf is really the London of Margaret Thatcher. The whole of this vast project is not due to be finished until the end of the century. It will fill the central section of the Isle of Dogs, an industrial peninsula along the Thames opposite Greenich, two and a half miles east of the City of London, the old, dense square mile that has served as London's financial center for hundreds of years. But its first phase, which includes the central tower, six other office buildings, a train station and retail space, is expected to be finished at the end of 1990. Right now the site is filled with dozens of construction cranes, and there is no place that more clearly exemplifies the changing nature of London: Canary Wharf is an American-style development, on the scale of American rather than European cities, designed mainly by American architects and built by a Toronto development firm, Olympia & York, that is best known for such huge American projects as the World Financial Center at Battery Park City.",1989-11-26T05:00:00+0000

This thoughtful and provocative book is much better than its title suggests. Mr. Ekman, a research psychologist, has spent years studying the phenomenon of truth and its distortion, and he's taken all that he's learned and applied it to young people learning to be adults and to the parents struggling to help them. What makes this work especially valuable is Mr. Ekman's decision to travel beyond the behavioral aspect of lying to the larger questions that plague us all, especially in these post-Watergate days. In simple and clear prose, Mr. Ekman deals with the function of the less-than-true, the fear and anxiety that generate lies, and the reasons why our culture sometimes supports that fear instead of the truth. He's also remarkably helpful in offering methods for dealing with a child who lies. The basic respect for children that informs this whole book is reflected especially well in Mr. Ekman's decision to invite his stepson, Tom, to write a chapter. At the age of 14, the boy is a perceptive and forthcoming spokesman. Describing a crisis in his own life, one dealt with by his stepfather in an earlier chapter, Tom is able to give the reader insights into his transgression and into his parents' choice of punishment. He is also refreshingly candid in his support of punishment for lying, and in his suggestion that parents continue ''lecturing your kid on what is right and wrong. . . . Although many kids in America are going to hate me for saying this, the truth of the matter is that repeated lecturing does work and is effective.'' Once again the old saws about structure and expectations are borne out by this perceptive young man, and provide an effective center to his stepfather's compassionate examination of truth and lying in children. ''The main difference in the way that my parents and I saw the lie,'' he reports ''lay in the loss of trust.'' It is to Mr. Ekman's credit that his book also reminds us that these issues are still, even at the end of the hypercynical 80's, worthy of consideration.",1989-11-26T05:00:00+0000

In this richly detailed book, Peter Watson traces the painting's remarkable existence through four turbulent centuries and illustrates the major developments in the collecting of old masters since the Renaissance. The painting's owners have included the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II; Sweden's Queen Christina, who stunned 17th-century Europe with her abdication and conversion to Roman Catholicism; and Philippe Egalite of the French house of Bourbon-Orleans, whose political aspirations ended on the guillotine. It was looted from Prague amid the wholesale despoliation of art in the Thirty Years' War and later, during the French Revolution, found its way to England as the ancien regime sought to shift assets to safety in that country and elsewhere. Finally, ''An Allegory of Wisdom and Strength'' crossed the Atlantic along with other great works when rich American industrialists, including the Pittsburgh coke and steel baron Henry Clay Frick, formed their collections, beginning in the late 19th century. Mr. Watson, who writes about art for The Observer of London, has a flair for drama and is fascinated with the exotic milieus in which artists have so often thrived. ''Wisdom and Strength'' will bring pleasure to anyone even remotely interested in art and art collecting in the period.",1989-11-26T05:00:00+0000

It's hard to imagine a more well-intentioned book. Erma Bombeck has put her considerable talent as a humorist in the service of changing people's attitudes toward children with cancer. Banishing pity and pessimism, she takes a look at the light, triumphant side of fighting the disease. Ms. Bombeck undertook ''I Want to Grow Hair, I Want to Grow Up, I Want to Go to Boise'' on the urging of a cancer camp director who hoped it would help combat the isolation felt by young cancer patients and their families. The royalties will be donated to support cancer research. Though her motives are laudable, the uncomfortable truth is that Ms. Bombeck is in over her head. Having interviewed many children who are surviving cancer, she struggles valiantly to convey their plucky insights. But she isn't able to build a narrative or even tell a sustained anecdote, and her customary shtick is simply not equal to the task. The few laugh-out-loud lines in the book tend to be about kids as kids, not about children battling cancer.",1989-11-26T05:00:00+0000

Klement Gottwald, a party leader, heads the coalition Government and Eduard Benes, a non-Communist and President before and immediately after World War II, is re-elected President. 1948: The Communists force the resignation of Mr. Benes and Mr. Gottwald becomes President. Jan Masaryk, the Foreign Minister and son of the country's chief founder, dies in Prague under mysterious circumstances. A People's Republic is established in June. 1950: A Communist Party purge, seeking Stalinist ideological purity, brings the dismissal and, two years later, the execution of Vladimir Clementis, the Foreign Minister. Executed with him as anti-state conspirators are 10 other high party officials, most of them Jewish, including Rudolf Slansky. 1967: Demands grow, particularly among students and the intelligentsia, for a higher standard of living, greater personal freedom and an end to the police state. January 1968: Alexander Dubcek replaces Antonin Novotny as First Secretary of the Communist Party. The period known as Prague Spring, or ''socialism with a human face,'' begins. The Soviet Union expresses deep misgivings about liberal tendencies in Czechoslovakia. August 1968: The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies invade Czechoslovakia. Mr. Dubcek is stripped of power and a year later is formally deposed as party chief. He is succeeded by hard-liners led by Gustav Husak. January 1977: Intellectual dissent erupts again with the signing of Charter 77, in which members of the intelligentsia air grievances against the Government of Mr. Husak, who became President in 1975. The Government cracks down harshly on the dissenters. December 1987: Mr. Husak keeps the largely ceremonial post of President but resigns as General Secretary of the party and is replaced in that post by Milos Jakes. Nov. 12, 1989: Amid the political turmoil sweeping Eastern Europe, Jakes tells a Communist youth conference that the party will not tolerate street protests or relax control of the country. Nov. 17: In the largest anti-Government rally since 1968, tens of thousands of demonstrators take to the streets. The protest is crushed. Nov. 19: Tens of thousands of Prague protesters denounce police brutality. Opposition groups, including some Communist allies, coalesce into the new Civic Forum and demand the resignations of the leaders responsible for the 1968 invasion. Nov. 20: Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in Prague demand free elections and the resignations of the hard-line Communist leaders. Protests also break out in other cities. Nov. 24: The Communist leadership, headed by Mr. Jakes, resigns and Karel Urbanek, a little-known party official, replaces him as General Secretary of the party.

But the Soviet leader, angry after his country sights and downs an American U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union, cancels the meeting. June 1961: Khrushchev and President Kennedy have heated exchanges in Vienna. There are no formal agreements. A year later, the Soviets send nuclear missiles to Cuba; the United States forces their removal. June 1967: President Johnson meets in Glasboro, N.J. with Alesksei N. Kosygin to discuss the Middle East, the Vietnam War and nuclear arms. They come to no terms on those issues. may 1972: President Nixon and Leonid I. Brezhnev, in Moscow, sign the first treaties setting limits on strategic nuclear arms, known as SALT I, and on curbing anti-ballistic missile systems. They agree to keep negotiating on arms, but regional issues divide them. June 1973: Nixon and Brezhnev meet in Washington. They agree to try to complete a new arms treaty by 1974. June-July 1974: Nixon and Brezhnev meet in Moscow and Yalta. They agree to a treaty banning underground nuclear-arms tests with yields exceeding 150 kilotons, and they arrange a 10-year economic accord. November 1974: President Ford and Brezhnev, in Vladivostok, reach a tentative deal limiting missile launchers and bombers and lay a base for a second strategic arms treaty. The treaty is not completed before President Carter takes office. June 1979: Carter and Brezhnev, in Vienna, sign the second treaty limiting strategic arms, or SALT II. Although the Senate never approves the treaty because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December of 1979, both sides agree informally to observe the limits. November 1985: President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet in Geneva for wide-ranging talks on arms control and other subjects. They agree to revive cultural exchanges and to enhance air safety, but no arms-control agreements are acheived. October 1986: Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Reykjavik, Iceland, to provide momemtum to arms-control talks. The two sides speak of vast cuts in strategic arms and medium-range missiles, but the accord falls through because of disagreements over the American plan for a space-based missile defense system, or Star Wars, and over Moscow's insistence on putting all arms issues in one package. December 1987: Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Washington. They sign a treaty to destroy intermediate-range nuclear forces, known as I.N.F., and agree to seek a treaty cutting long-range nuclear arsenals.
