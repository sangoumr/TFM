He is now professor of drama at Cambridge University. Skilled in the discrimination of borders and hinterlands, he is particularly concerned with the interaction of ideas, values and attitudes in social life. As a teacher, he loves to show where ideas begin and end, in principle, only to emphasize that in practice their beginnings and endings are incorrigibly wayward. It is congenial to him to demonstrate that ideas have consequences. In his major books, Culture and Society (1958), The Long Revolution (1961) and The Country and the City (1973), Williams has been writing the social and cultural history of England, and now in Keywords he proposes to show how that history is disclosed in the way certain words have come to be used. Keywords, he says, is not a dictionary or glossary of a particular academic subject, it is not a series of footnotes to dictionary histories or definitions of a number of words; it is, rather, the record of an inquiry into a vocabulary, a shared body of words and meanings in our most general discussions, in English, of the practices and institutions which we group as culture and society.",1976-05-02T05:00:00+0000

Her 8-year-old son wets his bed, and her best friend has an annoying habit of wandering away from the telephone when Bissie is in the midst of one of her non-stop, free-association phone calls about her weight, her Japanese gardener or some other self-absorbed topic.When Bissie calls Her analyst to describe her latest suicide fantasy, the analyst, apparently bored, suggests that she keep busy,Bissie tries, God knows she tries. In the day in the life of Bissie Hapgood conered by ""Legacy."" which opened yesterday at the ???n ema Studio, Bissie makes preparations for a formal dinner party.Busy-ness, however. leads directly to disaster when she finds that she is missing one sterling silver butter knite. Not only has Black, Starr & Gorham discontinued the pattern, there is no longer any Black, Starr & Gorham. Which is enough to send a woman as obsessed with trivia as Bissie is over the edge into lunacy.""Legacy,' which was directed and produced by Karen Arthur (her first feature) and written by Joan Hotchkis, who also plays Bissie is a most peculiar sort of movie but not, a very good one. It also seems uncommonly cruel for a film about a woman made by women. It might. I think, have made a very funny movie if Miss Hotchkis had allowed herself the grace of humor, which is another way of saying compassion, instead of treating Bissie as a foolish, four-star nut.Bissie has problems, and they are real ones, but ""Legacy"" only catalogues them without making them seem important or moving. Miss Hotchkis, the actress as well as the writer, displays some talent, for satire and none at all for comedy or drama.The form of the film doesn't help. ""Legacy"" is said to be based on a play by Miss Hotchkis, which I suspect actually to have been the kind of Ruth Draperish monologue that is best delivered from a lecture platform.Although we do see Bissie's mother briefly (in the film's only arresting sequence) and Bissie's husband and children (in short flashbacks). ""Legacy"" is still a one-woman move. a 90-minute monologue that might easily have been reduced to a quarter of an hour Nothing that either Miss Hotchkis or Miss Arthur does can disguise the awkwardness and artificiality of this monologue form, which finally destroys any serious thoughts the film makers might have about women, the bourgeoisie, sex, America and the difficulty of getting good domestic help in Southern California.Eventually, the whole thing comes to look like an act of immense vanity.",1976-05-03T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Birch Interval,' Tale About Children","There is no possible way to make a good movie about??? children if you don't know how to direct children. This is the main reason why ""Birch Interval???"" instead of being a sentimental but effective film about, growing-up pains in bucolic America, on the order of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" is a painful embarrassment.Directing children, essentially, is telling them what not to do. They shouldn't??? in fact, do anything??? they should simply be. They certainly shouldn't act. Children's faces are totally revealing and the camera is terribly sharp??? when a child is allowed to act, what we get on the screen is not a child but a child acting.The central figure in ""Birch Interval???"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse??? is a child named Jesse. She is sent to stay with her grandfather's family in the Amish country of Pennsylvania. It is all love and peacefulness, but there are conflict and tragedy underneath.Her beloved Uncle Thomas??? a fey eccentric married to a perplexed and unfaithful wife??? is manhandled off to an asylum, where he dies. Her grandfather??? whom she adores, shows unexpected weakness in letting it happen. Her Amish friends are harassed by the government for not sending their children to school. The neighborhood holds a witch, a mad girl, a band of sadistic children.The story of a preadolescent girl learning pain and forbearance among the green hills and red barns might have worked, if done with skill and restraint. But there is nothing but excess, self-indulgence and bathos.Susan McLung, who plays Jesse, is thin and freckled, with a hungry look and expressive dark eyes. She looks fine??? but she is never real. She is a catalogue of gestures and expressions.She pushes her mouth in and out to depict tenderness??? Anger??? grief. She doesn't walk: she strides. Her uncle and grandfather sit on the porch and talk life to her??? she assumes an expression of hostessy understanding. There's nothing she doesn't: hear, register and react to. What happened to the painfully won dscovery by American directors???the Europeans always knew it???that children look blank most of the time?The dialogue doesn't help. In quick succession. Jesse has to announce that her uncle, her grandfather and the community of Birch Interval are ""the best (uncle/grandfather/place) in the whole world."" Her grandfather???played like a wet sunset by Eddie Albert???tells her. ""Life is just a bit of eiderdown and a bit of mealy apple.""The photography does some lovely things???there is a good shot of Amish wagons crookedly lined up in the mist???but the loveliness is as excessive as everything else. The camera??? almost as ""self-conscious as Miss M???Clung??? reacts???it all but double-takes??? in fact???to every pretty thing it shows.""Birch Interval"" is what the word ""icky"" has been waiting for all its life. Nobody who sees the film will ever be able to condescend to ""icky"" again??? it rises from cant to lexi???ographical indispensability.",1976-05-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Mindless Drugs:Tranquilizers for Disturbed Patients Are Scored in Documentary at Whitney,"""Hurry Tomorrow"" which opened a week's run yesterday at the Whitney Museum, is a spare, angry documentary feature about the use of various kinds of tranquilizing drugs in the treatment of disturbed patients in a men's ward at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, Calif. It is a drama of particulars, of individual patients and individual doctors, and it is enough to make you swear off anything stronger than warm milk forever.The point of the film makers, Richard Cohen (director and editor) and Kevin Rafferty (chief camerman and assistant editor), is clearly stated within the film by a former patient, a member of an organization called the Network Against Psychiatric Abuse, who sees the administration of any drugs, without the consent of the patient, to be a violation of the body equivalent to rape.This is putting the film makers' case much less emotionally than the film itself does. Though ""Hurry Tomorrow"" has some technical deficiencies, which are understandable considering the conditions under which it was made, it is an agonizing, involving spectacle to watch, with more bitterness and outrage in any three-minute sequence than in all of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.""With the apparent cooperation of the ward's chief doctor, a man who seems so arrogant, vain, self-assured and high on himself that he doesn't realize what sort of film is being made, the cameramen wander the clean but miserably barren halls of the ward, picking up the stories of the patients, some of whom seem much less neurotic than the people treating them.We watch a young black man being badgered by the doctor, who notes that the patient has a peculiar way of getting angry when he is either hungry or locked up. The patient agrees, ""Sometimes you sound just a bit grandiose,"" says the doctor. ""What's grandiose?"" says the patient helplessly, which seems to please the doctor. ""I want to go home,"" the young man says. The patient will go home, the doctor tells the film makers, only when he stops asking towhich is this doctor's catch-22.The film makers attend a get-together of drug salesmen and the doctors where a representative of one company announces fatuously: ""No more napalm. We're out of the war business and into the health business."" The health business, as the representative of Network Against Psychiatrist Abuse tells us, includes the pushing of tranquilizing drugs that turn patients into zombies, which we see, and that have such possible side effects as dizziness, liver damage and cardiac arrest, which are listed on the drugs themselves.Nevertheless some things about ""Hurry Tomorrow"" bother me. The doctor may well be a first-class creep, but the film makers nudge him along. As he is answering one of their qestions, the camera pans to one side to show us his two Siamese cats lying on a bench covered with imitation leopard skin. What does that tell us? That he's a fur fetishist? His pseudohip jargon is bad enough, we don't have to have a scene in which he proudly shows us his car and the California license plate. MAGIAN, which, he explains, was his second choice. after MAGI. At another point the cameraman, who is never acknowledged by the film, seems to be locked up in solitary with a patient who is being punished.A documentary always has a point of view, sometimes called a bias, and there is nothing wrong with that as long as it is admitted. ""Hurry Tomorrow"" makes its feelings so apparent, and raises so many important questions, it doesn't need to overstate the nuttiness of the doctor, nor to convince us its cameraman was somehow locked up for hours with a single patient These are small points, but a documentary as good as this one must be above such things.",1976-05-05T05:00:00+0000

us,'Breakheart Pass' Is Good Fun Film,"Either Charles Bronson's movies are getting better or my resistance has worn out. Last year a string of unremarkable but immensely popular Bronson movies was suddenly made interesting with the appearance of ""Hard Times,"" a terse, tough, unsentimental melodrama directed by Walter Hill.This year we have ""Breakheart Pass,"" a western written by Alistair MacLean and directed by Tom Gries. In between there have been other forgettable items. Though ""Breakheart Pass"" is not ""The Great Train Robbery,"" it's a highly efficient entertainment of the sort sometimes labeled escapist, a general use of the word that doesn't recognize who's doing the escaping or what's being escaped from. For someone working in a Manhattan laundry, The New York Review of Books could be a month in the country.""Breakheart Pass,"" which opened yesterday at the Guild and other theaters, is a western that spends a lot of its time inside a train, a fine smoky antique snaking its way through the snowy mountains of Utah to a date with a destiny that includes outlaws and angry Indians. The time is the virtually mythical 1870's (as someone once wrote, all westerns are set in 1870) and the MacLean story is about gunrunning and a cache of gold.Time and place require that ""Breakheart Pass"" be described as a western, though it also contains a few elements that might have been suggested by a close reading of ""Murder on the Orient Express."" Purists may object to this crossbreeding of genres, but the result is good fun with some spectacular action footage directed by Yakima Canutt, the Hollywood stunt genius who is still playing with dynamite and rolling entire trains off trestles in his 81st year.The train on which most of the action is set is a special being sent to the relief of a remote mountain fort in the grip of a diphtheria epidemic. On board are a detachment of soldiers, a governor, the daughter of the fort's commander (didn't they ever have sons?), an old-timey sort of Western sheriff (played by Ben Johnson), the train's cook, who's no better than he cooks (played by Archie Moore) and a mysterious outlaw, a former university lecturer in medicine who's wanted for everything, arson and murder and probably parking tickets.This fellow, played by Mr. Bronson, seems already to have passed through his own time into history. The great physique is no longer young, but it is more powerful than ever, as if transfused by age with some kind of supervigor that affects brain as well as brawn. Needless to say, he is the film's hero-figure, but how he assumes the role is the point of the screenplay's twists that owe more to Agatha Christie than to Zane Grey.Mr. Gries, who some years ago directed ""Will Penny,"" a very different kind of western that attempted to recreate a feel for frontier time and place, doesn't permit these mystery-story elements to slow down the film's physical action. ""Breakheart Pass"" moves, therefore it is.The movie is rated PG, in reference, I suppose, to a couple of fight scenes, and one murder that might possibly upset a very young child who's never had a chance to watch prime-time TV.",1976-05-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Baby Blue Marine' Is Apple Pie,"""Baby Blue Marine,"" the first film to be directed by John Hancock since his moving and funny ""Bang the Drum Slowly,"" has the tensile strength of a rubber hot dog.It's the tastelessly sentimental story of a nice young man named Marion (Jan-Michael Vincent), who, in 1943, has the humiliation of being washed out of a Marine Corps boot camp, for not measuring up, though he's as pretty as a picture of a Norman Rockwell World War II fighting man. Through a series of circumstances too silly to describe, he finds himself hitchhiking home to St. Louis wearing the uniform of a Marine Raider, whose battle ribbons dazzle the folks he meets along the way.Marion has particular success in a small California town that is so idyllically (and mysteriously) set that no matter where you look you see Mount Shasta in the distance. There he meets a family (Mom, Pop, the pretty daughter and her young brother who always has the sniffles) so apple-pie American that one longs for this to be a Hitchcock film, which might mean the family was really a bunch of Nazi spies. No such luck, however.Mr. Hancock and his screenwriter, Stanford Whitmore, apparently think they can evoke innocence by trafficking in idealizations that weren't convincing even 35 years ago. The film makes no comment on Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post covers that are used behind the opening credits. Rather it adopts their style and then  unwittingly, I assume  he vacuity that lies behind the Rockwell gift for draftsmanship.Marion, of course, has doubts about the fraud he's pulling on these good honest folks, so would you be struck dumb if you were told that circumstances eventually turn him into an honest-to-gosh hero? Things go bad for him, but then they get better 'n' better.I can't believe that Mr. Hancock intended to make a movie quite as dopey as this one has turned out to be. Something vital seems to be missing.I also can't understand the PG rating. There is a tiny bit of barracks room language, but nothing you might not hear at a church social if Rover ate the turkey.",1976-05-06T05:00:00+0000

From the time of explosion the five survivors, calling themselves the Weather Underground, have eluded the authorities and carried on what they term ""armed propaganda."" This has consisted of a number of bombingsno injuries occurred; the object was to inflict material damage on symbolic targets  and the publication of a book and a news sheet.Early last year Emile de Antonio, a documentary film maker who is himself a radical, though scarcely a violent one, managed to get in touch with the Weather Underground. Mr. de Antonio and two associates, Mary Lampson and Haskell Wexler, spent two days in a Los Angeles house with the five, talked with them and filmed the talk.The result is ""Underground,"" which opened yesterday at the Regency Theater. It suffers from the crippling difficulties under which it was made. It is a film in chains. It is a series of failures, but they are not stupid or careless ones. They are intelligent failures, and if Mr. de Antonio's effort is largely a defeat, it is a defeat that he conducts with skill and integrity.His intention was to have the fiveKathy Boudin, Bernardine Dohrn, Cathy Wilkerson, Billy Ayers and Jeff Jonesreveal something of themselves. His sympathetic question is: What is a white, middle - class revolutionary group doing in America in the mid-70's?The answers he gets, despite his efforts, are largely schematic and abstract. The five have schooled themselves to be impersonal. They seem to understand that for a film they must come out a bit, but they rarely manage to.There are a few breakthroughs. Kathy Boudin recalls her dismay in Havana in 1961 when she found herselfa peace marcherapplauding a parade of Cuban tanks. Bernardine Dohrn gives a curious insight into her long journey from a comfortable middle class to armed concealment: ""I was more afraid growing up than I am now. Then it was paranoid; now it's real fear.""There is a hand wielding a coffee pot, and the red ribs of Bernardine Dohrn's sweater. They provide visual life, evidence that in fact we are seeing a film about five people. So do the faces of the three film makers; Mr. de Antonio's eye following that coffee pot has the impact of a cavalry charge.This is not intended to be facetious. The film makers have done marvelously well with these details, but the fact is, they have hardly anything else to film. The five will not allow their faces to be shown. So the camera shows their backs and their elbows.Talking faces, used by a film maker of Mr. de Antonio's skill and sensitivity, would have told us a lot about the five. But without the faces we have only the talk. It is good to have itWeatherman played a small but significant part in the American radical movement, if only, paradoxically, to weaken it by violencebut the effect is claustrophobic.The film makers use clips of the war in Vietnam, peace marches and police charges to illustrate the talk and vary its pace. There is also a scene in which the five leave the house and interview people anonymouslywe still don't see their facesat an unemployment center. The unemployed are angrywhat else would one expect?  and the five draw encouraging conclusions about an American revolution.This is nave. It is frail. Weatherman got its name from the Bob Dylan line about not having to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing. Now it has changed its name to Weather Underground. But how do you tell the wind's direction underground?The film doesn't ask this question, but, despite its sympathy, it doesn't try to conceal it either. That is its honesty.",1976-05-10T05:00:00+0000

us,William Girdler's Not-Quite-So-Toothsome 'Grizzly',"Jean-Luc Godard proposed some years ago that the only adequate way to review one film is to make another in response. A director named William Girdler apparently agrees. He's on his way to the creation of an entire oeuvre of such movies. ""Abby,"" made in 1974, was the repository of the Girdler meditations upon ""The Exorcist.""His latest, ""Grizzly,"" is the story of a man-eating grizzly bear that terrorizes the campers in a national park. It is Mr. Girdler's answer to ""Jaws"" and if I had the facilities, I'd review ""Grizzly"" by making a movie about a teensy-weensy insect walking amok. It would be called ""Flea.""""Grizzly,"" which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and other theaters, is such a blatant imitation of ""Jaws"" that one has to admire the depth of the flattery it represents, though not the lack of talent involved. In addition to Mr. Girdler, he people behind the film include Edward L. Montoro, the executive producer, and Harvey Flaxman and David Sheldon, who wrote the screenplay and then produced it. Lights like theirs don't fit under bushels.The national park that is the location of ""Grizzly"" is never identified, though one would suppose it had to be somewhere in the American Northwest, where one might conceivably find a grizzly bear, and not Georgia, where the movie was actually made. It doesn't help the film that the Georgia forests, while pretty, look somewhat less menacing than Central Park and that the grizzly who plays the lead, though large and probably dangerous, can't quite shake his Winnie-the-Pooh image.It's one of the curious properties of second-rate fakery that the blood and gore that ""Grizzly"" deals in are just that much more offensive than they might be in a better-made film, such as ""Jaws."" ""Grizzly"" is not only clumsily plotted, photographed and edited, it is also downright rude when it insists on showing us the bear lopping off an arm or decapitating a horse.Because it's not good enough to earn the right to scare us, I would hope intelligent adults would avoid it and that parents would give it a personal X.

us,Screen: Maximilian Schell's 'End of the Game' Opens,"""End of the Game"" is a metaphysical cuckoo clock of a movie, full of talent and fog. But the mechanism is deranged. Instead of every hour or half-hour, the cuckoo pops out every minute and a half.It jangles us. There's too much writing, too much acting, too many symbols, too much paradox, too many significant camera angles. The author thinks of lots of clever ways to do each scene; instead of choosing he does them all.The author, mostly, is Maximilian Schell, who directs, produces and has written the screenplay. The co-writer on the screenplay is Friederich Duerrenmatt, who wrote the original novel, ""The Judge and His Hangman,"" and who also  in more ways than one this movie is like an evening of charades among friends  acts a part.Other well-known people drop in briefly, as if paying a social call. There's Pinchas Zukerman, a profile swirled in fog, playing for 30 seconds or so on an autumn lawn. Donald Sutherland is even briefer; he is the photograph of a dead man, but when the dead man appears as a corpse some other actor has taken over.Casualness, sloppiness, excess; yet a lot of ""Game"" is entertaining, and there is an outrageous vitality to it that gives it a bumpy appeal.It is half allegory, half mystery. Thirty years ago two young Swiss men sit in a cafe in Istanbul. Gastmann bets Baerlach that he can murder a girl drifter they have picked up without anyone's being able to prove it on him. He pushes her into the Bosphorus.That is the prologue. When the film proper begins, we are back in Switzerland. Gastmann has become a master businessman-criminal, who wears the Swiss Government around his wrist like a thin watch. Baerlach is a decrepit, ulcer-plagued, cantankerous police detective whose life is a futile effort to catch and punish Gastmann.Then Schmid, a subordinate of Baerlach, who has been investigating Gastmann, is found murdered. Baerlach brings in Tschanz, a young detective, to help him and the two slowly move in on Gastmann. Gastmann is finally brought down although the death of Schmid is the one crime he didn't commit. The identity of Schmid's killer is the film's one real surprise.Baerlach is played by Martin Rittusually known as a director  Gastmann by Robert Shaw and Tschanz by Jon Voight. All three overact but it is a fine, joyful overacting. Perhaps overacting is appropriate to allegory; in any case their inspired hamminess is the film's real meat.Mr. Ritt is a fat, shaggy stomach ache. Lethargic and deadly, he is an untidy version of Porfiry in ""Crime and Punishment."" Mr. Shaw, who lives in a grand mansion complete with two black-coated stranglers, a leopard who prowls loose, and a wheel-chaired mother, is bouncily evil.Mr. Voight is apple-cheeked, righteous and passionate; when the role calls for more complexity he provides it. Jacqueline Bisset, as an Irish dryad whose function is to seduce and confuse, seduces and confuses.""End of the Game,"" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie Theater, is rated PG.",1976-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Cukor's U.S.-Soviet 'Blue Bird',"TECHNICALLY ""The Blue Bird,"" the new screen version of Maurice Maeterlinck's old, numbingly high-minded fairy-tale parable, is an American-Soviet co-productionthe firsta single film made by the pooling of American and Soviet talents.The movie was produced entirely in the Soviet Union, mostly in Leningrad and environs, under the direction of an American (George Cukor), with American and English actors (Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, Jane Fonda, Cicely Tyson, Robert Morley, Harry Andrews), with Soviet performers (Oleg Popov, Nadejda Pavlova, members of the Leningrad Kirov Ballet Company), with one English cameraman and one Soviet, and with dozens of Soviet technicians.What is being shown at Radio City Music Hall, where ""The Blue Bird"" opened yesterday, is one movie. Yet as you watch it you keep seeing two films that want to compete but don't, everyone being polite, accepting compromise, effectively neutered.One of these films is blandly American, like the sort of processed cheese sold in jars that can later be used as water glasses. The other is dimly Russian but without any real Russian character, except for the sets, which aren't great. They look like stuff left over from the Bolshoi Opera's last road tour.Though the film has about it a kind of lumbering tackiness that I associate with Soviet stage spectacle, I suspect that the Russian version of this co-production might be a lot more interesting than ours. For one thing, Russian audiences apparently love ""The Blue Bird,"" the chef d'oeuvre of the Belgian-born playwright who allowed Stanislavsky to stage the world premiere at the Moscow Art Theater in 1908. This love and familiarity with the work might possibly have inspired Soviet film makers to bring to it a consistency of character and style, as well as a decisive point of view, completely absent from the hyphenated production we have here.Spectacle for spectacle's sake no longer is the rage in this country. It can still work sometimes if it's put on a large patch of ice, but the romantic notions that motivate ""The Blue Bird"" are enough to send most American children, to say nothing of the ancients who may accompany them to the film, into antisocial states beginning with catatonia and ending in armed rebellion.""The Blue Bird"" is the story of Tyltyi and Myltyi, two poor peasant children who are instructed by the Queen of Light to seek the Blue Bird of Happiness. To help them on their quest. Light gives the kids a hat decorated with a magic diamond that permits them to call forth the souls of all things, animate and inanimate. Thus Tyltyi and Myltyi set off on their journey accompanied not only by Light (Miss Taylor in head-to-foot stage jewels) but by people representing Bread, Milk, Water, Sugar, Fire, Cat and Dog.At this point I'm afraid that I'm going to have to give away the ending of the film: before the children learn that the Blue Bird of Happiness is in their own backyard, they visit the kingdom of the past and the future, and the queendoms of night and luxury, at each stop learning some bit of wisdom. The film is not very old before you're longing to see a nice, self-absorbed Munchkin who wouldn't know an aphorism from a spitball.Mr. Cukor, a director of wit and immense verve (""Holiday,"" ""Pat and Mike,"" the Judy Garland ""A Star Is Born"") seems to have had less chance to direct in this case than to act as the goodwill ambassador who got his actors on and off the sets on time.The English-language screenplay, by Hugh Whitemore and Alfred Hayes, would tax the inspirations of anyone. What could Mr. Cukor possibly have suggested to Miss Taylor to help her read a line like, ""I am the light that makes men see/The radiance in reality""? Keep a straight face, perhaps. The actress has some creditably funny moments as a witch and some not-so-good as a peasant mother who darns socks.None of the English-speaking actors can do much but behave as if he was in a very unlikely pageant. This includes Miss Gardner (Luxury), Miss Fonda (Night), George Cole (Dog) and Cicely Tyson (Cat). However, the two childrenTodd Lookinland as the boy and Patsy Kensit as the girlare quite charming in situations that make the adults look ridiculous.The Soviet cast members, who speak in badly dubbed English, are no better except when they are given a chance to dance. Nadejda Pavlova is briefly, truly radiant in a tiny snippet from a ballet in which she dances the Blue Bird, but we see a lot less of it than I'm sure the Soviet audiences will. Members of the Leningrad Kirov Ballet are also featured in other dances, all of which appear to have been abbreviated for our consumption.We are also given several dreadful, Disney-esque songs, including one stunner called (I think) ""The Blue Halloo.""Why the film suffers from so many technical problems, I have no idea. The color quality of the footage involving the major characters often doesn't match the material shot, I assume, by the Russian cinematographer. Then there are all those blue birds we see from time to time. Some look like black birds and some are simply pigeons dyed blue.No New Yorker in his right mind would cross a street to look for a pigeon.",1976-05-14T05:00:00+0000

As Mr. Novak correctly perceived, it's a variation of a set of questions millions of guilty Americans ask themselves every day, as they turn to the sports section in the morning before troubling to check if the globe is still spinning on its axis, as they fall asleep at night wondering what football players the New York Giants signed from the Memphis Southmen.

us,Film: 'Echoes' Wavers:Jodie Foster Is Superb as a Dying Child,"""Echoes of a Summer,"" about the slow dying of a child, wavers infuriatingly between stoic beauty and sheer foolishness, between wisdom and sententiousness, between wit and archness.Its virtues, left too long on some vine of creative indecision or second-guessing, have gone badly soft in spots. It could have been a triumph. As it is, endurance, patience and a selective deafness will be needed for the rough parts; the good parts are good enough to make up for the trouble.The chief good thing is Jodie Foster, who played the barely adolescent hooker of ""Taxi Driver."" That was a stylish part; gritty, shocking and a natural for an acting tour de force.""Echoes,"" made two years earlier, when Miss Foster was still a child, offers no such ease. She must sustain the movie's major role. Her composure, her toughness, her bleak eye that dissolves into a rare but total glee, carry her over bad and embarrassing lines and turn the good ones into arrows.She plays Deirdre, whose incurable heart disease has split her parents into opposite and conflicting strategies toward death.Her mother is consumed by the need to overcome the impossible. She has taken Deirdre to specialist after specialist, in Europe and America, to try to find a cure. (""European doctors look away from you the same as American doctors,"" Deirdre observes.)When the movie begins it is her father's turn. A writer, he is convinced that the important thing is to make Deirdre's last year as perfect as possible. No more dragging from city to city; instead he has moved his wife and child to a riverside retreat in Nova Scotia.He treats Deirdre as his ""princess,"" talks to her in a mixture of child and adult whimsy, makes up stories and fantasies, refuses to talk to her about death. She must end with dignity and grace, he tells his wife. No one dies gracefully, she says.""Dying is a coming down from the hills,"" he says cloudily. ""Stop that,"" his wife says, agonized. ""How?"" he asks. Neither he in his futile whimsy nor she in her futile practicality can accept Deirdre's death.Deirdre can. She discusses her symptoms pitilessly with a brilliant and rough-mannered doctorone of the picture's best scenesand asks him to soften things a bit for her parents. She indulges her father and plays all his games until pain and weariness exhaust her.Her only real confidant is a plump, melancholy neighbor boy who is half her size. He lies down beside her on the beach when she asks him toshe wants to feel a man beside heralthough he cautions her that he is too young for sex. The scene could be mawkish and coy; it is funny and horribly touching.If Jodie Foster is the film's main strength  Lois Nettleton as the mother and Brad Savage as the boy are almost as goodits main weakness is Richard Harris.He is disastrous as the father. He is nothing but the whimsical, sentimental figure he is playing for Deirdre's benefit. And he imparts to the film most of its unbearable softness.""Echoes,"" which opened at the Columbia Two Theater, is rated PG. The caution is presumably for some of Deirdre's comments about sex.",1976-05-15T05:00:00+0000

Different Vietnamese have come up with different judgments about him. In March 1975 the Thieu regime called him a Communist and banished him forever, or so they thought, from Vietnam. They had found fault with his reporting of the fall of Ban Me Thuot, the event that precipitated the end of the war. He defied the blacklist in the last few days of April by arriving on the last Air Vietnam flight to enter the country. By that time most of the immigration police had fled and no one paid any attention to someone apparently foolish enough to be arriving in Vietnam when so many others were desperate to leave. Once there he resisted the panic of the evacuation because I had never shared the principles and policies of the Americans' intervention in Vietnam and therefore saw no reason now to share the risks and emotions of their flight. He stayed for 94 days, watching, listening and questioning the new Communist authorities. They eventually decided, contrary to the judgment of Thieu's police, that he was a susceptible bourgeois. His book makes it clear that if nothing else he is a hard working reporter. Giai Phong!

us,Magical Sequel to 'That's Entertainment',"From the opening creditsSaul Bass's witty montage of various fashions in movie creditsuntil the closing reprise of the ""That's Entertainment"" production number from ""The Band Wagon,"" ""That's Entertainment, Part 2"" is 997/10 percent pure magic. The three-tenths that aren't so great are the connectives between the film's individual sequences, which are drawn from 72 M-G-M features (dramas and comedies as well as musicals) and from the studio's short Subjects, representing the M-G-M output from 1929 through 1962.Even if you share my feeling that there is something morally wrong about ransacking old movies to make such anthologies, the objections become academic in the presence of the salutes to the good old days of Metro""That's Entertainment,"" released in 1974, and ""That's Entertainment, Part 2,"" which opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld.If one seriously cares about films (I tell myself piously), one should be wiling to work at them, to sit through all of the films represented here and not rely on excerpts made by someone else. But the 72 features in ""Part 2"" would require approximately 6 days of steady viewing with no time out even to go to the refrigerator. If astronauts were provided with In-Flight entertainment, they might be able to survive the lot, but the rest of us, even movie critics, aren't properly trained and equipped.Also, though it may be morally wrong to take movie scenes out of context, most of the films in ""That's Entertainment, Part 2"" would have a tough time qualifying as moral statements of an order in need of our protection. The greater part of the material comes from musicals and, with the exceptions of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""The Band Wagon,"" ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" and a couple of others, none of the musicals is so great that we can't afford to miss the stuff used to bridge the gap between the production numbers.The straight comedies and dramas are something else. Watching several sequences from ""Adam's Rib"" and ""Pat and Mike,"" those splendid collaborations of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon (the writers), and George Cukor (the director) with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, one aches to see the entire films, though the individual scenes hold up beautifully. Mr. Tracy may never have had a finer moment than the one in ""Pat and Mike"" when he admires Miss Hepburn with the statement, ""Not much meat on her, but what's there is cherce.""Such films are too good to be cut up. So is ""A Night at the Opera,"" from which ""Part 2"" purloins the classic state-room scene.Mostly, however, ""Part 2"" has been compiled with the kind of intelligence and affection that allow us to get some purchase on the Hollywood history made by M-G-M without spending our whole lives at the job. Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald are not everyone's idea of stars-of-the-ages, but the ""Lover Come Back"" number from ""New Moon"" is as much Hollywood operetta as can be stood by those of us not on the gloriously lunatic fringe with the other Eddy-MacDonald buffs.Other highlights include the great Judy Garland-Gene Kelly ""Be a Clown"" number from ""The Pirate""; Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse doing Cole Porter's ""All of You"" from ""Silk Stockings"" (which just about convinces me she was his best partner); two magnificently manic, almost surreal Busby Berkeley numbers (the finales of ""Girl Crazy"" and ""Easy to Love,"" shot at Cypress Gardens); a surprisingly little-girlish Lena Horne singing ""The Lady Is a Tramp""; a montage of sequences from films about composers composing, climaxed by a virtually classic bit of Hollywood nonsense from ""The Great Waltz""; Gene Kelly's fine roller-skating number from ""It's Always Fair Weather""; a montage of Frank Sinatra sequences, highlighted by another great Cole Porter number, ""You're Sensational,"" sung to Grace Kelly in ""High Society.""The film is so studded with highlights that I suppose we should be grateful for the ordinary contemporary footage that is used to connect the old material. It gives us time to breathe. This new footage features Mr. Astaire; 76 when it was made, and Mr. Kelly, 63, as television-style hosts. They also sing a little, dance a little and kid a little. They are still vital talents, but they should sue the make-up men who have attempted to erase the years of their careers under layers of paint and borrowed hair.",1976-05-17T05:00:00+0000

We've still got to look at our game, Scotty Bowman said.. I hope this series doesn't change the thinking. For two years, the Philadelphia Flyers had held the Stanley Cup, held it between clenched fists. But now the Montreal Canadiens had dethroned them. The only thing the Canadiens clenched were their teeth. Traditionally, the Canadians are of a hockey team of skill and speed. Style really. They appear to be skating in Pierre Cardin velvet blazers. Not that there aren't some muscles under the velvet. And a few elbows. But basically, the Canadiens play hockey the way it's supposed to be played. By sweeping the Flyers in four games, they recorded a triumph for law and order, a philosophy that the National Hockey League has occasionally winked at. But realists, such as Scotty Bowman, hope that the Canadiens victory won't erase the embarrassment that the Flyers had created with their brawling intimidation until Roy McMurtry, the Ontario Attorney General, intimidated them by arresting four players on assault charges. That's really law and order. Suddenly the Flyers coach, Fred Sherd, told his players, No mole cheap penalties, let's play hockey.

us,The Screen: 'Loose Ends' Unravels Regional Life,"Billy (Chris Mulkey) sometimes acts as if he were 14, though he's in his early 20's. Divorced from a wife he never loved, he lives in a one-room apartment, sleeps on a convertible couch, plays the radio too loud and keeps a couple of cats. He seems surprised when he calls a girl for a date at 1 o'clock in the morning and she asks him if he knows what time it is. He does but he's at loose ends.So is Eddie (John Jenkins), a mechanic who works with Billy at a local garage. Eddie is married, more or less happily, to Jen (Linda Jenkins). They have one child and another on the way. Jen wants to move to the suburbs. Eddie doesn't. Jen wants a dog. Eddie doesn't. They regularly have furious fights, after which Eddie stalks out and joins Billy at a bar called The Club. They play pool and pinball and drink beer. Life for Billy and Eddie is a series of six-packs.Unlike ""Goin' Down the Road,"" a 1970 Canadian film that ultimately patronized the aimless lives of its two blue-collar friends, ""Loose Ends"" rides along with Billy and Eddie, seeing just about what they see when they see it without imposing on them heavy sociological significance. The filmmakers, let Billy and Eddie speak for themselves, and that's mostly about cars. Says Billy of a woman he's met, ""She has this Caprice that's loaded with options,"" which is what they don't have.""Loose Ends,"" which opened a week's run at the Whitney Museum of American Art yesterday, is a remarkably good, level-headed movie about friendship and marriage and the limitations of each when, like Billy and Eddie, the people have never had to develop the means of conceptualizing experience. Neither Billy nor Eddie is dumb. Each is like an under-developed country whose highest aim is to become a consumer society. There are plenty of middle-class people with the same dimly realized ambitions.""Loose Ends"" was made on a shoestring in Minneapolis by David Burton Morris and Victoria Wozniak, who wrote, directed and produced the film. They are, I'm told, in their 20's, which is amazing in light of the exceptional discipline in avoiding both overstatement and an easy recourse to jazzy photographic and music techniques.The performances also are extraordinarily good, especially that of Chris Mulkey as the more loose of the two friends, a guy speeding through life with a transistor radio turned on full and two cats asleep in the back seat. When Billy gets wherever he's going, he won't even recognize it.""Loose Ends"" is the most interesting regional American film I've seen in years.",1976-05-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Missouri Breaks,' Offbeat Western","""The Missouri Breaks"" is a western set in the fine, high hill country of Montana in the 1880's and is about a rich, literate rancher (he reads ""Tristram Shandy"" to relax) trying to cope with horse thieves who are stealing him blind. It's about the rancher's pretty, bright exceedingly bored daughter, who quotes Sam Johnson and once seduces an outlaw by suggesting he get down off his horse. ""What for?"" says the outlaw, suddenly prissy. ""We'll talk about the Wild West,"" says the girl, ""and how to get the hell out of it.""It's about that same outlaw, a horse thief, and his pals, who aren't bad fellows really, nor especially successful, just guys trying to make ends meet under increasingly difficult circumstances. Also about the eccentric ""regulator,"" or private gun, hired by the rancher to bring law and order to his territory.""The Missouri Breaks,"" which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and other theaters, stars Marlon Brando as the regulator and Jack Nicholson the horse thief and has a cast of superb supporting actors, including Kathleen Lloyd as the rancher's outspoken daughter, Harry Dean Stanton and Randy Quaid as two of Mr. Nicholson's more prominent partners in fumbled crime and John McLiam as the rancher.More important, ""The Missouri Breaks"" was directed by Arthur Penn (""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""Little Big Man"") and written by Thomas McGuane. All of the credits associated with ""The Missouri Breaks"" are impressive. Yet I liked it better when it was called ""Rancho Deluxe.""""Rancho Deluxe,"" which was also written by Mr. McGuane, was a much smaller, similarly wise-talking version of virtually the same story, though set in contemporary Montana. The anachronisms in ""Rancho Deluxe"" (cattle rustling with a pickup truck, riding the range in a helicopter) were funny and moving partly because they emphasized the disconnection between a romantic past and a motorized present that's lost all ideals, all purpose.You might think that Mr. McGuane, by setting the same situation in the 1880's, would give us the romantic side of the story. Not at all. In the 1880's of ""The Missouri Breaks"" the characters are just as bored, confused and directionless as they are in 1975, and they, too, look back to some dimly remembered period when the old days were good. Instead of being elegiac and funny, however, the anachronisms in ""The Missouri Breaks"" too often seem like camp.This, I suspect, is principally because of the out-of-control performance given by Mr. Brando. He enters the film hidden behind a horse, which he at last peeks around, and then spends the rest of the movie upstaging the writer, the director and the other actors. Nothing he does (affecting the Irish accent he used earlier in ""The Nightcomers"" and wearing odd costumes, including frontierswoman drag at one point) has any apparent connection to the movie that surrounds him. He grabs our attention but does nothing with it.In their earlier films both Mr. Penn and Mr. McGuane have demonstrated a fondness for eccentric characters whose impulses have a kind of grandeur about them. There's no grandeur to Mr. Brando's character. Nor much mystery. He behaves like an actor in armed revolt.One has no way of knowing whether ""The Missouri Breaks"" would have been a good film without this peculiar presence as its center, but there are so many arresting things in the rest of the movie that one can speculate  a raucous kangaroo-court sequence in which the defendant, a horse thief, becomes just as giddy and rowdy as the men trying him; a scene in a frontier whorehouse that, for once, looks depressingly grim; a marvelous caper in which several none too bright outlaws steal a corralful of horses from the Royal Canadian Mounties, who are otherwise occupied. They are in church singing ""Bringing in the Sheep.""The film conveys a fine sense of place and period, of weather and mood and the precariousness of life, which are things that Mr. Nicholson responds to as an actor. Yet the plot, along with Mr. Brando, keeps intruding and throwing things out of balance. It's one of the film's oddities that as ""The Missouri Breaks"" proceeds to its bloody climax, with the scenes of violence increasing in intensity until one man slits the throat of another, it becomes increasingly trivial.The killing of a rabbit on screen earlier in the movie (which has been rated PG) is more brutal and more shocking than the climactic confrontation of the two superstars, which doesn't seem important at all.",1976-05-20T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Smile Orange,' Jamaican Story","The tourist is funny and crass; the native who serves and exploits him is crass and funny.""Smile Orange,"" a Jamaican film, is based on a play that must have been pungent and witty. The film has some pungency and lilt left in it, but it is terribly awkward.It is about Ringo, a picaresque hero who works at a tourist hotel, cons the tourists, sleeps with their wives and daughters, doctors the crabs for the crab races that are part of the hotel's slam-bang entertainment and imparts tactics and a kind of gallows philosophy to a younger colleague.""If you're a black man and won't play a part you're going to starve to death,"" he counsels his busboy disciple, while giving him lessons in how to be suave and use deodorants.As Ringo  he played the same role in the extremely successful reggae film ""The Harder They Come""Carl Bradshaw makes a funny and rather noble swindler. He has, not courage but equanimitythat is, grace under pressure under a hot sun.The film makes fun of the lumpiest and palest set of tourists ever to carry plastic shoulder bags. It makes fun of an upwardly mobile hotel manager, married to a lecherous blonde. It makes fun of the blacks' own version of the anti-postcolonial struggle: If you can't beat them, scalp them.Its best parts are the good lines from the play. Ringo rationalizes his getting his two brothers-in-law jobs as lifeguards, even though they can't swim. ""Tourists can all swim,"" he says. ""It's we Jamaicans who are afraid of the water."" He scornfully describes the foppish mulatto assistant manager as ""a zebra looking over a whitewashed fence.""But there is too much literal carry-over from the play. Head talks to head, back and forth, on and on. The cuts are rough, the photography turns everything to orange and cabbage color. The story goes nowhere, and the humor eventually loses its sharpness and becomes inane and too local.The freshness is like the breeze blowing through a half-built house  enjoyable for a while, but you lose patience with the holes, gaps and splinters.""Smile Orange,"" which opened yesterday at the Festival and New Yorker Theaters, is rated PG.

us,Screen: Chabrol On Love's Wars,"WHEN WE first meet Philippe (Paul Gegauff) and Esther (Danielle Gegauff) they seem an ideally happy couple. They're handsome, healthy, loving, exceedingly well-off. They've been together eight years. They have a bright, sweet daughter, who is 6, and they live in a fine old country house surrounded by lawns, rose hedges and orchards. On weekends friends come out from Paris for good talk and food and companionship.Even after eight years Philippe and Esther seem to be as sexually excited by each other as they were when they first met. Philippe has the kind of self-absorption carried easily only by the talented or the truly upperclass. His arrogance and conceit have been a form of reassurance for a middleclass girl whom Philippe has transformed into a perfect wife-mistress. Esther listens to everything Philippe says. He listens to her when it amuses him.On its surface Claude Chabrol's ""Une Partie de Plaisir,"" which has opened at the Juliet 1, is the report of what happens when Philippe decides that after eight years both he and Esther should be secure enough in each other's love to have outside affairs. ""Preventative medicine,"" is what Philippe calls them. The film is much more interesting and more haunting, though, as a meditation on love, on the complex system of balances that work in any love relationship, and on the furies that can be let loose within such relationships when the balances are disturbed.Almost all of Mr. Chabrol's recent filmsmost importantly ""La Femme Infidele"" and ""Just Before Nightfall""have dealt with the revelation of hidden flaws in supposedly perfect relationships, but always in the virtually abstract terms of melodrama. I say abstract because unlike the characters in these Chabrol films, few of us are driven to murder, and those few who do don't then go to such extraordinary lengths to hide the deeds. For most of us murder is a concept as remote as the Pythagorean proposition.""Une Partie de Plaisir"" is not a melodrama. Nor is it remote. It's almost a comedy, and it's intensely bitter and cruel. The film focuses mostly on the demonically egocentric Philippe, but it's Esther who emerges as the more interesting character. In the course of the film it's Esther who grows up and away from Philippe, even though torn by her old dependence on him to the point where she actively participates in his humiliation of her.Not since ""Les Biches"" has Mr. Chabrol so wittily (and mercilessly) examined the wars that are fought in life's living rooms and bedrooms, in kitchens and over dining room tables with friends as neutral, sometimes amused, sometimes appalled observers. It's a fascinating film and a very harrowing one.Mr. Gegauff, who has written many of Chabrol screenplays, including those for ""Les Biches"" and this film, is supremely self-confident and alienating as Phillippe, for which he even has the right physique  fastidiously cared for but not so successfully that the first signs of age aren't apparent in the clothes he wears. They are always just a little too tight, a little too young and modish for the fellow he really is. He's a man who would spend more time doing his hair than his wife would.Miss Gegauff, whom I've never seen before and who is Mrs. Gegauff in private life, is a stunning actress with large gray-green eyes, almost like a cat's, and a beauty that has as much to do with manners and expressions as with nose and jaw lines. That she remains for us someone almost as mysterious as she becomes to her husbandwho never has the slightest understanding why she finally leaves himprevents the film from turning into a predictable treatise on open marriage. ""Une Partie de Plaisir"" explores emotional territories  dependencies, actually  much closer to home and much more dangerous.",1976-05-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Guernica,' Arrabal's Civil War","Fernando Arrabal is a precocious 43-year-old child who sits on the floor and tells totally made-up stories about the outside world. They eddy and change color, from ridiculous to obscene to puerile; but stars keep falling into them.As a playwright, Mr. Arrabal has his own lodging in the Theater of the Absurd: It is called the Theater of Panic. As a novice film maker, he charges the medium head on.There is a lot of damage any halfway competent movie director could have warned him about; and a measure of splintered brilliance that no halfway competent movie director could have dreamed of.In ""Guernica,"" which opened at the 68th Street Playhouse yesterday, Mr. Arrabal, an exiled Spaniard, has given us his Civil War. It is grotesque and painful, absurdly obvious in parts, rough and chaotic almost throughout. It is almost totally one-sidedand yet in its own highly personal way it is authentic. It is the Civil War as nightmare, but its obscenity and ferocity are metaphors for tenderness.The setting is an imaginary village called Villa Romero, set in Extremadura, the most barren and backward of Spain's regions. With no subtlety at all, the film sets out its cast of characters.Vandale, played by Mariangela Melato, is a beautiful hermit, half-witch. Count Cerralbo is the rural landlord who rails against the Republic and the loss of his authority. He has three brutal sons who ride around assaulting peasant women and meeting in a cellar to plan their part in the Franco uprising.The fourth son, Goya, is a Surrealist artist who despises politics. He breaks up first-communion services by telling the children the wine is poisoned, paints obscene crucifixion scenes and sits through a scolding by his father while masturbating quietly into his brandy glass.The Nationalist rising takes place, but in Villa Romero it fails. The landlord's sons flee to join Franco's troops, the landlord climbs into the village school and is hidden by the schoolmaster, a Republican but an advocate of nonviolence.Vandale and Goya flee separately for France. They meet in the town of Guernica, fall in love instantly (a dove flies in slow motion from one to the other to symbolize it), and are separated when Guernica is bombed.She returns to Villa Romero and, no longer a hermit, rallies the villagers to fight the oncoming Franco troops. He gets an airplane and machine-guns the besiegers' cannons. Ultimatly the village falls, Vandale and Goya are made prisoner, and he is tortured. She manages to escape and free him. They climb to the mountains and against an enormous setting sun, embrace: symbols of a future Spanish liberation.That is the plot, with all its farfetched melodrama. The film's strength is elsewhere; in images that express the savage yearnings and excesses that were the fuel of a terrible civil war. Many of the villagers are dwarfs: Arrabal uses them to symbolize the oppression of a people. ""Now we will be like everyone,"" one dwarf declaresit is a flash of painwhen the village invades the landlord's castle.There are other blinding sights. Children move in a slow-motion procession up a hill; the soundtrack alternates their guttural chanting with an anthem; the effect is to bind up in one image churchgoing and church-burning Spain. There is an unbearable but inspired scene after the Republic is defeated: A bullfighter, using all the gestures and postures of his art, fights and kills five dwarfs lashed to wheelbarrows. The audience is the army, the church, the upper classes; the national anthem plays.These things, intolerable as they may seem, succeed beyond all reasonable expectations. Many other things fail; and the film's technical carelessness (it is filmed in Italy but even the Italian dubbing is sloppyat one point Miss Melato is speaking Italian and the crowd is answering in Spanish drags it down further.Miss Melato is a good actress but she doesn't have the force for the role. Her singing of one of the great Civil War songs is almost prim. On the other hand the American actor Ron Faber, playing Goya, makes a first-rate Spaniard.Rough, ridiculous, arbitrary: ""Guernica"" is a film designed to make the spectator fight it. The remarkable thing is that it frequently wins.",1976-05-22T05:00:00+0000

At that time, the court directed a senior United States circuit judge, Albert B. Maris, of Philadelphia, who had been appointed a special master in the case, to give further consideration to some objections raised by Federal authorities to his original report. He had recommended recognition part of Florida Bay as a historic bay and recognition the Dry Tortugas as inland waters, thus extending the coastline from which the limit of state offshore jurisdiction would be measured. After hearing further evidence, Judge Maris concluded that there was no historic bay between the upper Florida Keys and the Florida mainland and that the narrow waters were territorial seas.

us,Miss Kahn Lifts 'Won Ton Ton',"""Won Ton Ton, the Dog That Saved Hollywood"" is the name of the movie that opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater. What saves the movie, a jumble of good jokes and bad, sloppiness, chaos and apparently any old thing that came to hand, is Madeline Kahn.Madeline Kahn has eyes like sad soup, a jaw that is both long and vulnerable, and hair like unexplored jungle. Her voice is high and tinny, as though a midget were making a speech inside a beer can.All these things are part of her comic equipment, but they aren't what make her a genuine comedian. What she hasas W. C. Fields and Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin hadis a kind of unwavering purpose at right angles to reality, a concentration that she bears, Magoolike, through all kinds of unreasonable events. What is funny is not so much her visible actions as her visible mind.The movie itself is an untidy, sometimes pleasant mess, a string of sight and situation gags strung along a minimal plot about filmmaking in Hollywood of the 1920's. The colors and dcor look like ""Day of the Locust,"" the jokes about moviemaking on a shoestring look like ""Hearts of the West.""The gimmick is a trained German shepherd named Won Ton Ton (Rin Tin Tin, believe it or not, is the reference) who makes a fortune and then fades from sight. He is first seen letting himself out of the dog pound, after locking the keepers in his own cage. He meets Estie DelRuth (Madeline Kahn), an aspiring starlet, when both are hiding behind some garbage cans. (Never mind the details: It is simply part of a masterly bad day that she begins by walking out of her apartment dragging a whole tablecloth behind her, and continues by causing a monumental chain-collision when she tries to thumb a ride.)Potchuk, an equally aspiring director who has impractical ideas of making films about a giant shark, a girl possessed by devils and a city destroyed by an earthquake joins up. A teetery and lecherous film-studio chief (Art Carney), who sits at his desk in boxer shorts in order to speed up his interviews with young starlets, spots the dog.Won Ton Ton's success is phenomenal; he makes both Estie and her director rich. After a while the bubble bursts, the trio is fired, and Won Ton Ton is given away to a traveling dog show. Finally Estie, whose attempts to be an actress are nothing but a comic failure, is spotted as a comedian and makes a second fortune.There are a number of cheerful things along the way. A torrid romance between Eskimos is being filmedthe director screams at the protagonists to stop sweating.Bruce Dern is adequate as the young director, but his effectiveness depends on his lines and for long stretches he doesn't get much to contribute. Art Carney's horrendous studio president is funny for a while, but eventually becomes nothing but roaring.Then there is Miss Kahn. She has some funny things to do and say, but it is in her small moments of comic embroidery that her real talent shows. Some gawky, mindless calisthentics while Mr. Dern, fired, is trying to figure out where they'll go next. A lovely bit where she slumps and rocks in front of a distorting mirror, turning alternately square and oblong.The dog is all right. But Miss Kahn upstages him. It is because of her that ""Won Ton Ton"" is something more than a dog.The movie is rated PG. It is quite harmless. Possibly the rating is based on frequent references to sex as the way to get ahead in Hollywood.",1976-05-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Busy 'Drive-In':Odd Melange Watches Epic Disaster Movie,"""Drive-In,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is two movies for the price of one. And while one is better than the other, both are conceived in mordancy and sent forth with gleeful wickedness at the sort of multidramas made popular by novelists like Arthur Hailey and the disaster movies made profitable by Hollywood.Like ""Hotel"" or ""Airport,"" this movie brings together one night in a Texas Panhandle drive-in a pair of bumbling stickup men, two rival youth gangs, a teenage couple perhaps headed for an unfortunate marriage, a pretty girl who has just broken up with one of the gang leaders, the decent but sexually unprecocious boy she is now interested in, his voyeuristic brother, a frightened black doctor and a host of subsidiary characters.Before the movie on the drive-in screen ends, much will be decided. And what a film it is. Its title is ""Disaster '76.""From the occasional glimpses offered, it begins with a dynamite explosion aboard a jetliner, which proceeds to crash into a skyscraper, touching off a major fire. Sometime thereafter, a dam breaks, an ocean liner sinks and a shark menaces both a swimming woman and the ship's captain, who took over the controls of the jetliner after the dynamite went off.""Disaster '76"" is short, sweet and frequently funny. 'Drive-In"" posseses the virtue of fresh faces, the drawback of uneven acting, the irritation of occasional overwriting and the limited appeal of what is basically a juvenile story. It may not be ""The Last Picture Show,"" but it may be the last word in the miniaturization of a genre.The PG rating is presumably attributable to a couple of words, a bit of violence and an atmosphere of adolescent prurience.",1976-05-27T05:00:00+0000

Based on a tiny historical curiosityan experimental use of camels by the United States cavalry in Texas in the mid-19th centuryit should have been a nice small movie.Instead it stretches into an underpopulated two hours and five minutes. Joe Camp, the producer-director, who previously made ""Penji,"" seems to have a neo-Victorian idea of children's entertainment. You give the little things some small toy and they are to enjoy it quietly for a whole afternoon.A plump and febrile lieutenant, comfortably stationed in Washington, finds himself arriving at a bleak Texas cavalry outpost to try out somebody's notion that camels would provide ideal military transport for the region.The troops, who have been told only that they will be mounted on ""genuine Arabian steeds,"" greet him enthusiastically. The colonel, an artilleryman who hates his job, greets him sourly.The arrival of the camels produces universal despair, and some pleasantly ludicrous scenes. The troops learn to love the beasts, the despair abates, and so does the movie. To test the worth of the project, a 300-mile race is set up with a rival horse-mounted detachment. There are tangles with Indians and outlaws, with the camels gaining an eventual, though Pyrrhic, victory.The jokes, the comic devices, are distended, repeated, italicized. A barroom brawl is stretched out so that it comes to seem longer than the war in Vietnam.EverybodyJames Hampton as the lieutenant, Denver Pyle as the commanderoveracts. As the leader of the horse detachment, Slim Pickens, who sometimes makes overacting a joy, only manages to make it a chore.Mr. Camp seems to think that subtletylike properly seasoned food in that hypothetical Victorian householdis unsuitable for children.

us,Screen: 'Down Everest',"THE MAN Who Skied Down Everest,"" which opened yesterday at the D. W. Griffith and Regency Theaters, is the filmed record of the 1970 expedition led by Yuichiro Miura, the Japanese skier, sports promoter and television personality whose object was to ski at least partway down Nepal's Mount Everest, the world's highest peak. At times the expedition involved as many as 800 persons. It cost approximately $3 million, as well as the lives of six Sherpa guides.Yet the film, which was awarded this year's Oscar as the best feature-length documentary, has about as much to do with serious skiing as one of Jim Moran's more famous escapades had to do with bringing relief to the Arctic. Mr. Moran, you may remember, is the man who once sold a refrigerator to an Eskimo.It makes no difference that the expedition was a dangerous one, that real hardships were experienced in placing Mr. Miura just several thousand feet below Everest's 29,000-foot summit, which was the start of his something more than two-minute descent, or that that descent down sheer ice most of the time required extraordinary skills. The movie makes the whole think look very much like an Evel Knievel stunt that mankind could survive without.With the exception of the climactic run, which is shown twice, and some footage showing Mr. Miura practicing in conventional, low-altitude snow, most of the film is as doggedly banal and nonskiing as one of those Fitzpatrick travelogues that are kidded in ""That's Entertainment, Part 2.""We are shown what seems to be endless footage of the expedition hiking through the pretty Himalayan foothills and stopping at quaint mountain villages. We see Mr. Miura keeping in trim with various exercises, and we see the Japanese members of the expedition astonishing the Sherpas with a videotape showing of ""The Seven Samurai.""What's even worse is the virtually nonstop soundtrack narration, spoken in English but said to be based on Mr. Miura's diary. If he had put some of his prose on the bottom of his skis he'd probably still be stuck to the face of Everest. ""Skiing is my doorway to adventure,"" he tells us early on. He looks at an absolutely vertical snowfield and observes without a giggle, ""A bit steep, but what a downhill run.""When the six Sherpas are killed in the cave-in, he has some thoughts about Destiny's way, but he only achieves a truly lyrical nuttiness when he attempts to describe the mysterious compulsion that has brought him all the way to Everest: ""I dreamed of skiing on the virgin snows of the Himalayas. It's almost like the beginning of loveyou can do anything.""With this kind of buildup, the final two-minute run becomes something of an anti-climax.It, at least, is well-photographed, but much of the rest of the film isn't. The cameramen never seemed to have got the knack of panning across a wide angle of landscape without creating the impression that the scenery was falling toward the center of the screen.If this film won the Oscar, how dreary were the contending features?",1976-05-28T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Parks's Elegiacal 'Leadbelly',"Huddie Ledbetter, better known as Leadbelly, the great American folk singer and 12-string guitarist who died in 1949 at the age of 60, is evoked in beautiful, soft, dreamlike images in Gordon Park's elegiacal new film, ""Leadbelly,"" which opened yesterday at Loews State 2 and Cine Theaters.Leadbelly's life was hard and violent. He was born black at a time when blacks were ""darkies,"" in the Deep South in which ""darkies"" were supposed to know their place, which, for Leadbelly's family, was sharecropping. But Leadbelly never did know his place for long.He served one sentence for murder on a Texas chain gang and another sentence on a Louisiana chain gang. In 1939, after he had gained his reputation as a folk singer (sometime after the period covered by this film), he was once more up against the law, this time in New York, where he was sentenced to a year in prison for a stabbing.In the meantime he was always refining his music, which provided the order in a life that was in every other respect chaotic, more, perhaps, because of his terrible temper than because of the kind of black militancy that ""Leadbelly"" suggests.Mr. Parks and Ernest Kinoy, who wrote the screenplay, have imposed their own very particular kind of order on the Leadbelly story. It's as if the film were a recollection of the legend, rather than of the man. It's done in bold, broad strokes of incident and color that are as carefully balanced as the images in one of the better post-office murals of the 1930's. This Leadbelly is bigger than lifeand serenely removed from it. Which is why, I think, one attends to the film carefully and is never very moved.""Leadbelly"" is less a failure in execution than a mistake in conception, for if you accept this conception, you must go along with its more or less immaculate vision of triumph over degradation.You must also accept the performance of Roger E. Mosley in the title role. Mr. Mosley is a big, heavily muscled actor, but the muscles look more as if they came from lifting barbells in some neatly tended gym than from the random heaving of bales of cotton. The performance, like the physique, seems the result of careful study, not the eruption of furious passions. The character is about heroism, not its demonstration.The film was shot on location in Texas, which the cameraman, Bruce Surtees, often makes to appear so pretty that you can't believe that it's not a stage set by Oliver Smith. This, I suspect, is not because Mr. Parks didn't know exactly what he was doing, because the director has chosen this method, which worked beautifully in ""The Learning Tree,"" Mr. Parks's film about his own idyllic, mostly untroubled childhood, but is at odds with Leadbelly's life.It's also at odds with the Leadbelly music, sung on the soundtrack by HiTide Harris so effectively that it has no connection to the Leadbelly that we see on the screen. There are vitality, wit, sorrow and joy in this music, but it remains a kind of voice-over commentary to the events we witness.Two sequences in the film stay in the mind: an early country dance where Leadbelly plays as two dancers whip themselves into a sexual frenzy, and, toward the end, a chance encounter between Leadbelly and a once proud, now exhausted Shreveport madam (Madge Sinclair) who had been an early benefactor. The sequences are not realistic at all, but achieve a legitimate theatricality missing from the rest of the movie.The film has been rated PG, though its scenes of violence are so stylized that the horrors are removed, neutralized.",1976-05-29T05:00:00+0000

us,'Man Who Fell to Earth' Is Beautiful Science Fiction,"There are quite a few science-fiction movies scheduled to come out in the next year or so. We shall be lucky if even one or two are as absorbing and as beautiful as ""The Man Who Fell to Earth,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema I and Cinema II Theaters.When science-fiction writing enlisted such authors as Ray Bradbury, the emphasis on space machines, time warps and little green men gave way to more philososhical and emotional approaches. It was man or Martian, not as physical but as metaphysical travelers. Space was filled with loss and melancholy as well as gadgets.""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" makes some use of far-planetary landscape, of extrahuman physiognomy and even of space machinery. Sparingly, though; as a touch of color. Mainly it is about exile, about being an alien. Its story of an extraterrestrial visitor from another planet is designed mainly to say something about life on this one.Nicholas Roeg, who made the powerful but grotesque ""Don't Look Now,"" is an elaborate and mannered director. He does nothing simply; he uses indirection and ambiguity paced with sudden shocking effects. His complexity, his baroque style, is redeemed by a considerable though not total precision and control. His idiosyncracies overweighted the story of a grief-hallucinated couple in ""Don't Look Now"": they are extraordinarily well suited to this space allegory.Mr. Roeg has chosen the garish, translucent, androgynous-mannered rock-star, David Bowie, for his space visitor. The choice is inspired. Mr. Bowie gives an extraordinary performance. The details, the chemistry of this tall pale figure with black-rimmed eyes are clearly not human. Yet he acquires a moving, tragic force as the stranger caught and destroyed in a strange land.The story is complicated. It is set up as a near-total mystery that unfolds bit by bit, leavingit must be saida few small unexplained gaps. The price paid for this method is a certain confusion; the gain is the spectator's tingling desire to have the puzzle work out.There is an explosive splash in a Western lake, and soon Newton  David Bowie  is walking into a town. Immediately the film's theme is set. He passes, and is alarmed, by a garishly painted fun-park gondola in which a drunkard sits, gibbering. Where is Oute Space? Right here on earth.Newton pawns an immense collection of gold rings for $10,000. He takes the money and a sheaf of papers to Farnsworth, a top patent lawyer, played by Buck Henry. The papers are nine major electronics inventions. Farnsworth can't believe what he sees: ""For starters you can take General Electric, Polaroid and I.B.M.,"" he tells his strange black-garbed visitor. He is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he tells him. ""Is that all?"" Newton asks.Newton gives Farnsworth complete authority to set up a huge corporation. He takes shelter in a radio-equipped car, then in a motel, then in a lavish lakeside house, then in a desert shack. He is accompanied by a lovely, simple and increasingly tormented woman whom he picks up at the motel. All his contact with the outside world is by telephone through Farnsworth.Newton's empire grows, but is eventually sabotaged by a shadowy, C.I.A.-like group that enlists all those around himhis mistress, his bodyguard and a brilliant, cynical scientist, played by Rip Torn.Alongside this plot, giving it texture, are the gradually revealed mysteries. Why does Newton drink so much water? Why is he intrigued by railroad trains? Why does he continually watch television? Why does he use all the resources of his vast empire to build a one-man spaceship?The movie has its incoherences. Sometimes the mannerisms  overlapping shots, for instanceare excessive. Once Newton is broken, and his homeward drive is fully revealed and fully frustrated, the ending drags on for too long.But it is a first-rate achievement; helped by stunning performances not only by Mr. Bowie, but by Candy Clark, as his mistress. Buck Henry as the lawyer and Rip Torn, the scientist, are subtle and impeccable.",1976-05-29T05:00:00+0000

The site of the mod structure is on land where Branch Rickey played and coached baseball as a student, where his relationship with a black player influenced his eventual signing of Jackie Robinson, where his innovative philosophy of baseball organization was developed. Branch Rickey, now in the Baseball Hall of Fame, was primarily responsible for building the St. Louis Cardinals, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Pittsburgh Pirates into dominating teams over a span of nearly four decades. But when Ohio Wesleyan was searching for donors to its $3 million physical education center, the Cardinals, the Dodgers and the Pirates couldn't spare a dime. The only major league team that contributed was the nearby Cincinnati Reds with a $10,000 gift.

This would be good news if it could be blamed, authoritatively, on ABC and its Mondaynight blabbercasting, with Bob Prince playing the part of Frank Gifford, Bob Uecker playing the part of Don Meredith and Warner Wolf playing the part of Howard Cosell. A Uecker, like a Meredith or a Joe Garagiola, seems to be necessary on every team of mod announcers. It's required that he have been an indifferent performer in his playing days, in order for his inferiority complex to be commercialized; the others are allowed to make jokes about him whenever the game fails to engage their attention, which is often, whether or not the viewers at home are engaged, which is difficult because the blabbercasters keep distracting us from the play. One thing is perfectly clear: When ABC claims that it is not responsible for those banners that spring up, as if by spontaneous conniption, every Monday night in ballparks across the nation, the network is being, au, disingenuous. ABC's baseball season started off in Baltimore, and there was a banner: What Is A Uecker? The Network of the Olympics. Nobody in Baltimore had ever heard of Uecker.
