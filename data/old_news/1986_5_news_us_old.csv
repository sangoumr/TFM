us,Q&A,"Q. The paint on my inside windowsills has chipped off, exposing rusty metal under the paint. I want to repaint, but will enamel adhere to this rusty metal? A. Not if you paint right over the rust. The first thing you should do is use sandpaper, steel wool or a wire brush to get off all of the rust. Then apply a coat of metal primer, preferably the type made for applying over rust. Allow this to dry hard, then paint with two coats of enamel. Q. The cedar shingles on our house, which was built in 1947, will not hold paint, at least on one side which faces the bay that is nearby. We have been considering putting up aluminum siding, but a friend suggested that as a less-expensive alternative we should take all the paint off the shingles and then apply a regular shingle stain. How can all the old paint be removed, and is this a viable alternative to re-siding? A. Getting all the old paint off is quite a job but it can be done. You can take it off yourself with a water-wash, semipaste chemical paint remover, but it will be a great deal of work and you will need many gallons of remover. You would be better off hiring a professional contractor who has one of those high-pressure washers used with a chemical remover to get the old paint off. Removing the paint and then applying a stain is a viable alternative to re-siding, and with stain you will never again have a peeling problem (that is, if you use a true stain; not one of the ''heavy bodied'' types that are really paint).",1986-05-01T05:00:00+0000

This weekend the stallions will participate in an equine extravaganza at Radio City Music Hall, where the Royal Lippizan Show will feature Lippizaner balance and precision dressage as well as the famed leaps called ''Airs Above the Ground.''

More than two decades have passed since the limpid, haiku-like poems of Robert Bly's first collection, ''Silence in the Snowy Fields'' (1963), appeared. In the ensuing years, the poet has changed directions several times - eschewing the realm of private emotions for noisy, public pronouncements on the Vietnam War in ''The Light Around the Body'' (1967) and ''The Teeth Mother Naked At Last'' (1970), and returning to a more pastoral mode in works like ''The Morning Glory'' (1975) and ''This Body Is Made of Camphor and Gopherwood'' (1977). What has remained constant in his work, as this new selection demonstrates, is Mr. Bly's interest in man's relationship with nature, and his commitment to an idiom built upon simplified diction and the free associative processes of the unconscious mind.",1986-05-03T05:00:00+0000

From Shakespeare to Shelley, from Defoe to Dickens, literature's ''centuries'' have had, in Wallace Stevens's words, ''a way of being male.'' Of course, when we look into the past seeking what Elizabeth Barrett Browning once called esthetic ''grandmothers,'' we have always found a few women. But this only means that, confirming Anne Elliot's pained complaint, female literary history has usually been seen as, to quote the critic Elaine Showalter, ''desert bounded by mountains on four sides: the Austen peaks, the Bronte cliffs, the Eliot range, and the Woolf hills.''",1986-05-04T05:00:00+0000

Brooks Atkinson said here in 1951 that the author ''has industrially and reverently filled out the life of a master of the theater. . . . Mr. Magarshack's conscientious biography completes one of the great theater stories.'' Da Capo has reissued A METHOD TO THEIR MADNESS: The History of the Actors Studio ($11.95), by Foster Hirsch, an account of the system's importation to the United States and its transformation into ''the Method'' at New York's Actors Studio. Our reviewer, Marshall W. Mason, found the work ''authoritative and academic'' and said it ''accurately sketches the evolution'' of the Stanislavsky system, but he said it sheds little light on ''how Stanislavsky's ideas became distorted into [ Lee ] Strasberg's Method.'' THE GRASS, by Claude Simon. (George Braziller, Paper, $8.95. Cloth, $16.95.) Louise, who narrates this novel by the 1985 winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, lies beside her lover amid grass and reeds and tells him the story of her aunt, who lies dying, and of the wasted lives of those around her. ''There is no apparent order, no continuous narrative in the book,'' Henri Peyre said in The Book Review in 1960.

The premise here is rather like that of student course critiques from college days, the ones that assured you could sleep through Botany 101 and still fulfill your science requirement. ''Inside Track'' takes the student off campus and into the job market, with a breezy, relatively straightforward and ultimately unsatisfying look at life and job prospects at more than 50 American companies (and a couple of Government agencies) - based primarily on anonymous interviews with current employees. The profiles of these ''prestige companies - the companies where most people really want to work'' - are geared toward young people fresh from college or those who have been jogging through the rat race for a couple of years. Even so, some of the information seems, well, kind of silly. A section introducing profiles of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, for instance, notes that you'd better like cars; and a section on the auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's declares you've got to love art. Beyond this, the supposed inside dope, con-tained in sections dubbed, ''Heard at the Water Cooler - What It's Really Like to Work Here,'' is thin on the kind of information that counts for women and minorities. No matter what the stated intentions of a company's management might be, a fact of life is that the experiences of blacks are going to be different from those of their white colleagues.",1986-05-04T05:00:00+0000

us,THE MET'S GREAT MOMENTS HAVE BEEN FEW THIS SEASON,"So, there it goes again, the Metropolitan Opera, and not a moment too soon. The 1985-86 season, which ended last night with a performance of ''L'Italiana in Algeri,'' had a few memorable moments scattered through its 32 weeks, but the indelible impression it leaves is one of persistent, carefully planned mediocrity. Or, at best, the most modest, provincial sort of competence. The singers scheduled in this ultimate ''Italiana,'' for instance, were named Gail Dubinbaum, Betsy Norden, Ernesto Palacio, Vernon Hartman, John Darrenkamp, Paolo Montarsolo and Diane Kesling. It is difficult to understand how a company with the Metropolitan's pretensions could close out its subscription season with such an undistinguished cast, but humdrum was the rule this season, not the exception. The fact that smaller American companies have long been able to offer their audiences fare as good as this must account in part for the painfully slow death of the Metropolitan's national tour, which fades out of existence after this month's four-city run.",1986-05-04T05:00:00+0000

There are five flights a week (six from June 24) from New York to Santiago, and one flight a week between Santiago and Easter Island, except in high season - during July and from November to March - when there are two. Round-trip flights to Santiago start at $836 in low season, $936 in high; the five-hour Easter Island flight costs another $369, round trip, the year round. A $469 Visit Chile fare permits flights from Santiago to five Chilean cities, including Antofagasta and Arica, as well as the island.

Mary Garden, Conohita Supervia, Maggie Teyte and Victoria de los Angeles belonged to that select group whose current prime representative is Elly Ameling.

Now, with press releases insisting that the play has been ''misunderstood and neglected for years,'' public television's ''American Playhouse'' is reviving the work, tonight at 9, in an exceptionally skillful production featuring several fine performances.

His classmates treat him like one of their number, perhaps as a foreign exchange student, but his difference is as plain as the fur on his face. Buzz is a gorilla. The play is ''Kindness'' (at the La Mama Annex), a case of Ping Chong in an antic New Vaudeville mood, complete with running gags and routines, but with a bittersweet aftertaste. The title, in typical Ping Chong fashion, is intended as a pun. ''Kindness'' means sympathy, friend to friend, and it also refers to species, as the author-director suggests, splitting the word in two, ''kind-ness.''

President Reagan has already expressed pleasure at the committee's action. But the bill still faces a rough road before it can reach a House-Senate conference. [ Page A1. ] Individuals would get an average 6.2 percent tax cut. The top rate would fall to 27 percent, from 50 percent, and dozens of tax benefits would be eliminated under the proposal. [ A1. ] Wall Street is concerned because capital gains on investments would be treated like any other income and deductions for investments in Individual Retirement Accounts would end for people covered by a company pension. [ D22. ] The Senate bill would not raise corporate income taxes as much as previous proposals. [ D22. ] Markets The Treasury completed the second part of a $27 billion auction by selling 10-year notes at an average yield of 7.47 percent, the lowest rate since the Government began selling 10-year issues in 1976. Institutional buying was not enthusiastic, but there was buying by securities dealers and speculators who expect lower interest rates and higher prices. [ D1. ] Yields at banks fell in the week.

Miss Norwood, meanwhile, built a career on story-songs that she belts out in a raspy, emotive voice.

Dizzy with their own sense of virtue they try - by somewhat radical means - to persuade some of their classmates to tow the Sentinel line. They carry knives and guns and dress up in black hoods and leather face masks to terrorize and torture their fellow students. This leads to absenteeism and a high dropout rate at Vista Verde High.

Sunday's ''new pioneers'' are the trumpeter Peter Ecklund and his trio, who will give a concert at 5:30 P.M., and the saxophonist-clarinetist Ken Peplowski, who leads his quartet at an 8:30 P.M. recital. Each program will consist of two hours of music and a midpoint discussion with the musicians about the vintage jazz they play. The evening will wind up with a jam session involving both groups. Tickets for each concert are $8 for general admission or $12 for a table and complimentary bottle of wine. For both concerts, general admission is $14, or $20 for a table and the wine.

The process, technically called entombment, is intended to seal off any release of radioactive material, including the possibility that the molten radioactive fuel might melt through the plant's basement and into the groundwater, causing an explosion. [ Page 1, Column 6. ] Western Europe is squabbling over its home-grown produce and whether it is sufficiently free of radiation from the Chernobyl disaster to be sold for export. The countries have adopted diverse strategies in coping with the fallout and its effect on their agriculture. Italy is furious over the guidlines set by the European Community on what are acceptable levels of radiation. [ 5:1. ] U.S.-Philippine tension over American economic aid for the new Government declined after a meeting in Manila between President Corazon C. Aquino and Secretary of State George P. Shultz. Mrs. Aquino told Mr. Shultz that although a new $500 million aid package ''fell far short of what was needed'' to help the Philippines, she was reconciled to not getting any more at this time, her spokesman said. [ 1:4. ] Spain expelled a Libyan diplomat -the consul general in Madrid - and arrested a Spanish Army colonel who it said had asked Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi for money to finance extreme-right wing activities. Spanish authorities said the consul general, Saad Ismail, arranged a meeting between Colonel Qaddafi and Col.

Uncompromising and very often dour or bitter, his poems are full of private twists and torques, yet sharply expressive for the rest of us too. Their range is wide. They can be minutely and delicately attentive, as in these lines from ''The Poet'': He hears the woodmouse scream -so small a sound in the great darkness entering his pain. And they can repossess the trauma of unresolved horror and anger, as in the opening poem, ''On a Certain Engagement South of Seoul'': When I was nineteen, once, the surprising tears Stood in my eyes and stung me, for I saw A soldier in a newsreel clutch his ears To hold his face together.

The old days are long gone, when American recording giants like RCA and Columbia dominated classical sales, signing up the great conductors, singers, instrumentalists and orchestras to exclusive contracts. Today, Europeans control the classical record business, just as the Japanese manufacture the majority of the players on which those records are heard.

Most of his energies, however, have gone into ''American Splendor,'' an ''adult comic book'' he produces with R. Crumb and other artists. As Mr. Crumb explains in his introduction to this anthology of stories from 10 years of the magazine's issues, Mr. Pekar ''writes the stories in a crudely laid-out comic page format using stick figures, with the dialogue over their heads,'' then gives them to an illustrator who turns them into full-fledged comic strips.",1986-05-11T05:00:00+0000

My landlord has told me that I must move and that he will have to sell his apartment. I would like to know if the condominium board has the right to ban renters retroactively. . . . F D., Roslyn, L.I. Answer: The board is within its rights to change the bylaws of the condominium to prohibit owners from renting their apartments. But according to David Fishlow, a spokesman for the New York State Attorney General's office, the new ban on renting cannot be enforced retroactively. The board cannot require your landlord to terminate a contract that was accepted by that body when you signed your lease. You must be allowed to stay in the apartment for the full term of your lease. My Place or Yours? Question: Last year I married a man who lives in my building. Our apartments are small, rent-stabilized units.

THE proper method for scientific investigation has been a subject of disagreement for a long time. One view, put forward by Galileo, Francis Bacon and Newton, is that the most effective way to discover scientific laws is through experiment - by setting up controlled situations in which the basic elements of some phenomenon can be isolated and studied independently of complications. Another view, championed by literary figures such as Goethe, suggests that the direct study of almost any phenomenon in nature can lead to insights about fundamental natural laws.

This ''excellent'' biography takes a view of Whitman that is ''affectionate but undeluded,'' Helen Vendler said in The Book Review in 1980. ''The smokescreen of simplicity with which Whitman concealed his complexities is presented just as ably here as is the true simplicity of attachment and perception of which Whitman was capable. . . . Mr. Kaplan's attitude is the necessary one: that Whitman is vast and contains multitudes, just as he said.'' KING OF THE JEWS, by Leslie Epstein. (Plume/New American Library, $7.95.) Leslie Epstein's novel of the Holocaust succeeds where many fail, Robert Alter said here in 1979, because the author ''intelligently focuses his narrative not on the obscene mechanisms of mass murder itself, but on the morally ambiguous politics of survival of a Judenrat,'' or Jewish town council, in a fictional Polish ghetto. Calling the work ''quietly controlled, eerily lucid,'' he wrote, ''No work of fiction has opened up so fully the unbearable moral dilemma in which the Judenrat members found themselves.''",1986-05-11T05:00:00+0000

THE excesses of the recent military regimes in South America have become the fountainhead of an angry, unforgiving literature. For a new wave of writers, the grotesque nature of dictatorships cannot be adequately conveyed even by the masterly surrealism of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez. These writers view themselves as scribes, faithful chroniclers of the many acts of torture, execution and psychological terror that are all too fresh to be relegated to the domain of allegory. The subject of Omar Rivabella's ''Requiem for a Woman's Soul'' is torture, described in such harrowing, unrelenting detail that none of it can be dismissed as a product of the imagination. Indeed, the author, an Argentine journalist and human rights advocate, has based his novel on the testimony of victims of repression in his country. More than once, the reader is tempted to put down this slim volume, lock it away, forget its stomach-churning passages. But to no avail.

I was alarmed to find that the flooring contained asbestos, and apparently the workers failed to follow safe removal and disposal techniques. What can I do about this mess? A. The asbestos dust might or might not be a hazard, depending on whether it has all been cleaned up. It is hard to know for sure without testing the air (asbestos fibers are hazardous only if inhaled). Special contractors handle this work, and in many communities laboratories will test the air. Local health authorities may be able to help you find a lab, or consult the Yellow Pages. More information is available through the Consumer Product Safety Commission at 800-638-2772 or the Environmental Protection Agency at 800-424-9065. Q. In 1979 I installed a cypress fence around my pool, and now a fungus-type growth is appearing on some of the one-by-six boards. In addition, tunnels apparently caused by termites are on the outside of some of the four-by-four posts. I have been told to treat and seal the wood. What do you recommend? A. Wash the fungus off with a mildewcide or a solution of one part liquid laundry bleach to five parts water. Scrub on, let dry on the surface and remove with detergent solution. Treat with clear wood preservative, covering all sides and edges.",1986-05-15T05:00:00+0000

Though the opening credits of the television presentation bear the helpful subtitle ''A Personal View,'' the book regrettably carries no such disclaimer.

us,PREVENTIVE MEDICINE FOR MUNICIPAL SCANDALS,"IN the four months since Queens Borough President Donald R. Manes was found dazed and bleeding in his car early one morning in Queens, prosecutors' initial suspicions have grown into a full-scale municipal scandal. Officials at three agencies - the Parking Violations Bureau, the Taxi and Limousine Commission and the Health and Hospitals Corporation - have been accused of extorting bribes from businessmen. In all, nearly a dozen people have been charged with offering or receiving bribes in return for city contracts; five have pleaded guilty. (Mr. Manes committed suicide in March, after prosecutors indicated that they were seeking to indict him as well.) The breadth and seriousness of the allegations have caused many to question whether the city government should alter the way it does business. Should municipal work be contracted out to private companies? Should the structure of city government be changed? These were among the questions Alan Finder, an editor of The Week in Review, asked three municipal experts: Charles Brecher, an associate professor at the Graduate School of Public Administration at New York University; Robert F. Wagner Jr., a former Deputy Mayor who is a member of the New York City Board of Education, and John S. Martin Jr., a former United States Attorney in Manhattan. Excerpts of their remarks follow.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"EARLY ELKIN. By Stanley Elkin. (Bamberger Books, P.O. Box 1126, Flint, Mich. 48501, Cloth, $15. Paper, $7.50.) ''I was no prodigy,'' Stanley Elkin warns in his introduction to the odd assortment - three stories, one critique-cum-story, one memoir - that make up the 1950's wing of ''my little awful Elkin museum.'' But he would have us take this book to heart, regardless, as a sort of pep talk on the virtues of resolve, patience and desire in the making of a writer. Indeed, in the long story, ''The Party,'' it is difficult to see the wit or edgy tough-mindedness that would later distinguish such bravura performances as ''The Dick Gibson Show'' and ''The Franchiser.'' Instead we find ethnic sentimentality, clumsy flashbacks, portentous phrasings. Yet, even amid failures of technique and imagination, the Elkin sensibility struggles to its feet. ''That he was unhappy was his tragedy,'' he writes of the protagonist. ''Or rather that he was not happy made him unhappy and that was his tragedy.'' Similarly, ''A Sound of Distant Thunder,'' which gives us a Jewish shopkeeper in a failing urban neighborhood (the prototype, perhaps, for the extraordinary ''Criers and Kibitzers, Kibitzers and Criers''), has, despite its simplistic view of character and fate, a firm grip on the details of work and environment. The story reaches its climax with a sales spiel that anticipates the arias Elkin characters will deliver, to great effect, in the three decades following. In my opinion, the only wholly successful piece - aside from the wise, funny memoir, ''Where I Read What I Read'' - is ''Fifty Dollars,'' and it strikes me as an untypical effort, more somber and mannered than the mature work. Mr. Elkin, it appears, really wasn't a prodigy.",1986-05-18T05:00:00+0000

We have a great king who has turned from the battles of his hotheaded youth to statecraft and poetry. His harem is chock-full of beauties but his heart belongs to one, a blond Goth who, as Jonathan Fast's novel opens, is engaged in one of those life-threatening accouchements that signal the birth of a hero. When we learn there is an evil elder brother, with a hissing lisp, a harelip and a dubious relationship with his own mother, we can see where the novel's going. Mr. Fast even has one character tell us ''every second-rate Sanskrit author has tried his hand at a work about brothers who battle for the throne.'' Nevertheless, ''Golden Fire'' has many treats for the reader. Set pieces like the birth and attempted murder of the infant prince, scenes at a burning ghat and a monastic retreat are lusciously detailed. Mr. Fast's research is terrific, from postoperative sutures contrived from the mandibles of black ants to the use of resin for decorating the sole of the female foot. The trouble is that motivation, psychology and dialogue are all too often flat-footedly 20th-century American. Father and bad elder son discuss sibling rivalry, neglected women take drugs and get fat, prospective fathers wile away the waiting as though they were hanging out with friends in a bar.",1986-05-18T05:00:00+0000

What he made of all this was a rigorous art of compressive power, if more suited to certain emotions than others. He was unquestionably a genius, but of the kind that advertises its limits. Critics were on to these from the very beginning, but in the forward-looking 1920's, they joined his readers to make him the writer for their time. His stuff was new. It moved. There was on every page of clear prose an implicit judgment of all other writing. The Hemingway voice hated pretense and cant and the rhetoric they rode in on.",1986-05-18T05:00:00+0000

The English playwright Joe Orton had written only three full-length stage plays - ''Entertaining Mr. Sloane,'' ''Loot'' and ''What the Butler Saw'' - when he was killed by his homosexual lover at the age of 34 in 1967. While his outrageous farces failed to find an audience in this country in the 1960's, his reputation has risen steadily in the last few years, and the current New York production of ''Loot'' has been critically acclaimed. This biography ''is most helpful in providing special insight into the plays,'' Harold Clurman wrote here in 1978. ''John Lahr has been, and in this book remains Orton's most persistent champion largely because he rightly feels that our day requires the cure of disruptive laughter.'' THE GERMAN LESSON, by Siegfried Lenz. (New Directions, $10.95.) When Siggi Jepsen, a teen-age inmate of a reform school, is ordered to write an essay on the subject of duty, he recalls his childhood in a German village during World War II and the bitter conflict between his policeman father and a famous Expressionist painter whose works had been outlawed by the Nazis. Ernst Pawel said in The Book Review in 1972 that Siegfried Lenz's novel is ''a book of rare depth and brilliance'' that ''signals the emergence of an authentic new voice, shattering in its quiet authority.'' The author's ''wry low-keyed sense of humor is a constant delight,'' he said, and the translation by Ernst Kaiser and Eithne Wilkins conveys ''the full power of the original.''",1986-05-18T05:00:00+0000

The men on the job, and the few women too, wear bandannas and down vests and work boots, and they stick their thick gloves in the back pockets of their jeans. Today is Thursday, and so Angelo Bommarito, the foreman for the laborers, zigzags across the site, finding his men and passing out checks. ''Yo, Giacomo,'' he hollers at a man driving a forklift. The man cannot hear above the engine's noise. ''Yo! Payday!'' The man hits the brakes. Giacomo gets his check, but he cannot cash it until he takes the boat back to Manhattan.

In these thumbnail sketches of selected ships, an asterisk indicates a vessel that participated in OpSail '76; mast height is the height of the tallest mast above water level, and length includes bowsprit. 1. GAZELA OF PHILADELPHIA* (United States). Only 20 years ago, this three-masted barkentine was fishing on the Grand Banks under the Portuguese flag as the last commercial square-rigger operating out of Europe. Built in 1883, she is the oldest and largest wooden sailing ship still putting out to sea. Nearly every plank is original. In 1971 she was acquired by the Philadelphia Maritime Museum. Crew, 59; length, 175 feet; mast height, 188 feet. 2. SIMON BOLIVAR (Venezuela). This modern three-masted bark, built in Spain in 1980, can be easily recognized by the gunports painted onto her black-and-white hull and the single-story chart house behind her mizzenmast. Crew, 110; length, 270 feet; mast height, 140 feet. 3. DEWA RUTJI (Indonesia).

us,The Pastime According to Charlie O.,"Seven things that Charles O. Finley, the last of baseball's great innovators, would do to improve the game: 1. Give the batter a walk on three balls instead of four. ''There've been four balls and three strikes since 1889 - 97 years in which pitchers have been getting bigger and stronger, and the fielders helped by better gloves and improved playing surfaces. It's time to give the offense a boost.'' 2. Schedule interleague play. ''It would be baseball's greatest attendance shot in the arm since Babe Ruth.'' 3. Require the National League to institute the designated hitter. ''The average pitcher couldn't get a hit off my grandma. The d.h. puts more action into the game, and National League fans deserve it too.'' 4. Switch from white baseballs to orange, an old Finley idea. ''It would help batters see the ball and put a vivid color into the game. And fans, especially people watching on TV, could follow the ball more easily.'' 5. Introduce a 20-second clock, requiring pitchers to deliver to the plate before time expired unless there were runners on base. ''The 20-second limit is already in the rule book but never enforced. The clock would speed up the game and finally put a time element into baseball. It would be exciting to see time running out, as in basketball, football and hockey.'' 6. Allow a designated runner. ''He could run the bases for someone else a maximum of three times, and the base runner he replaced could stay in the game.",1986-05-20T05:00:00+0000

''As a coach, I have always emphasized the importance of a quality education, and this was a chance to support that belief,'' Paterno said yesterday. Paterno, who has been head coach at Penn State since 1966 after serving 16 years as an assistant under Rip Engle, is currently active in a new role as a fund-raiser for the university. He is a vice chairman of the Campaign for Penn State, a $200 million fund drive for academic enhancement. The campaign is now in the advance gifts phase. ''I'm repaying an obligation and a debt that I owe to Penn State,'' Paterno said. ''Like many families, we saved for years to educate our five children. As it turned out, the first four decided to attend Penn State, where our costs were far less because of my being on the faculty.'' The Paternos' two daughters, Diana Lynne and Mary Kathryn, are Penn State graduates. One son, David, is enrolled in the engineering school, and another son, Joseph Jr., will enter Penn State's new School of Communications in the fall. The other son, George Scott, is in the seventh grade. Paterno said he talked over the plans for the gift with his wife, Sue, and the children.",1986-05-22T05:00:00+0000

KONWISSATIONS WITH A KAT","George Herriman is an authentic American genius, one of the enduring figures in the art of the comic strip. His only equal in visual inventiveness is the cartoonist Winsor McCay, who drew ''Little Nemo in Slumberland.'' McCay's effects are lush alongside Herriman's imaginative austerity, but no one even approached Herriman for verbal ingenuity until Walt Kelly, a Herriman admirer, turned up with Pogo after World War II. Herriman experimented with a number of strips between 1902 and 1932, but it is ''Krazy Kat'' - which appeared from 1913 until Herriman's death in 1944 - on which his fame rests. Herriman worked many splendid variations on the basic plot which finds ''that nice 'kop,' Offisa Pupp'' attempting to keep Ignatz Mouse from beaning Krazy with a brick, which Krazy always receives as an emblem of love.

For the author's English translator, Carl Weber, ''Hamletmachine'' is ''probably Muller's most complicated text, and the most difficult to decode.''

ONLY in the peaceable kingdoms of art and Eden are the relationships of humans and animals innocent and harmonious; here and now they are complex, uneasy, often cruel and always profound. City dwellers, seeing only people plus an occasional Peke or pigeon, can pretend that nothing on earth matters but us; but if we want to eat or breathe, our dependence on nonhuman life is absolute and immediate, although mostly unexamined. When we use animals, as work partners, for food, or in laboratories, the ethics of the relationship become both urgent and obscure. In the matter of the use of animals in laboratory experiment, some extremists confuse use with misuse and demand a total ban, while others justify means by ends and demand that atrocities be condoned. The subject is what might be called a hairy one - and in ''Silent Partners'' Eugene Linden has picked a particularly tangled but fascinating aspect of it to explore in his third book about the apes used in language experiments. His earlier books are ''Apes, Men and Language'' and ''The Education of Koko.''",1986-05-25T05:00:00+0000

Outside the shopping malls and office blocks, the State Parliament and other government buildings, much of the city's life goes on elsewhere. Sydney, like New York, is a vast patchwork of separate neighborhoods whose boundaries are defined by subtle shifts of prosperity, ethnic origins or topography.

That he summarizes as trying to give ''future world leaders a calculus of international relations which does not depend upon the threat of nuclear annihilation.'' But his book is not the sober, objective analysis that the description of his aim suggests.

After the plan has been accepted for filing, however, it is legal for the sponsor to allow those who have signed purchase agreements to rent their units. If the plan does not go through, the unit would remain under rent-stabilization and the supervision of the state housing agency.

If a passenger decides, however, to drop out of a tour that is operating as scheduled, or to cancel hotel or transportation arrangements that have already been paid for, substantial financial penalties may be imposed.",1986-05-25T05:00:00+0000

us,'Bigfoot Dreams',"In the murky gloom of much contemporary fiction, one seems always to be following the fate of an aging, alcoholic writer, an unfulfilled Manhattan wife or a troubled survivor of the 1960's. Francine Prose offers lively alternatives. In six previous novels, she has set out exuberantly onto roads less taken, winding between myth and reality, exploring the legends with which people give meaning to their lives. In ''Judah the Pious'' (1973), a rabbi unravels an unpredictable tale of dreams and disguises. In ''Hungry Hearts'' (1983), a capricious dybbuk possesses the heroine. Invoking the supernatural with humor and sympathy, Miss Prose reveals the wonder at the heart of everyday life. As someone ruefully remarks in ''Household Saints'' (1981), ''Maybe the burning bush was burning all the time and Moses didn't notice. Maybe the miracle is when you stop and pay attention.''",1986-05-25T05:00:00+0000

As always, the National Theater and Royal Shakespeare Company mix the classics in their repertory schedules with contemporary scripts of nearly every esthetic and ideological persuasion. No doubt some of these new plays will eventually travel to our own institutional theaters - or even Broadway - though past experience suggests that they could be either substantially sharpened (''The Real Thing'') or bruised (''A Map of the World'') in transit.",1986-05-29T05:00:00+0000

''Sound Wave N.Y.C.,'' an audio art series mixing ''sound gardens,'' gallery exhibits and live performances, continues this weekend with shows tonight through Sunday at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street. Tonight at 9 o'clock, the performers include David Garland, who sings and plays everything from a toy piano and a piece of Styrofoam to the medieval psaltery; Linda Fisher, who reads texts inspired by mythology and feminism against electronic music, and Yoshimasa Wada, known for bagpipe-like instruments fashioned out of plumbing fixtures and powered by an air compressor. Frankie Mann and Sher Doruff, Nigel Rollings and Ellen Fullman will perform tomorrow at 9 P.M., and David Behrman, Andrew Culver and Brooks Williams will appear Sunday, also at 9. Tickets are $6 for each night's performance. Information: 477-5288.

It seeks to focus attention on the Holy Spirit, the mysterious third person of the Trinity.
