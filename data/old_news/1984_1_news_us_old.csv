The move by the nation's largest steel company is part of a continuing effort to bring its break-even point down to 50 percent, and analysts said the writeoff could give the company a $900 million loss for 1983.

Not a prolific composer, he is generally late with deadlines. In fact, he is probably the epitome of what the non-musician thinks of as the serious composer. Self-denigrating and grandiose at the same time, poetic, moody and emotional, his conversations avoid references to technical aspects of music theory and are peppered instead with allusions to Flaubert, Balzac, Artaud and Brahms. Still, however audibly he sighs, however pained or bumbling he may appear to be, Mr. Kirchner has moved steadily upwards in his career throughout his adult life. As a composer he has always been his own man; using an advanced 20th-century vocabulary, he has managed to make music that is both lyrical and rhapsodic, a feat that sets him apart from the rest.",1984-01-01T05:00:00+0000

In films such as Mel Brooks's ''Young Frankenstein'' and Howard Zieff's ''Hearts of the West,'' movie mystiques were dissected, mocked and analyzed in Hollywood's version of Oedipal revolt. Now, the mystique seems to be back - and so are new versions of old classics or personal favorites that have tickled contemporary directors' fancy. Among Hollywood's Christmas offerings, three - ''The Man Who Loved Women,'' ''Scarface'' and ''To Be or Not To Be'' - are remakes of earlier movies, and they're only the swell of a wave that has already included ''Breathless'' last year, and that promises to crest in the coming weeks with ''Unfaithfully Yours,'' ''Against All Odds'' (''Out of the Past,'' updated), ''Where the Boys Are,'' ''Crackers'' (''Big Deal on Madonna Street'' redux) and, soon, ''The Razor's Edge.''",1984-01-01T05:00:00+0000

Today, the young North Americans that go under the label of new mime have usually studied some form of dance. Moreover, dance critics, accustomed to nonverbal theater, have been more open to reviewing mime than drama critics. In New York, it is a dance organization - Dance Theater Workshop - that has taken the lead in presenting the new mimes, who include Bill Irwin, Bob Berky, Daniel Stein, Thomas Leabhart and the United Mime Workers.

Just as quickly, he became a controversial figure whose reputation for ruthless and eccentric behavior followed him to the grave. The following article has been adapted from a new biography, ''Jed Harris: The Curse of Genius,'' to be published this month by Little, Brown and Company. Del Hughes had gone from stage managing for Jed Harris to a similar job with Kermit Bloomgarden, a young producer who was earning a reputation for doing important plays. Hughes was on West 45th Street when Bloomgarden hailed him from beneath the marquee of the Morosco Theater. Hughes crossed over and said hello to the producer and the tall, skinny, bespectacled young man with him. It was the playwright Arthur Miller. Hughes had stage managed his ''Death of a Salesman.'' Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller were then the reigning kings of the American stage. Williams's ''The Rose Tattoo'' was a success of the current season. The New York theater now impatiently awaited Miller's next work. ''We're thinking of hiring Jed Harris to direct Arthur's new play,'' Bloomgarden said to Hughes. ''You worked for him.

Here are some of their replies: Edward I, Koch, Mayor, New York City: ''What I would really like to see is a greater appreciation for the display of art in our parks and public places, free of vandalism and graffiti.'' James Levine, music director and principal conductor of the Metropolitan Opera: ''I wish we could change our need to make detailed and complete plans five years in advance. While working so far ahead helps insure the presence at the Met of as many great artists as possible, it also forestalls our ability to use our artistic imagination spontaneously, to engage an artist who bursts suddenly on the scene, or to revive a work that turns out to be more popular than we expected. Opera is the victim of its own success and artists are in demand as never before. It would be so great to have the luxury to rework next year's plans, or even next month's if we wished. Right now, my head is in 1988. This is crazy!'' James Rosenquist, painter: ''Few people recognize what artists happen to do for others.

''E.T'' is very much a hybrid of the 1960's and 1980's mythologies - a high-tech fairy tale about a flower child from outer space - and the extraordinary success of that film, along with all the other evidence assembled by Kathleen Agena, suggests that the myth of the Eternal Child has, over the past decade or so, spread throughout American society.",1984-01-01T05:00:00+0000

Miss Ni Dhomhnaill used to sing (and play the clavinet, a harpsichord-like electric keyboard instrument) with an Irish folk-rock group called the Bothy Band. She now does the same thing with an American country-Irish outfit called Touchstone, investing the Appalachian-style ballads of that group with the same plaintive Celtic flavor that suffused her singing with the Bothy Band. None of her records seems to be in the domestic catalogue at the moment. But she does crop up occasionally at Folk City, with Touchstone or on her own, and some Bothy Band material should still be obtainable as imports.More recently, I have developed a parallel enthusiasm for an English - at least British - singer named Emma Kirkby. Miss Kirkby is a specialist in early music, that term meaning not Celtic ballads but classical music of the Middle Ages to the Baroque. She can be heard on any number of recent early-music albums, among them Hyperion's disk of the music of the 12th-century Hildegard of Bingen, the Chandos Records' release of Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas,'' Christopher Hogwood's interpretation of Handel's ''Messiah'' on Oiseau-Lyre and imported copies of the same label's ''Portrait of Emma Kirkby.''",1984-01-01T05:00:00+0000

This same language appears in the caption beneath a photograph of Mr. Allen. These statements are incorrect and misleading. After a thorough investigation into the circumstances of this highly publicized matter, the Department of Justice concluded: ''In this matter, the money was not given to Allen for anything he had done; rather, it was intended as an honorarium for Mrs. Reagan and simply intercepted by Mr. Allen. It was neither given nor received to benefit Allen or to influence him in any way. Indeed, he was not even aware of the contents of the envelope until after the meeting was completed. . . . In sum, when the uncontradicted facts are analyzed in the context of possibly applicable criminal laws, it is clear there was no criminal violation by Allen regarding the $1,000.''",1984-01-01T05:00:00+0000

Mark you, the roof, stairs, seats, stage, in fact all the physical circumstances of Mirror Theater are almost ostentatiously modest, even by Off Off Broadway standards. Some spectators sit at such an oblique angle to the action they should really be provided with periscopes; and the off-stage clunks and bumps at a quiet climax of Susan Glaspell's ''Inheritors'' made me wonder if the company shouldn't also invest in one of those electric sound-suppressors you can buy at upscale hardware stores. A supposedly naturalistic set for the same play includes a sky-drop of stark, unvarying orange, suggesting that the Iowa climate is similar to the one astronomers tell us prevails on Venus. And space on the stage is so tight that, especially in Clifford Odets's ''Paradise Lost,'' you may sometimes be reminded of one of those student attempts to break the world record for cramming people into a Volkswagen. At one point a large motorcycle is added to the domestic crush, creating something perilously close to gridlock in the slightly expanded doll's house within whose paper-thin walls Odets's play appears to occur.",1984-01-08T05:00:00+0000

us,A First Novelist at 73,"In her moment in the literary spotlight, Harriet Doerr is concerned that too much attention is being paid to her rather than to her novel, ''Stones for Ibarra.'' Of course, she recognizes the reason behind all the fuss: She's a first novelist at the age of 73. Although she is a native Californian, Mrs. Doerr and her husband lived in Mexico for 15 years and, like the fictional American couple in her novel, spent time in a small Mexican village. ''But,'' she said, ''this is not an autobiographial novel and it is not about one place, though I have seen mining towns like Ibarra. All you can write about is what you know, but then you have to put your imagination to work.'' Was it difficult to enter the minds of Mexican villagers? ''It's hard to say that you know another people well,'' Mrs. Doerr said, ''but I feel that I do have something in common with the Mexicans. They are so human and wise - they take adversity as if they expected it to happen.'' Several years after becoming a widow, Mrs. Doerr decided to return to school. She had gone to Smith for a year in 1928 and to Stanford a year later. In 1977, she got her B.A. at Stanford, majoring in European history. And, then, she began taking graduate courses in fiction with John L'Heureux, director of Stanford's creative writing program. The program included such visiting lecturers as Donald Barthelme, Grace Paley, Robert Stone and Eudora Welty - ''She's older than I am,'' Mrs. Doerr noted.",1984-01-08T05:00:00+0000

The most widely used instrument for assessing health in Wonderland was a simple tool that produced a single score with proven reliability. That instrument, called a thermometer, had the added advantage of being easy to administer and record.

us,MOSCOW'S MILITARY 'COSTS',"The Administration reportedly plans to ask $305 billion for defense in fiscal 1985 - an impressive 19 percent more than this year's appropriation. As usual, the rationale for the hike will be supposed runaway Soviet defense spending America must match. Yet the Central Intelligence Agency, in a report last fall that got too little attention, undermined the ''Russians are coming'' rationale the Administration has harped upon for three years to justify its military buildup. A more realistic Gordon Adams directs the defense budget project at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a public-policy organization. assessment of Soviet strength, and a more reasonable defense budget, are possible and urgently needed. Our defense spending has nearly doubled since 1980, rising more than 40 percent in uninflated dollars. The White House argues: ''From 1970 to 1981 the Soviets outinvested the U. S. in defense by about half a trillion dollars in constant 1984 dollars.'' This estimate of Soviet military spending and, implicitly, capabilities will not wash, as the C.I.A.'s dollar-ruble comparison has made clear. Since the Kremlin does not publicize full data on military outlays, we cannot know precisely how much its military output costs. So we invent a method to try to assess it, but, as the C.I.A. has demonstrated, that method causes us to chase a phantom spending gap. The result: illusory security.",1984-01-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Up From Anonymity,"A half-century ago, when she first began writing novels and plays, Molly Keane hid behind a pseudonym, M. J. Farrell. As a young woman living among the Irish gentry in her native horse- and-hounds country, she did not think it would sit too well with the young gentlemen she was trying to impress to be known as a literary instead of a riding person. Success came fairly early to Mrs. Keane. As a playwright, she wrote what one observer called tea-cozy comedies. At the end of 1938, M. J. Farrell had a modest Broadway hit at the Morosco Theater called ''Spring Meeting,'' starring Gladys Cooper and directed by John Gielgud. The New York Times drama critic, Brooks Atkinson, sort of praised it - ''It is written with impish abandon and acted with gayety and relish. Nothing cerebral, you understand.'' Her early writing, however, was followed by a long silence, which was broken by the novel ''Good Behaviour,'' published here in 1981 under the author's real name. From her small aerie above the fishing village of Ardmore on the southern coast of Ireland, Mrs. Keane, now 80, cheerfully explained the stops and starts of her career. ''I wrote a lot when I was very young and it's never been easy - that awful discipline. I'm quite slow, write in longhand, never learned the typewriter. After many years of inactivity, four years ago I decided to try my hand again on a novel. I was a widow, my daughters were married, I had time on my hands and a lack of money.''",1984-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,THE KISSENGER REPORT COULD SHARPEN LATIN POLICY DISPUTE,"WASHINGTON T HREE times in the last 12 months, President Reagan has used bipartisan commissions to try to get out of political trouble. A Presidential commission neutralized the prickly issue of Social Security financing. Another helped persuade Congress to reverse itself and go along with the MX missile. But at least initially, it seemed unlikely that the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America would rescue Mr. Reagan from the deadlock that has dogged his Central American policy for nearly three years. The commission report could even fan the flames of Election Year partisanship. Unquestionably, it has lit a fuse. After months of preoccupation with Lebanon, the White House was busy this weekend translating the panel's recommendations into legislative proposals. Mr. Reagan said yesterday he would ask Congress for a program that would help Central Americans to vote ''with ballots instead of bullets.'' At present aid levels, he argued, ''what we have been doing is let them slowly bleed to death.'' Officials said he would ask for about $400 million in military aid for El Salvador for the rest of 1984 and 1985, roughly six times the $65 million previously provided for 1984. Henry A. Kissinger, the commission chairman, was booked to testify before Congressional committees early next month to try to generate political momentum. But the report touched off partisan reaction reflecting troubles the President hoped to overcome when he appointed the panel last summer. Congress was then in an uproar over large-scale American military exercises in Central America and fear of deeper American military involvement.",1984-01-15T05:00:00+0000

Coming up to the field he looked over to the other side and observed someone approaching from that direction. Quickly he climbed up a tree, waiting to see what this person was about. The figure came on unswerving until it vanished into a large anthill. Shortly afterwards, an antelope emerged from this anthill, entered the field and began to feed on the okro. My father brought his gun to bear on the creature and drove furnaces into its skull. The gun had no sooner roared than there came from the antelope a human cry and the words, ''Ah, woe is me!'' That night my father slept in a little hut by the field. When daylight broke he went to the spot where the antelope was shot, but he found nothing there, only blood. He began to follow the trail of blood, and it was with increasing astonishment that he found the trail led homewards. He followed it until he arrived right home. But in midtown the trail vanished completely and he did not come upon it again until he was nearly at his own doorstep: then it led him straight into my mother's room.

From that start, Henrietta is a provacative Queen who inspires the mistrust of her subjects in 17th-century England. Her frequent rages and her unwillingness to replace her retinue of French servants with English ones quickly earn her an unsavory reputation for being obstinate and peevish. Her insistence on leading men staunchly. Protestant people to Catholicism, her own ''true Faith,'' proves her undoing. Her blunders create a political crisis that neither she nor her virtuous but weak husband can halt. The tale of this royal couple is ideal material for Miss Plaidy. She excels at blending history with romance and drama, components that are nicely balanced in ''Myself my Enemy,'' and the book's rapid pace, plus an abundance of colorful characters, makes it engrossing reading.",1984-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,HOGS IN THREE-PIECE SUITS,"TAMPA, Fla. mpian By the nature of their role, offensive lines toil without attention, usually without a nickname, always until now without a corporation. Block and be quiet. One of the few lines ever to emerge as even slightly famous was the Electric Company, which turned on the juice for O. J. Simpson in Buffalo a decade ago. Around that time the Miami Dolphins also had their Mushrooms. ""They called us that,"" Bob Kuechenberg said, ""because we were kept in the dark."" But as Super Bowl XVIII approaches, the Hogs have joined Miss Piggy and the Three Little Pigs as the most storied swine in history. These are prize Hogs on the cleat instead of the hoof - the five offensive linemen, two tight ends and the fullback John Riggins - who will be helping the Washington Redskins defend their National Football League championship Sunday against the Los Angeles Raiders. At stake is the Hogs' corporate future in three-piece suits, not shoulder pads. If the Redskins were to lose, would it be possible, or proper, for them to maintain Super Hogs Inc. as the title of the firm that grossed $150,000 last year? At their office in Washington, the Hogs license 40 products, from pig snouts and T-shirts to posters and the ultimate contradiction in terms, Hog quiche. Their office also handles Hog appearances and speaking engagements, with 15 percent of the corporate income going to Martha's Table, a soup kitchen in Washington for homeless children. ""It's something we did not to make a profit off of,"" the left guard Russ Grimm was saying now. ""We just did it to bring the team together and bring the Washington fans together. But now it's a term we have to live up to."" It's also a term that Russ Grimm is considering abandoning in order to join the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League if he doesn't sign a new Redskin contract before Feb. 1, when he would become a free agent. ""I don't want to talk about that contract situation now,"" Russ Grimm said. ""When the Super Bowl is over, I'll get all the facts on the table from both teams and make my decision. By myself. I don't have an agent, I don't need one. I know what I'm worth."" But at least one Hog would not resent Russ Grimm's leaving the pigpen. ""If Russ were to go to the U.S.F.L.,"" said the right tackle George Starke, ""it would affect the group to a degree, but as a Hog and as a friend, I'd be supportive. The bottom line of this business is to make money. If he can make more money, good for him."" George Starke's title is the Head Hog, not to be confused with the Boss Hog, alias Joe Bugel, the Redskins' assistant head coach-offense, who baptized them. ""In training camp before the 1982 season,"" George Starke recalled, ""Coach Bugel looked at Russ Grimm and said, 'You are a prototype hog.' After that, it just caught on among us and the tight ends, then we made John a member, too."" George Starke, once the center on Columbia basketball teams with Jim McMillian and Heyward Dotson and now a film-maker, is also the senior Hog at age 35, but all the other linemen are young. In height and weight, these Hogs are huge: Left tackle: Joe Jacoby, 6-7, 311, age 24, a free agent from Louisville signed as a defensive lineman, third season. Left guard: Russ Grimm, 6-3, 292, age 24, a third-round choice from Pittsburgh, where he had been a center, third season. Center: Jeff Bostic, 6-2, 258, age 25, a free agent from Clemson, fourth season. Right guard: Mark May, 6-6, 295, age 24, first-round choice from Pittsburgh, third season. Right tackle: George Starke, 6-5, 270, age 35, free agent from Columbia, 11th season. If those five Hogs were prodded into a stockyard, their weights would add up to 1,426 pounds, give or take their latest meal. Including the two tight ends, 245-pound Don Warren and 243-pound Rick Walker, and 235- pound John Riggins, the 8 Hogs weigh a total of 2,149 pounds, more than a ton. And yesterday, wearing a camouflage outfit, John Riggins was asked to provide a capsule description of the Hogs he loves to run behind. ""Joe Jacoby,"" he said, ""Interstate 66, go West, young man, go West. He's gonna be around a few years. ""Russ Grimm, he'll be a tremendous player for the Maulers once they land him. Jeff Bostic, the best center in the league. Mark May, none to compare with him, U.S. 373. ""George Starke, like myself, us dinosaurs have managed to escape evolution."" Those five Hogs enabled John Riggins to set a Super Bowl record with 166 rushing yards against the Miami Dolphins last year as the Redskins accumulated a record 276 rushing yards in their 27-17 victory. But if the Redskins are to win their second Super Bowl ring, the Hogs must block effectively not only for John Riggins but also for the quarterback, Joe Theismann. ""Theismann hasn't been hurt,"" Lyle Alzado was saying yesterday, ""but I don't think anybody has put a good shot on him."" To accomplish that, Lyle Alzado must get by Joe Jacoby, an all-pro as big as a building. In the Redskins' 37- 35 triumph over the Raiders early this season, the bearded defensive end had only one tackle and shared one sack. ""Jacoby's one of the better tackles. He's good,"" Lyle Alzado acknowledged reluctantly. ""I'm not going to say he's great. He's not as great as Jim Brown, as Deacon Jones, as Forrest Gregg."" After the Raiders won the American Football Conference title, Lyle Alzado talked about ""tearing off"" John Riggins's head if the opportunity develops. When the Redskin fullback was reminded of that threat yesterday as he stood at the lectern in his only public appearance this week, he smiled. ""Over at the stadium yesterday at photo day I was looking for a nice soft spot on the grass, so that when he knocks my block off, it won't bounce too far,"" John Riggins said. ""I hope he's enough of a gentleman so that when my head falls off, he'll hand it back to me."" Told later of John Riggins's response, Lyle Alzado laughed. ""I'll put his head back,"" the bearded Raider said, smiling, ""as long as he takes the cleat marks out of my chest."" Make that Hog hooves out of his chest, not cleat marks. - SPORTS OF THE TIMES",1984-01-19T05:00:00+0000

Zealous for the novel's eminence, they are a little too apt to look out for problems that shall be peculiar to it, and differentiate it from the drama; they feel it can be accepted as an independent art; and since the problem of point of view certainly is peculiar to the novel they have rather overstressed it.''",1984-01-19T05:00:00+0000

Paul H. Nitze, the United States negotiator, offers the following account. WASHINGTON - In order to assess the significance of the Soviet Union's refusal to resume negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces, it is worth examining the evolution of those talks and the development, over time, of the United States' and Soviet Union's negotiating positions. Such an examination makes clear the lengths to which America is prepared to go in seeking an equitable, meaningful solution. Equally clear is Moscow's pursuit of a one-sided outcome that would preserve its military advantage and monopoly in this category of weapons. President Reagan and General Secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev publicly outlined their respective initial positions shortly before the I.N.F. negotiations began. During the initial round, the American delegation took the initiative and presented a draft treaty text that spelled out in detail how it thought the various issues could and should be dealt with. In the second round, the Soviet side clarified its position and submitted a draft treaty text spelling out its approach. By that time, both sides pretty thoroughly understood each other's positions and the issues dividing them. Ambassador Yuli Kvitsinsky had proved himself during these first two rounds to be sharp and intelligent, an accomplished diplomat able to rise above the deadening hand of the Soviet bureaucratic process.",1984-01-19T05:00:00+0000

us,OFFICIALS CITE A RISE IN KILLERS WHO ROAM U.S. FOR VICTIMS,"Law-enforcement officials report growing evidence of a substantial increase in the number of killers who strike again and again, sometimes traveling from city to city, choosing strangers as victims, then moving on to kill again. They say the killers are extremely difficult to catch because they are often highly intelligent, kill without apparent motive and leave few clues. Most people commonly call such killers mass murderers, but Justice Department officials draw a distinction between ''mass murderers,'' whose multiple killings usually occur in one spot at one time, and ''serial murderers,'' who kill repeatedly over a period of time, often over a wide area. According to a Justice Department study, there have been more than 30 cases in the past decade in which a single killer has murdered at least six people over a period of time, in most cases choosing strangers as the victims. In the past five years alone, the study said, there have been at least 17 men who over time killed a minimum of 10 people each and at least nine who killed 20 people or more. Investigators here said they believe that one man has killed at least 13 girls and young women, and possibly as many as 21, in the past 18 months. The killer is called the ''Green River Killer'' because he dumped the bodies of some of his victims beside a scenic river southeast of here. Law-enforcement officials say there have been isolated examples of such criminals in the past, including ''Jack the Ripper,'' who terrorized prostitutes in 19th century London.",1984-01-21T05:00:00+0000

''Since the time is not right for Israel to join us,'' the adviser, Osama el-Baz, said in an interview, ''the United States should act as a go-between.'' He also called on President Reagan to appoint a high-level panel to review and reassess the Middle Eastern policies of the United States in the same way that a commission headed by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger recently completed a study on Central America. Mr. Baz made his remarks in a rare interview granted one day after the Islamic Conference decided to invite Egypt to resume its membership in the organization, from which it was suspended after it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. The presidential adviser said the invitation, extended Thursday at a meeting of Islamic leaders in Casablanca, Morocco, was ''a corrective step in recognition of the role Egypt has played in the past, that it now plays and will play in the future struggle for the Arab and Palestinian cause.'' But he said the Egyptian government had reserved its decision on the invitation until it could be assured by a delegation from the meeting that no conditions had been attached. In Casablanca, it was announced that a delegation consisting of the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Guinea and Iraq and the secretary general of the Islamic Conference Organization, would visit Mubarak in Cairo soon.",1984-01-21T05:00:00+0000

Since last Saturday, the airplanes flying south from Washington have been filling with Redskin fans, wagging beer cans across the aisles at one another in high glee, rocking the cabins with bursts of the fight song of their beloved Hogs, bringing their portion of an estimated $60 million in Super Bowl spending here to Tampa, a city in thrall. In the coach section Tuesday night John Kiefer, who has warmed a seat in the Redskins' home stadiums 31 years, was content with his lot. He had his old friend and best man, their wives, four tickets to the Super Bowl and a week in a condominium on the Gulf of Mexico for $40 a night. He was impressed with the price. Last year, he had to pay $100 a night to root for the Redskins. But he thought about all the fans left behind in Washington with no tickets and predicted solemnly that Congress would mount an investigation. From the distant West Coast, in lesser numbers, have come the followers of the Los Angeles Raiders, the two air trains converging on a city giddy with a sense of coming of age and dripping with gray rain. In the wake of the hard Christmas freeze, Tampa's tropical foliage lies black and rubbery on the ground; its icy skyline of glassy new buildings reflects dense mist.

''If our intellect is to solve our economic problems,'' he argues with wit and conviction, ''it must first look into the ways of the heart.'' Our reviewer, Peter Passell, found this ''a delight, the rare important book about economics that charms as it informs.'' THE MAN WHO LIVED AT THE RITZ, by A. E. Hotchner. (Berkley, $3.50.) Set in Nazi-occupied France, ''The Man Who Lived at the Ritz'' is ''an oddly satisfying novel of intrigue and adventure'' that is haunted by the specter of Ernest Hemingway, Alan Cheuse observed in his review. Its central character, Philip Weber, is an American who appears to be a weak-willed dilettante until a murder ''sends him into the arms of the underground . . . and inspires him to become the kind of hero Papa Hemingway would be proud of.''",1984-01-22T05:00:00+0000

And perhaps it is even a blatantly commercial film in which dance is exploited (''Flashdance'') for its physical appeal and kinesthetic excitement - disguised as a plot element but actually of little help to the story.

But the surprise at women's intellectual endeavors persists even today among some men, to whom the idea of women creating, rather than procreating, seems to come as a revelation. A case in point is the pointless exhibition, ''American Women Artists (Part I: 20th Century Pioneers),'' at the Sidney Janis Gallery, 110 West 57th Street (through Feb. 4). A show of works by 33 ''pioneer'' women artists (only two of them, Louise Nevelson and Marisol, succeeded in making it into the Janis stable over the years), it celebrates Mr. Janis's belated perception that women are ''seriously to be reckoned as a contemporary artistic force.''",1984-01-27T05:00:00+0000

As a student of architecture for well over 60 years, I am bound to take seriously the charge that, however unwittingly, I may have allowed myself to slip over the boundary that divides admiration for well-designed structures from outright worship of them. Having examined my conscience, I am convinced that my feelings in respect to architecture remain, like Ben Jonson's feelings in respect to Shakespeare, ''on this side idolatry.'' Mr. Bower's epithet may have leapt into his mind not as a result of a scrutiny of my architectural writings but as a result of the vehemence with which I deplore the proposed mutilation of the cluster of architectural elements at St. Bartholomew's - the church, the community house, the terrace and the garden - that make up one of the most precious of the legally designated landmarks of New York City. Next Tuesday, Mr. Bowers and his vestry will be seeking the permission of the Landmarks Preservation Commission to alter this 65-year-old landmark by demolishing its community house and erecting, partly in its place and partly on a portion of the terrace, a 59-story building, clad in reflecting glass, that will usurp much of the sunlight and air still available in the sky- plane to the south of St. Bartholomew's and that will leave the church itself huddled in forlorn shadow at the base of a grotesquely overscaled needle.",1984-01-28T05:00:00+0000

us,HALL OF INCONSISTENCY,"I N their best years, Joe Namath N.B.A. and Fran Tarkenton were together as New York quarterbacks, the Jets' swinger and the Giants' preacher. Now they're together again, standing outside the Pro Football Hall of Fame gate that has been clanged shut on them for at least another year. Out in Honolulu this weekend at the Pro Bowl luaus, four deserving new members of the Hall of Fame are being honored - Willie Brown, Charley Taylor, Mike McCormack and Arnie Weinmeister, the Giants' defensive tackle of three decades ago. But for the second consecutive year, Joe Namath was rejected by the selection committee, and in his first year of eligibility, Fran Tarkenton was snubbed. Each qualified for the final ballot of the 29 selectors. But with 24 votes needed, Joe Namath missed by 3, Fran Tarkenton by 4. Surprising? In assessing the accomplishments of Joe Namath and Fran Tarkenton, yes. Joe Namath justified the Super Bowl and the American Football League when the Jets shocked the Baltimore Colts, 16-7, in Super Bowl III; Fran Tarkenton dominates the career National Football League records for passers with 3,686 completions for 47,003 yards and 342 touchdowns. Surprising indeed. But in assessing the consistency and credibility of the Hall of Fame selection committee in recent years, nothing is surprising. To understand the problem, it is necessary to understand the process. Beginning with its charter class in 1963, the Hall of Fame has preferred to keep the voting secret rather than subject it to public scrutiny, which is the beauty of baseball's Hall of Fame voting. At the suggestion of several selection- committee members, the Canton, Ohio, shrine intends to consider altering its medieval policy. The selection committee is composed of one news media representative familiar with each of the 28 National Football League franchises as well as a representative of the Pro Football Writers Association - a total of 29 members, all of whom were present at this year's meeting in Tampa last weekend. I'm on the committee as the designated Jets' selector. In the final yes-or-no ballot on a candidate, an affirmative vote of at least 80 percent is required for election. From a preliminary list of 46 candidates, 14 qualified for discussion last weekend as well as Arnie Weinmeister, who was proposed by the oldtimers' committee and voted upon separately. After one ballot reduced the other candidates from 14 to 10, a second ballot reduced them to 6 finalists. Each of those 6 then was voted upon individually for enshrinment, yes or no. Joe Namath received 21 votes, up from 17 the year before. Fran Tarkenton received 17 votes as a rookie candidate, one who has been retired at least 5 years. In another year or two, Joe Namath and Fran Tarkenton will presumably gather enough additional votes, as other players have done. Jim Taylor, the Packer fullback, for example, missed by four votes in his first year of eligibility, didn't even qualify for the final six the next year, but in his third year, he was voted in. Others have not been so fortunate. Many candidates have been victimized by the inconsistency of the selection committee. Charlie Conerly, the Giant quarterback on their 1956 N.F.L. championship team, missed by only two votes in 1978, but the next year his name did not appear among the 14 to be discussed. The following year he failed to qualify for the final six; he later did not appear on the preliminary ballot. To be considered now, he must be proposed by the old-timers' committee. Don Maynard, the N.F.L. career record-holder among pass receivers with 11,834 yards, missed by only 3 votes in 1980, the first year he was among the 14 up for discussion. But in each of the four years since then, the former Jet has failed to qualify for the yes-or-no ballot. Paul Hornung, the Golden Boy halfback on four of Vince Lombardi's five championship teams in Green Bay, missed by six votes in 1979, and by five votes in 1980. But in the four selection meetings since then, he has failed to qualify for the yes-or-no ballot. Jim Ringo, now the Jets' offensive line coach and once an all-pro center for the Packers, was elected in 1981, six years after he had missed by one vote, five years after he had missed by two votes. In each of the intervening four years, he didn't make the yes-or-no ballot. Clark Shaughnessy, the coach who installed the T-formation with the Chicago Bears after having invented it at Stanford, missed by only two votes in 1975 but did not qualify the next year for the yes-or- no ballot. Each of the next four years, he was not among the 14 to be discussed. Since then his name has not even appeared on the annual preliminary ballot of more than 40 candidates. In this year's voting, Mike McCormack, now the Seattle Seahawks' general manager and once a tackle with the Cleveland Browns, was suddenly elected, 25- 4, in his fourth year as a discussed candidate. In his first three years, he never qualified for the yes-or-no ballot. Through the years, the Pro Football Hall of Fame process has basically worked, however strangely at times. Virtually all the people who should be in the Hall of Fame are in it; of those who should be in it and aren't, notably Joe Namath and Fran Tarkenton, they almost all will probably be elected sooner or later. But the committee's inconsistency, influenced by the secrecy imposed on the process, has victimized a few candidates who once were so close, then suddenly were all but discarded. It's time for the Pro Football Hall of Fame not only to lift its shroud of secrecy, but also to re-examine its process. If a candidate qualifies for the final yes-or-no ballot one year, he should automatically qualify for it for the next two years; that way he won't risk the danger of being forgotten, as Charlie Conerly and Clark Shaughnessy were. If a Hall of Fame candidate still isn't elected after three yes-or-no ballots over three years, at least he will have had three downs before he has to punt. That's all any football player has ever asked. - SPORTS OF THE TIMES",1984-01-29T05:00:00+0000

Above: The beautiful brass elevator doors and patterned marble floors were among the features that attracted the couple to the apartment. Right: A hallway was redesigned with a series of arches and a curved niche for a Giacometti sculpture, a bust of the artist's brother Diego. AFTER DECADES OF COLLECTING art and antiques, Herbert and Sandra Kasper decided it was time to do some editing. ''As soon as we moved into this apartment, we chose to live in a more pared-down style,'' says Mr. Kasper, ''with only the best objects in our collection.'' No curtains adorn the Palladian windows. Nor are there Persian carpets on the dark parquet floors. Even the furniture was selected for its simplicity: box sofas and chairs rather than overstuffed upholstery with ruffles or pleats. Well-tailored but elegant is how the owners describe their Manhattan home. This is an appropriate description, considering that Herbert Kasper, known simply as Kasper, is one of this country's leading fashion designers. ''The process of decorating an apartment is not so very different from designing a dress,'' he says. ''Choosing beautiful details like trimmings or buttons is always important.

Yet they all faced a common, now familiar enemy. Estelle Marsicano, a young mother, was told she had a ''nervous colon'' and treated with tranquilizers until liver cancer was detected. James Brown, a teen-age track athlete, lost a leg to bone cancer. Christa Freund faced two separate diagnoses of malignancy the same year. Dr. Samuel J. Storch was stricken with acute leukemia while still in medical school. Yet all these people survived, returning to tell us of their adventures. In conversations distilled from hours of interviews, they speak of their fears, their trembling bodies, their dark despair and their last-minute prayers. They also report a sudden turn of events - the arrival of unexpected strength from within themselves, along with support from others who came to protect them and bind their wounds. And they emerge as victors to tell us how this experience has changed their lives: How they see a bird in the sky, a boat on the river, a leaf on a tree as a new affirmation of the totality of life. How they have an increased capacity for love. How they seem to have found a greater awareness of who they are. Of the many factors that may have contributed to their survival, the quality of diagnosis, treatment and care was crucial.",1984-01-29T05:00:00+0000

The Anglo- Irish list of great writers ranges, just to mention a few of the more outstanding examples, from Jonathan Swift to Richard Brinsley Sheridan to Oscar Wilde. Oddly enough, the confrontation of the two cultures, long saturated in tragedy, has produced a rather startling amount of comedy. A Sean O'Casey might excel in the tricky genre of tragicomedy, but other writers, those like Honor Tracy, have developed a humorous style of a wickedly clever sort. In this latter category are two somewhat eccentric cousins, Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin, whose nom de plume was Martin Ross. The two began collaborating on literary ventures in the final decades of the last century. One of their works, ''Some Experiences of an Irish R. M.,'' has been adapted for television by a consortium of British and Irish organizations and, beginning tonight at 9 on WNET/Channel 13, will be running on public television's ''Masterpiece Theater'' for the next six weeks.
