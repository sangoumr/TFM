Commenting on the capture of this vessel, the NEW YORK HERALD says: Because of the rigidity of French law it was always expected that the seizure would be made by the French navy. It is regarded as fortunate to have a French test case, since there are no issues between France and the United States, while there are issues between Great Britain and the United States. Germany misses an opportunity of twisting the Lions tail over this incident. The feeling among the public is that this is the only satisfactory outcome possible of the Dacia case, in view of the extremely friendly feelings which exist between this country and France. On every side I hear admiration expressed of the extreme wisdom shown by the French nation in resisting the temptation to imitate Germany and some of the neutrals in sending propagandists here to meddle in American international affairs, since the public sentiment here is still fighting capably for the Allies.

Schoolchildren, whose books and satchels were found among debris, were preparing to leave for school when the explosion rocked the apartment building in the Montreal suburb of La Salle at 8:15 a.m. Wind quickly spread the fire from the blast to three adjacent apartment buildings, police said. Two hours later, the fire department declared the fires were under control and the search for victims began. About 100 people were missing, a police official said, as he announced the death toll in the building where the explosion occurred. It housed about 10 families. There were none dead in the adjacent buildings. The middle section of the three-story, U-shaped complex, containing at least 12 apartments was flattened. Two wings of it were heavily damaged by fire from the explosion. Rescue workers  guided by screams and moans  dug into the debris trying to reach an undetermined number who were trapped when the building collapsed with a big boom, according to witnesses.

The play is being adapted by Jeffrey Hatcher (Stage Beauty) from the beloved 1980 novel of the same name by John Kennedy Toole. Alan Friedman called the novel a masterwork of comedy in his review for The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Toole was awarded the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for the novel posthumously; he committed suicide in 1969. Many efforts have been made to adapt the novel. John Belushi, Will Ferrell and Jack Black were among those attached to various film projects that never fully developed. Mr. Offerman will be the first lead in the role, and will move from one outlandish egotist (on Parks) to another. I am simply tumescent at the prospect of assaying the beloved character of Ignatius J. Reilly with our team of magnificent and weird artistic champions, Mr. Offerman said in a statement.

Three of those freed were women, and according to videos and photographs, some appeared to be elderly men. Dawoud Dawoud, an official with the Assyrian Democratic Organization, said that Islamic State fighters were reported to be looting some of the villages they seized along the Khabur River, where many of the hostages were captured. Scores of the captives remain unaccounted for, though Sunni Arab local leaders have been mediating between Assyrian Christian leaders and Islamic State militants to free the rest, officials said. Meanwhile, the United States-led coalition against the Islamic State bombed targets near Hasaka for the third day in a row, according to Central Command. The strikes suggested a stepped-up operation in response to the advance by Islamic State militants that drove more than 1,000 of the Assyrian Christians, a minority in Syria, from their homes.

us,Algeria: Violence Erupts at Protest Over Shale Gas Drilling Project," Protests against hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for shale gas in southern Algeria turned violent over the weekend when the police clashed with demonstrators outside a base run by the American company Halliburton near the town of Ain Salah. Tensions were still running high on Sunday, but no further violence was reported. Antifracking protests against the government oil and gas company Sonatrach and its international partners have occurred almost daily for two months, but had been peaceful until now. Clashes broke out when protesters approached Halliburtons walled compound and burned tires in the roads. The police fired tear gas and detained at least a dozen. About 20 protesters were injured, three of them seriously, according to a local hospital. Algeria, which gets much of its revenue from the export of oil and gas, has been conducting a pilot project to test for shale gas near Ain Salah and announced in December that it was ready to start extracting gas by hydraulic fracturing. Groups that oppose the government have joined the local protesters in Ain Salah to demand a moratorium on fracking, citing environmental concerns. ",2015-03-02T01:19:39+0000

(El Rey) EL REY NETWORK PRESENTS: THE DIRECTORS CHAIR The El Rey network founder Robert Rodriguez interviews Francis Ford Coppola about his inspiration, his reluctance to direct both The Godfather (starring Marlon Brando, above) and The Godfather: Part II, and his struggles with Apocalypse Now. The talk is followed at 9 by The Conversation (1974), starring Gene Hackman as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who has been hired to eavesdrop on a married woman (Cindy Williams) and her lover (Frederic Forrest) by her husband, known as the Director (Robert Duvall). But three people have died because of Harrys work, and now hes worried that two more may soon die. The film received three Oscar nominations but lost for best picture to The Godfather: Part II. Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called The Conversation haunting and bothersome: Haunting because its suggestion that technology has gotten out of hand, though not exactly new, is so convincingly and fastidiously detailed. Its bothersome because Mr. Coppola, the writer as well as the director, has nearly succeeded in making a great film but has, instead, made one that is merely very good. ",2015-03-02T05:32:08+0000

Prosecutors said that the suggestion was impractical, in part because the boat is still covered in blood and broken glass, and that many photographs of it exist. Judge George A. OToole Jr. said he may wish to view the boat himself before making a decision. Also Monday, defense lawyers filed their fourth change-of-venue motion with the court.

And because of the expressiveness and dexterity of Mr. Dujardin and Ms. Bejo  they dance beautifully and also portray emotion with just the right blend of naturalism and melodramatic exaggeration  The Artist is more than a clever pastiche of antique amusements, he wrote.

Its an essay that I suspect will be dismissed unread by a number of conservatives as just the latest iteration of the America the ungovernable/the systemhas failed the president genre popular among liberal writers in the waning days of strugglingDemocratic administrations. (Well, Jimmy Carters, in particular.)

His point is that governance is increasing happening outside constitutional norms, not that it isnt happening at all, and that its happening that way for reasons that are independent of particular chief executives and whose influence neither political party is likely to soon roll back.",2015-03-03T14:58:34+0000

For Turner, the off-duty look they collaborated on was dictated by casting. All the girls are beautiful, he says, so it wasnt about creating characters or turning them into something they are not. For tousled rock-n-roll strands, Turner worked LOreal Professional PLI from roots to ends, letting each models hair part naturally. Pecheux, for his part, was feeling more Chrissie Hynde and less David Bowie with the tattoo-looking designs he created under one of each of the models eyes. Inspired by the clothes, he drew the shape of a star out of the corner of the eye  but we have seen that before, he says. So he began erasing the stars lines until he arrived at a more subtle geometric touch.

So how is it that the Armory Show, which opens its 17th iteration this week, absolutely thrives on Piers 92 and 94  which sit on the West Side Highway at 55th Street, otherwise known as Manhattans Siberia? The secret: its director, Noah Horowitz, who swooped in four years ago to save the fair from what was widely regarded as its hemorrhaging status. At the age of 35, Horowitz, who penned the art-market manual Art of the Deal and is a faculty member at Sothebys Institute of Art, commands expert status in the ways of the contemporary scene, and has made the fair his own. Overall, I think the feeling is of renewed strength to the fair. Weve made a huge emphasis on quality, in the stature of the galleries themselves  and I dont mean just blue-chip galleries, but also young and mid-career ones, too, he explains of his strategy. Since finding its foothold in 1999, the Armory Show, which draws its namesake from the Park Avenue Armory and its inspiration from the 1913 exposition accredited with bringing shock of the new modernism to America, has always emphasized, well, evolution. One of the challenges in the market we operate in these days is things have become very flat, and a lot of things start looking the same, says Horowitz, who stresses his investment in new artists and galleries.

(Starz Cinema) THE DREAMERS (2004) Louis Garrel (top), Eva Green (center) and Michael Pitt (above) portray the points of a photogenic triangle in this drama from Bernardo Bertolucci (Last Tango in Paris) about an American who befriends French twins in Paris during the 1968 student riots. This adaptation of Gilbert Adairs novel The Holy Innocents is disarmingly sweet and completely enchanting, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The sex in this movie is, as measured by the display of body parts and the amount of time the actors spend out of their clothes, more explicit than even the most notorious scenes in Last Tango, he said. But it is hard to imagine a voyeur more benevolent than Mr. Bertolucci, whose eager scrutiny of the eros of the young is, like Jeremy Ironss in Stealing Beauty, less a matter of prurience than of an honest, nostalgic appreciation of natural human vitality.",2015-03-04T06:00:10+0000

Is it punishment, in the form of economic sanctions, and threats, in the form of imminent military action?

Air passes easily through it, Mr. Rothbard said. Any body heat or perspiration you have during the night dissipates.

Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, said that would give Democrats time to decide whether or not they believe they and Congress as a whole should be able to review and vote on any deal the president cuts with the leaders of Iran. The decision merely delays what promises to be an intense debate in Congress over whether Mr. Obama should be able to seal a deal with Iran aimed at blocking it from acquiring nuclear weapons and under what terms.

Indeed, for the contemporary Chinese artist Zhang Huan, whose restaging of Handels 18th-century operatic version of the myth opens for its first U.S. run this week at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the constant of any opera is found in the attention it pays to the human desire. Speaking via an interpreter from his Shanghai studio a few days before the curtain was set to raise, Zhang freely admitted that he initially lacked interest in opera as an art form. Known for large-scale bronze statues of disembodied Buddhas and performance pieces entailing body suits made of raw meat, Zhangs appointment to direct Handels opera in 2009, for the Brussels-based opera house La Monnaie, raised the eyes of both opera and art-world aficionados. I had hoped people not only saw an opera, but also performance art, Zhang says. Semele,' he quickly adds, was my very first opera, and it will be my very last.",2015-03-06T22:35:30+0000

Shayne Oliver, the Hood by Air designer who likely would have rolled in Basquiats circle had he been born 20 years earlier, shares with us the many diverse influences behind his gender-fluid street wear. In an essay focusing on clothes like Olivers, Jon Caramanica traces how rap icons such as Raekwon and Kanye West have influenced not only street fashion, but the runway as well. Weve also dressed some of Frances most talented men in some of the seasons best clothes  proving that some things, like brooding-French-artist chic, never lose their appeal. Elsewhere, Andrew OHagan combs through the male overgrooming epidemic, looking for chaos amid the order; Jody Rosen travels to Ordos, China, one of the worlds most famous ghost towns that wants to be so much more; the artist Pablo Bronstein takes us inside his home in Deal, England, where antique glamour and campy kitsch live in curious harmony; and Marilyn Manson and John Waters test out an urban scooter and one-legged pants, with predictably weird results.

Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, Stark Sands and Adam Driver round out the cast as Llewyns fellow folk singers; John Goodman is a drug-addicted jazzman; and Garrett Hedlund is a Beat poet. And while Llewyns background and antics were inspired by the life of Dave Van Ronk, this is not a biopic, its a Coen brothers movie, which is to say a brilliant magpies nest of surrealism, period detail and pop-culture scholarship, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Isaac, a versatile character actor here ascending to the highest levels of his craft, refuses the easy road of charm. One of the films lessons, as Mr. Scott sees it, is: We are, as a species, ridiculous: vain, ugly, selfish and self-deluding.

The hairstylist Anthony Turner interpreted this as almost Amazonian, he said backstage, by giving the models deep side parts lined up with the outer edge of the brow and slicking hair into long, thick, low ponytails with a blunt edge. By contrast, the makeup artist Aaron de May brought the free-spirited warrior women to life with dewy, pearlescent complexions, glassy lips and a thick swath of opaque white shadow applied with a chopped-up paintbrush to create an erratic edge. The makeup feels like they took something from nature and put it on with their fingers, Leon says. It looks like the girls did it themselves, de May adds.",2015-03-08T17:30:34+0000

Viet Cong guerrillas fired at the U.S. transport planes carrying many of the troops, but apparently the only result was a bullet hole in the wing of a C130 aircraft. No Marines were hurt. South Vietnamese government troops had spent the weekend flushing out Viet Cong guerrillas in the area to make the region around Da Nang as safe as possible for the 3,500-man Marine force to land. But the Marine deployment around the air base could soon lead to the first ground fighting between U.S. combat units and Communist guerrillas in Vietnam. U.S military men have been serving as advisers to South Vietnamese Army and Marine outfits in the field. But until now, there have been no American ground combat formations in South Vietnam. Spokesmen for the U.S military mission in Saigon said the Marines would remain under U.S. control, but their duties would be assigned after consultation with South Vietnamese military officers.

(HBO Signature) ATONEMENT (2007) Saoirse Ronan (above with James McAvoy) received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Briony, a 13-year-old aspiring playwright who accuses the son (Mr. McAvoy) of a family servant  and the lover of her older sister (Keira Knightley)  of a crime in this drama directed by Joe Wright and based on the Ian McEwan novel. Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave play Briony at different times in her life. The main casualty of the films long, murky middle and end sections is the big moral theme  and also the ingenious formal gimmick  that provides the book with some of its intensity and much of its cachet, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. As the title suggests, Atonement is fundamentally about guilt and the attempt to overcome it, and about the tricky, tragically imperfect power of art to compensate for real-life crimes and misdemeanors. The film received six more Oscar nominations, including one for best picture, and won for Dario Marianellis score, featuring the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet and a clacking typewriter.",2015-03-09T04:26:10+0000

This aspect of the war received new emphasis from Mr. Lloyd George in his speech in introducing the Amending Defence of the Realm Bill in the House of Commons this afternoon. The Chancellor said it is of vital importance to the country that the Government should be given every facility for the output of munitions of war.

Since then, hes collaborated with Mos Def, signed with the U.K. label Domino, opened for Solange and been featured on her Saint Heron compilation album.

The term African music is so overused, Ilunga says, to the point that when some people say it, it just sounds cheesy. Noirwave was always meant to include clothing, art, photography, music obviously  all types of things. Its taking the Africa that we know, turning it upside down and bringing people a new black.

Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman, above) returns to Broadchurch to hear what she assumes will be his guilty plea. But then he declares his innocence, forcing a courtroom battle that will re-examine the case.

Season 2 is, from the start, an entirely messier, more contingent affair, enjoyable in a different and, to me, more appealing way, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. Having Joe plead not guilty enables Chris Chibnall, the shows creator and writer, to keep all the central characters of Season 1 around without the usual implausibility of plunging the town into a new mystery. Its also a device to get Ms. Colmans Ellie Miller back into the center of the story  where she once again steals the show.

I mention this not to pitch myself as a reliable Nobel handicapper but to point out the futility of ascribing any politically correct left-wing bias to the Swedish Academy, since at least three of those favorites  Bellow, Naipaul and Vargas Llosa  are about as politically correct as Margaret Thatcher. All three have been identified with the cultural and political right, none more so than Vargas Llosa, who ran seriously for the presidency of Peru and who to this day is probably, partly through the opinion columns he publishes in Spains El Pas, the Spanish languages most prominent conservative intellectual.",2015-03-13T14:59:06+0000

When it comes to fiction, this passion can often result in rhetoric-spouting characters whose sole purpose is to service the authors ideas. But in The Illuminations, the Scottish novelist and critic Andrew OHagan has created a story that is both a howl against the war in Afghanistan and the societies that have blindly abetted it, and a multilayered, deeply felt tale of family, loss, memory, art, loyalty, secrecy and forgiveness.",2015-03-13T14:59:06+0000

The most interesting facet of Reif Larsens 600-plus-page novel, I Am Radar, is that it reads like something far more compact than its bulk might suggest. There are maps, diagrams and pictures (e.g., an elephant plummeting from a bridge, a Cambodian prisoner of the Khmer Rouge) that remind one of the visual arrangements in W.G. Sebalds novels. Then there is a deeply patterned narrative that darts easily from small-bore domestic dramas to sweeping historical catastrophes with just the right fillip of silliness and levity to keep the whole text eminently approachable.",2015-03-13T14:59:14+0000

During that long first act, Kanon worked with fiction writers including Muriel Spark, Louis Auchincloss, Frank Conroy and Jayne Anne Phillips. But he never dreamed of writing a novel himself, he told an Australian newspaper in 2009. I didnt have manuscripts secretly in the bottom drawer, he said. Honestly, I didnt. I was happy in publishing. I was in the service of other peoples books. The last thing you want is to be in competition with your writers. That all changed after Kanon left the industry in the mid-1990s, when he vacationed in New Mexico and was struck by the idea for a crime novel set during the Manhattan Project. I never told anyone I was doing it, he said. I didnt even tell my wife. I didnt know if I could do it. What could be more embarrassing than a publisher who couldnt write?",2015-03-13T14:59:20+0000

A far cry from Henry Jamess Isabel Archer, Flannery  like many of her generation and station  is on the lam from both her middle-class, middlebrow roots and the lifestyle-driven superficiality carefully honed by her onetime college friends. She has settled in Nigeria less because her work as a climate-change scientist has repercussions for local farmers and more because its a few continents away from her sister, Molly, an emotional tar pit for whom Flannery served as a surrogate mother during the years when the girls actual mother was slowly, grotesquely deteriorating from Huntingtons disease.",2015-03-13T14:59:20+0000

The talks were abruptly scheduled at the invitation of the Cubans. The United States will be represented by Roberta S. Jacobson, Washingtons top diplomat for the Americas. Ms. Jacobson will travel to Havana on Sunday, and a senior official at the State Department said she would probably stay until midweek. No announcements were expected, but the sides planned to discuss issues holding up plans to reopen embassies before a regional summit meeting in April. Cuba wants to be removed from the State Departments list of nations that sponsor international terrorism and seeks access to banking for its diplomatic posts in the United States. American officials are pushing for an increase in the number of staff members at the planned American Embassy in Havana and unrestricted travel for diplomats on the island.

Tammys journey, as they like to say in movieland, is into self-worth, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this road movie, written by Ms. McCarthy with her husband, Ben Falcone, who directed. Yet the far more interesting trip here, at least until her self-actualization kicks in, is through an America of lousy jobs, tyrannical bosses, nickel-and-diming poverty and real-looking women. The jokes about Tammys appetite register as both tedious and borderline desperate, Ms. Dargis added, and suggest that Ms. McCarthy may not yet be comfortable in her own skin on screen. But the radicalness of Ms. McCarthys success, she added, is that shes a beautiful, funny, wildly popular female comic with terrific timing, movie star presence and oodles of charm.

It is not, he said, just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. Then, after a pause, he added, And we shall overcome.

THE ROYALS Elizabeth Hurley and Vincent Regan portray the foul-mouthed Queen Helena and bewildered King Simon, the rulers of a decadent if fictional British dynasty in this nighttime soap, the networks first scripted series. Leading their unruly brood is Prince Liam (William Moseley, above center, with Ms. Hurley and Mr. Regan), the heir apparent after his older brother dies, who angers his mother by sleeping with the daughter (Merritt Patterson) of the queens head of security. Princess Eleanor (Alexandra Park), meanwhile, likes to drink, take drugs, seduce servants and bodyguards, and party in Paris nightclubs without any underwear. The Royals should be a hoot, but it actually gets old, and dull, very quickly, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. It turns out that campy faux queens and princes cant keep up with the real-life Elizabeth II and her progeny  or with reality show royals. The Season 10 opener of Keeping Up With the Kardashians  in which Kim and her husband, Kanye West, have sex in a bathroom, and family members act as if nothing were going on with Bruce Jenner, despite his ponytail and changing face  leads in at 9. Of the two series, the Kardashians are better at keeping up appearances, Ms. Stanley added. The monarchy has survived in Britain for so many centuries partly because it protects its mystique and doesnt bend to reality. The Kardashians have held onto their perch on cable television for 10 seasons for much the same reason. ",2015-03-15T05:00:11+0000

Responding, in part,to the critics of my colleague David Brookss earlier column on morals and the social fabric, I made the case that there just hasnt been the kind of significant increase in privation (or the kind of cuts to welfare programs; quite the reverse) that some writers on the left invoke as an explanation forwhy todays poor and working class Americans are so much less likely than in prior eras to have children within wedlock and stay married when they do. Instead, notwithstanding all the burdens they bear and challenges they face, downscale Americans have somewhat more income and a much stronger safety net than their grandparents and great-grandparents did. So as much as economic burdens clearly play a role in family instability, and would be plausible explanations for the existence of a persistentrich-poor family-structure gap, they seem like weaker explanations for why out-of-wedlock birth rates have gone up so rapidly over the last half-century, not only among the underclass but increasingly in Middle America as well.",2015-03-17T15:38:27+0000

This tender, rich one-act fairy-tale opera tells of a young princess who has been raised by her overprotective father so that she does not realize she is blind, though something about her constricted world seems off to her. Ms. Netrebko brings an engrossing combination of aching vulnerability and vocal charisma to Iolanta. The whole cast is excellent. Best of all may be the glowing, warm playing that the conductor Emmanuel Villaume draws from the Slovenian Philharmonic Orchestra. (Anthony Tommasini)",2015-03-19T17:05:04+0000

us,Suzan Frecon: Oil Paintings and Sun,"Suzan Frecon came to Minimalism late, but she has persisted and her work has a deeper, quieter kind of originality: a sense of unassailable integrity and the fullness of form. Now in her early 70s, Ms. Frecon has for over three decades been homing in on one or two simple shapes seen against one color. Her newest paintings have two panels whose division forms a kind of horizon line, while the shapes themselves imply curved hillocks, small mountains, crystalline ponds, low-hanging clouds and rising or setting suns. Despite the use of Sun in this shows title, her colors, which she grinds and mixes herself, tend toward dark. Rust, blues and greens prevail here with results that seem like nocturnes. They combine Rothkos color at its most winey and most somber with the carefully modulated geometries of Ellsworth Kelly, but are always clearly handmade, painted with a meditative quality that evokes Morandi.",2015-03-19T21:07:30+0000

The National Snow and Ice Data Center, a government-sponsored research group, said that in late February ice cover in the Arctic Ocean reached its maximum extent, 5.61 million square miles, which is about 7 percent less than the average from 1981 to 2010 and about 1 percent less than the previous lowest year, 2011. The center said that changes in the jet stream created warmer than normal conditions on the Pacific side of the Arctic. While the extent of Arctic sea ice is naturally variable, it has been generally declining over the past several decades as the region warms more quickly than other parts of the planet.

Lehane remains closely identified with his native Boston, but this historical thriller  which continues a series about the fictional gangster Joe Coughlin  is set mostly in Florida and Cuba, while Lehane himself moved to Southern California a year and a half ago. He recently told The Hollywood Reporter that he was sorry to miss his hometowns record snowfall this winter. Bostonians, for better or worse, tend to like hard things, he said. You dont really feel like something is fully worthwhile unless its hard-earned. Its that sense of working-class pride, which, yeah, can be kind of annoying but can be really cool. So when I saw my friends emailing about getting the snow record, I thought, What a bunch of sick bastards, but I really dig it. Im jealous Im not there, in a way. Lehane added that his pleasure reading these days is confined to childrens books. The go-to guy is Mo Willems, he said. Anyone outside of the childrens world has no idea who Mo Willems is. I didnt. But anyone who has kids, he literally takes you from the very first book to all these great books Im reading with my 5-year-old. Hes the Dr. Seuss of our time.",2015-03-20T16:00:22+0000

Produced by Lena Dunham, whose friendship with Knight began through her love of Eloise, the six-year-old resident of the Plaza Hotel whose antics were featured in a series of childrens books first published in 1955, the film creates a portrait of a man whose life and art are completely intertwined. Over 35 minutes, it traces Knights childhood as the son of two illustrators, the creation of Eloise, his creative tussles with the Eloise writer Kay Thompson and a post-Eloise career thats included work for Vanity Fair, the publication of his own books and the illustration of posters for Broadway shows like Gypsy. Most compelling are the scenes of Hilary moving through his magically curated home, decorated with staged bird nests, an underwater-themed bathroom and countless pieces of his parents work, dressing up in a full gorilla suit or directing a short musical film in his backyard.",2015-03-20T16:45:49+0000

And it has stars, she added  among them, Mr. Brownlee, who made a dashing Almaviva, singing with a focused, ardent tenor; Ms. Leonard, a pitch-perfect Rosina, cute but sharp-clawed; and Mr. Maltman (above right, with Mr. Brownlee and Ms. Leonard), who oozed sex appeal during his opening aria, Largo al factotum, wearing a magnificent red Phrygian cap like a royal insignia.",2015-03-22T06:58:52+0000

Although the State Department insisted that employment of the short-lived gas was not inhumane or internationally illegal, the use of the gas  with all its flesh crawling connotations of horror  may spark worldwide protests and give the United States a monumental propaganda black eye. The Soviet Union seized upon the gas issue immediately for a blast at the United States, with Moscow Radio charging the United States with using increasingly barbarous methods  in particular waging chemical warfare. It was unclear precisely what kind of gas was being used, but it apparently is the type, effective for about two hours, which causes tears, nausea, sneezing, coughing, nose, throat and chest discomfort or pains. The gas being used is not of the killing, stunning or nerve-affecting types.  New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, March 23, 1965",2015-03-22T17:15:28+0000

Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) is a gangster in Harlem who finds that he can get the best heroin cheap from Southeast Asia, smuggled to the United States in the coffins of American soldiers sent from Vietnam. He calls the heroin Blue Magic and takes over the market. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is an obnoxiously honest New Jersey detective. When his partner (John Ortiz) dies from an overdose of Blue Magic, Richie is asked to lead a drug trafficking task force. A corrupt New York detective named Trupo (Josh Brolin) bridges the gap between the two lead characters. You can almost feel Mr. Scott trying to coax the material away from its generic trappings toward something rarefied, something like Francis Ford Coppolas 1972 definitive American story, The Godfather, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. He comes closest to that goal with the suggestion that the lethal pursuit of the American dream is not restricted to one or two families  the Corleones, say, or the Sopranos  but located in a network of warring tribes that help to obscure the larger war of all against all.",2015-03-24T05:00:11+0000

us,Many Will Need to Repay Health Subsidies,"Half of the households that received subsidies to help pay health insurance premiums last year under the Affordable Care Act will probably have to repay some of that money to the federal government, according to a new analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The foundation also predicted that 45 percent of households that received subsidies will probably get a refund, because their 2014 income was lower than what they estimated when they applied for coverage. Under the law, people can receive subsidies to help cover the cost of insurance purchased through online marketplaces if they earn between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Taxpayers generally receive subsidies in advance, with the amount based on their projected household income for the year the insurance policy will be in effect. But they must then reconcile the estimate with their actual income when filing federal taxes. Kaiser estimated that subsidy recipients who underestimated their incomes will owe $794 on average, while those who overestimated will receive average refunds of $773. ",2015-03-24T07:00:10+0000

The United States joined the effort to defeat a Russian proposal that would have invalidated the benefits expansion, which Secretary General Ban Ki-moon approved last July. Under the expansion, gay and lesbian employees are entitled to the same marriage benefits as heterosexual employees if they were wed in a jurisdiction that considers their union legal. Previously, gay and lesbian employees were granted benefits only if their home countries deemed such marriages legal. ",2015-03-25T01:32:56+0000
us,Greece: Ex-Official Avoids Prison," A former finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, was found guilty on Tuesday of tampering with a list of about 2,000 Greeks with Swiss bank accounts, but he was spared prison time. A court found that Mr. Papaconstantinou, 53, had removed the names of three relatives from the list. The list was given to him in 2010 by Christine Lagarde, then the French finance minister, in an effort to help curb tax evasion. The court reduced the first charge against him, doctoring a document, to a misdemeanor from a felony, and imposed a one-year suspended prison term. He was cleared of a second charge of attempted breach of faith. The failure of the authorities to investigate the so-called Lagarde list, a potential source of much-needed tax revenue, fueled widespread anger in Greece during years of austerity.

us,Canada: Role Against ISIS to Grow," Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked Parliament on Tuesday to extend and expand the countrys military mission against Islamic State militants by another year. Canadas involvement in the operation, which began last October, was scheduled to last just six months and has consisted of airstrikes against the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in Iraq and the use of troops for training and support in Iraq. Mr. Harper said that he wanted to extend the air forces role to include strikes on targets in Syria. Opposition lawmakers say that Mr. Harper did not fully reveal the extent of the ground troops role last year. The criticism increased this month after Kurdish forces mistakenly killed a Canadian military adviser in Iraq. Opposition leaders said that they did not support the extension, but Mr. Harpers Conservatives hold a majority in the House of Commons. ",2015-03-25T01:40:01+0000
us,Egypt: Forensics Official Dismissed," Egypts Medical Forensics Authority on Tuesday dismissed its spokesman after he said last week that a poet and activist killed by police birdshot had died from her wounds only because she was too thin. State news media reported Tuesday that the Justice Ministry was opening an investigation to determine whether or not it was true that more body fat might have obstructed the pellets that pierced her heart and lungs, the injuries that coroners said had caused her death. The poet and activist, Shaimaa el-Sabbagh, 31, was taking part in a march to lay flowers in Tahrir Square on Jan. 24 when the police fired birdshot and tear gas from a few yards away. Prosecutors charged a police officer with a form of manslaughter in the shooting but have not named the officer. The spokesman for the medical examiner, Hisham Abdel Hamid, said in a television interview on Saturday that other marchers that day survived similar blasts of birdshot but that Ms. Sabbagh died because she was too skinny.

Only after tying the knot with her guest does Rosa Lee learn that he used to be Mac Sledge, a country singer who drank his career to death. This drama  directed by Bruce Beresford and written by Horton Foote, who won an Oscar for best screenplay  follows Macs relationships with his ex-wife (Betty Buckley), his daughter (Ellen Barkin), his new bride and her son, weaving them into a sadly contemporary vision of family life and heading toward a final note of affirmation, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. This is a small, lovely and somewhat overloaded film about small-town life, loneliness, country music, marriage, divorce and parental love, and it deals with all of these things in equal measure.

The 16-mile-long island of extravagant mansions, tony retailers and fanciful landscaping is rich in history and significant landmarks, from the magnificent Mar-a-Lago estate (completed in 1927 for Marjorie Merriweather Post, now Donald Trumps private club) and the Paramount Theater (a former movie palace that houses a trove of vintage screen star photos) to St. Edwards church (where the Kennedys worshiped) and Greens Pharmacy (where John F. Kennedy enjoyed burgers in the luncheonette). But Palm Beach is also a small gem offering simple pleasures. You can ride a bike anywhere or linger over coffee at a lunch counter and never be more than a block or two from the beach. Even the new Orange Line trolley that shuttles riders between arts destinations in Palm Beach and neighboring West Palm Beach adds a down-to-earth touch to this high-rolling town (and its free!).

I drove down winding roads flanked in midsummer by rich green fields of young barley and dense yellow carpets of rapeseed plants in full flower. Cows clustered in wood-fenced pastures next to neat farmsteads in shades of rust and ocher. On the outskirts of town, across from a road parting dark pine forest, the turnoff to Norways newest prison was marked by a modest sign that read, simply, HALDEN FENGSEL. There were no signs warning against picking up hitchhikers, no visible fences.

Like many young artists then, she identified as a painter, but one with multimedia extensions and futuristic ambitions.

Such styles must be transformed into something personal and contemporary that ideally also survives comparison with its inspiration. In her second solo show at this gallery, subtitled How Iraqi Are You? Hayv Kahraman largely pulls off this difficult feat, building on the refined figuration of Persian miniatures that are part of her Iraqi background. In Ms. Kahramans hands the delicacy and stylization of the source are writ large and on raw linen  evoking the pages of a Persian album  and complicated with allusions to other times, places and styles. The paintings depict pairs and groups of nearly identical women who may or may not be in a harem. Shown in conversation or listening to one of their number, these women have pale skin, gestures and becalmed features that recall both the female subjects of Renaissance painting and the powdered geisha of Japanese woodblocks. Their articulated hands seem puppetlike. Their largely strapless gowns and black bouffants seem of recent American vintage even as the fabric patterns of their gowns elaborate a veritable lexicon of Arabic geometric decoration. Ms. Kahraman has devised several stylizations of her own, especially in the ways the fabrics drape and overlap while remaining flat, and in details like eyebrows and those dark bouffants (which, for viewers of a certain age may recall Lady Bird Johnsons hairdos).",2015-03-26T21:17:20+0000

Much ado about nothing, one of the defense lawyers characterized the two-day trial, and apparently the judges agreed with him. The crew members, who had been held in prison three months, were accused of mutiny after they refused to sail for France from a South American port on the first day of the war. The case was born of an excited imagination, said M. de Moro-Giafferi. The crew has been imprisoned and slandered when all that the men wanted was an equitable judgment. The sailors maintained that they had not mutinied, but had refused to leave port under their captain, whom they considered irresponsible. Several testified they had heard the captain threaten to run his ship aground and demolish it. Politics or war conditions had nothing to do with the refusal, according to the crew.

The onetime California home of Gerald and Betty Ford is a perfect example of this revival; its new owners have kept many of the houses original charms (including a giant portrait of the former First Lady), while adding their own contemporary touches, to create a space thats anything but conservative. Likewise, the purist Mark Haddawy  the co-founder of the retailer Resurrection Vintage and restorer of Modernist houses  has doubled down on his version of 70s California cool by doing very little to his own home in Big Sur. And the fashion reporter and insider Mary Russell, who for many years was as likely to cavort among (and occasionally hop in bed with) her stylish subjects as she was to photograph them, reminisces about Europe in the freewheeling 60s and 70s. Elsewhere, Nicola Del Roscio, the longtime close companion of Cy Twombly, remembers the late painter while creating his own Eden in the hills of Gaeta, Italy; Sarah Lucas, the former rude girl of British art, discusses how she grew up without losing her nerve; Ricky Gervais and Zaha Hadid say yes to sriracha-flavored ketchup and a floor-cleaning robot while lounging in a giant birds nest; the New York magazine co-founder and I Heart NY creator Milton Glaser gets the By the Numbers treatment; and a handful of authors with new books out this year pay tribute to the spaces where they write.
