His face stays frozen in a grouchy grimace while a voice-over drones on about his miserable situation. He's tired of his wife. He's sick of his children. He's thinking of shooting them all this very evening, after dinner. Will he or won't he? The film, which supposedly spans one day but feels like years, has long since dissipated its suspense by the time the moment of truth arrives. The characters seem to have talked one another to death long ago.""Natural Enemies,"" which opens today at Cinema 2, was written and directed by Jeff Kanew, who has had a long career making movie trailers and commercials, a line of work that would seemingly require some verve. There's none in evidence here; instead, he imbues the film with a static, self-congratulatory gloom. All too soon, it becomes unmistakable that Mr. Kanew is not about to let anything brighten Paul Steward's day, and the mood turns into one of painful repetition.The film's only real surprise comes when Paul visits a brothel, where five decorous prostitutes listen to yet another dreary chapter of his story. He has already been glimpsed on the commuter train, making the obvious complaints, and in his office, gazing sadly at his pretty secretary, and enough would seem to be enough. But Paul leaves the brothel and heads back to his office, because his day isn't over yet  in fact, it's only lunchtime. Only lunchtime!""Natural Enemies,"" which is adapted from a novel by Julius Horwitz, is full of material that must surely read better than it plays. ""No one can really understand what happens between a man and his wife  we communicate silently, like cockroaches have for 50 million years . . .,"" Paul intones. At another point, he speaks fondly of his early days with Miriam (Louise Fletcher), in a cold-water flat, when they patronized ""an Italian restaurant where they knew us by our first names. We'd get extra meat sauce just by asking for it."" The cast, which also includes Jos Ferrer, Viveca Lindfors and Patricia Elliott, delivers such lines with a uniform bleakness.

us,Screen: 'Promises In the Dark' Opens:Illness as Disaster,"AS anyone who has ever enjoyed a disaster movie knows, fatal accidents and freaks of nature don't necessarily ennoble their victims. In ""Earthquake,"" when Ava Gardner is swept away in a sewer never to be seen again, we don't weep and wail and gnash our teeth. ""Good riddance to bad rubbish,"" we say, knowing that she is simply a function of the plot.The point of a disaster movie is not its people but its spectacle. We are perfectly aware that when ""Earthquake"" was conceived, the producers began with the idea for a film about a cataclysmic event and more or less worked backward, filling in the story with characters much as one might furnish a basement playroom.In disaster movies as well as in caper movies and most murder mysteries  certainly in the kind written by Agatha Christie  people are important only in terms of events. In other movies we ask for a little bit more. It's this little bit more that is missing from Jerome Hellman's ""Promises in the Dark,"" a sort of small-scale disaster movie, the disaster in this case being the terminal cancer faced by a pretty, 17-year-old West Hartford girl named Buffy Koenig (Kathleen Beller). The movie opens today at Cinema I.Though ""Promises in the Dark"" means to be about the gallant Buffy, about her distraught, middle-class parents (Ned Beatty and Susan Clark) and especially about Buffy's spunky doctor, Alexandra Kendall (Marsha Mason), it's so blandly written, directed and acted that it has the peculiar effect of exploiting the spectacle of Buffy's illness and short-changing the real hardships of the human condition, including the fight against cancer. It's the sort of movie that says, by indirection, that if Buffy hadn't had the rotten luck to get sick, there would have been no point in feeling concern for her.Because ""Promises in the Dark"" has been furnished with stereotypes instead of individuals, it is neither inspiring nor depressing but coyly morbid. Though it pretends to celebrate human courage, it is actually merchandizing it as another kind of earthquake.As if aware that he was creating characters who have passed through a state of extreme ordinariness into banality, Loring Mandel attempts to tone up his screenplay with what in mystery stories would be identified as red herrings.Miss Mason's doctor, whose only function is to diagnose the illness and treat the patient, is presented as a woman who has a lonely private life into which a little sun falls in the shape of a handsome, available male doctor. That may well be true, but the time spent on this subplot has the effect of padding. Buffy and her boyfriend (Paul Clemens) talk about reading, specifically ""Catch 22"" and ""The Golden Bough,"" which, being of an art and an intellect far removed from the movie's, make the characters seem even emptier than they are.Miss Beller has the worst of it, being required to smile bravely when a real first-rate tantrum, or some other form of identifiable despair, would be in order. Little by little, we watch her disintegrate. First her leg is amputated. In the course of chemotherapy, her hair falls out. She wears a wig she calls ""Harry."" The circles under her eyes darken, the general pallor increases. When someone upbraids her for being gloomy, she says, very gently, ""Forgive me. I never died before.""The other performances are no better or worse than the material.At the end of the movie, when ""Promises in the Dark"" raises the question of whether or not patients should be kept on life-support systems after everything else has failed, you might suspect  accurately, I think  that the film itself has been on its own life-support system for far longer than is necessary.""Promises in the Dark,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), is about a subject that might well be disturbing for small children.",1979-11-02T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Running,' Winning and Losing:Marathon Mania","MICHAEL ANDROPOLIS (Michael Douglas) is so afraid of losing that he drops out of everything before the final test. When we first see him, arising one summer morning in a squalid Manhattan furnished room, he has already dropped out of medical school, law school and his marriage of 14 years. There's only one thing he feels he does well  marathon running. Michael's goal: to make the United States running team and compete at the Montreal Olympics.""Running,"" which opens today at the Cinerama 2 and other theaters, is an earnest though not particularly affecting movie about Michael's attempts to come to terms with himself, his ex-wife Janet (Susan Anspach), his two young daughters and his dreams of himself as a champion runner. Steve Hilliard Stern, whose other movies I have not seen, both wrote and directed the film.The chief problem with the screenplay is that although we are told by everyone, including Michael, that he is a loser, it's clear from everything we see that he is a winner as well as a hero. He responds to life in the way that all right-thinking people in the audience know they should respond. He is properly bored with his job as a shoe salesman. He is properly impatient with the red tape at the unemployment office. He is properly skeptical of the Babbit-like, get-up-and-go businessman who hopes to marry Janet. On top of all that, Michael still loves Janet, deeply and unselfishly, which is the way she loves him.""Running"" isn't even very suspenseful when Michael is running in competition. Since it's established that he is an excellent marathon man, we know that he'll make the Olympic team. Though there may be some doubt whether he'll win a gold medal, there's no doubt that, whatever the outcome, he will have proven himself to himself.I suppose the continuing appeal of movies like ""Running"" and ""Rocky"" is that though they seem to be about losing, with concern for losers, they're really about nothing but winning. When one can lose in the way of a Rocky or of a Michael in ""Running,"" one has actually won, which is a most comforting way to look at the whole process of losing. These movies have no patience with real, dyed-in-the-wool losers, with people who fail badly, who persist in blaming others for their own shortcomings, who never learn by their own mistakes and who, when the chips are down, lie and cheat and behave, in general, with cowardly heart.On the strength of ""The China Syndrome,"" Mr. Douglas could well be on his way to becoming one of our best young leading actors. He's a performer of power and intensity, though he has little to do in ""Running"" except run and occasionally look winded.

us,Screen: Rock Drama From a Who Album:Mods and Rockers,"THE results of my (highly) informal survey about ""Quadrophenia"" have been tabulated. They show that most moviegoers think this is either a concert film or a rock opera, or that the title refers to a quadrophonic sound track. Not true. This is a dramatic film, one that's gritty and ragged and sometimes quite beautiful. It happens to incorporate rock songs, and to be saddled with a silly title. Though it's by no means a movie for everyone, ""Quadrophenia"" is something very special. It demands  and deserves  some special allowances.""Quadrophenia,"" which opens today at the Paramount and other theaters, is set in England in 1964, and populated by Mods and Rockers, warring bands of teen-agers who speak with such thick accents that American audiences may find their conversation indecipherable. For this and other reasons, the film  which is a hit in England  hasn't traveled well.But its foreignness has perverse advantages, helping to recast situations that might seem commonplace in an American end-of-adolescence movie, and making them just remote enough to seem fresh. A gifted new director, Franc Roddam, lends the film a clarity of emotion that keeps it from becoming too confusing.The story is derived very, very loosely from an album by the Who. This album was an ambitious undertaking: it described a teen-age boy, Jimmy, who was so acutely sensitive to social pressures that he developed the four-way schizophrenia of the title. Jimmy's condition was illustrated, rather than described, by four separate melodies  one associated with each member of the Who  that eventually merged into one transcendent theme. The specific ending of the album called for Jimmy to swim out to sea and scale an enormous rock. Unfortunately for the current film, which does some floundering at the finale, Ken Russell borrowed that scene for ""Tommy"" several years ago.But ""Quadrophenia,"" as directed and co-written by Mr. Roddam, is perhaps too raw to have culminated with pie-in-the-sky. Jimmy, played by a wonderfully avid-looking actor named Phil Daniels, is a cheerful, unexceptional fellow, by no means the Who's hypersensitive hero. He is seen squabbling with his parents, partying with his Mod friends, working at a mailroom job that's both dead-end and dull. These episodes, which are carried by the boisterous enthusiasm of an excellent cast, combine to form a slice-of-life movie that feels tremendously authentic in its sentiments as well as its details.The Mods-and-Rockers aspect of the story might seem to date the material. But Mr. Roddam is as concerned with the general experience of adolescence as he is with these particular groups of people. And he is able, in recreating the seaside riots between these rival gangs, to capture a fierce, dizzying excitement that epitomizes a kind of youthful extreme. Jimmy, who is so electrified by his new identity as a Mod that he makes a quick, thrilling sexual conquest while the fighting is going on, may never again feel so fully at the height of his powers. ""Quadrophenia"" fills the moment with equal elements of regret and celebration.In a barely memorable shot at the beginning of the story, Jimmy is seen to be walking away from a cliff  a cliff from which, at the end of the movie, he appears to jump to his death. This disastrous attempt at a flashback damages the movie, which finally seems to be concerned with nothing more morbid than the end of this boy's flaming youth. The last minutes of the film are further weakened by some last-minute interjections of the Who's music, which has until now figured into the story more delicately.Images of the group, up until this point, have been ghostly and unbiquitous. Their records play in party scenes; their posters and photographs decorate walls; Jimmy watches the band on television while his parents complain. Jimmy himself looks considerably like the Who's Pete Townshend, and he has the gawkiness that Mr. Townshend has made such memorable use of in the course of his career.When Jimmy, in one of the film's most stunning set-pieces, dives into a crowd of dancers at a seaside resort, as much to vent his frustration as to attract attention, the spirit resembles that of an early Who concert  the kind that concluded with Mr. Townshend's furiously smashing his guitar.Among the fine supporting performances in ""Quadrophenia,"" on a par with Mr. Daniels's superb Jimmy, is Raymond Winstone's Kevin, an old school friend Jimmy runs into in a public bath. When they put their clothes on, Jimmy realizes that his friend has become a Rocker; later, they share a conversation about how important it is to join the right group so you won't be like everybody else. Leslie Ash is suitably heartbreaking and heartless as the most popular of the female Mods, and the actors playing Jimmy's closest friends are affecting, too. The movie includes a hilarious turn by the Ace, the prettiest and surliest blond Mod, who turns out to be a bellhop on the side. The Ace is played by Sting, who is lead singer of a widely praised new band, the Police.",1979-11-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Arthur Miller on Home Ground':The Cast,"""Arthur Miller on Home Ground"" takes a reasonably pleasant and picturesque look at the playwright, who has been filmed and interviewed by Harry Rasky, also responsible for ""Homage to Chagall."" Mr. Miller is visited at his farm, and viewed repeatedly as he strolls through the streets of New York City, where he grew up. ""I love this city,"" Mr. Miller says, several times. Each time he says it, Mr. Rasky provides the same kinds of generalized shots of the skyline. It is possible to feel, after a while, that one is getting at least as well acquainted with the Chrysler Building as with Mr. Miller. The less said about Mr. Rasky's visual ingenuity, the better.The film includes excerpts from movie and television productions of some of Mr. Miller's works, timed to the author's comments on each piece; his observations about the ways ""Death of a Salesman"" continues to affect audiences are particularly acute. There are also clips from ""A View From the Bridge"" (Mr. Rasky provides footage of the Brooklyn Navy Yard) and ""The Crucible"" (shots of primitive-looking New England dwellings in the snow). Mr. Rasky has also filmed new material to illustrate a story of Mr. Miller's, and one soliloquy from ""The Price,"" although neither snippet is much of a success.Mr. Miller, whose manner is affable and whose remarks are consistently interesting, discusses his childhood, his career, his travels and, very briefly, his perception of Marilyn Monroe. Mr. Rasky, who near the end of the film asks Mr. Miller if he personally has indeed paid A Price, keeps most of his questions mercifully brief.The atmosphere of the interviews is businesslike-bordering-on-friendly, which means that when the camera wanders in for a close look at Mr. Miller's art collection late in the film, the intimacy and curiosity come as a mild surprise. The rest of the documentary seems a lot less actively involved with its subject. The film, which is interesting but not particularly insightful or informative, doesn't have the substance of an inquiry, or an explanation. It's the work of a good listener.",1979-11-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie: Losey Brings Mozart's 'Don Giovanni' to the Screen:Philanderer Bar None,"LIKE the legitimate theater and ballet, opera depends on two important agreements with its audience  (1) that its audience remain fixed, stationary and not go wandering around on the stage, poking its nose into the faces of the performers, seeking their bad angles and the zippers in costumes of an earlier age, and (2) that the audience understand (and derive increased pleasure from the understanding) that it's sharing the time span of the performance. At the end of the ideal evening, both the audience and the performers should be equally exhilarated, equally exhausted.It's no coincidence that the two most successful attempts to film a piece of classic theater and an opera have both gone to great length to recall for the motion-picture audience these truisms. I'm thinking, of course, of Laurence Olivier's ""Henry V,"" which guided the movie audience to the play via a reconstruction of a Globe Theater production, and Ingmar Bergman's ""The Magic Flute,"" which also began as a recording of a theatrical production and never for a moment pretended to be anything more than an extension of that production.Both ""Henry V"" and ""The Magic Flute"" are complete movies and both maintain the theatrical disciplines without which the original material flies into hundreds of bits and pieces of artifice alien to the movie screen.In filming Mozart's ""Don Giovanni,"" Joseph Losey, who is nothing if not a film maker of style and intellectual resources (""The Servant,"" ""Accident,"" ""The Assassination of Trotsky,"" among other things), has sought other cinematic means to preserve the acknowledged theatricality of this most lyrical, wittiest, grandest of Mozart's grand operas. Though he has faithfully stuck to the score and to the Da Ponte libretto and has cast it all too fearlessly with singers who have fine voices (and who look like opera singers), Mr. Losey has attempted to find his own equivalent to the disciplines (limitations) of the living theater, not in a soundstage but in lovely real-life landscapes and in and around one of the most handsome houses ever built, the 16th-century Palladio villa near Vicenza in northern Italy. Unfortunately, it doesn't work.This ""Don Giovanni,"" which opens today at the Paris Theater, is marvelous to listen to, even when a singer has difficulty lip-syncing his own voice, and it's pretty to look at, but it may well be utter confusion to anyone who doesn't know the score, or the story of literature's most fearless, most heroic philanderer.It could also reinforce all of the old stereotypes  I think of the Marx Brothers' ""A Night at the Opera""  about opera's being nothing more than a bunch of overaged, overweight people running around and fretting at great volume about minor matters that are never made clear. This is not a ""Don Giovanni"" to make converts. It sings to the already committed.The most obvious difficulty is the singers themselves, among whom only Kiri Te Kanawa as Donna Elvira, the spurned woman who haunts Don Giovanni's desperate life; Edda Moser as Donna Anna, one of the few women the Don fails to seduce, and Jose Van Dam as the frequently distraught servant, Leporello, look and act in a fashion that doesn't make their close-ups embarrassing to watch.The others sing well enough but are extremely odd pictorially. As the Don, Ruggero Raimondi has the necessary weight in his voice but otherwise lacks any evident charm or passion. The camera is especially unkind to Teresa Berganza (Zerlina), Kenneth Riegel (Don Ottavio) and Malcolm King (Masetto). John Macurdy, as the Commendatore, has the easiest time of it, supposedly being made of stone.Still I suspect that none of this would have mattered much if Mr. Losey's overall conception had been successful and evoked a movie world in which we believed. What we have, though, is an essentially urban, highly artificial melodrama played out, for the most part, in the wide open spaces in and around that Palladio villa. People stride purposefully across lawns, in full sunlight, singing their hearts out but headed in no special direction. The entire cast appears to live in that one great house. Nobody ever stands politely still and sings. They're always moving, and if they aren't moving, the camera is. Sometimes a daytime scene comes between two scenes that are set on the same night. Another problem is that the singers who play Elvira and Anna, both beautiful women, look so much alike that we sometimes wonder which is which.Then, too, there are directorial touches to make any ""Don"" aficionado cringe, such as an exchange between the Don and Leporello in the Don's bedroom, with the Don on one side of the bed, Leporello on the other, and, between them, the well-tanned rump of the Don's conquest of the night before. From what we can see of this woman's perfectly sculptured form, she looks as if the Don had picked her up on the Lido and she probably can't sing a note.The movie is framed not by music but by the sounds of lapping waves and a quotaation from the Italian Marxist Grimasci, designed, I suppose, to give significance to the Don's story that Mozart and Da Ponte failed to make evident. Mr. Losey also adds a nonspeaking character in the shape of the Valet in Black (Eric Adjani), a sort of spooky supernumerary who turns up from time to time to clear away props and to hand the Don his mandolin. Instead of fitting into the decor, he rivets attention, being the spitting image of Isabelle Adjani, to whom, I assume, he is related.Though Mr. Losey jazzes up many other scenes, the climactic confrontation between the Don and the Commendatore is surprisingly tepid visually. I've seen better descents into hell at our own Metropolitan Opera and in any number of Hammer horror pictures.Mr. Losey and his associates haven't destroyed ""Don Giovanni,"" but then they haven't illuminated it either. Their film is a busy, disorienting spectacle, superbly sung (and available on a CBS Masterworks recording).",1979-11-06T05:00:00+0000

They were members of the Communist Workers Party U.S.A. and they believed that provoking violence from the Klan might promote socialist revolution. Their slogan was Death to the Klan. It would have been hard, on the basis only of such rhetorical violence, for the police to deny them a parade permit. Yet by allowing them to march, the police created a special responsibility to keep the peace. Not only did the police not take any special precautions; they actually withdrew from the scene. Their excuse was that the marchers did not want protection. But society and the law demand protection in such circumstances. Once the permit was issued, the police should have been on hand, whether they were wanted or not. They might have saved lives.",1979-11-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'The Fish' Offers A Galaxy of Big Names,"A RECORD number of athletes and singers and comedians turn up in ""The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh,"" and still this feels like a movie with nothing going on. The premise, which needed to be outrageous, is merely amiable. The cast is too enormous for individual players to make strong impressions. The tenor of the whole enterprise is tame. The soundtrack music is excellent, but you could listen to that at home.The movie's big joke would have been funnier a few years ago. Julius Erving, a.k.a. Dr. J, is cast as  here's a big surprise  a basketball star. And he's stuck on a losing team. Then the team's nice water boy (James Bond 3d) recommends a nice astrologer (Stockard Channing), and she recommends that he play with teammates who all share the same sign, so the Pittsburgh Pisces are born. Dr. J, who is also seen falling in love with the water boy's sister, does a capable job with his acting duties, as do the other basketball ringers, among them Meadowlark Lemon and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.Astrology isn't the hot topic it used to be, and in any case the screenplay doesn't put it to much use. And the grand, gaudy sequence in which the Pisces appear for their end-of-the-movie game is somehow lacking in comic bravado  bravado like that of Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier in their ""Let's Do It Again"" pimp outfits, for example. There's nothing in this present film, save of course for Mr. Erving's way with a slam-dunk, that doesn't seem to have been done better in another movie long ago.Still, ""The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh,"" which opens today at the National and other theaters, isn't aimed at audiences with much of a memory. It's cheerfully inoffensive entertainment designed for the crowd that liked ""Car Wash,"" with which one of the present film's producers was also involved, and it offers a similarly shapeless brand of merriment.There are some good individual performances, by Mr. Lemon, Mr. Bond, M. Emmet Walsh, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Debra Allen, that don't last long enough to get going. There are hits-to-be written and produced by Thom Bell, and recorded by the Sylvers and the Spinners, among others. There is enough basketball footage to keep the fans' attention from wandering. There's nothing much to remember, and nothing to complain about either.Stockard Channing, Flip Wilson and Jonathan Winters may sound like the movie's big guns as far as comedy is concerned, but each of them gives a flat performance. None of them fits comfortably into the movie, and none of them has been given material worth working with. Mr. Winters has made so few movie appearances in recent years that he may strike younger viewers as a strange fellow who does a not-bad Robin Williams imitation. That's a discouraging thought.""The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains a few instances of vulgar language.",1979-11-06T05:00:00+0000

There are so many finely drawn episodes, so much brittle, raunchy humor, and such an unexpectedly alluring performance from Bette Midler in the title role that the movie maintains its momentum even after it's gone off the track. Its strengths may only be those of a good show-business soap opera, and its structure is disjointed beyond repair. But ""The Rose"" has an earnest, affecting character at its core. Even at its most preposterous, it never feels like a fraud.""The Rose,"" which opens at the Ziegfeld today, seems to have been conceived as both a vehicle for Miss Midler and a way to tell a story like Janis Joplin's. So The Rose  who shares The Divine Miss M's odd habit of incorporating an article into her nickname  emerges as a creature of many contradictions. Although the story is supposedly set in 1969, Miss Midler is so thoroughly a product of the 70's that it becomes hard for her to handle certain aspects of the tale, notably those having to do with Rose's hippie abandon and her essential fragility. Miss Midler herself seems about as fragile as a bull elephant, no matter how stridently the screenplay insists that she eventually self-destruct.This screenplay, which takes the form of a crazy flashback, introduces Rose as a hard-living but weary performer who is agitating for a year's rest as the story begins. However, her manager, played with a fine ruthlessness by Alan Bates, is not a man who believes in allowing his meal ticket to take vacations. So Rose embarks on a series of spiteful, funny escapades, which seem to serve as both distress signals and her only way of letting off steam.Frederic Forrest, who would be the surprise hit of the movie if Miss Midler didn't herself have dibs on that position, plays a chauffeur whom Rose kidnaps on one particularly trying evening. And he has a sweet, stirring exchange with her when she finally hauls him back to her hotel at dawn. He pauses on the front steps to describe an adventure he once had on a Western river, but only one detail interests her. ""Were you really,"" she asks with genuine astonishment, ""alone for six days?""The early part of the story, which is at its most involving in the lengthy sequence that launches this romance, also presents a withering portrait of the music world  much nastier than the image offered by Barbra Streisand's ""A Star Is Born,"" a movie ""The Rose"" resembles in its general blowsiness and enormous scale. One of the most memorable scenes has Rose barging, with an excess of flamboyance, into the dressing room of a country star, superbly played by Harry Dean Stanton. He winds up snubbing her with a cruelty that corresponds, perversely yet perfectly, to her own good-timey style of aggression.But Rose, though temporarily daunted, is still someone who'll crash any party. In fact, her feistiness emerges as one of her most lovable attributes. During this section of the film, she is also seen marching into a homosexual nightclub, a men's bathhouse and a truck-stop restaurant, where a nervous waitress tells her ""We don't serve hippies."" ""Well, that's okay,"" smirks Rose, who loves rising to such occasions, ""cause we don't eat 'em, neither.""These incidents don't have much to do with one another, but they have a certain emotional coherence that is sorely missed once the screenplay begins burying Rose alive. By the time her demurely dressed lesbian lover appears on the scene, it has become painfully clear that if the kitchen sink could walk, somebody would have written it an entrance line, too. Rose's former heroin habit, and her high school misadventure with an entire football team, are suddenly brought into the act, paving the way for a finale that will amaze amateur pharmacologists everywhere. Rose combines heroin and pills into a miraculous potion that, somehow, allows her to belt out a song at the top of her lungs before dying an arty death only seconds later.Mark Rydell's direction, which has been unobtrusively effective until this point, suddenly turns the movie into something very like a wrestling match. Miss Midler succeeds beautifully in giving her character depth and dimension; she may even be a better actress than a singer, on the evidence of her first film role. But she cannot seem to muster the requisite pathos, and after a while one begins wondering why she should. ""The Rose"" may have four-hanky aspirations as a weeper, but Miss Midler has a vitality that belies all that, and makes the gloomy-ending machinations look ridiculous. It's much to her credit that she doesn't go down without a fight.""The Rose,"" which finally becomes paralyzed by the discrepancies between its actress and her character, is full of wall-to-wall anachronisms. If anything, the setting seems more like the present than like 1969  a year, if the movie is to be believed, without psychedelia, hippies, a war, long hair or short dresses. It is also a year without much rock-and-roll, since Miss Midler's singing, however ably it serves the movie's purposes, remains something of a different era.",1979-11-07T05:00:00+0000

Barry Beck can shoot, skate. cnecK and maintain law and order in a sometimes riotous sport. At 6 feet 3 inches and 215 pounds, he is big enough to be a pro football linebacker.

They'd probably pack her off to Dulles Airport in Washington.Unfortunately ""The Shout"" is not about that ordinary Bristol housewife. It's about an unstable fellow named Charles Crossley (Alan Bates) who one day turns up at the English country house of Rachel (Susannah York) and Anthony (John Hurt) and alternately terrorizes and charms them with stories about his life among the Australian aborigines.Charles also practices black magic learned from the aborigines, and it seems to work. When he takes an object from Rachel  in this case her shoe buckleshe falls completely under his spell. When she retrieves the buckle, the spell is broken. In a more dangerous way Charles fascinates Anthony with stories about a shout so piercing that it can kill all who hear it. Anthony, a composer of electronic music and a man always interested in a new sound sensation, challenges Charles to go into the dunes with him and let fly with one of his famous shouts.""The Shout,"" which opens today at the newly remodeled New Yorker Twin 2, is a vivid, piercingly loud movie as well as an almost totally incoherent one. The screenplay by Michael Austin and Mr. Skolimowski is an adaptation of a 1926 short story by Robert Graves. Since I haven't read the story I can't be sure whether the obscurities are Mr. Austin's, Mr. Graves's or those of Mr. Skolimowski, the Polish director of such well received films of the 60's as ""Rysopsis,"" ""Walkover"" and ""Deep End.""The story of the film is told in flashbacks in the course of a cricket match at a mental hospital. The narrator is Charles Crossley himself and the listener, also according to the program notes (though there's nothing in the film to confirm it), is Robert Graves, played by Tim Curry.The story starts off well, like almost any ghost story made up by a child, but then it becomes so full of loose ends, contradictions, cryptic symbols and close-ups of objects that, at the moment, have no meaning, that one eventually tunes out of the narrative, much as one does when the child's ghost story becomes too hopelessly muddled for even the child to unravel.A few things in the movie are clear: the magic we see in the film is real  that is, it works because its victims want it to work; Charles, played by Mr. Bates with the great loony relish he brings to such roles, is brilliant as are some certifiably mad people; Anthony is crazy too, or else he wouldn't be carrying on with a blowsy village girl when he has a wife, in the person of Miss York, at home. Everything else, though, is confusion.""The Shout"" is an elegant looking movie, nicely performed, but because it leaves one knowing less than one did at the beginning, it is easily forgettable. Except for the sound. Apparently to prepare us for the scene in which Charles screams his aboriginal scream, the producers seem to have sharpened or heightened the soundtrack in such a way that even ordinary sounds  the wind, for example  take on a painful sibilance.",1979-11-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Ballad of Orin' Arrives From Japan:A Blind Girl's Tragedy,"""THE BALLAD OF ORIN,"" the Japanese film that opens today at the Cinema Studio 2, is the sort of solemn, perfectly composed, much too artfully designed movie that sends you out of the theater longing to see something rude, crass and sloppy, like ""Car Wash."" It's the work of Masahiro Shinoda (""Double Suicide,"" ""The Scandalous Adventures of Buraikan""), whose pretentiousness has apparently been received with far more favor elsewhere than here. According to the film's publicity notes, ""The Ballad of Orin"" was cited earlier this year at the Los Angeles Filmex as ""a romantic tragedy of the utmost beauty and emotional impact.""Beauty it has  the kind that suffocates. Emotional impact is what it lacks, possibly because one is aware that there's been so much theorizing before each scene, before each camera set-up, that all sense of life has vanished. Mr. Shinoda's idols reportedly are Yasujiro Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi, though the only things he seems to have understood in their works are the surface looks. The grandeur of Mizoguchi's visions appears to be beyond Mr. Shinoda's abilities, as are the humanity and wit that are apparent even in Ozu's most reserved works.""The Ballad of Orin,"" set near the end of World War I, is the sad but picture-postcard-pretty tale of Orin, played by Shima Iwashita (the wife of the director), who, blind from birth, is apprenticed as a child to an itinerant band of blind women singers, known as the goze. The goze, we are told, live according to rules as strict as those that govern geishas. They devote their lives, including their chastity, to their art.When Orin falls from grace after having been ""with a man,"" she wanders alone the length and breadth of Japan, singing for her supper and sleeping with any available fellow. In the course of her travels she is befriended by a young man who insists on accompanying her though he refuses to make love to her. To him she must remain a goddess. After an old peddler rapes Orin, the young man kills him, which means that he's now wanted by both the police and the army, from which he has deserted.Everything goes badly for poor Orin, which is the point of the movie that, I assume, thinks it's making a statement about Japanese society though it looks more like a series of weather reports from Japan's 50 most scenic spots. You've probably never seen so many beautiful mountains, plains, seacoasts and quaint villages, in sunlight, rain, snow and fog, in summer and winter, spring and fall. No matter where he looks Mr. Shinoda finds beauty that simultaneously reflects Orin's essential nature and contrasts with her awful lot in life.Mr. Shinoda's poetic conceits reach some kind of apotheosis (can a conceit be apotheosized?) in a sequence in which the 11-year-old Orin ""becomes,"" as they say, ""a woman."" She and her fellow goze are walking single-file across a great, lovely expanse of virgin snow. Suddenly Orin drops back  she is experiencing her first menstrual period. After a few moments she runs to catch up with her sisters, leaving in the snow a trail of delicate drops of blood and one red poppy.There's something more than a little fake, as well as patronizing, about this kind of film making.",1979-11-09T05:00:00+0000

Miss Laure possibly is a very good actress but at this point in her career she is primarily a decorative object, something to seduce the eye. She is a beautifully molded creature, her limbs finely balanced, with skin so velvety it invites touching.In ""Normande"" she does get touched from time to time, but not frequently enough to raise this gloomy domestic melodrama to the sunnier level of soft-core pornography. Mostly Miss Laure, in the title role, walks through the movie fully dressed and looking worried, and well she might.Normande works in a drug store and is the sole support of her nutty mother, who thinks of herself as an actress but is actually a long-in-the-tooth porn performer; her younger sister, who has asthma and no love for Normande; her lover, who is unemployed and not breaking his neck looking for work; and an asexual young man who is unhappy because people mistake him for a homosexual.Sharing the house with Normande and her ""family,"" though in different apartments, are a senile old lady who keeps rats as pets, her grandson, who wants to be a musician, and a clean old man who lusts discreetly after Normande.Some suspense is provided by the knowledge that Normande is about to be evicted so that the apartment can be turned into a restaurant. It all becomes too, too much for Normande who retreats into a permanent dream world.The actors aren't bad but the movie is unreliable. Mr. Carle would like us to find something gallant about these eccentrics. Instead, being around them is like being panhandled by bores who ask for pity instead of money.",1979-11-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Singer's 'Magician of Lublin' Transformed:Wings Over Warsaw,"ISAAC BASHEVIS SINGER'S ""The Magician of Lublin"" doesn't easily lend itself to film, and for that reason it's possible to admire the ambition, if not the finesse, at work in Menahem Golan's adaptation. Mr. Golan, an Israeli director best known here for ""I Love You Rosa"" and ""Operation Thunderbolt,"" has co-produced, co-written and directed this version of Mr. Singer's novel. The film opens today at the Beekman Theater.The story is supposed to have supernatural overtones. But Mr. Golen's approach is so coarse, and Alan Arkin's performance in the title role so wonderfully dry, that some of the movie's ostensibly mystical moments smack of show business. The Magician is a nervy, self-promoting man who claims he can fly. But he won't attempt the trick until he lands an engagement in turn-of-the-century Warsaw's most prestigious theater. In the meantime, while his manager (Lou Jacobi) tries to land him this job, he keeps busy by trifling with the affections of more women than an ordinary man could perhaps manage. One of the lesser points of Mr. Singer's frequently bawdy tale is that they don't call this fellow the Magician for nothing.Although Yasha, the Magician, is frequently identified as a Jew in the course of the story, he is surely not a religious man. In fact, he seems to take particular pleasure in avoiding his Jewish origins  and his Jewish wifeby wooing Christian women. This is yet another sign of the vanity and arrogance that will eventually bring about a magical change in Yasha, a change which Mr. Golan is in no way equipped to render. To viewers unfamiliar with Mr. Singer's novel, the film may simply look like the story of an amorous, unprincipled man whose bizarre fate is not mysterious, just ill-explained.Were it not for Mr. Arkin, the crudeness of Mr. Golan's film might cancel out the forcefulness of its story. But Mr. Arkin makes the most of the character's shrewdness, and makes plausible his powers as a seducer. He brings warmth and intimacy to any number of scenes that might otherwise suffer from the vagaries of Mr. Golan's casting, which leads him toward actors who affirm things that are already obvious. It seems superfluous, for instance, to use Valerie Perrine as the tootsie of the piece, or Shelley Winters as the mean, ugly monster. Miss Winters makes new inroads into the realm of the horrible when she plays one scene in a corset and dark stockings, with a mouthful of rotted black teeth.Louise Fletcher is more successful as the Christian aristocrat Yasha purports to love, and she figures in the scenes of wealth and elegance that contrast Yasha's city life with the brown, gloomy village that harbors his wife. Maia Danziger, a new actress playing Yasha's assistant and mistress, completes the harem, and she has the film's most suspenseful scene, as the Magician attempts a Houdini stunt and her face makes it clear that she has tampered with the locks. Yasha himself is under water and having trouble breathing as this revelation is made.""The Magician of Lublin"" sounds stilted much of the time, and Mr. Golan's attempts to strike a note of earthy charm are, for the most part, in vain. But the undeniable energy of the story, and the expertise of a leading man who appears in almost every scene, are compelling enough to sustain interest. And the grand aspirations of this project suggests an attractive bravado very like the Magician's own.",1979-11-09T05:00:00+0000
us,Art: Prints of 2 German Romantic Masters,"THE revival of interest in printmaking on the part of contemporary artists  and their copious output in this medium has encouraged a healthy respect for the print in its own right, rather than as a product accessory to the process of painting or sculpture. What's more, the new interest, coupled with the renascence of figurative art, enables us also to look again at graphic work of the past we had once rejected or forgotten. And so it is almost inevitable that in the last few years the superb graphic production of two German romantic realists should surface again: Max Klinger (18571920) and Richard Muller (18741954). The work of both is on view at two print galleries  Martin Sumers Graphics, 50 West 57th Street, and FitchFebvrel, 5 East 57th Street through Dec. 1, and fascinating work it is.",1979-11-09T05:00:00+0000

And it gives the picture of Auden's life that his biogra- pher has pieced together, with a sense of how he ar- rived at it. The Auden celebrated here is an institu- tion, whom Charles Osborne, as head of another insti- tution, Poetry International, came to know late and not quite intimately. (Poetry International sponsors a series of annual summer readings at which Auden was a frequent performer.) A list of honors, with dates, and quotations from reviews, is the substance of Mr. Osborne's story; and Auden's final years, which ex- hibit no new change of heart or of habits, giye him the least trouble. The Auden of the 1930's and 40's still awaits his biographer. We may suppose that his life was shaped by certain forces and that his career might be made to form a satisfying dramatic arc.

That set off another little scandalized crisis in Paris where the issue of power, probity and the press has become the focus of attention. And it provided another demonstration of the President's style of superb selfconfidence and his critics sense of impotence. Ine latest abrasions began with sensational reports in Le Canard Enchaine that the President and his family had received lavish gifts of diamonds from the deposed Central African Emperor Bokassa. Then came charges, in the right- wing tabloid Minute, of profitable stringpulling in private real estate deals by Prime Minister Raymond Barre and Minister of Labor Robert Boulin. These were shrugged off as nasty gossip, until Mr. Boulin committed suicide. It was a shock. Mr. Giscard and other govenmental associates im- mediately blamed the press. The President said his late minister had disappeared in circumstances which provoke indignation. . .. These methods are unworthy of France and of democracy.

us,"Film: 'Vanina Vanini,' Conventional Rossellini:From Stendahl","ROBERTO ROSSELLINI'S ""Vanina Vanini,"" which opens today at the Little Theater in Joseph Papp's Public Theater, is one of the last more or less conventional theatrical films that Rossellini made before he began that extraordinary series of ""teaching films"" (""The Rise of Louis XIV,"" ""The Age of the Medici,"" ""Socrates,"" among others) on which he was still working at the time of his death in 1976.I emphasize ""more or less conventional"" because although ""Vanina Vanini,"" based on a Stendhal short story, seems to be a highly romantic melodrama set against the background of Italy's Risorgimento, it's not to be so easily categorized. Its characters are neither idealized nor familiar, and if the ending appears to be tragic, it's as open-ended as that of a continuing serial. Rossellini put great store by historical facts but remained skeptical of the way they could be manipulated to substantiate fashions in contemporary thought and politics.""Vanina Vanini"" opens in 1823, during the conclave of the College of Cardinals in Rome to pick a successor to Pope Pius VII. It's the story of the love affair of a bored, spoiled young Roman princess, Vanina Vanini (Sandra Milo), and a dedicated young patriot, Pietro Missirilli (Laurent Terzieff), who has come to Rome to assassinate a traitor to his brotherhood of Free Masons, here identified with the fight against papal oppression and the campaign for a united Italy.Vanina hasn't much feeling, one way or the other, about revolutionary politics, though her father, like so many Roman aristocrats, allows himself to become an accessory to revolution simply by refusing to stand against it. Vanina and Pietro meet when her father, to save his mistress from an embarrassing situation, agrees to hide the wounded Pietro in his house.Vanina, after nursing Pietro back to health, follows her lover to the north of Italy and, with no immediate thought of the consequences, plots to free Pietro of the political obligations that are interfering with her happiness. Eventually she informs on his comrades and is surprised when he refuses to accept the terms of a church pardon that would save him from the guillotine.""Vanina Vanini"" sometimes sounds like the ripest of melodramatic romance, as when Pietro feels the need to say that he and Vanina belong to two different worlds, though as he points you, ""You have the power to make me forget everything.""Yet the movie is never quite that simple or simple-minded. Nor are Vanina and Pietro some sort of 19th-century equivalents to 20th-century lovers separated by class and conviction. They are deeply rooted in their own time, something that Rossellini respects and which distinguishes this film from Luchino Visconti's ""Senso,"" which deals with the same period of Italy's history.There is an extraordinary scene in which Vanina, guilt-ridden by her illicit affair with Pietro, is quizzed by her young, handsome confessor, a priest whose genuine concern for her is very much at odds with his own passion. There's also a typical Rossellini exchange when Vanina, who refuses to take Pietro's political commitments seriously, suggests that perhaps they could run off to America.""I don't think I'd like it,"" Pietro says in effect. ""There's something to be said for bad government. If I went abroad, I'd be without passions, without feelings.""Behind that statement are the wisdom and the purpose that illuminate all of Rossellini's later work. Rossellini did not, I think, often imagine a utopia, as a Marxist might. Utopia is for the dead. The world is for the living whose purpose is to strive, to evolve, to learn.Miss Milo, probably best remembered here as Giulietta Masina's demimondaine friend in Federico Fellini's ""Juliet of the Spirits,"" has a somewhat hard, movie-actress edge to her that is not entirely out of keeping with her role as Vanina. Mr. Terzieff is effective without being memorable in any waywhich may have to do with the acting styles of the time.The print being shown at the Public has apparently been clipped in spots, though why or by whom, I don't know. Martine Carol, the late, pre-Brigitte Bardot French sexpot, appears in the film so briefly that I assume her role was once somewhat more important.",1979-11-13T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Boardwalk,' a Couple's Problems:Crises in Series","DAVID and Becky Rosen (Lee Strasberg and Ruth Gordon) are approaching their 50th wedding anniversay as full of love for each other and confidence in the future as they were the day they were married. It's not easy, though. Their once safe middle-class Brooklyn neighborhood is going downhill rapidly. A gang of toughs roams the Coney Island boardwalk in the daytime and ransacks houses at night. When David attempts to befriend a Puerto Rican boy who has tried to rip off David's no-longer-profitable cafeteria, the kid rudely ridicules him.Then, too, Becky has cancer and Florence (Janet Leigh), their widowed daughter, enters a loveless marriage with a man who sells vinyl floor coverings. Florence's 24-year-old son, Peter, wants to be a rock musician. When the Rosens' best friends, the Friedmans, who are as old as David and Becky but not as resilient, find themselves unable to cope with the constant threats of robbery, rape and random attack, they turn on the gas jets and, hand in hand, lie down to await the death of their choosing.This is just a partial listing of some of the more or less crucial events in Stephen Verona's ""Boardwalk,"" a movie so cluttered with crises it has the look of something condensed, like a trailer or a promotional film for a film that has yet to be made.This is not surprising. Though Mr. Verona has made two theatrical features (""The Lords of Flatbush"" and ""Pipe Dreams""), his background is in promotional movies, the principal purpose of which is to sell a product. In this case the product is despair, though I'm not at all sure that Mr. Verona realizes it.Pay no attention to that cheery ad for ""Boardwalk"": ""The next time someone tells you to act your age  tell them about these two,"" over a Hirschfeld line drawing of Mr. Strasberg and Miss Gordon, cuddling in bed while reading Playboy. There is such a scene in the movie, and it is carried off with style by Mr. Strasberg and Miss Gordon, but ""Boardwalk"" is otherwise a movie of unrelieved, unexplored gloom. This is not because of what happens but because Mr. Verona, both as the director and screenwriter (with Leigh Chapman), has no knack whatsoever for seeing beyond the troubles he dumps into his picture.""Boardwalk,"" which opens today at the Manhattan 2 Cinema, is about a number of serious subjects, including old age, urban blight, the generation gap, terminal illness, inflation and the failure of the American dream. Though Mr. Verona identifies these problems, he has no idea how to shape them into a coherent, plausible movie.There even are indications that he is ashamed of making a movie that is, without doubt, the downer of the year. After he has allowed us to see the attempted rape of an old lady, or the firebombing of David's cafeteria, he immediately cuts to some dumb shot of Peter, the rock musician, in rehearsal, as if a little music will take our minds off the unpleasant business at hand. There's no irony here. It is, instead, a station-break.Mr. Verona also has no idea how to write individual scenes or how to allow characters to develop at their own speed. The movie proceeds in bits and pieces of sequences that undercut the actors, at the same time revealing the absence of anything faintly resembling a director's unifying vision.When the film is dealing with the home life of David and Becky, ""Boardwalk"" adopts the folksy, Jewish-cute manners of a situation comedy. When David or Becky is out on the boardwalk, about to be assaulted by the one gang that seems to own all of Coney Island, the film's style becomes that of ""The Warriors""  the gang's appearance being announced by clickety-click soundtrack music and by close-ups of sneakered feet.The only thing the movie has going for it is a cast of good actors. Mr. Strasberg, Miss Gordon and Miss Leigh provide their roles with depths of feelings that come out of their own resources, certainly not the director's or the writers'. The supporting roles are nicely handled by Joe Silver, Eli Mintz, Eddie Barth and Merwin Goldsmith, while Lillian Roth makes a brief, sweet appearance as a lonely Jewish widow. Linda Manz (""Days of Heaven"") wanders on and off as an anonymous member of the street gang, which is so carefully integrated you might suspect that Brooklyn now runs a busing program for muggers.Because ""Boardwalk"" is inept, it makes everything it touches seem trivial. How, one wonders, did Mr. Verona obtain the services of so many talented people, including Billy Williams, the cameraman? Chutzpah, perhaps.",1979-11-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Each Other,' Israeli Love Triangle:Meeting on a Train","""EACH OTHER"" is an Israeli film about a friendship colored by something that only half-happens. Yola (Michal Bat-Adam) is on a train to Tel Aviv when she meets Anne (Brigitte Catillon), to whom she takes a very, very, very big shine. They begin to talk. They also begin to flirt. Anne eagerly accepts Yola's suggestion that they stay in adjoining rooms at the same hotel.Then Anne accepts another kind of invitation from Ilan, a security guard who works in the lobby. Yola, who hears more than she'd like to through Anne's door, becomes so jealous about the man that she makes an impetuous, expensive taxi trip to Jerusalem and back, all on a single night. Clearly, there's a great deal brewing between these two.What comes of it? Everything and nothing, in a film as simultaneously coy and earnest as ""Each Other"" turns out to be. Yola has a male lover, Avi (Assaf Dayan), who, while not averse to making love to both women, becomes unexpectedly straitlaced just as they are about to pounce on one another. Under pressure from this spoilsport, Yola and Anne desist  and when we see them years later, their love has endured and matured and lost many of its sexual overtones. Oh, they make a go at it, while Avi (whom Yola has married) is elsewhere. But the feeling has faded. The moment isn't quite right. Life goes on. Love is strange.Stranger still, some may feel, is the fact that Miss Bat-Adam, who plays Yola, also wrote and directed this story. ""Each Other,"" which opens today at the Manhattan I theater, takes a smarmy, self-indulgent turn when Miss Bat-Adam executes a dance of sensual abandon (in a nightclub, as both Anne and Avi watch her with growing enthusiasm) before her own camera, or plays an explicit love scene.These episodes might not seem so jarring in the context of a film of broader scope, or a more generally animated performance. But Miss Bat-Adam presents Yola as a pensive, glum, rather distant character, one whose joyful impulses seem somewhat unexpected. And her film, which tries to address larger issues at times, remains teasingly fixated on the love affair.Miss Bat-Adam's direction, which is competent if unexceptional, involves some striking glimpses of Tel Aviv's tourist attractions, not to mention sunny scenery and local color. ""Each Other"" also achieves, very occasionally, that wistful quality of retrospection to which it evidently aspires. Miss Bat-Adam presents her story slowly, and without any exceptional vigor. But she and the other players are distinctive, if not particularly dynamic. Perhaps her film's leisurely mood and protestations of warmth will remind some viewers of how they spent a summer vacation.Miss Bat-Adam, whose directorial debut was produced by Moshe Mizrahi, has starred in several of Mr. Mizrahi's movies, among them ""The House on Chelouche Street"" and ""I Love You, Rosa.""",1979-11-14T05:00:00+0000

OTB has grown well enough, from $20 million in revenue in 1971 to 156 parlors and $804 million last year. Racing, we gather, is trouble nationwide. Not the gasoline lines of summer but inflation seems to be reducing the take. Tracks are offering an array of giveaways.

But the nun who's supposed to be removing it keeps forgetting to finish the job, because she's caught up in a heated discussion with a priest. A woman has been told that her father is about to die. But this same nun, who's supposed to be consoling her, is once again arguing with her friend the priest, and for a devout, spiritual woman, she's got an awfully bright gleam in her eye. Strange behavior for a nun? Strange tactics for a movie. Heaven help anyone who tries to take this story at face value.""The Runner Stumbles,"" which opens today at Loews New York Twin I, is ostensibly about a young nun (Kathleen Quinlan) and an older priest (Dick Van Dyke) who have what might, in any other line of work, be considered an office romance. Directed by Stanley Kramer, and adapted by Milan Stitt from his play, it tells what happens when jaunty, life-affirming Sister Rita wanders into the world of Father Rivard, whose assignment to a small, isolated Western community has begun to damage his faith and his disposition.As soon as Sister Rita arrives, she begins raving about the landscape and putting flowers in the vases and teaching the schoolchildren racy songs that aren't in Latin. Even the prostitutes  this is a town where everyone knows everyone else's business  think Sister Rita is a bit much. But Father Rivard is entranced. And he begins squiring her for walks along the local lanes, to the chagrin of the nosy townsfolk.There's nothing improper in their conversation  in fact, they talk mostly about God. But everyone blames Father Rivard when Sister Rita dies under mysterious circumstances, which prove to be preposterous circumstances in the end. The movie is structured as a series of flashbacks during his incarceration and trial, and not until the finale can the audience be sure what sort of attitude toward Father Rivard it ought to have. He seems to be an essentially decent man, whose behavior is questionable on only one or two occasions. Mr. Van Dyke, in about the movie's only strong scene, registers tremendous shock and self-contempt when he watches Sister Rita lie to a senior Church official, and realizes the extent to which she has been compromised.For all its talk about God and faith and whether it's O.K. for Sister Rita to move into Father Rivard's house after the other two nuns she lives with develop consumption, ""The Runner Stumbles"" is without a great, galloping Big Issue at its center. And without anything momentous to sink his teeth into, Mr. Kramer is very evidently at a loss. The movie plods along with nothing to propel it; the love story is so discreetly rendered it's barely there, and the moral question of the priest's complicity is presented too fuzzily to be of interest.The movie's ethics are, in fact, so hazy, and its attention to religion so perfunctory, that it almost seems as if this were a story about something else that had been transferred, as an afterthought, to a Church setting. The story of a middle-aged man dissatisfied with his career, or wondering whether to leave his wife for a younger woman, could very easily have taken the same dramatic route and seemed a lot clearer. As it is, Mr. Kramer treats the film's religious questions as afterthoughts, and too often achieves a dispirited, noncommittal tone.An all-star cast is probably not what an already distracted film like ""The Runner Stumbles"" needed. But an all-star cast is what it has. Beau Bridges doubles as both the town good-for-nothing and Father Rivard's lawyer. Maureen Stapleton and Tammy Grimes, as the priest's housekeeper and one of his parishioners, both seem normal enough until the screenplay reveals them to be mentally unsound. Ray Bolger makes a brief, effective appearance as the Church superior to whom Sister Rita tells her lie.Miss Quinlan is ebullient to a fault, but that seems to be what both the screenplay and Mr. Kramer had in mind. Mr. Van Dyke's performance, though extremely sympathetic, is hard to assess. He worries and suffers, but the film finds nothing vital in his ordeal.""The Runner Stumbles"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It includes an off-screen murder, infrequent harsh language and references to prostitution.",1979-11-16T05:00:00+0000

His subjects are Sophocles Oedipus, Dostoyevsky, Camus, Pirandello, Borges, Kafka, RobbeGrillet and, sandwiched between them, Poe and Agatha Christie. The two last are the only writers of what are generally called mystery stories, and Poe is dealt with solely in relation to The Purloined Letter. Agatha Christie is there as an awful example of the mystery's degeneration. Professor Grossvogel's thesis is that man, unable either to grasp or to abandon mystery  inyents incar4ations with Which he can cope. Such incarnations are essentially ritualistic, and their lasting t sonance springs from a refusal accept logical solutions. The lution of the riddle in Oedipus and the murder in The Brothers Karamazov are used as instances of human duality, so that the mystery appears to be resolvable without being resolved. The meaning of The Trial, it is suggested, is that life goes beyond logic, a premise accepted by logical, reasonable K, who goes as far as to abet the conspiracy of which he is a victim. Such writers as Jorge Luis Borges and Alain RobbeGrillet have used the framework of a detective puzzle for ends very different from those of Christie and her kind.

It's only in the 20th century that sails have come to symbolize glamour and sport and cleanhandedness, while any actual work is done by some dreary craft with an engine. One bit of the old system survives in this country  one working fleet that still moves under sail. Down in Chesapeake Bay, when men go out to dredge oysters they go out on sailing vessels. At least in Maryland's part of the bay they do. There are 30odd skipjacks that make up the Maryland oyster fleet. Each has a tall mast, a crew of six, a grubby deck and some 1,200 square feet of sail. They owe their survival to a centuryold state law that forbids dredging for oysters by vessels under power.

us,CASTRO'S ROOTS IN SPAIN,"LANCARA, Spain. New York City greeted Fidel Castro last month with massive police protection, occasional eruptions of hostility on the streets and, at the United Nations, a mixture of thunderous applause and diplomatic silence. Now this little town across the Atlantic is told it can expect a visit soon from the father of the Cuban revolution  He says he wants to stay for a month! explodes one incredulous state official  and the reception, though certainly smaller, will no doubt be equally ambivalent. Fidel Castro has cousins and not a few enemies scattered across the green hills of Galicia. The vast majority of Spaniards are antiCommunist in their political views. But for others, Fidel, the wayward son of their vanished empire, is a source of sweet revenge for their last drubbing by foreign arms  the SpanishAmerican War of 1898, which old men still call the disaster. Fe still others, Castro is Horatio Alger onceremoved. In a society where upward mobility is blocked by barriers of class, background and money, many of its people have tried to improve their lives by emigrating. And those who succeed abroad are acclaimed when they return. On Dec. 8, 1875, Angel Maria Bautista Castro Arguiz was inscribed in the birth register of Lancara in Galicia, a backward, neglected region of northwestern Spain. Born in a dank, slateroofed house with an earthen floor, the first of three children of a poor farmer, Angel Castro as a young man worked as a day laborer in the fields near the tiny River Neira, known for its fat trout; he was an avid gambler at cards, and usually won. At the age of 23, big and restless, Angel Castro accepted a small sum to take the place of a wealthier man in Spain's disastrous campaign to hold its rebel colony, Cuba  a war that turned into a national humiliation for Spain when the United States, seething with a newfound Manifest Destiny and aroused by the sinking of the Maine, intervened on the side of the Cuban rebels. Angel Castro survived the 1898 war and returned, briefly, to Spain. But like many fellow Gallegos he found his native Galicia confining, the horizons of the New World enticing. While his younger brother Gonzalo emigrated to Argentina, Angel sailed back to Cuba, where he settled in the savage sugar territory of Oriente, a virtual fief of the United Fruit Company. Though he bitterly hated the North Americans, who had humiliated Spain at war, he worked for them, but at the same time he hacked a cane plantation of his own from the untamed bush. The Castro hacienda, called Manacas, grew to perhaps 20,000 acres, and employed several hundred men.",1979-11-18T05:00:00+0000

The tapes are backed up by the sounds of musicians warming up and the drone of those buses on the road. It gives the conversations a reality. The autobiography should read like a novel.

us,Film 'Between Miracles',"BENEDETTO (Nino Manfredi) wants to sin but he can't, being too guilt-ridden in the way of rural Italians as we've come to know them in Italian movies.When he was very young, a poor orphan living with his tyrannical aunt, Benedetto had been prey to all of the impure thoughts and desires that are common to boys of his age. Most boys learn what to do about them. Benedetto didn't. Unfortunately for him, his life had been saved (or so it was interpreted) by the intervention of his patron saint, Eusebio, after which Benedetto was given to the care of monks to be raised and schooled.Some years later, actually when he's ""nearing 40"" as someone says of him, Benedetto is still living at the monastery and still having impure thoughts, which, when you're nearing 40, suggests the existence of major problems.""Between Miracles,"" the 1971 Italian comedy that opens today at the Cinema I, is the story of Benedetto's liberation  sort of  when he meets a free-thinking old pharmacist named Orestes (Lionel Stander), who inspires the young man to throw off religion's crushing yoke. That Orestes has a beautiful daughter, Giovanna (Delia Boccardo), with whom Benedetto falls in love, also helps.For a film that is so essentially pious and conformist, ""Between Miracles"" is suprisingly offensive, mostly, I suspect, because Mr. Manfredi, one of Italy's most popular performers, does not travel well. He projects this middle-aged man's innocence with all of the conviction of of an over-the-hill vaudeville performer.In addition to being the star of ""Between Miracles,"" Mr. Manfredi also directed it and collaborated on its screenplay. The result is not a comedy of manners but a demonstration of ego, as were most of Jerry Lewis's later films.There are occasional charming moments early on, when Paolo Armeni plays Benedetto as a child, but the charm disappears when Mr. Manfredi lines himself up in his own viewfinder. The director appears to be so enamored of his star that he allows him to give the sort of patronizing, totally bogus imitation of innocence that, in tone if not in mannerisms, may remind you of Red Skelton at his worst. I'm not one of the many admirers of Mr. Manfredi's performance in the award-winning ""Bread and Chocolate,"" but that one was a model of sincerity compared to what he does as Benedetto in ""Between Miracles.""I should also admit that I have trouble relating to Lionel Stander (who here seems to speak perfect Italian in his familiar, gravelly voice), both as a lovable character, which I never believe, and as an actor, since every performance is like the one that preceded it. He has become a very boring actor, but then ""Between Miracles"" is a very boring movie. It's among Mr. Manfredi's peculiar accomplishments to have made a film in which there is absolutely no sense of time, place or people, Just actors.",1979-11-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Five Shorts From Appalachia:Portrait of a Region,"THE documentary films that constitute the Film Forum's program are deceptively plain. These five shorts are the work of Appalshop Films, a nonprofit cooperative based in Whitesburg, Ky., and Appalshop's reputation as one of the nation's best regional film making concerns is well-earned.The value of its work doesn't lie in jazzy editing, or shrewd camerawork; its direction is generally matter-of-fact. This simple approach is applied to local people whose very presence on film is remarkable, and whose evident ease is a tribute to the film makers' talents. Appalshop's catalogue lists nearly 30 films, all part of the collective's efforts to assemble a living chronicle of its region. On the evidence of the Film Forum's installments, the cumulative effect of several such films is perhaps greater than the individual impact of any one. But even in small groups, these shorts make it clear that Appalshop is performing a valuable service and performing it well.The obvious standout on the Film Forum's ""Appalshop: Films From Appalachia"" program is ""Nimrod Workman: To Fit My Own Category."" The reason is Mr. Workman himself, a retired coal miner who has suffered black lung, shrunk down to 121 pounds, and somehow retained his vivacity and humor. Mr. Workman, apparently in his 70's when the film was released in 1975, likes to sing, and will make up a verse for any occasion. (""Any kinda beans is good beans . . ,"" begins one ditty.) He is seen singing and chatting and performing chores with the various members of his large family, and to each of these activities he brings a special spark. Chores, by the way, figure prominently in many of these films. So do samplers bearing homilies that the impoverished scenery seems to belie.Mr. Workman, in one memorable sequence, tries to repair his ramshackle house with a board that keeps falling down, while the soundtrack plays a song about mansions in the sky. There is considerable emphasis, here and in the other films, upon an unwavering optimism that life doesn't often seem to justify. One of the seamstresses who appears in ""The Millstone Sewing Center"" remarks that ""everything we've ever needed has always been right here at our fingertips."" Later, a closing title explains that Federal funding for the center was cut back in 1972, just after the film was made. The juxtaposition might seem ironic, were it not for the quiet tenacity with which that woman insists that God will surely provide.""Waterground,"" the most recent of the Appalshop films (it was made in 1977) and the only one in color, visits a small, old-fashioned grist mill and Walter Winebarger, whose family has operated it for generations. It also visits a General Foods mill nearby, fully automated, and a place about which Mr. Winebarger has no curiosity at all. He contents himself with grinding natural flour, and with running something that, through no effort of his own, has become a tourist attraction. ""People come from everywhere, really, to look at this old mill, to draw it and to take pictures,"" he says, sounding slightly baffled. ""People just go wild over it. It needs painting, but people say just let it stand like it is, cause it's old . . . and that's what people are lookin' to go back to.""""Judge Wooten and Coon-on-a-Log"" is about a local contest for dogs. Each dog swims out to a log and is expected to dislodge an angry raccoon in record time. A man, who has been casually explaining the goings-on, says something about the region's peace and happiness at the end of the film, and the camera suddenly zeroes in on two animals snapping at each other. This is as close to direct commentary as the Appalshop films choose to come.",1979-11-22T05:00:00+0000

One extreme example of tight controls can be found at the commercial networks where the news departments are traditionally reluctant to accept any material produced outside their precincts. When David Frost, who is technically an independent, recently created a public flap about the way NBC was handling his interview with Henry Kissinger, the immediate response of William Small, president NBC News, was that the network's use of outsiders would have to be reevaluated. On the other hand, NBC is not beyond using exclusive stories filed by outsiders.

us,Film: Khachaturian's Ballet 'Gayane':The Cast,"IF you remember the old juke-box favorite ""Saber Dance,"" you might actually want to see where it comes from, the Soviet ballet ""Gayan.""Created to Aram Khachaturian's music in 1942, ""Gayan"" is one of the staples of the Soviet and Eastern European ballet repertory. Oddly, it has never been seen here, although Margot Fonteyn and the Hungarian dancer Viktor Rona once danced at the White House in a ladylike and gentlemanly pas de deux from one of the many re-choreographed versions of the original production.The new filmed version, which opens today at the Murray Hill Theater, is on the wilder side. American-produced, by the See Theater Network, it has many aspects to recommend it.The dancers are from Latvia's Riga Opera and Ballet Theater. Mikhail Baryshnikov and Aleksandr Godunov started their ballet training at that company's school and, as Mr. Baryshnikov says, the Riga Ballet is a good company. Since it has never performed in the United States, this ""Gayan"" offers Americans a first glimpse of its dancers. The choreographer, Boris Eifman, is also new here, although his name is familiar when contemporary young Soviet choreographers come under discussion.The combined result is a ballet film of interest to ballet lovers and anybody who likes a good show. Yet, despite Mr. Eifman's valiant efforts, he is restricted by the required Soviet format of the ballet's origins  the incorporated folk elements of the music and its reliance upon a moral conclusion.The first version was created in Perm, where the Kirov Ballet had been evacuated during World War II. Nina Asimova worked with a scenario involving a spy who parachutes into a collective farm in Armenia. In 1954, Vassily Vainonen choreographed the best-known version for the Bolshoi with a new scenario, about a love quadrangle in which Gayan  the mountain girl in the Caucusus  stands by a lover who is ostracized by the community because he has betrayed a rival.Mr. Eifman has created his own narrative, concentrating on a love story within the framework of a village revolt. Gayan is the girl in the Caucusus loved by both Giko and Armen. Armen leads the revolt against the local tyrant, Machak and wins Gayan's hand. Her heart nonetheless belongs to Giko, torn between his love for Gayan and loyalty to his father, ???ak. The stylized folk dancers are ???oven into the narrative as part of ???ion, and this includes the famous Saber Dance, in which Armen and Giko now duel over Gayan.Mr. Eifman has provided some fine examples of vigorous masculine dancing and the real sparks that fly during the Saber Dance will remind American audiences of the exciting Georgian men's dances that have been seen here. The men in the Riga Ballet have all the energy and passion one could demand, even clashing their swords against their shields in unison during the curtain calls.This ""Gayan"" is, then, a film of a stage performance in the Riga Opera House  danced especially for the American production team. It has some of the defects of a filmed stage performance, but there has also been an effort to zoom in on the right people at the right dramatic moments. In this respect, Mr. Eifman's choreography looks best in the various pas de deux that sum up the human drama upon which he concentrates.Larisa Tuisova's fluidity makes for a very womanly Gayan and Genadi Gorbanyev has a youthful exuberance as Armen. Maris Koristin treats the grotesqueries of Machak's choreography persuasively and Aleksandr Rumyantsev, most impressive of all, has the right dramatic power.",1979-11-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Jean Seberg In a Spanish Setting:A Summer in Spain,"""THE Corruption of Chris Miller,"" Juan Antonia Bardem's English-dubbed Spanish film opening today at the Thalia, is being billed as Jean Seberg's last movie and as having been made in 1976, though the short skirts would seem to date its production at least several years earlier. In addition, the film's preoccupation with a kind of doomy, unfulfilling heterosexuality, with lesbianism as the alternative, recalls the bogus breakthroughs made by some European film makers in the late 60's, when censorship boards everywhere began to crack.The film, however, is typical of those of the later period of Miss Seberg's life abroad. The settings and costumes mean to be chic; the melodrama is absurd, and Miss Seberg, her beauty unimpaired, gives an extremely sincere performance that is never particularly convincing. Once again, though, she gives dimension to a film of no great interest just because her presence is so unexpected. What, one keeps wondering, is this quintessentially American beauty, a woman who speaks in the flat accents of her native Iowa, doing in the middle of so much quintessential European decadence?We never do find out.In ""The Corruption of Chris Miller"" Miss Seberg plays Ruth, a successful London fashion designer spending the summer at her country villa in Spain with her equally beautiful, neurotic, teen-age stepdaughter, Chris (Marisol).Before I go further I have to explain that ""The Corruption of Chris Miller"" is the kind of movie in which a couple of very important things have happened before the start of the story  events whose revelation in the course of the film are entirely arbitrary: Ruth has been abandoned by Chris's father just one year before and (no connection here) Chris had been brutally raped in the shower of her dance school by a large hairy man.As the movie begins, it's apparent that the two women are spending a very edgy time together. Chris hates Ruth and yet she seems to respond to her stepmother's love, which is somewhat more than a mother's. Into this situation, already fairly fraught with problems, comes a handsome young Englishman named Barney (Barry Stokes), a drifter who studies anthropology because, as he says, human beings interest him. As Barry sets about becoming the love object of each woman (at different times), the countryside where they live is terrorized by a series of murders. Could Barry be the hatchet-person? Could Chris? Ruth?A director less greedy and more gifted than Mr. Bardem would have thrown out one-half of the screenplay and concentrated on the other half, developing either the relationship between the two women or the more sensational aspects of the murder mystery. As it is, there's more going on than Mr. Bardem can make cinematic sense of.It's quite possible, of course, that Mr. Bardem is saying something obliquely trenchant here about Spanish society under Franco, but to the rest of us ""The Corruption of Chris Miller,"" once titled ""Behind the Shutters,"" looks more like a multinational co-production that doesn't work.",1979-11-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Dirty Money':Story of a Crime,"""DIRTY MONEY"" begins with glimpses of a deserted modern landscape, an image that neatly characterizes both the movie and the people who inhabit it. Four men are sitting in a car outside one of these empty buildings, preparing to rob a bank. It's raining. The windshield wipers are moving energetically; the men are perfectly still. The robbery  before, while, and after it happens  will never be explained, at least not in words.Instead, its meaning is conveyed purely by action  and the action in this film is fascinatingly mechanical, whether it involves a human being or an electrified window shade. Jean-Pierre Melville, who directed the previously unreleased ""Dirty Money"" in 1972, dwells hypnotically upon the tiniest details of any operation, and punctuates the film with ominous, unexpected camera swoops. Seedy characters and expressionless settings are fused into a film noir demimonde, a world made dangerous by the edginess of Mr. Melville's methods.In the end  which, like the beginning, features characters staring wordlessly into space  there is perhaps more affectlessness than most audiences would tolerate, which may explain why the film is only now having its American premiere. (It opens tonight at the Thalia, as part of that theater's latest program of previously unreleased features). But the forcefulness and mystery of Mr. Melville's direction often generate an urgency that keeps the film from feeling vague.The leader of the bank robbers, played by Richard Crenna in his very effective ""Wait Until Dark"" tough-guy guise, and a police vice investigator, played by Alain Delon, are both involved with the same moll; in a film as strangely elegant as this one, Catherine Deneuve is ideally suited to the moll's role. These three characters encounter each other one afternoon in Mr. Crenna's nightclub, a place usually populated by feathery showgirls. Mr. Delon strides in and begins playing a piano, smoking a sultry cigarette, and eyeing Miss Deneuve in a heavy-lidded manner. The piano keys are exposed, a very small touch that somehow works perfectly. There may be more to this scene than pure mood, but somehow it's the overall attitude that lingers.Mr. Melville's obsession with technical information is sometimes taken to lengths that border on the crazy. Late in the story, Mr. Crenna is lowered by helicopter onto a moving train, where he expects to make a drug connection. (The man carrying the drugs has already been seen neatly packing white envelope after white envelope into two identical suitcases with very nicely designed false bottoms). Mr. Crenna arrives in a jumpsuit and ducks into a lavatory to change. We see him comb his hair. We see him unlace one sneaker, and then the other. We watch him peel off the jumpsuit, under which he is wearing pajamas, a robe and a tool kit. Then we watch him comb his hair again, and wash his face too. Nothing is left out. And yet the effect is unnerving rather than tedious.Among the other odd excesses of ""Dirty Money"" is the blatantly thread-bare appearance of its more elaborate scenes. When the aforementioned helicopter and train have their rendezvous, there's no mistaking the fact that this is a battle between tiny toys. (Mr. Melville even cuts from a shot of Mr. Crenna in the doorway of a real, on-the-ground helicopter to long shots of a miniature helicopter in the air, with a teensy silhouette painted on its side). At one point, the actors are seen parading before a very unconvincing mural of the Arc de Triomphe. This scene is supposed to be taking place outdoors.",1979-11-30T05:00:00+0000
us,Broadway,"JANE ALEXANDER will star in Howard Sackler's Goodbye, Fidel, which Edwin Sherin will direct and which will come to Broadway early next March.

Mr. Sherin also says it is a romantic drama, loosely based on fact and full of love and compassion. Mr. Sackler's other plays  The Great White Hope and Semmelweiss  were also based on fact, and it was in The Great White Hope that Miss Alexander, Mr. Sherin and Mr. Sackler were first joined. That was in 1968. Last year, Mr. Sherin and Mr. Sackler were joined again in Semmelweiss, although that play got no farther than the Kennedy Center in Washington. Mr. Sherin and Miss Alexander, of course, have been joined for some time. They are married.",1979-11-30T05:00:00+0000
