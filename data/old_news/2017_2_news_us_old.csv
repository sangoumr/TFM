us,The Misunderstood Genius of Russell Westbrook,"In Philadelphia, before the first game of the N.B.A. season, Russell Westbrook worked through his warm-up routine. He was loose and laughing but  as always  precise. Westbrooks internal clock had driven him to be the first player out on the court, a full three hours before tipoff, and he was performing his routine in front of a largely empty arena. He started with chip-ins and free throws, easy stuff to get his body going, and then moved on to his signature shot: the pull-up jumper. Westbrooks pull-up is one of modern basketballs most recognizable weapons  if not yet quite on the level of Kareems skyhook or Jordans turnaround or Dirks one-legged fadeaway, then at least at the edge of that territory. The move is a surprise attack. Westbrook is unreasonably fast and aggressive, a flying, screaming whirlwind of ferocious highlight dunks, and he charges the hoop with so much raging menace that defenders have no choice but to scramble backward to try to stop him. Thats when he hits them with the pull-up: He stops instantly and  while the defenders momentum continues to drag him backward  leaps perfectly straight into the air, like a fighter pilot ejecting from his cockpit to escape an explosion, except that Russell Westbrook is the explosion: He is the explosion and the control all at once. The whole thing seems to defy the laws of motion. Growing up in Los Angeles, Westbrook practiced this move so many tens of thousands of times on the playground that he and his father referred to it as the cotton shot, because they always expected it to go through the net.",2017-02-01T10:00:04+0000

Being on a rail is similar to being on a balance beam, but because the former is thinner and usually round, your whole foot cannot be on top of the rail at once.

This month, the museum unveils a major retrospective, Merce Cunningham: Common Time, co-presented with the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. The pioneering choreographer was known for collaborating with artists (Jasper Johns, Bruce Nauman), which helped dance enter major museums, many of which are now outfitting new spaces with black boxes and sprung floors for just such performances. Ephemeral forms have largely been left out of art history, the shows co-curator Philip Bither says. And its important that those stories be told. In addition to sets and costumes, the exhibit will feature performances and new commissions from such contemporary choreographers as Rashaun Mitchell and Silas Riener, who met as dancers in the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, as well as Maria Hassabi and Beth Gill.

For us, PRINT was always about a love of magazines, a love of image making; and a desire to create something beautiful, honest and optimistic without an agenda beyond that, says Burns, a contributing editor for British Vogue who met Simmonds (previously the creative director of Dazed and Confused and now an art director for Gucci among others) working on advertising campaigns. The magazine launched in December at Dover Street Market and 10 Corso Como  and sold so quickly it became, according to Angela Hill of the bookseller IDEA, the fastest selling independent magazine launch in the history of their store. The first issue of the oversized magazine comes packaged in a cardboard box with posters, prints and badges. We wanted to create something timeless, that people could come back to and rediscover, Simmonds says. Inside are intimate portfolios from photographers and stylists like Jamie Hawkesworth, Colin Dodgson, Joe McKenna and David Sims  and theres even a photo essay from the singer Frank Ocean. According to Burns, the brief to contributors was simple: to do something personal  to do something that truly inspires the artist and to take time over it. In fact, this is a mantra that Burns and Simmonds took to heart: They pushed the planned release date of the magazine back by a few months. We could take our time, digest it, revisit it and add to it, Simmonds says. The only people we had to answer to were each other. We could do what we felt was right.",2017-02-08T21:17:11+0000

In the 19th century, ghost stories were read aloud so that the atmosphere set people up to be pleasurably scared in a communal way. Britons in the Victorian era were obsessed with ghost stories because they reflected uncertain times  the Industrial Revolution, a move to urban living and technological advances like the telegraph, a supernatural-seeming invention. Start with elements that you may be afraid of because of that atavistic, primitive danger, Robbins says. Bodies that are apparently human but might not be, like dolls and portraits. If the narrative begins in a room with those items, youre more likely to be haunted by that space. Material detail is powerful, because ghost stories are often about objects. People become possessed by possessions, Robbins says.",2017-02-10T10:00:03+0000

In Gimme Shelter: Hollywood North, a series running from Friday, Feb. 24, through March 8, Anthology Film Archives examines one such rendezvous, a Canadian tax-incentive program set up in 1974. The outcomes werent always good  the term Canuxploitation was coined to describe the worst of the batch, and the program lasted only through the mid-1980s. But the retrospective includes curios like The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane, a thriller starring a young Jodie Foster and Martin Sheen, as well as the indisputable gem Atlantic City from 1980. Written by John Guare and directed by Louis Malle, the offbeat story of Lou, an aging numbers runner (Burt Lancaster), and Sally (Susan Sarandon), the striving young waitress he romances, plays out as the resort town bets its future on becoming a gambling paradise. The movie is prescient in the ways that hope turns sour, even as its respectful of the memory of better days. (anthologyfilmarchives.org)",2017-02-15T14:50:05+0000

us,She Began Her Career at Hedge Funds. Now She Reports on Their Crimes.,"Other Peoples Money: Before she became a journalist, the New Yorker staff writer Sheelah Kolhatkar worked in the late 1990s and early 2000s as an analyst at a couple of small hedge funds specializing in risk arbitrage  basically, she researched companies that planned to merge, and tried to predict how their stock prices would move. I fell into hedge funds by accident, she told me in a recent phone call about her new book, Black Edge, a look at the insider trading scandal that brought down the huge fund SAC Capital even as its founder escaped prosecution. (The book makes its debut on the hardcover nonfiction list at No.12.) Kolhatkar got her start in finance as a temp, answering phones, shortly after she graduated from Stanford with a masters degree in media studies. This was early in the evolution of hedge funds, she said, and a lot of them were willing to take a chance hiring the kind of people you might not expect. There was a start-up atmosphere, so everyone got to do a bit of everything. And the fund manager just sort of took a liking to me. She told me: Look, your boyfriend is a filmmaker. One of you should make some money. Im giving you an opportunity to learn the business and make some dough to keep living in New York City. So I took a crash course in financial analysis and investing. It was like learning a new language.",2017-02-17T17:25:06+0000

Patients are in treatment for their own needs and should not be required to consider the therapists other actual or prospective patients. (Psychotherapy isnt a simple commercial transaction.)

us,"George Saunders, Famous for Futuristic Short Stories, Hits No. 1 With a Historical Novel","Mourning in America: Could Joe Biden have been the next Abraham Lincoln? That thought came to mind recently thanks to George Saunderss debut novel, Lincoln in the Bardo (new at No.1 in hardcover fiction), which centers on Lincolns sorrow over the death of his young son. Biden, you may remember, opted not to run for president shortly after his son Beau died of cancer in 2015  a wrenching and understandable decision, of course, but one cast in retrospective relief by the suggestion in Saunderss novel that private grief made Lincoln a better public servant. What moved me about Lincolns arc during his presidency, Saunders told me via email, was the way that the burdens of the office  the floundering war effort, intense public criticism, the mistakes he made that were costing so many lives, the death of his son  beat him down and made him sorrowful, but also, almost causally, seemed to expand the reach of his empathy, so that, by the end, it included soldiers on both sides and the millions of Americans being enslaved by other Americans. It seemed to me that the empathy was somehow a byproduct of the sorrow  a burning-away of his hopes and dreams that resulted in a kind of naked seeing of things as they really were. For me, the book was about that terrible conundrum: We seem to be born to love, but everything we love comes to an end. What do we do with that? How can we keep going and live positive lives under that shadow? I came to understand Lincoln as someone so beat down by sadness and loss that he developed a sort of crazy wisdom  as if, in sadness, all of the comforting bromides that normally keep us from the harsher truths were denied him. Empathy might even thrive best in this state, where the easy comforts are denied us. Conversely, empathy doesnt do well in a climate of fear or anxiety, when one forgets the particular and individual and, in a panic, begins theorizing about whole groups of people without knowing many of them.",2017-02-24T16:56:44+0000
