us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  MOORE, JAMES EDWARD","MOORE-James Edward, 70. A New York commodities trader who played a major role in emergency medical services in his community and the state, died Wednesday at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center, New York City. Mr. Moore was a commodities futures trader with the New York Commodities Exchange, or COMEX and New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, for 50 years. Later in life he developed a second career, born of his love for boating, as owner of Brown's Point Marina in Keyport. But it was in a volunteer capacity that he may have affected the most lives during his years of service as an emergency medical technician and EMT trainer in Aberdeen. As an EMT trainer, Mr. Moore helped establish the EMT standard among first aid squads throughout the state, said Brian Gelburd, a former captain of the South Aberdeen EMS and longtime friend of Mr. Moore. ''He was instrumental in establishing the program in the state,'' Gelburd said. ''He was a natural leader, he would get on these crusades.'' Mr. Moore joined Matawan Township First Aid (later Aberdeen Township) in 1971. In 1972, he became an EMT and joined the South Matawan Township First Aid Squad (later South Aberdeen). He was a life member of South Aberdeen EMS, served several terms as captain, president and various other offices. He answered thousands of EMS calls, and also served as state testing coordinator for the National Registry of EMTs. After he moved away from Aberdeen, he remained active with the squad as a trainer and even went on calls when he was in the area, Gelburd said. In 1973, Mr. Moore started one of the earliest, if not the earliest EMT training programs for the state Department of Health. He remained coordinator of the Bayshore Area EMT course, one of the longest running programs in the state. He helped establish the pilot program for crash injury management/first responder for the State Police Academy, Sea Girt, which remains part of basic training in the academy. He was extrication training instructor and team captain for the state, and instrumental in bringing the first ''jaws of life'' rescue tool into service in Monmouth County. One of the earliest CPR instructor trainers, he coordinated one of the earliest testing sites at Bayshore Community Hospital, Holmdel. Mr. Moore began his trading career in 1960 as clerk for Anderson, Clayton & Fleming, and later became customers' manager for Bache & Co./Prudential Securities. He then joined Harmon Lichtenstein & Co., the oldest firm on the COMEX. He became a member of COMEX in 1965; NYMEX in 1966; and New York Cotton Exchange (New York Board of Trade) in 1977. He was a licensed broker for National Futures Association; and a member of Copper Club and various trade associations. He was one of the longest-serving members of COMEX. In addition to his commodities work, Mr. Moore was owner and operator of Brown's Point Marina, Keyport, for the past 20 years. He was drawn to the marina business because of his avid interest in boating. Largely through the efforts of his friend Paul Gasior, he acquired the marina in the late 1970s. Brown's Point Marina is one of the most active dealers for Suzuki Marine in the country. Mr. Moore enjoyed nothing more than his twicea-year boat trips to his home in Florida with Gasior, family and other friends. He enjoyed boating so much that he obtained his 200ton boating license through the Coast Guard, upgraded from 100ton. At the time of the World Trade Center disaster, Mr. Moore was staying at his New York apartment near the Trade Center, confined to bed because of his illness. His marina friends, especially Gasior, and Old Bridge Police Chief Jerry Polumbo and George Jensen, rescued him from the building after the Twin Towers' collapse. The building was not damaged, but was unlivable because of the debris from the collapse. In addition to his other pursuits, Mr. Moore served in the National Guard. He graduated from Xavier High School in New York City in 1950, but before that, in 1946, he lied about his age and enlisted in the New York National Guard. He first served in the 102nd Medical Battalion and later was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Medical Corps, 107th Combat Team. He then was battery commander of Battery D955, 2nd Corps; artillery commander of Company D, 106th Infantry; and retired as a captain in the Army Reserve. He was a communicant of St. Clement's Roman Catholic Church, Matawan, and a member of the Knights of Columbus. He moved from Brooklyn to Aberdeen in December 1967. He became active in Little League, Pop Warner and other community organizations. He was a third-degree member of the Knights of Columbus, Cardinal Newman Council, Aberdeen. He received many community service awards including the Elks Club Man of the Year. ''Anyone who ever met Jim will never forget him,'' his family said. ''He left a lasting impression with his charm and sense of humor. Above all, he will be remembered as one of the most generous and giving men in the world. Even those closest to him will never know the extent of his giving and kindness, which is the way he wanted it.'' He was predeceased by two sons, James E. Moore, Jr., in 1975; and Daniel J. Moore, in 1990; a brother, John Moore, in 1997; and a sister, Florence Hunter, in 1961. Surviving are his wife, Anne Kristin Moore of Bainbridge Island, Wash; two daughters, Theresa Olsen of Bainbridge Island, Wash; and Martha MooreStoll of Charlottesville, Va.; a sister, Joan Riordan of Atlanta; a grandson, Joshua Andrew Olsen; and three grand-daughters, Madeline Anne Olsen, Veronica Jae Moore-Stoll, and Isabelle Marie Moore-Stoll. Visiting hours will be from 7 to 9 P.M., Saturday, and 2 to 4 P.M. and 7 to 9 P.M. Sunday at Day Funeral Home, 361 Maple Place, Keyport. A Funeral Mass will be offered 11 A.M.

us,Little Tree Meets Destiny,"The poetry of E. E. Cummings, with its lively, inventive language and its frequent joy and optimism, has always held a special appeal for children, and his Christmas poem ''Little Tree'' is no exception. In it, a small child speaks wonderingly to a Christmas tree: ''look the spangles / that sleep all the year in a dark box / dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine, / the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads, / put up your little arms / and i'll give them all to you to hold / every finger shall have its ring / and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy.'' In this season's LITTLE TREE (Hyperion, $16.99; all ages), the well-known writer and illustrator Chris Raschka uses Cummings's poem as a jumping-off point for his own story about a Christmas tree's journey from forest to city, where ''a little boy, a little girl, a little mother and father and their little dog walked up and down the little streets of the little big city, looking and looking for their own special, just right, one and only, perfect little tree.'' Predictably, Little Tree is taken back to the family's apartment, where he finds ''his own special place in the world, a special little place that was waiting for him all his life.'' Raschka's illustrations are bright, bold and busy, with a preprimary-school feel to them, as if a precocious child had been turned loose with a paint box. The pictures are constructed out of basic geometric shapes -- squares, circles, rectangles and, of course, triangles, to represent Little Tree and friends. Raschka's intention, presumably, was to create a visual equivalent for Cummings's faux-nave style. The book has brightly striped endpapers that look like holiday wrapping paper, and is encased -- like a present you can look into -- in a clear plastic jacket. It's a simple story that's been told before, but one that might appeal to very young children who want predictability, security and a happy ending. The best part is Cummings's poem. But please, Chris Raschka, did you have to say ''little'' 53 times? Elizabeth Spires",2001-12-02T05:00:00+0000

At 37, Donna Karan is a noticeable person, not beautiful, but handsome, with an infectious smile and a commanding voice accented unmistakably with the vowels of New York.'' That description is affectionate and blunt, insightful and superficial, typical for Donovan, who loved to play up the dichotomies of her own character.

At the celebration, Donovan sat knee to knee with the triumphant, glowing designer and gazed gleefully into the camera: ''My daughter Donna,'' Donovan beamed. ''I'm so proud of her.''

That's exactly what's in store for you at the Sweet Treat Cafe on Route 130 in North Brunswick. And it has been for the past couple of years, since Rajaa Balech, a former baby-furniture store manager, took over the place formerly known as Liberty Roastery. Actually, Miss Balech, clarified, ''Our specialty is ice cream and fresh roasted nuts'' -- which may sound appetizing to some, but not necessarily to those showing up for breakfast. For them, there are bagels, buttered rolls, herbal tea, flavored coffee, hot chocolate, muffins, waffles, egg-and-cheese sandwiches, bacon, sausage, ham and more -- none for more than $3. Inside the place, which seats about 15, are shelves crammed with a variety of Lebanese products: pita bread, fruits, canned goods, syrups. There are also home-baked cookies -- Lebanese-style, of course -- and fresh-baked Lebanese pastry. ''I used to work at night as a Lebanese cook,'' Miss Balech said. When she finds the time, she also makes gift baskets of food, fruit or candy and nuts -- which might include cashews, pumpkin seeds, chickpeas, macadamias, Brazil nuts and roasted corn -- for special occasions and holidays, or just for the fun of it. There are also hot pretzels for a dollar each. Finally, of course, there's that headlined Hershey's ice cream in a variety of flavors: in cone, packed, sundae or shake, a real Lebanese treat.

She gave the choreographer an importance previously reserved for stars, directors, and great-name producers; and in doing so she prepared for the arrival of the choreographer-director, or &quot;superdirector,&quot; whose name appeared in lights on theater marquees above the other credits (it would be &quot;Bob Fosse's Chicago &quot; and &quot;Michael Bennett's A Chorus Line &quot;).

Almost, I worried, complacent: given that this nightmare began with an astoundingly cinematic image, I couldn't help thinking of the third-act war and horror movie clich: ''It's quiet out there -- too quiet.'' It wasn't just the lack of hijackings, or the slowdown in new outbreaks, or the virtual disappearance of the word ''weaponize'' in the public discourse, which for a while there in October looked to replace ''monetize'' as the 21st century's voguish verbed noun.

The very over-the-top-ness of Martha's productions testifies to her deep understanding of the holiday. Christmas has always been a time for extremes.

Such behavior would have been unseemly, undignified. White Charleston society was instead a world apart, a community of wealth, custom, and privilege built on the English model.

Endowed with such a distinguished pedigree (their ancestors had been sent to the New World by their king, Charles II, himself), they affected what they believed to be the aristocratic manner of their British cousins. Their belief in their way of life, and in their right to live that life as they pleased, formed the central tenet of their faith. ",2001-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Vattenfall has already purchased VEAG, eastern Germany's main electric utility, and it will put that together with the Berlin company. Mirant, which bought a minority stake in Bewag several years ago, had tried without success to block Vattenfall from acquiring the shares from E.on, one of western Germany's biggest power companies. It then tried to negotiate a collaboration with Vattenfall, but talks broke down in September.

But software companies have said their customers are more interested in advanced features than in better security.

us,The $69 Million Mayor,"New York City's mayor-elect, Michael Bloomberg, told New York magazine last spring that he planned to spend no more than about $30 million of his own money for his campaign. ''At some point, you start to look obscene,'' he explained. That remark is likely to haunt Mr. Bloomberg for a long time. His filing with the city's Board of Elections this week showed that he spent almost $69 million of his own money to become mayor. It is a record for New York and for the nation -- the biggest price tag for a mayoral campaign, or any race below the level of president, in American history. It comes close to the amount that Ross Perot spent on his third-party presidential campaign in 1992.",2001-12-05T05:00:00+0000

There are two types of best-of compilations for artists. The first simply collects the highest-charting singles, an approach generally used for pop superstars. The second mixes the artist's best-known material with the most meaningful and important songs, an approach used for artists whose fans admire their musicianship or songwriting. Ice Cube (with a couple of narrow-minded exceptions early in his solo career) deserves this latter approach. This parting shot from Priority, however, doesn't give Ice Cube the respect he deserves, focusing instead mostly on hits and material that fit in with current pop trends. Though most of his classics are here, from ''Once Upon a Time in the Projects'' to ''It Was a Good Day'' to ''Pushin' Weight,'' some of Ice Cube's best songs are neglected, among them his brilliant gender battle with Yo Yo, ''It's a Man's World,'' and his from-conception gangsta autobiography, ''The Product.''

As her band eases between funk and jazz and her backup singers follow her every turn, Ms. Scott explores love that's simultaneously carnal, spiritual, Afrocentric, political, pragmatic and contentious. A live disc (''826,'' named for its August recording date) expands material from Ms. Scott's debut album, loosening up the songs for an elated audience. A second disc (''+'') includes strong new material from the stage and the studio that delves further into Ms. Scott's multiple agendas. With jazz improvisations, scratchy funk, seductive vulnerability and forthright poetry, Ms. Scott calls for respect that's as strong as lust, while she posits righteousness as essential to the deepest pleasure.

In an alternate version of ''One Good Year,'' one of Mr. Cleaves's lost characters, desperately clinging to his last spark of optimism, offers the New Year's Day wish in the title.

(Capitol). There are some classic rock groups whose songs seem inseparable from the context of the albums in which they appear, and one of them is most definitely Pink Floyd. Its best albums were conceptual and architectural explorations loaded with musical, visual and lyrical themes that continue to stump fans. Thus, in attempting an impossible task, ''Echoes'' does the best job imaginable. It mixes the hits (''Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2''), the instrumental favorites (''One of These Days'') and the madcap laughs of the band's original singer, Syd Barrett (''Bike''). Add to this the album's references to the synchronicity that occurs when one plays the song ''Echoes'' over the ''Jupiter and Beyond'' music in the movie ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' and you have a best-of that just may belong in the band's excellent oeuvre. Compiling a best-of for Mr. Barrett, on the other hand, is an appropriate approach to the songs that were coaxed out of him in his fragile post-Pink Floyd mental state. Where his solo albums have their many moments of beauty, introspection, imagination and simplicity, this compilation cuts out the chaff (and adds the previously unreleased ''Bob Dylan Blues''), making it a necessary first purchase for those wishing to explore the mind of the tortured genius who sang lines from the heart like ''Inside me I feel/ Alone and unreal.''

us,"Holiday Forecast: Cool to Sultry, and a Chance of CD Flurries; Compilations, Live Albums And Reissues","SMASHING PUMPKINS: Greatest Hits'' (Virgin). This is a well-done tribute to the legacy of one of the most important rock bands of the 90's, and at one point the biggest. At 18 tracks, the first disc in this two-CD set, titled ''Rotten Apples,'' initially seems to fall short, missing so many of the band's great songs, but that is not its purpose. It tracks a few standout songs (not always hits) from each CD by a band that always managed to be completely alternative- and mainstream-minded at the same time, never losing its artistic vision in the morass of success pressures and intra-band problems. The collection traces the evolution of Smashing Pumpkins from the intensely textural rock onslaught of its first albums to the pop grandiosity of its glory days to the more conceptual and stylistically far-reaching songs of its final years. For the second disc, I would have liked an official CD of the band's Internet-only album, ''Machina II.'' Instead, there is a disc called ''Judas O,'' which is an impressively high-quality collection of B-sides, tracks from ''Machina II'' and other rarities (a follow-up to a similar collection from 1994, ''Pisces Iscariot'').

This eight-song album captures the latter, mostly with songs from the band's previous two recordings. Just as a concert can sometimes open up a band's album and make it more accessible, this live album strips away the production and studio effects to reveal the songs lurking behind some of the soundscapes on these albums. It also features a live acoustic version of an unreleased favorite, ''True Love Waits.'' Despite its relatively short length, this album actually works as an addition to the evolving oeuvre of this band, and is just as intense a listening experience as some of its previous albums, especially when paired with the bootleg of the band performing acoustic versions of their songs.

Throughout his brief, lambent career, Tim Buckley sang about a longing to lose himself: in music, in sensuality, in love. His supple, androgynous, sweetly pained voice floated through his songs like a passionate apparition. Before he died in 1975 at 28, he made nine albums, starting in folk-rock and meandering through jazz, blues, funk, soul and anything else that drew his restless ear. The two CD's of ''Morning Glory'' carefully compress his passage from poetic righteousness to howls of lust and sorrow, downplaying his abrasive final albums. ''The Dream Belongs to Me'' presents Buckley at his most introspective and volatile: experimenting with jazz backup in 1968 and working on incantatory songs in 1973, most of which would be contorted into would-be commercial arrangements on his last albums.

us,'This Is the Beat Generation'," In 1979, living in Edinburgh, Scotland, I set out to write the story of the Beat Generation and its descendants. I had published only a little -- a few poems and articles in literary magazines -- but my projected book had a grand scheme. It would be divided into two parts: the first would describe the Westward trail blazed by Jack Kerouac and his mildly criminal gang in the late 1940s, while the other would trace the journey to the East made by the proliferating Beat children -- hippies, heads, freaks -- in the 1960s and 70s. I was among them, and therefore felt entitled to say ""I am the man, I was"" etc. The book would be called ""Going West, Going East"". I had thumbed my way across half the world, but had not yet set foot in the United States, so, in Edinburgh University Library, I studied maps to find the best way out of Queens, New York, where Kerouac waved goodbye to his mother on his first trip to Denver in July, 1947; filleted old newspapers for current events (was there any significance in the fact that both Henry Ford and Al Capone died that year?); and tried to see the bestseller list as Kerouac the would-be novelist might have seen it. The book people were talking about The Plague by Albert Camus, a carefully crafted political allegory, not his sort of thing at all. After a faltering start, Kerouac got on the road. I traveled with him all the way across a quire of foolscap before running out of steam. ",2001-12-09T05:00:00+0000
us,Beauty Is Back,"For at least the last hundred years, art has defined itself less by the pursuit of beauty than by suspicion of it.

Modernism -- which began in Paris in the 1860's as a revolt against empty, academic prettiness -- unleashed the critical energies of art against its own aesthetic traditions. The art that came after modernism carried the criticism even further, placing the idea of beauty under permanent ideological suspicion. Artists from Francis Bacon to Damien Hirst, with their grisly subject matter; filmmakers from Godard to the Dogma 95 school, with their assaults on the audience's expectation of pleasure; musicians from Schnberg to Johnny Rotten, with their dissonant squalls: the recent art that has received the most attention has been that which challenges traditional canons of beauty -- and which, at times, challenges its audience's ability not to flinch.",2001-12-09T05:00:00+0000

He had inherited 80 acres on the Gulf of Mexico in Florida's Panhandle, and he thought he would build a nostalgic beach town there. But nostalgia soon gave way to what came to be called ''New Urbanism,'' and the result was Seaside, a tiny resort town that has attracted wide praise for its planning and architecture. Today, Florida has become a showcase for smart -- in several senses of the word -- development, with new towns that feature buildings by an array of illustrious architects and gifted young designers.",2001-12-09T05:00:00+0000

What is needed are interviews with Arab-Americans and other Americans of the Muslim faith who could show the freedom that exists in America to be a devout Muslim and to achieve professional success.

When it isn't absolutely necessary to fly, many are now trying teleconferencing instead. But teleconferencing, in its current form, has many drawbacks, including poor sound and image quality and unacceptable delays. Plus there is the eye-contact problem. Because the camera and the monitor are not in the same spot, it appears to the person with whom you're interacting that you're shifty or aren't paying attention. Worse, if the camera is mounted on top of the monitor, it looks as if you're trying to peek down the shirt of the person you're talking to.

Commenting on ''Sailboats Racing on the Delaware,'' the curators note the ''remarkable precision'' of Eakins's 1874 canvas. Then they quietly drop a bomb: ''When conservators . . . recently examined his paintings, they discovered that Eakins actually projected photographs directly onto canvases.

The Motion Picture Association of America, fearing loss of control of its content, sued him and persuaded a federal judge to order Corley to remove the program from his Web site -- and then later, to remove links to other sites where the code could be found. Corley has mounted an aggressive defense, and the case has been winding its way through the court system ever since. Written on a page, the DeCSS code looks innocuous enough: a dozen or so lines of letters, numbers and punctuation marks. But when it's run as a computer program, it performs a very specific action: it disables the encryption on a commercial DVD. And so the essence of the DeCSS case is a debate over the legal status -- and in fact the very nature -- of these few lines of code. Is the program a machine, subject to government regulation like a car or a gun? Or is it language, protected by the First Amendment?",2001-12-09T05:00:00+0000

It goes without saying that things go horribly wrong. Burt was 18 when he wrote THE HOLE (Ballantine, $19), and the book is being published in America now to coincide with an upcoming film adaptation starring Thora Birch. Fans compare the book to ''Lord of the Flies,'' but it never reaches the heights -- or, better, the depths -- of William Golding's classic. Still, it's a chilling little book. More akin to ''The Blair Witch Project'' than ''Lord of the Flies,'' the story unfolds in the third person and in the journal entries of one of the teenagers, and the writing is remarkably assured for such a young author. The characters, who are vulnerable because nobody knows they're in the basement except Martyn, the boy who put them there, follow a predictable path of early camaraderie, then mild squabbling and finally utter breakdown as the awful realization hits that Martyn is not returning. A twist at the end will -- if you don't find it simply annoying -- intrigue you with the new levels of meaning it lends to a story about that most elemental of human fears, being buried alive.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  KESSLER, MOE","KESSLER-Moe. Lifelong NYC resident as well as the founder, president and CEO of Outwater Plastics Industries and Architectural Products by Outwater, died on December 4th in Manhattan. Kessler, who, with the love and support of his late wife, Sylvia and their two sons, Richard and Peter, went on to establish Outwater Plastics Industries in August of 1972. Outwater Plastics was founded on the premise of providing small furniture and cabinet manufacturers with a source from which they could purchase extruded plastic mouldings in quantities that actually reflected their requirements rather than the set substantial minimum quantities dictated by the plastic extrusion manufacturers at the time. Kessler, however, did not start his career in the Plastics Industry. Upon his discharge from the Navy, Kessler went to work for a large wholesale hardware company in New York City. It was quite by chance that Kessler began to experiment with Plastics. Having realized the potential advantages in manufacturing with and use of this then new material, Kessler decided to examine the suitability of manufacturing mouldings out of Plastic instead of the conventional materials from which they were then being produced. As Kessler had accurately envisioned, it was not long before his initial Plastic products became a huge success. Kessler began to manufacture other Plastic extruded mouldings that, up until that point, had only been available in metal. Each new success readily spawned another. The Plastics Industry began to prosper, thus giving way to more products. Not only did Kessler serve to open the manufacturers' eyes to numerous products that had not previously been available, because the Plastics manufacturers simply could not cater to the needs of the small furniture and cabinet manufacturers, through default, Outwater Plastics became the first Plastics distributor in the industry. From the vendor of a single product back in August of 1972, today Outwater Plastics and its corporate affiliate, Architectural Products by Outwater, with facilities in New Jersey and Arizona, are recognized as a major international supplier of nearly 40,000 standard and innovative component products to numerous industries. Best remembered for his generosity and contributions that he has made to the lives of everyone who knew him, Kessler attributed the success of Outwater Plastics and Architectural Products by Outwater to the dedication and hard work of its employees, whom he referred as his ''best investment in the whole world.'' Kessler further cited the generosity and support of his charter vendors, all who believed in Kessler and his dream to help keep his then young company operational in the early days. Kessler ultimately credited his success to Sylvia (nee Wallace), his wife of over forty years, who predeceased him in 1995. It was her wisdom and inspiration, in conjunction with his foresight and ability, not to mention ''Luck'' that helped Moe Kessler to realize his dreams. Kessler is survived by his second wife, Linda, his two sons, Richard and Peter, daughter-inlaw, Susan, and was the beloved grandfather of Stephen, Faye Lauren and William.

But neither is it as urban as that from Ohio, with its bridge going into downtown Cleveland, or the one from Illinois, which depicts, incongruously, a few ears of corn overlooking some tall Chicago buildings. The stamp will be available on a sheet with those from the other states in April. On the back of each will be its state bird, flower, tree, capital and the date it entered the union.

In addition, he was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Westbury Friends School. A true practitioner of the peaceful ways of the Religious Society of Friends, he possessed a great love of his fellow man and instinctively reached out to offer assistance to those less fortunate. His passion for people was evident in his optimistic manner and his talent for affirming the most positive characteristics of those with whom he interacted. His real gift was an ability to move groups with diverse interests to a common goal using a wonderful blend of verbal and written communication skills. Mr. Rushmore always gave generously of himself. At an early age, he became interested in the field of health care and became a well recognized figure at numerous Long Island medical associations and facilities. He served on the New York State Board of Medical Ethics and was Trustee Emeritus for Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, New York, where he had been associated for more than 50 years. A native Long Islander, Leon Rushmore was born in Roslyn Heights. His professional career was spent at the Long Island Lighting Company where he retired as Vice President of Employee Relations in 1975. Active in fund raising for numerous charitable organizations, he was also a Board Member of Planned Parenthood and a Founding Board Member of Friends of Long Island Heritage. In February 1932, he married Caroline Jackson of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the young couple took up residence on the family farm in Roslyn Heights, where in addition to their professional careers, they operated several vegetable stands during the war years of the 1930s and '40s. They shared a love for the game of tennis and actively engaged in the sport until prohibited by health restrictions, at which point they became faithful observers of popular matches. Influential in developing legislation for life care facilities in New York State, he and Caroline were the initial residents at a model life care facility, Jefferson Ferry, in Port Jefferson, New York. In addition to his beloved wife, he is survived by his two daughters, Mary Lee Rushmore of New Harbor, Maine, and Carly Hellen of Chicago, Illinois, and his son, Stephen Rushmore of Roslyn Heights, New York as well as five grandchildren and five greatgrandchildren.

It just added to his noted repertory of creative cream cheeses: from olive-pimento to walnut-raisin to strawberry. Mr. Ingram, a former trucker, makes them at Dee's Bagel Cafe/Deli & Grill in Apple Plaza in Monroe. Outside the four-year-old establishment, diners are greeted by a smiling 6-foot-plus-tall wooden caricature of the 5-foot-3-inch former nail technician Denice (Dee) Ingram, John's wife. The wooden Dee is holding a hamburger, surrounded by a muffin, coffee and other goodies. Inside are sculptures of bagels that transmute into, for example, a tossed salad, a Danish, a bowl of soup. The Ingrams, who commute from Burlington Township, about a half-hour away, draw most of their patrons from the handful of adult communities in the township. At lunchtime, the cafe can serve up to 26 diners, many from surrounding businesses like a Sony warehouse, Aetna and Home Depot. There also is delivery for orders of at least $15. Lunch can be anything from salads and club, combo or deli sandwiches and wraps to baskets, burgers and grill -- all $4 to $6. Available any time, is a dish ($4.59) made from eggs, three cheeses, bacon and onions: the ''Deelux'' Cheese Omelette. Norm Oshrin",2001-12-09T05:00:00+0000

The participant lifts at a creepingly slow rate for 10 seconds, then lowers for 10 seconds, repeating four to six times.

Pucci and Missoni are working with original signature patterns and prints. Taking a cue from art galleries, Valentino has begun numbering reissued pieces from its archive. And Yves Saint Laurent has made his couture more specialized than ever.

us,Mets Acquire 11-Time All-Star From Cleveland," BOSTON, Dec. 11 -- The Mets acquired Roberto Alomar from the Cleveland Indians in a blockbuster eight-player trade today, immediately upgrading themselves with an 11-time All-Star who is considered the best second baseman in the major leagues. The Mets dealt outfielder Matt Lawton, elite prospect Alex Escobar, reliever Jerrod Riggan and two players to be named while also getting two minor leaguers in the deal, according to a baseball official involved in the talks. General Manager Steve Phillips predicted on Monday night that the Mets would probably make a trade before the winter meetings ended and, several hours later, he followed with a major transaction. Alomar is a .306 career hitter and has won 10 Gold Glove Awards so he will give the Mets a boost at the top of their lineup while also stabilizing their middle infield. Now that the Mets have acquired Alomar, it is obvious they will move second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo to third base. Alfonzo, who shifted from third to second once before and is in the last year of his contract, had expressed doubts about switching back. Although Phillips said he had tremendous respect for Alfonzo's opinion, he planned to explore any options that would better the team. Even before getting Alomar, the Mets were convinced that Alfonzo would switch if they asked him. Now Alfonzo has no choice. Alomar, who turns 34 in February, is a future Hall of Fame player who is only expendable because Cleveland is trying to shed payroll. He has two years and $16 million left on his contract. While Lawton is arbitration eligible and could earn more than $5 million this season, Escobar and Riggan will barely make above the minimum salary. The Mets began discussions with the Indians two weeks ago and the talks intensified at the meetings. There is an 11 a.m. press conference today to announce the trade. ",2001-12-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"In Los Angeles, a Museum Under a Plastic Bubble","The decision is in, and it's in favor of Rem Koolhaas's radical proposal to tear down most of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and start over. The museum named Mr. Koolhaas, the Dutch architect, above, the winner of a design competition to make over its hodgepodge of buildings on Wilshire Boulevard. His scheme, top, would replace almost all the buildings with an exhibition plaza under a translucent plastic roof. (Art would be hung on freestanding displays, above right.) ''We found that it was the most radical short-term solution and most fiscally conservative long-term,'' said Andrea Rich, the museum's president and director. Mr. Koolhaas was one of five leading architects to submit plans. The others were Steven Holl Architects of New York; Daniel Libeskind, the Berlin-based architect; Thom Mayne of Morphosis in Los Angeles; and the French architect Jean Nouvel. If the new museum is built -- it is estimated to cost $200 million, and the money still has to be raised -- it will join other modern landmarks in Los Angeles, including Frank Gehry's Disney Concert Hall, Raphael Moneo's Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and the already open Getty Center by Richard Meier. By hiring Mr. Koolhaas, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art may be making up for a past oversight. It ignored the Modernist giant Mies van der Rohe and hired a local architect, William Pereira, for its first building, finished in 1964. Perhaps to make amends, Mr. Koolhaas has nicknamed his proposed plaza, between Wilshire Boulevard and the museum's spacious garden, the Miesian Court. FRANCES ANDERTON",2001-12-13T05:00:00+0000

Over all, city costs are anticipated to rise nearly 12 percent, to $531 million next year. The state pays only half of the costs of adult shelters, up to $72 million.

His two sons, the late Dr. Peter C. Rizzo, and Attending Staff member Dr. Thomas D. Rizzo, followed their father into the Hospital's residency program and went on to become highly respected orthopedic surgeons as did his grandson Dr. Peter F. Rizzo. The eldest Dr. Rizzo's work in orthopedics contributed greatly to the progress made in that field and earned him the respect and admiration of his colleagues. During his long career he treated many thousands of patients not only with skill and expertise but also with limitless kindness and compassion toward them and their families. Dr. Rizzo's devotion to his profession has inspired generations of doctors who strive to follow his example of selfless service and has engendered the love and gratitude of those patients who benefited from his knowledge. He will be greatly missed and long remembered by all fortunate enough to have known him. We extend our deepest sympathy to the entire Rizzo family. Richard L.

Even the Clinton administration's development of defenses to protect troops against short-range missiles like the Scud threatened the viability of the ABM treaty because the treaty contains no clear demarcation between defenses against shorter-range missiles, which are permitted, and ""national"" defenses against longer-range missiles, which are prohibited. Near the end of his term, President Clinton proposed a national missile defense system based in Alaska and focused on North Korean missiles that would have violated the treaty.

His parents emigrated from Italy with their families; his from Fondi, hers from Sorano in the early 1900's. Harold became interested in the violin at an early age. In his late teens he switched to the viola, which suited him perfectly because of his impressive stature of 6'1'' with broad shoulders and large hands. He soon began what was to be a long and illustrious career, which spanned over 60 years. This began with the Bridgeport W.P.A. Symphony where he spent his free time working on the classical repetoire. This diligence paid off, and he was accepted into the National Youth Orchestra conducted by Leopold Strakowski, which toured South America twice. He studied at Juilliard for a short time, but his study with Raphael Bronstein was, he felt, more valuable. Harold played in The New York Philharmonic and then The NBC Orchestra for nin years under the baton of Arturo Toscanini. He performed in Carnegie Hall with Heifetz and Piatigorsky as part of a sextet. He played in the Casals Festival in Puerto Rico a number of times. His tours consisted of the American String Quartet, solo tour of Europe in the 1960's, and the final tour in 1987 with Frank Sinatra. His studio career in radio/TV days was with Sinatra, Como and Crosby to mention a few. He was part of many soundtracks for recordings, movies and commercials, which continued up until his death. Harold's passion for music, Italy and life, was evident to all who knew and loved him. A biography in progress, being written by a student/colleague should be released in the very near future. Harold is survived by his wife, Mary (Lewis), his brother Paolo, his son Michael Bradley Albert (Diane), two daughters, Suzanne Hallie (Seth) Glasser, and Hallie Adrienne Coletta, five grandchildren, Jennifer and Adam Colletta, and Alex, Anna, and Nick Glasser.

In the comedy ''The Royal Tenenbaums,'' he plays the self-absorbed patriarch of a family of despondent geniuses, and his airy cunning is in dry counterpoint to Wes Anderson's arch, storybook compositions. In John Moore's ''Behind Enemy Lines,'' he's an admiral who mostly squints into monitors and assures a trapped young soldier that he won't be abandoned. But instead of John Wayne-like breast-beating, Mr. Hackman seems eaten up by the character's impotence, quietly riven by opposing inner forces of military discipline and rage. In ''Heist,'' he transcends the stifling universe of the writer and director David Mamet, in which spontaneous feeling tends to be trampled under a procession of double-, triple- and quadruple-crosses.

Try as I may to order a single pecan Danish ($1.95), I always fail; the pastries are simply too good to eat just one. They're enough to test even Fergie's willpower. Then again, everything in this family-run Italian bakery puts self-control to the test. At breakfast, it might be the crumb cake ($5.95 a sheet), topped with crumbs -- if that's the right word -- about two inches long and an inch and a half deep. In the afternoon, it might be cheesecake ($8.25) or chocolate rugelach ($10.95 a pound), made with an achingly tender butter-and-cream-cheese dough. At the moment, real temptation lies in the traditional Italian Christmas cookies, which the head baker, Buddy Valastro Jr., turns out by the thousands -- roughly 20,000 during the season, in fact. The bakery even stays open late on Christmas Eve with 20 people behind the counter (instead of the usual 3) to handle the rush. Hoboken's large Italian community orders by name: mostaccioli, struffoli, torrone, biscotti natalizi. Everyone else just points, selecting their favorites among the rows of almond-paste cookies, nut bars, honey balls and so-called love knots, iced-cake-like creations made with a lemon sour cream dough. Two-pound trays loaded with 15 varieties are sold for $19.95. Mr. Valastro Jr., who learned the trade at his father's side and began baking at age 12, said the 91-year-old bakery goes through 300 pounds of butter a week. No wonder willpower has no chance.

But Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, merely called the move ''mistaken'' and noted that Russia would retain enough nuclear weapons, 1,500 to 2,200, to overwhelm whatever Mr. Bush builds. He moved on to talking about building a new ''strategic relationship.'' China, not a party to the treaty, was harsher in its criticism, but accepted Mr. Bush's offer to hold strategic talks as well.

us,Brown-Bagging It,"From the first page, John Speirs's book THE LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS GIFT (Abrams, $16.95; ages 4 and up) transports the reader to a distant time, yet to a place that seems comfortingly familiar. Drawing on his study of the Bruegels and Hans Memling, Speirs sets the biblical Christmas story in Renaissance Europe, following the journey of a boy and three wise men to a distant stable. Along the way, they are joined by scores of everyday people with gifts for a new king: farmers with loaves of bread, nomads with bright rugs, beekeepers with combs of honey. Not the least of them is the boy, who carries a brown sack with his gift, even though he is told by the wise men that he has nothing worth offering. He does, of course, and the mystery of the brown sack, along with the implicit challenge of finding the boy in each illustration, makes for captivating reading. In his text, Speirs uses a soothing, poetic repetition that builds, layer upon layer, as new groups join the journey. The tale is simple yet evocative, faltering slightly at the end, which has a feel-good quality and lacks the freshness that Speirs brings to the rest of the book. That is a minor flaw, especially because the accompanying art and its presentation are stunning. The illustrations, on right-hand pages, are framed in gold. The text, on left-hand pages, is framed with illuminations and embellished with small illustrations, like a 15th-century manuscript. The spiritual images -- Christ child, Madonna, angels, star -- radiate with a subtle gold overlay. Speirs's pictures -- of a caravan traveling through spired cities, mountain passes, seaside villages, wheat fields at harvest time -- do far more than illustrate the story. They enhance it, giving it depth and movement as they celebrate both God and humanity. In an author's note, Speirs writes that ''The Little Boy's Christmas Gift'' is the result of a lifetime's research. It shows. Doug Ward",2001-12-16T05:00:00+0000

us,BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION; Does That Come With Whitewalls?,"How close did postwar America's auto industry come to building a fallout shelter on wheels? Or a family car with a retractable patio? According to THE LAST DREAM-O-RAMA: The Cars Detroit Forgot to Build, 1950-1960 (Crown, $25), not close enough. The dream-car caricatures in Bruce McCall's wry, satirical glimpse at 50's style symbolize the ''fatuousness, bad taste and shameless excess'' that marked the era. McCall, the author of ''Zany Afternoons'' and a frequent contributor to The New Yorker, writes, ''You can read a culture in its cars, and judging by the cars of that time, American culture was in a state.'' His imaginary cars -- elongated, brightly colored assemblages of chrome, vinyl and whitewalls -- lampoon everything from popular culture to geopolitics. The Vegastar StripStreak Headliner Deluxe boasts a slot-machine gearshift and a speedometer that shows three cherries when the car hits 100 miles per hour; the Bossmobile Gal Friday Execustreak comes complete with an office, a secretary at the wheel and Scotch bottles stashed in a desk drawer; the Nixoneer Squelchoramic RN, one of McCall's finest contraptions, demonstrates to Khrushchev and the Soviets the superiority of American engineering (the car sports an assortment of ''electric domestic labor-saving devices''). McCall provides each car with a rationale behind its design and its ultimate demise. The book closes with a Naming Guide (name your own dream car in seconds!) and a brief survey of dream cars from around the world.

It is reinforced by Atta family photos: one of young Mohamed, slender arms snaking around his sister, or in another, languid cheek obliging his mother, delicate frame at anxious remove from his father.

He attended public school there and went on to receive both his undergraduate and law degrees from Cornell University. He was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1941. His first employment was with the firm of Root, Clark, Buckner and Ballentine in New York City. In 1941 he was called to active duty in the U.S. Army.

From that odor, I almost knew the house the shirt had come from. If it had been mailed 40 years ago, it could have come from my aunt's house in Des Moines, a hand-me-down from a cousin.

us,'The War Against Clich'," In 1919, after prolonged study, the Harvard ethologist William Morton Wheeler pronounced the male wasp an ethological non-entity. An animal behaviourist had scrutinized the male wasp and found  no behaviour. We can well imagine the male wasp's response to such a verdict: his initial shock and hurt; his descent into a period of depressed introspection; his eventual decision to behave more intriguingly. For nowadays, according to a recent Scientific American , interest in the long-neglected male is flourishing, a tribute to the animal's broad array of activities. Male humans will surely feel for their brothers in the wasp kingdom. After a phase of relative obscurity, we too have rallied. In fact, we seem to have bounced back pretty well immediately, with all kinds of fresh claims on everyone's attention. Male wounds. Male fights. Male grandeur. Male whimpers of neglect.

In ''Lure,'' for example, the speaker remembers both the sexy adult neighbor who flirted with him when he was a boy and his own obliviousness of her appeal; ''I didn't even have to pretend / I didn't catch on,'' he says. But when, years later, the speaker meets again the husband she has since cast off, the man's sad-dog eyes suggest that while we experience more as we go along, we don't necessarily learn all that much about love or anything else. Actually, the poems here about sex (''Sex and Poetry,'' ''The Pond of Desires'') are better than the ones about love, a topic so daunting it requires an indirect approach. For the same reason, among Harrison's best are the poems on cars, rock music, skin diving: after all, these subjects open doors to the place in the heart where we come closest to knowing who we really are. A poem central to this collection is ''Horseshoe Contest,'' in which men spend hours at a game that will confirm ''something / unchanging at their core, / small but of a certain heft.'' Another is ''Three Wishes,'' where a father tells his grown children each of them can take a souvenir from the family summer home before it's sold, though in this contemporary fairy tale, as in the old ones, what one wants and what one gets are not always the same. We don't become smarter as we get older, Harrison seems to be saying; we just have more to be aware of. David Kirby",2001-12-23T05:00:00+0000

Some of the pressure arises from the desire to help survivors of the terrorist attacks deal with the burden of grief. Some of it also arises from the tendency of bureaucracies to take on momentum with a logic all their own. This pressure can easily result in the burial of meaning rather than the discovery of it.",2001-12-23T05:00:00+0000

Mr. McGovern made a peaceful crossing into new life on December 19 in Mount Vernon Hospital. He was elected to the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York in 1961 and served on Board for 14 years -the last six as Chancellor. This caps a long litany of public service contributions rendered while Mr. McGovern was practicing and teaching law. Until 1999, he served on the Board of Calvary Hospital for 18 years, the last several as Chair. Mr. McGovern was widely known as the consummate lawyer. A partner for many years in the firm of Sullivan, Donovan, Hanrahan, McGovern and Lane, in 1996, Mr. McGovern moved his office from Pine Street in Manhattan to Main Street in White Plains, where he practiced with son Lawrence in the firm of McGovern and Dawson. At Fordham University School of Law he taught a generation of law students, who still refer to him with respect and affection as Professor McGovern. Mr. McGovern's study at home is dotted with the dozen honorary doctorates he was awarded and the numerous awards he received for his teaching. Few were surprised when Fordham Law School in 1996 selected Mr. McGovern for its first ''Second Harvest'' award for one who ''has made exceptional contributions to society in the humanities, the legal profession, business world, community, civic or charitable affairs.'' He did it all. Those who know ''Joe'' McGovern best, though, point out that his proudest moments were spent as devoted teammate with his deceased wife Marie and the six children, 22 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. The only child of Jane Fahy and Philip McGovern, immigrants from Ireland, Mr. McGovern was born in the Bronx on February 22, 1909. The first of his generation to attend college, he graduated with honors from both Fordham College and Fordham Law School. Mr. McGovern is predeceased by his sons Joe-Ray, and Philip; he is survived by his daughter Teesie Melillo, sons Lawrence, Joseph, and Ray, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. A Mass of the Resurrection will be held on Monday, December 24, at 9:00 AM in Fordham University Chapel in the Bronx.

Despite the setting, the brothers make no apologies for their wine elitism. ''If I had to sell Korbel or even Perrier-Jouet in volume every day, I couldn't get up in the morning,'' said Dave Moore, who sold just those types of labels to restaurants before starting Moore Brothers in 1996 with his brother, Greg, a former sommelier at the elite Bec Fin restaurant in Philadelphia. ''I look at us like the farm stand in Glassboro where you get that lumpy tomato that tastes like a tomato should. The other guys sell the three shrink-wrapped things you get in the supermarket.'' Yet not everything on the wooden racks at Moore Brothers will burn a hole in your wallet. Yes, for your New Year's party, you could go for the $90-a-bottle 1990 Ployez-Jacquemart Liesse D'Harbonville. But if you want to spend less, Dave will happily steer you toward one of his favorite sparkling wines, the Clos Baudoin Vouvray Aigle D'or for only $15. ''I have a friend whose New Year's party I go to every year,'' Mr. Moore said. ''He serves this through the evening, then at midnight, he brings out the Perrier-Jouet,'' a Champagne that costs four times what the Vouvray does. Mr. Moore shakes his head at the thought. ''Everyone wants him to go back to this. It tastes better. It is better.'' The store is at a constant 55 degrees, the better for wine storage, though it means sweaters even in summer. Moore Brothers keeps computer files of wines bought for customers, so they can easily order another of that obscure bottle they liked or avoid the one they didn't. And there is a children's play area, to entertain the offspring of the take-your-time-please customers. Robert Strauss",2001-12-23T05:00:00+0000

Here's another option for toasting 2002: Sofia, a blanc de blancs that isn't sweet yet has a touch of mellow charm, thanks to muscat in the blend. It's frothy, but not aggressively so, and is lower in alcohol -- 11.5 percent -- than most Champagnes. The wine, made by Niebaum-Coppola in California, was first produced for the 1999 wedding of Sofia Coppola, the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, the winery's owner.

The corks identify the varieties, which include the fairly pungent saw palmetto, as well as more familiar orange blossom, blueberry and buckwheat. Easing the corks back into the vials takes a little effort because they are fitted very tightly. But once the honey has been consumed, the vials in the stand make great flower holders. These are all-natural raw honeys, and many are organic. The set is $49 at Nice House, 117 Perry Street (Hudson Street).

us,World Briefing | Europe: Russia: Belarus Wants Quick Wedding,"Talks on a long-proposed union of Russia and Belarus, never trouble free, struck new sour notes at a meeting in Moscow of a council charged with consummating the merger. President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus accused the Kremlin of foot-dragging on plans to meld its economy with its far poorer neighbor in 2005, warning that ''either we implement what we agreed or we make serious changes to our plans and say it openly.'' But President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said the union's success rested on gradual implementation. Meanwhile, Belarus's prime minister said that $2.3 million of the council's budget, marked as missing after an audit, was not stolen. Russia's prime minister declined to characterize the discovery.

The officers, including three captains, were treated for exposure to a chemical spray used around 11 p.m. to subdue the prisoners, said Sandra Lewis Smith, a deputy correction commissioner. She said that the prisoners' injuries were unrelated to the spray and that the incident lasted only a few minutes. Robert Gangi, executive director of the Corrections Association of New York, a prisoners' rights group, said the spray, known as C4, should be used only as a last resort.

Howard saved City Center in the 1970's and worked tirelessly to assure both the survival and success of this landmark cultural institution. Thanks to Howard Squadron, City Center thrives today. His relationship with City Center began in his teens when he joined others in the top balcony to view and appreciate performances, and it never wavered as he ascended to the Chairmanship later in life. His devoted stewardship guaranteed a home for the New York City based dance companies such as, The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Paul Taylor Dance Company, Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theatre of Harlem, American Ballet Theatre and others. City Center Encores! Great American Musicals in Concert was born during his leadership. Though Howard was involved in many other worthy and prestigious causes and organizations, he was always and unfailingly ''there'' for City Center. Our sympathy and love to Anne and all of the family.

With only three weeks left in his race against Barry Goldwater , his personal lawyer, Abe Fortas , calls to report that the president's longest-serving aide, Walter Jenkins, has been arrested for performing oral sex on another man in the basement pay toilet of a Washington Y.M.C.A. An incredulous Johnson immediately takes charge of damage control. He directs Fortas to force Jenkins's resignation and to spirit damaging files from Jenkins's White House safe; orders the F.B.I. to produce an official report declaring that Jenkins is not a national security threat; asks the Pentagon to scour Jenkins's military reserve file for positive comments from his commanding officer, Barry Goldwater; urges the attorney general to intensify a bribery investigation of Goldwater's running mate, William Miller ; coaches the first lady on how to secretly assure the Jenkins family that its financial future will be secure; and commissions a poll on the scandal's impact from his private pollster. Johnson suspects a Republican frame-up and fears the Jenkins arrest will cost him the presidency. ''Every farmer in the country is upset about it,'' he tells Fortas.

In December 1994, a year into his reign as a brawling Republican champion for a Democratic city, Mr. Giuliani promised: ''I'll tell the people of the city what I believe is in the best interests of the city, what I think is the truth, rather than what I think people would like to hear.''

us,Private Sector; A Return to Extravagance by Chrysler,"Amid all the invitations descending on the automotive media for the Detroit Auto Show next weekend, one is particularly intriguing. Chrysler has rented a 1929 red-brick firehouse near the show site, the Cobo Exhibition Center, and is turning it into a big party space where Dieter Zetsche, Chrysler's chief executive, and other senior managers will be tending bar. This is not the first time Chrysler has put on an extravagant party at the show. Two years ago, Chrysler turned an old warehouse into a swing-dance nightclub at a reported cost of $2 million. Given the rate at which Chrysler's fortunes are evaporating, the bartending practice might be useful in case any of the company's executives are looking for work soon.

us,Southern Comforts,"Had Elvis been from Detroit, he would have still had a brilliant career. The difference between Northern Elvis and Southern Elvis would have come after the time of his death. In the North, his house would have been cleaned, sold and bought by other people who would have actually lived there. Perhaps they would occasionally say to guests at dinner parties, ''Did you know that Elvis Presley once lived in this house?'' But Elvis was from the South, which means that for the price of a ticket you can stand behind velvet ropes at Graceland and look at the sad shag carpet in the Jungle Room or drive down to Tupelo, Miss., and tour the little house where he was born. He was, after all, a poor country boy who drove a delivery truck, loved his mother and ate bad food, which means he had all the fundamental elements of Southern heroism. It takes a certain amount of storytelling to make a person into a myth, and that's something we've specialized in down here since Davy Crockett first cut his name into a tree.

us,Prague Rock,"Milan Hlavsa was a young man in Prague who played the electric bass, and in the fall of 1968 he organized a rock band. It was called the Plastic People of the Universe, with the name in English instead of in Czech. The Czech Republic was in those days part of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, which was part of the Warsaw Pact, which was under the thumb of the Soviet Union, which was ruled by the Communist Party. Rock bands with English-language names faced an uncertain future in that environment. Hlavsa's Plastic People of the Universe began by playing covers of the more adventurous rockers from America, the Velvet Underground, the Fugs, the Doors, the Mothers of Invention and others. Then the Plastic People took up their own compositions. Their popularity grew. And the government, by now worried, stripped the band of its license to perform. The Plastic People were obliged to build their own equipment and to perform mostly in private. Sometimes they played at a farm owned by a dissident playwright, Vaclav Havel, when he wasn't in jail. In 1976, a particularly bad year, the band was arrested. The indictment cited lyrics of ''extreme vulgarity with an anti-Socialist and antisocial impact, most of them extolling nihilism, decadence and clericalism.'' Clericalism was a terrible accusation in those days. The Communist press railed against ''moral filth.'' But the authorities had gone too far. Havel and the dissident intellectuals in Czechoslovakia organized a petition in the band's defense, and this petition marked a turning point in the history of the Soviet bloc. The petitioners did not express a right-wing ideology, or a left-wing ideology, or any ideology at all. They merely called for the right to be oneself and to think one's own thoughts -- the right to be honest. Their argument was extremely moderate and reasonable, and it proved to be extremely difficult to oppose. The petition was called Charter 77. Some 1,300 people eventually signed, which was a lot. And in 1989, when the East bloc revolution broke out, the signatories of Charter 77 put together a political organization, and their organization overthrew the Communist Party. Did Milan Hlavsa and the Plastic People contribute to the revolution merely by being martyrs, or was their music itself a revolutionary force? ''The ironic thing about the Plastic People is that our music had absolutely no political message,'' Hlavsa once said in looking back. The music consisted of sardonic vocals on top of jeering, bass-driven rhythms, often as not on a single chord, with a guitar, saxophone and viola screaming hysteria overhead. But this sound matched the human rights argument perfectly. It was the sound of personal honesty, stripped of every adornment, without sentimentality, without posturing, without falsity. Milan Hlavsa had his days of glory. He and the band once performed at the White House for Presidents Havel and Clinton, two rock fans. But when he died of cancer, on Jan. 5, he was only 49. Whatever the specific cause of Hlavsa's cancer may have been, it is worth recalling that during the years of Communism, industries freely polluted the atmosphere without any of the inhibitions that come from public protest and that life expectancy sank accordingly. And so Hlavsa suffered, not just from police persecution. But the man did play the electric bass, and he refused not to play the electric bass, and those jeering rhythms of his told a truth, which turned out be unstoppably powerful.",2001-12-30T05:00:00+0000

Steiner, which runs other entertainment centers around the country, would take over management of the aquarium from the state and add 72,000 feet to the north and later develop 20 additional acres as a shopping and entertainment complex.

us,Order of Magnitude,"It took awhile to unlearn the number 6,000. Though the estimated death toll at the World Trade Center has been falling steadily since early October -- and has by now shrunk by half -- the smaller number proved hard to absorb. As late as Thanksgiving, the larger figure was still being cited by disc jockeys and pundits, by Northern Alliance fighters and admirers of Osama bin Laden. Maybe even now it remains embedded in the minds of Americans who have been paying less avid attention to the news than they did in September. And of those fully aware of the revised number, many seemed reluctant to adopt it. When lower death estimates were first reported, few Americans were in the mood for revisionism, even of the most benign and understandable sort. Nobody wanted to insert the word ''only'' in front of a new tally of the dead. Body counts often become a proxy measure of a tragic event's significance; as the historian Karel Bartosek has written, they are ''a mathematical truth'' that ''transforms mass deaths into a kind of sacrament.''

All right, so maybe it's not the 15th century, as the faux medieval decorations in the cavernous dining room would affect. It's more like the 1950's, when comfort food, humongous dining rooms and homespun gaudiness ruled the dining scene. The Pub's main dining room holds 500, and even on a Monday night it can be filled. And so can the diners, with the huge portions, none of them a bit culinarily cute. The specialty of the house is red meat. The front of the main dining room is a set of six open brick ovens under a massive copper canopy. Large men in toques shove large steaks and chops in those ovens continuously through lunch and dinner. The manager's special is a slow-roasted boneless 14-ounce prime rib, with a baked Yorkshire-puff potato on the side. With it comes unlimited trips to the 20-foot-long salad/bread/cheese bar that sits under what must be the biggest moose head in South Jersey currently adorned with a floppy Santa cap. A large round mound of bread, with a knife for you to slice yourself, is plopped on every table. All this will set you back only $17.95. The names on the menu evoke the pre-jumpsuit Elvis. There's a filet mignon steak-a-bob ($14.95, with all the above extras), a half char-broiled chicken ($11.55) and twin all-jumbo lump crabmeat cakes ($17.95). The carafes of house wine are called flagons, and the Pub still advertises 1 1/2 drinks, an extra half-finger of hard stuff going into every cocktail. Desserts are similarly one-and-a-halfish, the high-rising chocolate turtle cheesecake($4.35) billowing with caramel, pecans, whipped cream and chocolate chips topping the 20-item list. Even the most gourmandesque succumb to doggie-bagdom, taking home the honest-and-true retro experience for another day. Robert Strauss",2001-12-30T05:00:00+0000

us,They Brought Enough Film,"A by now familiar story is told again in SOUTH WITH ENDURANCE. Shackleton's Antarctic Expedition 1914-1917: The Photographs of Frank Hurley (Simon & Schuster, $50). In 1914, Sir Ernest Shackleton and 27 men set out in the ship Endurance with the harebrained idea of crossing Antarctica on foot. At the Weddell Sea, the ship is beset in the ice pack and eventually sinks. The men camp on the ice for months. When the floes break up, they take to three small boats, and six days later land on stark Elephant Island. Shackleton and five others then undertake, arguably, the greatest open-boat voyage ever -- 800 miles to South Georgia over the wildest seas on earth. Remarkably, they make it, but they land on the uninhabited side of the island. With almost no equipment, Shackleton and two men cross the uncharted mountains in 36 hours (recently three world-class climbers with modern gear re-enacted the feat; it took three days). Then Shackleton rescues everybody back at Elephant Island. The shelf of books this epic has inspired includes one consisting of leadership tips inspired by Shackleton. He wouldn't have minded. Among many other things, he was an opportunist out for the main chance, and a pictorial record of his expedition was crucial to its financial success. That's why he and his photographer, Frank Hurley, went back to the sinking Endurance and lugged many photographic plates across the ice and sea. These photographs appeared in the surprisingly popular 1999 show at the American Museum of Natural History, and most were reproduced in Caroline Alexander's best seller, ''The Endurance.'' Now all of Hurley's photographs from the expedition (and some from others) are reproduced in a handsome coffee-table book. They are as stunning as ever, and surely Shackleton and Hurley would be delighted that the images they fought so tenaciously to save have endured. Robert R. Harris",2001-12-30T05:00:00+0000

us,A Fashion Beat,"The fashion flock has been waiting on the edge of its Manolos for the release of the soundtrack to Wes Anderson's new movie, ''The Royal Tenenbaums.'' The CD, with songs from the Ramones, Nico, the Velvet Underground and the Rolling Stones, is poised to become the soundtrack of the fashion season, much as Mr. Anderson's ''Rushmore'' soundtrack was several years ago. Jeffrey Kalinsky, owner of Jeffrey New York, put it this way: ''We think it'll be the hot soundtrack to shop to -- we're definitely putting it in our repertory.'' Disc jockeys like Sky Nellor of Lotus and Isla, and Joel Warren, who is a co-owner of the Warren Tricomi salon and who moonlights at the club Halo, are also planning to work the music into their spins. Of course the fashion angle shouldn't be such a surprise, considering that the film is a sartorial showcase, with Gwyneth Paltrow in minks and Lacoste dresses, Owen Wilson in western Gucci, Gene Hackman in sharp pinstriped suits and Ben Stiller in red Adidas warm-up suits. ''Even so,'' Mr. Anderson said, ''I don't really understand this kind of fashion attention -- although this movie did have more clothes in it than any movie I've ever worked on.''

He bought the bankrupt Regal Cinema chain at a time when American movie theaters were struggling. And he has won approval for a $1 billion plan to create a 27-acre entertainment district in downtown Los Angeles, a gamble even in the best economic times. Now Mr. Anschutz has gone further: his latest project is to turn London's blighted Millennium Dome into a sports and entertainment complex. The dome, which resembles an upside-down wok, is a national joke, mocked for its dearth of visitors and attacked for its expensive upkeep.

us,The Moviegoer,"Robert Warshow, a film critic for Commentary and Partisan Review, died young, at 37, in 1955. As sometimes happens, the abbreviation of the life contributed to the survival of the reputation. When this tall, slender, chain-smoking New York intellectual had his fatal heart attack, he had published exactly 11 essays on film, of which only half transcended the category of review. He was mourned with the depth of sorrow that often accompanies the unfulfillment of promise. ''I have never known a death so intensely and openly grieved over,'' Lionel Trilling wrote in a 1962 introduction to Warshow's work. ''No one was inclined, in the modern way, to 'accept' it.'' Nearly 50 years later, Warshow retains his presence. He is widely quoted, if not widely read, and ranked by other film critics among the masters of the genre. Last month, Harvard University Press reissued a posthumous compilation of his writing, ''The Immediate Experience: Movies, Comics, Theater & Other Aspects of Popular Culture.''

Chairman of United Aluminum Corporation, one of Connecticut's oldest private corporations, passed away on December 21, after a brief illness. A devoted New Havener, Yale Man and WWII Naval commander, he was 83. Mr. Lapides was born and raised in New Haven and graduated from Yale University, Class of '39S with an engineering degree and an Ensign's commission in the U.S. Naval Reserve. Shortly thereafter, he was called to active duty. At 25, he became one of the youngest ever commanding officers of a fleet destroyer (the U.S.S. Dahlgren DD187, in 1943, followed by command of the U.S.S. Niblack DD424, in 1945). The Niblack was part of the American armada preparing to invade Japan, and he was one of the first ashore to witness the destruction of Hiroshima. Upon release from active duty in 1946, Mr. Lapides returned to United Smelting & Aluminum Company, the New Haven firm founded by his grandfather in 1891. Remaining in the Naval Reserves, he became Commanding Officer of Surface Division 3-8 and later Surface Battalion 3-27. He also served as Mobilization Director for the State of Connecticut until recalled to active duty as a Commander when the Korean War began. He was then called to the Pentagon, where he served on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations on the Anti-Submarine Warfare Desk. After the war he returned to New Haven and rejoined his family's firm, where he was elected President in 1957. The Company became a leader in precision cold rolling of aluminum coil, serving markets worldwide. In 1968, Mr. Lapides relocated the Company to North Haven, CT, and in 1989 assumed the role of Chairman. It continues as United Aluminum Corporation, the second oldest aluminum roller in America. Mr. Lapides was active in community affairs. He served as the President of the Board of Trustees of the Hopkins School and Chairman of the North Haven Police Commission, and on the Boards of Yale New Haven Hospital, the St. Raphael's Foundation, First Bank of New Haven, the New Haven Savings Bank, Congregation Mishkan Israel and the New Haven Boy's Club. In 1996 Mr. Lapides was honored with a Hall of Fame Award from Junior Achievement; in 1998, both a Founders Award from Business New Haven and a Lifetime Achievement award from the Aluminum Association. Recently he was an Associate Fellow at Yale's Branford College and Treasurer of his Yale Class. Mr. Lapides is survived by his loving wife of 54 years, Ruth R. Lapides, and three children, John S. Lapides, of New Haven, James A. Lapides, of Brookline, MA, and Susan J. Lapides of Cambridge, MA, a sister, Joan L. Wingate, of Branford, CT, and four grandchildren.
