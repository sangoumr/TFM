The case, which pits health concerns against the need to protect 20,000 jobs in heavy industry, has tested the government of Prime Minister Mario Monti, which estimated that the economy would suffer losses of $10.4 billion a year if the plant closed. Mr. Monti, above, said the government needed to safeguard both public health and jobs as the plant carried out its cleanup. On Monday a court ordered the seizure of parts of the plant as a criminal investigation looked into claims of environmental damages caused by the plants emissions. Some studies have found that cancer rates around the steel plant, Europes largest, are significantly higher than elsewhere in Italy. Ilva had said that the investigation would force it to close the plant. An independent monitor will supervise Ilvas plan to improve its technology. ",2012-12-01T05:14:32+0000

(TCM) BABY PEGGY, THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM (2012) Peggy-Jean Montgomery, left, a daughter of a professional cowboy turned stuntman who moved his family to Hollywood, was 19 months old when she captured the attention of the director Fred Fishbach. Impressed by her plucky demeanor and good behavior, he cast her in some of Century Studios comedy shorts, sometimes opposite Brownie the Wonder Dog. As the third great child star of the silent era, after Baby Marie and Jackie Coogan, Peggy made about 150 shorts in all, working eight-hour days, six days a week, and performing stunts like being held underwater and escaping a burning building. In 1923 she earned the nickname Million-Dollar Baby when Universal lured her away from Century with the chance to make feature films for $1.5 million annually. But soon her father and the producer Sol Lesser argued about her salary, and Lesser not only fired her but also blackballed her in Hollywood. By the age of 11 Baby Peggy was a has-been. When she reached adulthood, she discovered that her family had spent her earnings  more than $2 million. Calling herself Diana Serra Cary, Peggy became an author and film historian as well as an advocate for laws protecting child actors. This tribute begins with Vera Iwerebors documentary, filmed shortly before the actresss 90th birthday in 2008. It is followed by Captain January (1924), a silent feature about a lighthouse keeper (Hobart Bosworth) who raises a child found washed ashore in a ships wreckage, at 9; and three of her few remaining shorts: Carmen, Jr. (1923), a spoof on Bizets Carmen and the tango, at 10:15; Such Is Life (1924), loosely based on Hans Christian Andersens Little Match Girl, at 10:30; and Peg o the Mounted (1924), about a pint-size Mountie who hunts down a gang of moonshiners, led by a giant of a man played by Jack Earle, who stood roughly 7 feet 7 inches.",2012-12-02T18:50:47+0000

At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, scientists said the mineralogical composition was similar to what was found by the earlier Spirit and Opportunity rovers elsewhere on Mars. An instrument, Sample Analysis at Mars, or Sam for short, looked at the gases that escaped as it heated the dirt to nearly 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The most common gases were water vapor and carbon dioxide. The Sam instrument also detected chlorinated methane  a small, simple compound that falls in the category of organics, which are the building blocks of life. But the scientists said it was too early to say that the soil itself contained organics. The carbon could be vestiges of molecules that the spacecraft brought from Earth, and the organics could have been generated by chemical reactions as the dirt was heated. Whether the carbon could point to anything biological, thats well down the road for us to get to, said John P. Grotzinger, the missions project scientist. ",2012-12-04T01:05:51+0000

But researchers, speaking at a news briefing in Pasadena, Calif., said there was no indication of a change in the magnetic field that would indicate that Voyager had entered interstellar space itself. Edward Stone, a Voyager project scientist, said this new region may be the last layer before interstellar space, but it could take the spacecraft another two or three years to cross it. Voyager 1 is traveling about 11 miles a second; a companion craft, Voyager 2, is not quite as far from the Sun and is traveling slower, less than 10 miles a second. ",2012-12-04T01:12:19+0000

(Sundance) THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY (2001) Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming, above, wrote, directed and starred in this drama about a Los Angeles couples sixth-anniversary party, and official reunion after a separation, which runs amok. She, Sally, is a 30-something movie star who may soon be washed up; he, Joe, is a British writer whose novel about their troubled marriage is about to be made into a film. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the $4-million-a-movie actress who is supposed to play a character based on Sally and brings along a batch of Ecstasy to the festivities. Kevin Kline, Phoebe Cates, Jane Adams, John C. Reilly, John Benjamin Hickey and Parker Posey fill out the cast. An articulate, acutely observant film like The Anniversary Party makes you realize how starved Hollywood movies are for great ensemble acting, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. In probing its characters souls, The Anniversary Party goes only so far. This isnt Chekhov, by any stretch of the imagination. The empathy the film extends to its characters may be evenly distributed, but it isnt all-embracing. Yet despite its shortcomings, this smart, caustic movie is easily the most incisive and realistic comedy of manners to emerge from Hollywood in quite a while, and thats saying a lot.

us,"Memo From Miami | Richard Prince, Soda Maker","Its not the first time Richard Prince has lent imagery to an outside brand  he collaborated with Louis Vuitton for its spring 2008 collection  but his latest partnership is decidedly more affordable. At Art Basel Miami this week, Prince, in conjunction with the soft-drink maker Arizona, will introduce his very own beverage: Richard Prince Lemon Fizz. The tall boy cans retail for 99 cents to $1.25 and feature photographs of him by Sante DOrazio and Sebastian Piras, as well as career highlights like a nurse painting, a cowboy photograph and the odd joke (all shown in gold frames). The graphics on the can reminded me of a baseball card, Prince said. I started looking at it as memorabilia. I thought I could do something with my own history where the final result would be pretty far away from art. For the uninitiated, its worth noting that Prince has used plastic six-pack holders as source material in various sculptural work since the 1990s. In terms of outside inspiration, he cites a variety of precedents, from the golf legend Arnold Palmer to the artists Hannah Wilke and Piero Manzoni, who once tinned his own excrement.

Williams, commissioner of the states education agency, said Thursday that he is appointing a board of managers to oversee the El Paso Independent School District, stripping the current seven-member board of trustees of their power in the aftermath of a cheating scandal. The new five-member board will oversee management of the 64,000-student district, which has been struggling to rebuild after administrators inflated test scores in struggling schools by pushing low-performing students out of the classroom and, in some cases, out of school altogether. The agency had previously sanctioned the district by lowering its accreditation status for reporting fraudulent data and allowing the misconduct to flourish. The replacement of the elected trustees must be approved by the federal Department of Justice. A state education official will oversee the districts operations until the board of managers is installed. ",2012-12-07T00:53:53+0000

(Cinemax) WANDERLUST (2012) Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, above, star as Linda and George, out-of-work Manhattanites unable to sell their microloft in the West Village. They stumble onto Elysium, an intentional community in rural Georgia, where good vibrations  and not a little smoke  fill the air, and the only blackberries grow on trees. Established decades earlier by Carvin (Alan Alda), now in a wheelchair and battling memory loss, and his hippie friends, the commune is home to a touchy-feely, guitar-strumming collage led by Seth (Justin Theroux), a creepy Lothario. The group includes another New York dropout (Malin Akerman) and a novelist and nudist (Joe Lo Truglio) who wears the occasional sanitary pouch (like a hairnet, but lower) when hes crushing grapes for homemade wine. Part of what gives this movie unexpected resonance is that Linda and George have joined only somewhat voluntarily, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this mostly funny comedy from David Wain. Linda and George dont burn with the yearning to travel that the title suggests, yet like other Americans seeking simplicity and maybe a chicken coop out back, they want off the road, at least for a while. Theres something touching about this desire, though Mr. Wain doesnt let Linda and George fly their freak flags for long. Instead, she said, the filmmakers prefer penis jokes and, with Mr. Lo Truglio and Mr. Rudds help, they provide plenty. Ms. Aniston and the other women (including Michaela Watkins as a desperate housewife) try to keep up, but Bridesmaids notwithstanding, the womens liberation movement in comedy has yet to arrive on the big screen.

(Showtime) WAR HORSE (2011) Steven Spielbergs sweeping adaptation of the popular stage spectacle follows Joey, a fleet-footed headstrong half-thoroughbred who has formed an unbreakable bond with a strapping lad, Albert (Jeremy Irvine, above), on his parents tenant farm in England. Across the English Channel, on the battlefields and in the trenches of Flanders and France, Joey and Albert endure parallel experiences, including harrowing escapes, the loss of friends, terror and deprivation. Peter Mullan and Emily Watson play Alberts parents, and David Thewlis is their landlord in this story written by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, based on the novel by Michael Morpurgo. Like most movies with an antiwar message, War Horse cannot help but be enthralled by the epic scale and transformative power of military conflict, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times.  The war has taken everything from everyone  the truth of this reckoning, uttered more than once by characters on screen, is self-evident, but it is complicated by the visceral charge and cathartic relief that an effective war movie gives to its audience. Still, The extreme violence of the slaughter in World War I is implied rather than graphically depicted, he added. Mr. Spielberg steps back from the bloody, chaotic naturalism of Saving Private Ryan  this is an animal fable for children, after all, with echoes of E. T. and Carroll Ballards Black Stallion  but his ability to infuse action sequences with emotional gravity has hardly diminished. ",2012-12-08T06:00:08+0000

The ruling, which was announced Monday, ordered the government to investigate the massacre in the region of El Mozote 31 years ago and to prosecute and punish those hold responsible.

But instead of sticking only to cheeses made nearby, as tradition dictates, he brings them in from elsewhere, often the high Dolomites. They may be coated with olive oil and ashes or wrapped in walnut leaves. Or he might enclose them in hay, chestnut leaves or even crushed blackberries or beeswax. Each of his cheeses has a different aroma, flavor and texture but offers a balance of richness and acidity. A new one, a majestic cylinder wrapped in hay, leaves and mushrooms and called Merlino, was an experiment that has made him very happy. ",2012-12-11T21:18:18+0000

By specifically excluding Anglicans, the government of Prime Minister David Cameron appeared to have taken a major step back from a change that gay and lesbian groups have hailed as a watershed. Maria Miller, the culture minister, said the aim was to guarantee the Anglican churches that they could not be forced to hold same-sex marriages if litigants went to British and European courts demanding the rights that members of other faiths would enjoy. That possibility helped opponents of the change muster support from a substantial bloc of Conservative lawmakers. ",2012-12-12T05:09:29+0000

us,Simplifying the Fiscal Cliff Debate,"There are a lot of potential moving parts in the fiscal cliff negotiations, and thus a lot of potential ways that matters could be negotiated and settled, postponed or left half-resolved. But sometimes simplification helps, and the best place to start when thinking about how things are likely to play out is with the following brute fact: No matter what Congressional Republicans offer the president and what theyre willing to concede, taxes on the wealthiest Americans are going to rise by at least $800 billion over the next decade. This is not a possibility, not a likely scenario, not a maybe or a might be; its just reality, conceded even by the notorious RINO Jim DeMint. Which means that its useful for analytic purposes to treat that $800 billion as a baseline, rather than as a live point of give and take in the negotiations, and recognize that any bigger deal John Boehner and Barack Obama are able to cut should be judged as much on how it balances spending cuts and tax increases beyond that baseline as on what it looks like overall.",2012-12-13T20:04:07+0000

The Treasury Department said the sanctions were intended to deter the procurement operations of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, which is led by Dr. Abbasi; the Iran Centrifuge Technology Company; and Irans uranium enrichment program. Companies and people on the blacklist cannot do business with any American businesses or citizens, and any assets they may have in the United States will be frozen. The new sanctions, which came as a team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency was visiting Iran, were likely to anger Iranian officials, who have repeatedly rejected Western and Israeli accusations that their nuclear program is a cover to develop the ability to make atomic weapons.

(Sundance) RESTLESS In the conclusion of this two-part drama written by William Boyd, Ruth Gilmartin (Michelle Dockery), a Cambridge graduate student in 1970s England, continues to uncover the past of her mother, Sally (Charlotte Rampling, above), who she has recently discovered is actually Eva Delectorskaya (Hayley Atwell plays the young Eva), a Russian exile who worked as a British spy during World War II. Now the former spy thinks someone is out to kill her, which is why shes buying a rifle and ammunition strong enough to take down a charging elephant. We all have secrets, she admonishes her disbelieving daughter. No one even knows half the truth about someone else. Rufus Sewell and Michael Gambon share the role of Lucas Romer, a spymaster and Sallys former lover, who may be the only one who can save her. Devout fans of the British espionage thriller or the British cozy mystery may find themselves perfectly happy with Restless, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Boyds understated script is free of hackneyed dialogue or florid emotion (no surprise), and there are niceties of language  strategically repeated phrases, Ruths wavering forms of address to her mother  that you dont expect in a mini-series. And Ms. Dockery and Ms. Rampling, in their relatively short screen time together, have an astringent rapport that brings to life the complicated relationship of Ruth and Eva, as well as Mr. Boyds themes of the forging and cracking of identity under pressure, in a way that goes beyond words on a page.",2012-12-14T06:00:08+0000

The bulk of Marbles documents her wobbly progress toward stability, with interpolated drawings from her journals and occasional side trips into the history of crazy artists.

Captor and captive developed a rapport, and ultimately, Bizot became the only Westerner to be released from Khmer Rouge captivity. Duch, meanwhile, went on to oversee the torture and murder of thousands of Cambodians at the notorious Tuol Sleng prison and in 2010 was the first person convicted by Cambodias war crimes tribunal. Bizot returned to Cambodia to testify at the trial. Facing the Torturer is his attempt to come to terms with this part of his ordeal (a previous account, The Gate, published in the United States in 2003, chronicled his earlier experiences in Cambodia).",2012-12-14T16:15:57+0000

Fox decided on Saturday that it would replace the planned episodes of two animated series, Family Guy and American Dad, that were to be broadcast Sunday night. The network made no official statement, but one executive confirmed that the decision was made because the content of the episodes could have been seen by some viewers as insensitive in light of these recent events. In both cases the networks scheduled repeats to fill those hours.

This action film, which stars Tom Cruise and contains a scene in which a sniper attack leaves several people dead, was originally set to be unveiled on Dec. 15 in Pittsburgh, where a large portion of the movie was filmed. The premiere was postponed out of honor and respect for the families of the victims whose lives were senselessly taken, according to a statement from the studio; the event has not been rescheduled.

The amount spent on the disease by all countries rose to $1.8 billion last year, compared with $100 million in 2000, and, as a result, about one million childrens lives were probably spared over that time, the report said. But it would take $5 billion a year to get nets, insecticide spraying, diagnostic kits, effective drugs and hospital treatment to everyone needing them, and donor contributions, especially to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, have been nearly flat since 2010. Last year, the number of new nets purchased fell sharply, to 66 million from 145 million two years ago. Since nets wear out in three years and children are always being born, large numbers of infants and toddlers will soon be unprotected if more money does not come in, the report warned. The W.H.O. estimated that there were 219 million malaria cases in the world in 2010, with 660,00 deaths. ",2012-12-18T01:48:00+0000

From a literary point of view, everything depends on the sensibility of the narrator, her comportment both as the teller and as the main character in her own tale. The readers resistance to these stories can be strong. Severe illness, by its nature, narrows the focus; the palette of experience both intensifies and shrinks; we crawl into the bush, figuratively speaking, and wait out our fate, fighting to survive. There is little suspense: the existence of the memoir is testament to the fact that the author has lived to tell the tale. But what hard-won nugget of wisdom has she brought back from her brief descent into a hell that most of us, for now, have been lucky enough to avoid?

The publication reported this week that it had obtained documents that said one or more witnesses had told officials that Mr. Wang had examined a container of cyanide with Gu Kailai, the wife of Bo Xilai, the former party chief of Chongqing, on Nov. 12, 2011. Ms. Gu had thought up a plot to kill Mr. Heywood by poisoning him, and Mr. Wang encouraged her on Nov. 13 to meet Mr. Heywood for dinner and then poison him, the report said. During this years trial of Ms. Gu, witnesses said she tried to think of ways to kill Mr. Heywood with Mr. Wang, but the statements did not indicate Mr. Wang had played a direct role in the poisoning plot, according to one lawyer at the trial. Ms. Gu was convicted of Mr. Heywoods murder and was given a commuted death sentence; she could be imprisoned for life.

He said the problem with Georgia prisons was the quality of the inmates. The problem with the Republican Party is the quality of the people who vote in their primaries and caucuses. Everybody says they need a better candidate, or they need a better message but  in my opinion  the Republicans have an inmate problem. The political obsessions of the Republican base  from denying global warming to defending assault weapons to opposing any tax increases under any conditions, to resisting any immigration reform  are making it impossible to be a Republican moderate, said Carville.

As we are gathered here today, let us consider one of the most oddly faithful of all fiction writers, Fyodor Dostoevsky. More specifically, Id like focus pretty intensely on what some consider to be the key moment in his greatest novel  arguably one of the greatest of all time  The Brothers Karamazov. (Elie himself notes the 1880 masterpiece as an example of the truly faith-engaged fiction of yore.) I speak in particular of the Grand Inquisitor scene, a sort of fiction within a fiction that draws on something powerful from the New Testament  Jesuss refusal of Satans three temptations  and in doing so digs at the meaning of faith, freedom, happiness and the diabolic satisfaction of our desires.

us,A Kesha Reversal On Die Young Lyrics,"The Newtown, Conn., school shootings have had reverberations in the radio world, as lyrics that seemed within the bounds of good taste two weeks ago are suddenly hitting a flat note. A case in point is Keshas recent hit Die Young, a lightweight party tune about living for the moment. Though the theme of the song is carpe diem, it contains the chorus: Lets make the most of the night like were gonna die young/Were gonna die young/Were gonna die young. Program directors at pop stations in Connecticut and around the country took the song out of their rotations in the days after the Dec. 14 shootings. Another song receiving very few spins these days is Pumped Up Kicks, last years Foster the People hit, which tells the story of a student shooting his classmates. The airplay for Keshas song dropped 19 percent on the Billboard Radio Songs chart this week, and the song has dipped to No. 4 from No. 3 on the Hot 100 single chart. Several program directors said the drop-off in airplay would be temporary, Billboard reported. In a string of Twitter posts last week, Kesha, below, apologized and asserted that she had objected to the lyrics but was forced to sing them. I did NOT want to sing those lyrics and I was FORCED TO, she wrote, in a post that was later taken down. She later posted a message on her Web site trying to clarify: After such a tragic event I was feeling a lot of emotion and sadness when I said I was forced to sing some of the lyrics to Die Young. Forced is not the right word. I did have some concerns about the phrase die young in the chorus when we were writing the lyrics especially because so many of my fans are young and thats one reason why I wrote so many versions of this song. But the point of the song is the importance of living every day to the fullest and staying young at heart, and these are things I truly believe. Kesha is one of several songwriters on Die Young. The list includes Lukasz Gottwald (known as Dr. Luke), Benny Blanco, Cirkut and the group Fun.s frontman, Nate Ruess.",2012-12-23T22:23:31+0000

For a 2011 show at Gavin Browns Enterprise, Fischer made 300 tabletops, only two-thirds of which were ever displayed in New York. Twenty-one from the remaining lot will go on view in St. Barts, along with an assortment of found objects (chairs, vases, lamps), a new sculpture cast from Fischers forearms and several hand-painted figurines. The pop culture references here run the gamut from Tom Hanks in Da Vinci Code mode to E.P.A. warning signs to Big Bird, who rather solemnly graces the announcement card. But before reading political subtext into the Sesame Street characters appearance, its worth remembering that Fischer titled a 2010 exhibition Oscar the Grouch and that he has a 3-year-old daughter, Lotti, with the artist Cassandra MacLeod.

us,Gaza: Rights Group Accuses Militants of Unlawful Rocket Attacks on Israel," Human Rights Watch said Monday that armed Palestinian groups in Gaza had violated the laws of war by firing hundreds of rockets toward population centers in Israel during eight days of fighting in November. Three Israeli civilians, a soldier and a civilian contractor at a military base were killed by the rocket fire. The group said that two Palestinians were killed, apparently by rockets that fell short, and that the militants endangered Gaza civilians by firing from densely populated areas. More than 150 Palestinians were killed by Israel airstrikes and shelling. A spokesman for Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, rejected the report as biased, telling Reuters that the Palestinians were defending themselves. Human Rights Watch, a nongovernmental group based in New York, has criticized Israel for what it called unlawful attacks on a house that killed 12 people, and on Palestinian journalists during the conflict. Israel has insisted that it fired on legitimate targets. ",2012-12-25T02:24:27+0000

Miller has twice tried to revive the Japanese-inspired goods: once in 1994, when it reintroduced its home collection (they failed to sell), and again in 2005 (the chests were made in Asia, and the poor quality of the craftsmanship ultimately doomed the project). Bringing the chests back is one of my favorite examples of doing the right thing, said Ben Watson, creative director of Herman Miller, who is resurrecting a number of forgotten items from the companys archives. This time around, the chests are made in the United States and have the same hand-fitted drawers as the originals. They are available in a wide range of solid woods with white or black metal pulls. The six-drawer chest is $2,809, the nine-drawer chest, $3,192; the optional base, $418. Information: hermanmiller.com/collection or (616) 654-3000.",2012-12-26T23:28:05+0000

My grandma could make a doll or toy out of anything. There are plenty of dolls in this 1,200-square-foot space in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. All began as Ms. Housleys hand drawings, which she scans, then redraws stitch by stitch in a computer file. The files are sent to India to be machine embroidered, but thanks to Ms. Housleys method, the finished goods are quirky, with perfectly imperfect stitching that makes each piece look hand-made. Prices range from $10 for a felt charm to $230 for a floor cushion. 109 South Fifth Street (Bedford Avenue), Room 401, Brooklyn; coralandtusk.com or (718) 388-4188.",2012-12-26T23:31:30+0000

us,Suburban Sprawl,"Theres a touching paradox in the first chapter of Jami Attenbergs caustic, entertaining and bighearted new novel, The Middlesteins. Edie, 5 years old and 62 pounds, is already too solid, in her mothers estimation, too big for her age. But how can her mother not feed her, when she and her husband feel that food is made of love, and love . . . made of food? How can these parents deny Edie life-giving nourishment when Edies father, a Jewish immigrant from Ukraine, nearly starved on his journey to Chicago and has never been able to get enough to eat since? Even though its clear that young Edie suffers under her own weight  she huffs and puffs up the stairs like someones gassy old uncle after a meal  her mother cant refuse her the liverwurst and rye bread she loves. This is a Jewish mother after all, and those of us whove had one know that the message, when it comes to food, is always have a little more. Its an attitude that comes not just from love, but also from fear; a history fraught with disaster and hunger gives rise to the feeling that one must always be prepared. Therefore, bubbeleh, have another matzo ball.",2012-12-27T21:32:32+0000

Then again, politically radical fiction is often a tough sell in our market. While Saramago was an outspoken member of his countrys Communist Party (Marx was never so right as now, he remarked at the outset of the recent global financial crisis), in his best-known work his politics are embedded in allegory or fantasy, allowing readers to view them as loosely humanist or to overlook them entirely. Not so with Raised From the Ground. Still, whats apt to strike readers of this book is not so much that its radical but that its topical. What kind of world, it asks, divides into those who make a profession of idleness and those who want work but cant get it?

(Showtime) STARDUST (2007) Charlie Cox is Tristan, a young man desperate to prove that he would do anything to win the love of his lady fair (Sienna Miller), which includes bringing her a falling star that recently crashed near their village. But to reach the star he must travel to the magical realm of Stormhold, where the star takes the form of a human (Claire Danes, above with Mr. Cox).
