The Buddy System","To those who understand the sublime subtlety of the blues, the guitarist Buddy Guy has done as much with 12 bars as any bluesman alive or dead. Renowned for his musical unpredictability and cluster bombs of notes played at numbing decibels, Mr. Guy was considered too wild and overamplified for the owners of Chicago's Chess Records. Consequently, he was either used as a sideman for blues elders like Muddy Waters or toned down for his solo recordings. Until the album ""Stone Crazy"" was released in 1981, Mr. Guy was considered a great live act -- he played the guitar with his teeth and behind his back years before Jimi Hendrix -- who couldn't be captured on record. Today, however, all that has changed. Mr. Guy is a Grammy Award winner, and his album ""Damn Right I've Got the Blues"" is considered a blues milestone. The book of the same name, DAMN RIGHT I'VE GOT THE BLUES: Buddy Guy and the Blues Roots of Rock-and-Roll (Woodford Press, 660 Market Street, Suite 206, San Francisco, Calif. 94104, paper, $14.95), an oral biography written by the music journalist Donald E. Wilcock with the guitarist's cooperation, is a frank assessment of the life, many disappointments and rare hurrahs of Buddy Guy. Suffering from lingering insecurities about his own abilities, Mr. Guy even today insists there are dozens of musicians who can play better than he does. At the end of this slim volume he tells of buying his son a guitar so that he could learn to play like Prince. Mr. Guy recommended that the young man also listen to Jimi Hendrix. After watching a film clip of Hendrix, the son called his father and said: ""He said he learned from you. I didn't know you could play like that."" Buddy Guy replied, ""You never asked.""

us,You Rang?,"ERNEST WINSTON AGE: 24.YEARS IN SERVICE: Two. CURRENT POSITION: Unemployed. HOW I GOT STARTED: When I got out of high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do. Then my mother told me about Ivor Spencer, of the Ivor Spencer International Butler School. He's British and comes to the United States once a year. That year, the course was being given in Washington. It was a monthlong course that cost $6,000. I stayed at the Y.M.C.A. for $25 a night; I had to pay for parking, food. HOW I GOT THE MONEY: I was working as a security guard in a hospital, making a lot of overtime. I had a Porsche. I drove over to Brooklyn, left the car there, went to a club, and when I came back the Porsche was stripped to the bone. My insurance company said the value of the car was $16,000; $10,000 went to the bank and I had $6,000 for the butler school. WHAT I LEARNED:How to lay tables; how to steam all the wrinkles out of the tablecloth; how to pack for a trip; never to wear cologne or jewelry; to be friendly but never familiar. He taught us how the butler can be the star of a dinner party without showing up the host. MY FIRST JOB: I met two executives who were hiring at the Renaissance Hotel, so I lucked out and got a spot making 30 grand. Butlers were something hotels were starting to use in New York. I was there for about a year. I hated it, so I went to the St. Regis, and it was a walk in the park.PROBLEM WITH HOTELS: You're forced to put on airs -- constantly. Now, I'm looking for a job in a household. PEOPLE I'VE SENT MY RESUME TO: Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby, Stevie Wonder, Dick Scott -- he's the manager of New Kids on the Block. I would rather work for a black person because the understanding is there, unless they're superficial and really don't know who they are. HOW IT FEELS TO BE AT SOMEONE'S BECK AND CALL: If the money's good, I don't have a problem with it. (Nancy Siesel/The New York Times)",1994-01-02T05:00:00+0000

I went to a catering college and was selected a few times to go up there and help at large banquets. When I was offered a full-time job as a footman, I thought it would be for a short period of time. I was there a couple of years, and I never seemed to get out of this kind of work. MY ROOM AT THE PALACE: A small, comfortable room on the top floor, with a window that overlooked the courtyard. HOW I REFERRED TO MY EMPLOYERS: The Queen was Your Majesty; a duke and duchess were Your Grace; almost any other titles were My Lord and Lady. WHAT IT'S LIKE WORKING FOR AMERICANS: Usually they want a butler, particularly one who's English, for show. AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD: After working in a house with beautiful furnishings and clothes that are out of this world, you don't want $20 trousers; you want cashmere jackets. HOMES I'D LIKE TO HAVE BUTLERED IN: Versailles; the White House; the Breakers -- the Vanderbilts' home in Newport; Blenheim Palace -- when you think of British aristocracy, this is the place that comes to mind. PEOPLE I'D LIKE TO HAVE BUTLERED FOR: Queen Victoria -- she was the end of an era; William Randolph Hearst -- he was a great eccentric and lived life to the fullest; Elizabeth Taylor; Maria Callas. LOST ARTS OF BUTLERING: When they polished shoes, they took the laces out and ironed them; newspapers would be ironed; toothpaste was put on the brush; a towel was folded in a special way, so as the gentleman gets out of the bath, he sits in a chair and wraps himself in the towel. TIME IT TAKES TO LAY A TABLE: For 20 to 30 people, a couple of hours. When I worked for one lady -- she's a legend in New York -- I did all the flower arranging, and for one dinner I spent 16 hours on the flowers.

Anke Huber beat Mary Joe Fernandez, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4), in women's singles before Lendl lost.

In desperation, Lendl tried to serve-and-volley, but even that tactic failed. (AP) N.H.L.

Calvin may be an example Howard Gardener refers to as Multiple Intelligences (Gardner, 1993). though Gardener refuses to admit it. Here Calvin clearly exhibits strengths in linguistic, scientific and outerspatial intelligence.** 3. You can see from Calvin's obvious level of emotional and intellectual commitment to comic books that reading them puts him in a state of what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines as flow: ""When challeges are high and personal skills are used to the utmost, we experience that rare state of consciousness . . . . We feel involved, concentrated, absorbed."" (Csikszentmihalyi, 1993).*** 4. Miss Wormwood is a devoted disciplinary disciple of either William or Jesse James. **** Her oppoents argue displeased with Calvin's ahistoricity. However, Calvin could counter that many famous and successful people had little regard for history, viz. Henry Ford, ""History is more or less bunk"", and cf.

Ape and Essence","In his ""Survivors: A New Vision of Endangered Wildlife,"" the photographer James Balog banished the illusory prettiness of nature photography to expose the viewer directly to endangered species, to creatures temporarily freed from the diminished elements of natural habitat within which zoos or parks had imprisoned and, thus, romanticized them. Among studio lights, scrims and screens, his subjects were revealed in their incomparable, irreplaceable beauty. His new volume, ANIMA (Arts Alternative Press, 3200 Valmont Avenue, Suite 7, Boulder, Colo. 80301; $29.95), continues to disrupt the cavalier perception of nature by focusing on Homo sapiens. In 28 dramatic photographs, Mr. Balog portrays his figures as if they were fossils obscured by the darkness of history. His photographs are of individuals -- human and chimpanzee -- encountering one another with no context but light and space. His photographs capture the radiance of pure expression in Isabella Rossellini's face and in the chimp who cradles it. The accompanying text, similarly denuded of metaphor, is itself what the photographer calls a ""psychological labyrinth,"" an accretion of typography and meditation on our animal nature and our unnatural dissociation from it. The resulting elegantly designed book is an unsettling record of an artist exposing us, with neither shame nor embarrassment, for the animals we are.MICHAEL J. ROSEN",1994-01-09T05:00:00+0000

Its comparatively recent, 17th-century origins deny this metropolitan city the ruins and tombs of New Delhi, or New Delhi's sense of having been privy to decisive moments in India's past. It lacks the fast-paced cosmopolitanism of Bombay, nor can it parallel Calcutta's down-at-the-heels charm, its bequest of colonial-era stateliness, and its intellectual and political vitality. Tamil Nadu's capital offers no quota of palaces, not much by way of decaying princely pomp. On the face of it, Madras appears to be just another large, bustling Indian city, densely populated and beset with challenges. Yet a thoughtful visitor can push beneath the surface reality to discover fascinating and unsuspected facets of city life.

""Mr. MacArthur writes in fury at what he sees, correctly, as the press's failure to respond effectively,"" Michael Janeway said here in 1992. RIPLEY UNDER WATER By Patricia Highsmith. Black Lizard/Vintage Crime, $10. Tom Ripley is an intelligent, cultured gentleman who dabbles in art, music and, occasionally, murder. A popular though unlikely hero, he has appeared in several of Patricia Highsmith's books without ever getting caught. But in this one, Ripley's new neighbors seem to know a great deal about the skeletons in his closet, needling him not for extortion but for pleasure. In 1992 our reviewer, Julian Symons, said of Ms. Highsmith, ""One closes most of her books -- and her equally powerful and chilling short stories -- with a feeling that the world is more dangerous than one had imagined."" For readers unacquainted with Ripley, this publisher has also reissued THE BOY WHO FOLLOWED RIPLEY ($10), a 1980 novel in which he becomes the protector of a runaway teen-ager, and RIPLEY'S GAME ($10), published in 1974, in which he manipulates someone into committing murder. ORIGINS RECONSIDERED: In Search of What Makes Us Human By Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin. Anchor/Doubleday, $14.95. Did the human species evolve simultaneously in Africa, Asia and Europe? Did morality originate with the emergence of human beings or can it be traced farther back? These are among the questions discussed by Richard Leakey, the paleoanthropologist. ""It is not often that a major participant in so contentious a field delivers such a vivid, generally evenhanded summation,"" John Noble Wilford said here in 1992. I, TITUBA, BLACK WITCH OF SALEM By Maryse Conde. Translated by Richard Philcox. One World/Ballantine, $10. The author, a native of Guadeloupe, has created a rich novel from the history of another West Indian woman, the real Tituba, who played a central role in the Salem witch trials. In 1992 our reviewer, Howard Frank Mosher, praised Ms. Conde's ""gift for storytelling and her unswerving focus on her characters."" Ballantine has also reissued JUMPING SHIP: And Other Stories, by Kelvin Christopher James ($10). Born in Trinidad, Mr. James focuses on the intersection of American and Caribbean cultures in the present day. He evokes ""a particular world by virtue of his energy and generosity of spirit,"" Tom Piazza said here in 1992. DAYS OF OBLIGATION: An Argument With My Mexican Father By Richard Rodriguez. Penguin, $11. The author, who grew up in the United States, discovers that Mexico, the land of his parents, holds more meaning for him than he would ever have believed. Other assumptions about being Roman Catholic and gay are also examined in these autobiographical essays. In 1992 our reviewer, David L. Kirp, said, ""The self remains Mr. Rodriguez's best and truest subject."" BLACK DOGS By Ian McEwan. Bantam, $7.95. In this novel-cum-parable, the disintegration of a marriage is related by the couple's son-in-law, Jeremy. In writing his memoir, he keeps returning to a mystical encounter between June (his mother-in-law) and a pair of fierce black dogs. In 1992 our reviewer, Bette Pesetsky, praised ""the richly designed weaving of a truly sinister and very real postwar Europe into these lives."" ANATOMY OF LOVE: The Mysteries of Mating, Marriage, and Why We Stray By Helen Fisher. Fawcett Columbine, $12.50. The complexities of courtship are reduced to biological imperatives in this social and sexual analysis. For instance, couples are most likely to divorce after four years because they've had enough time to raise a child past infancy and can then feel free to vary the gene pool. Mary Batten, the author of SEXUAL STRATEGIES: How Females Choose Their Mates (Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, $12.95), also sees parenting responsibilities as central. Women are more selective about mating, she explains, because they will largely deal with the consequences. Both books ""are fun and sometimes even delightful to read,"" Natalie Angier said here in 1992. DUNSTER By John Mortimer. Penguin, $10.95. A British accountant in the midst of a boring middle age has one element in his life that is all too interesting: the constant reappearances of an obnoxious schoolmate, Dick Dunster, who remains his nemesis. Last year our reviewer, Jane Smiley, called the novel ""a delicious read, like a meal you expect to enjoy, and do."" MATISSE, PICASSO, MIRO AS I KNEW THEM By Rosamond Bernier. Knopf, $35. The author, who co-founded the French art magazine L'Oeil, drew upon her many years in Paris for the reminiscences and interviews that fueled her popular lectures, transmuted here into essays. ""They already have a period charm, evoking a smaller, simpler and probably more agreeable art world,"" Michael Peppiatt said here in 1991. Painting on the other side of the Atlantic is the subject of AMERICAN VIEWS: Essays on American Art, by John Wilmerding (Princeton University, $35), in which the author discusses the work of artists like Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, Fitz Hugh Lane and William Bradford.

Flaim, 26, who started training for short-track racing a year ago, set an American record in the 1,000-meter time trials on Saturday with a time of 1 minute 30.78 seconds in Lake Placid, N.Y. Andy Gabel, Randy Bartz and John Coyle and 16-year-old Tony Goskowicz also clinched spots on the team. Cathy Turner, the 31-year-old gold and silver medalist in the 1992 Albertville Games, won the top spot on the women's team after setting American records in the 500-meter race (46.53) and the 1,000-meter time trial (1:38.18). Also making the team was Amy Peterson, a silver medalist in the 1992 Games. (AP) LONG-TRACK SPEED SKATING Two Records Are Set Rintje Ritsma of the Netherlands and Gunda Niemann of Germany broke world point records as they won overall victories yesterday at the European speed skating championships in Hamar, Norway. Ritsma totaled 156.201 points after winning three events -- the 500, 1,500 and the 5,000 meters -- in the men's four-race series at the Viking Ship Olympic Hall, site of the speed skating events in next month's Winter Games. Johan Olav Koss of Norway prevented Ritsma from making a sweep by winning yesterday's final 10,000-meter race in 13:51.39. Koss was second in the final overall standing with 157.257 points. Third was Falko Zandstra, the two-time defending champion from the Netherlands, with 157.686 points. Niemann, the Olympic champion in the 3,000 and 5,000, won the final 5,000-meter race in 7:14.35 for her second victory in two days and had 167.282 points after the four events.

Jagge gave Norway its first World Cup triumph of the season with two flawless runs down the slushy Podkoren course. Alberto Tomba of Italy, who fell during Saturday's giant slalom, was in contention until late in the second run yesterday, but he straddled a gate with his left ski and was disqualified. Jagge, who didn't post the fastest time in either run, finished in 1 minute 43.46 seconds. Ole Christian Furuseth was second at 1:43.51. (AP) Schneider Takes Slalom: Vreni Schneider won the slalom in Altenmarkt, Austria, giving the Swiss skier her 47th World Cup victory. With her Austrian rivals suffering their worst day in nine years, Schneider cruised to her third slalom victory of the season. Schneider posted the fastest times in both runs down the Unterbergalmhang course, compiling a total time of 1 minute 36.41 seconds. She finished .57 seconds ahead of Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden.

Then Westinghouse's new chairman, Michael Jordan, said that as part of a sweeping set of changes -- what one analyst called ""cleaning all the cobwebs out"" -- he would lay off 3,400. And GTE, the largest local phone company, said it would cut 17,000 jobs -- more than 14 percent of its worldwide total. But in the midst of this all-too-familiar chorus, there appeared a welcome voice -- one big company would be adding, not subtracting.

us,News Is a Harsh Mistress,"Mort Rosenblum, a veteran Associated Press correspondent based in Paris, poses a vaguely sinister question for the title of this anecdotal and often entertaining guidebook to foreign news and reporting. But the real questions underlying WHO STOLE THE NEWS? Why We Can't Keep Up With What Happens in the World and What We Can Do About It (Wiley, $24.95) are a bit more mundane: what is news, and why doesn't anyone seem to care much about anything beyond the immediately domestic? Americans are infamous around the world for being uninterested in things foreign -- a foolish attitude on a planet whose nations are more and more interlinked, Mr. Rosenblum argues. Television and the profit motive are the primary culprits keeping the population mired in ignorance, he contends. News organizations forgo foreign news because there is scant consumer interest. No surprises there. Yet given the low priority assigned most foreign events by news media executives, it is still possible for citizens to obtain the information necessary to make informed judgments. Readers must simply hunt it down in newspapers, magazines and journals. Much, of course, depends on the quality of reporting itself, and here is where Mr. Rosenblum is most interesting. He laces his argument with numerous examples of the trials, woes and infelicities endemic to reporting abroad. His devastating portrait of American military censorship during the Persian Gulf war and of the timidity and smugness of the press during that conflict is particularly noteworthy. The fact is that no one stole the news. The news is there; it just has to be claimed, a point Mr. Rosenblum makes rather well. STEPHAN SALISBURY",1994-01-16T05:00:00+0000

us,The Art of Protest,"When the 1960's ended, so did the large output of cautionary and protest graphics that littered the streets. This was particularly true in the United States, where the antiwar, free speech and civil rights movements had inspired artists and graphic designers to create reams of visual agitation -- some of which became icons of the era. Memorable graphics were noticeably absent during the 1970's. Yet by the 80's, concurrent with Ronald Reagan's Administration, social and political activism was again on the rise throughout the world, and so were political graphics. Liz McQuiston, a graphic design critic and historian in London, surveys the wide range of graphic arts produced internationally during the past three decades in GRAPHIC AGITATION: Social and Political Graphics Since the Sixties (Phaidon/Chronicle, $49.95). The book is the first comprehensive overview of these posters, billboards, flyers, periodicals, buttons and T-shirts. Ms. McQuiston writes that during the 70's the environment and human rights were significant issues, and not until the 80's did social movements and individuals refocus their attention on community issues and redirect their efforts toward producing visual propaganda. Sexual orientation and AIDS became focal points for artists, many of whom belonged to poster brigades and graphics collectives and engaged in guerrilla activities that included billboard defacement and illegal bill posting. Ms. McQuiston offers an extensive collection of both familiar and rare materials gathered from scores of grass-roots and urban advocacy groups. The effectiveness of recent productless, issue-oriented advertisements for mainstream businesses (such as those for Benetton) is also scrutinized. This ambitious chronicle is a must for the scholars, students and practitioners of alternative media. STEVEN HELLER",1994-01-16T05:00:00+0000

Without hesitation, Mr. Clinton replied, ""The short answer is yes."" Well, maybe. Mr. Assad's record suggests that it is wise to be skeptical about his intentions. As in the bad old days when he was a Soviet client, he still engages in aggressive activities, aimed mostly at Israel, Turkey, Lebanon and the United States. They include the following: * Building up Syrian unconventional military capabilities. Damascus now has thousands of chemical warheads, appears to be on the verge of putting anthrax agents into weapons and is starting nuclear research. Its Scud-C missiles from North Korea can reach most of Israel's population. * Getting more involved in the drug trade. Top officials participate in trafficking drugs to the West, according to a 1992 Congressional report. * Sponsoring Lebanese and Palestinian groups that attack Israelis as well as Palestinians who favor Yasir Arafat, and sponsoring the PKK, a Kurdish Marxist group, in its assaults on Turkey.",1994-01-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"THE IRAN-CONTRA REPORT: Chronology; After 13 Years of Hide-and-Seek, a Bitter Chapter of U.S. History Ends","1981 AUG. 4 Oliver L. North, a Marine major, is assigned to the National Security Council at the White House. DECEMBER President Ronald Reagan signs an executive order that authorizes a covert operation by the C.I.A. to support the contras, rebels who are fighting the leftist Government of Nicaragua. The Administration hopes its secret backing will bolster the contras' appearance as an indigenous independent force. 1982 DECEMBER With accounts of U.S. backing leaking out, Congress enacts the Boland Amendment, which bars the use of Federal money to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government. 1984 SPRING Major North is assigned as White House contact with the contras. 1985 FEBRUARY Through dummy corporations abroad, Colonel North and two associates -- Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general, and Albert A. Hakim, an Iranian-American arms dealer -- make the first of six purchases of weapons destined for the contras. The money comes from private contributions, all secret. By keeping the source of the money private, the White House is able to squeeze through a loophole in the Boland Amendment and maintain that this arms supply is legal. SUMMER News accounts link Colonel North to a private network supplying military aid to the contras. The reports prompt questions from Congress, and Mr. North helps Robert C. McFarlane, the President's national security adviser, prepare a denial. JULY Israeli Government officials, who long viewed Iran as a counterweight to Iraq and other Arab enemies of Israel, tell Mr. McFarlane that the Iranians want to open a ""political discourse"" with Washington. Although the United States publicly views the Teheran Government as terrorist and has outlawed arms sales to it, this overture soon leads to the first shipment of American weapons to Iran, without legal authorization. The shipment, in turn, brought the release of one of seven Americans held hostage in Lebanon by Islamic militants. NOV. 19 Colonel North is appointed by Mr. McFarlane to handle logistics for a second arms shipment, of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles, to Iran. 1986 APRIL 4 In a memo to John M. Poindexter, who has succeeded Mr. McFarlane as national security adviser, Colonel North proposes diverting to the contras $12 million of the proceeds from the sale to Iran. The memo, Colonel North will later testify, was intended for President Reagan. MAY 25 Mr. McFarlane, who has formally left the Government but remains a consultant to the White House, flies secretly to Teheran with Colonel North and other officials, carrying spare parts for missiles. AUG. 6 Meeting with 11 members of the House Intelligence Committee, Colonel North denies raising money for the contras or offering them military advice. As he later testified, this was a lie. OCT. 5 Carrying arms to the contras, a cargo plane is shot down over Nicaragua. Three crewmen are killed, and a fourth, Eugene Hasenfus, is captured by the Nicaraguan Army. NOV. 22 Justice Department investigators discover in Colonel North's office his April memo proposing the diversion of arms-sale money to the contras. NOV. 23 Colonel North meets privately with Mr. McFarlane and tells him that the diversion was approved by White House superiors. The colonel also meets with Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and informs him. NOV. 24 Mr. Meese tells the President of the diversion. NOV. 25 Mr. Meese discloses the Iran-contra connection. Mr. Reagan announces Mr. Poindexter's resignation and Colonel North's dismissal. 1987 JAN. 6-7 Special committees of the Senate and the House are created. FEB. 26A Presidential commission led by former Senator John G. Tower blames the President's top advisers for a chaotic environment that, the commission says, led to the Iran-contra affair. The panel says the President was largely out of touch with the operations of the N.S.C. JULY 7 Appearing before the Congressional committees, Colonel North begins six days of frequently fervent testimony. He says that he does not know if Mr. Reagan was aware of the diversion of arms-sales money to the contras but that William J. Casey, Director of Central Intelligence, had approved it. Mr. Casey had recently died. NOV. 18 The Congressional committees conclude that the President failed to meet his constitutional mandate to ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed."" The committees say that he bears ""ultimate responsibility. 1988 MARCH 11 Mr. McFarlane pleads guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding from Congress information about the Administration's efforts to help the contras. He is later sentenced to two years' probation and 200 hours of community service. MARCH 16 A Federal grand jury indicts Colonel North, Mr. Poindexter, Mr. Secord and Mr. Hakim on an array of charges, among them conspiracy to defraud the Government by providing the contras with funds from Iran. MARCH 18 Colonel North resigns from the Marine Corps. 1989 JAN. 5 The defense's demands for classified Government documents, and the Government's refusal to provide them, lead to the dropping of two central counts against Mr. North. MAY 4 Mr. North is convicted of obstructing Congress, destroying documents and accepting an illegal gratuity. He is acquitted of nine counts. JULY 25 The continuing battle over classified documents leads to the dropping of two of the most serious charges against Mr. Poindexter. NOV. 8 Mr. Secord pleads guilty to one count of making a false statement to Congress. The plea resolves all charges against him. 1990 APRIL 7 Mr. Poindexter is convicted of conspiracy to mislead Congress, obstructing Congressional inquiries and making false statements. JULY 20 A Federal appeals court sets aside the North conviction, ruling that the case may have been tainted by the testimony that Mr. North, under a grant of immunity, had given to the Congressional committees. 1991 JULY 9 Alan D. Fiers, former head of the C.I.A.'s Latin America task force, pleads guilty of withholding from Congress information about the arms-money diversion. He is later sentenced to a year's probation and 100 hours of community service. SEPT. 6 Clair E. George, former chief of covert operations for the C.I.A., is indicted on perjury charges. OCT. 7Elliott L. Abrams, former Assistant Secretary of State, pleads guilty of withholding information from Congress about efforts to aid the contras. He is later sentenced to two years' probation and 100 hours of service. NOV. 26 Duane R. Clarridge, former chief of operations for the C.I.A., is indicted on perjury charges. 1992 JUNE 16 Former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger is indicted on charges of lying to Congress about his knowledge of the Iran-contra affair. DEC. 9 After one trial in which the jury deadlocked, Mr. George is convicted of lying to Congress. DEC. 24 President George Bush pardons Messrs.

us,The Bronte Bunch,"""So hopeless is the world without, / The world within I doubly prize,"" Emily Bronte wrote in a poem that reflected the tragic, insulated, inward-turned life experience of her sisters Charlotte and Anne and her brother, Bramwell, as much as her own. In THE BRONTES AT HAWORTH: The World Within (Clarkson Potter, $30), Juliet Gardiner adeptly chronicles both the outer world of the grim Yorkshire town of Haworth, where the Bronte children spent most of their lives with their highly educated but eccentric father, the Rev. Patrick Bronte, and the inner world of the imagination to which each sibling turned, first in childhood and then throughout adulthood, for solace in the wake of relentless tragedy. As young children, they witnessed the sudden deaths of their mother and then of their two oldest sisters, Maria and Elizabeth. In the years that followed, with the exception of brief forays at schools, a few trips, scattered attempts at positions outside of Haworth and Charlotte's marriage only a few months before her death at the age of 38, the Bronte siblings spent their time cloistered on the one hand by the secluded atmosphere of their father's austerely furnished parsonage, and surrounded on the other by the vast, windswept expanse of the Yorkshire moors. All four children conjured fantastical characters and kingdoms in miniature ""novels,"" diaries, poems and mock newspapers -- so-called juvenilia that would put many adult writers to shame. Ms. Gardiner, the author of ""The People's War"" and ""Over Here: The G.I.'s in Wartime Britain,"" quotes generously from these documents, as well as from the Bronte sisters' novels, family letters and Elizabeth Gaskell's classic biography of Charlotte Bronte. The books also include fascinating drawings and watercolors by the multitalented family. Ms. Gardiner provides an excellent overview of the Brontes and an insightful journey into the artistic imagination. DIANE COLE",1994-01-23T05:00:00+0000

It was the best quarterly performance for the gross domestic product in six years. Perhaps as good as the strong and broad-based gain was that core inflation grew just 1.3 percent in the quarter, the best since 1967. Economists are predicting that growth in coming months will not be as powerful as last quarter's rate, but it should be strong enough to keep consumers upbeat about the future. In 1993 over all, the G.D.P. grew 2.9 percent. It was the best rate since 1988 and a better annual rate than in any year during the Bush Administration.

As if it were a show that had been put together by the man considered to be the greatest producer in Broadway's history, what appears at first blush to be just another coffeetable extravaganza proves far more substantial than its opulent illustrations and lavish packaging might suggest. Richard and Paulette Ziegfeld persuasively argue that Ziegfeld was more than just an extravagant showman; he was also an artist who ""raised the revue form progressively from burlesque to vaudeville to art."" Ziegfeld began his legendary career in 1893 by promoting Sandow, a circus strongman, in his native Chicago. Within a few years Ziegfeld had settled in New York, where he produced more than 80 shows before his death in 1932 at the age of 65. From the start, the authors write, his shows flirted with ""the bounds of propriety"" and ""prompted talk about vulgarity,"" but in the end ""his ability to meld the best of both high and low cultures"" had permanently shaped the course of the American theater. In addition to ""The Ziegfeld Follies,"" his annual signature offering, Ziegfeld produced a wide variety of plays and musical diversions, often showcasing his many mistresses or his long-suffering second wife, Billie Burke. In the same way that Ziegfeld provided more than simply the titillation his works were famous for, the authors' early peekaboo treatment of Ziegfeld's notorious womanizing and gambling gives way to a deeperanalysis of what such behavior entailed. The book has many revealing anecdotes, and a veritable who's who of the American theater parades through these pages just as it paraded through Ziegfeld's life.
