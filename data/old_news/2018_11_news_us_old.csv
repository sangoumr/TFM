Such courage! Kthe wrote, of the character Gilgi. I was curious for any glimpse into my grandmothers mind during this chapter of her life when she was an expressionist dancer in Hamburg and sported boyish haircuts and berets. She had recently fallen in love with my grandfather Hermann and was summoning the courage to divorce her husband.

us,How Do You Talk to Children About Politics These Days? Try These Books.,"Its a question parents have wrestled with since the 2016 presidential election: How do we explain this political moment to our children? I, for one, was hoping the answer would not involve a book aimed at teenagers in which a candidates obscene reference to female anatomy appears on Page 2, but that is where we are. In UNPRESIDENTED: A Biography of Donald Trump (Feiwel and Friends, 384 pp., $19.99; ages 12 and up), Martha Brockenbrough provides an encyclopedic tale of the rise of Donald J. Trump. Brockenbroughs version is, unapologetically, a liberals framing of events. Then again, Im not sure if a nonpartisan book about Trump could grow out of the current climate. For now, there is this thorough, hard-hitting volume that seeks to explain Trump, from the time he was born with a silver spoon and golden hair, pink cheeks and a tiny pucker of a mouth, to his shocker of a presidential campaign (candidates typically dont insult the parents of soldiers who die in combat).",2018-11-02T09:00:07+0000

Her job was locating Gilded Age table settings, and these majolica shellfish plates made in Staffordshire, England, by Minton were a must-have in upper-class homes of the 1860s on both sides of the Atlantic. A few years ago, when Roman and Williams were asked to redo the British galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she saw the plates again and began collecting. Today, Standefer has amassed 20 of the jewel-tone platters, with their sea-creature embellishments and contoured divots (you shuck the bivalves and slide them onto the plate, shell-less). Recently, she has put a few up for sale at the Guild, a retail outpost she and Alesch opened last year in SoHo.

Under other circumstances, we would split everything equally among our children, but for our addicted son, this would be like throwing gasoline on a fire. Even the process of distributing family treasures is fraught, knowing our son would head straight to a pawnshop. We are thinking of putting his share into a trust to be used exclusively for his future health needs, rehab and, hopefully, sobriety.

Finally is the operative term here as the chef, who cooked at Per Se and Lincoln Ristorante, said he has been waiting about 30 years to open his own restaurant, spending the past five or so years on this project. The dining room, at the back of the hotel  past his Leonelli Focacceria e Pasticceria and the informal Leonelli Taberna  is fairly intimate, with 45 seats and another 10 at the bar. The dcor suggests Art Deco and Modernist design, and includes original walnut woodwork, restored mosaic floors and a dramatic light fixture that hangs from a central skylight. Mr. Benno has tapped his French and Italian training and experience for a Mediterranean menu with a focus on Liguria, in Northern Italy, and Provence, in Southern France. Theres a risotto with squash and chestnuts; skate almondine; olive oil-poached steelhead trout; a terrine of sweetbreads, rabbit and foie gras; and short ribs nioise-style. Pastas include spaghetti made with burnt wheat (grano arso) and dressed with seafood, lumache with lobster fra diavolo, and classic agnolotti del plin with duck and foie gras. I could not resist doing the pastas, Mr. Benno said. The pastry chef, Lindsey Bittner, also taps into Mediterranean fare with a rosemary flan, chocolate babka with pistachio halvah, and pears with goat cheese.

He was being a little disingenuous. He knew enough about the topic that these psychologists and neuroscientists and physicians and anthropologists and philosophers had come to his city to talk about  the placebo effect, the phenomenon whereby suffering people get better from treatments that have no discernible reason to work  to call it fake medicine, and to add that it probably works because people like to be cheated.

us,How Does a Museum Buy an Artwork That Doesnt Physically Exist?,"THE ARTIST TINO SEHGAL believes there are enough objects in the world. His art involves people, not things, and the process of selling it is entirely verbal. Sehgal does not issue receipts. He does not permit his work to be photographed or filmed, nor does he produce catalogs or even wall labels to accompany his exhibitions. In fact, he eschews all forms of documentation, written or otherwise, in relation to the sale, presentation and care of his work. His pieces, which he calls constructed situations, usually involve players or participants who have been trained by the artist to enact specific actions. At the 2005 Venice Biennale, in a piece titled This Is So Contemporary, participants dressed as security guards leapt around visitors to the German Pavilion chanting, Ooh, this is so contemporary, contemporary, contemporary! before resuming nonchalant poses. For a 2010 show at the Guggenheim Museum called This Progress, a series of increasingly older interpreters guided visitors up the museums spiraled rotunda while carrying on free-form conversations that began with the visitors personal definition of progress. His most famous work, Kiss, from 2002, involves a man and a woman recreating iconic embraces from artworks throughout history, inspired by oeuvres as distinct as those of Auguste Rodin and Jeff Koons, on the floor of an exhibition space.",2018-11-08T22:30:07+0000

On Nov. 11, 2018, that peace agreement will be 100 years old. To commemorate the anniversary, we asked readers to share stories and memories of their relatives who had a role in World War I. We received hundreds of submissions, many of which went beyond the traditional definition of a war story; among the tales of loss, death and trauma were also stories of love, mischief and unexpected happiness. Countless families were forged during and after the war: young men and women, who may not have ever met otherwise, brought together under circumstances tied to their service. Other readers wrote of relatives who joined the military to earn their citizenship after immigrating to the United States. Sometimes even without understanding a word of English, these men put on a uniform and fought for a country they wanted to call home. ",2018-11-09T10:00:23+0000

When I want my outfit to pop out, I tie the hijab tight to prevent it from being main element of my outfit. The person who most influenced my clothing style is without doubt my mom.

us,A Letter to the Army: Dont Punish the Man Who Led the Mission That Killed My Son,"After multiple investigations into the ambush in Niger that left four American soldiers dead last year, the United States Army punished several people who were involved in the mission, including the two soldiers who led the 11-man team when militants attacked it. Those punished were not reprimanded for what happened during the ambush but rather what led up to it, including poor training alongside Nigerien troops, a lack of pre-mission rehearsals and what investigators called a misleading mission plan. The leader of the Special Forces team, Capt. Mike Perozeni, along with his second in command, received a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand, known as a GOMOR. A reprimands impact is based on where it is placed in a soldiers file. If the letter is considered local, it will disappear after the soldier changes jobs. If it is permanent, it likely means the end of a career. The soldier, and others on his behalf, can write a rebuttal. Below is a letter written on behalf of Captain Perozeni by Henry Black, the father of Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, one of the four soldiers killed in the ambush. A version of this letter was delivered to Maj. Gen. Edwin J. Deedrick Jr., the commanding officer of the First Special Forces Command, who administered the letters. With Blacks permission, it has been lightly edited for clarity and to protect the identity of some of the soldiers, whose names have not been released. Thomas Gibbons-Neff",2018-11-14T16:45:04+0000

Barlow, 74, is a British artist renowned for her often-soaring sculptures cobbled together from industrial refuse, as though an ordinary urban street had suddenly come alive and risen up into a sentient colossus. Maiolino, 76, is an Italian, So Paulo-based artist celebrated for her modeled- and rolled-clay installations and sculptures that suggest the work of a housewife gone mad, as the curator Helen Molesworth once put it, and evoke everything from human organs, phalluses and rolls of bread to prehistoric worms. Barlow had a traditional arts education at Londons Chelsea College of Arts, followed by the Slade. Maiolino had a very nontraditional upbringing and education, migrating with her family from Italy to Venezuela during World War II, and then from Venezuela to Brazil, where her performances, videos and works on paper contributed, alongside work by Lygia Clark and Hlio Oiticica, to the Neo-Concrete and New Objectivity movements at a time of political upheaval in Brazil. (She audited classes at an art school in Rio de Janeiro but considers herself largely self-taught.) Both artists are mothers, and both received full recognition for their pioneering work late in life  and continue to make work in their 70s as a matter of some urgency. This month, their artworks are on view in concurrent solo exhibitions at Hauser & Wirth in New York, where we met on a brisk fall morning. There, the two artists sat down together to talk about their work and lives for the first time.",2018-11-19T19:59:50+0000

For one, theyre both artists whose gay identity is neither incidental to their work nor all-consuming. For another, they are both tireless artistic explorers, catholic in the extreme. Wainwright, son of the 70s singer-songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, fused indie folk and soft glam into a series of highly personal albums, beginning with his eponymous debut in 1998 and continuing through his pair of dynamic 2003-4 Want albums. Then he decided to write operas  the second, Hadrian, with a libretto by Daniel MacIvor, premiered in Toronto in October  and to compose music for the renowned American experimental theater director Robert Wilsons 2009 staging of Shakespeares sonnets in Berlin. These works brought him into the creative orbit of the Amsterdam-based van Hove, whose freewheeling multimedia adaptations pay equal homage to avant-garde performance pioneers like Wilson and august playwrights like Arthur Miller, whose The Crucible and A View From the Bridge he reimagined earlier this decade. (His theater company, Internationaal Theater Amsterdam, recently premiered A Little Life, adapted from the novel written by Ts editor in chief, Hanya Yanagihara.) Wainwright and van Hove met up one October night in a Japanese restaurant in downtown New York; van Hove, 60, had just finished a day of rehearsals for the Broadway adaptation of Sidney Lumets prescient 1976 media satire, Network (opening Dec. 6), which he is directing and which stars Bryan Cranston. Wainwright, 45, had just flown in from his home in Los Angeles, the day after debuting his tense, beautiful and political new single, Sword of Damocles, as he prepares to go on tour. They were coming from disparate places, running on different clocks, but immediately opened up about that which matters most to them: politics, coming out, the multiplicity of the self  and the benefits of boarding school.

He had been invited to give a talk during Bergman Week, an annual festival at which fans attend lectures and screenings and go on Bergman Safaris, driving on one-lane roads to the pebbly coasts and placid cabins where many of the Swedish directors films were made. Lanthimos explored the Bergman residence with its clean lines and windows opening directly onto the Baltic Sea, examining notes in the directors own handwriting scrawled directly upon the furniture (Im successful at my career, and Im still sleepless). He saw an original print of Persona in the 15-seat private theater, where Bergmans ample leather recliner is always left empty in the front of the room, and even viewed a segment from one of his own works (Dogtooth, his second film), something he hardly ever does. While editing, he watches each film over and over, so by the time its ready to be shown, he cant wait until its the last time, for at least 10, 15 years.

us,The American Spirit of Coachs Stuart Vevers,"Coachs creative director, Stuart Vevers, first started paying attention to clothes at the Manchester and Leeds nightclubs he visited as a teenager. Before that, I was a kid from a working-class family in Northern England who didnt know the fashion industry even existed, he says. Then all of a sudden, I was obsessively dressing in paisley shirts and vintage velvet blazers and customizing my jeans. At 18, he left his home in Cumbria to study fashion at Londons University of Westminster, graduating with an assistant job at Calvin Klein in New York (I showed up at the interviewers hotel unannounced and begged her to look at my portfolio). He returned to Europe two years later, eventually landing as the head of accessories at Givenchy and then at Louis Vuitton, where Marc Jacobs was his mentor. With the launches of Givenchys pumpkin bags and the multicolor monograms Takashi Murakami collaborated on with Louis Vuitton, Vevers became synonymous with the early 2000s It-bag phenomenon and was hired to reinvigorate Mulberry in 2004, followed by Loewe in 2007. Those roles made him an obvious choice for Coach, the American heritage brand that got its start in 1941 producing billfolds and briefcases inspired by baseball gloves. Although I use our history as a jumping-off point, I felt we needed to radically catapult forward, says Vevers, 45. On day one, I decided to think beyond just accessories.",2018-11-27T16:14:35+0000

Kung Fu Tea, a Taiwanese-style bubble tea company that started in 2010 in Flushing, Queens, and now has 200 outlets in 30 states, has joined forces with TKK Fried Chicken, a chain founded in 1974 in Taiwan. The Taiwanese recipe called original on the menu is crisp and moderately spiced. There is also a milder version and, for the American market, a crisper, more forcefully seasoned one. How is this fried chicken different from the Korean variety found all over New York? Taiwanese fried chicken is first marinated for 24 hours to add flavor, said Steven Luw, the general operating manager. Then it gets a flour breading and is fried once. Korean fried chicken is usually dipped in batter and fried twice. The company, which will count this location as its first American restaurant in addition to the 68 branches it has in Taiwan and Shanghai, is also offering items that are not on the menu in Asia, including curly fries, a fried chicken sandwich, chunky coleslaw, Wisconsin-style cheese curds, biscuits and seared shishito peppers. The bubble tea partnership provides many colorful teas with optional toppings like red beans and crushed Oreos, served at varying sweetness, iced to hot. Beer and wine are also served. The bright space has tables in front and back separated by an open kitchen and ordering counter. It took but a few minutes during a recent trial period for this place to become a canteen for nearby Baruch College students. (Opens Friday) ",2018-11-27T19:20:38+0000

The notion is nothing new. In classical Greece, in fourth- and fifth-century Athens, the major artistic prize of the era, for drama, was given under the auspices of Dionysus, a god of wine and ecstasy. Dionysus is a curious proto-patron saint of the arts, given the story of his birth. Zeus  king of gods, thunder god  wooed the mortal Semele. Hera, Zeus wife and the goddess of heaven, tired of her husbands philandering, learned of Zeus latest conquest and convinced Semele to demand that Zeus reveal his true form  lightning  a sight Hera knew would kill her: No mortal can bear a god in full. Zeus assented, Semele died, but Zeus saved Semeles fetal son, tucking him into his thigh, carrying him to term, earning the child the epithet twice born: to a mortal, to a god.",2018-11-28T22:35:39+0000

At Miu Mius fall 2018 show, the model Naomi Chin Wings windswept bouffant gave her tailored trench coat a more casual feel, while at Valentinos fall couture presentation, Fran Summers streamed down the runway with an exaggerated lionlike mane blown out around her face.

At Chlos spring show, for example, models wore a more low-key, but still bouncy, sweptback look.

Yet to think this way ignores evidence to the contrary  evidence in the form of human lives. One of the great paradoxes of America is that we could be a country that elected its first black president, one whose term saw, yes, a radically more expansive understanding of what it means to be human, but also one of the worst school shootings in our history, a mass shooting at a gay nightclub and multiple murders of unarmed black boys and men, shot because of who they were, not what they did. Crucially, that presidents reactions to these horrors were markedly different than those of our current president to similar incidents, but the fact remains that no era since our founding has been free of these contradictions (indeed, these murders that occurred during the previous administration were not new developments  it was technology that enabled their immediate and widespread dissemination). The thrill and sorrow of America is that our brief history is one of steps forward and backward, that ours is a nation in a constant state of revision, that we are each of us choreographers of its halting, tripping, sometimes ugly, sometimes transcendent dance.",2018-11-30T10:13:46+0000

Theres a turbulent, myth-inflected debut that made its author the youngest-ever finalist for the Booker Prize, Everything Under. Theres a dystopian New York story about consumerism and immigration, Severance, and a surreal Japanese story collection, The Lonesome Bodybuilder, that shakes up narrative expectations right alongside social expectations about gender and marriage and body image.

She admits she hasnt found a sufficient answer to this question, but I do know that the work of black women writers presents a ferocious challenge to old sexist perceptions; as [the author and scholar Farah] Griffin says, the difference between this moment and others is that, in the past, to be a black writer was to be a man.
