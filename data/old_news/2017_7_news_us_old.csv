Agnew, a popular figure with the growing conservative base of the Republican Party, was facing suspicions of accepting bribes for services rendered during his years as governor of Maryland. More important, President Richard M. Nixon seemed incapable of putting Watergate  a catchall term for the White Houses involvement in political espionage, break-ins and subsequent cover-ups  behind him.

us,"On Diversity in Publishing, a Young Star Warns: Get It Right","Representing: Angie Thomass first novel, The Hate U Give, about the police killing of an unarmed black teenager, has been a stalwart of the young adult hardcover list since its release late in February  it debuted at No. 1 and, after 18 weeks on the list, is back in the top position. Thomass book made news (including a front-page New York Times profile) partly for its topical story line and partly because Thomas herself, a 29-year-old from Jackson, Miss., is so cheerfully a symbol of change in the publishing industry. Mississippi has a great literary history, but the other authors are dead or white, she told her hometown newspaper in March. As a kid, I would wonder, Is this something that can happen to me, the little black girl from the hood? Now that it has, Thomas has become a literary ambassador of sorts, visiting classrooms and, last month, advising would-be authors at BuzzFeed how to represent traditionally underrepresented figures. One tip: Learn your stuff. If you were writing a legal thriller but have no legal background, she said, would you do some research? So why not do the same when approaching marginalized characters? When I was writing The Hate U Give, I had to research gangs. I have not been in a gang nor do I have family members who have been in gangs, so I had to research it. I had to look at firsthand accounts of that culture  not just what the media portrays. I watched documentaries and consulted with attorneys. This also applies to identity. If youre writing about a gay boy or a black girl, you need to talk to a gay boy or black girl. You have to go above and beyond to get it right. The internet is a beautiful thing for a writer, but we have to put in the work. I think thats key: Put in the work. Whether youre writing about diversity or a legal thriller, you have to put in the work. Still, Thomas has found some audiences more receptive than others  a fact that led her to young adult literature in the first place. Not to throw shade or anything, she told Cosmopolitan in March, but I feel like teenagers are much more open-minded and willing to listen.",2017-07-07T17:09:54+0000

Phillip Cho and Anna Lee, fledgling restaurateurs born in South Korea, held bacon dinners for friends over the past year with a reception enthusiastic enough for them to open this informal place, set with picnic tables. Their chef, Brian Crawford, who worked with Todd English, serves a nine-course menu ($45) for 20 seats at a bar and communal table. Among the dishes are bacon carpaccio (sliced, cured pork belly with truffle oil and shaved Parmesan); bacon sushi seared tableside and served over rice; pork jowl (a kind of bacon, too) with chive kimchi; a chunk of pork belly glazed with gochujang; and pork belly schnitzel with forceful Korean mustard. The finale is a sweet kimchi-iced doughnut served with bacon fat whipped cream. You dont get a decent experience with Korean bacon in New York, Mr. Cho said. Our goal is to make it fun and approachable. Theres a takeout window that opens onto the street. Theres also Beats, a karaoke bar on the lower level.

We had a lot of friends in art and music, guys who had great taste but not the means to spend $4,000 on a custom suit in Manhattan. We thought we would have a couple orders every week. The couple underestimated the demand for their custom suits, which cost about $1,700, and for their ready-to-wear models, priced at $1,350. Last summer, they moved their original shop into a larger space in Williamsburg, and in November, they opened a second location, in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn.

Sherman Alexies sentence repeats the word loss 13 times, and my mind tolerates about three of them before it wants to skip ahead, bundling the rest as simply a whole lot of loss. (Alexies memoir makes clear that he is, indeed, the product of quite a lot of loss: the decimation and displacement of his tribe, the diversion of his peoples sacred salmon by a dam, the early deaths of his grandparents, the loss of his own childhood to abuse and on and on and on.)",2017-07-14T09:00:07+0000

(She also demonstrates a fondness for silly jokes: I hate those people who knock on your door and tell you how you need to be saved or youll burn, she posted a couple of years ago. Stupid firemen.) So when Garwood decided to feature a brilliant hacker as the heroine of her latest book, Wired  which hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 7 and traces the relationship between the hacker, Allison, and a raffish F.B.I. agent  she turned to more computer-savvy acquaintances. To say Im not an expert on hacking is an understatement, she told me via email. The more I read, the more I discovered there is no such thing as a little research. The subject is so vast and fascinating. I definitely wanted Allisons skills to be in the realm of possibility, and so, when I was unsure about something, I checked with people who are knowledgeable about programming and the workings of the web. But the goal was still to write a novel, not a users manual. While hacking was the backdrop for the book, she said, I didnt want it to be the primary focus. Too much technical information would bog down the story, which is about two people who, despite coming from very different worlds, are drawn to each other.

When we arrived at my friends house, I asked the driver if he would help me carry the wine, because I had another bag to carry. He refused, on the grounds that he was a Muslim and was not allowed to touch alcohol. So of course, I carried the wine myself. The next day, I called the owner of the limo service  a close friend of mine who is also an observant Muslim  to apologize for my insensitivity and any awkwardness my request might have caused. He expressed surprise and then outrage at his drivers behavior. A few days later, my friend told me that he had fired the driver. When you are a driver, my friend said, you are not a Muslim, a Christian or a Jew  you are a driver, and your job is to deliver service. You didnt ask him to drink the wine; you asked him to help you carry it into the house. Hes done. I still feel guilty that this man was fired. Help me think the ethics of this through.
