us,Summer Laundry Tips,"In warm weather, dry-cleaning bills can soar. But for some garments, laundering can save money and even time, since you don't have to rely on a cleaner's schedule. Knowing what you can wash also makes vacation packing easier. Don't rush to the suds with everything you own. Constructed garments with sewn-in shoulder pads or fused facings must be professionally cleaned; so must silk organdy, taffeta and chiffon. But many fabrics labeled ''dry clean'' can be safely washed. Summer whites - cottons, linens, silks -actually benefit; repeated dry cleaning causes yellowing. If a fabric is dyed, put a paper towel under an edge or a hem and press down with moist cotton. If no color bleeds from the garment, you may be able to wash it. Some suggestions: use a mild detergent; do not rub fabric; use plastic hangers (wooden ones may stain); never use soap, fabric softeners or chlorine bleach on synthetics.

Delegates approved a major overhaul of the Soviet political system, including a partial transfer of power from the party to popularly elected legislatures. Page 1 Boris Yeltsin and Yegor Ligachev clashed at the Communist Party conference. Mr. Yeltsin, the former Moscow party chief, asked for honor. Mr. Ligachev, the favorite of party conservatives, denounced him. 1 Yaroslavl's attention was undivided as residents of the industrial city 250 miles northeast of Moscow followed the national Communist Party conference. Interest in the conference was palpable throughout the city. 7 Key sections from Gorbachev's closing speech. 6 Stricter residential segregation would be imposed under legislation proposed by the South African Government, apparently under pressure from the political right wing. Penalties would also be harsher. 1 Further American aid to the contras was enthusiastically discussed by Secretary of State George Shultz, Nicaraguan rebel leaders said. The proposal is for at least $30 million of additional assistance to rebels. 1 Squatters fled across the Berlin wall into East Berlin after West German police ordered them off the Lenne Triangle, one of several pieces of land involved in an exchange between East Germany and West Berlin. 2 Iraq said it used chemical weapons in the war against Iran. Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Foreign Minister, insisted that Iran used them first. He made the acknowlegement while aswering questions at a news conference. 3 Outward calm returned to Burma after violent clashes between demonstrators and the police and military on June 21, according to diplomats, who said that tension remains unusually high. 3 Three Cambodian opposition forces agreed to a common front for talks with the Cambodian Government and Vietnam, and will seek an international force to guarantee the independence of any future Cambodian government. 3 Baseball in Finland is fast-paced, with skill, speed and tactical brilliance counting for more than strength. Pesapallo, the Finnish variety of the game, reflects its origins as an exercise for training troops to fight Russians. 4 West German begins duties as NATO Secretary General 2 National 8, 24, 28-29 Payments on nine military programs were halted by Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci because of evidence that competition for the contracts, valued at more than $1 billion, had been tainted by fraud. 1 The manufacture of nuclear weapons has produced radioactive and chemical pollution that will cost up to $110 billion to clean up, the Government said. Disposing of radioactive wastes will cost billions more. 8 Federal aid to farmers is premature, Secretary of Agriculture Richard E. Lyng said after briefing President Reagan on the drought. He said the Administration was confident that Congress could craft a farm aid program. 8 Two black families in Boston will move into an all-white housing project in the mostly-white South Boston neighborhood. The city has spent seven months trying to make sure the families move in without incident. 8 A therapy for multiple sclerosis has halted the disease's progression in some patients, according to a study. Radiation is aimed at specific sites in the body, depleting white blood cells that attack nerve tissue. 24 News analysis: The dollar's rise did not make the Administration uncomfortable. It feels that there is more to gain than to lose from slightly higher levels of the dollar against other major currencies. 31 Consumer rejection of glitziness in advertisements has prompted at least four national advertising campaigns to adopt home-movie techniques, one of several new forms of ''reality'' advertising. 31 Judge upholds Federal rules on abortion counseling 46 Politics 29 The Democratic National Convention is the object of a three-way tugging match among Hollywood producers, network television executives and supporters of Michael S. Dukakis, the party's likely nominee. 1 In his search for a running mate, Michael S. Dukakis has taken informal polls among voters about their choice for a Vice Presidential candidate. At a stop in Dayton, Ohio, Senator John Glenn drew a standing ovation. 29 Diplomats watching U.S. politics try to avoid publicly picking a favorite in the Presidential election. While many are trying to figure out Michael Dukakis's foreign policy, they already know George Bush. 29 Regional 25-28 Five firefighters died in Hackensack, N.J., when the roof of a burning building collapsed on them, officials said. The five were spraying water at the ceiling of a garage at Hackensack Ford when part of it fell. 1 The Government may not prevent defendants from hiring the lawyers of their choice by freezing and seizing assets, a Federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled. The Supreme Court is expected to consider the issue. 25 A building in Times Square's center will probably not be demolished as part of the redevelopment because officials responsible for the project have been unable to agree on an alternative idea for the site. 25 Two girls were crushed to death and a third was severely injured in New York City when the front stoop and the archway of an apartment building in the East Village collapsed, the police said. 25 The end of diesel engines on the N.J. Transit line from South Amboy to Long Branch puts an end to quick profits for a saloon in South Amboy, where passengers grabbed a drink while the engines were changed. 26 A strike at the submarine shipyard in Groton, Conn., started as 10,000 workers vowed to stay away from the Electric Boat works, Connecticut's second largest private employer, until they receive a pay increase. 26 Nearly 3 tons of cocaine was seized and 3 Colombians were arrested on Long Island. Federal officials said the seizure indicated that two groups of cocaine traffickers may be competing for the New York market. 28 Salute to ailing veteran of the Left 25 New York judge is censured 27 Transcripts of mob tapes detail plot to kill Schiff and Gottis 27",1988-07-02T05:00:00+0000

The victory was Japan's third against one loss in the five-game series. Andy Benes of Evansville University, the N.C.A.A. player of the year and the top pick of the San Diego Padres in the recent major league amateur draft, was tagged for four hits and five runs in three and a third innings.(AP) Rowing Syracuse Advances: Syracuse University achieved the first significant American victories at the Henley Royal Regatta yesterday, capturing its opening heat of the Grand Challenge Cup, and advancing its four-with-coxswain entry in the Prince Philip Challenge Cup. The United States began this regatta three days ago with 42 entries in the 12 events for which it is eligible, but by the end of yesterday's racing only nine entries remained in competition in Henley-on-Thames, England. In an all-American heat of the Grand Challenge Cup, Henley's premier event, Syracuse defeated U.C.L.A. in this straight knock-out, side-by-side format, which distinguishes Henley from other international regattas. Away from the start at 41 strokes to the minute, the Syracuse eight led by a half boat length a quarter-mile into the mile-and-five-sixteenths course and increased the margin to three lengths. Syracuse's varsity four with coxswain beat a boat of recent Syracuse graduates to give the Orangemen their second victory of the day in the Prince Philip Cup.

Four riders had one knock-down for four faults leaving them tied for second place: Katie Prudent of Middleburg, Va., on Special Envoy, Margie Goldstein of Miami on Salute, Linda Kossick of Somers, Conn., on Non Pariel and Louis Jacobs of East Aurora, N.Y., on Desiree. Golf Eagle for Jacobsen: Peter Jacobsen scored an eagle-3 on the way to a seven-under-par 65 yesterday that lifted him into a two-shot lead after the second round of the $900,000 Western Open in Oak Brook, Ill. Jacobsen, on the rebound from a back injury that has slowed him for four seasons, completed two trips over the Butler National Golf Club course in 135, nine under par. The eagle came on the 12th hole, when Jacobsen hit a 5-iron second shot to about eight feet and made the putt. He avoided what would have been his only bogey by sinking an eight-footer on the final hole after putting his approach in a bunker. Ed Fiori and Dan Forsman shared second at 137. Fiori had a 67 and Forsman shot a 69. (AP) Bogey-Free Round for Little: Sally Little overcame damp playing conditions yesterday to shoot a seven-under-par 65 and take a one-shot lead after two rounds of the $500,000 du Maurier Classic in Coquitlam, British Columbia.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE CHARM SCHOOL. By Nelson DeMille. (Warner, $17.95.) Nelson DeMille's new novel is a Moscow thriller, and he has mastered the mechanics of the genre, moving the plot swiftly with regular intrusions of violence, ironic twists and cynical betrayals. Mr. DeMille, whose last novel, ''Word of Honor,'' was set in Vietnam, has done his homework on Russia, accurately describing Moscow's hotels and streets and even providing dialogue with Russian obscenities translated into English, all of which suggests the assiduous note-taking (and the occasional technical mistake) of a literate tourist with a good guide. The plot begins with an American yuppie buzzing through the Russian countryside in his Pontiac Trans Am - and encountering an American pilot who was shot down over Vietnam and has been held prisoner ever since in a special training camp for spies near Moscow. Luckily, the yuppie is smart enough to call his embassy before he is murdered. The camp is the Charm School, where captured airmen are forced to train Soviet spies to be perfect Americans. To find it, a hard-nosed, cynical agent named Sam Hollis starts poking around in the woods, accompanied by the embassy's assistant press officer, Lisa Rhodes, who has just finished an affair with another of the embassy's spies. Eventually, the two get into the camp and meet the obligatory villain, Burov. They have conversations about East and West, God and morality. Some of it is convincing, some embarrassing. At one point, Sam says, ''You like spies.'' To which Lisa replies, ''I'm a spy groupie.'' When they finally get into the Charm School, which looks like a town in suburban America, she says, ''I can't believe this, Sam,'' and he agrees, ''It's a bit surreal.'' In the two years I worked in Moscow as a reporter, I met several American spies. None of them talked like that.",1988-07-03T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"MOMENTUM: Women in American Politics Now. By Ronna Romney and Beppie Harrison. (Crown, $18.95.) In 1973, there were 16 women in the House of Representatives. Fifteen years later, there are 23. That barely qualifies as progress, let alone the ''momentum'' of the title of this breezy, upbeat account of the current status of women in American political life. While Ronna Romney and Beppie Harrison acknowledge that the outlook is mixed, with women still facing obstacles in raising money and even in being taken seriously as candidates, they view the glass as half-full, not half-empty. For one thing, they love politics. (Ronna Romney is the Republican national committeewoman from Michigan, where her father-in-law was a governor.) ''It's almost like grown-up camp, to tell the truth,'' one Republican activist told them of life during a campaign, and a view of politics as fun and exciting, worthwhile for its own sake, shapes the book. Based on interviews with several dozen women at all levels of government, it does not rise often enough above the anecdotal level. That would be less of a failing if the women themselves emerged in sharply etched portraits, but they pass by for the most part in a blur of names and titles. The authors, who have previously written a book about marriage, pin their hopes for the future of women in politics on the 18,000 who now hold office at the state and local levels, predicting that women may eventually become ''a substantial majority in city halls and state houses.'' They offer no particular evidence of how or why this will happen, but their sincerity and enthusiasm are such that they almost make it sound plausible.",1988-07-03T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"LIFE BEING THE BEST & OTHER STORIES. By Kay Boyle. Edited by Sandra Whipple Spanier. (New Directions, Cloth, $18.95; Paper, $8.95.) This collection of short stories celebrates the enduring artistic discipline of Kay Boyle, who, unlike some of her better-known peers, survived the halcyon days of Paris in the 1920's. Although Ms. Boyle is not as notorious as some of the other Moderns -those intrepid expatriate writers who set out to change language, mesh literature and social context and expose the dissonance of contemporary life - she evokes these tensions with a gossamer finesse. Her characters (wise, sad children; jilted ladies; demimondaines; women on the cusp of consciousness) are each preserved in fleeting, almost prosaic moments, each fraught with weakness and passion. Ms. Boyle animates their interior lives with unsentimental grace and acute prescience (judging from her story ''Astronomer's Wife,'' for example, she clearly grasped that the personal is political long before that feminist maxim appeared). The title story -in which an alienated, dignified boy answers a hypothetical question with simple, terrible justice - provides the rest of the book with pitch and momentum. ''Life Being the Best'' gives breadth to the themes that have preoccupied Ms. Boyle throughout her career: the inviolate integrity of the human soul, the impact of external events on the most intimate of feelings, our fractured experience of love versus duty, self-respect versus hubris, social convention versus personal ethic. For 60 years, Kay Boyle's steady hand in rendering detail, authentic characterization and unequivocal moral vision has never faltered. She is still unquestionably modern.",1988-07-03T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN, by H. F. Saint. (Dell, $4.95.) Nick Halloway, a New York securities analyst, finds insider trading an easier game after a mishap in a Government-financed laboratory makes him invisible. ''The prose is so elegantly knowing, particularly the sport it makes of the Wall Street types who inadvertently help Nick out of his pickle, [ that ] 'Memoirs of an Invisible Man' sustains our interest to the end,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times last year. ORPHANS: Real and Imaginary, by Eileen Simpson. (Plume/New American Library, $8.95.) Eileen Simpson lost her mother when she was 11 months old and her father when she was 7. When her husband died, she was shocked into remembering her life as an orphan. The result is a book that combines reminiscence with psychoanalysis and examines orphans as they appear in history, literature and even comic strips, like Little Orphan Annie. ''There are passages of uncommon beauty in which she is for the first time able to imagine an invisible mother,'' Sheila Ballantyne said here in 1987. ''And there are others in which she fantasizes her parents to be always poised above some eternal dance floor, forever young, frozen in states of perfection.'' MISS UNDINE'S LIVING ROOM, by James Wilcox. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) Olive Mackie of James Wilcox's fictional Tula Springs, La., is afraid that the murder her 91-year-old uncle is believed to have committed will ruin her campaign to become Superintendent of Streets, Parks and Garbage. Last year, our reviewer, Rosemary Daniell, called this a novel of ''small-town Southern life as it often is, spontaneously and effortlessly funny - here magnified by Mr. Wilcox's acute ear, his selective wit. . . . Like Barbara Pym, [ he ] has created a delicious little world.'' STRAIGHT ON TILL MORNING: The Biography of Beryl Markham, by Mary S. Lovell. (St. Martin's, $10.95.) The lovers of Beryl Markham, the first woman to fly solo and nonstop across the Atlantic from England to North America, included Leopold Stokowski and Antoine de Saint-Exupery, who helped her write her celebrated memoir, ''West With the Night.'' Mary S. Lovell's biography is ''the story of a phenomenal life, told convincingly by someone fascinated by her subject,'' Diane Ackerman said here last year. MOTHER LOVE, by Candace Flynt. (Plume/New American Library, $7.95.) Even on her deathbed, an overbearing, alcoholic mother can't stop trying to manipulate her daughters' lives. Last year, our reviewer, Julia Markus, said this novel is ''a work of enormous beauty and psychological insight.'' THE MORMON CORPORATE EMPIRE, by John Heinerman and Anson Shupe. (Beacon, $11.95.) When the authors, a Mormon medical anthropologist and a sociologist, investigated the finances of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, they discovered an $8 billion empire working ''to reshape our society and its democratic institutions.'' ''They tell us a lot we didn't know about Mormon investments,'' our reviewer, Wallace Turner, said in 1986, and ''make a strong case that the vaunted Mormon welfare program is a myth.'' A HERO IN HIS TIME, by Arthur A. Cohen. (University of Chicago, $9.95.) For inscrutable geopolitical reasons, a minor Russian Jewish poet is dispatched to New York by the K.G.B. to read a poem written by a machine. ''Arthur Cohen has achieved here a tour de force,'' Geoffrey Wolff said in The Book Review in 1976, ''bringing the idea of poetry to life in a messy little man, no hero at all, not even much of a poet.'' The same publisher has brought out new editions of two other novels by Mr. Cohen, who died in 1986. IN THE DAYS OF SIMON STERN ($10.95) is about a blind scribe who tells the story of the Messiah, a millioniare real estate dealer born on the Lower East Side. ''Every vein of this book runs with a brilliance of Jewish insight and erudition to be found in no other novelist,'' Cynthia Ozick said here in 1973. In ACTS OF THEFT ($9.95), a sculptor who trafficks in stolen archeological treasures provides Mr. Cohen with a vehicle to write about the meaning of art, creation and the worship of graven images. THE OTHER NUREMBERG: The Untold Story of the Tokyo War Crimes Trials, by Arnold C. Brackman. (Quill, $9.95.) It was not only the Nazis who committed atrocities during World War II, Arnold Brackman reminds us in the first comprehensive account of the Japanese equivalent of the Nuremberg trials. ''This book is a necessary reminder of a dark, half-forgotten chapter of human history,'' Gaddis Smith said here last year. ''Chapters on wanton rape, torture and murder of civilians and prisoners of war are gruesome in the extreme, almost equal in sickening impact to accounts of the Nazi death camps. . . . What happened seems to have been done with grim, deliberate self-awareness.'' IN PURSUIT OF REASON: The Life of Thomas Jefferson, by Noble E. Cunningham Jr. (Ballantine, $10.95.) It is not easy condensing Thomas Jefferson's anomalous life to a single volume, Richard J. Margolis said in The Book Review last year. While he found this ''pithy and rational'' biography by ''a scrupulous scholar'' a bit one-dimensional, over all, he said, it is a success. HUNGER STRIKE: The Anorectic's Struggle as a Metaphor for Our Age, by Susie Orbach. (Avon, $4.50.) When this feminist analysis of anorexia was published last year, our reviewer, Judith Moore, said the author argues her case ''systematically, convincingly - and movingly. . . . It would be a shame for booksellers to relegate 'Hunger Strike' to the 'women's' shelves.''",1988-07-03T05:00:00+0000

All but one of the space shuttle's three main engines have mysteriously failed minutes after takeoff, leaving the ship crippled dozens of miles above the choppy Atlantic.

The commander and pilot jettison the huge external fuel tank and stabilize the spaceship as it plummets. Five miles up, a crew member explosively blows off the shuttle's side hatch and extends a telescoping escape pole 12 feet beyond the ship. With the craft on autopilot, the astronauts gather on the shuttle's middeck, still dressed, as they were at takeoff, in newly designed flight suits with built-in parachutes, life rafts and oxygen supplies, so they can survive the rarefied atmosphere high above the earth. At four miles up, they bail out. One by one, they hook onto the escape pole and slide down, the device guiding them away from the craft, keeping the 200-mile-per-hour headwinds from bashing them into a wing or engine pod as they fall from the doomed ship.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"NIGHT OVER DAY OVER NIGHT. By Paul Watkins. (Knopf, $17.95.) Paul Watkins, a 23-year-old American, has written a first novel as obscure as its title. Told in the first person, it traces the declining psychic fortunes of a 17-year-old German who joins the SS in late 1944 and winds up fighting in the Battle of the Bulge. Sebastian Westland, the sullen, uncommunicative protagonist, signs on out of boredom rather than conviction. Once in uniform, he encounters not enthusiastic sadism but dispirited loutishness, an idle cruelty that soon infects new recruits. (We suspect something bad is happening to Sebastian's character when he nonchalantly stabs a pigeon in the park on his first leave home.) There is a calculated luridness, a straining for effect, both in Mr. Watkins's choice of subject and his prose: he favors off-kilter sensory effects with lots of non sequiturs and line spaces intended to resonate with deeper meanings. Mr. Watkins seems to do better when he sheds the heavy burden of thought, and the final hundred pages of the novel, when Sebastian receives his baptism by fire, include some splendid battle scenes. But, in the end, history gets short shrift in ''Night Over Day Over Night,'' despite all the fussy details about uniforms and weapons. At no point does it seem dramatically necessary for Sebastian to be in Germany in 1944. A rebel without a cause, he seems to have stumbled onto the wrong movie set.",1988-07-03T05:00:00+0000

According to the official rate imposed on tourists, whereby the ruble is worth almost as much as the British pound, 5 kopecks would equal about 8 U.S. cents. According to the ruble's real value, demonstrated by black market money changers - about the same as the French franc - 5 kopecks would represent at most about a penny.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"BEFORE THE FLAMES: A Quest for the History of Arab Americans. By Gregory Orfalea. (University of Texas, $22.50.) When the journalist Gregory Orfalea began this encyclopedic history of a century of Arab-American immigrants in the United States, his was a personal quest for ethnic identity. Curious to know more about his fellow Arab-Americans, as well as disturbed by the absence of a visible Arab-American community, Mr. Orfalea embarked on a series of interviews, traveling to more than 20 American cities, where he talked with Arab-Americans from all walks of life. The result is a composite portrait of three waves of mostly Syrian and Lebanese immigrants, broken up by a series of in-depth profiles of prominent Arab-Americans, among them Danny Thomas, the diplomat Philip Habib and Edward Said, the literary critic and Middle East specialist. Though Mr. Orfalea has clearly done exhaustive research, his focus is at times overwhelmed by the bulk of material he has amassed. Also, while his lyrical style works well when he is telling stories, it is less effective when he attempts an exegesis of his findings. Part of the problem, as Mr. Orfalea suggests, is the elusiveness of the Arab-American community. He repeatedly observes that most Arab-Americans shrink from identifying themselves as an ethnic entity, preferring assimilation to organizing politically for Arab or Palestinian causes, but he never successfully analyzes why this is so. Instead, he ends this book in much the same way that he begins. Arab-Americans are ''exceptionally individual'' yet ''collectively anonymous,'' he says, a paradoxical conclusion that leaves him with his central question unanswered. Who are Arab-Americans?",1988-07-03T05:00:00+0000

Baseball has its magic numbers: 2,130 (the number of consecutive games that Lou Gehrig played in over the course of 14 years), 511 (the number of career pitching victories racked up by Cy Young) and 56 (the number of consecutive games in which Joe DiMaggio hit safely in 1941). This last feat is lovingly chronicled, game by game, in ''Streak,'' a book New York Yankee fans will admire. Michael Seidel, a professor of literature at Columbia University, faithfully re-creates what life in America was like during that summer before the United States entered World War II. He has interviewed many of the men who played with and against DiMaggio that year and tells just how DiMaggio managed to keep on hitting and hitting. Part of it, of course, was luck, and DiMaggio's ran out in Cleveland on the night of July 17. With the help of some excellent fielding by a third baseman named Ken Keltner, the Cleveland Indians' pitchers Al Smith and Jim Bagby stopped the Yankee Clipper. ''Sportswriter Dave Anderson,'' Mr. Seidel writes, ''pointed out that head shots of Smith and Bagby appeared in newspapers all over the country the next day as if they had assassinated a king.'' Indeed, the author notes that even the Indians' fans were ''deeply conflicted'' during the game: when Smith walked DiMaggio, the crowd booed. And oh yes. As Mr. Seidel reminds us, there was another American League outfielder who tore the cover off the ball that summer before Pearl Harbor.

Over the years, the Archbishop's traditionalists, as they are called, have grown to more than 100,000 worldwide, including more than 220 priests.

us,'How I'll Spend My Summer': Ten Creative Artists Fess Up,"Do creative artists wilt or thrive under the summer sun? Here are reports from 10 of them. Garrison Keillor, humorist: New York's been very good to me this summer - in fact, it's an easy haul here compared to Minnesota, where everything's drying up. My calender is absolutely free - it's like being a kid again, with no commitments except family birthdays and the like. And of course, the week the Minnesota Twins come to play the Yankees. Now I'm just working on what I want, a book, and trying to crack a screenplay. But I am looking forward to going to Denmark at the end of the summer, with its North Atlantic climate and a cold sea that's the test of a man's real character. Malcolm Jamal-Warner, actor: I'm performing in an Off Broadway play, ''Three Ways Home'' in which I play a character very different from Theo Huxtable. This guy is a 16-year-old psycho. Lanford Wilson, playwright: What am I doing this summer? Working in the garden, watching every Mets game, and working on a play - not necessarily in that order. The Mets are first. If they do well, I do well; if they don't, I crawl under a table and sulk. The play was called ''Sympathetic Magic,'' but it's gotten away from me. I look at it now and ask, ''What are you?'' I'm hoping it will tell me by about August. John Lithgow, actor: I love doing Broadway in the summertime. After the Tonys and the so-called end of the season, the tension eases and we can rest on our laurels - and the show [ ''M. Butterfly'' ] is better than it's ever been. My performance is more focused after I can ride my bicycle to the theater or have a picnic in the park with my kids. And then there's the lovely sort of outdoorsy feel to the entire theater district. I'm happy to be working straight through to the fall, and then I'll enjoy a summer vacation. Spike Lee, film maker: In a week I start shooting a movie in Bedford-Stuyvesant Point. It's gonna be hot, but that's what I need - ''Do the Right Thing'' is about how the heat affects people. I don't have a house in the Hamptons, so the dog days is what I have to work with. But I wouldn't have it any other way. Linda Ellerbee, humorist: I've been working on a mystery novel, and for me it's the hardest writing. The only way it's going to get done is to go lock myself away, and that's just what I'll do when I turn on the answering machine in town and head to my house in the country. Then I'll go sit in the river a while. My idea of a vacation is to plant myself in one place and refuse to look a boarding pass in the eye. Bobby Short, cabaret singer: Ah, summer - it's another busy one. Some day I'll go traveling, to Russia and Scandinavia, but for now it's back to my house in France. Come to think of it, having a house like that is a little like having a wife. But it's relaxing there, unpretentious and calming - although any country house with a pool is bound to draw house guests. Most of all I'm looking forward to working on two books - but I may putter in the kitchen too. I've got a piano in the house, but a finger can afford to take off two months, I think. That way I'll be refreshed in the fall - for a couple of weeks, at any rate. Midori, violinist: Usually I go to music school, but this year I'm taking French and European history at Horace Mann. I don't mind not having a vacation, because I love to study. I like going to Horace Mann because it's so different from the Professional Children's School I go to during the season. I just finished my sophomore year, but at P.C.S. it's hard to make relationships with people: the faces are always different because they're actors and they're always going off on location. I also like Horace Mann because I don't think anybody there even knows I play the violin. It just doesn't matter. Ellen Stewart, theater director: I got the MacArthurFoundation grant some years ago and bought a ruin 10 minutes from Spoleto, Italy. I'm trying to create an artists' residence there. It seems a good way to share the award. Jackie Mason, comic: I'm going to sit in lobbies a lot, because I like air-conditioning. Since they invented lobbies with air-conditioning, a normal sensible person shouldn't go anywhere else, sweat like a pig, age before your time, and pass away just to prove you got a tan.''",1988-07-03T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Lobe, who lives in New York, spent the summer of 1985 living and working at Chesterwood, French's estate, in the popular 19th-century artist's former studio. Like Mr. Lobe, many creative artists - painters, dancers, writers, sculptors, composers - spend their summers deeply immersed in the creative process. Taking advantage of residency programs in scenic, secluded locations, they are able to work without the distractions that seem part and parcel of daily life. This summer some are working away at their art in studios near the sea in Montauk, on Long Island's eastern tip; others can be found deep in the woods of New Hampshire, in the resort town of Saratoga Springs, and in Giverny, in France, in the midst of the legendary gardens of the Impressionist Claude Monet.",1988-07-03T05:00:00+0000

Elliott, who started 38th in the 42-car field, did not lead until 23 laps from the end of the 400-mile, 160-lap race. Once he got his Ford Thunderbird in front, however, he kept it there, beating Wilson's Oldsmobile Cutlass by less than the length of his hood. Elliott averaged 163.302 miles per hour as he earned the winner's share of $63,500 from a purse of $549,020. To get his first Firecracker victory, Elliott came from farther back than any winner in the 30 years that the race has been run.

us,The Where and Ware of Hagi,"JAPANESE connoisseurs have an old saying: ''One, Raku; two, Hagi; three, Karatsu.'' They have long ranked the most precious ceramic wares made for the tea ceremony in this order. The charms of Hagi ware's rough clay and rich, pockmarked surfaces, laced with cracks in the glaze, take on character and deeper tones with age and use. Its blushing, soft reddish and creamy white glazes, displaying the voluptuous warmth of living flesh, are often described in feminine terms. (Raku, known for the assymetrical, hand-built, low-fired tea bowls in a bold, direct and ''masculine'' style, is said to have been originated by Japan's most famous tea master, Sen no Rikyu, who died in 1591. Karatsu ware transmits a tradition, originally Korean, of freehand painting in dark-brown underglaze iron on a sandy-brown body.) Before you set out to see today's Hagi-yaki (Hagi ware) in and around this port city about 60 miles west of Hiroshima, you should first look at some Old Hagi ware (defined as pre-1770) and the Korean rice bowls that formed the base of its tradition. A good place to do this is at the Ishii Chawan Bijutsukan (Ishii Tea Bowl Museum) in the Minami Furuhagi-machi section (open from 9 to 11:30 A.M. and 1 to 5 P.M.; closed Tuesday and the month of January; admission about $2.40; telephone 2-1211).

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"SHORT SEASON: And Other Stories. By Jerry Klinkowitz. (Johns Hopkins University, $16.95.) These 28 stories by Jerry Klinkowitz - who is the executive director of the Waterloo (Iowa) Indians baseball team when he isn't teaching English at the University of Northern Iowa - span a single season with the youthful, cheerful, league-leading Mason City Royals, a make-believe Class A farm club of the Kansas City Royals. The journey progresses as a series of snapshots of the players and their support staff. ''Baseball Bingo,'' for example, describes a lonely public-address announcer's yearning for the pretty girls in the stands; ''Nicknames'' introduces a sluggish infielder who is rumored to eat cats; ''The Swoon Wagon'' stars an ancient pitching coach who perpetuates the illegal art of doctoring baseballs. But like a ballgame itself, this book's most vivid stories are interspersed with dull stretches of banal play-by-play. In addition, the first six pieces are so jammed with quickly sketched characters that even the most dutiful reader can't sort them out. When the tales narrow their focus, some appealing personalities emerge. But other stories merely serve to round out the lineup. Perhaps the most irksome feature of this collection is its tolerance of unfinished business. Good stories are built around a team bus driver's dangerous fondness for drink, a teen-age ball shagger's crush on a shortstop, a pitcher's theft of a Mercedes-Benz. However, the bus driver and the teen-ager quickly vanish, and the pitcher is never held accountable for the stolen car.

According to the Center for Defense Information in Washington, a private group that monitors military matters, about 475 commercial vessels have been attacked in the gulf by Iranian or Iraqi forces since 1984. Nov. 1, 1986: Kuwait informs fellow members of the Gulf Cooperation Council that it will seek international protection for its ships in the Persian Gulf, which had become targets in the Iran-Iraq war. Jan. 13, 1987: The United States learns that Kuwait has an offer of protection from the Soviet Union.

Jan. 29: The Reagan Administration reiterates its commitment to a free flow of shipping through the gulf and says Kuwait may re-register its vessels. March 7: The United States offers to protect 11 Kuwaiti tankers. March 14: American intelligence says Iran has installed anti-ship missiles near the Strait of Hormuz. April 2: Kuwait formally accepts the American offer, applies to re-register 11 tankers and limits the Soviet role, asking only to charter three Soviet tankers. April 4: Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger orders a stronger Navy presence in the gulf. May 11: Iran attacks a third Kuwait-bound tanker in eight days and warns Kuwait not to seek American or Soviet protection. May 17: The American frigate Stark is struck by two Iraqi missiles, killing 37 crew members. Iraq apologizes for ''pilot error.'' June 16: The Pentagon tells Congress that naval escorts operate under hair-trigger rules of engagement. Iran is said to be laying mines. July 1: American units reportedly find a dozen mines in gulf shipping lanes. July 24: In the first American convoy operation, one of two American-escorted Kuwaiti tankers hits a mine. Aug. 8: A United States Navy F-14 fires two missiles at an Iranian F-4 but misses. The second American-escorted convoy enters the gulf. Aug. 10: An American-owned supertanker is damaged by mines just outside the gulf. Aug. 11: More mines are discovered. Britain and France announce they will send minesweepers. Aug. 15: A tanker-tender at the entrance to the gulf is sunk by a mine.

To add a little more challenge, the rhythms are usually in odd meters and the tunes are dissonant and asymmetrical. On the band's new album, ''Sine Die,'' each song is edited to the length of a pop tune, and the results are smart and slinky.

''The bottom line is effectiveness,'' General Manager John Schuerholz said. ''It was purely and simply a baseball decision. His effectiveness was just not what it had been, for whatever reason.'' The relief pitcher was not available for comment. His lack of use and unhappiness had fueled speculation for almost a year that the Royals would either trade or release the right-hander, whose 238 saves rank fourth on the major league career list. ''He told me, 'Thanks for showing mercy,' '' Schuerholz said. The Royals also released the reliever Gene Garber, 40 years old, who has 218 career saves, most of them with the Atlanta Braves. Quisenberry signed his lifetime contract early in the 1985 season at the urging of the co-owner, Avron Fogelman, who put the package together and also signed the center fielder, Willie Wilson, and the first baseman, George Brett, to similar deals. The total worth of the contract has been estimated as high as $49 million, depending on the value of future real estate and commercial holdings. Quisenberry, 35 years old, is 0-1 with one save and a 3.55 earned run average. Lifetime, he has a 51-43 record with 238 saves and a 2.55 e.r.a. He set a major league record in 1983, when he saved 43 games. He was named relief pitcher of the year five times, beginning in 1980. (AP)",1988-07-05T05:00:00+0000

January 1981: As Counselor to the President, Mr. Meese shared the White House inner circle with James A. Baker 3d and Michael K. Deaver. April 1984: Senate investigators began looking into Mr. Meese's failure to report reimbursements he received for more than 30 trips he took as White House Counselor. One day later, former President Ford suggested that Mr. Meese should resign, although Mr. Ford said he did not believe Mr. Meese had broken any laws. January 1985: The Office of Government Ethics staff concluded that Mr. Meese, then Attorney General-designate, violated conflict-of-interest rules but was overruled by the agency director. February 1985: Mr. Meese was sworn in as Attorney General. April 1985: Mr. Meese presided at meetings of the Domestic Policy Council, consisting of eight Cabinet officers who advise the President on domestic and social policy issues; Mr. Reagan created the body less than two months after Mr. Meese became Attorney General. July 1986: The final report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography tied hard-core smut to sex crimes and included get-tough recommendations for all levels of government. November 1986: Mr. Meese announced that the United States had secretly sold weapons to Iran and that profits of $10 million to $30 million had been diverted to the Nicaraguan rebels. December 1986: Mr. Meese emerged as a leading spokesman for Mr. Reagan's conservative agenda, including attacks on pornography, crime and narcotics; he spearheaded opposition to abortion and what Reagan supporters considered overly broad Supreme Court decisions. April 1987: Mr. Meese acknowledged that he intervened on behalf of the Wedtech Corp., a defense contractor, in the company's effort to win an Army contract; he denied any wrongdoing. October 1987: Investigators looking into Mr. Meese's activities as Presidential Counselor widened their inquiry to include his actions in connection with his friend E. Robert Wallach's efforts to secure Government backing for a proposed oil pipeline from Iraq to Jordan. December 1987: A special prosecutor, James C. McKay, said he had insufficient evidence to seek criminal charges against Mr. Meese in the Wedtech case.

So it may not come as a total surprise that the fee requests in the case are adding their own impressive statistics. This month Bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg is reviewing applications by 144 law, investment banking and accounting firms who have asked for $50,556,000 for tens of thousands of hours of work that they say Texaco urgently needed to get through its ordeal. With the exception of a $10 million request for 19 law firms representing individual shareholders, legal insiders expect Judge Schwartzberg to approve most of the requests without controversy. ''I'm not going to tell you that $50 million is not a lot of money,'' said Harold Jones, the Federal bankruptcy trustee who supervised the Texaco case.

The organization, which tries to stabilize prices by buying and selling from a buffer stock, cannot intervene in the cocoa market until the two sides agree on what price range the pact should defend. A world cocoa surplus, aggravated by rising output by nonmembers, including Malaysia and Indonesia, meant this year's purchases failed to prevent prices from falling to their lowest level in nearly six years, commodity dealers said.

The story of that fighting, at places with names engraved in the American memory - Red Beach and the Tenaru River, Matanikau, Lunga Point and Bloody Ridge overlooking Henderson Field - was written by a correspondent who slogged the ridge and jungle with men of the First Marine Division.

Plunging into this densely populated roman a clef by the author of ''The Two Mrs. Grenvilles'' is like coming late to a cocktail party where the socially prominent guests are already in full cry. Although the faces are familiar, there are too many to sort out; at first it's hard to catch the tune, but give it time. All those conversations add up. Threnodies about the right restaurant, decorator, broker, about what's chic and what's not, create an anthropologically fascinating picture of Manhattan's high society in the 1980's. The dialogue is funny and dead-on target, as Dominick Dunne makes it clear that Americans are not as democratic as they pretend. Instructing the millionaire social climber Elias Renthal, Lord Biedermeier details ''the little signals by which people like us recognize each other.'' While her socially accepted but ambivalent friend Gus Bailey plans murder, the attentive arriviste Ruby Renthal hones her accent and plans the ultimate society ball. Meanwhile, Justine Altemus marries beneath her, prompting the self-protective savagery of her mother, Lil, who is also busy ignoring the fact that Justine's brother is dying of AIDS. Events build to the night of the ball, one of the best and funniest social events of the literary decade. Investigated by the S.E.C., Elias has the illusion that he will be protected just because he's been admitted to Manhattan's most exclusive club. (''People like that,'' he says, ''are not about to let anything happen to me.'') But he fails to understand that he's mistaken his position. Engaging us in his characters' concerns and then pulling multiple story strands into a tight knot, Dominick Dunne demonstrates with wit and accuracy the delicate, merciless distinction between ''people like that'' and ''people like us.''",1988-07-10T05:00:00+0000

''Never enough!'' was a favorite maxim of Perry Ellis's, according to Jonathan Moor, whose prosaic biography of the talented sportswear designer begins by describing the memorial service that followed Ellis's death from AIDS two years ago at the age of 46. The adage can also apply to the author, who never provides enough fresh information and insights to create a satisfying portrait of his subject. He focuses instead on Ellis's business, which grew from an inexpensive sportswear line into a multimillion-dollar fashion empire. Ellis majored in business in college and had a master's degree in retailing. He never studied design and relied on his staff to translate his ideas into cloth. He was skilled, however, in dealing with the press, going so far, Mr. Moor says, as to bestow ''whole collections of clothes for a particular season, lavish foreign vacations, or even monetary 'consulting' fees'' upon ''certain key editors.'' The author, who has written for GQ and Vogue, offers few glimpses into the personal life of the genteel, Virginia-born designer. He explains why Ellis fathered a child while living with his longtime companion, Laughlin Barker, by saying, ''Perry was more attracted to men (though he would always be drawn to women and most likely wanted to lead a 'normal' life).'' How a complex, gifted, intensely private man from a well-to-do Southern family became a Seventh Avenue superstar is a fascinating story.

Peter Nye has written a sumptuously detailed account of American bicycle racing, emphasizing the early years when cycling was a big-money sport. Drawing principally on newspaper accounts, Mr. Nye chronicles the amazing feats of competitors such as Charles (Mile-a-Minute) Murphy, who in 1899 covered a mile in 57.8 seconds riding through the slipstream of a Long Island Rail Road locomotive. The prosperity that American cycling enjoyed through the 1920's began to diminish during the Depression. To this day the glory has not been recaptured, but the money has - at least for the few superstars who now command endorsements and contracts with teams in the United States and Europe. ''Hearts of Lions'' concludes appropriately with Greg LeMond's 1986 victory - the first by an American - in the Tour de France, the world's most prestigious bicycle race. (Last month Andy Hampsten became the first American to win the Tour of Italy, the second most important race.) LeMond's momentous achievement would seem deserving of more depth than Mr. Nye's summary gives it. Also, we get a feel for the riders but not enough of their riding, which in strength and strategy is the equal of any sport. Perhaps Mr. Nye, a competitor himself, takes that for granted. After his Tour de France triumph, LeMond was invited to the White House. It was an ironic gesture, given that he still is not well known in this country and competitive cycling is largely unrecognized by the press and the public. ''Hearts of Lions'' is welcome as a loving tribute to those athletes who race bicycles for a living. It shows they deserve better.",1988-07-10T05:00:00+0000

WORLD'S END, by T. Coraghessan Boyle. (Penguin, $8.95.) In his earlier books of fiction (including ''Greasy Lake'' and ''Descent of Man''), T.

In 1987, Benjamin DeMott said here that this novel about three families in the Hudson River Valley and the ghosts that haunt them is an uplifting surprise. ''Passion, need and belief breathe with striking force and freedom,'' he wrote.

Translated by Ralph Manheim. (Collier/Macmillan, $8.95.) The Austrian novelist Peter Handke is known for his fictional meditations on the uneasy relationship between language and reality. These three interrelated stories are ''the work of a totally serious major artist,'' Malcolm Bradbury said here in 1985. ''He believes in writing as an artistic and philosophical inquiry, a search into forms.'' UNDERSTANDING TOSCANINI: How He Became an American Culture-God and Helped Create a New Audience for Old Music, by Joseph Horowitz. (University of Minnesota, $12.95.) The cult of Toscanini has had a stultifying effect on American culture, Joseph Horowitz believes, leading to the mass-marketing and packaging of classical music. Last year, our reviewer, Edward W. Said, insisted that the conductor's greatness defied too schematic an analysis but said that the author's ''considerable labors to illuminate aspects of Toscanini's effect on American society are impressive.'' QUEST, by Richard Ben Sapir. (Onyx/New American Library, $4.50.) When a mysterious jewel-encrusted object shows up on the Manhattan art market, the quest for the Holy Grail begins anew. ''It took imagination backed by a great deal of solid research to put this melange together,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year. THE LIFE IT BRINGS: One Physicist's Beginnings, by Jeremy Bernstein. (Penguin, $7.95.) When this account of how the science writer Jeremy Bernstein decided to become a physicist was published last year, our reviewer, David G. Stork, said it was written ''with clarity, grace and a personal candor rare in scientific autobiographies. We feel the presence of an honest mind.'' REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, by Hubert Selby Jr. (Thunder's Mouth Press, $9.95.) For Harry Goldfarb and Tyrone C. Love, the American dream is saving enough money to buy a pound of pure heroin; Harry's mother, Sara, hopes to make her killing as a contestant on a television game show. This novel by the author of ''Last Exit to Brooklyn'' is ''extreme and often silly,'' Jerome Charyn said here in 1978, ''but it has its own magic turmoil and mad power.'' THE LEGACY OF CONQUEST: The Unbroken Past of the American West, by Patricia Nelson Limerick. (Norton, $9.95.) The American West of today is not fundamentally different from the way it was in the 19th century, the author argues. Last year, Annette Kolodny said here that the book ''offers an eminently readable historical overview, punctuated by anecdotes in which the present and the past repeatedly intertwine.'' A SIGN OF THE EIGHTIES, by Gail Parent. (Jove, $4.50.) Shelly Silver, a prosperous New York City caterer, plots to get Mickey Burke, a television writer, to marry her, but he's more interested in his secretary, Astra Rainbow Blakely. ''In this bittersweet comic novel, Gail Parent displays her knack for transforming social trends into fiction,'' Diane Cole said here in 1987. ON GLORY ROADS: A Pilgrim's Book About Pilgrimage, by Eleanor Munro. (Thames and Hudson, $10.95.) Setting out to re-enact the pilgrimages in which Hindus, Buddhists, Jews and Christians celebrate the holy islands of our material world, Eleanor Munro asks, ''Reader, will you follow me, now, as I read the scriptures by my own candle?'' ''Anyone opening this unusual book, which throws such a learned and enchanting light, will reply, why not?'' our reviewer, Ronald Blythe, replied last year. GONE TO SOLDIERS, by Marge Piercy. (Fawcett, $4.95.) Marge Piercy's best-selling novel about World War II concentrates on civilians, some of whom worked for the French underground. ''The battlefront is not all blood and guts,'' Hilma Wolitzer said here last year. ''There is also the grief of separation from family and the mitigating solace of friendship.''",1988-07-10T05:00:00+0000

But another decision may have been the more important: not to allow the purity of the imposed grid to erase the earlier footprint of a meandering Broadway, despite the irregular, ungainly, but ever-memorable (and oxymoronic) triangular squares that would one day brilliantly punctuate the grid's monotonous regularity - a kind of landmarks preservation before there were many landmarks.",1988-07-10T05:00:00+0000
us,SASSY SPANIARDS,"Pedro del Hierro, Nacho Ruiz, Adolfo Dominguez - their names don't slide off the tongue as easily as, say, Armani or Calvin Klein. But they are some of Spain's new fashion-makers, an expanding constellation of designers who showed their collections for fall l988 in Barcelona and Madrid earlier this year. It is too soon to say which of them will emerge as world-class talents, but it seems safe to predict that a few, at least, will have an impact reaching well beyond their borders. Some, including Sybilla, who also shows in Milan, have made the breakthrough already. Her sculptural designs have been showcased by influential Manhattan stores, and her success may have helped to pave the way for others. Working in disparate styles, designers like Dominguez and del Hierro show dramatic clothes that flamboyantly allude to their country's cultural heritage. Goya-esque beauties in lace and velvet and gypsies in swirling skirts are some of the models for their looks. Others, like Trafico de Modas, espouse a more understated style. But even they occasionally offer the sort of hot, sassy looks that have helped to make Spain a stop on the international fashion circuit.",1988-07-10T05:00:00+0000

The moment was full of exultation. Hope and confidence in the future prevailed. The principles of 1789, the rights of man and citizen and the concept of constitutional law, seemed finally to have been embodied in government. An Exposition Universelle was held, attracting more than 25 million paying entrants, whose centerpiece was Gustave Eiffel's extraordinary tower, in itself an awesome symbol of the belief in the perfectibility of man through reason, science and democracy.",1988-07-10T05:00:00+0000

There is no need for an interpreter. Since their schedule is overburdened (the meeting's purpose is to smooth out the numerous ideological differences that had accumulated during the Yugoslav ''schism''), little time remains for ancillary matters. However, taking advantage of a moment of good humor on the part of the master of the revels (Khrushchev), Tito proffers him, from across the table, as one proffers a menu to a diner, the list of dead souls. The scene is Gogolian. ''Here, this is the list of our hundred and thirteen former officials who were in the Soviet Union. What became of them?'' Khrushchev glances at the list of dead souls, then hands it to an aide. ''I will answer you in two days.'' Exactly two days later, at the point in a meeting when drinks and cigars have replaced the official conversation, Khrushchev announces suddenly, point-blank, while drumming on a piece of paper with his pudgy fingers: ''Tochno sto nyetu'' (''Exactly one hundred are no longer of this world'').",1988-07-10T05:00:00+0000

Be grateful for modest efforts.

Page A1 Washington expelled 8 Nicaraguans in retaliation for the expulsion of the U.S. Ambassador and seven other American diplomats. The Nicaraguan Ambassador was told to leave the United States in 72 hours. A6 Panama is boycotting a canal agency that manages and operates the Panama Canal, the State Department said. The four Panamanian directors will not attend a meeting of the Panama Canal Commission. A8 Mexican opposition parties retreated from threats to take to the streets to press their allegations of vote rigging. They appear deliberately not to be capitalizing on popular dissatisfaction with the elections. A3 Britain's arms deal with the Saudis was both a strategic and economic coup for the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It bolstered British influence in the Persian Gulf and created jobs at home. A3 American warships do not monitor civilian air traffic control channels routinely and have not been ordered to do so even since a Navy warship shot down an Iranian passenger jet, Navy officers said. A7 Debate on downing of Airbus is put off by Security Council A7 Afghan guerrillas have been stalled and have suffered some setbacks in their campaign to topple the Government as a result of Soviet and Afghan retaliatory attacks on positions captured by the insurgents. A10 A black South African woman whose daughter was sentenced to death for her role in the killing of a township official fears that her daughter, the only woman among the Sharpeville Six, and the others will not be spared.

A1 Computers for tracking Medicare purchases will be given to the nation's 52,000 pharmacies as part of a Federal plan to protect Medicare recipients against the expenses of catastrophic illness. A1 Dick Thornburgh was named to be Attorney General, and lawmakers predicted quick confirmation by the Senate. In picking Mr. Thornburgh, President Reagan rejected advice from Edwin Meese 3d. A14 A 29 percent drop in the corn harvest, to 5.2 billion bushels, was predicted in a Government report on the effects of the drought. The loss of 2.1 billion bushels was the most extensive ever foreseen this early in the season. D1 Politics A15-17 Michael Dukakis chose a Texan, Lloyd Bentsen, as his running mate. Mr. Dukakis is counting on Senator Bentsen, a conservative, to draw votes away from Vice President Bush in the South. A1 Man in the news: Lloyd Bentsen has more in common with George Bush than with Michael Dukakis. Mr. Bent-sen agrees with the Reagan Administration's economic policies and some of its political programs. A1 Jesse Jackson reacted to the choice of Lloyd Bentsen as Michael Dukakis's running mate by refusing to embrace or condemn the prospective ticket. He said he would support the ultimate Democratic nominees. A1 News analysis: Mr. Dukakis took a series of gambles in selecting Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate, hoping the Texas Senator will help him raise money and win votes in the South and among conservative Democrats.

The jacket-over-the-shoulder look seems to be the favorite; it may also be the most macho (especially if the other hand is used to tote a gym bag or attache case). The more serious-looking gentlemen seem to prefer their jackets carried over the arm, with somewhat less derring-do, but equally effective in beating the heat. Most serious of all are the die-hards who, regardless of heat and polyester blends, refrain from removing their jackets (double-breasted, yet). Nor do they loosen or lower their neckties, a bit of relaxation that, along with open shirt collars, is another sure sign that humidity is high. Ties bestow a business touch to those sweltering fellows who go jacketless and wear short-sleeved shirts.

I have been thinking, reluctantly, of the times when I've been homesick because each morning I send a child off to day camp who is wrestling unsuccessfully with his first bout of it. He does not yet have the word, although it is mentioned in the book in which Big Bird goes off to the beach to visit Granny and feels so terrible he cannot eat his birdseed pancakes.

The toilet bowl seems to have a permanent ring around it at the water line. Scrubbing with most household cleansers does not seem to help. Are there any suggestions you can offer? A. One cleanser that often works well on such stains is a product called Zud. It is sold in supermarkets, hardware stores and some plumbing supply outlets. If this fails, you can probably remove the stains with a solution of muriatic acid (sold in hardware stores). Wearing rubber gloves, mix the acid with four parts water in a glass or plastic bowl. Scoop most of the water out of the toilet bowl, then scrub with the solution. Let soak for about five minutes, then flush. Q. When our house was built 12 years ago, old bricks were used instead of new ones to provide a rustic look. But many of these bricks absorb too much moisture, so that winter freezing and thawing causes the face of some bricks to crack and fall off. Can these bricks be repaired, and can they be sealed to prevent further damage? A. When bricks flake off in the manner you describe, the most common cause is moisture getting in through defective or missing mortar, not through the bricks themselves. So the first cure is usually a tuck pointing job - raking out the defective mortar and replacing it with fresh mortar.",1988-07-14T05:00:00+0000

The May figure fell about midway between the revised April deficit and the March deficit, suggesting that the deficit may be temporarily on a plateau. Page 1 Ending trade barriers in West Euorpe by late 1992, once regarded as a utopian concept, is increasingly perceived as an unstoppable process. Opposition to the idea is fading, even in Britain and Denmark. 1 Curbs on Chinese sales of missiles in the Middle East were sought by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, but he said that China's leaders gave him no assurances. Chinese officials defended the sales. 1 New blood in Taiwan's ruling party has made its way to the top policy making board. For the first time, as President Lee Teng-hui replaced 12 of the 31 members, a majority of its members are natives of Taiwan. 4 Criticism of Mexican news coverage of elections is not rare among the political opposition, but after the slanted reporting on this year's election, a nonpartisan citizen's group has joined in the criticism. 6 El Norte is a rare Mexican daily, independent and willing to challenge the official line. Although it is often criticized, it has a loyal readership and is respected even by those it takes to task. 6 The Nicaraguan Ambassador left the United States. Carlos Tunnerman complied with the order issued by the Reagan Administration in retaliation for the ouster of the American Ambassador in Managua. 3 Cuba will not withdraw its troops in Angola until after South Africa begins to carry out a stalled United Nations plan for independence in Namibia, the chief Cuban negotiator on the Angolan conflict said. 3 Kenya fired up a steam locamotive, the Mount Shengena, to commemorate the first decade of its independent rail corporation. Starting in October, the locamotive will make a 70-mile run twice a week. 4 Reagan urges changes at U.N. before U.S. pays dues 2 Soviets urge U.S. pullout from Persian Gulf 2 Gorbachev opens Warsaw Pact meeting 3 Six Soviet soldiers skeptical of Moscow's offer of amnesty 6 National 7-10, 28, 52 A new teamsters' president was elected. He is William McCarthy, among those whom the Justice Department named as defendants in a suit charging that the union's leadership failed to root out corruption. 1 Man in the news: William McCarthy, the new Teamsters president, is known in New England, where he has been a union officer for 40 years, for hard bargaining and honoring a contract once it has been accepted. 52 Membership in self-help groups is growing rapidly. In North America, it has grown to 12 million to 15 million, from 5 million to 8 million in 1976. The movement has become worldwide. 1 A Boeing 737 accident in Hawaii last April in which part of the plane's fuselage was blown off probably occurred because pressurization inside the cabin caused tiny cracks to expand suddenly, a Government expert said. 7 Three white lawmen were acquitted by a jury on charges of civil rights violations in the alleged beating death of a black jail inmate who died two days after his arrest in Hemphill, Texas, Christmas night. 7 Producer prices rose in June by four-tenths of 1 percent for finished goods, according to Government statistics. Inflation pressures continued to mount but remained concentrated in the early stages of production, the figures showed. 35 Politics 8-10 Jesse Jackson's expectations include integrating members of his campaign staff with Michael S. Dukakis's, a plane for the fall campaign and access to a President Dukakis, according to Mr. Jackson's aides. 1 Jimmy Carter sidestepped a dispute between Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, saying that he was not the person to mediate it. He said the dispute stemmed from Mr. Dukakis's lack of involvement with blacks. 8 Black politicians in Atlanta, a majority in the city's political establishment, wonder when they will succeed in races for major statewide offices. Mayor Andrew Young is considering a run for the governorship. 9 Atlanta is turning on its charm for the Democratic National Convention. The host committee for the convention has enlisted more than 6,000 volunteers and plans 200 parties. 9 Reporter's Notebook: On the road with Jackson 8 Networks' shrinking coverage of conventions 9 Regional 29-32 Roosevelt Raceway is closing. The owner of the Westbury. L.I., harness track said poor attendence forced the action. Officials said the owner wanted the $200 million in profit from selling the site. 1 Three Howard Beach defendants were convicted of misdemeanor riot charges but acquitted of felony riot charges stemming from a racial attack on three black men in the Queens neighborhood. 29 Researchers are collecting clouds on top of Whiteface Mountain in upstate New York as part of an expanding national effort to learn whether acid precipitation is harming forests as well as lakes. 29 New York's Legislature suspended its 1988 session for an indefinite period after failing to break a deadlock on several important issues. The Legislature's action was a serious setback for Governor Cuomo. 29 Howard Golden attacks Mayor Koch for New York City's problems. Some say that the Brooklyn Borough President is quick to criticize the Mayor because he aspires to become mayor. Theirs is a longstanding feud. 29 The Bronx prosecutor broke no laws, the special state prosecutor reported.

Mikhail Heller, a Soviet emigre and author who has lived in Paris since 1969, has produced a textbook for the school of thought that depicts the Soviet Union as a great machine. Chapter by didactic chapter, he lays out the ideology and methods whereby, in his view, the Soviet citizen is denatured, beguiled, infantilized and frightened into becoming little more than a willing cog. ''Homo sovieticus,'' a new type of human being, is here, or almost here. Mr. Heller scoffs at those in the West who say that the Soviet Communists' vaunted engineering of souls has never been that consistent or that successful, and that the trend since Stalin's time has been away from the Great Leader's totalitarian utopia. The book was originally published in Paris in a French translation three years ago (this edition is anonymously translated from the French), before the rise of glasnost and perestroika, and the author supplies a new introduction dismissing these phenomena as variations on an old theme. Yet every week brings new headlines from the Soviet Union that seem to undercut his argument that essentially nothing has changed. All the same, Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms would not be having such hard going if it weren't for the Orwellian elements wedded to the Soviet system from its beginnings, and Mr. Heller's morose examination of this debasement of Soviet life provides valuable insight into what, to a large extent, the Soviet Union still is.",1988-07-17T05:00:00+0000

His primary achievement is the alternating sequence of internal and external spaces experienced by the visitor as he moves up between ramps, ramparts, staircases and rooms that appear to be hewn from rock.''

Some of the disdain for welfare comes from misunderstanding. Only one-quarter of those who ever use welfare actually do so for 10 or more years, although long-term users are a much larger fraction of those found on the rolls at any point; short-term users move off quickly and long-term users tend to accumulate.

Mr. Goldberg, co-author of ''Flowers in the Blood: The Story of Opium,'' provides just enough heft to keep the summer reading list respectable, and what with the passions of scientific privacy, some test tube nitty-gritty, the mystery of the brain, little guys versus big guys and millions of dollars at stake, the book moves right along. In the end, the little guys - an unlikely team of John Hughes, a cockney who went to Yale, and Hans Kosterlitz, a cranky and quite solid German Jewish refugee, working out of a derelict university laboratory in Aberdeen, Scotland, an oil boom town - are the winners. Among the losers are Avram Goldstein, an exquisitely intelligent research and grants master at Stanford's superb labs, and crack groups from Johns Hopkins, among other universities, and Eli Lilly, among other pharmaceutical companies. Sort of winners, that is. The men from Aberdeen beat out the competition in discovering morphinelike chemicals in the brain and, in 1975, announcing they had.

Basically, ''Ambush at Osirak'' is about hardware, the kind of hardware that kills - offensive weapons with cute names like Sidewinder and good-neighbor names like SAM. Herbert Crowder sets this novel of political intrigue and suspense in the Middle East. Iran is at war with Iraq. Iraq is at war with Israel. Israel is at war with just about every neighboring Arab country and, at times, even itself. Osirak, just outside Baghdad, is the site of a nuclear plant, the ''atomic weapons arsenal for the forces of Islam in their sworn campaign to purge Israel from the face of the earth.'' Years earlier, Israel had devastated Osirak in a pre-emptive air strike, putting the Iraqi end of the arms race on hold. Now, with Russian aid, Iraq is back in the game and Israel plans an encore. This time, however, Iraq is ready. Dropped into this scenario is David Llewellyn, handpicked by the President of the United States to be the No. 2 man in the American Embassy in Jerusalem. There's a mole loose and Llewellyn is to ferret it out, thus saving the world from a nuclear holocaust. There's more, of course, including attempts by both the Russians and the Americans to topple Israel's government, and even a little romance between Llewellyn and a stunning Israeli spy. But most of all there's that hardware. In fact, the most successful parts of this first novel are those in which Mr. Crowder, a former missile radar engineer, shares his technical knowledge of weaponry. Unfortunately, although he writes smoothly and with a certain flair for detail, his plot and characters never seem as interesting as all those planes and missiles.",1988-07-17T05:00:00+0000

us,DISPATCHES FROM THE RUBBLE,"''How did you find Lebanon?'' Kahlil Gibran wrote to a friend. ''Did you find it as lovely as your imagination and yearning had made it out to be, or did you find it a barren land of complacency?'' Lebanon has always been a land of contradiction, the crossroads of fact and fantasy. Beirut is the biggest contradiction of all: for some, it's tennis at the St. George Hotel in a past of prosperity; for others, it's a widening gyre of gunmen and anarchy. In BEIRUT: City of Regrets (Norton, Cloth, $34.95; Paper, $19.95), Eli Reed and Fouad Ajami present a portrait of the city in photographs and words. Mr. Reed, a photographer for Magnum, arrived in Beirut in the fall of 1983 and spent four and a half months taking pictures of a dying city. In one photo, refugee children from Sabra and Shatila stand above the rubble of a house; by a bullet-chipped cinderblock wall is a cage of parakeets, feathers blue like the sky and yellow like the ruins. The photos can be dramatic and touching, but they are overshadowed by Mr. Ajami's account of the decline and fall of Beirut. Mr. Ajami, a Middle East specialist and author of ''The Vanished Imam,'' acknowledges his debt to the Oxford historian Albert Hourani. But he repays it with a colorful, thoughtful appraisal of some of the thousand and one tales about Lebanon, such as ''the city's great myth - that it was a place where Islam and Christianity met and fashioned a society of compromise.'' In addition to drawing on Gibran, Mark Twain and many others who have written of Lebanon, Mr. Ajami weaves in the Beirut he saw by streetcar while growing up in the 50's. In the end, he lets the Syrian-born poet Nizzar Qabbani write the city's epitaph: ''Nothing remains of old Beirut except the scent of it that blows from old notebooks.''",1988-07-17T05:00:00+0000

Vogt Jr. (Travel, April 24), which recently came to my attention: The tendency to refer in English to the Yucatan is perfectly normal and correct. Just as we say the Ukraine, the Bronx, the Yukon, we say the Yucatan. Spanish usage has no bearing on it. The writer implies that North American usage is somehow ignorant or disrespectful of the local form. In fact, different languages have different rules. The French are not mistaken in calling Mexico Le Mexique, in accordance with French rules for use of the article with names of countries, although, in Spanish, the country is called Mejico, with no article. More such examples could be quoted, but the point is that usage in the local language does not set down rules for usage in foreign languages.

The questions are not easy. Can enough motorists be persuaded to make the change to mass transit to keep the system from congealing around those who must drive?

The mingled anger and longing of an expatriate seeking to come to terms with his homeland inform every page of this fierce, vivid first novel by Abdulrazak Gurnah, a Tanzanian-born writer who now teaches at the University of Kent in England. Set in a bitterly poor, unnamed East African state ruled by a totalitarian regime that is both brutal and hopelessly disorganized, ''Memory of Departure'' is a compelling study of one man's struggle to find a purpose for his life and a haunting portrait of a traditional society collapsing under the weight of poverty and rapid change. Hassan Omar and his family are black Moslems in a country in which religion has ceased to have any importance. His father, a minor civil servant frustrated by his powerlessness, can communicate with his children only by varying the pitch of verbal and physical abuse he hurls at them. After a confrontation with thugs recruited by the regime, Hassan is sent off to a wealthy relative in Kenya. But the community he discovers there is equally ruthless. Devoid even of socialist rhetoric, it has been given over to the relentless pursuit of money and the unthinking embrace of all things Western. Here, Hassan begins to uncover his own values, to invent himself, after falling in love. The affair, and Hassan's eventual fate, are rendered in a poignant and convincing fashion, conveying a young man's bittersweet and quite believable truce with unavoidable circumstances. What lingers in the imagination, though, is Mr. Gurnah's singular portrait of a world spinning out of control: of crushing poverty; sour, hopeless lives; rapacious governments; age-old cultures giving way - and behind it all, the specter of chaos always threatening.",1988-07-17T05:00:00+0000

When John McEvoy, a schoolteacher and family man, discovers he is the basis for a character in a book by a long-forgotten acquaintance, his peace of mind begins to crumble - especially because he's been depicted as an arrogant, thoughtless rogue who had once been responsible for the death of a mutual friend. McEvoy, previously unaware that he had such an unsavory reputation, becomes obsessed with the way he appears to the world, pestering his friends for their opinions of him, evaluating his actions and their consequences over and over again. He starts to wonder, for example, if he is to blame for the creepy, compulsive behavior of his thoroughly awful wife. The more he doubts himself, the more he identifies with the character in the book, and the more he begins to believe he is living out the role (as yet unwritten) that must be that character's destiny. While he's trying to sort this out, he has a most unlikely affair with a wildly eccentric poet named Ruth Prochak, for whose fate he also believes he (or the book's character) is responsible. Jan Mark's engaging premise in her first novel for adults (she has published several books for children in England) is filled with brain-teasing ambiguities and multilayered plot developments. Unfortunately they are not satisfyingly explored. The characters are relentlessly quirky, in some cases merely grab bags of idiosyncrasies rather than fully rendered personalities. At one point, McEvoy's confidante, Geneva, claims she is ''writing a book about a man who's writing a book, but the more he writes, the further he is from finishing it.'' While it's clear the man Geneva is writing about is none other than McEvoy, it's not until she gives away the working title that the reader realizes how elaborate this hall of mirrors actually is.",1988-07-17T05:00:00+0000

The main stylistic imprint on the recordings of today's under-30 English pop stars has been the pop-soul of Motown. But for those in between - musicians like Steve Winwood, Elton John and Robert Palmer - the formative influences are an amalgam of 1960's soul, gospel and Caribbean styles.

This book is a shrewd appraisal of how police officers handle criminal procedure: searches and seizures, arrests, lineups and interrogations. H. Richard Uviller, a onetime prosecutor who now teaches law at Columbia University, spent a sabbatical back on the front line of the criminal justice system - the crime-ridden Ninth Precinct in lower Manhattan. Since the Supreme Court over the past few decades ''had been unabashedly engaging in lawmaking as instruction'' in police practices, he wondered: ''Were the cops awake and responsive at the other end of the pipeline?'' Riding along with members of the precinct's robbery investigation unit, Mr. Uviller sought the answer to this question. Not surprisingly, many officers mistakenly feel the Court has meant to discourage all searches and seizures. They also think they should be able to talk freely with suspects in the squad car, saving Miranda warnings for precinct-house interrogations. But the author found, ultimately, that the rules are working, though police officers can play a very tough game: ''Their notorious efforts to alter the facts to fit the rules are evidence of both the fact that the cops grasp the essence of the Court's message and that they reject its wisdom.'' Mr. Uviller uses anecdotes to show how the law is played out in practice and effectively illustrates street life. (In one telling scene, three teen-age suspects leaf through a book of mug shots as if it were a high school yearbook.) There are no polemics here - only a sober, sympathetic look at modern-day police work.",1988-07-17T05:00:00+0000

In a trade yesterday, the Devils sent Chevrier and their 1989 seventh-round draft choice to Winnipeg for Steve Rooney, a left wing, and a fourth-round draft pick in 1989. The trade should give Chevrier more playing time, because he had fallen behind Sean Burke and Bob Sauve in the goalie numbers game with the Devils. Last season, Chevrier, 27 years old, appeared in 45 games, had one shutout in an 18-19-3 won-lost-tied record and allowed an average of 3.77 goals. He did not play in the Devils' playoff run to the Stanley Cup semifinals. Rooney, 26, scored 7 goals and 6 assists in 56 games last season. He accumulated 217 minutes in the penalty box, and gives the Devils an aggressive wing, as well as adding depth to the forward position. . . . The Rangers have signed Mark Tinordi, a 22-year-old defenseman who split last season between the parent club and their Colorado affiliate International Hockey League.

But Congressional aides said the proposal faces an uphill battle. [ Page A1. ] COMPANIES U.S. regulators accepted a bid for two banking companies by a Minnesota investor. Carl R. Pohlad will put $200 million into a transaction that will merge Texas American of Fort Worth and National Bancshares of San Antonio. [ D1. ] An offer to buy Polaroid was made by Roy E. Disney, who disclosed that his Shamrock Holdings group already held 8 percent of the photography company and was willing to pay $2.3 billion, or $40 a share, for the rest. Polaroid is expected to resist the offer. [ D1. ] Gencorp has reached a regulatory settlement that clears the way for it to sell a Los Angeles television station and a Memphis radio station for about $217.5 million. The accord may be a model to settle disputes dating back to 1965. [ D1. ] An Indian tribe in Maine is selling a cement company for an undisclosed price that is estimated to be more than three times what the tribe paid for the company five years ago. [ D1. ] Pratt & Whitney plans to cut more than 1,000 salaried jobs at its main operations plant in East Hartford, Conn. [ D1. ] Bankers Trust had a strong second quarter, earning $174.1 million, in contrast to a $554 million loss in last year's quarter. First Interstate had quarterly profits of $97.2 million. [ D5. ] A.T.&T.'s profits dipped slightly in the second quarter, to $594 million. GTE's earnings were $299 million, but when special items were excluded the figure was almost the same as last year's $223 million. [ D4. ] Earnings doubled at Dow Chemical in the second quarter, but GAF and Hercules reported lower profits. [ D4. ] G.M.'s two publicly traded subsidiaries posted earnings gains, but G.M.A.C., the financing unit, had a decline. [ D6. ] Airbus has won a contract worth about $1.8 billion (Canadian) to supply 34 airliners to Air Canada. [ D2. ] Eastern Airlines is considering laying off 4,000 workers, about 12 percent of its work force, The Miami Herald reported. [ D2. ] Calmat has tentatively agreed to sell its cement business for at least $310 million to Japan's largest cement maker. [ D4. ] MARKETS A stockbroker at Gruntal & Company was indicted on charges of insider trading and perjury stemming from the 1986 takeover of Waldbaum by the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company. Robert Chestman was accused of using non-public information to generate $250,00 in illegal trading profits. [ D1. ] Grain and soybean markets came under renewed pressure as the July futures contracts expired and the Midwest continued to receive much-needed rainfall. [ D16. ] The dollar rebounded in quiet, but nervous trading. Gold fell $1.70, to $444.80 an ounce. [ D16. ] Stocks reversed two days of declines. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.34 points, to 2,110.60. [ D8. ] The credit markets were sluggish as traders awaited new economic statistics.

[ D7. ] INTERNATIONAL The U.S.-Canada free-trade accord will be blocked in Canada's Senate until voters have passed judgment on the accord, the Liberal Party, which has a majority in the Senate, said. [ A3. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS The fight for Macmillan has produced an unusual twist: a judge has depicted management, rather than the corporate raider, as the greedy and devious party. Talking Deals. [ D2. ] BankAmerica shares have gained 96 percent so far this year, but some enthusiastic analysts say there is more to come. A few analysts are more cautious. Market Place.

us,GUIDEPOST: Keeping Bills at Bay,"Letting bills sit during an extended vacation is risky. Some creditors now impose penalties after 30 days, especially if there is a history of erratic payments. Figure out what bills you'll miss by taking a list of billing-cycle dates for your regular payments; you might also include your account numbers and the addresses and customer-service telephone numbers of the creditors. Ways to take care of bills while on vacation range from simply having a neighbor forward them to you, to using bill-paying services that some banks offer. If you come home to a pile of bills, don't push them aside. METHOD WHAT TO DO Prepayment Call creditors and arrange to pay either your outstanding balance or an average monthly charge. Payment by phone or computer A few banks will pay authorized bills for customers when they call; others offer similar services via portable computers. Third-party payment Provide a relative or friend with signed checks and access to your bills, but make sure to avoid overdrafts.

us,NONFICTION,"BIFURCATED POLITICS: Evolution and Reform in the National Party Convention. By Byron E. Shafer. (Russell Sage Foundation/Harvard University, $27.50.) This is a profound study of the transformation of national party conventions from meetings where Presidential candidates were actually selected (that last happened in 1952) to political theme parks where all kinds of causes, including the Presidential election, compete for a hearing. Byron E. Shafer, a professor of American government at Oxford University, examines how the nationalization of politics has moved the real choice of a nominee out of the convention and into the primaries, and how the convention has become only an insurance policy against political disaster - a ''nominator of last resort.'' He uses the convention as a window on politics in general, showing how it has come to stress communicating with ''organizable publics'' rather than creating ''continuing coalitions among major political actors.''",1988-07-24T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"AT THE HEART OF THE WHITE ROSE: Letters and Diaries of Hans and Sophie Scholl. Edited by Inge Jens. Translated by J. Maxwell Brownjohn. (Harper & Row, $21.95.) The anti-Nazi group known as the White Rose consisted of a small circle of students and a teacher at the University of Munich who in May 1942, when Hitler was still triumphant in the war, secretly began to distribute leaflets denouncing the Nazi regime. Led by Hans Scholl, a medical student and military conscript, along with his sister, Sophie, the White Rose constituted one of the very few anti-Nazi enclaves operating in Germany. (The Scholls and their co-conspirators were beheaded in 1943 after brother and sister were spotted dropping fliers over a school balustrade.) These excerpts from their diaries and letters, edited by the German journalist Inge Jens and capably translated by J. Maxwell Brownjohn, are almost entirely without reference to the group's operations, since any entry might one day have been confiscated. But if this collection lacks drama, it does offer a remarkable record of daily life in Hitler's Germany in all its surreally mundane particulars. We see the Scholls attending concerts, talking of nature and Goethe, even as they risk death. Hans's diaries of German campaigns into Russia and Poland are especially stirring, documenting his tormented compassion for Hitler's victims. What this book makes clear is that the White Rose had no coherent political strategy or much chance of victory. The Scholls' resistance was that of European spiritual humanism at its most sublime - and desperate.",1988-07-24T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"LOOSE CONNECTIONS. By Sybil Claiborne. (Academy Chicago, $16.95.) The connections in Sybil Claiborne's first collection of short stories are loose indeed. Many of the characters have only a tenuous grip on reality; still others inhabit a collapsing world in which a malevolent government, god or military-industrial complex is systematically destroying the populace. In ''The Gulag Computer: Dead Souls in the Terminal,'' a man dies and discovers that he and other deceased men and women have been transmuted into computer chips that will be forced to put together the words of a trashy novel. The circle of elderly friends in ''Last Year at Pittsburgh'' may or may not be imagining a horrible war that has devastated America. The narrator of the title story couples with a C.I.A. man who's selling tiny radios that fit into bodily crevices and monitor conversations. Although one can admire - and sometimes be amused by - Ms. Claiborne's powers of invention, these nightmarish visions seldom disturb or provoke. The development of her characters' personalities is largely missing, and any emotional resonance is lost in the midst of her rambling and often self-consciously jokey prose. Only a few of the 16 stories elicit a real chill. Tellingly, the most successful one, ''Rubble,'' has the most conventional narrative structure. In it, a woman discovers that her eccentric aunt, long considered the destructive member of the family, may have been more victim than victimizer. By concentrating here on substance rather than style, Ms. Claiborne finally makes a connection with the reader's emotions.",1988-07-24T05:00:00+0000

Only a minor point of law prevented the prosecution from total success. Mr. Lehder, who is 38 years old, received life plus 135 years. He was also fined $350,000. Prosecutors believe he was responsible for 80 percent of the Colombian cocaine reaching the United States, much of it shipped through the Bahamas.

Although no one in the United States would seriously argue that we ought to return to the medicine and health care system that existed in the 1940's - and while no one sees this as a golden age, now lost - such a proposition for higher education would not seem at all preposterous to many who complain vociferously about what they perceive to be the fall in standards in America's colleges and universities.",1988-07-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Faces in the Shadows: What Do They Mean?,"The 1876 ''Portrait of Madame Charpentier and Her Children'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is one of Renoir's most familiar paintings. Its Japanese setting is the Parisian town house of Georges and Marguerite Charpentier, patrons of Renoir and influential supporters of the arts. Mme. Charpentier is sitting on a sofa, her feathery right arm soft and protective, her dark dress settling on the floor like a huge wing. Beside her on the sofa is her 3-year-old son, Paul, dressed as a girl, looking sweetly at his 6-year-old sister, Georgette, who is staring dreamily into space as she sits sidesaddle on their Newfoundland dog, a resigned but not altogether willing chariot. What appears to be a conventional portrait is very much like a fairy tale. The mood of fantasy and enchantment is reinforced by secondary images knitted into or rearing up within the fabric of the painting. One is in the curtain at the far right. It is a face suggesting a monstrous outsider grimacing at this scene of grand bourgeois bliss. Another is in the arm of the sofa to the immediate right of the woman. It is feline, and it seems to be resting on the lap of Mme. Charpentier and looking at her: indeed there is an amusing sense that this apparition may be the real subject of the dog's discontent. There are also intimations of nastier images - like skulls - in Mme. Charpentier's dress, which is a world unto itself. Renoir's painting has the gentleness and foreboding of a children's morality tale, and the secondary images help explain why.",1988-07-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Public Enemy: Rap With a Fist in the Air,"In the last decade, rap has become as much a symbol as a musical style. For those who revel in it as well as for those who can't stand it, rap holds all the tensions of urban life - tensions between sexes, generations, races and classes. Its electronic crunch and sonic collages, its jolts and shouts, echo an urban streetscape that some city dwellers want to flaunt or exorcise, others to escape. Beyond an occasional novelty hit, rap is virtually ignored by radio stations because, the programmers maintain, rap alienates older listeners as it draws teen-agers; even stations that call themselves ''urban'' or ''black'' are likely to segregate rap in separate programs, away from the pop songs it often outsells. The teen-ager blasting a rap song from a boom box and the businessman who hears it as an assault on sanity might agree that rap can never be background music; whether it's brandished as virtuosic self-assertion or shunned as rude noise, it makes itself heard.",1988-07-24T05:00:00+0000

He made clear that the era of unrestricted access to American markets was over, and acknowledged that the decade-long strategy for dealing with refugees is not working. Here are some other issues that came up along the way. Japan Although Mr. Shultz praised Japan for stimulating economic growth - thus raising demand for American and other foreign products - there is a realization that the United States and Japan may never have a balanced trade relationship. South Korea The United States is concerned about South Korea's fragile democracy and rising anti-Americanism. Mr. Shultz voiced qualified support for a series of recent proposals by President Roh Tae Woo for interim steps toward reunification with North Korea. China Mr. Shultz failed to win assurances that the Chinese would stop selling long-range ballistic missiles to the Middle East. But the U.S.-China relationship is delicate -each depends on the other as a counterweight to Soviet influence in Asia - and China's cooperation is needed on Cambodia, so Washington is not going to push. Cambodia The United States is encouraged by China's willingness to help reach a settlement that would lead to the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. Hanoi officials and representatives of the four Cambodian factions plan to meet for the first time this week in Jakarta. Philippines The United States hopes that negotiations for an interim agreement for two American military bases can be concluded soon. At issue: the Filipinos want more money.

Black, 30 years old, of Scottsdale, Ariz., made six birdie putts to pull into a tie with Calcavecchia and Brooks at 13-under-par 200.

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE ELIZABETH STORIES, by Isabel Huggan. (King Penguin, $6.95.) Elizabeth is forced to play the only male role in a ballet recital and discovers that her father really wanted her to be a boy. Last year, our reviewer, Ellen Currie, said that in these stories about a Canadian girl's troubled adolescence ''Isabel Huggan is superb at establishing that helpless awareness of capture and duress that is the character of our experience when we are young and have no power because we have no information. [ She ] re-creates for us that sense of outraged acquiescence, the astonished stoicism of the child, the disenfranchised, the mute.'' ANOTHER DAY OF LIFE, by Ryszard Kapuscinski. Translated by William R. Brand and Katarzyna Mroczkowska-Brand. (Penguin, $6.95.) During the mid-1970's the Polish journalist Ryszard Kapuscinski lived in Angola, trying to fathom the civil war that led to the country's still uneasy independence. Last year, William Boyd said here that he liked the book's idiosyncratic touches, such as the account of an open-air cinema, abandoned by its owner, where the pornographic film ''Emmanuelle'' plays over and over, its audience seemingly oblivious to the surrounding war. ''Throughout the book, in the decaying surreal city or the tense journeys through the bush, one senses just how fragile is our sense of order, our idea of a comprehensible world.'' WEEP NO MORE, MY LADY, by Mary Higgins Clark. (Dell, $4.95.) An actress suspects that her Oscar-winning sister was killed by her rich fiance. Last year, our reviewer, Kiki Olson, called this novel ''the ideal book for the beach bag, picnic hamper or carry-on luggage.'' SPYCATCHER: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer, by Peter Wright with Paul Greengrass. (Dell, $4.95.) Banned in Britain by the Official Secrets Act, the memoirs of Peter Wright, a former British intelligence agent, tell of his efforts to smoke out Soviet moles. Last year, Christopher Andrew said here that Paul Greengrass's writing helped make this ''revealing'' book readable but that he feared Mr. Wright was suffering from a bad case of ''conspiracy theory,'' seeing infiltrators where none exist. THE GIRLS: A Story of Village Life, by John Bowen. (Plume/New American Library, $7.95.) When Janet has a baby named Butch, her enraged lesbian lover accidentally kills the father. ''If it were not for its humor, ironic tone and eccentric characters, this well-crafted novel of murder and mystery could be mistaken for an example of feminist-separatist literature,'' Regina Weinreich said in The Book Review last year. GARDENING FOR LOVE: The Market Bulletins, by Elizabeth Lawrence. Edited by Allen Lacy. (Duke University, $9.95.) Elizabeth Lawrence, the celebrated garden writer, died in 1985, leaving behind the chaotic manuscript of what she once had intended as her masterwork. It was edited by Allen Lacy, a professor of philosophy who writes about gardening for The Times, and the result is ''an enchanting work, unlike any other gardening book in existence,'' our reviewer, Stanley Kunitz, said in 1987. A WARMER SEASON, by Joseph Olshan. (Ballantine, $3.95.) After befriending a blue-collar family of Italians, a middle-class Jewish boy learns that it is not always possible to transcend the walls that divide us. Last year, Albert Mobilio said here that the novel is ''well designed and engagingly told. . . . By placing the economic and ethnic tensions in high relief, 'A Warmer Season' becomes a novel about teen-agers of compelling interest to adults.'' WITH LOUIS AND THE DUKE: The Autobiography of a Jazz Clarinetist, by Barney Bigard. Edited by Barry Martyn. (Oxford University, $8.95.) In a series of conversations, the clarinetist Barney Bigard told Barry Martyn, a New Orleans jazz writer, about his years with the bands of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. ''Mr. Bigard talks more of the genius of Mr. Ellington and Louis Armstrong, or the drinking habits of Ben Webster and Jack Teagarden, than he does of his own style,'' Don Palmer said here in 1986. ''He is jocular, critical, cantankerous and mildly irreverent.'' The same publisher has reissued A LIFE IN JAZZ ($9.95), an oral history in which the guitarist Danny Barker tells the critic and musician Alyn Shipton about New York and New Orleans jazz. Last year, one reviewer said this ''anecdotal and chatty'' book would be ''more appreciated by jazz fans than scholars.'' THE NEON RAIN, by James Lee Burke. (Pocket Books, $3.95.) While trying to solve a murder, a New Orleans police lieutenant and jazz buff is framed by the mob and becomes so dispirited that he reverts to alcoholism. James Lee Burke ''writes exceptionally clean, unforced prose that has a pronounced streak of poetry in it,'' Newgate Callendar said here in 1987. ''He obviously knows people and has experienced life.'' BERNSTEIN: A Biography, by Joan Peyser. (Ballantine, $5.95.) This psychobiography of the composer, conductor and pianist Leonard Bernstein is gossipy and disorganized, Leon Botstein said here last year. But he called it ''the first attempt at a critical account of Mr. Bernstein's life and work. . . . [ Joan ] Peyser has managed to convey the magnitude and range of Mr. Bernstein's talent and achievements.'' DEAD BABIES, by Martin Amis. (Harmony, $8.95.) When Martin Amis's novel about a group of rich kids and their violent weekend party was reviewed in 1975, one critic called it ''a remarkable fantasy'' but said the book is ''not for the squeamish.'' The characters are described ''with a total ferocity which is nevertheless frequently comic.''",1988-07-24T05:00:00+0000

The twins went on to became national collegiate champions at the University of Nebraska in 1984, Jim at 177 pounds and Bill at 190. The Scherrs, who will celebrate their 27th birthdays tomorrow, were alternate selections to the United States team in 1984. After winning their national collegiate titles as seniors, they watched from the sidelines as the American men won 7 of 10 freestyle events and 2 more in the 10-division Greco-Roman competition. ''It was disappointing that we didn't get chances to compete, but we wanted Olympic gold medals so much that we decided to stick with wrestling for four more years,'' Bill said yesterday at an informal gathering with the news media in Manhattan. ''Olympic medals are something we've been working toward for six or seven years. It's been a long grind, but we're ready, emotionally and mentally.'' Jim, who will wrestle at 198 pounds, is an assistant coach at Northwestern University. Bill, an assistant at Indiana University under Jim Humphrey, the head coach of the Olympic freestyle wrestlers, will compete at 220 pounds. Bill won the world championship at 198 pounds in 1985, but moved up to the heavier weight class to open the way for Jim to land an Olymic berth.(AP)",1988-07-26T05:00:00+0000

The Chelsea School Committee approved the plan, which is subject to ratification by the state. The system is the state's most impoverished. 1 An F.C.C. ban on ''indecency'' during evening broadcasts violated the right to free speech, a Federal appeals court ruled.

Models and features vary widely depending on price. Some contain answering machines, intercom systems and automatic dialers capable of storing up to 20 numbers. Some can be used in a swimming pool and some allow both the base and the handset to be used as individual phones. The base of a cordless phone, which houses a transmitter, must be plugged into a modular telephone jack and an electric outlet. The portable element is the handset. During recharging, which takes three to six hours, the handset must be cradled in the base. Most current models have ranges of up to 1,000 feet, the legal limit set by the Federal Communications Commission. Because of the limited number of frequencies allotted by the F.C.C., users often experience interference; newer models will search automatically for the clearest line. PRICE FEATURES $59-69 Pulse and tone dialing, volume control. $100-150 ntercom system, paging, memory dialing, frequency selection. $200 and up Built-in answering machines, extensive memory dialing, wider frequency selection.

Older women invite him in for cake and cookies -and seduce him. Big brother Sam is forever telling him he's a slouch. Even Dad, hoping for the best for his son, is heartbroken as Davey bungles another after-school job (caught sleeping with the librarian this time).

To be sure, Davey's voice, at times, is infectiously energetic and his descriptions vivid, particularly when he's describing the Jewish boys camp in the Catskills of the 1930's where he works as a waiter for the summer, and where most of the novel takes place. Davey recounts camp life in intimate detail, reveling in boyish pranks from the kitchen to the sleeping bag.

us,New & Noteworthy,"SKULLDUGGERY, by Peter Marks. (Carroll & Graf, $4.50.) For years amateur historians have tried to discover who perpetrated the hoax of the Piltdown man by planting the bones that tricked anthropologists into believing they had found the missing link. Last year, our reviewer, Patrick McGrath, said the imaginary solution offered in this novel was unconvincing but that Peter Marks ''displays a masterly grasp of the scientific subtleties [ and ] an extensive familiarity with the lives and works of the famous men who grace his pages.'' THE GREAT SCHOOL WARS: A History of the New York City Public Schools, by Diane Ravitch. (Basic, $14.95.) Decentralization was an untried idea when Diane Ravitch completed her history of New York City's troubled school system 15 years ago. The result of this effort to wrest control from administrative headquarters in downtown Brooklyn has been ''thirty-two bureaucratic outposts in the districts plus the old, familiar bureaucracy,'' she writes in a new introduction, while the underlying problems remain the same. In 1974, our reviewer, George Levine, said the book's criticisms were ''mild and judicious'' and that one of its ''great virtues'' was that it might ''move us toward less blandly optimistic views of public education. . . . For her strenuous carefulness we can only be grateful.'' OH!, by Mary Robison. (Nonpareil/Godine, $9.95.) When this deadpan novel about a bizarre Midwestern family run by a soft-drink and miniature-golf entrepreneur was published in 1981, The Times's Anatole Broyard said Mary Robison's prose ''is like the sawdust that termites leave. . . . She's something of a gourmet of various kinds of collapse.'' THE CHILDREN AT SANTA CLARA, by Elizabeth Marek (Penguin, $6.95.) The lessons she was learning at Harvard began to seem beside the point, so Elizabeth Marek moved to the Southwest, where she worked at a home for emotionally disturbed children. Last year our reviewer, Rosellen Brown, called the book a ''celebration, by a gentle and unworldly young woman, of the terror and the head-clearing shock of standing close to the uncontrolled flame of the real world.'' PALOMINO, by Elizabeth Jolley. (Stanley Moss/Persea, $8.95.) On a cruise, Laura, a gynecologist and murderer, falls in love with the daughter of an earlier lesbian lover. ''Laura's character, blending tragic knowledge and absurd hopes, is an achievement of tragicomic art,'' Josephine Hendin said here last year. LILLIAN HELLMAN: The Image, the Woman, by William Wright. (Ballantine, $4.95.) Many details of Lillian Hellman's memoirs may have been fiction, William Wright confirmed, but even without embellishment she led a creative, adventurous life. ''This worldly biography, unlike anything else written by or about Hellman, has no hidden agenda,'' Frank Rich said here in 1986. ''Mr. Wright isn't interested in refighting the political wars of the past half century from the perspective of one camp or another. His main concern is facts, which he has diligently collected, documented and analyzed.'' SIGHTINGS, by Susan Trott. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) When Sunny returns to California from England, where she is having an affair with a philosopher, she finds that her father has run off with her best friend. ''Although she has created an unlikely troupe here and her plot is wildly baroque, [ Susan ] Trott displays a sensitivity to human quirkiness and longings that make this a splendid entertainment,'' Valerie Gladstone said in The Book Review last year. THE IRISH AMERICANS: The Rise to Money and Power, by Andrew M. Greeley. (Warner, $8.95.) The novelist, priest and sociologist uses a mix of opinion polls, historical profiles and reminiscence to attack the cultural stereotypes that surround Irish-Americans. Father Greeley ''vents a good deal of spleen,'' Frances Taliaferro said here in 1981. But she found the author ''well equipped to . . . argue that Irish-Catholic Americans 'have become the most successful educational, occupational, and economic gentile ethnic group in America while at the same time maintaining (traditional) cultural patterns.' In other words, 'the Irish are wealthy, powerful, and still Irish.' '' MAN'S WORK, by John Connelly. (Penguin, $7.95.) Short stories about disaffected Americans trapped by their ennui and inarticulate nature are becoming so numerous that they almost constitute a genre. Last year our reviewer, Susan Mernit, said some of the pieces in this collection are too understated but she admired John Connelly's ''vigorous prose.'' ''There are enough signs of talent in 'Man's Work' to suggest that Mr. Connelly is a writer worth our attention,'' she said. HANDEL, by Christopher Hogwood. (Thames and Hudson, $14.95.) The founder of the Academy of Ancient Music wrote a book on Handel that is ''the clear biography of choice for anyone interested in one of the great figures of music,'' John Rockwell said here in 1985. BODIES, by Robert Barnard. (Dell, $3.50.) A quadruple murder in a photography studio in London's Soho district leads to the uncovering of a conspiracy involving body building and pornography. ''Robert Barnard brings a fine satirical touch to his account of the iron-pumping cult,'' John Gross said in The Times in 1986. THE NEXT LEFT: The History of a Future, by Michael Harrington. (Owl/Holt, $8.95.) One of America's most articulate socialists argues that the left may be ready to rise again. The book is ''full of fascinating insights and provocative judgments,'' George P. Brockway said here last year.",1988-07-31T05:00:00+0000

us,Q And A,"Stratford, Ontario Question: My travel agent was unable to find any tours to the festival at Stratford, Ontario, from New York, although a friend went on a weekend tour, with two plays, from Lewiston, N.Y. How can you account for this? -L. B. H., Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. Answer: It looks as though lack of demand has forestalled attempts to run group tours to the Stratford Festival from New York. Some travelers go in private groups that make their own arrangements. There are tours from western New York because of the relatively short distance. Lewiston, north of Buffalo, is about 100 miles east of Stratford. On the other hand, another travel agent might be able to discover tour organizations that plan a visit. One such company is Dailey-Thorp Travel, which specializes in opera and music tours. Dailey-Thorp is based in New York, but it is running its Canadian Cultural Salute program, with Stratford included, from Oct. 7 to 10, on the basis of independent arrivals in Toronto. The tour is being organized for members of the Metropolitan Opera Guild; basic annual membership of the guild can be had for $40. (Metropolitan Opera Guild, 1865 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10023; 212-582-7500.) The Canadian tour includes attendance at Shakespeare's ''Taming of the Shrew'' at the Festival Theater in Stratford and dinner at the city's Church Restaurant. In Toronto, where guild members will spend three nights at the Four Seasons Hotel, they will see Verdi's ''Don Carlos'' and Tchaikovsky's ''Queen of Spades'' performed on successive nights by the Canadian Opera Company at the O'Keefe Center. The cost of the tour is $987 a person, double occupancy. Air fare not included. (Dailey-Thorp Travel, 315 West 57th Street, New York, N.Y. 10019; 212-307-1555.) Travelers planning an independent visit may obtain information on accommodations and the theater program - there are three theaters -from Stratford Festival, Post Office Box 520, Stratford, Ontario, Canada N5A 6V2 (519-271-4040). The box office number is 519-273-1600. The festival season continues until Oct. 29. Visiting Yemen Question: Another woman and I would like to visit North Yemen.

Visas may be obtained from the Yemen Mission to the United Nations (866 United Nations Plaza, New York, N.Y 10017; 212-355-1730) or the Embassy of Yemen (600 New Hampshire Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20037; 202-965-4760).

It must have been difficult: Pippin was not a writer and was not very well educated. Even the physical act of writing was hard for him, for his right hand and arm had been crippled by a sniper's bullet and he could scarcely hold a pen. Yet he tried several drafts of a war narrative before he gave the writing up and turned to drawing and finally to painting. That, too, was a struggle; he had to hold the brush in his crippled right hand and guide its movements with his left. He worked at one painting for three years, giving it, he reckoned, a hundred coats of paint. It was called ''The End of the War: Starting Home,'' and it hangs now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art - a strange and powerful image of the violence that he remembered.",1988-07-31T05:00:00+0000

He and 11 ursine cohorts, all similarly gifted, are performers with the Moscow Circus, a collection of virtuoso acrobats, jugglers and clowns (as well as trained animals) set for a 15-stop North American tour that begins in Toronto on Aug. 17. Representing Soyuzgoscirk, the Soviet state circus, which employs 3,500 performers in a variety of venues throughout the Soviet Union, the 12 acts were selected by Steven E. Leber and Scott Sanders, producers of the tour for Radio City Music Hall Productions in New York. (The circus stops in Radio City from Sept. 14 to Oct. 9.) Since last November, the producers have made three excursions to the Soviet Union, visiting 10 cities, to select talent. ''We were looking for acts with unique appeal,'' Leber says; eight of the acts have never before been seen in North America. They include the Flying Cranes, aerialists capable of quadruple somersaults, whose performance, balletlike, conveys a narrative; Nikolai Pavlenko and his 17 Sumatran tigers, and Tamerlan Nugzarov, horses and horsemen from the Caucasus region. ''They're amazing,'' Leber says. ''Riders are dragged at full speed along the ground. Then this horse jumps through a hoop that has knives sticking out of it.'' The juggling bear act is known as the Zolkins, named for the trainers Vyacheslav Zolkin and Svetlana Mikityuk, who are husband and wife. Lifetime circus performers, they've been doing this particular routine for a decade, since Vyacheslav, once a tightrope walker, broke his back and needed something else to do. Antipod, or leg juggling, is a family thing; Svetlana's father, apparently, was the first human to master it. -",1988-07-31T05:00:00+0000

Two hundred years ago, cadenzas in concerto movements served to launch the individual performer's flights of fancy; cadenzas today are simply repetitions of what someone else has already written out. Few current virtuosos dare to exploit their spur-of-the-moment inspirations or would know how if asked. Are we more inhibited? Yes, but largely because we know less. Like most good jazz performers, 18th-century virtuosos were more complete musicians than their technique-mad classical counterparts today. They had the fund of knowledge that liberates the fantasy. This brief set of essays on the improviser's art by a musician and the author of ''Just Being at the Piano'' encourages the modern musician to go beyond inhibition with many helpful suggestions for all ages. Yet it skirts the major problem of an art that demands both a free-flying spirit and the heavy weight of discipline: namely, that the freedom to imagine and the capacity for imagination do not necessarily go hand in hand. Mildred Portney Chase's eloquent cheerleading won't do much good if her readers are the young pianists who typically can play the hell out of Chopin's G minor Ballade, but when asked to transpose a simple chorale a third downward, stare back in dumb silence. The Book of Common Prayer said it best: there is no ''perfect freedom'' without ''service.''",1988-07-31T05:00:00+0000

If you want to know what it felt like in the Vietnam War to itch and to sweat, to fear and to kill, the poet John Jacob's first novel will give it to you straight - too straight, perhaps. ''Long Ride Back'' provides a lot of action, but not much reflection. It is not an antiwar novel; in fact, you can love or hate war and still read the book with interest. Once in a while, Mr. Jacob's extremely detached hero, Travis Jones, lets a feeling slip out, but he never succumbs to self-pity. Jones and his cohorts were elite commandos sent on bizarre intelligence missions far from the usual battle areas. In describing their experiences, Mr. Jacob's writing is terse and vivid, but his novel's structure demands patience. The war scenes, told in past-tense flashbacks, are frequently, sometimes annoyingly, interspersed with present-tense scenes set in Chicago after the war, where Travis Jones is still suffering from malaria, going through life on the slant, with an emotional limp from his obsessive memories. The great strength of the book is its even narrative pitch: it describes and does not moralize. The Chicago sections are episodic, virtually plotless. But the part of the story that is set in Vietnam finishes like a thriller, in sweaty jungle fear, in betrayal - and in a final dramatically satisfying knife duel in which, Travis Jones recalls, ''Our eyes locked in patterns of the darkest fear, hate, anger, resentment. It was the most depraved moment of my war.''",1988-07-31T05:00:00+0000

Mark Hofmann, a premed student, decided at age 25 to become a professional forger of old documents. For several years in the early 1980's he had outstanding success as he turned the Mormon world upside down while he picked its pockets and cast doubt on some of its fundamental beliefs. His Mormon upbringing and his diligent research into the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints enabled Mr. Hofmann to forge papers that seemed to show the prophet Joseph Smith Jr. was a fraud. Mr. Hofmann produced the so-called Salamander Letter, which raised questions about the very foundation of Mormonism, the story of how an angel had led Smith to the gold plates he translated into the Book of Mormon. Highly placed Mormons scrambled to buy and control Mr. Hofmann's forgeries. When he found himself facing exposure, he coldly selected two men who were innocently involved in his fraudulent transactions and left pipe bombs to kill them. One died, and the wife of the other man was killed when she picked up the package. A third bomb, intended for someone else, exploded accidentally in Mr. Hofmann's car, wounding him. Linda Sillitoe and Allen D. Roberts, both Mormon journalists, trace the lives of the major players as the forger and murderer is unmasked. Their research is impressive, but their presentation of it seems to be aimed at a Salt Lake City audience. The effect, frequently, creates a desire to see fewer trees and more forest.",1988-07-31T05:00:00+0000

The novelist and poet Barry Gifford has devoted his 18th book to what he calls ''a portrait of Thoroughbred horse racing as it exists in the present time on any particular day at any track in the United States.'' He attempts to accomplish this by providing, with no comment, 73 monologues transcribed from interviews with 34 ''racetrackers'' - trainers, owners, grooms, clockers, etc. The result is a narrow collection of raw material that falls far short of the author's goal. Mr. Gifford says he did his research at seven far-flung tracks, but the vast majority of the interviews are from Golden Gate Fields, a second-rate track near his home in northern California. Also, 35 of the book's 73 passages come from only three of the interview subjects, and their voices wear thin. But the book's major problem is the lack of an expert voice that can sift through the interviews and comment on their truth or relevance. For example, a gambler claims to lose money only once in every 300 trips to the track. He does not disclose his secret and any real horseplayer knows his statement is absurd, but Mr. Gifford gives the reader no choice but to believe it. He writes in a brief and irrelevant epilogue about a day spent at the Longchamps track in Paris: ''The race was 2,000 meters on the grass, as, of course, all European races are.'' Actually, European races are run at many different distances and most but not all are on grass. Perhaps it is best that Mr. Gifford did not attempt to provide his own voice as that of an expert.",1988-07-31T05:00:00+0000

us,Venice Inside and Out,"Inside Venice, for us, was located only two brisk turns behind San Marco, ''the central building of the world,'' in the city that in certain moods looks as if it might still, for coherent beauty, rank as the central city of the world. In 1987, when we were looking for a pied-a-terre in Venice, we were unexpectedly offered one, gratis, by a learned and charming Bolognese doctor, at that time unknown to us, who happens to agree with Ruskin about San Marco and the esthetic perfections of La Serenissima - the most Serene, an old name for Venezia. For several weeks we set up housekeeping in his 16th-century flat on Calle Larga San Marco. Inside the center of the center. ''Saint Mark's Wide Street,'' the street we came back to footsore several times a day for meals and sleep, may have been considered a wide street 300 years ago, but if four tourists wanted to walk abreast in it, the fourth would have to be halved, like the viscount in Italo Calvino's angry postwar fable, ''Il Visconte Dimezzato.'' Calle Larga San Marco is a busy, noisy street, a prime trinket street where you can also find international couture, but our refuge - of four (or five) low-ceilinged rooms - is so secretively buried within the edifice that our serenity was never disturbed. One of our two courtyards was a well, surrounded on three sides by our windows and on the fourth by the never-opened windows of the circumambient hotel, defended against our gaze by metal shields that the Italians call saracens. Where we were exactly in the indistinct complex, or who owns what part of the building, remains perplexing. Our remarkable host put in the plumbing himself, and doing the pipe work must have been a nightmare, what with the seven-inch beams and the property confusions combined. For the first time I understand how a family could be hidden in a space whose location would be hard to imagine, let alone detect - as happened with Anne Frank's family in Amsterdam or Art Spiegelman's parents in Poland. In fact, our apartment, too, has a secret room behind a closet door, scarcely more than a bed wide, fitted up with bunk beds and books.",1988-07-31T05:00:00+0000
