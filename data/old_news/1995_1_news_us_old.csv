us,Sports of The Times; Ice and Grass Tales: Postcards From '94,"ANY year that begins with a knee-whacking is not normal. I think we can all agree on that. This was supposed to be the year the exotic datelines would come to us: the World Cup would be held right in our backyard. But even a soccer buff like me would admit that other events captured our attention, and many of the events were not exactly on the schedule. MIAMI, JAN. 2 Hours after Florida State beats Nebraska in the Orange Bowl, the voters choose good old Bobby Bowden's team as the national college football champion, thereby sticking it to Notre Dame, which had beaten Florida State during the season. DETROIT, JAN. 6 Are we trapped in an Elmore Leonard novel? Nancy Kerrigan is whacked on the knee by an unknown male assailant at the national figure-skating championships. As they sit down to write, many reporters make jokes that Tonya Harding might be involved; to their credit, they do not type out their suspicions. DETROIT, JAN. 8 After toying with us for a while, a personable deputy chief named Benny Napoleon reveals that Detroit police are investigating leads in several cities -- including, he casually adds, Portland, Ore. The writers start digging out their Harding notes about her hometown. They know she invites trouble. IRKUTSK-ON-NIAGARA, JAN. 15 That's what I call Buffalo on a day when the wind chill factor is minus-32. I develop a huge respect for the Bills and their loyal fans on their fourth straight trek toward defeat in the Super Bowl. HAMAR, NORWAY, FEB. 16 The idealistic tone of these Winter Games is personified by a speed skater named Johann Olav Koss. He wins the 1,500 meters and promptly gives away his $30,000 in bonus money to charity. HAMAR, NORWAY, FEB. 17 On to seamier stuff. Implicated by her former husband in the attack on Kerrigan, Harding arrives for a practice session. Kerrigan smiles grimly, while hundreds of flippant journalists like me jam the tiny rink. Not our finest moment, but somebody's got to be there. HAMAR, NORWAY, FEB. 18 Dan Jansen takes a victory lap with his daughter, Jane, in his arms after finally winning a gold medal, six years after his sister Jane died while he was in Calgary. HAMAR, NORWAY, FEB. 23 With her usual gusto, Bonnie Blair wins her fifth gold medal in speed skating to become the leading American female gold medalist in history. HAMAR, NORWAY, FEB. 25 Aching from a collision only 32 hours earlier, Oksana Baiul improvises two complicated moves at the end of her routine to take the gold medal away from Kerrigan. The 16-year-old orphan from Odessa cries, and many fans cry with her. Harding makes a spectacle of herself by once again coming out unprepared. LILLEHAMMER, NORWAY, FEB. 27 Why are Norwegian fans cheering for Vladimir Smirnov, a Kazakh skier, even before he wins the gold medal in the 50-kilometer cross-country? ""We've got enough medals of our own,"" says a fan camped out in the snowy woods. The Winter Games are ending, but I will always remember the idealistic people as much as the beautiful countryside. CHARLOTTE, N.C., APR. 3 In a dramatic news conference, Nolan Richardson of Arkansas uses his bitterness at his slow ascent as a black coach to demand respect for his team. The next night, Arkansas will beat Duke for the national title. LOUISVILLE, Ky., MAY 7 All week long, the trainer Nick Zito has talked about winning the Derby and his beloved New York Yankees winning the pennant. Go For Gin does his part, but Zito has no way of knowing baseball will call off its pennant race before the home stretch. NEW YORK, JUNE 1 In one of the great performances in Madison Square Garden, spindly Reggie Miller scores 25 points in the fourth quarter and taunts the moviemaker Spike Lee at courtside. NEW YORK, JUNE 14 At 11:04 P.M., the Stanley Cup is displayed in New York for the first time in 54 years, in the deserving hands of Mark Messier. PONTIAC, MICH., JUNE 18 For the first time, a World Cup game is held indoors -- in oily air but on acceptable grass in the Silverdome. Eric Wynalda scores on a free kick as the United States ties Switzerland, 1-1. HOUSTON, JUNE 22 Huge events overlap. I watch the first half on the tube as the U.S. is in the process of stunning Colombia, 2-1, in the World Cup. Then I go out to courtside as the Rockets beat the Knicks, 90-84, for the N.B.A. title. The Knicks cannot admit it, but this was their best shot with this cast of players. WASHINGTON, JUNE 28 I'm writing about a soccer game when word comes that Doc Gooden has flunked another drug test. This smiling sad-sack has not yet figured out that drugs are going to wreck his life. CHICAGO, JULY 2 Word arrives that Andres Escobar, the Colombian who inadvertently kicked in a goal for the U.S. 10 days earlier, had been gunned down near Medellin. Germany beats Belgium. Who cares? PASADENA, CALIF., JULY 3 Romania beats Argentina, which is without Diego Armando Maradona, the seedy, aging genius who was bounced when illegal drugs were found in his system. Maradona is disgraced, but he does not understand. PALO ALTO, CALIF., JULY 4 The U.S. loses, 1-0, at Stanford, and is eliminated in the second round of the World Cup. The wandering Yanks did all right for a nation without a major league. FOXBORO, MASS., JULY 5 Courtesy of the red-eye, my fourth game in four cities in four days, I see Roberto Baggio beat Nigeria, 2-1, with goals in the 89th minute and overtime. He saves the Italian team from a potentially ugly early return home. EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., JULY 13 As soon as Italy has beaten Bulgaria in the semifinals, the ground crew starts removing the beautiful grass to uncover the hideous artificial turf. Big-time soccer is gone from New York, for a very long time. PASADENA, CALIF., JULY 17 Brazil beats Italy, 3-2, in penalty kicks after a scoreless tie. Americans criticize the method of breaking a tie, but the world soccer organization has never found a better method, nor have I. NEW YORK, AUG. 11 The Yankees play the last baseball game before the players go on strike. Petulant millionaires strike against petulant millionaires, putting hard-working vendors and the ushers out of work. NEW YORK, SEPT. 30 Given a window of opportunity without a World Series, the hockey owners promptly shut down their own sport, refusing the players' offer to go the entire season without a contract. Are they nuts? NEW YORK, NOV. 6 Most runners dedicate their New York City Marathon to Fred Lebow, the visionary racedirector who died on Oct. 9. WASHINGTON, DEC. 22 The owners invoke the salary cap, thereby plunging baseball into an even uglier legal and moral stalemate, with the prospect of replacement players. The spirit of knee-whacking remains in the air. Where is the World Cup when we really need it? Anyway, Happy New Year, and let's hope this one is more fun.",1995-01-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Business Diary,"It Makes Perfect Sense to Be a Good Neighbor Looking at it from a coldly practical angle, this nation can't afford to have the Mexican economy fall apart. Just as a ramshackle house stains a whole neighborhood, a tattered Mexico would be a big headache for its mighty cousin to the north. So it made total sense last week when Washington decided to pump billions into Mexico to prop up the battered peso. And President Ernesto Zedillo soon saw the necessity of some falling on swords, accepting the resignation of his Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, whose prints were all over the currency mess. Mr. Zedillo also announced a drastic emergency plan, including deep concessions from labor, big spending cuts and a slowdown of economic growth. As it happens, Mr. Serra's replacement, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, tried in the fall to show the need for an orderly devaluation, but no one listened. They are now. Give and It Shall Be Taken From Britain, today's lesson: Never, ever underestimate the public's willingness to take full advantage of anything that's free. A mobile-phone company called Mercury One-2-One wanted a catchy promotion for its ""personal communications services"" -- it's among the first in the world to offer this radio-wave-based phone technology -- so it offered free calls on Christmas for new subscribers. What it no doubt figured on: customers merrily making a few calls to relatives, then getting back to the day's festivities. What it got: jammed lines, 10 times normal volume, 12-hour international calls, some people making 100 calls, others not able to get through at all. In short, chaos. Japan's Humbled Self-Image Japan strikes a bit less terror in American hearts these days, and even the Japanese admit that their mighty economic machine has been badly humbled. Just three years ago, 53 percent of Japanese said they expected Japan to lead the world economic pack for quite a while. A recent poll shows, though, that that's plummeted to 25 percent. And what's the next powerhouse? A big difference of opinion on that one -- fully a quarter of the Japanese, but a scant 4 percent of Americans, picked China. One feeling persists in Japan, though: 83 percent of Japanese believe their blue-collar workers work harder than Americans -- and that number's held pretty steady. Mr. Pataki Seems to Mean It George Pataki sent some powerful signals last week that he is dead serious about his economic vision for New York. First he named a new budget director, Patricia Woodworth, who as Michigan's budget director has zeroed in on cutting taxes and state spending. A key item on her resume: Michigan's move this year to end local schools' dependence on property taxes. She said that approach would be tough in New York, though. Mr. Pataki also found a Commissioner of Social Services in Mary Glass, who holds the same job in Westchester (she'll have to work fast; she's returning to that job in three months). On her watch, 60 percent of those on home relief were dropped for failing to work. The ship of state is clearly shaping up as a tight one. The West, Yes; the Coast, No It's really true. Though New Yorkers persist in thinking they are at the center of the universe, New York, alas, has suffered the indignity of falling behind Texas to be No. 3 on the state population list. But Census figures out last week also highlighted an interesting aspect of this nation's great tilt westward: it stops before it gets to the ocean. The big growth spurts are coming one or two states in from the West Coast, like Nevada, up 5.4 percent, and Arizona, up 3.3 percent. And how about California? Yes, it's still easily No. 1, but it now ranks just 35th in growth. The state's sour economy is clearly no draw these days. Mutual Funds: Doing Fine (So Far) The public made a startling discovery last year: mutual funds are not invincible. Investors scurried away from bond funds, but a sickly stock market couldn't stop stock funds from slogging ahead. True, the net $3 billion that flowed in in November was the lowest since 1991, but that marked the 49th straight month that more has come in than gone out -- easily the longest streak ever. Maybe people, even when gloomy, can't think of a better place to put their cash. Shoppers Always Show Up It makes no sense. Stores panic in early December, then run sales even before Christmas, and -- wonder of wonders! -- the hordes arrive. Don't retailers know that this nation's citizens are genetically programmed for holiday excess? They have to show up, always at the last minute. So it was that retailers, tallying it all up last week, found that sales weren't bad but profits were poor -- because of markdowns. One footnote: plastic was big. Visa and Mastercard both reported hefty increases in credit-card purchases. Maybe people are using cards more for their daily bread, but it could also spell empty stores now as people wrestle those Visa bills back to earth. Something Completely Different On New Year's Day, this page would be incomplete without a roundup of Top Stories of '94. On second thought, that's a dumb idea. Instead, here's an exclusive look at what will surely be the Top Story of '95: All the people who made money on derivatives (if billions were lost, billions had to be made, right?) will be overwhelmed by remorse and holiday spirit and send checks to Orange County. BRITS ZIP UP TMS. SQ.! It's called the zipper, that ribbon of lit-up news on the 43d Street end of Times Square. And even in an age when people get up-to-the-second news practically piped into their brains, the passing throng can easily be seduced into watching the headlines emerge, word * by * rolling * word. In 1928, soon after it was born, the zipper carried news of Hoover's victory, and with a few interruptions, it's been blinking ever since. But Newsday, which has run the billboard since 1986, pulled out recently, raising the possibility that zipper junkies would go headline-less come New Year's Eve. Relax. Last week Pearson, the British conglomerate that puts out The Financial Times and The Economist, picked up the lease. Senate to House: Drop Deal Newt Gingrich's sojourn in the land of big-bucks publishing was a brief one. Last week Bob Dole raised his powerful eyebrows at Mr. Gingrich's $4.5 million deal to write two books for a publisher owned by Rupert Murdoch, who happens to have regulatory business with Congress. Mr. Gingrich soon scrapped the deal, saying he'd take just a $1 advance and patiently await his royalties. He had to ""do what's good for the country,"" Mr. Gingrich said; even though it was a ""legal and ethical deal,"" he didn't want the new Congress ""to be slowed down or distracted,"" even for a second. David Bonior, the Michigan Democrat who is showing signs of being a feisty anti-Gingrich, said Mr. Gingrich ""finally got the message."" Insurance With a Difference Life insurance. It conjures images of endless mailings and sales pitches -- and it's the last thing people want to think about anyway. So selling it is tough, and many agents don't last. But a New York sales agent named Steven Genovese, prosecutors say, had a better idea. An indictment last week asserted that for years he presented phony applications, wrote bad checks for a few payments, and pocketed his commission -- perhaps half the first year's premium. If a policy's canceled, part of the commission should be returned, but that didn't happen this time -- and no procedure was in place to track such fraud. Agents can job-hop leaving barely a footprint. Even Mr. Genovese's lawyer admitted that the system ""could almost seduce people into fraudulent conduct."" A Bullet Too Far Well, David Keen decided last week that the world did not need, just yet, a bullet that not only pierces armor but splits into razorlike shards and does all sorts of nasty, nasty stuff. Mr. Keen, who heads an Alabama company called Signature Products, backed down after stiff police opposition to the company's bullet, which he says is needed because criminals often wear bulletproof vests. Of course, some people say that his bullet isn't even possible, that it's all a hoax, that he was helping the gun-control lobby more than anyone. The one thing that's certain: he got a lot of attention.",1995-01-01T05:00:00+0000

The Secret Life of James Thurber","James Thurber's centennial, on Dec. 8, 1994, occasioned several new assessments of Thurber's enduring value as a cartoonist, playwright, author of children's books, humorist and (ever increasingly as the nation's health and his own declined) social commentator. Neil A. Grauer, a freelance journalist and cartoonist, has provided the best to date: an appreciative, sympathetic overview of a singular talent and the often compromised life it inhabited. Neither a literary adulation (like Charles S. Holmes's biography, ""The Clocks of Columbus"") nor an irritable diminishment (like Burton Bernstein's ""Thurber: A Biography""), REMEMBER LAUGHTER: A Life of James Thurber (University of Nebraska, $20) manages to offer a writer's life with a balance that is often lost in contemporary biography. Expedient, germane and selective, the book maintains an interest in the subject's personal life and development only to illuminate Thurber's work, which is what warranted the biography in the first place. Though Mr. Grauer necessarily relies on previous criticism, Thurber's letters and interviews with the author's few remaining associates (most of whom, alas, knew Thurber in his last two decades, when alcohol often inspired more diatribe than humor), his own opinions allow for both circumspection and conviction. Mr. Grauer fairly inventories the sources for Thurber's uncanny fictionalized memoirs as well as his later ""grumpy and misanthropic"" tone when he assumed ""the role of a nearly perpetual pallbearer for comedy."" Throughout, Mr. Grauer does not permit a demeaning anecdote to displace the genuine accomplishments that continue to provide the greater perspective. ""Remember Laughter"" takes its title to heart, which should give readers a reason to celebrate.MICHAEL J. ROSEN",1995-01-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Some Economists Look Into the New Year,"Statistics will probably show that the economy throttled back at the end of 1994 to about the 2.5 percent growth rate that the Federal Reserve and most private analysts had considered sustainable. Growth and consumer inflation figures below are from a review, fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter. Unemployment figures are fourth-quarter averages. Job growth figures are from interviews. Ms. Tyson was willing to speak only in general terms pending a White House forecast due in February. Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist, Shawmut National Corp., Boston Growth 2.9 percent Lagged effect of higher interest rates takes hold with an outside chance of ""serious"" slowdown in the second half of the year Unemployment, Job Growth 6.0 percent, 1.75 million jobs This is the job growth that is consistent with Federal Reserve's presumed G.D.P. target of 2.5 percent Inflation 3.5 percent Prices accelerating a bit but from very low base and wage costs, the dominant factor, still well controlled. Many fears are misplaced inflation could well be less than 3.5. Interest rates 7.20 percent Decline reflects growing confidence that growth is slowing, shrinking inflation premium. There's considerable room for long-term yields to come down so long as inflation is tamed. Short-term rates peak at about 6.25 percent Uncertainties, Mainly from Washington. Fed, which has said it would err of side of restraint, could underestimate impact of moves already in the pipeline and tighten monetary policy too much. Tax-cut fever could get out of hand. John O. Wilson, executive vice president and chief economist Bank of America, San Francisco Growth 2.5 percent Economy will be slowing rapidly at yearend on the way to a much weaker 1996, as soft-landing again eludes policymakers Unemployment, Job Growth 5.3 %, 2.8 million jobs Dropouts from the labor force will help keep the unemployment rate low. Job growth in California, where recovery has lagged, set to accelerate Inflation 3.3 percent More bottlenecks will emerge and wage pressures will show up in the factory-intensive Midwest. Oil prices likely to rise. Interest rates 8.3 percent Inflation pressures and fiscal debate push bond rates up. Overnight rates up to 6 1/2-7 percent. Uncertainties Tax changes won't be made in time to directly affect the 1995 economy but a nnervous bond market could stumble from a bidding war over cuts, thereby undermining confidence. Howard Keen Jr. Chief economist, Conrail, Philadelphia. Growth 2.4 percent. To restrain growth, the Fed keeps raising interest rates until slowdown is evident, probably in early spring. Unemployment, Job Growth 6.0 percent. 2.2 million jobs. Jobless rate edges up as corporations maintain pressure to keep their production costs down. Inflation 3.2 percent. No convincing evidence so far of a ""new era"" for inflation, but complacency could prove to be dangerous. Interest rates 7.9 percent. Long-term rates fairly flat despite lower capital spending by business. Short-term rates may rise as much as a full percentage point before peaking. Uncertainties, Resiliency of financial markets and consumers to further increases in short-term interest rates. Whether auto producers can meet production schedules. M. Kathryn Eickhoff, president Eickhoff Economics, New York Growth 3.0 percent With the consumer pulling back and housing a modest depressant, economy should slow markedly by the second quarter and manage as little as 2 percent rate of expansion in the second half. Unemployment, Job Growth 2.6 million jobs, 5.4 percent Because of more potential workers than many think, jobless rate could get as low as 5 percent without wages causing faster inflation Inflation 3.3 percent With companies having gotten a grip on health care costs, wages could rise as much as 4 percent, which managers get, before meeting stiff resistance Interest rates 8.5 percent Short rates should peak around 6 1/2 percent Uncertainties, Fed could be forced to overtighten in second half, which could tip economy into recession. Derivatives pose risk to the banking system. Laura D'Andrea Tyson Chairwoman, Council of Economic Advisers, Washington Growth 2.7 percent Moderating from surprisingly robust 1994 as impact of interest rate increases spreads beyond housing to dampen consumer and business spending. But recovery abroad should buoy exports. Unemployment, Job Growth 2.3 million jobs 6.2 percent Job creation should post solid gains but unemployment rate, already well under 6 percent, is likely to creep higher. Inflation 3.2 percent A small rise as wages remain in check under discipline of global competition. Interest rates. Doesn't forecast 30-year bond.

The gains extended across the nation, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent, the lowest since July 1990. Another sign of strength was a broadly based 54,000 jump in manufacturing jobs. [ Page 1. ] In New York and New Jersey, the job market also improved But experts said the improvement did not reflect a turnaround in the region's economy. [ 50. ] The computer is on the verge of overtaking the television set as the chief electronics product in the home. Indeed, based on the products shown at an industry trade show, the TV set is rapidly becoming a computer as digital technology is used in televisions and video recorders and combination TV-telephones. [ 39. ] Companies Fears that the price war in long-distance telephone services would escalate roiled the shares of AT&T and MCI. Wall Street's fears were prompted by a move by Sprint to offer a flat price, which was seen as a radical departure from pricing cloaked behind complex, heavily promoted discount schemes. Sprint's shares rose. [ 39. ] PNC Bank will take a $79 million charge as part of an effort to get out of some money-losing bonds. The company will also spend $70 million to invest in derivatives that it hopes will help offset further losses it faces from rising interest rates.

Despite their rivalry, the two cereal companies welcome the growth overseas as a respite from cut-throat price wars and lackluster gains at home.

The sale of Continental Baking would make Interstate the largest bakery company in the nation.

It Is Copied. Therefore, It Exists?","WHAT: The Area S4 U.F.O. model. This miniature plastic replica is said by its manufacturer, the Testor Corporation of Rockford, Ill., to be ""a scale model kit of the alien craft allegedly hidden in Nevada by the U.S. Government, as described by eyewitness and former Government physicist Bob Lazar."" But the original craft is not just any U.F.O. It is nicknamed ""the sport model"" by Mr. Lazar, who has claimed to have worked in 1988 at a classified air base in central Nevada referred to by some as Area S4. There, he has asserted, he worked as part of a Government team, ""reverse-engineering"" one of nine alien craft, taking it apart to determine its technology. The model, which retails for $24.95, has been selling out at hobby stores, particularly since the talk-show host Larry King displayed one two months ago during his show about U.F.O.'s, broadcast from just outside the base. ""We are selling them as fast as we can make them,"" said Nancy Rainwater, a company spokeswoman.THE ORIGINAL: It is described by the company as an ""anti-matter reaction, gravity-amplification, interstellar craft,"" made of an unknown substance. Mr. Lazar has said that the anti-matter reactor bends space-time and is fueled by what he called Element 115 (the latest addition to the terrestrial periodic table is Element 111, announced by German physicists just last month).THE MODEL: Made of plastic, it is 13 inches in diameter when assembled (compared with 52 feet for the original). It has 23 pieces, including alien figures and a transparent top that offers a view of the anti-matter reactor. Paint and cement are not included; a 16-page full-color book is.THE DESIGNER: John Andrews has spent years gleaning information about secret United States military aircraft for Testor. ""We have a kind of miniature C.I.A. here,"" said Mr. Andrews, who has made several trips to the perimeter of the base in Nevada. ""We collect bits and pieces and put them together in a mosaic."" He says he scouts and talks to people who observe activity around Air Force bases to design his models. They include one of the F-117 Stealth fighter, which he made before the Government even acknowledged the Stealth existed; that kit has sold 700,000 units, believed to be the most for any plastic model kit ever. Last year, he turned out a model of the Aurora, the new breed of supersonic spy plane said to be housed at the Nevada base.SOURCES: Mr. Andrews consulted with Mr. Lazar and Jon Farhat, a computer-graphics designer who is working on a movie about Mr. Lazar. Mr. Lazar has claimed that he saw the saucer fly, though never higher than 40 feet off the ground. His personal credentials have not checked out (he has said that the Government destroyed his educational records, from the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology).RELIABILITY: As for the existence of the craft on which the model is based, Testor has carefully said, ""We can neither confirm nor deny."" And the Government? Well, It has denied that the air base ever existed.PHIL PATTON",1995-01-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Factory Samples,"Edmund White once called Andy Warhol ""a brilliant dumbbell."" Willem de Kooning reportedly accused him of being a ""killer of art."" Yet behind what the critic Arthur C. Danto has called Warhol's ""fool"" persona was an intelligence uncannily attuned to the Zeitgeist. When Warhol died in 1987, his legacy included a 27-room town house filled with fine art, furnishings, objets d'art and jewelry that generated a staggering $25.3 million when auctioned in 1988 at Sotheby's -- funds that subsequently would be used to create the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and later, with additional money from the Dia Center for the Arts and the Carnegie Institute, to establish a museum in Pittsburgh devoted solely to Warhol's work. THE ANDY WARHOL MUSEUM (The Andy Warhol Museum/Distributed Art Publishers, $40) is a record of this collective endeavor, filled with photographs from the extensive Warhol archives. It offers a grab bag of readings, from Mr. Danto's provocative essay exploring the philosophical underpinnings of Warhol's art to Helen Searing's long-winded architectural treatise on industrial conversions and the making of museums. In the most personal of these pieces, Bennard B. Perlman, a college friend, writes engagingly of Warhol's childhood and student years. His recollections of Warhol as a shy, physically awkward observer contrast sharply with the irreverent, ultra-hip art star and socialite of Warhol's New York years. More titillating though less revealing is the picture-album-cum-captions chronology that follows. Here we learn everything from the year Warhol underwent cosmetic surgery on his nose to the scoop on the ""50 Most Beautiful People"" party at Warhol's infamous studio, the Factory. A compact disk of 17 brief audio recordings also comes with the book. ""Andy taped thousands of hours of conversations, meetings, parties and dinners,"" reports the narrator, John Giorno, a poet who appeared in ""Sleep,"" Warhol's first movie. Perhaps this obsession with self-documentation explains why Warhol felt he had no need for memory and could glibly announce, ""My mind is like a tape recorder with one button -- erase.""

On top of that, there was a huge upward revision that made November's rise in payrolls the biggest in seven years. All this brought 1994's payroll expansion to 3.5 million, over a million more than in 1993 and the strongest in a decade.

Though American jazz musicians moved to Paris early on, and were performing there by 1919, it was after World War II that jazz blended with existentialism and was imported to the United States through film with a European beat sophistication.",1995-01-15T05:00:00+0000

Timeless, Trendy or Both?","WHAT: Anodized aluminum furniture designed and made by Warren McArthur between 1929 and 1941 (in Los Angeles, Rome, N.Y., and Bantam, Conn.). These machine-age artifacts, forgotten for decades, have a small but devoted following. But recent exposure has made them hip, threatening their cult status.DANKESCHON: Last summer in Germany, both Der Spiegel and Manner Vogue published lavishly illustrated articles on McArthur, who died in 1961. Stylists and magazine editors in the United States featured the Art Deco furnishings as props in fashion layouts and in such fall and winter catalogues as Neiman Marcus's. Stuart Parr, the top McArthur furniture dealer in this country, is quick to assert that the furniture is classic and should not be considered trendy. ""This furniture is timeless, and that's what makes it an icon,"" said Mr. Parr, whose gallery is in TriBeCa. ""Just because it shows up in some fashion magazines doesn't mean it's cool all of a sudden. It's been cool for the last 60 years.""NUTS AND BOLTS: Unlike other metal furniture, McArthur's has no spot welds. Instead, a complex infrastructure of threaded tension rods lies inside the segmented tubular frame. The tension rods are connected at right angles within the furniture's ring joints. This patented construction allowed easy assembly, gave the frame increased rigidity and made repairs routine.BAUHAUS BUSTER: McArthur's design philosophy was strictly opposed to that of the Bauhaus, the prevailing design esthetic filtering over from Europe. Unlike contemporaries like Le Corbusier and Marcel Breuer -- who advocated sleek, chrome-plated lines -- McArthur chose to work with a lusterless material and emphasized, rather than concealed, his furniture's connecting elements. MILITARY INTELLIGENCE Because aluminum was needed for the construction of airplanes in World War II, it was declared a strategically important material by the United States Government. As a result, most of McArthur's prewar furniture was melted down for the war effort (which explains the furniture's rarity today). Using his expertise in tubular aluminum, McArthur retooled his assembly line in 1941 and manufactured 80 percent of all the seats in American bombers.MAD ABOUT McARTHUR: Valentino, Annie Leibovitz, Bruce Weber, Mick Jagger, Nicole Miller, Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe and Marlene Dietrich.DOES THAT INCLUDE DELIVERY? In June 1993, Sotheby's auctioned a McArthur armchair (made around 1935, in the designer's ""golden period"") for $8,050. Six months later, a vanity and chair sold at Christie's for $9,000. FAB FAKES: Classicon, a furniture company in Munich, Germany, that specializes in authorized reproductions, has issued a nine-piece line of McArthur furniture. Prices range from $500 for a side chair to $5,000 for a three-section couch.RENE CHUN",1995-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,What They Overcame,"For those of us who have forgotten, Flip Schulke's HE HAD A DREAM: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement (Norton, cloth, $39.95; paper, $19.95) will jog painful memories of the South in the 1960's; for the generation that never experienced it, it will provide a moving lesson on this nation's struggle for racial justice. No master of the written word, Mr. Schulke is instead an insightful photographer whose shots transcend his sometimes sentimental and awkward prose. Mr. Schulke, a veteran photojournalist, makes the atmosphere -- the despair and the exhilaration -- palpable in his images, which begin with King's funeral in 1968, then backtrack to the 1963 funeral of Medgar Evers, whose death, Mr. Schulke writes, was ""the first murder of a black civil rights leader the media had paid any attention to."" The iconography of the civil rights movement is hauntingly familiar: beefy, helmeted police officers and sheriffs' deputies, nightsticks at the ready, lips tight and implacable; demonstrators, black and white, seemingly fixed in time and place by their dedication to the cause of equal rights. Mr. Schulke frequently compromised his credentials as an impartial observer; even King once rebuked him with the warning, ""You have to stay back and not listen to your guts."" His dislike of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace became so intense, Mr. Schulke writes, that he felt compelled to turn down magazine assignments about him. His pictures of Federal marshals, armed segregationists and protesters illustrate his recollections of tear gas, Molotov cocktails and sniper bullets. This is the third book Mr. Schulke has produced about King, with whom his relationship sounds intimate and genuine. ""He'd give you a hug,"" Mr. Schulke writes, ""and you would die for the man.""

The author analyzes the foreign policy known as Ost politik, in which the former West Germany adopted an attitude of conciliation and rapprochement toward its Eastern neighbor. Examining how West German actions, which included paying large sums of money for the exchange of political prisoners, may have hindered the collapse of Communism, he has written a work that ""ranks among the most important books on recent international history,"" V. R. Berghahn said here in 1993. CROSSING THE RIVER By Caryl Phillips. Vintage International, $11. This novel explores the African diaspora from the viewpoints of several characters: an educated freed slave in the 1840's, a beleaguered black American cook during the years of westward expansion, an 18th-century captain of a slave trading ship and a lonely white Englishwoman who falls in love with a black American soldier during World War II. Last year our reviewer, Janet Burroway, praised its ""brilliantly coherent vision of two and a half centuries."" The same publisher has also reissued Mr. Phillips's 1986 novel, A STATE OF INDEPENDENCE ($10), about a black man who returns to the Caribbean island of his birth after 20 years in England. Once home, he encounters bitterness and change. The result is ""a calypso . . . a moral played out with a lilting absence of moralism,"" one critic said.",1995-01-15T05:00:00+0000
us,Business Diary: January 8-13,"THE ECONOMY There Was Nothing to Inflate but Fear of Inflation Itself Inflation, inflation, inflation -- that's all we heard about last year. Dire warnings, hand-wringings -- and, of course, repeated Federal Reserve interest-rate increases to head it off. But when the final '94 numbers came in last week, one couldn't help wondering what all the fuss was about. Dread inflation, as measured by consumer prices, was a puny 2.7 percent for the year -- the fourth straight year under 3 percent. With one exception, in fact, that was the lowest rate in three decades. And there were signs that the mighty economy was slowing, too. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales had slumped unexpectedly in December -- and, a bigger surprise, that November was weaker than first reported. This was taken as a sign that the Fed might hold off on future rate increases, and stocks and bonds roared ahead. Oh, Yes: The Minimum Wage It's often hard to tell Democrats from Republicans these days -- from the silvery wads of hair atop Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich to those near-unison tax and welfare cantatas. But one issue survives: the minimum wage. Mr. Clinton, campaigner, vowed to raise it; Mr. Clinton, President, shelved it as he took that messy health care detour. Now it's back. Al Gore and Richard Gephardt (who calls it ""a metaphor for the differences"" between the parties) want to raise the wage, whose buying power is slipping mercilessly, while Dick Armey, House majority leader, wants to scrap the wage floor entirely. The case for keeping it at $4.25: raising it would mean wide job losses, and most low-wage workers are teen-agers, not breadwinners. Economists beg to differ: their studies predict negligible job losses, and show that just a third of four million minimum-wage earners are teen-agers; nearly half provide vital family support. California Takes a Bath Merrill Lynch and Orange County lobbed grenades back and forth last week in their billion-dollar blame game. First Merrill released letters showing that it had warned the county in 1992 that it was playing with fire with its explosive investment fund. Then the county sued Merrill for $2 billion, saying the firm had misrepresented the securities -- that it was illegal to buy them anyway. Merrill's response: the county was glad to get hefty returns for years, but now, ""in effect, they're saying, 'Heads we win, tails you lose.' "" . . . As this was unfolding, the gods got impatient with all the finger-pointing and unleashed 40 days' and 40 nights' worth of rain on the entire state (all in just a few days). Hit the Ice, Already! With football nearing its orgasmic finale and baseball a fuzzy memory, sports addicts who suffer post-Super Bowl withdrawal faced the horrifying prospect of having only basketball to distract them. (Sports pages would probably soon be reporting basement Ping-Pong games.) But last week it appeared that there'd be a hockey season after all. The settlement was grumpy, though -- both union and management were so dissatisfied, there wasn't even a public handshake. Greenspan Has a Better Way As the battle raged last week over that bit of mandated morality known as a balanced-budget amendment, Alan Greenspan unexpectedly offered to toss $150 billion into the kitty. The Government, he insists, could save that much over five years if it would just calculate inflation more carefully. The price index, he says, exaggerates inflation by 0.5 to 1.5 points, and since so many payments are tied to inflation -- Social Security, pensions, some union wages -- billions go out needlessly. Republicans liked the idea, though it does involve treading on that sacred ground called Social Security, while Democrats didn't waver from their demand that would-be budget-balancers ""show us the fine print,"" as Richard Gephardt put it. Jobs, in Black and White ""Economic recovery"" -- those are empty words to most blacks. While the rosy numbers pile up -- on unemployment, say, or consumer prices -- blacks, as usual, are left far behind. There's been a breakthrough of sorts, for recent data show that the unemployment rate for blacks just dipped below 10 percent for the first time since 1974. It's probably just a statistical breakthrough, though, for if you scratch job numbers even slightly you see that they count only those looking for work, not those discouraged long ago. After all, just 24 percent of black youths are working, and 49 percent of whites. INTERNATIONAL Resolved: To Help Mexico Democrats and Republicans were in clear agreement last week: they wanted a quick end to the Mexican crisis. That $18 billion credit line announced over a week ago clearly didn't do the trick, as both the peso and Mexican stocks kept falling. So the White House, with quick support from Congressional Republicans, came up with a big package of loan guarantees (it didn't give numbers, though estimates put it as high as $40 billion). And -- this was vital -- the move, involving loans, didn't open up any hornets' nests by adding to the budget back home. One thing in peril, of course, is the success of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- if the peso stays weak, there'll be precious few exports to Mexico. Hail the Conquering Apple! Life without apples, some say, is not worth living -- though the Japanese have somehow muddled through. With a good apple costing up to $6 in Japan, they've been treasured gifts, not daily fare. But salvation has arrived -- greeted by thankful hordes. Japan, never known to open its markets lightly, lifted import restrictions a quarter century ago -- in theory. In fact, it has kept foreign apples out all these years for fear that they'd carry disease (or so it said). But last week was D-Day for American apples, and Japanese consumers snatched them up in no time. At last report, no Japanese had been banished from their island Eden for partaking of this once-forbidden joy. COMPANIES Soon It'll Be the 'Gatesnet' Clearly, it's not enough for Bill Gates to be the nation's richest human, to dominate the software universe, to build himself a digital San Simeon. No, he wants the world -- and since his world is computers, that means the Internet. Last week he said Microsoft had plans to be one of the world's largest commercial providers of Internet access, through its Microsoft Network, to start later this year. This, of course, puts strong competitive pressure on Compuserve, Prodigy and the like -- and could also provide a great lure for businesses, now computer-wary, to make the digital plunge. Defy Microsoft at Your Peril In case there were any lingering doubts about Microsoft's software dominance, just look at Borland International. Philippe Kahn, who founded Borland in 1983, kept lashing out defiantly at Microsoft -- and kept getting swatted down. It was undercut by a Microsoft desktop-application package it couldn't match, and it was late delivering key programs -- all adding up to repeated losses. So last week, after months of demands by big investors, Mr. Kahn resigned as chief executive -- though he'll stay on as chairman. The next step: possibly a sale of the company, either as a whole or in parts. Golf? Not for Dr. Vagelos What do you do when you retire, at 65, from a mighty career? You could play golf, but that didn't appeal to P. Roy Vagelos. Dr. Vagelos, who built Merck into a drug giant before leaving in November, joined a tiny biotech company called Regeneron Pharmaceuticals last week -- saying, in partial explanation, ""I don't play golf."" Is this a rerun of John Sculley's disastrous sojourn at Spectrum? After all, Regeneron has lost millions, recent tests of one drug were unsuccessful, and its shares have plunged (though they jumped on this news). Dr. Vagelos sees more, calling the company's scientists ""some of the best I have seen."" What, No Dashboard Nintendo? ""Oh, reason not the need!"" King Lear thundered. ""Our basest beggars have too many cup holders!"" But did Detroit listen? Of course not. Back when Detroit held its head up high, any car worth its chrome had fins you could ski down, or some awesome number of ""horses."" But drivers barely drive these days -- they're so busy talking on the car phone, playing a CD, drinking coffee. So at the Auto Show in Detroit last week, the big news was things like cup holders -- G.M.'s mini-vans have 14 (14!) of them -- and his-and-hers climate controls. All, in the words of Robert Eaton, Chrysler's chairman, to give drivers ""things they don't even know they want."" It's Chrysler's fault, of course -- it started the Great Cup Holder War when, a decade ago, it popularized those family-rooms-on-wheels called mini-vans. A Statement That Refreshes Is Coca-Cola trying to buy Quaker Oats? Opinions vary. Dan Dorfman, of CNBC, says it is. Investors went along, sending Quaker's stock up $4.50 on Friday.

Among the targets are the Goliaths of China and the Disney company. Chinese-made toys made the list because of Tiananmen Square, and Disney's Dolphin Resort in Florida is under attack because of an English-only policy for its employees. Zachary D. Lyons, the editor and publisher of Boycott Quarterly, based in Seattle, insists that boycotts can succeed even in the face of enormous odds.

Spence, at 61, is a retired terrorist. He is the father figure -- if that's the right term -- of modern-day loyalist violence in Northern Ireland. In 1966 he founded the Ulster Volunteer Force, a murderous gang that took its name from a private army of unionists that sprang up just before World War I to provoke a civil war rather than break from Britain. Later that year, after he had killed a young Catholic barman, Spence was sentenced to life in Long Kesh prison. Somewhere along the way he repented, turned his back on violence and, after 18 years, was released. To the extremists he's still a revered figure.",1995-01-15T05:00:00+0000

The technique is common in Switzerland and Japan, he said, and is a cheaper alternative to wallpaper: it costs about $650 for an 8-by-10-foot room. ""It is perfect for decaying Manhattan apartments,"" he said, because the textured finish ""heals and smooths"" cracked, uneven plaster walls, without expensive prep work.

There is no music. There is no catwalk -- only a white-muslin path laid down for the models, who parade quietly, each bearing a small card announcing the number of the outfit she is wearing. The editors and buyers inspect the placement of the darts, the tracery of the seams, the weave of the fabric at such close range that they could touch the clothes. It would be hard to imagine a more prosaic presentation -- lacking in fantasy, lacking in theater. The fantasy and the theater would come into play later, in the pages of the magazines, as the editors and photographers interpreted the clothes for their readers, taking the raw material of fashion and turning it into entertainment.",1995-01-22T05:00:00+0000

us,"For the Mane, Of Course","TRIGGER, WHO DOES YOUR HAIR? For a silkier, thicker mane, men and women are lathering up with shampoo and conditioner designed for coarse equine hair. The leading brand, Mane 'n Tail, once available only in horse specialty and feed shops, now sells 95 percent of its product to tail-deprived humans. Four factories work double shifts to fill orders, and annual sales reached $60 million last year (up from $500,000 in 1989). A PHENOMENON IS SIRED: Barely four years ago, Roger Dunavant, the president of Straight Arrow in Bethlehem, Pa., the maker of Mane 'n Tail, handed out samples to horse folk; they told him what a nice job the concoction did on their hair. Soon after, a market study found that 10 of 12 buyers were not using it on their ponies. A LEGAL HORSE RACE: To protect its good mane, Mr. Dunavant has sued 12 companies and accused them of misappropriating the Mane 'n Tail moniker. Dick Kaitz, the executive vice president of Palm Beach Products, makers of Lucky Kentucky Mane, Tail and Body Shampoo, said the charges were baseless: ""They were turned down for a trademark for Mane 'n Tail. We had a legal opinion that gave us the go-ahead."" A BUCKET JOB: Instructions from the Mane 'n Tail bottle: ""Add 1 oz. per gallon of warm water into a bucket. Pre-wet the coat with just water to remove excessive, loose dirt. Apply shampoo solution with a sponge or massage until a rich lather appears."" Directions on two new packaged-for-humans lines, Equenne and Conceived by Nature, indicate a little dab of the viscous shampoo will do ya, and forget the bucket. IT ISN'T PRELL, BUT . . .: John Fish, Kmart's hair-care buyer, said customers had requested Mane 'n Tail before he stocked the shelves of the chain's 2,350 stores with it. ""We tested it in our quality assurance department and the information was that it was safe for humans,"" he said. ""It doesn't sell like Pantene Pro-V or Suave, but it sells very well."" A local price comparison found a 32-ounce bottle of Mane 'n Tail selling for $5.99, or about 19 cents an ounce; a 13-ounce bottle of Pantene for $3.19, or 25 cents an ounce, and a 15-ounce bottle of Suave, 99 cents, or 6 cents an ounce. CELEBRITY NEIGH-SAYER: On the ""Late Show With David Letterman,"" Terry Bradshaw, Fox's football commentator, confided that the equine rinse had grown hair atop his bare dome, a renaissance thus far undetectable to the TV-watching eye. Mr. Dunavant said he couldn't make such a claim, ""or the F.D.A. will force me to do a $50 million study."" But he added, ""I haven't lost any hair since I started using it."" I'VE GOT THE MOUSSE . . .: Now there are Mane 'n Tail hair spray, perm enhancer, mousse and detangler (all for humans only), as well as The Hoofmaker, a skin moisturizer that doubles as a fingernail strengthener.

For many centuries bazaars have brought together in one immense place religion, political power and the economic life of cities from Morocco to Central Asia. In THE PERSIAN BAZAAR: Veiled Space of Desire (Mage, $50), Mehdi Khansari and Minouch Yavari, scholars of history and architecture (and husband and wife), reveal the social logic underlying these magnificent structures -- in drawings and words, but most vividly in photographs that let one discover the magic cave that is a bazaar as if one were walking through it, assaulted by the sounds of potters, cabinet makers, farriers and merchants of everything from bread to gold, seduced by the odor of spices and coffee, dazzled by light drifting down from the pierced domes and scattered by brilliantly glazed arches and ceilings onto crowds winding far below among fabrics and carpets, donkeys and carts, dust and incense. From the public hall called in Arabic qaisariya (""Caesar's room,"" suggesting a connection between the oldest bazaars and ancient Roman basilicas) to mosque and seminary and bathhouse, from quiet terraced religious clubhouse to teeming caravansary -- here is the bazaar, made even more appealing by the realization that the global spread of the modern industrial economy has probably doomed this beautiful house of life.

The change conforms the accounting for all ESOP shares with the company's matching of employees' savings plan contributions.The principal impact of the accounting change on ongoing results is to consider as outstanding only those ESOP convertible preferred shares committed to employee accounts, to report as interest expense all interest on the debt of the ESOP trust and to report preferred stock dividends only on those shares considered as outstanding.As a result of the change, the company's pretax income for 1994 was reduced by $ 95 million, including an after-tax charge of $ 31 million, or 23 cents a share. The ESOP accounting change, excluding the one-time charge, reduced 1994 income by $ 28 million after tax and reduced 1994 reported preferred stock dividends by $ 22 million.The reductions in net income and preferred stock dividend requirements, and the reduction in ESOP shares considered outstanding of 8.5 million shares in 1994, have the combined effect of increasing 1994 earnings per share by 18 cents, excluding the one-time charge.

The latest in fashion for football trendsetters like the wide receiver Jerry Rice of the San Francisco 49ers is a small bandage worn across the nose.

Does that mean Mr. Rice and his teammates expect yet another somnolent Super Bowl blowout this evening when they take on the underdog San Diego Chargers? Not exactly. The nasal dilator, called Breathe Right, has been adopted by football players as a sort of nasal turbocharger.

I first read Angus Wilson when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge in the late 1950's. Nobody had recommended him: I found him for myself. ""Anglo-Saxon Attitudes"" had appeared in a Penguin paperback in 1958, and maybe this was the novel that introduced him to me -- or maybe it was a volume of short stories, or his first novel, ""Hemlock and After,"" also available in Penguin.

us,Business Diary,"THE ECONOMY Just Pass an Amendment and Call the Doctor in the Morning Look at those three little words -- ""balanced budget amendment."" The first two are truly frightening ones, conjuring images of Social Security slashed in half, crippling taxes, a decimated national defense. But ""amendment"" -- what a breath of fresh air that one brings. ""A change for the better,"" Webster's defines it, ""a correction of errors."" No wonder the House wants to tack such a soothing word onto the other two, as it did officially last week, passing the amendment by a hefty margin. (Next it goes to the Senate, where it's close, and to the states, where it'll take years.) President Clinton, in that endless State of the Union speech -- at 81 minutes, the longest ever -- did manage to challenge his foes on this one, saying, Yes, by all means balance it, but tell people how you'll do it. All one could hear, though, was talk of amending, not that brutal balancing. 1995's Tax-Cut Star You'd think Christine Whitman's middle name was ""Tax Cut,"" not ""Todd."" It's been her battle cry from the start, and last week the Governor proudly declared that she'd reach her goal of a 30 percent cut in New Jersey's income tax by next January, a year earlier than she'd promised. Never mind that critics say she's just shifting the burden to local property taxes -- her message was clear: local governments are on their own. ""Property taxes,"" she said, ""reflect local spending decisions."" And the Republicans in Washington are clearly fans, for they chose her to beat up on President Clinton after his State of the Union speech -- only the day after her tax speech. Mr. Greenspan Is Watching You could never accuse the Federal Reserve of not being ""vigilant."" For the past year, it has kept on raising interest rates, each time sounding dire alarms about a too-bubbly economy, even as inflation snuggled in firmly below 3 percent. So when Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, actually used the word last week -- saying, in Senate testimony, that various inflation signals are forcing the Fed to stay ""vigilant"" -- you could bet he was at it again. And Friday's report of a strong final quarter of 1994 could add fuel to his fire, even amid signals of a slowing economy. So when the Fed meets this Tuesday, no one should be surprised if it tightens the screws further. Let's just hope it doesn't make the patient scream, ""Recession!"" Super Ads?

For Eakins, photography was a tool for teaching, for visual record keeping and exploration, but not an end in itself. Especially when compared to his powerful paintings, most of Eakins's photographs are less than remarkable. However, the large number of female and male nudes among his more conventional photographic images -- portraits of family and friends, snapshots of outings, picturesque scenes and farm animals -- attests to the originality of his methods. Eakins loathed polish and, when possible, chose students, friends, even himself for nude models to capture the awkwardness of real life.

The trainer said the colt would run on the drug Lasix in the Swale Stakes on March 11, a seven-furlong race held on the same day as the Florida Derby at a mile and an eighth. After that, he was not certain about taking Mr. Greeley to New York, where Lasix and other medications are outlawed. Mr. Greeley set lightning fractions in the Hutcheson, running the half-mile in 44 seconds flat and the three-quarters in 1:091/5 before yielding as Valid Wager caught and passed him in the homestretch.

Pataki wants to deny parole to violent felons and change New York's sentencing system so it would impose fixed flat sentences instead of minimum and maximum terms. And last week he signed an executive order barring violent felons from work-release programs. The Governor hopes to avoid the need for more prison space by loosening laws that require jail time for low-level drug dealers. Connecticut abolished parole completely in the early 80's but brought it back because of prison overcrowding and fiscal difficulties. According to the New York State Division of Parole, it costs about a tenth as much to supervise a person on parole as to house that person in prison. Graphs show the number of parolees to parole officers, the number of parole violations in 1993, the parole budgets in New York and New Jersey, and the cost of supervision in N.Y., N.J. and Conn.
