The couple slept. The dream,As if aware of time, took itself from ancient Rome.And turned the couple into us, and we were home.It was years from now. A disembodied voiceWas lecturing, "" . . . One wonders if they had a choice.Experts tell us all we know is autumn came,And the summer heat continued all the same.Others go further, saying the heat became a form of hell;Thermometers stuck, the oceans rose, an ashen curtain fell.When it dawned on everyone that things were wrong,The end was on its way, and nobody had long.""",1992-01-01T05:00:00+0000

Subsequent Met performances -- 126 in all -- featured such famous Wagnerites as Johanna Gadski, Friedrich Schorr, Kirsten Flagstad, Hans Hotter, George London, Astrid Varnay and Leonie Rysanek.

Architecture of the Mind","Visionary architecture is constructed with ink and paper rather than bricks and mortar. Seeking temporary exemption from the laws of physics and the constraints of budget and program, architects have traditionally turned to visionary designs to project utopian futures, revisit lost pasts or explore the limits of imagination. BRODSKY & UTKIN (Princeton Architectural Press, Paper, $21.95) is a collection of 28 stunning etchings in the finest tradition of visionary architecture. An introductory essay by Lois E. Nesbitt, a New York City critic and artist, reviews the background of the two young Moscow architects, Aleksandr Brodsky and Ilya Utkin, and explains the special circumstances surrounding their work. Unlike Russian visionary designers of the 1920's, Mr. Brodsky and Mr. Utkin are dissidents, not revolutionaries. In place of the optimistic visions of the future proposed by an earlier generation, they offer a chilling critique of the recent past. Their etchings depict private worlds of fantasy hidden behind the false facades and dreary squares of an oppressive public realm. One of the most impressive aspects of these haunting images is the degree to which the designs transcend the specifics of the Soviet experience and touch on universal themes like loneliness and alienation. The two architects' etchings are visual parables for our times and affirm the continuing power of visionary design to provoke our consciences.",1992-01-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Designs for Laughing,"Explaining humor is a tricky business. It's hard to convey exuberance, surprise and mischief if you're bent on analyzing them at the same time. GRAPHIC WIT: The Art of Humor in Graphic Design (Watson-Guptill, Paper, $29.95), by Steven Heller, the art director of The Book Review and the author of several books on graphic art, and Gail Anderson, the deputy art director of Rolling Stone magazine, surveys the role of humor in design. In their anatomy of wit at the service of communication, the authors explain how designers use such elements as scale and type to amuse, engage and persuade us. The evolution of styles -- Art Deco, New Wave or the current nostalgia craze -- provides a context for discussing subtle corporate logos as well as outlandish advertisements. Mr. Heller and Ms. Anderson, as one might expect, resolve some of the difficulties of explaining humor by the copious use of illustrations. Interviews with leading practitioners of this difficult art make up the last part of the text, providing an anecdotal perspective that complements the analytic approach of the preceding sections. The designers surveyed in the book represent a wide range of approaches -- from the elegance of Paul Rand to the boisterous and rollicking work of Push Pin Studios. Underlying all humorous design is a sense of play and surprise, a skewing of the ordinary. Not surprisingly, playful design seems more common in shopping bags than in annual reports. The humor in corporate publications, as one graphic artist points out, is often a matter of getting away with something. The book's own designers, Louise Fili and Lee Bearson, clearly favor an irreverent -- if not raucous -- style, sometimes at the expense of legibility. Navigating these crowded and colorful pages, jammed with text and illustrations, is like trying to get a table at a hot eatery in SoHo -- it helps to have been there before, to already know your way around.",1992-01-12T05:00:00+0000

At that time, defying the Israel Philharmonic's 43-year ban on the German composer's music, Mr. Mehta led music from ""Tristan and Isolde"" as an encore.

The subjects are academic insularity and artistic arrogance, the assumption that words are more relevant than actions or emotions.

Dr. Lyne and his colleagues at the University of Manchester in England study radio signals emanating from the spinning core of a collapsed star 30,000 light-years away. They found fluctations every six months and assumed they were caused by the gravity of an orbiting planet. But they had apparently failed to compensate for variations in Earth's orbit around the sun. Once this was taken into account, Dr. Lyne said, the ""planet just evaporated.""

Mr. Papandreou called it a political vendetta, refused to testify in court, and boycotted his trial. Last week, a 13-judge tribunal acquitted him of four charges that together could have put him into prison for life.

They are accompanied by the scholar Bernard McCabe's useful and informative chronology and introductory essay, and paired with exceedingly well-chosen extracts from Yeats's poetry, memoirs, essays and plays.

Shooting Stars","Although it resembles an unlikely all-star party where Louis Armstrong meets Jerry Garcia, Whoopi Goldberg giggles in a milk bath and Keith Haring paints a whole room -- and himself -- with graffiti, ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: Photographs, 1970-1990 (HarperCollins, $60) serves the serious purpose of confirming its creator's place as our day's most gifted photographer of the stars. From the gritty black-and-whites of her days at Rolling Stone to the crisp, explosive color photographs she favors for Vanity Fair, whether in pure camp or in utter seriousness, Ms. Leibovitz seems ever able to achieve the combination of glamour, intimacy and wit we demand of celebrity pictures. Her concern for intimacy and setting is evident in the early photographs of her mother, and her ability to turn icons of high culture into pop figures seems to have begun in 1974, with her pictures of Tennessee Williams. In her later work, men often appear quite vulnerable -- Willem Dafoe's bare chest looks fragile, not virile, and Michael Jackson, facing a mirror, seems overcome by pain. Women, on the other hand, frequently have an air of authority, defiance or mischief about them: Twyla Tharp and Jessye Norman become regal in black and white close-ups, while the shots of Bette Midler in a sea of red roses or Lauren Hutton in a mud bath look very much like fantasies Ms. Leibovitz helped them achieve. In the end, except for the few photographs that achieve a degree of beauty -- such as a shot of Bianca Jagger standing, cigarette at her lips, beneath a plane on an otherwise empty runway -- the significance of this book appears limited to our fascination with the aristocracy of celebrity and to Ms. Leibovitz's success as the modern equivalent of a court painter.",1992-01-26T05:00:00+0000

Tomba nailed his seventh victory of the season in Wengen, Switzerland, with a two-heat total of 1 minute 34.34 seconds, which was 62-hundredths of a second ahead of the overall World Cup leader, Paul Accola of Switzerland. Armin Bittner of Germany was third, 85-hundredths of a second behind. Tomba, who also leads the season giant slalom standing, showed that almost nothing can stop him. A gate pole he uprooted fell in front of his skis in the first run. But he still was second-fastest behind Ole Christian Furuseth of Norway, who fell in his second run. On Tomba's second run, he nearly fell over backward at the top of a slope and then, near the finish, someone threw a snowball in his right eye. Tomba won the slalom and the giant slalom at the Calgary Olympics and is the favorite in the events at the Games in the French Alps. Accola now has 1,270 points in the overall standing, and Tomba 1,060. (AP) Compagnoni Takes Slalom Event: Deborah Compagnoni switched to longer skis and tamed a lightning-fast course in Morzine, France, yesterday to win a supergiant slalom, ending a six-year World Cup drought by Italian women. A two-time world champion, Ulrike Maier, was second, followed by Norway's Merete Fjeldavli and American Diann Roffe, whose fourth place (1:11.64) was the best supergiant finish by a United States skier this season. Compagnoni, 21, a giant-slalom specialist who usually prefers technical races to those in which speed is predominant, completed the 1.1-mile course in 1:11.02. Maier, an Austrian who won supergiant world titles in 1989 and 1991, finished in 1:11.46. Fjeldavli, whose best previous finish was a tie for ninth earlier this season, was third in 1:11.61. The women will complete their three-day World Cup series today in Morzine with a giant slalom.

Still suffering the effects of her wartime experiences, Naomi ""has to learn to trust again,"" in the words of one of the film's many meddlesome characters. So she does nothing but tear scraps of newspaper and clutch her doll, Yvette, until Alan Silverman (Lukas Haas) tries to approach her. Eventually, she will declare that ""Alan makes me laugh when I'm crying inside.""",1992-01-31T05:00:00+0000
