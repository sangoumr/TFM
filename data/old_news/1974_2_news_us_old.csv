Yet she didn't appear to be making fun of the audience, or of any target outside herself. Of course various directors channeled her tendency to caricature herself. But it's nowhere more apparent than when she sang Happy Birthday to John F. Kennedy in Madison Square Garden, where she spoofed her own style to a degree that was almost grotesque. There's also a bleak historical moment when Peter Lawfordgagging it up about her tardiness  introduces her as the late Marilyn Monroe.

us,CandidFilm Viewof Yugoslavia,"""Man Is Not a Bird,"" Dusan Makavejev's first film, was shown at the First Avenue Screening Room Sunday and will be repeated there tomorrow and Sunday with showings at noon and midnight. It was made in 1966, and it is by far the most original, intelligent, witty and important film I've seen so far this year, which is meant as high praise even admitting that January's movies hit something of a new low.Mr. Makavejev is the brilliant, idiosyncratic Yugoslav filmmaker who was most recently represented here in 1971 by his anti-Stalinist ""WRMysteries of the Organism,"" a collage of political and sexual satire, fantasy, porno film, musings on the life and teachings of Wilhelm Reich, interviews with Candy Darling (and others). It was a movie that I could either take or leave. The freedom of its form seemed dictated less by the artist's wide-roving imagination than by the footage he had on hand to edit into some kind of feature film.Mr. Makavejev is a bristly sort of director. ""Mysteries of the Organism"" was never given full release in Yugoslavia, and a year ago he was drummed out of the Yugoslav Communist party, not because of the film but because of some remarks he made to a German newspaper allegedly insulting Yugoslav war veterans.I mention all this to establish Mr. Makavejev's independence of spirit, which, in Man Is Not a Bird,"" manages to be both profound and rollicking. The narrative seems to be about a moody, middle-aged, introspective factory engineer (Janez Urhovec) and the brief, unsatisfactory affair he has with a pretty, much younger woman, a barber (Milena Dravic) who seduces him out of boredom. The setting is a bleak Yugoslav industrial town that, though beautifully and realistically photographed, seems as mad and fantastical as something in a dream.Mr. Makavejev is not particularly interested in photographing the real world, but in reproducing the feelings inspired by being in it, and since his is a socialized country, one can never escape an awareness of political systems and pressures. ""Man Is Not a Bird"" is less about the engineer and the bird-brained barber than it is a conception of life in Tito's eccentrically Communist state.It's a world where the citizen-comrade dreams of the good life around the corner but makes do with considerably less, which, according to Mr. Makavejev, results in certainwellemotional strains. At least half the people in the film seem teetering on the edge of hysteria or lunacy. A jolly scene is a workmen's nightclub, where an overfed stripper is performing mightily, erupts into a riot that leaves the stripper dead, off-screen. A jealous wife has a knockdown, drag-out fight in the market place with her husband's mistress. The sadness is that the husband is a crazy old drunkard and both woman long past any primes.While the engineer is inspecting the room he is to rent the soundtrack is full of unexplained screams from the street outside. Bits of a love scene between the engineer and the barber are cross-cut with scenes of a fight in a police station. At one point the camera pans up the nude body of the pretty barber, lying on her stomach on a bed, and lands in a close-up of her large, vacant eye.Some of the film's ironies are heavy, but mostly they work. A worker at a smelting plant skylarks on top of a crane to amuse his buddies. ""Man is not a bird,"" someone, yells. That is, man cannot fly, but Mr. Makavejev is saying throughout the film that man can, at least, try.Next to ""Memories of Underdevelopment,"" ""Man Is Not a Bird"" is the most sophisticated and complex film from a Communist country that I've ever seen.The freedom of style that was chaotic in ""Mysteries of the Organism"" is perfectly disciplined in this first film. It is so poetic and true and multi-leveled that it reminds me of the best prose. Not because it is literary but because it simply could not exist in any other form. It also makes me want to see two later Makavejev films that were released here earlier. ""An Affair of the Heart,"" which is also known as ""Switchboard Operator"" (1967), and ""Innocence Unprotected"" (1971).",1974-02-01T05:00:00+0000

With the weathered grayness of an Eastern college town in winter, the pinched and unfashionable block runs into the glare of the Pacific Ocean on the line between Santa Monica and Los Angeles.

Trailing the vibrant child to the porch, the tall, lithe actress, wearing a suburban paisleyprint blouse and black slacks, moves with a tensed grace despite the two heavy bags of groceries in her arms. She enters the apartment of the friendly young couple downstairs and turns on a small television set. Oh, boy, a cartoon! Vanessa squeals. Wow, Jane says, grinning. She leaves the girl there and unlocks the door to her own steep, redpainted stairway, leaving the door open for fresh air despite the death threats she's received in recent months from people who didn't like her calling some returned American P.O.W.'s hypocrites, liars and war criminals.",1974-02-03T05:00:00+0000

Now if, in the words of a sardonic old quip, a Zionist is a Jew who lives in the Diaspora with his bags eternally packed; or if, as David Ben Gurion once insisted, only a Jew who intends to settle in Israel is entitled to call himself a Zionist, no more than a few thousand American Jews are today or ever have been Zionists. If, however, Zionism means supporting the idea of a sovereign Jewish state in Palestine, then most American Jews have been Zionists at least since the end of World War H. Most, but by no means all. Once upon time there were antiZionist Jews in America, there were nonZionist Jews in America, and there were Jews in America indifferent to the whole issue of Jewish statehood.

us,"The Siege of Atlanta, 1864","The scope of this book is much larger than the title indicates. It begins with secession and concludes with the inception of Reconstruction; and it recounts briefly the history of Georgia and Atlanta from their origins to 1866. Fifteen of the 20 chapters, however, are devoted to the war in Georgia, 18641865, and the major emphasis is on Atlanta. In portraying the conquest of Georgia the author gives about equal attention to invaders and invaded. His principal sources are the published memoirs, diaries and letters of warriors and civilians; and by skillful shifts of focus from Federals to Confederates and from fighting line to home front, he permits eyewitnesses to unfold the drama in which they are involved. In portraying Federal activities, the author makes excellent and abundant use of the experiences recorded by generals, especially Sherman, by subordinate officers, such as James Connolly, and by common soldiers, including Elisha Stockwell and Theodore Upson. In presenting the Confederate side, he draws heavily on the comments of Generals Bragg, Johnston and Hood, and on the narratives of Capt. Thomas Key, Lieut. Andrew Neal, Sgt. John Hagan, Pvt.

The foundation and buildingup of the doctrine known as ethology is indeed one of the most important and encohraging developments in biology in the last few decades, and almost all their colleagues are likely to feel that the three new Nobel Prize winners have amply earned the honor. That does not at all imply that all biologists accept at face value everything that the selfstyled ethologists have to offer; if they could do so, it is unlikely that anything so universally acceptable would have much bite in it.

They have to pay off highway cops when their rigs are overweight. They have to pay off bank loans, and they consider themselves lucky just to be able to keep up the interest payments.Gil (Robert Drivas) and Hank (Barry Bostwick), the independent truckers in Joseph Strick's ""Road Movie,"" have all these problems in spades, but they are not destroyed by the big hauling firms, the banks, the unions or the cops. They are destroyed by a small, furious, frizzy-wigged, highway hooker named Janice (Regina Baff), because they are men.""Road Movie,"" which opened yesterday at the Plaza, was directed by a man (Mr. Strick) and written by a woman (Judith Rascoe) and although their consciousnesses are raised, they're also terribly tangled. ""Road Movie"" seems to be two separate movies that have had an unprofitable collision. It starts as a neon-beautiful pseudo-documentary about the perils of independent trucking in America today, then slowly evolves into a self-conscious metaphor for the role of Woman in Our Society.Janice, beautifully played by Miss Baff (who received great notices this season when she played in ""Veronica's Room"" on Broadway), is a first-rate character, a desperate, lonely, bitter woman who, in the course of the film, decides that she's degraded herself for the last time.However, when she walks out on Gil and Hank, after they've rudely kicked her out, she just doesn't slam the door, she undoes the brake on their rig, with results that are so calamitous they have no relation to trucking or anything else. It has the effect of turning the first third of the movie into so much landscape reportage.""Road Movie"" is the first film that Mr. Strick has made in years not based on a work better left in its original medium (""Tropic of Cancer,"" ""Ulysses,"" ""The Balcony""), and he should be encouraged to pursue this original bent. He's good with actors, and even though he's inclined to beat us over the head with visions of America the Ugly, those visions are undeniably accurate.The real subject of the film is Janice, which is, I suspect, the way the screenplay was written, though it's difficult to tell from all the early footage devoted to the independent trucker, highway life and America's roadside architecture. In her own gum-chewing way, Janice (who is the first woman I've ever seen to hide her money in her wig) is as much of a revolutionary as Nora Helmer. I'd have liked to know more about her than ""Road Movie"" ever tells us, although Miss Rascoe, a novelist and short story writer, gives her larger heaps of exposition to recite than can be conveniently handled on film.Mr. Drivas and Mr. Bostwick are convincing as two different grades of male chauvinist pig, but the film belongs to Miss Baff's Janice who, in addition to Nora Helmer, also reminds me of an angry Minnie Mouse. It has something to do with the little skirts that Janice wears, the slightly knobby knees and the awareness that underneath the fury there was once, very long ago, a sweet, cheerful, bright-eyed drudge.The Cast",1974-02-04T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Osborne 's Obsessive Luther:The Cast,"Doubt and dogmatism coincide almost as often as ham and cheese: When conviction wavers, a remorseful skeptic can wax more righteous than ever. John Osborne's characterization of Martin Lutheras a masochist ravaged by uncertainty, who was also able to stand the 16th-century church on its spiritual earis a sympathetic portrait of an authoritarian. Luther's own self-hatred appears as fuel for his determination to reform the church, and to convince Christians that no one can be saved by ""good works,"" but only through individual faith. Yet he wallowed in the suspicion that his own sins couldn't be forgiven.At the same time, this Luther remains disconnected from events: When the peasants who backed him and his doctrines began to fight for the abolition of serfdom, he encouraged the lords and princes to kill them off. And he, who had been racked by infinite religious and personal guilts, seemed unmoved by the subsequent slaughter. Mr. Osborne's, Luther resembles a motorist who precipitates casualties for others: While he drives undamaged, other cars pile up and crash behind him.The American Film Theater's adaptation of the Osborne ""Luther,"" which opened yesterday at selected theaters, does preserve most of the obsessions that blazed through the original. Understandably, the play was cut for the filmed version. However, some of the fiery Osborne language has been ironed out in Edward Alhalt's screenplay. Many strong metaphors and rhythms are lost, and part of the anal imagery has been purged. The Brechtian aspects of the play have been muted, and we're left with a conventional religious drama  hardly what the playwright wrought. Also, various key lines have vanished from certain scenes, only to pop up in others, and a minor character has been converted into a ponderous narrator. No doubt, clarity was intended. Clich is the result.When Stacy Keach's tonsure is bowed to the floor of a chapel or when he rolls up his eyeballs toward heaven, he doesn't persuade us of his devoutness. When the script demands reverence, his fixed eyes recall his catatonic performance in ""End of the Road."" But when he doesn't have to be worshipful, there's some fine acting afoot. He catches the focus of fanaticism, the hesitation and the doubt that permeate a defiant ego, the pleasure in pain. And he's gifted at sudden illness: when he bites his lip, we can sense the anguish in his gut. One of the best scenes is his confrontation with his father (Patrick Magee, who's very goodas are Alan Badel as Cajetan and Hugh Griffith as Tetzel). The mutual hostility and disappointment of father and son mingle with their concern for each other, their distress at getting on badly.The sensitive camerawork by Freddie Young concentrates on individuals at the peak of their most personal emotions within the stony ecclesiastical set. Yet the problem of filming a play recurs as it has in most of the American Film Theater's productions. In ""The Iceman Cometh"" and ""A Delicate Balance,"" it was absolutely right to keep the camera indoors, within the set. However, in ""Luther,"" the off-screen yells and screams of embattled peasants fail to convey the rebellion that's taking place. A few shouts and one portable corpse don't suffice for the whole Reformation, and it's worth wishing that there had been a crowd scene or two. Without any evocation of the outside world, it's hard to believewithin the context of this moviethat Luther had much of an impact, or that Protestantism was more than a hiccup in the span of history.",1974-02-05T05:00:00+0000

With 731 points (292 goals, 439 assists), he had emerged Sunday night as the leading point scorer in Ranger history. But he didn't need an excuse to move through the big city. That's his style, Most of his teammates, with their wives and children, understandably have preferred to settle in the Long Island suburbs, somewhat similar to their small Canadian home towns. Rod Gilbert's bachelor apartment is in the midst of the East Side action. He knows all the girls but he knows the guys on Wall Street and Madison Avenue, too.

us,"The Screen: Wayne, Off the Range:Stars as.a Policeman in Warners'.'McQ.'","Reactionary movies about villainous cops have been as plentiful as children's nosebleeds throughout the last year. But ""McQ,"" which opened yesterday at the Criterion Theater and the 86th Street East, is so much like ""Magnum Force"" that I'm awed by the nerve of Warner Brothers in releasing such similar pictures so close together.Before the credit sequence is finished, two cops are shot dead  which establishes the political climate of this movie. The police captain (Eddie Albert) snarls, ""With uniformed officers being gunned down in the streets, that smells like radicals to me."" Young men with long hair spill out of a paddy wagon, shouting ""Pig!"", and a policeman identifies them as ""garbage.""But Police Lieut. John Wayne discovers that some men in blue are involved in the narcotics trade. So he feels compelled to investigate the department itself. Meanwhile, his superiors are keen on curbing his feistiness  ever since he threw a man off a roof and that man's lawyers began ""screaming about civil rights."" Wayne replies, ""Well, it kept him off the streets, didn't it?""Like Clint Eastwood in ""Magnum Force,"" Mr. Wayne gets some eager signals from a couple of women; he can resist or succumb to them with equal indifference. The sexy dialogue over the Scotch ranges from ""Refill?"" ""Why not?"" to his telling Coolleen Dewhurst, ""You know something? You are attractive.""But Mr. Eastwood at his most languid isn't yet quite so wooden as Mr. Wayne. The latter's large, rosy face registers no more emotions than your grandmother's quilt. On learning that an old pal has been shot, his eyes widen slightly; his eyebrows droop a little when corruption in high places is unveiled; when Miss Dewhurst is killed, he manages to bang down the phone receiver and say ""Damn."" Still, he does convey some relish whenever he hits anyone.In this wildly undramatic picture, music and gunshots have to provide the gumption that the acting lacks. Surely Mr. Wayne should stick to Westerns: he's simply too slow to play any kind of policeman. Horseless in the streets of Seattle, he looks as though he needs a shot of sand.",1974-02-07T05:00:00+0000

This house was built by a wealthy Massachusetts landowner for his daughter in 1800 (he built another just like it across the street for another daughter.)

For a relatively straight and level road the Overseas Highway has its share of thrillssome natural and some manmade. It's a gorgeous drive when you're in the delightful gaps between the billboards, trailer courts and motel signs that have proliferated in recent years. Driving along the highway, particularly around sunrise and sunset, with the sky and surrounding waters changing color every minute and the sea birds diving for fish, I've always been seized, mile after mile, by a visual euphoria. The trouble is that a lot of other drivers react the same way, making the crowded, narrow road one of the deadliest in the United States. Experts believe it will take something heavier than a station wagon to cause the collapse of any of the 42 crumbling bridges in the Keys something as heavy, say, as a hurricanebut chunks of concrete falling away can leave holes in the roadway where there's no room to dodge oncoming traffic.

us,The Screen:' Last Detail' a Comedy of Sailors on Shore,"""The Last Detail"" is one superbly funny, uproariously intelligent performance, plus two others that are very, very good, which are so effectively surrounded by profound bleakness that it seems to be a new kind of anti-comedy. It's a good movie but an unhomogenized one.""New"" is perhaps a poor word to use in connection with the film. Like the recent ""Cinderella Liberty,"" which was also based on a novel by Darryl Ponicsan, ""The Last Detail"" considers the lives of career United States Navy sailors with a gravity that recalls the atmosphere of the late nineteen-forties and fifties, when World War II was still freshly won, Korea was being brought to a close, and Ike was going to throw the rascals out of Washington. In the years that preceded the political and social upheavals of the nineteen-sixties and seventies, ignorance still possessed some innocent charm.It doesn't any more. It seems frivolous and a bit scary. So much so that I suspect that Hal Ashby who directed ""The Last Detail,"" and Robert Towne, who wrote the screenplay, may have thought of their leading character, who is 20 years behind the times and only vaguely aware of the fact, as a lot more representative of many American lives today than the rest of us would care to think.This character, remarkably played by Jack Nicholson, is Signalman First Class Buddusky, a 20-year Navy man of hilarious and often unwarranted self-assurance. Buddusky and Gunner's Mate First Class Mulhall (Otis Young) are assigned to escort from Norfolk, Va., to the naval prison in Portsmouth, N. H., an 18-year-old sailor sentenced to eight years in the brig for trying to steal $40 in polio contributions.""The Last Detail"" is the chronicle of this journey, which takes the better part of a week and dramatizes the increasing desperation of Buddusky as he tries to show the young prisoner his (Buddusky's) idea of a good time. There's a desolate beer party in a Washington hotel room, where Buddusky gets the kid drunk for the first time and tries to cheer him up. ""Think of it this way,"" he says in effect, ""you'll get two years off for good behavior.""In New York they crash a Nichiren Shoshu prayer meeting and wind up at a Village party where Buddusky tries to make out with a pretty, intensely serious young woman by talking about the romance of the sea, while she would prefer to talk about President Nixon or race relations.In Boston, on their last day, Buddusky and Mulhall escort the young prisoner to a sleazy whorehouse where they introduce him to the wonderful world of sex by paying his tab. This experience, with a girl who manages simultaneously to be dimly sweet and a no-nonsense professional, is what finally unhinges the prisoner who, until then, has more or less accepted his fate.Mr. Nicholson dominates the film with what amounts to an anthology of swaggers optimistic, knowing, angry, foolish and forlorn. It's by far the best thing he's ever done. If anything it's almost too good in that it disguises with charm the empty landscape of the life it represents.Mr. Mulhall, by being black and playing a man who is as reflective and steadfast as Mr. Nicholson is errant, is the one person who gives the movie a contemporary look. In World War II, black sailors seldom got out of the galley.Randy Quaid, who had a small role in ""The Last Picture Show,"" is a marvelous foil for Nicholson as the ever-polite prisoner who, for a long while, refuses to share Buddusky's rage at the injustice of his sentence. Early on, he has admitted to Buddusky that he had had a scrape with the police before entering the Navy. Asks Buddusky professionally: ""Was it in the nature of a felony or a misdemeanor?"" Says the kid: ""It was in the nature of shoplifting.""Mr. Ashby persists in making comedies (""The Landlord,"" ""Harold and Maude"") that are never as funny as the treatments he gives them would have you believe. ""The Last Detail"" is his most interesting and contradictory so far. You'll laugh at it, not through your tears but with a sense of creeping misery.",1974-02-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Thieves Like Us':Production by Altman Illuminates an Era The Cast,"When Bowie, a 21-year-old country boy serving a life term for murder; Chicamaw, a surly, one-quarter Indian, and T-Dub, an aging bank robber with a game leg, escape from the Mississippi state prison farm, they simply amble away across a field to freedom. The time is the mid-nineteen-thirties and the local newspapers, ever alert to the possible appearance of a new Bonnie and Clyde or Barker gang, report the break in the most extravagant and flattering terms.Throughout their short careers as bank robbers, Bowie, Chicamaw and T-Dub barely muddle through while the newspapers strain to create bigger-than-life myths. But Bowie, Chicamaw and T-Dub aren't very bright. Old T-Dub, who's supposed to be the most professional member of the trio, is so swept off his feet by his love for a frumpy beautician with burnt-blonde hair that he puts his real name on the license when he marries her.Robert Altman's ""Thieves Like Us,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is such an engaging, sharply observed account of a long-lost time, and of some of the people who briefly inhabited it, that I hope it doesn't get confused with other films that seem, superficially anyway, to have covered the same territory.I think of Arthur Penn's ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and Nicholas Ray's ""They Live by Night"" (1949), which, like ""Thieves Like Us,"" was also based on Edward Anderson's 1937 novel. As fine as they were, this one is also an original work, limited only by the opportunities offered by the subject, and the style Mr. Altman has elected to work in.There's nothing elegiacal about ""Thieves Like Us."" Its feelings are expressed tersely. It seems to have been stripped down like a stock car, as if excess verbiage were another form of chrome finish. Nor does one get any feeling of victims cornered by society, which was one of the marks of the Ray film and a carryover from those thirties movies that possessed social consciences.The screenplay by Calder Willingham, Joan Tewkesbury and Mr. Altman closely follows the events and the tone of the Anderson novel, which was, of course, written in its own time, without being aware that it was, in effect, a historical novel.Like the Anderson prose, the film is lean, uncluttered, even though Mr. Altman's method is full of irony and contrasts. The radio is constantly commenting on the action, whether it's a ripely acted love scene from ""Romeo and Juliet,"" which we hear as Bowie and Keechie, his girlfriend, from the roadside filling station, are making their first awkward attempts to have sex, or a wildly inappropriate ""Gang Busters"" program we hear as the bank-robbing trio is carrying out one of its capers.Bowie and Keechie are beautifully played by Keith Carradine, another talented son of John Carradine, and Shelley Duvall, the wide-eyed Houston girl who was one of the few delights in Mr. Altman's ""Brewster McCloud."" I would have thought that young love, especially doomed young love, was virtually impossible to simulate in movies these days, but these two succeed with immense humor and the kind of tact that denies easy sentimentality.All of the performances are quite special. Bert Remsen, who has been in other Altman films, though I must admit I don't remember him, is fine as T-Dub. John Schuck, as Chicamaw, is extraordinary in what I take to be the film's key scene when, near the end, after Bowie has improbably been able to spring him from prison, he turns on Bowie furiously for having succeeded in a plan that Chicamaw thinks Bowie is too dumb to have brought off.Society doesn't destroy these men. The Depression may have given them a push into their chosen professions, but they are, at heart, so self-destructive that I'm not at all sure they wouldn't have wound up much the same had they been farmers.""Thieves Like Us"" is not so perverse and witty as ""The Long Goodbye,"" nor is it so ambitious as ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" but it is a more perfectly integrated work. It is full of things to think about, that hang in the memory like the details of a banal crime story on page 32, which, though read quickly, won't go away. Somehow you know that this happened.",1974-02-12T05:00:00+0000

The ""moods"" of these unheralded Americans may be unevenly documented, but they vividly sharpen often blurred visions of aspects of living that stir the mind and, occasionally, the conscience.A viewer's emotions should be affected most by Bruce Davidson's 32-minute, aptly titled, ""Living Off the Land."" As a muted color study of a father and son who eke out a meager existence as scavengers of a New Jersey municipal dump, it states its facts with unadorned realism while subtly implying the terrible imbalances that exist in our rich society. The grimy, laconic father; his oldest, teen-aged, equally inarticulate son; his wife and four other children emerge as a loving group and as proud citizens coping, without tears, with their dirty lot.""Lambing,"" the 30-minute film by Bob Fiore and Barbara Jarvis, presents with similar dedication a bucolic view of David Hinman, a young New Hampshire shepherd and schoolteacher, and his wife, that personalizes their devotion to sheep and a way of life they love. The focus is on clinical views of births, but the total effect is a pastoral vignette as natural and picturesque as the film's snowy landscapes.""Front and Back,"" a succession of postcards backed by narrations of vacationers' messages, made by Lynne Cohen and Andrew Lugg, is a clever idea that succumbs to redundancy. Another 9-minute subject, ""Frank Film,"" a collage of biographical animations by Frank Mouris, has been shown here previously. And also seen here last year is Joseph Pipher's 25-minute ""6344,"" a moving, yet amusing, record of a Fairfield, Ohio, family and the demolition of their ancestral home.These ""American Moods"" may make a slightly flawed film package, but it does captivate the eye and ear and is a tribute to the talents of some sensitive and perceptive movie makers.",1974-02-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Japanese 'Death by Hanging':Young Korean Rapist Survives Execution Oshima Work Brings Memory of Godard,"It begins as if it were going to be a solemn documentary about the horrors of capital punishment. We see the prison buildings in a long shot from the air. The narrator describes the death house as looking like any other ordinary house, situated on a small hill, and we cut to the interior of the execution building.The narrator tells us that the walls are salmon pink (the film is in black and white) and notes that it has toilet facilities only for men. He invites us to watch a typical execution, which is when things go awry. Quite wildly. The heart of the victim, a young Korean convicted of two rape-murders, refuses to stop beating after the hanging. The execution team panics.The prosecutor says that the man cannot be re-executed until he is restored to consciousness, but the doctor, who had intended only to verify death, is without his medical bag.The Roman Catholic chaplain says it would be murder to hang the man again since the man's soul, which is responsible for the crimes, has left the body. Meanwhile the victim comes to and wonders where he is. The doctor is dumbfounded: He's never before heard of amnesia after an execution.For about one-third of its running time Nagisa Oshima's Japanese film ""Death by Hanging"" is a surprisingly uproarious contemplation of the moral issues involved in capital punishment. The prison officials, prosecutors, chaplain and witnesses argue back and forth and pick at each other with a Lewis Carroll sort of purposeful, cross illogic. Everybody becomes nettled. Someone suggests that they call it a day. ""This kind of work has its failures too,"" he says, but they all stay on to straighten things out, sort of.""Death by Hanging,"" which was made by Mr. Oshima in 1968, was shown at the First Avenue Screening Room last Sunday, and will be repeated there again today and tomorrow at noon and midnight.It is the second Oshima film to open in New York in a week, and though it is less complex than ""The Ceremony,"" which was made in 1972, it is no less schematic. It's the kind of didactic work that only Jean-Luc Godard has ever successfully transformed into film, not because Mr. Godard is such a brilliant political philosopher, which he isn't, but because his brilliance as a film maker is irrepressible.On the basis of these two films, Mr. Oshima is certainly talented as well as hugely concerned and committed to the sort of cinema that plays an active role in its society. As long as ""Death by Hanging"" sticks to capital punishment, it is, in its absurd way, provocative and entertaining. But the film's interests keep widening, its methods become increasingly, arbitrarily Godardian (read Brechtian), until it reaches a point of total confusion.In order to be able to execute the murderer again, the prison team decides it must convince the man who he is (his name is simply R). They act out charades designed to make R remember. Involved are his identity as a murderer, as well as his identity as a Korean, a people long oppressed by the Japanese. Kafka, Freud and some other weighty presences are evoked by Mr. Oshima as straight editorializing, through Godardian monologues. One of R's problems is that he loved his sister, which doesn't seem to have a great deal to do with legalized murder and capital punishment.Some of it is funny. More of it is tedious, and a lot of it curiously old-fashioned, even though it reminds us of the great Godard films of the mid-nineteen-sixties. Extreme movie styles date more quickly than hemlines.",1974-02-15T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Crazy Joe',"It's only fair, I suppose, that an Italian movie producer should be allowed to participate in the current Mafia boom. Although that nonexistent brotherhood only got going when it got going here, the Mafia does, after all, have its origins in Sicily.Dino De Laurentiis, the man who gave us ""The Valachi Papers,"" now gives us ""Crazy Joe,"" a lumpy, violent, fictionalized biography of the late Joseph (Crazy Joe) Gallo, the flamboyant hood who was gunned down on April 7, 1972, at a clam house in Little Italy. The film opened yesterday at Loew's State 2 and other theaters in the city.At the time of Gallo's murder, his sister is reported to have said that Joe had changed his image, which is why he was shot. The movie, though simple of mind, is a lot more complicated. Joe's movie enemies couldn't give a fig that he liked to hobnob with actors and writers. They don't even seem to mind that he attempts to stun his associates by dropping the names of Camus and Sartre, though the way the movie presents him, his intellectual pretensions do prompt a few giggles.No. According to the screenplay by Lewis John Carlino, which utilizes facts of Joseph Gallo's life as put together in a story by Nicholas Gage, Crazy Joe was rubbed out not because he was a party bore but because he was trying to take over a Mafia family run by his former protector. At least, I think that's the reason. The way the movie presents them, the ins and outs of Mafia family wars are as difficult to follow as pre-World War I Balkan politics, though not quite so fascinating.Nothing in the production helps much. A re-creation of the 1971 Italian-American Day rally in Columbus Circle, where Joe Colombo was shot, is the film's one attempt at spectacle.In life, Crazy Joe was supposed to possess a certain amount of charm, but Peter Boyle plays him as if he were a dim-witted numbers runner. He's such a slob that the casting of beautiful, intelligent Paula Prentiss as his girl becomes one of the minor mysteries of the movie year. Could she have wandered onto the wrong set?Eli Wallach impersonates a Mafia don with as much conviction as is possible in a movie in which the aging process is represented by simply putting more blue into the actor's hair. Rip Torn, another good actor, is seen briefly as Joe's brother.The film was directed by Carlo Lizzani, who seems to have done nothing to offset the weaknesses of the casting and the screenplay, which makes a ridiculous gesture toward black film audiences by inflating Crazy Joe's association with black hoods. Fred Williamson (""Hammer""), plays the black mob chief as if he thought the movie were really about civil rights.As movies go these days, ""Crazy Joe"" is not very long (100 minutes), but after the first 15 I kept looking at my watch, wishing I could hurry things along to the clam house.",1974-02-16T05:00:00+0000

As with his adored Toscanini, the years only make him more impatient and uncompromising, less willing to tolerate the mediocrity, slackness and spiritual wickedness that he sees all around him. In this new collection of his critical writings, taken from the decade up to 1973, he still stands on sleepless sentry duty, glaring out from his oneman redoubt in the heart of the cities of the plain. The world he surveys is not an attractive place, but at least it has a kind of elemental simplicity; the line between virtue and vice is sharply drawn. The good are soon counted; the ungodly are swarming there between his sights whichever way he turns. And any moment now they'll be put to flight.

Joy is indeed busting out all over the bookstores in a largesize paperback format, retailing for $4.95. Simon & Schuster reports the first printing of 625,000 is already sold out and another printing of half a million has been ordered. Crown, who published the hardcover edition, had similar problems keeping up with the demand when its first printing came out. They printed only 15,000 but the book took off, and Crown had to set up an air lift of copies from the printers In Holland. As a $12.95 hardback the book has spent 62 weeks on the list, usually hovering around the numberone spot, and has sold 775,000 copies. Joy is a compendium of sexual techniques, some bordering on the outr, if an ing is outr any more, and earthy, bawdy advice on a wide range of sexual hangups and inhibitions, all copiously illustrated with drawings of couples in Pogronte. On the title page it says edited by Alex Comfort but change that to by Alex Comfort. Dr. Comfort, a British human biologist who now lives in America and an authority on aging, did write the book but professional ethics kept him from advertising it.

Hardly a week passed without a speech by a bluechip executive on corporate responsibility or the new social contract. Then came 1970, a year of recession cum inflation, and many of the companies quickly retreated to the sanctuary of their balance sheets. Scores of voluntary social programs were phased out, like outmoded factories, and many of the hardcore trainees found themselves back on the street.

People mainly spend Mardi Grasthe name Fat Tuesday comes from the fact that you gorge yourself just before Lentwalking around the streets drinking and carousing, watching endless parades (from which float riders in bizarre costumes toss beads and trinkets to the throngs that line the curbs), listening to the music of marching bands and dancing if the urge strikes. Citizens are urged to wear masks and costumes. The last of the carnival balls are held in the evening but those are open only to members and guests of the krewes, or organizations, that sponsor them. Mardi Gras is sometimes called the greatest free show on earth, but visitors should not take that literally. Bring money. Many hotels, for example, require a minimum fourday reservation for Mardi Gras, paid in advance. For those who insist on coming without enough money, the Mardi Coalition tries to help by providing lowcost sleeping space, sometimes on the ground at Tulane Stadium, and minimal nourishment. The Coalition's legal services office (call 5045249315) gives legal help to the hundreds of young people who invariably get busted for such offenses as sleeping on the levee or blowing marijuana smoke in a policeman's face. Most hotels are already booked for Mardi Gras but some rooms are left. For information or reservations, phone the Tourist and Convention Commission (5045228772).",1974-02-24T05:00:00+0000

This film version of the theories advanced by Erich Von Daniken, the 38-year-old former Swiss hotel employe, in three successful books on the possibilities of extra-terrestrial visitors to Earth eons ago, simply evolves as a placid, postcard picturesque but unconvincing travelogue that sometimes captivates the eye but rarely the mind.The author, as well as the German producers who shot the film in 1971 (excerpts were shown on television more than a year ago), must be credited with moving about the remote areas of the globe to illustrate their clues to mysteries surrounding enigmas. The trip touches down at, among other points, Egypt's pyramids, Mayan temples, Incan cities, Baghdad, Japan and various Biblical sites, without really solving those enigmas.Wasn't it possible, the narrators ask, that the 14th-century frescoes in a Yugoslavian monastery showing what seem to be astronauts and space ships suggest visits from super-intelligent beings from outer space long ago? And what about the possibilities of other-world visitors to our planet in the dim, unrecorded past who could have left the know-how to build the scientifically precise pyramids or formulate the Mayan calendar, construct Incan cities, carve colossal statues on faraway Easter Island and Iay out what seem to be air-landing strips in remote Peruvian plains that pre-date history?Unfortunately, until science verifies the author's and the film's assumptions and findings, ""Chariots of the Gods?"" merely rolls through a succession of pleasantly exotic places while posing a slew of unanswered questions.",1974-02-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Film:It's Murder With Too Few Suspects:The Cast,"Murderous mysteries can't and shouldn't conform to recipes. But the omission of certain staples may frustrate us. Suspects are rather like saltyou need enough to season the whole stew, to enliven the range of the ingredients. Frank Perry's ""Man on a Swing,"" which opened yesterday at Loews State and Loews Tower East, lacks momentum because it's scant on potential killers. Out of sheer desperation, I even tried to suspect the righteous police chief (Cliff Robertson, nicely baffled)an exercise that wasn't fair to either of us.A young woman is killed, and the police are perplexedto the extent of waxing sentimental about the murderer. The chief, who never met her, carries her picture in his wallet; there's lyrical music whenever she appears in a smiling flashback. It's stressed that she was ""full of life"" and fond of swimming, and she looks much prettier than most after strangulation.Amid this bath of pathos, Joel Grey appears as a clairvoyant who's eager to help the police. He knows so much that he must be the killer. But maybe he isn't. And perhaps he's not a true seer. Still, as the plot disintegrates like an old shower curtain, it's a pleasure to watch Mr. Grey at work. That fragile ability, the savage changes of mood, the quietly ecstatic smile on the lemur's face, the thrashing body that relives the murder, his bright calm confidence in his giftall yield a fine performance. Sinister and timid by turns, assertive or uncertain, he gives the movie an energy that isn't in the script.George Voskovec is deftly shrewd as an expert on extrasensory perception and Elizabeth Wilson, as a psychiatrist, can convey more professional aplomb with an ""Ah?"" or a ""Mmm"" or the snap of her handbag than many of the garrulous movie-shrinks of the past. But Dorothy Tristan has a thankless role as the police chief's pregnant wife.All in all, Frank Perry's cast is superior to his material. We're told that ""Man on a Swing"" was based on a real case. But that's not gripping, since this is a conventionally made picture. The soundtrack is overworked, to put it kindly: spurts of guttural music or throbbing tremolos insist that a key turning in a lock or a ringing phone or a knock on a door are important. (Often, they're not.) And the dud ending is rather insulting. Why be faithful to facts that we don't know, especially since all of the characters are disguised? Invention and distortion and imaginationbad reporting, if you likecould have made a better movie. A thriller, in fact.",1974-02-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Breathing Life Into Cops and Robbers Style:'Busting' Stars Elliott Gould as Detective Hyams's Production Opens at 2 Theaters,"Peter Hyams's ""Busting"" is this week's new cop film and a good one for a change. It's not great but it's a cool, intelligent variation on a kind of movie that by this time can be most easily identified by the license numbers on the cars in its chase sequences. The film opened yesterday at the Cinerama and RKO 86th Street Twin 2 Theaters.""Busting"" is about a Mutt and Jeff team of Los Angeles vice-squad detectives. Keneely (Elliott Gould), the tall one, chews bubble gum, walks slightly stooped and talks in the manner of someone modeling himself on the hero of an Elliott Gould movie. Farrel (Robert Blake) walks like a man who wants to be tall and knows he never will be. It doesn't worry him but it makes him a little tougher than most other guys.Keneely and Farrel live entirely in their work. They spend most of their time arresting people who are more of an emotional than a physical threat to society: call girls, massage-parlor employes and the clientele of homosexual bars. Keneely and Farrel feel no obsessive sense of mission. It's just what they do to keep traffic moving, like street cleaners.It is one of the ironies of ""Busting"" that when the two detectives do get involved in their work, when they decide to go after the Mr. Big responsible for the large Los Angeles multi-million-dollar rackets as well as the petty ones, they get clobbered, both by the hoods and by their Police Department superiors who might, I suppose, represent the attitudes of the society whose servants they are.Mr. Hyams, who wrote and directed ""Busting,"" brings off something of a feat by making a contemporary cop film that is tough without exploiting the sort of right-wing cynicism that tells us all to go out and buy our own guns.It is also comparatively humane. That is, it acknowledges that when cops and robbers are shooting it out in public places, the bystanders often get hurt. When Keneely and Farrel pursue some heroin pushers through a late-night market in a running gunfight, the movie communicates the terror of the onlookers as much as it does the suspense of the pursuit. It is this level of awareness that separates ""Busting"" from the kind of junk peddled by most of the other current cop movies.""Busting"" is the first theatrical film to be directed by Mr. Hyams, though he has directed films for television and wrote the screenplay for ""T.R. Baskin,"" a movie that never stopped talking. The screenplay for ""Busting"" is a huge improvement, but it's Mr. Hyams's talent as a director that is most apparent in the visual emphases and in the performances.I suspect that the personalities of Mr. Gould and Mr. Blake, rather than the screenplay, are responsible for the definition given the roles of Keneely and Farrel. They try a little too hard for eccentricity but they're successful at creating identifiable characters.So, too, is Allen Garfield, who plays the Mr. Big as fat, edgy family man who simply can't keep up with the hip talk of the two cops who have set out to ridicule him to justice. Every verbal duel results in his losing a small bit of finger or the tip of an ear lobe. Nothing vital, but you know that more than anything else he resents his squareness.""Busting"" hardly overturns any film traditions, but it gives a little life to an exhausted genre.",1974-02-28T05:00:00+0000
