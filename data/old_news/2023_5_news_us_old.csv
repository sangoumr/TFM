Its a live-action/computer-generated hybrid that brings in characters from the worlds of Lego, Peter Pan, Sonic the Hedgehog and more. The hodgepodge style gives children a crash course in how animation has evolved over the years  but they probably wont realize that. Theyll just be entertained by the visuals. The plot revolves around Chip (John Mulaney) and Dale (Samberg), who, after being estranged, reunite in Los Angeles because their old friend Monterey Jack (Eric Bana) has been kidnapped. They team up with a detective (Kiki Layne) to solve the crime. Chip sells insurance and still looks like old-school 2D animation, while Dale has had C.G.I. surgery and pines for their glory days. The movie, directed by Schaffer, doesnt take itself too seriously, so theres a silliness mixed with some more elevated (as elevated as a Lonely Island collaboration can be) humor meant to appeal to parents. Its a fun, fast-paced action comedy, with Will Arnett voicing the villain Sweet Pete, a scruffy, potbellied Peter Pan who looks like hes seen better days.",2023-05-05T11:00:06+0000

The El Bulli Foundation, which replaced his restaurant, is now publishing more than 20 books about many aspects of gastronomy. Its part of the Bullipedia project, encyclopedic surveys and analyses written by teams of experts. There are eight volumes of intensely detailed books on wine, Bullipedia Wine Sapiens; the first two, Contextualizaton and Viticulture and Vinification and Classifications, have been translated from Spanish into English  subsidized by Juv & Camps, a venerable cava producer  and are now available in the United States. We examined many books on wine, even wine atlases, but found none that took our encyclopedic approach, Mr. Adri said. The books are designed for professionals and gastronomes, especially for those who are engaged in and appreciate fine-dining, which Mr. Adri contends is thriving. With Hubbell precision, the books examine the history, evolution, production, categorization, serving and appreciation of good wine, illustrating the material with close-ups of ripening berries, pruning methods, climate maps, bottling and more in the first two books nearly 1,200 pages. Mr. Adri and Ferran Centelles, the sommelier who covers the beverage side of the project, say they have made discoveries, like the first printed wine list from 1804. It is all, however, seen through a Western lens; the foundations definition of fine dining is limited  it does not invite Asian cuisines to the table, for example.

Since then, male artists have portrayed breasts as erotic objects, fonts of nourishment and sometimes both at once, as in the case of racy Baroque depictions of the Roman virtue Caritas as a young woman nursing her father. Bare-chested women have represented our brightest political ideals (as in the French Romantic painter Eugne Delacroixs 1830 allegorical work Liberty Leading the People) but also our worst transgressions: In medieval European art, lust often appeared as a woman with snakes biting her breasts, an allusion to their supposedly ruinous seductive power. Indeed, these humble mounds of tissue, as the feminist scholar Marilyn Yalom writes in her 1998 book, A History of the Breast, have long been the focal points for various desires: Babies see food.

After a sexual assault triggered my latent depression, I dropped out of college a semester before graduating. Over the next year, I grappled my way to the diploma. I knew I wasnt well, but I still wanted to exercise some agency in my choice of treatment: Psychoanalysis sounded smart, flattering my vanity, and the institutes had lower fees for patients willing to undergo what they called a full analysis. The phrase shares a certain boastful intensity with full throttle and full frontal, and the program  four sessions per week laid up on the couch  was indeed demanding. If I was going to admit I needed therapy, the most rigorous version was probably the best. So I signed up. Dr. S was beautiful, warm and almost confrontational in her candor.

us,Poem: wild and blue,"In wild and blue, the country musician and poet Julian Talamantez Brolaski has written a 21st-century troubadours lament. The poem begins with light and wind  fixtures of poetry. Theres the lyric sweetness of herons and mountains. Even Chaucers zephyr shows up. At its midpoint, however, the poem turns. The sorry state of the poet is revealed. The wind wont blow, or at least not yet. The poem ceases to fly: Instead its grounded in the dusty corner. The diction turns, too, from the poetical to the everyday, nearly antipoetical idioms of crying my eyes out and its no picnic. Sadness has done this, extracted the wildness from both the poet and the poets vocabulary. Then the kink in the light returns. (This poem was originally commissioned by United States Artists and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and appeared recently in a slightly different form in Shift Space.)

This two-act musical, inspired by a 1955 novel by David Garnett, pits a young man against his uncle in a tussle for the affections of a mercurial actress; it is a camp, unapologetically amoral romp featuring blithe betrayals, intrafamilial partner-swapping and questionable intergenerational flirtations.

Her ethnic and religious humor (she makes a convincing case for Hindu being the most chill religion) is unapologetically old-fashioned: quick setups, rapid-fire punchlines, her name in giant letters on the set behind her. Theres a genuine warmth behind the slickness. You believe her extreme pride in her daughter going to Stanford just as much as her operatic horror at the fact that shes studying ceramics.
