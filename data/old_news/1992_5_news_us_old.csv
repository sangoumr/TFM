And there on the wall is an autographed picture she signed for a Munchkin in ""The Wizard of Oz."" Another corner boasts the 1938 legal agreement whereby Garland agreed to promote Maxwell House coffee by saying the words ""Never before have I tasted in any coffee such mellow flavor, such real richness as I enjoy in the new Radiant Roast Maxwell House. . . . Yes, Sir! Here's the kind of drip coffee men really like.""",1992-05-01T05:00:00+0000
us,"Critic's Notebook; Early Capra, When He Had An Edge","FOR many people, Frank Capra will always be Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and Clarence the Angel rolled into one, the director who can make grown men cry at ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and political cynics cheer at ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" I'm more partial to an earlier Capra scene, in which Barbara Stanwyck jumps off a yacht in the wee morning hours, rows to shore wearing her evening dress, and is chivalrously given a ride by a man who will turn out to be rich (Ralph Graves). As they drive along the dark road, she says, ""Hey, you don't happen to tote a flask, do you?"" As if it weren't enough to defy Prohibition in this 1930 film, its title, ""Ladies of Leisure,"" suggests a deeper shade of disreputable conduct. Stanwyck eventually explains her less than brilliant career: ""Well, brother, that's my racket. I'm a party girl.""",1992-05-01T05:00:00+0000

A1 SCHOLAR AS PRESIDENT The new interim President of Afghanistan is a mild-mannered, soft-spoken former high school teacher and theology professor, a religious scholar in Islamic jurisprudence from a family of impeccable religious credentials. A10 COUP IN SIERRA LEONE Rebel soldiers in Sierra Leone announced that they had set up a new provisional government after overthrowing the President, who was reported to have fled to Guinea. A10 ANOTHER YUGOSLAV CASUALTY For many Serbs, the poisoning of Serbia's international image has been deeply painful, worse even than the steep plunge in living standards brought about by the old Yugoslavia's violent disintegration. A8 AN APPEAL ON AID TO RUSSIA Secretary of State Baker appealed to Congress that it ""absolutely must"" move quickly to authorize the Administration's package of aid to Russia, but was told that President Bush would have to take a much more active lobbying role. A3 SENTENCED TO HANG A white police captain in South Africa was sentenced to hang for leading a massacre of 11 blacks in 1988, But he may be spared the gallows because the Government has suspended capital punishment. A3 POWER SYMBOL FOR BURMESE Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader who has been under house arrest since 1989, is seen by her supporters as the most important symbol of hope in a nation that most of the outside world still remembers as Burma. A4 JEWS WHO ARE ANTI-ISRAEL A small sect of rigorously Orthodox Jews regards the existence of the Israeli state as a violation of divine will and are more anti-Israel than Palestinian leaders. A6 FEW GAINS IN MIDEAST TALKS The fifth round of Arab-Israeli peace talks ended with no apparent progress on any substantive issue and no firm indication of when the sides will meet again. A6 JOURNALISTS ARE ACCUSED Two Czechoslovak newspapers published a list of 376 journalists who are said to have acted as informers for the secret police during Communist times. A8 National A12-24 LOS ANGELES ERUPTS Social order broke down in much of Los Angeles only hours after the acquittal of four white police officers who beat a black motorist, Rodney G. King. The violence left 14 people dead, hundreds injured and scores of businesses torched or looted. A1 An attempt to save one store in a sea of violence. A21 The violence spreads to San Francisco, Atlanta and other cities. A20 Washington renewed its investigation of the Rodney King case. A22 Why did the beating trial's jurors decide as they did? A20 From Boston to Berkeley, fear, anger and astonishment. A23 Meeting in Atlanta, black police officers protested the verdict. A22 News coverage was hampered by violence against journalists. A23 A POLICE FORCE CAUGHT OFF GUARD The Los Angeles police were slow to react to the violence, even after its scope had become apparent. A1 HOPES FOR CALM ARE DASHED The City of Angels endured another day of violence, the smell of acrid smoke in its nostrils and its heart full of fear. A1 SENATE VOTES CAMPAIGN BILL The most sweeping campaign finance bill in 18 years cleared Congress and went to the White House, where it faces a certain veto. A1 A Senate committee voted to save two Seawolf submarines. A16 THE HOUSE'S CAPITULATION News analysis: The leaders wanted to look after the House as an institution; the rank-and-file members wanted to look after their careers. That is the quickest explanation of what happened when the chamber voted Wednesday night to comply with a sweeping subpoena for House bank records. A1 NAVY FINDINGS ON SEX ASSAULT A Navy investigation into sexual abuse at a convention of aviators last September found that dozens of women, and not just five or so, were assaulted there. But the investigators have been able to identify only two suspects, a result of many officers' refusal to cooperate. A14 U.S. UNDERTAKES TB PROGRAM The Government announced a plan to combat the spread of a deadly form of tuberculosis, including stepping up efforts to make sure patients take their medication. A12 NEW FINDING ON OZONE HOLE Scientists said that earlier fears notwithstanding, an ozone hole did not form over the Arctic this winter. But they said pollutants would cause the threat of such a hole to recur each year. A12 THE PRESS AND THE CAMPAIGN The bitter Presidential race pictured this year on television has been blamed for ills ranging from Governor Clinton's negative ratings to the scant primary turnout in most states. But it could be the news media that sustain the most damage if the fall campaign turns out to be another overwhelmingly negative race. A18 Law Page B18 The plan to clean up the Everglades.

It is a show as interesting, in some ways, for what it is not as for what it is. It is not, for example, a reflection of the commercial activity of the preceding season or two, as the Whitney Biennial has often seemed to be. Few of the artists will be familiar to even the most diligent habitue of the New York gallery scene. Nor is it an index of mainstream styles. Pop, Minimalism, Conceptualism, not to mention more recent developments, have yet to penetrate the academy's walls. It is, rather, a gathering of artists working in styles and with themes that would not have felt too far out of place when the academy's handsome Fifth Avenue home was built at the turn of the century.",1992-05-01T05:00:00+0000

us,On Beyond Zinnia,"I admit to being a tad Anglophobic when it comes to British garden books. Certainly the word ""Royal"" in the title of THE NEW ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY DICTIONARY OF GARDENING (Stockton Press, $795) seemed a rude reminder of the surfeit of marginal books that have drifted onto these shores. So it was a relief to discover the many native North American species among the 50,000 plants in this superlative four-volume work. Refreshing, too, is the inclusion of the common names along with the botanical, an index, an essay on American garden history and a comprehensive -- and comprehensible -- glossary. Also, tucked among the biographies of 175 of the garden world's notables are some of our very own heroes, including Frederick Law Olmsted, John Bartram, Charles Sprague Sargent and Liberty Hyde Bailey, whose glorious ""Standard Cyclopedia of Horticulture"" (1914) is mentioned among the inspirations for this work. The editor in chief, Anthony Huxley, the editor, Mark Griffiths, and the managing editor, Margot Levy, certainly have succeeded in giving more than lip service to gardeners on the Atlantic's west bank. And what a tremendous diversity of material here, with entries on genetics and potting mediums, conservation and kitchen gardening, botanic gardens and soilless culture, and a mesmerizing list of plant ""malformations or monstrosities."" I did wince at the negative tone in the discourse on woody plants in containers in urban environments. (But that's a classic canard, so never mind.) More important, and certainly most inspirational, is the editors' feeling of unmistakable love -- and continued sense of wonder -- for horticulture. No plowing through stiff, academic cadences here. We get our dirt-garden priorities right when, for example, after a nitty-gritty listing of genus, origin of plant name, family, distribution, species and hardiness zone, there appears an ingenuous observation in the cultural notes, for example that on one of the eight pages on narcissus: ""They are also excellent as cut flowers."" When it comes to gardening, only the jaded (or supercilious) take this rightful hierarchy of interests for granted. Two dozen superb botanical illustrators have added a sprinkling of delightfully informative pages of drawings to the densely packed text. So dare I quibble? Dare I yearn for those elegant typefaces and graceful layouts of earlier tomes whose tradition this ambitious work continues? Informative, up-to-date and awesome it is. Absolutely.

The $180,000 winner's purse catapulted the 26-year-old atop the L.P.G.A. earnings list with $353,354. Ammaccapane shot a three-under-par 69 in the final round to finish at 275, 13 under. (AP) Third Straight for Trevino: Lee Trevino became the first senior golfer in five years to win three consecutive tournaments when he shot a 67 yesterday to beat Orville Moody by a stroke in the Las Vegas Senior Classic. Trevino, who came into the event off victories in The Tradition and the PGA Senior Championship, averted a playoff when he rolled in a birdie putt on the 18th hole to negate Moody's birdie on the final hole. Trevino finished at 206, 10 under par at the Desert Inn Country Club. (AP) First Victory for Funk: Fred Funk shot a final-round two-under- par 70 to win the Houston Open at The Woodlands, Tex. Funk, who had been without a victory in four years on the PGA Tour, shot a course-record 62 on Saturday and held steady over the final holes to beat Kirk Triplett by two shots. Funk finished with a 72-hole total of 272, 16 under par, to earn the $216,000 first prize.

Using a vicious backhand slice, a powerful serve and a new full-court strategy, Graf got the upper hand early in the match, forcing Sanchez into repeated errors and moving ahead by 4-0 after 15 minutes. (AP) AUTO RACING Mansell Ties a Record Nigel Mansell of England won the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona to tie a Formula One mark with his fourth victory in four races this season.

Mansell beat Germany's Michael Schumacher by 24 seconds to claim his 25th career victory. (AP) Big Step for Allison: Davey Allison won his third Winston 500 at Talladega, Ala. The victory, Allison's third of the season and 16th of his career, clinched a payoff of at least $100,000 for the 31-year-old, who now needs only to win one more of Nascar's big four races, either the Coca-Cola 600 on May 24 or the Southern 500 on Sept. 6, to win a $1 million prize. (AP) SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING Fourth Championship for Babb-Sprague Kristen Babb-Sprague captured her fourth national solo title in the finals of the United States national championships in Oklahoma City.

The rate on a home improvement loan with collateral is about 2 percentage points over the prime rate; the unsecured rate, without collateral, is about 13 percentage points over the prime rate.

A traditional peasant house on the banks of the Kamenka, in nearby Suzdal, is partly masked by blossoming fruit trees that spring from a carpet of dandelions. Snow piles up around the Church of the Resurrection of Christ in Rostov, whose frescoed interior is bathed in a cold winter light. These are only a few of the romantic and gorgeous images in THE GOLDEN RING: Cities of Old Russia (Abbeville, $45), a book to make any Russophile's heart beat faster. The nearly 200 images by the Moscow photographer Vadim Gippenreiter, beautifully printed, are accompanied by an admirable text by the Moscow historian Alexei Komech that traces the development of Russian cities in general, and of each of the nine cities under consideration -- Novgorod, Pskov, Vladimir, Suzdal, Zagorsk, Pereslavl, Rostov, Yaroslavl and Kostroma -- in detail. Mr. Komech has further provided a clear account of how each building came to be the way it is, and of why it is peculiarly of its time and place. That many of the monuments pictured are ecclesiastical should come as no surprise: from the evangelization of Russia 1,000 years ago, city centers were dominated by great churches. (Suzdal, a town of 400 households, had nearly 50 churches in the 18th century.)

us,Spring Is a Good Time to Discover Fava Beans,"AMERICANS have been slow to discover fava beans, which are in their peak season in the spring. But more and more the beans are showing up on the menus of restaurants and in the produce departments of supermarkets. Italians, French, Spanish and the British -- who call them broad beans -- love them. When fava beans come into season in Italy, they are eaten raw with a sharp cheese like pecorino or sardo and accompanied by a chilled young Frascati wine. In Sicily, favas are cooked with artichokes and new peas in a dish called frittedda, which is often flavored with wild fennel. Fava beans are also good in risotto, to which I like to add chopped up crispy slices of grilled prosciutto. The prosciutto is much less fatty than bacon, which is traditionally used. As a side dish, favas can be steamed and sprinkled with fresh tarragon or sauteed with new potatoes and thyme. They go especially well with chicken, veal or fish.",1992-05-10T05:00:00+0000

The top-seeded Swede outlasted Stich, 5-7, 6-4, 6-1, and took home $166,600 for the 34th title of his career. It was his first tournament victory since the Tokyo indoor in October. Stich, seeded third, was trying to become the first German to win the tournament since Wilhelm Bungert in 1964. The turning point of the match came at 4-4 in the second set, when one of Edberg's shots was ruled good, although Stich complained it had been wide. A ruling in his favor would have given Stich a break point. But the ruling stood, Edberg held and Stich went on to drop his own serve and give Edberg the second set.

Yet one region, the Marches, is widely believed by Italians to be far less ""contaminated"" than other, equally prosperous areas. Situated between Umbria and the Adriatic Sea, the Marches has a long coast, filled with fashionable beaches, resorts and hotels. But if the coast is sophisticated, the ancient virtues of familial piety and spontaneous generosity may still be encountered in the sparsely populated hill towns a few miles inland, where the earth's crust rumples into hills like shirred green velvet.

In October of 1990 I bought an apartment for $260,000 and put $95,000 into the improvements. I am past 55 years and have not used my one-time exclusion on the gain. Assuming I sell it for $355,000 or more, would I have to pay capital gains tax? . . . Josephine Viscardo, Manhattan Answer: Maybe not. The rules for the one-time exclusion of tax on the gain for sellers 55 years of age or older require that they have lived in their residences for three of the five years prior to the date of sale. To take advantage of the rule, you would not be able to sell until October of 1993.

us,They Seemed Like Good Ideas at the Time,"A collection of articles and illustrations published in scientific journals between 1865 and 1900, VICTORIAN INVENTIONS (John Murray/Trafalgar Square, Paper, $24.95) intends to foster admiration for those intrepid Victorian inventors who laid the groundwork for many of the devices that define modern life -- electrical appliances, the telephone, the airplane, X-ray machines. But inevitably such high-mindedness is subverted by the inclusion of so many inventions that are remarkable only for their outlandish mechanical absurdity, execrable esthetics or bad taste. One rare gem is a machine for electroplating the dead. The dream world of the Victorian inventor was filled with the overhead clattering of pedal-propelled helicopters, miniature electric trains fetching fish and sauce from the kitchen, and prim passengers in bullet-shaped carriages free-falling from the Eiffel Tower into a pond. The illustrations -- replete with stiff men wearing top hats and handlebar mustaches, and women in bustle skirts -- are largely responsible for the comic effect. Aside from a brief and straight-faced introduction, Leonard de Vries, the author of ""Victorian Advertisements,"" provides no editorial comment. The book makes clear that whatever we inherited from the Victorians that was eminently useful, they were also responsible for the love of gadgets for the sake of gadgetry.",1992-05-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Living the Wrong Dream,"The former Soviet Union is chockablock these days with idealistic Americans and Europeans who want to help develop a new way of life there -- capitalism. In 1932, 25-year-old Margaret Wettlin traveled to Moscow thinking that, for a year, she could help to nurture a different social experiment under way there at the time -- Communism. The Soviet people's awakening to the sins and lies of the past, and their resolute public rejection of more than 70 years of the aftereffects of the Bolshevik Revolution, will almost surely save the energetic Western bankers, lawyers, social workers and do-gooders of today from experiencing what Ms. Wettlin did when she taught English in Russia, fell in love and stayed to witness a remarkable chunk of history that she writes about, simply and elegantly, in FIFTY RUSSIAN WINTERS: An American Woman's Life in the Soviet Union (Pharos, $22.95). In ""Ten Days That Shook the World,"" John Reed deified Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and for his unflinching praise earned himself a burial place in the Kremlin wall. When her journey began, Ms. Wettlin, too, was idealistic and eager, and she remained so through World War II, the beginning of the Stalinist purges, the arrests of friends. She married Andrei Yefremov, a theater director and protege of Stanislavsky, had two children and lived for a spell in Mongolia to better serve the cause. So devoted was she that she even willingly worked for the dreaded K.G.B. But the inevitable disillusionment set in, and her book traces the painful breakdown of her own idealistic dreams through the breakdown of the vast Soviet state and her own return to the United States in 1980. (Ms. Wettlin, who has translated Gorky, Tolstoy and Pasternak, now lives in Philadelphia.) Ms. Wettlin is honest, remarkably so at times, and because she is an American who lived through these times, she speaks in a familiar voice about a history that is usually too horrific and bizarre for an outsider to understand.",1992-05-17T05:00:00+0000

us,'Gray's Anatomy',"It all began when I was teaching a storytelling workshop in upstate New York. One of the things that I did before I had people tell their personal stories was to sit in a circle. There were about 15 of us and I asked everyone to look into each other's eyes as deeply as they could and then, when they felt that the contact was over, to pull away and go on to someone else. I was participating in this exercise as well as sitting in this circle across from this woman dressed in pure white, sitting bolt upright, blond with very intense eyes, named Azaria Thornbird. She was a new-age healer from St. Paul. I got locked into a stare with her eyes that was so strong that what happened was, her face began to melt: it was drooling down, like a horror movie. I couldn't take my eyes off her face and I got completely hypnotized until there was no face left. All there was was this kind of white light, this ball of white light where her face was supposed to be, something like an image I can remember from the Carlos Castaneda books. All of a sudden the white ball recomposed and her face came back into shape and the ball of white light shot out the window like a little white tornado. I pulled out of the stare and was trying to rationalize what I had seen by saying: ""Oh, I know what it was. It was the backlight because she was sitting against the window and the backlight had somehow taken over my retinas and blinded me temporarily so all I was seeing was the backlight instead of her face.""",1992-05-17T05:00:00+0000

The second-ranked German won this clay-court event for the sixth time, her 64th tournament victory over all. Sanchez Vicario, ranked fifth, dominated early with a mix of powerful backhands, net attacks and drop shots. In the second set, the Spaniard had a 5-4 lead, but Graf forced her into errors. Graf then controlled the third set. (AP) Courier Wins in Rome: Jim Courier lived up to his No. 1 world ranking by overpowering Carlos Costa of Spain, 7-6 (7-3), 6-0, 6-4, to win the Italian Open in Rome. Courier is the first American to win the Italian Open since Jimmy Arias in 1983. On a day when temperatures were in the 90's, fitness proved to be the key factor. Costa, who had already won two clay-court titles this year, folded after the tight first set, needing a dose of mineral salts to keep him going. (AP) AUTO RACING 5 in a Row for Mansell Nigel Mansell led from start to finish yesterday in the Grand Prix of San Marino in Imola, Italy, capturing a record fifth consecutive Grand Prix victory at the start of the season.

Brown's birdie after a 4-iron tee shot on the par-3 17th defeated Ray Floyd, Ben Crenshaw and Bruce Lietzke, all of whom were previous winners of this event. Brown, Lietzke, Floyd and Crenshaw finished the third round at 199, 11-under par on the sodden, saturated TPC course at Las Colinas yesterday morning and became playoff participants when continuing rain forced officials to reduce the event to a 54-hole format. More than four hours later, the quartet found a break in the weather long enough to start the playoff. This was the second victory for the 29-year-old Brown, who won last year's Hartford Open. (AP) Another Title for Housen: Bob Housen of Somerset Hills defeated Jerry Courville Jr. of the Shorehaven Club, 4 and 3, to win the Walter J. Travis Memorial Tournament for the third time at the Garden City Golf Club on Long Island. Housen, who won the title in 1979 and 1980, has also captured the New Jersey State Amateur seven times. In the morning semifinals, Housen eliminated Joe Sommers of Mount Kisco, 4 and 3. LACROSSE Maryland Wins Title The University of Maryland won the Division I women's championship with an 11-10 come-from-behind overtime victory over Harvard, while Trenton State College won its second successive Division III women's title, defeating William Smith, 5-3. Both title games were played at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa. DOG SHOW Terrier Chosen as Best A 20-month-old wire fox terrier, Ch. Cunning Santerica's Patriot, who answers to the name of Tip, was chosen by Edward Jenner as best in show yesterday at the 90th Fixture of the Long Island Kennel Club, one of the oldest sporting events on Long Island. The event was held on the grounds of the Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn Harbor. It was the first red, white and blue rosette for the dog, owned by Richard and Carolyn Vida of Sacramento, Calif., and handled by Peter Green. On the way to best, Tip won his third group.

Koeman, hugged by Coach Johan Cruyff after the final whistle, has scored all his 13 league goals this season from free kicks or penalty shots.

Koeman, whose free kick shot was stopped by goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca in the 11th minute, made no mistake from 30 yards when given another chance after Sampdoria protested the decision of the referee, Aron Schmidhuber of Germany, to penalize Giovanni Invernizzi for obstruction on Eusebio Sacristan.

us,Critic's Choices for Lovers of the Great Indoors; Film,"In five short tales set in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki, Jim Jarmusch explores that fundamental urban relationship between passenger and taxi driver. The result: the best American comedy of the year to date. Though not everyone can afford to take cabs, ""Night on Earth"" is far from being elitist, being as much about the working stiffs at the wheel as it is about the people sitting in back, who are often blue-collar too. ""Stranger Than Paradise"" (1984) clearly established Mr. Jarmusch as a director of note. ""Night on Earth"" also demonstrates his increasing command of screenwriting skills. It's full of talk, much of it as hilarious as it is oblique, which is another way of saying off the wall. Mr. Jarmusch's characters express themselves without self-consciousness, like Robert Benigni's Roman taxi driver whose manic conversation, including a confession, forever changes the life of his passenger, an exhausted priest (Paolo Bonicelli). Among the other fine performers are Gena Rowlands, Winona Ryder, Giancarlo Esposito, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Rosie Perez.

But simply having the credentials for a job is not likely to be enough to get one. Bob Hart, a managing associate at Foster Partners, a New York firm that specializes in career counseling, had this advice for job hunters. NETWORKING: The most important thing to do in an overcrowded job market is to build contacts through alumni groups, fraternal organizations, friends and former colleagues. OTHER APPROACHES: Respond to newspaper advertisements, be willing to relocate, follow up on leads from search firms and organize a letter campaign to potential employers. DURING AN INTERVIEW: Never criticize your former company or its management. Do not show dissatisfaction with the interview itself. Make it as productive as possible and evaluate it afterward. Do not bring up salary. It will come up in subsequent interviews when appropriate. Do not plead for a position. Be a good listener. Do not try to take control of the interview; it is a give-and-take process. Be relaxed and willing to discuss hobbies and such, but do not get so relaxed that you, say, show pictures of your children. Do not discount what executive-search companies or human-resource departments may be able to do for you. (Source: Foster Partners)",1992-05-23T05:00:00+0000

It was at this small progressive college in the Hudson Valley, where de Man held (and lost) his first teaching job in the United States, that he accomplished the crucial final stage in the transformation of his personal history: he abandoned his European past and started a new family -- and a new American identity -- by marrying one of his students without first obtaining a divorce from his wife.

us,Designs for Living,"Duncan Grant was a painter who worked simultaneously in a variety of styles and in different media, from printmaking and fabric design to ceramics and interior decoration. This often left him at odds with the English critical establishment, which considered his versatility frivolous, his wide-ranging production merely decorative. An intuitive painter rather than a theorist, Grant (1885-1978) was as distrustful of art-world rhetoric as he was of hewing to a single stylistic party line. He felt it was as relevant to draw from Giotto and Piero della Francesca as from fellow modernists like Picasso and Matisse. Likewise, he believed it was as legitimate to work out ideas on pots and fireplace surrounds as on canvas. Yet Grant paid dearly for these views, writes Simon Watney in THE ART OF DUNCAN GRANT (John Murray/Trafalgar Square, $55), a well-written, lavishly illustrated book that attempts to consider the artist's work in a wider historical context than that of the Bloomsbury group. Mr. Watney, the author of ""English Post-Impressionism,"" is noticeably defensive when discussing Grant's artistic strengths. He writes as if expecting to be challenged, spending as much time analyzing the reasons for the artist's neglect as he does building a fresh case in support of his work. Among the many reasons he cites for Grant's obscurity are his unorthodox career (Grant tended to double back periodically and reinvestigate old themes), his association with Bloomsbury (out of favor in the 1940's and 50's) and the destruction during World War II of many of his finest painted interiors. It is only when Mr. Watney discusses Grant's work on its own terms that his thesis beings to emerge: that Grant's equal attendance to all media constituted its own radicalism, as did his belief that art and everyday life were of the same substance.",1992-05-24T05:00:00+0000

He then heard a great noise of thunder overhead, and all the people crying out in terror. Something was falling very thick . . . it proved to be ashes, which fell to the depth of six inches, and increased their fears, by causing them to suppose that the end of the world was actually at hand."" That was in 1800. A hundred and eighty years later on a Sunday morning, May 18, I also was awakened, not by ash but by a mysterious boom. I was in Eugene, Ore., a hundred miles south of Mount St. Helens, which had again erupted. Television told the story: an immense mushroom cloud 12 miles high was raining ash across the state of Washington.

Increasingly these electronic locks, which may cost $250 to install, are found in budget places. The reason is that a metal key often has a room number on it and is easy for a criminal to copy or keep for theft later. A Holiday Inn spokeswoman said that the organization ""highly recommended"" that hotels convert to the key card when they modernized, and that key card systems were required for all its new buildings.

These tidbits make PIERRE FRANEY'S COOKING IN AMERICA (illustrated by Lauren Jarrett, 392 pp., Knopf, $25) one of those cookbooks that wend their way onto the night table for leisurely bedtime reading. Written by Mr. Franey and Richard Flaste as the companion to Mr. Franey's television cooking programs, it is organized as a series of visits to food producers, cafes and cooks from Puerto Rico to Alaska. Each chapter explores a different area of the American larder, providing details on food history, production and preparation as well as recipes. With this scenic approach, Mr. Franey, the author of the 60-Minute Gourmet column in The New York Times, and Mr. Flaste, his longtime collaborator, introduce Esther and Owen Vermeer, pig farmers in Iowa; Gip Redman and his Washington State cherry orchard; Dave Simon and his cheddar cheese-making plant in Wisconsin. And it is in Virginia, at a turkey farm, that we meet the sexers, workers trained in the task of separating the toms from the hens. For those who choose to leave the book in the kitchen, there are such rewards as cheddar tart with arugula, a light, butterless vegetable strudel and a fresh cherry clafoutis in a tart shell.",1992-05-31T05:00:00+0000

Do as they do, providing you obtain clearance from the Accounts Department first, and report back."" Mr. Mayle, the author of ""A Year in Provence"" and ""Toujours Provence,"" needed no further prodding, as ACQUIRED TASTES (229 pp., Bantam, $20) makes clear. His credit card smoking with constant use, he filed monthly columns on the pleasures of buying a pair of $1,300 ""hand-cut, hand-stitched, hand-built shoes"" in London; a $350 custom-made shirt at Charvet in Paris; and hand-tailored suits at Douglas Hayward of Mayfair. On the gustatory side, he explained to his readers the fine points of caviar, cigars, truffles, foie gras, Champagne and malt whisky, and reminisced about his favorite Paris bistro. Mr. Mayle is a writer who never fails to entertain. If he were told to go forth and write about doorknobs, he would return with a witty, perceptive essay in hand. Nevertheless, a few of the chapters in ""Acquired Tastes"" show evidence that the author had to strain a bit to fill out the required space. ""The Most Costly Passion of All,"" an essay on keeping a mistress, does not quite manage to rise above the piggishness of the concept, and the chapter on houseguests will sound very familiar to readers of ""A Year in Provence."" But Mr. Mayle achieves a high batting average, passing on his unfeigned pleasure in the good life, whether it's ""bespoke potato chips"" at the Connaught Hotel in London or ""the ultimate refinement,"" taking your stretch limo ""for a walk."" In the book's penultimate chapter, Mr. Mayle offers a tribute to New York, a city that taps directly into the ""lust for more and better"" that inspired ""Acquired Tastes."" As the skyline of Manhattan beckons, he writes, ""my credit cards tremble with anticipation.""",1992-05-31T05:00:00+0000

As the scales of familiarity drop from our eyes, we look on life as it really is -- or at least as it first appears.

And how much truth do we want to see if it threatens our holiday?",1992-05-31T05:00:00+0000
