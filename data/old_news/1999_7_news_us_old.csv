us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  PORTER, H. BOONE","PORTER-H. Boone. The Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-07-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Duck Before Entering: Mount Vernon Reinterpreted,"In a $1 million venture, the clothing designer Tommy Hilfiger and his wife, Susie, will build a playhouse in Greenwich, Conn., a child-scaled reinterpretation of Mount Vernon. The playhouse, which is being erected temporarily on the grounds of Christ Church Greenwich, will have replicas of six of the main rooms at Mount Vernon and a version of the columned porch. Allan Greenberg, the Washington neo-classicist architect who wrote ''George Washington Architect'' (Andreas Papadakis Press, 1999), designed the 325-square-foot playhouse, below, which will open to the public as part of the Tomes Higgins Designer Showhouse in Greenwich from Oct. 3 through Oct. 24. (The 1861 Tomes Higgins house, at 216 East Putnam Avenue, was the rectory for Christ Church Greenwich.) The playhouse will be distinctly child-size, with 4-foot-3-inch doorways. ''Grown-ups will hit their heads,'' Mrs. Hilfiger said. But children should check their chewing gum at the door: the furnishings are real. Hank Cochran, a curator affiliated with the Manhattan antiques dealer John Roselli, is collecting authentic accessories like the 1780 boy-size military dress hat (inset right) and small-scale period cutlery and Chinese crockery (inset left). ''We want the experience to be seriously educational,'' Mrs. Hilfiger said. No stranger to cross-marketing, she will sell unfurnished duplicates of the playhouse through her store, the Children's Shop, at 289 Greenwich Avenue. Proceeds will benefit the Children's Development and Educational Foundation in Mount Kisco, N.Y.",1999-07-01T05:00:00+0000

He was born August 2, 1912, in Hampton, NJ, the son of Robert D. and Florence (Servis) Petty. He was educated at Lehigh University and New York Law School. Shortly before graduating from law school in 1937, he married Marcille Littlefield. While still attending law school, Mr. Petty worked for a firm specializing in public finance and continued in that field after graduation. Following service in the U.S. Navy in World War II, Mr. Petty served as counsel in charge of the Navy Department's New York legal office and then put his public finance expertise to work as a partner in the firm of Mitchell, Petty and Schetterly. That firm ''handled the financing of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the Indiana Turnpike and perhaps twothirds of the turnpikes in the country'' during the highway building boom of the 1950s, Mr. Petty estimated. The firm also handled large-scale bond issues for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and many of its municipalities. Mitchell, Petty and Schetterly was merged into the firm of Brown & Wood in 1979 and Mr. Petty retired as a senior member of that firm in 1985. Recently, Mr. Petty became a member of New York Law School's 21st Century Societythose alumni who provided for the law school in their wills. Mr. Petty's will includes a bequest that would create the Robert D. Petty Scholarship Fund in honor of his late father, a former Dean and founding father of New York Law School. Mr. Petty was motivated to help future law school students by sharing memories of his own Depression-era experience. ''I had a hell of a time financially at the Law School, as did many of my classmates.'' He is survived by one son, Kimball Petty, of Little Deer Isle, ME; one daughter, Gail P.

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-07-02T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-07-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Subway Series,"Ralph Ginzburg discovered that while there is always something newsworthy to photograph in New York, the logistics can be a nightmare. He logged 18-hour days and covered 1,000 events to collect the images in I SHOT NEW YORK (Abrams, paper, $24.95). Ginzburg, a publisher turned spot news photographer, filled his 1995 daybook with images of nearly 90 publicity stunts, more than 50 celebrity sightings, 40 or so sporting events and parades from Pulaski Day to the annual ''Dyke March.'' His images range from the exuberant (a Spider-Man balloon from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade prowls the skyline in a wide-angle shot, and junior high students defy gravity in their glee at being let out on the last day of school) to the pedestrian (O. J. Simpson's acquittal is marked by a lackluster picture of the zip strip in Times Square). Ginzburg has a good eye for candids -- in one sequence, former President Gerald R. Ford picks his teeth with a fingernail, inverts a bread plate to look at the make and honks his nose. The captions, by the photographer's wife, Shoshana Ginzburg, occasionally lapse into tabloid tastelessness (a photo of an amputee is slugged ''Without a Leg to Stand On''). Ginzburg is not a master of the black-and-white medium -- his images are often indifferently lighted and printed, and lack tonal range -- but his book is a heartfelt portrait of the extraordinary diversity of daily life in the city, and of New Yorkers' love of bread and circuses.

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-07-04T05:00:00+0000

In a winningly matter-of-fact way, May describes her former life in London, dropping clues about Mum's wild life style, which sounds like something out of the British sitcom ''Absolutely Fabulous'': boozing and partying with her girlfriends, bringing home the stray rock star and simultaneously loving and neglecting her sensible daughter. Now that those days are long past, Lucy is mostly succeeding at being a good mother. Then along comes Rufus, a London writer who is seeking a quiet haven and who is being pursued by a glamorous editor who's more interested in him than in his poetry translations. As the children and Lucy grow increasingly fond of kindly, solid Rufus, May's playboy father decides to visit for the first time in three years. And that's the plot. Craze's skill is in seeing so clearly through a vulnerable child's eyes: the way it feels when your mother gives your new towels from Grandma to a guest, or when you hurt your only friend without meaning to. She also beautifully portrays the unspoken but painful rivalry among mother, daughter and son for Rufus's friendship. (Occasionally Craze loses her youthful voice, but not often enough to matter.) Snippets of dialogue tell a lifetime of stories. And the tension, which Craze manages to build with nothing more than a white lie or a misunderstanding, is so palpable you'd think you were reading a thriller. Having come to care deeply about this fragile bunch, you'll wish them nothing less than a Hollywood ending. Carol Peace Robins",1999-07-04T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-07-05T05:00:00+0000

Segments seen last week on a cruise through its middle sections, from Townsville to Cairns, have the look of thriving underwater communities, where reef-building hard corals and gently swaying soft corals support a rich array of colorful fish, sea turtles, clams and other marine life.

After Pearl Harbor he enlisted in the Army where his superior command of several languages quickly sent him overseas as a special translator. Refusing officer's candidate school, he remained a master sergeant throughout the Second World War, proud that his overseas stay-ofduty bars exceeded those of most generals. On returning to the States, he became Resident Stage Designer and teacher at Fordham University's prodigious Drama Department in New York, where he met his future wife, Maria Riva. On Broadway he designed the first production of Gian Carlo Menotti's ''The Medium'' in the round, having invented the concept of a scrim enveloped circular stage lit in such a way that, although appearing solid, was perfectly transparent for the audience to see the performance without being distracted by the audience across the stage. In the Fifties his award-winning, innovative commercial designs for television set visual standards still in use today. Riva became and remained a very successful designer and inventor of toys and board games, forming his own international agency to help other inventors.

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-07-07T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-07-08T05:00:00+0000

The man hooked a 40-pound bluefin tuna, then for 45 minutes was dragged on what 19th-century whalers called a Nantucket sleigh ride. The story struck an atavistic chord. I had an ancestor, Jesse Halsey, who was a Sag Harbor whaling captain, and it must have been from him that I inherited a mad urge to go offshore. Call me Ishmael or just call me crazy.

Where Kid Rock reconfigures rap for the testosterone-addled hard-rock crowd, the Beta Band remakes rap for fans of cerebral low-fidelity indie-rock (call it wimp hop). Full of samples, drum machines, beatboxing and gentle Scottish-accented rapping in addition to standard rock-band instrumentation and all kinds of noisemakers, this first full-length album by the Beta Band often sounds like a recording-studio party where instruments are seen more as toys. Rhythms are often punctuated by whistles, bells, cheers, trotting horses and sounds not unlike a cuckoo clock, while as many as four different genres of music are pressed back to back within a single song. But the talent of the Beta Band is that, like any good jam band, the chaos occasionally crystallizes into beauty, in this case very gentle, introspective pop songs like ''It's Not Too Beautiful.''",1999-07-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; How Green Was My Monster,"Boston's quirky little Fenway Park, the site of this week's All-Star Game, has been the scene of so many heartbreaks and dashed hopes that it is to Beantowners what the Bridge of Sighs is to Venetians. Johnny Pesky's muffed relay throw in the 1946 World Series; Tony Conigliaro's horrific beaning in 1967; Bucky Dent's bloop homer for the Yankees in the 1978 playoff -- the list is incised on the heart of every Red Sox fan, an unmatchable record of bad karma. Tear the place down, Ted Williams cheerfully advises in his introduction to FENWAY (Houghton Mifflin, $30), a ''biography'' in words (by Dan Shaughnessy, a sports columnist at The Boston Globe) and pictures (by Stan Grossfeld, an associate editor at The Globe). Contrary to legend, Fenway has never been a hitter's park, Williams says, and it is tough on fielders as well. Williams's opinions are not universally shared, but despite the efforts of some die-hard preservationists, the wrecking ball is almost certain to descend on Lansdowne Street early in the next century, by which time Fenway will, with almost equal certainty, be the oldest ball park left. Inevitably, Fenway has become a kind of literary landmark, inspiring countless overwrought threnodies and pastorals, but Shaughnessy's text is (by local standards) straightforward and unsentimental. Grossfeld's images are sparkling and upbeat, evoking not the park's gloomy history but its charming eccentricities and ever-startling greenness -- a place where it was always heaven to be miserable. A striking exception is some pictures of the dank, graffiti-strewn room behind the left-field wall, the fabled Green Monster, where the scoreboard operators while away their time waiting to post the end-of-inning numbers; they, too, are relics, among the few manual scorekeepers left in the big leagues, and their lair looks like a place where Quasimodo could cheerfully bed down.

He grew up mostly in Europe, later returning to attend Wayne University where his skills as scenic designer flourished. After Pearl Harbor he enlisted in the Army where his superior command of several languages quickly sent him overseas as a special translator. Refusing officer's candidate school, he remained a master sergeant throughout the Second World War, proud that his overseas stay-ofduty bars exceeded those of most generals. On returning to the States, he became Resident Stage Designer and teacher at Fordham University's prodigious Drama Department in New York, where he met his future wife, Maria Riva. On Broadway he designed the first production of Gian Carlo Menotti's ''The Medium'' in the round, having invented the concept of a scrim enveloped circular stage lit in such a way that, although appearing solid, was perfectly transparent for the audience to see the performance without being distracted by the audience across the stage. In the Fifties his award-winning, innovative commercial designs for television set visual standards still in use today. Riva became and remained a very successful designer and inventor of toys and board games, forming his own international agency to help other inventors.

She follows the nurse-practitioner into the examining room and lies down without being asked. During the exam, she winces and cries, making hardly a sound. But afterward, sitting up, her fingers laced together in her lap, she is almost talkative. ''Did you think about maybe keeping the baby or giving it up for adoption?'' the nurse-practitioner asks kindly. ''Yes,'' says the young woman, ''but I knew I didn't want to do that. My parents are having all kinds of financial difficulties. I know they'd want me to finish school.'' Besides, she says, her voice a little stronger now, though her sentences still end in that questioning upward lilt of late adolescence, ''I want to finish school. I don't want to work in a 7-Eleven all my life.'' And, after a long pause: ''I want to have kids someday, but I want to be able to take care of them so they won't be miserable.'' When the nurse asks if she has been using birth control, she says yes, she's on the pill, but she doesn't take it all that regularly. ''My boyfriend and I want to try that injection -- Depo-Provera? -- 'cause the pill makes me sick.''",1999-07-11T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Rappoport, who lives and works in Teaneck, said he learned that 40 percent of visits to veterinarians was for animals' reactions to separations and stress. Though many owners of animals leave the television or radio on when they leave, Mr. Rappoport thought nonstop relaxing music (without commercials or, say, the clashing cymbals of some classical music) might work better. We woke our cats to try the music out on them. They certainly appeared relaxed as the guitar-and synthesizer sounds filled the room. The set, $19.95, is available at petmusic.com or at Petco stores.

Scott McCraney, on the other hand, has a boombox and will travel. Last month, Mr. McCraney, right, an aspiring actor, began performing as a Ricky Martin look-alike at elementary schools and private parties in the Boston area. Mr. McCraney says that for $500 plus transportation costs, he will go anywhere in the United States to provide an hour of entertainment, dancing and a lip-sync version of ''Livin' La Vida Loca,'' Mr. Martin's current hit. Mr. McCraney is not exactly a dead ringer -- he's two inches shorter than the Latin heartthrob, and in profile the resemblance weakens. But that didn't faze fans like Roseleen Dello Russo, 12, who gasped when she saw the act at a recent Father's Day concert in Revere, Mass. ''At first I thought it was really Ricky Martin,'' she said. ''I couldn't believe it. I was screaming, and all the girls were trying to touch him.'' Mr. McCraney is somewhat more deprecating.

us,Chasing Perfection: A Portrait of Fischer-Dieskau,"ALL superlatives for the artistic impact and record-setting extensiveness of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's singing career have long since been exhausted. It is to the credit of Bruno Monsaingeon, the director of a documentary film on the singer just released by Atlantic Records, that he finds a way to make the stale kudos fresh. Leonard Bernstein sings tonelessly at an orchestra rehearsal and dryly admits, ''Fischer-Dieskau I'm not.'' The soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf observes that perfection is unattainable and amends that with ''Fischer-Dieskau, perhaps,'' kissing the air. Yehudi Menuhin just says his name, trails off and looks happy.",1999-07-11T05:00:00+0000

In 1954, the Briton became the first to run a mile in less than 4 minutes, doing so in 3 minutes 59.4 seconds. Now international track meets generally bypass the mile in favor of the slightly shorter 1,500 meters. Still, the mile retains glamour, so there was excitement when Hicham el-Guerrouj, a 24-year-old Moroccan, lowered the world record to 3 minutes 43.13 seconds in Rome. Had he run that time in Bannister's record race, he would have beaten Bannister by 120 yards. FRANK LITSKY",1999-07-11T05:00:00+0000

World War II, by wrenching Americans out of their accustomed lives and routines, had forever broken the foundation of segregation -- the assumption by blacks and whites alike that the system was ordained and enduring.

Fortunately -- at least for the reader -- he has no interest in being cured of them. Though ''Chump Change'' begins, like ''Bright Lights, Big City,'' with our hero on a downward spiral, Eddie draws an essentially cheerful story out of his outsized (6 feet 5 inches, 225 pounds) character's quest to ''succeed in the true sense of the word,'' which means finding his way as a writer while failing everywhere else. And David Henry has a talent for failure. Fleeing New York after precipitately quitting his letter-filing job at Newsweek, he needs his soon-to-be-ex lover to buy his plane ticket home. ''A new low,'' he says. ''I have to borrow from my girlfriend in order to leave her.'' Back in Toronto, he hangs out with an old buddy named Max, mooches drinks, lucklessly courts Les, the beautiful daughter of an advertising magnate, mooches more drinks, has a disastrous romance with a hapless Korean artist and begins to earn a living as a writer. Plot is not remotely the thing in this picaresque tale -- Les, for instance, basically just drops out of sight -- nor is character development: Eddie pays so little attention to other characters that the book starts to feel sloppy. His talent lies in the infectious enjoyment he takes in describing his protagonist's exploits. As entertaining as it is, ''Chump Change'' may only be David Eddie warming up.

In a Dutch auction, a company states the number of shares it will buy back and, instead of stipulating a specific price, sets a range in which stockholders can tender their shares. The highest price within the range that the company must pay to get back all the desired shares becomes the purchase price for all the shares. Cendant said its shareholders tendered 56.1 million shares at $22.25 or less. Shares tendered in excess of the 50 million or in excess of the $22.25 price will be returned.",1999-07-17T05:00:00+0000

Armed with Rolliflex cameras, sunglasses and a fierce gonzo attitude, the first paparazzi prowled the cafes on their Lambrettas. Some of the best trophies were bagged by a photographer named Tazio Secchiaroli, the designated leader of the pack and the model for the character Paparazzo in Fellini's film ''La Dolce Vita.'' Secchiaroli found gold in staging confrontations with his prey -- an alarming flash, an overturned table, a starlet on the run -- creating little incidents,'' as he says in TAZIO SECCHIAROLI: Greatest of the Paparazzi (Abrams, $49.50), to ''produce great features that earned us a lot of money.'' And, not so incidentally, earned the ''victim'' a lot of press coverage. A happy arrangement all round. This delicious picture book was edited by Diego Mormorio, a photography critic, in collaboration with the family of Secchiaroli, who died last year at the age of 73. His paparazzi shots have their own artless beauty -- the anti-esthetic so popular now in fashion magazines, seen in the white, flash-lit faces of Anita Ekberg and Anthony Steele, for example, frozen in a series of flight-and-fight photographs. Brigitte Bardot, Ursula Andress, Marcello Mastroianni are lovingly and lushly pictured in repose and at work, off and on the sets at Cinecitt. And what can you say about the actress Secchiaroli called ''La Loren,'' with whom he had a 20-year collaboration?

The work in his latest collection, THE BREAKAGE (Houghton Mifflin, $22), blends the brutally honest introspection of American poets like Frost and Lowell with accessible, lighthearted language reminiscent of mid-20th-century British masters like Auden and Betjeman. A series of letters in verse to the English poet Edward Thomas, killed in World War I, forms the heart of the book. In these ''letter poems,'' Maxwell evokes the simple, idyllic pleasures of country living and uses them as a sounding board, a means of exploring and accepting the demands of a poet's life: ''Each of us / Is writing, Edward, asking the great space / Below us what is missing still, what gift / Will make us whole again.'' Maxwell, who was educated at Oxford and now teaches at Amherst College, distinguishes himself with a host of dexterous and nimbly honed lines and images. Indeed, the ''breakage'' of the book's title serves as a neat metaphor for poetry's capacity to shatter the often dark block of human experience into beacons of meaning and light.

Fans of the show are heading to Chinatown stores like the Golden Dragon (318 Canal Street), where a basic gold nameplate can be ordered for $40. Patricia Field, the show's costume designer, got the idea from inner-city style. ''The trend never died down with the ethnic girls,'' said Ms. Field, who sells nameplates by special order at her store at 10 East Eighth Street for about $100. ''A nice thing to do is to hang a personal charm on them,'' Ms. Field added. On Ms. Parker's necklace, she hung a Playboy bunny. KAREN ROBINOVITZ",1999-07-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Divinely Insignificant,"The French painter Gustave Moreau (1826-98) was a visionary who resisted getting swept up in the late-19th-century tides of naturalism and Impressionism and pursued instead his own version of an epic past. Through his eclectic use of exotic imagery, he imbued his mythical and biblical scenes with an Oriental mysticism, creating what Genevieve Lacambre, the director of the Musee Gustave Moreau in Paris, in GUSTAVE MOREAU: Between Epic and Dream (Art Institute of Chicago/Princeton University, $60), calls ''a realm of evocation, imagination and dreams.'' But to many of his contemporaries, Moreau's vision was perplexing. ''Are we in poor Judea or in the home of the opulent rajah of Mysore?'' one mystified critic asked after viewing one of Moreau's most celebrated paintings, ''Salome,'' at the Paris Salon of 1876. In the 20th century Moreau has become even more of an enigma. Largely ignored by an Impressionism-obsessed public, and often pigeonholed by critics as a transitional artist whose work paved the way for Surrealism, Moreau's best-known legacy may be that he taught Henri Matisse and Georges Rouault. ''Gustave Moreau: Between Epic and Dream,'' with more than 200 color reproductions, essays by several Moreau scholars, and Lacambre's historical and critical text about the artist's major works, examines Moreau's amazingly varied influences, which include da Vinci's ''Adoration of the Magi,'' Algerian dance costumes, Mogul miniatures, medieval tapestries and the seven labors of Hercules. The many excerpts from Moreau's own writings give the reader the clearest idea of what he aspired to: ''the flashes of illumination that one doesn't know how to situate, that have something divine in their seeming insignificance.''

Two intertwined stories are told: a renewal of an affair after 20 years between Balendran, a married family man and Ceylonese aristocrat, and Richard, an Englishman now living with a much younger lover, and the travails of Balendran's niece Annalukshmi, a schoolteacher who rails against her family's attempts to marry her to a series of dull, intellectually inferior would-be suitors. Both stories play themselves out in the politically heady days before caste-conscious Ceylon became Sri Lanka, when the homosexuality of a man of polite society was considered a ''regrettably irreversible'' disposition, and a woman who showed a sensual spirit and even a hint of freewheelingness (particularly on a bicycle) was considered ''fast.'' Faultlessly elegant but familiar in its depiction of nostalgic regret and repressed desire, ''Cinnamon Gardens'' has a sepia-toned cover and an oddly sepia-toned style, yet it is also surprisingly light reading -- it's unfettered by any attempt at highbrow heaviness. Selvadurai, the author of ''Funny Boy,'' is expert in capturing the nuances of this particularly precious time and place; there is real texture to these upper-class lives, and you can't beat the atmosphere -- hushed conversations, heated debates and private ruminations are held in luscious gardens and in grand drawing rooms. As you read, you can almost see the Merchant-Ivory adaptation playing itself out in your head. Daniel Rietz",1999-07-25T05:00:00+0000

One bathroom featured a six-foot python, alive, breathing and wrapped around the shower rod. Much of a spare bedroom was filled by the administrator's personal computer system, with two 21-inch monitors crowding a desk and several big beige boxes wheezing in the closet. Yelich was trying to help me understand that people can easily break into computers. He explained how he'd discovered that someone who called himself Info was breaking into the network he ran at the Santa Fe Institute, a highfalutin physics think tank.

us,A Jazz Pianist With a Brahmsian Bent,"JAZZ has an Oedipal problem, and critics are at least partly to blame. A good deal of jazz writing comes down to matching sons with their putative fathers, the men (for they are almost invariably men) who influenced young musicians and whom the young resemble with apparently biological precision. Tracing these lines of descent may be unavoidable, and even illuminating at times. But it proves a crude, not to mention patriarchal, way of listening. (Is it any wonder that young jazz musicians revolt against the traditions handed down to them?) Consider, for instance, the reception of Brad Mehldau, who, at 28, is among the most celebrated jazz pianists of his generation. If you've heard his name mentioned, you've probably heard that he's ''the next Bill Evans.'' High praise, to be sure.

It's the Sandy Koufax World Series, Aug. 5 to 9, at Cochrane Stadium at the Caven Point complex in Jersey City. Taking part will be nine teams of 13- and 14-year-olds - some girls sure to be among them - from seven regions, including Puerto Rico. This is Jersey City's fifth year as site of the series, and the host team, the Jersey City Stars of Tomorrow, automatically gets a berth. Games are played by major-league rules, though the infield is smaller; spitting and scratching are optional. Opening ceremonies take place on Aug. 5 at 7 P.M., with introduction of the teams, a home run derby, competitions in throwing and other skills, and entertainment. The double-elimination tournament starts at 10 the next morning, with as many as five games a day. Admission is $5 for the opening ceremony and $3 for the following days, good for all day.

He was born in the Bronx, in 1937, where he atteneded Christopher Columbus High School before going on to New York University, where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree. His plans of going to Columbia Dental School changed after graduating college when he received a chiropractic adjustment to his neck which cured him of a long standing problem with headaches, and he went on to study at New York Chiropractic Institute, instead. He received his doctorate in 1960 and opened his first office in Harlem, New York. The social unrest and subsequent riots in Harlem during the middle and late 1960's forced him to move his practice to New Rochelle, where he worked until 1980, when he opened Chiropractic Associates on Palmer Avenue in Larchmont. He was a longtime member of Westchester Country Club, where he loved to play golf with his wife and his group of close friends. It is difficult to assess the scope or the force of the impact Richard Berkoff had on his community. The number of people he helped guide, heal and support reached into the thousands. He inspired admiration and comfort with a particular quiet goodness which was his gift.

The rain forest has rare bird species as well as the ruins of San Lorenzo, a 16th-century Spanish fort, above right. The once glorious, now down-at-the-heels town of Colon (top) is across the canal from the former American military base at Fort Sherman. Mr. Gehry said his conceptual design for the sites in Panama does not yet include drawings for new buildings. The Panamanian Government favors eco-tourism at the Fort Sherman site, and there are tentative plans for an eco-resort hotel. It is interesting that after so much hand-wringing 22 years ago about giving the canal away, it is ultimately the cooperation between an American architect and a team of American and Panamanian authorities that will jointly shape its future.",1999-07-29T05:00:00+0000
