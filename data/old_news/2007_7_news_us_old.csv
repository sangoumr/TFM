The Frmonts were the John and Abigail Adams of their time, or the Charles and Anne Lindbergh, or even the Franklin and Eleanor, John and Jackie, Bill and Hillary  a couple who sought, consciously and unconsciously, to move society forward and, in varying degrees, were both rewarded and pilloried for doing so. It is Dentons belief that owing largely to their progressive views  particularly their virulent opposition to slavery, paired with Jessies feminism  the Frmonts suffered more than most; they were multimillionaires and came just shy of being the president and first lady at the height of their powers, but wound up historical punch lines, relegated to ever smaller and meaner living arrangements in the twilight of their lives.

As the girls came forward in alphabetical order, the sartorial array was something to behold: stringy tank dresses that looked perfect for a day at the beach were followed by elegant sheaths that could have done double duty as bridesmaids dresses; virginal frocks were preceded by vah-vah-voom numbers.

us,The Shadow Catcher," Let me tell you about the sketch by Leonardo I saw one afternoon in the Queen's Gallery in London a decade ago, and why I think it haunts me. The Queen's Gallery is on the west front side of Buckingham Palace, on a street that's always noisy, full of taxis rushing round the incongruous impediment of a massive residence in the middle of a route to Parliament and Westminster Abbey and, more importantly, a train station named Victoria. The Queen's Gallery is small, neither well maintained nor adequately lit, and when I went there to see the Royal Collection of Da Vinci drawings, the day was pissing rain and cold and damp, and the room smelled of wet wool seasoned in the lingering aroma of fry-up and vinegar, an atmosphere far removed from the immediacy, muscularity, and sunny beauty of Da Vinci's subjects. There were drawings of male adolescents, drawings of chubby infants, drawings of rampant horses, toothless women, old men with spiky white hairs on their noses and boils on their chins - and then, in a corner, there was a different kind of sketch, a map. It was drawn in ochre on a sheet of rough, uneven rag approximately the size of ordinary letter paper, the same color as southern California sandstone. I stood in front of it for something like too long because a guard stepped forward 'til I leaned away, still looking at it, mesmerized. Some things you remember for a lifetime; other things, mysteriously, bleed away, or fade to shadow. Sometimes, you try to bring the memory of something back, and can't. You try to see a face, recapture love, recapture rapture; but it's gone, that face, that vibrancy. Other images return without your bidding. Almost every night when I'm at home, alone, in bed, before I fall asleep, my mind presents that sketch of Leonardo's without warning. Onto that inner space where dreams take place, my mind projects its image. I see it, plain as day - a little piece of sandstone-colored paper on which an Italian coastal town is drawn from a perspective high above the ground, so high that no treetop, no cliff, no man-made promontory could have served as Leonardo's point of view. It's the view an airplane affords, a view Da Vinci must have drawn from an imaginary self-projection; and judging from the scale of things, he must have been imagining himself ten thousand feet above the ground, or almost two miles up. Commercial airline pilots volunteer this kind of information - altitude and cruising speed - which is how I've learned to estimate how high above the ground I am, looking from an airplane window. I've learned what the Earth looks like from a great height - but how did Leonardo know? Are we hardwired, as a species, to imagine flying? We take it for granted now, most of us, this point of view, as a second site, because many of us have flown, many of us have been up there, and, even if we haven't, most of us have seen the pictures of our world as a distant object, beamed to Earth by satellite. We can adopt this point of view as a modern way of looking, but is it modern? What if there's something in our psyches designed to see things from above? Isn't it a possibility that, as humans, we were built to dream from heights? That Columbus dreamed of flying to America, dreamed his future landfall from above? That Lewis and Clark, bedding down on rocky ground, flew at night across the Cascade Mountains in their dreams, above sequoias, over the Columbia, toward the valiant coast to the magnificent Pacific? Maybe we are built to reconnoiter from above, survey the Earth from heaven, dream of flying. Maybe it's the angel in us. Gertrude Stein, the first time she flew, saw in Earth's crevasses and folds the antecedents of cubism and told Picasso that he'd stolen that artistic vision off the backs of birds. I want to think that Galileo flew, in thought. I want to think that all the peasants in the fields of history dreamed in flight, that all the slaves and all indentured souls whose dust still gathers on this Earth had wings at night, and aspirations swift enough for uplift. I want to believe we're built for soaring in our thoughts, and out here on the edge, in California, at night, in that fading wakefulness before sleep erases sight, my mind projects that sketch of Leonardo's, and then, before I realize it, I'm flying in, flying to America, making landfall on this continent, not from over the Pacific, not from Singapore or Australia, Fiji or Hawaii on routes I've flown in real airplanes, but I dream I'm coming in across the other ocean, over the Atlantic, like Columbus. Flying in, not as I've done from England and Europe in a jumbo jet with Greenland off the starboard side, down the Scotia coast with Halifax below, but flying in and making my first contact off the Carolina coast near the 37th meridian, where the English landed, equidistant from the Catholic French in Canada and the Spanish Jesuits in Florida. I dream I'm flying in across Cape Hatteras, where that little spit of land cricks around Pamlico Sound, where the Tuscarora were. Where the Tuscarora fished and lived and danced and laughed and loved before the measles and the smallpox took them. Here in California, on the edge, at night, after the coyotes end their braying, there's an hour after midnight when a silence drops into these canyons which persists 'til the first birdsong of morning, and, in that intervening lull, I give myself to flying in, west from Tuscarora marshland over Choctaw sands and Chickasaw meadows - I project myself speeding toward myself - flying, as the eagle flies, over Creek, Catawba, Natchez, Kiowa, Comanche and Plains Apache, Wichita and Zuni, Navajo and Hopi, above the First and Second Mesas, over Acoma and Chaco Canyon, across the Colorado toward the Paiute, Chumash and Morongo, here, where I am in Los Angeles. There are those who say the sound my country makes at night, the sound I hear when flying, the sound my nation exhales as it sleeps, is the sound of prayer, the sound of Jesus Christ arising from the basalt in the Rockies, splitting hearts of granite as he shakes off chains of time and is reborn, and there are those who claim the sound my nation makes at night is the metallic hiss of money in the forge or the sound of slavery's jism misspent in anger and assimilation, or that the sound my nation makes is the sizzle of cosmetic simulation, the sound the cutting edge of surgical removal makes, the sound of History slipping into coma, cosmic silence, almost total, through which, in my dream of flying, I perceive a hopeful distant note - the sound my country makes - a note so confirming and annunciatory that it seems to bend into itself, bend into its own impending future like an announcing angel comin' round the mountain, bend the way a shadow bends, conforming to the curvature of Earth, wailing gently through the night. That sound is the siren's sound of the iron road, a haunting whistle. I fly, in my imagination, over the abandoned Plains, the Rockies, and the ghost. ",2007-07-01T05:20:00+0000

The city also voted to grant her, as well as all her descendants, an impressive series of rights and privileges: status as a special representative of Athens to Delphi (proxenos), the right to consult the oracle, priority of trial, inviolability (asylia), freedom from taxes, a front seat at all competitions held by the city, the right to own land and houses, and all other honors customary for proxenoi and benefactors of the city.

Mr. Bromleys play is itself a celebration of indie theater and centers on a reunion of three actors who used to work together and have since traveled different paths. It closes tomorrow night to make way for next weekends offering  a tall tale by Rachel Shukert about a promiscuous frontiersman, presented by the Bushwick Hotel theater company  and the five additional productions that follow.

To Arikhas immense credit, she provides a thoroughly documented account of the ways in which a wrong-headed theory dominated medical thinking for more than 2,000 years, refusing to yield place at the bedside long after it had been proved erroneous by clear-eyed observation and the development of experimental science. One of Arikhas contributions to the general readers knowledge, in fact, is to use the history of the humors  those bodily fluids once thought to hold the key to understanding human health and personality  to demonstrate the difficulty that physicians have always had in giving up outmoded ways of treating actual patients. This has almost invariably been the case, even when not only the theoretical but also the practical basis for a changed approach has already been established, sometimes by the very clinicians who cannot bring themselves to abandon the discredited practices. Arikha is hardly treading new ground here, but she does provide convincing and very specific evidence of a human failing that dogged the profession until at least the middle of the 20th century, and in certain ways continues to influence modern-day diagnosis and therapy.

Celebrity journalist is a term many consider oxymoronic at best; at worst, such a creature is among the lowest of life-forms, and a person who writes about movie stars, whether as reporter or junketeering reviewer, is about as likely to have intimate relations with one of his shimmering subjects as a jumbo shrimp is with a rainbow trout. It never happens, as the British film critic Antonia Quirke rightly notes in Choking on Marlon Brando, her giddy new memoir. No actor has ever gone out with a critic in the history of the world. And then, all but stamping her foot: I hate actors.",2007-07-08T04:00:00+0000

The combination creates some memorable encounters. Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and author, once watched as a particularly charming 8-year-old Williams girl, who was visiting Sacks at his hotel, took a garrulous detour into a wedding ceremony. Im afraid she disrupted the flow of this wedding, Sacks told me. She also mistook the brides mother for the bride. That was an awkward moment.

They set out that day to climb the 20,354-foot mountain. Both are believed to have died in an avalanche. Mr. Fowlers body was found in December but the search for Ms. Boskoff was suspended because of the weather. Both climbers had reached the summit of many of the worlds highest peaks, including Mount Everest. Ms. Boskoffs body has not been recovered because it was found in a particularly treacherous area, said David C. Jones, a co-owner with Ms. Boskoff of Mountain Madness, a Seattle adventure travel service. Mr. Jones said it could be several months before her body is recovered.

The allegations, in a lawsuit filed yesterday in Federal District Court by six former employees, involve the restaurant V Steakhouse in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle. V Steakhouse closed at the end of 2005. The lawsuit accuses V Steakhouse of illegally dividing tips among the restaurants managers as well as the servers, busboys and captains. The lawsuit also says that because V Steakhouse handled the tips that way, it underpaid the nonmanagerial employees, because they earned less than the minimum wage under state law, which was $6 an hour when the restaurant closed. D. Maimon Kirschenbaum, the lawyer representing the former V Steakhouse workers, said restaurant owners are allowed to pay employees who receive tips less than the minimum wage, but not if the tips are divided among nontipped employees like managers.

Rowling, describing herself as euphoric and devastated after 17 years of writing seven novels devoted to the adventures and travails of the boy wizard Harry Potter, tantalized millions of fans by hinting that one day she may return to the magical realm of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Reuters reported. In an interview with the BBC, Ms. Rowling said: I think that Harrys story comes to quite a clear end in Book Seven. But I have always said that I wouldnt say never. I cant say I will never write another book about that world, just because I think, What do I know, in 10 years time I might want to return to it. But I think it is unlikely. Meanwhile, thousands of fans have signed a petition urging the author to keep the series going after the publication of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows on July 21. Despite speculation that Harry might die in the novel, the Waterstones book chain, which established the petition, said his demise would be no obstacle to further adventures. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle famously killed off Sherlock Holmes, yet brought him back after years of demand from his fans and publishers, said Wayne Winstone of Waterstones. Couldnt the same happen for Harry Potter? But at least one person said he was happy that the series is ending.

According to an e-mail message to the regional director of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Mr. McKinney said at an Oct. 7, 2001, meeting that the city wanted the respirator rules enforced because contractors fear OSHAs ability to issue penalties and that would cause compliance. The e-mail message was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a labor organization. OSHA officials have said they decided to play an advisory role because enforcement would have been too time consuming to be effective.

us,Manhattan: Three More Indicted in Mortgage Fraud Case,"Three more people were indicted in Federal District Court yesterday in a scheme, carried out by at least 26 people, that involved submitting fraudulent mortgage loan applications and inflating home appraisals to get millions of dollars in loans from lending institutions. The indicted people, Galina Zhigun, Garri Zhigun and Maryann Furman, were added to 23 others announced by prosecutors in January, including mortgage brokers, real estate appraisers, straw buyers and a settlement agent, prosecutors said. Ms. Zhigun was the owner of a Brooklyn mortgage brokerage firm called A.G.A. Capital that employed many of the brokers charged in the scheme. Since 2004, A.G.A. Capital, its successor, Lending Universe, and a related company, Northside Capital, brokered more than a thousand home mortgages and home equity loans, the authorities said. In some cases, prosecutors charged, employees of the company recruited straw buyers and then helped them obtain subprime loans, which are easier for borrowers with poor credit to get. To ensure that the straw buyers got the loans, bank statements and other proof of income were falsified in some cases, prosecutors said. In other cases, the brokers stole identities to obtain loans, prosecutors said.",2007-07-11T04:00:00+0000

Ms. Leibovitz, whose works include a naked, very pregnant Demi Moore and a nude John Lennon hugging a clothed Yoko Ono, suggested that the queen, who was wearing ceremonial robes, remove her crown. I think it will look better without the crown because the garter robe is so ... Ms. Leibovitz said. The queen interrupted her. Less dressy? she asked.

The queen then stalked off, trailed by an official bearing the train of her blue velvet cape, while she told another servant: Im not changing anything. Ive had enough dressing like this, thank you very much.

us,Riding Knobby Tires to Exhaustion,"Pedaling a mountain bike for 24 hours straight might sound like some strange form of torture. But the enduring race format, which involves solo and relay-team riders cranking as many laps as possible in 24 hours on a pre-marked course, is now celebrated at dozens of events around the country each summer. Two of the biggest -- 24 Hours of 9 Mile in Wausau, Wis., and 24 Hours of Killington in Vermont -- take place the weekend of July 28. At the Killington race, part of a national series of six 24-hour races, riders pedal a 9.28-mile course that includes a thigh-killing 1,798 feet of elevation gain per lap. Team and solo riders pedal through the day and night, donning powerful bike lights once the sun sets to illuminate the twisting technical trail. Points are racked up with each completed lap. In Wisconsin, 24 Hours of 9 Mile is the national championship race for one of cyclings strangest of subgenres. The solo winners will spin through more than 200 miles of knobby-tire riding, starting Saturday at 10 a.m. and not stopping until Sunday at the same time, when they finish -- ragged, muddy, and zombie-like, but smiling from knowing they just pulled off the nearly impossible.

us,Transcript: President Bush on Iraq,"PRESIDENT BUSH: Good morning. Thank you. Yesterday America lost an extraordinary first lady and a fine Texan, Lady Bird Johnson. She brought grace to the White House and beauty to our country. On behalf of the American people, Laura and I send our condolences to her daughters, Lynda and Luci, and we offer our prayers to the Johnson family. Before I answer some of your questions, today I'd like to provide the American people with an update on the situation in Iraq. Since America began military operations in Iraq, the conflict there has gone through four major phases. The first phase was the liberation of Iraq from Saddam Hussein. The second phase was the return of sovereignty to the Iraqi people and the holding of free elections. The third phase was the tragic escalation of sectarian violence, sparked by the bombing of the golden mosque in Samarra. We've entered a fourth phase, deploying reinforcements and launching new operations to help Iraqis bring security to their people. I'm going to explain why the success of this new strategy is vital for protecting our people and bringing our troops home, which is a goal shared by all Americans. I'll brief you on the report we are sending to Congress. I'll discuss why a drawdown of forces that is not linked to the success of our operations would be a disaster. As president, my most solemn responsibility is to keep the American people safe. So on my orders, good men and women are now fighting the terrorists on the front lines in Iraq. I've given our troops in Iraq clear objectives. And as they risk their lives to achieve these objectives, they need to know they have the unwavering support from the commander in chief, and they do. And they need the enemy to know that America is not going to back down. So when I speak to the American people about Iraq, I often emphasize the importance of maintaining our resolve and meeting our objectives. As a result, sometimes the debate over Iraq is cast as a disagreement between those who want to keep our troops in Iraq and those who want to bring our troops home, and this is not the real debate. I don't know anyone who doesn't want to see the day when our brave service men and women can start coming home. In my address to the nation in January, I put it this way: If we increase our support at this crucial moment, we can hasten the day our troops begin coming home. The real debate over Iraq is between those who think the fight is lost or not worth the cost and those who believe the fight can be won, and that as difficult as the fight is, the cost of defeat would be far higher. I believe we can succeed in Iraq, and I know we must. So we're working to defeat al Qaeda and other extremists and aid the rise of an Iraqi government that can protect its people, deliver basic services (OTCBB:BICV) and be an ally in the war against these extremists and radicals. By doing this, we'll create the conditions that would allow our troops to begin coming home while securing our long-term national interests in Iraq and in the region. When we start drawing down our forces in Iraq, it will (be) because our military commanders say the conditions on the ground are right, not because pollsters say it'll be good politics. The strategy I announced in January is designed to seize the initiative and create those conditions. It's aimed at helping the Iraqis strengthen their government so that it can function even amid violence. It seeks to open space for Iraq's political leaders to advance the difficult process of national reconciliation, which is essential to lasting security and stability. It is focused on applying sustained military pressure to route-out terrorist networks in Baghdad and surrounding areas. It is committed to using diplomacy to strengthen regional and international support for Iraqi's democratic government. Doing all these things, it is intended to make possible a more limited role in Iraq for the United States. That's the goal outlined by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. That's the goal shared by the Iraqis and our coalition partners. It is the goal that Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus and our troops are working hard to make a reality. Our top priority is to help the Iraqis protect their population. So we've launched an offensive in and around Baghdad to go after extremists, to buy more time for Iraqi forces to develop and to help normal life and civil society take root in communities and neighborhoods throughout the country. We're helping enhance the size, capabilities and effectiveness of the Iraqi security forces, so the Iraqis can take over the defense of their own country. We're helping the Iraqis take back their neighborhoods from the extremists. In Anbar province, Sunni tribes that were once fighting alongside al Qaeda against our coalition are now fighting alongside our coalition against al Qaeda. We're working to replicate this success in Anbar and other parts of the country. Two months ago in the supplemental appropriations bill funding our troops, Congress established 18 benchmarks to gauge the progress of the Iraqi government. They require we submit a full report to Congress by September the 15th. Today my administration has submitted to Congress an interim report that requires us to assess, and I quote the bill, ""whether satisfactory progress toward meeting these benchmarks is or is not being achieved."" Of the 18 benchmarks Congress asked us to measure, we can report that satisfactory progress is being made in eight areas. For example, Iraqis have provided the three brigades they promised for operations in and around Baghdad, and the Iraqi government is spending nearly $7.3 billion from its own funds this year to train, equip and modernize its forces. In eight other areas, the Iraqis have much more work to do. For example, they have not done enough to prepare for local elections or pass a law to share oil revenues. And in two remaining areas, progress is too mixed to be characterized one way or the other. Those who believe that the battle in Iraq is lost will likely point to the unsatisfactory performance on some of the political benchmarks. Those of us who believe the battle in Iraq can and must be won see the satisfactory performance on several of the security benchmarks as a cause for optimism. Our strategy is built on the premise that progress on security will pave the way for political progress, so it's not surprising that political progress is lagging behind the security gains we are seeing. Economic development funds are critical to helping Iraq make this political progress. Today I'm exercising the waiver authority granted me by Congress to release a substantial portion of those funds. The bottom line is that this is a preliminary report, and it comes less than a month after the final reinforcements arrived in Iraq. This September, as Congress has required, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will return to Washington to provide a more comprehensive assessment. By that time, we hope to see further improvement in the positive areas and the beginning of improvement in the negative areas. We'll also have a clearer picture of how the new strategy is unfolding, and be in a better position to judge where we need to make any adjustments. I will rely on General Petraeus to give me his recommendations for the appropriate troop levels in Iraq. I will discuss the recommendation with the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I will continue consultations with members of the United States Congress from both sides of the aisle. And then I'll make a decision. I know some in Washington would like us to start leaving Iraq now. To begin withdrawing before our commanders tell us we're ready would be dangerous for Iraq, for the region and for the United States. It would mean surrendering the future of Iraq to Al Qaida. It'd mean that we'd be risking mass killings on a horrific scale. It'd mean we'd allow the terrorists to establish a safe haven in Iraq to replace the one they lost in Afghanistan. It'd mean we'd be increasing the probability that American troops would have to return at some later date to confront an enemy that is even more dangerous. The fight in Iraq is part of a broader struggle that's unfolding across the region. The same region in Iran -- the same regime in Iran that is pursuing nuclear weapons and threatening to wipe Israel off the map is also providing sophisticated IEDs to extremists in Iraq who are using them to kill American soldiers. The same Hezbollah terrorists who are waging war against the forces of democracy in Lebanon are training extremists to do the same against coalition forces in Iraq. The same Syrian regime that provides support and sanctuary for Islamic Jihad and Hamas has refused to close its airport in Damascus to suicide bombers headed to Iraq. All these extremist groups would be emboldened by a precipitous American withdrawal, which would confuse and frighten friends and allies in the region. Nations throughout the Middle East have a stake in a stable Iraq. To protect our interests and show our commitment to our friends in the region, we are enhancing our military presence, improving our bilateral security ties and supporting those fighting the extremists across the Middle East. We're also using the tools of diplomacy to strengthen regional and international support for Iraq's democratic government. So I'm sending Secretary Gates and Secretary Rice to the region in early August. They will meet with our allies, reemphasize our commitment to the international compact of Sharm el-Sheikh, reassure our friends that the Middle East remains a vital strategic priority for the United States. There is a conversion (sic) of visions between what Iraqi leaders want, what our partners want and what our friends in the region want and the vision articulated by my administration, the Iraq Study Group and others here at home. The Iraqis do not want U.S. troops patrolling their cities forever, any more than the American people do. But we need to ensure that when U.S. forces do pull back, the terrorists and extremists cannot take control. The strategy that General Petraeus and the troops he commands are now carrying out is the best opportunity to bring us to this point. So I ask Congress to provide them with the time and resources they need. The men and women of the United States military have made enormous sacrifices in Iraq. They have achieved great things, and the best way to begin bringing them home is to make sure our new strategy succeeds. And, now, I'd be glad to answer a few questions. QUESTION: Mr. President, you started this war, the war of your choosing, and you can end it alone, today, at this point. Bring in peacekeepers, U.N. peacekeepers. Two million Iraqis have fled their country as refugees. Two million more are displaced. Thousands and thousands are dead. Don't you accept -- don't you understand, we brought the Al Qaida into Iraq? BUSH: Actually, I was hoping to solve the Iraqi issue diplomatically. That's why I went to the United Nations and worked with the United Nations Security Council, which unanimously passed a resolution that said, Disclose, disarm or face serious consequences. That was the message -- clear message to Saddam Hussein. He chose the course. QUESTION: But didn't we go into Iraq? BUSH: It was his decision to make. Obviously, it was a difficult decision for me to make to send our brave troops, along with coalition troops, into Iraq. I firmly believe the world is better off without Saddam Hussein is power. Now the fundamental question facing America is: Will we stand with this young democracy? Will we help them achieve stability? Will we help them become an ally in this war against extremists and radicals that is not only evident in Iraq, but it's evident in Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and Afghanistan? We're at the beginning stages of a great ideological conflict between those who yearn for peace and those who want their children to grow up in a normal, decent society -- and radicals and extremists who want to impose their dark vision on people throughout the world. Iraq is obviously -- Helen, has got the attention of the American people, as it should. This is a difficult war, and it's a tough war. But as I have consistently stated throughout the -- this presidency, it is a necessary war to secure our peace. I find it interesting that as this young democracy has taken hold, radicals and extremists kill innocent people to stop its advance. And that ought to be a clear signal to the American people that these are dangerous people. And their ambition is not just contained to Iraq; their ambition is to continue to hurt the American people. My attitude is we ought to defeat them there so we don't have to face them here, and that we ought to defeat their ideology with a more hopeful form of government. QUESTION: Mr. President, you're facing a rebellion from Republican -- key Republican senators who want you to change course and begin reducing the U.S. combat role. Given the mixed report that you present today, how do you persuade Republicans to stick with you as they look ahead to the next elections? BUSH: A couple of things. First of all, I respect those Republicans that you're referring to. I presume you're referring to friends of mine, like Lugar -- Senator Lugar, Domenici. These are good, honorable people. I've spoken to them. And I listened very carefully to what they have to say. First of all, they share my concern that a precipitous withdrawal would embolden Al Qaida. And they also understand that we can't let Al Qaida gain safe haven inside of Iraq. I appreciate, you know, their calls, and I appreciate their -- their desire to work with the White House to be in a position where we can sustain a presence in Iraq. What I tell them is this, just what I've told you, is that as the commander in chief of the greatest military ever I have an obligation, a sincere and serious obligation to hear out my commander on the ground. And I will take his recommendation -- and as I mentioned, to talk to Bob Gates about it, as well as the Joint Chiefs about it, as well as consult with members of the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats -- as I make a decision about the way forward in Iraq. And so, you know, I value the advice of those senators. I appreciate their concerns about the situation in Iraq. And I'm going to continue listening to them. QUESTION: Mr. President, in addition to members of your own party, the American public is clamoring for a change of course in Iraq. Why are you so resistant to that idea, and how much longer are you willing to give the surge to work before considering a change in this policy? BUSH: First of all, I understand why the American people are -- you know, they're tired of the war. People are -- there's war fatigue in America. It's affecting our psychology. I've said this before. I understand that. This is an ugly war. It's a war in which an enemy will kill innocent men, women and children in order to achieve a political objective. It doesn't surprise me that there is deep concern amongst our people. Part of that concern is whether or not we can win, whether or not the objective is achievable. People don't want our troops in harm's way if that which we're trying to achieve can't be accomplished. I feel the same way. I cannot look a mother and father of a troop in the eye and say, I'm sending your kid into combat, but I don't think we can achieve the objective. I wouldn't do that to a parent or a husband or a wife of a soldier. I believe we can succeed, and I believe we are making security progress that will enable the political track to succeed as well. And the report, by the way, which is -- as accurately noted as being submitted today -- is written a little less than a month after the full complement of troops arrived. I went to the country and said, I have made this decision. I said, What was happening on the ground is unsatisfactory in Iraq. In consultation with a lot of folks, I came to the conclusion that we needed to send more troops into Iraq, not less, in order to provide stability, in order to be able to enhance the security of the people there. And David asked for a certain number of troops. David Petraeus asked for a certain number. General Petraeus asked for a certain number of troops. And he just got them a couple of weeks ago. Military -- it takes a while to move our troops, as the experts know. You just can't load them all in one airplane or one big ship and get them into theater. They had to stage the arrival of our troops. And after they arrived in Iraq, it took a while to get them into their missions. Since the reinforcements arrived, things have changed. For example, I would remind you that Anbar province was considered lost. Maybe some of you reported that last fall. And yet today, because of what we call bottom-up reconciliation, Anbar province has changed dramatically. The same thing is now beginning to happen in Diyala province. There are neighborhoods in Baghdad where violence is down. There are still car bombs, most of which have the Al Qaida signature on them. But they're declining, you know. So there's some measurable progress. And you ask: How long does one wait? I will repeat as the commander in chief of a great military who has supported this military and will continue to support this military, not only with my -- with insisting that we get resources to them, but with -- but by respecting the command structure, I'm going to wait for David to come back -- David Petraeus to come back and give us the report on what he sees. And then we'll use that data, that -- his report, to work with the rest of the military chain of command and members of Congress to, you know, making another decision, if need be. QUESTION: You talk about all the troops now being in place, and only in place for the last three weeks or a month. Yet, three- quarters of the troops for the surge were in place during the period when this July interim report was written. Are you willing to keep the surge going, no matter what General Petraeus says, if there is no substantial Iraqi political progress by September? BUSH: You're asking me to speculate on what my frame of mind will be in September. And I would just ask that you give General Petraeus to come back and brief me. And then, of course, I'll be glad to answer your questions along that line. QUESTION: But there's been no -- but there has been no substantial political progress, even with three-quarters of the troops in there. BUSH: Well, as I mentioned... QUESTION: So can you keep that going through September even if there isn't... BUSH: As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have felt all along that the security situation needed to change in order for there to be political progress. It's very hard for a young democracy to function with the violence that was raging. Secondly, there's a lot of the past that needs to be worked through the system. Living under the brutal tyrant Saddam Hussein created a lot of anxiety and a lot of tensions and a lot of rivalry. And it's just -- it's going to take a while to work it through. But they couldn't work through those tensions and rivalries in the midst of serious violence. And so the strategy was: Move in more troops to cause the violence to abate. And that's what David Petraeus will be reporting on. QUESTION: Question for you about the process you're describing of your decision-making as commander in chief. Have you entertained the idea that at some point Congress may take some of that sole decision-making power away through legislation? And can you tell us: Are you still committed to vetoing any troop withdrawal deadline? BUSH: You mean in this interim period? QUESTION: Yes. BUSH: I don't think Congress ought to be running the war. I think they ought to be funding our troops. I'm certainly interested in their opinion. But trying to run a war through resolution is a prescription for failure, as far as I'm concerned, and we can't afford to fail. I'll work with Congress. I'll listen to Congress. Congress has got all the right to appropriate money, but the idea of telling our military how to conduct operations, for example, or how to, you know, deal with troop strength is -- it's -- I -- I don't think it makes sense. I don't think it makes sense today, nor do I think it's a good precedent for the future. And so the role of the commander in chief is, of course, to consult with Congress. QUESTION: So if Reed-Levin or anything like it were to pass and set a -- BUSH: Well, I would hope they wouldn't pass, Jim. But I -- QUESTION: But -- BUSH: Let me make sure you understand what I'm saying. Congress has all the right in the world to fund. That's their main involvement in this war, which is to provide funds for our troops. What you're asking is whether or not Congress ought to be basically determining how troops are positioned, or troop strength. And I just -- I don't think that would be good for the country. David. QUESTION: Mr. President, you've said many times this war at this stage is about the Iraqi government creating a self-sustaining, stable government. Last November, your own CIA director, according to The Washington Post, told you about that government, quote, The inability of the government to govern seems irreversible. He could not point to any milestone or checkpoint where we can turn this thing around. And he said, in talking about the government, that, It's balanced, but it cannot function. BUSH: Yes. QUESTION: When you heard that, since that point, you think of how many hundreds of soldiers have been killed, how much money has been spent, why shouldn't people conclude that you are either stubborn, in denial, but certainly not realistic about the strategy that you've pursued since then? BUSH: You know, it's interesting, it turns out Mike Hayden -- I think you're quoting Mike Hayden there -- was in this morning to give me his weekly briefing. And I asked him about that newspaper article from which you quote. His answer was his comments to the Iraq Study Group were a little more nuanced than the quotation you read. He said that he made it clear the current strategy in Iraq wasn't working. That's his recollection of the briefing to the Iraq Study Group. He briefed them to the fact that it wasn't working and that we needed a change of direction. He also said that those who suggest that we back away and let the Iraqis' government do it -- this is in November of 2006 -- let the Iraqis handle it, don't understand the inability of the Iraq government at that time to take on that responsibility. He then went on to say -- this is what he -- his recollection of this conversation was that our strategy needed to help get the violence down, so that there could be political reconciliation from the top down as well as the bottom up. There has been political reconciliation from the bottom up. Anbar province is a place where the experts had -- or an expert had said that it was impossible for us to achieve our objective. This is the -- part of the country of Iraq where Al Qaida had made it clear that they would like to establish a safe haven from which to plan and plot further attacks, to spread their ideology throughout the Middle East. Since then, since this November 2006 report and since that statement to the Iraq Study Group, things have changed appreciably on the ground in Anbar province. And they're beginning to have the same change (ph), because the people on the ground there are sick and tired of violence and being threatened by people like Al Qaida, who have no positive vision for the future. And there's been a significant turn, where now Sunni sheiks and Sunni citizens are working with the coalition to bring justice to Al Qaida killers. And that same approach is being taken in Diyala. And so there's a lot of focus -- and should be, frankly -- on oil laws or elections. But, remember, there's another political reconciliation track taking place as well, and that's the one that's taking place at the grassroots level. Mike Hayden talked about that as well. QUESTION: So you think you've been realistic about the strategy and what's possible? BUSH: Well -- thank you for the follow-up. Nothing's changed in the new room. Anyway, yes. I mean, as I told you last November right about this time, I was part of that group of Americans who didn't approve of what was taking place in Iraq because it looked like all the efforts that we had taken to that point in time were about to fail. In other words, sectarian violence was really raging. And I had a choice to make, and that was to pull back, as some suggested, and hope that the chaos and violence that might occur in the capital would not spill out across the country, or send more troops in to prevent the chaos and violence from happening in the first place. And that's the decision I made, so it was a realistic appraisal by me. What's realistic as well is to understand the consequences of what will happen if we fail in Iraq. In other words, it's -- people aren't just going to be content with driving America out of Iraq; Al Qaida wants to hurt us here. That's their objective. That's what they'd like to do. They have got an ideology that they believe that the world ought to live under, and that one way to help spread that ideology is to harm the American people, harm American interests. The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq were the ones who attacked us in America on September the 11, and that's why what happens in Iraq matters to security here at home. So I've been realistic about the consequences of failure. I have been realistic about what needs to happen on the ground in order for there to be success. And it's been hard work. And the American people see it as hard work. And one of the reasons it's hard work is because on our TV screens are these violent killings perpetuated by people who have done us harm in the past. And that ought to be a lesson for the American people to understand that what happens in Iraq and overseas matters to the security of the United States of America. QUESTION: On that point, what evidence can you present to the American people that the people who attacked the United States on September 11th are, in fact, the same people who are responsible for the bombings taking place in Iraq? What evidence can you present? And also, are you saying, sir, that Al Qaida in Iraq is the same organization being run by Osama bin Laden himself? BUSH: Al Qaida in Iraq has sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden. And the guys who had perpetuated the attacks on America -- obviously, the guys on the airplane are dead. And the commanders, many of those are either dead or in captivity -- like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. But the people in Iraq, Al Qaida in Iraq has sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden. And we need to take Al Qaida in Iraq seriously, just like we need to take Al Qaida anywhere in the world seriously. QUESTION: Mr. President, in Jordan in November you stood by Prime Minister Maliki and said, He's the right guy for Iraq. Given this report card today and given the lack of top-down political reconciliation, can you tell the American people that you still believe he's the right guy for Iraq? BUSH: I believe that he understands that there needs to be serious reconciliation and they need to get law passed, I firmly believe that. I have had a series of conference calls with the prime minister, as well as the presidency council. In the presidency council, you would have the president, Talabani. You'd have the two vice presidents, Mahdi and Hashemi, as well as the prime minister. And I have urged them to work together to get law passed. It's not easy to get law passed in certain legislatures, like theirs. There's a lot of work that has to be done. And I will continue to urge... QUESTION: Do you have confidence in them? BUSH: Let me just -- I'm almost through with the first one, and I'll come back to the second one. And so I'll continue to urge the Iraqis to show us that they're capable of passing legislation. But it's not just us; it's the Iraqi people. And what really matters is whether or not life's improving for the Iraqi people on the ground. And, yes, I've got confidence in them. But I also understand how difficult it is. I'm not making any excuses, but it is hard. It's hard work for them to get law passed. And sometimes it's hard work for people to get law passed here. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't continue to work to achieve an objective, which is a government that is able to, you know, provide security for its people and to provide basic services and, as importantly, serve as an ally against these extremists and radicals. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. BUSH: No, not you. QUESTION: I'd like to switch subjects. BUSH: OK, is that harsh? QUESTION: Yes. BUSH: Like the new hall -- I should have been more gentle? Do we ever use kinder and gentler? No. Go ahead. QUESTION: If I could just switch subjects for a second to another big decision you made recently, which was in the Scooter Libby case, you spoke very soberly and seriously in your statement about how you weighed different legal questions in coming to your decision on that commutation. But one issue that you did not address was the issue of the morality of your most senior advisers, you know, leaking the name of a confidential intelligence operator. Now that the case is over -- it's not something you've ever spoken to -- can you say whether you're at all disappointed in the behavior of those senior advisers? And have you communicated that disappointment to them in any way? BUSH: First of all, the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision. Secondly, I haven't spent a lot of time talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during that time and I haven't asked them since. I'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person. And, you know, I've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said, I did it. Would we have had this, you know, endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter? But it has been a tough issue for a lot of people in the White House, and it's run its course, and now we're going to move on. Wendell. QUESTION: Mr. President, you have spoken passionately -- BUSH: Oh, I'm sorry, John. Okay. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. QUESTION: You're taking it away from me? BUSH: I am. QUESTION: After doing the fair and balanced, you're going to take -- BUSH: Yeah. (Laughs, laughter.) PRESS MEMBERS: Ohhh. QUESTION: (Off mike.) QUESTION: You were going to come back to me, sir. BUSH: You got the mike, then John, you're next. Possession deal, you know what I'm saying? QUESTION: Thank you, sir. You have spoken passionately about the consequences of failure in Iraq. Your critics say you failed to send enough troops there at the start, failed to keep al Qaeda from stepping into the void created by the collapse of Saddam's army, failed to put enough pressure on Iraq's government to make the political reconciliation necessary to keep the sectarian violence the country is suffering from now from occurring. So why should the American people feel you have the vision for victory in Iraq, sir? BUSH: Those are all legitimate questions that I'm sure historians will analyze. I mean, one of the questions is, should we have sent more in the beginning? Well, I asked that question, Do you need more? to General Tommy Franks. In the first phase of this operation, General Franks, you know, was obviously in charge. And during our discussions in the run-up to the decision to remove Saddam Hussein after he ignored the Security Council resolutions, my primary question to General Franks was: Do you have what it takes to succeed? And do you have what it takes to succeed after you succeed in removing Saddam Hussein? And his answer was yes. Now, history is going to look back to determine whether or not there might have been a different decision made. But at the time, the only thing I can tell you is that I relied upon military commander to make the proper decision about troop strength in acting. And I can remember meeting with the Joint Chiefs, who said: We've reviewed the plan, and seemed satisfied with it. I remember sitting in the PIAT (ph), or the situation room, downstairs here at the White House. And I went to commander and commander, that were all responsible for different aspects of the operation to remove Saddam. I said to each of them, Do you have what it takes? Are you satisfied with the strategy? And the answer was yes. We have worked hard to help this country reconcile. After all, they do have a modern constitution, which is kind of a framework for reconciliation. And after all, there was a significant series of votes where the people were given a chance to express their desire to live in a free society. As a matter of fact, 12 million Iraqis went to the polls. What happened then, of course, is that the enemy -- Al Qaida -- attacks the Samarra mosque, which of course created anxiety and anger amongst the Shia and then all of a sudden the sectarian violence began to spiral. Reconciliation hadn't taken hold deep enough in society to prevent this violence from taking hold. And so I have a -- you know, I've got to decide whether or not it's OK for that violence to continue or whether or not it makes sense for us to try to send more troops in to quell the violence, to give the reconciliation process further time to advance. My concern is that, as a result of violence and killing, there would be chaos. Now that's -- that's a state of affairs that thugs like Al Qaida need to survive, and they like chaos. As a matter of fact, they like to create chaos in order to create conditions of fear and anxiety and doubt. Out of that chaos could come a further escalation of violence in the Middle East, and this is what's important for the American people to understand. That violence and that chaos would embolden extremists groups, whether they be Shia or Sunni. And they would then get into competition with each other. Such chaos and violence would send a mixed signal to the Iranians, who have stated that they believe Israel ought to be wiped off the map. People would begin to wonder about America's resolve. Al Qaida would certainly be in a better position to raise money and recruit. And what makes all this scenario doubly dangerous is that they have proven themselves able to attack us and kill nearly 3,000 of our citizens, and they would like to do it again. And therefore the strategy has got to be to help this government become an ally against these people. What happens in Iraq -- and I understand how difficult it's been. It's been hard. I have received a lot of inspiration, however, from meeting with our troops, who understand the stakes of this fight, and meeting with their families. And, you know, we owe it to our troops to support our commanders: smart, capable people who are devising a strategy that will enable us to succeed and prevent the conditions I just talked about from happening. QUESTION: Your administration has cited Al Qaida leaders such as Zawahiri as saying that if we leave prematurely, it would be a glorious victory for Al Qaida. But the reason that we can't leave or haven't been able to leave is not because we're getting defeated in any way militarily, it's because the Iraqis can't get it together so far. So why can't we counter those messages and, obviously, not withdraw precipitously, but begin some sort of gradual withdrawal that prevents ethnic cleansing but also allows our military to get out? BUSH: Well, there's a lot of discussion about a scenario in which our troop posture would be to guard the territorial integrity of the country of Iraq, to embed and train, to help the Iraqi security forces deal with violent elements in their society, as well as keep enough special forces there to chase down Al Qaida. As a matter of fact, that is something that I've spoken publicly about, said that's a position I'd like to see us in. However, I felt like we needed to send more troops to be able to get the situation to quiet down enough to be able to end in that position. And in terms of my own decision-making, as I mentioned earlier, I definitely need to be in consultation, and will be, with General David Petraeus, who asked for the additional troops in the first place, troops which have been in place -- fully in place for about three weeks. And so, I would ask members of Congress to give the general a chance to come back and to give us a full assessment of whether this is succeeding or not. And it's at that point in time that I will consult with members of Congress and make a decision about the way forward, all aiming to succeed and making sure that Al Qaida and other extremists do not benefit from a decision I might have to make. Mark? QUESTION: Yes, sir, Mr. President. BUSH: Yes, sir, Mark. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: How come -- thank you. Thank you, sir. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: How comfortable are you -- sir, how comfortable are you with your homeland security secretary saying, in the face of no credible intelligence of an imminent threat against the United States, that he has a gut feeling that one is coming this summer? And, sir, what does your gut tell you? BUSH: My gut tells me that -- which my head tells me as well -- is that when we find a credible threat, I'll share it with people to make sure that we protect the homeland. My head also tells me that Al Qaida's a serious threat to our homeland. And we've got to continue making sure we've got good intelligence, good response mechanisms in place; that we've got to make sure we don't embolden them with -- by failing in certain theaters of war where they're confronting us; that we ought to continue to keep the pressure on them. We need to chase them down and bring them to justice before they come home to hurt us again. And so it's a serious issue that is going to outlast my presidency. As I say, this is the beginning stages of what I believe is an ideological conflict that -- where you've got competing visions about what the world ought to be like. What makes this more difficult than previous conflicts is that there's the assymetrical use of power. In other words, IEDs and, you know, suicide bombers are the main -- the main tactical device used by these thugs to try to achieve, you know, strategic objectives. Their objective is to impose their vision of the -- on the world. Their objective is to drive the United States out of parts of the world. They want safe haven. They -- they -- they -- they'd love a society where women have no rights, just like the society that they worked to impose, with the Taliban, on the -- on the women of Afghanistan. That's their vision. And it's in our interests to defend ourselves by staying on the offense against them. And it's in our interests to spread an alternative ideology. We have done this before in our nation's history. We have helped people realize the blessings of liberty, even though they may have been our enemy. And freedom has an amazing way of helping lay the foundation for peace. And it's really important as we head into this ideological struggle in the 21st century that we not forget that liberty can transform societies. Now, the interesting debate is whether or not a nation, you know, like Iraq can self-govern, whether or not these people even care about liberty. As you've heard me say before, I believe -- strongly believe that freedom is a universal value, that freedom isn't just, you know, for Americans or Methodists, that freedom is universal in its application. And so when they voted in '05, I wasn't surprised -- I was pleased that the numbers were as big as they were to defy that many, you know, threats and car bombers, but I wasn't surprised. And this is the real challenge we face. And Iraq is just a part of a broader war against these jihadists and extremists. It's a -- it is a -- it is a -- we will be dealing with this issue for a while, just like we dealt with other ideologies for a while. It takes time for ideologies to take root. I firmly believe that you'll see the democracy movement continue to advance throughout the Middle East if the United States doesn't because isolationist. That's why I told you that I'm making sure that we continue to stay diplomatically involved in the -- in the -- in the region. Condi Rice and Bob Gates will be traveling there in early August to continue to remind our friends and allies that we're -- one, we view them as strategic partners and secondly that we want them to work toward, you know, a freer societies and to help this Iraqi government survive. It's in their interests that Iraq become a stable partner. And I believe we can achieve that objective. And not only do I believe we can -- I know we've got to achieve the objective so we will have done our duty. This is hard work. And one of the things I talked about in the opening comments was, you know, do we do it now or basically, you know, pull back, let the Gallup poll or whatever poll there are decide the fate of the -- of the country. And my view is that if that were to happen, we would then have to go back in with greater force in order to protect ourselves. Because one of the facts of the 21st century is that what happens overseas matters to the security of our country. QUESTION: Good morning, Mr. President. Given the events on the ground in Iraq and the politics here at home, has U.S. military deployment to Iraq reached the ceiling or can you allow any further military escalation? BUSH: You're trying to do what Martha very skillfully tried to get me to do, and that was to... QUESTION: Can I have a follow-up? BUSH: Yes, you can, because you're about to realize I'm not going to answer your question.... (LAUGHTER) ... except to say this: There's going to be great temptation to -- not temptation. There will be -- you won't be tempted. You'll actually ask me to speculate about what David Petraeus will talk to us about when he comes home. And I just ask the American people to understand that the commander in chief must rely upon the wisdom and judgment of the military thinkers and planners. It's very important that there be that solid connection of trust between me and those who are in the field taking incredible risk. And so I'm going to wait to see what David has to say. I'm not going to pre-judge what he may say. I trust David Petraeus' judgment. He's an honest man. Those of you who have interviewed him know that he's a straight shooter, he is an innovative thinker. I was briefed by members of the CODEL that came back that said that it appeared to them that our troops have high respect for our commanders in Baghdad, as do I. Now, do you have a follow-up on perhaps another subject, another area, another... QUESTION: How hard is it for you to conduct the war without popular support? Are you personally -- do you ever have trouble balancing the -- between doing what you think is the right thing and following the will of the majority of the public, which is really the essence of democracy? BUSH: Yes, it is. And, first of all, I can fully understand why people are tired of the war. The question they have is: Can we win it? And, of course, I'm concerned about whether or not the American people are in this fight. I believe, however, that, when they really think about the consequences, if we were to precipitously withdraw, they begin to say themselves, maybe we ought to win this; maybe we ought to have a stable Iraq. Their question, it seems like to me, is: Can we succeed? And that's a very important, legitimate question for anybody to ask. I think many people understand we must succeed. And I think a lot of people understand we've got to wait for the generals to make these military decisions. I suspect -- I know this: that, if our troops thought that I was taking a poll to decide how to conduct this war, they would be very concerned about the mission. In other words, if our troops said, Well, here we are in combat, and we've got a commander in chief who is, you know, running a focus group, in other words, Politics would be -- is more important to him than our safety and/or our strategy, that would dispirit our troops. And that's a lot of constituencies in this fight. Clearly, the American people, who are paying for this, is the major constituency. And I repeat to you, I understand that there -- this violence has affected them, and a lot of people don't think we can win. There's a lot of people in Congress who don't think we can win as well. And, therefore, their attitude is, Get out. My concern with that strategy, something that Mike Hayden also discussed, is that just getting out may sound simple, and it may affect polls, but it would have long-term, serious security consequences for the United States. And so sometimes you -- you know, you just have to make the decisions based upon what you think is right. My most important job is to help secure this country. And, therefore, the decisions in Iraq are all aimed in helping do that job and that's what I firmly believe. The second constituency is the military, and I repeat to you, I'm pretty confident our military do not want their commander in chief making political decisions about their future. A third constituency that matters to me a lot is military families. These are good folks who are making huge sacrifices, and they support their loved ones. And I don't think they want their commander in chief making decisions based upon popularity. Another constituency group that is important for me to talk to is the Iraqis. Obviously, I want the Iraqi government to understand that we expect there to be reconciliation, top-down, that we want to see laws passed. I think they've got that message. They know full well that the American government and the American people expect to see tangible evidence of working together. That's what the benchmarks are aimed to do. They also need to know that I'm making decisions based upon our security interests, of course, but also helping them to succeed and that a poll is not going to determine the course of action by the United States. What will determine the course of action is: Will the decisions that we have made help secure our country for the long run? And finally, another constituency is the enemy, who are wondering whether or not America has got the resolve and the determination to stay after them. And so that what's I think about. And, you know, I'm guess I'm like any other political figure. Everybody wants to be loved -- just sometimes the decisions you make and the consequences don't enable you to be loved. And so, when it's all said and done, if you ever come down and visit the old, tired me down there in Crawford, I will be able to say, I looked in the mirror and made decisions based upon principle, not based upon politics. And that's important to me. Thank you all for your time. I loved being here at this new building. Thank you. QUESTION: Can I just ask you about the Al Qaida intelligence report, please? BUSH: What was that? QUESTION: The intelligence... BUSH: This is amazing. QUESTION: I know. I know. BUSH: The new me. (LAUGHTER) The Al Qaida intelligence report? QUESTION: The intelligence analysts are saying Al Qaida has reconstituted in areas of Pakistan, saying the threat to the West is greater than ever now -- well, as great as 2001. What's happened? You tell... BUSH: OK, I'm glad you asked. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that opportunity to... QUESTION: Thank you for coming back. BUSH: I'm happy to do it. This is not the new me. I mean, this is just an aberration. In other words... QUESTION: It's over, next time? BUSH: I'm not going to leave and then come back for somebody to yell something at me. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) BUSH: Yes, exactly. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that. Exactly. There is a perception in the coverage that Al Qaida may be as strong today as they were prior to September the 11th. That's just simply not the case. I think the report will say since 2001, not prior to September the 11th, 2001. Secondly, that because of the actions we've taken, Al Qaida is weaker today than they would have been. They are still a threat. They are still dangerous. And that is why it is important that we succeed in Afghanistan and Iraq and anywhere else we find them. And that's our strategy, is: to stay on the offense against Al Qaida. She asked the question, Is it Al Qaida in Iraq? Yes, it is Al Qaida, just like it's Al Qaida in parts of Pakistan. And I'm working with President Musharraf to be able to -- I mean, he doesn't want them in his country. He doesn't want foreign fighters in the outposts of his country, and so we're working to make sure that we continue to keep the pressure on Al Qaida. But, no question, Al Qaida is dangerous for the American people, and that's why -- as well as other people that love freedom. And that's why we're working hard with allies and friends to enhance our intelligence. That's why we need terrorist surveillance programs. That's why it's important to keep -- and I would hope Congress would modernize that bill, and that's why we're keeping on the offense. Ultimately, the way to defeat these radicals and extremists is to offer alternative ways of life so that they're unable to recruit, that they can use -- they like to use frustration and hopelessness. The societies that don't provide hope will become the societies were Al Qaida has got the capacity to convince a youngster to go blow himself up. What we need to do is help governments provide brighter futures for their people so they won't sign up. And the fundamental question facing the world in this issue is whether or not it makes sense to try to promote an alternative ideology. I happen to think it does. They say, He's idealistic. Yeah, I'm idealistic. But I'm also realistic in understanding if there's not an alternative ideology presented, these thugs'll be able to continue to recruit. They'll use hopelessness to be able to recruit. And so it's a -- thank you for asking that question. QUESTION: Is bin Laden... BUSH: Thank you all. QUESTION: Is bin Laden alive?

But because some illnesses take many years to develop, state laws give ground zero workers and volunteers the chance to register with the board to preserve their right to file claims if they become ill in the future. Joel Shufro, executive director of the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, said that as many as 60,000 workers and volunteers might have pitched in to help at the disaster site, but that only about 20,000 have registered.

McFadden, Joyce Purnick, Ralph Blumenthal and James Barron.When all the lights gradually dimmed and then went out over the entire city, it felt unreal, gradually it grew to eerie, then it became surreal and finally it was downright scary. With neighborhoods lit by the headlamps of cars and flashlights and candles giving homes their only hope of light: it was an emotional roller coaster. I could appreciate the beauty of a pitch-dark night, which brought me back to my childhood, but in New York City, I was surrounded by a multitude of strangers, not the familiar faces of my small community in Alabama.",2007-07-14T17:34:02+0000

The Washington Post noted the goofy shoes were spreading like vermin, and Radar Magazine anointed the hideous items summers most unfortunate fad. The good news for critics was that fads fade and that the Croc thing seemed to be at a peak. But a year later Crocs still have traction; in fact, the companys sales through the first quarter of 2007 are roughly triple what they were for the same period in 2006, and imitations and knockoffs abound. The shoes might still end up as props at the kitschy 00s-themed parties of future college students (worn with trucker hats for the guys and huge sunglasses for the ladies).

A marriage made in a bishopric, if not quite hell: here, in Dalgarnock, on the Ayrshire coast, outside of Glasgow and directly across the water from Northern Ireland, he is greeted as papish scum by the Protestant majority, and generally regarded as too posh and too English, the second being a considerably less pardonable offense. That Anderton is himself part Scottish  he was born in Edinburgh  scarcely matters; he has Oxbridge seasoning and cultural airs. As a whiff of life elsewhere, such a man is meant to be suffered, and little more, by such a bitterly impoverished town. But it is Andertons own quiet perversity, his abiding sense of homelessness, as he puts it, and of a life unlived, that throws this relationship into total enmity and finally into chaos.",2007-07-15T04:00:00+0000

They believe that what binds them together is not their great desire to achieve but the durability of a friendship that has lasted decades and that took root during their idyllic girlhoods in Virginia. Yet The Best of Friends seems to address ambititon as much as friendship, and how the drive to explore, and succeed, shaped these women  their relationships, careers and families  who entered the work force in the 1980s.This lively dual memoir presents their stories candidly, but it is a sign of uncertainty that the authors felt they could discuss their ambitious yearnings only through the prism of a gauzy, Hallmark-card-like friendship.",2007-07-15T04:00:00+0000

At a time when the nation looks for a leader to meet profound challenges to its decades-long dominance as an economic and military power, the five candidates who lead in state and national polls  Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney  have won a grand total of five statewide elections in their cumulative political careers and have served a combined 20 years in statewide office. (Fred Thompson, who may soon be among the leaders in the Republican field, served eight years in the Senate.) In fact, the executive with the longest tenure in the group is Giuliani, who would be the first mayor in history to ascend to the presidency without holding some higher office first. Meanwhile, candidates with long careers spent mastering foreign and domestic policy, like Joe Biden and John McCain, have been flailing.

us,No Censure for Stolen Words,"Lines that helped win immortality for Jane Austen got David Lassman a series of rejection slips, but no scolding for plagiarism, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Lassman, director of the Jane Austen Festival in Bath, England, used slightly disguised versions of chapters from Austens most famous works when he sent manuscripts to 18 editors in a bid to secure a publishing contract. Only one publisher spotted the fakes, which included the famous opening line of Pride and Prejudice (1813): It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. Mr. Lassman, who planted the line in a submission he had retitled First Impressions, told The Guardian of London: I was staggered. Here is one of the greatest writers that has lived, with her oeuvre securely fixed in the English canon and yet only one recipient recognized them as Austens work. That editor was Alex Bowler of Jonathan Cape, who wrote: Thank you for sending us the first two chapters of First Impressions. My first impression on reading these were ones of disbelief and mild annoyance, along, of course, with a moments laughter. I suggest you reach for your copy of Pride and Prejudice, which Id guess lives in close proximity to your typewriter, and make sure your opening pages dont too closely mimic that books opening.",2007-07-20T04:00:00+0000

Most of the layoffs would be of people who hold administrative positions at City Hall. Employees of the fire and police departments would be excluded.

The lawyer, Dino Lombardi, had delayed the trial by missing several days because of illness, and he told Justice Michael Gross of State Supreme Court in the Bronx this week that he was unsure when he would be able to return. The nature of the illness is unclear. His client, Edgar Morales, 25, is charged in the shooting death of Malenny Mendez outside a christening at a Bronx church in August 2002. He is the first person charged under the states antiterrorism statute approved by the Legislature after 9/11. Bronx prosecutors say that Mr. Moraless gang, the St. James Boys, had terrorized the Mexican and Mexican-American populations of the west Bronx for several years.

The compromise is similar to a plan that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had criticized as inadequate earlier this week, but nonetheless, the mayor and advocacy groups that support the charges called the deal a victory, saying it would allow the city to compete for some $500 million in federal transportation grants.

us,"Bonds vs. Reporters, Part 313","Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants took aim at a familiar target on Saturday. Not a pitcher, not Commissioner Bud Selig and not Hank Aaron. Bonds spent most of a 20-minute pregame session with reporters taking jabs at them.I got to have my tape recorder because some of you are downright dirty, said Bonds, who tapes interview sessions and posts the audio on his Web site. You all keep saying what you say and Ill keep recording it.Between Bondss sometimes playful, sometimes serious shots at reporters inside the visiting clubhouse at Miller Park, he discussed a myriad of topics. Bonds, who is three homers from passing Aarons career record of 755, said he was happy that Selig attended Fridays game. Selig was here Saturday, too.When Bonds was asked if he wanted to talk to Selig, he said, About what? We havent talked in a while. But I have respect for Bud. Like I said before, I dont care what you say or what you write. Bud has always been nice to me, always been nice to my father. I like Bud.Bonds reiterated that he respects Selig and would not lose respect for Selig if the commissioner does not shadow Bonds for his record-breaking game. Selig is expected to follow Bondss hunt for 756.If Bonds breaks Aarons record and Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees chases Bonds down, Bonds repeated that he would be in the front row to watch Rodriguez.This is our fraternity, Bonds said. If we dont stand for each other, who is going to stand behind us? Ill stand behind a fellow player, regardless.Using that logic, is Aaron refusing to stand behind Bonds by not going to Bondss games?I dont know, Bonds said. The thing is, we respect Hank regardless. Like Ive said before, its not fair, in a sense, if youre asking somebody to take away whatever they have to do. You cant predict something like this.Bonds said he feels good when he is by myself and added that he feels best when he is just like the other 24 people in here. Since Bonds has long had more privileges than any other Giant, it was a curious statement. Bonds has never wanted to be treated like every another player.Since Bonds is not scheduled to start on Sunday, his next appearance in left field will probably be on Monday. The Giants return to AT&T Park for seven games, a perfect time for Bonds to eclipse Aaron because he would be assured of being cheered. But Bonds was not predicting a timetable for the historic homer.Everybody who goes through milestones, go back and look at it, it takes a while, Bonds said.When someone reminded Bonds that the national reporters who are covering him would disperse once he gets to 756, he invited them to leave now.You all hate me anyway, Bonds said. I dont know why youre here anyway. Most of you say whatever nasty things you say about me anyway.

But only twice in his career has he reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal, and many have long sensed that his potential has been limited because he doesnt truly believe he belongs in big-time tennis. Hes cursed with the unsureness of Dave Chappelle. Blake confirms this in his memoir, Breaking Back (written with Andrew Friedman), when, early in his career, he drops a winnable match to the great Patrick Rafter. After the match, as we shook hands at the net, he leaned in close, the zinc oxide he smeared under his eyes like war paint runny with sweat: You could have beaten me today, he said, surprising me, but I had the sense that maybe you didnt believe it yourself. He paused, then said, Now do you believe? ...

And all cities, somewhere, have dark, scary streets that can, in noirs violent allegories of moral ambiguity, stand in for the dimmer, grubbier recesses of the soul.

As part of their treatment, the boys had to keep journals  which Longo read  in which they detailed their sexual fantasies and logged how frequently they masturbated to those fantasies. They created relapse-prevention plans, based on the idea that sex-offending is like an addiction and that teenagers need to be watchful of any triggers (pornography, anger) that might initiate their cycle of reoffending. And at the beginning of each group session, the boys introduced themselves much as an alcoholic begins an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting: Im Brian, and Im a sex offender.

For example, when sound recording first came along, the singers belted into it as if performing to an empty stadium. The name that springs to mind is Caruso, the world's biggest voice. But with the coming of microphones in the 1920s, singing became more personal, and the name became Bing Crosby, the world's friendliest voice. So songs became brisker and less operatic, to suit not only the mike but the piano rack and the record cabinet. In short, the familiar thirty-two-bar song, which now seems to have been fixed in the stars, was actually fixed by the practicalities of sheet-music publishing and confirmed by the limitations of ten-inch records.

us,What's on Tonight,"8 P.M. (HBO) INSIDE MAN (2006) Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster play the holy trinity, as Manohla Dargis of The New York Times put it, in this psychological thriller from Spike Lee. The action begins when Mr. Owen, above right, gazes into the camera and declares that hes going to pull off the perfect bank robbery. Oh, yeah? Mr. Washington, above left, plays the troubled veteran cop sent to take control when the Wall Street heist escalates into a hostage situation. Ms. Foster reveals some killer legs as a fixer hired by the bank, which doesnt want some especially inconvenient secrets revealed.  Inside Man has a story to tell, but its most sustained pleasures come from its performances, especially the three leads, Ms. Dargis wrote. To watch Mr. Washington breeze into a scene smooth as silk, smooth as Bogart and Easy Rawlins combined, or to listen to Mr. Owen murmur sweet nothings into the camera, is to experience the ineffable pleasures that only big-screen stars can provide.",2007-07-28T04:00:00+0000

Dr. Ellis, who died last week at 93, laid out his prescriptive calls to action in more than 75 books.

The main event is the Edinburgh International Festival, which next month will feature such productions as Orpheus X, a modern-day telling of the Orpheus myth, and a Mabou Mines staging of A Doll's House. But for many people, the real draw is the Fringe, a riotous collection of performances all around the city by hundreds of performance artists, comedians, memoirists and monologuists. The crux of the action is at the Assembly Rooms (54 George Street), one of several places where tickets are sold each day, and where hundreds of festivalgoers gather each morning  almost like theatrical futures traders  to swap information about what is causing the latest buzz, what's a must-see and what's turned out to be a flop. The great thing about many of these shows is that they often run an hour or so, and thus you know that even the most painful theatrical experience will soon come to an end if you've chosen unwisely. (Though I did once earn the lasting enmity of one playwright whose tortured attempts to tell a coherent story were so inept that I walked out about halfway through the show. The fact that there were only four other people in the audience might be why he glared at me so intently as I gently closed the theater door behind me.) Still, Edinburgh, even in August, is more than just about sitting in darkened theaters all day.

My father worked in Halabjas electricity office, and we farmed for a few months every year. When I was 4, an Iraqi Army convoy passed by our farm. It was the summer of 1983, three years into the Iran-Iraq war, and as my family stood in the fields, a rocket was fired at the convoy from the Iranian mountains. It exploded yards from our house. Shrapnel took half my right knee. My grandmother was hit in the head. She died from her injuries a few months later. Mine healed, though never fully. Halabja always seemed to be under bombardment. Finally Iraqi airplanes attacked my town with chemical weapons, killing 5,000 civilians in just a few hours. Many were family friends and relatives.

Elsewhere, she noted the books tonal shifts: You might be reading letters home from camp, where the moment before you might have thought you were deep in the Book of Leviticus. Pilgrim at Tinker Creek went on to win a Pulitzer Prize, but it did not appear on the Times best-seller list.

The airline canceled 526 flights from Friday through Sunday (out of a total 4,187). Yesterday alone, Northwest canceled 117 flights as of 6 p.m. In a memo to Northwest employees on Friday, the chief executive officer, Douglas M. Steenland, blamed pilot absenteeism for the mounting delays. Northwest canceled more than 1,000 flights in the last week of June. Northwest then thinned the July schedule in anticipation of staffing challenges, Mr. Steenland told employees. The Northwest branch of the Air Line Pilots Association said in late June that Northwest was unfairly blaming pilots for problems caused primarily by insufficient staff in a system with no slack. Northwest crews have been routinely reaching their maximum monthly limits on work hours near the end of a month. The pilots union said that cutbacks had left about 400 pilots on furlough. In his memo last week, Mr. Steenland said that all furloughed pilots wishing to return to Northwest have been notified of their dates to report for retraining.",2007-07-31T04:00:00+0000
