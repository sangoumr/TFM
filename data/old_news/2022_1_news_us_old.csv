It also won recognition at the first New York International Cheese competition, held last summer. The cheese, made from organic milk, has alluring washed rind funkiness, with a scent of dried wildflowers and a yeasty, briny tang on the palate. Eric and Molly Glasgow, the farms owners, decided to go poetic with the name instead of giving it a local tie-in. Theyve continued in that vein with most of their other cheeses, including Banneker, their newest, a Cheddar they started making during the pandemic and only sell locally.

Alex Clark  who founded the distillery with his wife, Amy Grindeland  is making it as a way to further the life of the bourbon barrels, since according to federal standards, the whiskey must be aged in new barrels.

Le Mon, a new Meyer lemon drink made in Hammondsport, N.Y., has enough bright, citric flavor to cancel winter. It is called an aperitif wine because its base alcohol is wine, from the Finger Lakes region in western New York. Eric Bachli, a former brewmaster at Sixpoint Brewery in Brooklyn, collaborated with Max Nevins, also of Sixpoint Brewery, and Marissa Reiser, a sommelier, to create the aperitif. California brandy adds a kick to the 32 proof drink. Restrained sweetening is provided by organic blue agave syrup from Mexico, and Meyer lemons, mostly from a distillate using the peels, create the lightly bitter citric profile.

This most recent venture began with a mission to find a fabric that would give garments not only a comfortable fit but also an opaque finish, a process that eventually led to a signature knit that she now uses for all of the lines pieces, from seamless ribbed sports bras to elegant long-sleeve leotards. The textile, created from a blend of strong but elastic fibers, is both quick-drying and chlorine-resistant, making it uniquely versatile. Everything is designed to be used as swimwear, sportswear, underwear or shapewear, Laub says. The fabric allows for powerful fits that provide support without a traditional under-wiring structure. Sustainability is also at the forefront of her vision: Each collection is made in Italy using 3-D knitting techniques that create less waste. Furthermore, clothes that serve multiple purposes, says Laub, encourage shoppers to buy better and buy less.",2022-01-12T17:06:40+0000

The chef is Nicole Gajadhar from Saxon & Parole and the chef John Frasers restaurants. Her menu is luxurious, featuring oysters, caviar service, tuna tartare, foie gras, potato with caviar, gnudi with truffles, a club sandwich and a burger. The beverage director, Ashley Santoro from the Standard hotels, has assembled a list of classic cocktails, including a few nonalcoholic choices.

McShea started out in photography while Mosa trained as a goldsmith, but the two, now partners in work and in life, have long been preoccupied with the interaction between fabric and the elements. In 2018, inspired by the Baroque frescoes at the 13th-century Palazzo Monti, in Brescia, Italy, where they were artists-in-residence, they developed a series of ephemeral sculptures by wrapping stone staircases in ribbons and photographing fabric in water. As an afterthought, they also created a flag made of ribbons fixed to a cardboard tube with masking tape. Though it was simple, they felt it had power and, sure enough, things took off two summers later, when the duo began sewing colorful hand-dyed silks, deadstock ribbons and tulle to lengths of ribbon that, doubled over, acted as halyards  or, as they refer to them, hoist ribbons  and tying those with simple bows to scavenged bamboo poles, which they planted on the beaches of Fire Island Pines.",2022-01-24T21:46:29+0000

She is also producing dishes like Japanese sardines with mayonnaise potato and peppers, mussels with onion glaze, squab with buckwheat honey and fermented radicchio, monkfish with wakame and black quinoa, and a winter Pavlova dessert with angel hair squash, citron confit and citrus curd.

A year earlier, Fanone was a 40-year-old Metropolitan Police Department (M.P.D.) officer trying to hold off an angry mob outside the United States Capitol. The rioters pulled him from a tunnel and down a set of steps, pummeled him with their fists and their feet and even the staff of an American flag and tased him numerous times; in the melee, he suffered both a heart attack and a traumatic brain injury. Now Fanone was outside the Capitol again, on the set of CNNs New Day morning show, sitting next to its hosts, John Berman and Brianna Keilar. He wore faded jeans and a red-and-black plaid parka, in stark contrast to Bermans and Keilars news-anchor attire. With his heavy beard and a turtleneck of tattoos peeking out from underneath his collar, he looked like some sort of punk lumberjack. He sounded like one too. When Keilar asked him to share some of the conversations he was having with police officers as the anniversary approached, Fanone acidly noted that the U.S. Capitol Police have to walk the same halls as some of these insurrectionist members of Congress, before adding, I couldnt imagine sharing a work space with those jackasses.",2022-01-26T10:00:12+0000

You could call its arrival a return: In the 1890s, Jkichi Takamine, a Japanese chemist who married an American woman, settled in Chicago and started producing koji-fermented whiskey. After the distillery was destroyed by a fire, he turned to medical research in New York and went on to isolate chemical adrenaline.

If he werent an artist, though, he might be a linguist, a semiotics professor or a rapper. Or at least thats the sense you get after spending time with his Slanguage paintings, which are imbued with messages that arent immediately apparent, and that often require knowledge of wordplay to decode. The series began, in 2019, as a shout-out to regional slang from Oakland, Calif., and the rest of the Bay Area. Take Yay Area (2020), a realist composition that brings together recognizable and mundane food items: a Coca-Cola bottle turned on its side, a chocolate layer cake atop a pedestal and a glass bowl filled with scoops of vanilla ice cream. At first glance, the still life, which recalls the work of the American painter Wayne Thiebaud, impresses with its skill and precision and evokes nostalgia for sugary childhood treats. Depending on your familiarity with certain hip-hop lyrics, though, it may later occur to you that the artist has depicted foods whose names, like the Yay of the title, are slang for cocaine (coke, cola, cake), and one that references the Oakland artist Dru Downs 1993 song Ice Cream Man, its title an allusion to a drug dealer (though hes hardly the only rapper to have used the term).
