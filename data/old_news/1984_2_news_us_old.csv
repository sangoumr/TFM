The first widely ballyhooed cable network, MTV (Music TeleVision), got that way by showing snippets of audio- visual excess known as rock videos, Eastman Kodak, which made snapshot photography a universal language a century ago, last month introduced its first video products, including an 8mm taping and playback system clearly intended for the amateur market - a system that may become the Brownie of the 1980's. And in December the Museum of Modern Art, in one of its relatively rare ventures into contemporary art, brought us ''Video Art: A History,'' an exhibition that chronicled artists' use of video since the first portable video camera was marketed in the mid- 60's.

The proposed merger is similar to another between LTV Corporation's Jones & Laughlin steel unit and Republic Steel. If the Justice Department approves these deals, the U.S. industry, which has suffered considerably from foreign competition, is expected to shrink and become more efficient by the end of the decade. National Intergroup would be left essentially with financial services and aluminum operations. U.S. Steel has been closing inefficient plants to bolster its profitability and the acquisition of National's business, the seventh-largest in the steel industry, would be another step in that direction. National's operations are mainly in steel for consumer goods, a profitable area in which U.S. Steel is weak. Those plant closings were costly for U.S. Steel. It reported a widened loss of $983 million for the fourth quarter of 1983, primarily a result of the asset write-down from the closings, plus weak steel and oil results.",1984-02-05T05:00:00+0000

Before long, he finds himself on his own and eventually he must confront his murderous grandfather. ''The Lonesome Gods'' has all the ingredients found in Mr. L'Amour's western novels, including rousing action and interesting footnotes on history and lore, according to our reviewer, Mel Watkins.

A constitutional lawyer seeks ''to illustrate the whole process of legal repression'' in discussions of law, politics and power in public, private, covert and overt forms. Focusing on Tokyo Rose, Ezra Pound and others, his essays show how the Government came close to turning hundreds of apparently neutral laws into instruments of tyranny in the 1950's and how the legal system itself ultimately thwarted the effort.",1984-02-05T05:00:00+0000

Whiteman's purpose in putting together the concert was to ''legitimize'' jazz, which was at that time considered an exotic and rather scandalous entertainment. An audience that included Jascha Heifetz, Serge Rachmaninoff, Igor Stravinsky and Virgil Thomson was in attendance. Although several popular composers, among them Victor Herbert and Zez Confrey, wrote material for the concert, the most memorable event of the day, which transformed Whiteman's experiment into an instant musical legend, was the world premiere of an original work for piano and jazz band by George Gershwin, the ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' with the composer at the keyboard.",1984-02-05T05:00:00+0000

They knew the basement, too. This was the space in the Graphic Artists Union that the authorities opened to avant-garde art in the wake of the furor over the bulldozing of an unofficial outdoor exhibition in 1974.

us,BEING NEAR AND LIVING FAR APART,"INGER J. RILEY and Martha of tee Strout have been friends for 21 years. Several times a month, they discuss everything from classical music to current events. They reminisce about trips they took abroad, speculate about what they will do in the future and talk about their jobs. ""Our friendship is one of the best things in my life,"" Mrs. Strout said. ""I don't know what I would do without it."" Mrs. Riley agrees. ""We are incredibly close,"" she said. ""I can tell Martha anything because she always understands and gives me the emotional support I need."" What is significant about their friendship is that the women live more than 1,000 miles apart - Mrs. Riley in Milwaukee and Mrs. Strout in Melrose, Mass. They have not lived in the same community since 1966. Long-distance friendships are increasingly common, according to experts who observe how friendship develops. Some Americans, they say, look to friends who have moved away for the emotional support that previous generations got from families. ""Long-distance friendships are important because they serve as markers in people's lives,"" said Dr. Dorothy C. Krugman, a child psychologist with the Children's Aid Society. ""They remind people of who they are and where they came from."" The experience of Mrs. Riley and Mrs. Strout bears that out. ""Nobody knows us the way the other one does because we have gone through everything from high school to raising kids together,"" Mrs. Riley said. ""We can communicate because we know what has shaped our thinking."" They met in 1963 when Mrs. Riley came from Norway to stay with Mrs. Strout's family as an exchange student. They corresponded when Mrs. Riley returned home and became even closer when Mrs. Riley moved back to the United States and married a friend of Mr. Strout's. Long-distance friendships also enable some people like Margherita Hawkins, a nurse at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, to expand their interests. Her hobby is English and American country dancing, and she exchanges dance music tapes with her former teacher, who lives near Cleveland. ""Talking with my teacher keeps me up on what is happening in dance in other parts of the country,"" she said. ""I get a different perspective."" Long-distance friendships can be invaluable in crises, as Barbara, a Manhattan banker, discovered. She used to telephone her best friend in another town several times a week when she was having problems at work. Her friend gave her advice that she couldn't seek from colleagues because she felt that would have jeopardized her position at the bank. Maintaining such friendships is not easy. Some people mistakenly assume that someone they have fond memories of but have not spoken to in years is a close friend. ""To have a true friendship, you have to do more than exchange Christmas cards or call each other once a year,"" said Dr. Dolores Kreisman, a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. ""There has to be some continued support and attention; otherwise the relationship is a sentimental attachment rather than a true friendship."" Long-distance friends often feel closer than do friends who live in the same city, Dr. Kreisman said. ""The petty jealousies and other minor things that destroy ordinary friendships don't occur because such friends tend to concentrate on the positive aspects of their relationship,"" she said. ""Sometimes distance adds to the intimacy because they know that their long-distance friends will not reveal anything to anyone in their present environment."" Such friendships may not last forever. Dr. Krugman said: ""Long-distance friends tend to let the relationship go when that part of themselves that they wanted to preserve is no longer important to them. A woman who was active in theater will keep up her friendship with a friend who was also active in the theater as long as that part of her life is still important to her. If she gets interested in something else in her new community, she may end the friendship."" Face-to-face meetings may help break up a relationship if the friends find they have little in common, but may also make a friendship closer. ""Spending some time last summer together brought Martha and me closer,"" Mrs. Riley said. ""I discovered even more things I liked and shared with my friend."" - RELATIONSHIPS",1984-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,POOR ADVICE ON U.S. POLICY TOWARD YUGOSLAVIA Having spent two years in Bel,"grade as a Fulbright Fellow studying Yugoslav courts (1981-83), I find that Felice Gaer's article does not reflect the realities of life in Yugoslavia. Her charges are at best overstated, at worst simply false. Specifically: Gaer's assertion that the Yugoslav press is fettered indicates that she does not read it. I was astonished, on arriving in Belgrade, at how free the political discussion in the press is. Recent articles have been blunt about the sources of Yugoslavia's economic troubles and have raised serious questions about the political system. If some of these points have been expressed indirectly, the Yugolavs certainly have been able to understand what was being said. Nor are ''political cases'' hushed up. Rather - and ironically - Amnesty International's main source of information on Yugoslavia seems to be the Yugoslav press. This hardly bespeaks censorship. Gaer asserts that Yugoslavia has ''one of the highest rates of political prisoners in Eastern Europe.'' This assertion is simply not credible. No one who has lived there would put Yugoslavia in the same league as the Warsaw Pact countries, to say nothing of at the head of that league. She calls for repealing the law on ''hostile propaganda'' and releasing the ''500 or more'' people interned under that law. To judge from the Amnesty International report on Yugoslavia for 1982, most of these people are there because of their efforts (Serbian, Croatian, Albanian, Islamic) to balkanize the Yugoslav state. Freedom of opinion is, of course, a lovely ideal.",1984-02-11T05:00:00+0000

The magazine Good Housekeeping polled its readers and found that, while Ronald Reagan was first among men the readers admired, the Rev. Jerry Falwell was second, with the Rev. Billy Graham third. Mr. Falwell, besides being the leader of the Moral Majority, is the host of the ''Old Time Gospel Hour.'' Meanwhile, for the second year in a row, Mr. Reagan has spoken at the annual convention of the National Religious Broadcasters, pressing his position on school prayer and abortion. The assembled ministers loved the President; it is reasonable to assume some of them will talk about him on their broadcasts.

''Sar Allah,'' (''Warriors of God''), some of the headbands read in Farsi script, identifying the wearers as divinely designated martyrs who will use their keys to go directly to heaven if killed in the holy war against Iraq declared by their leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomei ni. The headbands and the keys are worn by young boys, aged 12 to 17, who are recruited by local clergy or simply rounded up in the villages of Iran, given an intensive indoctrination in the Shiite tradition of martyrdom, and then sent weaponless into battle against Iraqi armor. Often bound together in groups of 20 by ropes to prevent the fainthearted from deserting, they hurl themselves on barbed wire or march into Iraqi mine fields in the face of withering machine-gun fire to clear the way for Iranian tanks.

us,BEATING THE DRUMSTIC,"T IS UNDENIABLY true that, if you work professionally in the food field, you almost inevitably wind up with a trend or two. One ''trend'' that we have followed recently is stuffed boneless chicken - in one form or another. It all began when we invited four well-known chefs from France into the kitchen, and they prepared stuffed boneless chicken legs and thighs, both of which may seem basic and boring to the home cook. As prepared by those chefs, however, they become sublime. After pursuing this, we progressed to stuffed boneless chicken breasts and, more recently, to the stuffing and deep frying of drumsticks. We can assure you that the end result is a far-from-pedestrian exercise in eating. And we have discovered that the kinds of fillings to be used in stuffing those drumsticks or chicken legs are endless. The ones that we used most successfully were with sausage, with chopped chicken livers and with chopped chicken and mushrooms. The preparation of the chicken legs, which is to say the boning, is simplicity itself. You simply scrape around the bone, top to bottom, and the meat loosens easily. When the bone is chopped away (you leave a small portion of the base), you are left with a cavity to be filled according to whim.",1984-02-12T05:00:00+0000

The chairman added that Congress and the Administration would have to cut up to $125 billion in the next two years to make any substantive progress. As a result of his warnings, the stock market plunged and it appeared that Wall Street suddenly became concerned about the $200 billion annual deficits.

In the past year, it has been possible to attend New York performances by such splendid artists as Joan Sutherland, Alfredo Kraus, Marilyn Horne, Montserrat Caballe, Placido Domingo and Kathleen Battle, among others. Any era that can produce such a roster can hardly be considered vocally deficient. In addition, many music lovers simply don't want to put up with the antiquated sound of early recordings.

''La Mere Coupable,'' or ''The Guilty Mother,'' follows the further fortunes of several characters that the French dramatist sketched so indelibly in his ''Barber of Seville'' and ''Marriage of Figaro.'' Milhaud, late in his career, made an opera out of ''La M ere Coupable'' and Gretry is known to have considered an opera on the subject. However, the play has attracted few other important composers during the nearly two centuries of its existence. The earlier adventures of Figaro and his friends, on the other hand, have inspired at least 40 opera composers, according to the reference books.",1984-02-12T05:00:00+0000

A stalemate in the Politburo would give the Communist Party's Central Committee an opportunity to review the issue. The Committee is expected to meet today. (Page A1, Column 6.) State Department sources believe that the new Soviet leader will be Konstantin U. Chernenko, 72 years old, who was a close associate of Leonid I. Brezhnev.

Obviously, parallels can be drawn in the careers of the two composers: Both worked in Vienna, for instance, Schubert at the bridge between the Classic and the Romantic periods, Berg at a time when Romantic movement was in its final throes and entering the modern era.

Since the marines arrived in Beirut in September 1982, President Reagan has articulated three basic American goals - the removal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the extension of the Government's authority throughout the country and the rebuilding of the Lebanese Army. Army Has Collapsed Instead, it is the American peacekeepers who are retiring to their ships in frustration; the American-sponsored troop withdrawal agreement of last May has been torn up; the territory under the control of the central Government has now shrunk to the fence around the Presidential palace and even that is no longer secure; and the army has collapsed along religious lines after two days of serious fighting with ragtag militiamen. ''The United States is lucky that Lebanon is not that strategically important,'' Ghassan Salameh, a top Lebanese international affairs expert, said. ''If it had made the same miscalculations in dealing with a strategically important ally like Saudi Arabia or Pakistan that it did here, the destruction to American interests would have been enormous.'' If the Lebanese had serious questions about the purposes and effectiveness of United States policy, so did other friendly nations in the Middle East as well as critics at home.

After almost four years of strong Reagan leadership, it is clear that the two parties are looking at the country from opposite ideological directions. There is a big difference between seeing a big, clumsy government as protector or as oppressor, as friend or as foe. The difference has not changed the governing of the United States - yet.

The United States offer contradicted its policy toward the P.L.O. since 1975, which is based on nonrecognition of the P.L.O. until it recognizes Israel as a nation. (1:5.)",1984-02-19T05:00:00+0000

These days, theater is a special interest, occupying a ghetto on the cultural landscape.

Seated opposite the dancers in rehearsal and moving angularly in her chair, she may demonstrate, for example, the alignment of the shoulder in relationship to the pelvis in a turn. ''Work on it,'' she urged in a recent rehearsal. ''Now it means nothing. Don't do that turn because you're told to do it.

The films are usually as forgettable as the books, but there is no denying they sell and, in today's publishing and film-producing markets, that is the one criterion that gets executives to humming. Obviously aware that mini- series were were going to enjoy more popularity on television, Mr. Sheldon has designed his latest entertainment package around ''Master of the Game,'' a sprawling story that begins in 1883 and ends, after an interminable string of tragedies and crises, in 1982. The novel has been on both the hard-cover and paperback best-seller lists. Now, although published just two years ago, it has been adapted into a nine-hour, three-episode series that begins tonight on CBS from 8 to 11.

The huge canvas disturbed the salon audience greatly, because though on a scale normally reserved for historical epics, it was, in the words of the historian Lorenz Eitner ''a tragedy without a hero, a scene of physical suffering without redemption.''",1984-02-19T05:00:00+0000

On Jan. 25,Mint Director Donna K. Pope announced that her agency had scrapped the old designation as the ''Bureau of the Mint'' and substituted ''United States Mint.'' ''I felt that the term 'bureau' was a confusing one to the public,'' Mrs. Pope explained. ''It did not clearly identify us as the historic Mint of the United States. Additionally, the 'bureau' designation conjures up too many negative images of the stereotyped bureaucrat, images which do not fit our aggressive marketing programs.'' Various private mints have sprung up in the last two decades. The Franklin Mint has become widely known among large segments of American society. To some extent, private mints have tended to blur distinction from the government mint. By simplifying its name, the United States Mint presumably hopes to underscore the difference. The legislation establishing the national mint, in 1792, referred to it simply as ''the Mint.'' Subsequent legislation, beginning the following year, expanded this name to ''Mint of the United States.'' With passage of the wide-ranging Coinage Act of 1873, it formally became a bureau of the Department of the Treasury. According to Mrs. Pope, the latest name change was approved by Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan. In prior years, she noted, the U.S. Customs Service and the Internal Revenue Service both had discontinued use of the word ''bureau'' as part of their formal names.",1984-02-26T05:00:00+0000

In a more divided opinion, the court ruled 5-to-4 that once a company has filed a bankrutpcy petition, it can unilaterally end all labor contracts, while it is waiting for the court's ultimate permission. The rulings involved the Bildisco Manufacturing Company of New Jersey and its 1980 bankruptcy filing, yet it supported actions by the Wilson Food Corporation, Braniff Airways and Continental Air Lines, which filed for Chapter 11 reorganization last year and unilaterally ended all contracts with their unions. The Court also gave a victory to the I.R.S. in its long-running battle over interest-free loans made by one family member to another.

The task force cited Puerto Rico's 18-month experience with a similar program, asserting that it had been a success well worth replicating in the United States. ''The elimination of food vouchers,'' the task force said, ''would make the system more efficient, simpler to manage, less expensive to administer and would reduce the stigma associated with participation.''

After all, during the last year of his life, Schubert had attained a new maturity: As fine as much of his earlier work had been - and ''Gretchen am Spinnrade,'' which he tossed off in a single afternoon at the age of 16, is one of the most perfect songs ever written - the composer's last pieces have a power and poignancy unique in the annals of music.",1984-02-26T05:00:00+0000

In February 1981, a show of his late paintings at the Pace Gallery in New York made it clear that, to quote one review, ''one of the things that we most need is a thoughtful and independent survey of the work of Picasso in old age.'' It took time, but as of this Friday and through May 6, we can see ''Picasso : The Last Years, 1963-1973'' at the Guggenheim Museum. Not only will the work be there in depth, but we shall see it in isolation, rather than as an appendage to one of the most glorious careers in 20th-century art.",1984-02-26T05:00:00+0000

A niche points the way to Mecca. Colored marble, chopped and chiseled, makes for the most glassy and elegant of floors. The ceilings are celestially high. Light peeks in high overhead through panels of stained glass. Porcelain, velvet, embroidery, painting, calligraphy, wood gilded and fretted - all are put through their paces. Sofas rise only to ankle height. A very small fountain chuckles away at our feet. It is a privilege to see domestic spaces as nobly ordered as these.",1984-02-26T05:00:00+0000

It is incumbent on them to look good while responding to questions, a requirement that impinges on and shapes their answers. How a candidate appears to answer a question is at least as important as the content of his answer, and the trick is to appear to be giving an answer even when there is no answer to give. Consequently, candidates do not always answer the questions they are asked; they answer instead the questions they wish they had been asked. Examples abound.",1984-02-26T05:00:00+0000

The Italian and British contingents in the multinational force have also left, leaving only the 1,250-man French unit in Beirut. The French are apparently waiting for a United Nations force to replace it. (Page A1, Column 6.)
