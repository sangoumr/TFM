By sampling favorite vamps and drumbeats, hip-hop producers built rhythm tracks without live musicians. They gained control, but traded away the give-and-take of a working band. The old symbiosis of band, singer and audience, forged in gospel churches and rhythm-and-blues clubs, eroded as machines took over. Yet hip-hop also preserved and rediscovered vintage funk riffs. During the 1990's, live bands have made a modest comeback, partly because sources began demanding payment for samples and partly because ballads demand a responsive band.",1997-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Karen became board certified as a family law specialist and practiced law in Houston for many years. Karen's great love of contemporary art permeated her life. She was a friend and supporter of many artists and an avid collector. Karen served on the board of Houston's Contemporary Arts Museum and the Yale Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut. Karen was deeply devoted to her religion. A member of Congregation Beth Israel, she held leadership positions in many local and national Jewish organizations. Most recently she served as Chair of the Anti-Defamation League's Southwest Region, as a member of the ADL's National Board of Directors, and as a founding director of the National Jewish Democratic Council. Karen was active in politics for many years. Upon learning of her death, President Clinton called Karen's family from Air Force One to express his condolences and tell them how much he had liked and admired her.

Vaus was born into a minister's family in Los Angeles, California, on February 17, 1919, and grew up in Texas. Following a military career he became a wiretapper for organized crime, but in 1949 at age 30 he became Christian, committing his life to Christ at the Greater Los Angeles Billy Graham crusade. For the next nine years, with his wife Alice, he traveled on four continents witnessing with the aid of electrical inventions to the change Christ had made in his life. A film ''Wiretapper'' resulted. In 1958 he launched Youth Development, Inc., a ministry to troubled youth in Spanish Harlem of New York City, where he was used to lead many gang members into Christian service. In the years that followed he established numerous youth services around the country, moving his headquarters to San Diego, CA where he established a nationwide youth crisis hotline, 1800-HIT-HOME, that still receives thousands of calls monthly. Vaus' latest ministry originated from a donated property in the mountains of Virginia in 1995. He established a retreat center for youth and was there at the time of his death. He is survived by his wife, Alice (whose book described their early travels), five children, ten grandchildren, all of Virginia, and two sisters, Elizabeth Rothenberger and Virginia McLaughlin of California.

But in a social season that crams 300 benefits into three months, turning City Opera's gala, a lavish dinner following a new production of ''Macbeth,'' into a Cinderella of fund-raisers took more than the wave of a wand. The strategizing involved everything from the timing of the benefit, the naming of chairmen and selection of an honoree to the recruiting of benefit committee members and the raising of a well-heeled army of benefactors, sponsors and patrons. Choosing a Sept. 11 date, for example, was gamble, since the social lions are just returning to the city from their summer homes. On the other hand, there is little competition. A lot hinged on the invitation, in which strategically placed names are supposed to have a come-hither, come-donate effect. Invitations speak to those who can decipher them.

Additionally, he served as president of the Jewelers' Vigilance Committee and as a result of his tireless work with the JVC, was appointed to oversee the revision and updating of the Jewelry Trade Practice Rules of the Federal Trade Commission. As was noted in the Jewelers' Circular-Keystone, a trade journal for the industry, in July 1996: ''This revision could not have happened without the incredible dedication and hard work of Vermont jeweler Bill Preston in his role as JVC's point man in the Guides project.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Where Sorrow Never Came,"Never has the leisure of the privileged class seemed more appealing than in the photographs of Jacques-Henri Lartigue (1894-1986). Born to a French family of talented amateurs with the means to indulge every amusing hobby, he was given his first camera at the age of 8. By his early teens, he had produced virtuoso images of such wit, charm and seemingly effortless technique that few have ever surpassed them. Lartigue focused his camera on family, friends and the fashionable strangers he saw on outings; he took photos for his own pleasure that he kept in special albums. Only after a lifetime working as a moderately successful painter did his photography career flourish, with a solo show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1963, when he was 69. The images in LARTIGUE'S RIVIERA (Flammarion, $35) show a place of civilized leisure, energized by a sense of novelty still possible in the 1920's and 30's, when most of these pictures were made. Lartigue shows a land where a benevolent sun shines on women and water, cars, painted fingernails, tennis champs, swimmers -- a sensual topography of blonde and brunette. Those familiar with Lartigue's early work will recognize the sensibility driving the images of water-ski jumping, of exercises on the beach, and of Noisette, a small black poodle depicted hurtling itself toward the lens. Lartigue has created a world like that of the 18th-century painter Fragonard -- enchanting and frivolous, with life's disappointments and sorrow well out of frame.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; The Missing Digit,"Though it's set in the month before Christmas, Shena Mackay's novel AN ADVENT CALENDAR (Moyer Bell, $19.95) immediately subverts any expectation of holiday coziness. The book opens with a butcher accidentally chopping off his finger, which drops unseen into a mincer and disappears into the meat that John, a central character, takes home for his Uncle Cecil. Such a devilish fusion of tragedy and black humor is one way that Mackay continually renews this tale of crushing poverty and lonely domestic life in a British working-class town. Another is her spare yet wildly evocative prose, which shapes the dreary milieu with a startling, cut-crystal sharpness as it swiftly constructs two interlocking stories. The first involves John and Marguerite, a young, unemployed, unhappily married couple who avoid homelessness by moving in with John's elderly uncle. John worries about making amends to the fingerless butcher while Marguerite cares for their two young children and indulges in a secret affair. Meanwhile, from across town and a loose family connection comes the dire story of Joy Pickering, a 15-year-old outcast whose unhappiness renders her easy sexual prey for a humorously pompous poet. Originally published in Britain in 1971, ''An Advent Calendar'' has a plot that's more roughly hewn, more glaring and strange, than Mackay's recent work. Nevertheless, once the last double doors of the calendar are opened she deftly reveals a moving and inventive redemption. Megan Harlan",1997-12-14T05:00:00+0000

He challenged us to design creative and innovative new approaches, and supported our efforts to serve inner city teens in a holistic and caring manner. He brought an active and keen intellect to the challenges that our patient population can make to traditional health services. He also brought a wry and gentle humor. Working with him was always stimulating, challenging and enjoyable. David Ott was a very special person. We will miss him greatly.

Truman Capote, who went there a great deal as a young man newly arrived in New York, thought of it as a place where he could take shelter; Wendy Wasserstein, who wrote significant parts of two of her plays there, uses the word heaven.

He played a pivotal role in the establishment of our academic affiliation with Elmhurst Hospital Center, a relationship which he guided as Elmhurst's Director of Medicine during the formative years that were the foundation for what has become one of the most productive associations of its kind, significantly enhancing the delivery of health care services in Queens.

The notion that life is a form of obsessive play is not new, but seldom has it been pursued with such single-mindedness as in this cerebral, fatalistic narrative, fluently translated from the Italian by Jon Rothschild, in which ruthless checkmates are chillingly identified with Hitler's ''final solution.'' The book's title refers to a variation in Black's strategy that introduces an element of creative chaos into White's illusion of order; it is invented by Tabori, a chess master who is an inmate at the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen. The ploy receives its name not from Tabori but from his captor, who at once admires and despises it. At the beginning of the narrative -- which is really the story's end -- this former Nazi, now an important citizen of Vienna, is found dead at the center of a garden shaped to look like a chessboard. From the outset, we are given to understand that the apparent suicide is in fact an execution born of vengeance. The chess pieces alongside this construction are topiary bushes formed to look like bishops or knights. It is a fine irony that when the king dies, in this remotest of endgames, the pieces that should be defending him are helplessly rooted to the ground. William Ferguson",1997-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The Scarry Story,"Perhaps the most popular -- but least appreciated by adults -- author and illustrator of books for very young children from the 1950's through the 80's was Richard Scarry (1919-94). To grown-ups his work, like ''Richard Scarry's Best Word Book Ever'' (1963), looked clumsy and cluttered and full of chunky anthropomorphized animal figures. To children around the world the books were (and are) almost pure magic, full of important information about the stuff of everyday life. Walter Retan, Scarry's editor, and Ole Risom, his art director, have compiled an affectionate homage, THE BUSY, BUSY WORLD OF RICHARD SCARRY (Abrams, $39.95). The narrative is dull -- Scarry's was not an adventurous life -- but the captions to the copious illustrations of Huckle Cat, Lowly Worm and the gang, and the discussion of technique and intent, are filled with analytic insight. The authors point out that it was Scarry's gift to create ''situations to demonstrate word meanings rather than simply identifying objects.'' He drew stories and then added text to fit the pictures. The heroine of ''In the City'' is a tiny mouse who has bought a book at a bookstore and plans to join friends for a lemonade across town -- that is, on the opposite page. The text tells the toddler: ''Show with your finger the way she will go. Remember to have her look both ways before she crosses a street.'' Having heard the words just once, perhaps while sitting in an adult lap, how many children over how many years have sat poring over the picture, studying vehicles, stores, creatures and activities? And remembered to look both ways? Richard Scarry's legacy is glorious. Eden Ross Lipson",1997-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,The Owner of La Caravelle Does Champage His Way,"ORDER a glass of Champagne, without specifying a brand, at La Caravelle, one of New York's oldest and best-loved French restaurants, and you will almost certainly be served -- La Caravelle. Emulating top Paris restaurants like Lucas-Carton and Taillevent, Andre Jammet, the owner of La Caravelle, decided to offer his patrons a Champagne bottled expressly for him. The Champagne is made by La Goutte d'Or, a cooperative in Vertus, a town in the part of the Champagne region known as the Cotes des Blancs because it is where most of the chardonnay grapes that go into Champagne are grown. La Caravalle is not a blanc des blancs, or all-chardonnay blend, but chardonnay is an important factor in the wine. It adds a touch of elegance and lightness to an otherwise full-bodied wine. La Caravelle, the Champagne, sells for $58 a bottle or $12 a glass at La Caravelle, the restaurant. Which puts it below the brand-named nonvintage bruts. Veuve Clicquot sells for $89 at the restaurant, Moet & Chandon for $85, Mumm Cordon Rouge for $72 and Perrier-Jouet for $62. La Caravelle is certainly the best place to drink the Champagne of the same name. But not the only place. Morrell & Company, the wine merchant at 535 Madison Avenue (between 54th and 55th Streets), sells it for $22.50, quite reasonable for a Champagne of this quality. FRANK J.

Since that time, she has played a pivotal role in numerous administrative and organizational enhancements that have contributed to the success of the School of Medicine, with broad responsibilities ranging from resource allocation to faculty recruitment and appointments as well as oversight of many school-wide programs, including Ethics In Research and departmental evaluations. Respected for her knowledge and skill, she also was as warm and personable as she was talented, a woman of intellect and wit with whom it was a joy and a privilege to be associated. She will be remembered fondly, and her loss dearly felt.

Kennedy & Co., Inc., began his career as a plasterer for the old Davis, Brown Company. He was born in Manhattan's Harlem and attended Townsend Harris High School. ''Back then, it was a high school for City College,'' he recalled. Mr. Kennedy completed an accelerted threeyear program at Townsend and then took courses at the Mechanical Institute, New York City. After several years as a plasterer, James Gerard Kennedy founded James G. Kennedy & Co., Inc. in 1935. After serving his country as a highly-decorated World War II veteran with the Army Corps of Engineers, his first significant project involved a major renovation for Bankers Trust company at 14 Wall Street. The Kennedy Company has since done multiple major renovations for the same client for over 60 years. A landmark project in the company's history was actually made into a motion picture by the New York Telephone Company. The film was titled ''The Miracle of Second Avenue.'' It told the story of how ''Ma Bells'' main switching center, devastated by fire, was restored to 100% working order in record time-with the help of James G. Kennedy & Co., Inc. under the leadership of its President, James G. Kennedy, Sr. Mr. Kennedy's career has been marked by ongoing involvement in industry, civic and religious activities. He has served as the President of The Building Contractors Association (''BCA'') of the City of New York, and has been a Committee Member and a member of the Board of Directors of the BCA. Mr. Kennedy also helped to maintain the integrity of the famous Heisman Trophy when he served as a Governor of the Downtown Athletic Club (home of the Heisman Trophy) in New York City. As Chairman of the Executive Council of the American Irish Historical Society, he was responsible for the reconstruction of the entire Fifth Avenue headquarters of the Society. Mr. Kennedy has been honored by The American Jewish Committee as ''Man Of The Year,'' and in 1989 he was honored by The Dominican Academy as ''A Catholic Gentleman'' for his generosity in constructing the James G. Kennedy Science Center at the school. Mr. Kennedy is also a Knight of Malta. Mr. Kennedy married the former Rita Masset in Manhattan's St. Partrick's Cathedral. They will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary next year. Mr. Kennedy is survived by his wife Rita, son James G. Kennedy Jr. Funeral Mass today 10 AM at Sts.

The tops of the tallest grasses and weeds protrude from the whiteness, their shapes revealed with peculiar clarity. On sharp days when there has been light wind and a new inch or two, the weed stems cut a V in the snow. When the wind has been especially strong, the weed tops leave a distinctive print, a brush mark, on the surface.",1997-12-28T05:00:00+0000

To Linc Madison, an area-code buff based in San Francisco, new digits are a source of endless pleasure. Madison, a 34-year-old telecommunications consultant, displays on a Web site his encyclopedic knowledge of codes and their 50-year history. He also likes to play trivia games like, say, calculating the number of code zones you would drive through on imaginary trips from Fredericksburg, Va., to Salem, Mass. ''If you made that trip in 1947, you would go through 11 area codes. If you do it today, you're up to 26,'' he says authoritatively. Madison admits that this is an acquired taste.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Something Like Hell,"When Chaim Skibelski is shot dead and tossed into a pit along with all the other Jewish citizens of a small town in wartime Poland, his trials are only beginning. Scrambling up from this mass grave, the spectral Chaim wanders the countryside (at times guided by his murdered rabbi, who has turned into a crow), his afterlife a remarkable journey of discovery that leads a long way from a peaceful, nurturing eternity. At first harrowing, Joseph Skibell's debut novel, A BLESSING ON THE MOON (Algonquin, $21.95), proceeds to startle and challenge as it refuses to exploit the ready pathos of the Holocaust, testing its hero's endurance and the reader's expectations. Chaim's journey illuminates the horror of history through the energy and wisdom of fantasy and myth; scene after scene is rich with emotion, humor and invention. Daring in its haunting, often painful honesty, dense in thoughtful observation and unsparing incident, the novel aims for literary status while at the same time proving itself an unlikely page-turner. An act of commemoration (as many as 18 members of the author's family perished in the Holocaust), ''A Blessing on the Moon'' is also a confirmation that no subject lies beyond the grasp of a gifted, committed imagination.

This committee's proposal is clearly an 11th-hour developers' Christmas wish. The residents of Melville and Dix Hills surrounding this 460 acres in the middle of an official state Special Groundwater Protection Area strongly oppose commercial development at his site. After working for two years with state and Huntington Town officials, at the cost of $500,000, an impressive plan to build senior citizen and single family residences is ready to receive bids to implement it. Huntington's showcase of commercial development is on the impressive Route 110 corridor, not in the middle of a residential neighborhood. And new residences are much more certain to generate taxes at this site than any commercial property will, at least judging by the tax and power subsidies the state was prepared to offer in connection with the infamous ''Olympus project.''",1997-12-28T05:00:00+0000

From 1967 to 1977 Hoving was the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was noted for his blockbuster exhibitions; another kind of blockbuster mentality -- that of hyperbole -- marks this book. While some of his choices are obvious and unavoidable -- like Michelangelo's ''David'' and Picasso's ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' -- there are surprises like works by Fragonard, George Bellows and Balthus, and a little-known Jay DeFeo painting, ''The Rose,'' which Hoving calls ''one of the most expressive statements in the entire last third of the 20th century.'' Another surprising inclusion is Gainsborough's ''Blue Boy''; but when Hoving says ''that impossibly blue costume'' may be ''perhaps the most invigorating passage of paint in all of the 18th century,'' many readers will be persuaded. In the end, Hoving's erudition and enthusiasm make his book fascinating; he has the ability to make the reader see what he sees. Robin Lippincott",1997-12-28T05:00:00+0000

The courtier, Castiglione declared, was modest, well spoken and wise. He spoke Italian, French and Spanish, and never lied, gossiped or flattered others foolishly.

Adored father and grandfather, brother, uncle, true friend to many, creative entrepreneur and lion-heart, passed away on the morning of December 26, in London, with his family by his side. He was 84. Born in Teheran, he graduated valedictorian from the American College and began his long and many faceted business career with the Anglo Iranian Oil Company. He made his way to NYC on a long and adventure-filled journey aboard a Dutch trading ship in 1940-41, in the thick of WW II's Pacific Theater. He was amongst the original handful of Iranian immigrants to arrive in NYC and he quickly established various trading and manufacturing businesses during and after the war. He was responsible for bringning his large extended family to America, and was called upon to act as mentor and guardian to hundreds of young students sent to the United States by his friends and family in Teheran. His business later involved bringing many large multi-national corporations to Iran, which helped the country's rapid economic development in the 1960's and '70's. He eventually returned to live in Iran in 1976, and was very proud of the improvement in the standard of living that the country experienced since he left. He then left Iran again during its Revolution and thereafter spent his time between London and NYC. He was a founder of the Iranian Jewish Center in London and a prominent figure in the Iranian Jewish community around the world. He was known to go to extraordinary lengths to help those in need and this won him a special place in the hearts of many. His inherited love of Persian poetry propelled him through life at difficult times, and gave him a fount of wisdom he shared with us all. He lived a full and eventful life. He did much good in his life. He will be deeply and forever missed by his family and friends. He is survived by his daughter Monica, his son Victor, six grandchildren, three sisters and his brother, who all loved him greatly. His funeral will be Tuesday morning at 9 AM, at the Riverside Chapel in Great Neck, and there will be a commemorative ceremony at 4 PM, on Sunday, January 4, at the Park East Synagogue in NYC.",1997-12-29T05:00:00+0000
