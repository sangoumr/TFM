Today it means a certain mysterious drawing-power common to hack politicians, Hollywood bombshells and leaders of cults. But according to Philip Rieff, the University of Pennsylvania sociologist who died last year, the term has such a variety of applications only because Weber revised as well as revived it. Rieff is best known as a sympathetic critic of Freuds work and a not-so-sympathetic historian of its cultural importance. His bleak and influential book, The Triumph of the Therapeutic (1966), described modern mans search, vain in most cases, for creeds to replace the ones that psychoanalysis undermines. Charisma, his dense and difficult new book, performs a similar task, with sociology rather than psychoanalysis as its backdrop.

It was in Barcelona in the 1890s that Picasso found the artistic vanguard that propelled him to Paris and world renown. And this is where Gaud spun Art Nouveau into his own quirky architectural idiom. Today the term avant-garde still applies: to Barcelona's fusion cuisine, design-accented boutique hotels, fun-loving fashion houses and even a delicious assortment of innovative chocolatiers, all of whom cut their teeth in the Catalan capital before taking on the rest of Spain.

us,Leviathan on the Right," Consider the following policy proposals that have been floating around Washington in the months leading up to the 2006 election: (a) creating a new cabinet-level federal Department of Families; (b) giving every child $2,000 at birth; (c) having the federal government fund 70,000 new math and science teachers; and (d) requiring every American to purchase health insurance. One might expect that those proposals were made by liberal Democrats, perhaps Ted Kennedy or Hillary Clinton preparing for their Senate majority. In fact, every one of them was made by conservative Republicans. ",2007-03-04T08:08:00+0000

us,Charisma," Is it not likely that since all action is now decided from the outside in that a spray-on charisma can will soon be invented? We shall have the recognition factors sorted out, and so by purchase smartly in the economy size, spray ourselves into something extraordinary. This is simply to say what Soren Kierkegaard said more than a century ago, that all inwardness is lost. In this book, I have tried to work through, critically, toward an understanding of how my inwardness was lost for me, and to recognize those chiefly responsible for the loss-our charismatics. The writing has not been therapeutic; on the contrary, that is the point. From the extraordinary way in which Max Weber, among others, canned charisma for us, I have learned that I am opposed to all therapies. The therapeutic is that terrible beast who has been slouching toward Bethlehem. The pity of our lives is that there are no charismatics to save us from him. We can hope for the spray-on charisma can, which will realize the ancient dream of making even the least of us extraordinarily attractive on the outside. The world is fuller than ever before of people who look like charismatics and try to act the part; like the early medieval sect of Waldenses, they insist on wearing sandals, some even in winter. If not to be like the founder, which was the original reason for wearing sandals, then to be recognizable, a little extraordinary, in lieu of the spray-on charisma can. I doubt that the Western world has ever been so full of innovators all hawking their changes, or so full of deviants, all asserting their rights. Where are the charismatics? The question is, more precisely, who are the charismatics? Who deviates decisively from the beaten path? Who opens a new road, a different way of life and revelation for men to go, even remain, for such openers of new roads are all but lost. Is he a guru, like Timothy Leary, for the guru, in its original meaning, meant, I understand, heavy, weighty, venerable. A modern guru, a figure like Timothy Leary or Norman O. Brown, carries the reverse meaning. He is deliberately weightless and preaches weightlessness to us. The modern guru represents the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent. It is in this sense that he is an exemplar, someone to follow. ",2007-03-04T08:08:00+0000
us,In the Country of Men," I am recalling now that last summer before I was sent away. It was 1979, and the sun was everywhere. Tripoli lay brilliant and still beneath it. Every person, animal and ant went in desperate search for shade, those occasional gray patches of mercy carved into the white of everything. But true mercy only arrived at night, a breeze chilled by the vacant desert, moistened by the humming sea, a reluctant guest silently passing through the empty streets, vague about how far it was allowed to roam in this realm of the absolute star. And it was rising now, this star, as faithful as ever, chasing away the blessed breeze. It was almost morning. ",2007-03-04T08:08:00+0000

A spontaneous position, he thinks, you can find it only when you're not trying. One fine day you sit down and there you are, you're hunched in the poorhouse position. He feels at ease in this position; I feel at ease in it, he thinks, because I'm young and there's no onus on me to stay like this. In normal times Adam Haberberg soon bounces back, but these are not normal times for him, a man who's paid six euros to walk a few yards parallel with the Quai Saint-Bernard, then come back again and collapse onto the very first bench, opposite the ostriches in what is undoubtedly the ugliest and least attractive part of the garden.

It will mark the first time the so-called super-jumbo airliner has been flown overseas with a full passenger load and meal service. Most of the passengers will be Airbus and Lufthansa employees, though some reporters and photographers will also be aboard. Lufthansa has ordered 15 A380s and expects its first delivery in summer 2009. Meanwhile, another Airbus A380  this one without passengers and operated by a crew from the Australian airline Qantas  is expected to arrive on the same day and at about the same time at Los Angeles International Airport, according to a joint statement by Airbus, the airport, the Los Angeles mayors office and Qantas. That flight will depart from Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, where the A380 program has had unexpected manufacturing delays. Los Angeles International has long lagged in making the extensive renovations to terminal gates and taxiways to accommodate the double-decker airliner, and is still some time away from doing so. The A380 will park on a ramp at Los Angeles for publicity and ground-based tests. Airbus and some airlines with A380 orders have criticized Los Angeles International for falling behind on the renovations.

us,Back Door Opens for V.C.U.,"After Virginia Commonwealths 65-59 victory against George Mason in Monday nights Colonial Athletic Association final, a few Rams bounded around the court wearing huge chain-link gold-colored necklaces. They were not trying to bring back the 80s. Rather, each link signified a team member.Its one of those all-for-one, one-for-all deals, and it was started by the teams first-year coach, Anthony Grant. The Rams bring those chains to practices and games, and will undoubtedly pack a few for next weeks N.C.A.A. tournament.The sophomore point guard Eric Maynor was not wearing one of the necklaces, but he was carrying the trophy as the tournament M.V.P. Maynor scored 9 points over the final 1 minute 55 seconds to help the Rams overcome a 5-point deficit. But his biggest contribution may have been a late rebound.The Rams led, 59-57, with 30 seconds left, and George Mason had the ball after a timeout. During the timeout, V.C.U.s director of basketball operations, Brett Nelson, who was a guard on Floridas 2000 Final Four team, pulled the 6-foot-2 Maynor aside.He told me the rebound was mine, Maynor said. He knew they were going to miss and it was coming to me.Sure enough, George Masons Dre Smith erred on a 3-pointer, Maynor cuffed the rebound and was fouled.This game was a sellout, but since many of those tickets went to teams that had been eliminated from the tournament, there were a lot of empty seats during the first half. Strangely, by halftime the place was filled with V.C.U fans. (Their campus is a few blocks from Richmond Coliseum). It was as if someone opened a back door and they all streamed in. Regardless, it was a great atmosphere. One fan was dressed in a chicken suit and another came as a banana.A colleague of mine asked the banana boy to explain his duds.

This weekend at Anthology Film Archives, it will gain another kind of music: a live score performed, under the name the Valerie Project, by an ensemble of Philadelphia folkies that includes Greg Weeks, Brooke Sietinsons and Helena Espvall of the band Espers. The new soundtrack will replace one of the films better features, its score by Lubos Fiser and Jan Klusak; the band members have said that their challenge is to equal that original music, with which we all have fallen madly in love. The film that will be screening behind them (directed in 1970 by Jaromil Jires and starring the alarmingly sexy Jaroslava Schallerova, then 14) is a true period piece, a nudie fairy-tale head trip about a girl hitting puberty and having to deal with lecherous priests and her nubile vampire grandmother  an Aquarian stew of Freud, Murnau, Hefner and the Brothers Grimm.

Actually, Young, a 14-year major league veteran, retired and is working for ESPN. He put a media credential around his neck and started doing interviews. I moved over to the other side, Young said with a smile. I spoke to Young about his new career, his old career and, before long, the topic shifted to Rutgers. Young played baseball and football at Rutgers and graduated in 1989. I couldnt resist telling Young about my 20-year connection to him. When I began working at The New York Times in 1987, the first story that I wrote was an unbylined piece about Rutgers beating Boston College, 38-24. Young, who grew up in New Brunswick, N.J. was the star of the homecoming game with nine catches. I called him the hometown hero, the kind of originality that Im sure really impressed the editors. Youve got to get me a copy of that, Young said. I promised to e-mail it to Young. About an hour later, I saw Young in the press box so I dug into the archives and found the story. He leaned over my right shoulder to read about what he had accomplished that day. Man, that brings back some great memories for me, Young said. Me, too. ",2007-03-10T18:58:50+0000

He said Georgetown probably deserves a look for No. 1, at least over Kansas, but probably wont get one.Palms last four in the tournament: Purdue, Syracuse, Missouri State and Illinois. His last four out: Air Force, Florida State, Kansas State and Texas Tech. Palm said that there would be a lot of intrigue at the bottom of the bracket. I could end missing a half-dozen, he said. Well, more like three. I had three wrong last year. Theres a lot of tough calls.Bubble teams will be cheering for North Carolina against North Carolina State and Florida against Arkansas.

If the restrictions are eased, children from both the United States and Canada  15 and younger  will be able to cross the land borders between the United States and Canada with certified copies of their birth certificates and parental supervision. Those 16 to 18 years old traveling with public or private school groups, religious groups, social or cultural organizations or sports teams will also be able to use certified birth certificates instead of passports, as long as they are supervised by adults. ...

Judt, a historian who was raised and educated in Britain but has been living in America for the past 20 years (he directs the Remarque Institute at New York University), is no stranger to controversy. Last October, he was in the news when a speech he was scheduled to give on the Israel lobby was abruptly canceled by the Polish Consulate in New York, reportedly under pressure from Jewish organizations incensed by Judts strong criticism of Israel. More than 100 scholars and journalists defended Judt in a letter published in The New York Review of Books, while others accused him of spreading the toxins of anti-Semitism. I remain saddened by the Polish Consulate affair, Judt (who is Jewish) wrote in a recent e-mail message; but, he added, the controversy helped foster a more open and public conversation about Israel, the Israel lobby, anti-Semitism (real and imagined) and Jewish stances vis--vis all these.

In The Fall, a Godardian stew of art and politics in America, Whitehead documented the 1968 student protests at Columbia University; the kaleidoscopic Tonite Lets All Make Love in London (1967) immortalized the swinging London scene, including players like David Hockney, Julie Christie and Michael Caine. More handsome than most of his pop-star subjects, the Cambridge-educated Whitehead squired plenty of groovy glamazons: Nico, Nathalie Delon, Niki de Saint Phalle and Dido Goldsmith. By the end of the decade, however, he had dropped out of the scene to raise falcons and later went on to write esoteric novels. Now that his films are once again on the festival circuit, perhaps its time for a proper bow.",2007-03-11T05:00:00+0000

I got by as a fashion-design student with a little familial support and a meager part-time job in a vintage boutique called Heartbreaker.

us,A Return Engagement: Get Shorty,"There was a time when schoolboys could hardly wait to trade in their little jackets and knee pants for a real suit with trousers, just like Dads. But if designers have their way, grown men could be revisiting their preteens. Thom Brownes shrunken tailoring probably sparked the revival; last year he even showed gray flannel shorts suits for ice-skating. Now others have zeroed in, albeit in more relaxed ways: Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren, Louis Vuitton and Dsquared are teaming shorts with casual jackets and sandals or loafers. It was British soldiers in 19th-century India who first bared their legs by cutting off their pants; soon after, shorts were standard issue for British uniforms in tropical climates. Wealthy Americans in Bermuda became familiar with the look, and by the mid-1930s, stylish men of means wore navy sports jackets with white tennis shorts off court and double-breasted blazers with gray flannel shorts for sailing or drinks at the yacht club.After World War II, things became more democratic. Casual summer shorts popped up on campuses (often worn with jackets), and returning veterans embraced them as the perfect uniform for mowing the lawn. A few brave retailers even tried to sell businessmans special three-piece shorts suits, but, thanks in part to air-conditioning, the idea mercifully never caught on. By the 60s, stodgy shorts had given way to hip cutoff jeans. In our own era of stylistic appropriation, anyof these versions just might work, handled properly. For creative types, tailored Bermudas and an unlined jacket in summer seem the height of style. One conceit wed rather not endorse: the preppy custom of exchanging vows at a garden wedding, in jacket, bow tie, shorts and knee socks.

The N.H.L. vice president Colin Campbell announced the suspension a day after a disciplinary hearing was held in New York on Saturday. ""The National Hockey League will not accept the use of a stick in the manner and fashion in which Mr. Simon used his Thursday night,"" Campbell said in a statement. ""As a consequence of his actions, Mr. Simon has forfeited the privilege of playing in an N.H.L. game again this season, regardless of how many games the Islanders ultimately play."" Simon issued a statement Saturday expressing regret over the incident and apologizing to Hollweg. The Islanders said Simon was recovering from a concussion suffered in Thursday's game and would not be available for further comment. The Islanders, currently holding the seventh playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, will play without one of their stalwarts. Simon, 35, is a 14-year veteran with abundant playoff experience  he won a Stanley Cup with Colorado in 1996 and has reached the finals with two other teams  and is regarded as one of the league's toughest players. ""Chris Simon has played a major role in our success this season and we will miss his presence in our lineup,"" the Islanders' general manager, Garth Snow, said in a statement. ""His regret is clearly evident in the statement he released last night. Our entire organization supports Chris every step of the way."" Simon's punishment takes him out of any playoff games this season, and if the Islanders play less than 10 games in the playoffs, the suspension will stretch into next season and last for at least 25 total games. The hit happened Thursday night, late in the third period of a tie game against the Rangers. Hollweg checked Simon hard into the boards and after Simon got up, he charged after Hollweg and, with two hands on his stick, slammed it into Hollweg's chin. The hit narrowly missed Hollweg's neck, which could have been a much more serious injury, and Hollweg suffered only a gash on his chin. He returned to the game and played in the Rangers' game on Saturday as well. The Rangers will play the Islanders two more times this season. ""Whether it's appropriate or not isn't for me to judge,"" Rangers Coach Tom Renney said of the punishment. ""The two things for me that are most important is that Ryan is O.K., he's able to play. And Chris, for me anyway, is a good man. He's had to pay the price and that's appropriate. It needs to be a message that's loud and clear, of course. We all have to move forward and learn what we can from it."" Simon's suspension is two games longer than the one given to Marty McSorley in 2000 when he smashed his stick over the head of Donald Brashear in a game in Vancouver. McSorley was also subsequently charged with assault by the Vancouver police and was convicted, although he served no jail time. The Nassau County district attorney's office said Friday that an assault charge was being considered against Simon. A decision is expected later this week. ",2007-03-11T07:00:00+0000

us,"Briefly Talking Baseball, Only Baseball, With Gary Matthews Jr.","Gary Matthews Jr. of the Los Angeles Angels is not talking about why reports have linked him to a nationwide drug distribution ring. He has dodged questions for almost two weeks, which has infuriated Arte Moreno, the club owner.Still, as Matthews prepared for a game on Saturday, I wanted at least to attempt to interview him. Im big on studying body language so, when Matthews looked about as approachable as he was going to get, I introduced myself and asked him if he could answer some baseball questions.Baseball questions only? Matthews said.I repeated my request. I figured that Matthews might relax if he talked about baseball issues and might reveal a little about how he is feeling during an obviously tense time. Matthews told me he would speak after he took batting practice.About 20 minutes later, Matthews returned to his locker, but, his stance had changed. Matthews said he did not have time for an interview and said wed have to do it another time. I asked him if he could do it later in the day, but he declined. Sensing that this pursuit of an interview was almost lost, I asked him to simply answer a couple of baseball questions. He agreed.Matthews on why he wanted to sign with the Angels (aside from the five-year, $50 million contract): First and foremost, it was to win. This is a team I was really familiar with the last few years. It was a team that really gave us some problems in Texas. It was a team you had respect for because they always found a way to win. Everybody talks about this team needs to score runs. We scored all the runs in the world in Texas and still ended up in the same place in October. It was the opportunity to win, their young pitching and their fan base. Those were all really attractive to me.Matthews on how he can make the Angels even better: Just doing what I do. They felt that they needed some defense up the middle. Obviously, for me to come in and play center field the way Im capable of playing, was something that I was looking fwd to doing, something that I bring to the table. And just bring a balanced game.Then Matthews, who had a career year with a .313 average, 19 homers and 79 runs batted in with the Texas Rangers last season, showed a cocky side.Obviously, I standout defensively, but I still pride myself on being able to do everything well, Matthews said. There are going to be guys faster than me. There are going to be guys who have more power, but there are not a whole lot of guys who do everything. Thats what I try and do.I told Matthews that Buck Showalter, his former manager with the Rangers, thought Matthews should have won a Gold Glove Award last season. Matthews said he learned a lot about himself while playing in Texas. With this brief interview getting close to being over, I asked Matthews what I felt was a semi-baseball question. Was he able to fully concentrate on baseball this spring?That is not a baseball question, Matthews said.That, we both agreed, was the end of the interview.",2007-03-11T18:36:17+0000

It is the first clause of the First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. At this point I am tempted to begin a sentence with that is and follow it with a gloss on the clause. But just what these apparently simple words mean has been debated by the courts with increasing vociferousness and little resolution since Everson v. Board of Education, often referred to as the first modern establishment clause case, was decided in February of 1947.The issue in Everson was whether the use of public funds to transport students to and from parochial schools was an establishment of religion because religions interests would be advanced by the expenditure of state monies. Now, 60 years later on March 6th, the Supreme Court of California has considered and ruled on the issue of whether a municipal agency (the California Statewide Communities Development Authority), may provide tax-exempt bonds to avowedly sectarian schools for the purpose of constructing cafeterias, athletic facilities and other campus buildings. The facts are different  in 2007 it is buildings rather than buses that pose the problem  but the basic question is the same: When can it be said that a government action amounts to an establishing of religion?",2007-03-12T01:13:43+0000

In the broad sweep of history, four years is a nanosecond, but in America, where memories are congenitally short, its an eternity. Thats why a revisionist history of the White Houses rush to war, much of it written by its initial cheerleaders, has already taken hold. In this exonerating fictionalization of the story, nearly every politician and pundit in Washington was duped by the same bad intelligence before the war, and few imagined that the administration would so botch the invasions aftermath or that the occupation would go on so long. If only I had known then what I know now ... has been the persistent refrain of the war supporters who subsequently disowned the fiasco. But the embarrassing reality is that much of the damning truth about the administrations case for war and its hubristic expectations for a cakewalk were publicly available before the war, hiding in plain sight, to be seen by anyone who wanted to look.

We loved free bagels in the morning. They happened all too infrequently. Our benefits were astonishing in comprehensiveness and quality of care. Sometimes we questioned whether they were worth it. We thought moving to India might be better, or going back to nursing school. Doing something with the handicapped or working with our hands.

Dillon shared his table with a person so odd-looking that the other diners in the restaurant ogled and whispered to one another. He - or was it a she? - wore a blazer and trousers, cropped hair, and tie, but seemed to be hiding breasts under the suit jacket. In fact, Roberta Cowell had been born male, but she could not live as a man anymore. She had begun dosing herself on massive amounts of estrogen - enough to melt away her muscles and put a blush in her cheeks. With no idea how to push her transformation further, Cowell was stuck in a no man's land between the sexes - a terrible place to find yourself in 1950. ",2007-03-18T14:39:00+0000

There were several white physicians in Cotton Plant, a relatively prosperous Mississippi Delta town about sixty-five miles west of Memphis, but no black woman would have bothered to call on them. The closest hospital was in Little Rock, more than seventy miles to the southwest, but even with the railroad, that was out of the question too. So Rosa, or Rosie Etta, or Rosabell-for she had many names before she became internationally known as Sister Rosetta Tharpe-was born on the grounds of the Tilman Cooperwood farm, where Katie Harper lived and worked. A midwife from the community was likely there to comfort and guide Katie when she gave birth to her first and only child at the relatively advanced age of thirty-two. The date of the birth was March 20, although no official certificate was issued; in those days, the only records country women like Katie kept were notes jotted down in family Bibles.

us,The Religion Clause Divided Against Itself,"My last column told the story of the diminishing scope of the establishment clause of the Constitution. Once understood as prohibiting state actions that endorse, benefit or advance religion, the clause has in recent decades been re-read in ways that permit, among other things, taxpayer financing of evangelical student newspapers and the construction of buildings at sectarian (mostly Christian) schools. This result has been accomplished by shifting the inquiry from the traditional establishment clause question  does this amount to government funding of religious activities?  to a free expression clause question  would denying the religious institution this benefit or subsidy be an unfair instance of viewpoint discrimination? By substituting the requirement of fairness for an investigation of a laws effects, the courts have moved dramatically away from James Madisons insistence that not even three pence of public funds should be spent for religious purposes and have rendered the establishment clause nugatory.Some of those who commented on the column attributed the pattern I described to the nefarious forces of organized religion or to the machinations of the Bush administration (always the default villain for Times readers), but a deeper explanation might be found in a religion-clause jurisprudence so fissured that one might even call it schizophrenic. The division is between two views of the assumptions that should be kept in mind when an establishment clause case or a free exercise case is being adjudicated. One view stresses history and cultural traditions; the other embraces the iron logic of principle.",2007-03-19T00:06:32+0000

us,The Global Deterioration Scale for Assessment of Primary Degenerative Dementia,"Stage 1: No cognitive impairment Unimpaired individuals experience no memory problems and none are evident to a health care professional during a medical interview. Stage 2: Very mild cognitive decline Individuals at this stage feel as if they have memory lapses, especially in forgetting familiar words or names or the location of keys, eyeglasses or other everyday objects. But these problems are not evident during a medical examination or apparent to friends, family or co-workers. Stage 3: Mild cognitive decline Friends, family or co-workers begin to notice deficiencies. Problems with memory or concentration may be measurable in clinical testing or discernible during a detailed medical interview. Common difficulties include:  Word- or name-finding problems noticeable to family or close associates  Decreased ability to remember names when introduced to new people  Performance issues in social or work settings noticeable to family, friends or co-workers  Reading a passage and retaining little material  Losing or misplacing a valuable object  Decline in ability to plan or organize Stage 4: Moderate cognitive decline At this stage, a careful medical interview detects clear-cut deficiencies in the following areas:  Decreased knowledge of recent occasions or current events  Impaired ability to perform challenging mental arithmetic-for example, to count backward from 100 by 7s  Decreased capacity to perform complex tasks, such as marketing, planning dinner for guests or paying bills and managing finances  Reduced memory of personal history  The affected individual may seem subdued and withdrawn, especially in socially or mentally challenging situations Stage 5: Moderately severe cognitive decline Major gaps in memory and deficits in cognitive function emerge. Some assistance with day-to-day activities becomes essential. At this stage, individuals may:  Be unable during a medical interview to recall such important details as their current address, their telephone number or the name of the college or high school from which they graduated  Become confused about where they are or about the date, day of the week, or season  Have trouble with less challenging mental arithmetic; for example, counting backward from 40 by 4s or from 20 by 2s  Need help choosing proper clothing for the season or the occasion  Usually retain substantial knowledge about themselves and know their own name and the names of their spouse or children  Usually require no assistance with eating or using the toilet Stage 6: Severe cognitive decline Memory difficulties continue to worsen, significant personality changes may emerge and affected individuals need extensive help with customary daily activities. At this stage, individuals may:  Lose most awareness of recent experiences and events as well as of their surroundings  Recollect their personal history imperfectly, although they generally recall their own name  Occasionally forget the name of their spouse or primary caregiver but generally can distinguish familiar from unfamiliar faces  Need help getting dressed properly; without supervision, may make such errors as putting pajamas over daytime clothes or shoes on wrong feet  Experience disruption of their normal sleep/waking cycle  Need help with handling details of toileting (flushing toilet, wiping and disposing of tissue properly)  Have increasing episodes of urinary or fecal incontinence  Experience significant personality changes and behavioral symptoms, including suspiciousness and delusions (for example, believing that their caregiver is an impostor); hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not really there); or compulsive, repetitive behaviors such as hand-wringing or tissue shredding  Tend to wander and become lost Stage 7: Very severe cognitive decline This is the final stage of the disease when individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, the ability to speak and, ultimately, the ability to control movement.  Frequently individuals lose their capacity for recognizable speech, although words or phrases may occasionally be uttered  Individuals need help with eating and toileting and there is general incontinence of urine  Individuals lose the ability to walk without assistance, then the ability to sit without support, the ability to smile, and the ability to hold their head up.

us,Greek Revival,"The year 1950 was a grim one for Greece, as the countrys economy was reeling from the double blows of world war and civil strife. The government, though, was farsighted enough to recognize one opportunity: tourism. It built and ran a chain of hotels, called xenias, on some of the most picturesque sites in the country. Fast-forward half a century, and most of the 36 xenias  each masterminded by a Greek architect and built in a clean, Modernist style  had become run-down or even abandoned. Enter the architectural preservationist Pantelis Nikolakopoulos, who began a campaign to persuade the government to recognize the xenias cultural importance and renovate the best examples. Today his plan is bearing fruit, and two are running as swanky, retro-style hotels: the Mykonos Theoxenia (above, shown pre-renovation; 011-30-22890-22230; www.mykonostheoxenia.com; doubles from about $182), just behind the windmills on the jet-set islands harbor, and the xenia in the waterfront city of Volos (011-30-24210-92700; doubles from $185). Four more prime xenias (in Vytina, Skiathos, Thassos and Tsagarada) have been put up for sale, though firm takers have yet to emerge. Andre Balazs, are you listening?",2007-03-25T04:00:00+0000

Angelo was walking home from the laboratory when, all of a sudden, he heard two voices in his head. It was like hearing thoughts in my mind that were not mine, he explained recently. They identified themselves as Andrew and Oliver, two angels. In my minds eye, I could see an image of a bald, middle-aged man dressed in white against a white background. This, I was told, was Oliver. What the angels said, to Angelos horror, was that in the coming days, he would die of a brain hemorrhage. Terrified, Angelo hurried home and locked himself into his apartment. For three long days he waited out his fate, at which time his supervisor drove him to a local hospital, where Angelo was admitted to the psychiatric ward. It was his first time under psychiatric care. He had never heard voices before. His diagnosis was schizophrenia with depressive overtones.",2007-03-25T04:00:00+0000

His growing archive of video conversations with artists and writers, taped in his London library and gathered at his Web site (clivejames.com), constitutes a virtual Whos Who of British cultural life. With Cultural Amnesia, his 25th book, just published, James throws a kind of ideal cocktail party of the mind, bringing together idiosyncratic portraits of 100-odd cultural and political figures ranging from the celebrated (Anna Akhmatova, Charles de Gaulle, Dick Cavett) to the semi-obscure (Karl Tschuppik? Virginio Rognoni?). On this weeks cover, he takes the measure of the filmmaker and Nazi darling Leni Riefenstahl, the subject of two new biographies. Riefenstahls defenders have tried to present her as a feminist pioneer and auteurist standard bearer. But James will have none of it. Riefenstahl is the classic instance of the 20th-century artist hiding from reality behind her art, he said via e-mail. She was unique in her capacity to take a commanding place in a mans world, but she was anything but unique in her capacity for deception. You have to be sentimental, however, to call it self-deception. She wasnt a dreamer; she was a liar. ",2007-03-25T04:00:00+0000

us,The European Economy Since 1945," In the second half of the twentieth century, the lives of Europeans were transformed almost beyond recognition. In 1950, many of the continent's residents heated their homes with coal, cooled their food with ice, and lacked even rudimentary forms of indoor plumbing. Today, their lives are eased and enriched by natural-gas furnaces, electric refrigerators, and an array of electronic gadgets that boggles the mind. Gross domestic product per capita, what the income of a typical resident of Europe will buy, tripled in the second half of the twentieth century. The quality of life improved even more than suggested by this simple measure. Hours worked declined by one-third, providing an enormous increase in leisure time. Life expectancy lengthened as a result of improved nutrition and advances in medical science. To be sure, not all was sweetness and light. Unemployment rose. Tax burdens soared. Environmental degradation, political repression, and limits on consumer sovereignty were pervasive under the authoritarian regimes that dominated Eastern Europe for four decades after World War II. But by any objective standard, the last half century has left Europeans today enormously better off than their grandparents were fifty years ago. ",2007-03-25T07:32:00+0000

us,Leni Riefenstahl," When King Wilhelm I of Prussia was proclaimed German kaiser in 1871, Berlin became a center of political power. With its three million inhabitants, the metropolis on the Spree became an economic, civic, and, in particular, social and cultural hub. At the turn of the century, Berlin possessed an expressly international flair, even if restrictive Wilhelmian policies repeatedly checked modern developments and avant-garde movements. But this had little effect on the fascination that the city held. Visitors, both German and foreign, strolled along the elegant Unter den Linden, past spectacularly ostentatious architecture and tributes in stone to the Hohenzollern rulers. They visited the well-stocked department stores, the opulent opera houses, the magnificent revue palaces, and Max Reinhardt's celebrated theaters, sampling the various worlds that Berlin nurtured in the Grnderjahre, the years of expansion in the early 1870s when it basked in the light of its newfound importance.

It was a comfortable spot; when the mainland sweltered, Iririki usually got sea breezes and cooling showers. Once it had contained just two houses: our mission bungalow and-set in parklike grounds with a flagpole flying a bedspread-sized Union Jack-the palatial residence of the British Resident Commissioner.

It can't be weighed on a scale, sniffed out like a truffle or a smuggled bundle of cocaine, retrieved from the lost-and-found, or photographed for posterity. Like justice or mercy, we can only determine that it exists at all because of the presence of its effects-or its side effects. Unlike many of our habits and practices, virginity reflects no known biological imperative and grants no demonstrable evolutionary advantage, nor has being able to recognize it in others been shown to increase anyone's chances of reproduction or survival. Perhaps this is why even our nearest animal relatives, whose sexual behavior and social structures are often startlingly similar to our own in other respects, show no signs at all of knowing what virginity is.

Jason is drawn to the exotic and otherworldly; he submits poems to the parish newsletter under the pseudonym Eliot Bolivar and retreats to the woods beside Black Swan Green, where Gypsies camp in the quarry and an old woman lives in an isolated, fairy-tale house. At the same time he has to contend with his severe stammer, schoolyard bullies and the simmering tension between his parents. In Jason, Mitchell creates an evocative yet authentically adolescent voice, Nell Freudenberger wrote here. ",2007-03-25T09:00:00+0000

His hands, gripping the steering wheel, were large and knotty. His size had intimidated me as a boy; now as then, his dramatic voice was overshadowed by his yet bigger ideas about almost everything.

Random House was awarded the costs of the appeal, estimated at $589,000, and Mr. Baigent and Mr. Leigh face a legal bill of $5.89 million.",2007-03-29T09:34:00+0000
