Aleksandr Lebed, take just one moment to savor this moment. For the first time in history an independent Russian people -- not the oligarchs, not the bankers, not the mafia -- has chosen a president in a free and fair election. Despite all the hardships and uncertainties that have characterized life here since the collapse of the Soviet Union, an overwhelming majority of Russians actually voted for the candidate who promised to continue the wrenching transition to an open society with a free market. That is a big deal. It is a remarkable triumph of hope over hardship. While this single election doesn't guarantee that Russia will make it all the way to American-style free-market democracy, it does guarantee that the effort will move forward now with a solid popular mandate.

us,Books in Brief: FICTION;A Sardonic Eye,"In a hefty and companionable volume, entitled simply COLLECTED STORIES (Sun and Moon, $24.95), Djuna Barnes's biographer Phillip Herring has gathered 43 of her stories, written from 1914 to 1942. Perhaps best known for her 1936 novel, ""Nightwood,"" Barnes displays in her shorter work an unflagging taste for the grotesque: In ""The Head of Babylon,"" a Polish-American farmer marries off his quadriplegic daughter, who sits on a great dais between two candles and suddenly declaims a strange, biblical speech as she leaves with the groom. In ""No-Man's-Mare,"" a captured wild horse, bearing a dead woman to the undertaker, veers from a path and disappears into the sea. Although Barnes experiments with narrative, her stories generally depend on a plot ending with an O. Henry twist, a format suited no doubt to the newspapers and magazines for which she often wrote. Her characters are not round, nor do they sustain and engage us with their conflicts. Rather, they are haunting emblems of human weakness, vice and, occasionally, virtue. Most striking is Barnes's particular use of language, which aligns her with Pound, Joyce and Stein: syntactical inversions, epigrams, puns, cliches and one-liners crowd her sentences. Witty and passionate, her stories are often reflexive, with asides to the reader and a sardonic tone that mocks the characters. And always they reflect Barnes's bleak view of existence.

(Now up to 273 outlets nationwide; 500 promised soon; world domination vowed before century's end.) Founder of the Cheaper! grocery-store chain, Roscoe is famed as a maverick price slasher and no-prisoners libertarian. Along with cheap (sorry, cheaper) cigarettes and related flotsam -- including Marlboro 15-speed bikes -- the stores feature shopping bags printed with Roscoe's testy political screeds. (This month Simon & Schuster will publish a collection, ""Bagatorials."") Oddly, the chain's employees aren't quite so liberty-enriched: hopefuls are treated to a drug test and prying questions like ""What weapons do you own?""

Then I read ""A Pillow and a Rock,"" by Christine Bell. This short story -- from ""The Seven-Year Atomic Make-Over Guide,"" Ms. Bell's first collection -- begins with the premise that the notorious Jesse didn't really die at birth, but rather was kidnapped by the Presleys' midwife. And while that may sound like the starting point for a campy ride through Las Vegas, Hollywood and the hidden soundproof basement at Graceland, Ms. Bell (the author of the novels ""Saint"" and ""The Perez Family"") has a very different journey in mind. Shunning the easy absurdity that seems to attach itself to all things Elvis, she takes us into the unglamorous life of Hanna Worth, a poor backwoods midwife who finds herself saddled with an unwanted baby and a profound moral choice. The resulting story, reminiscent more of Jayne Anne Phillips than of Mark Leyner, is unexpectedly -- even improbably -- consequential.",1996-07-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Nazism as Theater,"The Nazi era was captured largely in black-and-white photographs. The primary visual records of Hitler, Nazi Party rallies, book burnings, ghetto roundups, even the Nuremberg trials, are colorless. Leni Riefenstahl used black and white to glorify her subjects in ""Triumph of the Will."" Fifty years later Steven Spielberg shot ""Schindler's List"" in monochrome to echo the collective memory. But in 1939 an amateur film club shot color movies of the theatrical parades and pageants leading to the opening of the House of German Art, which Hitler built as a monument to Volk culture. This extraordinarily well-preserved, candid record of Nazi pomp, circumstance and banality was released a few years back by the BBC as a documentary with the title ""Good Morning, Mr. Hitler!"" WEEKEND IN MUNICH: Art, Propaganda and Terror in the Third Reich (Pavilion/Trafalgar Square, $40), by Robert S. Wistrich, a professor of modern European history at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, is a selection of stills from this amateur film, sandwiched between a history of Nazi propaganda that was not part of the BBC program and comments by spectators at the festival. The book is disquieting in the way these color photographs do, in fact, reduce Nazi villains to everyday people. Color somehow defangs even the most heinous of the bunch, like Heinrich Himmler and Julius Streicher. Yet the most disturbing image of all is not in color; it is a black-and-white snapshot of two pageant participants drinking Coke in front of a German Coca-Cola sign.

The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32 , to 879/32 . The bond's yield fell to 7.03 percent from 7.05 percent on Thursday. [44.]",1996-07-13T05:00:00+0000

us,MUNICIPAL BATTLEGROUND;Coney Island's Worn Welcome Mat,"STRIP away the age-old air conditioner known as the Atlantic Ocean, the concession stands offering buttery cobs of corn and sleek hot dogs, the iridescent Wonder Wheel and the riders screaming as the chattering Cyclone drops. Remove the old-timers playing handball, the sunbathers on white bed sheets and the promise of prizes inside the arcades. What's left is a graying boardwalk, a welcome mat made of wood. The Coney Island boardwalk has a storied history. It has connected visitors to the rides and the green-water ocean since 1923. For generations, it has been a seaside front porch for millions of bathers, players, strollers and lovers. At 80 feet wide and more than two and a half miles long, it stretches from the populace of Russian immigrants in Brighton Beach to the private community of two-story homes in Sea Gate. But beyond the romantic vision of the boardwalk lies a piece of infrastructure that demands as much maintenance as any city sidewalk or roadway. Its version of potholes: cracked and loose boards, shifting pilings and gaps caused by fires. And its version of missing parking signs is missing bars from its beach-side aluminum railing, stolen by scavengers of scrap metal. ""For us to keep it mint condition, we'd have to take care of it all of the time,"" said Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern, whose department maintains the boardwalk. ""What money we get to repair and take care of the boardwalk, we use."" While city officials say weather, age and vandalism are the greatest threats to the grandeur of the boardwalk, people in the neighborhood often say the city's indifference. ""The city isn't doing anything for Coney Island,"" said Gregory Bitetzakis, 60, who has been selling shish kebabs there since 1948. ""It seems they want to do away with it."" During a recent visit to the boardwalk, Martin Levine, chairman of Community Board 13, said the Coney Island peninsula was treated as second-rate, noting that it took until July 4 for the Parks Department to open all of the area's beaches this year because of a shortage of lifeguards, while most city beaches opened Memorial Day weekend. Parks Department officials dismiss the charge, citing a recent allocation of $180,000 for repairs to the boardwalk and $20 million from the Borough President's office over the last 15 years to maintain and improve the wooden esplanade. The department says it does not keep track of how much it spends on routine maintenance of the boardwalk. Brooklyn has only three year-round Parks Department carpenters to do the kind of skilled maintenance the boardwalk requires almost weekly. There had been eight as recently as 1990, said Parke Spencer, a spokesman. ""This whole boardwalk is a mess,"" said Sam Kravitz, a resident of Bensonhurst, as he strolled by a section of the boardwalk that had not been fixed since a fire destroyed it last fall. ""We used to walk on the boardwalk without shoes. Now, with all the nails popping out, you can't."" Visitors can no longer go under the boardwalk, a traditional place to cool off or find romance. Two winters ago, the beach level was raised to meet the boardwalk to curb crime and discourage the homeless from camping out. But perhaps most frustrating for local leaders is the damage done by city vehicles. After a survey of the boardwalk last year, Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden branded city vehicles as a boardwalk scourge. Like a rash of noshing termites, the vehicles bend the wooden planks and force nails and screws to jut out. A fire truck fell through the boardwalk two years ago. Last week, Mr. Levine said he spotted a Parks Department all-terrain vehicle cruising across the boardwalk. The driver, John J. Natoli, who is the chief engineer for construction, said he was inspecting recent repairs. Still, cars and loose boards were not of much concern to many people on the boardwalk last week. Some defended it as glorious. Others pointed to the sparsely populated beach, tumbling litter and abandoned amusement sites like the charred Thunderbolt as more poignant examples of a languishing Coney Island. ""The beauty of Coney Island is gone,"" said Joe Perez, who grew up and lives in the neighborhood. ""We walk and nobody's here. It's desolate.""",1996-07-14T05:00:00+0000

us,COPING;Ain't Over Till It's Over: An Addict's Fight,"THIS is no success story, at least not yet. ""My mother kicked me, hit me with her hand, a stick,"" said Andres Andino, who is now 43. ""She had five kids, nobody knew about stress, depression then. I think she couldn't stand how much I looked like my father. One day I stopped crying. I wasn't going to let her see my pain. All the anger got stuck inside me. ""I went out on the street and I paid her back -- drugs, armed robbery. I cut guys up. And I look around up here, and I can cry now seeing all the kids who remind me of me."" Mr. Andino, a handsome, muscular man, had just finished mowing the grass of a baseball field on 100th Street between First and Second Avenues that belongs to Harlem RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities), a privately supported program of games and mentors for about 225 local youngsters from 7 to 18. Last summer, mellow on heroin, Mr. Andino looked out of a nearby apartment window and saw Inge Hanson, the group's executive director, struggling to set down the white-powder foul lines. A former ballplayer with more than a dash of macho, he came downstairs to show her how. He soon became a volunteer, then a coach. It was a fellow coach, Mike Colon, who found Mr. Andino when he bottomed out in a stairwell last March. He was bleeding from self-inflicted slashes on his arms. He had swallowed 90 pills, Prozac, Benadryl and Valium. Mr. Colon brought him to Metropolitan Hospital nearby, where he went through yet another detox. Ms. Hanson got him into the rehab program at Holliswood Hospital in Queens. He was there a little more than a month. He's been clean for almost four. ""I consider this the longest ever,"" he said. ""Once I didn't use for six months, but I had reservations -- it was to get through parole. In the upstate prisons it's too hard to get drugs, so I don't count that either. ""I started using marijuana in Franklin K. Lane High School. My mother gave me $7.50 every day. That was my share of my father's Social Security. He got stabbed to death by a girlfriend he was abusing. I'd buy cigarettes, weed, Gypsy Rose wine. I'd gamble on handball games; I was very good, took money off the African kids in Bedford-Stuyvesant. ""We'd bring junior high school girls back to the apartment. My mother was a seamstress in the garment center. I got busted by a neighbor. My mother came home early and there was two couples in her bed. She swept us out of the house with her broom."" Mr. Andino dropped out of high school. He wandered back and forth from his native Puerto Rico. He began using heroin at 18. He had jobs -- five years loading trucks, seven years in the garment center in which he rose to fabric cutter, even some cooking -- but the getting, selling and using of heroin always brought him down. He was arrested 10 times and spent more than 3 1/2 years behind bars. It was often easier to use in city jails than on the street, he said, because your family would always send you money in jail, figuring you couldn't get dope there. On the outside, he went into detox programs to placate his wife, a city employee who supported him and their two children and four more of her own. She looked down on him, he says, as a ""dirty IV user."" She considered her cocaine habit ""sophisticated."" They are separated after 16 years, and she is now in a rehab program, but their two children have been placed in foster care. His goal, he says, is to get them back. He makes a little money from RBI and has begun living with a girlfriend who has some money of her own, in Westchester. * Kids from the neighborhood projects began drifting onto the block, smacking their gloves, making their way under a hot sun to the ballfield. The scent of the fresh-mowed grass tickled nostrils. ""People look at me, they say, 'Andy, you come a long way, you look good,' and that sometimes scares me,"" he said. ""I got to remember where I been, how low and dirty. I remember one time, I was messing around in my marriage; I'm a fool for girls, skinny girls, and this girl gave me a bunch of flowers after a weekend we spent together. ""I went home and gave the roses to my wife. That is dirty. And I used to con the parole officers by turning in my own kids' urine for my tests. That's dirty. ""But that's why these kids here can trust me and talk to me. I know everything you can do bad. When they cry, I feel good; it means the anger's coming out.

us,"THEATER;Julie Harris in 'Sonya,' A Phoenix Production","DURING the first act of ""Sonya,"" the wife of Leo Tolstoy is pointed out as a ""soul in need"" by a doctor and disciple of the literary and philosophical icon. In Act II, a Russian Orthodox priest tells Sonya how he understands her ""cry from the heart."" Such are the playwright Leon Katz's florid elucidations on the overwrought behavior of Countess Sofya Andreyevna Tolstoy, who spends much of her namesake play's three hours making a nuisance of herself, demanding to be let into the cottage where her husband of 48 years lies dying, while hostile forces keep her out. The year is 1910. Since Julie Harris is possessed of the power to communicate an interior life, her enlightened presence gives a playwright the golden gift of time. He can save it. He can cut words. He can redirect priorities. Bluntly put, he can rework his play. As Sonya, Ms. Harris reveals the depth of distress, the ambivalent pull of fierce love and eternal devotion in conflict with ideological discord. In a single moment, the actress sums up her reason for being there: to put the stamp of finality and forgiveness -- the buzzword is closure -- on a troubled, unreconciled life with a sainted man. Their ""totally opposite ideas of the meaning and purpose of existence,"" in the words of a letter Tolstoy wrote to Sonya four months before his death, led to estrangement. Sonya could not forsake the materialism that a spiritually converted Tolstoy renounced, or understand his loyalty to his leading disciple, Vladimir Gregorievich Chertkov, with its intimations of homosexuality and an idealism that eluded her. While the puzzling and fascinating ramifications of an extraordinarily volatile marriage that produced 13 children, 4 of whom -- 2 daughters and 2 sons -- figure among an eye-popping stageful of 15 characters, are unexplored, the ravings of Sonya are overexplained. Neither historically lucid nor dramatically fulfilling, Mr. Katz's play reveals a gaping hole at the center, an unsettling inconclusiveness. That Tolstoy remains unseen in a many-peopled play is an interesting challenge Mr. Katz has created, but he has failed to give a revered man a rich offstage life. Yet no playwright could reasonably expect, in three weeks' playing time, a more solid ensemble or a more bountiful production than the Phoenix Theater Company has lavished on ""Sonya."" It all starts with the audience's gasp at the sight of Campbell Baird's imposing setting, a whopping train that revolves in an obscure railroad station, Astapovo. That happened to be the title of the first professional version of Mr. Katz's play; previously it was called ""A Death at Astapovo"") The first professional version was performed at the Yale Repertory's Winterfest series in 1983 under Lawrence Kornfeld's direction. Reno Roop (as Tolstoy's oldest son) is a holdover from that production, which also had Charles S. Dutton and John Turturro in small roles and Jan Miner as Sonya. For this production, the artistic director of the Phoenix, Bram Lewis, orchestrates the feuding and fussing family, the invading press -- Tolstoy's retreat into the woods at 82 was some media event -- and the stars' iridescent moments as though there were real drama somewhere in there. Ms. Harris, in a flash, retreats into the reassurance of memory, madness and considerations of suicide, shades her voice to the darkest reaches of the virago who means business and glancingly acknowledges the comedy inherent in any photo-op, amid all her protestations. In support, note a capital cast. Philip Baker Hall (Chertkov) is an unrelenting threat, and Timothy Jerome (Dushan) is a well-tempered adversary. Jennifer Harmon, Miriam Healy-Louie, Jud Meyers and Mr. Roop are so intensely and individually effective as the Tolstoy daughters and sons -- Sonya's ""jailers"" -- that they make it theatrically clear that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. If only Mr. Katz had written just how. ""Sonya"" by Leon Katz, produced by the Phoenix Theater at Purchase College in Purchase. Performances continue through next Sunday.

us,LONG ISLAND JOURNAL,"Huffing and Puffing ON Fridays, after Pete Bradley has finished another hard week of work, he heads for his pleasure palace. Not the local bar. The local cigar store. Mr. Bradley spends free time at the Village Tobacconist in Babylon, where visitors can buy cigars and light them up. ""Once a day I enjoy a cigar,"" Mr. Bradley, of Copiague, said. ""It's my celebration for the end of the day."" Part of the delight for cigar lovers is socializing while smoking, said Dan Raser, owner of the cigar shop. So he allows customers to smoke in the shop. ""We have a Smoke-Eater here,"" he said. He also has wingback chairs and antique stand-up ashtrays. The front of the store looks like a living room. Which makes sense, he said, ""because a lot of men aren't allowed to smoke in their own homes. The wife says it makes the rugs and curtains stink. So men come here to smoke."" That can take some time. Mr. Bradley averages 45 minutes to an hour to finish one of his favorite Avo cigars. That seems longer than the Presidential campaign speeches on the harm of smoking. ""I don't inhale, though,"" Mr. Bradley said. With five or six smokers puffing at once, the air in the shop can become a bit smelly. ""We haven't had any complaints yet,"" Mr. Raser said. Not even about the strict antismoking law in Suffolk County. ""I spoke to my lawyer,"" Mr. Raser said. ""He told me to offer my customers membership. So everyone who buys a cigar is a member. It's kind of a club. But there are no dues or minutes."" Before becoming a seller of cigars, Mr. Raser was a seller of bonds. ""People would give me cigars as gifts,"" he said. ""The better the market was doing the more expensive the cigar I would get."" Now he is hooked. ""I enjoy the smell,"" he said, ""and just the whole feeling you get from sitting down and smoking. You can be a ditch digger. But you buy a $5 cigar and take a few puffs and you feel like Donald Trump."" He even has his Marla. ""My fiancee, Denise McWilliams, allows me one cigar a day,"" he said. Ms. McWilliams smokes cigars, too. ""When we go out to dinner,"" Mr. Raser said, ""I light up my big stogie and she lights up her little one."" Ms. McWilliams also helps in the shop. ""We sell before-dinner cigars and after,"" Mr. Raser said. ""There are also aged cigars. It's just like wine."" And becoming as popular. He recently opened a second shop, in Port Jefferson. ""People do work there while they smoke,"" he said. ""They bring their laptop. I have one customer who is a tree surgeon. He had his customer meet him here. They contracted for a job."" The shop seems to offer all the accouterments associated with cigar smoking, except the brandy. ""Oh, the customers bring their own bottles,"" Mr. Raser said. ""Port or cognac. I keep their bottles in the back. I put little stickers on them with the customers' names.""",1996-07-14T05:00:00+0000

us,ART;Power and Imagination in Original Work,"Carroll Dunham Guild Hall Museum, 158 Main St., East Hampton. To July 28. 324-0806. For 10 years Carroll Dunham has been on most everyone's list of young talents to be watched. He manages to pack power, imagination and energy into paintings that seem original, effective and right for our time. In his latest canvases fields of activity are filled with free-flowing doodles and glandular forms that appear to be mining the science fiction in his subconscious. Like much contemporary art, this work explores physicality in new ways. The lush sensuous color is gutsy; cartoonish creaturelike architectural forms burst with an uncanny vitality, and sizable round spores protrude from the surface, spreading in a manner that seems out of control. There is a tendency to interpret the clusters of spores as human or technological viruses, or both. Paintings are crowded and abstract, yet suggestions of real-life content can make them appear unexpectedly edgy. Sometimes the organic forms seem part of fantasy narratives or undefined incidents. It is not unusual for the image to be disquieting and for the tension to build through contrasts between the man-made and the anthropomorphic, the firm and the pliable, the solid and the vulnerable. Scale is unsettling when human characteristics are assigned to geometric buildings. ""Tower,"" with its tilting pink structure, gives the impression of a wired world gone crazy and is one of the show's best examples. Signlike and immediate, ""Visible Language"" suggests a cell magnified into a single icon. Line is basic to all Mr. Dunham's work, because it is his primary way of opening the flow of invention. Be sure to see the wonderful drawings in paint and graphite on papyrus in an area adjacent to the main gallery.

us,The View From: Middlebury;A Desert Hardy That Can Bloom in New England,"EVERY spring, John Spain of Middlebury is notified of the same death. A friend calls to tell him that the garden Mr. Spain started for him did not survive the winter. And every year, Mr. Spain visits a friend's garden and proclaims the cactuses, although shriveled, very much alive and no worse for the snow, harsh winds and sub-zero temperatures. It seems even Mr. Spain's friends have a hard time believing his cactus claim: hundreds of varieties of cactuses, including the well-known prickly pear, can be grown outdoors in Connecticut and survive the winter. There is even a cactus that is native to Connecticut, a wildflower. But Mr. Spain is doubted still; the plants are perceived as much a symbol of the desert as rattlesnakes and scorpions. A retired Uniroyal training executive, Mr. Spain says he has one of the largest collections of winter-hardy cactuses in the country. He grows hundreds of varieties in his backyard, a slice of the Southwest that is only a few yards from rhododendron and fern. The cactuses may seem out of place, but they thrive north of the Mason/Dixie line and can carry a bed all by themselves. They come in various shapes, sizes and blooms of yellow, orange, pink and red. A 60-foot-long bed of cactus only is the centerpiece of Mr. Spain's backyard garden. For the size of his cactus garden, he said he puts in few hours; cactus, of course, require little water. Also, few diseases afflict them in the state, and they do not seem to be part of the food chain for beetles, deer or other pests. But, for all these assets, outdoor cactus gardening in Connecticut is, well, novel.""People are always surprised,"" Mr. Spain said. Most people in the state, including experienced gardeners, know little about cactus and generally assume they can't grow them outside, he said. Mr. Spain is always eager to correct misconceptions, and people who meet him soon learn that cactuses grow near the Arctic circle and in trees. They can be 20 years old and still no bigger than a golf ball, and the plants are native only to North and South America. Some gardeners are aware that cactuses can be grown in Connecticut, but are often mislead at nurseries where the perceived wisdom is that only one yellow-blooming variety is hardy to the region, he said. Before Roseann Richard, owner of Walnut Hill Greenhouse in Litchfield, met Mr. Spain about 10 years ago, she knew of no one who grew cactuses outdoors year-round in the state, and she did not think it possible. ""He proved you could if you treat them a certain way,"" she said. ""Nobody knew which ones you could grow until he came along."" Through trial and error for more than three decades, Mr. Spain has assembled a list of plants that can grow in cold climates, and he has developed ways to help them adapt. When he started, he said, he found only two suppliers of winter-hardy cactus in the entire country. Unlike someone trying to grow roses, Mr. Spain was not going to find answers to his horticultural problems in the local library or nursery. Due to this dearth of information, for almost as long as Mr. Spain has been growing winter-hardy cactuses, he has been educating the public about them. He and a few others successfully lobbied the Northeast Rock Garden Society to accept the cactus as a legitimate alpine plant, with a rock garden pedigree. Mr. Spain, a resident of Connecticut for 24 years, is also a founder and first president of the Connecticut Cactus and Succulent Society. He published a book on winter-hardy cactuses, helped many gardeners start their own collections, and is on the garden-club-speaker circuit. ""He has definitely been the introducer of winter-hardy cactus in the state,"" said Jack Phillips, the current president of the cactus society. ""He has been willing to share time with anyone interested in this hobby."" Mr. Spain's passion for cactus developed by chance in 1966 due to a greenhouse too small for his ambitions. He said he wanted to spend his hours coaxing blooms from orchids, but could not because of the expense involved, and was frustrated with begonias because they took too much room. Then he found the cactus. After a trip to Colorado, he returned with a few cactuses for his three young boys. Though thrilled at first, the boys lost interest in about 20 minutes. ""So then they were mine,"" he said. ""I discovered I could have a whole lot of them and you don't have to water every day."" Easy care is essential for a gardener who travels frequently and has a spouse more interested in needlepoint than horticulture. Soon after, Mr. Spain, then living in Michigan, met a person who grew cactus outdoors and that was the start of his winter-hardy passion. To keep costs down, he has grown many of his plants from seed. While some grow fast, others can take a year and a half just to be the size of a matchstick head. Mr. Spain said there are three main families of cactus that grow in cold climates: echinocereus, coryphantha and opuntia. However, within these families, there are hundreds of varieties. To survive the Connecticut climate, the cactuses need full sun (at least five hours) and excellent drainage. He suggests mixing a lot of sand and gravel into the soil and using raised beds. Mr. Spain said cactuses do like humus-rich soil though. ""They will be growing out of a rock, but don't be fooled, because inside the soil is black as can be,"" he said. A few favorites growing in his own outdoor gardens include one that is 11 years old ""and still that tiny,"" he said, pointing to a plant no bigger than a small loaf of bread. He also dotes on one particular opuntia fragilis, Bronze Beauty, which has pads that turn bronze in winter. He likes it because he got to name it. The plant is unlike its closest relatives and Mr. Spain has been unable to find any documentation of it, so he took the honors of giving it a name. And even though he grows a few orchids now, he is more apt to talk about his opuntia polyacantha Crystal Tide. It has a near-white flower with a blood red center, and he unequivocally calls it the most beautiful of the opuntia blooms. ""I am really not an orchid person,"" he said.",1996-07-14T05:00:00+0000

She talked about hair. ""Sometimes I find it hard to believe I have $500 hair,"" said the 30-something Manhattanite, with subtle blond highlights and an above-the-shoulder tousled layered cut. ""My friends think I'm ridiculous."" But Ms. Stewart, an advertising account executive, is not alone. While the $300 haircut (and $200 highlights) used to be for models or the very well-to-do, it has also become a must for chic young Upper East Siders and well-heeled Connecticut matrons. Waiting lists go from a few months to a year for appointments with many of the high-end stylists of the moment -- John Sahag, Garren at Henri Bendel's, Kim Lepine, Steven Knoll and Mr. Fekkai. ""High-end hair is making a comeback,"" said Charles Booth, owner of the Madison Avenue salon La Coupe for 30 years. Ms. Stewart said: ""Everything is competitive in New York. Great hair may just give you the edge. It makes you think you will do better in the dating market, in the workplace."" High-end hair fits the style of the 90's, in which people express affluence in relatively subtle ways, said Annemarie Iverson, the beauty and health director at Harper's Bazaar. ""A haircut,"" she says, ""is a quiet way to express wealth."" The hair salons are capitalizing on the trend. Frederic Fekkai in a joint venture with Chanel, is taking his business, along with his high-profile clientele (like John F. Kennedy Jr. and Christie Brinkley), from a half-floor space at Bergdorf's to a five-story ""town house in the sky"" in the Chanel building at East 57th Street in mid-August. On Thursday afternoon at his present salon, while Ms. Stewart sat drying her toes, lines of women walked by, in the latest Prada bags and Gucci loafers, waiting for their appointments. There was almost no room to sit. The customers get to wear black monogrammed smocks and drink their fill of coffee, tea or ice water with a twist of lemon. They can order lunch from a menu while their bill is running up to $90 to $295 for less than an hour's work, typical of the high-end salons. The trend, Mr. Fekkai said, is ""very simple short hair, the length between the neck and chin."" Ms. Iverson said: ""It's not necessarily the best haircut in the world. You can pay $60 and get the same thing, but it's the luxe element of going to these salons. People can say they got their hair cut next to Sigourney Weaver."" MONIQUE P.

us,Books in Brief: NonFiction;Faking It,"On the run from the first ominous stirrings of will would become World War II, a young journalist embarks on a tempestuous pocket-Baedeker tour, passing through Monte Carlo, Vienna, Belgrade, Madrid and eventually the Caribbean islands, always pursued by -- and in constant pursuit of -- his memories of the past. Peter Furst's autobiographical novel, DON QUIXOTE IN EXILE (Northwestern University, cloth, $39.95; paper, $15.95), tells an extraordinary tale in marvelously impressionistic language. It is part diary, part dream book, part thriller -- and all the parts blend beautifully. Mr. Furst's prose is sensuous and sinewy, using odd symbols and sudden reactions to capture the dislocation -- linguistic, cultural and emotional -- that his hero feels every step of the way. He tells of faking reports from the Spanish Civil War while comfortably ensconced in a Vienna coffeehouse; of picking cacao beans and poisoning rats in the Dominican Republic; of watching fellow Jews die at border points across Europe even as his German passport (he describes himself as a ""Christian Jew"" because he was baptized) opens the doors to freedom. Alcohol is a friend, while faceless, inane and often evil bureaucrats are the ultimate enemy. Chance encounters lead to quick romance, and even a rambunctious yet doomed marriage, though the ghost of his first love weighs heavy. Mr. Furst's book is perhaps the exile's tale nonpareil: the moving story of a man without home or homeland but able to adapt almost anywhere. Erik Burns",1996-07-14T05:00:00+0000

Before Mr. Mondschein, a 21-year-old college student from Manhattan, was to send the girls and their one honorary boy member into a plot for some old-fashioned digging and planting, he held out a small plant. ""Smell this,"" he said to the group. ""This is basil. It's an herb. Do you know it?"" No answer. ""Have you ever had pesto sauce?"" he continued. ""Well, it's in that."" So began another day on the Urban Farm, an acre of land hard by the Belt Parkway on Rockaway Parkway. At the Seaview Diner next door, patrons can look out not at the sea but at children raking rocks, pulling weeds and patting soil. They used to see stones and a teepee. A group of Mohawk Indians laid claim to the land last year until the Parks Department removed them. Now a leader of the group, John Crosstheriver, returns to give the children lessons in local Native American lore. The tract was adopted this spring by New Perspectives, an economic development corporation in Canarsie, with permission from the Parks and Recreation Department. A $12,000 grant from the State Department of Parks paid for the crops, fence and shovels. The parcel had to be cleared of trash and resoiled. The groups of children who do the planting are supervised by senior citizens from two local centers who make sure the novices are planting the harvest of eggplant, tomatoes, basil and peppers properly. The older men and women show concern as they stand over the boys and girls. After all, once the food is grown, New Perspectives plans to feed it to the seniors at the centers. ""I've desperately wanted to plant stuff for years,"" said 10-year old Felicia Spano who was holding a pink hand shovel. ""People should be thinking about plants."" Last year, the Mohawk group built an encampment on the land when it was still strewn with rocks and discarded junk. From October until Dec. 31, the men meditated inside a sweat lodge and spent the nights there. Visitors were welcome to learn about their traditions. But the group, which wanted to build a museum there, had a permit to use the site only until the end of the year. They refused to leave after the Parks Department asked them to and the agency tore down the teepee and the lodge. Alan Weisberg, executive director of New Perspectives, said he has tried to include the Mohawks in the farm but they have not informed him of their plans and could not be reached for comment.

us,Books in Brief;Mostly the Good Parts,"Right off the bat, Alan King tells us what not to expect in NAME-DROPPING: The Life and Lies of Alan King (Scribner, $23), the scrappy memoir he has written with Chris Chase. ""This book is not going to be heavy drama -- I don't want Robert De Niro playing my life,"" he says. ""I'm not going to remember the bad stuff, I'm only going to remember the singing and dancing."" True to his word, this most quick-witted of comedians nimbly sidesteps his fractious childhood as Irwin Kniberg -- a ""very angry, very tough kid"" who was thrown out of every high school in Brooklyn -- to get to the good parts, which began when he was 15 and landed his first job as a comic in the Catskills. Mr. King tells priceless stories about Bugsy Siegel (his patron during the Las Vegas days, ""when everybody I worked for got killed""), Frank Sinatra (who was declared the winner of their tomato sauce cookoff by judges named Willie the Nose and Morey the Mouth), and a host of other beloved old cronies including Jack Benny, Joe E. Lewis, Milton Berle and Sammy Davis Jr. But like the cocky street fighter he once was, Mr. King has an instinct for someone's weak spots, so the stories that really floor you are about wounded comrades like Dean Martin and Judy Garland. As for his own underbelly, Mr. King allows as how he's got a rotten temper and carries around a load of rage. (But he has nothing but compassion for his father, a Jewish immigrant embittered by real poverty and imagined failure.) ""Most comedians are angry, it's their edge,"" he says. ""When I get angry, I'm better."" Mr. King leaves it to his wife, in a sweet and unaffected chapter called ""Jeanette's Turn,"" to bring up uncomfortable subjects like the comedian's jaw cancer and certain unspecified problems with their children.

us,THEATER;'Sonya': Troubled Life With a Sainted Man,"DURING the first act of ""Sonya,"" the wife of Leo Tolstoy is pointed out as a ""soul in need"" by a doctor and disciple of the literary and philosophical icon. In Act II, a Russian Orthodox priest tells Sonya how he understands her ""cry from the heart."" Such are the playwright Leon Katz's florid elucidations on the overwrought behavior of Countess Sofya Andreyevna Tolstoy, who spends much of her namesake play's three hours making a nuisance of herself, demanding to be let into the cottage where her husband of 48 years lies dying, while hostile forces keep her out. The year is 1910. Since Julie Harris is possessed of the power to communicate an interior life, her enlightened presence gives a playwright the golden gift of time. He can save it. He can cut words. He can redirect priorities. Bluntly put, he can rework his play. As Sonya, Ms. Harris reveals the depth of distress, the ambivalent pull of fierce love in conflict with ideological discord. In a single moment, the actress sums up her reason for being there: to put the stamp of finality and forgiveness -- the buzzword is closure -- on a troubled, unreconciled life with a sainted man. Their ""totally opposite ideas of the meaning and purpose of existence,"" in the words of a letter Tolstoy wrote to Sonya four months before his death, led to estrangement. Sonya could not forsake the materialism that a spiritually converted Tolstoy renounced, or understand his loyalty to his leading disciple, Vladimir Gregorievich Chertkov, with its intimations of homosexuality and an idealism that eluded her. While the puzzling and fascinating ramifications of an extraordinarily volatile marriage that produced 13 children, 4 of whom -- 2 daughters and 2 sons -- figure among an eye-popping stage full of 15 characters, are unexplored, the ravings of Sonya are overexplained. Neither historically lucid nor dramatically fulfilling, Mr. Katz's play reveals a gaping hole at the center, an unsettling inconclusiveness. That Tolstoy remains unseen in a many-peopled play is an interesting challenge Mr. Katz has created, but he has failed to give a revered man a rich offstage life. Yet no playwright could reasonably expect, in three weeks' playing time, a more solid ensemble or a more bountiful production than the Phoenix Theater Company at Purchase College in Purchase, N.Y., has lavished on ""Sonya."" It all starts with the audience's gasp at the sight of Campbell Baird's imposing set, a whopping train that revolves in an obscure railroad station, Astapovo. That happened to be the title of the first professional version of Mr. Katz's play; previously it was called ""A Death at Astapovo."" The first professional version was performed at the Yale Repertory's Winterfest series in 1983 under Lawrence Kornfeld's direction. Reno Roop (as Tolstoy's oldest son) is a holdover from that production, which also had Charles S. Dutton and John Turturro in small roles and Jan Miner as Sonya. For this production, the artistic director of the Phoenix, Bram Lewis, orchestrates the feuding and fussing family, the invading press -- Tolstoy's retreat into the woods at 82 was some media event -- and the stars' iridescent moments as though there were real drama somewhere in there. Ms. Harris, in a flash, retreats into the reassurance of memory, madness and considerations of suicide, shades her voice to the darkest reaches of the virago who means business and glancingly acknowledges the comedy inherent in any photo-op, amid all her protestations. In support, note a capital cast. Philip Baker Hall (Chertkov) is an unrelenting threat, and Timothy Jerome (Dushan) is a well-tempered adversary. Jennifer Harmon, Miriam Healy-Louie, Jud Meyers and Mr. Roop are so intensely and individually effective as the Tolstoy daughters and sons -- Sonya's ""jailers"" -- that they make it theatrically clear that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. If only Mr. Katz had written just how. ""Sonya,"" Phoenix Theater at Purchase College, Purchase, N.Y. 914-251-6290. Performances continue through next Sunday.",1996-07-14T05:00:00+0000

The United States has fielded another strong team for these Games, and Schultz's memory will preside over the competition and provide a certain wistfulness and motivation. THE SETUP Olympic wrestling is divided into two styles, freestyle and Greco-Roman. The difference, essentially, is that freestyle wrestlers can use their legs to execute moves, such as tripping or lifting an opponent, while Greco-Roman wrestlers cannot.

us,L.I. Vines,"Chenin Blanc Paumanok Vineyards, Aquebogue, 1995. About $10. If I suppressed a desire for a gin and tonic or a snappy late-afternoon lemonade in favor of its wine sibling, this zesty white would fill the bill neatly. It is Ursula and Charles Massoud's best chenin blanc to date. Citric and cooling, it is both appetite-whetting and -slaking, depending on one's mood. It is easy to fantasize the presence of a grapefruit infusion. The aftertaste is long long long. This is not a wine for the ages. It is a wine for scallops. And oysters. And grilled light-flavored fish in butter sauce. Chenin blanc is a minor player in East End vineyards. The Massouds have been at it gamely since 1991. In this just-released latest version -- a young wine, intended to be drunk young -- they have brought the acidity under control and heightened the fruit. This equates to balance. When really icy, it is refreshing in a severe way; when cool, it is smooth and quite fruity; when finished, it invites a second bottle. Only 250 cases were made. HOWARD G.

How four of five justices could interpret the placing of 20 crates for two years in an otherwise dormant 16-story warehouse as a continuation of ""substantially all"" of an enterprise's operations is beyond me. Semantics and technicalities aside, zoning laws are supposed to be protective devices. A store that size with three loading docks for tractor-trailers on a narrow one-way city street would be disastrous for this neighborhood. Vehicular traffic would be a nightmare, parking unfathomable, noise and air pollution sickening and hordes of new pedestrians (and the accompanying litter and fast-food joints) oppressive and stifling. In short, it would cease to be a residential neighborhood. Tens of thousands live here precisely for the quiet ambiance and small neighborhood stores, and a great many of us and our political representatives are vehemently opposed to a megastore at this location.

Austin walks up and down the aisles, marking with stakes the promising candidates, 4,800 in all, which will be budded onto rootstock and planted outside in test fields.

us,Books in Brief: FICTION;Life Among the Worm Burners,"Part coming-of-age story and part paean to life on the links, Turk Pipkin's charming first novel, FAST GREENS (Dial, $19.95), is narrated by Billy Hemphill, who wistfully recalls his childhood living with his grandmother in West Texas in the 1960's. ""Golf is a noble game,"" he says early on, ""a combination of uncertain skill and specific laws, untainted by ethical dilemmas or moral quandaries."" It's the players who are tainted, of course, as Billy discovers at age 13 when he agrees to be a caddy in a bizarre grudge match between two grizzled old oilmen, Roscoe Fowler and William March, and their partners, Carl (Beast) Larsen, ""the biggest, meanest, ugliest golfer that ever came out of Texas,"" and Sandy Bates, a fine player with a reputation for choking in head-to-head matchups with the Beast. In the course of nine holes on a torrid summer morning, with money, land, pride and a woman's affections at stake, the members of this foursome resort to a wild assortment of scams, cons and psych jobs to square a bitter dispute that goes back 27 years. It hardly matters that the plot is a bit predictable and the writing overly sentimental in places; the narrative is endowed with a vivid sense of time and place, the characters are wonderfully drawn and the dialogue is sharp and colorful. And at the heart of ""Fast Greens"" is the game itself, whose lore and wisdom are lovingly imparted. Amid all the talk of ""mulligans,"" ""worm burners"" and ""duck hooks"" lies an unmistakable -- and infectious -- passion for a pastime that is ""more religion than sport, a religion with a very tiny and unforgiving goal: perfection.""

Singer, an Orthodox rabbi, heads Outreach Judaism, a group based in Monsey, N.Y., whose real purpose is to reconnect with lapsed Jews.

Unexpectedly, opposite-direction converts have sprung up: in a small-but-tangy pay-back at a time when the Southern Baptist Convention has re-upped its efforts to reel in Jews, the series has also changed the minds of a few dozen evangelical Christians in Texas. Singer refers such hopefuls to local rabbis, but he recently flew to Texas to celebrate a Sabbath with Michael Flanigan, a former pastor who is shepherding his family through the arduous conversion process. What turned the tide? ""I was shocked to see how much of the New Testament is, for lack of a better word, fictitious,"" says Flanigan, a quietly serious man.

Jarrell was born 31 years ago with cerebral palsy, one of its cruel adjuncts being an esophagus that ended abruptly in a pouch, unconnected to her stomach. Five surgeries to fix this anomaly had riddled her frail chest with scar tissue, and over the past four years she had lost the ability to ingest and keep down food. Now for 12 hours each day, a ghastly viscous liquid seeped down a feeding tube imbedded in her abdomen to sustain her 72-pound body. Her daily list of medications, a pharmacological cornucopia addressing everything from pain to nausea to depression, filled a double-spaced sheet of paper.",1996-07-21T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Poeschke emphasizes the serendipity of Michelangelo's era, the great luck that patrons, popes and artists could all agree that ""the human figure was the most perfect image of the divine in the earthly realm."" It was an era ideal for sculpture; cities like Florence and Rome ordered colossal, freestanding works for the first time since antiquity. Mr. Poeschke, an art historian who teaches at the University of Dusseldorf, chronicles the triumph of this medium with a comprehensive set of 399 photographs, 52 of them in color. He includes all of the major sculptural achievements of this period; many are shown in various angles and with specific details enlarged. The final portion of the book describes the artwork, piece by piece. Mr. Poeschke often chides art historians for engaging in overinterpretation; he very sensibly refuses to believe that much of this artwork is meant to convey esoteric messages to a privileged few. This final section would serve as an excellent textbook; however, few readers will need or desire such minutiae. Only a specialist would be interested in each successive plan for the tomb of Pope Julius II, a project that engaged Michelangelo intermittently for 40 years. Douglas A.

Ralph Hahn, an aide to Assemblyman James W. Holzapfel, Republican of Brick Township, said the state inquiry took months longer than it should have because of inadequate reports from health care professionals. Today, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is to sign a bill that would provide $400,000 to set up a statewide cancer registry. The bill, sponsored by Mr. Holzapfel, would also set fines of up to $1,000 per day for doctors and medical centers who fail to report cancer cases.",1996-07-22T05:00:00+0000

Paine Webber Group Inc., the parent company of the brokerage, said the settlement would not cost it anything more than the reserves it had already set aside. The settlement provides $125 million in cash and additional guarantees valued at $75 million, according to Nicholas Chimicles, the lawyer who headed a committee of law firms that represented 150,000 disgruntled investors. The value of the guarantees could change as the value of the partnerships fluctuate. Paine Webber guaranteed that some of the plaintiffs would get their original investments back by the year 2000. It guaranteed for others, depending on which partnership they had invested in, minimum payments by the same year. Paine Webber will pay the $125 million in cash to those who had invested in partnerships without guarantees, Mr. Chimicles said. Paine Webber brokers sold about $2.5 billion in real estate, energy and other limited partnerships between 1980 and 1992. Investors contended the brokers misrepresented the risks involved, used fraudulent marketing materials and collected inflated fees.

While Don Hudler said Saturn continued to make improvements to increase production at its Spring Hill, Tenn., plant, he gave no indication when or if G.M. would foot the bill to expand the plant or build another. An additional 50,000 cars sold would generate more than $600 million in annual revenue. Mr. Hudler also said Saturn was studying a possible expansion of its three-model lineup. His comments came as Saturn showed off its redesigned coupe, the 1997 SC1 and SC2, to Detroit's automotive press. The company sold 285,674 cars last year, about the same as 1994, which amounted to a 10 percent share of the combined small-car and sport coupe segments.

us,"Nature Explored, Indoors and Out","SPEND much time in the country and you come to realize that nature doesn't present itself all at once, like a neatly packaged video, but comes in haphazard flashes and flurries that can't be forced. This can be a bit maddening for those whose understanding is in a rush, or those who have only a short time in the country each year. We'd like, say, warblers to jump out of the pines in their brightest colors, give a quick identifying whistle, pose long enough for pictures, build a nest, lay some eggs, turn an aerial somersault, then do all these again in slow motion. In the real country such sightings tend to come scattered and slow, like a jigsaw puzzle only one piece of which is issued you each year. Luckily, there are places where these pieces are collected for us, identified, displayed and interpreted: first-class science museums. Here in north-central New England we're fortunate to have four excellent museums spaced within the radius of an easy half-day's drive, and there's no better way to deepen your understanding of regional flora, fauna and landscape (and sky scape!) than by spending some time at any or all, hiking their trails, studying the exhibits, listening to their resident naturalists explain what nature is up to in these hills. Vermont Institute of Natural Science, Vermont Raptor Center High on a meadow above Woodstock is the Vermont Institute of Natural Science, with barnlike headquarters, nature trails and a quiet beaver pond. These are interesting in their own right (there's no better place to study nature than an old hill farm reverting back to forest), but the big attraction here is the Vermont Raptor Center, where hawks and owls and other birds of prey that have been wounded by accidents are rehabilitated so that they may be sent back to live in the wild. Birds that can't be released, those that are permanently disabled by car accidents or gunshots, are enclosed in spacious flight habitats connected by a gravel path. Bald eagles, great horned owls, the tiny three-ounce saw-whet owl (Vermont's smallest raptor), peregrine falcons, a plump snowy owl -- there are more than 26 species here, sent to the center from as far away as Alaska. Since raptors tend to be among the most elusive species to spot in the wilds, particularly those that are nocturnal (in a lifetime of hiking these woods, I've only spotted an owl three or four times), such a venue provides a priceless opportunity to get to know these birds better. The remarkable thing about raptors, of course, is their eyes, their visual acuity. Walking from the enclosure, stopping to read at the helpful interpretative stations, glancing back up, you have the uncanny sense you're not watching the raptors at all, but that they are watching you, and not only that, but watching you more intensely than you've ever been watched. Montshire Museum of Science Just over 20 miles to the east off I-91 is the Montshire Museum of Science in Norwich, Vt. This is my family's favorite -- not only is it our rainy day old-reliable, but it provides the best learning tools we've found to help us understand the environment we live in. The museum itself is a striking, modern structure that sits on a promontory of land between the Connecticut River and the marshy bay at the mouth of Bloody Brook; one of the gentlest, most interesting nature trails leads down through tall white pines to the bay's shady banks. Inside the museum is what must surely be one of the greatest assemblages of hands-on, child-friendly exhibits ever gathered in one place, all of which, in a most entertaining way, introduce children to the basics of the natural world -- physics, optics, electricity, gravity, biology. The enchanting physics of the bubble, for example, comes to life in a play area where children explore bubbles with a variety of tanks, hoops and wands. There's a special museum called Andy's Place, which has exhibits for pre-schoolers, from crawl-through dens to animal puppets and exploratory mazes. Even the building's interior contributes to the lessons; a color-coded ventilation system, the see-through elevator shaft and exposed trusses all quietly demonstrate how a building ""works."" My children love the freshwater aquariums the best, finding the bass, perch, trout and frogs much more relevant to their own experience than the exotic tropicals most aquariums feature. We also enjoy the brand-new Hazen Trail, which leads a mile and a half along the banks of the Connecticut, and gives many insights into this unique riverine environment. (Pick up a coded guide at the desk for explanations of what you're seeing.) Unlike some children's museums, the Montshire (whose name comes from the last syllables of Vermont and New Hampshire) offers plenty of interest for adults, from star-watching nights to lectures on the environment to courses on the natural history of the nearby river. Save a long morning or afternoon for this museum, to explore it right. Christa McAuliffe Planetarium Both the Vermont Institute of Natural Science and the Montshire got started through the efforts of dedicated bands of local volunteers. The planetarium in Concord, N.H., had a quite different origin: a national outpouring of grief. Almost immediately after the Challenger disaster of Jan. 26, 1986, some kind of memorial was planned to honor the New Hampshire school teacher Christa McAuliffe, who taught in Concord and was one of the astronauts killed (indeed, letters and donations began pouring in before there was even any kind of foundation to accept them). The Christa McAuliffe Planetarium, an hour's drive east of the Montshire off I-393, was the outcome. The planetarium, quite literally, is a bright triangle of light, with its modern pyramidlike structure rising skyward above the nondescript suburban plain. Inside are displays not only about the night sky but also about Christa McAuliffe's life, including examples of those cards and letters sent after her death from children around the world. The atmosphere, with this background, could be gloomy, but it's anything but, and seems to tap into some of Christa McAuliffe's own vivacity and enthusiasm. The centerpiece attraction is the planetarium's comfortable 92-seat theater, where sky shows that use a state-of-the-art sound system, vivid animation, computer graphics and hand-held ""voting"" machines (which let the audience vote on such things as which planet they'd like to explore next) combine to produce a realistic, entertaining and, yes, educational science experience, this time centered on the glories and mysteries of the night sky. The planetarium is a rainy-day backup when it's too soggy to explore the outdoor museums, but it's more than that, too, and since it's right on one of the main routes to the White Mountains, it makes a great place to break up the long drive north. The schedule of shows changes fairly often here, so more than in most places, it's best to call ahead to find out what's up. Science Center Of New Hampshire An hour's drive up I-93 to Route 3 is the Science Center of New Hampshire, set on 200 acres of gently rising upland on the western shore of Squam Lake (of ""On Golden Pond"" fame) in the busy resort center of Holderness. Here the shopworn notion of a ""nature trail"" has been taken in new and creative directions. Called the Gephart Exhibit Trail, it's a beautifully designed walkway three quarters of a mile long, linking live animal displays (wounded or orphaned animals including bobcats, bears, otters and raptors), and hands-on children's activities in a huge cedar barn, including games, puzzles and interpretative displays. This is supplemented by two other linked trails: the Ectome trail, with exhibits based on the four major ecosystems that can be found on the property, and the Mount Fayal trail, which leads to the rocky summit of a 1,067-foot mountain with excellent views of big Squam. This is primarily an outdoor museum for children, with many activities all season long, but the kind of place any adult will enjoy as well. One of my own favorite spots to visit, when things get a little hectic down below, is the site of the old Piper Homestead (well marked on the trail map you can pick up at the visitor center), where the old foundation holes under the pines, the ruins of the old stone walls, speak volumes of the lonely, hardscrabble life led by the farmers who tried to wrest a living from this rocky soil a century ago. The lake country of New Hampshire can be a busy place in summer months, but the Science Center as a whole, and this quiet, shaded corner of it in particular, are a most welcome refuge -- and not only for animals but for those of us who seek out such spots, where nature and man can share the space of a summer day.",1996-07-28T05:00:00+0000

us,NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MIDTOWN;Tunnel Visions: Subway Fanatics Tell Their Tales,"Last Wednesday evening, a little bookshop on Rockefeller Plaza resounded with discussions of intricate detail and exquisite scholarship. ""The D-types were my favorite cars but the fact is they had to go,"" said one man who gestured excitedly to his nodding conversation partner. ""They were old and slow. Sometimes you have to kill the sacred cows."" Said another man to a rapt young lady: ""When people ask me whether the PATH train is better than the subway, I say what time of day? What day of the week?"" They were among the trainophiles gathered at New York Bound Bookshop, which specializes in works about the city. In theory the attraction was a book signing in honor of the publication of James Clifford Greller's ""Subway Cars of the BMT"" and Susie Tanenbaum's ""Underground Harmonies."" In practice the signing party was a nice excuse for a gathering of that rare breed of New Yorker, the subway fanatic. People at the party said the city has about two dozen hardcore subway scholars, who write detailed monographs on the subject and maybe a few thousand assorted trainspotters, who record subway movements, and hobbyists, who just love to think about trains. Almost all are men -- this is somehow a male fixation -- and most are middle-aged. Although there are clubs for them like the 500-member Electric Railroaders Association, many work alone. So the 40 enthusiasts who came to the bookstore renewed old acquaintances with pleasure as they drank wine and listened to Jon Graseck, a violinist who usually plays in the subway. Mostly they get along, but there are some burning issues that divide them. Some claim that specific lines like the No. 3 are superior to others. Some believe that Fiorello La Guardia saved the subway by unifying it under the control of the city in the 1930's and others think he ruined it. ""You get people who will argue over what train stopped where in 1932,"" said Joe Cunningham, a 44-year-old engineer from Jackson Heights, Queens, and habitual No. 7 rider who writes about trains full time. ""If it's relevant to history it makes sense, but at other times it becomes absurd."" The star of the night was Mr. Greller, a New Jersey Transportation Department executive who has published three transportation books. He worked the room, signing books and cracking jokes. Typical for a local train fanatic, he is city born, in his case Brooklyn, and motivated both by a romance for powerful machines and by a nostalgia for New York the way it used to be. ""Brooklyn was like the Florence of the transportation business,"" he said, relating the building of the BMT to the flowering of the Renaissance. Most in the room love to toss off arcane facts like the old name of the G line (the GG) and the reason that IRT trains can't run in the rest of the system (the IRT cars are narrower to fit into tunnels that are older and tighter than the rest). These fanatics say they are also motivated by the idea that without them much subway history would be lost. Said Mr. Geller, his fist pumping the air for emphasis: ""I got angry that some of the big advances that the city made in transportation weren't even documented.""

Since few campaign contributors want to back a loser, the Whitman campaign worried that contributions would dry up, making it difficult for Mrs. Whitman to start a television advertising blitz in the final days before the election. But Michael D. Francis, chairman of the campaign's finance committee, kept the money flowing. Although he made few public appearances with Mrs. Whitman and was rarely mentioned in the press, he held one of the most influential positions in the campaign. After the election, he was chairman of her inaugural committee.

Today there are four large companies, which spent $1.2 billion in 1995. That represents 10 percent of all pharmaceutical research and development in the country.

us,NEW YORKERS & CO.;Where to Hoist in Red Hook,"IN the fall of 1945, John Balzano came back from World War II in Europe and made local history. He immediately wrote off all the outstanding tabs at John's Restaurant and Bar, which he and his brother Rafael had owned together since the late 1930's, and thus became a legend along the docks of Red Hook, Brooklyn. In what was then a rough waterfront neighborhood, respect was the measure of a man, and John Balzano never took it for granted. ""The fact that this place still exists after all these years, after all that has happened to Red Hook, is a testimony to the respect that my uncle John got from the people,"" said Antonio R. Balzano, 62, Rafael's son. ""People remember this place because of him."" John's Restaurant and Bar, at the foot of Conover Street, has outlived by 15 years the last of the 30-odd other saloons that were once in the area. It is a virtual time capsule from the 1940's, a remnant of what was a bustling wartime port half a century ago. But it is also a symbol and the centerpiece of a revitalized Red Hook. John's nearly faded into history like the surrounding neighborhood when John Balzano died in 1994. He didn't leave a will -- and that, Antonio Balzano said, left a ""wall of obstacles"" to keeping the place going. ""I was ready to let it all go,"" he said, dragging on his umpteenth Marlboro of the day. The liquor license held by John Balzano expired on Jan. 31, and with legal delays keeping the bar closed, Mr. Balzano decided to reopen it as a nonprofit organization, with the support of John Balzano's 15 other heirs. ""I had a mailing list of people -- artists, everybody -- and when I wrote them this idea,"" he said, ""I got a tremendous response. More than 200 people replied."" For now, John's operates as the nonprofit Red Hook Canoe and Yacht Club -- but to add to the confusion, patrons call it Sonny's, after Antonio Balzano's nickname. Its status as a club, however, is hardly exclusive -- upon entering, nonmembers need only hook up with one of the regulars, most of them local artists who pay a $25 annual membership fee, and sign a guest book. There is a suggested donation of $3 per drink, and tabs are scribbled on paper casters. As Red Hook undergoes a slow renaissance sparked by artists seeking to escape the high rents of Manhattan, John's has become a focal point of this rebirth, and conversation now dwells on the Edward Hopper-like quality of sunlight in the neighborhood rather than shipping schedules. On Fridays evenings -- the only time the club currently operates -- people drift down to the end of Conover Street to admire the sunset over the harbor and pour back into John's afterward. Around the original hand-carved oak bar, which stretches the length of the first of its three rooms, the club's yellowing walls are lined with prints of Holland-America line ships, models and paintings of boats and military memorabilia. In the 1940's, Red Hook was home to Navy drydocks and to hundreds of ships moored between Piers 41 and 49. Among other period pieces like a Blatz Beer boiled-egg dispenser, hand-painted plaster statues of the Marx brothers, Mark Twain, Humphrey Bogart and Louis Armstrong peer through the half-light toward three massive coffee urns that Antonio Balzano said served up to 3,500 cups of a coffee a day during the 1940's. ""Nothing in here has been changed,"" he said. ""If you take three or four things out of the place, it won't be the same anymore."" The restaurant, with a view over the Buttermilk Channel toward the Statue of Liberty, was founded by Marc Antonio and Angelina Balzano, immigrants who arrived from Naples in 1890. Their daughter, Grace, born March 17, 1906, is the oldest surviving member of the family. During the 1920's, the restaurant operated under a complicated partnership, and a yellowed certificate issued by New York City's Licensing Department and dated July 1924 certifies that John Balzano's brother-in-law, John Happe, was permitted to operate a pool table on the premises at $5 per annum. The several apartments above the restaurant are the exclusive domain of the Balzanos -- no one outside the family has ever lived there. Twenty-six thousand people lived in Red Hook by the mid-1950's, but the advent of container ships that were too large for the channel meant a loss of jobs for longshoremen and other dock workers and brought the neighborhood to the brink of extinction. Today, Red Hook is home to no more than 3,500 people, said John McGettrick, a local historian and co-chairman of the Red Hook Civic Society. Antonio Balzano was among the thousands who left. He was an aspiring artist and actor, but after four years in the Air Force in California, he ended up going to work for a jeweler in Manhattan's diamond district. Unsatisfied, he soon quit to paint full time in the early 1960's. His first break came when he was commissioned to paint murals at Le Boeuf a la Mode, a restaurant on East 81st Street, which led to an offer to work as an assistant to Larry Rivers and Willem de Kooning. ""But I was brash,"" he said. ""I wanted to be a real artist."" He turned down an offer to teach at Southampton University and spent the rest of the 1960's on the party circuit. In 1970, emotionally spent, he decided to seek spirituality in India, where he spent most of the next decade. In 1980, after his father became ill with cancer, Mr. Balzano returned to Red Hook to help out in the bar, eventually taking over when Rafael died in 1987. But when John Balzano died without a will, ownership of the bar was not immediately clear. In the club's basement, Mr. Balzano's girlfriend, Tona Johansen, pointed out a huge pile of yellowing documents. ""John kept everything, every piece of paper, but never kept it in any order,"" she said. ""It has made things difficult, complicated."" But with the help of Ms. Johansen and other friends, accounts have been sorted out, junk cleared and refrigerators rewired. Mr. Balzano has applied for a liquor license and, if it is approved, plans to rename the place Balzano's. The influx of artists and young people into the area has brought with it new energy, and on Friday nights aspiring musicians play to an appreciative crowd. The mix is eclectic: country rock alternates with Lou Reed-style rock poetry, and the later the hour, the darker the lyrics. Kim Faiella, a painter from Brooklyn Heights, is positively possessive about Sonny's, as she calls it. ""This place is so special, it has not changed at all,"" she said. ""It has attracted its own artist community from all over Brooklyn. There is great energy here, and we are very excited about what is happening in Red Hook now."" Mr. Balzano said: ""This place does not belong to me. It belongs to all the good people here.""",1996-07-28T05:00:00+0000

It seems that from the time he built his first radio set ""from glass tubes and a spool of lead,"" George has been convinced that ""the universe was soldered together with logic."" So it isn't surprising that he reacts with ""fatherly embarrassment"" to his new junior office mate's revelation that she experiments with radio frequencies in order to listen for the dead. In fact, George knows that Niagara Spense, who is partly deaf in one ear, has difficulty hearing many things. What is surprising -- most of all to George himself -- is that, despite his disbelief, Niagara inspires in him ""a burning curiosity that had not flared in some 20 years."" And in no time curiosity becomes obsession. When he awakens his wife, Judy, yelling, ""Niagara,"" she replies, ""You had better be screaming about vacation."" For George, who has had no complaints or extramarital liaisons during his largely unexamined 16-year marriage, Niagara is an improbable love object. Ungainly, untidy and chaotic, she is the antithesis of Judy, ""a Georgia brand of Southern belle."" But Niagara's presence makes George aware of the fine line between contentment and stagnation. As he explains it, ""If you leave a car parked long enough, the tires go flat and the battery won't hold a charge."" By the end of the novel, when Niagara and her research have enabled George to recapture a few sparks, Ms. Zuravleff's insightful yet gentle rendering of the absurd has also allowed readers to connect fully with her quirky and endearing characters.

Characterized by explosive and athletic dancing, Ms. Pivar's ensemble, Amy Pivar Dances, is an unusual collaboration between Ms. Pivar; Freda Rosen, a social therapist, and Phillip Carroll, a singer-composer. The program will explore women's relationships and social issues. One piece, ""Not a Concession,"" deals with rape and incest. Ms. Pivar, in foreground at right, was one of the winners, in 1986, of the New York Dance and Performance Awards, popularly known as Bessies, after Bessie Schonberg, a noted teacher of dance composition. On Thursday at 7 P.M., an open workshop at the Prospect Park Picnic House will explore live music for dance and give the public an opportunity to talk with Ms. Pivar, Ms. Rosen and Mr. Carroll. Nona Hendryx was 16 when she and Patti LaBelle and Sarah Dash formed the rhythm-and-blues trio Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles back in the 1960's. They broke out of the traditional girl-group mold and evolved into the rock-soul group LaBelle, which achieved enormous popularity and influence before breaking up in the 1970's. Ms. Hendryx went on to a notable solo career, with forays onto the cutting edge of funk, though these days, she performs only a few times a year.

us,"COPING;A Director in a Hurry, Creating Her Own Myth","GALT NIEDERHOFFER has a meeting at Fox tomorrow on a possible distribution deal for her first featurefilm, but before she left for Hollywood last week she had time to dictate, on request, an opening sentence for this story: ""Despite the disadvantages of an Upper East Side upbringing, this 20-year-old woman, crafty, quick, obsessive, hopes to effect the marriage of business and art."" The trace of self-mockery was only for effect. The film, ""Myth America,"" may be a satire about chaotic young downtown women making a voie to find their identities, but Ms. Niederhoffer is as organized as a clock, and she thinks it's her time. She has raised $2 million - all from strangers, she insists - and she has just finished 24 days directing an interesting group of young actors. Ms. Niederhoffer takes herself seriously, although she does describe herself as ""shameless."" It isnot hard to imagine her chasing a celebrity downt he street, waving her script. She has a press agent, which is how we came to have lunch. She ascribes to a handy brand of social Darwinsim. ""Capitalism and the free market weed out the bad stuff,"" she said. ""If you're good, you'll get out there. And making a movie is all about the art of the bluff. You bluff the investors about the actors you have and you bluff the actors about the investors. But write down that I never lied."" We were sitting in a downtown dinner. I wrote it down. She picked at my french fries. ""Do you ahve disdain for all this?"" ""Only bewilderment,"" I said. ""Could we take it from the top?"" Ms. Niederhoffer is tall, blonde, blue-eyed and rosy-cheeked. She looks as though she played varsity squash at Harvard, which she did, after Chapin and Milton Academy. She was indeed raised on the Upper East Side. Her father, Victor Niederhoffer, is a wealthy investor, Harvard graduate and former national squash champion. Her parents are divorced. Ms. Niederhoffer says she always thought of herself as a writer and a film maker - while at Harvard she helped found a lampoon of the Lampoon (The Harpoon) and produced a short film - but it was not until doctors told her she had temporal lobe epilepsy, a disease of partial seizures that affect memory, perceptions of reality and visceral senations, that she felt the urgency to get on with her career. She was 19. ""Don't write all that down."" she directed. ""i have disdain for people who use their illnesses to explain their lives. But it was a trigger. Six days before last New Year's Eve, when I was still in and out of hospitals, I decided that if I didn't do something meaningful that year I never would. I wrote the first draft of 'Myth America' in six days. I am not a creative genius. I listen to people and do revisions."" At that moment I thought Ms. Niederhoffer might be some kind of genius after all. The people at Fox, Miramax, all those who sign at the X, love to give money to Gen X, but only if they will show humility and do revisions. I pushed the plate of fries to her side of the table. She dropped out of Harvard to start ""Myth America"" and ""Hurricane,"" a second feature film, out of an office on Wooster Street. She raised the money, she said, in large chunks, from ""wannabe moguls."" She said she never went to family or to friends of her father because ""self-funded art is devalued."" Besides, the world is filled with rich people desperate to get into movie-making and with hungry actors who will audition for other people's dreams. ""Getting others to believe in your bluff is what raising money and directing actors is all about,"" she said, ""and believing in your own bluff, having faith in your concept, is how you get well. By acting on your belief you have created it. I got well by believing I could get well. This is William James. Am I making sense? Would you like to see dailies?"" The scenes looked smart and promising, but maybe I was jsut buying into the bluff. Ally Sheedy looks haunted as a heroin addict, and there are rising young actors, Eric Mabius, Justin Pierce and Brendon Sexton 3d int he cast, as well as Ms. Neiderhoffer's Harvard friend Rashida Jones (Quincy's daughter); Dechen Thurman (Uma's brother), Jennifer Stander (Lionel's daughter) and Anika Poitier (Sidney's daughter). Production notes underline these relationships. Elizabeth Wurtzel (the author of ""Prozac Nation"") plays herself; she and Ms. Niederhoffer have the same therapist. Having written the opener, Ms. Niederhoffer suggested a closer, her favorite lines in the script. ""It's impossible to say anything original. I'm on a quest to recover mythic glamor in a culture where heroes do voice-overs, heroine's a drug, the American glamour girl overdosed and the matinee idol is our ideal."" I explained that I was the director here, so we would close with my favorite line in the script, ""That's why I want to make movies, to control the atmosphere.",1996-07-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Let Lawmakers Put Brakes On 'Hot Pursuit' by Police,"To the Editor: Joe Sharkey's column ""When a Police Car Is a Lethal Weapon"" (Jersey, July 7) shows that ""hot pursuit"" chases pose a serious threat to the public, especially in a densely populated state like New Jersey. At least 5 people were killed and 251 injured in 1,237 pursuits last year, according to incomplete statistics from the State Attorney General's office. Yet New Jersey is moving backward by easing some of the legal restraints that can curb irresponsible actions by officers who engage in high-speed chases. Last month, the State Supreme Court ruled that police officers responding in good faith to emergencies cannot be sued for injuries to innocent bystanders. At the same time, the Assembly passed a bill shielding the police from lawsuits for injuries inflicted during chases. These judicial and legislative actions clearly favor law enforcement at the expense of innocent bystanders. In an attempt to strike a better balance, Assemblyman Joseph Charles Jr. and I have drafted a measure that would hold government agencies liable for the negligent acts of their officers. Injured parties could seek compensation if they were injured as a result of a police officer's ""willful misconduct"" in failing to abide by state guidelines for police chases. The threat of a civil monetary penalty would certainly insure that officers and departments think twice before entering into high-speed, high-risk chases.",1996-07-28T05:00:00+0000

us,The View From: Yale-New Haven Hospital;Cold Wet Noses That Lift The Spirits of Young Patients,"THE patients wear pajamas decorated with dancing animals. The visitors wear fur topped by snappy red uniforms. In the children's acute-care units of Yale-New Haven Hospital, smiles are all too often missing. Tuesday afternoons, however, it's another story. Then, an unusual breed of volunteers arrives at the wards, tails wagging, enormous paws on beds, and tongues tickling every little face that leans forward. The canine candy-stripers tour the rooms with their handlers: Chukker and Sirius, golden retrievers, and their respective owners, Barbara McCullough and Marian Spiro; Rufus, a chocolate lab, with Vicki Chave Clement, and Cricket, a mixed breed, with Bonnie King. Each team visits once a month on a rotating basis. The Dog Visitation Program that spreads such cheer through the children's, adolescent and psychiatric pediatric units is a one-year pilot that was started in March. Its popularity is evident not only in the patient rooms but also in the corridors, where each dog, like a wooly Pied Piper, collects a trail of staffers, visitors and children in wheelchairs. While the dogs obviously share in the enjoyment, they can be distracted. Chukker is reluctant to tear himself away from a nose-level aquarium in the hallway and, Ms. McCullough admitted, ""We have to turn off television during the visits. Chukker would rather watch the Muppets than visit. He's also very turned on by stuffed animals."" Permission to enter a room is always obtained from the parent and care taken that the dog visit is appropriate. For instance, a child who is in the hospital as a result of a dog attack is not a likely prospect. Usually, however, wan children perk up and reach out to pat when the dogs appear. Most children leave the hospital in less than a week but those who stay longer form a close bond with the dogs. One 8-year-old boy, hospitalized for a liver transplant, was even allowed a visit while in intensive care. ""It was very touching to see the child reach out to the dog; the only thing he could move was his hand because he had tubes everywhere else,"" recalled the volunteer program coordinator, Annie Garcia Kaplan. Another child, who had been receiving chemotherapy, could not have a dog in his room. No problem; he and the dog were held up on opposite sides of the room window, giving each other kisses through the glass. It was Ms. McCullough, a former nurse, who proposed the dog visitations. ""I'd read about these programs in nursing homes, and I knew about the one at Gaylord Rehabilitation Hospital,"" she said. ""I thought, 'I haven't been back to the bedside in so long and this is the way I want to do it.' But I wanted to do it in the acute care, because I felt the need was so great."" She approached the director of volunteer services at Yale-New Haven, Jeannette Hodge, who suggested looking at the program at Newington Children's Hospital, which then helped in the planning. The trial program took more than two years to develop, Ms. Hodge said. ""It was a very novel idea,"" she said. ""There are not a lot of large medical centers like ours doing this kind of program. Most are convalescent homes, children's hospitals or rehab settings. We needed to look at all the ramifications of bringing animals into a setting where many of our patients are very, very sick. ""The challenge came in being certain that we had thought of everything single thing in terms of vet protocol, screening of the owners, screening of the dog, the timing. All things took time to really think through to be sure we thought of everything."" Ms. McCullough also recruited Dr. Eleanor Weir, a veterinarian and professor of comparative medicine at Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Weir is a Madison resident as are the dog and owner teams, except for Ms. King who lives in New Haven. In developing the veterinary protocol Dr. Weir talked with colleagues involved in similar programs. An epidemiologist also was consulted to be certain the young patients were not exposed to unnecessary health problems as a result of bringing in animals, and to determine how to screen patients who could not see the animals for medical reasons. ""The dogs have to go through two types of testing,"" Dr. Weir said. ""They have to have passed the Kennel Club Canine Good Citizen's test, which is just to show the dog is well-mannered and will tolerate a certain amount of stress, like hair pulling. They also have a behavioral and physical exam by a vet, for health reasons."" The physical exams are rigorous and are repeated every six months to be sure the dogs are not harboring organisms that put the patients at risk. In addition, the dogs, particularly the long-haired golden retrievers who love their daily swim in Long Island Sound, must be arduously groomed and scrutinized for fleas and ticks before each hospital visit. Why are dogs so quick to touch the hearts of children who are otherwise unresponsive? ""Animals are not threatening,"" explained Ms. Kaplan. ""When children come here, unfortunately, they may perceive humans as doing all sorts of poking and examining, but they know the animal is only coming to give them love. They feel the hair, the sense of tranquillity. It also may be that the child misses a pet at home."" She recalled the experience of one young patient in the psychiatric inpatient children's unit. ""He had a serious, aggressive behavior problem and wanted nothing to do with the dog. But once he sat down with the dog, the change was instantaneous. He even insisted on giving it his own stuffed animal. The rest of the day and the next morning, his behavior was perfect."" The staff later learned that the boy's own dog had been shot in a housing complex as he watched. If there is any problem with the trial program, it is that there are not more dogs. Everyone wants the visitors. ""Once while we were going up to the unit with one of the dogs, we ran into a lady here in the hallway,"" Ms. Kaplan recalled. ""She insisted we come up to see her son. But he was in the adult unit and we didn't have permission. This young man was hooked into a heart monitor and his mother went upstairs, got permission to unhook him, and the next thing we knew, he was down here."" Ms. McCullough noted that nurses in neonatal unit staff have requested that the dogs visit to relieve stress there. ""We hope we can meet these special needs and recruit more dogs once the year's trial is over,"" she said. Meanwhile, her wish for the program is ""For children to say their strongest memory of the hospital was that, 'A dog came to visit me.' Then I'll know we've been a success.""",1996-07-28T05:00:00+0000

The fine, by far the largest in the history of the Agriculture Department, upheld the allegations Dr. Moor-Jankowski had made as a whistle-blower. Last week the Agriculture Department released its investigative report on the case. It listed 15 separate instances of retaliation and concluded that the N.Y.U. Medical Center ""did in fact bring reprisals"" against Dr. Moor-Jankowski for reporting violations of the Animal Welfare Act.

Among those it has won are a case for women with AIDS who had been denied disability benefits, and another for special-education students who had not been properly screened. Those days are over. Squeezed by Federal financing cuts and a new law that bars its lawyers from pursuing class-action suits, South Brooklyn Legal Services has lost half of its staff through layoffs and attrition over the last year, and must farm out about 30 pending class-action cases to private lawyers and other organizations. Under the budget passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton in April, legal services agencies nationwide, which are financed with Federal, state and private contributions, are required to dispose of class-action suits by the end of this month. Republican critics in Congress had asserted that Legal Services lawyers filed suits to advance their political agenda rather than serve the poor. Congress also cut Federal financing for the Legal Services Corporation, which distributes money to Legal Services of New York and more than 300 other agencies nationwide, by 30.5 percent, to $278 million from $400 million. Citywide, Legal Services agencies, which represent the poor in civil court, lost 20 percent of their staff members since last year, according to the Legal Services Staff Association. But South Brooklyn -- one of the city's largest with a staff of 50 last year -- has been among the hardest hit, in part because its lawyers have historically clocked dozens of hours each week on class-action suits against city, state and Federal agencies. Fees generated from successful suits accounted for about 10 percent of its annual budget, the agency's director, Chip Gray, said. ""It was a significant part of our work and now it's going to be gone,"" he said. ""It doesn't keep us from representing individual clients. But in terms of protecting the rights of poor people as a group, we are somewhat less capable than we were in the past."" A Fordham University law professor, Matthew Dillard, said the bar on class-action suits had eviscerated the power of Legal Services to challenge government policies and hindered poor people's access to the courts. ""If you can't have class action, lawyers have to work retail, rather than wholesale,"" said Professor Dillard, a former staff lawyer for the Legal Aid Society of New York, which no longer receives Legal Services money. ""The class action was one way of bringing legal services to people so they could be served indirectly, if not directly."" The Federal cuts have rippled across the Legal Services system throughout the city. The Legal Services Corporation was forced to drop out of its 20-year-old case against the city charging racial quotas favoring the Hasidim in public housing in Williamsburg, according to its director, Martin Needelman. He said the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, which had been involved in the case, will take it over. Mr. Needelman said his agency also lost about 10 percent of its staff. Bronx Legal Services handed off more than a dozen class-action suits and lost 10 of its 60 staff members.

us,LONG ISLAND JOURNAL,"How Her Garden Grows IF Eunice Juckett Meeker says, ""Leave it in the mailbox,"" you had better ask which one. Her house in the Village of East Hampton has 3 mailboxes by the front door and one out by the road. But that is just the beginning. The backyard has 52 more mailboxes. Interspersed among flora and fauna are mail holders of every shape and design, including a White House mailbox and a dragon mailbox. They all sit on posts, making it appear as if they sprouted. Mrs. Meeker has created a mailbox garden. It's not that she doesn't trust the postal service. ""It's just that I've always been interested in mailboxes,"" she said. ""I'm writing a book on the human side of mail delivery."" At 81, Mrs. Meeker is writing on many subjects, she said, including traveling. She has been around the world six times. It was on her travels that she started taking pictures of mailboxes. It seemed a logical step to start collecting the boxes, she said. Some that she collected she had created. Others she ordered. And some were sent to her, like the Anheuser-Busch mailbox and the Big Apple mailbox. ""I did so much writing about New York City,"" she said, ""they sent me a big red apple."" She stuck it on top of a mailbox. It's incredible how many items she has transformed into mail holders. Last summer she placed them all in her backyard, making it resemble a miniature golf course. Not that it is rinky dink, but there is that wonder of not knowing what you are going to see around the next bend. Each mailbox has landscaping surrounding it and a path that winds in front of it. Some boxes cause ""Ooohs!"" when first seen, like the fire-engine-red box with a tiny Dalmatian perched on the seat. ""Oh, I have a Dalmatian mailbox, too,"" Mrs. Meeker said, heading down another path. And there was the whole Dalmatian. The head was the mailbox. The post had been expanded into four legs and a body. There are lighthouses, windmills and a covered-wagon mailbox. Then there is the Santa Claus mailbox. ""A man in Massachusetts,"" Mrs. Meeker recalled, ""advertised that he had a Santa in a sleigh that you could put on a mantle. I thought I can put him on a mailbox."" She has animal mailboxes and a stable mailbox, complete with 12 horses. It wasn't easy finding horses the size of a mailbox, she said. Plus there are the people mailboxes, including Uncle Sam and a horseback rider. Those were created by a woman, Mrs. Meeker said, ""who likes to add legs and a person to a mailbox."" Mrs. Meeker allows others to view her garden. ""I had my garden club over last week,"" she said. The public is invited, as well. ""But they must call me first,"" she said. The number is 324-0645.""This is not a commercial venture. This is a big part of my life."" There are mailboxes that her husband, John, created, mailboxes that her yard worker, Miquel Garcia, created, and many that were handcrafted by Peter Reichart of Springs. ""He's a retired woodworker,"" she said. ""I tell him what I want, and he creates it."" The garden has an early variety, a 1903 model, that Mrs. Meeker bought out West. ""Do you know when rural delivery started?"" she asked. ""It was 1896. Do you know where it started? West Virginia."" If there was a mailbox category on ""Jeopardy!"" Mrs. Meeker would sweep it. From other countries come the Bali box and the Irish box, on top of which Mrs. Meeker put a leprechaun inside an overturned Mountain Dew bottle. (Well, it is green.) So many wonderful mailboxes, but none are in use at the road. ""Oh, you wouldn't dare put a good one out there,"" Mrs. Meeker said. In the Hamptons? In the summer? ""It wouldn't last a minute,"" she said.",1996-07-28T05:00:00+0000

Robert Sobieszek, who wrote the essay in the accompanying brochure, likens a new visual esthetic to Jack Kerouac's ""loose and heated literary take on the contemporary American scene of the 1950's.""

us,THEATER;The Bard as a Man of Fewer Words,"AFTER intermission, they do ""Hamlet."" And the 154 sonnets. As daunting as ""Hamlet"" is -- ""really a hard-core play, so many words,"" one of the actors moans -- it's the reason for both the actors and the audience to return to the theater after Act I, during which Shakespeare's other 36 plays are tossed off. Some literally. ""The Compleat Works of Wllm Shkspr (Abridged),"" with text by the Reduced Shakespeare Company, at the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival's Other Stage, clocks in at 90 minutes. That includes time out for taking pratfalls, doing ""aerobic choreography,"" in the director's words, and other digressions, as when an actor playing Claudius accosts a patron on the aisle and threatens to kill her. To what method is such madness assigned? Ask James Michael Reilly, one of the company's three actors; Joe Discher, the director, or Bonnie J. Monte, the festival's artistic director, and you'll get answers stuffed with sanity and logic. ""To send up the sacred and the familiar -- the English say 'to cock a snook,' which means to thumb your nose -- provides a necessary release,"" Mr. Reilly said. Ms. Monte declared: ""One of the missions of our Other Stage is to reinvent classical texts, and to present derivatives of Shakespeare in order to show how the modern world is riffing on them. And it's an important audience-building tool -- to entice people to come to the classics on our main stage through an indirect route. Some people say Shakespeare is frightening. This is a great way to start. When I first saw this piece, I laughed till my make-up came off. Maybe this will get people to try one of the comedies."" Mr. Discher added: ""It gives people exposure to the plays they might not otherwise get. And it opens their hearts to Shakespeare. But it can't be all about silly physical gags. It can't be joke, joke, joke, joke. For me, it's about exploring the language and finding the humor that can come out of it, which knocks down the staid museum-piece approach to Shakespeare. ""The set with an upper and lower deck looks traditional, like you're coming to see something highfalutin at the Globe."" Kings. Queens. Witches. The three actors are outnumbered by their backstage dressers (four). ""It's written so that it can barely be done,"" Mr. Reilly said. ""We sometimes change costumes after eight words,"" he added, although tights, knee pads and footwear -- ""your basic white Converse high tops"" -- remain constant. But not the roller skates. To Mr. Reilly goes ""all the girl stuff,"" he said: Gertrude, Ophelia, Lavinia. ""And more wigs than the others,"" not to mention overuse of falsetto. Such specialization enables Mr. Reilly to articulate ""the pattern of response"" of Shakespeare's heroines to imminent death: ""they throw up,"" he said, citing Juliet's reaction to poison and Ophelia's to madness. And what else is Cleopatra to do after uttering the line, ""Is this an asp I see before me?"" ""It's all a little grossed out and hysterical."" As for ""Hamlet,"" the segment lasts 20 minutes, only to be followed by a speedier version (one minute 20 seconds) and then one that runs backwards (one minute 30 seconds). Sample: ""Melt would flesh solid too too this that O."" From what source, a student of theater is sure to wonder, comes the training required for actors to take on the concept of reduced Shakespeare? Mr. Reilly mused upon the question. ""It draws on a lot of skills we all developed in the third grade,"" the actor answered.",1996-07-28T05:00:00+0000

There is a story here, but, as Mr. Lax writes in PAUL NEWMAN: A Biography (Turner, $29.95), ""He has always been guarded about his personal life, especially his marriages."" Mr. Lax sums up at one point, ""We are left to our private wonder."" He also quotes Mr. Newman on his problems with alcohol: ""I don't know why those times should be for public consumption."" We don't need to be dragged through the mud with Mr. Newman, who seems to be an extraordinarily decent man; however, it would have been helpful to try going behind those baby blues to reach into the soul instead of simply sliding over the surface. But, oh, these pictures are divine! There's Paul, on the cover, as the title character in ""Hud"": sexy. And there's Paul in his 20's, whose face, as Mr. Lax describes it, ""was something from an ancient coin."" And Paul at 71, who ""has aged gracefully, and now his face has the finely etched look of someone on a postage stamp."" Coins, stamps, whatever.
