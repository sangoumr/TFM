us,Cinematic Chautauqua Circuit,"THE first motion picture I ever saw on a university campus was Potemkin. This was a quarter of a century ago, when I was an undergraduate at Princeton, and the history department had acquired a print which was projected on an institutional green wall in a tiny classroom before an audience seven people. The last picture I saw on a college campus, a year ago, was Singin in the Rain. The auditorium was filled with several hundred film majors, the equipment was in mint condition (there was eventalk of installing Dolby sound) and after the showing there was a panel discussion (for reasons that escape me, I was a panelist) on whether Gene Kelly or Stanley Donen was the true auteur of Singin in the Rain. (I can recall myself saying that there was merit on both sides.) The students were duly tested on their conclusions. I point this out to indicate that film scholarship has become a flourishing surrogate for a liberal arts education. The film department has in fact become academe in the 1970's what the psychology department was in the 50's  a way to legitimize trendy mediocrity with a bachelor's degree. Students illequipped for either the Job market or a rigorous baccalaureate can put themselves on hold for four years, preparing themselves for a lifetime in the dark. They graduate burdened with only one idea, namely JeanLuc Godard's claptrap notion that film is truth at 24frames a second.",1979-04-01T05:00:00+0000

Pennebaker's ""Town Bloody Hall,"" his cinma vrit recording of an all-star ""Dialogue on Women's Liberation,"" at Town Hall on April 30,1971, opens today at the Whitney Museum of American Art. No one who participated in the event, or who is a close friend of someone who participated in it, or who just likes a bang-up show of ideas that often get muddled with personalities, will want to miss this movie. Or put it this way: When was the last time you saw Norman Mailer in the ring with his gloves on?Mr. Mailer, the moderator, meets and takes on with good humor the panel members (Germaine Greer, Diana Trilling, Jacqueline Ceballos and Jill Johnston) and members of the audience, some prominent in their fields, such as Elizabeth Hardwicke, Susan Sontag and Betty Friedan (all of whom keep their heads), and others who don't keep their heads and look extremely foolish.Much of what is said at the symposium, one of a series of events produced for the Theater of Ideas, is still relevant, which also says something about the march of women's liberation (it's slow) and a lot of it is just fooling around, as when Jill Johnston starts fooling around on stage with a couple of her admirers.As a movie, ""Town Bloody Hall"" reflects some of the chaos the discussion keeps threatening to fall into, but Mr. Pennebaker, one of our best documentary film makers, and Chris Negedus, his associate and the editor of the film, succeed in capturing a great deal of the live presence of the occasion.

us,Film: Zeffirelli's 'The Champ':A Return Match,"EVEN when it was first made in 1931, with Wallace Beery as the punch-drunk ex-prizefighter and Jackie Cooper as his plucky 7-year-old son, King Vidor's ""The Champ"" posed problems for the critics, if not for millions of moviegoers. Mordaunt Hall, The New York Times critic of that day, praised the performers while suggesting that the story was a tiny bit sentimental, maybe even simple-minded, for the sophisticated 30's. It might have served in the silent days, Mr. Hall said from the vantage point of the dawn of the talkies.Pretty much the same thing can be said about Franco Zeffirelli's multimillion-dollar updated remake, with Jon Voight as the boxer, Ricky Schroder as his little boy and Faye Dunaway as the former wife and mother who left her family years before to become rich, beautiful, intelligent and famous  the role played by Irene Rich in the original.However, there's not much use in bemoaning the movie's frontal assault on the emotions. Mr. Zeffirelli never aspired to subtlety. To criticize ""The Champ"" for a lack of sophistication is not to see the film itself. The most offputting thing about such canny, tear-stained movies as ""The Champ"" is not their navet but their unholy sophistication. These movies don't mean to deal with the world as it really is, but as it should be, a place where there's no pile-up of emotional garbage too big that it can't be washed clean by a good cry. My problem with ""The Champ"" is that I didn't cry. The garbage accumulated.Walter Newman's modernized screenplay, based on the original story by Frances Marion, is set in Miami, where the Champ and his son, T.J., eke out a cheerfully aimless living at the racetrack, exercising horses. It has been only seven or eight years since the Champ actually was the world's heavyweight champion, but his fall has been so rapid and complete that he apparently can't even get jobs selling sparkplugs on television. When Annie, now happily married to a remarkably understanding gerontologist (Arthur Hill), re-enters the Champ's life and asks for visitation rights, the Champ decides to go back into the ring, which is clearly the wrong thing for a fellow to do if he is an ex-fighter who has headaches.Mr. Voight looks very fit to be the boozing character he's supposed to be. Though it is convincing, his Lower East Side accent, which seems to have been borrowed from Rocky Graziano, has the effect of making his earlier liaison with Miss Dunaway seem highly improbable. Also improbable is the small boy, cleverly impersonated by Mr. Schroder, who has appeared in television commercials. The performance is surprising in the smoothness of its mechanics without being either comic or endearing, as was Tatum O'Neal in ""Paper Moon.""Miss Dunaway? Most of the time she looks like someone who was en route to Acapulco and was stranded in Newark. At one point, she emcees a fashion show for no good reason except to give her something to do with her fine stature and velvet voice. Late in the film, when she breaks the news of her momhood to the little boy, both he and we feel uncomfortable. The scene is  well  sexy.""The Champ,"" which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, is Mr. Zeffirelli's first made-in-America film, though both his ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Brother Son, Sister Moon"" were in English. He doesn't play down to the material or understate it. Instead he exalts it. People don't cry in this film, they erupt. Mr. Zeffirelli orchestrates it as if it were ""Tosca."" The photography is fancily romantic and often sort of pink, like the flamingos at Hialeah, and the music (by Dave Grusin) is so lush it seems to use up all the oxygen. Like too much cologne, it makes breathing difficult.""The Champ,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some vulgar language.",1979-04-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 13 Directors Make 'Germany in Autumn':After the Fall,"""GERMANY in Autumn,"" which opens this evening at the Film Forum, is the collective work of 13 German directors and writers who attempt to assess the political state of that country in the autumn of 1977, when Hans-Martin Schleyer, the German industrialist was kidnapped and murdered by terrorists, followed almost immediately by the mysterious deaths in the maximum-security Stuttgart-Stammheim prison of three members of the notorious Baader-Meinhof gang. The state's assertion that the three were suicides was widely ridiculed.Like most joint film efforts of this sort, ""Germany in Autumn,"" a two-hour documentary, is very uneven. It's sometimes startlingly beautiful, often obscure and confusing, sometimes funny and mostly disturbing, as it should be. The film's credits do not identify the authors of individual sequences, though the contribution of Rainer Werner Fassbinder is obvious (he stars in it), as is that of the novelist Heinrich Bll, who wrote a broadly satiric sketch about some television executives who finally decide not to televise Sophocles's ""Antigone"" because it's ""too topical."" Among the other contributors are Alexander Kluge and Volker Schlondorff.The film is framed by interments. It opens with the state funeral of Mr. Schleyer and closes with the funerals of the three terrorists, buried in a Stuttgart cemetery with the permission of that city's Mayor, whose father, General Field Marshal Rommel, was himself given an elaborate state funeral by the Nazis after they had forced him to commit suicide.""Germany in Autumn"" embraces such ironies, freely associating between segments of fact and fiction as it considers the legacy of the country's fascist past and the meaning of its democratic present. Illuminating even the most oblique episodes is a concern with the terrorism that has become the policy of dissent for the ultra-left-wing. Horst Mahler, a former lawyer for the radical opposition, now serving a 14-year prison term, speaks eloquently about the roots of postwar radicalism, though he now disavows terrorism that, he says, has become no different from the ills that prompted the left's original frustration and dissent.Very often the film is beyond the reach of someone not up on contemporary German affairs. It's a movie that needs even more program notes than the extensive ones already provided by the Film Forum. I'd like to have heard more than a snippet of a speech given to a convention of Social Democrats by Max Frisch, in which the Swiss playwright (""The Firebugs"") urges Germans to provide the young with some goal other than ""cheerful consumerism."" A couple of fictional segments intended to satirize the fears and obsessions of the bourgeoisie are simply opaque.Far from opaque is Mr. Fassbinder's aggressively stylish segment, in which Mr. Fassbinders a romantic projection of himself, a radical young film director who finds Germany's middle-class complacency too painful to bear. He rails at his monumentally patient male lover, who supports the state position on terrorism, and bullies his mother until she finally admits (as if to shut him up) that life was in some ways better under a dictatorship. The fictional Rainer drinks like Edgar Allen Poe, takes drugs, cries and films himself in the middle of the night talking distractedly on the telephone, nude.The segment is the most interesting part of the film. It's typically, intentionally disorienting in the Fassbinder way, photographed and acted with such intense self-absorption that it has the effect of transforming narcissism into a higher form of political commitment.""Germany in Autumn"" will be shown at the Film Forum at 7:45 tonight through Sunday and repeated there next week at the same time Thursday through Sunday.",1979-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:Truffaut's Antoine Doinel Looks Back on a Life in Films:Prodigal Returns,"FRANCOIS TRUFFAUT'S ""Love on the Run,"" which opens today at the Coronet, is the fifth film and, Mr. Truffaut says, the last in his extraordinary Antoine Doinel series that began 20 years ago with ""The 400 Blows."" Mr. Truffaut said the same thing in 1971 when ""Bed and Board,"" the fourth Doinel film, was released, but this time there's good reason to believe him. There's no place left to go for either Antoine, still played by Jean-Pierre Laud, or for Mr. Truffaut, who has here made a movie that spells a more absolute end than death for a favorite character. The film is also an examination of principles  a unique essay on the methods and purposes of romantic comedy.We've all seen actors over the years deal with age on the screen, some, with the aid of surgery, becoming miraculously more youthful looking while all around them disintegrated. Yet never before have we had the same director, the same actor and the same character evolve, more or less naturally, over such an extended period of time.After ""The 400 Blows,"" which introduced Antoine as the 13-year-old juvenile delinquent, there were the ""Colette"" sequence from ""Love at 20"" (1963), in which Antoine courted the spirited Marie-France Pisier but won only the affection of her parents; ""Stolen Kisses"" (1969), in which Antoine, discharged without honor from the army, pursued the music student, Christine (Claude Jade); and ""Bed and Board"" (1971), in which the marriage of Antoine and Christine fell apart as the self-interested Antoine sought a literary career and extra-marital affairs.""Love on the Run"" picks up Antoine and Christine on the morning that their no-contest divorce becomes final. Neither Antoine nor Christine is especially upset by this development. Christine has learned to live without Antoine and Antoine is busily involved in a new affair with Sabine, a pretty, bright young woman played by Dorothee, a new actress who looks a lot like the younger Claude Jade and like Catherine Deneuve, who has also figured in Mr. Truffaut's career.That same evening Antoine runs into Colette, again played by Marie-France Pisier, who is now a lawyer and still a woman with a mind of her own, which is to say that she has Antoine's number. By one of those coincidences that tie such comedies together, Colette's lover, a librarian, turns out to be the brother of Antoine's Sabine, which leads to a certain amount of misunderstanding of no real importance.You should be told here, however, that there's very little in the way of conventional story to ""Love on the Run,"" whose screenplay is jointly credited to Mr. Truffaut, Miss Pisier, Jean Aurel and Suzanne Schiffman.It is, instead, a series of sequences in which everyone takes stock  the now serenely self-aware Christine, the beautiful, sensitive, funny Colette, as well as the perplexed Antoine. They take stock in great swatches of flashbacks lifted from ""The 400 Blows"" (black-and-white), ""Colette"" (sepia), and ""Stolen Kisses"" and ""Bed and Board"" (both in color).This method is initially disturbing. If you know the films well as I do  it seems that Mr. Truffaut has ransacked his own archives in the manner of the television vultures who put together omnibus features with titles such as ""The Hollywood Sirens"" or ""The Silver Age of the Golden Screen."" The bits and pieces  like Antoine's interview with the psychiatrist from ""400 Blows""  are too good to be used in this fashion. The new context doesn't do them justice. It also appears to be lazy movie making.Then, too, I wonder if people who do not know the earlier films will make any sense at all of ""Love on the Run."" It's rather like opening a new book and skipping immediately to the epilogue.But if you admire Mr. Truffaut. I urge you to stay with ""Love on the Run,"" which is this brilliantly, comically authoritative French director's analysis of his own work. I don't think any other film maker of his stature has ever attempted such a thing, certainly not in public with a feature film.While Antoine, Christine and Colette relive their earlier entanglements, Mr. Truffaut makes it clear that his identification with Antoine/Laud has grown from one based on concern, fondness and superficial likenesses to one having to do with a philosophy of life and art. Antoine's stories  the ones he acts out in these films as well as the ones he wants to write as a novelist  are so totally concerned with the processes and emotions of falling in love that he's continually surprised when the affairs are suddenly over.Whether by design or accident, the Antoine films have always taken a dim view of those romantic comedies that insist that the stereotypical boy and girl, having met, lost each other and met again, will live happily ever after. In the past Mr. Truffaut has shied away from such unequivocal cheeriness.In ""Love on the Run"" he is expressing doubts. At one point the pragmatic Sabine says to Antoine with a good deal of patience, ""Why impose despair on everyone else while you go around enjoying life?""Mr. Truffaut ends ""Love on the Run"" in the only optimistic way he will permit himself. When Sabine and Antoine decide to stay together, they acknowledge that the decision may be a mistake and that it may end badly, but they agree to pretend that it's forever. For Mr. Truffaut to pretend is a major commitment.I hope this analysis doesn't make ""Love on the Run"" seem tediously schematic. Once you get its rhythm it is great fun  full of the wit, the humanity and the kind of mysterious references that separate Truffaut comedies from those of all other directors. It also offers a ravishing performance by Marie-France Pisier and very charming ones by Claude Jade and Dorothee.Mr. Laud is something else. He's exactly right but it's impossible now to identify the actor apart from the role. Seeing him as an obsessively selfish, unfeeling adult is a disappointment. He isn't as interesting or appealing as he used to be. As do some childhood friends, Antoine Doinel has grown away from us.""Love on the Run,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), includes some mildly erotic sexual sequences.",1979-04-06T05:00:00+0000

As a sideline, Cropsey reverted to architecture by designing the stairways, platforms and waiting rooms for the Sixth Avenue El.

At least ""Quintet"" could be construed as a fluke: even if ""3 Women"" was nearly this pretentious, it was also  like ""Images,"" Mr. Altman's only successful foray into anything murky  resplendently lovely. ""Quintet,"" on the other hand, looked every bit as awful as it sounded.But both ""A Wedding"" and ""A Perfect Couple"" are watered-down reminders of the director's better work  so characteristic, and yet so dim. And they raise not only the question of what's gone wrong lately, but also that of how everything in ""Nashville"" went so right. If Mr. Altman keeps on operating at such a small fraction of his powers, his masterworks may begin to look more and more like happy accidents.""A Perfect Couple,"" which opens today at the Beekman, Paramount, Gramercy and other theaters, started out as Mr. Altman's attempt  along with his co-screenwriter, the actor Allan Nicholls  to write a love story that would feature Paul Dooley and Marta Heflin, whose performances in ""A Wedding"" he had very much liked. (Mr. Dooley played Snooks, the bride's father; Miss Heflin had a smaller role as a nervous bridesmaid.) Then it turned out that Mr. Nicholls had a rock group, a bunch of actor-singers called ""Keepin' 'Em Off the Streets,"" and quicker than you could say ""Marriage of Convenience"" the rock group had become integral to the plot. Miss Heflin had once been a member of a large communal rock group herself, so art imitated life as the screenwriters turned her into a singer who lived and worked with the band.The lovers are supposed to be opposites, so Mr. Dooley is cast as a member of a wealthy Greek family, living with a large troupe of relatives in a hilltop castle, somewhat gothic but equipped with an electric garage door opener. (Miss Heflin and the band have been given a loft in downtown Los Angeles to call home.) The lovers are supposed to be essentially similar, too, so each is shown to be tyrannized by a father figure  he by a Greek patriarch, she by the band's lead singer. Life is supposed to be tough but funny in these modern times, so they meet through a computer dating service alter sizing up one another via videocassette.So far, so-so. Mr. Altman renders the story gently, with his camera slowly panning toward things or slowly panning away, and with a number of familiar comic twists; the best scenes in ""A Perfect Couple"" recall even better scenes in other Altman movies. Mr. Dooley is most endearing, and so are the crazy relatives who have him hamstrung. Miss Heflin is less successful, partly because of a built-in problem with the script, which makes the businessman older and more aggressive, the singer very timid and shy. Shy she may be, but in that case what is she doing in a loft where no one has any privacy, everyone is inexhaustibly convivial, and the atmosphere is Flower Power with a vengeance? The glum, inexpressive Miss Heflin makes it very hard to believe that the heroine has anything to do with this band.Keepin' 'Em Off the Streets has an elaborate act, featuring members wandering around the stage when they aren't singing, a woman who sits rocking her baby as she listens to the music, and a dog who perches beside a fire hydrant prop. The singers include a number of people once connected with ""Hair"" plus Ted Neeley, who had the title role in ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" and they perform tuneful, very Californian songs with lyrics that are often furiously silly (""Pity the poor millionaire/Who's never sure if people care"").Mr. Neeley, the lead singer, sounds enough like John Fogerty (late of Creedence Clearwater Revival) to make up for his irritating offstage manner, and the group harmonizes nicely; they're at least interesting enough to carry three or four lengthy musical numbers. The film includes 11. By the time it's over, the thing you may wish most fervently about Keepin' 'Em Off The Streets is that Mr. Altman hadn't decided to.When it isn't bending over backward to accommodate the songs, the film has some sweet, funny moments. There's a very amusing episode about Mr. Dooley's date with an oversexed veterinarian (Ann Ryerson), and a first-blush-of-love scene that includes Mr. Dooley, Miss Heflin, and the doctor who's sewing up the part of Mr. Dooley's head that Miss Heflin has just dented with a fireplace poker. Some of the incidental performances are very good, especially that of Belita Moreno, as Mr. Dooley's sickly sister (she also played the groom's twin in ""A Wedding"").There is also a running gag about another couple that flattens out long before it's over. And the ending hinges on a cheap, morbid trick, just as the end of ""A Wedding"" did. If Mr. Altman is going to rework pieces of his own work, there are better bits he could have borrowed.""A Perfect Couple"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It includes one love scene, no violence, and a few mild mentions of homosexuality.",1979-04-06T05:00:00+0000

us,The New York Times/Robert Levin,"O Nplans of some of the great English country houses, there was often a room marked flowers, where cut flowers from the garden were arranged and set in vases. These days, shrinking city apartments and efficiently planned houses don't have rooms set aside for such activities. Florists usually do the flower arranging, and often the vase is tossed out with the faded flowers. Despite all this, a variety of oversized vases are proliferating in shops across the city. One explanation is that even flowers have their fashions. We are in the era of the big bloom. The neighborhood florist is selling branches of forsythia, quince and dogwood, and the single, albeit expensive, longstemmed flower is making a comeback. The bigger, the better, said a Manhattan retailer who can't keep the oversized containers in stock. It used to be difficult to get a vase that would have the right proportion to hold a fivefoot branch, added Christian Barclay, who opened his own flower shop last October. Now, people don't have to cut the branches down. But what does one do with these giant vases when they are flowerless? Small closets or narrow cabinets can hardly accommodate them. That's part of the point, explained Robert Fleischer of The Glass Store. These vases are large enough to make a statement; even empty, they can sit on the floor or the piano. And, as one architect remarked: If it's big enough, you can't accuse it of being a tsatske.",1979-04-12T05:00:00+0000

One day, Mr. Wyse planned to have some friends over for dinner but didn't have enough chairs. He remembered that in 1959, when his sister had gotten married in Cleveland (his hometown), she had chairs with slipcovers at her reception. Why can't I find those in New York, he wondered. He called every party rental company he knew of, but the search was futile. Thus began what Mr. Wyse calls my fiveminute idea; my lunchhour business, now known as Turnerwyse Incoporated. Mr. Wyse and Mr. Turner decided to produce the kind of slipcovers Mr. Wyse remembered. The partners divided the tasks: Mr. Wyse shopped around town to find the folding wooden chairs they would need. He settled on a classic type, called the Circus chair  similar to those used in traveling circuses. Mr. Turner worked on designing the slipcover. They both agreed that white canvas would have a universal applicability; it is just like the material used for circus big tops. They also agreed that quilting the fabric would make it more comfortable to sit on. Finally, they hired a lawyer, found a fabricator, and worked out the final design. The channelquilted slipcovers are made in 9ounce, offwhite, 100 percent cotton duck with a polyester lining. Mr. Wyse is especially proud that both chair and cover are entirely made in the United States. At BaileyHuebner at Henri Bendel, chair and chair cover come packaged together and cost $70; at Blooming. dale's, it's $67.50.

I hope the hotel runs better than the movie.""Hurricane"" is wet and windy, the sort of expensively foolish enterprise that suggests that everyone connected with it needs either a new agent or a legal guardian. It enhances the reputation of no one and discovers unexpected deposits of second-rateness in such people as Lorenzo Semple Jr., who wrote the screenplay; Jan Troell, the Swedish director of ""The Emigrants""; Sam O'Steen, the editor, who has saved far worse movies than this; Sven Nykvist, the cameraman, and such cast members as Jason Robards, Mia Farrow, Max Von Sydow, Trevor Howard and Timothy Bottoms. A Hawaiian surfer named Dayton Ka'ne makes his debut in the film, as a young Polynesian chieftain who falls in love with a white woman, played by Miss Farrow. Mr. Ka'ne doesn't act, but he does look like John Travolta, beefed up with a bodybuilding course.The film is based on the same Charles Nordhoff-James Norman Hall novel that served as the basis for the 1937 Sam Goldwyn-John Ford film starring Dorothy Lamour and Jon Hall.Mr. Semple has set his adaptation in the 1920's and updated the tale by making it an interracial love story with hilariously clumsy subsidiary suggestions of an incestuous relationship between Miss Farrow and her father, the United States Naval Governor of Pago Pago, played by Mr. Robards. The scenery is pretty, but the geography mystifying. This is the sort of South Pacific where it takes a powerboat one day to get to a nearby island and a rowboat, through a raging storm, a few hours to reach the same destination.The love affair between the governor's daughter and the island chief is communicated visually in terms of the meetings of eyes and in dialogue about eyes. There is so much emphasis on eyes that when Miss Farrow picks up a seashell you expect her to stare into it, but no, she puts it to her ear. Some clichs are sacred.The island dances are sexy in the manner of nightclub choreography, and the climactic storm is very noisy. What one remembers most vividly, though, are not the dances and the special effects, but the way Miss Farrow walks  slightly stiff-kneed, like a Broadway ingenue of the 30's  the fact that one character succumbs in the hurricane to what seems to have been a bad earache, and the dialogue, which sometimes sounds as if it had been written by someone under the unfortunate influence of Ben Jonson. Says the island chief to Miss Farrow, when he suggests that they elope, ""Come to the altar with the white flower  I will be there with the red.""""Hurricane,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some partial nudity.",1979-04-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Crime Fighting In the Disney Style:Crusading Minister,"THE new Walt Disney comedy, ""The North Avenue Irregulars,"" that opens today at Loew's 83d Street and other theaters, is about an energetic young Presbyterian minister who mobilizes the women of his parish to fight organized crime in his small, otherwise ideal community.His unlikely mob includes Barbara Harris, as one of those suburban mothers whose station wagon is always stuffed with children who are late getting somewhere else; Cloris Leachman, as a divorce with time on her hands and spectacularly long finger-nails, and Patsy Kelly as a housewife who lives on a thin edge between fury and despair. They make do-gooding a cheerful, predictably risky adventure.Edward Herrmann, who was seen as Franklin D. Roosevelt in television's two ""Eleanor and Franklin"" shows, plays the minister with the sort of earnest near-sightedness that requires him to wear glasses and frequently look aghast. Don Tait wrote the screenplay, which is based loosely on the real-life story of the Rev. Albert Fay Hill, of New Rochelle, as recorded in his book.The film is the first theatrical feature to be directed by Bruce Bilson, who has completly absorbed the Disney style. ""The North Avenue Irregulars"" transforms energy into optimism and ends with an automobile chase and pileup that is as exhilarating as a demolition derby.""The North Avenue Irregulars,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains a discreetly violent scene in which a Presbyterian church is fire-bombed.",1979-04-13T05:00:00+0000

So a sale next Friday at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. at Sotheby Parke Bernet, Madison Avenue at 76th Street, is bound to stir more excitement than usual. The occasion, billed as one of the finest sales of American art in many years and the most important auction of its kind not from a single owner, offers a previously unknown work by William Harnett, the 19thcentury trompe l'oeil artist, who fooled the eye with great skill, and a recordbreaking Eastman Johnson oil, Washington Crossing the Delaware. The Harnett novelty, Still Life With Violin, is dated 1885 and was painted in Paris, where it was purchased in the late 1800's by Charles James Hook, father of the consignor. The oil painting on panel is a tightly conceived, far more detailed gem of this genre than two other Harnett still lifes in the sale. In addition, the presale estimate of $100,000 to $150,000 reflects both the $100,000 to $150,000 reflects both the work's importance and the fact that it was previously unrecorded.

Mr. Hamilton's knack for comedy has been a well-kept secret until now, but he's certainly funny in ""Love at First Bite,"" a coarse, delightful little movie with a bang-up cast and no pretensions at all. ""Love at First Bite"" opens today at the National, Loew's Cine and other theaters.Poor Dracula! As the story begins, he is forced to leave his Transylvanian home. The Rumanian government has designated his castle a training center for young gymnasts, and a delegation warns that ""In 48 hours we'll be back with trampolines, parallel bars, swings and Nadia Comaneci. Don't be here."" So off he goes to New York, accompanied by his small, faithful servant, played by Arte Johnson. They take up residence at the Plaza Hotel, where Dracula sleeps in his coffin by day and his servant  who feeds on live insects  glumly watches Raid commercials on television.The premise of Robert Kaufman's screenplay, which contains both good jokes and awful jokes but is never slow, is that New York has gotten jaded since Dracula was last heard from. He doesn't scare anybody any more  except for one man, who sees the vampire in his bat incarnation and is reminded of his first wife. But Dracula isn't interested in frightening people this time, partly because Mr. Hamilton is so caught up in the fashion-plate aspect of the role and partly because he's supposed to be in love, with a Very Famous Model (played by Susan St. James). She likes him because he's kinky. At this model's apartment, about which she casually remarks ""I hate housework, it killed my mother,"" the refrigerator contains champagne, two dead gardenias and a kitten.Complications ensue, since the model already has a boyfriend, who also happens to be her psychiatrist. Played hilariously by Richard Benjamin, the psychiatrist embarks upon a one-man campaign to warn New York that a vampire is haunting its discos and hot spots. New York is not impressed.Stan Dragoti, previously an advertising executive, directs with a lot of bluster. The timing between sequences is occasionally shaky, though, and it's too bad the concluding car chase, which is supposed to take place in New York, was so evidently filmed in California. Sometimes tackiness works to the film's advantage, however. If you're going to show a bat on screen, it might as well be a silly-looking stuffed bat suspended from obvious wires.Some of the film's ethnic jokes skate by on very thin ice. They seem witless rather than mean-spirited, but that's not much of an excuse.""Love At First Bite"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains a few humorous sexual references and some comically colorful language, mostly from the model played by Miss Saint James.",1979-04-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Wilder's Movie 'Fedora' Opens:The Cast,"Billy Wilder's ""Fedora"" is a fabulous relic, a grand old villa fallen slightly into disrepair. And if it seems outmoded, well, that is very much Mr. Wilder's intention. ""Fedora"" is old-fashioned with a vengeance, a proud, passionate remembrance of the way movies used to be, and a bitter smile at what they have become.It is rich, majestic, very close to ridiculous, and also a little bit mad. It seems exactly what Mr. Wilder wants it to be, perfectly self-contained and filled with the echoes of a lifetime; no one could mistake this for the work of a young man. Indeed, it has the resonance of an epitaph. That, too, seems a part of Mr. Wilder's design.""Fedora"" opens today at Cinema Studio, where it is liable to have a very short run. Preview audiences have been laughing in the wrong places  understandable, perhaps, in light of the plot's outlandishness. A woman throws herself in front of a train in the first scene, and we learn that she was Fedora, a great foreign-born movie queen who has long been in seclusion. Then we see Fedora's body lying in state, as weeping fans file through her mansion in Paris. One of the mourners is Dutch Detweiler, played by William Holden. Mr. Holden narrates ""Fedora"" just as he narrated ""Sunset Boulevard,"" the Wilder film that ""Fedora"" most eloquently recalls.The film flashes back to Corfu, where Dutch visited Fedora two weeks earlier. He had known her 30 years before, when he was an assistant director and she was a great star; they even had a one-night romance, which she no longer seems to remember. Now he's down on his luck in Hollywood, and hoping he can interest her in his script, a new version of ""Anna Karenina."" But Fedora isn't available for a comeback; she's a virtual prisoner in a waterfront retreat. Her captors are an aged Polish countess (Hildegarde Knef), an unsympathetic servant (Frances Sternhagen) and the doctor (Jos Ferrer) responsible for the treatments that keep the actress looking so amazingly, unbelievably young.Midway through the story, a bizarre secret about Fedora is revealed, and it's a lulu. The rest of the film is devoted to denouement, and this is no mere case of ""The butler did it."" No, this is where the screenplay, by Mr. Wilder and his long-time collaborator, I. A. L. Diamond (from a story by Thomas Tryon), goes wild, piling twist upon incredible twist with a giddy bravado, until even the overstatement becomes exhilarating. It's impossible to describe this part of the film without betraying Fedora's mystery. But the loose ends tie up into a coherent picture, a Hollywood reckoning of the price of art, the sacrifice worth making for the sake of a grand illusion.Marthe Keller, in the highly demanding leading role, is particularly resourceful, and Mr. Ferrer reads his lines with a witty understanding of the screenplay's intentional corniness (""To pump out the stomach, that is easy. The mind, that is another thing""). Michael York appears, playing himself, the actor Fedora hardly knows but has fallen hopelessly in love with. (This perhaps provides some indication of how improbable things become.) Henry Fonda arrives to present Fedora with an Oscar, in his supposed capacity as president of the academy, and to tell her how much he always envied Fredric March, Charles Boyer, Ronald Colman and all of her other costars.""Fedora"" is full of references to Hollywood personages, not just for the sake of bitchiness but for purposes of scale. It ranges from California to Greece, from Dutch and Fedora's golden youth (the young Dutch is played by Stephen Collins, who imitates Mr. Holden to a T) to times less full of promise, as it demonstrates the kind of scope we don't readily see from ""the kids with the beards,"" as Dutch describes Hollywood's new generation. The compactness and symmetry evident in ""Fedora"" aren't easily achieved these days without a good deal of self-consciousness. Mr. Wilder achieves them naturally.""Fedora"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It includes one brief incidence of partial nudity.",1979-04-15T05:00:00+0000

Nevertheless, prodded with the praise of a flabby interviewer named Laurens Straub, Mr. Herzog then goes on to talk at length about his work in ""I Am My Films,"" the documentary that opens today at the Film Forum.""I Am My Films"" is not a great example of a film as an exploration of character, but it is an intelligent trailer for the Herzog filmography that includes such peculiarly brilliant and memorable films as ""Even Dwarfs Started Small,"" ""Fata Morgana,"" ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God,"" ""Kasper Hauser"" and ""Stroszek."" It says something about the effectiveness of ""I Am My Films"" that, at the end of it, I came out of the theater wishing to see again ""Fata Morgana,"" Mr. Herzog's feature-length, more or less abstract film shot in the Sahara, about life, death and the impermanence of all things. When I first saw ""Fata Morgana"" some years ago at the New York Film Festival, I thought I was losing my mind.The style of ""I Am My Films"" is self-conscious, shy and arrogant. Mr. Straub is the sort of interviewer who asks his subject what the subject would like to talk about and then doesn't listen to the answer, and Mr. Herzog is the sort of subject who keeps saying he doesn't want to talk about superficial things but is at his most interesting when he wanders off the great weighty subjects and remembers anecdotes. These include a story about the time he was 3 and met God (It was Christmas Day and God wore a brown suit and worked for the Electric Company), and a series of funny, hair-raising stories about Klaus Kinski and the shooting of ""Aguirre"" in the mountains and jungles of Peru.With Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Mr. Herzog is one of the two most exciting things to have happened in German films since World War II. Each of his films is an original. Though profoundly German and very much of his generation (he was born in 1942), he works outside of Germany more often than in it. He is fascinated by the unusual and exotic, whether it's an extraordinary talent, a dangerous obsession or a physical deformity or handicap. He calls psychiatry ""the helplessness of our age,"" yet many of the images in his films are as dependent on Freud as they are on Edison.The best things about ""I Am My Films"" are the extensive clips from the director's work. These say more about the Herzog method than all of the hemming and hawing in the interviews. Two clips, especially, remain in the mind. The first, taken from ""The Great Ecstasy of the Sculptor Steiner,"" is a slow-motion sequence showing Mr. Steiner making a record-breaking ski jump, which manages to define the ecstasy of very dangerous sport. In the second clip, from ""Land of Silence and Darkness,"" the camera gives us a close-up of an old woman staring delightedly out the window while she's on her first airplane ride. The old woman is deaf and blind.""I Am My Films"" will be shown at the Film Forum tonight through Sunday at 7:45 and next week. Thursday through Sunday, at the same hour.",1979-04-19T05:00:00+0000

I'm not sure that it is thus more honest, only that it is more inclined to worry.I also suspect that because Mr. Steven knows that small towns like Carlton are very easy to make fun of, he has made his film with care and given it characters he would like to respect, despite their short-sighted attempts to harness progress. He's also asembled a cast of excellent actors, particularly Ken Blackburn as the head of the local booster club and Grant Tilly as a hen-pecked husband for whom the easy-going Sandra Gray represents his wickedest dreams come true. Best of all is Miss Cooper, who has the look and manner of a woman who has been through everything once, at a very early age, and is not about to suffer twice. It's a secure, intelligent performance, strong without a bit of toughness. Like the New Zealand countryside in which the film is set, the character is both beautiful and utterly lonely.Also on the bill with ""Skin Deep"" is a 25-minute animated film from England, ""Animation for Live Action"" by Vera Neubauer. It's an extremely glum look at a film maker who is a woman and liberated. She sees herself being chopped up, ground up, decapitated and generally abused in other ways, all of which (as I read the images) is to be tolerated because of a liberated woman's Love of Film.",1979-04-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Idlers' of Greece:Dolce Far Niente,"A SELF-SATISFIED, benignly uninteresting, middle-aged widower and his three grown sons inherit a lovely country house from their brother/uncle and promptly move there from the city. With Sofia, the young housekeeper they've also inherited, the family settles down for what at first seems simply a life of great ease. They enjoy huge, cheerful, wine-filled lunches, after which they nap, take tea in the garden, nap again and dine at nightfall.So begins ""Idlers of the Fertile Valley,"" the Greek film directed by Nikos Panayotopoulos that will be shown at the Museum of Modern Art tonight at 9 and again on Sunday at 6 P.M. in the New Directors/New Films series sponsored by the Museum and the Film Society of Lincoln Center.""Idlers of the Fertile Valley"" is, I'm afraid, an allegory about the decadence of the bourgeoisie and like many allegories, its charm wears thin once the system of equivalents becomes apparent. Yet Mr. Panayotopoulos is a talented film maker and often a witty one. He is also far more gentle than Marco Ferreri (""La Grande Bouffe"") and his portrait of lassitude is not without its attractions.After the move to the country, one brother begins a frantic affair with a girl in the neighborhood. The other brothers take turns making love to the compliant Sofia. The trees are heavy with foliage. Ripeness has weight. The days stretch on. One by one, each member of the family gives himself up to an idleness that precludes even sex. It's as if the beauty that surrounds them were an intoxicant. If you breathe deeply you fall asleep.One morning the father wakes up and decides it would be simpler all around just to stay in bed and let Sofia bring up his meals on a tray. The brother who had wanted to marry abandons the idea, reasoning that a strange woman would spoil their perfect peace. The eldest brother also takes to his bed.Only Saki, the youngest, remembers the world outside. Between naps he suffers fits of sanity. He reads a history of the French Revolution and repairs an ancient alarm clock, which may not only be to awaken him but also a reference to poor old Louis XVI. When Saki decides to move away and get a job, the other members of the family stir themselves for what is probably the last time. ""He is mad,"" wails the father, who wonders what he has done wrong.The beauty of the settings, the sense of well-fed purposeless, even the languor with which the camera pans across the dozing landscapes  all these things evoke a political outrage that is peculiarly soft, as if the director could not bring himself to face matters directly.The performers are attractive, though only Olga Karlatos, the actress who plays Sofia, is identified in the credits prepared by the museum.""Idlers of the Fertile Valley"" is at its best and funniest when the narrative doesn't seem to mean anything more than what it says, as when the put-upon Sofia is moving about the premises, methodically and quite happily attempting to cope with day-to-day chores in a household where the snore announces the absolute end of all human endeavor.",1979-04-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Dawn of the Dead':Morning After,"SOME people hate musicals, and some dislike westerns, and I have a pet peeve about flesh-eating zombies who never stop snacking. Accordingly, I was able to sit through only the first 15 minutes of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" George Romero's follow-up to ""Night of the Living Dead,"" which Mr. Romero directed in black and white in 1968. Since then, he has discovered color. Perhaps horror-movie buffs will consider this an improvement.At the beginning of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" it was explained that the living dead were on the rampage, that there were a lot of them and that they were hungry. It was also graphically demonstrated that the only way to kill one of these zombies permanently was to blow his or her head off, preferably in a nice, tight close-up. The few living souls who still remained were obviously fighting a losing battle, since their idea of a safe hiding place was a gas station outside of Harrisburg, Pa.Mr. Romero is an acknowledged dean of this sort of thing, and he has been assisted this time by another red-meat magnate, Dario Argento. Mr. Argento, who most recently directed the less stomach-turning ""Suspiria,"" has provided a lot of thumpity-thump music for the soundtrack, along with his combo, the Goblins. On limited evidence, though, ""Dawn of the Dead"" didn't seem like anything that would send an audience home humming its theme song.It was explained to me in the lobby, while a preview audience moaned and groaned, that this is the second installment in what Mr. Romero foresees as a trilogy, and that the bulk of ""Dawn of the Dead"" had been filmed in America's largest shopping mall and is full of satirical points about consuming. Whatever it may be full of, ""Dawn of the Dead"" opens today at the Gemini, the Rivoli, the U.A. 85th Street East and other theaters.""Dawn of the Dead"" has no M.P.A.A. rating, but no one under 17 will be admitted",1979-04-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie: Hungarian 'Just Like at Home':National Black Theater Plans Anniversary Benefit,"MARTA MESZAROS'S ""Just Like at Home,"" a Hungarian film that opens today at the 68th Street Playhouse, is handsome and evocative, even when it's a little more mystifying than American audiences may find useful. Like Miss Meszaros's ""Women,"" which opened here last year, ""Just Like at Home"" is firmly rooted in the particulars of Hungarian life today, and some of it gets lost in translation. But Miss Meszaros's latest effort is filmed with a lovely precision and filled with radiant scenery and appealing actors. Even its elusive moments command attention.An unhappy, temperamental man, played by Jan Nowicki, returns to Hungary after a stay in the United States, and has trouble resuming his former life. His former lover in Budapest, played by the always stunning Anna Karina, has moved on to other things, and he's not altogether comfortable in the rural village where his parents are. Having lived, as he likes to boast, in an American apartment on the 44th floor, he has literally and figurally forgotten how to keep his feet on the ground.Then he meets a sad-faced little girl, a kind of Hungarian Tatum O'Neal (Zsuzsa Czinkoczy), and her wonderful shaggy sheepdog, a Hungarian puli. He demands the dog, but the little girl understandably clings to her pet. He visits the girl's mother, who has six other children and agrees to sell the animal for a high price. He goes back to Budapest, accompanied by the dog and trailed by the child, who clearly comes from the sort of family that will barely miss her. From then on, the movie becomes a gentle, bucolic love story between an adoptive father and daughter.It also follows the antagonism between Miss Karina, who changes her mind and resumes things with her old lover, and the child. Miss Meszaros devotes keen attention to the rivalry between the woman and the girl, even allowing them parallel romp-in-the-country sequences with Mr. Nowicki. The contrast is keen, and edifiying. Miss Karina's scene is funny, tender, tinged with softer feelings. The little girl's scene overflows with pure, uncomplicated love.All of the film concerns itself with varying notions of what a family can be, from the simple life of grape-stomping and harvesting that the hero's parents enjoy to the less traditional arrangement he invents with the child. At one memorable point, the man receives a depressingly sensible proposition from a pretty young woman from his parents' village.

us,Films: 2 by Avant-Garde Director,"""A Walk Through H"" and ""Vertical Features Remake,"" two 40-minute films by Peter Greenaway in the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors/ New Films series, are peculiarly counterproductive. Each features faintly satirical voice-over narration, supposedly by a pedantic disciple of an obscure  and fictitious  avant-garde artist and film maker named Tulse Luper. The work of Luper is discussed in exhaustive detail, particularly in ""Vertical Features Remake,"" which focuses on Luper's fixation on the number 11.However, Mr. Greenaway, a British director, turns out to be pretty serious about the number 11 himself. And so a lot of ""Vertical Features Remake"" is given over to rhythmic counting  11 trees, 11 telephone poles, 11 what-have-you's. This is not altogether uninteresting, and the hypnotic effect it aims for is by no means out of reach. But Mr. Greenaway has already sabotaged himself with a would-be comic introduction, which isn't funny, but does make the more taxing parts of the film appear ridiculous.""A Walk Through H"" introduces Tulse Luper again, even though he has by now become more than tiresome. This time, the connection between 192 Luper drawings and a Luper volume on bird migration is explored. The same difficulties apply.",1979-04-21T05:00:00+0000

However, its inclusion in the series can be explained by its relative obscurity, the praise it received from Sergei Eisenstein and its extraordinarily youthful energies. ""Limite"" is feverishly beautiful and desperately ambitious, even when it isn't clear.Mr. Peixoto, who is reportedly at work on something new, anticipated in ""Limite"" a great many camera movements that have since become commonplace, and the air of discovery is one of the things that keeps ""Limite"" exciting. His camera zooms in on a subject even if that means zooming out of focus, or executes a dizzyingly precarious 360-degree whirl. He shoots up at his actors from such a low angle that a telephone pole appears to hover over them, or devotes long sections of the film exclusively to the players' feet. His choices are flashy, impetuous and never less than interesting.However, ""Limite"" is of more technical than dramatic importance. Beginning with two women and a man adrift in an open boat, and following each of them through more-or-less imaginary adventures on land, the narrative is elusive at best. Despair is evidently meant to be the overriding sentiment, but despair is easily upstaged by the glorious Brazilian scenery. It's hard to share the misery of a woman contemplating suicide when the bay into which she may jump shimmers exquisitely and is bounded by a spectacular mountainside.Mr. Peixoto appears briefly near the end of the film, sitting mysteriously in a graveyard and announcing something  on one of the few title cards  about leprosy.

us,Film: 'The Whole Shootin' Match' Shown in Series,"Lloyd (Lou Perry), who looks like a younger Slim Pickens, and Frank (Sonny Davis), whose hair is receding with increasing speed as he approaches his mid-30's, are not losers in any tragic sense. They simply dream beyond their means. Though they live in rural Texas, they (like the rest of us) are subjected to a constant barrage of hype designed to make them dissatisfied with their lives. By the time that Eagle Pennell's ""The Whole Shootin' Match"" opens, they've already failed as farmers of frogs, of chinchillas and of flying squirrels, and they're ready to chance their fortunes once again, this time in the polyurethane business. As Lloyd points out, ""there's money to be made from rich hippies who like to spread (polyurethane) all over their houses.""""The Whole Shootin' Match,"" the first feature to be directed by the 25-year-old Mr. Pennell, is a loving, indulgent, funny, very casual movie about the ups and downs of a couple of innocent, self-defeating American clowns. It's almost the perfect movie for the New Directors/New Films series, which is presenting the film at the Museum of Modern Art today at 8:30 P.M. and Monday at 6 P.M.""The Whole Shootin' Match"" is often a technical mess, but never for a moment is it out of control. Even the clumsiness of the photography works as a reflection of the sort of lives led by its characters. When someone walks offscreen, it's as if the camera couldn't keep up or had been distracted by something of less importance. The sepia print is faded in the way of jeans that have been left too long in the sun.The outcomes of Lloyd and Frank's various get-rich-quick schemes are predictable enough, but far from predictable are Mr. Pennell's feelings for his characters and the performances he obtains from his actors. These are both surprising and invigorating.It may be that the director has some things to learn about comedy timing, but even when he inexplicably cuts short a very funny sequence, I can't be sure if it's an oversight or a subtle way of focusing our attention. If it's the latter, it works.Mr. Perry and Mr. Davis are fine as the bumbling entrepreneurs and Doris Hargrave is terrifically appealing as Frank's frequently forgotten wife, a former high-school beauty who suspects she married the wrong man, but makes do with a lot of good humor, sex and a newfound faith in Jesus.""The Whole Shootin' Match"" reportedly cost $30,000.

us,Postwar Japan on Film-- The Dark Side of Affluence:The Dark Side Of Postwar Japan,"""Postwar Japanese Society Through Film,"" a series of 12 powerful films about a nation in moral and spiritual crisis, opens Friday night at Japan House as part of a three-month, nation-wide celebration called ""Japan Today."" The series will run through June 8, with each film being shown twice.These particular films are unusual selections because they uncover a little-known Japan facing problems of such magnitude that at times they seem destined to tear the entire social fabric asunder.Pictured here is not a nation of tea ceremonies and the gracious dignity of ritual restraint, but rather a society that has arisen phoenix-like from the ashes, a society summed up morally by a shot from the 1947 Ozu film, ""Record of a Tenement Gentleman"": Just after the war, orphans in rags are smoking cigarettes and scratching their lice-ridden bodies as they sit somnolently in Tokyo's Ueno Park under a statue of Saigo Takamori, a famous 19th-century advocate of Japanese expansion in Southeast Asia.From the late 40's through the 70's, the three decades encompassed by this series, Japan's problems grew both more far-reaching and ever more inaccessible to remedy. There was famine and unemployment in the immediate postwar years. Then, in the years of heady economic growth, there was an untraditional materialism fanned furiously into being by advertising methods of surreal ingenuity. Finally there has been, in the 70's, the exposure of collusions between government and big business that placed gargantuan sums of money into the pockets of a few.Whether harsh, gentle or bitterly ironic, the 12 directors whose films constitute this series indicate how disillusioned they are with the newly prosperous postwar Japan.On Friday the series will be inaugurated with the 1946 ""No Regrets for Our Youth,"" a superb early work of Akira Kurosawa. The only film of this group set during the war, it explores the spiritual growth of a young Japanese woman named Yukie (Setsuko Hara), who discovers that ""to live"" (always a Kurosawa theme) she must give up piano lessons and flower arranging for a life of greater purpose. Moving from Kyoto to Tokyo  traditional past to hysterical wartime present  Yukie first becomes involved in anti-war activities. Later she renounces the genteel existence of the idle upper-middle-class wife for which she is destined, choosing instead the grueling life of a farm woman, living among less fortunate people to whom she hopes to be of service.No matter that Mr. Kurosawa happened simultaneously to be complying with two of the edicts of the American Occupation and General McArthur, the making of films which illustrated anti-war sentiment as well as the emancipation of women. ""No Regrets,"" one of Mr. Kurosawa's most deeply felt films and one infrequently screened abroad, is fresh in its awareness that it is not enough to survive; living meaningfully may entail the sacrifice of a comfortable continuity for less certain paths.The most surprising and powerful of the 12 films are the biting satires which, had they been made by foreigners, might have even been termed ""anti-Japanese"": ""Pigs and Battleships,"" ""A Full-Up Train,"" ""The Build-Up,"" ""Night Butterflies"" and ""Solar Eclipse,"" all being shown in the United States for the first time.The most brilliant of these is generally acknowledged to be Shohei Imamura's 1961 ""Pigs and Battleships."" Set in the environs of the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka, the film reveals the effect of the American presence upon Japanese teenagers. The 1946 Constitution forbidding Japan to re-arm notwithstanding, the director portrays Japanese spectators admiring American Phantom jets: ""Americans are so great. Different from our Self-Defense Army."" The ""pigs"" of the title are Japanese gangsters, amateur and professional, who prey on the innocent no less than the intruding Americans. Petty gangsters raise hogs fed on the refuse of the American base  just as, says a bitter Mr. Imamura, the postwar Japanese have been force-fed the garbage of American culture. A child reads aloud from his school text, ""The reason Japan developed so fast was that it adopted Western culture so effectively."" But what we see is the culture spawned by the American base: A black market, prostitution and a resurgent militarism.If Mr. Imamura chastises with sardonic wit, Kon Ichikawa is mordantly hilarious. In ""The Full-Up Train,"" the funniest of the 12 films, the director pulls out all stops. ""The train's full,"" mourns Moroi, Mr. Ichikawa's hero, ""but we have to take it, there won't be any other."" The noise is so deafening it gives Moroi an incurable psychosomatic toothache. University graduates are lucky to get jobs as janitors. Overcrowding is so endemic that men line up in droves just to play pachinko, or Japanese pin-ball. Nepotism is rampant. On this full-up train that is Japan, madness and even suicide seem real options.No less broad in its humorous depiction of the inhospitality of contemporary Japan toward the Japanese is Yasuzo Masumara's 1958 ""The Build-Up,"" in which a candy executive, gazing from his skyscraper window at the moving crowds below, remarks, ""They all look like caramels."" The executive longs for a natural catastrophe to stimulate profits: ""If there's no ???disaster, there will be too much fruit, and ???rm kids won't eat candy."" Nor are student demonstrators exempt from the exhortations of the advertising agency in the candy company's emplay: ""Enjoy caramels while you're marching!"" And meanwhile, someone bemoans that Japanese women prefer American boyfriends since Japanese men are skinny, have short legs and make less money.""A Full-Up Train,"" ""Pigs And Battleships"" and ""The Ceremony""  a 1971 Nagisa Oshima film in which old war criminals re-assume positions of power in government and industry  reveal that is the young who pay, whose future now seems hopelessly mortgaged and beyond their control.Often, like the 1957 ""Night Butterflies,"" the films of this series are semi-documentary in impulse, buttressing their criticisms with factual information conveyed in authoritative voiceovers. ""Night Butterflies"" initiates us into night-town Tokyo, with its 5,000 bar girls competing for customers. Into this, Osaka entrepreneurs are forging their way. ""We'll contribute election funds!"" decides an Osaka merchant well-schooled in how things work.Equally sober in its unrelenting scrutiny of the ""new Japan"" is ""Solar Eclipse,"" based upon a real-life scandal involving the awarding of a construction contract. Once again the victims are ordinary Japanese, the taxpayers who ultimately finance the bribes. The steady accumulation of incriminating detail in this film is breathtaking: Votes of Diet members are purchased. The newly elected Prime Minister sends a representative to a money-lender for funds to tide him over. A corporation executive explains, ""It's usual to burn unnecessary documents."" ""A rotten apple is never alone,"" says the president of a semi-government-owned company which awards the construction contract; the man himself is about to accept a bribe.The journalist counterpart to our Woodward and Bernstein who would blow the whistle on all this corruption is murdered. And the chief prosecutor of the Watergate-style Diet investigating committee (seen taking a bribe even before the credits) is now told not to ""stimulate peoples' distrust of politics."" Offered a long paid vacation by his party to ""study the world situation,"" be departs. Curtain after curtain is lifted as this formidable film exposes a Japan unknown to most. (Director Satsuo Yamamoto has also made a film about the Lockheed scandal.)Rarely shown and also part of the series is ""Summer Soldiers,"" a 1972-work written and co-directed by John Nathan, an American Japanologist turned filmmaker. Exploring the attempt of the Japanese anti-war movement to shield American deserters from Vietnam, the film is based upon taped dialogues between often illiterate American conscripts from the South and their highly educated, articulate hosts, who took upon themselves the Quixotic task of assimilating these American G.I.'s into middle-class Japanese homes. What befell these Americans, who never learned the language, was disaster: Rape, theft, encounters with the Japanese police. Jean-Paul Sartre praised ""Summer Soldiers"" for conveying ""the sheer agony of limited communication between people who have grown up in two different cultures, the existential agony of the foreigner in a foreign land.""Closing the series is woman director Sachiko Hidari's ""The Far Road,"" a 1977 film about the painful efforts of Japan's railway workers to create labor unions which speak to their needs. Miss Hidari's film deprives us of any illusion about this recourse for the besieged Japanese citizen.Under attack by all 12 films is an entire culture, a distorted value system in which things foreign are foolishly preferred, an unresponsive government and an unfair economy. No social institution escapes the satire of these directors as they lay bare an uneasy Japan racing without moral restraint toward postwar prosperity.Offering not a single avenue for reform, the films meticulously detail the inhumanities faced by the Japanese in their daily lives in which, as Heinosuke Gosho reveals in his gentle 1953 work, ""Where Chimneys Are Seen,"" personal gratification is hard to come by.And solutions seem nowhere in sight. In ""No Regrets for Our Youth,"" jail awaited Yukie and her activist lover, but at least their decision to oppose the war was clear-cut. It finds no parallel among characters facing postwar injustice. The evil seems too vast even to comprehend, let alone to combat. The demand that everyone accommodate to working hard in this overcrowded Japan requires acquiescence, as Mr. Masumua says in ""The Build-Up"": ""We're in Japan. We must work hard or we can't live.""Joan Mellen is the author of ""Big Bad Wolves: Masculinity in the American Film"" and a forthcoming novel set in Japan, ""Natural Tendencies.""",1979-04-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Strick's Version Of 'Portrait of an Artist',"There's a marvelous sequence near the beginning of Joseph Strick's measured, almost stately film version of James Joyce's ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."" The very young Stephen Dedalus witnesses an uproarious dinner-table battle between his father, Simon, and his governess, Dante, over politics, Parnell, the Roman Catholic Church, Ireland and the Irish, who, Simon Dedalus says, ""are a priest-ridden race,"" to which Dante replies with the kind of scream that usually signals death, ""If we are priest-ridden, we ought to be proud of it! They are the apple of God's eye....""The little boy listens enraptured. He is fascinated by the passion and the language, if not totally understanding the ideas. There are a number of other sequence???s in this film that capture the passion, language and ideas of Joyce's great autobiographical novel, which was first published in 1916 and marked the transition from the comparatively conventional Joyce of ""The Dubliners"" to the innovative Joyce of ""Ulysses"" and ""Finnegan's Wake.""These sequences, however, become increasingly rare as the movie proceeds from Stephen's childhood in turn-of-the-century Ireland, a time marked by momentous reversals in fortune, to his young manhood when the most important events are raging philisophical battles that are not especially dramatic or photogenic.""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,"" which opens today at the Embassy 72d Street and Guild Theaters, is both worthy and maddening. It's worthy because Mr. Strick and his screen writer, Judith Rascoe, obviously admire Joyce enough to wish to share that admiration with a large cinema audience, and they have packed the film with great passages of the Joycean language. It's maddening because their task is an impossible one, as it was when Mr. Strick made his equally faithful, equally frustrating screen version of ""Ulysses.""""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"" is not a long book, but it is not one that can be easily dramatized. Its substance is not events, but the language that evokes the steps by which its questing hero finally arrives at his decision to quit family, friends, homeland and church to go into exile to become the artist. Language heard is very different from language read. The trouble is not that Joyce's language is so literary  it's not  but that the vocabulary of ideas numbs the ear. The effect of the last half-hour of this film is to make Stephen Dedalus, who is one of the most courageous and adventurous heros in modern literature, seem a bore.Mr. Strick and Miss Rascoe skim across the surface of the book like agile water-skiers on a choppy sea. They never fall, but they never give us any sense of the density of the water itself.The film is carefully composed and beautifully photographed, mostly in Dublin, which, apparently, can recreate any era in its history, and its cast of Irish actors is superb.Bosco Hogan, who plays the grown up Stephen, has the toughest job because so much of the action is interior. A smooth-faced, bespectacled young man, he must forever be taking things in, reacting to others, or ruminating on the soundtrack about Life and Art, which is not easy. T.P. McKenna and Rosaleen Linihan, who play his parents, are funny and spirited, especially in the earlier scenes before the Dedalus family begins its descent into poverty, even though they never appear to age. Maureen Potter is awfully good as the outraged Dante and Terence Strick and Luke Johnston, who play Stephen at, respectively, ages 3 and 10, are most winning. John Gielgud makes a brief appearance as the priest, who, for a few minutes, inspires visions of hell and eternal damnation within Stephen, though the casting of Mr. Gielgud in this role has a way of deflecting attention from the effect of the sermon on Stephen to the man delivering it.This film version of ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"" should, I suppose, be a valuable teaching aid if, indeed, schools and universities have not junked Joyce in favor of an in-depth course on Television Programming, 1950-60. The film's deficiencies testify not to the supremacy of the word over the image, but to the differences, which we should never forget and always cherish.",1979-04-22T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: A Vignette From India,"""GHATASHRADDHA,"" an Indian film in the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors/New Films series, is set in the early 1940's and proceeds at a pace that might seem contemplative to a snail.A young boy, a Brahmin, is sent by his father to a Vedic school in southern India, where he is befriended by a beautiful widow, the schoolmaster's daughter. She is pregnant. The boy tries to help conceal her condition from the other students and the town busy-body. Finally, her secret is discovered and she undergoes an abortion, and the ritual of the title, an excommunication. She becomes an untouchable, the school closes down, and the boy is returned to his aristocratic family.All this is of considerably more anthropological than cinematic interest. The director, a 27-year-old Indian film school graduate named Girish Kasaravalli, offers considerable solemnity but few surprises. He uses outstandingly beautiful actors to play his admirable characters, and squat, shifty-eyed players for his villains. His command of the camera is at times barely rudimentary, and there is little visual variety to the film. Occasionally, the customs and the countryside on view are captured with admirable delicacy.But what sort of audience can a film like this expect to attract? The New Directors series is undeniably performing a worthy function in exhibiting a first film that would perhaps not be shown here otherwise, a film that could look a good deal better with hindsight some day.But for the time being, students of Indian cinema have at their disposal the masterpieces of Satyajit Ray, which turn up on the art-house circuit with great frequency, and the Bombay Cinema, which shows a wide spectrum of Indian commercial movies. ""Ghatashraddha"" demonstrates neither the artistry of the first nor the vitality of the second.",1979-04-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie: Feminist Film From Germany,"""THE All-Round Reduced Personality"" is the first fiction feature to be made by Helke Sander, the German director and actress who here is also her own star. The feminist film, as earnest and clear and chilly as its elegant black-and-white photography, is about Edda (Miss Sander), a still photographer in West Berlin, and her struggles both to support herself and her child and to realize herself as an artist and a woman. If that sounds a bit grim, it's meant to.Miss Sander apparently equates seriousness with a kind of pinched humorlessness that passes for irony. For much of the film Edda exists in an enclave within an enclave, dealing mostly with other women photographers and occasionally with male editors who are out to exploit feminism for profit. She has an affair with a young man named Werner whom she uses as a sex object, but it is as unsatisfactory as it is brief. Edda desires something more than a pretty face.The photography by Katia Forbert is the most interesting aspect of the film. As its heroine moves through her half of the divided city of Berlin, ""The All-Round Reduced Personality"" looks out at the scenery and, like Edda, often frowns at what it sees. The movie is very bossy in its displeasure. Watching it is like seeing the world through the disapproving eyes of Charlie Brown's long-time companion and critic, Lucy.""The, All-Round Reduced Personality"" is not unintelligent. It cares about the world but it is unable to communicate much except its own discreet superiority.Miss Sander, who looks a lot like Annie Girardot, is an attractive actress and is unexpectedly charming in her scenes at home with her child, which are not many since Edda must spend so much time away from home realizing herself.Also on the bill is a short, funny, irreverent Brazilian film, ""Tropical Fruit,"" made by Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, the director of ""Macuniama"" and ""Guerra Conjugal."" A send-up of a certain kind of academe, ""Tropical Fruit"" is about a pompous graduate student who has one teeny-tiny quirk: He likes to make love to watermelons.As he confides to a sympathetic young woman, he is not ""addicted"" to watermelons, ""just accustomed."" Because his obsession is limiting (and because there are ""seasonal problems""), the young woman tries to broaden his horizons by persuading him to test various other kinds of melons as well as vegetables. ""Tropical Fruit"" is that rare commodity  a movie with a happy ending.The program will be presented in the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art today at 6 P.M. and tomorrow at 8:30 P.M.",1979-04-24T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Woody Allen's 'Manhattan',"AS California is our idealized future, a place where there is no downtown because the suburbs have moved in instead of out, hip Manhattan represents our idealized present. Existence in Manhattan is so fleeting that one sometimes wishes one could postdate oneself, as do the weekly magazines, in this way to avoid life's litter basket, for a few days, anyway.""Manhattan,"" Woody Allen's extraordinarily fine and funny new film, is about many things, including a time and place where fashion probably blights more lives, more quickly, than any amounts of booze, drugs, radioactive fallout and saturated animal fats. In this Manhattan, it's no longer a question of keeping up, but of staying ahead. The person on this week's cover is a leading candidate for next year's feature story that asks, ""Whatever happened to . . . ?""To survive in alien landscapes, animals develop bizarre defense mechanisms, often at a certain cost. Ostriches can run fast, but they are unable to fly. Sharks have teeth like the slicing blade in a Cuisinart, yet if they take a stationary snooze, their lungs fill with water and they drown. They must always keep moving.This is pretty much the fate of a number of people who move through and around the Manhattan of Isaac Davis (Mr. Allen), a successful comedy writer who quits his television job to write a novel. As Isaac Davis is Mr. Allen's most fully realized, most achingly besieged male character, so is ""Manhattan"" his most moving and expansive work to date. It's as serious as ""Interiors""  if one must use that often foolish word  but far less constricted and self-conscious. In ""Manhattan,"" Mr. Allen is working in a milieu he knows well and with characters he understands and appreciates, especially when they are drowning.In addition to being the director and co-author  with Marshall Brickman  of the film, Mr. Allen is its most important presence. He gives ""Manhattan"" a point of reference just as he did 10 years ago when the character he played was named Virgil Starkwell in ""Take the Money and Run."" How Virgil and Woody have grown!""Manhattan"" moves on from both ""Interiors"" and ""Annie Hall,"" being more effectively critical and more compassionate than the first and more witty and clear-eyed than the second. There is a sense of applied romance here, especially in the soundtrack use of some of the lushest melodies ever written by George Gershwin, as well as in Mr. Allen's decision to have Gordon Willis photograph ""Manhattan"" in the kind of velvety black-and-white I associate with old M-G-M films like ""East Side, West Side"" and ""The Bad and the Beautiful."" The movie looks so good that it looks unreal, which, in this day and age of film and fashion, is to go so far out that you're back in.""Manhattan"" is, of course, about love, or, more accurately, about relationships. Among those who are attempting to relate to Isaac Davis are Mary Wilke (Diane Keaton), a journalist who carries on like an Annie Hall who has been analyzed out of her shyness into the shape of an aggressively neurotic woman doomed to make a mess of things, and Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), a beautiful. 17-year-old nymphet with a turned-down mouth and a trust in her 42-year-old lover, Isaac, that is also doomed. In addition, there is Yale (Michael Murphy), Isaac's best friend, who hands Mary over to Isaac for as long as it suits his (Yale's) purposes.On the fringe of the film, observing the events with the grim determination of someone who has made a decision that must be stuck by, is Isaac's former wife, Jill (Meryl Streep), who left Isaac and, with their small son, moved in with her feamle lover, in such circumstances to write a best-selling book about her life titled ""Marriage, Divorce and Selfhood.""""Manhattan,"" which opens today at the Baronet and other theaters, is mostly about Isaac's efforts to get some purchase on his life after he initiates a breakup with his illegal, teenage mistress  a marvelous scene set at a soda fountain, with Tracy slurping down a large malted while her life goes smash  and his attempt to forge a relationship with the deeply troubled Mary Wilke. Unlike all of his friends except the still-learning Tracy, Isaac believes in monogamy. ""I think people should mate for life,"" he says, ""like pigeons and Catholics.""What happens is not the substance of ""Manhattan"" as much as how it happens. The movie is full of moments that are uproariously funny and others that are sometimes shattering for the degree in which they evoke civilized desolation.The screenplay is so vivid you may feel as if you've met characters who are only references in the dialogue. One of these is Mary Wilke's psychiatrist, Donny, who calls her up at 3 A.M. and weeps. The on-screen characters are beautifully played by, among others, Mr. Murphy and Miss Streep. Miss Keaton and Miss Hemingway are superb  the effect of Miss Hemingway's performance being directly responsible for the unexpected impact of Mr. Allen's penultimate moment in the film, which should not be described here.I suspect there will be much more to say about ""Manhattan"" in the future. Mr. Allen's progress as one of our major film makers is proceeding so rapidly that we who watch him have to pause occasionally to catch our breath.",1979-04-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie: George Roy Hill Offers 'A Little Romance':In Love in Paris,"PARIS in the spring. A beautiful, brilliant, American student named Lauren meets and falls in love with Daniel, who is French and as brilliant as Lauren. They both read Heidigger and share a fondness for American films, especially those, like ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and ""The Sting,"" that were directed by George Roy Hill. Though they act as if they were sophisticated, they are nave at heart. When Daniel takes Lauren to see her first porn film, she runs out in tears. She hadn't expected it to be ""like that."" ""That,"" says Daniel, ""isn't love.""How old are Lauren and Daniel? It's difficult to tell. It's not only because Diane Lane, who plays Lauren, is tall and could pass for 18, and because Thelonious Bernard, who plays Daniel, is short and could pass for 13, but because the attitudes, manners and language imposed on them seem to be those of the screenwriter, who may be prematurely aged.Lauren and Daniel are, I think, meant to be comic and appealing in their mixture of innocence and worldliness. Yet Mr. Hill's ""A Little Romance,"" which opens today at the Sutton, recalls most vividly the arch manner in which the Our Gang comedies workedby having their child actors ape not the behavior of children but of grownups.""A Little Romance"" is a movie that seems to have melted the minds of everyone of any stature connected with it. Fifteen years ago, Mr. Hill made one of his first big splashes in movies with that still-charming comedy, ""The World of Henry Orient,"" after which he went on to do ""Butch Cassidy,"" ""The Sting,"" ""Slaughterhouse Five"" and ""The Great Waldo Pepper."" That's an impressive record in terms of art and commerce. Yet ""A Little Romance"" is so ponderous it seems almost mean spirited. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie about boorish American tourists and felt sorry for the touristswhich is one of Mr. Hill's achievements here.I'm sure nothing mean-spirited was intended, but such is the film's effect. This may be the main hazard when one sets out to make a film so relentlessly sweet-tempered that it winds uplike Pollyana  alienating everyone not similarly affected.Its most appalling spectacle is not the manner in which its two young actors behave. Although Mr. Bernard never makes a move that Mr. Hill does not seem to have directed, Miss Lane occasionally has some nicely spontaneous moments. The grim thing in ""A Little Romance"" is the sight of Laurence Olivier coming as close to making a spectacle of himself as he ever has in his screen career.Mr. Olivier plays the Maurice Chevalier role, a role in which even Mr. Chevalier finally became tiresome. Mr. Olivier is never tiresomesometimes he is quite funnybut he does seem desperate. As an elderly, extremely soft-hearted, French pickpocket who befriends the young lovers, Mr. Olivier is required to be not much more than cute. Because this clearly doesn't interest him, he gives the busiest, most lip-smacking, most eyeball-rolling performance of his career, outdoing even his impersonation of a West Indian Othello some years ago.Usually such outrageous Olivier behavior is fun to watch even when it doesn't fit. This time it's more suspenseful than fun. We keep wondering (and fearing) what business he's going to come up with next to take our minds off the essential foolishness of the enterprise. Typical is a sequence in which the old man learns from a Veronese newspaper that he is being sought for kidnapping, after he's accompanied the children from Paris to Italy under the impression he's taking them to the girl's sick mother. You've never heard so many grand variations of snorts, groans and whimpers. Yet because the film is so uninvolving, the performance comes to look like an inventory of the Olivier special effects. It makes one appreciate a little more what he did in ""Marathon Man,"" ""The Betsy"" and ""The Boys from Brazil,"" as well as the films themselves.The other players in the film include Sally Kellerman, as Lauren's heedless, much-married mother; Arthur Hill, as her stepfather, and Broderick Crawford, as himself, a role that really does not fit him very well. Miss Kellerman's material allows little room for her to move in, while Mr. Hill, playing the same part he had in ""The Champ,"" seems in danger of becoming so self-effacing he may wake up one morning to find himself invisible.David Dukes is amusing as a movie director who may or may not be modeled on William Friedkin. Ashby Semple plays Lauren's best friend, a ""Junior Miss"" role, that of a tall, gawky girl with braces on her teeth. The part is gross.""A Little Romance,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains some mildly suggestive sequences, though the porn film mentioned above is neither seen nor heard.",1979-04-27T05:00:00+0000

Meanwhile, tenants at 2,000 affected buildings in Manhattan continued their efforts to maintain their own services. Elderly residents and those with heart conditions were advised to climb stairs half a flight at a time in those buildings without elevator service. The Health Department certified eight areas as health problems, a designation that allowed city workers to cross picketfines to remove garbage. Operators answering the city's hot line telephone (2679800)  which is manned from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. to handle strikerelated emergencies  received 190 calls yesterday, mostly concerning garbage collection, hot water and elevator service. The striking union, meanwhile, said the managements of 100 more apartment buildings had made independent settlements, bringing the total to 200 since the walkout began. [Page 131.] Tugboats: A State Supreme Court justice, rescinding another judge's order, ruled that the state's courts could not order striking tugboat workers to haul city garbage. With the strike in its 26th day, the Koch administration was considering a complex plan, backed by the union, that would involve seizing tugs from the struck Moran company or chartering other tugs  at Moran's expense and hiring strikers to operate them.",1979-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Unlikely Duo's 'Almost Perfect Affair':Sublimely Incompatible,"KEITH CARRADINE and Monica Vitti, as the lovers in ""An Almost Perfect Affair,"" are funny, sexy and sublimely incompatible. Mr. Carradine is cast as a scruffy young film maker trying to sell his first feature at the Cannes Film Festival, and Miss Vitti is the wife of a mogul along the lines of Dino De Laurentiis, a man so unmistakably successful that even his black dinner jacket is emblazoned with the Gucci logo. The mogul is played, delightfully, by Raf Vallone, whose wardrobe is indeed by Gucci, just as Miss Vitti's clothes are by Valentino. As the opening credits merrily proclaim, Mr. Carradine's wardrobe is all his own.The lovers' meeting is cute as can be, as French customs officers manage to confiscate both Mr. Carradine's movie and Miss Vitti's dog. Since the mogul's wife is well connected, she is able to get both the film and the animal out of stir. Since she has a lot of time on her hands while her husband wheels and deals, romance is in the air. Sparks fly until the last section of this enjoyably modest movie, when the couple begin debating about art and sacrifice and whether Mr. Carradine is brave enough to toss his only copy of the film into the Mediterranean for the sake of love.""An Almost Perfect Affair,"" which opens today at the Trans-Lux East, was directed by Michael Ritchie, whose work on ""Smile"" and ""The Bad News Bears"" might seem to make him ideally equipped to send up a spectacle like Cannes. Curiously, this time Mr. Ritchie makes relatively slight use of his satirical gifts or his flair for the well-staged mob scene. The film festival becomes a backdrop and not much more, even though Mr. Ritchie shot a large amount of footage at the height of last year's hubbub.Real movie-business personalities turn up from time to time; Rona Barrett is also on hand, tripping on a stair as she tries to tape a television spot about the festival. But the camera is surprisingly nonchalant as it whisks by a landscape riddled with billboards and heads into the Carlton Hotel, an otherwise elegant building that has had a giant pink panther affixed to its doorway. If the film festival has any life to it at all, then Mr. Ritchie has passed up a golden opportunity. In any case, whenever the scene shifts to the festival in overview, Mr. Carradine, Miss Vitti and their spooning are sorely missed.The banter between the lovers, however winning, has a choppy feeling. There is an inexplicable amount of cutting from Mr. Carradine to Miss Vitti and back again, so much cutting that each actor's comic timing is slightly out of kilter. Nevertheless, these are sweet, spirited performances, as is Mr. Vallone's, though his appearance is far too brief.The cast is rounded out by Christian de Sica, son of the late director Vittorio de Sica, who plays Mr. Vallone's peabrained offspring. And Dick Anthony Williams is amusing as a black director who never misses a trick, and who has the comic brainstorm of renaming ""Choice of Ending,"" Mr. Carradine's documentary about Gary Gilmore. The new title, which indeed seems better suited to the tenor of the festival, is ""Shoot Me Before I Kill Again.""""An Almost Perfect Affair"" is rated PG. It contains a few scenes of partial nudity.",1979-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Les Rendez-vous':Enigmatic Character,"THE heroine of ""Les Rendezvous d'Anna,"" described by the film's director. Chantal Akerman, as ""a sort of mutant . . . . perhaps a heroine of the future,"" is both so fearless and joyless she's almost a ghost. Anna, played with great care by Aurora Clment, is a young film maker traveling from city to city to promote her work. The movie spans several days and three countries, moving from one determinedly neutral setting to the next, as it suggests a rootlessness that goes perhaps too far beyond freedom.Anna meets a variety of people, listens closely to the long monologues they deliver and, upon rare occasions, volunteers tiny bits of information about herself. She seems engaged by everything and by nothing. She also seems, perhaps because of her attentive manner and regal bearing, to be in great demand as an audience and a lover. Everyone who encounters Anna wants more of her. But Anna, who is either a uniquely self-sufficient human being or a terrible pill, isn't often generous with her feelings. Other people interest her, but then so do the shoes and leftover dinner she finds outside someone else's hotel-room door one evening. She is presumably meant to have the absolute independence and receptiveness of a true artist.Miss Akerman's film, which will be shown tomorrow as part of the New Directors/ New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art, has a crisp, simple elegance at times, as the camera studies a hotel room or a train station with a patience like Anna's own. Miss Akerman's attention to detail, like Anna's, is at times peculiarly excessive, as when Anna finds a strange man's necktie in her room and feels obliged to report that it is ""on two hangers, on the left-hand side of the closet.""Most of the tales told to Anna cut right to the bone, to the very simplest level of despair, and yet the film's tone is too detached to seem bleak. If anything, the mood is mysteriously playful at times, as in a sweet, knowing sequence that shows an uncharacteristically light-hearted Anna singing a little song to one of her lovers. ""A little sunshine can be so bright that it hurts,"" goes the refrain.For all of its emphasis upon discipline and precision, ""Les Rendez-vous d'Anna"" begins to seem unduly self-indulgent after a while, thanks to too many arid transitional passages and a stinginess with information that turns counterproductive. The film's handsome severity is impressive, but its restraint is ultimately more forbidding than provocative.",1979-04-27T05:00:00+0000

One result is that the narrative, which is primarily what movies like this are all about, sometimes becomes hopelessly muddled in trivial confusions.The time of ""Saint Jack"" is approximately now and the setting is a Singapore that  despite of the presense of a new Hilton hotel, which looks like almost every other Hilton hotel you've ever seen  is wicked in a way that Oriental cities were supposed to be in all pre-World War II movies.It's the tale of Jack Flowers (Ben Gazzara), a stateside dropout, who wheels and deals with the Singapore underworld to open the fanciest whore-house north and west of Krakatoa. Jack is not just a prince, as the late Mr. Ladd was, but he's also a saint for his essential goodness. He befriends waifs, whores, incompetents and bores, the little guys everywhere, no matter what their race, color, creed or sexual preference. Among his pals is a mild-mannered though gutsy Englishman, nicely played by Denholm Elliott, an accountant with a bad ticker and a dream of one day retiring to a Georgian house in the west of England.For a movie that is supposed to be a melodrama, ""Saint Jack"" is surprisingly low key, even when it's dealing with sex and violence. This is not said as criticism. There is something appealing in the way it digresses to introduce raffish characters principally because Mr. Bogdanovich met and liked them when he was in Singapore making the picture.Mr. Bogdanovich himself appears in an important role, that of a rich, mysterious Mr. Big who, for a while, becomes Jack's partner. Mr. Bogdanovich is not a bad actor, but he is a weightless personality on the screen. It's as if he were standing in for the actor who would come along at any minute and play the role.Mr. Gazzara, a very good actor, is maybe too good to be the kind of mythical icon that such a film demands. In style, he belongs to the films of today, not to the romances of yesteryear.Something of this sort troubles the entire film. In several of his earlier films, especially ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""What's Up, Doc?"" and ""Daisy Miller,"" Mr. Bogdanovich successfully revived and brought forward  in his own manner  movie genres of other eras. That takes nerve as well as talent, and it's nerve that's missing from ""Saint Jack."" One wishes it were more outrageous and less knowing.Though it's a movie composed of substitutes (Mr. Gazzara for Mr. Ladd, Singapore for the Paramount backlot, etc.), the movie hasn't substituted anything for the sentimental treatment of its hero. At this point I find it impossible to be moved or even much interested in this last vestige of a discredited colonialism. Jack Flowers is not only dead. He also represents a kind of fiction that wasn't all that great when he was alive.",1979-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Consequence' From West Germany:The Cast,"The first and best part of ""The Consequence"" is a tender courtship episode, delicately rendered. Martin, a quiet, sad-eyed man of perhaps 30 years old, is imprisoned for having had sex with a 15-year-old boy, and while incarcerated he finds Thomas, the son of one of the prison officials. Thomas (Ernst Hannawald) has the cheek-bones of a female fashion model and the innocent beauty of an angel. And, more to the point, Thomas has a crush on Martin (Jurgen Prochnow) from the moment they meet.Their affair is consummated in the kind of gradual, intimate, not at all sexually explicit love scene one seldom sees between heterosexual couples on the screen any more. The director, Wolfgang Petersen, uses slow, steady camera movements and the natural warmth of his two actors to give this early part of his film  all of which is in black and white  an unusually rosy glow.The rest of ""The Consequence,"" which is a West German contribution to the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors/New Films series, follows Thomas and Martin from one hardship to the next, with society persecuting them at every turn. Martin is denied parole after the prison guards read one of Thomas's love letters. Thomas loses his job for consorting with Martin later on. Thomas winds up in a reform school populated exclusively by goons, including one burly sadist who puts out cigars on the persons of his least-favorite students.Even before the other reform school boys try to force Thomas to have sex with a pimply, feeble-minded girl with thick glasses, Mr. Petersen makes it clear that he favors a stacked deck. Heterosexuality is represented, by this girl and by Thomas's dreadful parents, as the cruelest of fates, and everyone they meet seems determined to harass the lovers. Indeed, until one late scene showing Martin in a homosexual bar, there is little evidence that Switzerland and West Germany, where the film takes place, contain any other homosexuals except these two. Such over-simplifications eventually push the plot over the edge into unabashed melodrama.Still, Mr. Petersen keeps the love story so vivid and simple, in its way, that his more heavy-handed flourishes are easy to ignore. Much of ""The Consequence"" is sentimental in the nicest sense and genuinely romantic, too. Mr. Petersen demonstrates both technical proficiency and a sensitivity toward the gentler side of his subject.",1979-04-28T05:00:00+0000

Roberto not only suffers the life of an outsider, he embraces it as well as the isolation, the humiliation and the homesickness that go with it. Because he refuses to learn English, the best he can do by way of employment is a job as superintendent in a large tenement on the Upper West Side.""El Super,"" a Cuban-American feature film shot in New York, opens early on a Sunday morning in February as Roberto tries to sleep while angry tenants upstairs bang on the pipes demanding that the boiler be turned on. They are entitled, but he has forgotten. Finally he rouses himself. Says Aurelia of the commotion, ""I can't stand English the first thing in the morning.""A little later, Aurelia surveys their neat basement apartment, furnished with all of the necessities, including a television set and an electric blender, and reports that she's tired of peering out the window and seeing nothing but people's feet. ""It's like looking at the world from underneath,"" which is pretty much the way Roberto sees things.From this beginning you might suspect that ""El Super"" would be grim, but you'd be wrong. It's a funny, even-tempered, unsentimental drama about people in particular transit. Roberto thinks of his life as being a sort of long, boring, nonstop flight from Cuba that will eventually circle back there, while Aurelita and a number of their friends are losing no time in assimilating.The film, the first feature to be co-directed by Leon Ichaso and Orlando Jimenez-Leal, is based on Ivan Acosta's play of the same name that was produced originally by the Cuban Cultural Center in New York in 1977. It will be presented in the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art today at 6 P.M. and Wednesday at 8:30 P.M. It is scheduled to have its commercial opening in New York in June.""El Super"" is not an especially political film, though it is concerned with working-class people who fled the revolution. Its most uninhibitedly comic character is a manic fellow named Pancho, a veteran of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, who is rabidly anti-Castro and everywhere sees Communist conspirators, including the loony man who pushes into Roberto's apartment one Sunday afternoon to preach Christ's Gospel.""El Super"" is much less about politics than it is about the disorientation of exiles who become living metaphors for the human condition. Such a person is Roberto, played with infinite good humor and common sense by Raymundo Hidalgo-Gato. The role, like the screenplay by Manuel Arce and Mr. Ichaso, is extremely well written as it avoids the usual impulse of such realistic drama to state in large, long speeches what it intends to be about. ""El Super"" works entirely within its characters and events.The film was obviously produced on a very low budget, but with care, intelligence and with a cast of marvelous Cuban and Puerto Rican actors. In addition to Mr. Hidalgo-Gato, they include Zully Montero as Aurelia, Reynaldo Medina as Pancho, and Elizabeth Pina as Aurelita.",1979-04-29T05:00:00+0000

Sleepless Nights is a novel, but it is novel in which the subject is memory and in which the I whose memories are in question is entirely and deliberately the author: we recognize the events and addresses of Elizabeth Hardwick's life not only from her own earlier work, but from the poems of her husband, the late Robert Lowell. We study in another light the rainy afternoons and dyed satin shoes and highschool drunkenness of the Kentucky adolescence, the thin coats and yearnings, toward home of the graduate years at Columbia, the households in Maine and Europe and on Marlborough Street in Boston and West 67th Street in New York. We are presented the entire itinerary, shown all the punched tickets and transfers. The result is less a story about or of a life than a shattered meditation on it, a work as evocative and difficult to place as Claude LeviStrauss's Tristes Tropiques, which it oddly recalls.

(Would critical opinion of the early color abstractions of Patrick Henry Bruce, say, be quite as high as it now is if we had not had a Arital contemporary movement in color abstraction? I doubt it.)

us,Film: Game Is a Symbol Of U.S. Life:The Cast,"The two young basketball players featured in ""The American Game,"" a feature-length documentary that opens today at Cinema II, have everything and nothing in common. Brian Walker comes from a white, gung-ho middleclass family in Indiana, with parents who are pushy about his career and an older brother who looks just like him; the brother, like Brian, is a basketball star. Stretch Graham, a black Brooklynite, lives in a housing project with his sister and sometimes wishes he hadn't played so much basketball, so that he could have spent more time with his mother before she died.Brian and Stretch are both high school seniors, both highly in demand and hounded by dozens of college recruiters. Both are as scared by their success as they are enthusiastic about the game. Both are exceedingly polite and quiet, not much accustomed to expressing their feelings through words. Both are, at least in the eyes of the basketball-watching populations of their communities, genuine heroes.But what other similarities do they really share? Beyond a certain point, the parallels between Brian and Stretch become vague, and ""The American Game"" is more adept at capitalizing on this than at trying to cast light upon it. The directors, Jay Freund and David Wolf, have simply juxtaposed biographical sketches of the two players and left room for the viewer to draw any number of conclusions, big or small.What does basketball tell us about American life? What does it suggest about American families or communities or the teams themselves? The film is too loosely structured to tackle such questions directly. Yet by profiling two players instead of only one it aspires to a certain degree of generalization. And by studying two instead of two hundred, it invites an audience to generalize on the basis of very limited information. In the end, the film hovers precariously between personality study and overview, never fully committing itself to either avenue of exploration.Brian Walker never comes through very clearly, but the townspeople of Lebanon, Ind., talk revealingly about how they view their basketball stars, and a hair-raising scene with Brian's parents shows how little voice the boy seems to have in decisions about his own future. Stretch's story, which is given equal time but seems a lot more interesting, is full of more complicated feelings about the game. Stretch's relationships with his coach, the coach's wife and his teammates is in a real-life ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" mold.""The American Game"" is best when it sticks to interview footage, and a little abrupt in the editing of its basketball sequences. People are constantly seen pretending to talk naturally, as if they didn't know there were a film crew underfoot, a tactic that becomes annoying after a while. Too much of the transitional material, with its blandly peppy music and emphasis on basketball fans having fun, looks and sounds like a soft-drink commercial.",1979-04-29T05:00:00+0000

The film will be presented in the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art on Wednesday at 6 P.M.""Manly Times"" is a once-upon-a-time tale about a mountain fellow who makes his living by kidnapping brides for clients who pay him well for his success. In this particular narrative, Banko, the matchmaker, a brawny, resourceful man of middle years, makes the mistake of falling in love with the already-promised bride, and she with him.The film is full of pretty mountain scenery, quaint costumes and customs, and predictable turns of event. The performances match the material. The leading roles are played by Grigor Vanchkov (Banko) and Marianna Dimitrova, who looks like a dark-woman he carries off for another man.
