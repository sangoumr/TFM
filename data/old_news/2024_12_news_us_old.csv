In 1942, at age 17, he moved to Manhattan, where he worked as a repairman in the diamond district before opening his own boutique on West 46th Street a few years later. In 1957, he produced his first animal bracelet: a gold cuff resembling a two-headed sea creature covered in diamonds and emerald cabochons that Richard Burton later bought as a gift for Elizabeth Taylor, his wife at the time. Inspired in part by Felix Sutton’s “The Big Book of Wild Animals” (1954) and the penannular wristbands of ancient Greece, which were often decorated at the ends with fauna motifs, Webb created a menagerie of golden accessories featuring frogs, monkeys, snakes, elephants and a zebra; a mid-1960s brooch took the form of a Lipizzaner horse with red enamel reins.",2024-12-02T10:00:34+0000

Two decades into his film career, he seems restless for new ways to express himself that don’t require a crew of hundreds or any of the baggage that comes with being one of the world’s most famous men. In recent years, he invented the recipe for a bastardized arancini-like dish called piccolini cuscino, or “little pillow” (“I got quite deep into it with a frozen-food manufacturer”); a nine-foot-long sofa with armrests as wide as the seat (“It weighs a ton — that’s probably one of the reasons it’s difficult to sell”); and pants with vertical pockets (“Why do they always have to be sticking out like weird little ears?”). He’s also been designing a straight-back chair with a slit running down the center of the cushion that “opens up for you like you’re in a kind of cocoon,” he says.

I gave the top slot to a project that strove mightily to unite a glossy sonic (and online) presence with surprising confessions. But song for song, the rest of the list can easily stand alongside it.

But when they married and moved into an apartment-cum-studio in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in 2022, they ended up making “almost everything we needed together, from cups to chairs,” says Irisa. One highlight: a piece they now call the Cascade Pendant, a ceiling light constructed from two interlocking pieces of American maple embedded with three ellipse-shaped lanterns crafted out of kozo, a highly prized mulberry-bark paper that they source from Shikoku, Japan. Inspired by kengai, a style of bonsai pruning in which branches are trained to grow in a downward direction, as well as by the couple’s shared Asian background (both are of Chinese heritage) and fascination with Japanese design, the pendant was, says Irisa, “a true collaboration because it’s better than what either of us could have done alone.” And so, after a year of planning, they decided to launch Kawabi, a collection of handmade lighting.",2024-12-05T10:03:32+0000

us,Anna Sui Shares Her Favorite Lipstick and Eyeliner,"I start out by washing my face with my line’s cleansers, the clearing oil and cleansing water. Then I use my plumping lotion; it has these gold specks in it and it really does something nice to your skin. I use Clearstem’s Hydraglow stem cell moisturizer before I put on my foundation, and then at night I’ll put on their Clearity serum with vitamin C and mandelic acid as well as their CellRenew serum. The beauty product most nostalgic to me is red lipstick. It’s something I started to wear once I moved to New York, because my mom didn’t let me wear lipstick as a teenager. I’ve been using Anna Sui Cosmetics the longest; we’re going on 25 years of that. We always do a red lipstick, number 400, that I wear. I also like the Nars lip pencil in Dragon Girl that I put underneath my lipstick. And I always wear my Perfect eyeliner. I use this eyeliner brush that’s Thierry Mugler, and it’s thick — it gives me that wide eyeliner look that I like. I wear my signature winged eyeliner everywhere, even when I go to the gym, even when I go to the drugstore. I love going to Bigelow [in the West Village] because they have a bubble bath that I like, Mistral in Lychee Rose Floral. I realize that bubble baths must not be popular now, because it’s really hard to find. But I like those bubbles. I guess from old movies, you always see the glamour pusses in the bathtub with all the bubbles. Garren New York, he’s cut my hair forever and nobody cuts hair like Garren. I get so many comments like, “You have such a great haircut.” I get my hair cut maybe three times a year, but I trim my own bangs in between with whatever scissors I have on hand. I wash my hair with R+C Television shampoo and conditioner or the Primary shampoo and conditioner and masque from their Bleu collection. I always use a Denman brush. Every time I go to London, I buy some from Boots. I also just bought a Dyson flat iron. I guess I copy my mom because she always wore fragrance, Chanel No. 5, and lipstick. I wear fragrance every day. I’ve been wearing our new Electric Whisper. I love the black currant and lychee, which give a slight fruitiness, but then the pink pepper patchouli and vetiver add a spiciness. And of course the hint of rose. Again to the gym, to the drugstore … it’s just natural for me to wear it all the time like my mom. The other thing I always wear is nail polish. My favorite color is Seafoam Green. I hate chipped nails, so I usually do my own, twice a week.",2024-12-05T10:06:18+0000

Growing up in Queens, he instead ate salade russe, a traditional Haitian recipe in which potatoes are combined with peas, onions and beets, which turn the dish bubble gum pink. Today, Gourdet serves his own take on that dish as part of the summer menu at his restaurant Kann in Portland, Ore., smoking the beets and binding the ingredients with creamy rémoulade. It’s just one of a number of variations on Russian potato salad, known as Olivier — which was created in 19th-century Moscow and now shows up everywhere from Sweden to Korea — currently appearing on restaurant menus. At Eel Bar on New York’s Lower East Side, the chef-partner Aaron Crowder, 39, makes what he describes as a “New York version of the Spanish version of Russian potato salad,” informed by the ensaladilla rusa served at tapas bars that often includes green olives and roasted red peppers. He tops his with orange trout roe. Tyler Akin, 41, the chef and a partner at the Mediterranean restaurant Bastia in Philadelphia, makes potato confit in chicken fat and then mixes it with saffron-spiked aioli and shavings of Sardinian bottarga. Potato salad, he says, “just so clearly wants to be served warm and soft,” like the bacon-flecked, mayo-free German-style version that his family favors.",2024-12-06T10:00:44+0000

Its central character, a 26-year-old aspiring poet, drifts through East Berlin’s anarchic underground squatter scene even as his parents abandon their home in Thuringia for a refugee camp in the West. All three find that freedom is a frustratingly vague concept, requiring constant improvisation. But what choice do they have, fleeing the ruins of an “abruptly obsolete, discontinued life”?",2024-12-11T10:00:27+0000

Johnson and Carvey are both excellent enough impressionists to carry a sketch, but within a minute, this one was making a different kind of joke: Carvey’s Biden gestured toward a fireplace and said, “I’m gonna sit here and smile, while ignoring the giant fire right behind me.” Part of why that got a laugh was the way it captured the stiltedness of the real-life photo op — but another was the way it gestured toward a decade-old internet meme, an image in which a wide-eyed dog placidly enjoys a cup of coffee in the midst of a raging house fire, calmly saying, “This is fine.” If you didn’t catch the reference, though, never fear: After the laugh break, Carvey spelled it out. “Just like the meme,” he said. “Can we put it up, side by side?” And then we saw the original meme in split screen with Carvey’s Biden, matching the dog’s posture, a kind of internet-poisoned tableau vivant. “This is fine,” Carvey intoned.",2024-12-17T10:02:55+0000

Now, a new line of three-in-one home, fabric and body sprays draws on Nguyen’s family history and her own early years in Orange County, Calif. One of the three scents, Dawn, which has hints of lemon, orange blossom and musk, is designed to capture the magic of 5 a.m. trips to the beach to watch the sunrise. Joy Ride, which has notes of sandalwood, white vetiver and leather, was inspired by excursions in the family’s Mercedes convertible. “My dad would be driving and my mom was in the front seat,” both dressed for work, says Nguyen. “Me and my sisters [were] in the back seat, messy and in T-shirts with the wind in our hair.” The final fragrance, Wedding, mixes frankincense and cedar and is intended to conjure, says Nguyen, “the ritual of going to church together.” Decorating the handmade Italian glass bottle is a wedding photo of her parents.
