The new fossils could revise thinking about how these dinosaurs evolved and how the positions of continents have changed since they died out more than 65 million years ago. Dr. Scott Sampson of the New York Institute of Technology, writing in the journal Science, said the discovery suggests that South America, India and Madagascar were all connected, probably through Antarctica, when this species developed, and that Africa had already split off as a separate island continent.

''This instinctual interest derived from the anal source passes over on to. . .the high valuation of gold and money,'' he explained.",1998-06-07T05:00:00+0000

Brave to match up an imperfect, man-made creation against one of nature's masterpieces; poignant to be so disenchanted with your fellow humans that a hillside seems your one and only friend. Both qualities were evident in Herman Melville's decision in 1852 to dedicate ''Pierre,'' his seventh novel, to the mountain that dominated the view from his study window at Arrowhead, the 18th-century farmhouse in Pittsfield, Mass., he had purchased two years before. Having dedicated his previous novel, ''Moby-Dick,'' to the American writer he valued most, his Berkshire neighbor Nathaniel Hawthorne -- having found Hawthorne's famous shyness nearly impossible to crack -- Melville may well have felt that he had no one human who could understand the wild, tormented novel he had just now completed.",1998-06-07T05:00:00+0000

He moved to the United States in the late 40's and obtained a Ph.D. in Biology from Yale University in 1953.

At Manhattan College, he concentrated his research on the reproductive processes of fern plants. He retired from Manhattan College in 1981 as a Professor of Biology. Also an expert on birds and their behavior, butterflies, mammals and other natural elements, he continued this work after retirement, taking particular interest in the fauna and flora of neighboring Van Cortlandt Park, where he tracked the appearance and disappearance of various species of plants and animals.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; A Different Drummer,"Laurie Gwen Shapiro's unfortunately titled but endearingly quirky first novel, THE UNEXPECTED SALAMI (Algonquin, $18.95), is a 1990's screwball comedy told in alternating chapters by two dysfunctional characters: a spoiled, neurotic, misanthropic New Yorker named Rachel Ganelli and her ''quasi boyfriend,'' Colin Dunforton, an aging Aussie bass player. While in Australia, rooming with the members of a less-than-talented band called the Tall Poppies, Rachel witnesses the apparent mob execution of the Poppies' heroin-addicted ex-drummer, Stuart, during the shooting of a rock video. When she runs back to New York to escape questioning (which would have tipped off the authorities to her long-expired visa), she is astonished to find the dead man ordering a tuna on rye at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop. It seems the ''hit'' was staged by the band in order to boost its sagging fortunes. And the scheme works. In no time at all, Colin and the Tall Poppies have a recording contract with a major label and are booked to tour the United States. Meanwhile, Stuart, friendless and going through withdrawal, is taken in by the Ganelli family: Rachel; her brother, Frank; their Jewish mother and Italian-American dad. Shapiro captures Rachel's voice and New York attitude well, and the slightly dim Colin's travails on the concert tour are described in a dead-on, testosterone-addled style. The plot twists its way through the band's ill-fated tour, Stuart's unlikely rehab and various couplings, most of them hilariously unsuccessful. The author manages to keep her disarmingly messy plot on the rails through many fast turns, and she skillfully avoids -- if barely, at times -- having it all sound too cute, a tough task with a cast of characters so perilously sit-com ready. Despite the risks, ''The Unexpected Salami'' winds up being unexpectedly delightful. Anthony Bourdain",1998-06-07T05:00:00+0000

A few of the photographs are dark, Weegee-inspired shots of crime scenes, urban street life and funerals.

Young gang members pose with their smiling children, or sit around the kitchen table with their mothers and sisters. Fellow gang members sit outside on the steps after school. ''East Side Stories'' is ultimately a profile of family, whether it is the nuclear family, the gang or the entire Mexican-American population in East Los Angeles. Various gangs are brought together in the book -- appropriately, because underneath the rivalries, they are all members of the same community; Rodriguez reminds us this community is also part of our country.

Owning a pet, say the authors, Michael Stern and Susan Cropper, puts people in touch with the rewards of attachment and the wonders of life, but also with the inevitability of death. Dr. Stern is a clinical psychologist who practices in Haworth and New York City, and Dr. Cropper is a home-visiting veterinarian based in Wycoff. Their book is an intelligent owner's manual, weighted as much toward issues like choosing a pet and using a vet as toward making the tough decision to end a pet's life. The book is especially good on the relationship between pets and the elderly, and pets and children. You'd expect as much from a book that includes dogs named Pooky and Pepper in the acknowledgments.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Cover Story,"For 30 years, Rolling Stone has been a barometer of popular culture and fashion. As the longest-surviving offspring of the counterculture of the 1960's and now as mainstream as Time or Newsweek, Rolling Stone has documented most of pop music's legends, often before they reached their eminence; in some cases the magazine even helped them earn such status. ROLLING STONE: The Complete Covers (Abrams, $39.95), a pantheon of many of the leading personalities in music, television, film and even politics, traces the lives and, sometimes, the demise of memorable and forgotten culture heroes. From the first issue, featuring a photograph of the young John Lennon in Richard Lester's film ''How I Won the War,'' to issue No. 773, featuring Tina Turner, Madonna and Courtney Love to illustrate three generations of ''Women of Rock,'' Rolling Stone's covers reveal the changing, and often the aging, faces of pop. The front and back covers of the book, respectively a 1978 photograph of Bob Dylan and a 1997 one of his son Jakob, underscore a somewhat disturbing (for us baby boomers) march of time as seen through the Rolling Stone lens. In addition to being a pop culture time line, this handsome book offers pithy anecdotes by Rolling Stone writers and photographers about their work, like this recollection by Annie Leibovitz about a January 1981 cover of a naked John Lennon draped in a fetal position over Yoko Ono: ''I remember arriving at the apartment that morning, Dec. 8, and John taking me aside and saying, 'Listen, I know they want to run me by myself on the cover, but I really want Yoko to be on the cover with me. It's really important.' . . . Several hours later John was murdered.'' Steven Heller",1998-06-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Soldier of Fortune,"Robert Poley, the narrator of Mike Nicol's fourth novel, THE IBIS TAPESTRY (Knopf, $23), is a South African writer who makes a good living cranking out political thrillers. But while Poley's career may be going well, his personal life is deeply troubled -- so when he's sent a mysterious laptop computer containing a single file, it seems an irresistible diversion. Who is Christo Mercer, author of the file (which contains a dreamlike story about a shellshocked African tapestry maker and the violent deaths of four young girls), and why was he killed? As Poley attempts to answer these questions, he is drawn into the underground world of gunrunning, which has been made even more tumultuous by the end of apartheid. Mercer, it turns out, supplied weapons to rebels and bandits all over Africa, and was himself a soldier in some of South Africa's nastier conflicts. But he was also a poet obsessed with Elizabethan literature, particularly Christopher Marlowe's ''Tamburlaine the Great.'' Thus Poley's investigation quickly becomes an engaging mix of academic criticism and gritty detective work. Complex, colorful and intricately layered, ''The Ibis Tapestry'' plays skillfully with truth and fiction to portray the landscape of a nation undergoing revolutionary change. Cast as a collection of texts and notes for a novel, the book moves from Africa to England and points in between, breathing life into a wide range of characters directly and indirectly affected by the elusive Mr. Mercer.

His wife & loving companion of fifty-six years, Bita & his son, Michael note with great sadness the passing of Francis Ferenc (Frank) Dobo Wednesday, June 3rd in his 90th year, after a protracted illness. Born Christmas Day, 1908 in Nagykanizsa, Hungary, to Dezso Dobo, M.D., and Aranka Weiss, cherished younger brother to Istvan, Frank Dobo grew to become the epitome of a 20th Century intellectual. A nephew of the celebrated rare book dealer Gabriel Wells, he was a close, lifelong friend of the renowned Hungarian Masters of candid black & white photography, Jules Halasz (a.k.a. Brassai), and Andre Kertesz, as well as noted novelists, Henry Miller, Celine and Raymond Queneau. Frank shared their halcyon days in early 1930's Paris and, as the latter's U.S. agent, he was instrumental in bringing Queneau's novels, including his celebrated ''Zazi Dans Le Metro'' to readers worldwide. His unquenchable thirst for and consumption of contemporary literature led Frank to hold numerous affiliated vocations over the course of his long life. Commencing as a stringer for the Opera Mundi Press Service and Paul Winkler's Agence Literaire in Paris, he then journeyed to New York City where he utilised his multi-linguistic talents to produce and direct radio broadcasts for the Office of War Information, (O.W.I.), with John Houseman, among others. He went on to hold executive positions with King Features Syndicate, Latham Press, Arno Press, (a publishing subsidiary of The New York Times), Eugene Fodor's/Shell Travel Guides U.S.A. and with his esteemed associate and friend, Michael Gladstone, at The Publishing Center For Cultural Resources. A patron of The New York Public Library and a genuine world citizen who once professed no other god than Johann Sebastian BAch, Frank Dobo was an individual who truly personified the maxim, ''Less is More.'' His passing leaves an irreparable hole in the hearts of his family and friends, who will miss his enduring intellect and wit, and leaves the international literary community much the poorer.

Eventually you'd pick up on smaller, possibly more significant things -- Sunday evening, for example, and how in many households as the hour of 9 approaches, the eating utensils are quickly and ceremoniously cleansed and stored and the younger offspring are clothed in loose-fitting cotton garments and then made to lie dormant in darkened chambers, while the elders and the proto-elders (many of them adorned with bits of metal on their teeth) drift into their communications centers, as if in answer to the eerie whistling music now emanating from their cathode-ray scopes, and for the next 60 minutes or so remain motionless, enraptured, while contemplating images of other earthlings engaged in negotiations with. . . aliens just like you, with the same long spatulate fingers, the same greenish ichor coursing through their cooling systems! In such a case, you'd probably conclude that you had arrived too late, and that the earthlings had already been colonized.",1998-06-14T05:00:00+0000

Six days earlier they had celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary in the church in London, England, where they were married. He was born on October 14, 1922, in Lenzie, Scotland, and educated at Stowe School, England, and Trinity College, Toronto. After service in the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II, he earned an M.A. in English at the University of Toronto, then joined his father's printing firm, Technical Charts, Inc. in Buffalo. In 1957 the company was reorganized as Graphic Controls Corporation, with Max as President, and became a publiclyheld company in 1965. In 1962 he was the first Canadian to be elected president of the Printing Industries Association of America. Belief in the social responsibility of the corporation led him to cofound the Allentown Community Center in 1971. In 1988, after it began to provide services to people outside Allentown, it was renamed the Clarkson Center for Human Services and is now one of the largest social agencies for job training, day care, and seniors services in Western New York State. It was one of his proudest achievements. In 1975 he brought his experience in business to academia and joined the Faculty of Management, University of Toronto, as Dean (1975-80) and continued as Professor until he retired in 1988. At the Faculty he instituted and taught pioneering courses in corporate values and business ethics. In 1989 he founded the Centre for Corporate Social Performance and Ethics at the Faculty. The Centre sponsored several international conferences on the emerging field of stakeholder theory. In 1997 The Conway Chair in Business Ethics was established and the Centre was renamed the Clarkson Centre for Business Ethics. In 1971 Mr. Clarkson cofounded the Niagara Institute, where he gave seminars to leaders from all parts of Canadian society on human values in organizational life. In 1987 he helped found the Public Policy Forum in Ottawa. Mr. Clarkson's pathbreaking research and publications in the field of business ethics won him wide acclaim and invitations to many international conferences. He was awarded honorary doctorates by St. Mary's University, Halifax, and the State University of New York at Buffalo. He is survived by his wife, Madeleine Earls, son, Max Adam, daughter Helene Edith, and son-in-law Andrew Livingston, all of Toronto; one sister, Lilian de Arias of London; and four brothers, William M.E. of Buffalo, Austin E. of Toronto, Geoffrey P.

Courageous in the face of daunting obstacles, thereby heightening her sensitivity to the pain in others, she left priceless legacies of love, compassion, caring words and actions, all done with a gentle heart. She demonstrated these acts many, many times, always ready to help another, whether family, friend, or even stranger. If she could help, she would. Honest, faithful & wise, she would listen intently &, most important, without criticism, before giving counsel. Mary had dark, sparkling eyes, with a true zest for living, & a spontaneous, genuine, sunny smile, radiating joy, warmth and merriment, which proved to be healing to others. She brought light to many with her generosity of spirit. We were so blessed to have known her, and it was our privilege to be her daughter and son-in-law. She will be forever cherished in our memories, and we will continue to be enriched by her inspiration in our lives. Memories are the treasures of the heart and balm for the soul.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Pulp Fiction,"Both the bullets and the gags fly fast and furious in Steve Aylett's hyperkinetically violent, hilarious time-traveling crime caper, SLAUGHTERMATIC (Four Walls Eight Windows, paper, $13.95). They strike targets both innocent and guilty: corrupt police officers, slimy lawyers, brutal hit men, computer hackers and that most hapless of modern comic figures, the mime. The slightly futuristic scene of this comic mayhem is Beerlight, a techno-Hobbesian city where life is nasty, brutish, short and wired, and where crime is ''the new and only art form.'' One of its up-and-coming masters is Dante Cubit, who, with his jittery pill-fueled partner, the Entropy Kid, executes an ingenious heist. Dante reprograms a bank vault time lock designed to send would-be robbers 20 minutes into the future, where they are already handcuffed and in police custody. Instead, he sends himself 20 minutes into the past and into the locked vault, which he will open when the Entropy Kid and the ''real time'' version of himself enter the bank again. The plan is for Dante to shoot his doppelganger -- but Dante Two survives, prompting an intense ''menhunt'' by Beerlight's brutal police, an opportunistic lawyer, a romantically motivated hit man and Rosa Control, Dante's well-armed girlfriend. The chase culminates in a surreal and potentially catastrophic encounter between the two Dantes. While the body count is high, the tone is anything but grim, thanks to Aylett's wickedly funny commentary on this bullet-riddled, nihilistic metropolis and its inhabitants. But be warned: the mime doesn't survive. Michael Porter",1998-06-21T05:00:00+0000

This time the chemicals will be sprayed on a non-edible monoculture and from there to the soil and water.

Morozumi's spare text and her luscious pictures will move just about any preschooler from giggles to sadness to a measure of understanding about how good friends are always a part of us. Adults may get teary-eyed. When a gorilla comes to live with the zookeeper's family, the zookeeper's son is at first scared of the huge creature who sleeps on his bottom bunk. But the gorilla is nice, and soon the boy has a new friend. Together boy and gorilla go to the park, read books and dream in the trees. The gorilla even goes to the boy's birthday party, where he is the largest guest. Then the cold weather comes, and it is time for the gorilla to go back to Africa. The boy cries when he says goodbye. He stays sad until a letter comes one day with a picture of the gorilla in the African jungle. The gorilla has a baby on his back! He looks happy, and so the boy is happy too. ''I still remember him,'' the boy says on the last page, gazing out his window, looking past the gorilla's photograph on the sill. Thumbtacked to the wall is a picture the boy has drawn of himself and his friend, holding hands. Everyone will adore the illustrations; the best is of the gorilla sitting at the boy's birthday table alongside nonchalant little girls in party dresses. Friends, of course, don't have to look at all like us. Elisabeth Bumiller",1998-06-21T05:00:00+0000

Fitch took his own life in 1798, penniless and surpassed by savvier and and better-financed steamboat entrepreneurs like Robert Fulton. Perhaps it is fitting that a stone monument to Fitch in Trenton, where he lived and worked in the years before the Revolutionary War, should have a similarly topsy-turvy fate. In 1921, a boulder was dredged from the Delaware River and dedicated to Fitch, near the site in Trenton where his steamboat docked on trips from Philadelphia. In 1963 the monument seemingly disappeared, coincidentally during improvements to John Fitch Parkway in Trenton, now simply known as Route 29. The monument was eventually found in a pile of weeds nearby.

Now, in Smith Field Park in Parsippany, there stands a 13-foot bronze sculpture to honor Wallenberg: ''Courage and Compassion,'' created by Edward M. Adams, a sculptor and painter who works in Lambertville. He explains the form as ''inspired by the sight of tree limbs bending in the cold of winter.'' The trees, naked and waiting for spring, are like the Jews of wartime Europe, he says, waiting for signs of hope. The twisted metal took on the form of a heart, which can be seen as either broken or healing. Mr. Adams was selected for the monument by a committee formed in Parsippany in 1989 to honor Wallenberg.

The easy explanation is El Nino, a perverse weather system that has flooded some regions but left others bone dry. But the main culprit, as always, is human activity, chiefly logging, mining and agriculture, which dries out the forest by stripping it bare of trees, leaving even humid tropical rain forests vulnerable to fire.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The Little People,"Victorian fairy painting might sound like just the thing to send you nodding off to never-never land. However, VICTORIAN FAIRY PAINTING (Merrell Holberton/University of Washington, $40), a collection of essays on fairies in Victorian music, literature, ballet, theater and book illustration, is as powerful an inducement to fancy as the opium that inspired a number of the paintings. Victorians were haunted by the fairies of Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' and of European folklore (rediscovered by the Romantics) largely because fairyland offered a warped mirror in which their era's concerns could be reflected. Rural superstitions about an uninhibited tiny people, over whom flowers towered and gravity's laws held no sway, provided a charming antidote to unsettling advances in scientific understanding and industrialization. For artists and writers, the imagination's powers were vindicated by the notion of a kingdom that only the inner eye could see (though misguided attempts were made to verify fairyland through the new eye of photography). Nearly every British painter of the period attempted descriptions of this fantastic landscape and its inhabitants. Some, like J. M. W. Turner, were merely dabbling (a fairy band appears almost as an afterthought near the bottom of his ''Queen Mab's Cave''). Others, like Richard Dadd, a schizophrenic institutionalized after killing his father, found a subject matter well suited to psychedelic extremes of proportion and detail. Dadd's dark, closely observed masterpieces realize the potential of a genre that was for some artists merely an excuse to drape nymphs in gossamer. The best of these paintings belie the insipidity of later, more familiar renderings of fairyland. Like the Victorian era itself, they are far more complicated and ambiguous than is commonly remembered. Sarah Harrison Smith",1998-06-21T05:00:00+0000

Much loved by family, by colleauges and by generations of students whom he inspired to the same high standards he demanded of himself. At Yale where he studied organ and theory, he was first introduced to early music in Paul Hindemith's legendary collegium. For many years thereafter, he was the keyboard player of the New York Pro Musica, the pioneer American early music ensemble whose many tours and recordings first brought the beauty of this music to audiences world wide. His prize winning solo recordings of French and English harpsicord and organ music were among the achievements of those years. In 1964 he came to Queens College to establish and direct an early music program. Many gifted young musicians who first encountered this music in the Vocal Ensemble and instrumental Collegium under Paul Maynard have carried the vitality and richness of his performing tradition into their own professional lives. In 1970 he took a leave from the college to direct Pro Musica. Among the events of his two years as director were the International Josquin Festival of 1971 (the only American ensemble to take part) and the ''Founding Artists'' series during the Kennedy Center's opening year in which they were the sole early music ensemble. The integrity and sensitivity of his work with the talented professionals of Pro Musica were at the service of the students upon his return to the college, inspiring the student groups to peak after peak of achievement. His own solo harpsicord and organ perfomrmances of Bach as well as his work with the students reflected his intensity, humility and passionate love for all music. His musical credo is best stated in his introduction to the ''Anthology of Early Renaissance Music'' (co-authored with Noah Greenberg): ''The greatest creative musicians of all periods are on the same level and the performance of all of their music deserves the very best we can give.'' He did, and he remains a beacon for all who were fortunate enough to work with him and hear his music making. He is survived by his wife of 28 years, Drora Pershing, two sons, David of Ballston Spa, NY, and Philip of Ridley Park, PA, three step-children, Stephen Pershing of Alexandria, VA, Jonathan Pershing of Kensington, MD, and Ruth Pershing of Chapel Hill, NC, two grandchildren and three stepgrandchildren. A memorial gathering will be held on Saturday, June 27, at 3 PM, at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 W. 64 St, NYC.

With the death at 72 of John Hawkes -- fiction writer, fiction mentor and fiction live reader extraordinaire -- we lost one of the steadily brightest (and paradoxically darkest) lights of American letters through our century's second half, a navigation star for scores of apprentice writers however different their own literary course, and as spellbinding a public reader of his own work as I have ever heard. Passion was this writer's subject, even when manifested by nonhuman characters (the narrator-protagonist of his novel ''Sweet William'' is a horse; the deuteragonist of ''The Frog'' is a very French amphibian); impassioned was his manner as author, teacher, reader and friend. He was, to echo another of his titles, truly a Passion Artist: for five decades one of our most original literary imaginations and masterly prose stylists.",1998-06-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; You Say Potato, I Say Kartoffel","The unnamed narrator of the German novelist Uwe Timm's MIDSUMMER NIGHT (New Directions, $23.95) is a novelist with writer's block. So when he's asked to write a magazine article about potatoes, he accepts, hoping to shake his torpor. But his research trip from Munich to post-reunification Berlin, where he wants to retrieve a potato scholar's archive, is as bizarre as his subject is banal. Entering the former eastern sector, he is swindled by a hawker of fake leather jackets, abused by a cabby and given a really bad haircut. Timm's sendup of reunification is fun -- some walls, it seems, never come down -- but that's not his theme. He's more interested in exploring what happens when two opposing political cultures, both of which have stifled self-expression, are suddenly mixed. What results, if his portrait is any indication, is a restless flux -- a midsummer night's dream. This is a Berlin whose Reichstag Christo has just wrapped in a canvas cocoon and whose citizens, shaken up by the Zeitgeist, are reinventing themselves: a linguistics scholar is forging Russian Constructivist paintings; a husband has bidden goodbye to his wife and taken up with a djellaba-clad Bedouin. And as the increasingly befuddled narrator pursues his quest, the potato emerges as the symbol of this flux. How? Credit Timm's puckish conceptual artistry and his brewmeister style of letting a story ferment unhindered. ''Midsummer Night,'' as translated by Peter Tegel, is a picaresque comedy that is also, unobtrusively and astutely, a novel of ideas. Bill Christophersen",1998-06-28T05:00:00+0000

The City College crowd helped chart postwar America's ideological frontier; like many of his classmates, Glazer journeyed steadily rightward for decades, from Trotskyist to social democrat to neo-conservative. But lately, Glazer has begun to adopt -- though scarcely embrace -- some strikingly liberal positions. This spring, Glazer wrote in The New Republic that without affirmative action, hardly any blacks would gain admission to top colleges; and that, he argued, would ''undermine the legitimacy of American democracy.'' Glazer seemed resigned rather than enthusiastic, but it was nonetheless a startling reversal from a scholar who two decades earlier wrote ''Affirmative Discrimination,'' a stinging critique of racial (and other) preferences.",1998-06-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Machine Dreams,"Once considered a member of modernism's ''minor aristocracy,'' Fernand Leger (1881-1955) is now receiving deserved attention as a modern master -- ''the only major painter of his generation'' to take modernity itself ''as his subject,'' as Carolyn Lanchner writes in FERNAND LEGER (Museum of Modern Art/Abrams, $60), a compilation of three stimulating essays and 209 illustrations, 66 in color. Exploring the nature and effects of Leger's interactions with American patrons, artists and spaces, Lanchner, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, argues that his art shared with popular culture the ''equation of the machine, the modern and the American.'' In cities like New York and Chicago, Leger's fascination with mass culture could find fulfillment. Jodi Hauptman, who teaches art history at the University of Delaware, further investigates Leger's notion of urban ''spectacle and speed'' as ''an art of dynamic divisionism,'' and she compares and contrasts Leger's expressions of the city with those of several contemporary artists. Matthew Affron, who teaches art history at the University of Virginia, uses Leger's own term ''new realism'' to characterize ''the new visual state imposed by the evolution of the new means of production.'' Leger intended this new realism to relate painting to the social world, primarily that of the working class; he aimed to show the beauty of the modern object to the people. The reproductions in ''Fernand Leger'' show that his art went beyond Cubist shapes, primary colors and machine imagery; his merging of Cubist stasis with undulating volume can only be called masterly.

Perrault's submission (pictured, center) was called ''Emerging Remission.'' In it, blackness merges into green meadows, blue sea and an aura of white.

Bartlett Tree Expert Company of Stamford, CT, was born in Stamford, CT, on October 11, 1917. He was the son of the late Francis A. and Myrtle K. Bartlett. Following graduation from the Irving School, Tarrytown, NY, he attended the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, later transferring to the business school at Columbia University. He joined the family business in 1937 and, a year later, was instrumental in coordinating efforts to restore damaged landscapes in the aftermath of the great 1938 hurricane. Mr. Bartlett enlisted in the U.S. Army in June 1941, six months before Pearl Harbor, becoming a specialist in military equipment and supplies as well as a graduate of the military intelligence school. He saw action in the South Pacific, including the New Guinea and Philippines campaigns. He rose to the rank of staff sergeant and was awarded the Soldier's Medal for Bravery for risking his life to rescue a pilot from a burning aircraft. Resuming his career with the Bartlett Company, he was successively named Vice President, a director, Executive Vice President, President, Vice Chairman and, in 1975, Chairman and CEO. A lifelong arborist, he counted among his most rewarding accomplishments the establishing of two major arboreta, the Bartlett Arboretum of the State of Connecticut in Stamford and the working arboretum located on the property of the Bartlett Tree Research Laboratories and Experimental Grounds in Charlotte, NC. He received a Special Achievement Award from the National Arbor Day Foundation, the Conservation Medal of the DAR, the Founder's Plaque of the Mountain Lake Vegetation Management Council, 1991 Man of the Year Award of Arbor Age Magazine and the 1997 Award of Merit of the National Arborist Association.
