The upstairs rooms are closed and not heated in winter, but we leave the bathroom door open. The thermostat is set for 68 degrees downstairs during the day and 60 at night, and we have steam heat. Can you suggest a solution? A.You probably need more ventilation upstairs, and at least a little heat in cold weather. The inside of the outside walls gets so cold that moisture in the air condenses and forms droplets. Keeping the rooms and walls a little warmer will help prevent this. Circulating more air, perhaps by opening windows slightly every couple of days, when the outside air is dry, will also help. Q.The white aluminum siding on my house was apparently installed about 28 years ago, before I moved in. This siding is becoming increasingly discolored, especially on the north side, and less so just under the roof overhang on the three other sides. I have tried vigorous scrubbing and washing with a chlorine bleach, to little avail. A cleaning service said it didn't expect much improvement from a professional washing. If I paint the siding, I would have to repaint every few years. Do you have any other suggestions? A.I'm afraid not. Because cleaning doesn't help, the paint must have oxidized or changed color (yellowed), perhaps from fumes in the air or aging.",1986-04-03T05:00:00+0000

The small, delicate creature defies the odds, emerging pink or blue or white amid patches of gritty soil and in window boxes cornered in perpetual shade. This weekend these hardy flowers will receive due recognition in ''April Showers, City Flowers.'' On display will be hundreds of flowers and plants that thrive in urban settings, such as geraniums, African violets, daffodils, lilies of the valley, tulips and azaleas. Numerous horticultural groups will exhibit their collaborations with nature, including the Pit Society, which specializes in urban vegetables, the Begonia Society and the Cacti and Succulent Society. The show will also feature educational displays for gardeners on overcoming the constraints of window sills, flower boxes, tree beds, courtyards and indoor lighting. A few types of flowers will be on sale. The show, sponsored by Village Visiting Neighbors, is open today from 1 to 9 P.M. and tomorrow from 11:30 A.M. to 8 P.M. at Public School 41 on Avenue of the Americas at 11th Street.

Moscow, the officials say, is seeking to make nuclear arms control the focal point, as was largely the case during the Nixon and Carter Administrations. The Reagan Administration, they say, is resisting this narrow focus and wants equal attention for settlement of regional disputes such as Afghanistan and Angola and for human rights issues. [ Page 1, Column 6. ] The Soviet Union told the U.S. that it was ready to discuss the date for its foreign minister to go to Washington for talks expected to center on the next Soviet-American summit meeting, Reagan Administration officials said. Moscow delayed its expected announcement for months. [ 1:5. ] The T.W.A. explosion inquiry seems to center on two questions: Who was the woamn who sat in seat 10F on an earlier leg of the plane's journey and did she plant the bomb that later exploded under the seat? Some of the investigators among the Greeks, Egyptians, Italians and Americans believe that the passenger might be a woman with a Lebanese passport who traveled under the name of May Elias Mansur.

The company began with ballets by Mr. Mitchell, its founder and director, that were tailored to its young needs, with evocative ethnic-flavored romps, and with classical standard-setting ballets by George Balanchine. There was a Balanchine work -''Stars and Stripes'' - on Thursday's program at City College's Aaron Davis Hall, and it was danced with a light-hearted appreciation of the ballet's pizazz. But the two dances that made up the balance of the program, acquired more recently, took the company in new directions. ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' is a narrative ballet by Valerie Bettis that serves as a showcase for the vivid but easy dramatic sounds that are an indentifying chracteristic of the company. And in David Gordon's ''Piano Movers,'' new last season, Dance Theater has a first and fashionable post-modernist piece.",1986-04-06T05:00:00+0000

(Ages 4 to 7) WHEN I was growing up, I knew lots of children who hated their names. I certainly hated mine. ''It's a lovely name,'' my mother told me. '' 'Grave Alice' is from Longfellow's ''Children's Hour.'' Since I felt I had to live up to my name, I wished she had chosen ''Laughing Allegra.'' My problem was minor compared to Fluffy's! His proud parents rejected names like Spike and Lance and Needleroozer - any of which would have been easier for a porcupine to live up to. But oh, no. ''Let's call him Fluffy.'' they say. ''It's such a pretty name.'' And it doesn't take Fluffy long to realize that he isn't. ''He first became suspicious when he backed into a door and stuck fast. That was not a fluffy thing to do.'' So he tries to live up to his name. But it's not easy being a cloud when you're a porcupine - it's hard to stay up. And it's dangerous to pretend you're a fluffy pillow. ''When his mother sat on him, she was not pleased.''",1986-04-06T05:00:00+0000

It is also plentiful in yeast, liver and mushrooms. Folate is present in most foods, in fact, but it is destroyed by heating and other forms of processing.

THE sharp and seasoned good humor Stanley Kunitz brings to the poems, essays, interview and aphorisms in ''Next-to-Last Things'' is a tonic in our literary life. Mr. Kunitz, who is now 80 years old, was remarkably prescient about his own eventual reputation when he once wrote of E. E. Cummings that ''more than any other poet of his generation Cummings cherished and nurtured the image of himself as poet. . . . In a society of gladhanders and backslappers and self-advertisers he insisted not so much on his own uniqueness as on his right to be unique.'' The work of a much battered, ceaselessly active veteran of around 60 years of effort to keep bright his own and the world's esteem for poetry, this brief new book is strikingly youthful. A maxim in the section ''Seedcorn and Windfall'' puts it nicely: ''Be prepared for everything - even spontaneity.''",1986-04-06T05:00:00+0000

One reason: Most states have switched to ''gender neutral'' language to avoid unlawfully discriminating against men on the basis of sex. In addition, men have more money to foot the enormous bill.

Answer:Passengers certainly can fly around the world, with unlimited stopovers, at a price that is lower than the regular cost of a global trip. The low-cost tickets, which come with some restrictions, cost from about $2,099 in economy to $5,399 in first class, depending on which airlines are used. They are advance-purchase fares, which usually have to be bought 21 days ahead of departure. The regular fares, which carry few if any restrictions, are at least $1,000 more in economy or first. Most major international airlines sell cheaper round-the-world tickets under a joint arrangement with other airlines with which they have aligned. With the joint ticket, passengers are limited to two carriers in one group of airlines. They transfer from one airline to the other when the first's route ends and the second's begins. Travelers with more money to spend will ask an airline to construct a route using any number of airlines, and therefore enjoy greater flexibility in routing.",1986-04-06T05:00:00+0000

It has been almost 15 years since New York state troopers charged through clouds of tear gas, their guns blazing, to retake the state prison at Attica from the rebellious inmates who had held it at knifepoint for five days. The troopers' gunfire made it clear to those outside the rain-streaked upstate New York prison walls that there would be casualties. In short order it would also become clear that the troopers who had reclaimed the prison on Sept. 13, 1971, used deadly force, killing 29 inmates and 10 hostages and wounding 89 others. Malcolm Bell, a former member of the state-appointed Attica investigation and prosecution team, has written ''The Turkey Shoot,'' a flawed but informative book about the riot and its aftermath. Attica has fallen into the creases of modern history; it is too recent to be included in textbooks and too long ago to be sharply remembered. Sections of Mr. Bell's book about the police assault on the prison will acquaint new readers with events that will always be a bloodstain on law and justice in America. He makes a good case that the state police covered up the crimes of their own. Mr. Bell's book is not a scholarly work. In this first-person account, he attempts to make a cover-up case against his former colleagues in the Attica investigation. He claims that the investigation was turned away from po-lice crimes to protect Governor Rockefeller, who ordered the retaking of Attica, and who at the time was seeking confirmation as Vice President of the United States. Mr. Bell made the same charges publicly in 1975 and sparked another state investigation, whose members thanked him but found his allegations unfounded.",1986-04-06T05:00:00+0000

This work by the poet, playwright and novelist Ntozake Shange focuses on a 13-year-old black girl, Betsey Brown, who lives with her large, eccentric family in St. Louis in 1959, as the city is embarking on school desegregation. Nancy Willard said in The Book Review last year that Miss Shange ''is a superb storyteller'' who ''has an extraordinary ear for the spoken word.'' This novel, she said, ''creates a place that is both new and familiar, where both black and white readers will feel at home.'' THE TRUE CONFESSIONS OF AN ALBINO TERRORIST, by Breyten Breytenbach. (McGraw-Hill, $5.95.) In 1975 Breyten Breytenbach, the pre-eminent living Afrikaans poet, was sent to prison under South Africa's Terrorism Act on a trumped-up charge of plotting to blow up a monument to his native language. ''They took seven years from him, and he has now struck back with a volume that seems to have been ripped from his entrails,'' our reviewer, Joseph Lelyveld, said of this memoir in 1985. The book, he said, is ''mocking and sensitive, offhand and bombastic, mystical and raging'' and is ''an important contribution to a corpus of South African prison literature that has been steadily, painfully accumulating over the last quarter-century.'' SHAKESPEARE'S DOG, by Leon Rooke. (Ecco Press, $8.50.) This humorous, revisionist look at Shakespeare's pre-London days is told from the point of view of his best friend - Hooker, his dog.

But some analysts said Mr. Bush would not have spoken out so strongly unless there was some backing to his remarks.

For Mr. Segovia, the guitar was a stately vessel through which a composer's inspiration could flow directly to the heart. But to much of the musical world he hoped to conquer, it was a crude, folk instrument. Mr. Segovia has fought his battle on many fronts. At 93, he continues to give concerts - in fact, he is performing at Avery Fisher Hall on Wednesday.

Whether you can turn off heat to two rooms depends on how your system is set up. Usually the convectors are part of a continuous piping system that goes from one room to the next, so you cannot shut off part without shutting off everything. However, some systems have separate valves for each room so they can be shut off. You should ask your plumber to check. If you have no such valves he may be able to install them (again, depending on how the system is set up).",1986-04-10T05:00:00+0000

From time to time he glances up from his reading and out the window in order to exercise a different set of eye muscles. He can see birds, clouds in the distance and a little bit of New Jersey. ''Once I saw a hawk kill a pigeon,'' he said. ''Of course, I may have made it up.'' Mr. Brodkey, whose short stories appear in The New Yorker, has two other reading spots - a wing chair, if he is feeling formal, and an early 19th-century country bed, if he is tired. He prefers to read by natural light or in the ''clouds of light'' produced by high-intensity halogen lamps. To ease his back, he tries to remember to vary his reading position at the end of each chap>ter. ''But I like being prone and holding the book up,'' he says.

An early warning system - unknown to science, but none the less effective for that - takes care of it. As for what to reread, that too is easy, except that the list gets longer every year. (The American expatriate writer Logan Pearsall Smith wanted the words ''Thrice did he read Saint-Simon'' to be put on his tombstone, so rare was the boast.) But where to read? To that question all answers are personal, and reveal something of our inmost nature. It is my own feeling - once again, unsanctioned by science - that in this matter there is such a thing as a primal posture. Anyone who has been around clever children will have noticed that when they settle in to read they instinctively lie flat on the floor, fronts down.

Attrition has effected changes in the cast and the age total, but the personnel remain venerable and talented. The dancers are the Original Hoofers, who are sometimes a quartet but on this occasion are a quintet made up of Chuck Green, Lon Chaney, George Hillman, Ralph Brown and the gliding septuagenarian Jimmy Slyde. The musicians are the Legends of Jazz, a group organized in 1972 by the British-born drummer and aficionado of New Orleans jazz, Barry Martyn. It currently includes a relatively young and superbly brash trombonist from New Orleans, Freddy Lonzo, along with Herbert Permilion on trumpet, Floyd Turnham on clarinet, Walter Lewis on piano, and two longterm members, Benny Booker on bass and Mr. Martyn on drums, and a young Georgia-bred singer, Deborah Woodson. The show is at 3 P.M. Sunday. Tickets are $14, $12 and $10.",1986-04-11T05:00:00+0000

Hanging on that slight premise are some predictable proceedings. The impostor falls for a pretty police officer (Meg Tilly) who has resolved not to marry a cop. Should he tell or shouldn't he? As soon as we learn that Miss Tilly's specialty is ''hostage negotiation,'' it's a fair guess that the climactic scene will have hostages in it. Indeed so, and with the help of quirky performances by Harvey Keitel and Victor Argo, the conclusion has an offbeat quality missing from most of ''Off Beat.''",1986-04-11T05:00:00+0000

Where could a country visitor to Prohibition-era Louisville, Ky., get his hands on a pint of whisky during a family emergency? Why would an elderly hill farmer deliberately venture so far down into a wooded gorge that he has to crawl out inch by inch at the risk of his life? How does a scrupulously honest small-town lawyer preserve what he knows is the true intention of a friend whose notion of a binding codicil is a ''slow, crooked legend'' in a tattered pocket notebook that says: ''Wheeler see the boy has his place''? These are some of the central considerations of Wendell Berry's six interconnected stories in this leisurely and engaging collection. In ''Thicker Than Liquor'' young Wheeler Catlett, just married and admitted to the bar, travels to Louisville to retrieve improvident Uncle Peach from his annual binge in the city. It is a hilarious and revealing odyssey through stockyards, train depots, fleabag hotels and hole-in-wall speak-easies. Later in his career, Wheeler has more complex commitments to honor. In a tale called ''It Wasn't Me,'' and again in the title story, his task is to unravel the underlying design of wills written to maintain the ''membership'' of a tight local network of relatives, friends and neighbors dedicated to one another and to their farms. Best known as an accomplished essayist, Mr. Berry sometimes slows down the narrative drive of his fiction with lengthy genealogies, anecdotes and explanations.",1986-04-13T05:00:00+0000

Sextus Empiricus, who flourished circa A.D. 190 (it gets put that way, though his tone seems not that of a flourisher) was a physician whose three volumes of ''Pyrrhonean Sketches'' tended to reduce all knowledge to ashes. For centuries he seemed an amusing spoilsport. But the signs that Swift read him in the 1680's go with other ominous signs, notably the popularity in those years of languages designed on the drawing board, never spoken by human lips, never stammered by babes, and thus inert to the skeptical acids. Such languages will contain no terms to which meaning cannot be assigned, since the terms will be produced not in the usual careless way, but at the inflexible behest of the meanings themselves.

Have the theorists of war exercised much direct or indirect influence on the battlefield, or has their impact been overshadowed by that of the makers and wielders of weapons? Two hundred years ago, when resources were limited -both in numbers and kind - and goals no less so, and when the science of warfare was in its infancy, the answer to both these questions was fairly straightforward. Princes and generals were the big players in the war game; the most skillful practitioner won the laurels and intellectual application mattered little. Voltaire thought war a chancy business and regarded soldiering as one of a pair of bloody professions that had yet to come of age. ''The art of medicine, like that of war,'' he pronounced, ''is murderous and conjectural.''",1986-04-13T05:00:00+0000

In the years since the prosecution of Lieut. Col. Adolf Eichmann, chief of the Jewish section of the Gestapo and the man responsible for Nazi concentration camps that administered the ''Final Solution,'' it has been not so much his conviction, or even his execution, but rather his capture in Argentina and trial in Israel that continue to be debated by scholars and international lawyers. Indeed, when each week brings new reports of human rights violations, bombings and hijackings, the issues raised by the Eichmann case seem as fresh as today's headlines. What can one nation do to change the internal policies of another? Can a terrorist be seized, like Eichmann, and transported for trial? Why does international law seem so ineffective? Last weekend, at a forum organized by the Jewish Museum in New York, these issues were discussed by a panel that included Louis Henkin, University Professor at Columbia University; Marvin E. Frankel, a former Federal judge and chairman of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights; Abraham D. Sofaer, another former judge who is legal adviser to the State Department, and Telford Taylor, former chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials and a professor at Benjamin Cardozo Law School.

Near those French Creek falls, in 1778, a Continental lieutenant named Arthur Carrington was trapped by redcoats as he foraged for food for George Washington's army. He hid in a cave, but gunfire dislodged boulders that sealed him in. His skeleton was found a century later by quarrymen who opened the cave. They also found a letter inside a bottle. Addressed to his sweetheart in Virginia, who died in 1780 of a broken heart, it told of his own long, slow death. Or so the legend says. Today, it's a peaceful spot. A Victorian inn, called the Inn at St. Peters, stands by the falls, and a few feet away fishermen cast their lines. In the inn's dining room, under a canopy of evergreens and hardwoods, you can eat fresh poached salmon or fettucini Alfredo, and wonder at the region's myths, legends and very real present-day allure.",1986-04-13T05:00:00+0000

I do not know when the building was built, but would like to know its status in regards to rent-stabilization or rent-control laws . . . C. B., Port Washington, L.I. Answer: According to Thomas R. Viola, spokesman for the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, in Nassau, Rockland and Westchester Counties, each municipality has the option of adopting the rent-stabilization or rent-control codes as they are written in the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974. According to Mr. Viola, Port Washington is not among the Nassau County towns or villages that have so far adopted the rent-regulation measures. Taking a Roommate Question: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment and I am considering taking a roommate. Is there a rule I must follow in order to calculate the monthly rent or am I allowed to charge whatever I feel is reasonable, taking into account the use of my furniture, appliances, utilities, etc. Also, must the landlord be advised of my intentions? . . . R. C., Manhattan Answer: The regulations that pertain to rent-stabilized units do not restrict the Michael Bartalos amount of rent a tenant occupying such a unit can charge a roommate.

This biography follows the playwright from his Mississippi boyhood to his death in New York in 1983. Frank Rich said here last year that although Tennessee Williams himself is an elusive presence in the book, and it reveals few surprises, Donald Spoto ''does reconcile conflicting versions of events, add footnotes and flesh out familiar anecdotes with fresh, if mostly unexamined, observations from surviving Williams friends.'' Plume/New American Library has reissued TENNESSEE: CRY OF THE HEART ($8.95), by Dotson Rader, who knew Williams. Mr. Rich found it a ''slapdash but entertaining memoir,'' a mix of gossip, confessions and ''strident self-promotion.'' However, ''the pathos of Williams's decline does seep through.'' MEN AND ANGELS, by Mary Gordon. (Ballantine, $4.50.) Anne Foster, the heroine of Mary Gordon's third novel, is an art historian whose husband has gone abroad for a year, leaving her to resume her interrupted career and to cope with the strange misgivings she feels about the fanatically religious young woman she has hired as a mother's helper. In these pages last year Margaret Drabble said the book's ''rich, informal, imagery-packed prose beautifully reveals the poetry of domesticity. . . . It disturbs, rather than reassures, for it demonstrates that family life itself, that safest, most traditional, most approved of female choices, is not a sanctuary: it is, perpetually, a dangerous place.''

Perhaps because these centers are among those most actively run with student participation they are the ''in'' places on campus, with popular restaurants and bars, well-attended dances and other activities contributing to student well-being. 1: University of Texas Union, at Austin. This supercenter, with Texas-size bar, is the leader in student-run activities and organizations, 575 of them, and home of such drinkeries and eateries as Dillingham's Pasture and Steer Here. 2: Wilson Commons of the Universtiy of Rochester. An I.M. Pei building whose atrium sports 18,000 square feet of glass and Florida trees complete with lizards. Three tons of fudge are sold here annually. 3: Indiana Memorial Union, at Indiana University in Bloomington. The world's largest student union, with 475,000 square feet. Art and antiques abound. A city under one roof. 4: Aztec Center at San Diego State University. It offers access to the most extensive collegiate waterfront facility in the world, on Mission Bay, with boats, tanned student lifeguards, and, recently, a sign reading ''76 degrees air and 66 degrees water -- another bland day in paradise.'' 5: K-State Union at Kansas State in Manhattan.

''The Private Life of Axie Reed'' also takes place against a backdrop of wealth and privilege -most of it is set in Southampton, L.I. - but it surprisingly evinces none of Mr. Knowles's usual gifts. The book is obvious, poorly written and perfunctory in both tone and execution.

us,Q&A,"Q. We are moving to a rural home and would like to put up a roadside mailbox. How should we do this? How deep should the post hole be and should there be gravel at the bottom of the hole? A. For solid support the post hole should go down to the frost line (usually 30 or 36 inches). There should be about three inches of gravel on the bottom of the hole to promote drainage. The post, which should be made of pressure-treated lumber or should be soaked in preservative, rests on this gravel, and concrete is then poured in to fill the hole. To hold the post in position while pouring the concrete, use temporary braces nailed to opposite sides of the post. The lower end of each brace should be nailed to a temporary stake driven into the ground a few feet away. Q. My family room and one of my bathrooms share a common wall. Every time the toilet is flushed or water is run you can hear it clearly in the family room. What remedy can you suggest? A. Putting insulation inside the wall spaces might help, but not much. Your best bet is to put up an extra stud partition wall in the family room, a couple of inches in front of the existing wall and not physically attached to it. The space between the two walls is then filled with unfaced fiberglass blankets or batts to help absorb sounds, and the partition is covered with 1/2-inch- or 5/8-inch-thick gypsum board. Q.

Sixties nostalgia wafts like a cloud of Aquanet through ''Beehive,'' a light-hearted revue that looks back with fond amusement at the changing image of women in 60's pop, from the girl groups to Janis Joplin. The show, which takes its name from the vintage hairdo, has been fine-tuned since it opened last year at Sweetwater's, and is now set inside a giant glowing jukebox. Softening the decade's politics while emphasizing its frivolity, ''Beehive'' seamlessly blends nostalgic kidding with powerful vocal remembrances of Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner and others by its six-woman cast. What ''Grease'' did for the 50's, ''Beehive'' does for the go-go decade, as it follows female pop styles from ''The Name Game'' to ''A Natural Woman,'' all in a spirit of pure, irresistible fun. Showtime tonight is at 8, Saturday at 7 and 10 P.M., and Sunday at 2 and 5 P.M. Tickets are $25. Tom Paxton, Public School 41 Auditorium, 116 West 11th Street (594-8833). Tom Paxton continues to turn out probing topical songs that cover everything from yuppies to battered women to South Africa, and he also writes sensitive love songs. Though Mr. Paxton is basically very serious, he can also be funny. In ''Yuppies in the Sky,'' which parodies ''Riders in the Sky,'' a ghostly band of young real-estate experts flies down Columbus Avenue crying ''Condos for sale!'' His more harrowing songs, like ''The Death of Steven Biko,'' also reveal an acute eye for the details that humanize tragedy.",1986-04-18T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Singer, who, like Mr. Ashbery, has won a Pulitzer Prize for his writing, will deliver a lecture on ''Literature and Freedom.''

Tomorrow, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. in the University Center Gallery, Mr. Ashbery, a poet and journalist, will read from his works and discuss the theme of artists as collaborators.

The University of Chicago Press. $24.95. The life of Charles Baudelaire quite blatantly contradicts Chesterton's famous observation that the artistic temperament is a disease afflicting amateurs. While his meticulously crafted work was strict, indeed almost classical in form, Baudelaire himself led a manic, disordered existence that sounds awfully like a grade-B movie parody of 19th-century bohemian life. Besides overindulgence in alcohol, opium and hashish, there were pernicious debts, syphilis -which resulted in assorted nervous disorders, dizzy spells and death at the age of 46 - noisy, fragmented relationships with women and incessant attacks of what the poet would call spleen. In fact, Baudelaire was almost always in a bad mood - either enraged by the horrors and indignities of the world around him, tormented by the loneliness of his self-inflicted solitude, or simply bored with himself and everyone around him.",1986-04-19T05:00:00+0000

The question is whether it violates the separation of powers or unduly delegates authority to unelected officials. The law, sponsored by Senators Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, Republicans, and Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, Democrat, requires that the deficit be reduced in large installments over the next five years. Federal spending is to be reduced automatically if the anticipated deficit exceeds the statutory target for any year. The cuts are computed by the Comptroller General of the United States, who is head of the General Accounting Office, a widely respected auditing and investigative agency. The role of the Comptroller General and of his predecessor, the Comptroller of the Treasury, has generated fierce debate since the founding of the Republic because, in a sense, the office embodies the power of the purse. As demonstrated by the following excerpts from briefs filed with the Supreme Court by parties in the case, the debate continues still. ARGUING AGAINST: Representative Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, and 11 members of Congress Congress cannot delegate its constitutional responsibility to determine how taxpayer moneys are to be spent in the way that it did here. . . .",1986-04-20T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"HIGH HEARTS. By Rita Mae Brown. (Bantam, $17.95.) This expansive novel of the Civil War contains what must surely be the first in-saddle marital squabble between two members of a Virginia cavalry regiment. Geneva Chatfield, tall for her 18 years and an excellent horsewoman, can't stand the idea of her new husband, Nash Hart, running off to the cavalry and leaving her back on the plantation. So she cuts off her hair, convinces her mother and her best slave friend, Di-Peachy, to stay quiet about it, and sneaks off to join up. Nash seems as much turned off as surprised by this, and that's where the conjugal discord begins. (She's a much better rider; he's in the Ashley Wilkes part, the unfortunate kind of soldier who quickly earns the nickname ''Piggy Woo.'') The war is also beginning, and here Rita Mae Brown's childhood fascination with Virginia battlefields -and her extensive research for this book - serve her well. She knows her horses, and the movements of a cavalry unit in the battles of First Manassas and the Seven Days are excitingly painted. Women did indeed dress as men and fight in the war, and this idea comes alive. While the story rides breathlessly in Geneva's saddle, all is well. But the author's intention is to render the larger story of women's roles in the war, to create, she says, a ''monument'' to them. After all the careful interweaving of feuding slaves, sainted mothers, gossiping Richmond hostesses and the inevitable gold-hearted madam, the sound of guns comes to seem a relief.",1986-04-20T05:00:00+0000

These pieces of interpretive reporting re-create the 1968 conventions and in the process dramatize the political life of the nation in a turbulent year. Wilfrid Sheed wrote here in 1968 that the Miami essay was disappointing, ''partly because of the flatness of the occasion.'' But in the essay on the Democratic gathering in Chicago, ''the city itself excited Mailer and unleashed in him the child-observer, resident in every great descriptive novelist.'' The vignettes, Mr. Sheed said, ''have imperial authority.'' THE MACKEREL PLAZA, by Peter De Vries. (Penguin, $6.95.) In this comic novel, the widowed Rev. Andrew (Holy) Mackerel, of People's Liberal Church, wishes to remarry but his congregation is set on canonizing his dear departed wife. A. C. Spectorsky said in The Book Review in 1958 that ''the risible resources inherent in a raunchy, reform-reverend's race down the road to self-ruin are exploited with tireless ingenuity and wit.'' The same publisher has reissued THE PRICK OF NOON ($5.95), in which Peter De Vries's hero, Eddie Teeters, leads a double life as a porn king and a Connecticut social climber. In these pages in 1985, Clancy Sigal found the book thin on plot and character but said ''the hero sprays puns and smart-aleck ripostes like a machine gun gone out of control.''

H., Brooklyn Answer: There is no central listing for such communities, said a spokesman for the New Jersey chapter of the Community Associations Institute, a member of a national network of condominium directors and their professional advisers. He suggested that you inquire among real-estate dealers in the area in which you would like to live and let them know your requirements.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"BARDOT DENEUVE FONDA. By Roger Vadim. (Simon & Schuster, $17.95.) Roger Vadim is somewhat of a relic, a living erotosaurus who here exposes, so to speak, his own fossil record of love among the stars. As might be expected, the principal effect of this memoir of his famous wives and lovers is titillation. We join Mr. Vadim as he initiates the adolescent Brigitte Bardot into the rites of the boudoir. ''We had never gone beyond flirting,'' Mr. Vadim confides. ''She took me in her arms, and very gently I began making love to her.'' In movies as in love, Mr. Vadim directs Miss Bardot, and with the release of ''And God Created Woman'' in 1956 she enters stardom. But Miss Bardot is a troubled sex kitten, more complex than her popular image suggests. He writes, ''I knew that if she didn't follow her endless search through other men, she would die.'' Mr. Vadim heads off, and eventually moves in with 17-year-old Catherine Deneuve, whose ''finely drawn lips,'' he tells us, ''concealed deep sexuality.'' Despite such allure, Miss Deneuve gets rather short shrift here, roughly a third the space devoted to Bardot, perhaps because Mr. Vadim thinks she became a domestic tyrant as soon as she was a mother and a star in her own right. By 1965, the author is solo again, browsing through starlets of two continents, when he meets Jane Fonda. It is with Miss Fonda that he fully reveals one of the less endearing traits of the erotosaurus - the pronounced need to settle unmentioned (to the reader) old scores.",1986-04-20T05:00:00+0000

He was, in several senses, the conscience of modern science fiction. While most of his colleagues were content to entertain, he aspired to instruct, to uplift. In a subculture that seemed to offer no middle ground between reason and passion, he insisted that an allegiance to one without the other was a prescription for suicide. He periodically outraged the sensibilities of science fiction readers by reminding them that the body, too, has its reasons. His literary standards were high, and no one grieved more than he when his own work failed to meet them. Occasionally, as in the flawed but fascinating novel ''Venus Plus X,'' he let his narrative sink beneath the weight of his message. But even his failures helped raise the sights of other writers in the genre, and when he succeeded in fusing story, style and science, as in ''More Than Human,'' the results were dazzling.",1986-04-20T05:00:00+0000

us,THE CIGARETTE CENTURY,"IN the 1940's, a tobacco company proudly advertised that ''more doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarettes.'' If members of the American College of Physicians who met here earlier this month felt that way, they were not admitting it. Through lung cancer, heart disease and chronic lung disease, experts say, cigarettes are implicated in 350,000 deaths each year - one out of every six in the United States. But while the percentage of adult American smokers has dropped from 55 to about 30 (and to less than 17 percent of physicians) researchers have found that many of those who are still puffing do not even want to stop. Would higher taxes or stronger warning labels change their minds? What about a ban on cigarette advertising, which the American Medical Association recently endorsed but the tobacco industry contends would be unconstitutional and ineffective? Or rules that restrict lighting up in public places, such as those recently passed in Long Island and proposed by Mayor Koch? What more can doctors do about what many believe is public health enemy No. 1? These were among the questions considered at the College of Physicians meeting by a panel that comprised Dr. C. Everett Koop, the United States Surgeon General; Dr. Elizabeth M. Whelan, executive director of the American Council on Science and Health; Dr. Alan Blum, founder of Doctors Ought to Care, a coalition of community health groups, and Dr. David P. L. Sachs, an expert in smoking cessation research who is on the clinical faculty of the Stanford University School of Medicine.",1986-04-20T05:00:00+0000

Now, in ''Final Harvest,'' a native Midwesterner, Andrew H. Malcolm, has written a powerful and provocative account of the inexorable progression of events leading up to that cold, drizzly morning of Sept. 29, 1983, when Rudy Blythe, president of Ruthton's small Buffalo Ridge State Bank, and Toby Thulin, his chief loan officer, were called out to an abandoned, dilapidated 10-acre farm that the bank had earlier repossessed, where the farm's previous owner, James Jenkins, and his 18-year-old son, Steve, were waiting.",1986-04-20T05:00:00+0000

A poor sad sack named Victor Baton, a French veteran of the First World War, wakes in his shabby attic room in Paris and sets out to do what he does most days: to find a friend. Emmanuel Bove's ''My Friends,'' admired by Colette, Rilke and Beckett, and published in 1924, is the story of Victor's hapless, comical, heart-rending attempts to find love. One night he sleeps with Lucie Dunois, the proprietor of a wine shop, only to be chucked out in the morning without so much as a cup of coffee. One day he meets Henri Billard in a crowd gawking at a swooning dwarf. Victor is of no interest to him - until he lends Henri money - and the two never meet again. When Blanche, a cafe artiste, takes Victor home for the night and in the morning says he can come back the next day, he leaves and never tries to see her again. As the novel ends, Victor has been evicted from his apartment and has set up in a dingy hotel. He believes he has been thrown out because he does not work, because people could not forgive him ''for being free and for not being afraid of poverty.'' Bove claimed that he had created a genre, the novel of ''impoverished solitude.'' Both Victor's obsessive, often hilarious honesty about himself as well as his childish mythomania about love and friendship are forms of passive resistance, of imaginative delirium which are the only defenses a poor, weak, lonely man who wishes to be free has.",1986-04-20T05:00:00+0000

A household is engulfed by moralistic fervor as Gregers Werle awakens his old friend Hjalmar Ekdal from his complacency - from what could be regarded as a lie of the mind. That lie, the illusionary vision that Hjalmar has of himself and of his marriage, is his sustenance. Without it, he is psychologically destitute. In Ibsen's altered attitude toward liberalism, Gregers, the meddling idealist, becomes the true enemy of the people. At the same time, the victim, Hjalmar, never could be considered a hero. The single tragic figure is Hjalmar's teen-age daughter, who keeps a maimed wild duck as a pet, a symbolic representation of her own and her family's fantasy life.",1986-04-20T05:00:00+0000

None are likely to give the same explanation for any particular phenomenon, but no matter. Beginning tonight at City College's Aaron Davis Hall, a three-day conference on storytelling around the world will explore the tradition and feature some noted practitioners of the craft. Shared at the festival will be Creole and Hasidic tales; legends from the Skagit tribe of Puget Sound and the Lakota Sioux, and stories from Latin America, Ghana, China, Italy and elsewhere. The program opens tonight with remarks by Richard Lewis, an expert on children's literature, followed by a ''concert of storytellers'' that includes Muriel Bloch, a teller of North African and Middle Eastern tales; Peninnah Schram, who relates Jewish and Hasidic legends; Michael Parent, a French Canadian raconteur; Argentina Palacios, a Latin-American storyteller, and Mary Carter-Smith, the official ''griot'' (a French West African word for one who is both an oral historian and a poet) of Baltimore. A 9 P.M. concert by the folk singer Odetta, followed by a wine-and-cheese reception with all the performers, will follow. Tickets are $30 for the weekend ($10 for students with identification). A ticket for tonight alone costs $13.50; for tomorrow $23; and at Sunday's shows, a donation is requested. The hall is at Convent Avenue and 134th Street.",1986-04-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Hoyt Agrees to Plea,"The San Diego Padres pitcher LaMarr Hoyt, charged with weapons and drug violations, has agreed to plead guilty to a public-nuisance count in exchange for having the other charges dropped. The arrangement, which must be approved by a judge, is expected to be made formal during a Municipal Court hearing today in San Diego, said Stuart Swett, chief deputy city attorney in charge of the criminal division. Hoyt would be sentenced to three years' probation and fined $350, Swett said. His probation terms would require that Hoyt, 31 years old, violate no laws and not possess or be under the influence of any drugs unless it is under the direction of a doctor. The charges against Hoyt stemmed from Feb. 18, when San Diego police said they stopped Hoyt's car and found him in possession of a knife and two marijuana cigarettes. It was his second arrest in eight days and led to his admittance to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in Minnesota during spring training. He underwent a monthlong treatment program before rejoining the Padres before the season. Hoyt, in newspaper interviews published yesterday, said he had been unfairly labeled an alcoholic and in some ways regretted his stay at the Hazelden Center. ''If I'd known exactly what I was getting into, I'd never have gone,'' Hoyt said. ''I'd have quit baseball. I wanted to quit while I was in there.'' Ten days into a 28-day treatment program, Hoyt said, he called Ballard Smith and told the Padres president he wanted out of the center and out of basball.",1986-04-25T05:00:00+0000

In ''Blue Rise,'' Miss Hill's characters speak a near-perfect Deep Southern idiom. In this book, an otherwise engaging group lapses at times into an unfortunate psycho-rap. And while (as implied by her title) Miss Hill has this time left the Southern milieu behind, she has once more taken as her subject that nebulous, filamented and fragile relationship called marriage, that pairing in which man and woman become for each other lover, brother, sister, mother, father and friend.

He has set ''Jabberwocky,'' the Mad Tea Party, the Lobster Quadrille and, more recently, the two elegiac preface poems, moving from nonsense into grand passion. The obsession has produced a hit record - the Chicago Symphony's recording of ''Final Alice'' with Georg Solti and soprano Barbara Hendricks made it onto the classical charts alongside the Pachelbel Canon and Luciano Pavarotti, almost unheard of for a contemporary piece -and now an hourlong ballet choreographed by Glen Tetley for the National Ballet of Canada.

The fact is that these and other observations are figments of Mr. Bergman's joke-filled imagination (an imagination that was earlier, and more enjoyably, demonstrated in his screenplays for the movies ''Blazing Saddles'' and ''The In-Laws''). Mineolans - and their Long Island neighbors in Garden City and Hempstead, as well - could easily outsmart ''Social Security,'' the latest in a wave of plays that demonstrate that the theater is increasingly becoming a way station for the fare one might normally find on television.

As the unofficial dean of American literature, Howells had served as editor, adviser and friend to most of the important writers in the nation. He felt sure that he could persuade 11 distinguished authors to join him in writing a book. In the spring of 1906, he suggested the project to Elizabeth Jordan, the energetic editor of Harper's Bazar (as it was then spelled). She responded with enthusiasm and eagerly agreed to undertake the editorial work, suggesting the inclusion of, among others, Henry James. The chapters would appear serially in Harper's Bazar and then be collected in a book. It seemed like an editor's dream. It turned out to be an editor's nightmare.",1986-04-27T05:00:00+0000

An alert United States marshal on the plane recovered the list. From one point of view, you could say Mr. Wilson had done all right: his net worth was roughly $14 million. On the other hand, when the prosecutors were done with him he was in solitary confinement in a tough Federal prison, serving sentences totaling 52 years with no better than an outside chance of parole somewhere around the year 2000, when he would be 72.",1986-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,THE BENEFITS LOST IN EARLY RETIREMENT,"Following are answers to some questions from readers of the Personal Finance column. Q: How can I obtain information about earnings credited to my Social Security account, and benefits I can expect to receive? I'm 55 years old and considering stopping work soon, but wonder if early retirement would reduce whatever benefits I'm eligible for when I become 62. A: For information on your account, ask your local Social Security office for form SSA-7004, ''Request for Statement of Earnings.'' Within five weeks after you return the completed form, you should receive a computer printout of your Social Security earnings for your entire career, through 1984. (There is typically a 12-month lag in crediting your last full calendar year's earnings to your Social Security record.) If you retire early - that is, before age 65 - it will reduce the amount of benefits you are ultimately entitled to receive, since the amount of benefits is determined by your earnings over your entire career. Even if you were at or above the maximum level for Social Security payroll deductions, you are likely to be penalized for not working from age 55 to 62. ''In all probability, those years will be counted as zero earning years and you will suffer a loss of benefits,'' says John B. Trollinger, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration.",1986-04-27T05:00:00+0000

He didn't correct this observation even after he explained that because it was Sunday, he was taking me a long way round to avoid the heavy traffic on the main shopping street.

Before dawn on the morning of Sept. 22, 1780, in a cluster of fir trees atop a hill on the west bank of the Hudson, two men met to discuss a scheme that might have changed the outcome of the American Revolution. Brig. Gen. Benedict Arnold, hero of many a battle in the cause of independence, told Maj. John Andre, adjutant general to the British commander, that for $:20,000 he would arrange to turn over the crucial post at West Point and 3,000 rebel troops. Ten days later, in the village of Tappan, N.Y., a thousand American soldiers and residents of the neighborhood, all of them sad-faced and many of them weeping, watched as Andre died, gibbeted as a spy. Meanwhile, Arnold had slipped through the lines into British-held New York City to collect his reward. The story has been told many times before, but this is the first work to concentrate on Andre's career, making full use of the Andre family papers. Mr. Hatch presents a portrait of a most engaging young man -British-born of Huguenot ancestry, urbane, well traveled, possessing a flair for writing light verse and drawing. He was a charmer of women, among them the Philadelphia belle who became Mrs. Benedict Arnold. Mr. Hatch depicts him in a highly elegant style that frequently scants significant facts and names. To his credit, Mr. Hatch does make it clear that, although to his contemporaries, American as well as British, Andre was a tragic hero, his heroism had great flaws.",1986-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,TOPPING OFF MASS TRANSIT'S BUDGET,"WITH gasoline prices falling and motorists presumably in a better mood, mass-transit planners in the metropolitan area have been casting covetous glances at gasoline taxes as a source of funds. The Regional Plan Association, a private research group, recommended last month that motorists help the hard-pressed Metropolitan Transportation Authority by paying higher local and Federal gasoline taxes, higher bridge and tunnel tolls in New York City and higher motor vehicle registration fees in the M.T.A. district - New York City and the seven closest New York counties. But in addition to New York City's 8.25 percent sales tax, motorists already pay 8 cents a gallon to the state and 9 cents to the Federal Government. The city and state taxes go into general funds; of the Federal tax, 8 cents is used for highway construction and a penny goes to mass transit. James Brooke, who covers transportation for The Times, asked Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker who is chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation and heads the transit committee of Governor Cuomo's Council on Fiscal and Economic Priorities, and James J. McGowan, director of government affairs for the Automobile Club of New York, for their thoughts. Some excerpts follow. FELIX G. ROHATYN: More Funds Are Needed",1986-04-27T05:00:00+0000

President Reagan issued the warning after arriving in Hawaii, his second stop on his way to an economic summit meeting in Tokyo. Before he left Los Angeles, he indicated in his weekly radio address his Administration's willingness to remain involved in economic and security matters in the Pacific. [ Page 1, Column 6. ] American officials are undecided on how far to go in repeating attacks similar to the one on Libya to counter an expected rise in anti-American terrorism around the world. President Reagan has said the United States would strike again. [ 1:5. ] The Qaddafi regime is undergoing self-criticism of the fight it put up April 14 against the American air raid. American pilots evaded the Libyan air defense system and were already over Tripoli dropping bombs before antiaircraft fire began. Meanwhile some Libyan troops abandoned their posts and their commanders were slow to give orders, according to Western diplomats and Eastern-bloc sources. [ 1:3. ] Money is flowing out of Japan to the rest of the world, through investments ranging from automobile plants in Michigan to United States Treasury bonds to loans for petroleum development in the South China Sea. Japan has become the world's premier supplier of money, fueled by profits from exports and huge pools of domestic savings.

EVERYTHING conspired to make it happen: farmland was a drug on the market and crops were surplus commodities; gasoline was cheap and so were autos; Congress repeatedly subsidized interest rates for mortgages that encouraged an outward flow; cities accumulated blacks, debts and crime. And so it came about, the greatest exodus of city population into new suburbs in world history, coupled with the greatest expansion of suburban housing. From the end of World War II in 1945, this revolution ran unchecked until the oil embargo of 1973, and still continues in varying degrees into the 1980's. In ''Crabgrass Frontier,'' Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University, unfolds the comprehensive history of those forces behind the suburban boom and the implacable and virtually irresistible pressures that brought it about.

There are only 27 first-round picks because Cleveland used its choice, acquired in a trade, to take Bernie Kosar in the 1985 supplemental draft. 1. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: 11 picks over all They are thin everywhere on defense, but they can't pass up Bo Jackson of Auburn, who is everything you ever wanted in a running back and more. Still, don't rule out the possibility of a trade. 2. Atlanta Falcons: 10 picks Only one team had a worse pass defense last season, which means improvement along the line for more pressure is mandatory. Tony Casillas of Oklahoma, a natural nose guard for the Falcons' new 3-4, is a perfect pick. 3. Houston Oilers: 11 picks Chances are the Oilers will trade down once or twice to get a defensive lineman. If they don't, they will take Jim Everett, the quarterback from Purdue, who will either give Warren Moon a run for his considerable money or will be traded later. 4. Indianapolis Colts: 11 picks The Colts' passing game hasn't been the same since Bert Jones was around and the Colts played out of Baltimore. They want Everett but may have to settle for Chuck Long of Iowa. Later, they will get a much needed wide receiver and offensive lineman. 5. St. Louis Cardinals: 12 picks The Cardinals couldn't stop the run last year, which makes Jon Hand, a 6-6 1/2, 280-pound defensive end from Alabama, an ideal pick.",1986-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,HEMINGWAY ON WRITING: 'REMEMBERING ACCURATELY',"NEXT month, Charles Scribner's Sons will publish Ernest Hemingway's final novel, ''The Garden of Eden.'' Hemingway began the book in 1946, at the age of 47, and worked on it off and on for the next 15 years, while also writing ''The Old Man and the Sea,'' ''A Moveable Feast,'' ''Islands in the Stream'' and ''The Dangerous Summer.'' A story of love and obsession, ''The Garden of Eden'' is about David Bourne, an American in his mid-to-late 20's, a World War I veteran and a newlywed, who has recently published his second novel. On his honeymoon in the south of France and Spain with his wife, Catherine, he is just beginning to receive letters from his publisher enclosing very good notices for his second book. Already Bourne would like to begin writing something new, and much of ''The Garden of Eden'' concerns the tension between a man's love and need for his work and his deep love for a wife who encourages him to write, but, in fact, can't stand for him to. She provides many obstacles and seductions, including a younger woman, Marita, and strange, disturbing sexual roles for the three of them to play. In many of the fragments excerpted here we see him trying to make a start and, through him, glimpse Hemingway looking back to create a novel that reflects some of his own experience as a young writer.",1986-04-27T05:00:00+0000

May 23, 1958 - Nuclear-fuel elements rupture in an experimental reactor at Chalk River, Canada, severely contaminating the building and slightly contaminating the immediate surrounding area. About 600 men participate in the cleanup. Jan. 3, 1961 - An experimental reactor in Idaho Falls goes out of control at a Federal installation, killing three technicians, one of them impaled by a reactor control rod. There is said to be no danger to the public, but the plant has very high radiation levels. Some Federal investigators later suggest the mishap was sabotage resulting from a lover's triangle. Oct. 5, 1966 - The core of the Enrico Fermi experimental breeder reactor near Detroit partly melts when a sodium cooling system malfunctions. The emergency shutdown apparatus stops the reaction from running away and no injuries occur, but radiation levels inside the plant are high. Jan. 21, 1969 - A coolant malfunction from an experimental underground reactor at Lucens Vad, Switzerland, results in the release of a large amount of radiation into a cavern, which is then sealed. There are no injuries. Oct. 17, 1969 - A fuel-loading error causes a partial fuel meltdown at a gas-cooled power reactor in Saint-Laurent, France.",1986-04-29T05:00:00+0000

The Union Square Greenmarket, the oldest of the 18 greenmarkets in the city, was organized in 1976. At that time, the renewal of Union Square Park, which had deteriorated markedly, seemed an impossible challenge. ''The City Planning Department was desperately seeking some way to spark a change in Union Square,'' Barry Benepe, director of the greenmarket program, recalled, ''and for the first few years things were pretty grim around here.'' This summer, fairs and entertainment will mark the 10th anniversary of the Union Square Greenmarket. The luncheon celebrates the first anniversary of the completion of the renovation of Union Square Park. The new Union Square Park Community Coalition, consisting of community groups and block associations, is dedicated to continued improvement of the park and hopes to sponsor special events such as concerts throughout the summer. The benefit luncheon will be at 12:30 P.M. at 21 East 16th Street. Tickets are $30 and are tax-deductible. For reservations call Oliver Johnston at 212-505-1454.",1986-04-30T05:00:00+0000
