By ANTHONY BURGESS MONTE CARLO, Monaco IT never takes long, when discussing drink or food, to realize the inevitability of drawing on the French language. Many people in Britain or America only properly meet French on menus or in the cookery books of Julia Child, which means that, for them, the language is circumscribed by the kitchen. What they consider to be the elegance or exactitude of French is derived from the memory of palatal events that can be renewed, either in Paris or in the dining room of a neat professorial home in New Hampshire. French dishes, like pieces of music, can be performed with only minor mutations of tempo and dynamic (read, if you wish, seasoning). The Empress Josephine, while still living in the Antilles, offered visitors from France classic Parisian dishes adapted to the climate and the availability of herbs and spices unknown to France: these, so strict is French naming, could not be called what she called them.

The polite young Brooklyn-born, Harvardeducated author of ''The Naked and the Dead'' evolved, through the 50's and hectic 60's, into the blustering protagonist of ''The Armies of the Night'' - ''warrior, presumptive general, champion of obscenity, embattled aging enfant terrible of the literary world'' - and surfaced again in the less flamboyant 70's as a ''modest and half-invisible Aquarius.'' Indeed, the self-portrait that emerges in Mr. Mailer's new collection of short work and interviews from the 60's and 70's, ''Pieces and Pontifications,'' is that of a writer who has traded his egocentric concerns of the past for a new objectivity, his prodigality of emotion and rhetoric for more modest satisfactions.",1982-06-06T05:00:00+0000

Nothing could be further from the truth. Historically, as with other fatal diseases before the advancement of modern medicine, there was no ''treatment''; and even long after Alcoholics Anonymous was founded and treatment centers were established, the problem of convincing alcoholics to accept the help available remained. Today, there is a highly successful method for overcoming this problem of getting through to alcoholics. This method is called intervention and is being adopted by many employers and concerned people.",1982-06-06T05:00:00+0000

There is nothing highbrow about the dean of New York directors, as is shown in his best-known work: ''Prince of the City,'' ''Dog Day Afternoon,'' ''Network'' and ''Serpico.'' As Lumet doesn't mind explaining: ''I'm constantly being asked, 'What's the overall theme in your work?' - that kind of stuff. I'm not an intellectual, and if there is a theme, I don't want to know about it. To me, the death of a great many awfully good creative people has been pretension. They start believing what the 'serious' critics say about them.

Indeed, the self-portrait that emerges in Mr. Mailer's new collection of short work and interviews from the 60's and 70's, ''Pieces and Pontifications,'' is that of a writer who has traded his egocentric concerns of the past for a new objectivity, his prodigality of emotion and rhetoric for more modest satisfactions.",1982-06-06T05:00:00+0000

On one hand these pictures were as unassuming and intimate as common snapshots; on the other they were restatements of Hockney's major work in other mediums.

They point to the fact that both the Soviet Union and China endorsed no-first-use a long time ago, and caution that American strategic planners cannot and should not necessarily accept that pledge as sincere.

Clark, the national security adviser, and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. (Page A1, Column 6.) Withdrawal of Syrian forces from Beirut was sought by President Elias Sarkis of Lebanon but the request was turned down because it appeared to have been made under duress, with Israeli guns aimed at the presidential palace, a Syrian official said.

Hinckley Jr., who fired explosive bullets into the bodies of President Reagan and three other men nearly 15 months ago, was found ''not guilty by reason of insanity'' last week, the public reaction was outrage. Mr. Hinckley, who was committed to a Washington mental hospital, theoretically could be released within months; his lawyers, who maintained during the eight-week trial that the attack stemmed from his desire to win the love of actress Jodie Foster, said they wouldn't attempt to free him until they no longer considered him dangerous. The Week in Review asked Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, and Alan Dershowitz, a professor at the Harvard Law School, to talk about the insanity defense.

us,THE ISLAND TREES CASE TURNS ANOTHER LEGAL CORNER,"IN 1976, nine books were removed from the shelves of junior and senior high schools in the Island Trees Union Free School District, a middle-class community on Long Island. A seven-member school board found the books - which included ''The Fixer'' by Bernard Malamud, ''Down These Mean Streets'' by Piri Thomas and ''Soul on Ice'' by Eldridge Cleaver - ''anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic and just plain filthy.'' The banning prompted a lawsuit by five former students, who contended it violated the First Amendment. A Federal District Court dismissed the suit without a trial in 1979, but the next year a Federal appeals court decided that the students were entitled to try to prove their case in court. Last week, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment does limit the discretion of school officials in such cases. The court made no attempt to define what those limits were but, in sending the matter back to the lower court, kept alive the students' challenge.",1982-06-27T05:00:00+0000

He yielded three runs on three hits in the first inning to St. Petersburgh, a St. Louis Cardinals minor league club, but he completed the rest of his stint without allowing another run. Richard, who spent the last month in a special extended training program in Sarasota, yielded one more hit, struck out one and walked two before a crowd of 4,500 at City Island Park. At the end of his outing, Richard leaped and thrust his right arm into the air in a display of emotion. Team officials and doctors following Richard's comeback effort had said that uncertainty about how the pitcher would respond to batted balls was their chief concern in his rehabilitative effort. During the four-inning outing last night, Richard was involved in only three fielding plays. He was slow covering first base on two slow rollers to the right side of the infield. On the third play, a weak line drive back to the mound, the ball glanced off Richard's glove, and the pitcher picked it up and threw out the batter. ...
