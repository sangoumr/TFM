us,Screen: Blacks and Mardi Gras,"The black Mardi Gras organizations of New Orleans are the principal subject of the two films that will be shown from today through Sunday as part of the New American Filmmakers series at the Whitney Museum.The longer and more ambitious is ""Always for Pleasure,"" by Les Blank, a Berkeley filmmaker who has previously chronicled the lives of Cajuns in rural Louisiana blacks in Texas and Chicanos in Chicago.Because Mr. Blank appears to have no point of view beyond the rubric, ""Life Is for the Living,"" his 58-minute film tends to be structureless and finally tedious. There are endless shots of happy blacks, less footage of happy whites on St. Patrick's Day in the crescent city, the obligatory interview with an old jazz-man at Preservation Hall, where the lifeless, out-of-tune playing is an embarrassment, a fellow explaining how he cooks crawfish, towboats puffing on the Mississippi, and of course, a long look at the carnival organizations themselves.The 33-minute ""The Black Indians of New Orleans"" is by Maurice M. Martinez, a member of the faculty at Hunter College, and its approach is more disciplined than coherent. It focuses on two organizations, the Yellow Pocahontas and the White Eagles, their leaders, and their preparations for their parades. Unlike ""Life Is for the Living,"" it also provides a brief historical context in a narration.Why these black equivalents of the white ""krewes"" have all adopted Indian names and feathered and beaded costumes is, by the way, a matter of conjecture. One is that long in the past there was a certain intermarriage between the blacks and the Indian tribes of the hinterland.",1978-05-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Meet in Paradise':Fun and Philandering,"""WE WILL ALL Meet in Paradise,"" the director Yves Robert's follow-up to ""Pardon Mon Affaire,"" has the unmistakable air of a sequelnot because it seems like the continuation of a story, but because it doesn't seem like a story at all. Four fun-loving philanderers are up to a variety of boyish tricks, and the film apportions equal time to each of them, with no predominant plot thread or guiding principle. The characters are entertaining, and so are many of their adventures, but the film has all the structural solidarity of a dandelion in seed stage: it's pretty, airy, and just on the verge of blowing away.The terribly solemn Etienne, played by Jean Rochefort just as Peter Sellers would have played him, does a ""Pink Panther"" ineffectual-snoop routine, trying to figure out whether his wife (Daniele Delorme) really is ""a faithful, happy example of the French woman, who is the envy of tourists the world over."" Loutish, lustful Bouly (Victor Lanoux) keeps busy supporting his wife, his mistress, and a lot of interchangeable-looking children.Daniel (Claude Brasseur) may be on the verge of entering into a marriage of convenience with a wealthy older woman, but when he looks out a window and whistles ""Not bad!"" the object of his attention ismuch to his hetero-sexual cronies' disappointment  a handsome young soldier. And Simon (Guy Bedos), a doctor who is the ultimate mama's boy, makes love to his female patients behind the X-ray machine.The film's funniest sequences involve this foursome's ill-advised purchase of a country home, a fist-fight they conduct wearing earmuffs on a tennis court, and a bully's single-handedly demolishing an entire car, whch happens to have Mr. Rochefort inside it at the time. Mr. Bedos's dealings with his mother are also most amusing. Mr. Robert has a dry wit, a sure hand and, figuratively speaking, an old hat: His is a lightly likable, essentially familiar brand of comedy, designed to elicit a few mild chuckles and an occasional ooh-la-la.Mr. Robert also attempts good-humored social satire at times, but his work is a good deal more tepid in this department. Mr. Robert's notion that the foibles of the French bourgeoisie are silly but lovable is a profoundly uninteresting one.It should be noted that ""We Will All Meet in Paradise"" bears a distinct resemblance to ""My Friends,"" an Italian film released two years ago, also about the adventures of four fun-loving philanderers. ""My Friends"" was uproariously funny, and deftly satirical and ""We Will All Meet in Paradise"" doesn't hold a candle to it.""We Will All Meet In Paradise,"" which is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), alludes obliquely to its characters' sexual escapades, but it treats this material in a harmless, genial manner.",1978-05-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Films by Maya Deren:Intense Shorts,"THE FEW FILMS directed by the late Maya Deren are extremely shortranging from 4 to 15 minutesand they cannot be watched with anything less than the utmost concentration. Miss Deren, a pioneer avant-garce figure who did most of her work in the late 1940's, invested every last object and gesture in her films with strong symbolic meaning, and her work requires the same kind of painstaking scrutiny one might ordinarily bring to a painting. The Film Forum's Deren retrospective, which will be shown tonight through Sunday and again from May 11 to May 14, lasts only an hour and a half, but the relentless intensity of the program makes it exhausting.Aside from the draining effect Miss Deren's films have when snown together, there are other good reasons for taking her efforts in small doses. She tended to repeat herself somewhat, in both her extreme attentiveness to the voluptuous possibilities of the human body and in her predilection for shifting characters back and forth between natural, primitive-looking locales and abstract, ""socialized"" settings. Typically, ""At Land"" begins alternating an image of Miss Deren crawling along a beach with one of her wriggling across the table at a dinner party.Miss Deren figured as physically and seductively as she could in most of her films, but ""A Study in Choreography for Camera"" concentrates entirely on the dancer Talley Beatty, who leaped through a forest, a living room and a museum. The completed film runs only four minutes, and it is followed on the program by 15 minutes of out-takes, extra footage of Mr. Beatty that Miss Deren shot and stored away.This unused material would be illuminating if one had the time or the inclination to study it closely, and it would certainly cast more light upon Miss Deren's decision processes if the finished film were shown again, afterward. Scheduled as they are, though, the out-takes merely overwhelm the film itself, and they serve to limit the potential audience for this program to only the most serious students of the avant-garde cinema.",1978-05-04T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'The Last Supper,' A Parable From Cuba:Politics and Religion","THE time is the late 18th century Holy Weekand the placea huge, isolated Cuban sugar plantation owned by a Spanish count from Havana who appears to represent the best of the ruling aristocracy. The Count is middle-aged and has the gaunt look of someone who suffers spiritually, as well as from intestinal disorders. He does not take lightly the responsibilities of power. He is as much concerned for the souls of his slaves as he is for their physical fitness.When his overseer, a brutishly practical man named Manuel, punishes a returned runaway by slicing off the slave's ear, the Count feels the victim's pain. The Count doesn't question the system, of course. Instead, he devotes himself to making it work. To this end he invites 12 slaves, picked at random, to join him for dinner on Maundy Thursday, in effect to re-enact the Last Supper that Jesus shared with his disciples the night before his crucifixion.""The Last Supper,"" a new Cuban film by Tomas Gutierrez Alea, the director whose ""Memories of Underdevelopment"" was one of the critical hits of 1973, is a fine, cool, almost detached political parable told entirely in religious terms. In this way it recalls the kind of contradictions that made ""Memories of Underdevelopment"" so fascinating, and that are, for Mr. Alea, virtually a stylistic method.Though ""Memories"" looks at the Cuban revolution through the eyes of a middle-class intellectual who can't bring himself to participate, the film itself is passionately committed. ""The Last Supper"" is about death resurrection, not only about the death and resurrection of freedom, but also of repression.Like the earlier film, it seems to say more than one ever expects to hear in popular revolutionary literature, where ideas and feelings are supposed to be recognized and accommodated by even the dimmest minds.""The Last Supper,"" which opens today at the 68th Street Playhouse, is not an easy film. It has something of the haunted, guilt-ridden manner of the Count, the character who dominates the film and who remains forever mysterious. It's not, I think, that the director or Nelson Villagra, who plays the Count, withhold information. It is, rather, that the truth of human behavior can never be more than action observed. The rest is speculation.The film's centerpiece is the extraor-dinary last supper presided over by the Count, who begins by washing and kissing the feet of the 12 slaves while each, in turn, giggles and panics at the lunatic behavior of the master. In the course of the meal, as the wine flows, the Count attempts to instruct the slaves in Christian mythology and dogma.""Sorrow,"" he says, ""is the only thing we can give God with joy""everything else belongs to God anyway. The slaves find this concept confusing, while all, except one former cannibal, are amused at the thought of consuming the body and blood of Jesus in the form of bread and wine.Before the supper has ended, the Count, now thoroughly drunk and in a mood to be pals with the help, has freed one slave and promised no work the next day, Good Friday. When those promises are not honored, the rebellion that breaks out results in the crucifixion of a most unlikely son-of-God and in his resurrection in the person of the Count himself. His wrath is not that of a disappointed God, but of a property owner.My program notes, unfortunately, identify only the actor who plays the Count, but the film has several other memorable performances. There is the man who plays the priest at the sugar mill, a boyish-looking fellow who attempts to meet the needs of the Count and the slaves and fails everyone. There are also the actor who plays the runaway slave, a man who becomes a symbol for eventual revolutionary victory, and the old, old black man who plays the briefly freed slave.Except for the occasional use of the hand-held camera, which is so intrustive as to seem self-congratulatory, ""The Last Supper"" has been beautifully photographed in color by Mario Garcia Joya, who also shot the black-and-white ""Memories of Underdevelopment."" The colors are mostly the colors of depressed rural areaslots of tobacco browns and the yellows of feeble candlelight. The skies are blue, but they are oppressive, and the greens suggest a landscape of weeds.",1978-05-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Lelouch's 'Cat and Mouse; Murder Intrigue,"The title of Claude Lelouch's pretty and personable new murder mystery, ""Cat and Mouse,"" is a play on the name of the story's main character, a police inspector called Lechat. It also refers to the brand of gamesmanship Mr. Lelouch usesthis time to unusually good effectto keep an audience on its toes. ""Cat and Mouse"" is populated by characters with fertile imaginations, so the film depicts quite a few incidents that prove, on close inspection, not to have taken place. In this same spirit, Mr. Lelouch keeps his camera continually pacing and peering, until it begins finding clues that aren't really clues at all.An unseen man, a minor figure in the story, always directs his visitors to a drawerful of identical-looking cigars in his humidor, ominously reciting the same line: ""Take any one, they're quite correct."" A peculiar jewel theft turns out to have been part of another movie someone was watching at the time of the actual crime. A married woman is seen visiting her lover, whose back is toward the camera; it turns out that Mr. Lelouch has shot the scene this way not out of any particular discretion, but because the whole episode is being described by a gossip-mongening, unreliable witness. The film reeks of that staple ingredient of any good-humored tale of intrigue, the red herring.In the past, Mr. Lelouch has often applied his full powers of obfuscation to more dramatic or romantic material, fudging the fine line between fantasy and reality at moments when it needs to be drawn most clearly. Here, though, these same stylistic idiosyncrasies are so appropriately applied that they take on a whole new dimension of wit.""Cat and Mouse"" isn't primarily a comedy, but it continually sends up the conventions of mystery fiction, and also parodies a great many movie-making gimmicks. The jewel-robbery scene, the one that is actually part of another film, is shot exactly as if it were part of this one. Mr. Lelouch takes great pains to trick his audience, and an even greater delight in the camera's power to deceive.The plot revolves around the death of a wealthy businessman (Jean-Pierre Aumont), the questionable innocence of his bereaved wife (Michele Morgan) and the genial snooping of Detective Lechat (Serge Reggiani). Its dnouement is complicated in the extreme, rich with the unflagging niceness that is so formidable a part of Mr. Lelouch's mystique. Even the lesser characters, such as the couple's sneaky-looking servants or the dead man's pornographic-star mistress, are so likable that it's hard to imagine any of them as cold-blooded killers.The solution to the mystery isn't clever enough to rank Mr. Lelouch's script with the work of Conan Doyle, but it does manage to satisfy the demands of logic without compromising the film's essentially benign view of human nature. For a murder mystery, that's a great deal more difficult and impressive than it may sound.Mr. Lelouch always uses handsome, friendly-looking actors to reinforce his films' feeling of warmth, but this time he has really outdone himself in the realm of clever casting. In 1975, when ""Cat and Mouse"" was made, Miss Morgan hadn't been in a film in years, and was perhaps still identified in most viewers' minds with her earlier, more glamorous roles. Mr. Lelouch cast her as a serene, implacably elegant matron of about 50, and chose the rumpled, redoubtable Mr. Reggiania wonderful character actor who had also been out of view for a whileto play the detective who both suspects and admires her.The teaming of Miss Morgan and Mr. Reggiani gives the film an ironic recogniton of class boundaries and a delight at the ease with which they can sometimes be crossed; in addition, it provides great deal of romantic spark. Their performances are top-notch, and they make a fine couple.However, they don't spend a great deal of time ogether Miss Morgan is most often seen at home, on one of the most spectacular estates suburban Paris has to offer. Mr. Reggiani is usually seen with his assistant, an equally rumpled, younger fellow played by the estimable Phlippe Leotard. Together with two women friends and one of the worst-trained police dogs in movie history, they are often shown eating, drinking and emphatically illustrating that a policeman's lot need not be an unhappy one. The unlikely domestic troubles revolving around Mr. Reggiani produce some of the film's most amusing and memorable vignettes.Occasionally, Mr. Lelouch's methods backfire. A brief flashback to the death of a young man in an auto accident, prettily shot and scored by Francis Lai, has the ill-chosen rosiness that mars some of Mr. Lelouch's other films. And an episode showing the two detectives racing through traffic, meant to be dizzying, goes on so long that it has the desired effect and then some.Luckily, lapses like these are infrequent. Besides, in a backhanded way, they're useful: They recall the preciousness that has been so tiresome in some of the director's other films, and that is so commendably absent this time. In addition to being one of his best and most ingenious films, ""Cat and Mouse"" is the closest Mr. Lelouch has come to producing his patented glow with enough discipline and economy to attract moviegoers of all persuasions, not just the romantics in the crowd. Those who are not charter members of Mr. Lelouch's fan club ought to find ""Cat and Mouse"" a specially nice surprise.""Cat and Mouse,"" which is rated PG (Parental Guidance Suggested""), features one very innocuous-looking shooting and a plot involving a young prostitute, a pornographic-movie star and a few extramarital love affairs.",1978-05-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie: 'The End' With Burt Reynolds:Director and Star,"""THE END,"" which was directed by Burt Reynolds, who also stars in it, is like being with good friends at a party where nothing goes right. The food doesn't arrive. The ice runs out. A couch catches fire and, outside in the street, the Department of Water Supply is making a noisy, after-hours dig to locate a broken main. Instead of calling the whole thing off, the host tries to cope.This is pretty much what Mr. Reynolds tries to do in ""The End,"" a comedy about a cheerful, completely unreliable Los Angeles real-estate promoter who learns he has a fatal blood disease and takes the news badly. Mr. Reynolds tries to cope but the party seldom results in much more than physical and emotional exhaustion.The beginning of ""The End,"" which opens today at the Baronet, more or less defines everything that's wrong with the movie that follows. Wendell Sonny Lawson (Mr. Reynolds), who has a measure of fame for having been his own television huckster, is in his doctor's office receiving the fatal news.The camera doesn't show us the two men in the same shot. Mostly we get close-ups of Wendell, who overacts so broadly that we know the film's mood is comic even though neither he nor the doctor (Norman Fell) are funny. Wendell becomes enraged. He cries. The doctor, who has a cold, doses himself with nasal spray and offers feeble hope (""Perhaps some doctor, somewhere, in some little lab will find a cure. . . ."")The scene wants to be funny. It tells us it's trying to be funny, but you sense mounting desperation, which is suddenly made manifest when, for no apparent reason, the director begins to photograph the star through the tropical fish tank that tones up the doctor's office. There's no logic to this shot. It's another way of shooting a scene that is not going anywhere anyway.Thereafter Wendell Sonny Lawson undertakes a frantic search for sympathy and a practical, painless way out. He visits his elderly parents (Myrna Loy and Pat O'Brien), who are nice but too self-absorbed to notice that he has absconded with all their sleeping pills. His ex-wife (Joanne Woodward) loathes him for good reason, though she would seem to be as bad a bargain as Wendell in any marriage.His best friend (David Steinberg) simply agrees that suicide is the wisest course, while his girlfriend (Sally Field), a sweet slob who lives in a clutter of cats and unwashed dishes, cries a lot and, after they've made love, admits that she didn't have an orgasmbut then she never does.It is difficult to believe that Jerry Belson, who wrote the screenplay for ""The End"" (as he did for the successfully satiric ""Smile""), didn't have more in mind about the barren lives of these people than what we see on the screen. This is half-heartedly satiric material that's been directed by Mr. Reynolds as if it were broad, knock-about comedy sometimes and, at other times, as if it were meant to evoke pathos, which it never does.With the right direction, Mr. Reynolds has shown himself to be an accomplished comedian as in ""Semi-Tough,"" but the actor here is betrayed by the director who doesn't appear to know which way the camera should be pointed.The movie isn't totally unfunny. Wendell has an amusing encounter early on with Bobby Benson, who plays a Catholic priest so young and nave that all he can say is ""wow"" when Wendell attempts to confess. Carl Reiner has a nice, very brief bit as a ""death therapist,"" But the film's only sustained comedy is supplied by the incomparable Dom DeLuise as a schizophrenic murderer who befriends the desperate Wendell. Mr. DeLuise's characterization amounts to a solo nightclub performance and, like many a nightclub performance, it doesn't really go anywhere, it just runs out of material.The film's most serious shortcoming is Mr. Reynolds's apparent inability to direct himself in relation to the other actors. He's not rude to them. He doesn't upstage them. He has an excellent supporting cast and he obviously relishes their talents, but he has no concept of where he, as actor as well as director, stands as boss. He's simply overwhelmed.",1978-05-10T05:00:00+0000

us,"Movie: 'Greek Tycoon,' Rotogravure Style:Two Jacquelines","""THE GREEK TYCOON"" recalls a sort of newspaper journalism you don't see much anymorethe Sunday supplement recapitulation of a famous murder, divorce or other scandal, put together, from morgue clips, and filled out by the writer with breathless speculation about what really might have happened and what really might have been said, always with more exclamation points than are absolutely necessary. It's the literature of vultures who have no interest in tearing into something of the first freshness.In case you haven't seen the ads, which tell all, the film is the something-less-than-passionate love story of the beautiful young widow of an assassinated United States President and an aging Greek promoter who owns oil tankers, airlines and islands and dreams of becoming President of Greece, which would be decidedly odd since his real-life model traveled on an Argentine passport.Cast in the leading roles are Jacqueline Bisset, who bears a striking resemblance to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, but, at this date, is younger and more beautiful, and Anthony Quinn, who sort of looks like the late Aristotle Onassis, though he's a much bigger man and according to all reports about Mr. Onassis, possesses much less charm.Some of the other characters who pop up like animated mannequins are a former British prime minister, who looks as if he'd like to look like a bulldog; the Greek tycoon's noisy, publicity-loving mistress; his first wife, who commits suicide under what may or may not be mysterious circumstances; the late President of the United States himself, played by James Franciscus, and his brother (the Attorney General) and sister-in-law.The movie wastes no time attempting to create a fictional equivalent to the Camelot that was the Kennedy era, giving us only a fast montage that includes a reference to a glittering White House dinner party where Neil Diamond entertained and ""Greg and Vronique Peck"" headed the guest list. If Mort Fine, who wrote the original screenplay, had shown any point of view elsewhere in the script, you might think this was meant to be funny. However, the film is as witless as it is gutless.Most of it is devoted to the courtship and marriage of Liz Cassidy (Miss Bisset) and Theo Tomasis (Mr. Quinn), about whom the writer and J. Lee Thompson, the director, would like to have it both ways. They portray Liz as being deeply in love with both her husbands (in succession) but having a teeny tiny weakness for shopping, and Theo as a brilliant international pirate with a heart of gold, a fellow who loves Liz but loves what she represents even more.Though at 106 minutes the film seems as lone as ""The Other Side of Midnight,"" which ran 160 minutes, ""The Greek Tycoon"" is only truly intolerable when it attempts to be serious, as when Mr. Quinn talks with supposed feeling about his humble peasant origins or deals lovingly with his son and heir, played by Edward Albert. But then it's not even fun when it's wrestling with its gossipy subject at a skin-deep level, perhaps because our fantasies outrun those of the moviemakers. Played straight, though the laughs are built-in, is the sequence about the notorious wedding contract, which guarantees the bride $10 million for every year she remains married to the Greek. This prompts Liz to recoil in disgust (""It's horriblewriting it all down!), while Theo explains patiently that it's simply an old Greek custom.The performances are uniformly awful, which is a record not easily matched by any movie not made by Larry (""It Lives Again"") Cohen. Miss Bisset is great to look at, but ""The Greek Tycoon"" is the sort of movie in which a fine-looking woman can be upstaged by a boat. This is the magnificent yacht, owned in real life by William Levitt, which doubles as Theo Tomasis's La Belle Simone.""The Greek Tycoon,"" which opens today at Loews State II and other theaters, is fiction divided against itself. It would make no sense if we hadn't read the headlines and gossip columns, to titillate us.",1978-05-12T05:00:00+0000

If it doesn't copy the precise ending of ""Carrie,"" the reasons appear to have been financial rather than esthetic ones. Instead of marshaling an entire special-effects department to help Jennifer (Lisa Pelikan) trash her hometown, the film merely shows her summoning up ""the vengeance of the viper."" After that, giant snakes appear. They bite all the right people.B-movie knock-offs ordinarily tend toward campiness, but ""Carrie"" is a hard act to follow in that department, So ""Jennifer"" is every bit as sane and solemn as ""Carrie"" was outlandish. The class consciousness ""Carrie"" hinted at is more pronounced here: Jennifer's vicious archenemy (Amy Johnston) is the daughter of a senator played by John Gavin, with her own Mercedes for joy riding and assorted B's, G's and YSL's placed prominently on her clothing. Lest anyone miss the point, she also knows Warren Beatty, has dated John Travolta and smokes her cigarettes from a holder.All things considered, ""Jennifer"" could be a whole lot worse. The cast, which includes Nina Foch, Jeff Corey, Florida Friebus and Bert Convy, is more reputable than the material might warrant, and while Miss Pelikan is not Sissy Spacek by a long shot, she does have a suitably spooky look in her eye.""Jennifer,"" which is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains the aforementioned snakes, fleeting nudity and a rape that takes place mostly off camera.",1978-05-13T05:00:00+0000

Two films that had been scheduled to be shown in that festival""Memories of Underdevelopment"" and ""Lucia""were successfully released in this country later.""The Teacher,"" made last year, is the first narrative feature by Octavio Cortazar. 'It's set in early 1961 and isabout the adventures of a 15-year-old Havana boy, Mario, who goes as a student-teacher into the remote Zapata swamps as a member of President Fidel Castro's Conrado Benitez Brigade, whose mission was to eliminate illiteracy. In the course of his mission, Mario not only teaches the peasants to read but also learns to overcome his own various fears (of spiders, rats, death), participates in the successful repulsion of the Bay of Pigs invaders and learns how to chop down trees, make charcoal, shoot wild boars and catch alligators.Part political parable, part discreet love story, part melodrama, part nature movie, ""The Teacher"" has something for everyone in its home market. For us, it makes Cuba look like a gigantic camp. No scene passes without someone's heartily clapping someone else on the back. It is nicely acted and set but is much less interesting as cinema than as a interim report on what the Cuban Government and Cuban film makers think they can contribute to the revolution's success.For a glimpse of much more provocative kind of Cuban film making today, one should see ""The Last Supper,"" now at the 68th Street Playhouse. It's the work of Tomas Gutierrez Alea, whose ""Memories of Underdevelopment"" is one of the best films to come from any country in the last 10 years.",1978-05-14T05:00:00+0000

us,'Nunzio' Film Portrays Man Who's a Child:The Cast,"Like ""Rocky,"" ""Nunzio"" is a movie that tells you what to feel and then twists your arm anyway, just to make sure you're still paying attention. The resemblance ends there, since ""Rocky"" was miraculously able to pull off a ploy that, in ""Nunzio,"" is merely ex-asperating. It's not for nothing that the ads for the film show its title apparently scrawled in crayon; this is a blunt manipulative movie full of strong-arm tactics, with a central point that is made, then reiterated, and then endlessly underscored. There aren't any fine points to ""Nunzio,"" nor are there any true background details. If the director, Paul Williams, wants something to be noticed, he simply shoots it in close-up.The title character is a 31-year-old man with the mindand the innocence, and the goodness of heart and so onof a child. As played by David Proval, the excellent actor who appeared as the bartender in ""Mean Streets,"" Nunzio is part Rocky, part Superman and part David Berkowitz, a wide-eyed, unnervingly uncommunicative eccentric. On those few occasions when the film allows the character to mesh with his surroundings or behave comfortably, Mr. Proval brings an eerie accuracy to the character's lumbering movements, his strange habit of repeating phrases over and over, his fierce concentration on tasks that would strike anyone else as easy, and his childish eye for unusual details.However, neither Nunzio nor the audience is ever allowed much room to breath. When the character is alone, he is almost always seen doing something attention-getting, like dressing up in a cape and sweat-shirt with a great big ""N"" across the chest. When he is with the others, Mr. Williams never focuses the scene sharply enough to suggest either how Nunzio accommodates himself to others or how his friends and family feel when they aren't humoring him.None of the film's supporting characters seem to have lives that extend beyond the confines of the screenplay. The gang of Brooklyn toughs who pick on Nunzio are occasionally seen talking among themselves, but their conversation invariably looks and sounds as if it is being conducted for the camera's benefit. It becomes impossible to believe that soft-spoken, ineffectual Nunzio figures as influentially in the lives of half the population of Brooklyn as the screenplay insists he does.James Andronica, who wrote the script and appears in the large role of Nunzio's brother, overwrites in the same way that he overacts. Mr. Andronica, a muscular actor who combines a toughness strongly reminiscent of Harvey Keitel's with extreme effusiveness, alternates fits of weeping or hugging with elaborate shows of forcefulness. Either way, the hey-ma-look-at-me aspects of his performance are distracting and, even worse, commonplace.Some of the other players, particularly Mr. Proval, work hard to elevate ""Nunzio"" from the ranks of run-of-the-mill Italian family melodramas. But Mr. Andronica's mannerisms are so stereo-typically attached to that genre, and his script is so much a case of a situation's masquerading as an actual story, that they overwhelm the film's few half-hearted bids for originality.""Nunzio"" is either for audiences who've never seen an Italian family on screen before, or for viewers who need to be convinced that the retarded are somtimes capable of doing wonderful things, and that they therefore ought to be treated with respect.""Nunzio"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") because of a sex scene that has been trimmed, presumably to avoid an R ratine. As a result, the scene no longer makes sense.",1978-05-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Ray Satirizes Indian Nobility:Civilized Impotency,"IT IS 1856 in the beautiful city of Lucknow, the capital of Oudh, one of the last independent states in the north of India. ""The King,"" the narrator tells us, ""didn't much like to rule but he was proud of his crown,"" an elaborate, jewel-encrusted headdress that had been publicly exhibited in London. Instead of ruling, the King prefers to compose poems and songs and to while away his time with his wives.The British East India Company is preparing to gobble up Oudh, but to do this legally, it must persuade the King to sign a new treaty of what's euphe-mistically called friendship.While all this is going on, two friends, wealthy Lucknow noblemen named Mirza and Mir, carry on a non-stop chess tournament. There are no stakes other than their egos. The two men are obsessed with the game to such an extent that one of them has no time for his lovely young wife (Shabana Azmi), while the other is the last person in Lucknow to know that his wife has made him a cuckold.""The Chess Players,"" Satyajt Ray's new film that opens today at the Little Carnegie, is social satire of a sort that is so graceful, so polite, so balanced and in such good taste, that it virtually amounts to a shrug: This is the way it was, Mr. Ray seems to be saying. So be it.Though it is often witty, ""The Chess Players"" lacks the passion that guides the intelligence and can make urgent the most remote of problems. More than anything else, I suppose, it is stately. Watching it is like being witness to a formal ceremony. One admires the costumes, the perfectly picked-up cues, the elegance of the principals, the complicated footwork, the manner in which an entire civilization has been encapsulated in a few particular gestures. Yet one is always a little ahead of the film. It's unable to surprise us.Some of this must be the intention of Mr. Ray. He's not trying to keep us on the edge of our seats but to make us contemplate a bit of history, not because of any special parallels to our own times but because it has to do with the birth-life-death rhythm of all civilizations. He's not outraged. Sometimes he's amused; most often he's meditative, and unless you respond to this mood, the movie is so overly polite you may want to shout a rude word.""The Chess Players"" becomes epigrammatic in form as it cuts among its three arenas of action, which are the equivalent to plot lines. There is the nonstop chess game and the minor irritations that must be faced by the two friends played by Sanjeev Kumar and Saeed Jaffreywho was so good as the sly Indian guide in ""The Man Who Would Be King.""Then there are the scenes in the British resident's office in which Richard Attenborough, as the resident, talks, very intelligently, about British policy in India, and the scenes in the palace where we watch the King at play and, finally, as he comes to the realization that he's been checkmated and that the best he can do is to retire with honor.The film is not without feelings, but they are muted, reined-in. There's resignation everywhere, even in the line, ""The Indians invented the game but the British changed the rules,"" and especially at the end when the two chess players, having escaped from Lucknow for a day of uninterrupted chess-playing in the country, wonder whether they should return to the city, now occupied by British troops, ""If we can't cope with our wives,"" one of the chess players says to the other, ""how can we cope with the British Army?""Actually it's a funny line, and it's meant to be, but it also reflects the civilian impotency that is the film's subtext.",1978-05-17T05:00:00+0000

In the summer of 1976, Mr Herzog read a newspaper article predicting a volcanic eruption on the tropical island of Guadeloupe. A day and a half later he and two cameramen had arrived on the spot all the way from Germany, readyand peculiarly eagerto photograph the end of the world.What they found were the deserted city of Basse-Terre, packs of starving dogs, snakes that had been frightened out of the mountains and then drowned in the sea, billowing clouds of noxious gas, and an exquisitely unearthly silence.""La Soufrire,"" named for the volcanowhich never erupted, although there had been every indication that it wouldis Mr. Herzog's brave and unforgettable vision of the wrath of God, informed by the peculiarly ironic logic of catastrophe. At the turn of the century, when a volcano erupted on the nearby island of Martinique, Mr. Herzog explains, the sole survivor was the island's wickedest criminal, because he had been imprisoned underground.Provocative, contemplative and very beautiful, ""La Soufrire"" will be shown this weekend and next at the Film Forum, from Thursday through Sunday each time. On the same bill is a later short Herzog film, made for German television, entitled ""How Much Wood Would a Woodchuck Chuck: Observation on a New Language."" The film is a documentary account of the World Championship contest for livestock; auctioneers, conducted in the Amish country of Pennsylvania. The title comes from a tongue-twister that one of the contestants uses to practice.Since the auctioneers' language is unintelligible to anyone save potential cattle buyers, the film becomes a study of gestures, a chance to view the contestants' near-fanatical animation in abstract terms. The auctioneers' absolute dedication to an unfathomable craft has the kind of freakishness that has often fascinated Herzog in the past, and here he once again examines odd behavior with distance and clarity. This is a much slighter film than ""La Soufrire,"" but it is still a work of considerable interest.",1978-05-18T05:00:00+0000

Miss Plain-Jane finds romance. The womanizing owner meets his comeuppance. A dance-crazy Mexican-American wins the big contest, and an unknown singer, played by Donna Summer, in her film debut, begins her climb to stardom. Miss Summer, whose wigs are as elaborate as Diana Ross's, is competition for the superb Miss Ross in no department other than hair.The film, which opens today at the Criterion and other theaters, was directed by Robert Klane (who wrote the novel on which ""Where's Poppa?"" was based) and written by Barry Armyan Bernstein in the breathless, multinarrative manner of ""Car Wash,"" which gives one the impression that a good deal is happening even when the movie is standing still.Among the actors who fare best are Chick Vennera, as the Mexican-American fellow who has the film's only good number, an exuberant disco dance on the tops of the cars in the Zoo's parking lot; Ray Vitte, who was in ""Car Wash."" as the Zoo's manic disk jockey; Valerie Landsburg and Terri Nunn, as two extremely underage patrons, and Jeff Goldblum, who played the rock critic in ""Between the Lines,"" as the Zoo's pushy manager.The Commodores come on to play themselves in the finale, which is not much different from any other part of the movie. The dcor of the Zoo is suitably garish and looks dangerously flammable. I would have felt easier while watching the movie if I'd known where the exits were.There is nothing in the way of explicit sex or nudity in ""Thank God It's Friday,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), though the language is sometimes vulgar and there is one sequence involving the use of various kinds of drugs, uppers and downers, that is supposed to be funny but isn't.",1978-05-19T05:00:00+0000

Faulkner was chiefly a writer's writer, the subject of brilliant essays by Conrad Aiken and Robert Penn Warren, but he had been forced to supplement his income by doing movie scripts in Hollywood. Then success came in like a tide. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1950. His fame coincided with the postWorld War II boom in literary scholarship; and by now Faulkner has been overlaid by more articles, dissertations and books than almost any other American writer. But we still lack a firstrate book about him. Cleanth Brooks's is not that book, but it does two important things: it reaffirms the distinctive character of Southern culture both explicitly and by the implications of its critical method, and it gives the best account of the work Faulkner did in the 1920's as an intellectually gawky and emotionally moonstruck beginner.",1978-05-21T05:00:00+0000

At the time, despite the many people who worked on it and a performance by Ben Vereen as the Leading Player that made him a star, what Pippin really seemed to be was a showcase for the dazzling talents of Bob Fosse as directorchoreographer. His dance numbers were breathtaking, his staging electric, and he had the good sense to stage the show without an intermission, preventing the audience from leaving out of weariness with the book. For underneath all the razzledazzle, Pippin seemed a bore.

And yet beneath Balanchine's very modern conception in which Don Quixote becomes the narrator as well as hero, the old Petipa ballet still found its echo. Many scenes such as the prologue, the market place of Act I, the puppet show, the divertissements at the Duke's court and the dream of Dulcinea and the dryads, had their counterpart in the Don Quixote, descended from the 1869 Petipa original, as amended by Alexander Gorsky, which Balanchine remembered as a child from the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg.

us,Nervous Breakdowns,"ALAN LELCHUK'S first novel, American Mischief, which came out in 1973 after enormous prepublication ballyhoo, capitalized upon campus unrest; its chief characters were a dean with a harem of six women and a student rebel who, among other exploits, murdered Norman Mailer in an undignified fashion and kidnapped 10 of the nation's top (and readily identifiable) intellectuals. The second novel, Miriam at Thirtyfour (1975), depicted a woman whose progressive sexual liberation led to schizophrenic complicity in her own rape. Both novels were roughly treated by a number of reviewers who objected to what they saw as trendiness and exploitation. Shrinking, Mr. Lelchuk's third, deals with the events leading to the second breakdown of one Lionel Solomon, a 38yearold novelist and teacher of creative writing at a university not unlike Brandeis. Solomon's first breakdown, we are told, resulted from savage reviews of his novels by critics who were outraged by their explicit sexual content. As if anticipating a similar fate for the huge manuscript that makes up the bulk of Shrinking, its fictional author (whose career parallels that of Mr. Lelchuk in a number of respects) invites the reader to compare the reception of his earlier novels with the equally disastrous reception of Melville's Moby Dick.",1978-05-21T05:00:00+0000

Indeed, no other sculptor of our timeAmerican or otherwisehas extended the interests of modern sculpture into so many areas of public life while continuing to produce with a prodigal abundance and exquisite invention the kind of smallscale art object that, whether encountered in a museum, a gallery or a private collection, affords an essentially private experience. Mr. Noguchi is at once one of the purest of living sculptors, having sustained and refined for half a century a commitment to the kind of absolute form first glimpsed in the work of his master, Brancusi, and one of the most socially oriented, exulting the large public projects in which this world of ideal form obliged to accommodate itself to the rude demands of daily use. He has designed parks and playgrounds, outdoor sculpture, gardens, fountains and public plazas, for some of the world's busiest cities. He has worked a good deal in the theater, especially in collaboration with Martha Graham; and with his series of akari lamps, he has produced one of the classics of modern interior design. Earlier this year, his 36foothigh sculpture, called Portal, was installed on the plaza of the Justice Center in Clevelandit was discussed on this page on February 19and later this year an even more immense enterprise, the Civic Center Plaza occupying acres of downtown Detroit and crowned with a huge fountain, will be completed.

All three have been acclaimed by an impressive array of critics, reviewers and fellow novelists, who range from the familiar bookchat folks to Philip Roth and Denis Donoghue, Mary McCarthy and Richard Gilman, who almost never commit blurbs. These young writers deserve praise: they are strong and original and clearly in touch with life, not just with literary games and fashions.

You'd have to go back to Richard Wilbur's The Beautiful Changes, which Mr. Shaw's book recalls in tone and stance as well as talent. The key, perhaps, is that he wants to comfort rather than confront the wilderness, not to deny it, but to come to human, nurturing terms with chaos by practiced measures. His virtues are many, both wished for and exemplified, and they reach back through Frost to Ben Jonson and even to Horace. But the Augustan balance doesn't eliminate a modern irony and suspicion. Mr. Shaw's leading virtue may be his need to habituate the twisted, and his Janus, gargoyle and jacko'lantern are made more humanly revealing than the humans who made them.

us,Film: Adman's Romance,"WHAT sort of scenery comes to mind when you dream about falling in love? Are you the kind of romantic who envisions purple sunsets, walks along the beach, orange sunsets, more walks along the beach horseback rides  deux, sailboat rides  deux, and ice cream cones  deux, all accompanied by a dangerously overworked string section? If so, ""If Ever I See You Again,"" which opens today at Loews Tower East, would like very, very much to be your kind of movie. However, as the film itself readily acknowledges, in song and story and encounter-group jargon, wishes don't always come true.On the outside, ""If Ever I See You Again"" is the treacly stuff-and-nonsense of which greeting cards are made. On the inside, though, something quite different is going on.The story is about Bobby Morrison (Joe Brooks), a composer of jingles who has, in the words of one of his friends, ""made the big time."" He's rich, he's in demand, he uses a huge photograph of himself to adorn what he would undoubtedly call his work space, and he has been profiled in TV Guide. However, there's one thing Bobby lacks: Jennifer Corly (Shelley Hack), a college sweetheart who jilted him 12 years ago.This episode has taken just enough wind out of Bobby's capacious sails to make him vow to track Jennifer down, a decision that smacks at least as much of revenge as it does of romance. The main thing Bobby wants, he half-jokes, is to know that Jennifer has seen that TV Guide story about him.His wish is more than granted: not only is Jennifer gorgeous easy to find and conveniently unattached, but she has also read the article and loved it all by herself. Even better, she admits to Bobby that the fellow she preferred to him years ago is now a dress manufacturer of no particular renown. ""Oh, I love it, I love it!"" Bobby gloats, very unbecomingly.As played by Mr. Brooks, Bobby is an ambitious egomaniac whose immodesty knows no bounds, and this makes him something less than the ideal leading man. As played by Miss Hack, Jennifer is just one more model with a monotone.Miss Hack, perhaps best known as the star of Revlon's ""Charlie"" ads, made a previous movie appearance in ""Annie Hall,"" as half of a beautiful couple Woody Allen approaches in the street. Mr. Allen asks them how they manage to look so radiant, and Miss Hack replies in essence, that maybe it's because they haven't a thought in either of their heads. Here, in a role that has her gazingly either adoringly or sadly at Mr. Brooks and saying things like ""I'm not a forever person,"" she generates much the same mood.The only redeeming feature of her performance is the way in which, whenever she is called on to do anything silly, Mr. Brooks promptly does something sillier. For example, after Miss Hack watches Mr. Brooks conducting an orchestra in a recording studio, she cries out. ""It's unbelievable! Unbelievable!"" Replies Mr. Brooks, with a completely unconvincing display of bashfulness: ""It's what I do for a living.""Actually, what the real Mr. Brooks did for a living before he wrote, produced, scored and starred in ""If Ever I See You Again"" was exactly what the character Bobby Morrison does: compose enormously popular commercials. The hit song from his first film, ""You Light Up My Life,"" was an illustration of the overlap between pop and commercial music at a time when Top-40 radio had become particularly tepid.This time, Mr. Brooks has tried to one-up himself by filling the screen with the visual imagery of television commercials as well as with their sounds. When an airplane is shown taking off for California, accompanied by one of Mr. Brooks's songs, it truly seems to be flying the friendly skies of United.Early in the film, there is enough turnabout and self-mockery to suggest that the director is aiming for something halfway between caricature and salesmanship. But his send-ups of the advertising business quickly turn nasty, and it becomes all too apparent that Mr. Brooks is both extremely talented and contemptuous of his own gifts.It's easy to see why he was so resoundingly well suited to his former line of work, but as a film director he has not yet progressed beyond the visual monotony of most television direction, nor does he risk much in his pacing. The film is entirely without dramatic highs or lows.Mr. Brooks's title song this time sounds much too much like his title song last time, but his real gaffe is a song called ""California,"" which includes a syrupy lyric about how ""the winds called Santa Ana make you feel that you belong."" The Santa Ana winds, as they have been vividly described by Joan Didion and other Californian writers, are a nightmare. Mr. Brooks's peppy presentation of them can't help but make one wonder what was really in those soft drinks and fun foods he used to help sell, in his earlier more appropriate incarnation.""I Ever I See You Again"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It includes a love scene between Mr. Brooks and Miss Hack that is strictly soft-focus, in every way.",1978-05-24T05:00:00+0000

The gang is really not so young since its leader, a fellow named Rommel (Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs of ""Cooley High""), is a married Vietnam vet coping with the horrors of civilian life.""Youngblood"" tries to walk down both sides of the street at the same time. The gang is depicted as not above murder and other forms of antisocial behavior, though it becomes as righteous as a Sunday school group when one gang member dies of a dose of a bad drug. Most of the film is about the gang's attempts to bust the narcotics racket, which is complicated by the fact that Youngblood's older brother is a chief pusher.The performances seem less bad than thin. There isn't much in the way of material to work with. Instead, the actors display all these loose-jointed, no-longer-hip mannerisms that, one s???uspects, they've learned from watching dozens of other movies exactly like this one.",1978-05-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Here Come Tigers':The Bears Are Back,"IF stock were carbon paper the 14th or 15th copy of ""The Bad News Bears"" might resemble ""Here Come the Tigers,"" a low-budget Little League epic of no particular zest or stamina. Once again, a team of cute little no-accounts is coached toward victory by an older fellow from the neighborhood, even though the kids curse better than they play. Once again, success comes only after the team adds a couple of unlikely new players, in this case a karate-champ batter and a deaf pitcher.There are new touches, too, none of them helpful. The coach, played by Richard Lincoln, has a warm, understanding smile that just won't quit, even when it ought to. The kid's shout things like ""Cram it!"" and complain about one another's flatulence a lot, but for the most part they're pretty subdued; the adults, on the other hand, overact like crazy.And even though a Little League movie might be the last place you'd expect to find a sad song accompanying a wistful-walk-along-the-beach scene, there is one here, to mark a particularly tender moment between a boy and his coach.On the evidence of this film and others, like the ""Exorcist""-based ""Abby"" and the current ""Jennifer,"" American International Pictures seems to believe that there's money to be made on the film equivalent of elevator music, on toned-down versions of guaranteed hits. That may be true, but as the only person to see the film's 11 A.M. show at the Guild Theater, where it opened yesterday, I have reason to have my doubts.""Here Come the Tigers"" was shot in Westport, Conn.

Born in 1939 and the author of five previous works of fiction, Oz saw action on the Golan Heights during the perilous combat in 1973. The Hill of Evil Counsel, made up of three interwoven stories written in 1974 and 1975, is his oblique reaction, an indirect comment on Israel's status as a nation. He turns back to the world that preceded the first ArabIsraeli war of 1948, the Jerusalem of his boyhood, the crucial last years of the British Mandate over Palestine.
