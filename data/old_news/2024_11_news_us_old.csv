Four years later, the 625-square-foot plot has grown into a one-acre farm with greenhouses and a herd of Mangalitsa pigs, known for their lard. At the end of October, Nallo and Nussdorf opened Restaurant Manor Rock in Hudson, N.Y., a 20-minute drive from their farm. Much of the produce, like the patchwork peppers and the Barbarella eggplants, comes from their land, as does the pork for their loin chops and charcuterie. Nussdorf briefly worked as a line cook at the Michelin-starred Brooklyn restaurant the Four Horsemen. Here, he and the chef Diego Romo, previously of Gem and Estela in Manhattan, are making simple, seasonal dishes, like grilled squid with turnips and potatoes cooked in Mangalitsa lard. Before it hosted a string of restaurants, Manor Rock’s Warren Street space was a townhouse. It was overhauled earlier this year by the design and architecture firm Charlap Hyman & Herrero, who outfitted the restaurant with porcelain sconces, cream-colored walls and a red-oak bar made of trees from Manor Rock Farm. “We wanted it to feel like it’s been here for the last hundred years,” Nallo says. instagram.com/manorrockfarm.",2024-11-07T17:39:43+0000

Meant to ornament a tabletop, it initially had an electric butler’s bell inside its funnel. Over the following decades, the house’s decorative objects and jewelry would return to their maritime iconography: a 1935 minaudière was adorned with a three-pronged platinum-and-diamond-encrusted clasp resembling a trio of overlapping sails billowing in the wind; pendant charms from the mid-20th century depicted nautical scenes with bejeweled sloops and lapis lazuli waves.",2024-11-11T10:02:12+0000

Though Pauling and Ossipoff had hardly spoken before their meeting, he decided to roll up his sleeves and help fix the delicate cylindrical lantern. As Pauling shared his dreams of building an elemental house from locally sourced materials with lots of space for books and an open kitchen, dining and sitting room where he could cook and converse with friends and family, a bond that would span generations was born. By the end of their meeting, the two men had not only mended the lampshade (Ossipoff’s granddaughter donated it to the Noguchi Museum in New York City this past July) but Ossipoff had sketched the beginnings of Pauling’s house, which would be successfully completed within just a couple of years.",2024-11-12T10:04:18+0000

us,"Amaranths Were Nearly Wiped Out by Colonization. Now, They’re Making a Return.","Around March, the valleys to the north and east of Cuzco, Peru, begin to gleam with pink and crimson — “crowned with amaranth,” the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once wrote, “as with flame.” Native to South America, this scentless species of amaranth (Amaranthus caudatus), distinctive for its tentacle-like inflorescences, is prized for the nutty-tasting, protein-rich seeds that develop from its flowers. (Its leaves are also edible.) Known in Peru by its Quechua name, kiwicha, it was domesticated by Andean peoples some 3,000 years ago and later became a source of sustenance for the Incas and their contemporaries. (A different variety of amaranth was grown by the Aztecs of Mexico.) But the 16th-century Spanish colonizers, writes Jamaica Kincaid in “An Encyclopedia of Gardening for Colored Children” (2024), forced the Incas and the Aztecs to abandon their crops and replace them “with barley, wheat and other European grains.”",2024-11-14T10:00:46+0000
us,Why Do Flowers Mean So Much to Us?,"A flower is beautiful, and that above all is why we love them. But often, and in many places, a flower is also much more — it’s a food, a lucrative export, a symbol. There’s a reason why, throughout history, different people in different places have lost their minds over one flower or another (the tulip most famously, but not only); a flower is both a seductive object and a metaphor, a receptacle for whatever kind of meaning we bestow upon it.",2024-11-14T10:00:47+0000

us,"Food, Offering, Medicine, Political Symbol: What the Lotus Means in Sri Lanka","IN ONE SWIFT movement, Asoka swung his machete into the side of a tree and left the hooked blade lodged in its trunk. The Sri Lankan lotus farmer was in his late 40s, with dark, leathery skin, a graying soul patch and lips stained red from betel nut. He placed his phone in the branches and gestured to me to remove my shoes. The grass felt like rubber under my feet on that February morning. Mud oozed between my toes. “Pankaja,” I murmured to myself, “mud born.” It is one of over 40 words for the sacred lotus flower (Nelumbo nucifera) in Sanskrit. I rolled my corduroys up to my knees and we began to wade into the lake, which Asoka, whose full name is Y.G.W. Dissinayake, had rented for cultivation. The rising sun suffused the thin mist that hung over the water. We soon stood in several inches of soft mud and murky water, surrounded by a colony of lotuses. There were calyxes of faded pink, others in full bloom, with yellowish-white interiors and petals of translucent brightness, sheltered by broad, nodding leaves and curled, elliptical buds. Most beguiling of all was the fruiting receptacle. It looked like something that a spacecraft might have jettisoned as it breached the Earth’s atmosphere — a magical cup of unbelievable hardiness in whose waxy surface the beanlike seeds of the lotus lay embedded, with the power to fruit even after a thousand years.",2024-11-14T10:01:07+0000
us,How the Protea Became a Symbol for South Africa,"Before there were seven continents, there were proteas. Related to sycamores and to the sacred lotus, they’re native to what’s now Australia and South America, as well as to South Africa, where they’re most abundant in the Cape Floristic Region, a biodiverse swath of land in the country’s southwest. Wanderers of its peaks, valleys and dunes might miss the Protea nana, also known as the skaamblom, or “shy flower,” because its bell-shaped blooms advance downward into the brush, but there are plenty of other species to see. (The name “protea” comes from the shape-shifting Greek god Proteus.) There’s the Pink Mink, whose petals are tipped with black hairs; the spiky-soft pincushion protea, with its dome of protruding styles; and the King protea, characterized by an oversize inflorescence featuring a ring of bracts surrounding an orblike grouping of velvety florets.",2024-11-14T10:01:55+0000

In cities and towns across India, vendors display them heaped into small mountains or strung into ropes, which are used to adorn the necks of newlyweds or to embellish ceremonial altars.

It could explain why these blooms — which range from baroque and blowsy to subtle and delicate — inspire particular passion among botanical enthusiasts: In them, we see a reflection of ourselves. That’s especially true in Papua New Guinea, where the scale and diversity of orchids holds a mirror to the country itself, which is home to some 850 distinct languages and about as many tribes. More than 3,800 species of orchids have been identified on the island of New Guinea, the eastern half of which comprises most of Papua New Guinea, but Mary Gerritsen, the president of the California-based Orchid Conservation Alliance and a frequent leader of orchid-spotting trips to Papua New Guinea, estimates that there could be more than a thousand species yet to be documented.",2024-11-14T10:02:10+0000
us,How the World’s Most Expensive Spice Is Grown,"Its vibrant purple petals notwithstanding, the saffron flower (Crocus sativus) is valued primarily for what hides beneath those petals: tiny, fiery orange stamens that, once plucked and processed, become the world’s most expensive spice, one that adds sweet flavor and deep golden color to dishes as culinarily disparate as Spanish paella, South Asian pulao and Swedish St. Lucia buns. Known botanically as a triploid owing to its three sets of chromosomes, the saffron crocus can neither grow wild nor reproduce without human intervention. Instead the plant must be propagated and harvested manually, a laborious undertaking that Bronze Age Greeks are believed to have pioneered and that helps account for its price. Today saffron is grown in a latitudinal belt that runs from the Mediterranean to South Asia, with Iran currently contributing about 85 percent of the global supply. But saffron from Kashmir is arguably the most highly prized, says Sana Javeri-Kadri, whose seven-year-old Oakland, Calif.-based spice business, Diaspora Spice Co., sources its inventory from a small family farm in the Kashmiri town of Pampore, where the flowers have been cultivated since at least the 12th century. Harvested between late October and early November, the saffron there grows alongside apricots and almonds in particularly porous soil that’s fed by nutrient-rich snowmelt all spring. The result is an extra-potent crop redolent of almonds and honey that’s hand-processed, with each individual stamen massaged to bring its natural oils to the surface. The beauty of the valley during the saffron bloom, she says, is almost otherworldly. “The light is buttery yellow, the leaves of the fruit trees are bright orange and the ground is blanketed in purple flowers,” says Javeri-Kadri, who has attended Pampore’s fall harvest for three years running. “I’ve never seen those colors together in nature before. It’s stunning.”",2024-11-14T10:02:20+0000

The flowers are handpicked at dawn and then placed in solvent-filled extraction tanks where the liquid is distilled, steamed and cooled overnight before re-emerging as a waxlike paste that’s then shipped to perfumeries around the world.",2024-11-14T10:02:20+0000

For several weeks between August and November, depending on the intensity of the year’s monsoons, farmers and other locals, mostly women, wade through murky shallows at dawn to collect the day-blooming Nymphaea nouchali and the night-blooming Nymphaea rubra, the two varieties most commonly found in Africa and Asia. There are roughly 85 species in the waterlily family, Nymphaeaceae, native to temperate and tropical climates around the world and descendants of the planet’s oldest flowering plants. Fossilized seeds found in northern Japan in 1997 are believed to be about 85 million years old. In ancient Egypt, pharaohs, including King Tutankhamen (circa 1341-23 B.C.), were buried with blue waterlilies.

I Was Denied Boarding While Pregnant.,"On the evening of July 19, six members of my family were set to fly La Compagnie, a French business-class-only airline, from Newark Liberty International Airport to Nice, France, for a long-planned trip that included the Paris Olympics. When my husband and I arrived at the airport, the other four had already gone through security. The La Compagnie agent congratulated me on my (obvious) pregnancy and asked how far along I was. I answered truthfully: 28 weeks and a day. She said I needed a letter from my doctor saying I was OK to fly. But every doctor and midwife I had spoken to about the trip reassured me it was safe, including the midwife I saw the day before at my 28-week checkup. Even though she was attending someone else’s labor that evening, she managed to send a letter, first through a patient portal and then via email directly to La Compagnie, along with her provider identifier number and, when the staff insisted, a photo of her hospital ID. But even after I did everything they asked, the agent told me the crew had determined I could not board. The La Compagnie desk was closing for the night, and the agent gave me a number to call to rebook. But with no guarantee I would be able to fly, even if there were seats available in the coming days, we booked a flight for the next evening on Air France for about $6,560 each — a steep increase from our $3,530 La Compagnie tickets. La Compagnie offered to return the original $3,530 each, but I believe they were wrong to deny us boarding and should compensate us for the cost of the last-minute flight instead. Can you help?

The 1939 film with Judy Garland, in particular, is so embedded in the American cinematic DNA that it’s inspired everyone from Martin Scorsese to David Lynch, Spike Lee and John Waters, who once called (accurately!) the wicked witch “every bad little boy’s and girl’s dream of notoriety and style.”",2024-11-21T10:03:30+0000

On a 15-foot-tall Christmas tree spangled with red ribbon at Roman and Williams’s SoHo boutique, Crowder hung ornaments made from spiky datura seed pods and clusters of pine cones adorned with acorns. “We had an excess of them in the studio from other holiday projects,” says Crowder of the materials, “and we were trying to figure out, ‘How do we reuse these in a new, interesting way?’” She’s now selling the two designs through her website, along with a cocoon-like diamond of lichen, all strung from black velvet ribbons.

In the early 20th century, the emblem of the N.A.A.C.P. house organ, “The Crisis,” looked like a sphinx, and many covers featured beautiful Egyptian motifs. In the 1990s, many thinkers warmly embraced the book “Black Athena” by the historian Martin Bernal, which made the claim — since rather roundly debunked — that the ancient Greeks had stolen much of the glory of their culture from “Black” Egypt. So strong has this current of thought been that it fills an exhibition currently on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art titled “Flight Into Egypt: Black Artists and Ancient Egypt, 1876-Now.”",2024-11-21T20:00:07+0000
