us,Abrams Fires Back,"THE TELEVISION SCRIPT Narrator: Bob Abrams. His record squeaky clean. His reputation beyond reproach. But Al D'Amato. Scandal after scandal. Housing grants for his friends. Contracts for his contributors. And backroom deals for his brother. A Senate ethics investigation concluded D'Amato allowed his office to be systematically misused for personal gain. Now D'Amato is attacking Bob Abrams' integrity? Come on, Al! Who do you think you're kidding? PRODUCER: Struble-Totten of Washington. ON THE SCREEN: Narration over a color picture of Abrams with newspaper mastheads and headlines. Black-and-white picture of Mr. D'Amato against an ominous-looking etching of the United States Capitol. Photograph of Mr. D'Amato with quotations from a Senate Ethics Committee report. Photograph of Mr. D'Amato with headlines of negative stories about him. Full-frame photograph of Mr. D'Amato for the final narration. ACCURACY: The statements referring to Mr. Abrams were taken from opinions on the editorial pages of the Buffalo News and the Troy Record. The quotations themselves are correct. ""Scandal"" is, of course, a word subject to interpretation -- it is indeed true that friends of Mr. D'Amato's, as well as his cousin, have gotten housing grants, and that contributors, including several defense firms, have gotten government contracts after Mr. D'Amato helped them. But Mr. D'Amato routinely says he helps all New Yorkers, whether they support him or not, and he has not been convicted of any crime. The ""personal gain"" cited in a Senate Ethics Committee investigation was not Mr. D'Amato's, but his brother's: the committee said Senator D'Amato had ""conducted the business of his office in an improper and inappropriate manner"" by allowing the brother, Armand, to use his office and official stationery for lobbying work on behalf of a client who was seeking a defense contract. The committee did not substantiate other allegations of improper influence on the Senator's part, although it said its investigation was hampered because about half its witnesses refused to testify after pleading Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination. SCORECARD: This ad is the Abrams campaign's response to recent D'Amato commercials that accused him of improper fundraising practices. The ""Come on, Al"" line at the end evokes the ""Really, Bob!"" conclusion of one D'Amato ad that mocks Mr. Abrams's claims of integrity. The ad will probably quiet fears of some Abrams supporters that the Democratic candidate was not fighting back and was allowing Mr. D'Amato to define him to voters. But it carries risks as well: for one thing, it reinforces the notion that somebody is out there criticizing Mr. Abrams on ethical grounds. And as with most negative ads, it gives free air time to the opponent: it is Mr. D'Amato whose face is on the screen during most of the commercial.",1992-10-01T05:00:00+0000

It's 1947, and Monk, 30 years old, is improvising. What he's doing makes no sense within the context of what's come before him. Though there's an obvious stride section in his solo and hints of Earl Hines and boogie pianists, there's a strange feeling of stasis, as if in the middle of a river, a patch of water refuses to move. Lines crisscross, and abrupt left-hand explosions come from nowhere. Instead of jazz's linear movement, Monk stops time, offering a new logic. Forty-five years later, the music's newness still startles.

Pet Poseurs","The twin volumes BLACK & WHITE DOGS and BLACK & WHITE CATS (Collins, $14.95 each), edited by J. C. Suares, offer both famous and anonymous photographs of dogs and cats. Each animal's face mirrors or mocks the mannerisms -- irritation, hamming, nonchalance, zeal -- that we humans reveal when having our picture taken. For example, in Dennis Mosner's shots, his unusual focal point is the animals' gaze. Meeting the lens, his subjects stare directly at us; it is as though he has enabled their expressions to flow across the distance between our species. Even when a cat or dog remains oblivious to the camera, the animal seems to stand in for us, offering a sense of ourselves. Cats are poseurs by nature: a camera insinuating itself -- much like an owner's commanding voice -- hardly diverts a cat from its natural inclinations. Dogs are more often caught amid their doggy doings, and even in midair, as in Jacques-Henri Lartigue's 1912 photo of a dog catapulting from its owner's arms. These photographs are true companion pieces -- whether they include notables like Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eva Gabor, Mark Twain and Alfred Hitchcock, or anonymous children. Though renowned photographers including Mary Ellen Mark, Edward Steichen and Robert Mapplethorpe occupy these pages, the real archive, as Mr. Suares, a writer, illustrator and book designer, points out, is contained in our own homes: 5 percent of the 16 billion pictures we take each year are of animals.",1992-10-04T05:00:00+0000

For one thing, there are not that many works to consider (though there are more than one might suppose, looking over schedules of American opera companies).

Angleton, still an undergraduate, was an energetic litterateur. He had visited Pound in Rapallo, Italy, had shared his enthusiasm for Mussolini. He was chummy with E. E. Cummings, met Marianne Moore, lunched with Thomas Mann and had brought in the ambiguous William Empson to lecture; he helped James Agee with the manuscript of ""Let Us Now Praise Famous Men."" Now, with his roommate, E. Reed Whittemore Jr., he was editing a poetry magazine called Furioso.

Making what may be his last appearance in Australia, McEnroe struggled early against the 115th-ranked qualifier. After breaking three times in the first set and dropping only 3 points in his own three service games, Olhovsky suddenly found himself unable to solve McEnroe's mix of spins and volleys. While McEnroe cashed in five of his six break-point opportunities, Olhovsky squandered all but three of his 16 chances. ""I got into a better rhythm as the match went on,"" said McEnroe, who could face Stefan Edberg, the top-seeded player and defending champion, in the quarterfinals. Also advancing to the round of 16 in the $1.1 million event were No. 2 Goran Ivanisevic, No. 5 Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, No. 6 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands and Patrik Kuhnen of Germany. McEnroe's brother, Patrick, was a first-round loser to Germany's Patrick Bauer in a third-set tie breaker. (AP) Borg Stumbles Again: Bjorn Borg's unsuccessful comeback took another turn for the worse when he lost to a 19-year-old French qualifier, Lionel Roux, 6-0, 6-4, in the first round of the $315,000 Toulouse Open in Toulouse, France. Borg had lost all seven previous first-round matches in ATP tournaments this year without winning a set. Roux was the lowest-ranked player Borg played on the regular circuit since coming back from retirement. (AP) SOCCER Officials Visit Stadium A technical committee from FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, inspected Giants Stadium yesterday to determine matters such as position of television cameras and the location of advertising billboards for the 1994 World Cup. The most significant development from the committee's visit was the determination that the dimensions of the playing field will be 66 meters wide and 103 meters long. These dimensions are 2 meters narrower and 2 meters shorter than the average dimensions for World Cup games. ""This is the most spectacular stadium in the world,"" said Guido Tognoni, the top press officer for FIFA. ""Not to play on it because it's one meter or less shorter would be a sin.""",1992-10-07T05:00:00+0000

It helps customers send letters to politicians, call them free of charge and contribute money to popular liberal causes. The year-old, San Francisco-based phone company, the only one of its kind, also donates 1 percent of its charges to a group of 36 nonprofit organizations that its customers help select in a poll once a year. Fifty thousand customers have the service, making it one of the largest resale phone companies. Resales buy time from A.T.& T., MCI or Sprint and generally charge slightly lower or comparable rates. This year, Working Assets has had revenues of $15 million. It expects, however, to post a loss in 1992. HOW IT WORKS: Customers are encouraged to round their phone bills up to the next $5 mark. The extra goes to groups like the Rain Forest Action Network, Planned Parenthood and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. Customers can also make a check mark next to one of two issue-oriented statements printed on the bill. (Sample statement: ""Urge your senators to vote for the Freedom of Choice Act and against any filibuster or veto."") A one-page letter on the selected subject is then sent to the relevant politicians. Charge: $3 for one letter; $4.50 for two. On the first Monday of each month, known as a ""free speech day,"" customers can make four free calls to the politicians mentioned in either statement. During the rest of the month, they get a 10 percent discount on those calls. Politicians' phone numbers are printed on the bill.",1992-10-11T05:00:00+0000

Jews, foreigners and Surrealists fled the city, and their galleries were ""Aryanized."" In ARTISTS UNDER VICHY: A Case of Prejudice and Persecution (Princeton University, $35), Michele C. Cone, the author of ""The Roots and Routes of Art in the Twentieth Century,"" defies what she calls an ""intolerable"" revisionism ""threatening the demarcation between villains and heroes, between collaborators and Resistance activists."" Thus her book is in two sections, one on the avengers of decadence and one on the scapegoats. Among those who thrived under Vichy were Aristide Maillol, Georges Rouault, Maurice de Vlaminck and Andre Derain. Not only were they non-Jewish (and often willing to sign a register saying so), they also painted in styles their occupiers liked; many were romantic realists (celebrating ideal human bodies) and Fauves (whose joyful colors blotted out ""world decadence""). As for the ""Judeo-Marxist-decadent"" artists (including Marc Chagall, Andre Masson and Max Ernst), most of them (with the notable exception of Pablo Picasso) took refuge outside Paris. Unable to exhibit in galleries, they often turned inward, producing self-portraits ""as if to reassure themselves of some continuity in their own self-images,"" and they used ""improvised materials"" because of shortages. Though Ms. Cone does not presume to ""lift the final veil from the imponderable factors"" affecting individual choices during the occupation, her admirable, detailed record documents exactly what those choices were.",1992-10-11T05:00:00+0000

Use color to transform a room, so it appears larger, smaller, subtler or more dramatic. Consider a clean and polished interior an absolute luxury for the senses. There are precedents for this new scrutiny. In the 1920's, Eugenia Errazuriz, a wealthy patron of Picasso's, pioneered a minimalist approach to the home that glorified cleanliness. ""If the kitchen is not as well kept as the salon . . . you cannot have a beautiful house,"" she declared. To Errazuriz, elbow grease was a decorating ingredient as important as good taste.

Teachers who purchase ""educational decor"" for their classrooms, instead of having the children produce the decorations have missed a few fundamental points concerning the development of critical thinking.

It was my understanding that once the mortgage was paid off, we would be free to sell our apartments for a profit, or at least have lower maintenances. Can the board take out another mortgage without a vote by the shareholders? . . . Linda Kay, Brooklyn. Answer: Yes.

Garth Brooks Takes a Cue From Rock","During the mid-80's, country music took a cue from rock and revived the singer-songwriter tradition. Steve Earle and Lyle Lovett, like Hank Williams, Loretta Lynn and Willie Nelson before them, offered their own songs in their own idiosyncratic voices. They went against the grain of the Nashville system, in which smooth singers interpreted the work of professional songwriters. The notion of the modern country singer-songwriter looked like a historic return to self-expression, but also an innovation. Of course, performers like Earle and Lovett failed to overthrow the system, but their confident examples altered the direction of the town's more ambitious singers. On his latest and finest album, ""The Chase"" (Liberty 98743; CD and cassette), Garth Brooks champions the cause.",1992-10-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Painting a Set Four Different Ways Shows How Color Alters The Perception of Space,"THERE'S not much left to the imagination here: The bare walls and ceiling of a set, designed by the architect Frederick Biehle and painted four different ways, demonstrate dramatically how color sculpts a room. The creator of the palettes, Ken Charbonneau, the color and merchandising manager of Benjamin Moore & Company, used the rule of thumb that cool colors recede and warm colors advance. On this page, the gray-violet of the walls and the blush of the ceiling are equally pale, minimizing boundaries and creating the illusion of spaciousness. ""The chair looks almost suspended,"" says Charbonneau. On the opposite page, the high contrast between the rich terra-cotta walls and the robin's egg-blue ceiling shrinks the room visually by emphasizing its borders. ""This intensity would work better in a hallway than in a space you have to live or work in,"" notes Charbonneau. When the walls are painted yellow, as on page tk, they reflect and amplify the light; the cooler tone of an off-white ceiling keeps the brilliance from being overwhelming. Green, shown on page tk, creates a more soothing atmosphere. In fact, Charbonneau sees new interest in green, a color he classifies as a neutral. Claiming it can be a background for any other hue, he invokes a higher authority: ""Does nature make a mistake?""",1992-10-11T05:00:00+0000

""You begin to wonder what color the paint really is,"" says Nicol. Deeper hues can also be softened with their complements. A bit of green stirred into red paint, for instance, makes the color less raw.

us,Bush: Letting the People Attack Clinton,"The Bush campaign began broadcasting a new 30-second commercial yesterday that campaign aides said was based on actual person-in-the-street interviews at a union hall in New Jersey. The campaign would not reveal where or how often the advertisement would appear. ON THE SCREEN Opens with words on a black screen: ""October, 1992."" Cuts to people in a crowd offering brief assessments of Gov. Bill Clinton. The ad makes it seem as if the viewer is actually mingling in the crowd, and a hand-held camera gives it an unpolished air of spontaneity. At one point, these words appear: ""Where will Bill Clinton get the money for his big promises?"" Ends with the printed words, apparently intended to get people to look for forthcoming spots, ""To be continued tomorrow. . ."" The campaign also released a nearly identical ad that differs only in that it shows a man who silently tests the wind with his finger. PRODUCER The November Company. TELEVISION SCRIPT Man No. 1: ""I don't believe him . . . I don't believe him one bit."" Woman No. 1: ""I don't believe him."" Woman No. 2: ""Trust."" Man No. 2: ""I don't know much about Clinton except promises."" Man No. 3: ""He tells everybody what they want to hear."" Man No. 4: ""Well, he wants to spend more money, and the only place he can get it is from the taxpayers."" Man No. 5: ""Higher taxes."" Woman No. 3: ""Less food on the table."" Man No. 5: ""Broken promises."" Woman No. 3: ""Less clothes on the kid's back."" Man No. 6: ""I don't know how we can take any more taxes."" Woman No. 3: ""Less money to go to the doctor."" Man No. 1: ""He's raised taxes in Arkansas. He'll raise taxes here."" Woman No. 3: ""Just less of everything."" SCORECARD The ad allows President Bush to go make hard-hitting, though largely unprovable, attacks but lets ""real"" people do the dirty work for him. The citizens seem more authentic in their criticism than would a narrator. The ad seeks to seize on a fear that some Republicans, including Vice President Dan Quayle in the debate Tuesday, say people have about Mr. Clinton: that he is a traditional tax and spend Democrat who cannot be trusted.",1992-10-15T05:00:00+0000

us,D'AMATO RETURNS TO THE ATTACK,"After weeks of tough television commercials attacking his rival, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato has now begun broadcasting a new ad condemning Robert Abrams, the State Attorney General, for calling him a fascist. Mr. Abrams has apologized for the remark. SCRIPT Announcer: ""Bob Abrams called Al D'Amato a fascist. It was deliberate. He used the same tactic of ethnic and religious pandering in the primary. There is no place in America for this. There is simply no excuse for Bob Abrams pandering to religious and ethnic fears and hatreds. Bob Abrams's repuation is stained and dishonored forever. It deserves to be."" PRODUCER Russo, Marsh Associates of Sacramento, Calif. ON THE SCREEN Sepia-toned news clippings of stories about Mr. Abrams's remark, with the narrator's words superimposed in white, over the sound of menacing cellos. At the end of the ad, the background fades to black and the final words appear in stark white letters, along with the small line at the bottom, ""Paid for by friends of Senator D'Amato."" SCORECARD By seizing on Mr. Abrams's comment -- which Mr. Abrams contends was the spontaneous result of being heckled by D'Amato supporters, and which he has apologized for -- Mr. D'Amato seeks to make himself a victim. But in accusing Mr. Abrams's of pandering, Mr. D'Amato is himself effectively pandering to those Italian-American and Catholic voters who were already angry at Mr. Abrams's attacks on Geraldine A. Ferraro's integrity and family finances in the Democratic primary, as well as any Jewish voters offended by Mr. Abrams's likening of Mr. D'Amato's tactics to those of the Nazi propaganda chief, Joseph Goebbels. No stranger to tough talk, Mr. D'Amato has called Mr. Abrams a ""sissy"" and a ""plastic Bobby doll,"" among other things. In this ad, Mr. D'Amato poses as greatly aggrieved, but his aides acknowledge that Mr. Abrams's remark played into the Senator's hands politically, allowing him to attack Mr. Abrams yet again, all in the name of defending his honor.",1992-10-17T05:00:00+0000

R., as he is known in the medical literature, has spent his whole life roaming the Iowa countryside, prowling for fishing holes as a boy and, as an adult, driving long country miles to visit clients. There was hardly a barn or back road he didn't know. But late in 1989, when he was 60, F. R. was stricken by a near-fatal brain infection. The disease strip-mined recollections laid down over a lifetime, leaving only the bedrock of childhood and an adult memory full of gaps.

Some feel that the farther west you travel, the deeper you delve into the real Ireland. The road from Dublin to Galway can be negotiated in three and a half hours, but for a more leisurely drive with a dozen stops along the way, a day and a half is about right. You pass through the counties of Kildare, Westmeath, Offaly and Galway, traversing in the process the Midlands, which is less spectacular in scenery than the coast but offers a fine glimpse of the island's everyday life. When you are ready to leave Dublin, you can begin your journey westward by driving out along the south quay of the Liffey. If you are leaving Dublin after a morning of sightseeing, you might want to stop at Ryan's of Parkgate Street for one of the best pub lunches in Ireland. Cross to the north bank of the Liffey in front of Heuston Station and go left on Parkgate Street to No. 28. Dating from 1896, Ryan's is a fine example of a High Victorian public house, with stained glass windows, pressed-tin walls and ceilings, old mirrors emblazoned with antique whisky advertisements, and a magnificent horseshoe-shaped bar hand-carved with Victorian Romanesque ornamentation.

He courted blur, high contrast, graininess and streaks of light, and he treated his subject matter as if it were grist for the tabloid mill. He did not give a fig for a perfect print but preserved his mistakes as if they were masterstrokes.

It occupies a few blocks by American standards, something I could walk across, if I chose not to stop, in about 15 minutes, but its emptiness is deceiving. The Potsdamer Platz has become the traffic hub of the reunified city, of what one wants to call Helmut Kohl's Berlin, as it was the hub of Kaiser Wilhelm's Berlin and of Adolf Hitler's Berlin (though Albert Speer, in his plans to remake the city, would have diminished it); it is the planned site of a huge urban development project -- of hundreds of offices and apartments, of shopping centers and theaters and hotels.

Still, the nation's top leader may be more inclined to emulate the authoritarian capitalism of Taiwan or South Korea than the democratic capitalism of the West. A1 The Communist Party replaced nearly half its leaders. A7 ISRAEL SEALS PART OF WEST BANK The Israeli Army sealed off part of the West Bank as the Government wrestled with a sudden surge of killings. Many fear a full-blown revival of the Palestinian uprising. A3 SARAJEVO LOSES PRECIOUS MILL The besieged Bosnian capital appears to have lost the use of its only flour mill in artillery attacks. It could be a serious blow to a city whose residents survive mainly on bread and pasta. A5 WRESTLING WITH THE SPIRIT A troubling question faces the Doukhobors of Canada, a pacifist sect whose forebears emigrated from Russia. A mystic once spoke of a time when they would grow rich abroad, then realize they were losing their faith -- and return home. A4 GUATEMALA'S OTHER FACE In the years since her father, mother and brother were killed by security forces and she fled Guatemala, Rigoberta Menchu's life has been a crusade to end the silence about the army's abuses. The Nobel Prize has brought her cause attention, but she fears it may not last. A5 A geyser explosion injured scores in Colombia. A5 Egypt's leader tries to soothe people left homeless by a quake. A3 The United States says it may pool intelligence work with Russia. A6 National A8-15, 18 NEW INTEREST IN VOTING Around the nation, election officials say they are swamped by voter registration forms. The trend is a sign that Americans have become invigorated by the Presidential race, and particularly by Perot's renewed candidacy. A1 FINAL PREPARATIONS As the Presidential candidates prepared for their final debate, Bush's campaign manager predicted a 'tough' Election Day victory and Clinton expressed confidence that he could handle any new attack on his character. A1 NO COATTAILS EXPECTED Republican candidates nationwide are distancing themselves from their party's Presidential ticket, to an extent not seen since 1964 and the disastrous race of Barry Goldwater. Some nominees are even criticizing Bush publicly. A10 What happens when Perot ventures into the public policy arena. A11 The candidates' stands on spending for public works. A12 The Medicaid program struggles in Clinton's own state. A12 AN INSURANCE LOOPHOLE Government investigators have documented growing networks of unregulated, offshore companies, often based in the Caribbean, that have sold hundreds of millions of dollars of insurance to Americans. A1 INQUIRY ON SPACE TELESCOPE Federal investigators say the makers of the mirror for the Hubble Space Telescope hid important clues to the flaw that has crippled the $1.5 billion instrument. A1 CRIME AND ADOLESCENCE A study has found a stunning increase in the number of boys under 18 charged in homicides, a figure that suggests the United States is on the verge of a vast new epidemic of murder. A8 WHY A FACTORY CLOSED When a clothing factory closed last year, the residents of a Tennessee town mourned the loss of 306 jobs. Now they angrily say the factory was moved to El Salvador with Federal help, a complaint that has become an issue in the Presidential race. A8 Senate races with a twist in the Northwest.

Ewen, acquired from St. Louis in 1989, got two goals in a game for the first time in his career. He scored once in the opening period and then added the game-winner on a breakaway to start Montreal's four-goal burst. Ed Ronan, Brian Bellows, Guy Carbonneau and Denis Savard also scored for Montreal, which won its second straight game. Nelson Emerson and Brendan Shanahan scored for St. Louis, which tied the game at 2-2 after two periods. Montreal, coming off an 8-1 defeat of Minnesota on Saturday, outshot the Blues, 33-27. Ronan got his first National Hockey League goal 6 minutes 9 seconds into the game when he took advantage of a mixup at the St. Louis blue line to go in alone and beat goalie Curtis Joseph on the backhand. The St. Louis defense was caught standing around when Mathieu Schneider set up Ewen alone at the side of the net for an easy tap-in almost three minutes later to make it 2-0.

The Bulls beat the Heat, 111-94, last night in an exhibition game to raise money for We Will Rebuild, a hurricane-relief organization. All revenues from the game -- ticket receipts, concessions, parking fees -- along with donations called in by fans watching the nationally televised game on TNT, will go to hurricane relief. The idea for the game came from the Bulls' Michael Jordan, who suggested it to Billy Cunningham, the former N.B.A. star who is a partner in the Heat's ownership. Seated in the approximately 740 courtside seats in the Miami Arena were children who were left homeless or whose families suffered great damage because of the hurricane.

While this evaluation was not without merit, I must agree with Mike McGrady, quoted by Fenton as having declared Kerouac ""important."" Certainly, ""On the Road"" was a faithful depiction of youthful despair over the order of things as they saw it. McGrady's praise is not to be taken lightly, coming as it does from a serious journalist (""A Dove in Vietnam"") and mastermind of the boffo sex spoof ""Naked Came the Stranger."" I would add that Capote was a bit of a poseur himself, his enormous gifts notwithstanding. His professed invention a new genre, the fictional biography (or whatever exactly he called it) with ""In Cold Blood"" was really a veiled excuse for not having to be accurate.

ON THE SCREEN: Opens with these words in white on black background: ""Before you vote, remember the record,"" in white on black background, followed by a series of black and white photographs of elderly people. Closes with ""The New Democrats. Social Security. Quality Affordable Health Care."" SCRIPT: Narrator: ""Before you vote, remember the record. Every year for the past 12 years, the Republicans tried to cut Medicare. And in nine of those years they've done it. And this year, they've proposed a plan that could lower benefits for nearly 30 million older Americans and virtually eliminate compensation for over one million disabled veterans. Medicare cuts. Health-care crisis. The worst economic record since the Great Depression. Senior citizens know better than anyone, it's time for a change. And that's what the new Democrats are fighting for. Social security and quality health care."" ACCURACY: Republicans have for 12 years said they wanted to cut the rate of growth in Medicare, but not actually reduce the benefits. There have been Republican efforts to cut payments to doctors and hospitals, though not beneficiaries. It is true that the economy has grown more slowly during Bush's Presidency than in any other four-year term since Herbert Hoover's. But the recession in the early 1980's was much more severe than the one during the Bush years.
