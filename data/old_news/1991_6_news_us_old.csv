us,Variable-Rate Lingo,"Falling interest rates mean lower monthly payments on variable-rate loans. Many lenders prefer a variable rate for mortgages, home equity loans, personal loans and charge cards. Usually the variable rate is tied to some index like the prime rate. Still, variable-rate loans are not always best. For example, if the choice is between an 11 percent variable-rate personal loan and one at a 12 percent fixed rate, the weekly Bank Rate Monitor says the fixed-rate loan is the better deal because it is only a point higher and it won't go up in the future. Here is a glossary of variable-rate loan terms, and some advice. Margin: The percentage points the lending institution adds to an index. Make comparisons among the lenders. Index: Understand how the index moves and when yours could change. Stick to loans with publicly known indexes, like the prime rate or Treasury bills. Avoid banks that set the rate at their discretion. Rate Changes: Ask how often the rate can change and when changes are effective. Some banks will time cuts in their prime rate so as to force borrowers to pay the higher rate a month longer.",1991-06-01T05:00:00+0000

No Dogs Need Apply","This slender volume should prove that though we may hire cats, they remain self-employed. In CATS AT WORK (Abbeville, $14.95) Rhonda Gray and Stephen T. Robinson present photographs of nearly 100 felines at their human owners' work places. While some of the owners claim that their resident cats volunteered for such tasks as irritating canine passers-by and improving window displays, cats have had one primary task since humans began to store grain in silos: exterminating vermin, a task whose economic value wins high praise in a commentary by the television nature reporter Roger Caras. In the rest of their decidedly few waking hours, these industrious cats, for all their attention-getting, child-distracting, elegance-lending efforts, toil at the kind of work we humans can hope for only in the hereafter. To reside in Zito's Bakery, the Gotham Book Mart, the Algonquin Hotel, the New York Shakespeare Festival or in many of the other appealing habitats photogrpahed here by Guy Powers would make most of us content for the rest of our days. In exchange for creature comforts, all a cat must do to earn its keep is to mouse, amuse and allow itself to be caressed. And herein lies cats' enviable charm, everywhere apparent in ""Cats at Work"": they go about their God-given tasks needing little from us. We have glorified their nature by calling it work.

us,Major Differences Over Civil Rights,"The House will vote, probably on Tuesday, on civil rights legislation dealing with job discrimination. Three bills will be considered: one sponsored by members of the Black Caucus, one backed by the Democratic leadership and some Republicans, and President Bush's bill. DISPARATE IMPACT Suits involving hiring or promotion practices, like tests, that are apparently fair on their face but have a ""disparate impact"" -- resulting in the hiring, for example, of proportionately more whites than blacks or more men than women -- are sometimes called ""unintentional discrimination"" cases. There are major differences on how each stage of such cases should be handled. Issue: How specific do complainants have to be in court? In the 1989 Wards Cove v. Atonio case, the Supreme Court said it would be unfair to employers to allow complainants to attack a group of practices and assert that their cumulative effect was discriminatory. Black Caucus: Complainants can demonstrate that a ""group of employment practices"" caused a discriminatory result. Democrats: Complainants must cite a specific practice, or practices, unless a court finds that despite a ""diligent effort,"" that is an impossible burden, as when, for example, an employer had not kept records. Bush: A specific practice, or practices, would have to be cited. Issue: Who has the burden of proof, the employer or the employee? In the Wards Cove case, the Supreme Court held that once complainants had shown, usually through statistics, that a ""disparate impact"" had resulted from an employment practice, the complainants still had the burden of proof of showing that the employer had no business necessity for the practice. Black Caucus: Once a ""disparate impact"" is shown, the burden of proof shifts to the employer, on the ground that the employer, not the complainant, is in the best position to know why a practice is necessary. Democrats: The same. Bush: The same. Issue: What kind of ""business necessity"" can legitimize a practice that screens out women and minorities? In Wards Cove, the Supreme Court ruled that an employment practice with apparent discriminatory effect can be justified if it ""serves, in a significant way, the legitimate employment goals of the employer."" It need not be either ""essential"" or ""indispensable."" The Wards Cove definition is easier for employers to meet than the definition set in the 1971 Griggs v. Duke Power Co. Under Griggs, employers had to show that the practice had a ""manifest relationship to the employment in question,"" focusing more narrowly on the job at issue rather than the employers' overall business concerns. Democrats say a loose definition would encourage discrimination; the White House contends that a definition that makes business necessity difficult to prove would lead employers to use quotas rather than risk losing lawsuits. Black Caucus: Employers would have to prove that a challenged practice ""bears a substantial and demonstrable relationship to effective job performance."" Democrats: Employers must prove that the practice has a ""significant and manifest relationship to the requirements for effective job performance."" Those requirements include not only ""effective performance of the actual work activities"" but also ""factors which bear on such performance, such as attendance, punctuality and not engaging in misconduct or insubordination."" Bush: Employers would have their choice of proving either ""legitimate employment goals,"" as in Wards Cove case or the ""manifest relationship"" rule from Griggs. ""QUOTAS"" Issue: The use of numerical quotas in hiring or promotion is generally prohibited. Affirmative actions plans that involve less specific goals and timetables and require employers to make greater efforts to hire and promote women and minorities are generally acceptable. Precise quotas are sometimes acceptable if they are imposed by court order against an employer found to have consistently discriminated in the past. The White House says that the way the Democrats would outlaw quotas would really encourage their use because the Democrats define quotas in a narrow way. Black Caucus: No provision. Democrats: Bill states that it does not ""require or encourage or permit"" quotas. It also makes their use an ""illegal employment practice"" under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Someone denied hiring or promotion because of a quota could sue to get the job and seek damages too. Quotas are defined as the setting of ""a fixed number or percentage of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex or national origin which must be attained, or which cannot be exceeded, regardless of whether such persons meet necessary qualifications to perform the job."" Bush: No direct reference to quotas. DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT Issue: In the 1989 Patterson v. McLean Credit Union case, the Supreme Court held that the right to sue for damages for racial job discrimination under an 1866 law did not apply to on-the-job harassment or other forms of discrimination after someone was hired. Since then, lower courts have disagreed as to whether the law applies to dismissals, promotions and other practices. Black Caucus: The Patterson decision would be rejected absolutely, and the Reconstruction-era law would be clearly defined as applying to hirings, promotions, dismissals and all other terms of employment. Democrats: The same. In addition, this proposal makes clear that the provision applies to nongovernmental discrimination as well as discrimination based on state law. Bush: Identical with Democratic version. Issue: Victims of intentional discrimination or harassment based on sex, religion, national origin or disability are protected under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, not the 1866 law. All a judge can order is back pay and employment or reinstatement on a job if it was lost. Compensatory and punitive damages are not permitted, and women argue that their claims under this act therefore have less weight Black Caucus: Amend the 1866 law so that it also covers sex discrimination. Amend the 1964 law to allow compensatory and punitive damages. Either side could request trial by jury. Democrats: Amend the 1964 law to permit suits for compensatory and punitive damages and back pay. Punitive damages would be limited to $150,000, or the total of back pay and compensatory damages, whichever is higher. Because that would still be less than victims of racial discrimination can seek under the 1866 law, the provision has been attacked as unfair, to women in particular. If either side asked, the case would be tried before a jury. Bush: Damages would be allowed only in harassment cases, including sexual harassment, and no more than $150,000 in damages would be allowed. But a victim could not sue if he or she had failed to use in-house grievance procedures. The case would be tried before a judge without a jury. Victims of other sorts of intentional discrimination would still be entitled only to back pay and employment or reinstatement. REOPENING OLD DISCRIMINATION CASES Issue: In the 1989 Martin v. Wilks case, the Supreme Court ruled that since some white firefighters in Birmingham, Ala., had not been parties to two earlier suits challenging discrimination in the city's fire department, they had a right to go into court later to attack hiring and promotion policies established by consent decrees that settled the suits. Black Caucus: People could not sue to reopen employment cases if they had ""actual notice"" of the decree at the time it was entered and a ""reasonable opportunity"" to object. Nor could they sue if their interests ""were adequately represented"" in the original case. Challenges would also not be allowed ""if reasonable efforts were made to provide notice to interested persons."" Democrats: The same. Bush: Endorses the Martin v. Wilks decision; would write it into a statute. ADJUSTMENTS OF EMPLOYMENT TESTS Issue: In a practice called ""race norming,"" the Labor Department has urged state employment services to score the results of a widely used aptitude test separately for white, blacks and people of Hispanic descent. Under this practice, in effect since the beginning of the Reagan Administration, some blacks with low raw scores of correct answers are rated higher than some whites with more correct answers. Black Caucus: No provision. Democrats: Prohibit both ""race norming"" and the use of biased employment tests that fail to predict job performance equally well, regardless of race, religion, sex or national origin. Bush: Would prohibit ""race norming.""",1991-06-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Headliners; The Bucks Stopped,"When Marion C. Moran was sworn in as the first female Mayor of Bridgeport, Conn., she was a self-described housewife and real-estate broker who had won as a Republican in a Democratic stronghold. Her fief, a once-bustling urban center of 142,000 and the largest city in Connecticut, had long ago fallen on hard times, and her austerity platform promised to reduce city services -- except for police and fire -- and raise taxes only in an emergency like bankruptcy. Last week, after city officials failed to close a $12 million gap in the $304 million budget for fiscal 1991-1992, the Mayor filed for bankruptcy, saying she couldn't balance the budget without dismissing up to 100 officers from the 340-member police force. Mrs. Moran was seeking to circumvent the grip of the state's financial review board and place Bridgeport in the control of a Federal judge. But the board promptly vowed to block the Mayor's plan and imposed a budget balanced by an 18 percent increase in property taxes.",1991-06-09T05:00:00+0000

us,The Joy of Flies,"This is an elegant, enthralling book of pictures by Peter Gathercole of trout, tackle and fishermen. A compelling sequence of underwater photographs of trout rising to the fly graces the introductions to several chapters of THE CLASSIC GUIDE TO FLY-FISHING FOR TROUT: The Fly-Fisher's Book of Quarry, Tackle and Techniques (Random House, $35) and every one of the first 241 pages has the kind of illustration that ought to make non-anglers envy what they are missing. That is fortunate, because Charles Jardine's prose seems unlikely to hook the beginner whom the book is cast toward. ""To catch a trout on an artificial fly is arguably the highest form of fishing"" splats on the page like a cast sloppy enough to spook a very dumb trout. The book seems to be organized as a primer, with diagrams showing how to cast, several pages showing current rods and reels, knot-tying diagrams and a full 78 pages of plates of fly patterns, followed by precise instructions as to what materials to use to tie each of them. But in fact the teaching chapters are too short for beginners, too simple for experienced anglers and a little too British for either. But the pictures! Along with the fish themselves, there are anglers on English chalk streams, steelhead rivers of the American West, fishermen playing trout, fishermen releasing trout. Rich illustrations define the various kinds of trout and quasi trout (chars, especially) anglers seek, and the methods they use. When asked for an introduction to the feeling and meaning of fly fishing, I always recommend Norman Maclean's ""A River Runs Through It."" But for a sense of what it looks like, this volume would make a handsome companion.",1991-06-09T05:00:00+0000

Breland, who weighed 157 pounds, shut out Anaya, winning by 100-90 on the scorecards of all three judges, Frank Brunette, John Riley and Vin Rainone. Breland was the aggressor throughout the fight. In the early rounds, Breland hit Anaya with jabs and uppercuts. Occasionally, Anaya threw a wild right, but mostly he stood in front of Breland, absorbing punches. By the fifth round, Anaya was able to narrow the distance to Breland. At close range, he continued to take punches, but he also began landing hooks to Breland's body. Breland's inability to damage Anaya brought boos from the crowd in the sixth round. Over the final rounds, Breland methodically pummeled Anaya. At one point in the eighth, Anaya threw Breland off him, bouncing him into the referee, Raphael Ramos. Ramos warned Anaya for the tactic. With the victory, Breland's record goes to 29-2-1 with 21 knockouts. Anaya is 17-4 with 11 knockouts.

us,Three Artists So Alike and So Different,"When Rudolf Serkin and Wilhelm Kempff died last month, both were identified in obituaries as exemplary products of the Austro-Germanic school of pianism. That was an accurate description, too, of Claudio Arrau, whose death last week at age 88 further thinned the ranks of pianistic elder statesmen. A casual listener to the recordings of all three, however, might be hard pressed to discern many similarities in their approaches to music-making. Where Serkin seemed to hurl himself at a Beethoven sonata with a heady abandon that dramatized the composer's own heroic vision of himself, Kempff characteristically adopted a calmer, more regular style that could frustrate critics who insisted on a more overtly Romantic approach to Beethoven. Arrau, born in Chile but schooled in Berlin, played a wide range of 19th-century music with great virtuosity and insight but also with a well-tailored refinement that prompted critics early in his career to characterize his style as ""aristocratic,"" a somwhwat misleading label that stuck with him.",1991-06-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Unfamiliar Lincolns,"A Scottish writer and editor who became captivated by the new art of photography, Alexander Gardner joined the successful Washington studio of Mathew Brady shortly before the Civil War. When hostilities broke out in 1861, Gardner conceived the idea of producing a consecutive photographic history of the conflict; for two years, under the Brady aegis, Gardner and a corps of photographers sent back to Washington a stream of powerful images of the war. WITNESS TO AN ERA. The Life and Photographs of Alexander Gardner: The Civil War, Lincoln, and the West (Viking, $60) by D. Mark Katz is well researched, resting comfortably on the pioneering work of other historians, and it is exquisitely presented. Mr. Katz, the author of ""Custer in Photographs,"" tracked down original Gardner prints, presented here in their somber sepia-toned glory -- the grimly littered battlefields (sometimes slightly ornamented, we are informed, by a photographer's prop rifle or even rearranged for composition's sake) as well as portraits of most of the North's celebrated personalities. Those of Abraham Lincoln, some famous but others startling in their unfamiliarity, are possibly the best. The author follows Gardner's career as he moonlights as a Union spy and, after the war, as he covers the manhunt and execution of the Lincoln assassination conspirators, the war-crimes trial and execution of Henry Wirz, the commander of the Andersonville prison camp, and the burgeoning westward movement spurred by the Union Pacific Railroad.

Fishing","This is the longest day of the year, on the Illinois River or a similarriver in the same place. Cicadas are part of the song as they praise theirinvisible ancestors while fish blinking back the relentless sun in Oklahomacircle in the muggy river of life. They dare the fisher to come and get them.Fish too anticipate the game of fishing. Their ancestors perfected the moves,sent down stories that appear as electrical impulse when sunlight hits water.The hook carries great symbology in the coming of age, and is crucial tothe making of warriors. The greatest warriors are those who dangle ahuman for hours on a string, break sacred water for the profanity of airthen snap fiercely back into pearly molecules that describe fishness. Theysmell me as I walk the banks with fishing pole, nightcrawlers and apromise I made to that old friend Louis to fish with him this summer. Thisis the only place I can keep that promise, inside a poem as familiar to himas the banks of his favorite fishing place. I try not to let the fish see mesee them as they look for his tracks on the soft earth made of fossils andashes. I hear the burble of fish talk: When is that old Creek coming back? Hewas the one we loved to tease most, we liked his songs and once in awhilehe gave us a good run. Last night I dreamed I tried to die, I was going tolook for Louis. It was rather comical. I worked hard to muster my lastbreath, then lay down in the summer, along the banks of the last mythicriver, my pole and tackle box next to me. What I thought was my lastbreath floated off as a cloud making an umbrella of grief over my relatives.How embarrassing when the next breath came, and then the next. I reeledin one after another, as if I'd caught a bucket of suckers instead of bass. Iguess it wasn't my time, I explained, and went fishing anyway as a liarand I know most fishers to be liars most of the time. Even Louis when itcame to fishing, or even dying. The leap between the sacred and profane isas thin as a fishing line, and is part of the mystery on this river of life, asis the way our people continue to make warriors in the strangest of times. Isave this part of the poem for the fish camp next to the oldest spirits whosedogs bark to greet visitors. It's near Louis's favorite spot where the wisestand fattest fish laze.

us,Danse Macabre,"VASLAV NIJINSKY: A Leap Into Madness. By Peter Ostwald. (Lyle Stuart/Carol Publishing, $19.95.) Vaslav Nijinsky, the British critic and historian of ballet Richard Buckle wrote, was ""ten years growing, ten years learning, ten years dancing, and thirty years in eclipse."" Those last gray years aroused the curiosity of Peter Ostwald, a psychiatrist, and prompted this curious biography. Dr. Ostwald re-examines the progress of Nijinksy's life with an eye for the roots of the mental deterioration that began around 1914. Primed by the author's theories and mini-lectures on early 20th-century medical practice, we can reject a doctor's diagnosis of neurasthenia on the occasion of the dancer's first breakdown in 1914 and consider it a ""panic disorder"" brought on by stress and Nijinsky's rejection by the Ballets Russes entrepreneur Serge Diaghilev, his lover and father figure. Dr. Ostwald misses no opportunity to ferret out early signs of madness. Jean Cocteau observes Nijinsky at a dinner party twisting his head alarmingly. He is practicing for his ""Afternoon of a Faun,"" says Nijinsky. Cocteau is reassured. But not Dr. Ostwald, who speaks darkly of how ""certain of Nijinsky's dance movements were intuitively perceived as pathological."" He has done groundbreaking research on the period between 1919 and Nijinsky's death from uremia and chronic nephritis on April 8, 1950. His professional status has allowed him access to hospital records, medical archives and interviews with descendants of doctors who treated Nijinsky. The hair-raising chronicle of ordeals disputes much of what Nijinsky's widow Romola has published. Nijinsky's malady was diagnosed (misdiagnosed, says Dr. Ostwald) as schizophrenia, and also as catatonia, depression, mania. He was dosed with various powerful drugs to calm him, some of which may have heightened his depression; he was given 228 insulin shock treatments. His wife dragged him to the best doctors. She removed him from hospitals or sanitariums, insisting he was well, only to have him readmitted when she couldn't cope. The picture given by doctors' reports and nurses' diaries is consistent only in its pathos: the once great dancer and choreographer became an object -- now reported as calm and charming, now as raging, now inert, now infantile. Plowing through the details of his physical ailments and his behavior, one sometimes thinks: Dance history needs this book, but do I have to read it?",1991-06-23T05:00:00+0000

His pictures of the velvet or muslin folds of curtains, of the curvaceous lines of brass door handles and wrought-iron works, as well as his portraits of women -- their bodies framed by the cut of a garment or the tension of a belt, their faces peaceful or meditative -- all bespeak a sensuality shared by the American photographer and his adopted country. Through his photos of a measuring tape around a tailor's shoulders, a solitary easel, the shiny neck of a bottle of red wine, the profile of a chef in his toque blanche, and a lapel bearing the thin red ribbon of the Legion d'Honneur, Mr. Gibson pays a discreet compliment to France's veneration of precision, craftsmanship and status. Alternately lush and restrained, cryptic and obvious, this seductive collection of photographs tells the story of how France mesmerized Ralph Gibson.",1991-06-23T05:00:00+0000

The soft-spoken politician brought a new style to Japanese voters accustomed to gruff deal-cutters. ""No one in postwar politics has brought politics so successfully into people's living rooms,"" a colleague said recently. Three years after Ms. Doi took over the chronically out-of-power party in 1986, the Socialists had their best electoral showing ever, doubling their seats in the upper house of Parliament and breaking the Liberal Democrats' dominance. But the Socialists were unable to match those gains in lower house elections last year -- and therefore unable to fulfill some promises to their new supporters -- and took a beating in local elections two months ago. Ms. Doi took the blame. Announcing her resignation as leader of the Socialists last week, she said, ""I decided right after the elections that I must step down.""",1991-06-23T05:00:00+0000

For Mr. Codrescu, poetry is ambush, an outsider's weapon for upsetting ""order / and the authority spent /establishing it."" His baleful pronouncements -- on such subjects as television, bureaucracy and ""the failure of internationalism"" -- deliberately provoke. To post-modernists, he would play the reactionary, a man in search of an absolute, bored by the forest of mirrors and signs: ""How do I get outside? / The world's been shrinking too much as it is. / . . . The soul wants to get out of the rain / like any pitiful bourgeois."" To reactionaries, he'd play the radical, denying any link between words and the world: ""The power now controlling / the traffic between / reality and symbols / is journalism. /. . . Some of us stand / in the middle of the traffic / screaming: THERE IS NO BRIDGE!"" This is poetry from a self-professed ""organic anarchist,"" verse that, at its wittiest, reads the way Nie tzsche might have sounded, had he played off of the 15-second commercial: ""Morality,"" he pronounces sadly, has become ""the science of indoor living.""",1991-06-30T05:00:00+0000

Germany's major assault began on Sept. 7 when nearly 1,000 airplanes, one-third of them bombers, making up a formation one and a half miles high covering 800 square miles, appeared over the skies of England. For 76 days wave after wave of bombers destroyed the city's docks and warehouses, office buildings, shops and homes.
