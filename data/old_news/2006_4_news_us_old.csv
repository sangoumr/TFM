Last week, US Helicopter (www.flyush.com) started a new shuttle service between the Downtown Manhattan Heliport at Wall Street and Terminal 9 (American Airlines) at the airport. Tickets for the eight-minute ride initially cost $129 each way, not including taxes and fees. Passengers traveling on American can check in at the heliport. Others must take the AirTrain to other terminals for check-in. The State Department recently issued a public announcement to alert Americans to security concerns in Italy. Demonstrations are planned in various parts of the country in anticipation of parliamentary elections April 9 and 10 and municipal elections in May, the alert said. Mesa Air Group touched off an air fare war in Hawaii last month when it began offering interisland fares as low as $39 at www.iflygo.com to introduce its new Go! airline, which will begin flying between Honolulu and Lihue, Kahului, Hilo and Kona on June 9.

He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from public high school. He was an infantryman in the U.S. Army during World War II and a combat veteran of the Battle of the Ruhr and other action in the European Theater of Operations. Dr Alberts took his Bachelor's, Master's and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago, where he studied under Milton Friedman, Abba Lerner and Frank Knight. He taught Business Economics and Finance at the University of Washington Graduate School of Business from 1967 to 1995. He was known for his rigorous academic standards and his excellence in teaching. In 1978, Dr. Alberts co-founded Marakon Associates, the international management consulting firm described by ""The Economist"" as ""a consultancy that has advised some of the world's most consistently successful companies."" Marakon now has offices in New York, London, Singapore, Chicago and San Francisco. Dr. Alberts was a driving force in developing the firm's strategy and organizational practice and training the consulting staff. He worked parttime for Marakon while he was on the University of Washington faculty, and fulltime after he retired from teaching, remaining active in the firm until his death. An associate remembers Dr. ""Bill"" (as he was affectionately known) as a ""teacher and colleague who enabled people to achieve a level of excellence far above what they thought themselves capable of achieving."" Another recalls ""He was a person who always left you better than you were."" He will be sadly and deeply missed by Patricia, his wife of 54 years, his daughters, Mary Allender of Portland, Oregon, Susan Alberts of Durham, North Carolina, five grandchildren, and his many friends, co-workers and associates.

That she was an alcoholic, an expatriate and essentially an orphan  none of this matters.

It was through Bill's unselfish devotion, tireless energy, and dogged determination over a 40 year period that the Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House originally built in 1652, was saved from destruction and designated as New York City's first landmark in1965 and restored and opened to the public in 1982 as a museum dedicated to the City's early Dutch history. 20 years later, Bill was instrumental in the Museum's redevelopment as the Wyckoff Farmhouse Museum and Education Center. Bill served as the Association's First Vice-President from 1957 to 1967 and then as President from 1967 to 1972. From that point, he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee until 1989. Bill was the eighth great-grandson of Pieter Claesen Wyckoff, who arrived in New Amsterdam on March 4, 1637. E.

He attended public schools in New York and also attended the Admiral Billard Academy in Groton, CT. Bob had his college studies interrupted by World War II. He served in the Navy twice, from 1942-1943, and again from 1945-1946, as a Seaman 1st class. He returned to Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, and graduated as part of the class of 1945 with an AB in Mathematics. At Bowdoin, he was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity and continued to be very active with Bowdoin as a class agent, class secretary and pre-admissions interviewer. In 1948, after graduating from Bowdoin, Bob began his career with General Electric in the then small products division. He married Betty Jane Callan on June 24, 1950. In 1958, he joined Martindale-Hubbell, publishers of a legal law directory and worked in increasing responsible positions until his retirement as Vice President in 1988. Longtime residents of Chatham, New Jersey, Bob and his wife, Betty retired to Fearrington Village, Pittsboro, North Carolina, in 1990. Bob served as the President of the Homeowners Association in Fearrington in the early 90's. Bob's love of music was a constant theme throughout his life. He was an active member of the Glee Club at Bowdoin. During his retirement years, he enjoyed singing with the Harmony Grits and the Mini Grits, volunteer singing groups in Fearrington Village. His ready smile, wit and love of life will be sorely missed by his family and many friends.

To the extent that she injected her own brand of American exuberance into the calcified English conventions that governed dcor and entertaining, Lancaster was viewed as a reformer.

Close on the dancers' heels and fastened into a real red car with fake seat belts came the Wiggles in the flesh: four Australians otherwise known as Murray Cook, Anthony Field, Jeff Fatt and Greg Page. All wore single-color jerseys with stripe-legged pants and logo-emblazoned belt buckles. ""Toot, toot, chugga, chugga, big red car,"" Page sang in a smooth baritone. ""We'll travel near, and we'll travel far. Toot, toot, chugga, chugga, big red car. We're going to ride the whole day long."" The song bounced atop an infectious eight-bar pop, and the audience quickly became a roiling sea of 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds, some dressed as their favorite Wiggle and others clutching some colorful piece of Wiggles-sanctioned toyage purchased deep within the crush that earlier swarmed the merchandise tables out front.

This week, Garry Wills's new book, ""What Jesus Meant,"" enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 12 and ""The Journey,"" by Billy Graham, climbs onto the extended list at No. 22. This season's subversive best seller, however, is one that takes direct aim at the Bible: Bart D. Ehrman's ""Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why"" (HarperSanFrancisco). It rises on the nonfiction list to No. 5. Ehrman, who heads the department of religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, methodically chips away at the underpinnings of some of the Bible's best-known passages. (One example: Ehrman writes that the story of Jesus and the woman accused of adultery -- the one where Jesus supposedly said, ""Let the one who is without sin among you cast the first stone"" -- wasn't part of the Gospels, but was added later by unreliable scribes.) Much of Ehrman's research isn't groundbreaking. ""This material has been known to scholars,"" he told me in a telephone interview, ""but there hasn't been a book for the lay audience."" The author, who is 50 and has written 18 previous books, grew up in a not overly religious Episcopal family, but became a fundamentalist while still a teenager and attended college at the Moody Bible Institute. His probing into the composition of the Bible ultimately led him to lose his faith. ""Misquoting Jesus"" makes for sober Easter reading. The problem with divining the meanings of the New Testament, he writes, is that we not only don't have the originals, ""we don't even have copies of the copies of the originals."" Ehrman notes: ""It would have been no more difficult for God to preserve the words of Scripture than it would have been for him to inspire them in the first place. . . . The fact that we don't have the words surely must show, I reasoned, that he did not preserve them for us. And if he didn't perform that miracle, there seemed to be no reason to think that he performed the earlier miracle of inspiring those words.""",2006-04-02T05:00:00+0000

When, as a young art enthusiast with not a lot of money but infinite taste, she discovered six Norman Cherner chairs for $25 each in the early 1980's, she knew she had to have them. She credits Dewey Dufresne (a restaurateur, a former design scavenger and the father of the New York chef Wylie) with tipping her off. ""I've always been really proud of these chairs,"" says Rubell, who has since acquired 12 more. ""They're not gold-plated, the materials are not precious, but the invention is innovative."" Cherner's 1958 design combines a molded plywood seat and back with curved bentwood arms that generously wrap around to the slender legs. As Rubell describes it, the design is ""fragile yet strong, and extremely biomorphic."" Even Philippe Starck could not resist the chairs' simple allure: he designed a matching dining table for the Rubells, who have, over the years, gathered art stars around it, like Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, each perched on one of Cherner's chairs. ""We've had a lifetime of people sitting on these for hours on end, and we've never had a broken one,"" Rubell says.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   MICHAEL, SIDNEY","MICHAEL--Sidney, 85 years old, passed away on Saturday, April 1, 2006, from injuries sustained in a fall on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Sid, a lifelong resident of New York, was the owner of Capitol Distributors Corporation and a former board member of the City Athletic Club. A veteran of World War II, Sid served in the Army artillery, taking part in the Battle of the Bulge, avoiding capture by leading a group of men off the road and into the hills after discerning that the road signs had been reversed by German infiltrators. Sid later joined up with Airborne troops who had liberated Bastogne and, later still, rejoined the artillery units that marched into Germany. A gentle giant of a man, Sid was a superb athlete, avid sportsman, and was once asked to audition for the role of Tarzan, later given to Johnny Weissmuller. As a young man he was an expert rider and starred on the track and field team at DeWitt Clinton High School. Later in life loved deep sea fishing, golf and tennis. Sid loved taking adventuresome trips to places such as the Amazon, China, Africa, the Galapagos, New Zealand, etc. When a family member was not available to accompany him, Sid thought nothing of striking out on an adventure on his own, frequently telling his children that they should live with memories, not regrets. Family was the most important thing in Sid's life. He is survived by his wife of fifty three years, the former Lea Wynperle, as well as his two children, Lawrence Michaels and Leslie Michael Tabet, and their spouses Kathryn Flynn Michaels and Christian Antoine Tabet. In addition, he is survived by his adoring grandchildren Serena Michaels, Sarah-Rose Tabet and Max Tabet. Their loss is profound. Sid is also survived by his sisters, Miriam Schoeneman and Frances Randall, their children and grandchildren, as well as the family of his late brother, Melvin Michaels, with whom he worked in partnership for nearly fifty years. In addition, he is survived by his brotherin-law Bernard Wynperle, his wife Ann, and his mother-inlaw Sara Wynperle, as well as numerous friends and associates. The family also wishes to acknowledge the longtime devotion of the Michael's housekeeper Gloria Ortiz. All our hearts are broken by this unexpected tragedy. Services will be held at 12:45, Tuesday, April 4th, at The Riverside, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. The family is requesting that any donations be made in Sid's name to his longtime friend, Dr. Edgar Housepian at the Neurological Institute, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032.",2006-04-03T05:00:00+0000

If estimates hold, it will narrowly take the slot for the second-best opening weekend ever for an animated film. The sequel to the 2002 ""Ice Age,"" the film, whose characters include Scrat (right), took in $70.5 million, according to Exhibitor Relations, a box office tracking company. That was $24 million more than the original ""Ice Age"" grossed in its first weekend, and about $33,000 more than ""The Incredibles"" had for its opening in November 2004. (""Shrek 2,"" also from 2004, has a comfortable lead for the best debut for an animated picture, with $108 million.) It is a long drop to second-biggest movie this weekend, Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" (Universal). That film took in $15.7 million in its second week, for total sales of $52.8 million. ""ATL"" (Warner Brothers), starring the rappers T. I. and Big Boi, opened at No. 3 with $12.5 million.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   KARAKASH, JOHN J.","KARAKASH--John J., 1914-2006. Educator, humanitarian and athlete, died Wednesday, March 22. Distinguished Professor and Dean Emeritus of Engineering at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, he was also internationally recognized for focusing attention on citizenship, foreign affairs and ethics in public policy. Many recent Editorial Page contributions on these issues were published in the Allentown based Morning Call. Born in Turkey June 14, 1914 of Greek parents, he entered the U.S. with an athletic scholarship after winning the 1935 Balkan nations' Olympic Games javelin event. He earned a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Duke in 1937, and entered the University of Pennsylvania as a Moore Fellow, completing a Master of Science degree in 1938. He taught briefly at Park College outside Kansas City and served as Education Director at American Television Laboratories in Chicago. He helped improve and train military staff in the use of defense equipment including radar, later joining the team developing ENIAC, recognized as the first electronic computer. He also collaborated with Hanemann Medical College scientists in the study of mechanical hearts. Professor Karakash joined the Lehigh faculty in 1946, was named Head of the Electrical Engineering department in 1956 and ten years later became Dean of the College of Engineering, a position he held until retirement in 1981. He received many University awards including an Honorary Doctorate in 1971 and the naming of a rebuilt wing of Parkard Laboratory in his honor in 1981. A quotation on the dedication plaque expresses his way of life: ""...our goal is to produce good people-young men and women who learn to think to the point where thinking is a habit, who have been exposed to and encouraged to develop and live by a set of values, who have developed methods and approaches to the intelligent application of knowledge and, last but not least, who accept the virtue of work as a vehicle of service and the will to work as a self-discipline."" He was active in professional and honorary societies, served on advisory boards, was a member of the Professional Accrediting Society for Engineering Colleges and consulted for major corporations. His listing in Who's Who in America ends with this quote: ""In free societies, whenever rules and regulations, because of changing times, are in conflict with principles, it is the principles that need be conserved, and the conflicting rules and regulations summarily discarded."" He was predeceased by the late Marjorie Rutherford Karakash, his wife of fifty years; a brother, Theodore and sister, Nina Karakash Papadopoulos. Surviving are a son, John of Lewisburg, PA, sister-in-law Roxanne, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and two great - granddaughters. He resided at Kirkland Village, Bethlehem, PA in recent years. A memorial service will be held Monday, April 10 at 4:10pm in Packer Chapel on the Lehigh University Campus. In lieu of flowers, contributions are suggested to the donor's choice of The Salvation Army, PO Box 269, Alexandria, VA 22313; the Northampton County ASPCA, 1165 Island Park Road, Easton, PA 18042; or the Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation, 1600 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314.",2006-04-04T05:00:00+0000

Borders will sell accessories and prepaid cards to use when downloading the books from Sony's Web site (connect.com). Several thousand titles will be available for the Reader, right. In a separate deal, a consortium of nonprofit publishers, booksellers and a print-on-demand publisher announced that it was starting a project called Caravan, scheduled for spring 2007, to make 24 forthcoming titles simultaneously available in hardcover, paperback, print-on-demand, digital and audio formats. The idea is that no buyer should ever go into a bookstore and be turned away because the book is out of stock, said Peter Osnos, publisher of PublicAffairs and executive director of Caravan.

The settlement, whose terms were not disclosed, resolved a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by Ms. Shin's parents. The lawsuit charged that two members of the university's staff, a university librarian who was a faculty mentor or ""house master"" in Ms. Shin's dormitory and an associate dean, did not provide adequate care for their daughter and failed to notify her family of her psychiatric problems. Ms. Shin's family also agreed to drop a separate lawsuit against four M.I.T. psychiatrists; a lawsuit against M.I.T. itself was dismissed last year. JONATHAN D. GLATER (NYT)",2006-04-04T05:00:00+0000

But they hastily withdrew them yesterday when American Airlines failed to join in. ""American would just not go along with the $50,"" said Terry Trippler, who is an analyst at Cheapseats.com. By early last night, all of the major airlines except the recently merged US Airways/America West Airlines had said ""Never mind"" and backed away. On the other hand, major airlines raised fares $2 to $5 each way on their lowest-priced tickets, commonly referred to as leisure fares. ""That seems to be holding,"" Mr. Trippler said. And on Friday, Delta Air Lines began passing on to customers ""airport passenger facility fees,"" user charges that many airports assess airlines. As of yesterday, United Airlines had joined Delta in passing on the airport fees, which airlines have traditionally absorbed and which can range up to $18 for a round trip, Mr. Trippler said.

Judge Joan A. Lenard found that the colonel, Juan Lpez Grijalba, served as chief of an intelligence unit known as Battalion 3-16, which received money and training from the United States. The unit, organized as part of the Reagan administration's effort to stop the spread of Communism in Central America, was responsible for systematic abuses against civilians suspected as subversives. Mr. Lpez Grijalba moved to Miami in 1998 but was deported in 2004. He has not faced criminal prosecution. Among the plaintiffs in the Florida suit, filed by the Center for Justice and Accountability, a human rights organization, were scar Reyes, a journalist, and his wife, Gloria, who were tortured, held for nearly five months and then forced into exile in the United States.

us,"Arts, Briefly; Mixup in Beatles Mixes","The first run of ""The Capitol Albums, Vol. 2,"" the collection of the Beatles' American albums to be released on Tuesday, uses incorrect mixes on two of the four discs. The error, spotted by collectors who received advance copies, was acknowledged by Capitol Records yesterday. The company said consumers would be able to exchange the mispressed discs for corrected versions. Like the first volume, the set includes four albums as they were released in the United States in the 1960's, in formats that differed notably from their British counterparts. Each disc -- in this case, ""The Early Beatles,"" ""Beatles VI,"" ""Help!"" and ""Rubber Soul"" -- was meant to include both the stereo and mono mixes, which in many cases are noticeably different. For ""The Early Beatles"" and ""Help!"" Capitol's engineers in the 1960's chose to assemble a stereo master, and to fold down (or reduce) the stereo mixes to mono for the mono releases, instead of using the British mono mixes. But the mono tracks on the original LP releases of ""Beatles VI"" and ""Rubber Soul"" are distinct mixes. On the ""Vol. 2"" CD's, Capitol used reduced mono mixes on all four albums. The company attributed the error to a mastering house, which apparently sent the incorrect mixes to Capitol's pressing plant. The mistake is most easily spotted on ""Rubber Soul."" The stereo version of the song ""I'm Looking Through You"" includes a false start that did not appear on the mono version. On the mispressed CD's, the mono ""I'm Looking Through You"" has the false start. ALLAN KOZINN",2006-04-06T05:00:00+0000

And every season, there is a country music theme night that flummoxes him. This year, it was Tuesday night, and Mr. Cowell seemed as if he were being tortured before the show's estimated 28 million viewers. After that on Fox, the medical drama ""House"" drew its best ratings ever, with an audience of 22.63 million. It drew more viewers in its second half-hour than it did in its first, a ratings feat no hourlong series following ""Idol"" has ever accomplished. Needless to say, Fox made mincemeat of its network competition. Among the carnage was the debut of the WB's ""Pepper Dennis"" (2.92 million), which lost a significant portion of the ""Gilmore Girls"" audience (4.29 million). At 10 p.m., NBC's ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" delivered 14.81 million viewers and easily won the hour. The episode ended with Olivia, played by the maternity-leave-bound Mariska Hargitay, asking for a new partner to get away from her intense relationship with Elliot (Christopher Meloni).

us,The Listings: April 7 - April 13; CHICK COREA: FOREVER RETURNS,"Before its spangled reign as one of the better bombastic fusion bands, Return to Forever was a sprightly chamber-jazz outfit inspired especially by the music of Brazil. The group originated in 1971 as an outgrowth of the keyboardist Chick Corea's work with the tenor saxophonist Stan Getz; its first iteration included Mr. Corea and two other Getz sidemen, the bassist Stanley Clarke and the percussionist Airto Moreira. By the time it disbanded at the close of 1977, Return to Forever had etched a place in popular culture, complete with arena tours and Top 40 albums (one of which, ""Romantic Warrior"" on Columbia, would eventually be certified gold). Moving away from the band, Mr. Corea, above, briefly reconnected with its fluttering early sound; in 1978 he recorded a pair of solo albums with the former Return to Forever members Joe Farrell (reeds) and Steve Gadd (drums) and a sharp new bassist, Eddie Gomez. An array of projects have preoccupied Mr. Corea in the years since -- for a crash course, splurge on ""Rendezvous in New York"" (Image Entertainment), which chronicles a reunion-heavy 2001 Blue Note residency on 10 DVD's -- but Return to Forever has rarely re-entered the picture. That's changing now, somewhat: Mr. Corea's most recent album, ""The Ultimate Adventure"" (Stretch), pointedly evokes his early-70's sound. And next week at the Blue Note, he introduces something called Forever Returns, with Mr. Moreira and Mr. Gomez. The absence of Mr. Clarke undercuts the premise a bit, but the music should soar nonetheless.

But for some fans, there is another option -- and it can be found in, of all places, Park Slope, Brooklyn, less known for its Broadway babies than for the regular kind. The Gallery Players, located on 14th Street for the last 16 years, have developed a reputation for reviving commercial hits whose original productions still vividly linger in memories. Among the offerings over the past few years have been ""The Full Monty"" (closed on Broadway September 2002), ""Side Show"" (closed on Broadway January 1998) and ""The Fantasticks,"" a show that only four years ago finished its downtown run of more than 41 years, enough time, you would think, to exhaust its demand for at least a generation. But part of the fun of these quickie revivals is the comparisons. The broadly comic current version of ""Take Me Out"" (closed 2004), above, for example, is a solidly entertaining production with actors who look a few sizes too small to be major leaguers. ""I thought I would never want to see anyone but Denis O'Hare,"" said the man sitting next to me, referring to the actor who won a Tony Award for his role as the accountant who falls in love with the game. But here he was, chuckling at Scott McGowan's version of the same character, which hinted at the original (he also hugged himself nervously) but pursued laughs more shamelessly. (Though April 16, ""Take Me Out"" is playing at the Gallery Players, 199 14th Street, between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, Park Slope, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $15; students and 62+, $12.)",2006-04-07T05:00:00+0000

The legislation was passed after shelters in Portland and around the state reported an increase in violence against the homeless. Mark Swann, director of the Preble Street Community Center and soup kitchen in Portland, said much of the violence was perpetrated by young people intent on harming the homeless for thrills. Much of it is never reported, something Mr. Swann hopes this law will change. KATIE ZEZIMA (NYT)",2006-04-07T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: April 7 - April 13; KAREN AKERS,"Ms. Akers admits that the pairing did not at first seem auspicious. ""I'm not a Broadway baby, a belter, a razzle-dazzle kind of kid,"" she explained. Indeed, in her early cabaret performances, and on Broadway in ""Nine"" and ""Grand Hotel,"" Ms. Akers, above, honed her regal bearing and nonindulgent way with a tune to such a degree that you could hardly imagine her coming within a mile of a sequin or a shout. So the news that her new gig at the Oak Room would consist of songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb -- they of ""New York, New York"" and ""Cabaret,"" of the streetwise insouciance and ha-cha-cha dissipation -- seemed to suggest a misalliance. But two things conspire to predict a good match. One is that Ms. Akers's style has become less Olympian, more personal; beneath the perfect diction and lucid phrasing you can hear her heartbeat. It's also true that the Kander and Ebb catalog is more varied, and frequently much darker, than their most Lizafied songs might indicate at first glance. ""I went to the music and found that it offered me a lot more latitude than I expected,"" Ms. Akers said. ""It opened itself up to me."" That's because the songs were written for complex theatrical situations; the balance between hopefulness and the implied despair that makes hopefulness necessary is always being negotiated. Still, she ""sidestepped"" most of the flashier numbers in favor of actorly songs from lesser-known shows like ""The Happy Time,"" ""The Rink,"" ""70, Girls, 70,"" ""The Act"" and ""Steel Pier."" But ""Cabaret"" is not entirely shut out. From that show Ms. Akers will sing the relentlessly conditional ""Maybe This Time"" and, most fittingly, ""Married"": a perfect ode to mismatches that aren't.

At the end of the volume, a series of appendices and a biographical sketch provide, among other things, information about the author of the novellas. Born in Ukraine, Irne Nmirovsky had lived in France since 1919 and had established herself in her adopted country's literary community, publishing nine novels and a biography of Chekhov. She composed ""Suite Franaise"" in the village of Issy-l'Evque, where she, her husband and two young daughters had settled after fleeing Paris. On July 13, 1942, French policemen, enforcing the German race laws, arrested Nmirovsky as ""a stateless person of Jewish descent.""

But in Moore's novel, his taxonomy of the breed includes this observation: ""Many Beta Males, contrary to any empirical evidence, actually believe that they are Alpha Males, and have been endowed by their creator with advanced stealth charisma, which, although awesome in concept, is totally undetectable by women."" Moore's novel, his ninth, is his first to hit the Times list -- it makes its debut this week at No. 9. The book is about a guy named Charlie who becomes, more or less by accident, Death's assistant. (Death here is ""a very tall black man dressed in mint green."") Moore's cheerfully goofball prose has led critics to compare him with Tom Robbins, and these comparisons aren't wildly off base. But there was a time in Robbins's career, when he was hang-gliding over the late-hippie zeitgeist, that it seemed as if he might mature into a major writer. (Remember when Thomas Pynchon gave him a blurb? ""Robbins has a grasp on things that dazzles the brain and he's also a world-class storyteller."") Reading a Moore novel, you don't feel impending genius. But he's O.K. with that. As he put it in an interview on his Web site: ""People, even really stupid people, are very complex. If you try to make a character as complex as a real person then that's all your book will be about. They call that literary fiction. Hardly anything gets blowed up in literary fiction, so I don't write it.""",2006-04-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Nonfiction Chronicle,"GIRLBOMB: A Halfway Homeless Memoir. By Janice Erlbaum. (Villard, $21.95.) As Erlbaum learns, problems don't go away -- even when you do. A furniture-breaking, leering stepfather drove 15-year-old Erlbaum out of her home and into a Hell's Kitchen shelter. There, she writes, she was called ""white bitch"" and singled out for more abuse. One occupant, Sherri, heavily pregnant and furious (""When the nuns weren't looking, she'd take a flying leap at the arm of the sofa or smash her belly into the stair banister""), charged her with a small knife. Erlbaum, now a columnist for Bust magazine, describes the failures of a system designed to help young people: shelter residents were one missed curfew away from being thrown on the streets -- where, she discovered, you might end up, as one girl did, ""hanging around the men's bathroom at the Port Authority with some pit-faced guy in zebra-striped weight lifter's pants."" At a group home on the Upper West Side, she was threatened with ""Treatment,"" which sometimes involved wearing a sign (for example, one that said baby) around your neck. School ""functioned mostly as a clearinghouse for drumming up drugs, sex or shelter."" At one point she worried, needlessly, that people thought she was ""a Goody Two-Shoes."" ""Not at all,"" a friend assured her. ""Maybe, like, a Slutty Two-Shoes."" Erlbaum was hard to help. And everywhere she went, adults failed her: counselors seemed psychotic; teachers were indifferent; her mom floundered. How satisfying to watch Erlbaum survive adolescence and produce a smart, engaging book -- ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Pothead,"" you might say -- that indicts those who wronged her yet never dissolves into tears or tantrums. Eventually, she did what many adults never manage: she grew up.",2006-04-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Pro-Life Nation,"It was a sunny midafternoon in a shiny new global-economy mall in San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador, and a young woman I was hoping to meet appeared to be getting cold feet. She had agreed to rendezvous with a go-between not far from the Payless shoe store and then come to a nearby hotel to talk to me. She was an hour late. Alone in the hotel lobby, I was feeling nervous; I was stood up the day before by another woman in a similar situation. I had been warned that interviewing anyone who had had an abortion in El Salvador would be difficult. The problem was not simply that in this very Catholic country a shy 24-year-old unmarried woman might feel shame telling her story to an older man. There was also the criminal stigma. And this was why I had come to El Salvador: Abortion is a serious felony here for everyone involved, including the woman who has the abortion. Some young women are now serving prison sentences, a few as long as 30 years.",2006-04-09T05:00:00+0000

""The reason to go to Sweden is very basic: I love skating and hate ice rinks and there is very little natural ice in Holland. Every year I try to go for three to four weeks. The race is on an interconnected lake system which widens and narrows and undulates. There are trees and farmhouses and you pass small villages. It's a route that the Vikings used in earlier days. I was No. 33, in a time of 3 hours, 28 minutes. The basic thing that appeals to me in skating? It feels like the closest thing to flying. When my technique is right, I can reach speeds of around 25 miles an hour.""",2006-04-09T05:00:00+0000

Most of us were too young to remember the Iran-Contra affair, at the time preferring Saturday morning cartoons to Oliver North. We did not know that our professor's notebooks helped to break open the investigation. Our ignorance was for the best. His presence, his hold on the class, was enough to make us freeze in our seats. Filled at first with the happy murmur of weekend gossip, the room snapped silent at nine o'clock when Professor Hill walked in. He wore a stone-colored suit, and he did not speak or look at us until he had taken his seat at the head of the table and pulled his yellow legal pad from his backpack.

Mr. Yassky's proposal is the most recent attempt to combat illegal gun sales in the city. A federal lawsuit that the city filed against gun makers in 2000 is pending. Last year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed another bill by Mr. Yassky that holds gun makers and dealers liable in civil lawsuits for selling guns that end up in the hands of criminals. It is debatable, however, whether the city has the authority to enact a product-liability law, and a federal law enacted last year gives gun manufacturers broad immunity from civil suits. Mr. Yassky's new bill, which seeks to establish civil penalties, may also be unenforceable, because very few gun makers and gun dealers are based in the city and state courts might lack jurisdiction.",2006-04-10T05:00:00+0000

The study, conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, surveyed 1,023 people who declared themselves readers. The group was then questioned about its poetry reading habits. Seventy-six percent of the total said they read poetry. Overall, the highest percentage of people who read poetry are educated white women. ""But if you look just at the percentage of African-Americans,"" said Norman Bradburn, a senior fellow at the center and a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, who supervised the study, ""as compared to the percentage of whites, a higher percentage of African-Americans -- 85 percent of those sampled -- are likely to read poetry than of whites."" Among the most surprising results: if you like poetry, according to the study, no matter what your race, there is a better chance that you're athletic, too, and enjoy the company of others. And there isn't necessarily a correlation between having a college degree and being a poetry reader. ""Fifty-six percent of poetry readers have less than a college degree,"" Mr. Bradburn noted. As for more women seeming to read poetry than men, ""I have a theory,"" he said. ""Maybe a lot more men read poetry than talk about it. It's not viewed as a very masculine thing. It's a kind of secret sin."" DINITIA SMITH",2006-04-10T05:00:00+0000

She was an extraordinary colleague. Her passing leaves a huge void in the institution that is impossible to replace. Denise wrote extensively about civil rights and equal educational opportunity. Her most recent scholarly work focused on the role of the federal government in protecting individual rights, which she explored as principal editor of ""Awakening from the Dream: Civil Rights Under Siege and the New Struggle for Equal Justice"" (2005). Denise taught federal courts, civil procedure, evidence, a seminar on race and American history and a course on education policy and the law. Her passionate concern for educational inequality in America turned to advocacy with her involvement in the landmark litigation, Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc. v. New York State, in which she represented the Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus. Denise received her BA and her JD from Yale University. Before joining the New York Law School faculty in 1995, she clerked for the Honorable Marilyn Hall Patel, US District Court, Northern District of California, and worked as an associate at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton.

On June 21,1964, I took the long bus ride to Charleston, W.V., to start my journey. We arrived at P.I. in the early morning hours and were promised beds as soon as they were ready. It didnAt take long for reality to set in. I wasnAt in W.V. anymore. Boot camp in the 1960As was nothing like it is now. Vietnam was not a big topic at that time. It was just getting started. Advisors had been sent to help the Vietnamese army. After getting to Camp Pendelton (California) it seemed like more troops were starting to be sent over, beginning the buildup. I had no idea at that time that I might be sent to war. Mid-1965 there were more rumors that we might go. I had no clue what we would be facing.",2006-04-11T05:00:00+0000

The teenagers -- Humberto Guzman, 13, Denzell Fell, 13, and Hassan Mayfield, 15 -- were charged with second-degree murder in the death of the student, Broderick J. Hehman. A fourth teenager, Andre Johnson, 15, was arraigned on Sunday on the same charge. A prosecutor, Joel J. Seidemann, said the defendants had implicated a fifth youth, who had not been arrested by last evening, who they said had instigated the robbery attempt on April 1. Mr. Mayfield told the police that the group had followed Mr. Hehman to rob him of his cellphone, prosecutors said. The four were charged as adults, but if convicted they would be sentenced as juveniles to a maximum of nine years to life in prison. ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS (NYT)",2006-04-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   SCHEAR, STANLEY","SCHEAR--Stanley, 77. Died peacefully at home at the Schear farmhouse in Briarcliff Manor, NY, on Saturday, April 8, of esophageal cancer. Since 2001, Stanley dedicated himself to the low-income elderly residents of Westchester County as the Director of the LIFE Program (Living Independently for the Frail Elderly) of Family Service of Westchester. For the preceding decade, Stanley directed the Bridge Fund of Westchester, a program that prevents homelessness by making it possible for at-risk individuals and families to stay in their homes and apartments. Before becoming a full time advocate for affordable housing, Stanley was renowned for twenty-five years as the owner and operator of Jespersen's Pastry Shop in Scarsdale Village, where his famed chocolate pastry, named for Sarah Bernhardt, brought joy to countless fans. Stanley was also well known as a community activist who believed that all people deserve the dignity of a roof over their heads, regardless of their race, income, age, or mental health status. An avid defender of the U.S. Bill of Rights, Stanley served on the boards of the Westchester County and New York State Civil Liberties Unions, as well as the Paul Robeson Foundation. Stanley founded and organized the annual Bill of Rights Day Celebration for high school students, which takes place at St. Paul's Church in Mt. Vernon, the site of the trial of Peter Zenger, which established freedom of the press. Stanley is survived by Doris Schear, his loving wife and life partner of 58 years, his daughter Rose Anne and sons Stuart and Mitchell, and their families. Stanley leaves behind many friends, admiring colleagues, and fellow activists who believe in the full promise of the American dream for all. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Stanley's honor to the Sunshine Fund of Famliy Service of Westchester, which meets critical needs of the low-income frail elderly, so they may live with dignity. Donations to the Sunshine Fund may be sent C/O FSW, One Gateway Plaza, Port Chester, NY 10573. Burial will be private, and a public memorial Service will take place at the Westchester Society for Ethical Culture on Saturday, April 29, at 1 PM.

Here, he contributed to the design of some 150 products -- 14 now part of the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection in New York -- including such icons as the 1960 Sanluca chair and the 1962 Arco floor lamp, shown with Castiglioni, above left, and the 1957 Mezzadro stool, inset. The museum has five rooms with models and renderings, above right, preserved as Castiglioni left them when he died at age 84 in 2002. He got his professional start in 1944 working alongside his brothers, Livio and Pier Giacomo. Livio quit the practice in 1952, but Pier Giacomo continued the partnership until his death in 1968. ""Achille was endlessly curious,"" said his widow, Irma. ""He could look at an object and see it in a way no one else could."" He drew inspiration from miscellaneous objects; a slipper gave rise to the Sanluca chair, she said. Gigliola Pigni, who teaches at a high school near Milan, said, ""It's very easy to teach the visual history of design in Italy from a book, but very hard to convey the spirit of creativity,"" adding that she recently led students through the studio not only to show them the famous tables, lamps and chairs, ""but what went into creating them."" The Studio Museo Achille Castiglioni is at Piazza Castello 27. For hours and reservations: (011) 30-02-805-3606.",2006-04-13T05:00:00+0000

The Cocteau troupe, which merged last month with Ego Po Productions of New Orleans to form the new partnership EgoPo/Cocteau, discovered the error after several press previews had taken place late last month, said Peter Finn, the chairman. Opening night had been scheduled for March 31. Before the merger, Ego Po presented ""The Maids x 2"" in New Orleans and Philadelphia, and Lane Savadove, its artistic director, said the company had obtained the proper rights for those productions and paid the fees but had lost all the paperwork when its theater was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. But Charles R. Van Nostrand, president of Samuel French Inc., the theatrical publisher, said that the New Orleans production had not been properly licensed, and that approval for the New York production had been further complicated because the application was received at the last minute. He said yesterday that discussions were still under way with representatives of the Genet estate. Mr. Finn said he had offered to write a personal check for any back fees and penalties. The first public performance of ""The Maids x 2"" was scheduled for tonight, but Mr. Finn said that he did not know if it would go on. BEN SISARIO",2006-04-13T05:00:00+0000

There are other, perhaps even greater, pleasures to be had in dance, among them the burnished artistry that comes with age. And proof of that will be offered in performances, beginning on Thursday at Symphony Space, by Paradigm, a modern-dance company founded in 1998 as an outlet for the distinctive skills of older dancers. Several dance legends will appear, among them Dudley Williams, Martine van Hamel and Carmen de Lavallade, who will be seen in ""Will's Ladies,"" a solo in which Ms. de Lavallade shifts fluidly from one Shakespearean heroine to another. There will be new dances choreographed by Ms. de Lavallade and Gus Solomons Jr., as well as one that Judith Ren-Lay created for herself. But the point, most of all, is the dancers, who also include Hope Clarke, Valda Setterfield, Stuart Hodes, Alice Teirstein and Keith Sabado (at left, above, with Mr. Solomons and Ms. de Lavallade). All are over 60, and most have performed with major modern-dance and ballet companies. Mr. Solomons, who runs the company, admits that he did let one youngster sneak into the fold, a 47-year-old named Michael Blake, who danced with Donald Byrd, Jos Limon and Alwin Nikolais. It is a rich legacy he and the other Paradigm performers are passing along. But there is an even simpler rationale for a company like this to exist. Mr. Solomons talked of a call he received from one dancer on the program, who had heard of the company and wanted to join. ""I'm still strong,"" she said.

us,The Listings: April 14 - April 20; SABADO DE GLORIA: ALL-STAR SALUTE TO THE GIANTS OF LATIN JAZZ,"Sabado de Gloria is the Latin American version of Holy Saturday, which precedes Easter Sunday on the Roman Catholic calendar. It's a day of anticipation and renewal, cleansing water and purifying fire. (Also vengeful fire: the burning of a Judas effigy, often part of the celebration, is a custom unlikely to be hindered by recent debates about his innocence.) So it may seem exceedingly bold for the Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium to schedule a blowout Latin jazz concert for tomorrow night, and to call it Sabado de Gloria. But there is an idea at work here: the concert pays tribute to the departed heroes of Latin jazz, with an explicit dedication to the King of Mambo, Tito Puente. (You can only assume that the percussionists Ray Barretto and Don Alias, who both died this year, will be honored as well.) Among the all-stars assembled for this purpose are Dave Valentin, one of the leading flutists in Latin music; Hilton Ruiz, a versatile and articulate pianist; Giovanni Hidalgo, above, a well-traveled percussionist; and Papo Vazquez, an audacious trombonist. The Cuban drummer Dafnis Prieto and the Puerto Rican bassist John Benitez will represent a newer generation of Latin players; the trumpeter Randy Brecker and the alto saxophonist Sherman Irby will represent the so-called jazz mainstream. In terms of repertory, the concert will draw from both sides, with an emphasis on musician-bandleaders like Rafael Hernndez Marn, Charlie Palmieri and Freddie Hubbard. The only voices unheard, it seems, will be those Catholics who maintain that Holy Saturday should be the quietest day of the year.

Jr., (Retired President & CEO of Bouchard Transportation Co., Inc.) of Hobe Sound Florida passed away suddenly on Tuesday, April 11, 2006. Morton was a long-time resident of Long Island New York prior to becoming a resident of Florida in 1988. Morton graduated from LaSalle Military Academy, Oakdale, New York and went on to attend Hofstra University prior to joining the U.S. Navy. Upon completion of his naval obligations, Morton joined his father, Morton S. Bouchard Sr., and his brother Fredrick Bouchard at Bouchard Transportation Co., Inc. In 1972, Morton took the helm at Bouchard Transportation Co., Inc. and guided its growth to become the largest independently owned ocean going petroleum Barge Company in the United States. In the years 1972-1983 Morton is credited with building the largest petroleum barges to service the Northeast and Gulf Coast Petroleum infrastructure, and provide the petroleum industry with efficient and environmentally safe transportation. Morton was the past recipient of the American Legion, Robert L. Hague Post, Maritime, Man of the Year. Morton was involved in bringing the Senior/Champions tournament to Long Island and developed a unique friendship with various professional golfers and went on to build the Bouchard Family Learning and Child Center at the Chi-Chi Rodriguez School in St. Petersburg Florida. Morton, throughout his professional and retired life was always there for various underprivileged children's organizations and believed that every child deserved a chance to grow both mentally and athletically. Morton had a passion for golf and passed away on the 18th tee of his favorite club. Morton is survived by his loving and devoted wife of 52 years, Jane, and four children, Kim Bouchard, (Palm City, FL), Morton S.

Then on canvas he paints large copies of those collages in which the mismatched eyes, noses and mouths are realistically rendered, while other areas of the face, as well as hair, clothes and backgrounds, are loosely painted with broad brushes. The result is a savvy mix of modern styles: Cubism, Surrealism, Expressionism and Pop. The images also have a strange, monstrous glamour, a zany humor and an unexpected pathos. With her sad, soulful eyes, swatch of purple hair and radiant green, Constructivist background, ""Holly Rejuvenation,"" above, could be a Postmodern Madonna. Mr. Chen was born in Beijing at the end of the Cultural Revolution, attended the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, earned an M.F.A. degree at the State University of New York at Purchase and now lives in New York City. His paintings might be oblique meditations on the extreme shifts of cultural perspective he has had to adjust to in his life. Certainly, they have something to do with everyone's struggle to maintain a unified sense of self in the face of the constant barrage of social and cultural dissonance that is modern experience.

Some say the four killings, which took place at Moore's Ford bridge in July 1946, were the last public lynching in the United States. The renewed interest comes after a public re-enactment of the killings last July organized by civil rights leaders. ""We think this is a very important, significant move on the part of the Department of Justice,"" said State Representative Tyrone Brooks, who represents parts of Douglas and Fulton Counties and is president of the Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials.

Ukraine has one of the fastest growing rates of H.I.V. infection in Europe, with more than 1 percent of the adult population already infected, but the government has resisted the bank's suggestion that the funds be given to nonprofit groups that could act more quickly to reach prisoners, drug users and prostitutes at high risk of infection, said Nicholas van Praag, a bank spokesman.

And he has only 26 minutes to do it in David Baeumler and Drew Martin's film ""Fudgie & Jane"" (2003), starring Jonathan Frappier and Olivia Griego, above. It's one of the love-story shorts selected by the Chicago City Limits comedy troupe for the self-confidently titled ""Best of First Sundays: A Hilarious Retrospective."" In addition to the romantic comedies (described as the group's ""favorite movies about love, romance and stalking""), there are evenings devoted to documentary, animated and low-budget shorts. (The low-budget one is followed, appropriately, by a beer-and-pizza reception with the filmmakers.) The Chicago City Limits retrospective is, in turn, part of the Two Boots Pioneer Theater's Comedy Fortnight, which runs through April 26. Its centerpiece is Brant Sersen's ""Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story,"" a mock documentary about a disgraced paintball champion, played by Rob Corddry of ""The Daily Show,"" who follows Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert in the diaspora of that show's cast. The series also includes clips from the New York video blog Rocketboom and screenings of Woody Allen classics, including ""Manhattan"" (1979), in which Mr. Allen's middle-aged character is torn between the high school girl he's been sleeping with and the woman his best friend loves. 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village, (212) 591-0434; $6.50 to $9.",2006-04-14T05:00:00+0000

But now, in a twist, it appears that Mr. Kean will have to contend first with a political distraction that he worked for more than a year to avoid: a challenger in the Republican primary. The potential rival is John P. Ginty, 41$(8$) a financial data analyst and former president of the Ridgewood Republican Club who proudly calls himself an ideologue and a social conservative. Last Monday, the filing deadline for the June 6 primary, Mr. Ginty filed petitions with 1,742 signatures. To qualify for a spot on the ballot, 1,000 valid signatures are needed. Mr. Ginty says that Mr. Kean has been a major disappointment, displaying moderate or muddled views on issues like abortion and stem cell research. He also accuses Mr. Kean of failing to ""articulate some understandable program for cutting the size of government"" at the federal level, and of not spelling out his views on foreign and defense policy.

More than 12 hours long, the film concerns the intertwined fates of a group of theater actors and a pair of eccentric flneurs as they venture into a labyrinth of coincidence, conspiracy, meta-narrative and role-playing. Made for and then rejected by French television, the film has remained all but unseen since a first public screening in 1971. (An imp of the cinematic perverse, Mr. Rivette surely delights in the fact that ""Noli me tangere"" is a Latin phrase meaning ""Touch me not."") Soon thereafter the restless auteur set to work on a slightly more viable edit of the project, and in 1974 he distilled it into the four and a half brain-boggling hours of ""Out 1: Spectre."" In the repertory coup of the season, Anthology Film Archives will screen this mythic film in a small but invaluable program of little-seen Rivette. ""Due to the extreme rarity of this film,"" state the program notes, ""print quality is not ideal."" As deterrents go, that's about as off-putting as a warning that some rediscovered bit of Sappho is missing a few words.

There is something deeply seductive about a wedding: romance in its great last stand, not yet sullied by routine and responsibility. Even a photograph of that ill-fated girl Diana Spencer, standing on the steps of St. Paul's, her veil caught in a gust of wind and her father waiting to take her hand, can provoke in me a vague yet undeniable longing. But it took only a few minutes of actually reading the texts of these manuals to bring me to my senses. More than fondness for my husband keeps me from getting on the phone to price tea roses and a tent. ",2006-04-16T05:00:00+0000

The most confusing television series of our time returns from a hiatus on Wednesday (ABC, 8 p.m.), beginning a sprint to the story's conclusion in May. Viewers last saw the pregnant Sydney Bristow, played by the pregnant JENNIFER GARNER, on a ship in the middle of the ocean, having survived a torture session overseen by her mother (LENA OLIN). If you've lost track of which characters are good and which are bad, who is alive and who is dead, and what the Rambaldi prophecy is, join the crowd.

Urrea, best known for his nonfiction accounts of hardscrabble lives on the Mexico-United States border, reaches back into his family history for this epic novel about a 19th-century Mexican saint, peasant and revolutionary. Born in 1873, Teresa Urrea, known as Teresita, was a distant relative, the half-Indian child of a wealthy Mexican landowner. Said to possess a supernatural gift for healing, Teresita suffers a terrible assault, rises from the dead and begins to perform miracles. Revered as the ""Mexican Joan of Arc,"" she creates a democratic groundswell among Mexican revolutionaries. Our reviewer, Stacey D'Erasmo, described Urrea's book as ""a mix of leftist hagiography, mystical bildungsroman and melancholic national anthem.""",2006-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Inside the List,"THIS WEEK IN GOD: Not unpredictably, Dan Brown's ""Da Vinci Code,"" newly out in paperback, kicks sand in the face of every pop novel out there -- it moves directly to No. 1 on the paperback fiction list. (This ranking combines sales of the book in three new editions: mass market, trade and illustrated. The scratch 'n' sniff version can't be far behind.) To date, these editions haven't dented sales of the hardcover version of ""The Da Vinci Code"" -- it appears at No. 2 on the hardcover list. The Brown juggernaut continues to spin off companion books: the two most recent, published the same day as the paperback, are ""Fodor's Guide to 'The Da Vinci Code' "" and ""The 'Da Vinci Code' Travel Journal."" Another new book catching a ride on ""Da Vinci Code"" mania is Michael Baigent's ""Jesus Papers"" (HarperSanFrancisco), which lands on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 5. Baigent, you'll recall, is suing Brown in a British court; he claims that Brown, in ""The Da Vinci Code,"" stole the ""architecture"" of his own book, ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" (1982), written with Richard Leigh. In ""The Jesus Papers,"" Baigent suggests, among other things, that Jesus' crucifixion was faked. This is faith-based literature -- that is, you'll have to take Baigent's word for his claims. Much of his case is based on papers that he says he's scrutinized but that no one else will probably ever see. Critics haven't been kind to ""The Jesus Papers."" On a recent epidisode of ""Dateline NBC,"" the scholar and writer Elaine Pagels said of Baigent's book, ""It's imaginative, to say the least."" Another historian, Craig Evans, added, ""It's voodoo scholarship.""",2006-04-16T05:00:00+0000

Sometimes they involved elaborate environments, like an abandoned town -- with a bowling alley, bank and convenience store -- bought whole to serve as a testing ground. In exercises where volunteers were exposed to pathogens, he was struck, he said in a talk at Bard College, by the theme-park atmosphere, where ""moonsuit-clad students go through their paces sniffing the air with exotic instruments.""

""I've tried to suggest a similar quality in my portraits, although my subjects are actually photographed in the natural settings,"" Mr. Shambroom said. Another important difference in the setting: the painterly quality is a result of a decidedly 21st-century effect -- digital manipulation.",2006-04-16T05:00:00+0000

A jury was chosen in May 2005, but Judge Shira A. Scheindlin sent the jurors home after the government brought a last-minute appeal seeking to have the case transferred to another judge. That appeal was rejected in January. Yesterday, the jurors were recalled and new ones added to create a pool of 35 for the final selection. The judge questioned the candidates to see if their views had been affected by news about the sentencing trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, who pleaded guilty to conspiring in the 9/11 attacks.

That helped the series premiere of ""What About Brian,"" which took the place of ""Grey's Anatomy"" at 10 p.m. The wistful ""Brian"" delivered 12.84 million viewers, meaning it lost a significant number of the ""Housewives"" audience. But in the 18-to-49 demographic, it fared better, and easily beat NBC's ""Crossing Jordan"" (12.46 million) and the conclusion of the CBS movie ""Covert One: The Hades Factor"" (6.76 million from 9 to 11 p.m.). On the Sunday schedule, NBC's ""West Wing"" (8.28 million) was not the only veteran show about to end its run forever.

The appeal, the latest move in a longstanding lawsuit by the advocacy group Campaign for Fiscal Equity, comes less than a month after a lower court ruled that Albany was shortchanging city schools by at least $4.7 billion a year -- but that only the governor and the Legislature, not the courts, could decide exact amounts of education aid. The appeal also comes nearly three years after the Court of Appeals ruled that city students were being denied a sound basic education and that lawmakers should address the problem. Michael A. Rebell, a lawyer for the plaintiff, said he believed that if lawmakers failed to comply with a court order mandating specific increases in state aid, they could face fines and jail time.

us,The Listings: April 21 - April 27; JOE LOVANO AND HANK JONES,"Jazz has always gleaned something vital and a bit mysterious from intergenerational dialogue: a spark of connection, the abrasion of contrast, an expression of the music's enduring elasticity. Each of those qualities can be found in the rapport between the 53-year-old saxophonist Joe Lovano and the 87-year-old pianist Hank Jones, both pictured above. The seeds for their current collaboration were planted four years ago at the behest of Mr. Jones, a distinguished veteran of the era in which jazz was a gilded branch of popular entertainment. The following year, having proved their chemistry on the bandstand, they conscripted George Mraz, the bassist in Mr. Jones's trio, and Paul Motian, a legendary drummer and longtime mentor to Mr. Lovano, for a Blue Note recording session. The result was ""I'm All for You,"" one of Mr. Lovano's simplest and strongest albums, released in 2004; an equally fine sequel, ""Joyous Encounter,"" appeared in 2005. Both are superb examples of a melodic and emotional frankness that used to be much more commonplace in jazz. Mr. Jones attests to that truth with a sparkling clarity and elegance, but Mr. Lovano testifies as well; he is one of the few musicians in his peer group to have come up the old-fashioned way, in touring big bands, and he has the ability to reach back to a premodern saxophone language with un-self-conscious ease. Performing next week as a duo, Mr. Jones and Mr. Lovano will model a responsive sort of interplay that would seem rarefied if not for its absolute lack of pretension.

Ms. Sunnegardh, left, had toiled in obscurity for nearly 20 years with little stage experience before being given an unusual understudy contract by the Met, based on an audition.

Her appearance at Carnegie Hall, singing ""In questa reggia"" from Puccini's ""Turandot"" and ""D'Oreste, d'Ajace"" from Mozart's ""Idomeneo,"" came about because of the withdrawal of the music director, James Levine, due to an injury. His program was scrapped, and his substitute, James Conlon, was asked to present a mainly vocal program, said Joseph Volpe, the Met's general manager. Ms. Sunnegardh immediately came to mind, Mr. Volpe said, adding, ""I thought this would be a wonderful opportunity for her and for the Met.""

Shakespeare here is more of a summer tradition, with productions of ""As You Like It"" and ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" occupying seemingly every park. But for those who don't want to wait, the Shakespeare Society, an organization that periodically holds discussions, mock trials and other events about the playwright (a bust of him, above), on Sunday presents a starry collection of some of the best actors in the city reading monologues, scenes and poetry from Shakespeare in celebration of his 442nd birthday. Among the highlights will be John Turturro's Richard III, Elizabeth Marvel's Cleopatra and Robert Sean Leonard and Philip Bosco reading a scene between Prince Hal and Falstaff. Avery Brooks, who has performed Othello at the Shakespeare Theater in Washington, will reprise that role opposite the Iago of -- intriguingly -- Denis O'Hare, whose charming accountant in ""Take Me Out"" won him a Tony Award. Also on the bill are Kathleen Chalfant (as Queen Elizabeth to Mr. Turturro's Richard III), Michael Cumpsty and Maria Tucci (as Richard II and the Queen) and Marcia Gay Harden, Amy Ryan and F. Murray Abraham (as Olivia, Viola and Malvolio from ""Twelfth Night""). If these fine actors aren't enough, there's another bonus: the whole thing is absolutely free -- so come early if you want a good seat.

us,The Listings: April 21 - April 27; 'REPULSION',"Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"" opens with the image of a woman's eye twitching, as the critic Raymond Durgnat observed, like a ""trapped animal."" This restless, glistening orb evokes both the image of the woman in ""Un Chien Andalou"" who passively stares at the camera as a man slices her eye with a razor, and two of the most haunting images in Hitchcock's work: the woman's eye that transforms into a spiral in the opening credits of ""Vertigo"" and Anthony Perkins's delicately fluttering eye peeping at Janet Leigh as she prepares herself for slaughter in ""Psycho."" The twitching eye in ""Repulsion"" belongs to Carol (played by the ethereally young Catherine Deneuve, above), the lonely London manicurist whom Mr. Polanski unleashes in this 1965 art-house shocker. With her peroxide flip and glazed mien, Carol looks a lot like one of Hitchcock's chilly blondes, but after her sister unwisely leaves her home alone, she starts making like the proprietor of the Bates Motel. Despite its sketchy, pop-Freudian hook, ""Repulsion"" works brilliantly as a vision of modern life at its most violently alienated. Faced with a storehouse of everyday grotesqueries -- a skinned rabbit curled on a plate like a fetus, potatoes covered with tentaclelike roots -- Carol freaks. Like several of Mr. Polanski's other apartment dwellers, she becomes trapped in that chamber of horrors we call the human mind. The beautiful new print of ""Repulsion"" showing at Film Forum through May 4 was made from the best available copies and is a must-see, with or without twitch.

Others settle onto a smaller turf, finding new things as they burrow along. Meg Stuart belongs to the second category. Her first recorded piece, a 1986 student work called ""In Passing,"" was described by Jack Anderson in The New York Times as suggesting ""choreographic traffic patterns"" that hinted at ""emotional relationships."" Her 1994 ""No Longer Readymade"" unfolded in an eerie space crammed with old armoires and dead birds. ""Remote,"" commissioned in 1997 by Mikhail Baryshnikov, explored alienation by deconstructing a pirouette. In a new work, ""Forgeries, Love and Other Matters"" (above), Ms. Stuart and her co-choreographer, Benot Lachambre, move ambiguously about a fur-covered hill, accompanied by Hahn Rowe, who created and performs the score. It is almost as if the three collaborators negotiated the traffic, walked through the backs of the armoires and came out into the shadowed city of ""Remote,"" beyond which lay that hill and another anomaly of human experience. Ms. Stuart, based in Europe since 1994, emptied her coat pockets of everyday detritus, including a shower of coins, in ""Readymade."" ""I'm still digging in the trash,"" she said teasingly. ""I still see the body as a container of memories and experiences, not only our own but as a receiver that picks up frequencies at the time and tries to filter them."" Her dances have been called filmic, a description she likes because it suggests to her that people are pulled in and unable to watch from a distance. But she is bucking a trend. ""Forgeries,"" she said, is a series of choreographed emotional states, a piece about a couple at the end of a relationship or of the world. Dance in Europe, she said, is pretty cool and conceptual these days.

Raises Venezuelan Safety Ranking, Ending Restrictions on Air Travel to the Country The federal aviation authorities upgraded Venezuela's safety ranking yesterday, averting a ban that would have blocked most United States airlines from flying to the country. The decision came after a team from the Federal Aviation Administration visited Venezuela last month to examine Venezuelan airlines' planes and procedures within the country's aviation authority. The Venezuelan government had protested an F.A.A. ranking that had prohibited Venezuelan airlines from flying their own planes to the United States or from introducing new services like expansions in routes. The restrictions, in place since 1995, forced Venezuelan airlines to rent planes and crew for flights to or from the United States. Venezuela had set an April 25 deadline by which the F.A.A. had to drop the restrictions or face retaliatory measures, including a ban or restrictions on flights by United States airlines to Venezuela.

In an expansive dialogue with the bio-ethicist Ignazio Marino in the magazine L'Espresso, the 79-year-old cardinal, a contender in the papal election last year, said, ""We need to do everything to fight against AIDS. And certainly the use of condoms can, in certain situations, constitute a lesser evil."" He also said legalizing abortion was ""positive"" in so far as it helped to ""reduce or eliminate"" illegal abortions. ""It is difficult for a modern state not to intervene, at least to prevent a brutal, arbitrary situation from developing,"" he said, but added that it should not constitute a ""license to kill."" And while he acknowledged the church's opposition to the use of embryos for research, he also called the use of frozen embryos by single women without a partner a ""lesser evil.""

Survived by children Ira and Cora, and spouses Trude and Al; grandchildren David, Andy, Peter, Mark, Sally, Jud, and the memory of a 7th, Bonnie; 12 great-grandchildren and one more, a girl, on the way. Married to Sidney for over 65 years, she missed him profoundly after his death in 2002. She grew up in a warm, loving and emotional family with parents Rose (nee Entin) and Louis Goldstein and brother Harold. The oldest child of immigrants, she spoke Yiddish as her first language and learned English when she went to school. Smart, aggressive and competitive at a time when there were few occupational or educational outlets for women of her abilities, she graduated from Franklin K. Lane High School and went on to study accountancy in college. Until recently, she pursued a passion for bridge, played well and won often. A child of the Depression, she championed and instilled in her children a strong sense of fairness and social justice. She was always uncommonly informed and remained an unreconstructed, unapologetic liberal, supporting many Jewish organizations and charities and contributing monthly to the American Civil Liberties Union. She leaves to her survivors a legacy of love, loyalty, liberal politics and the overriding importance of family. Funeral service at noon Sunday, April 23, at Schwartz Bros-Jeffer Memorial Chapels in Forest Hills. For information call 718263-7600.

He worked at the Hughes Aircraft Co for almost four years and then went to work for the Department of the Navy. In 1953 George went to the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (that later became the Courant IMS) at New York University where he worked until his retirement in1982. George also consulted for the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Center of Atmospheric Research while he worked at CIMS. George moved to Seattle in March 1996 to be closer to his family.

Strewn around the vintage 1970's couches, you're likely to see an assortment of fabric scraps and prototype T-shirts beside samples of unusual light bulbs that Charney wants to test for store displays. On his desk sit copies of Playboy from the 1980's, their pages carefully annotated and tabbed with colored stickers denoting their depiction of socks, pants, T-shirts, electronics, car designs and other markers of style from the period. Next to these is a stack of come-on letters from television and film casting directors hoping to get Charney to supply them with the kind of fresh and unusual faces on display in American Apparel's provocative print ads. Further over you'll find some books that Charney has been consulting, including a collection of Andy Warhol's early hand-painted works; ""The Concise 48 Laws of Power,"" by Robert Greene; and ""The Medium Is the Massage,"" by Charney's fellow Canadian Marshall McLuhan.

Germans (Swiss, Austrians and Alsatians, too) use duck, goose, chicken and pork schmalz depending on the dish and the state of their arteries. In very old German cookbooks that I use, butter schmalz is called for in baking certain pound cakes. But chicken schmaltz (with the ""t"") in Jewish households is usually homemade. All Winger need do is to take a big, fat, raw chicken -- like a soup fowl -- and trim off all the yellow fat and the skin of the neck and from around openings and render them slowly.

He is a movie director with an insider's knowledge of the industry, a film scholar with the history of Hollywood at his fingertips and a sincere, unabashed fan. The new Ava Gardner biography, he said in a telephone interview, made him nostalgic for the old studio system, when a star like Gardner could be built up from nothing. As a critic, Bogdanovich began his career celebrating classic Hollywood films -- writing monographs for the Museum of Modern Art on Orson Welles, Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock, and profiles for Esquire on Humphrey Bogart, James Stewart and Jerry Lewis, among others. Directing seemed the next natural step, and Bogdanovich has turned out everything from cult pictures like ""Targets,"" with Boris Karloff in his last major role, to the award-winning ""Last Picture Show,"" named a national treasure by the Library of Congress. His latest book, ""Who the Hell's in It,"" one of more than a dozen, gives him the chance to applaud in print 25 stars he has known personally. And television has provided him with an additional outlet for his energies.

He wanted some answers, an explanation, or at least a chance to ponder the great mysteries, before it was too late-love and death, the meaning and purpose of human existence, moments of vision, the voice of God, the manifest indifference of the material universe to injustice and suffering, the insanity of war, the mysterious tug of beauty on the human heart. What did he know about these things? Not a lot. But something. He'd never had a college education. He'd turned down a basketball scholarship at Michigan State University in order to go to work for Harry Becker up in Chicago. But he hadn't peddled avocados for thirty years on the South Water Street Market without learning a thing or two about life, and Helen, his wife, had practiced all her lectures on him when she'd started teaching art history at Edgar Lee Masters, dropping her slides one at a time into the projector on the dining room table, the front end propped up on a couple of paperbacks so that it cast a slightly top-heavy image on the wall over the sideboard. So he knew a little bit about Beauty too. Beauty with a capital B: not just a pretty face or a picturesque landscape, not just a Greek Aphrodite or a Renaissance nude or a Turner sunset, but something that might shoot out of an old man's face or out of a side of beef, sharp as his carbon steel kitchen knives, sad as bent notes on his guitar, but joyful at the same time.

Perhaps I am just a disembodied self usurping my body, strapped into a business-class seat in the plane, being borne to my designated burial ground-the cactus patch on the grounds of my home in Abeokuta, a mere hour's escape by road from the raucous heart of Lagos. Perhaps I am not really within the cabin of the plane at all but lying in a coffin with the luggage, disguised as an innocent box to fool the superstitious, while my ghost persists in occupying a seat whose contours have grown familiar through five years of a restless exile that began in 1994. For my mind chooses this moment to travel twelve years backward when, drained of all emotion, I accompanied the body of my friend Femi Johnson from Wiesbaden in Germany, bringing him home in defiance of the unfathomable conspiracy to leave him in that foreign land like a stray without ties of family and friends. And the pangs that assail me briefly stem from the renewed consciousness of the absence of this friend, whose thunder-roll laughter and infectious joy of life would have overwhelmed those welcoming voices that I know await me at my destination. Despite the eternal moment of farewell by his open coffin in the funeral parlor in Wiesbaden, it was difficult then, and remained continuously so, to reconcile that self with the absence of a vitality that we had all taken so long for granted, his big but compact frame in a box, immaculately dressed as though simply from habit-be it in a double-breasted suit with a carnation freshly cut by his chauffeur from the frontage garden, then laid ritualistically beside his breakfast set, or else in his casual outfit, its components no less carefully matched for all its seeming casualness, or his hunting attire, which appeared selected for a genteel English countryside ramble instead of a ""rumble in the jungle."" Difficult to accept the closed eyes that would bulge at some inspired business idea, at the prospect of a gastronomic spread, at the sight of a passing generously endowed female, or simply when charged with a newly thought-up mischief-but always lighting up the space around him. Still, I could not rest until I had brought him home, exhuming him from the graveyard in Wiesbaden, and the clinicality of my motions at the time made me wonder if I had left my soul in that alien graveyard in his stead.

Her books regularly hit No. 1 on best-seller lists there, and in 2000 she was named ""Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters."" She does pretty decently over here, too, of course -- she has sold more than 80 million books in the United States alone. Clark's new novel, ""Two Little Girls in Blue"" (Simon & Schuster), is her 33rd book and 25th suspense novel, and it debuts on the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 1. ""In my novels,"" Clark has said, ""I set out to scare people."" But she has built her fan base by not scaring anyone too much, and by avoiding sex scenes, graphic violence and profanity. ""Readers identify with my characters,"" she said in an interview posted on her publisher's Web site. ""I write about people going about their daily lives, not looking for trouble, who are suddenly plunged into menacing situations."" Many of Clark's readers also respond to her personal story. She was born in the Bronx, and her family struggled after her father died when she was 11. She worked at secretarial jobs and spent a year in the late 1940's as a stewardess before turning to writing. ""Where Are the Children?"" (1975) was her first suspense novel and her first huge success -- it's now in its 75th paperback edition. Clark still does plenty of publicity work for her novels, and she's good at it. She stumbled a bit on a recent appearance on CBS's ""Early Show,"" however. Hannah Storm -- who said she has read ""like 25"" of Clark's novels -- welcomed her, only to hear Clark say, ""Well, good morning, Barbara.""",2006-04-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Poetry Chronicle,"BLACK LAB. By David Young. (Knopf, $23.) American poetry -- according to one of the many competing caricatures -- is dominated by English professors and the minor epiphanies they have while walking their dogs. Dispelling this notion doesn't appear to be a priority for Young, emeritus professor of English at Oberlin, whose new book is named for the most popular breed of dog in America and opens with a poem called ""Walking Around Retired in Ohio."" But poems about pedestrianism needn't be pedestrian, and Young's are full of small, satisfying surprises. There's a destabilizing foreignness even in his most domestic scenes. ""Retired in Ohio"" turns out to be an imitation of the third-century Chinese poet Lu Ji. Later, Young riffs on a wild Paul Celan poem addressed to a discus: ""THROWPLATE, with / a face full of stars and foresights / throw yourself / out of yourself."" That yearning for transcendence may be Young's signature note, but the prevailing force in his poetry is gravitational, not centrifugal. Earth's the right place for love; the afterlife will be a family reunion only ""if the myths have got it right for once,"" and that's no small if. In the meantime, the best way to transcend our mortality is to make ourselves at home in it, to ""fill our eyes and word-hoards, / pick our way down mule trails, / and trust that somehow we belong to this."" Young is, in many respects, a conventional poet, but conventions are easier to disparage than the work a serious artist does within them. When it snows, Young's titular black lab ""bounds out, inebriate of cold. / The white flakes settle on his back and neck and nose / and make a little universe."" There's life in the old dog yet.",2006-04-23T05:00:00+0000

One of the most important and influential historians in the Twentienth Century, passed away Tuesday, April 18, at his home in Abilene, Texas, after a lengthy illness. He is survived by legions of loyal friends, former students, and honored colleagues who were all proud to have known him as ""Doc"" or ""Mac."" His work continues on through the programs and initiatives of the Grady McWhiney Research Foundation. He was born on July 15, 1928, in Shreveport, Louisiana. After attending school in that city, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in the last year of World War II. He met and married Sue Baca while in California in 1947, then returned home after the war. He graduated from Centenary College and then earned his Master's degree in History from the Louisiana State University studying under the legendary Francis Butler Simkins. He continued his studies at Columbia University in New York, where he was one of the first graduate students to work with the highly respected David Donald. He received his Ph.D. in 1960. McWhiney's dissertation focused on the life and career of Confederate General Braxton Bragg, and he made his life's work the study of the Civil War era in the United States, as well as of Southern history. He authored or contributed to dozens of books on these subjects. His most notable titles include the Civil War best seller ""Attack and Die"" that he co-authored with his doctoral student Perry Jamieson, and his narrative biography ""Braxton Bragg and Confederate Defeat, Vol. I,"" a work that was completed with Vol. II by Judith Lee Hallock. His most path-breaking and provocative work was ""Cracker Culture: Celtic Ways in the Old South."" McWhiney also wrote hundreds of articles for scholarly journals, and was a regular presenter at meetings of the Organization of American Historians, the American Historical Association, and the Southern Historical Association. He was also in great demand as a speaker for hundreds of Civil War enthusiasts' groups and civic organizations across the country and abroad. Grady McWhiney made an indelible mark on his profession and on the way that Americans, and Southerners in particular, view themselves. His life included an interesting mix of devotion, gentility, controversy, and dedication to his craft and to his students. He was also concerned that the study of history continue to be an important part of American education and society. As he put it, ""history should be accessible."" With that mission in mind, he founded the Grady McWhiney Research Foundation, located in Abilene, Texas. He lived a great life. He taught at such diverse colleges and universities as Troy State University, Milsaps College, the University of California at Berkley, Northwestern University, the University of British Columbia, Wayne State University, the University of Alabama, Texas Christian University, and in retirement at Mississippi Southern University and McMurry University. In the course of his 44-year career, he trained 19 Ph.D.s -- people who in fluence hundreds of thousands of lives and minds around the world through their work at colleges and universities and other history-related professions. Doc was fond of good conversation, excellent food and drink, Irish and Southern fiddle music, stylish cars, his friends, and his cats. Almost everyone who met him, though they may not agree with him, recognized him as the quintessential southern gentleman from his chivalrous manners to his snappy attire. As were his wishes, McWhiney's friends will hold a celebratory gathering for their mentor and compatriot on May 21, 2006, on the grounds of the Buffalo Gap Historic Village, where the aromas of wood smoke and pork barbecue will mingle with the sounds of laughter, fiddle music, and general conviviality as we bid farewell to our beloved companion. Sue Baca McWhiney predeceased him in 2000. His last days were eased by the unflinching kindness of Hospice of the Big Country. In addition, The Grady McWhiney Research Foundation continues his legacy of teaching and making history accessible to the rising generations. Memorials and contributions in his honor may be made to either of these organizations and will greatly help their important work. They may be sent to: The Grady McWhiney Research Foundation, Box 638 McM Station, Abilene, Texas, 79697; or to Hospice of the Big Country, 4601 Hartford St., Abilene, Texas, 79605.

The agency has not yet said what specific time-saving benefits cardholders can expect.

The only registered traveler program currently in operation is run by Verified Identity Pass at Orlando International Airport in Florida; membership costs $79.95 a year.

CBS drew the most total viewers over all, as its ""CSI: Miami"" (18.19 million) was the night's most popular show. Romance is blooming on the chilly procedural, which has Horatio (David Caruso) possibly heading toward marriage, as well as a love triangle among Miami's lint-picking lab police.

Everything we do is stitched with its color."" Roads were blocked off and bomb-disposal units called, but the police later said that none of the packages contained explosives and that the woman had said they were works of art.

Yesterday's hearing was left open at its conclusion and will continue on June 20, the board said. A number of museum directors testified yesterday in the Whitney's behalf, including Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art; Lisa Dennison, director of the Guggenheim Museum; and Thelma Golden, director of the Studio Museum in Harlem. Ms. Dennison called Mr. Piano's design ""an elegant and sensitive enlargement,"" adding that ""good and appropriate design does not necessarily fit in the zoning box.""

As a pioneer in the computer industry, Sandy also committed his energy and financial resources to the development of science and technology in Israel. His sustained generosity and devoted service as a member of the ATS National Board of Directors and Board of Regents and the Technion International Board of Governors earned him the most prestigious honors the university and the ATS can bestow: an Honorary Doctorate and the Albert Einstein Award. Through the Sanford Kaplan Chair in Aerospace Engineering, the Sanford Kaplan Family Dormitory, the Sanford Kaplan Prize for Creative Management in 21st Century High Technology, and the Kaplan VIP Rooms in the Technion's Leon and Julia Forchheimer Faculty Center, his name will be forever linked with the Technion, which he supported at the highest level.

us,'ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG: SILKSCREEN PAINTINGS 1962-63',"This show may be the perfect chaser to the lavish visual feast presented by the recent survey of Rauschenberg's 1954-64 combines at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. For one thing, the exhibition is tiny rather than exhaustive: seven works displayed in the jewel-box gallery of Craig F. Starr Associates, one of New York's smallest and most pleasant viewing spaces for drawings and paintings. For another, it shows what happened next. Mr. Rauschenberg began experimenting with silk-screening, which he learned from Andy Warhol, as his combine period was winding down. It provided a form of paperless collage similar to Rauschenberg's innovative transfer method, used to good effect in his drawings for Dante's ""Inferno."" Silk-screened images could also be any size and more seamlessly integrated with brushwork. The paintings start out small and devoid of color. Their black, white and gray palette tends to be dark; one work, involving a view of New York's rooftop water tanks, is so Romantically gloomy you may be reminded of Goya. Other recurring images include a car's headlight and some mosquitoes (above) and the outline of a box, which would become something of a signature. Abrupt passages of brushwork impinge, revealing, as do the combines, Mr. Rauschenberg's persisting affinity for Abstract Expressionist paint handling. These works could almost be homages to Franz Kline; they make explicit the urban tumult that hovers just offstage in Kline's black and white work. But Mr. Rauschenberg was not above mixing real brushwork with silk-screened versions, as in ""Payload,"" the largest and most confidant piece here. The combines also exert an influence. ""Dry Cell"" involves the metal frame of a folding stool, a coat hanger and a small sheet of Plexiglas printed with an image. Behind it you'll see a small piece of crushed metal that is supposed to spin when a sensor picks up movement in the immediate vicinity and the batteries to make it happen. (Craig F.

us,Robert Altman Retrospective,"""Brewster McCloud"" (1970) was a full-fledged counterculture movie of its time, with strong opinions about sex and conformity, and a fashionable disrespect for authority and age. It's the story of an unusual young man getting into shape to fly like a bird, but all these years later the visual images are the message: Bud Cort as Brewster, at home in the fallout shelter of the Houston Astrodome. Sally Kellerman as his mentor, revealing the angel-wing scars on her back. The undeniably white Michael Murphy as a big-city cop named Shaft. Close-ups of Shelley Duvall (above with Mr. Cort) with oversize Twiggies -- bottom eyelashes drawn on with eyeliner, a 1960's makeup affectation. Rene Auberjonois as a disheveled lecturer becoming increasingly birdlike. Stacy Keach, made up as an elderly man with long white hair, zipping along the highway in his wheelchair. Margaret Hamilton in a tiara. Not to mention a couple of blatant ""Wizard of Oz"" references and one of the oddest car chases in movie history. ""Brewster McCloud"" will be shown on Sunday as part of the Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of the director Robert Altman's work. The program includes his best-known films, like ""MASH,"" ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller,"" ""Short Cuts,"" ""The Player"" and ""Gosford Park."" Lesser known work will be shown too, including ""Secret Honor,"" ""Images"" and ""H.E.A.L.T.H."" Mr. Altman will make two appearances during the series: on the first day, tomorrow (at a museum screening of his 1996 film ""Kansas City"") and on the last, June 8 (at an advance Directors Guild Theater screening of his newest film, ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" written by, yes, Garrison Keillor). (Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077; $10, $24 for the special screenings followed by discussions with Mr. Altman.)

us,YEAH YEAH YEAHS,"Emerging from Brooklyn five years ago with a challenging and exuberant style that filtered lusty blues-rock through brittle minimalist punk, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have always made a great deal out of very little. The guitarist and noisemaster Nick Zinner and the drummer Brian Chase carve out caverns of sound for the screecher-singer-high-kicker Karen O (above with Mr. Zinner, left, and Mr. Chase) to dance and strut around in, daring a listener to keep up with her. That might sound possible inside your headphones, but onstage she is as electric a performer as the downtown rock scene has produced in many years. The band's new album, ""Show Your Bones"" (Interscope), adds new textures like dry acoustic guitar, as Karen O sings -- really sings, not just screams -- about the glum aftermath of a failed affair. (""When you mean it on the inside you still can't get to me,"" she sneers in ""Way Out."") But it's not a softening: dramatically and intensely the band always finds its way to a full-volume, heavy-as-Zeppelin erotic release. And you still can't keep up with Karen O, though it is impossible not to try. (Tuesday and Wednesday at Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, 212-777-6800; sold out.)

Isabella Rossellini wrote and narrates the short documentary, which was directed by Guy Maddin and will be shown tomorrow at the Tribeca Film Festival in honor of the centennial of the director's birth. (He died in 1977.) In ""My Dad Is 100 Years Old,"" Mr. Rossellini is depicted as a large belly, which Isabella Rossellini said represented one of her prominent memories of him. Ingrid Rossellini said she was outraged by the conceit, and by the showing of a widely known scene from the director's ""Rome: Open City,"" in which a German soldier shoots a character, played by Anna Magnani, in the stomach. The movie insults her father's memory, she said. ""Father was so much against this kind of trivialized images or sensationalism,"" she added, echoing comments made last week to The New York Sun. She said that she objected less to the film than to its use as a memorial to Mr. Rossellini. Isabella Rossellini did not respond to requests for comment. DANIEL J. WAKIN",2006-04-28T05:00:00+0000

The beloved wife of Gene (deceased); loving mother of Nancy and Alan Brooks, Richard and Marlene Kohn, and Ronald and Marilyn Kohn; adored ""Grandma Bobbie"" to Bonnie and Andy Jonas, Larry and Cristina Brooks, Larry and Jami Kohn, Linda and Matthew Heller, Huey Futch, Josh Kohn, Elizabeth and Jason Prior, and Amanda Kohn; doting Great Grandma to Tyler, Ryan, Nathaniel, Jacob and Vivian. Bobbie was born in 1921 in Brooklyn to Irwin and Bertha Kotcher. She graduated Erasmus High School and New York University which is where she met the love of her life, Gene. They married in 1941 and lived first in Brooklyn and then Lawrence, Long Island. She was a founder of the Brooklyn Hebrew Home for the Aged, she started the women's division for the Albert Einstein Medical School, she was the guiding spirit behind the Head Start Program in Newark, NJ. In 1960 they moved to South Orange, NJ and began a new era in their lives. Gene was a manufacturer of children's wear and Bobbie was his designer and partner. As the business grew and moved offshore, the family moved again in 1976 to Miami. Wherever she went, Bobbie gathered people to her. She was a sister, a best friend, a mentor, a soul mate to everyone who knew her. She was extraordinary. She had the capacity to love everyone and be loved by everyone. She loved the arts and theatre and sculpted through the years. In her later years, she found love again with Seymour Rosenthal. Together, they traveled. In her last 18 months, she went to China, Alaska, and around the United States. She never missed an occasion to celebrate with her family and close friends, and she will be sorely missed by all who knew her. Funeral will be held Friday, April 28, at 3 PM, at Temple Beth Am, 5950 N. Kendall Drive. Levitt Weinstein: 305 274 0641.",2006-04-28T05:00:00+0000

us,MEMORIAL FOR DEREK BAILEY,"Spontaneity was more than a guiding principle for Derek Bailey; it was more like a driving obsession. Before his death of a motor neuron disease just over four months ago, Mr. Bailey, above, was probably the most august guitarist in free-improvised music, a virtuoso whose technique was often readily apparent but also perplexingly opaque. Originally trained as a jazz and dance band professional in his native Yorkshire, England, Mr. Bailey committed himself to what he called a nonidiomatic approach to improvisation shaped by the exigencies of the moment. To keep those conditions fresh, he constantly sought out unusual collaborations. He was slated to organize a series of them next month at the Stone, the East Village space owned by the saxophonist and composer John Zorn. After Mr. Bailey's death, his widow, Karen Brookman, worked with Mr. Zorn to flesh out the details and carry on. The result is a month of programming fascinating for its scope: it begins on Tuesday with Mr. Zorn and the turntable artist Christian Marclay and ends on May 31 with a glass-instrument performance by Miguel Frasconi. Among the many highlights is a May 19 program of oral tributes and personal recollections offered by Ms. Brookman, among others. But every set will be a tribute in some way. ""I had the daunting task of deciding when to visit N.Y. once the calendar was complete,"" Ms. Brookman wrote from England last week by e-mail. ""It became quickly obvious to me that it had to be for the whole month -- any other option was not an option.""

The new booth will have two additional windows, and waiting ticket-buyers -- yes, there will still be waiting -- will stand in the breezeway between 45th and 46th Streets. The renovation is expected to be done by late December and will include construction of a new TKTS booth. There is always, of course, the other TKTS booth, at South Street Seaport, where next-day tickets are sold. It's not going anywhere. CAMPBELL ROBERTSON",2006-04-28T05:00:00+0000

""If such lies and errors had been directed at the Koran or the Holocaust, they would have justly provoked a world uprising,"" he said. ""Instead, if they are directed against the church and Christians, they remain unpunished."" Archbishop Amato, the second-ranking official in the Vatican's doctrinal office -- for years headed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who was elected pope last year -- urged a boycott similar to the one in 1988 against ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" the film directed by Martin Scorsese. Since ""The Da Vinci Code,"" by Dan Brown, was published in 2003, Catholic leaders and some other Christians have been outspoken against it. In these weeks before the film's May 19 release, Opus Dei, the lay Catholic group whose members are portrayed as villains in the story, has been sponsoring forums and other public events to refute the book's premise and to dispute suggestions that the group is shadowy and secretive.

And even though my father was foreign-born-he was a dandified but dour custom tailor from a Calabrian village in southern Italy who became a United States citizen in the mid-1920s-his references to me about soccer were associated with his boyhood conflicts over the game, and his desire to play it in the afternoons with his school friends in an Italian courtyard instead of merely watching it being played as he sat sewing at the rear window of the nearby shop to which he was apprenticed; yet, as he often reminded me, he knew even then that these young male performers (including his less dutiful brothers and cousins) were wasting their time and their future lives as they kicked the ball back and forth when they should have been learning a worthy craft and anticipating the high cost of a ticket to immigrant prosperity in America! But no, he continued in his tireless way of warning me, they idled away their afternoons playing soccer in the courtyard as they would later play it behind the barbed wire of the Allied prisoner of war camp in North Africa to which they were sent (they who were not killed or crippled in combat) following their surrender in 1942 as infantrymen in Mussolini's losing army.

us,'Stravinsky',"The summer of 1934, Stravinsky celebrated his new nationality by writing hismemoirs. Ever since the seed had been sown on a car journey from Biarritz toParis in 1932, it had been assumed that he would have a collaborator, andprobably that the collaborator would be his old friend from the Diaghilevyears Walter Nouvel. In fact Nouvel's role in the Chroniques de ma vie wasnever openly acknowledged, and nothing much survives to tell us exactly whatit was, apart from a contract awarding him a quarter of the book's proceedsin recognition of his part in ""establishing a French text,"" together with aseries of receipts. Remembering Stravinsky's businesslike attitude tocollaborators, one can take it that a quarter allocation represented a fairlysubstantial contribution; but to assert unequivocally that the autobiographywas ghost-written by Nouvel is greatly to overstate what we know. WhenProkofiev and Pierre Souvtchinsky called on Stravinsky in Voreppe at the endof August, they found him writing both the memoirs and a new piece for twopianos (this was the large-scale work left hangingat the start of 1933 when the Persephone commission came along). Nouvel wasthere too, but working-according to Prokofiev-on a book about Diaghilev. Sixmonths later Katya Stravinsky talks, in a letter to her husband on tour inthe U.S.A., about ""your finishing your little book by the time you arrive,""and their younger son, Svetik (Soulima), who was often present, remembersthe collaboration as something like free dictation, in which Stravinsky wouldwalk up and down in his study reminiscing and developing ideas in Russianwhich Nouvel would then convert into literate French.",2006-04-30T05:00:00+0000

La'Tanya was 13, Tichelle was 11 and, along with their two younger sisters, they had recently returned from a year in foster care to live with their mother, Jean. (I have used middle names to protect the family's privacy.) I was supposed to spend an hour or two with them and write an article for the paper about families that reunite. But I liked the girls, and I decided I needed to interview them again -- the joy of being an intern, after all, is that no one really cares when you finish your article. The next time I showed up, about a week later, a worried-looking woman was talking to the girls. She was a prosecutor who was about to try Jean's boyfriend, Earl Osborn, for sexually abusing La'Tanya and Tichelle over several years and their 7-year-old sister, Charnelle, for a shorter period. The girls were her chief witnesses.",2006-04-30T05:00:00+0000

us,'A Writer's Life'," I am not now, nor have I ever been, fond of the game of soccer. Part of the reason is probably attributable to my age and the fact that when I was growing up along the southern shore of New Jersey a half century ago, the sport was virtually unknown to Americans, except to those of foreign birth. And even though my father was foreign-born-he was a dandified but dour custom tailor from a Calabrian village in southern Italy who became a United States citizen in the mid-1920s-his references to me about soccer were associated with his boyhood conflicts over the game, and his desire to play it in the afternoons with his school friends in an Italian courtyard instead of merely watching it being played as he sat sewing at the rear window of the nearby shop to which he was apprenticed; yet, as he often reminded me, he knew even then that these young male performers (including his less dutiful brothers and cousins) were wasting their time and their future lives as they kicked the ball back and forth when they should have been learning a worthy craft and anticipating the high cost of a ticket to immigrant prosperity in America! But no, he continued in his tireless way of warning me, they idled away their afternoons playing soccer in the courtyard as they would later play it behind the barbed wire of the Allied prisoner of war camp in North Africa to which they were sent (they who were not killed or crippled in combat) following their surrender in 1942 as infantrymen in Mussolini's losing army. Occasionally they sent letters to my father describing their confinement; and one day near the end of World War II he put aside the mail and told me in a tone of voice that I prefer to believe was more sad than sarcastic, ""They're still playing soccer!""

They married in 1941 and lived first in Brooklyn and then Lawrence, Long Island. She was a founder of the Brooklyn Hebrew Home for the Aged, she started the women's division for the Albert Einstein Medical School, she was the guiding spirit behind the Head Start Program in Newark, NJ. In 1960 they moved to South Orange, NJ and began a new era in their lives. Gene was a manufacturer of children's wear and Bobbie was his designer and partner. As the business grew and moved offshore, the family moved again in 1976 to Miami. Wherever she went, Bobbie gathered people to her. She was a sister, a best friend, a mentor, a soul mate to everyone who knew her. She was extraordinary. She had the capacity to love everyone and be loved by everyone. She loved the arts and theatre and sculpted through the years. In her later years, she found love again with Seymour Rosenthal. Together, they traveled. In her last 18 months, she went to China, Alaska, and around the United States.

On the book's jacket, the publisher makes a point of noting that ""the author wishes to remain anonymous."" To judge from an exasperated blog the ghost writer is maintaining, however, he or she doesn't sound all that pleased to be kept in the wings.

Griffith's Civil War epic would have been named best picture. This is a landmark in film history, with one cinematic innovation after another, marred by the Kentucky-born Griffith's extreme sympathy with the South and Southern attitudes of the time. Reconstruction-era black legislators are portrayed as uncouth, barefoot drunks. A subtitle refers to a mob of ""crazed Negroes."" And the Ku Klux Klan is glorified in no uncertain terms as the savior of postwar civilization. The story focuses on two families, one on each side of the conflict. The 22-year-old Lillian Gish plays the young beauty in the Northern family. It was her 46th film.

Goldhagen honed her writing chops by covering celebrities for The National Enquirer and other gossip sheets, but in her assured first novel she focuses on the ordinary, mostly befuddled relationship between two brothers over the course of 25 years. Jack and Connor Reed were orphaned early, while Connor was still in high school, leaving Jack to raise him for a few years and sealing the tenuous but resilient bond that will connect them through marriages, affairs, children, divorces, career changes and health crises -- all the stuff of life, in other words, that anchors this affecting family portrait. The brothers aren't always likable (Jack, in particular, can be self-centered, cold and impulsive), and there's nothing dazzling about Goldhagen's narrative style: in exploring the tug of war between desire and family duty, she concentrates mainly on domestic details and interior lives. But she covers the familiar terrain with vitality -- this is real life with snappier dialogue -- and as the points of view expand to encompass the brothers' wives and children, her book reminds you that simply paying attention is one of the things literature can do best.",2006-04-30T05:00:00+0000

us,CORZINE AND JAMES GRAPPLE,"In a meeting that was as remarkable for its rawness as it was for being open to the news media, Gov. Jon S. Corzine jousted last Wednesday in Trenton with Newark's mayor, Sharpe James, and members of Newark's Municipal Council over their controversial plan to set aside $80 million in two private funds for redevelopment. With television cameras hovering, the meeting opened on a discordant note, when Mr. Corzine welcomed Mr. James, a fellow Democrat, to a conference table in the governor's private office. ""It's good to see you, Sharpe,"" the governor said to Mr. James, who seemed caught off guard by the presence of reporters and responded with silence and a stony countenance. The meeting quickly turned confrontational, as Newark officials defended their plans and accused the state of meddling in local affairs. By the end of the hourlong session, some Newark officials complained in angry and sarcastic comments about racial and election-year politics. At issue were two nonprofit funds created by the Municipal Council on March 1 to pay for redevelopment and rehabilitation projects that city officials said would provide a ready pool of money and flexibility in spending it. Both would be run by an advisory board that would include Mr. James and several allies. But the State Department of Community Affairs ordered the city last week to freeze or rescind any appropriations to the funds, citing unanswered legal questions and concerns about the board that would oversee them. Critics say the board would provide Mr. James with a source of influence even after he steps down as mayor in June.",2006-04-30T05:00:00+0000
