Hoch collapsed on the back nine with three bogeys and the double-bogey that started with a tee shot in the water. ""You can print it now: Hoch as in choke,"" said a distraught Hoch. That rhyme surfaced when Hoch missed a 2-foot putt that would have won the Masters in 1989. After Stewart had birdied the 18th hole to give him a four-under-par 68 and a 12-under 276 total, Hoch forced the playoff with a 35-foot birdie putt on 18 for a three-over 75. In the playoff at the par-4 18th, Stewart's drive was in great shape on the fairway, but Hoch pulled his tee shot to the left among some trees and he had no clear shot to the green.

But Martin pulled alongside the leader on the main straight and zoomed past, bringing Gordon with him.

The tale he tells is salted with wit, but though he chuckles from time to time he doesn't expect his listener to laugh along.

May 8, 1945, the day when the document ratifying Germany's surrender was signed in Berlin, is a perfectly shapeless day in my memory. I was in an American transit camp, in the midst of an enormous crowd of German prisoners who had all fled west from the collapsed Oder front to avoid falling into Soviet captivity. For five days we had been bivouacking under the open sky on a vast field surrounded by barbed wire. The military units had disintegrated in the chaos of the general flight, so there were hardly any familiar faces. We were hungry and covered with lice, and most of us were sick as a result of drinking undistilled water from the ditch that flowed through the camp, and because we had been lying on the bare ground day and night.",1995-05-07T05:00:00+0000

Taking off my clothes, I would lie back in the inlet and pass the time gazing up at the forest and the sky. It was my habit to trace, in the narrowed oblong of sky that I could see above the deep green of the hillside, a gigantic woman with a little man standing close by her side -- Oshikome and Meisuke. Oshikome's black hair was loose down her back, and her robe reached to her ankles. Meisuke wore a topknot and carried a sword at his side and a musket on his arm. Oshikome was the matriarch of the pioneers who had cleared a village in this forest.

There were fears of a new Depression. For Americans, more than for any other combatants, World War II was a paradoxical experience -- simultaneously horrifying and exhilarating. For all the fervor with which Americans committed themselves to a great national cause, they were terrified at the possibility of losing the struggle -- a possibility that seemed particularly real in that first difficult year after Pearl Harbor -- and of having to live in a world dominated by tyranny. Even as the war neared its end and victory seemed assured, optimism mingled with doubt; and several very different ideas about the nation, the world and the future seized the American imagination. Fifty years later, many of those ideas seem relics of a more innocent time. But perhaps for that very reason, they resonate still in the stories World War II veterans tell about themselves, and in the imaginations of their children and grandchildren.",1995-05-07T05:00:00+0000

It may seem so on the news that April unemployment jumped 0.3 points, to 5.8 percent, and payrolls fell for the first time in more than two years. But no, analysts said, the expansion is still alive -- but humbled. ""This is not a recession,"" said the head of the National Association of Manufacturers. And Labor Secretary Reich saw ""no evidence that the economy's going into reverse."" The bond market like it just fine, as long-term interest rates headed down close to 7 percentCHECKKKKKKK, the lowest level in a year. . . . but Layoffs Slow Down But look at it another way. The truly wrenching part of the job picture in recent years has been the mass layoffs, which, properly placed, can devastate whole neighborhoods or towns. But according to the latest employment report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, fewer layoffs were announced in April than in any month since May 1993. In fact, for 1995's first four months, the report said, layoffs were down by nearly half from last year. So even though unemployment is up, ""wholesale cuts are slowing,"" said John Challenger, the firm's executive vice president. And ""layoff figures are more indicative of how companies are looking at workforce reduction."" LIABILITY Bankruptcy Over Implants? The breast-implant mess keeps taking a toll -- and not just on the true victims, the women involved. Last week Dow Corning, facing 20,000 lawsuits, said it might have to file for bankruptcy protection, which would put a halt to all the litigation. Not that it would be broke. The company is owned by Dow Chemical and Corning, and also last week came news that Marion Merrell Dow -- 71 percent owned by Dow Chemical -- would be bought by Hoechst of Germany. What that means in the industry is yet another huge merger, this one creating the world's No. 2 drug maker, right after Glaxo Wellcome. And what it means for Dow Chemical is $5.1 billion (out of a total purchase price of $7.1 billion) to help it with implant settlements. TELEVISION Danger! Ad Rates on the Loose! Wait a second. Hasn't everyone in the universe already seen ""Jurassic Park"" 11 times? Well, NBC clearly hopes they'll make it an even dozen, for it paid $50 million for the rights to broadcast it, the first showing being tonight. And advertisers are paying $650,000 for 30-second spots -- an otherworldly figure that puts the event (that's the way NBC wants you to think of it, as an ""event,"" not a mere ""movie"") up there with such pivotal moments in world history as this year's Academy Awards or the ""Cheers"" finale in 1993. (Of course, it's still well behind recent Super Bowl ad rates, which are too absurd to mention.) Among the advertisers, of course, is the Ford Explorer -- which, you'll recall, got rather unkind treatment from Mr. Rex. AUTOS It's Drizzling in Detroit Well, Chrysler has been saying -- to fend off pesky takeover offers -- that it needed its $7.5 billion nest egg in case rainy days returned, and it may be right. Last week auto makers said sales were slipping badly -- off 6.1 percent in April, the fourth straight monthly drop. (One exception: Ford keeps selling light trucks; they rose 16 percent.) What's up? For one thing, even as interest rates ease, car-loan rates stay stubbornly high -- not to mention car prices. Maybe it's just part of a slowing economy. And maybe, with so many good used cars around -- thanks in part to leasing -- buyers don't care so much about shiny and new. But whatever the reason, watch for more rebates and good deals. BLAME GAME A Team Effort at Barings Nicholas Leeson is still in a Frankfurt jail, taking most of the heat for the collapse of Barings two months ago. But the new owner of what's left of Barings -- the Dutch company ING -- decided last week that it was unlikely that Mr. Leeson was the lone gunman, the supervillain of the piece. Without ladling out fixed doses of guilt, ING ousted 21 top Barings executives, saying they had ""functional responsibility"" for the mess at the Singapore outpost. The clear message: Even if those executives didn't know the disastrously risky road Mr. Leeson was taking, they should have known. BANKING Tellers With a Difference Yes, First Chicago had any number of sound, sober reasons for that $3 teller fee. And who knows -- maybe it is the best way to keep banking costs low for the low of balance. But let's face it: walking freely up to a teller (after waiting in line, of course) is right up there with sunshine and tulips -- it seems almost a constitutional right. Tinker with tulips and you make yourself an awfully easy target for all manner of reactions, from indignant to teasing. And sure enough, some Chicago-area banks had a field day, as Lake Forest Bank gave $3 to customers after their transactions were finished, and a Harris branch handed out dollar bills to customers who asked whether it charged fees. What did Richard Thomas, First Chicago's chairman, think of all this? ""A little silly,"" he said. NEWSPAPERS NEWS TO 42D ST.: SO LONG In 1930, The Daily News built an Art Deco temple for itself on -- where else? -- 42d Street, the center of the known universe. The building so resonated with nostalgic newspaperdom that it was used as a set in the ""Superman"" movies. But like the world, The News has changed. In 1947, its daily circulation was 2.4 million; today, the paper's bruises still healing from labor battles, it's scarcely a third of that. The payroll has plunged from 9,000 to a little over 1,000. The presses left the 42d Street building more than a decade ago. And last week The News made its biggest symbolic break with its past, leaving that home behind and moving to a single floor across town -- one with the high-tech bells and whistles deemed necessary for a modern paper. PUBLISHING Today's News (Net Wt., 12 Oz.) And here's another sign of changing journalistic times: when Times Mirror named a new chief executive last week, it wasn't someone from the ranks but Mark Willes, a General Mills vice chairman with no media experience. His message: ""Start from the consumer,"" strive to be ""the low-cost producer,"" ""refresh"" products just as food companies tinker with cereals and cake mixes. Yes, many newspapers are hurting -- Times Mirror's two big papers, The Los Angeles Times and Newsday, reported big circulation drops last week. But what's coming? Banner headlines saying ""Light and Fluffy"" or ""Only 17 Calories""? BROADCASTING The Murdoch Exemption Some matters, it seems, transcend the laws of the land -- matters like Rupert Murdoch's ownership of American TV stations. Yes, the F.C.C. said last week, Mr. Murdoch and his News Corp. had violated foreign-ownership laws -- but the agency said it had no intention of doing anything about it. No fines, no drastic cutbacks in his ownership stake. Why? As one commissioner, James Quello, put it, the ""compelling public interest"" lay in the creation of a fourth network to promote competition. As for Mr. Murdoch, he rejoiced that the ""meritless, wild and malicious charges of some of our competitors"" had been rejected. But of course the ownership issue was clearly not meritless -- just rejected.",1995-05-07T05:00:00+0000

Chamberlain (1829-1908) was by turns a Boston choirboy, a Texas roughneck, a United States cavalryman, a scalp hunter, a Civil War general, a curio-collecting gentleman of leisure and a Massachusetts prison warden. The paintings in SAM CHAMBERLAIN'S MEXICAN WAR: The San Jacinto Museum of History Paintings (San Jacinto Museum of History/Texas State Historical Association, $49.95) -- some of which illustrated Chamberlain's picaresque memoir, ""My Confession: The Recollections of a Rogue"" -- record his adventures in frontier Texas and Mexico. Chamberlain portrayed himself as a dime-novel hero -- storming adobe fortresses, dueling with saber and bowie knife and rescuing no fewer than six different maidens in distress. His art reflected what he had seen of the Mexican War: herds of mustangs, shrouded in dust, are mistaken for hostile cavalry; red-shirted Mississippi riflemen turn back a charge by Mexican lancers; in a nightmare cavern, Arkansas soldiers shoot down terrified villagers; guerrillas ambush supply trains and trade shots with dispatch riders. William H. Goetzmann, who teaches history at the University of Texas, Austin, ably sets the historical context, sorting out the truths in Chamberlain's tall tales. Boastful, cynical, sardonic and celebratory, these paintings are the triumph of a rough-edged American master. ALLEN BOYER",1995-05-07T05:00:00+0000

After Round 1 Kelly Robbins, with two runner-up finishes in the last three weeks, used a good putting touch yesterday to shoot a five-under-par 66 at the DuPont Country Club course and take the first-round lead in the Ladies Professional Golf Association Championship in Wilmington, Del. Robbins, who had five birdies, finished one stroke ahead of a group of four players that included Patty Sheehan and Dottie Mochrie. Laura Davies, the defending tournament champion and the leading money winner on the L.P.G.A. tour this year, and Alice Ritzman were another stroke back at 68. Robbins has recorded six straight rounds below par, including five in a row in the 60's. Michelle McGann, who won the Sara Lee Classic in Nashville last week for her first tour victory in seven seasons, withdrew. She complained of allergies and severe headaches early in the week, a tour spokeswoman said. (AP) TENNIS Agassi Picks Up Victory in 51 Minutes Andre Agassi breezed into the quarterfinals of the German Open with a victory yesterday in Hamburg. Agassi, the world's top-ranked player, coasted to a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Slava Dosedel of the Czech Republic in 51 minutes. But Pete Sampras, No. 2 in the rankings, battled for three hard sets to win, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2, against Daniel Vacek, a Czech ranked No. 53. The $1.7 million clay-court tournament is a major warm-up for the French Open, which starts May 29. In the quarterfinals, Agassi plays Sergi Bruguera of Spain, the French Open winner two years in a row. Bruguera missed six weeks with a knee injury earlier this season and, by a twist of fate, a similar injury to Richard Krajicek allowed him to move into the last eight when the Dutchman pulled out, trailing by 3-0. Sampras will next play Wayne Ferreira, the South African who beat the 1993 champion, seventh-seeded Michael Stich of Germany, 7-5, 6-1. (AP) UPSETS KEEP ROLLING IN ITALY: Unseeded Shaun Stafford touched off another wave of upsets with a surprise victory yesterday at the Italian Open and powered her way into the quarterfinals. Stafford, at 65th in the world the lowest-ranked player left in the field, eased past No. 16-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2. In another surprise, fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, a four-time Italian champion, self-destructed in a 2-6, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (8-6) loss to 13th-seeded Helena Sukova. A South African, Joanette Kruger, shocked fifth-seeded Anke Huber of Germany, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). Mary Joe Fernandez, seeded sixth, became the second American to reach the quarterfinals when she breezed past Meredith McGrath, 6-1, 6-1. Mary Pierce, seeded No. 2, who has dual American and French citizenship, but plays out of France, defeated Irina Spirlea of Romania, 6-2, 6-0. (AP) FRANA IS BACK IN FORM: Javier Frana of Argentina, fully recovered from a serious case of hepatitis in 1994, toppled third-seeded Jason Stoltenberg of Australia in the second round of the United States clay court championships yesterday in Pinehurst, N.C. The 60th-ranked Frana, who also upset the 25th-ranked Stoltenberg four weeks ago, scored a hard-fought 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 victory to advance to the quarterfinals. Top-seeded Magnus Larsson of Sweden routed Nicolas Pereira of Venezuela, 6-2, 6-3.

Poems Are Made by Refrigerator Magnets Like These","WHAT: Magnetic Poetry, 440 tiny magnetic word tiles intended to evoke the Ovid in everyone. Magnetic Poetry has its origins in writer's block. Whenever Dave Kapell, 33, a Minneapolis songwriter, felt creatively choked he would scribble words on strips of paper and rearrange them in various orders, a common exercise for poets. Then one day a friend who worked in a pizza parlor gave him a stack of refrigerator magnets. Having sneezed, wiped and spilled much of his work into oblivion, it dawned on Mr. Kappell that gluing his words to the magnets would give his verse staying power. True enough. Though hit singles are still elusive, Mr. Kapell is no longer struggling. Magnetic Poetry sales, which at $19.95 a kit recently topped 200,000 after 18 months, have bought him a house and a car. ""I'm quickly becoming bourgeois,"" Mr. Kappell said.ALREADY A MUSEUM PIECE: Magnetic Poetry is sold at many museum gift shops and other specialty boutiques. More important is where you can use it, which is basically on anything with magnetic force; most popular are refrigerator doors, filing cabinets, cookie sheets and car hoods.STARS ARE ATTACHED: Kits are known to have been purchased by Tim Robbins, Daryl Hannah and Gloria Steinem. Mr. Kappell personally gave one to Uma Thurman. Last Christmas, he sold them in bulk to executives at Paramount and Columbia Studios in Hollywood. ""Perhaps they were trying to give screenwriters a hint,"" Mr. Kappell conjectured. Mr. Kapell says he hopes Magnetic Poetry will help ""subvert the mentality that only people with berets can write and read poetry."" Truth is, he didn't much enjoy the genre at the University of Minnesota. ""I got turned off trying to understand Ezra Pound and all of T. S. Eliot's Catholic references,"" he said. ""I want to rebel against this fad of poetry slams where all these pretentious, tortured artists read such garbage.""WHAT REAL POETS THINK: ""It's a fabulous way of seeing how words rub up against each other,"" said Jonathan Galassi, president of the Academy of American Poets. Georgia Shreve, a poet, uses the game as a learning tool for third graders. ""It's particularly useful when teaching the style of E. E. Cummings, who liked short and simple words,"" Ms. Shrieve said.THE POWER OF WORDS: ""I'm not saying I'm John Lennon but I am beginning to realize that if my product is someone's first exposure to poetry, then I do have a certain responsibility, because it can change people's lives,"" Mr. Kapell said. He's not being immodest. There's the child psychologist whose 10-year-old patient expressed the pain of incest through a poem written with Magnetic Poetry. And the 85-year-old woman who wrote in to say: ""I found a part of myself I didn't know existed.""FUTURE VERSE: Already out is Magnetic Poetry for children, with larger letters and child-oriented words like ""mom,"" ""dad,"" and ""dinosaur."" ""No diminutives like doggy or kitty,"" Mr. Kapell exhorted, ever aware of his influence. Soon to come is a romance version that will contain lots of ""loves,"" ""candlelights"" and ""touches,"" as well as some semi-erotica like ""skin,"" ""breast,"" ""stomach"" and ""thigh."" Mr. Kapell says he chooses words based on their multiplicity. For instance, ""behind"" can serve as an adverb or a preposition, but also as a noun.",1995-05-14T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Miyake's show in March included six models, ages 67 to 93, dramatizing his belief that fashion knows no age. Seated in the audience was one of his clients, Mme. Leon Gischia, a nonagenarian, who has been providing a discreet show of her own for the last 10 years in her arrivals at Mr. Miyake's March and October shows. A former theater costume designer who is married to an artist, Mme. Gischia dressed at Gres in the 1940's and 50's, changing in the 60's to the modernism of Courreges. The next change in her style came when Mr. Miyake opened his Paris shop in the late 70's. She wears his most innovative designs with a confidence and a swagger that are entirely Parisian. In March, she wore a three-piece pleated jacket with fins cascading down the back (bottom right). She topped the outfit with a dashing black felt hat whose crown was decorated with the dripping from a wax candle (bottom far right).

As Peter C. Bunnell, a professor of the history of photography and modern art at Princeton University, writes in the introductory essay to MICHAEL KENNA: A Twenty Year Retrospective (Treville Company/RAM Publications, 2525 Michigan Avenue A-2, Santa Monica, Calif. 90404, $65), it is precisely because Mr. Kenna is a monochromist that his pictures seem like works of fiction rather than records of fact. ""The black and white film,"" Mr. Bunnell writes, ""inherently peels off interesting images from the world; it sees things we do not see, and thus insists on the existence of a phantom presence within reality."" The boundary between real and abstract blurs. In this sense Mr. Kenna, who was born in Lancashire, England, and now lives in San Francisco, takes after the artist who first sparked his interest in photography 20 years ago, Bill Brandt. But there is one big difference. Brandt played off human forms. In Mr. Kenna's still world, there are no people. Instead there are trees, some lonely, some sociable. Even the photographs that do not feature trees -- the photos of the architectural follies at the Desert de Retz a few miles west of Paris, of the Eiffel Tower's underbelly, of fence posts in Wales, of rails diverging from the Gare St.-Lazare in Paris, of the stumpy towers at England's Ratcliffe power station -- are arboreal shapes, homages to branches and trunks.

us,"Word for Word / Talk Show Wannabes; They'll Risk Life, Face and Pride for a Little Air Time","WHY would anyone want to be on a talk show? There is little remunerative reward -- usually only the air fare to the show, a hotel room and a per diem. Yet people risk humiliation, their faces, even their lives, to be on the air. The National Talk Show Guest Registry is a data bank of people who have offered up themselves and their oddities to talk shows around the country (and have paid $3 a month for the privilege). Here are excerpts from their entries in the registry (in italics) and some things they said during telephone interviews about their desire to be on air. SARAH BOXER A Disney Fanatic George Reiger Jr. has permanently tattooed his body with Disney characters from Mickey Mouse to Snow White. Every room in his home is ""Disney themed,"" using over 4,500 Disney-related items. He has visited Disney World 72 times and Disneyland 52 times. I want to go on television for the exposure and to show the world my tattoos. I have 415 Disney tattoos, and I can show all but 20 of them. I'm Disney's number one fan. It all started when I was watching the Mickey Mouse Club as a child. My first tattoo was 15 years ago. I was quiet about it for years. I was going to Disneyland five or six times a year, to Disney World seven or eight times a year. Then I learned there was a guy in Florida who has 100 characters tattooed on his body. He was getting all the publicity, even though he lives by Disney World. I live 2000 miles away. This is my life, my religion. The movie ""Pocahontas"" comes out in June; I already have the tattoos. I'm going to be cremated and my ashes will be scattered over the Seven Seas Lagoon. A Lost Dog's Guilty Master In 1988, Ronald Freed's daughter, Tina, was walking through the forest when she fell and hit her head, causing a severe concussion. Luckily, her dog, Spook, stayed with her. Tina was found after Mr. Freed heard Spook barking. On Oct. 19, 1992, Spook disappeared and Ronald blames himself for the dog's disappearance: ""That dog SAVED my daughter's life. I sold him down the river."" I want to be on a talk show because I have a dog who's been missing for 30 months. It's the only way I can get national coverage. I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find my dog. I can't get a billboard with his picture on it. I've got millions of leads but never the right one. I should have hired cops, the way you'd do for a missing child. When you watch the morons on talk shows, you see people who cheat on their mother's lawyer's boyfriend. I am a college graduate and a rabid antivivisectionist. I'm putting together a mini-book titled ""Test America's Prisoner's, Not Animals."" If I got on a talk show and nobody called, maybe I could put this thing behind me. I have to take care of my two cats. I can't commit suicide. An Imaginary Mother Patty McNeil (a pseudonym) had an extramarital affair. The affair ended with the man ""tossing her aside like trash."" When she discovered that she was pregnant, the ex-lover demanded that she have an abortion. She refused but then ended up miscarrying. ""I never told him of the miscarriage. In fact, I told him that I delivered a sweet baby girl that had 'his eyes' for no other reason but to destroy his peace of mind."" You see a talk show and think: How can they talk about that awful stuff? But I suffered for a long time in silence. And talk is healing. You just purge it. You can't go into a supermarket and say, ""I was raped by my brother."" In supermarkets people talk about diapers. But talk shows are for talking about painful or bizarre things. You're anonymous there. There are things I would say on television that I wouldn't say to my therapist. I was on once to talk about my affair with a younger man, and nobody knew I was on. I didn't tell anybody -- just one friend, my sister and my son. If my mother saw it, she'd think she was having D.T.'s. This time, if the story about my imaginary child comes out, the man will want to kill me. I would have to wear a wig or something. But he's a man; he's not going to be at home watching. He's got a job. An Elvis With Implants Mike Memphis has been an Elvis impersonator for 13 years (since he was 16 years old). In 1994, Mike underwent 7 facial operations to look more like ""the King,"" including cheek implants, a lower lip implant, a chin implant and liposuction of the neck and chin. I'm an entertainer and there's one thing you can expect from being on a talk show: that you'll have another line for your resume. I have before-and-after pictures of myself and pictures of myself on the operating table. I have only one regret -- that I didn't do it earlier. But I'm not a psychopath. I'm using this as a stepping stone to other acting jobs. I could downplay the look, shave the sideburns, let the black dye wash out. I don't want to be Elvis when I'm 40. Multiple Personality Lori Crocker, R.N., is a psychiatric nurse who was assisting therapists in treating people suffering from multiple personality disorders when she suddenly realized that ""someone inside"" was talking to her as well. ""For the next year and a half,"" she says, ""I worked intensely with a therapist, uncovering 45 different alters."" God has helped me and it's time to give something back. I want to tell everyone that there are a lot more people with multiple personality disorders than they recognize. People associate hearing voices with being crazy. But it may be people inside talking. Becoming a multiple personality is a coping skill, and not everybody has the ability to do this. Something very bad has to have happened. My opinion is that there has been satanic involvement in 80 percent of the cases. Both of my kids went through stuff like that -- satanism, orgies, drugs. The satanic cults have people, men, who get females pregnant, so they can take the children and sacrifice them. Or they will take infants in deep dark boxes and put them in the ground -- with bugs and stuff. I saw these rituals in flashbacks of my alters as they came out to heal. The alters are like best friends. They've taken on the pain for me. I know what I have been through. I know that if people attack, it's only out of fear. A Man With Long Second Toes Ron Chappell has researched historical references and myths about longer second toes for over 10 years. He avidly collects paraphernalia that make reference to the giftedness of people with this special trait. I'm trying to get some publicity for research I've done on second toes. The major works of art, pretty much all of your Italian artwork, and all your gods and goddesses have that toe. I put all the information together so people can feel good about themselves, so they can identify with Marilyn Monroe, Baryshnikov, the Greek gods and goddesses. Most people think a big second toe means something special -- that it means you're smarter, that you'll live longer or that you're royalty. I think it definitely connects us with fertility, with the earth and the gods. The earth gives off electromagnetic energy. Our toes are our antennas; the longer second toe enables people to draw in more energy. When I was little I asked my mother: How come my second toes are longer? She said I was special.

From Seventeen, I moved on to Glamour, Mademoiselle, and then, as a sophomore in high school, I graduated to Vogue, in which the models weren't girls but women -- full-fledged citizens of cocktail parties and candlelit dinners for two. I scrutinized pictures of expensive clothes and pored over descriptions of some new mascara formula.

us,DIARY,"CONGRESS Budget-Cutters on the March Like it or not, Congress is inching steadily closer to dismantling Government as we know it. When House and Senate budget panels approved plans last week to balance the budget in seven years, the main sticking point was tax cuts -- the House wants $350 billion in cuts, the Senate none. They'll have to hash that out if, as expected, the bills pass this week. But then would come the messy part: figuring out specific cuts, not just simple numbers. How bad will the pain be? It's a numbers game. Some estimates put it at 7 percent or more from overall spending. But since Social Security and the military are off limits, cuts in things like education and the environment could be more like 30 percent. That's pain. COMMUNICATIONS MCI Joins Murdoch's Team Rupert Murdoch is on a roll. He just got the F.C.C. off his back on the thorny issue of foreign ownership of American TV stations. Then last week MCI said it would invest up to $2 billion in his News Corporation. The new partners' talk was full of grand global plans, of ""synergies"" -- and these two companies do indeed have a history of rattling all sorts of cages. But analysts saw a coup for Mr. Murdoch, questioning those vaunted synergies. After all, even if MCI eventually owns 13.5 percent of the company, the deal gives it no true voting power. And on the news, MCI's stock fell and the News Corporation's rose. So what's in it for MCI? Clearly, a possibility of fulfilling global dreams that go beyond long distance. REAL ESTATE What Went Bankrupt? It really comes down to two questions: 1) Come on, how could Rockefeller Center possibly be bankrupt? 2) Oh, does it really matter? To tackle No. 2 first, it was best summed up by a candy-store worker, right in the belly of the Midtown beast, who responded to a query about last week's Chapter 11 filing this way: ""Truthfully, sir, I have no idea what you're talking about."" As for No. 1, let's see: The family took out a huge mortgage. A Japanese company bought 80 percent of the center, paying too much. Rents fell when they were supposed to rise. And somehow, with all sorts of overlapping companies called Rockefeller Group, Rockefeller Center Properties, RCP Associates, things just stopped adding up. Is that clear now? WORK FORCE Women Pay Their Way Not long ago, if a woman had a job, it was often for little extras -- not the meat of a family budget. Well, in case you hadn't noticed, that world is long gone. If any doubts persisted, they were dispelled by a survey released last week that showed that more than half of employed women provided at least half of their household income. The study ""challenges the persistent notion that women's earnings are supplemental,"" said Arlene Johnson of the Families and Work Institute, co-sponsor of the survey. Not that all women want to be breadwinners -- 31 percent said that if money were abundant, they'd be tending to their families, while just 21 percent of men stated that preference. And some women, of course, have no choice -- the men aren't around. MARKETS Emerging Is as Emerging Does It was a noble idea, fairly oozing with pioneer spirit. Three years ago the American Stock Exchange decided to give a break to some little companies that didn't quite fit the mold but that, it hoped, had boundless futures. Last week the Amex ended the experiment, called the Emerging Company Marketplace, saying no new companies would be added. Not only did some of the companies fail to emerge, but nearly a quarter of them are now worthless. The tales behind the companies range from the blatant (one's largest shareholder was a convicted arsonist) to the bizarre (another's chairman had been sued by the S.E.C., but had since had a sex-change operation). But the lesson seemed to be that there is, after all, a reason for an exchange to have rigorous rules for membership. Or simply this: Emerge first, then apply. ANNUAL REPORTS The Pepsi Investor Next Door Pity the designers of annual reports. They're duty-bound to put heavy machinery or cereal boxes on the covers -- but don't want to make them so dull-looking that stockholders will quickly toss them. Why, they must wonder occasionally, can't they put some glamorous model on the cover? No, what a silly idea, they surely say, as they switch off their daydreams and try to think good thoughts about tractors. But apparently someone at Pepsi had that very daydream -- and forgot to wake up. And so it is that Pepsi's just-released annual report could easily be mistaken for Glamour or Vogue -- there's Cindy Crawford gazing seductively out at you -- without a soda can in sight. The cover line: ""A typical investor looks us over."" Sure, Pepsi, sure. RIVALRIES From Cold War to Cola War Who says there are no superpower rivalries left? Even with the cold war over, Coke and Pepsi are still engaged in their mythic battle for the gullets of the masses. And even if Pepsi scored one for having the sexiest annual report, Coke caught the Presidential eye in Russia last week. Mr. Clinton, picking an American investment to publicize by bestowing a visit, chose a Coke plant near Moscow. There was a reasonable political explanation: Coke owns its Russian plant, while Pepsi's is a joint venture. But could it be because Coke has contributed more to Democrats lately? Or maybe Mr. Clinton, weary of vodka, craved a soda -- and figured the Coke plant was the nearest place to get a free one. It was, after all, right on the way to the airport. TRANSPORTATION You Could Always Walk In a single century, a historical speck, we've gotten used to the odd notion that if we want to be 30 miles away in half an hour, we should be able to do it -- no matter what damage is done to the environment. Now, as the world struggles to retain that luxury, someone had the bright idea of mandating a certain number of electric cars by 1998 -- a down payment on a pristine new world of travel. But is it possible? Practical hurdles still loom, of course -- but there's more: now comes a study saying that emissions from mining and smelting the lead needed for batteries might cause their own nasty threats to public health. But what of the argument that at least pollution would be shifted away from cities? Not so, said one toxicologist; ""lead particles can move long distances."" SOUVENIRS 23! 45! 23! Oh, Never Mind Does Michael Jordan realize he is tampering with some basic elements of our economic system? A basketball uniform is merely a piece of cloth, but with a star's number on it, it becomes a glowing -- and pricey -- symbol of all that's glamorous. So when he picked No. 45 for his comeback, a huge industry instantly took shape -- caps, T-shirts, banners, you name it. So when he abandoned that number last week for his old 23, he demolished the value of all that stuff. It was as if Calvin Klein decided to change his name to, say, Oliver North. All those people strutting around town in their Calvin underwear would feel, well, a bit cheated. No wonder the N.B.A. fined Jordan's team for the switch; Jordan upset a delicate balance of capitalism.",1995-05-14T05:00:00+0000
us,New & Noteworthy Paperbacks,"PARALLEL TIME: Growing Up in Black and White By Brent Staples. Avon, $11. The author, an editorial writer for The New York Times, recalls his experiences as the eldest son of a black family in Chester, Pa., a town where obvious forms of segregation had vanished but more subtle divisions between the races were strong. His memoir explores those boundaries and the one between himself and his brother Blake, a drug dealer who died violently. ""It is a complex portrait of a worldly education, written at times with affection, at times with a sting,"" Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote here last year. A BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER By Joan Didion. Vintage International, $12. Charlotte Douglas, a woman with no understanding of revolutions, seeks her 18-year-old daughter, who is trying to foment one. After participating in a bombing and a hijacking, the young woman is believed to be in Boca Grande, a fictional Central American country. Grace Strasser-Mendana, another American expatriate, tells their story. In 1977 our reviewer, Joyce Carol Oates, said that Joan Didion ""has been an articulate witness to the most stubborn and intractable truths of our time, a memorable voice, partly eulogistic, partly despairing; always in control."" Vintage has also brought another of Ms. Didion's novels back into print: DEMOCRACY ($12), in which the author herself is a character. She narrates the drama of the Victor family, whose life in 1975 involves both politics and murder. The author ""is wonderful not only at hearing her characters but at naming them,"" Mary McCarthy said in the Book Review in 1984. LISTENING By Hannah Merker. Harper Perennial, $12. More than two decades ago, the author went skiing for the first time -- an event that marked the last time she would ever hear completely. Her book assesses the importance of sound and demonstrates how she adjusted to the silence imposed by a devastating accident. Writing in these pages last year, Lou Ann Walker said: ""We feel her loss. . . . But we are receptive to the lessons of listening she is teaching us."" Also reissued is TRAIN GO SORRY: Inside a Deaf World, (Vintage, $13). The author, Leah Hager Cohen, is the daughter of the superintendent of the Lexington School for the Deaf in Queens. A hearing child of hearing parents, she describes her life within a culture she could never really be part of. In 1994 our reviewer, Russ Rymer, said the book often reads ""like a love story -- as intimate, tender and troubling a love story as any you're likely to find."" THE WAY WE KNOW IN DREAMS: Stories By Gordon Weaver. University of Missouri, $14.95. Many of the men in this collection are disappointed middle-aged souls who feel powerless to change their fates -- as well they might, since two of the other characters are God and Satan. The result is ""inspired, clever and unexpected fiction,"" Chris Bohjalian wrote here last year. The men in the stories in WANTING ONLY TO BE HEARD, by Jack Driscoll (University of Massachusetts, $12.95), are even more desperate. Frequently hunters and fishermen, often bereft of female company, they live close to nature -- and to violence. In 1993 Jonis Agee said in the Book Review that ""Jack Driscoll's poetic language gives them a stature that makes their struggle meaningful, tragic and universal."" MOTHERLESS DAUGHTERS: The Legacy of Loss By Hope Edelman. Delta, $12.95. The author, who was 17 when her mother died, draws on clinical research and the experiences of more than 200 other women to analyze the impact of such a loss. Daughters in mourning, she explains, often feel that their own lives are incomplete. This is ""a moving and valuable treatment of a neglected subject,"" Nancy Caldwell Sorel said here last year. Maternal roles are also examined in THE MYTHS OF MOTHERHOOD: How Culture Reinvents the Good Mother, by Shari L. Thurer (Penguin, $12.95). Ranging from the Stone Age to today, this history reveals how society, not biology, has defined women's task as parents. In 1994 our reviewer, Rachel Billington, called it ""positive, sensible and readable."" ACTS OF LOVE By Emily Listfield. Penguin, $10.95. It's a familiar scenario: a gun goes off in a suburban living room, and a marital quarrel ends in death. The question this novel poses is whether Ted Waring deliberately or accidentally killed his estranged wife. The author's ""chilling meditation . . . is a sobering reminder that some puzzles are better left unsolved,"" Sarah Ferguson said in the Book Review last year. THE PROTEAN SELF: Human Resilience in an Age of Fragmentation By Robert Jay Lifton. Basic Books, $13. If a foolish consistency is indeed the hobgoblin of little minds, the author has found quite a few large-minded people. Their response to the dislocation of today's world is to become eminently adaptable. In 1994 our reviewer, Richard A. Shweder, found this ""a fascinating and appealing book because it is a near-perfect example of an intellectual stance that skeptics sometimes disparage."" Human resilience is also evident in THE AGELESS SELF: Sources of Meaning in Late Life, by Sharon R. Kaufman (University of Wisconsin, $11.95). A study of 60 elderly men and women, it demonstrates that strength of spirit and mind often compensates for bodily weakness. It is ""a book that no novelist or indeed any caring person with a fondness for human interiors could resist,"" Paul West said here in 1987. DROWN ALL THE DOGS By Thomas Adcock. Pocket Books, $5.50. Detective Neil Hockaday has to confront his own family's shadowy past when he returns to Ireland to find out about the father he never knew. Last year our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, called this mystery's dialogue ""lively and literate."" LAUREL GRAEBER",1995-05-14T05:00:00+0000

But about $350 billion of the package is earmarked to pay for an array of personal and business tax breaks the House approved last month. The Senate began debate on its version of the balanced-budget plan, which rejects any immediate tax cut, and a final vote is likely next week. MEDICARE CUTS -- Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said he had reluctantly concluded that Republicans would have to ""go it alone"" in cutting projected spending on Medicare because President Clinton and Democrats in Congress had refused to join the effort.

Following closely on three major precinct corruption scandals, several patrol car crashes and a rash of officer suicides, the incident underscores serious problems with police training, supervision and recruitment, police officials privately said. Mayor Giuliani called on the Washington police to carry out a full criminal investigation of the episode. [ Page 1. ] PROPOSAL TO RESHAPE SPECIAL EDUCATION An independent panel released a plan that recommends reorganizing New York City's special education system by taking large numbers of children who are currently segregated in separate ""special ed"" schools or classrooms and returning them to regular classrooms, where they would receive extra help. The draft report, presented to Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, offers a blueprint for remaking a system that now consumes more than 22 cents of every education dollar in New York City, includes one-quarter of all school employees and funnels a disproportionate number of black and Hispanic boys into segregated classrooms. [ 1. ] NEW YORK CITY COURT BACKS HOLDING IMMIGRANTS Two days after a Federal court in Pennsylvania ruled the immigration service had wrongly held the passengers of a freighter, the Golden Venture, for nearly two years, an appellate court in Manhattan decided that the Government was within its rights not only to detain the smuggled immigrants, but also to deny them political asylum based on their opposition to China's policy of restricting families to one child. [ 27. ] SHOOTING BY OFFICERS CALLED JUSTIFIED Police officers acted properly during the pursuit of a gunman that ended in his death and that of a bystander in Rego Park, Queens, last December, the Queens District Attorney said. The incident was the result of a landlord-tenant dispute in which the gunman shot and killed a husband and wife who were planning to evict him from a room in their house. [ 27. ] POLICE MAY CONTROL SCHOOL GUARDS Reviving a campaign pledge to reduce school violence, Mayor Giuliani said he wants to put the system's 3,000 school safety officers under the control of the Police Department. He made his remarks after he learned of a report showing an increase in incidents of violence and other problems in the schools. [ 26. ] REGION A TAKEOVER NEARS IN NEWARK New Jersey's Commissioner of Education said the state might start taking over the long-troubled Newark school system as early as July. The Commissioner said the main reason was the poor test results of Newark students, even after a decade of state monitoring. He noted that only one-quarter of high school seniors in one recent year had passed the tests required to graduate.

Hine photographed children shucking oysters, picking beans, making cigars and working in the mines; his work is credited with influencing the passage of child labor laws. Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans continued this tradition of socially concerned photography. Nancy Buirski, a picture editor at The New York Times, has claimed this lineage for her photographs in EARTH ANGELS: Migrant Children in America (Pomegranate Artbooks, cloth, $35; paper, $24.95). Although migrant families now have access to many social services, they still do not sit at the tables they serve. Ms. Buirski photographed migrant workers in five states: New York, Texas, Florida, Washington and California. Her color images depict children weeding, hoeing, playing, sleeping, splendid in party clothes. Their housing is crowded and grubby, but Ms. Buirski conveys their joy and mischief as well as their fatigue and uncertainty. Her aim is to capture the children's spirit in the face of adversity, but she lacks the rigorous vision of earlier documentary photographers. ROSEMARY RANCK",1995-05-21T05:00:00+0000
us,CITIES: Changing the Colors of Rome,"Rome's alleys and piazzas are often savored for their warm earth tones -- ocher, terra cotta, burnt sienna. The real colors, architectural historians have found, were much cooler. By studying early cityscapes and paint chips from buildings, they find that when much of the current city was built, in the 16th and 17th centuries, the dominant colors were off-whites, icy blues, pale yellows, pinks and grays. In the 19th century, the Piedmontese, who unified Italy, repainted many buildings a yellow ocher. In the 20th century, the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini favored earth tones. The time is right, the historians say, to change back, and the most striking example of restoration is probably Villa Medici on the Pincio, which now houses the French Academy. Last year, restorers returned the graceful balustraded garden terraces (shown above, before and after) to their original 16th-century eggshell tones. The restorers were ready then to start on the villa itself. But many Romans detest the restored pastels for robbing the city of warmth. An expert commission, appointed to decide on the villa's color, is still talking. A decision is hoped for by November.",1995-05-21T05:00:00+0000

Like the first, it came in the morning mail addressed to him at the Arthur K. Watson computer sciences building at Yale University. It found the 40-year-old professor of computer science at an interesting time in his career. Gelernter has been consistently, almost arrogantly, extending the breadth of his writings beyond the technical, veering toward sociology, psychology, even Biblical studies. He is bracing now for the reaction to his latest book, ""1939,"" a study of that year's New York World's Fair, to be published next month. Gelernter thinks that event was important in part because it embodied what was then an overwhelmingly optimistic view of technology and the future. ""In 1939,"" he writes, ""technology was not remote and esoteric . . . its achievements were heroic."" In contrast, Gelernter believes, it is now common to consider technology as an enemy.

That day four of us trooped from the southern tip of Manhattan to the stone fortress on the corner of Wall and Broad with an indifference that called to mind a middle-school field trip to a Civil War museum, except there was no one to punish you when you shoved your bubble gum down the musket barrel. After a brief tour -- ""there is where they put the bomb; here is where they put the TV cameras"" -- our ancient guide, who handled Salomon's business on the Exchange, let slip what we all suspected: he made no real money. No one he knew on Wall Street made real money -- at least not compared with the average Salomon bond trader. All at once eight eyes sought the nearest exit. And a few minutes later, with what I took to be touching generosity but now see as an understandable desire to be rid of us, our guide left us in a local bar with an open tab and a few hours to kill.

us,DIARY,"BANKRUPTCIES Implant Mess: What Is Real? Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection last week, swamped by lawsuits over breast implants. But the odd thing about this multibillion-dollar mess is that there is considerable doubt about whether the implants are actually harmful. Scientific doubt, that is. The legal system seems convinced that implants cause a variety of maladies, but a number of scientific studies balk at that -- finding that the diseases are real, but the cause not established. The bankruptcy is real, though, halting all new lawsuits and delaying settlement of existing ones -- for at least two years and probably longer. And the company's owners, Dow Chemical and Corning, will no doubt see their investments go to women's claims. TOBACCO Smoke, but Fire Next Year That huge class-action suit against the tobacco companies will have to wait. A big group of lawyers in New Orleans was going full speed ahead in its attempt to show, among other things, that cigarette makers concealed knowledge that nicotine is addictive. And they had plans to notify -- through nationwide ads -- up to 90 million smokers that they were part of the class. But last week the judge allowed an appeal now -- on whether the class should be certified. The bad news for the lawyers is that this means a delay of six months to a year -- just when they had their engines running. But one lawyer saw a silver lining -- that they could get the certification question cleared up now, before spending vast sums on the case. PUBLISHING Words, Words, Words for Sale The Encyclopaedia Britannica was first published in 1768, before the existence of the United States -- or, yes, even Microsoft -- and is still going. But not surprisingly -- at a time when many homes have more computers than books -- sales are dropping, from 117,000 sets in 1990 to 51,000 last year. Then again, look at it this way: even in the age of the CD-ROM, fully 51,000 people and libraries shelled out $1,500 for the 32 volumes of this ultimate reference work. But that's not enough, and Britannica is losing money -- and last week its owner, a private trust called the William Benton Foundation, put it up for sale. And as befits the age, the potential buyers included not just publishers like Simon & Schuster but, you guessed it, Microsoft. TRADE WARS Tyrannosaurus Lexus? A world without Lexuses (Lexi?) would be a sorry place indeed. Some people would probably have to settle for lapel buttons saying, ""I'm so loaded I could spend $50,000 for a mere car."" But just such a world loomed as a possibility last week as the Administration, making its move in some convoluted political game, plunked a 100 percent tariff on Japan's luxury cars. It's effective for cars arriving now, but won't be applied till late June -- allowing time for a settlement, or for this saber-rattling to pass. But if it sticks, that'll be it for new Lexuses, Infinitis and the like -- $30,000 to $50,000 is one thing, but $50,000 to $80,000? To the Mercedes dealer, Jeeves. And those of you scooping up ""bargain"" Lexuses now may find dealers few and far between. BANKING Musical Bank Chairs Anyone inclined to brand loyalty must have a hard time when it comes to banks. These days, the ""venerable"" banks are the ones that haven't changed their name or ownership in, say, five years. Until 1988, Bowery Savings was a New York fixture, but then it was bought by H.F. Ahmanson, its branches turned into Home Savings offices. But then last week Greenpoint bought 60 Home Savings outlets -- mostly old Bowery branches. It paid dearly -- $660 million -- but Greenpoint used to be a mutual savings bank, and after going public it had a lot of money to spend. Now it has spent it -- and old Bowery customers face a new identity crisis. AUTOS Chrysler Can Spare a Dime Chrysler tossed Kirk Kerkorian a bone last week, raising its dividend from 40 cents to 50 at its annual meeting -- after saying in December that there would be no increases this year. Not that it was admitting being swayed by Mr. Kerkorian's effort to buy the company, and his push for a far bigger dividend increase. ""That was not the dominant issue at all,"" said Robert Eaton, the chairman. Now, Mr. Eaton said, he simply hoped the ""disruptive force"" of Mr. Kerkorian's nudging just ""goes away."" And Chrysler's tough stance seems to have worked, for no other big shareholders rallied to Mr. Kerkorian's cause, apparently a vote of confidence in Chrysler's cautious long-term plan. And the stock has settled at around $42, above the $39 before the bid but well below the $55 Mr. Kerkorian offered. STOCK MARKET Dow Drops 82; Life Goes On So why did the Dow industrials plunge 82 points on Thursday, the year's biggest drop? You could trot out the usual suspects -- trade deficits, bond prices, an economy too strong or too weak (pick one). Or you could just look at the numbers: the Dow had risen 750 since November, traders with a fear of heights were glancing warily about to see who'd jump first, and on Thursday some jumped. And remember: 82 points ain't what it used to be. In the days of an 800 Dow, that would have been a scary 10 percent. At today's lofty levels, this drop doesn't even weigh in at 2 percent. So there's a good chance the world is not coming to an end. CONGRESS Tame the Deficit or Bust Balancing the budget has become almost a religious crusade for Republicans, with the House last week charging ahead and voting a specific plan to break even by 2002. Specific, that is, except for things like how they'll save $280 billion on Medicare. If the Senate passes its own cuts this week, they'll have to work out the differences -- mainly that $350 billion House tax cut. But then comes a likely veto -- the House vote, 238 to 193, is not veto-proof. . . . Senate budget-cutters, meanwhile, want to do away with taxpayer-financed elections, which were created as a post-Watergate reform, saying Government should stay out of politics. What did the Democrats think? It would create an ""obscene race for dollars,"" said Senator Christopher Dodd. FUGITIVES How to Steal a Billion It's hard to steal billions of dollars -- because, well, most people don't leave billions of dollars lying around waiting to be stolen. But a German developer named Jurgen Schneider is accused of doing just that -- a year ago, his vast real estate empire collapsed and he disappeared, leaving $5 billion in debts. And last week -- after continuing reports that put him in places like Switzerland and Iran -- he was arrested in Hollywood, Fla., trying hard to look like your basic retiree. Does he have something stashed away? Who knows. But the real question is, How could German banks have let this happen? They may be asked that more often now that Mr. Schneider's dream vacation is over. HOLLYWOOD All Eyes on Mr. Ovitz One thing is certain: Michael Ovitz will continue to call a lot of shots in Hollywood. The only question: where he'll be sitting. There was talk last week that he might leave the Creative Artists Agency, which practically owns Hollywood, to head MCA, which Seagram just bought. But the math gets tricky: Creative Artists could be worth $400 million now, and Mr. Ovitz probably owns half of it, but if he leaves and takes some top agents with him, it'll look a lot less valuable. In short, he's an awfully valuable man, so one wonders whether Seagram -- and its shareholders -- are ready to pay what it will take to get him.",1995-05-21T05:00:00+0000

Like the first, it came in the morning mail addressed to him at the Arthur K. Watson computer sciences building at Yale University. It found the 40-year-old professor of computer science at an interesting time in his career. Gelernter has been consistently, almost arrogantly, extending the breadth of his writings beyond the technical, veering toward sociology, psychology, even Biblical studies. He is bracing now for the reaction to his latest book, ""1939,"" a study of that year's New York World's Fair, to be published next month. Gelernter thinks that event was important in part because it embodied what was then an overwhelmingly optimistic view of technology and the future. ""In 1939,"" he writes, ""technology was not remote and esoteric . . . its achievements were heroic."" In contrast, Gelernter believes, it is now common to consider technology as an enemy.

Ostriches Are Good For: a) hats b) shoes c) fillets","WHAT: Ostrich meat, the plat du jour for those in search of exotic foods. Although the flightless birds have been raised in South Africa since the mid-1800's (first for feathers and, more recently, leather), it is only within the last 15 years that ostrich meat has come to be considered a delicacy.DOES THAT COME WITH A SALAD? Ostrich meat currently commands high prices. Ostrich Vision, a wholesaler in Roslyn, L.I., sells ostrich meat for $22 a pound. This price has limited ostrich to high-end restaurants. The Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas serves ""Pan Roasted Ostrich Fillet"" for $40, while David Waltuck, the executive chef at Chanterelle in New York, includes ostrich as part of his $68 prix-fixe dinner. The Assembly, a steakhouse in Rockefeller Center, recently added ostrich to its menu. Other local chefs who serve ostrich are Daniel Van Etten at Girasole, Nicholas Rabalais at Adrienne and Todd Jacobs at Terra Mar in Westhampton, L.I.OSTRICH CONVENTION: Last Monday, the New York chapter of the American Culinary Federation held an ostrich dinner at the Peninsula Hotel prepared by Randall Warder, the chef de cuisine at the Mansion on Turtle Creek. More than 100 chefs attended. Does this mean that ostrich will become a staple in local restaurants? Gray Kunz, the chef at Lespinasse, says maybe. ""Five years ago, people wouldn't touch rabbit or venison, but now every chef in the city has these animals on their menu,"" he said. ""I think it could be the same with ostrich. It tastes fantastic. We just have to change the customer's mind-set.""LEAN CUISINE: Although ostrich meat has a color, texture and taste similar to that of beef, it is considerably leaner, prompting advocates to label it ""the healthy red meat."" According to the United States Department of Agriculture, a 3.5-ounce serving of broiled ostrich has 127 calories, 2.7 grams fat, 77 milligrams cholesterol and 26 grams protein, while an identical portion of broiled beef tenderloin has 229 calories, 12.49 grams fat, 85 milligrams cholesterol and 27 grams protein.RED OR WHITE WITH OSTRICH? ""This meat tastes like a cross between beef and lamb,"" said Tim Wilson, the wine buyer for Le Madri and Mad. 61. ""It's screaming for red wine. A white wouldn't stand up to this. You need a robust Burgundy like a Cote de Nuits or a Chianti Classico or even a Rhone, perhaps a Crozes-Hermitage.""STOCKS, BONDS AND OSTRICH BELLIES: A fertilized ostrich egg sells for about $850, a yearling pair can cost up to $14,000 and two mature breeding birds may go for $40,000, according to Ostrich Vision.SPARKS OSTRICH HOUSE? Some agricultural experts predict that ostrich may one day have a place at the American table. But Pat Cetta, a co-owner of Sparks Steak House, refuses to jump on the ostrich bandwagon. ""I remember when everyone thought buffalo was going to replace beef,"" he said. ""I suspect ostrich is the same kind of thing. Bottom line: people will still eat steak.

Elizabeth Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar (in five pictures left and below) was observed over the last two months wearing exclusively black and white Chanel ready-to-wear jackets, always with black knee-length skirts, stockings and shoes. Her low-key style suggests a starting point for women who are turned off by fashion extremes. The Tilberis style stripped of jewelry gets right to the essential ingredient, the cut and fit of a jacket as the best investment. The white and black trimmed jacket (far left top) worn under a beige rain parka doubled as a dinner jacket (below) with the refined addition of a string of pearls in the form of a belt from the Chanel couture.

Instead of a peaceful old age, he and his sister find mysterious events from their youth reasserting themselves. These characters ""register just right in their idiosyncrasies, and . . . we like just reading about their movements through the day,"" Sven Birkerts said here last year. THE SILENT WOMAN: Sylvia Plath & Ted Hughes By Janet Malcolm. Vintage, $12. They are among the most famous -- and notorious -- of literary couples. Sylvia Plath was silenced by her own hand when she committed suicide in 1963, but in the years since, many writers have attempted to speak for her, which has usually meant speaking against her husband. Janet Malcolm takes the opposite approach while also scrutinizing the nature and practice of biography. In 1994 our reviewer, Caryn James, said: ""She lucidly unravels the Plath controversy. . . . Most important, she raises indispensable, uncomfortable issues that journalists and biographers should be brave enough to face."" THANK YOU FOR SMOKING By Christopher Buckley. Harper Perennial, $12. Who could be a more convincing antihero for the 90's than a tobacco lobbyist? Nick Naylor doesn't exactly love his work, but hey, it pays the mortgage. ""This hilarious novel . . . suggests that by our craft we shall be known,"" Larry Gelbart said in these pages last year. A MAN ON THE MOON: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts By Andrew Chaikin. Penguin, $15.95. This book looks back on the excitement of the early years of the space program, capturing both the human personalities and the technological challenge. In 1994 our reviewer, Alex Roland, said the author ""recounts in loving detail the standard Apollo epic,"" while also rendering the science ""interesting and understandable."" Two of the astronauts have their own say in MOONSHOT: The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon, by Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton (Turner, $12.95). In the same review Mr. Roland found their narrative a ""swashbuckling"" one, told by ""true believers."" THE END OF THE HUNT By Thomas Flanagan. Warner, $6.99. The last volume in the author's trilogy about Ireland takes place in the years between the Easter Rebellion and the Irish Civil War. Through his characters, Mr. Flanagan illustrates the conflict between idealistic spirit and political necessity. More than ""a well-told tale,"" it is ""a significant contribution to . . . historical interpretation,"" Terence Brown said here last year. RUSSIA UNDER THE BOLSHEVIK REGIME By Richard Pipes. Vintage, $18. A historian analyzes the fruits of 1917, concluding that the revolution was not, in fact, a proletarian uprising and that the totalitarian nature of the Soviet state was directly inherited from its czarist predecessor. In 1994 our reviewer, Marshall D. Shulman, found this ""a solid work of historical scholarship"" whose prose is ""graceful and literate."" The same publisher has also reissued GENERATIONS OF WINTER, by Vassily Aksyonov, translated by John Glad and Christopher Morris ($13). A fictional look at the dark era of Stalinism, it follows the fortunes of a physician and his children as they are pulled in different directions by the forces of history. The novel ""captures the anxiety, the Kafkaesque pointlessness of state cruelty, with ferocious artistry,"" Jay Parini said in the Book Review in 1994. More recent events are the subject of THE RISE OF RUSSIA AND THE FALL OF THE SOVIET EMPIRE, by John B. Dunlop (Princeton University, $16.95), which examines the struggle to define the nation's new identity. It includes ""a close and provocative look at the August 1991 coup,"" our reviewer, Celestine Bohlen, wrote in 1993. According to the author, the plot came close to succeeding. WHITE MAN'S GRAVE By Richard Dooling. Picador USA, $13. When Michael Killigan, a Peace Corps volunteer, vanishes into the wilds of Sierra Leone, his ruthless father and his trusting best friend go in after him. Through their humorous adventures in the heart of darkness, the author is ""able to revitalize the traditional comic novel of colonialism,"" Gary Krist said here last year. DIPLOMACY By Henry Kissinger. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $17.50. In 1994 our reviewer, Ernest R. May, found this book Machiavellian both in its approach to power and in its tendency to reveal more about the author's personality than about history. Above all, it shows how individuals can mold the future through their manipulation of events. ""The strength of 'Diplomacy' lies in its marriage of vision and shrewdness,"" Mr. May said. TEN TALES TALL & TRUE By Alasdair Gray. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11. This collection employs a range of styles and devices to show how people fulfill the scripts they've written for their lives -- usually by choosing someone to bully or be bullied by. It's ""a very accessible introduction to a body of work that deserves (and rewards) serious consideration,"" Ron Loewinsohn said here last year. REINVENTING EDUCATION: Entrepreneurship in America's Public Schools By Louis V. Gerstner Jr., Roger D. Semerad, Denis Philip Doyle and William B. Johnston. Plume, $11.95.

The authors' model is the Next Century Schools Program, developed by the RJR Nabisco Foundation. Last year one critic called it ""an eloquent plea for change.""

It seems to me that the ""f-word"" is used so often in ordinary conversation that the battering and abuse of women seems routine and ordinary.

us,New & Noteworthy Paperbacks,"SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND By Dennis McFarland. Ivy, $6.99. Francis Brimm, a retired news photographer, moves back to the Florida town of his childhood. Instead of a peaceful old age, he and his sister find mysterious events from their youth reasserting themselves. These characters ""register just right in their idiosyncrasies, and . . . we like just reading about their movements through the day,"" Sven Birkerts said here last year. THE SILENT WOMAN: Sylvia Plath & Ted Hughes By Janet Malcolm. Vintage, $12. They are among the most famous -- and notorious -- of literary couples. Sylvia Plath was silenced by her own hand when she committed suicide in 1963, but in the years since, many writers have attempted to speak for her, which has usually meant speaking against her husband. Janet Malcolm takes the opposite approach while also scrutinizing the nature and practice of biography. In 1994 our reviewer, Caryn James, said: ""She lucidly unravels the Plath controversy. . . . Most important, she raises indispensable, uncomfortable issues that journalists and biographers should be brave enough to face."" THANK YOU FOR SMOKING By Christopher Buckley. Harper Perennial, $12. Who could be a more convincing antihero for the 90's than a tobacco lobbyist? Nick Naylor doesn't exactly love his work, but hey, it pays the mortgage. ""This hilarious novel . . . suggests that by our craft we shall be known,"" Larry Gelbart said in these pages last year. A MAN ON THE MOON: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts By Andrew Chaikin. Penguin, $15.95. This book looks back on the excitement of the early years of the space program, capturing both the human personalities and the technological challenge. In 1994 our reviewer, Alex Roland, said the author ""recounts in loving detail the standard Apollo epic,"" while also rendering the science ""interesting and understandable."" Two of the astronauts have their own say in MOONSHOT: The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon, by Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton (Turner, $12.95). In the same review Mr. Roland found their narrative a ""swashbuckling"" one, told by ""true believers."" THE END OF THE HUNT By Thomas Flanagan. Warner, $6.99. The last volume in the author's trilogy about Ireland takes place in the years between the Easter Rebellion and the Irish Civil War. Through his characters, Mr. Flanagan illustrates the conflict between idealistic spirit and political necessity. More than ""a well-told tale,"" it is ""a significant contribution to . . . historical interpretation,"" Terence Brown said here last year. RUSSIA UNDER THE BOLSHEVIK REGIME By Richard Pipes. Vintage, $18. A historian analyzes the fruits of 1917, concluding that the revolution was not, in fact, a proletarian uprising and that the totalitarian nature of the Soviet state was directly inherited from its czarist predecessor. In 1994 our reviewer, Marshall D. Shulman, found this ""a solid work of historical scholarship"" whose prose is ""graceful and literate."" The same publisher has also reissued GENERATIONS OF WINTER, by Vassily Aksyonov, translated by John Glad and Christopher Morris ($13). A fictional look at the dark era of Stalinism, it follows the fortunes of a physician and his children as they are pulled in different directions by the forces of history. The novel ""captures the anxiety, the Kafkaesque pointlessness of state cruelty, with ferocious artistry,"" Jay Parini said in the Book Review in 1994. More recent events are the subject of THE RISE OF RUSSIA AND THE FALL OF THE SOVIET EMPIRE, by John B. Dunlop (Princeton University, $16.95), which examines the struggle to define the nation's new identity. It includes ""a close and provocative look at the August 1991 coup,"" our reviewer, Celestine Bohlen, wrote in 1993. According to the author, the plot came close to succeeding. WHITE MAN'S GRAVE By Richard Dooling. Picador USA, $13. When Michael Killigan, a Peace Corps volunteer, vanishes into the wilds of Sierra Leone, his ruthless father and his trusting best friend go in after him. Through their humorous adventures in the heart of darkness, the author is ""able to revitalize the traditional comic novel of colonialism,"" Gary Krist said here last year. DIPLOMACY By Henry Kissinger. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $17.50. In 1994 our reviewer, Ernest R. May, found this book Machiavellian both in its approach to power and in its tendency to reveal more about the author's personality than about history. Above all, it shows how individuals can mold the future through their manipulation of events. ""The strength of 'Diplomacy' lies in its marriage of vision and shrewdness,"" Mr. May said. TEN TALES TALL & TRUE By Alasdair Gray. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11. This collection employs a range of styles and devices to show how people fulfill the scripts they've written for their lives -- usually by choosing someone to bully or be bullied by. It's ""a very accessible introduction to a body of work that deserves (and rewards) serious consideration,"" Ron Loewinsohn said here last year. REINVENTING EDUCATION: Entrepreneurship in America's Public Schools By Louis V. Gerstner Jr., Roger D. Semerad, Denis Philip Doyle and William B. Johnston. Plume, $11.95. This book describes the ways the corporate sector can enrich education by awarding funds to innovative programs at public schools. The authors' model is the Next Century Schools Program, developed by the RJR Nabisco Foundation. Last year one critic called it ""an eloquent plea for change.""

Why is it O.K. to use excrement and fornicate and urinate but not their earthier forms? The answer, I suggest, goes back to the Norman Conquest, when the subjugated English people were taught by their captors that all aspects of their Anglo-Saxon culture -- including their language -- were inferior to those of their Latinized masters.

Almost overnight he would become the most celebrated black author in history; his slender volume supplanted a book of verses by the 18th-century slave poet Phillis Wheatley as the abolitionists' favorite emblem of black eloquence and intelligence. By the time Douglass died, 100 years ago this past February, he had long been accustomed to being the most famous Negro in the world. Years before, he had been dubbed ""the representative colored man of the United States"" -- a title that surely implied a confinement as well as a coronation, but that he wore proudly. The former slave, in so many ways the least representative of men, had become a great orator, abolitionist and -- in a phrase much in favor these days -- the first black ""public intellectual.""",1995-05-28T05:00:00+0000

Liberals and conservatives tend to blame each other's policies for increasing the number of Americans who live on the street. This analysis of numerous studies shows that each political group is partly right. "" 'The Homeless' is undoubtedly a major achievement,"" Brigitte Berger said here last year. A DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME By Anthony Powell. University of Chicago. Originally published as 12 separate novels depicting the unraveling of English society between the wars, this cycle has been reissued in four volumes (titled ""movements"") of three books each: ""A Question of Upbringing,"" ""A Buyer's Market"" and ""The Acceptance World"" ($17.95); ""At Lady Molly's,"" ""Casanova's Chinese Restaurant"" and ""The Kindly Ones"" ($17.95); ""The Valley of Bones,"" ""The Soldier's Art"" and ""The Military Philosophers"" ($17.95); and ""Books Do Furnish a Room,"" ""Temporary Kings"" and ""Hearing Secret Harmonies"" ($18.95). The narrator, Nicholas Jenkins, begins his long history, which partly reflects the life of the author, at Eton in 1921. By the end of the first trilogy, Nick and his school fellows are witnessing the Depression and approaching their 30's with little sense of resolve. In 1956 Aileen Pippett, reviewing ""The Acceptance World"" for The New York Times, called Anthony Powell ""a comic artist who knows exactly what he is doing."" In the second volume, a flashback to Nick's childhood at the brink of World War I is juxtaposed with an England steadily advancing toward World War II. ""Reading Powell is like living someone else's life for an hour or two, inextricably tangled with one's own,"" Elizabeth Janeway said here in 1962 in a review of ""The Kindly Ones."" The third volume ends with the Allied victory and more rearrangements in the central characters' lives. Writing in these pages in 1969, Ms. Janeway said Mr. Powell's fiction ""carries such human truth that one finds oneself feeling these folk must be real."" By the end of the series, Nick has become a writer and both he and the century are in their late 60's. In 1976 our reviewer of ""Hearing Secret Harmonies,"" Robert Towers, said Mr. Powell ""ranks with the radically different Doris Lessing . . . as the best of the novelists now writing British fiction."" MY OWN COUNTRY: A Doctor's Story By Abraham Verghese. Vintage, $13. In 1985 an Indian physician returns to the rural community of Johnson City, Tenn., where he had completed his residency. Feeling like an outsider himself, he begins to treat the ultimate outsiders: AIDS patients. Abraham Verghese's chronicle of his own arrival and that of the disease is ""beautifully written, fascinating and tragic,"" Perri Klass said here last year. THE RUSSIAN GIRL By Kingsley Amis. Penguin, $10.95. Richard Vaisey, a married scholar of Slavic literature living in London, has an imprudent affair with an emigre Russian poet whose verse is far less appealing than she is. In 1994 our reviewer, Christopher Buckley, found this novel ""brilliant, mordant and quite funny."" STORIES OF SCOTTSBORO By James Goodman. Vintage, $14. In 1931 nine black men were accused of raping two white women on an Alabama freight train. Despite a lack of evidence, two Supreme Court decisions and one woman's admission that she lied, the young men were repeatedly tried and convicted. This book is ""a superb retelling of this vital but largely forgotten episode,"" David M. Oshinsky said here last year. DI AND I By Peter Lefcourt. Harper Perennial, $12. Those who think Princess Diana is out of place in Britain's royal family might enjoy seeing her cast as an American manquee.

In 1994 our reviewer, Janet Maslin, praised ""Mr. Lefcourt's bright conversational style and his expert comic timing."" THE LATE SHIFT: Letterman, Leno, and the Network Battle for the Night By Bill Carter. Hyperion, $12.95. The author, who reports on television for The New York Times, takes the reader behind the scenes at NBC and CBS as they debate the futures of David Letterman, Jay Leno and late-night entertainment. The result is ""unfailingly balanced"" and ""filled with scoops and fresh details,"" Jon Katz said in the Book Review last year. APOSTLES OF LIGHT By Ellen Douglas. Banner/University Press of Mississippi, $16.95. Martha Clarke and Lucas Alexander are friends and lovers who happen to be in their 70's. Now back in print, this novel chronicles their attempt to free themselves from the grip of younger relatives who have turned Martha's house into a nursing home and their lives into a prison. The author ""achieves a revelation that is brilliant and disturbing,"" Martin Levin said here in 1973. THE FORCE By David Dorsey. Ballantine, $12.50 This book's title takes on many meanings as the author reveals the inner workings of the Xerox Corporation's Cleveland office. While salesmen bully customers in order to fill quotas, egos and spirits on both sides are broken. Last year our reviewer, Steven Levy, said Mr. Dorsey was ""imaginative and energetic . . . and some of his portraits are unforgettable.""

In TOKYO STYLE (Kyoto Shoin/RAM Publications, 2525 Michigan Avenue A-2, Santa Monica, Calif. 90404, $150), his loving photographic tribute to Japan's middle class, Kyoichi Tsuzuki shows us why. Most doors in Tokyo slide sideways; there is simply no room for an entryway that opens out. Mr. Tsuzuki's Tokyo is a town where the citizens live in such ordered clutter that one must keep one's fingernails short in order to enjoy some extra space. Mr. Tsuzuki spent two years documenting how people live in Tokyo's congested jumble of apartments, condominiums and (occasionally) single-family dwellings. Living in tiny quarters surrounded by all of your possessions is called the ""cockpit effect."" One of Mr. Tsuzuki's aims is to shatter old myths about Japan, and he succeeds. This is no world of peaceful Zenlike tranquillity. This is a world of stuff -- compact disks, comic books, computers and James Dean posters. And it's mostly American-inspired stuff; examples of traditional Japanese art are almost nowhere in evidence. ""Tokyo Style"" is an important photographic record of a way of life, but it's almost 400 pages of clutter, and ultimately, for an American, it's like viewing life lived in an M.R.I. machine. Mr. Tsuzuki predicts that the ""art of living well in small quarters might just prove the style of the future."" Not in the United States. Expansion, not contraction, is in our blood.

The German shot a final-round 71 for a nine-under-par total of 279, but needed to hole the final putt to avoid a playoff with Michael Campbell of New Zealand and Per-Ulrik Johansson of Sweden, who both finished on 280. ""It was a bit of a struggle, all day long it went back and forth,"" said Langer, who has won at least one title in Europe in each of the last 17 years. ""I never got as far ahead as I would have liked."" A bogey on the 13th by Langer set up a three-way tie among the German, Campbell and Johansson, with Mark Mouland of Wales and Andrew Sherborne one behind. But Langer holed a 15-foot putt on the short 14th to nose back in front. Both Mouland and Sherborne followed that with two bogeys to leave it a three-man race among Langer, Campbell and Johansson, who missed a 10-foot birdie putt at the 17th that would have given him a share of the lead. Langer then parred the final two holes to add to his 1987 and 1993 European PGA titles. (AP) SOFTBALL U.C.L.A. Beats Arizona for Championship Kelly Howard hit a two-run homer in the fifth inning yesterday to help U.C.L.A.'s softball team to a 4-2 victory over Arizona in the championship game of the Women's College World Series in Oklahoma City. Second-seeded U.C.L.A. won its eighth title and finished with a 50-6 record. Top-seeded Arizona (66-6) was seeking a second straight title. With the score 2-2, Howard homered off Carrie Dolan, who finished the season with a 33-2 record. U.C.L.A. pitcher Tanya Harding, the tournament's most valuable player, allowed eight hits in winning her fourth straight game in the series. She finished with a 17-1 record after joining the U.C.L.A. team in midseason. U.C.L.A. had defeated Arizona three times in four previous meetings this season.
