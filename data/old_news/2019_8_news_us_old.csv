us,Whats on TV Thursday: The Fate of the Furious and No One Saw a Thing,"THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS (2017) 7 p.m. on FX. Look out! Watch those people! That line is yelled midway through this movie by the actress Nathalie Emmanuel. At the time, her character  a hacktivist named Ramsey  is careening through the New York City air in the passenger seat of a Mercedes-Benz that has been equipped to shoot harpoon-like projectiles. So the line rings out as somewhat unexpectedly conscientious. The chase, which includes Dwayne Johnson plowing through fallen scaffolding in a beefed-up pickup and culminates with a circle of vehicles firing their harpoon-things into a muscle car driven by Vin Diesel, also encapsulates the way this series taken the gas-guzzling action it introduced nearly two decades ago and, with each iteration, pushed matters even further over the top. As the cars zig and the story line zags, these sequences grow baroque, defying reason and gravity, which have progressively come under siege in this franchise, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review of this most recent movie in the series for The New York Times.  To chart out that increasing aversion to the laws of physics yourself (or to prepare for the spinoff, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, out this weekend), see also FAST & FURIOUS (2009) and FAST FIVE (2011), airing at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Syfy.",2019-08-01T05:00:06+0000

Now, more than 40 years after his demise, he still hasnt gone away. Since the caudillos grand funeral, his remains have been interred at the Valley of the Fallen, a colossal memorial to the victims of the Spanish Civil War. Located 30 miles northwest of Madrid, the site consists of a vast basilica carved into the side of a granite mountain ridge and topped with a 500-foot stone cross, the tallest in the world. The regime claimed that the memorial, which houses the remains of some 34,000 Civil War dead, was intended to honor all who fell in the conflict, but this was gaslighting on a world-historical scale: Tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of them former Republican soldiers, labored for almost 20 years, between 1940 and 1959, to build what would eventually become their tormentors final resting place.",2019-08-01T09:00:02+0000

Gender reveals now precede or even replace the traditional baby shower, marking the occasion when the proud parents first learn the sex of their unborn guest of honor. Until recently, expectant parents received this information without much fanfare during a routine ultrasound, or perhaps by phone, when a doctor called to relay amniocentesis results. But around a decade ago, people started passing the results, under seal, to obliging bakers, who would bake pink or blue cakes, conceal them in neutral-colored frosting and then deliver them to be cut open at a party in front of friends and family. The reveal allowed the parents to be surprised in public, record the moment for posterity and share it across social platforms, signaling which aggregation of gender norms and limitations friends and family were to immediately begin heaping on the fetuss soft-skulled head.",2019-08-01T09:00:06+0000

Details materialize along a space-time continuum that feels intensely familiar yet disquietingly inexplicable.

A.O. Scott, who chose the film as a Critics Pick, wrote in his New York Times review: Weisz and Stone are both brilliantly witty and nimble, but Colmans performance is nothing short of sublime.

Some ice cream shops, including Four Winters, a new ice cream shop in Queens, use the same technique. A narrow storefront, this English import has an open kitchen, ingredients on view and seating. The ice cream is churned for each order: The results are ultrasmooth since the quick freeze keeps the ice crystals from forming. Basic flavors are chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar, sweet cream and vegan chocolate, with housemade mix-in options. Specialty varieties include Key lime pie, cereal crunch, vegan chocolate peanut butter and spectacular smores.

A series of evenly spaced bang-bang-bang sounds is much more likely to be a gun than the more sporadic ba-bang, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang of firecrackers. When sensors record a gunlike noise in, say, Cape Town or Chicago, software analyzes it for the sonic signatures of gunfire, and within seconds Beisner and his team listen to those audio files and look at those recorded waveforms at their office in Newark, Calif. Confirmed or suspected gunfire incidents are then reported to the local police.",2019-08-06T09:00:02+0000

Chicago had gone into tens of thousands of dollars of debt to make it.

The difference in this new restaurant is that the setting is not in the typical collection of stalls that usually sell street food. It stands alone with elegant velvet upholstery, marble tables and vintage touches. I wanted to cater to the Gramercy neighborhood and have a beautiful setting, a place where youd want to enjoy a bottle of wine, he said. Most restaurants with food from Singapore and Malaysia dont have that. Mr. Mehta is also an owner of Laut, a Malaysian restaurant nearby. Among the dishes at the new restaurant are curry puffs with potato, chicken and beef satays, crispy rice salad with vegetables, sweet and spicy chile crab, and Hainanese chicken with rice, chiles, garlic, shallots and soy sauce. Both the crab and the chicken are signature Singaporean dishes. As for that bottle of wine alongside, it may take a while: The restaurants alcohol license is not expected until the end of September.

Today, her collection includes pieces by Olympia Scarry, Wolfgang Tillmans and Piero Golia. Still, Getty says shes slow to acquire a work of art, and has a habit of visiting a piece multiple times over several months as she considers whether it might have place in her life. It doesnt go from the gallery to a storage facility. Not only do I have to love the work, but I have to live in its presence. Her clothing designs feel like a natural extension of this lifelong pursuit: for nearly every season of her five-year-old line, Getty has collaborated with an artist, intuitively picking an individual or movement that she wants to explore, and continuing the Getty family tradition of supporting the art community. One can see how shes made that legacy her own with the easy drape of a tangerine satin slip dress she conceived of after seeing Anna Ostoyas vibrant abstract paintings, say, or a ruched blouse that recalls the medical tubing in Hayden Dunhams installations. The process of working with an artist is very similar to my process of collecting, Getty says, With some, we might have met for a studio visit years before and had the opportunity to get to know each other over time.

THE NAME alone conjures images of absurd beauty: lobsters as dresses, a shoe as a hat, a particularly blinding shade of pink  and, of course, the fearless Italian modernist herself, Elsa Schiaparelli, who fled her conservative Italian family and con man of a husband to become one of fashions great iconoclasts. And so its only fitting that, for his debut as artistic director at the house, founded in 1927, Daniel Roseberry began with an origin story of his own. On the first day of the Paris couture shows this past July, the handsome 33-year-old sat down at a drafting table positioned in the middle of the runway inside the Pavillon Cambon, on a set meant to resemble the unheated Chinatown studio in New York where he created his first set of drawings for the brand last December. As the designer picked up his pencil, the lights went up and the models appeared, his sketches coming to life. There were no lip brooches or skeleton dresses; none of the totems Elsa made famous. Instead, Roseberry put forth his own proposal for fearlessness and surrealism, a celebration of both material craftsmanship and the female form. There were wild takes on suiting  a long navy captains coat trimmed at the sleeves and bias in flat gold leather bands resembling ruffled military ribbons worn over a delicate black-and-white lace bodysuit; a sharp barathea tuxedo jacket with 117 dangling crystal tassels, each affixed to the garment with a single scarlet-lacquered acrylic fingernail  and fantastical evening looks, some with bedazzled breast cups in ruby, diamond and sapphire hues that appeared to float on their own above heavy raw silk tulip skirts in chalky blue, sunflower yellow or acid green. For the finale, two gowns  one sheet white, the other a wild rose pink  pushed the idea of illusion further still, with supple silk taffeta that billowed out and above the models as if a gust of Marilyn Monroe-style wind had blown these confections toward the heavens and frozen them in that moment. Here, as in the original house of Schiaparelli, there was no place for self-doubt.",2019-08-12T09:00:08+0000

On a trip to Tangier, he came across Mre et Fils, a 2014 book of photographs by the now 61-year-old French artist Denis Dailleux, who lived in Egypt for many years. The images, at once erotic and tender, were of shirtless male Egyptian bodybuilders photographed with their mothers. Barthlemy, now 30, was so struck by them that he decided to go to Cairo himself, where he fell in love with the chaos of the city. He later moved there, into a spacious but faded 60s-era flat. One day, he visited a tiny stall south of Bab Zuwayla in Suq al-Khayamiya (Tentmakers Market), where an artisan named Tarek Abdelhay Hafez Abouelenin was hand-making a khayamiya  a vibrant quiltlike work featuring ornate appliqu patterns sewn onto a plain cotton canvas backing, a textile that has been used to cover the insides of tents at weddings, celebrations and funerals for over a millennium. Not surprisingly, the meticulous, time-consuming work is a dying art (most contemporary khayamiya are digitally printed), which made Abouelenins work all the more extraordinary. The two men agreed to collaborate on a different sort of khayamiya, one that would stray from traditional arabesque and calligraphic motifs  and would defy the Islamic taboo against both realistic representation and homoeroticism.",2019-08-16T16:21:54+0000

Now, Shes at Her Most Prolific.","Memory is as important to the work of Lynda Benglis as any of her artistic materials, including the globular polyurethane foam and wax for which she is perhaps best known. A pioneer of free-form sculpture who radically pushed the medium in the late 60s, she fills her biomorphic abstract works with the textures, sounds and images of the past. The artists coming exhibition at Pace Gallery in Palo Alto, Calif., which will open on August 21, includes work from four decades of her career, ranging from the curving tubular sparkle paper sculptures she has produced since 2013  brightly colored totems created from handmade paper draped around amorphous chicken-wire forms  to Eat Meat, a fleshy human-size blob of poured-polyurethane foam that Benglis first fashioned in 1969 and recast in aluminum in 2012. Each piece in the show is laced with memory. Recently, she recalled how her childhood trips from her hometown, Lake Charles, La., to the rocky Greek island of Kastellorizo, where her paternal grandparents once lived, informed her fascination with rugged textures, while she attributed her keen understanding of color, seen in works such as the hot-pink crystalline cast-polyurethane wall sculpture Swinburne Figure I (2009) and the shimmering multicolor paper-and-wire sculpture Flag Twister (2017), to watching birds as a girl with her grandfather in Mississippi.",2019-08-16T19:34:35+0000

I was thinking about how everyone has their role at these things  the curator, the collector, the artist, he said. But Party cast them all as elephants, titling the evening Dinner for 24 Elephants, providing diners with box stools on which hed painted elephant bodies and deflating a social ritual even as he elevated it to the level of art. Since then, Party, who is 39 and best known for his surrealist canvases done in soft pastels  from portraits of blue- and green-faced people with blank expressions to moody still lifes and landscapes (in one, a pair of trees stretch toward the moon like houseplants in want of the sun)  has made these unusual dinners an important part of his practice.
