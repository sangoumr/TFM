us,Film: 'Goodbye Girl' Full of Wisecracks,"IF ONE COULD ENTER the mind of Neil Simon, I have the feeling it would be like attending a convention of standup comedianseveryone busy topping everyone else, not really listening to anything that's being said except to identify the key word that will be the springboard into the next snappy retort, then the next and the next. Exhuasting without being much fun.Which is more or less the way I feel about Mr. Simon's newest work, the original screenplay for ""The Goodbye Girl,"" a movie that has the form of a romantic comedy but which is so relentlessly wisecracked that it finally has the very curious effect of seeming to be rude to its own characters.The people in ""The Goodbye Girl"" are very nice indeed, at least when we first meet them. They are a desperately cheerful young woman named Paula (Marsha Mason), a former Broadway hoofer who has a precocious 10-year-old daughter named Lucy (Quinn Cummings) and terrible luck with men, and Elliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss), a maniacally egocentric young Chicago actor who's come to New York to star in an Off Off Broadway production of ""Richard III.""Paula and Elliot loathe each other at first sight, for good reason. Paula's former lover has just sneaked off to Italy after having sublet to Elliot the apartment in which Paula and Lucy are living. Paula and Lucy refuse to give up the premises and Elliot refuses to acknowledge the right of their occupancy. After thus meeting cute, they compromise, deciding to share the flat while keeping their respective distances.""The Goodbye Girl,"" which opened yesterday at Loews Tower East Theater, may be the perfect American comedy for an age in which opportunism is not only an acceptable way of getting ahead in the world, but also a fashionable style of conversation, patterned largely, I suspect, on the manners of television talk-show guests who trample one another for the camera's attention. It's as if Zsa Zsa Gabor had become our Euphues.The courtship of Paula and Elliot is conducted mostly in terms of outrage, insult and misunderstanding. They don't talk to each otherthey compete for the last word. A lot of this, especially early in the film, is quite funny, but eventually it overtakes the characters and the situations so that, to keep the comedy moving, Mr. Simon himself appears to take over, making the characters say and do uncharacteristic things to get the laugh.Thus Paula, who has done her share of sleeping around must behave as if she were both jealous and morally outraged when Elliot brings home an actress-friend to rehearse one evening. We also are asked to believe that Elliot, who is essentially sane though ambitious, would go along with a ridiculously silly production of ""Richard III"" in which the title character is conceived as a Billy DeWolfe drag-queen.The thing that always confuses my reactions to Mr. Simon's more outrageous inventionssuch as the nutty ""Richard III"" production hereis that many of them are funny by themselves, but they don't fit easily together. Mr. Simon doesn't hesitate to sentimentalize little Lucy, played with eerie self-assurance by Miss Cummings, while stuffing her mouth with lines that would do justice to Groucho Marx.In certain situations, Mr. Simon's insults and wisecracks work naturally, as in ""The Sunshine Boys,"" about the two old vaudevillians who hate each other while being mutually dependent. It was also very comic in ""The Odd Couple,"" whose two heroes were really early sketches for the Sunshine Boys. His gift for parody was marvelously apparent in ""Murder by Death."" However, something essential seems to be missing when he attempts to write with feeling about men and women. As he views the war between the sexes, it's a contest of unisex gag writers.Herbert Ross, this year's ""hot"" director (what with ""The Turning Point"" already out and Mr. Simon's new play, ""Chapter Two,"" about to open), who is a man of wit and humane concerns, appears to have put his talent so totally in the service of the Simon script that I have no idea what his contributions to the movie may be.

Thus when Mr. Druckman's Chiaroscuro was given its premiere by the New York Philharmonic a few weeks ago, he went on record as saying that he wanted to reestablish the element of communication between composer and listener. Whether or not he succeeded in Chiaroscuro is a debatable point. There were those listeners who felt, to invert John Milton's phrase, that new priest was but old presbyter writ large. Mr. Druckman could not entirely break away from his roots of the 1960's. But the very fact that he has disavowed totally organized music and all its offshoots makes him still another of that large band unhappy with the music of the immediate past and very concerned about its future.",1977-12-04T05:00:00+0000

Rudolf Hartmann's luxuriously produced volume testifies to that on every page.

Essays on various aspects of their craft are provided by directors such as Gunther SchneiderSiemssen, JeanPierre Ponnelle and Hans Hartleb.

As a cold wind hit the hill, she stood holding her chin, looking back at the house in the distance. Her friends heard her mutter somethingthat she had snow in her boot, or needed the bathroom  some such lie. Then she began to run, looking down at the snow. She couldn't look at the house, it seemed too far away. She started to sweat and her legs went soft. She could not feel her feet, but they were running. Her heart was pounding, her face flushed. She began to pant. She felt as though she were coming apart, as if she had been running forever through the syrupy snow of a nightmare. Six Miltowns rattled against four Valiums in her pocket. The sweat on her body tripped triggers in her brain; the adrenaline signaled the nerves to further panic. What if I die? she thought. Oh, my God, I'm going crazy. Then she was at the house, the safe place. But she had added more fears to an already long list. She was afraid of snow. She was afraid of hills.

Various explanations for this phenomenon can be offered.

Last April, he authorized the indictment of John J. Kearney, an F.B.I. official, on charges involving black bag jobs, warrantless wiretaps and breakins. It looked like the first in a commendable series of cases demonstrating that the law applies to everyone, including law enforcement officers. But the months have passed, leaving us and others to wonder, what series of cases? And now, in a startling act, the five Justice Department lawyers handling the Kearney case have resigned from it because the Attorney General has refused, in the hiatus, to authorize any more indictments. Mr. Bell's logic grows steadily more mysterious. No one thinks the indicted F.B.I. man dreamed up the illegal activity on his own; so to prosecute only him is perverse justice. Why not indict others, then? Mr. Bell has said he wishes to pursue the standard prosecutive strategy of indicting one defendant and pressing him to implicate others. But that hardly seems a sensible strategy when there is, obviously, considerable evidence about other potential defendantsand when, in any event, Mr. Kearney steadfastly refuses to tattle. So what can Mr. Bell be thinking of? Perhaps he now feels he was too hasty in approving the Kearney indictment in the first place and it is wrong to indict other law enforcement officers for similar conduct. But if that is so, why does Mr. Bell let the solitary Kearney case drag on? The Government should not ask agents to do black bag jobs; still less should it make them scapegoats.",1977-12-09T05:00:00+0000

We automatically discount it as creative factor in much of what we go to see. In this realm we are usually grateful for small mercies, having learned through long experience to tolerate on stage a vocabulary moribund pictorial conventions and dismal visual clichs we would not stand for,and, in truth, would not very often asked to stand forin a museum or gallery.

us,Cocteau's Charming 'Baron',"""The Phantom Baron"" is a fairy tale that ends with the words ""once upon a time,"" but that's the least of its eccentricities. Written by Jean Cocteau, and nominally directed by Serge de Poligny (Cocteau is known to have directed parts of the film himself), it combines the structure of an ordinary fable with the nebulous spirit of a sweet dream. Characters who are fully identified remain perplexingly unknowable, and no situation is ever quite what it seems to be. Yet Cocteau's screenplay is drawn with such delicacy that the film's warmth and generosity override its cool fascination with sleight-of-hand.In this 1943 production, now having its New York theatrical premiere at the Bleecker Street Cinema, the baron of the title is played by Cocteau himself. He vanishes mysteriously in his own chateau, leaving behind a very knowing-looking black cat. His family, including a countess and her young daughter and stepdaughter, come to live on the estate, which is photographed in shadow and on a tilt, and which is made to look as haunted as an estate can possibly be. The girls immediately befriend a young servant boy, Herve.Years later, they both begin to fall in love with him. However, they are also a little bit in love with the dashing soldier Alberic, (Claude Samval), whose confident manner makes Herve (Alain Cuny) seem especially withdrawn by comparison. The young women seem somewhat alike at first, but the heiress Elfy (Odette Joyeux) gradually reveals herself to be more frivolous than the lovely and generous Anne (Jany Holt).The actors swirl in and out of character, and the romantic alignments shift subtly and often, until the circumstances surrounding the baron's mysterious death are explained. It seems he deliberately sealed himself inside a cellar (his death was ""somewhat Egyptian,"" someone remarks), and left behind a will that untangles the plot's many questions of identity. His legacy should be one of clarity, but the film's concluding note is more one of wise and joyful acceptance, and of long-delayed understanding of the way things have always been.There is a thin, almost satirical wit to the stylized opening of the story, but it is not until later that a mood of maturity is established, and the more breathless segment of the story begins. The loveliest scene, an extravagantly romantic one, shows a dream shared by Anna and Herve, he carrying her across a misty ""Wuthering Heights""-style landscape and she in a white gown with a long flowing veil. The ecstasy of the moment is unequaled by anything else here, but it is so extravagantly lovely that its radiance goes a long way.",1977-12-12T05:00:00+0000

Otto Erich Deutsch, the great German musicologist, started the genre some years ago, in his documentary biographies of Mozart and Schubert. In a documentary biography, only the facts are supplied. The industrious researcher gathers up the source materials, like a boll weevil going through a cotton patch. Where the material is highly abundant and there are space limitations to the book, the compiler has to make a choice, as Mr. Weaver does in this study of Verdi. Otherwise there is no interpretation, no speculation, no fancy writing. Here are the documents. Make of them what you will. But documentary biographies are not as bleak as all that. The material is assembled chronologically, and the researcher supplies a running commentarypart biography, part correction when needed of the information in the documents themselves. For human memory can be fallible, or sentiment may color a reminiscence, or the subject himself may have twisted the facts far, some reason.

us,Screen: The Prince of Bay Ridge,"TONY IS A HANDSOME, bighearted guy with a lot more style than he knows what to do with. His job in a paint store call for much lan, but Tony supplies that anyway, charming the customers and strutting gamely down the street as he makes his deliveries. His room at home if dreary and his family even more so, but Tony has done what he can with Farrah and Rocky and Pacino posters to give the place a little class. Even so, things can get him downbut just when they do, another week is over and it's time to hit the local disco. On the weekend, and on the dance floor. Tony is king.Tony's whole life, as somebody else in ""Saturday Night Fever"" manages to point out, is ""a clich."" But John Travolta is so earnestly in tune with the character that Tony becomes even more touching than he is familiar and a source of fierce, desperate excitement. The movie, which spends mercifully little time trying to explain Tony, has a violent energy very like his own.This is best demonstrated during the dancing sequences, which lake up much of the film's time. Tony is depicted as being better than most, but also one of many; everyone in the 2001 Odyssey disco in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, seems possessed of a similar short-term vitality and pride. Their dancing is fluid, but it's also strictly, almost militaristically choreographed; people who stake everything on style can't afford to be sloppy, or even genuinely boisterous. Though the dancing is set to a blaring, contemporary score and often photographed in a red glow, the movie owes a lot more to ""West Side Story"" than it does to ""Mean Streets.""Mr. Travolta dances with a fine arrogance that follows naturally from the rest of his performance, and he has one solo number that stops the show. But John Badham, who previously directed another stylish, street-smart movie, ""The Bingo Long Travelling All-Stars and Motor Kings,"" isn't always content to let the simple energy of the music or the performances suffice. Too often, he cuts distractingly in the middle of a routine, and his efforts to aggrandize characters by shooting them at angles or from below are superfluous. If these kids weren't flamboyant enough on their own, no amount of camera tricks could cover for them.""Saturday Night Fever,"" which opens today at several theaters, begins to flag when, after an initial hour filled with high spirits and jubilant music, it settles down to tell its story; the effect is so deflating that it's almost as though another Monday has rolled around and it's time to get back to work.It seems that Tony's friends, who are a lively but uninteresting lot are so dead-ended that they're beginning to make him worry about his own future. And Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney), who has a job in Manhattan, is such a braggart that she has begun to give him notions of upward mobility.Ten minutes into the movie, you can be sure that its ending will be at least partly upbeat and that whatever happens will be blunt. But that is still no preparation for all the gruesome tricks Norman Wexler's screenplay uses to get Tony out of Brooklyn.Surely there are some people who make decisions without needing to be spurred on by a serious family trauma, an exceedingly ugly sexual episode and a friend's leap off the Verrazano Bridge. Tony, from what we've seen of him, is too proud and sensitive to need this much disillusionment to get him moving, but the screenplay has a way of indirectly, insulting the character by coddling him far more than he would ever coddle himself.Mr. Travolta is deft and vibrant, and he never condescends to the character, not even in a scene that has Tony and Stephanie arguing about whose ""Romeo and Juliet"" it is, Zeffirelli's or Shakespeare's. (They also try to identify Sir Laurence Olivier, and then remember that he's the guy who sells cameras on television.) Miss Gorney uses a much thicker accent and many more mispronunciations, and too often she is transparent in playing dumb. Donna Pescow, as one of the many local girls whom Tony could have but doesn't want, stays much more comfortably within the boundaries of her role.Among the movie's most influential principalsalthough they never appear on screenare the Bee Gees, who provided the most important parts or its score. It could be argued that the Bee Gees have been turning out the kinds of jaunty, formulaic disco hits that punctuate the movie for so long that they've lost any trace of originality. But it could also be argued that the group now has this kind of music down to a science, and that originality is not exactly a key ingredient in the disco mystique. In any case, at its best, the music moves with a real spring in its step, and the movie does too.",1977-12-16T05:00:00+0000

us,'Telefon': Spies With Ants in Pants,"There are a lot of things working against Don Siegel's ""Telefon,"" including its title, which as easily suggests one of Jerry Lewis's marathon television specials as it does the material with which skillets are lined so that eggs won't stick. ""Telefon,"" of course, has to do with neither.It's the Russian code name for a sabotage plan so unbelievable that the actors, when they must explain it to us in the course of the film, actually seem to be embarrassed. They know that we know that they know that it's tall-tale-time in the Kremlinshared knowledge that has the effect of disarming solemn criticism and inviting us to succumb to the breathless nonsense as co-conspirators.The Peter Hyams-Sterling Silliphant screenplay, based on the novel by Walter Wager, is a sort of post-Cold War update of one of John Frankenheimer's best films, ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" though it's nowhere near as stylish. As people in such movies are inclined to say at key moments, the situation, briefly, is this:During the height of the Cold War, the Soviets hypnotized and programmed about 50 agents who then were sent to the United States to lead lives as ordinary Americans, though they were, in fact, ticking time bombs. Should someone come along and whisper in their ears a few lines from Robert Frost's ""Stopping by a Woods on a Snowy Evening,"" they'd be triggered into action to carry out a series of suicidal sabotage missions. The agents, we are told, were programmed to believe they were true-blue Americans of the sort, one assumes, who wouldn't be caught dead at poetry readings.This plan, we are told further (and not so briefly), was junked with dtente, though the agents remained in place. Thus, today, when a nutty, unreconstructed Stalinist, played by Donald Pleasence as if on leave from Charendon, decides to wreck dtente by setting off these time bombs, something must be done.In some ways, I suppose, ""Telefon"" is almost heart-warming. The film, which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and other theaters, is the story of how the peace-loving members of the Soviet Secret Police and the Central Intelligence Agency work together (without always knowing it) to capture the mad Stalinist and defuse the agents.The man who does this is a dour, dedicated Soviet operative with a photographic memory, a fellow named Grigori Borzov, a role that Charles Bronson plays not much differently from the way he plays anything else, but which I now find I can respond to. Mr. Bronson is a movie actor of the old school. He doesn't seem to act (though that is what he's doing) as much as he inhabits a film with his particular, massive presence, giving the film much-needed ballast. Without him, ""Telefon"" would fly up to the ceiling and just hang there.As his resident contact in America, Lee Remick is as likely a Soviet spy as Janet Leigh was once a Soviet pilot (Von Sternberg's ""Jet Pilot""), but she's pretty and game and very cheery company, even with the screenplay's failed attempts at breezy dialogue.""Telefon"" is one of those movies that can't sit still. It moves from Moscow to Denver to Washington to Moscow to Los Angeles like a spy with the fidgets. While it's rather fun anticipating what disguise Mr. Pleasence is next going to turn up in (I think I favor his blond toupee and sneakers), some of the other supporting actors are more difficult to take. Patrick Magee plays a Soviet intelligence chief as if he were in a revue sketch, and the people who play C.I.A. types look so bland and empty you may suspect that they, too, have been hypnotized by the KGB.Mr. Siegel (""Dirty Harry"") is not a director whose light touch is always sure, though ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" and ""Charley Varrick"" were very entertaining. He needs good screenplays and room in which to build action sequences. Though there are action sequences in ""Telefon,"" they are never sustained, and the screenplay only occasionally comes up with witty substitutes for the missing plausibility. However, to describe ""Telefon"" as synthetic is to take it more seriously than it's taken by anyone connected with it.""Telefon"" has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It has isolated moments of explosive action and some blood, but nothing that would shock a child or a Soviet censor.",1977-12-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Greatest Lover,' Great Comedy","There's a scene in ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown,"" the 1969 feature film based on the Peanuts characters, in which Lucy Linus and Charlie Brown are lying on their backs, freely associating as they watch the clouds roll by, Charlie Brown sees horsies and duckies in the clouds. Linus can make out the stoning of St. Stephen ""and, down in one corner, the profile of Thomas Eakins, the 19th-century American portrait painter."" Lucy, though she's as much at ease as she ever manages to be, is reminded only of wads of cotton. One feels sorry for poor Lucy, her appreciation of fantasy severely limited by an awareness that she is life's umpire.A comedy like Gene Wilder's ""The World's Greatest Lover"" is not for the Lucies of this world. Rather it's for people whose spirits more or less match those of Mr. Wilder, an imaginative fellow who tries to control his madness and, when he fails, comes forth with a movie. First there was ""Sherlock Holmes's Smarter Brother"" and now ""The World's Greatest Lover""movies in what may be described as the ""melbrooks"" manner in honor of Mr. Wilder's occasional collaborator and the director of his funniest performance (in ""Young Frankenstein"").Watching ""The World's Greatest Lover"" is about as cheerful and satisfying a substitute for cloud-watching as I can imagine. It's also frequently side-splitting and, when it's not causing physical damage, so full of intelligent associations that it would hold the attention of someone with interests as varied as those of Linus.""The World's Greatest Lover"" was produced, written and directed by Mr. Wilder, who also plays the title role, that of an ambitious but desperately neurotic Milwaukee baker who, in 1926, sets out to become the new Rudolph Valentino.Rudy Valentine is not at first glanceor second or even thirda likely prospect. His face looks like a coconut on which someone has drawn a pair of blue eyes and pasted a Harpo wig. Then, too, in moments of stress he's inclined to invert the words of a sentence or, worse, to stick out his tongue, a gesture that's misunderstood in public places.Though Rudy is maniacally ambitious, he's very insecure a failing that is not helped by his sweet but equally nutty wife Annie (Carol Kane), who writes mash notes to the real Rudolph Valentino, or by the sort of people he meets on the road to the top. These include a classically crazy hotel manager (Fritz Feld), a hyperventilating Hollywood studio chief (Dom De Luise), and assorted, mostly anonymous lunatics who would give fatal pause to anyone less self-absorbed than Rudy.In an end credit card, Mr. Wilder thanks Federico Fellini for his encouragement in making ""The World's Greatest Lover,"" thus acknowledging the inspiration he received from Fellini's 1950 comedy, ""The White Sheik,"" which is also about naifs and the magic world of moviemaking, though an entirely different kind of film from the one that Mr. Wilder has made. Fellini's characters are rooted in a recognizable place and time. Mr. Wilder's live in the marvelous cloud-cuckooland of movie comedy where characters are defined by the routines and gags they survive.""The World's Greatest Lover"" has a story line, meaning that it makes narrative sense, but it moves forward through more or less accidental set-pieces, such as a hilarious sequence on the train carrying Rudy and Annie to Hollywood when Rudy, through no real fault of his own finds himself feigning passion for an old man in a blanket.Do Rudy and Annie love each other? Their private lives are completely spelled out in another sequence in which Rudy attempts to teach Annie how to make love with the help of a manual called ""Sex by the Numbers"": ""Are we doing 3?"" asks Annie. ""You're doing 3,"" says Rudy, ""I'm doing 8.""For a comedy of this kind, ""The World's Greatest Lover"" is uncommonly handsome, the period sets and costumes having a lot of the fantasy quality of a stylish Broadway musical. There are also moments when the film's action seems to have been choreographed, which suggests the flow of a musical as well as the movements of old-time slapstick farce.

us,Film: Children of the Kirov,"ONE of the many ballet teachers interviewed in ""The Children of Theater Street"" is a man who, in his youth, once saw Nijinsky. The great dancer was a student at the time, and the man being interviewed recalls how different he seemed from the others; he could leap into the air and stay aloft much longer than seemed physically possible. The man remembers, though, that Nijinsky's own teacher saw things another way. The teacher was less impressed by talent and grandeur than he was by the fact that Nijinsky never landed in time to the music.""The Children or Theater street,"" a documentary about the famed Kirov ballet school in Leningrad, is made in a spirit of which this teacher would doubtless approve. It is earnest, plodding and thoroughly earthbound, a fine illustration of how easy it is to demystify artistry by trying too hard to understand it.We watch young students auditioning for admission to the school, and we see older ones rehearsing for their all-important graduation performance. We are casually introduced to many of their teachers. And we are told endlessy, by a narrative script read in a genteel monotone by Princess Grace of Monaco, that these children must study long and hard to achieve a level of success that will always fall short of perfection. But we are never allowed much individual insight into anyone; the film shifts its attention too erratically and often to allow any of the dancers' struggles or triumphs much meaning. This is less a sustained study than it is a series of glimpses through keyholes.For a film about people who have dedicated their lives to the single-minded pursuit of one goal, ""The Children of Theater Street"" meanders to a surprising degree. Just when the director, Robert Dornhelm, seems about to single out a particular student or aspect of life at the school, the narration will make a point about dance in the 19th century and then change that subject, too. Details, when they are offered, are far from revealing: All we are cold about one stocky older woman who plays the piano at dance classes is that she has been wandering the halls of the school for ages, carrying her sheet music and her purse.The film pays particular attention to several of the students, and there is an 11-year-old girl named Angelina who takes one's breath away. With a long neck, sloe eyes and an expression of exquisite serenity, she already dances more beautifully than many of the older children we see; there's something magical about the way she always catches the eye, even in a crowd. The scenes that feature Angelina are both the loveliest here and the least successful; a spirit like hers is precisely what the film is so ill-equipped to capture.",1977-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Eastwood 'Gauntlet',"IN ""THE GAUNTLET,"" his new film as both director and star, Clint Eastwood plays a detective in Phoenix who is described as a drunk and an incompetent. It is, you see, a character role. So, too, is that of Sondra Locke, the pretty, fresh-faced actress who made her debut in ""The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter."" Miss Locke plays a Las Vegas hooker who graduated from Finch College. ""The schoolgirl look is very popular right now,"" someone says by way of explanation.Explanations aren't really necessary. ""The Gauntlet"" has nothing to do with reality and everything to do with Clint Eastwood fiction, which is always about a Force (Mr. Eastwood) that sets things straight in a crooked world.""The Gauntlet,"" which opened yesterday at the Columbia I and National Theaters, is about the rigors faced by Mr. Eastwood's detective when he attempts to return the hooker from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify at a mob trial. Along the way the detective and the girl establish a revivifying relationship (he will give up his Jack Daniel's if she gives up her johns), though the movie is more concerned with the mob's efforts to prevent them from completing their trip.There are escapes in ambulances, gunfights in speeding automobiles, a helicopter attack, a ride on a stolen motorcycle and, for the climax, a sequence in which a bus, armored like the Monitor, runs a police gantlet through downtown Phoenix to reach City Hall.It is a movie without a single thought in its head, but its action sequences are so ferociously staged that it's impossible not to pay attention most of the time. It's not simply that the film is noisy. It has a kind of violent grace, as when a house, which has been bombarded by the heavy artillery of the police, quietly gives up and collapses into fine rubble.Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack wrote the screenplay, which exists to accommodate the mayhem much in the way that the book for a Broadway musical supports the songs. Mr. Eastwood's talent is his style, unhurried and self-assured, that of a man who goes through life looking down onto the bald spots of others. Miss Locke is not only pretty, but also occasionally genuinely funny.In supporting roles, Pat Hingle has nothing much to do and as Mr. Eastwood's fussy, nannylike cop-friend, and William Prince models some very dapper haberdashery as the mob's highly placed contact within the Phoenix Police Department.",1977-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,"'The Choirboys,' Film Version Of Novel About Police, Opens","""The Choirboys,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinerama Two and other theaters, is Robert Aldrich's screen adaptation of Joseph Wambaugh's best-selling novel about the private panics of a bunch of Los Angeles cops of assorted eccentricities. After dealing day and night with the city's flotsam, Mr. Wambaugh tells us, these policemen, neither brighter nor more sensitive than any other group of men, survive only with the help of booze and pills and a see-through cynicism that is worn as if it were plastic rain-gear.Mr. Wambaugh's episodic novel is tough and funny and comes alive with the unexpected details of a forlorn truth. The movie, which Mr. Aldrich directed from a screenplay by Christopher Knopf, is cheap and nasty without having any redeeming vulgarity and absolutely no conviction of truth. What went wrong?The material seems to be the sort that would perfectly suit Mr. Aldrich (""The Dirty Dozen,"" ""The Grissom Gang,"" ""Ulzana's Raid""), a man whose darker humors match those of the novelist, yet there's little evidence of that here. Further, the movie is such a stylistic and narrative mess one suspects it was originally shot to be one of those six-hour ""television novels"" and then cut down to its present two-hour running time for a theatrical play-off.Though it's the kind of film that's designed for people who don't read much, it can be followed only by someone who has some familiarity with the book. However, anyone who liked the book will probably be appalled by the movie. Which is about as close as ""The Choirboys"" ever gets to ""Catch 22.""The title, for those who came in late, is derived from the impromptu, late-night, booze-and-broads blow-outs that Mr. Wambaugh's cops hold in L.A.'s MacArthur Park after getting off duty. The sessions, which the cops call choir practice, are epic benders that have the effect of decompressing the men's psyches. They sing, fight, get sick, play cruel practical jokes on one another and, eventually, return to the surface of the earth.In Mr. Wambaugh's novel, the reader is able to understand the manic intensity of the choirboys at these parties, having been given some idea of the grubby violence of their working lives. The film attempts to treat their working lives mostly in comic terms, even though what happens is not especially comic, so that their off-duty behavior has no more meaning than would the off-duty behavior of a bunch of loutish television repairmen.Among the actors in the huge cast, some of the more prominent are Charles Durning, as the father-figure cop; Perry King, as an Ivy League sort, who turns out to be fatally effete; Tim McIntire, a red-neck, bigoted sadist; Randy Quaid, as ""the kid,"" and Burt Young, who is funny and spirited as the vice-squad chief whom everyone mistakes for the station-house janitor.",1977-12-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie: Man's Inhumanity to Son,"""Padre Padrone,"" which was shown at the New York Film Festival, was reviewed on Sept. 25 by Janet Maslin. Following are excerpts from the review. The picture opened yesterday at the Cinema 2 Theater, Third Avenue and 60th Street.Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, the two brothers who wrote and directed ""Padre Padrone,"" say they first got the idea for their film from a newspaper clippingabout a shepherd who had lived in almost complete isolation in the hills of Sardinia until he turned 20, then went on to become a professor of linguistics and write a book about his experience.When the brothers learned more about the man's story, they began to perceive him not as an unsocialized innocent  la Truffaut's ""The Wild Child"" or Herzog's ""The Mystery of Kasper Hauser,"" but rather as a more conventional figure whose character was shaped through his battle with a single huge impediment. The obstacle in ""Padre Padrone"" is not the shepherd's estrangement, or even his monumental loneliness, but rather his terrifying and tyrannical father.The film's beginning, and its most stirring segment, presents a 6-year-old boy being taken out of school and sent off to tend a flock on a desolate, ruggedly beautiful mountainside. His father, who beats young Gavino with objects as stridently symbolic as a stick and a dead snake, inducts the boy into his new way of life in the cruelest manner possible.There are isolated instances of the father's tenderness, when he shares his perceptions of nature with his son and when he realizes, after the boy bursts into tears and then faints from fright and exhaustion, that the torture has gone far enough. But most of the father's behavior borders on sadism, despite the economic necessity in which it is rooted. So the father remains as inconsistent and irrational to the viewer as he might seem to a small child.Years later, when Gavino begins bridling under his father's authority and angling for a chance to escape, his battle is fought along more familiar lines and his father seems a less formidable adversary. Gavino enlists in the army and travels to the Italian mainland, where he begins to educate himself and delight in the precise meaning of words. The title which means ""My Father, My Master,"" also refers to Gavino's sheer exultation in the nuances of his new vocabulary.By the time Gavino returns to Sardinia, his father has begun to seem smaller, pettier, a bit more pathetic in his stubbornness. Gavino finally wins his freedom, but at a terrible cost: He is forced to witness the spectacle of his father's defeat and humiliation. ""Padre Padrone"" is stirringly affirmative. It's also a bit simple: The patriarchal behavior of Gavino's father is so readily accepted as an unfathomable given constant that the film never offers much insight into the man or the culture that fostered him. Intriguingly aberrant behavior is chalked up to tradition, and thus robbed of some of its ferocity. But the film is vivid and very moving, coarse but seldom blunt, and filled with raw landscapes that underscore the naturalness and inevitability of the father-son rituals it depicts.The Taviani brotheres have made other films, but this is the first of their efforts to receive wide international exposure and acclaim. ""Padre Padrone,"" which was the grand prize winner at Cannes this year, should serve less as a debut than as an introduction.",1977-12-24T05:00:00+0000

He wears his Phi Beta Kappa key on a fine gold chain and neatly spears his understated tie with a gold pin that also keeps his shirt collar tucked in. More importantly, he has an elegant flaw. Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke, newly appointed head of Los Angeles's posh ($12,000 a month for room and board) Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous, suffers from high anxiety, which is like vertigo, only worse.One could easily mistake Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke for the hero of a film like ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" or ""Vertigo"" except for one thing. He has the cowardly man's restless glance as he keeps track of the terrain and of all the ways to make a quick exit. The explanation is simple. The actor playing the role is Jimmy Stewart compacted to the volatile proportions of Mel Brooks in Mr. Brooks's funny, brainy, film-buff comedy, ""High Anxiety,"" which opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater.In a way that seems sneaky only because he has been so successful at the box office (and popularity must always be suspect), Mr. Brooks is extending the boundaries of parody in contemporary films. In ""Blazing Saddles"" he brought anarchy to the Wild West and in ""Silent Movie"" he demonstrated his affection for slapstick comedy with approximately 258 variations on the pratfall and the pie-in-the-face. ""Young Frankenstein,"" his best film to date, cheerfully recalled everything we remember most fondly about 1930's horror films in general and James Whale's ""Frankenstein"" in particular.""High Anxiety,"" Mr. Brooks's homage to the extraordinary career of Alfred iHitchcock, is as witty and as disciplined as ""Young Frankenstein,"" though it has one built-in problem: Hitchcock himself is a very funny man. His films, even at their most terrifying and most suspenseful, are full of jokes shared with the audience. Being so self-aware, Hitchcock's films deny an easy purchase to the parodist, especially one who admires his subject the way Mr. Brooks does. There's nothing to send up, really. There are only characters' scenes, manners and gestures to be remembered with affection.In ""High Anxiety,"" the story of the flawed Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke's coming to terms with his neurosis, Mr. Brooks remembers all sorts of Hitchcock films, including ""The Lodger,"" ""Rebecca,"" ""Psycho,"" ""Vertigo"" and ""The Birds,"" and a lot of the film's fun is sharing his affection. That the enjoyment tends to be cerebral is confirmed. I think, by the fact that it's a movie that is almost as funny to hear about as to see.What will people feel about the film if they don't know Hitchcock from Hawks? After watching five- and 10-year-old children, who'd never heard of ""Frankenstein,"" collapsing with laughter at ""Young Frankenstein,"" I suspect it won't make any difference at all. There's an infectiously funny rhythm to a Brooks film to which even the unenlightened can respond.As the afflicted Dr. Thorndyke, Mr. Brooks plays it so very, very straight that just the memory of one of his famous leers is funny, as when he arrives at his post and meets Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman), a thin-lipped, sadistic Florence Nightingale who has the slightest hint of a mustache and breasts that seem borrowed from Brunnhilde. Among the other people with whom he must deal, there are the dapper but masochistically bent Dr. Montague (Harvey Korman), kindly old Professor Lillolman (Howard Morris) and especially the glamorous San Francisco socialite, Victoria Brisbane, played by Madeline Kahn, a woman who can be gloriously funny simply by attempting to control an upper lip. She's a cocktail waitress's loving concept of ""the real Kim Novak.""The screenplay, written by Mr. Brooks with Ron Clark, Rudy De Luca and Barry Levinson, all of whom make cameo appearances in the film with gusto, deals in Hitchcockesque skullduggery set at the Psycho-Neurotic Institute and at a doctors' convention in San Francisco where, one way and another, the doctor gets to the bottom of the mysterious incidents at his sanitarium.Miss Leachman and Mr. Korman have great fun as the villains, as does Ron Carey, who, early in the movie, dutifully introduces himself to Dr. Thorndyke as ""your driver and sidekick."" Mr. Brooks also has succeeded in making the movie look like a Hitchcock production, even to dolly shots of a kind one seldom sees in movies any more.""High Anxiety,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested"") includes a few vulgar gestures and words of the sort that, to children, have Shavian impact.",1977-12-26T05:00:00+0000
