In the settlement, those involved with the Chicago production acknowledged that it contained original and creative works from the Broadway production and agreed to pay an undisclosed sum. The eyebrow-raising part of the lawsuit was the charge that Chicago copied the stage direction of the 2002 New York production. Some design elements and choreography are protected under copyright law, but there has not been a conclusive ruling on whether a directors work is protected. John Rando, the director of the Broadway production, applied for copyright protection for his work but was turned down, and the Department of Justice intervened in the case, saying that the federal copyright office had acted properly in rejecting Mr. Randos plea. A separate, similar lawsuit involving a dinner theater production of Urinetown in Akron, Ohio, is still pending.",2007-12-01T05:00:00+0000

us,'Well-Adjusted',"When I first started reading about adoption, I kept coming across the words ""well-adjusted adoptee."" In 1970s the thinking was that adoptees should be content with their present lives and not think about their adoptions. I read studies on the Internet in the 1990s and it seemed little had changed. Questions beyond childhood curiosity and looking anything other than ""happy"" would get you labeled as having psychological problems or ""issues.""   Technically, I was a ""functioning"" adult  a stay-at-home-mom who cooked, cleaned, took care of her children like most of my friends. I wasn't prone to depression though there were times when I would go deep into thought. I laughed and cried, felt joy and anger like most people I knew. The difference was that I had a dirty little secret. I was actually thinking about my adoption and its effects on me.   When people asked why I was digging into my past, my typical reply was that I needed to know the truth to pass on to my children. But there was more to it than that. Answering the questions of why, who, when, where and how might also lead to some understanding of myself. My experiences as an adoptee didn't have everything to do with shaping me as a person, but how much it did was something I'd never considered before.   There were moments in childhood that turned my mind to questioning. As a young girl, I found my green card in my mother's purse. When I was 10, the arrival of another Vietnamese adoptee redirected my perspective from that of the adopted child to that of a Vietnamese adoptee. Then there was Binh, who'd I had come across on the Internet. Binh was Vietnamese and lived in England. Our contact was the first positive experience I'd had with another person from Vietnam.  We didn't talk about adoption or even Vietnam, but shared an interest in movies and anime. It's sad, but our online exchanges were the first real interaction on any ""normal"" level I'd had with another Vietnamese person. He was almost half my age but thoughtful and compassionate beyond his years. Often our discussions would center on how we felt about the world and our lives in it. This set into motion a process of reexamination. How had I gotten where I was and why? My inner eye eventually turned to my adoption.   Struggling to put my life back into the context of adoption was infuriating and deeply isolating at first. Part of the loneliness was self-inflicted; I felt many wouldn't have understood why I couldn't just ""move on."" The one family member to whom I disclosed my need to re-examine my adoption felt I'd lost my mind and even gave that impression to others. He suggested counseling. I felt insulted. What I needed wasn't therapy, it was understanding. I hadn't lost my mind; I was going through a process of reclaiming it. For the greater part of my life, I'd simply accepted what I'd been told.   To me, the suggestion of therapy meant I was ""maladjusted"" and needed to be readjusted  but to what? Adoption itself wasn't viewed as ""normal."" How do you assign a norm to an unusual situation? As more adult adoptees have grown into adulthood and spoken out about their experiences, changes in the way society perceives adoption are slowly being made.   Today, it's more acceptable for adoptees to question, to seek answers and even mourn their losses as some of us often do. As long as we eventually come to some sense of ""peace"" and go about our daily lives, all is well. It isn't until some of us become critical that we are confronted by a revised version of ""maladjusted."" This new term implies the same thing as the old but with a twist. We've come to be known as ""the bitter, angry adoptees.""   When I first began writing critically about my adoption on my blog, I was surprised by this and even more so to learn I'd been smacked with the same label. While there were a few readers who tried to understand without judgment, there were still those who couldn't get past their misperceptions. People online who didn't even know me gave me well-intentioned advice on how to resolve my ""anger issues."" Others suggested therapy and still others told me to ""grow up."" It was still the same attitude, but the language had changed.  I would get e-mails from adoptive parents who would often argue that ""things are so much better for adoptees now."" But are they? I felt the statement was dismissive and showed a lack of understanding. The labeling itself seemed a sign that some things were not better. Why did it seem anger was not an acceptable emotion for an adoptee to feel?  Many adoptees have valid reasons for being angry. Should someone else decide that those reasons are not valid? Who defines socially acceptable norms? Based on what? I feel these are questions that should be asked. And I think that the answers are at the heart of the ""bitter adoptee"" label.   Just like many in the adoptee community, I'm not willing to settle for ""better."" To stop thinking about it now would mean settling into complacency. I know all too well what happens when the mind stops thinking critically. The pressure to conform to someone else's expectations can be overwhelming. In my desire to appear ""well-adjusted."" I resorted to denial and suppression. I became a chronic people-pleaser as result of my attempts to blend into my surroundings.  It would be a lie for me to say I'm not still angry. I am, but people often misunderstand what I am angry about. I came to terms long ago with the fact that I'm adopted. I've even begun to come to terms with many of my negative experiences that involved racism, isolation and even deception. Much of my anger comes from people labeling me with dehumanizing, dismissive and misleading terms. It also comes from frustration about the condescending attitudes we often face when we speak out. Sometimes it's simply conviction and determination.  There is a difference between anger and all-encompassing, blind rage. I write about painful, anger-inducing experiences because I wasn't allowed to explore them before. Writing publicly about them also contributes to the understanding of the complexities of adoption. As a society, I think we still have an overly simplistic view of adoption. While current studies may scratch the surface by studying the different aspects of adoption, the ""either/or"" idea is still prevalent. Adoption is either good or bad. Either you're for it or against it. The adoptee is either well-adjusted or maladjusted.  I think the reactions of some adoptive parents are sometimes rooted in fear that their children might turn out to be one of the ""the bad ones."" I believe most adoptive parents genuinely love their children. They don't want them to be miserable, but that fear is often based on that same all or nothing misconception. Just as adoption itself can't be painted over with a broad brush, neither can adoptees  as a community or as individuals. We also can be paradoxical in nature. I am thankful for what I have but I still mourn what I've lost. I can acknowledge my anger but still think past it to laugh and enjoy life.   Many of the adoptees I know who were initially labeled as ""bitter"" or ""angry"" have gone on to do some pretty incredible things. Some have become accomplished writers and artists, formed organizations, become socially and politically aware and active. Some have even entered the field of adoption as professionals. No longer content to adapt and conform, many adoptees are now working toward social change. The ""angry, bitter ones"" are just a part of a greater whole existing as productive members of that community.  For many like me, critiques on adoption are not just about our own experiences. It just began there. Our eyes have turned toward the next generation, to first mothers and beyond. It doesn't stop at our front door as we've begun to delve into subjects like adoption ethics, racism, civil rights, economics and politics. Angry? Yes, some of us are but sometimes that's a necessary element. History is full of examples. Should we dismiss the Boston Tea Party as a mere temper tantrum? Why are some adoptees getting a bad rap from some adoptive parents? I think it's because adoptees are still thought of as ""the lucky ones,"" the ones who were ""saved."" What do we have to complain about?   Of course, I can only speak for myself. There will be adoptees out there whose experiences and opinions differ. ""We"" only refers to those with whom I share certain commonalities, nothing more. Yes, ""we"" have made progress, but many feel we still have a long way to go. Building our communities and support systems was just the beginning and it seems we're in it for the long haul. ",2007-12-01T17:35:14+0000
us,Well-Adjusted,"When I first started reading about adoption, I kept coming across the words well-adjusted adoptee.

us,Comics,"Cartooning is always subjective, so when you look at political comics, its useful to think about where their arguments can lie  not just in their words but in the implications of their visual style. If you were to read only Andrew Helfers text for RONALD REAGAN: A Graphic Biography (Hill & Wang, $16.95), for instance, it would seem to be a straightforward chronological trot through Reagans life story, with particular attention paid to the showmanship of his public persona and his weakness for self-serving fabrications. Most of the books spin, though, is actually in its artwork, by Steve Buccellato and Joe Staton. After an opening montage of notable moments from Reagans public life, which might as well have been sketched from publicity photos, Ronald Reagan becomes a catalog of the sorts of visual rhetoric cartoonists can pull off: nearly every panel incorporates some kind of broad caricature or symbolic distortion, usually at Reagans expense. On a single page, we see a smiling Reagan hobnobbing with three other Screen Actors Guild board members while Jane Wyman checks her watch; then Reagan and Wyman sweating, smiling and pushing away enormous tough guys with shirts labeled Union; then a quizzical Reagan (with a question mark over his head) watching a man with a fez and a hammer-and-sickle jacket whispering in someones ear; and finally the editorial-cartoon shorthand of an eagle and a bear standing on a broken swastika and scowling at each other.

Roast Chicken is one of those rare cookbooks that, once opened, becomes indispensable  perhaps because it takes so many of the dishes you thought you had already mastered and, quite simply, does them that much better. Foodies know it as the winner of the 1995 Glenfiddich award for best food book, and publishers know it as the book that trumped Harry Potter on Amazon.coms British best-seller list. The British magazine Waitrose Food Illustrated named it the most useful cookbook ever, but here I must disagree. Roast Chicken and Other Stories  is far too idiosyncratic to be labeled useful.

us,Once Upon a Time in China,"Heres a lesson in the graceful acceptance of defeat. In 1298, the Genoese navy bested the Venetian fleet at the Battle of Curzola. Unable to live with the disgrace, one Venetian commander, Andrea Dandolo, killed himself by beating his head against his ships mast. Another Venetian leader, Marco Polo, surrendered calmly, was taken prisoner and spent a few years writing his memoirs in comfortable captivity. Dandolos fame died on the deck; Polos will outlive our grandchildren. Few famous names have as much vagueness attached to their exploits, though. Marco Polo opened Asia to European trade, so were told, but we generally dont know much else. Laurence Bergreen remedies that by bolstering Polos reputation and arguing for his historical importance in a book as enthralling as a rollicking travel journal. Bergreen, who has written biographies of Louis Armstrong, James Agee and Irving Berlin, turned his attention to ancient explorers with Over the Edge of the World, which tracked Ferdinand Magellans circumnavigation of the globe. I was a fan of that book, but Marco Polo far outshines it, and not surprisingly. Marco Polo, unlike Magellan, left his biographers a masterpiece of a memoir to work with. ",2007-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Since then, Ive dropped them, Ive broken them, Ive had them stolen on the subway, Ive lost them in taxis. When I was working on the Mira Nair film Monsoon Wedding, I fell almost 10 feet into an empty pool. As I was falling, I hallucinated that the Leica was my baby. I held it against my chest and landed with all my weight on my wrist and broke it into a million pieces. But I saved my Leica. Over the years, Ive learned that the lens is a very subjective relationship. The reason I use a Leica is because it actually has a subtext. It depends on what youre photographing, but the lens shows you not just the surface: the levels underneath are revealed. Somebody told me once how optically this was possible.

For a generous share of the hundreds of color photographs that overflow its pages exhibit uncontested masterpieces of Greek art in all their glory. Some, just to scratch the lustrous surface, are as familiar as the bronze charioteer from Delphi or the Victory of Samothrace, which now stands atop the Daru staircase in the Louvre. Other objects amid the profusion of wall paintings, sculptures, vases, mosaics, furniture and metalworks on display here are less instantly recognizable but scarcely less breathtaking. These ancient treasures, together with historic photographs of the major excavations, aerial panoramas of splendid sites, old watercolors and lithographs, and 19th-century architectural renderings, are enough to leave a deep impression on anyone with a drop of philhellenic blood.

us,A Normal Family,"It happened again  this time before Halloween  as we reached the cashier's station at The Party Store.  The clerk, who must have been about 18, took a long look at my daughters.  ""Are they yours?"" she asked.  ""Yes,"" I said tersely, hoping my tone would dissuade further inquiry.  It didn't.  ""Are they adopted?"" she asked.  Now I was ready to give her a blast, a lecture about manners and boundaries.  ""Yes, they are  ""  But the young woman cut me off, interrupting with a perky, ""I'm adopted, too!""  Oh. Um, never mind.  In the last year or so, I've noticed that I have these kinds of conversations more and more. People who once would have intruded with a boorish question seem to have been replaced by others who want to share their own abiding connection to adoption. They were adopted themselves. Or they're in the process of adopting  a ""waiting family."" Or their grown son or daughter is on his or her way back from overseas, about to make them a grandparent.  In fact it seems to me  dare I say it?  that adoption is becoming normal. Or least more normalized. Sure, it's taken 60-some years. But attitudes are changing. And that's not my imagination.  Ten years ago, 58 percent of Americans had a family member or close friend who had adopted a child, were adopted themselves, or had placed a child for adoption, according to a national survey by the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York. By 2002, that figure had risen to 63 percent. It's surely higher now.  The same studies found that the percentage of Americans who have seriously considered adopting a child rose from 36 percent to 39 percent  a 3 percent increase that's statistically insignificant, but which the institute believes may mark the start of a permanent change in the way people think about how to build their families.  Adoption is routinely in the news these days, and not just because Brangelina and Madonna have new children. The coverage reflects the sheer number of people who are adopting, particularly from overseas, and the way in which each individual adoption radiates outward, from nuclear family to extended family to friends and co-workers. In the last 15 years, nearly 62,000 children have arrived from China alone. Another 76,000 have come from Russia and Guatemala. Today more are coming from African nations like Ethiopia.  Most of those families couldn't hide their adoptions if they wanted to  and they don't. That's a big change from the 1950s and 1960s, when adoption was a secret so shameful it had to be kept even from the child.  When that clerk spoke up at The Party Store, my daughters paid no attention. Sure, Jin Yu, 7, was busy admiring her High School Musical cheerleader costume. Zhao Gu, 4, had her arms wrapped around her Dorothy of Oz dress, perhaps contemplating the most efficient means to dispose of unwanted witches. But it was more than that. Both of them know adoption as a common word in their household and a routine fact of their lives.  Four adopted children live on our street. Jin Yu's best friend is adopted. So is a boy in her first-grade class. And a teacher at her school. None see it as extraordinary. Which is not to say things are perfect.  Adoptive Families magazine recently carried the story of a Florida woman who was asked to prove that she was her daughter's mother before hospital personnel would treat the child. It's impossible to conceive of a biological parent being asked to verify the same relationship. And every adoptive parent I know has endured frustrations like my own: The woman who approaches our group at a restaurant, demanding to know who among our girls are the ""real"" children. The relative who laments that I never had ""children of my own,"" oblivious to the little girls beside me. The strangers who feel free to ask why my wife and I adopted and how much it cost  as if the doctors and nurses who deliver babies work for free.  I wonder how these folks would feel if I turned the tables, if I were to tap them on the shoulder while they and their child waited in line for a movie or a seat at a restaurant. ""Hey, was your daughter born by in-vitro? She looks in-vitro to me. Am I right or am I right?""  Last summer we were on vacation in Germany when Jin Yu tugged on my arm.  ""Dad,"" she said, ""those boys keep pointing at me. Why are they pointing at me?""  I knew why. But I didn't want to say. Because I hated that the rudeness of strangers should compel me to explain to my daughter  again  that some people see our family as different. So I didn't respond at first, and in that moment's pause Jin Yu answered her own question with the very words her father should have offered:  ""It's not polite to point,"" she said.  No, it's not.  It's encounters like that one that make me brace for wounding questions  more and more to find that I needn't have worried. Not long ago, I was leading Zhao Gu along a beach at the Jersey shore.  ""Excuse me,"" a woman said from her seat on a towel, ""is your daughter from China?""  ""Yes, she is,"" I said  and kept walking.  But in a moment the woman was on her feet, trying to catch up with me in the sand.  ""We're a waiting family!"" she called.  Oh. Why didn't you say so? ",2007-12-03T01:42:28+0000

The sheet covers the cadenza for the first movement of the Sinfonia Concertante in E flat for Violin, Viola and Orchestra, a 1779 masterwork that lifted the composer into the ranks of the great at the age of 23, The Times of London reported. The sheet is one of only two surviving leaves from the original score. On its reverse side it also carries, in Mozarts hand, the parts for two horns for two unidentified pieces. Simon Maguire, the senior specialist in Sothebys music department, said: What makes the survival of this sheet particularly noteworthy is the fact that cadenzas are perhaps the least likely part of any musical piece ever to be written down. Cadenzas were usually improvised, so there was no need for written guidance from composers. In this instance, because the concerto is a work for two instruments, Mozart worked it out in advance and wrote it out separately to avoid the two instruments improvising independently and clashing. The sheet is expected to sell for more than the estimate of $205,000.",2007-12-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Brooks Brothers Migrates to the West,"The new Brooks Brothers store on Broadway at 65th Street. (Photo: David W. Dunlap/The New York Times) Slide Show: Brooks Brothers on Broadway Even in an era of rampant brand extension, there is something incongruous about the sight of a Brooks Brothers store at Broadway and 65th Street, which was still West Side Story territory in the days when Brooks was outfitting John F. Kennedy in sack suits.  You could say, cynically, that this is merely a sign that the venerable clothier is now no more than a Banana Republic chain for the next-higher income bracket. Or you could say that Brooks Brothers is really returning to its roots, since it conducted business on Broadway from 1858 to 1915, moving steadily uptown all the while.  Lou Amendola, the chief merchandising officer for Brooks Brothers, can look at a map of Manhattan and see the 9,500-square-foot Lincoln Square branch, which formally opened today, as following naturally in a northwesterly migratory pattern going back to 1818 and the original store at Catharine and Cherry Streets.  Brooks Brothers first appearance on Broadway was at the corner of Grand Street. Abraham Lincoln shopped here. (What other customer would have needed an overcoat for his second inauguration with a quilted lining embellished by an embroidered eagle holding a One Country, One Destiny pennant in its beak?) The store then moved briefly to Union Square.  At 670 Broadway, on the corner of Bond Street, Brooks opened its next headquarters  a Victorian confection designed by George E. Harney. Externally it is an ornament to the street, The New York Times declared on April 11, 1874, and its internal arrangements are of the most perfect kind. The building is still an ornament in NoHo. Recent retail tenants have included the Top Tomato produce store and the Wet Seal clothing store.  Brooks moved up Broadway to 22nd Street in 1884. Here, it introduced Americans to the button-down polo collar shirt, the polo coat, the Shetland sweater and the silk Foulard necktie. Brooks moved to its current flagship, at Madison Avenue and 44th Street, in 1915. Though much altered, the 22nd Street building still stands. If you visit Domain Home Fashions today, you can still see the great cast-iron columns of the main selling floor, where mens suits were once piled high. (Thats how they displayed them, in piles, turned inside out so customers could see the fine linings.)  Are there more neighborhood Brooks Brothers to come? The potential is definitely there, Mr. Amendola said through a spokesman. The challenge, he added, is finding the right space to accommodate a full range of the stores offerings.  If the company is thinking about NoHo, it is worth noting that there is an 11,250-square-foot corner storefront now available. At 670 Broadway, on the corner of Bond Street.

And people who divorced used 73 billion kilowatt-hours more of electricity and 627 billion gallons of water than they would otherwise in 2005. Dissolving a marriage also means doubling possessions, from the lowly can opener to the SUV.

us,Blood Ties and Acts of Love,"As I look at my ever-growing and protruding belly, I find myself fascinated by the biological processes at play: sperm, egg, and a baby being made. I imagine that any woman experiencing this process for the first time would find it, as I do, an exciting but mystifying and often uncomfortable journey. In my own first three months I wondered, Why does anyone go through this?   As an adopted person my context for the way babies come into the world is through adoption, not birth. Of course I understand birth, but that is not the way I came into my family. I did not grow up knowing the people who gave birth to me. But I do not doubt the labor my adoptive parents went through to get me. It consisted of mounds of paperwork and home studies that stretched over two years. I thank God pregnancy is just 9 months.   In anticipating the birth of my child, I feel like an explorer getting ready to delve into a foreign land that is also somehow familiar. I did not grow up in the culture of blood; I grew up in the culture of adoption. The ties that bind me to my family are not based in biology. They are based in relationship.   But for the first time, I and my husband - who happens to also be adopted from South Korea - will, through our child, know what it is to be connected with someone who also shares our genes. And I must admit there is something delicious about finally being a part of the majority.   But it could get complicated. Like when we have to make a family tree. And have to explain how our little Korean child came from Irish, German, English and Italian ancestry. Although our child will look at our faces and will see familiar curves and lines, the extended family will not look as familiar. And so we will have to explain our adoption so our child can understand why grandma has blond hair and grandpa has blue eyes and we don't.   Part of the legacy we will also give our child is the loss of genetic ancestry. We will have to explain why mommy and daddy did not grow up with the parents who gave birth to them and why we got new families. And even though I have met my birth family, I do not know the family history. And knowing the history is not just knowing one's genes, it's knowing the stories going back generations.   Even though I hope to someday bring our child to Korea to meet extended biological kin, my husband and I cannot provide all of the skills needed to be effective in that culture. We don't speak Korean in the home; nor do we cook Korean food regularly. Although we have become very knowledgeable about Korean culture and have connections to the Korean-American community, I wonder about our ability to nurture our child's racial and cultural identity.   I am relieved, though, that my child will not have to answer the question ""Why were you born?"" the way I had to answer the question, ""Why were you adopted?"" I am glad that my child will not be told by well-meaning strangers he or she is ""lucky"" to have been born. And I certainly won't tell my child to be grateful because I brought them into the world. And if my child feels any gratitude toward me I hope it is because I earned it.   It will be important to remind ourselves that it is because of our own needs, not theirs, that we bring children into our lives to parent. Being able to have the gift of a child born to me allows me to reconnect to that which I had lost as a consequence of adoption. But I also know that to also have the gift of a child adopted by me would allow me to continue the culture I most understand -- the culture of adoption.   I anticipate that generations and generations after me will slowly erase my history. They will most likely forget that their great-great-great grandmother had to learn to be Korean. That she came to America at 3 and a half years old in a little red pant suit and vest, and white sweater trimmed in red. That she cried to return to her motherland. And that the mothershe loved had blond hair and the father she loved was an Irishman. Ultimately I want generations after me to know this about the culture of blood and the culture of adoption: That blood is thicker than water, but love can be thicker than blood.

At Jeffrey Deitchs late-night party, there were so many skinny-dipping galleristas that the scene resembled a Spencer Tunick photo Turns out the ripped-from-the-Colosseum Roman soldiers clanking around town are not here for a sword-and-sandals convention but to hype a freshman fair, Roma Contemporary, making its debut in February It seems theres safety in numbers at this years fair. More and more dealers are sharing spaces, forging Survivor-like alliances to avoid being voted off next year, when the fought-after spots are reassessed by the new regime. Mary Boone and Rafael Jablonka from Cologne have the smartest set-up: a room each to do with as they will and a third make-nice space for Eric Fischl, the one artist the two galleries share Massive steroid-charged artwork is not limited to the main fair. It also gets a workout at Pulse, where there is a courtyard stocked with jacked-up sculptures by Jurgen Mayer, Chris Larson and the tattooist-cum-fine artist Duke Reilly. Reillys work is a replica of a revolutionary war submarine called the Turtle, which in truth looks more like an old whisky barrel. The larkish Reilly submerged his work in the Hudson River early this year and attacked the QM2, an offence which got him arrested (the $120,000 tag for the piece includes a video of his capture) Its not just the wholesale appropriation trend that is trying the patience of gallerists. As the circuit hits 23 fairs and counting, FedEx and other couriers cannot handle the volume of art thats zipping round the world. Galleries will soon have to find alternative methods, with many acknowledging that delivery delays have been worse than ever. Some shipments failed to arrive. For the first day, Berlins Galerie Michael Schultz had to make do with a minimalist set up of two canvases (the rest of the booth showed up last night); while a Danish gallery canceled completely when they received word that its shipment wouldnt make it in time. That was good news for on person at least: the booth-less Aussie art collective The Glue Society was promoted into the space to exhibit its waggish light boxes, which show satellite images of what appear to be ancient Biblical scenes.

Beck versus Cooper  the noisy populist versus the dapper mandarin  felt like a class war and a seriocomic switchblade match for the soul of CNN. Cooper kicked things off by introducing Beck half-jokingly as, among other things, a cable news rodeo clown and man of mystery. The first words out of Becks mouth were: I am not afraid of you. Things went downhill  or uphill, depending on your perspective  from there. The men kept smiling but tangled over issues like global warming and immigration. When Cooper said most scientists say yes while asking if man is to blame for climate change, Beck replied: Ooh. Most scientists say yes. Wow. You got me there. Thats why youre on 60 Minutes.  Beck called Cooper Mr. I-Hang-Out-in-Africa and said, So anyway, talk down to me some more. Cooper asked: If Iran is the head of the snake, whos the tail? Becks reply: You. Near the end of the program, Cooper asked: How long does it take for you to spray on your hair? Im just asking. Who won this battle? I dont know.

But when food crops are used as fuel, difficulties may follow. The vogue for corn ethanol has driven up the price of corn around the world, putting the poor in jeopardy. (An expert affiliated with the United Nations went so far as to label the production of biofuels derived from food stock a crime against humanity.)

It was Lowrys fate to fall right in between the two. Coming of age a half-generation after Ulysses, the British-born, Cambridge-educated Lowry wanted to produce not just a novel but a cosmos-surfing, cosmos-swallowing book of books. Under the Volcano takes place in a demi-Joycean 12 hours, on the feast of the Day of the Dead in Mexico, and took Lowry a Joycean 10 years to fully emit. No one would ever call it underdone. Following the last hours in the life of a British dipsomaniac, Under the Volcano embraces everything from Dante to Freud to the cabala. Here it shambles like Cervantes, there it rages like Ahab, and every page of it pulsates on Out of Body Auto-Reply, that style of pure Lowry that points at once backward, to all European literature, and forward, to the mother of all nervous breakdowns.

A Muslim uprising at Cairo resulted in more deaths and, not insignificantly, the loss of any remnant of civility on the part of the French who, invading the Azhar mosque in an effort to crush an insurgency, desecrated the Koran and, as an Egyptian contemporary wrote, soiled the mosque, blowing their spit in it ... and defecating in it.

He was a mid-19th-century equivalent of a Vietnam-era draft dodger, hiding behind his fathers diplomatic frock coat during a war whose outcome had to do with nothing less than the character and destiny of his nation. He all too casually adopted crude stereotypes, especially where Jews were concerned, and evidenced a detachment from the colossal moral issue of slavery unbecoming to an enlightened and perceptive mind. He occasionally revealed himself to be, or to seem to be, an elitist, self-absorbed twit callously indifferent to the cares and woes of lesser mortals. And his outlook on the phenomenon and intricate operation of democracy itself was languid, to say the least, as if previous Adamses had said all that needed to be said on the subject and anything that might follow was mere froth.",2007-12-10T16:25:41+0000

Because no technology had been developed to detect or thwart liquid explosives, the Transportation Security Administration was forced to take, for a time, the draconian step of banning all liquids and gels.

Officials acknowledged that girl had been raped before, in 2002, when she was 7, by several juveniles who did not face court, in the Aboriginal community of Aurukun, where she lived. She was then sent to live with a non-indigenous foster family in Cairns before being returned to Aurukun in April 2006, where she was gang-raped a second time. One welfare officer responsible for sending the girl back has been fired and two others have been suspended, said the Queensland premier, Anna Maria Bligh. The system clearly failed this little girl, she said. Local reports said the state had asked the prosecutor in the gang rape case to stand aside after a court transcript disclosed that he had characterized it as consensual sex. Calls grew for the removal of Judge Bradley, who said the girl had probably agreed to sex. The girl, now 12, is with another foster care family.",2007-12-12T05:00:00+0000

The Academy Award statue, its finish worn from years of handling, had been expected to fetch $800,000 to $1.2 million for its seller, the Dax Foundation, a Los Angeles charity that had planned to use the proceeds for philanthropy. However, a 1940 copy of Welless 156-page script for Citizen Kane, carrying a presale estimate of $120,000, sold for $97,000, including fees, to an unidentified telephone bidder. The seller was a private collector whom the auction house declined to identify. Welles co-wrote, directed and starred in Citizen Kane, his first film, and was also nominated for Academy Awards for best director and best actor in the title role. He won only the prize for screenwriting, which he shared with Herman L. Mankiewicz.

He was attending the final showing in a run of his opera What Next? The work, a sort of musical Waiting for Godot with six singers, was being staged for the first time in New York, Mr. Carters city of origin and his home for many years.The opera is just 40 minutes long, and occupied the second half of the program, which took place at the Miller Theater. The first half consisted of Carter chamber works, ranging from an unaccompanied violin solo to a six-member ensemble.At intermission, a stream of people came up to Mr. Carter, who was seated in an aisle seat in the third row. Many wished him a happy birthday. He signed a compact disc of his music. He accepted an organic chocolate bar from a female admirer, and took a bite. He greeted each person amiably, sometimes leaning forward to hear better.Seated around him were his friends and supporters in the music world, including the bass clarinetist Virgil Blackwell, a musical collaborator and close friend. Charles Rosen, the pianist and scholar who recently wrote about his connection to Mr. Carter in The New York Times, was there. So were other musical satraps, including Joseph Polisi, the president of the Juilliard School, and Ara Guzelimian, the schools dean and a former administrator of Carnegie Hall.After the opera performance, the cast took its bows in a row on the stage. The conductor, Jeffrey Milarsky, a busy specialist in contemporary music, was up there too. Then he gestured for the audience to rise, which it did, and the whole house began singing Happy Birthday to Mr. Carter, who approached the stage, turned and waved to the audience and clapped one hand against the other, which was holding a cane. He had a big smile on his face. Many people cheered.",2007-12-12T16:06:33+0000

us,Clintons Gore Moment,"The big question you hear right now if you cover politics for a living  and thus no one thinks youre really good for talking about more interesting things, like, say, the celebrity version of The Apprentice  is just whats happening to Hillary Rodham Clinton. A month ago Washington had moved on to speculating about her running mate (my guess if she wins Iowa: Tom Vilsack); now shes in a three-way tie in Iowa and losing her lead in New Hampshire faster than Mitt Romney changes positions. Is she seriously in danger of coming undone? Is she still in command of the race? There is an appropriately Clintonian way to answer these questions, which is yes to both.The first presidential campaign I covered was Bill Bradleys 2000 run against Al Gore. (I met my wife on that campaign, so it wasnt a total loss.) People forget this now, but there was a moment, at about this time in 1999, when Mr. Bradley came stunningly close to stealing the Democratic nomination. Mr. Gore was a sitting vice president, with all of the institutional support in the party, as well as the labor unions and the interest groups and the big-money bundlers and the bulletproof limo and, of course, the prosperity and relative peace of the Clinton years at his back. And yet here was Mr. Bradley, three years removed from his last public office, surging to a lead in New Hampshire and gaining so much ground in Iowa, a state in which he hadnt even planned to compete, that his campaign decided to send dozens of staff there. (It was, in retrospect, a huge tactical blunder, but Iowa is like that, tantalizingly within reach one minute and 56,000 square miles of pure quicksand the next.) In those tense weeks, you could almost hear the monstrous machinery of the Democratic establishment squeak as it teetered away from Gore.",2007-12-12T17:35:33+0000

That amount did not account for structural problems at its 1881 flagship Arts and Industries building, which has been closed and empty since January 2004.

us,"Fames Demands, and the Flights of Fancy to Escape","Alvin Ailey had a love-hate relationship with fame. He began his career in dance as a take-charge young artist whose performing and fledgling choreography were fueled more by apparent self-confidence than by deep knowledge of the art form. He had started under the tutelage of Lester Horton, a charismatic dance mentor in Los Angeles, where Ailey grew up. But Horton died, in 1953, too soon to give the would-be dancer much sense of continuity and tradition. Ailey left for New York in 1954 and never stopped, achieving what passes for acclaim in the humble world of dance. That was a burden he both accepted and felt oppressed by. And he eventually identified with artists for whom fame became notoriety. ",2007-12-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Huckabees Compassionate Conservatism," The cover of the Times Magazine this Sunday is a profile of Mike Huckabee by Zev Chafets, a writer whose work Ive always liked. Its a great portrait, rendered skeptically but without cynicism, and I highly recommend it. Whats occurred to me as Ive read stories about Mr. Huckabee over these last few months  Ive not yet met him  is that you can already see how, should he manage to win the nomination, he would deftly steer himself back toward the political center in time for the convention. The outlines of the post-primary Huckabee storyline have already emerged: he raised some taxes over his own partys objections, he refused to deny scholarships to illegal immigrants (a decision he has refused to back away from even if it costs me he election), he came off as too liberal and secular for a lot of his fellow Baptist preachers. These lines from the Huckabee resume have earned him the scorn of some Republican interest groups, most notably the anti-tax Club for Growth, whose idea of state government consists of a couple of prisons and a paving machine, but they would serve him nicely in a general election, where independent voters might shrink from electing another rigid conservative. Campaign reporters always line up to write stories like this, not because they care about making the Mike Huckabees of the world seem kind and gentle, which he may well be, but because we in the media are trained to look for the contradiction of stereotypes  and no one is more gleefully stereotyped in America than the religious conservative. Thus we in the media have historically embraced the story of the Republican governor who, it turns out, isnt as much of a crazy conservative as you might think. Hey, look, the Tin Man has a heart! George W. Bush was a compassionate conservative who worked amiably across the aisle with Democrats. Mitt Romney passed a landmark, bipartisan bill to provide healthcare. Even Ronald Reagan enacted a huge tax increase while governor of California. And so on. ",2007-12-13T18:48:40+0000

The Bush administration has given Al Qaeda the great renown and huge reaction it desires. A successful campaign against terrorism, like those in Peru, Turkey and Britain, she says, requires an effort led by police intelligence units and other arms of the states to isolate the terrorists by empowering nonviolent moderates.

But he has lacked power to act on major issues, and on Saturday thousands of union members marched through Brussels to protest the half-year political impasse and rising fuel and food prices. At the heart of the deadlock are disputes among parties from Dutch-speaking Flanders and the French-speaking area, Wallonia.

But of the 990 organizations that receive money from the $2 billion available to the council, three-quarters will receive increases to match or exceed inflation, and about 80 groups are being added to the roster of recipients. The Royal Opera House and the Royal Shakespeare Company will receive increases to match inflation. Among those told to expect an end to financing are two chamber orchestras, the City of London Sinfonia and the London Mozart Players. The Pop-Up Theater company for children, based in London and in business for more than 25 years, has been told that it is likely to lose its $392,000 grant. Admitting that the holiday-season timing was bad, the Arts Council said tough decisions had to be made. Louise Wylie, its spokeswoman, said the criteria for financing included breadth of audience and excellence of work. Peter Hewitt, the chief executive of the Arts Council, told Arts Industry magazine, Yes, some organizations will be unhappy with our decisions, but the majority will have a stronger, better future. Organizations facing reduction or withdrawal of their grants have an opportunity to appeal.",2007-12-18T05:00:00+0000

Its Saguaro-laced Monument and Pinnacle courses have been rated as Arizona's top two public-access tracks for than 10 years, but the layout routed players in confusing directions. After much soul-searching, Troon Golf executives split up the vaunted Monument layout, pairing its old back nine with the old back nine of the Pinnacle to form a ""new"" Pinnacle course. The ""new"" Monument course comprises the old front nines. Original designer Tom Weiskopf resurfaced the greens and reworked the bunkers to achieve a consistent look throughout. The result is better flow. Gone are the ""Where-in-the-world-am-I-going"" cart rides that slowed up play considerably. Monument is the more spectacular of the two, with gigantic rocks and elevation changes at every turn, but Pinnacle is tougher -- and, in a rarity for the desert, is a walkable course, even if its ninth hole doesn't return to the clubhouse.",2007-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Russia to Lend Art,"One day after announcing that it was canceling plans to lend paintings from its museums to a major exhibition in London, Russia reversed itself after the British government moved up the date on which legislation protecting art from seizure in lawsuits would become effective, The Associated Press reported. The exhibition, From Russia: French and Russian Master Paintings 1870-1925, was scheduled to open at the Royal Academy on Jan. 26. But Moscow refused to lend major French and Russian paintings out of concern that they might be held. (Above, Kuzma Petrov Vodkins 1912 work Bathing of a Red Horse.) Among the paintings to be shown were prominent Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works, which descendants of some Russian collectors claim were taken by the new government after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. James Purnell, head of the British Culture Department, said on Thursday that Britain would move up, to early January from late February, the effective date of a provision in legislation that bars the seizure of art lent on a government-to-government basis. Natalia Uvarova, a spokeswoman for Russias federal culture agency, said that her office would issue licenses for the paintings only after the law takes effect, which means that the Russian works, now in Dusseldorf, Germany, will return to Moscow instead of continuing on to London, she said. It was up to the organizers of the London exhibition, Ms. Uvarova added, to decide whether the paintings could be shipped quickly enough for the show to open as scheduled on Jan. 26.",2007-12-22T05:00:00+0000

The dealer, Fayez Barakat, owner of the Barakat Gallery, said he had bought the works in Europe for about $500,000.

us,Letters: The Readers Speak,"Re A Semi-Nude Minor? In The Times? (Dec. 16): While I can appreciate the fact that T magazine might not have been the most appropriate venue for this photo editorial, it is interesting to see how it has been perceived by so many people.It is also fascinating that people think that they have the right to judge so severely and with such vengeance.Perhaps these are the same people who would not enter an art museum unless the statues were covered in drapes. In Europe, the pictures in question would never elicit the least bit of controversy.There is nothing minor about Ali. She is an old soul who is an extremely intelligent, focused, disciplined, responsible young lady. She is as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. While she is a few months shy of her 18th birthday, she is more mature than most adults twice her age.She has had the good fortune to work with some of the worlds best-known photographers over the past two years, including Paolo Roversi. He is an icon in the fashion industry. While I am with Ali every step of the way, it is not up to me to choose which photographs are to be published. I do not have control over that decision-making process. That said, there is nothing remotely sexual or pornographic about the pictures in the T. In my eyes, they portray a sense of innocence and beauty.To those who have responded to your column by criticizing my daughter and me so vehemently: Please understand that I have my viewpoint, and you have yours. It is unacceptable for you to demand that we think exactly alike, and it is unconscionable that you feel the need to judge or attack while expressing your views. After all, we come from totally different backgrounds and perspectives and are each entitled to our opinions.Art and beauty are in the eye of the beholder. If you dont like what you see, keep in mind that no one is forcing you to look. MaryAnn MichaelColleyville, Tex., Dec. 19, 2007  On the one hand, youre right. I dont read T. On the other hand, now that you bring it up, those photos of that 17-year-old model are not fit for a newspaper with general circulation.Exposing as much as possible of a minors body for commercial gain (but without getting arrested) is immoral, no matter how artful the photography.The Times can find some other way to sell its paper than exploiting even a willing minor whose parents care more about her career than about the character of our culture.J. Christy WarehamNewark, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2007   Jim Schachter, a deputy editor of The New York Times Magazine, justifies his decision to expose a youngsters breast in a fashion spread by blurring the line separating commercial images from art.He acknowledges that sexually charged images sell products, so does he really suffer under the same illusion as the mother of the 17-year-old model, who found the layout to be very artistic in nature? Have we become so cynical that the currency of a young body can be peddled as art even in the most commercial of contexts?Rebecca ReichmannRancho Santa Fe, Calif., Dec. 17, 2007  I guess I am glad I never buy the Sunday Times. Its not so much that I disapprove of the T magazine section (Ive never seen it, I think), but that I would resent paying for it and disposing of it greenly.I do buy and read the daily Times every day, and subscribe to the Book Review. Much of the reason I dont buy the Sunday Times is that there is so much in it I really have no interest in.Emily Ann SchmalzerBrentwood, N.H., Dec. 17, 2007  Ordinarily I automatically dump T in the T-rash without even opening it, along with other glossy ads for things Ill never need or want. But your column prodded me to have a look online at the 17-year-old model posing semi-nude.What a disappointment! Shes no Lolita, just an underweight kid posing in a grown-ups overpriced duds. And that barely perceptible bare breast was so badly out of focus that it registered zero on both the photographic and sexuality meters.The only astonishing thing about the photos was the revelation that a $3,890 Galliano taffeta coat could be worn, as the caption states, as a skirt.No, these photos didnt register as pornographic nor tawdry  nor even edgy. Aaron EpsteinWashington, Dec. 16, 2007  Can fashion photographs be art? The word was used by many cited in your column.I have just viewed the photos of Ali Michael. I find an unmistakable reference to Degas sculpture of the 14-year-old dancer in the focused photo with a taffeta coat: the tied hair, the arms straight behind the back, the use of material in an original way, not to mention the insecurity of youth bravely confronting the hostilities of the world, including that of sexual exploitation.The great difference for these two models is, of course, exposure. Degas model posed in private; the resulting sculpture became the vehicle of expression.Ms. Michael is viewed by millions and is herself, to a far greater extent, the vehicle of expression. Her body has, in a sense, been designed to meet certain criteria of the modeling circuit, achieving that white, emaciated, vulnerable look.My concern for Ms. Michael is that the look of breakable china may go deeper than art or artifice.John DannAmherst, Mass., Dec. 17, 2007The writer is a painter and sculptor.  Gee whiz, the Gray Lady is getting frisky. The soul-searching regarding this issue stands in stark (sorry) contrast to the Mapplethorpe uproar several years ago.At that time, Cincinnati decided that his work would shock and offend the good citizens of Cincinnati. The Times scolded the Queen City for its provincial prudery, in articles and editorials. Its art, not porn, it proclaimed.Maybe yes, maybe no  either way, has The Times yet published even one of the offending photos? I havent seen one.Yes, of course, there are certain standards and unwritten laws (mostly involving advertising revenue) that must be considered  or are there?Give us a break. The Times is way ahead of the field in bowdlerizing words and images, while preaching open-mindedness to the benighted citizenry. Lionel LibsonCamden, Me., Dec. 16, 2007  The bright line T magazine needs to find is not is not one that separates sexually charged images of men and women just short of 18 from art, as Jim Schachter, a deputy editor of the Magazine says, it is the bright line that separates pornography from child pornography. If the model is, or looks, under-age, The Times should do itself and the world a favor. Hire a grown-up. Then readers can decide for themselves whether it is too nasty to have in the house, and editors can decide whether it is too nasty to have in The New York Times.Kathleen A. PoolPortland, Ore., Dec. 16, 2007  The photographs are neither sexy nor tawdry. The model is indeed showing a lot of skin, but she is much too skinny.Yale RichmondWashington, Dec. 17, 2007  You are a brave man. In todays culture, you could be accused of censorship, prudery, proselytizing  a whole host of rocks could be thrown your way. And probably will be. I hope you can duck.The quest for material gain should never intrude on values. Keep explaining this to Jim Schachter, Bill Keller and all those at The Times who dont seem to understand this.Bill FabrizioEast Atlantic Beach, N.Y., Dec. 17, 2007  Your column was much ado about nothing. After refreshing my memory with the pictures, I found the offending photo to be so indistinct as to be inoffensive and meaningless.The real issue was the exploitation of a minor in a semi-nude picture. This is the issue that you should have focused upon, not the poor-quality picture.Michael HermanNew York, Dec. 16, 2007  The Times risks losing its reputation by daring to see how far it can go in prurient appeal. If T magazine leads the way, can we expect its standards will show up in news sections? (News could serve up photos of the yearly naked run of students at Tufts, pictures of a bare breast at the Super Bowl halftime show.)If there are going to be double standards for sections of the paper, perhaps subscribers should be allowed to opt out of receiving T.S. E. SoderlindShort Hills, N.J., Dec. 16, 2007  I fear your column only stokes the fires of censorship by suggesting that art photography in The Times should be held to a different standard for good taste than that appearing in a specialist publication like V simply because The Times is sold to those who dont seek or expect to find such images in their daily newspaper.This notion perpetuates Americas puritanical neurosis about the portrayal of the human form in any medium.While I found Ts photos (and most fashion or lifestyle photography today) to be silly, incomprehensible and pointless, I have no objection to it being offered up to those readers and advertisers willing to pay the big bucks to keep The Times and the industry for luxury products afloat.It would be far more objectionable for The Times to censor creative people who are exploring the edge of good taste to avoid offending a moralistic minority. Those people have nothing better to do than tell everyone else how to live their lives, and they wont be satisfied no matter what you do.Whether the subject is fashion photography or news reportage, most thinking people can decide for themselves what content they want to see in their daily reading. P. Douglas FolkPhoenix, Dec. 16, 2007  The Holiday 2007 T magazine was very disturbing to me. After glancing through it and seeing the article with the young teenager, I was disconcerted by what I considered a step beyond art, pushing the images to a questionable level of good taste.Frankly, the entire issue left a stressed-out, overly commercial, lacking-in-substance impression. If I wished to read this type of magazine, I would buy it. Unfortunately, the past and present issue of T land in my waste basket often with but a glance.It is very revealing when the top editors have become inured to what that edge means to those of us who are not Seventh Avenue-hardened. The cult of the skinny anorexic models has gone too far. If youve ever known a young person who suffers this life-threatening state, it is neither attractive nor appealing.Ruth Mary PollackGuilford, Conn., Dec. 16, 2007  While neither tawdry or pornographic, as you say, the pictures you refer to probably startled quite a few readers, coming as they did in their Sunday morning paper.I do question the contention that content in T pushes limits that the regular paper does not. I recall seeing a photograph accompanying a review of the play Lulu in the Nov. 29 Arts pages. The picture was a highly sexualized young lady (probably not a teen, though, and I recognize that this likely changes the conversation), sitting with her legs spread around a seated man whose pants are around his ankles.I dont point this out to criticize any of the pictures Ive seen in The Times. I am far more inclined to take umbrage at a smug-looking Dick Cheney on Page 1 than any mildly erotic image within separate sections of the paper. I only wish to demonstrate that this sort of eroticism may be more prevalent in your paper than you might think. Ralph W. SiddallDes Moines, Dec. 16, 2007  My children are children no longer. I am more liberal than most, with a particularly strong perspective on censorship, but it is neither the parent nor the political animal in me that is concerned to see these pictures in a Times publication.No matter how seriously editors make decisions when skating the edge of child pornography, they are already over the edge in my book.The Timess willingness to exploit this edge pushes me toward The Wall Street Journal. Its easier to sort out that publications bias than to trust a company that would skim this edge. By sexualizing childhood for the sake of sales, The Times positions itself among a new batch of competitors.Longtime readers want The Times to move with the times, but this move reads as a sign that the Times may be morphing into something unrecognizable to this reader.Pamela MilesNew York, Dec. 16, 2007  I looked at the pictures on the Web site. Although, as Ali Michaels mother said, she may be very modest, her garb and poses cross my line of what we used to call decency.My mother always demanded of me and my siblings that we do nothing in public that we would not do at home. Thats my line, and in my opinion, Ms. Michael crossed it.The Times should not have printed the pictures, regardless of the age of the model.Bill AbbottSaratoga, Calif., Dec. 17, 2007  That glossy magazine The Times throws at us 15 times a year is not part of the culture. Thats just an excuse to make more money for The Times.What happened to the wonderful magazine The Times used to give us at holiday time, showing New Yorkers and visitors the maps of the city and where each great holiday happening would be?Get back to basics and stop the stupid designer nonsense I throw in the garbage. And no more of these culture excuses.Estelle BrunoWest Sayville, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2007  Had I been a responsible editor asked to decide on those photographs, I would have nixed them. But not so much for the sexual suggestiveness as to avoid rewarding the physical child abuse of which they appear to be incontrovertible proof.As my wife instantly observed when I sought her opinion, that poor girl looks starved. The only visible curve on her is the profile of her breast. If shes not anorexic or bulemic, then she is suffering from something else that also needs urgent medical attention.Isnt the fashion industry belatedly recognizing this problem? Should The Times, or any newspaper, be part of the solution instead of the problem?Martin A. DyckmanWaynesville, N.C., Dec. 16, 2007  Those critics have too much time and too little do. Pornography is in the mind of the beholder. They must have filthy minds.Peter J. PeiranoRidgewood, N.J., Dec. 17, 2007Re If Its Fit to Blog, Is It Fit to Print? (Dec. 9):It may have been the correct decision to keep from the printed version of The Times the quote from the book by Scott McClellan, the former White House press secretary, that suggested President Bush had lied to him since Mr. McClellan had already said to Larry King on CNN that he didnt think Mr. Bush had knowingly pressed him to divulge false information.All the fuss over Mr. Bush seems to have eclipsed the fact that Mr. McClellans statement also included Vice President Dick Cheney, Andrew Card, Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.They were not similarly excused by Mr. McClellan on Larry King Live. How about mentioning that in the printed version of The New York Times? And how about a follow-up investigation of the fabulating four by Times reporters?James D. PoissonWakefield, R.I., Dec. 9, 2007  Your analysis of the excerpt from Scott McClellans not-yet-released book about the leak that led to Scooter Libbys conviction raised compelling journalistic issues. But it glossed right over the substantive issue, arguing that the president may not have been one of the five who knew that Mr. McClellan was being asked to lie to the public and that therefore the leak story didnt go to print.Wouldnt the story of the president and his press secretary being lied to by Karl Rove, Scooter Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney and the presidents own chief of staff be front-page news?Mary E. FellowsPortland, Ore., Dec. 10, 2007I have written in before to complain about The Times Magazines use of veryyoung-looking models. This may be the first actual breast, but spreadsfeaturing heavily made-up girls who look 12 or 14, sprawled in provocative,slutty poses are a standard feature of T  thumb through some back issues.Im a Times subscriber in Tucson, and from here, obviously, the standardsof the New York fashion world (not to say the fashions themselves) arefairly incomprehensible. I take The Times to feel as if I know whatsreally going on, and despite some disappointments in the tone andindependence of the coverage, I love the paper and depend upon it. But thisold-hippie, staunchly anticensorship liberal is honestly shocked by theeditors lack of attention to the demi-child-porn in some of your fashionlayouts.If the Times lets fashion photographers, under-age models and their stagemothers decide whats within the bounds of good taste, readers willcontinue to complain and editors will continue to have to explain howimages to delight pedophiles got into their newspaper.Renee DowningTucson, Dec. 16, 2007",2007-12-22T19:36:39+0000

In 2002, Margo Jefferson rhapsodized about the series in an essay for The Times, headlined Harry Potter for Grown-Ups: War, politics, magic, science, individual lives and cosmic destinies are all here. They are not flung together, they are shaped and assembled into a narrative of tremendous pace by a man with a generous, precise intelligence. Similarly, when Christopher Hitchens reviewed the final Harry Potter book for us this summer, he urged bereft muggles to graduate to Pullman. But the books didnt crack our best-seller list until last week, when they finally landed on the childrens series list at No. 4, thanks to the movie version of The Golden Compass, the first novel in the trilogy. Critical acclaim is nice and all, but when it comes to selling books in America, a few things are evidently nicer: Nicole Kidmans face, a Hollywood marketing budget and a healthy dollop of religious controversy.

His flat was in a spanking new and bright red-brick building, with an elevator! He had been ill, and the elevator was a wonderful innovation.

Under an agreement between the museums foundation and a group of investors from Luxembourg, the house will be turned into a museum at a projected cost of $30 million. The former staff quarters will become a 200-seat cinema, and the vaulted cellars will be transformed into a Hollywood street, complete with street lamps, from the 1920s. Until last year the home was occupied by Chaplins descendants. Regularly people used to ring at the door to ask to visit, recalled Michael Chaplin, one of Chaplins sons, who settled there with five of his seven children. They came from China, Latin America, Africa. The museum is scheduled to open at the end of 2009.

Paul never attended these dinners, according to Benton, who also says that Paul has never knowingly met Bill White. Norman Singleton, a congressional aide in Pauls office, says that he met Bill White at a dinner gathering of conservatives several years ago, after which Singleton expressed his indignation at the views espoused by White to the organizer of the dinner.

Richard West Jr., below, the founding director of the Smithsonians National Museum of the American Indian, spent a quarter of a million dollars of institution money on transportation and hotels over four years, the Smithsonian confirmed on Friday. The money was spent on more than 500 days of travel between 2003 and 2007. The dozens of trips, first reported in The Washington Post on Friday, took him to Europe, New Zealand, Indonesia, Singapore and a number of other destinations for speaking engagements, work for other nonprofit organizations and fund-raisers. Linda St. John, a Smithsonian spokeswoman, said that all Mr. Wests travel was approved. He brought in $51 million in fund-raising during that period, she said. While it may seem shocking that he spent $250,000 on travel, realize what the trade-off is and what he gave to the Smithsonian and Native Americans."" Mr. West, in a telephone interview, said, The fact is that the strategic aims of the Museum of the American Indian required that I had these connections to the international community."" Mr. West, 64, a lawyer and historian who is a citizen of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, oversaw the opening of the museum on the National Mall in 2004, as well as the creation of the George Gustav Heye Center for the museum in New York and the Cultural Resources Center in Suitland, Md. He recently retired as director, but remains on the payroll until the end of the year. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, chairwoman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, said she had asked for an accounting of Mr. Wests activities from the Smithsonians board of regents, as well as from the Government Accountability Office. Smithsonian officials have been under scrutiny since spending abuses by the institutions secretary, Lawrence M. Small, came to light this year.

Mexican archaeologists found the ruins, which are about 36 feet high, in the central Tlatelolco area, once a religious and political center for the Aztec elite. Since the discovery of another pyramid at the site 15 years ago, historians have thought Tlatelolco was founded by the Aztecs in 1325, the same year as the nearby twin city of Tenochtitlan, the capital of their empire, which the Spanish razed in 1521. The pyramid, found last month, may have been built as early as 1100, signaling that the Aztecs began to develop their civilization in central Mexico earlier than believed. The timeline is going to need to be revised,"" the archaeologist Patricia Ledesma said.

Chief Judge Mary M. Lisi of United States District Court for Rhode Island on Thursday ordered Maria-Luise Bissonnette to turn over Girl From the Sabiner Mountains,"" above, to representatives of the estate of Max Stern, who died in 1987, stating that his relinquishment of his property was clearly anything but voluntary."" Both sides say that the painting, which has not been authenticated, is by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, a 19th-century artist famous for his portraits of European nobility. One appraiser for Ms. Bissonnette estimated its value at up to $94,000. Mr. Stern inherited his familys art gallery in Dsseldorf, Germany, in 1934, but three years later the Nazis forced him to auction its contents because he was Jewish. He later fled to Canada, where he became a prominent art dealer and worked to reclaim his lost paintings. Ms. Bissonnettes stepfather, Karl Wilharm, a member of the Nazi Party, purchased the painting at the auction; Ms. Bissonnette, who resettled in Rhode Island, inherited it. Mr. Stern left his estate to the McGill and Concordia Universities in Montreal and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, which have continued his work in trying to find his paintings, hundreds of which are still missing. Ms. Bissonnette has said that she and her family did nothing wrong. I have the receipt, she said earlier. My father paid for it.""",2007-12-29T05:00:00+0000

us,Week 17 in Preview: Redskins Control Their Playoff Destiny,"The Washington Redskins can earn a playoff berth by beating the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. But like several other matchups on the final day of the regular season, the outcome will hinge as much on who does not play as on who does.The Cowboys (13-2) clinched home field in the National Football Conference playoffs last Sunday. They have little to gain by going all out against Washington (8-7) and will probably limit the risk to injured players like Tony Romo (thumb).One player who will not be taking part is Terrell Owens, who sustained a high ankle sprain last week. Owens scored all four touchdowns in the Cowboys Week 11 victory against the Redskins (highlights here), taking advantage of a secondary weakened by the absence of safety Sean Taylor. Taylor, who missed the game with a knee injury, was shot and killed a week later. His death, and a season-ending injury to quarterback Jason Campbell, might have led the Redskins to pack it in.Instead, they won three in a row. Now, buoyed by the steady play of Todd Collins, who has not thrown an interception, and Clinton Portis, who has 376 yards from scrimmage in the last three games, the Redskins control their playoff destiny.I dont know of a team  I havent been a part of one  thats overcome this much, Coach Joe Gibbs told reporters.

The book is fiction packaged as mock memoir, the story told in Ruttenbergs distinctive voice: operationally plain, detailed but distanced, present but not always there. The voice is born of the case reports officers like Ruttenberg must generate to document their every move. He describes the traffic on the sidewalks, the buildings and the weather, the e-mail messages and the meetings. As a C/O, or case officer, Ruttenberg is trained to scan the streets behind his car for potential tails, and the faces at a party for potential recruits (known as developmentals). Restlessly and endlessly he scans. Slowly  indeed, it feels almost accidental  his scan begins to register not just the tactical facts of tail or no tail, but also the poverty and misery of his fellow man in the unnamed police state where he serves. He begins to track his own reactions and attractions. Bit by bit, a queasy truth takes hold. The book, though serious and strong, is not a novel in the normal sense. It is, rather, itself an act of espionage, the collected field reports of Ruttenberg meticulously spying on himself.",2007-12-30T05:00:00+0000

In putting together this issue, we shy away from any attempt at being definitive; instead we embrace idiosyncrasy, storytelling and the interests and passions of our editors and writers. This year brought the deaths of many giants of politics and culture, from Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. to Luciano Pavarotti, from Brooke Astor to Ike Turner, from Lady Bird Johnson to Jack Valenti. But we present some of the lesser-known lives: Harry Dent, who quietly consolidated the South for the Republican Party; Andre de Jongh, who, at 24, courageously escorted more than 100 soldiers and civilians out of Nazi-occupied Belgium to safety; Gloria Connors, who taught her son Jimmy how to be an unrelenting champion; Ernest Withers, who, as a black photographer, was able to document the civil rights movement from inside.

Elizabeth Costello reveals its eponymous heroine, a literary celebrity, through a series of lectures given by Costello, their content familiar from essays published previously  by J. M. Coetzee. Thus instructed to conflate Costello with her creator, Coetzees readers encounter her again, in his following novel, Slow Man, which finds Costello taking up residence in the home of the protagonist, Paul Rayment, as he examines his life in the wake of a crippling accident. Like it or not, I will be with you a while yet, Costello informs her reluctant host. Shes brought a hefty typescript with her, and it appears she is the author of Pauls fate, nudging him toward fulfillment. Or is she a product of his imagination? Certain of Costellos exasperated comments to Paul  I did not ask for you  imply she has no more control over their peculiar pairing than does he. Diary of a Bad Year forgoes the conceit of a perfunctorily named and differentiated alter ego by following the late career of Seor C, who, like Coetzee, is a South African writer transplanted to Australia and the author of a novel titled Waiting for the Barbarians.

Coetzee, she wrote in an e-mail message, is never sentimental, and he pushes his characters right up against the problem of mortality and the inescapable cruelty of life. Its not so much that he doesnt spare the reader from pain as that he doesnt spare himself. And then theres the writing, which is clean and stark, beautiful as the desert is beautiful, an ecosystem in which nothing is wasted. Coetzee understands that a writers restraint is the catalyst for a readers emotional response, and his sentences feel less written than rendered, subjected to a heat or pressure that removes all but the essential.

I had once kicked her little dog when it attempted to bite me as I came up the front steps, and for this she took to tormenting me whenever she could. She would rise early and shuffle past my bedroom window in her heavy leather slippers, speaking baby talk to her small dog or singing loudly, making as much noise as possible in order to interrupt my sleep. She broke flowers off their stems, left bits of paper scattered in my garden. Sometimes when my husband and I returned home, she would be waiting for us and lean out her window and call out in a high, shrill voice, ""It's the intelligentsia  the intelligentsia has returned!"" She divided the word intelligentsia into separate syllables, flinging each one down at us as we hurried to open our door.

Five of the Brown children are challenging the will in Aiken County Probate Court in South Carolina. One of the former advisers, Albert H.  Dallas, denied the accusations and called efforts to void the will an act of desperation. One grandchild whose tuition would be paid by trusts created under the will accused his relatives of trying to break the charities to get the money. Most of Browns estate, including his home in Beech Island, S.C., and rights to his image, name and music, would go to the James Brown I Feel Good Trust for the education of needy children in South Carolina and Georgia, as well as to a family trust to educate Browns grandchildren younger than 35.

us,Whose Interests Are Special?," Barack Obama has always excited big Labor and other Democratic constituencies, even if they werent necessarily ready to endorse him for the presidency. Now, though, as Mr. Obama goes all out to undermine a surging John Edwards in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, that cordial relationship is being put to the test. Mr. Obama has essentially charged that Mr. Edwards is a hypocrite because, while Mr. Edwards has said he favors banning unregulated campaign money from outside groups, his campaign is getting millions of dollars worth of assistance from outside contributors  namely unions. Whats remarkable about this line of attack is that, while Mr. Obama is aiming squarely at Mr. Edwards, he also risks alienating some of the most powerful interest groups in Democratic Washington. In case you havent been paying attention, heres whats going on: several state chapters of the mighty Service Employees International Union have endorsed Mr. Edwards and set up an independent entity  the kind of so-called 527 that Edwards himself has decried in the past  to run ads on his behalf. They even hired his 2004 campaign manager, Nick Baldick, to oversee the operation. (The state and municipal workers union and Emilys List are also in Iowa, dropping a lot of cash in support of Hillary Clinton.) Mr. Obama, the only one of the three leading candidates who hasnt received a big union endorsement, has repeatedly called on Mr. Edwards to ask his labor friends to stand down. Mr. Edwards has responded by saying that he still opposes such groups in theory, but that he isnt involved in the union effort and is powerless to control it.",2007-12-31T19:39:44+0000

One year, on Christmas Day, a British Airways gate agent gave me, and even the friend who came to see me off, a free pass to the First Class lounge and an invitation to go wild.
