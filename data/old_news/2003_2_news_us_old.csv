It is for children from kindergarten to third grade. Each month the club offers new selections for each grade plus a newsletter and a colorful Web site (www.nj.gov/bookclub) where participants can download book summaries, puzzles, games, coloring books, book marks and badges. There are also messages from the governor: ''Hi kids: Welcome to my book club.'' Children join on line or with their classes at school. To date, Mr. McGreevey's office says, 58,000 children and more than 1,500 teachers have signed up. The governor hopes the club will help children develop a love of reading. ''We cannot expect our teachers to do this job alone,'' he said. ''The book club provides an opportunity for parents and grandparents, librarians and community members to become involved in our goal of having children read at or above grade level by the third grade.'' The governor picks the books from those that the State Department of Education culls from Scholastic Book catalogs. Companies including Scholastic Book Clubs, PSE&G, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, New Jersey Natural Gas, Pfizer, Washington Mutual and the CIT Corporation are helping to finance distribution of the books to participating schools. The project was Governor McGreevey's idea, his office said, and both Scholastic and the governor's office said they knew of no other state that had such a governor's book club.

And, like his father, he has a compulsion to film family events. Most important, though, just like his dad, Jesse is arrested and charged with molesting boys in the computer class he and his dad taught at the family home.

us,This Dream Is Not for Sleeping,"Described as the '' 'funny house' of tomorrow,'' Salvador Dal's pavilion for the 1939 New York World's Fair was commissioned largely as a diversion from the Depression and news of imminent war overseas. In exhibits including a boudoir (or mausoleum) of flowers, mirrors and fuchsia satin in which a topless sleeping beauty lay ensconced; an aquatic diorama of nymphs swimming past a body-painted wax nude; and an ivy-encrusted taxi with Columbus in its back seat and cheesecake sirens recumbent on its hood and roof, the ''Dream of Venus,'' which opened mere days after Franco's victory in Spain, Dal's homeland, offered an opulent visual alternative to the nightmare of modern alienation and war. SALVADOR DAL'S DREAM OF VENUS: The Surrealist Funhouse From the 1939 World's Fair (Princeton Architectural, $60), presents a trove of photographs, recently unearthed from the estate of the photographer Eric Schaal, of the pavilion and its creation. The individual images, many in color, of the tableaux vivants and the scenes ''backstage'' are often striking and reassert the work's strangeness -- Surrealism for the masses. Yet their presentation is stilted in book form, accompanied by Irene Schaffner's essay detailing the exhibit's preparation, financing and reception. The tension between the curatorial impulse to contextualize, and the immediate, inarticulable response the ''Dream of Venus '' sought to evoke, tends to undermine both.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  KEELER, ROBERT TEMPLE","KEELER - Robert Temple, noted Ohio lawyer, philanthropist, corporate director and World War II Navy veteran, died on December 19, 2002 of complications from a stroke suffered at his country home in Dorset, Vermont. He was 88. Keeler was born in Cleveland on August 3, 1914, the day Germany declared war on France, invaded Russia, and ignited the First World War. A man of wry humor and acerbic wit, he sometimes described his birth as ''the second calamity of the day.'' Keeler graduated Magna cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Dartmouth in 1936, and earned his LL.B from Yale in 1939. He soon joined the Cincinnati law firm of Taft, Stettinius & Hollister, founded by Robert Alphonso Taft, eldest son of William Howard Taft, 27th President and 10th Chief Justice of the United States. Later a U.S. senator, conservative Republican icon, and contender for the presidency, Robert Taft became a mentor and friend to his brilliant young associate. In 1942, Keeler enlisted in the Navy as an ensign and after 2-1/2 years in the Pacific and the Aleutians was discharged as a lieutenant (j.g.). He was made a partner at T.S.& H. in 1953, and gained renown as a trial and an appellate court lawyer during his 43 years with the firm. A scion of the Temple family of east Texas, Keeler also worked with his first cousin, Arthur Temple, Jr., to build the timber business developed to 7,000 acres by their grandfather, Thomas Louis Latane Temple, into the halfmillion-acre East Texas Pulp & Paper Company, which became a principal supplier to Time Inc. When the media conglomerate merged with Eastex in 1973, Keeler and his cousin joined Time Inc.'s board of directors, resigning ten years later in vehement protest of Time's merger with Warner Brothers. Keeler was married twice, first to Florence Field Mithoefer of Cincinnati in 1940, with whom he had five children. After his divorce in 1975, he wed Margaret Palmer Mithoefer of Dorset, Vermont. In addition to his widow, Keeler is survived by his sister Virginia of Green Lake, WI, his cousin Arthur Temple Jr. of Diboll. TX, and by four children, all of California-David, of Slovang; Tanny Keeler-Hodgetts of Santa Barbara; Alison Keeler Carrillo of Santa Cruz; and Melissa Keeler Morris of Santa Barbara. In 1982 Keeler retired from the Taft firm and concentrated on his interest in travel and the arts. He was elected to the Board of Directors of the Cincinnati Art Museum, and with his wife Margaret, endowed part of the renovation of Cincinnati's historic waterfront, as well as the Mary R. Drury Chair of History at the Seven Hills School; he gave the John Whitman Keeler Memorial Theater to the Cincinnati Country Day School in honor of his younger son who had predeceased him in 1993; and he renovated and endowed the golf course at Dartmouth College. Although he and his wife maintained a river-view condominium in Cincinnati, his ''box seat on the Ohio'', they spent most of his later years at their home in Vermont, where Keeler continued his avid enthusiasm for golf well into his 86th year. A memorial service will be on March 7th at 3PM at the Christ Church in Cincinnati, Ohio.

us,'Making Things Better'," Herz had a dream which, when he awoke into a night that was still black, left him excited and impressed. He dreamed that he had received a call from his cousin, Fanny Bauer, the love of his life. He was to take her to the cinema, she ordained. Eager to conform to her wishes, as he always had been, he shrugged on his coat, and within seconds was elsewhere, as was the norm in dreams of wish-fulfilment. Although it was a weekday afternoon the cinema was so crowded that they had to stand at the back of the auditorium. Fanny was as he had always known her and still remembered her: petulant, with the petulance of a spoilt pretty woman, demanding and discontented. Shortly after the beginning of the film she had clutched his arm and declared that she felt unwell. Again, without transition, they found themselves in the vast cafe that was part of the cinema complex. Fanny had recovered somewhat but looked uncharacteristically dishevelled, with a large camel-hair coat slung over her shoulders. He was conscious of retaining his eager smile, but felt discomfited. This feeling had something to do with the coat, which he recognized as his own, the coat he should have been wearing. He had no memory of having offered it to her. The coat, and Fanny's malaise, remained closely associated in his mind. It was only when he understood that it was he who had been taken ill that the dream attained its peak of significance. Ailing, smiling, he had offered her his remaining health and strength, and she, not in the least grateful, had carelessly dispossessed him, not noticing that she had done so. This was so akin to their real life association that, if anything, his newly awakened self was conscious of its reality. Brought back to himself he was aware of the smile-of complicity, of acquiescence-directed to the corners of the dark bedroom. Only the relentless ticking of his clock informed him that he had woken up, that this would soon be a new day, all too closely resembling the others, the normal days of his present existence, in which nothing happened nor could be expected to happen.

Gandhi was then 78 and a forlorn figure. He had been unable to prevent the bloody creation of Pakistan as a separate homeland for Indian Muslims. The violent uprooting of millions of Hindus and Muslims across the hastily drawn borders of India and Pakistan had tainted the freedom from colonial rule that he had so arduously worked toward. The fasts he had undertaken in order to stop Hindus and Muslims from killing one another had weakened him, and when the bullets from an automatic pistol hit his frail body at point-blank range, he collapsed and died instantly.

Forsee, to the Sprint Corporation. The hearing, scheduled for tomorrow afternoon at the Superior Court of Fulton County in Atlanta, was requested by BellSouth after its lawyers obtained a restraining order over the weekend preventing Mr. Forsee from taking the job of chief executive at Sprint. BellSouth has said Mr. Forsee's employment contract prevents him from working for a competitor for 18 months after he leaves the company. A Sprint spokesman said yesterday that the company still expected Mr. Forsee to take its chief executive job after its legal differences with BellSouth were resolved. Sprint shares rose 36 cents, or 3 percent, to $12.50. BellSouth shares rose $1.02, or 4.5 percent, to $23.80. &#0160;&#0160; Simon Romero (NYT) ",2003-02-04T05:00:00+0000

Ruling in a lawsuit brought by The New York Times, he said the city must release the Fire Department's internal radio transmissions and the factual portions of its oral histories of Sept. 11. But the city can withhold intra-agency advice from the records, he wrote. He also ruled that the tapes of 911 telephone calls made on that day must remain largely confidential because of the callers' privacy interests. The judge, however, ordered the release of those portions of the tapes involving relatives of nine families who moved to join the suit, and those portions consisting of the words of the 911 operators.

us,Technology Briefing: Hardware," 3 COMPANIES TO MAKE GAMES FOR NOKIA Nokia, the No. 1 mobile phone maker, said that Eidos P.L.C. , Activision Inc. and THQ Inc. would develop games for its hand-held video game player as it tries to increase revenue by taking market share from Nintendo . Nokia will start selling the N-Gage player, which also doubles as a mobile phone, in the fourth quarter, Pekka Rantala, a vice president at Nokia's handset unit, said in an interview. Sega and Taito have previously said they would cooperate with Nokia. The games by established developers will help Nokia challenge Nintendo, whose Game Boy Advance dominates the hand-held player market, analysts have said. Nokia is expanding outside traditional cellphones after its revenue slid in 2002, for the first time in a decade. The N-Gage phone will allow users to play video games on their own or against others within a range of 33 feet, connected by wireless Bluetooth technology. &#0160;&#0160;(Bloomberg News) ",2003-02-06T05:00:00+0000

Two Detroit-area brothers were convicted last year of smuggling cigarettes from North Carolina to Michigan, manipulating state tax differences to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for the militant group Hezbollah. Eleven new indictments in that case were made public this week, including charges against Elias Akhdar, 30; Hassan Makki, 41; and Salim Awde, 45. All had listed residences in southeastern Michigan, and were of Lebanese descent. The United States Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Michigan said Mr. Akhdar and Mr. Makki have taken part in military exercises with Hezbollah.

us,"36 Hours | Lake Placid, N.Y.","IN any trip to Lake Placid, there will be a moment when you catch yourself thinking: Do you believe this little place was the host of two Olympic Games? Not because something so symbolic and global does not fit in a tiny upstate New York village of 3,000, but, more striking, because it will dawn on you that it is the perfect place. While the Olympics have become outsized, intimate Lake Placid retains ties to simpler times, be it 1932, when the Winter Games first came to visit, or 1980, a time remembered fondly by Americans for the Miracle-on-Ice United States hockey team. Still, a visit is less about the Olympics as they were than about life as it was. Lake Placid has the rhythm of a small town, albeit one with the sophistication to have played host to the world, and its pace is spiked by active people who embrace the mountain and lake setting that has attracted visitors for centuries. In the end, at least occasionally, you have to buy into the Olympic motto -- Swifter, Higher, Stronger -- and just go with it. Oh, and hold on for dear life. BILL PENNINGTON",2003-02-07T05:00:00+0000

The officers, who call themselves the True Rank and File, are hoping to replace the leadership of the union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. They filed a complaint stating that the union's president, Patrick J. Lynch, was trying to weaken their campaign by refusing to immediately release the list.

President Kennedy encouraged the endeavor on the first show, which also featured Colonel Chuck Jaeger, the first pilot to break through the sound barrier. In Italy, he created the first non-governmental TV show ''M'ama, Non M'ama'' (Love Me, Love Me Not) which was Number 1 on Italian Television for three years. In addition to the television shows, he also produced children's record albums for RCA Victor, featuring stars such as Joan Crawford, Jimmy Stewart, Danny Kaye, et al. ''Rootie Kazootie'', a TV favorite with children for several years, also became a series of Golden Books, distributed throughout the U.S. and Europe.

As a little boy, Mandela watched his family lose their cattle and their land because his father, a Thembu chief, would not recognize British authority, yet he sent his son to a British-style school, where he exchanged his birth name, Buti, for Nelson. At the ritual marking his passage into manhood, he heard a speech that determined the course of his life.

us,Ladybugs by the Can,"In his promising first collection, GOBLIN FRUIT (Context Books, $23), David Marshall Chan offers up melancholy fables from a pop-culture California childhood. The title story finds the narrator pitching a screenplay that's a twisted variant on ''E.T.'': goblins steal a town's children and feed them a fruit that makes them forget who they are. (It's ''like 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' meets 'Aliens' meets the Persephone myth as written by Clive Barker,'' he helpfully notes.) For Chan, writing is the breadcrumb trail leading back out of the dark forest of adulthood into the brighter but no less sinister light of youth. Inspired by fairy tales as well as more modern mythologies like comic books, after-school specials and professional wrestling, ''Goblin Fruit'' centers on transformation. An actor assumes the identity of his brother, killed years ago on a movie set; an Asian-American teenager recreates himself as a white-bread boy detective; seven Chinese brothers metamorphose into seven swans. Short on plot but long on atmosphere, these tales rarely follow a traditional narrative path. Instead, Chan strings together images and the reflections they provoke. Unfortunately, he doesn't always have the pacing (or the prose) to make this structure work. Some stories are overlong, and a stronger editing hand could have made this a much better book. But his images remain haunting: ashes from a fatal apartment fire, falling like snow; a cloud of red ladybugs loosed from a can (''A dazzling waterfall of reds and oranges and shades in-between showered down onto the sidewalk in slow motion, a slow parade of winged marchers falling through the air''). Los Angeles has always been a city bathed in fantasy; in Chan's hands, however, the prevailing mood is less Disney than Grimm. Mary Park",2003-02-09T05:00:00+0000

At best, it is inefficient as lawyers must puzzle over the meaning of the foreign phrases and arcane historical references; at worst, it creates a risk that the decision will be misconstrued. Since a written opinion is a guide to future action, it should strive to be understandable to lawyers and clients.

""You will see us introduce a push-to-talk product well before the end of the year,"" the company's chief executive, Dennis Strigl, said yesterday at an investor conference in New York. Verizon Wireless joins rivals like Alltel in trying to match the walkie-talkie technology that has made Nextel unique in the mobile phone industry. Investors and analysts have said the popularity of that product among business customers helped Nextel increase sales and add subscribers at a faster pace than competitors last year. Shares of Nextel, the fifth-largest United States mobile phone company by customers, fell 45 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $12.31. Nextel phones include a technology developed by Motorola , the big maker of mobile phones, that lets customers talk to another person or a group of users by pushing a button, rather than dialing a number. Verizon Wireless does not trade publicly. The company is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc., the largest United States local phone company, and the Vodafone Group of Britain, the world's biggest mobile phone company.

Investors and analysts have said the popularity of that product among business customers helped Nextel increase sales and add subscribers at a faster pace than competitors last year. Shares of Nextel, the fifth-largest United States mobile phone company by customers, fell 45 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $12.31. Nextel phones include a technology developed by Motorola, the big maker of mobile phones, that lets customers talk to another person or a group of users by pushing a button, rather than dialing a number. Verizon Wireless does not trade publicly. The company is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc., the largest United States local phone company, and the Vodafone Group of Britain, the world's biggest mobile phone company.",2003-02-14T05:00:00+0000

During that time, he also taught at the N.Y.U. School of Medicine and Hunter College-Bellevue School of Nursing, and maintained a part-time private practice.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; They Kept On Truckin',"Starting around 1963, underground comics constituted satiric and ribald alternatives to mainstream comic books and found an enthusiastic audience among young people. They also opened a frontal attack on the Comics Code Authority, which had been established in 1954 to enforce editorial standards, prohibiting visual and written depictions of crime, horror, violence, race, politics, and sex (war, however, was acceptable). The new comix (the ''x'' suggested both unconventional and taboo themes) began as mimeographed handouts, then found outlet as pages or spreads in underground tabloid newspapers, then were ultimately published as comic books and sold through head shops and record stores and on the streets. ''These cartoons were perceptive reflections of the antiwar, antiestablishment fervor of the times,'' Patrick Rosenkranz writes in his profusely illustrated and thoroughly detailed history, REBEL VISIONS: The Underground Comix Revolution, 1963-1975 (Fantagraphics, $39.95). Rosenkranz, a filmmaker who has chronicled the comix for decades, proceeds with a year-by-year narrative, using interviews with scores of publishers, editors and leading artists, including Gilbert Shelton, Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso, R. Crumb, Kim Deitch, Trina Robbins, S. Clay Wilson and Art Spiegelman. As a movement comprising iconoclasts with individual styles and obsessions, underground comix transformed banal comics into hilariously raucous and often perverse social commentaries and inspired film, literature and the graphic novel, which today is hard to call underground.

us,READYING RELIEF FOR IRAQIS,"Representatives of 29 countries and 21 aid groups warned of devastating humanitarian consequences of a war in Iraq as they ended a two-day meeting in Geneva over the weekend aimed at preparing relief efforts in case of a conflict. Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey, who organized the meeting on behalf of the Swiss government, said in her opening comments that faced with the numbers of Iraqis who could be injured, killed or made refugees in a war, ''inaction and indifference cannot be permitted.'' Absent from the meeting was the United States, which declined an invitation saying its relief planning has been under way for several months. All other Security Council members, as well as states neighboring Iraq, were represented. Iraq was not invited, organizers said, because of an effort to avoid politicizing the event. Issues on the agenda included caring for distressed civilians, ensuring that humanitarian laws are respected, assessing environmental damage and helping neighboring countries share the burden of the huge number of refugees expected to flee during and after any war. The United Nations has estimated that in the event of a war, around two million Iraqis would be forced to leave their homes, while anywhere between 500,000 and 1.5 million would flee the country altogether. Further, Iraq's current level of food supplies are expected to last no more than six weeks from the start of a war, and drinking water supplies could be affected immediately.

us,Nokia-Led Group Forms Cell-Phone Alliance With Samsung," CANNES, France, Feb. 17 -- Symbian Ltd., the British phone software consortium led by Nokia Oyj, got a financially small but symbolically important endorsement today from the Samsung Electronics Company, the aggressive South Korean maker of cell phones. Samsung acquired ownership of 5 percent of Symbian for 17 million, or more than $10 million, in its first minority investment outside of South Korea. Some telecommunications industry analysts said the move would help give the British group's systems a major role in the next generation of cell phones. Samsung joins the other four top mobile phone manufacturers as part owner of Symbian, entitling it to a seat on the board. The move intensifies Symbian's rivalry with the Microsoft Corporation for future control of the software that runs cell phones. The price paid values Symbian at 340 million, up from 285 million a year ago, when Siemens A.G .of Germany purchased a 4.8 percent stake in the company. ''Clearly, all the shareholders felt the value had increased,'' David Levin, chief executive of Symbian, said today. The deal was announced at the 3GSM World Congress for the wireless industry in Cannes, a day after Microsoft announced an alliance with T-Mobile, which agreed to use Microsofts operating systems in an advanced phone to be released this summer. ''For Symbian, it's good because there have always been lingering doubts about it,'' said Lars Vestergaard, analyst for the International Data Corporation. ''And Samsung is showing it's being bold enough to drive things in the market.'' The T-Mobile and Samsung deals also demonstrate that the next business model for the cell phone world has not yet become clear. While Microsoft is courting mobile phone operators like Orange S.A., Symbian has pursued the hardware makers. The split shows that customers around the world are divided over whether their loyalty is to the brand name on the phone itself or to that of the company that provides the mobile services. ''In the next year, there will be a tug of war over who owns the customer,'' said Juha Christensen, corporate vice president for mobility at Microsoft. Microsoft's research shows Europeans buy for the handset name, while Japanese and Koreans are wedded to their service providers, like NTT DoCoMo Inc., he said, adding that Americans are split. Both the Microsoft and Symbian factions argue that their approach will bring simplicity and uniformity to the use of cell phones at a time when the phones' functions are growing more diverse and complicated. Mobile phones can now send photos, show video and e-mail spreadsheets, for example, and carriers are counting on more such uses over so-called third-generation networks to drive revenue in saturated markets. To be safe, Samsung is covering its bets. It has licensed both Microsoft's software and that of Palm Inc. for different versions of its phones for different buyers. Sang Jin Park, Samsung executive vice president, has said the company believes ''the victor will be decided by the market. ",2003-02-17T05:00:00+0000

Roundup was safe, effective and relatively benign, environmentally speaking. It became one of the essential tools that made no-till farming -- a conservation practice in which farmers spray weeds rather than plowing the ground -- increasingly popular. But what really made Roundup pervasive was the development of genetically modified crops, especially soybeans, cotton and corn, that could tolerate having Roundup sprayed directly on them. The weeds died but these crops, designated Roundup Ready, thrived. Seventy-five percent of the soybean crop planted in this country last year was Roundup Ready, as was 65 percent of the cotton and 10 percent of the corn.

''Most of the price increase is to cover costs,'' Mr. DiMicco said in an interview. Nucor, which makes steel from recycled metal like junked cars, said the cost of that scrap rose 19 percent last quarter. Rivals like U.S. Steel and AK Steel Holding will probably try to match Nucor's higher price for sheet, which is used in cars and appliances and is the most common steel product, analysts said. Domestic steel companies have been able to raise some prices because of import tariffs, the dwindling number of competitors, and demand from overseas. Mr. DiMicco said the first-quarter average price for steel sheet will be about the same as the fourth-quarter price of $349 a ton. Adding $30 to that price in the second quarter would result in an increase of about 8.6 percent.",2003-02-19T05:00:00+0000

Virtual PC software is crucial for Apple Computer because it permits corporate users to run Windows-based applications that do not exist for the Macintosh. Of greater interest to Microsoft, Connectix has developed a similar product for Windows-based PC's that permits computer users to run multiple operating systems, including Linux, simultaneously. The Silicon Valley company also recently entered the market for server computers used by corporations. The software permits a single Intel computer to simultaneously run a variety of operating systems, including Windows 2000 Server, Unix and Linux.

Home to the Canyon Ranch and the Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health, it is also summer headquarters for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, which performs at Tanglewood. The Gilded Age equivalent of the Hamptons, Lenox offers sweeping vistas and mild summer weather that, in the 19th century, brought Vanderbilts, Carnegies and Westinghouses to the Housatonic River valley to build showy villas that they called Berkshire cottages. Along with the Mount, above, Edith Wharton's magnificent house, many of those enormous houses are still standing -- some as inns, others as private homes. A hundred and fifty years after this mill and farming village was discovered by swells, it is a town with an air of luxe, calm and voluptuous pleasure.

us,'Almost There'," IF I HAD BEEN ASKED TO REPORT ON middle age when I was halfway through my fifties, I would have said that it was too bleak to talk about. Much too bleak if you believed, as I passionately did, that your life has been a failure. I seemed successful, I knew-I was an opinion columnist with an Irish newspaper, and columnists are not nobodies. But when I looked at the private side of my life, all I could feel was regret, and all I could see was what was missing. I had no child, and no other creation. I didn't have a partner. I didn't have a lover, however provisional, and I didn't have any appetite for one. I occasionally saw my sisters and brothers who lived near me, but I didn't think of them as a resource for everyday living. Our father had been a big fish in a small pond because he was the first journalist in Dublin to write a daily social diary about the receptions and parties and formal events that happened around the town every night. His dapper, charming figure, usually wearing evening dress, had been welcome everywhere he went. Not so, my poor mother. She was a shy, lonely woman, the inefficient manageress of wherever we happened to be living, a bookworm who, when she added drinking to reading, could escape the reality of nine children and a husband she was in love with but could not trust. Over the years, we watched our father become more sought after and our mother become a hopeless alcoholic. Worry about her became a bond between us when she was left a widow, but once she died too, the family didn't seem to have any function. Anyway, I felt that at the age of fifty-five I shouldn't be depending on the family I came from; I should have made a circle of my own. As it was, I didn't even have the company of colleagues in a workplace because I wrote my columns from home. And the truth was that I made no effort to find company. Every night I quietly drank just a bit too much wine, and other people would have interfered with that. There were only ten years to go till retirement from the paper. But what would I retire for? I had no savings, and because I'd only just joined the staff I wasn't going to have much of a pension. I had no plans anyway. My job with The Irish Times was much the best thing I had.

The New York painter and primate lover Hunt Slonem has been including them in his signature flora-and-fauna canvases for 30 years. He once shared a downtown loft with Shanti, Lakshmi and Hanuman, the squirrel monkeys depicted here (a) in a recent oil painting. (Needless to say, the landlord said, it's them or you.) Meanwhile, the red-hot winner of the Turner Prize, Chris Ofili, did a twist on the Last Supper in his London show last summer with 12 lushly painted monkey ''apostles'' surrounding a monkey ''Jesus.'' And if that's not wacky enough, there is Donald Roller Wilson's old-master style monkeys (b), which are collected by such Hollywood heavyweights as Carrie Fisher, Robin Williams and Kevin Kline (www.donaldrollerwilson.com).",2003-02-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Knit Picking,"When she was in her early 20's, Anne Rubin went to Paris on holiday, and her father, who was a furrier in Beverly Hills, asked her to buy him a white beaded handbag to accessorize the coats in his shop. It was around 1950 -- Rubin, who is now in her 70's, is vague on dates -- and she disparaged the idea of purchasing anything as dull as a white beaded bag. ''I thought, Oh, how corny,'' she recalled recently in her showroom in the garment district in Manhattan. A onetime model, Rubin wore black leggings and a long black T-shirt, but her beautiful face was expertly made up, and her blond hair was carefully poufed around a black headband. ''I thought, My father can go down the street to Saks and get something ordinary like a beaded bag. Instead, I saw these bags made out of religious tapestries, and I took three back to my hotel in Paris.''",2003-02-23T05:00:00+0000

us,The Enemy Was Everyone,"Given the current political climate in Zimbabwe, it takes guts to write a novel like THE STONE VIRGINS (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $18) -- the story of two wars, two women and the horror of violence that becomes institutionalized. Yvonne Vera sets her narrative in Kezi, a small village in the Matabeleland region, during the years before and after Independence. ''To be in Kezi, to be in the bush, is to be at the mercy of misfortune,'' she writes, describing the plight of rural communities during a guerrilla war. Still, at first the enemy is easy to identify, and so are the heroes: the men ''who have returned from the war with all their senses intact, except for that faraway, traveled look that makes the girls a bit fearful'' and the ''female soldiers marked with unknowable places on their own faces.'' Independence brings no peace, however; for Zimbabwe plunges almost immediately into civil unrest, and the villagers are victimized by those who once liberated them. Now the lyricism Vera employed so movingly to delineate the suffering of the freedom fighters acts like a klieg light, exposing carnage motivated simply by brutality for its own sake. Unfortunately, the strength of Vera's style is also this novel's weakness. Her prose is so densely poetic, her opening chapters so preoccupied with ambience, that at times it is almost impossible to discern what she is talking about. This is a shame, because once she grounds her language in the lives of the sisters Thenjiwe and Nonceba, ''The Stone Virgins'' turns out to be about something very important indeed.

The unit, which carries wireless phone calls for the Sprint Corporation in four Midwestern states, accused Sprint in a lawsuit of contributing to its problems. The company sought protection from creditors in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Atlanta after failing to persuade Sprint to come to its aid. The Chapter 11 filing listed $253.5 million in assets and $378.4 million in debts, including $187 million of bonds. The separate suit, also filed in the bankruptcy court, accused Sprint of breaching the terms of their affiliate agreement. ''Over the past two years,'' iPCS said in the lawsuit, ''as financial conditions have become more difficult generally in the telecommunications industry, Sprint has increasingly sought to insulate itself against those worsening conditions by abusing the power it has over its affiliates.'' Sprint miscalculated what it owed iPCS and withheld payments, the suit said. The Airgate unit serves more than 235,000 Sprint PCS customers in parts of Illinois, Michigan, Iowa and Nebraska. ''We have not seen the complaint, so we can't comment specifically,'' said Dan Wilinsky, a Sprint spokesman. ''Generally speaking we have adhered to our contract with iPCS, and the Sprint network in iPCS territory will continue to operate.''",2003-02-25T05:00:00+0000

By suggesting that genes are encoded by the order of chemicals on two complementary strands of molecules wound around each other in a double helix, they laid the foundation for the modern science of the gene, with all its hopeful and Orwellian aspects.

Shares of Printcafe rose as much as 41 percent. The offer of $3 a share would be a ''substantial premium'' to an offer from another company, Creo said. Creo had said on Jan. 22 that it had an agreement to pay $1.30 a share to increase its holdings in Printcafe to 55 percent. Before the bidding began to affect the value of Printcafe shares, its stock price had been most affected by a relatively high level of debt, Tad Piper, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said. Creo holds about $11.8 million of Printcafe's debt, and the payment is due in the first part of 2004 in one payment, Printcafe's chief financial officer, Joseph Whang, said in an interview. The company's total debt is about $20.7 million, with about $5 million due more than a year from now, he said. Shares of Pittsburgh-based Printcafe rose 84 cents, or 35 percent, to $3.24.

The delays began with Spiegel's annual filing for 2001, which was submitted on Feb. 4. Spiegel told the agency that the delays were caused by talks with lenders over defaulted debt and the auction of a credit card business. The notices of delay did not say that Spiegel's auditor, KPMG, had doubts about Spiegel's viability, the company said in the filings.

The legislative map, which is subject to court approval, applies to the election in November. Although there are more Republican voters than Democratic voters in Nassau, the Democrats won control in 1999 in a rebellion against what critics called fiscal mismanagement. Democrats say that the old legislative lines concentrated their voters into a few districts and gave Republicans a wide margin in the rest, while the new lines would give Democrats a better chance to win one or two more seats.
