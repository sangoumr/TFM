Share earnings and shares outstanding have been adjusted to reflect the 4-for-1 stock split distributed on Oct. 10, 1989 to stockholders of record on Sept. 15, 1989. Effective Jan. 1, 1988, the company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 96, accounting for income taxes, and changed its method of computing deferred income taxes from the deferred method used in prior years.

Pastry shops quote prices according to the number of servings and the elaborateness of the decorations. Catering halls and hotels usually charge a flat per-person price for a wedding cake, often including it as part of a package. Some halls and hotels allow cakes to be brought in from the outside, sometimes charging a service fee. Some are willing to order the cake from a specialty baker, who calculates the size of a cake based on a generous slice. Prices range from $2.25 to $3 a person for a ready-made cake to more than $15 a person for an elaborate custom-decorated one. Prices are higher in major cities, especially New York, Washington and Los Angeles. Here is a rough guide: $ Servings Tiers Cost 50 2 $150 to $750 100 2 to 3 $250 to $1,500 150 2 to 4 $375 to $2,500 200 3 to 4 $450 to $3,500",1990-02-03T05:00:00+0000

Last week Mr. Hakim was fined $5,000 and put on two years' probation. And, as he is accustomed, he will make a profit on the deal. In return for dropping his claim on $7.3 million in proceeds from the operation, in which Pentagon weapons were sold to Iran at inflated prices to finance the Nicaraguan contras, he will get to split the leftovers, $1.7 million, with two Swiss men who helped set up the secret accounts. By abandoning his claim on the money, Mr. Hakim ''simplifies things considerably,'' said a spokesman for Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent prosecutor in the case. But Mr. Hakim was not feeling appreciative. ''I have been abused by two presidents,'' he said. ''I'm talking about President Reagan and President Walsh.

With its wordless metaphoric power, dance is capable of suggesting as much if not more than the relationship of two people sharing a stage in an aria or as characters who talk of their love. Nineteenth-century Romantic ballet sent one message, with its idealization of women. Another message, though not an entirely different one, has come from Martha Graham and the women who act and men who serve as catalysts for action in some of her signature modern dances.",1990-02-04T05:00:00+0000

His death a few days ago at the age of 94 brings to a close a life of extraordinary breadth, sweep, ambition and passion. Our century has had no other figure like Lewis Mumford: essayist, historian of culture and technology, literary critic and surely the greatest architecture critic of our age. His life was committed to the idea that scholarship is not a mere assemblage of facts but a guidepost for civilization. To Lewis Mumford, writing was a means of setting out a moral compass: he had no hesitation about playing a role that was part preacher. He wrote history not to entertain us but to tell us how to live, and nearly everything he produced had a touch of the sermon about it. Perhaps that is why his short critical essays please more than his book-length works, for his temperament was really less that of the historian than that of the critic, searching always for the points at which scholarly insights intersected with contemporary life.",1990-02-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Down Londons Mean Streets,"MARTIN AMIS IS probably fiction's angriest writer. In Britain, with its long and decorous literary tradition, his voice stands out discordantly from the rest like a boom box at a harpsichord recital. His urban satires have provoked extreme reactions in Britain, none more so than his latest, most ambitious novel, ''London Fields.'' Although mysteriously absent from this year's nominations for the Booker Prize, England's most prestigious literary award, the book is in the midst of a long run near the top of the best-seller list and has triggered phenomenal media attention. In recent years, Amis has become an outright literary star - an anomaly in Britain. But then, his prose is probably more American than British in its energy and raucousness. For many critics, Amis's comic talent is unrivaled, but for others, mostly older and conservative readers, he is a malevolent harpie, with morbid, vaguely unpatriotic interests. Intriguingly, his father is Kingsley Amis, one of Britain's original Angry Young Men of the 1950's, now a Thatcherite Conservative.

us,  NONFICTION,"NIGHTMARE IN RED: The McCarthy Era in Perspective. By Richard M. Fried. (Oxford University, $22.95.) ''There was far more to the 'McCarthy era' than Senator Joseph R. McCarthy,'' Richard M. Fried observes. ''Beset by Cold War anxieties, Americans developed an obsession with domestic communism that outran the actual threat and gnawed at the tissue of civil liberties.'' Mr. Fried, who teaches history at the University of Illinois, Chicago, surveys three decades of American anti-Communism, from the Depression years to the New Frontier. On one level, this book is a rogues' gallery of Red-hunters: Congressmen, members of Federal loyalty panels, state legislators, college administrators, book-burning school board members and American Legionnaires. Even gay and anti-nuclear organizations purged their ranks of party members. McCarthy himself, who moves to center stage only in Chapter Five, is almost lost in the swarm of angry patriots. On a different level is Mr. Fried's observation that the anti-Communist crusade was an arena where larger political controversies (the New Deal, World War II, the cold war) played themselves out. If the movement reflected conservatives' ambitions and grievances, it also drew on - perverted, one probably should say - many traditional American values. Mr. Fried writes ably, scrupulously presenting both sides of every issue, covering swiftly a very broad topic; no one will ever do a better six-page precis of the Alger Hiss case. Gone is the tone that has marked cold war polemics: the left's shrill insistence that all accused were innocent, the glee of right-wingers pointing to those Reds who were caught. One misses the passion, but it is all for the best. With the cold war over, both sides may now be able to admit the truth.",1990-02-04T05:00:00+0000

Of all the subspecies of jazz, none has caught the public imagination quite so acutely as boogie-woogie, a blues-derived piano style characterized by repeated left-hand figures set against percussive right-hand riffs. What started as a rudimentary form, played mainly by unschooled pianists in rural areas, eventually became a popular craze, orchestrated for the large dance bands of the 1930's and 40's, resulting in such hits as ''The Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B.'' Perhaps the most valuable aspect of ''A Left Hand Like God'' is the insight it provides into the style's beginnings in Southern turpentine and logging camps, an obscure world brought to life admirably by Peter J. Silvester, a British civil servant who spent eight years researching this book. Here, too, is biographical material on nearly every boogie pianist, from some of the greats of jazz to contemporary revivalists, from Albert Ammons to Axel Zwingenberger. We get portraits, in varying focus, of such obscure giants as Cow Cow Davenport, Pinetop Smith and Cripple Clarence Lofton, along with rare photographs and reproductions of record labels and other memorabilia. Only the most fanatical boogie-woogie fan will want to read this book from cover to cover, but future scholars will find little to add to what will surely stand as the first and last word, lovingly spoken, on an American cultural phenomenon.",1990-02-04T05:00:00+0000

us,  FICTION,"SILVER STALLION. By Ahn Junghyo. (Soho, $19.95.) After almost four decades, the Korean War has become a forgotten war. As the Korean journalist and translator Ahn Junghyo makes clear in his second novel to appear in English, what is even more forgotten, at least for Americans, is the impact that conflict had on the Koreans themselves. Mr. Junghyo's stage is a small South Korean village and its surrounding countryside; his cast is composed of the villagers and some American soldiers, who all become unwitting actors in a tragedy. The central characters are a group of teen-agers, particularly a young villager named Mansik, who change from boys into under-age men as the American invaders involve them and their fellow Koreans in the sordid moral and physical wreckage of the war. After being raped, Mansik's mother joins the ''U.N. ladies'' (also known as ''Yankee wives'') in the occupied area called Texas Town and suffers the social consequences of prostitution. For Mansik and his friends, however, there is retreat into a realm of fantasy. As the war goes on around them, they search, as did their ancestors, for a secret cave, the home of a legendary warrior general who was sent by the gods to free Korea from the Mongols. This search for the general who rode a silver stallion helps to insulate the boys from the miserable reality of war. Mr. Junghyo, whose earlier novel, ''White Badge,'' told the story of Korean participation in the Vietnam War, is a strong writer and graceful translator of his own prose, with a keen sense of his subject - a rural people brought suddenly into a world they never made. As was true of America in Vietnam, in Korea we sat very heavily on a very light country.",1990-02-04T05:00:00+0000

In Britain, with its long and decorous literary tradition, his voice stands out discordantly from the rest like a boom box at a harpsichord recital. His urban satires have provoked extreme reactions in Britain, none more so than his latest, most ambitious novel, ''London Fields.'' Although mysteriously absent from this year's nominations for the Booker Prize, England's most prestigious literary award, the book is in the midst of a long run near the top of the best-seller list and has triggered phenomenal media attention. In recent years, Amis has become an outright literary star - an anomaly in Britain. But then, his prose is probably more American than British in its energy and raucousness. For many critics, Amis's comic talent is unrivaled, but for others, mostly older and conservative readers, he is a malevolent harpie, with morbid, vaguely unpatriotic interests. Intriguingly, his father is Kingsley Amis, one of Britain's original Angry Young Men of the 1950's, now a Thatcherite Conservative.

It's functional yet intentionally whimsical.

Dubbed neo-primitive, the pieces at first appear to have been lifted from a Flintstone cartoon, but they have a flair that is arresting. ''All our designs have personality,'' Bonetti says.

Mr. Kearns, a former engineering professor who said his invention showed up on Ford vehicles a few years after he showed it to company officials in the early 1960's, is asking $50 for every vehicle sold with his device. Since most cars use the device and since Mr. Kearns has similar suits pending against other auto manufacturers, the 62-year-old inventor could theoretically win as much as $1 billion. Just when he might receive the money is another question. The jury in the case, which has already dragged on for 12 years, will hear arguments on how much Ford should pay Mr. Kearns later this month.

They are the work of artists who belong to Skulpturos Kooperatyvas, an independent enterprise that separated from the state two years ago, among the first steps toward privatization in Lithuania during the Gorbachev era of perestroika. Each nearly 11 feet high and fashioned in welded copper from plaster models, the sculptures represent figures from operas known both locally and internationally, including Mephistopheles from ''Faust'' (far left), Amneris from ''Aida'' (center) and Margiris, a 14th-century warrior hero of Lithuanian legend and central figure of an opera called ''Pilenai.'' (The finished statue is in the rear, second from left; the plaster mold is in the foreground.) Feb. 16 is Lithuanian Independence Day, signifying the occasion in 1918 that Lithuania initiated its short-lived period of self-rule, a tumultuous - but progressive - two decades that came to an end with the republic's incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940. The fervid emergence of nationalism in recent months makes this year's anniversary loom as especially charged. According to Arunas Degutis, a candidate for the Supreme Soviet backed by Sajudis, the broad-based reform movement in Lithuania, the artists' cooperative is an important symbol. ''Since the order to build the statues was received during the years of stagnation,'' he said, responding, in Lithuanian, to written questions, ''it's hard to say this is part of a cultural renaissance.'' But the dedication day, Feb. 16, he said, is significant. The cooperative, he added, is rebuilding sculptures on the grounds of Vilnius Cathedral, ''which is a result of the changes in Lithuania.''",1990-02-04T05:00:00+0000

President Felix Houphouet-Boigny had hoped that the Pope would break the schedule of his five-nation African tour last week to bless the enormous cathedral, which is larger than St. Peter's and has an esplanade that can hold 300,000 people. But the basilica, which contains 30 acres of marble and four times the stained glass of the French cathedral in Chartres, cost at least $150 million to build, and the Pope's main theme in Africa was to scold the prosperous for not sharing their wealth. The Vatican has not said that Mr. Houphouet-Boigny should be faulted for spending such a great sum on a church building while his nation is mired in poverty.

(Holt, $16.95.) ''Whatchagot Stew'' is one long bad joke about how everyone nowadays is writing cookbooks: ''Carl Sagan wrote in Parade magazine that unless a serum was developed soon, within a few years all the land surface on earth would be covered with cookbooks to a depth of twelve feet.'' Since he seems to be unable to handle such an original idea by himself, Patrick F. McManus, author of such previous books as ''The Night the Bear Ate Goombaw,'' teams up here with his sister, Patricia McManus Gass, whom he calls ''The Troll.'' In the memoir of his Idaho childhood Mr. McManus kills off his father in just a few lines so that he can concentrate on details like his mother's favorite culinary tips, one of which was ''just scrape off the burnt part.'' His mother, a teacher, raised the brother and sister alone. Part of the time the family even lived in the back of the schoolhouse where she taught. Mabel McManus probably was an interesting character. Unfortunately, the writing is so ''seasoned with bawdy jokes, loud laughter, bad whiskey, and endless psychological torment'' that truth is completely beside the point. The recipes in the cookbook section are burdened with titles like ''Pat's Perky Popovers.'' One bear recipe - like a great many of the recipes here, Mr. McManus brags, this one was borrowed from another cook - takes over a week to prepare. After all the bad jokes, it's never entirely clear that the reader is supposed to take the recipes seriously. It doesn't matter, since you won't be hungry anyway.",1990-02-04T05:00:00+0000

(Is it a coincidence that this radio station cast a shadow over the most prominent player in the Super Bowl, Joe Montana, when it said that three white quarterbacks were ''guilty''?) The N.F.L. is sensible and humane in its drug-testing policy. The first time a player tests positive, no one is told about it, other than the player himself. (For the second offense, players get a 30-day suspension). So how could this radio station have found out that these three quarterbacks tested positive for drug use, if the anonymity of first offenders is protected?

us,  FICTION,"THREE-LEGGED HORSE. By Ann Hood. (Bantam, Paper, $7.95.) Between the tuna casseroles, the women's magazines of yesteryear served up heart- and hearth-warming fiction. The spirit of that fiction, nicely adapted to the changing social patterns of the 1980's, suffuses ''Three-Legged Horse,'' Ann Hood's third novel, in which Abby Nash comes belatedly of age, shedding her immaturity in the person of her footloose husband, Zach, for whom the summer of 1969 will never end. Licensed as a perpetual adolescent (he's an artist), Zach once seemed irresistibly ''dangerous to love,'' but Abby has finally won through to the home truth that love's not all you need. After a dozen years as a de facto single mother, earning her keep as part of a folk band called Three-Legged Horse, Abby has sung ''Both Sides Now'' in enough tacky lounges to get the message. Ms. Hood purports to tell the family drama from three perspectives. Hannah, the teen-age daughter of Abby and Zach, offers us a mix of Eloise and Holden Caulfield, but Dad gets less than a sixth of the book. Ms. Hood, several steps ahead of her heroine, has apparently written him off. The author's generalizations (''Like most dreams, this one didn't come true'') would equally have served the fictional sorority of the 1950's. But the terms of women's reality have been brought up to date. Not only is Zach impossible, but Doug and Sean (the horse's other legs) also founder. Even Gavin, Abby's unexceptionable suitor, is dismissed with the rest of the shiftless guys: '' 'I can't count on you to make my life wonderful,' Abby said, and her voice was clear and sure. 'I can't count on you or storybook fantasies.' '' What can she count on? Hannah, who's wised up early. The prospect of a female guitar player, Jocelyn, to regenerate ''the new improved Three-Legged Horse.'' Her violin. ''Everything,'' as Hannah puts it, ''that matters.''",1990-02-04T05:00:00+0000

Young Jr., a consummate inside agitator who simultaneously fought and manipulated the corporate culture to expand opportunities for blacks. As executive director of the National Urban League from 1961 until his death in 1971, Young revitalized an organization that had once been - as the author, a professor of history at Princeton University, describes it - ''the premier national social service agency concerned with the problems of blacks.'' Young put the league in the center of the civil rights movement. But his role as the inside man of the movement, a bridge builder who interpreted the message from black marchers and street demonstrators to white corporate executives and politicians, was often not fully appreciated by either side or by the public at large. Ms. Weiss tells Young's story without much flair or insight. ''Whitney M. Young, Jr., and the Struggle for Civil Rights'' is more useful for its descriptions of Young's background and the inner workings of the league than for its descriptions of the strains within the civil rights movement or the frustrations inherent in persuading whites to accept an aggressive agenda for black advancement. And details of Young's struggle to balance professional demands and family responsibilities show that, like other leaders, he was not flawless. The value of this book is that it reminds us of a talented, dedicated man who waged one of the most important civil rights battles in one of the least visible arenas: the corporate boardroom.",1990-02-11T05:00:00+0000

us,  THE FRENCH CONNECTION,"As several critics note in PARIS 1889: American Artists at the Universal Exposition (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts/Abrams, $49.50), the only way to identify the American pavilion there was by the sign over the door. The Americans' French-inspired academic paintings - Impressionism was in the air but not yet on the wall - featured Spanish musicians, Venetian gondoliers and an assortment of European shepherds. This beautifully illustrated volume by Annette Blaugrund, the guest curator and coordinator of the exhibit at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, re-creates the historical, political and social contexts of the Paris Exposition, as well as providing a critical evaluation of each American painting displayed. The scholar might enjoy pursuing the winding road of influence from the Barbizon painters to William Morris Hunt and from the Spanish realists to Thomas Eakins; the ordinary reader will be fascinated by the arguments over space (the Americans were assigned an out-of-the-way upstairs gallery), politics (Frederick Stuart Church refused to participate, in protest against the 30 percent duty on foreign works of art) and favoritism (American artists living in France provided 80 percent of the paintings). After the French, the largest number of paintings at the fair were by American artists - a show of support for the struggling republican Government unmatched by her wary European neighbors. American paintings received 57 awards and 24 honorable mentions, earning the artists international recognition and giving them the courage to forge their own identity at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. ''Paris 1889'' captures a fledgling American art on the verge of testing its wings. ROSLYN SIEGEL",1990-02-11T05:00:00+0000

Ever since Michael Bennett died from AIDS in 1987, at the age of 44, he has been the subject of controversy over whether he took credit for collaborators' contributions to such musicals as ''A Chorus Line'' and ''Dreamgirls.'' In ''One Singular Sensation,'' Kevin Kelly, the theater critic of The Boston Globe, accepts residual resentments as a given. Mr. Kelly's gossipy biography of the Wunderkind choreographer and Broadway conceptualizer emphasizes the trashy aspects of Bennett's life: his promiscuous bisexuality, his paranoia and drug addiction, his ''casual brutality'' and ''cruelty [that] was extensive.'' Incorporating an abundance of quotations from interviews with Bennett's family, friends and professional associates, Mr. Kelly's relentlessly vicious account accommodates every point of view except Bennett's own. Bennett is described by his colleagues as ''amoral,'' ''insensitive'' and ''narcissistic''; even his palpable energy is demeaned as ''hostile'' and ''ruthless,'' and his ''sexual charisma'' is reduced to a ''strictly calculated'' ploy. According to Mr. Kelly, for Bennett ''theater always came first. He looked upon outside emotional involvement as a hazard; personal commitments cut into the work.'' ''One Singular Sensation'' lacks the substance and detail that any self-respecting biography would be sure to include, and it displays none of the synthesis or analysis that might have produced a more credible portrait. In his rush to make Bennett appear a victim of his neuroses who in turn victimized everyone who entered his orbit, Mr. Kelly has neglected his achievements as a galvanic force behind the concept musical and as a pioneer of the workshop method, and Bennett's already legendary influence has been denigrated.",1990-02-11T05:00:00+0000

Experts disagreed on what the trend might mean for the future of celebrity endorsements. Some said jittery stars would back away from them.

''Things are so volatile in Africa,'' muses the main character of the South African journalist John Conyngham's first novel, not so much stating the obvious as venting the fears and uncertainties of a man in a precarious position. James Colville, a white sugar-cane grower in South Africa, confronts a host of personal demons - unknown arsonists, problems with alcohol and bad relationships - and the divisions in his life after a series of mysterious fires on his plantation and the discovery of a diary written by one of his ancestors during the Boer War. Throughout ''The Arrowing of the Cane,'' Mr. Conyngham reveals not only an understanding of South Africa's fragile contemporary racial equilibrium but also a love of the natural wonders of his country. This book is as much an elegy for the beauty of South Africa as it is an indictment of the policies that remain that nation's enduring legacy. But the book, the first volume in a projected trilogy, is no fictional travelogue. In it, Mr. Conyngham explores - methodically and at a pace that imparts its own tensions - the pressures on modern South Africans, black and white. He conveys the terrors of apartheid without reporting its every vicious particular. By limning these days in the life of one man, Mr. Conyngham has deftly fashioned a metaphor for a country facing its own 3 o'clock in the morning of the soul.",1990-02-11T05:00:00+0000

There seems to be that about the familiar form of a name that precludes its use in a formal setting.) A few years ago, I saw the name James Panos listed in the monthly bulletin of my church, as a donor of a contribution I had not made. I let it pass. But in a later edition, there it was: two equal contributions by two parishioners named James Panos. This frustrating confusion persisted for a couple of years. Finally, I asked the church to change my name to Jim on all their files. Having two parishioners with the exact name must have been playing havoc with their mailing lists and bookkeeping because the change was effected pronto and, I suspect, with relief on both sides.",1990-02-11T05:00:00+0000
us,Design;   TARTAN TOUCHES,"Few fabrics carry with them as much folklore as the tartan. Scottish plaids have been used as coats of arms, articles of clothing and patterns that decorate everything from mugs to jewelry boxes.The earliest tartans were thought to have been woven by the Celts before the year 1000. Indeed, these plaids were so much a part of the Scottish culture that between 1746 and 1782, the British Parliament banned their wearing by anyone except the military, in an attempt to break up Scottish clans. King George IV's visit to Scotland in 1822 prompted a tartan revival. Queen Victoria's use of tartans in the interiors of Balmoral Castle turned these plaids into a decorating trend. A similar revival is happening today. ''When Queen Victoria discovered tartan, the Queen invented her own nostalgia about Scottish history,'' says Keith Irvine, a partner in the Manhattan-based decorating company of Irvine & Fleming, who is Scottish. ''Tartans became like the Ralph Lauren decorating style of the 1840's.'' Today decorators are once again using tartan fabrics and objects all over the house. ''The patterns are so recognizable that people feel comfortable living with tartan,'' says Tom Fleming, Irvine's partner. In a living room in Westchester County, for example, Fleming slipcovered much of the upholstery in a tartan wool. ''Tartan is commonly thought of as a winter fabric,'' says Fleming. ''But it's seasonless. There are also wonderful tartan linens that have a crisp look - perfect for summer.''",1990-02-11T05:00:00+0000

They're made by several confectioners now, but it is likely that NECCO remains the leader, churning out, from its Cambridge, Mass., factory, two sizes of tastefully-inscribed, heart-shaped wafers, a total of approximately 1.7 billion pieces every year.

So it wasn't surprising that, with a deadline of October 1990, the New York Legislature last year failed to pass legislation putting the new Federal welfare reform law into effect. It wasn't surprising - and it wasn't responsible. That failure cost New York money, at least $4.5 million so far, and counting. New Yorkers have a right to wonder what's going on in Albany.

us,  FICTION,"THE SINGING SPIRIT: Early Short Stories by North American Indians. Edited by Bernd C. Peyer. (University of Arizona, $24.95.) Louise Erdrich, N. Scott Momaday, Leslie Marmon Silko and James Welch are among the bright stars of contemporary American Indian fiction. Their names are well known, their works widely read. But earlier American Indian fiction writers are not so familiar. In ''The Singing Spirit,'' the Swiss scholar and ethnologist Bernd C. Peyer has collected a treasure trove of stories from the late 19th and early 20th century. Written primarily for a white audience by men and women from numerous tribes, these tales, supported by Mr. Peyer's excellent introduction, enable us to trace the richly diverse origins of the extraordinary output of American Indian fiction that has occurred since the late 1960's. ''The Singing Spirit'' includes hunting adventures, romantic narratives, revenge tales, stories adapted from an oral tradition, satirical sketches and a few stories, masterly in their art, that transcend any easy categorization. ''A Red Girl's Reasoning'' by Pauline Johnson passionately portrays the rage and heartbreak of a young couple when the Anglo husband scorns an Indian tradition sacred to his new bride. Incompatible cultural values are also the subject of ''The Problem of Old Harjo'' by John M. Oskison, but the author treats this theme with a comic touch. Not all the stories in ''The Singing Spirit'' are of equal literary merit, but even the weakest provide fascinating ethnographic data. Reading this collection is like visiting a well-appointed period room in a museum, a welcome and informative experience.",1990-02-11T05:00:00+0000

In the early 1950's, he exhibited blank white canvases, and in recent years he has turned to photography.",1990-02-16T05:00:00+0000

Balanchine's first act follows the Shakespeare play with fidelity. But the ballet has never seemed all that heartfelt a response to the score or the story. It is a strange hybrid, really, two ballets in one with a few surprisingly incongruous touches. And the New York City Ballet's performance of the work on Wednesday evening at the New York State Theater was a decently danced but generally dull affair, both onstage and from the orchestra pit, that failed to make up for the ballet's peculiarities.",1990-02-16T05:00:00+0000

Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 29. The film opens today at the Bleecker Street Cinema, at La Guardia Place Video monitors preside eerily over virtually every scene in the Canadian director Atom Egoyan's ''Speaking Parts,'' giving the film its chilly high-tech cachet. In a board room, an absent film executive dominates his employees by means of a giant screen. In her solitary apartment, a spooky, lovelorn woman makes her VCR the centerpiece of a shrine. An ambitious actor says one thing while beside him, on a monitor playing his audition tape, he is seen and heard saying something else.

Like most inferior operas, it requires the tenderest treatment if it is to succeed. Indeed, despite the puissance suggested by the male hero's name, ''Samson'' is a work of quivering vulnerability, easily crushed by performers who do not understand or cannot convey its period charm. And yet there it stands, still a pillar (if a dangerously thin one) of the opera repertory, thanks to several durable arias.",1990-02-16T05:00:00+0000

How did it happen that Alexander Pushkin, descendant of an Ethiopian prince known as ''the Negro of Peter the Great,'' came to be the most brilliant poet of the Russian language? A mystery of genius, according to the novelist and scholar John Oliver Killens, in which Pushkin's African heritage was as enigmatic an influence as his mother's withheld love and his lifelong sense of identification with the lowly peasants of the Russian steppes. Killens's novel is admirable for finally giving weight to the 19th-century poet's fascination with his African lineage, an element of his biography largely ignored by Pushkin scholars. And yet, its maladroit title notwithstanding, ''Great Black Russian'' admirably avoids any polemics about race, dealing with the firebrand poet as the complex, puzzling character he was. Here is Pushkin the man, the writer, the African, the Russian, the aristocrat, the revolutionary, the womanizer and the husband. In wildly erratic but somehow mesmerizing prose, Killens (who died in 1987, shortly after completing this novel) takes us from Pushkin's youth, first as an unloved child and then a debauched teen-ager, through his young manhood as a revolutionary poet idolized by the people and exiled by a threatened Czar, to the prime of his productivity, his restricted life at the imperial court, his ill-conceived marriage and his death in a duel in 1837. The book can be maddening, juxtaposing powerful passages like a description of mass baptismal rites on the frozen Neva River with painful, cliche-ridden sex scenes, but it manages nonetheless to capture the essence of Pushkin's greatness - that he was a man who loved his people enough to give them a voice.",1990-02-18T05:00:00+0000

While most other docudramas merely give notice at the end of the credits that they are based on a book or two, this production offers a lengthy message that appears in white letters on a black screen. Read by a disembodied voice, it informs viewers that the dramatization was based on personal interviews, a variety of journalistic accounts and Government investigations, that scenes were filmed at the Johnson Space Center and that ''this picture was researched with the consultation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.''",1990-02-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Mystery Master Gives His Town a Gift. It's Murder,"EVERYBODY had a soft spot for 16-year-old Sally Anders. Friends and family members described her as sweet and responsible, an average teen-ager who looked forward to school dances, sang in the church choir and auditioned for the school play. Why then, asked residents of her quiet Connecticut town, would someone want to murder her? Sally was such a nice, proper girl. Or was she? Through the words and thoughts of detectives and the victim's friends, the mystery writer Hillary Waugh cleverly unravels the answer in ''Death in a Town,'' published by Carroll & Graf, a classic whodunit that follows the investigation after the brutal slaying of a teen-age baby sitter. Set in Guilford (disguised in the novel as Crockford), the book also explores how rumors and accusations can ultimately destroy a community.",1990-02-18T05:00:00+0000

Visiting skiers relish the expanse, the wildness, the European atmosphere and, of course, good food and wine. Progress and modernization have taken their toll, but skiers can still satisfy expectations, especially in the grand classics, the old resorts that have made efforts to cling to their charm, and remain playgrounds for the wealthy and fashionable.

For weeks, Sony's engineers have been trying to get this unlikely team - a former opera singer who is Sony's president and chief executive, and a former physicist who is vice chairman of the Sony Corporation of America - on the same continent at the same time. Down the hall, visitors are wandering through Sony's ''Media World,'' viewing new products such as Sony's tinest video camera, eight months on the market and already the company's biggest runaway success since the Walkman. What they don't see are forthcoming technologies still in the hands of designers - a complete audio-visual entertainment center for an individual airplane seat, for instance; or a palm-sized digital audio tape recorder that packs two hours of sound on a cassette the size of a postage stamp.

Reading Beverly Coyle's first novel is like roaming through Disneyland as a child: you wander from image to image, discovery to discovery, and when you're finished you want to do it all over again. Through the perceptions and misperceptions of young Carrie Willis, the daughter of a liberal Methodist minister, Ms. Coyle gives us an intimate view of the small-town Florida of the 1950's, of sleepy towns ''ringing with no sound at all'' in which ''men and women lingered like drugged bees in the intense sun.'' Carrie's world has clear distinctions: ''We Methodists had an oyster shell parking lot behind the new educational plant. But the Baptists just pulled up anywhere.'' And everything, even a dinner-table discussion, takes on a religious hue. ''My mother,'' Carrie says as the family ignores Mrs. Willis's chatter one evening, ''might as well have been speaking in tongues.'' Carrie watches her family absorb the awful news that Grandma has joined a Seventh-day Adventist church. ''They foot-wash,'' Carrie's sister Jeanie says, her voice struck low with shame. Ms. Coyle's last chapter, in which Carrie, all grown up and teaching English in New York City, receives a reluctant visit from her elderly mother, is the most memorable. This may stem from Carrie's painful confrontation with mortality, from the vivid clash of the small town with the big city or from the unresolved mother-daughter battles that are too old to fight. Or maybe what speaks to us is the fond memory of Carrie's memories, which makes us want to go back with her to that childhood world.",1990-02-18T05:00:00+0000

us,CONSUMER'S WORLD: Guidepost;   Reading Cognac Labels,"Cognac, the brandy made in the Charentes region in western France, is often sold with confusing names and initials on the label; the French Government regulates some but not all of them. Almost all bottled Cognacs are blended from barrels of Cognac made in different years, and the letters on a label indicate the age of the youngest Cognac allowed in the blend. Some of the very best Cognacs, which are considerably older than that minimum, often do not bear these symbols. Bottles labeled Grande Champagne or Fine Champagne have nothing to do with bubbly Champagne but mean that at least 50 percent of the grapes were grown in the Grande Champagne zone of the Cognac district. Here are the markings the French Government regulates. $ Grade Minimum Age In Blend Usual Age Range V.S. (formerly three-star) 2 1/2 years 3 to 7 years V.S.O.P. 4 1/2 years 7 to 12 years Napoleon, X.O. 6 1/2 years 15 to 50 years",1990-02-24T05:00:00+0000

Never [so] in front of women, where I always find a way to isolate a few elements that satisfy the painter in me.'' So wrote Edouard Vuillard (1868-1940), a Parisian painter who never married, stayed home with maman and his sister and painted them repeatedly at their daily work as seamstresses. The painter's subjects never return his stare; they hazard peeks at one another in maybe one of 10 paintings. The space they occupy is choppy and irrational, pulled at from all sides by competing points of view. In the introduction to THE INTIMATE INTERIORS OF EDOUARD VUILLARD (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston/Smithsonian Institution, $45), Elizabeth Wynne Easton, an assistant curator at the Brooklyn Museum, promises to use Vuillard's diaries, recently made public, to ''eavesdrop on Vuillard's private conversation.'' But she doesn't, not really. Instead she advances a strictly formal thesis: that Vuillard transformed his Symbolist influences into a novel use of line and color. When she comes to Vuillard's odd and obsessive themes she treats them like afterthoughts, taking them up at random, then letting her commentary skate the surface of biography.

Mr. Downey listed assets of more than $6.8 million and liabilities of about $2.4 million, but he apparently is having cash-flow problems. He is seeking protection from about 75 creditors including banks and a limousine leasing company whose owner said that Mr. Downey turned his leased auto ''into a trash can.'' Mr. Downey, who claimed to have only $100 in ready cash and $320 in the bank, was unavailable for comment on his problems, which apparently were linked to the decline of his once-popular show. The show's ratings began to slide as Mr. Downey went beyond brow-beating his guests and was charged at least twice with assaulting them. The show finally sank into oblivion as stations in major markets stopped carrying it last year.",1990-02-25T05:00:00+0000

The Administration has proposed to quadruple the budget of the Agricultural Research Service - to $6.5 million - mainly to study eloria-noyesi, a coca-eating caterpillar, and the feasibility of dropping millions of the insects into the coca fields of Peru and Bolivia. The caterpillar, which grows up to be the malumbia moth, is voracious enough to destroy whole crops of the leaves from which cocaine comes, officials said. ''If we could put them down there in sufficient numbers, we could then defoliate the plants,'' an official told The Washington Post last week. But nobody is sure what the malumbia will crave once all the coca is eaten - coffee plants? house pets? - and officials in Bolivia and Peru were less than enthusiastic. So the Administration rushed to reassure them. Said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, ''Neither troops nor caterpillars will go in without prior request and consultation.''",1990-02-25T05:00:00+0000

us,  Borrowing Trouble,"Luella Wilson thought she could afford to lend her great-nephew money for a car in 1984, but it nearly cost her everything she owned. The great-nephew, Willard Stuart, driving without a license and with alcohol and drugs in his system, ran the car off a bridge in an accident that partially paralyzed a passenger, Mark Vince. Under the doctrine of negligent entrustment, Mr. Vince's lawyer sued Mrs. Wilson, charging that she was negligent for lending a relative money for the car. In 1987, a jury found her liable for $950,000 in damages, more than her life savings combined with the value of her small farm in Vermont. But then a state appeals court ordered a retrial, saying that the auto dealer who sold the car should have also been a defendant. The case was settled last week under terms that will allow Mrs. Wilson to keep her home. (Insurance companies for the dealer and Mrs. Wilson will pay.) ''It's all over and I'm tickled to death,'' she said. But the point, said Mr. Vince's lawyer, is that dealers ''know now that if they sell cars to people like Willard Stuart they will be held liable.''",1990-02-25T05:00:00+0000

us,  FICTION,"HUMAN MOURNING. By Jose Revueltas. Translated by Roberto Crespi. Introduction by Octavio Paz. (University of Minnesota, Cloth, $22.50; Paper, $9.95.) First published in Spanish in 1943 and the winner of Mexico's National Literary Prize, ''Human Mourning'' is Jose Revueltas's first novel to appear in English. Together with Mariano Azuela's ''Underdogs'' and Martin Luis Guzman's ''Shadow of the Leader,'' this novel of three families who refuse to leave their parched land after the failure of a bitter antigovernment strike is considered essential reading for those wishing to understand the effects of the Mexican revolution on the peasant masses. As the novel opens, heavy rains have begun, and those left behind seek refuge on a rooftop. With the flood waters rising, the campesinos question their personal and collective past. Neither a chronicle nor a traditional narrative, this difficult novel, ably translated by Roberto Crespi, introduces characters who are both real and symbolic but who somehow never manage to come sufficiently alive. At his best, Revueltas (who died in 1976) creates a desolate rural landscape that mirrors the desperate and contradictory souls of the characters. But Revueltas overwhelms the reader with rhetoric and polemics, with images and memories, often carelessly piled on, and much of the book's action is internalized. Still, Revueltas's writing can be both moving and dramatic, as when, toward the end of the novel, buzzards begin to circle, waiting for the survivors to die. Included with the text are Octavio Paz's original 1943 review, as well as a 1979 essay in which he retracts much of his earlier criticism and also clarifies for the reader Revueltas's religious and political concerns.",1990-02-25T05:00:00+0000

But the yen sagged, closing the week in New York at 147 to the dollar, down from 144 the week before.

us,  NONFICTION,"ROOSEVELT AND MARSHALL: Partners in Politics and War. By Thomas Parrish. (Morrow, $25.) In 1943, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt was weighing the candidates for leading the invasion of Europe, he told General Dwight D. Eisenhower that he was giving most serious consideration to the Army's Chief of Staff, George Catlett Marshall, because otherwise ''fifty years from now practically nobody will know who George Marshall was.'' Thomas Parrish's excellent history underscores that while Eisenhower was F.D.R.'s final choice and earned his own place in history, Marshall's place is equally secure. In ''Roosevelt and Marshall,'' it is Marshall who emerges as the more interesting of the pair, perhaps only because F.D.R. is better known. In World War I in France, Marshall began building his professional reputation as a staff officer by planning the gigantic concentration of American troops for the Meuse-Argonne offensive. As Chief of Staff, his relations with both Congress and the White House were key to building a small peacetime army into a vast machine. Indeed, Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn once told F.D.R. that when Marshall testified, ''we forget whether we are Republicans or Democrats. We just remember that we are in the presence of a man who is telling the truth.'' The President replied that even when he disapproved a Marshall recommendation, he could be sure that the general would continue to ''give me the most loyal support as chief of staff that any President could wish.''",1990-02-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Men's Style;   A New Work Ethic,"THey are honest, romantic, sincere. Theyhave integrity. And they are sexy. Terms usually invoked to decribe friends, lovers, and sometimes, politicians, are the ones that crop up most when the topic turns to work clothes. Mention any one of those familiar and functional items, ranging from T-shirts to overalls to fishermen's caps, and the conversation takes on a high tone with a sentimental edge. Trend watchers are quick to point out that a resurgent interest in mechanics' coveralls, sanitation workers' slickers, cooks' shirts and ever-so-humble blue jeans expresses a yearning to return to a simpler way of life. ''Our focus is shifting from competing in the city to minding the house in the country,'' says Harold Koda, curator of the costume collection at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Gerald C. Celente, the director of the Socio-Economic Research Institute of America, a consumer trend-analysis service, maintains that people want more control over their lives. ''Since the October crash on Wall Street,'' Celente says, ''people have increasingly refused to give their lives to the company.'' Work clothes become equalizers. Yet, though they rarely express protest or defiance, as they did in the 1960's, their very plainness tends to assert the wearer's personality. Clothing worn by policemen, construction workers or short-order cooks also boasts the virtue of making men feel virile. This may be a matter of fit. In a ruminative essay on blue jeans, Umberto Eco noted that because they held the hips, jeans put a man more in touch with his body. Eco observed that wearing a particularly snug-fitting pair of denims made him think about ''the relationship between me and my pants . . . I had achieved heteroconsciousness,'' he said, ''that is to say an epidermic self-awareness.''",1990-02-25T05:00:00+0000

''What makes you so sure that they're her children?'' asks a man on a bus as he scrutinizes the mother and sons who are the focus of ''Hardscrub.'' ''Why she hit 'em,'' is his wife's immediate response. That premise - the parent-child bond as defined by violence -is the focus of this bracing new novel by Lionel G. Garcia, who won the 1983 PEN Southwest Award for his novel ''Leaving Home.'' Jim, the protagonist and narrator, is a precocious adolescent growing up in the arid, small-town world of West Texas in the early 1950's. Jim's sister and mother are the objects of his father's scorn and ridicule, but it is his brother, Richard, who receives most of the blows, and worse. Jim admires the older boy for standing up to their father, for simply being his brother and - although Jim knows it's wrong - for being an elegant and accomplished thief. As the novel proceeds, the bedraggled family is by turns abused and abandoned by the man who never wanted any of them. If this sounds terribly depressing, it is. But ''Hardscrub'' is also enlivened by Mr. Garcia's sense of humor and irony. Early on, for example, Jim's mother tries to comfort him, saying that his father ''may not be first class, but I believe that deep down he loves us. He just doesn't know it.'' To which Jim sensibly responds, ''When's he supposed to find out how much he loves us?''",1990-02-25T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Mandela, who was freed this month after 27 years in prison for his role as head of the African National Congress, has refused to call for an end of violent opposition to racial oppression in South Africa, where blacks are denied all manner of rights. Mr. Westling implied that in taking this stance, Mr. Mandela had somehow ''thrown in his lot with killers.'' Ms. Lam, the Globe said, was ''very upset'' by the letter.",1990-02-25T05:00:00+0000

us,  Dispute Goes On,"THE maker of the controversial Ping Eye2 iron has refused a proposal by the PGA Tour to allow a three-person panel of antitrust arbitrators to decide whether the tour can ban golf clubs with U-shaped grooves from its competitions. The refusal by Karsten Solheim, the president and founder of Karsten Manufacturing Corporation, emphasized the club maker's desire to take his lawsuit against the tour before a jury in Federal court. Such a process would likely delay a resolution in the case for at least a year and possibly much longer. In a Feb. 20 letter to Solheim, the PGA Tour commissioner, Deane Beman, urged the use of binding arbitration rather than the court system. Beman contended that a special panel could decide the issue by the middle of this year. But in a letter to Beman from the manufacturer's chief attorney, Leonard Decof, Solheim refused. ''We don't fear a jury trial,'' Decof said in a telephone interview on Saturday. ''We believe in our court system of justice. They apparently don't.'' ''I'm very disappointed,'' said Beman in a telephone interview. ''This issue has hung over the game long enough, and I don't understand his decision if he cares about the game.'' On Jan. 27, Solheim dropped a $100 million lawsuit against the United States Golf Association when the U.S.G.A. agreed to make legal forever all Ping Eye2 clubs that have already been manufactured.

us,  Comeback Trail,"HE is there every day, almost lost among the young players who file in and out of the Yankees' minor league complex at Tampa, Fla. Like everyone else, he does his work, dreams a little dream of pitching in the big leagues, then goes home. But it is different for Brit Burns. He has been there before. Burns won 18 games for the Chicago White Sox in 1985, but his rising star fell the next spring - after he was acquired in a trade by the Yankees -when he limped off a mound in an exhibition game in Dunedin, Fla. A degenerative hip condition had become so bad that Burns was forced to return to his home in Alabama, his career apparently over. After two operations, his hip got better, but nothing else did. Four years of inactivity passed. Burns was involved in some bad real estate ventures and a difficult divorce. So he decided to try a comeback. Why? ''Not finding a niche in the real world,'' he admitted. ''It was a difficult transition. I'm not a salesman, and trying to fit into the business world made me realize how much I missed this. Once it gets in your blood, there is nothing outside of baseball that could ever replace it. When you try to, you only get frustrated.'' The Yankees aren't expecting much from the 30-year-old Burns, but he is expecting a lot from himself. He is an unsigned, non-roster player with no status, but when he is asked about pitching in the minors, he shrugs and says: ''I don't think that's going to be necessary. I expect to be handed the ball on the third or fourth day in New York.'' Burns, a left-hander, still has a distinct limp but said it does not affect his ability to pitch or to field ground balls. He is down to 220 pounds, 18 fewer than when he arrived and 45 fewer than he carried two years ago, when he battled periods of depression over the premature loss of his career. He smiles now, if only at the thought he is wearing a Yankee uniform once more. But neither that nor the notion that there is money to be made again has brought him back. ''Money is a byproduct, but it's not the issue,'' he said. ''If the financial picture weren't the way it is, guys would still be playing baseball. There's the atmosphere, the camaraderie of the clubhouse. It's gratifying.''",1990-02-26T05:00:00+0000

us,  Balls Recalled,"CALL it a safety-minded humanitarian gesture or a clever marketing ploy, but a leading manufacturer has stopped producing traditional baseballs for the youth market, issued a recall for those in circulation and called for other manufacturers to follow suit. The company, Worth Inc., says it will replace any of its balls bearing a youth league stamp with a model it claims will virtually eliminate serious impact injuries among often inept, accident-prone young players without sacrificing so much as a single extra-base hit or short hop of performance. The address is Box 88104, Tullahoma, Tenn. 37388-8104. The patented safety models, known as ''Reduced Injury Factor,'' or RIF balls, are the same size and weight as traditional balls and have real leather covers, real seams, and, Worth says, the same performance characteristics at Little League speeds. Unlike traditional balls, which are made of yarn wound around cork or rubber cores, RIF interiors are a single piece of polyurethane foam plastic, which Worth says absorbs 80 percent more impact because it compresses more, distributing the force over a larger area of bat - or skull. The result, according to independent tests, is that while a yarn-wound ball fired at 60 miles an hour has a 99 percent chance of causing a serious head injury, the rate for Worth's RIF ball is 2 percent. Worth introduced the RIF ball in 1985, a year after the United States Product Safety Commission reported that 35 of the 51 known baseball-related deaths of young players from 1973 to 1983 were caused by thrown or batted balls. The company cited those findings in calling for a total ban on production of yarn-wound balls for young players, a move that, not coincidentally, would leave Worth, already the largest softball manufacturer, as the lone supplier of the 6 million or so baseballs sold in the youth market each year. It's RIF is the only regulation ball that meets recently established safety standards. Because the claim that the slightly soft RIF ball's safety is achieved without affecting performance evokes almost automatic skepticism, Worth's president, Jess Heald, has taken to carrying around a golf ball and a spongy Super Ball for instant demonstrations that hardness does not determine bounce. Although the RIF has Little League approval, Worth says it has encountered sales resistance because the RIF has one resounding flaw: The sound it makes when struck by a bat is not the coveted ''ping,'' which has come to replace the satisfying ''crack'' of yore for the aluminum bat generation, but a deeper-toned ''pung.'' Worth, however, has reason to believe the ''pung'' will eventually become the sound of choice. It was Worth, after all, that made the ''ping'' king when it introduced the first aluminum bat.",1990-02-26T05:00:00+0000
