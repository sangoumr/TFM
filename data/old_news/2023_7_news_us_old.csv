Westerly Canteens trailer holds a compact kitchen with cream-painted walls and blond wood counters. I had this wild idea, like, What if we took the food truck concept and put it in a space that is still mobile but feels beautiful and welcoming? Levine said as she stirred a pot of golden-hued stock, fragrant with spring onion and green garlic. Levine, who previously worked at the Berkeley, Calif., restaurant Chez Panisse, founded Westerly with her partner, Alex Kaindl, a farmer who tends half an acre in Sharon, Conn. Nearly all of their ingredients are sourced from farms nearby. (Starting this month, Kaindls crops will also be incorporated.) Developing the weekly menu is a puzzle that requires maximizing limited space and resources. A lot of our decisions are very creative and passion driven but also very practical, Kaindl said as Levine ladled the stock over a plate of nettle-stuffed ravioli. We slice up the spring onions that go into the dish, and the tops are made into the broth, Levine said. Were using every piece of the onion. The founders hope to engage the surrounding community while also drawing diners from afar. Theyve partnered with Tenmile Distillery, which offers cocktails made with local ingredients to go alongside Westerlys menu (their take on a Negroni includes Faccia Brutto bitters from Brooklyn, Method sweet vermouth from Romulus and gin made on-site at Tenmile). We really want people to sit here and stay a while, Levine said. westerlycanteen.com.",2023-07-06T13:00:12+0000

us,Five Science Fiction Movies to Stream Now,"Dan Berk and Robert Olsens film starts with a mysterious red flare streaking down from the sky, so right away we suspect who (or what) will trigger the plot. And it might not be friendly, because the odds of a backpacking trip going right in a sci-fi movie are fairly low. Indeed, things quickly go awry after Harry (Jake Lacy, from Season 1 of The White Lotus) and his girlfriend, Ruth (Maika Monroe, It Follows), take off on an isolated Oregon trail. She is wracked by anxiety so crippling that she has been taking medication and seeing a therapist, but gamely tries to not spoil a trip Jake has carefully planned. And then, of course, it all goes to pot, with a couple of nifty red herrings and plot twists spicing up the script. Significant Other (the title cleverly plays off a couple of different meanings) is a tight, effective hybrid of science fiction and horror, with the scares generated less by shock tactics than by a growing dread. That anguish is generated in the viewer in part by good filmmaking  the movie is briskly paced, well acted and moodily atmospheric (only the C.G.I. looks a little cheap). And partly it derives from Significant Other dealing with common preoccupations: Do we ever fully know who we lie next to?",2023-07-07T15:00:13+0000

Now it is finally swaggering onto supermarket shelves and online. Eric Skae, the chief executive of Carbone Fine Foods, said the goal was to replicate the restaurant experience, and that took a long time at the stove. For freshness, they wound up omitting the usual cream from the tomato and Calabrian chile mixture. Instructions on the label have you add it at home. Vodka sauce, pink, spicy, packing some heat but rarely tasting of vodka, may have originated in New York or in Italy decades ago; its popularity is undimmed. So much so that earlier this year, Heinz in England introduced its version of vodka sauce in collaboration with Absolut, the vodka company with its name on the label. In the United States, jarred vodka sauces are ubiquitous on supermarket shelves. For a new perspective, theres now tomato alla vodka cannellini beans from Heyday Canning, a new company with a line of seasoned canned beans to serve as is or to add wherever your imagination takes you. And here, too, theyve skipped the cream to make it vegan; coconut milk is the stand-in. The luscious cannellini in vodka sauce is excellent tossed with the requisite penne or rigatoni.

I asked Shimoda about the context and composition of this poem, and his answer was a skillful, evocative illumination of the relationship between life and poetry: I wrote this poem the night after going out on a water drop with a humanitarian-aid group. We drove for many hours through the desert, putting water out for migrants, people trying to stay alive. We met a man who, in the hallucinatory heat of Arizona, asked how far it was to Kentucky. Some important part of an individual exists in the places they are trying to reach, and it is excruciating. It is like we are following the signs and symbols of our future selves through the wilderness. I write poetry when I am feeling haunted by something  an image, encounter  although not as a means of exorcism. I think about what I have seen, heard, experienced, and I go under. I write poetry at night, partly because I believe there is a more humane, trustworthy logic to be found there, although like dreams, and like the landscapes in which they graze, the poems are themselves the interpretation.

This allows her Art Deco-style set of serving spoons, salad servers and carving knives, all with almond green shagreen handles, to take center stage. I use [the serving set] as the key piece of the table along with the flowers or candleholders, she says. Vergness approach reflects a shift in focus when it comes to tableware, away from handblown glassware and patterned napkins to sculptural utensils. In Copenhagen, stirred by her homelands history of silversmithing, the Danish jeweler Olga Bonne has added delicate hand-wrought silver spoons, forks and knives with handles in the shape of fish, kestrels or hares to her roster of whimsical creations. She takes inspiration from eras past, when arts and crafts did not have to be functional but most of all ornamental and extravagant, she says. Some designers are marrying the functional and fanciful: In Brighton, the British designer Alessandra Williams recently launched her namesake homeware label with sets of hand-carved salad servers in green leopard stone and blackened jacaranda wood made by Fair Trade co-operatives in Zimbabwe and Nairobi. Frank Traynor, the United States-based artist behind the Perfect Nothing Catalog, adorns everything from cheese graters to cake knives with copper and tin combined with semiprecious stones and shells, lending quotidian objects new charm. Then theres the British chef and farmer Ben Bodman, who makes carbon Damascus steel knives with swirling patterns on the blades and myrtlewood and rosewood handles in Melksham, a small town in Wiltshire, England, under the label Bodman Blades.

Another school argues that the virus was laboratory-engineered to infect humans and cause them harm  a bioweapon  and was possibly devised in a shadow project sponsored by the Peoples Liberation Army of China. A third school, more moderate than the second but also implicating laboratory work, suggests that the virus got into its first human victim by way of an accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (W.I.V.), a research complex on the eastern side of the city, maybe after well-meaning but reckless genetic manipulation that made it more dangerous to people.

Whole casts of voice actors might be hired to take on individual voices in nonfiction collections, like The 1619 Project, or expansive fiction like George Saunderss Lincoln in the Bardo (which includes a staggering 166 narrators). But when it comes to an autobiography, or a personal essay collection, there really is only one best option: Hand the microphone to the author.

This archly observed novel, translated from the Italian by Julia MacGibbon, follows some of the conventions of the genre, allowing a well-stocked cast of characters to be buffeted by the history of 20th-century Italy, but it does so in a playful, kaleidoscopic fashion.

Pleasantss thesis was that the traditional forms of classical music  opera, oratorio, orchestral and chamber music, all constructions of a bygone era  no longer related to the experience of our modern lives. Composers had lost touch with the currents of popular taste, and popular music, with its vitality and its connection to the spirit of the times, had dethroned the classics. Absent the mass appeal enjoyed by past masters like Beethoven, Verdi, Wagner and Tchaikovsky, modern composers had retreated into obscurantism, condemned to a futile search for novelty amid the detritus of a tradition that was, like overworked soil, exhausted and fallow. One could still love classical music, but only with the awareness that it was a relic of the past and in no way representative of our contemporary experience.",2023-07-28T09:01:36+0000

There are so many people who are nonimbibing, for whatever reason, but who still want to be a part of the mood, says Stacey Swenson, who designed the menu at the Swan Room bar in downtown Manhattan, which serves drinks including the Champaxne Cocktail (nonalcoholic sparkling wine, orange blossom and bitters) and the Chinola Mule (a tequila alternative with lime, passion fruit and spiced soda). The biggest change: teetotalers arent the only ones ordering them. Nine out of 10 of our customers also drink alcohol, says Nicholas Bodkins, one of the founders of Boisson, a store specializing in zero-proof spirits. This is more of an and than an or. He gives credit for this shift to distillers, who, refining early iterations that often tasted soapy or medicinal, have figured out how to effectively extract the flavors of botanicals without the use of ethanol. Today, the best bitter aperitifs (the term for nonalcoholic alternatives to spirits like Campari and Aperol) have all the complexity and layered flavors of their boozy counterparts. Theyre also easy to find  Boisson, for example, has locations in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco and a forthcoming Miami store, in addition to an online shop  which makes stocking a home bar with nonalcoholic options a breeze.
