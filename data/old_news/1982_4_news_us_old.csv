Salvadoran election officials announced that the centrist Christian Democratic Party apparently won 24 of the 60 seats in the new constituent assembly.

The 1982 production is ''Iolanthe,'' or ''The Peer and the Peri,'' and its beneficiary the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center. In contrast to last year's minimal ''Mikado,'' the production is a lavish one involving a cast of 93, with 19 set changes and 250 costumes. The romantic leads of Strephon and Phyllis will be sung by Winthrop Rutherfurd Jr., a Wall Street lawyer, and Anne Fairbanks, an assistant producer with a communications company. Leslie Mackey, who works for a church pension fund, will portray the ''highly susceptible'' Lord Chancellor. That's typical Blue Hill casting, though, to be sure, most members of the troupe have professional training or previous professional experience to back up their work onstage and behind the scenes.

The time is later this year and the 39-year-old battlewagon is out here to test-fire her heavy-caliber guns. She is making 15 knots, signal flags cracking in the breeze. The decks have been cleared because the blast of a 16-inch gun is enough to blow a man's head off if he is too near the muzzle. Even on the bridge, 35 yards from the closest gun, Capt. William M. Fogarty runs the risk of ruptured eardrums. ''Mickey Mouse ears'' are the order of the day, although old sea dogs are prone to stuff wads of cotton into their ears. Suddenly, a Klaxon sounds the warning - ''Aoo-ga! Aoo-ga!'' The guns are about to fire. Out leap enormous orange balls of flame and mustard-colored smoke. The battleship shudders. Then a thunderclap - more a boom than a bang. A blast of hot air smacks our faces, and the steel casing of the ship's funnel ripples as if it were a sail.

Also, I learned from Building Department records that the house is listed as a one-family house. Can my landlord evict me if he had no right to rent to me in the first place?...P.G.,Elmont,L.I.

However, the Los Angeles Philharmonic persuaded Mr. Giulini, its music director, to return to conducting live opera after 14 years of concentrating on his symphonic career. Mr. Giulini, whom many regard as the greatest conductor of Italian opera in our time, led the first of eight performances of Verdi's last opera at the Music Center, an event that reminded any who may have forgotten that the ideal of ensemble opera can be realized in this world when everyone involved cares enough.",1982-04-15T05:00:00+0000

Sources in London said that the last units of the task force - made up of about 25 ships - had left their rendezvous point off Ascension Island, in mid-ocean between Africa and South America, early Thursday, following ships that had left Monday or Tuesday. (Page 1, Column 1.) Britons deeply resent the way the United States has dealt with the Falklands crisis. The Argentines also have been critical of the United States, believing that it was favoring Britain. But many Britons have been offended by what they feel is the lack of more overt support by senior American officials, including President Reagan and Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. Perhaps the strongest resentment has been directed at Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the United States delegate to the United Nations, who attended a dinner a the Argentine Embassy in Washington on April 2, the day the Falklands were seized by Argentina.

However, if the building was erected before 1947 and you occupied the apartment before June 1971, you are protected by rent control and the increases are illegal. Controlled rents may not rise more than 7 1/2 percent a year. If the apartment is not rent-controlled, the landlord can raise the rent by as much as he wants, and you are not likely to get any satisfaction by taking the matter to court.

Disarmament is ''a mirage and a will-o'-the-wisp,'' concluded Salvador de Madariaga, of Spain, chairman of the League of Nations Disarmament Commission and Disarament Conference. No person has ever been better qualified to judge. Persistent failure of an endeavor should cause it to be re-examined, not continued forever in the same manner. Another way must be found to control nuclear war, not necessarily ruling out disarmament, but laying a new foundation for nonbelligerent coexistence.

Consider, as the season in microcosm, that famous opening night when boos greeted Renata Scotto before she could sing a note of her opening aria, ''Casta diva.'' That lack of elementary fair play ranked as one of the season's low points, particularly since not only Miss Scotto but the conductor and the other two principal singers were appearing in their roles for the first time with the Metropolitan. Yes, but ...when all that is taken into account the fact remains that Miss Scotto went on to sing poorly in a punishing role that she should not have been allowed to attempt at this stage of her career.

A country weekend was cut short by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who returned to London when it seemed that Secretary of State Alexabder M. Haig Jr.'s attempt in Buenos Aires to mediate the Falklands crisis was foundering.

us,BUDGET DATES SLIDE BY,"At the time, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 seemed a triumph of legislative self-discipline. Now the budget process has again become an untidy game, as recent history demonstrates (see chart: reading left-to-right, it's a chronology of developments according to fiscal year; top-to-bottom, it tracks events by calendar year and shows that Congress must often simultaneously align one year's budget with reality while planning for the next). Designed to bring order to decisions on how much Government should spend and how much revenue it should raise, the process instead pushes politicians to set precise ceilings on future outlays based on imprecise predictions. Still, most analysts say, any process is better than none. Here is how it was intended to work: Fifteen days after Congress convenes, the President is required to present his blueprint for the fiscal year beginning the next Oct. 1. By April 15 (last Thursday) House and Senate Budget Committees are to have presented theirs (they didn't). By May 15, a First Concurrent Budget Resolution, on which both houses agree, should be voted. It sets limits for general categories of spending - ''Military,'' ''National Resources'' and so on. Authorizing committees then try to cram dozens of specific programs under each ceiling; meanwhile, appropriations committees earmark funds for them. Inevitably the sum total of the appropriations exceeds the First Resolution's targets. The Second Resolution, due 16 days before the fiscal year starts, was intended to provide for ''technical adjustments,'' factoring in inflation, say, or providing for natural disaster cleanups.",1982-04-18T05:00:00+0000

Like most political jokes, it is both true and false. If withdrawal comes on schedule, it will not have the intense emotional overtones for most Egyptians that it is already having for Israelis. But if Israel, at the last moment, decided not to withdraw, Egyptians almost certainly would explode in anger of such dimensions that it might sweep the Mubarak regime out of power, touch off new religious violence and bring a reversal of the country's foreign alignments.",1982-04-18T05:00:00+0000

us,KITCHEN EQUIPMENT,"Buffet dinners are fun to plan. For one thing, there are limitless possibilities for decorating food and combining different dishes for the table. But a major drawback with this kind of entertaining is finding plates and platters that are big enough to hold the food. Most often, guests try to pile helpings on plates that are too small, or they end up standing in line several times over in order to be able to sample all the dishes. At last I have found an attractive plate that is the perfect size for a buffet. It measures just over a foot across - like the oversized plates used for nouvelle cuisine - and is made of cream-colored ceramic glazed stoneware. In spite of its size, the plate is not heavy. Besides its ample girth, the thing I like most about this plate, which is made for Lee Bailey housewares at Henri Bendel is its plainness. I have never cared much for patterned dishes, no matter how beautiful the design. A swirl of colors and shapes detracts from the look of the food and quarrels with the colors of the vegetables and sauces. This dish is completely unadorned, and is appealing both for its classic simplicity and roominess. As a matter of fact I like it not only for buffets, but for regular meals as well.",1982-04-21T05:00:00+0000

Haig Jr. over the Falkland Islands. Despite Mr. Pym's report of a ''bit of progress,'' British officials cautioned that Britain and Argentina were still far apart from a negotiated solution to the crisis. A warning, which was communicated privately to Argentine officials through the Swiss Embassy in Buenos Aires, was issued to all Argentine ships and planes by the British Defense Ministry to stay away from the British fleet in the South Atlantic or risk an ''appropriate response.'' (Page 1, Column 6.) U.S. failure in mediating the crisis over the Falklands would result in American support of Britain, Reagan Administration officials said. They stressed that this was the consensus in the White House and State Department, but that President Reagan had made no formal decision and had set no time limit for breaking the deadlock. Officials said the support would include United States participation in an embargo on Argentine goods, but would not include use of American military forces. (1:4-5.)",1982-04-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Music View; THE ENSEMBLE'S THE THING,"Do you know what ''ensemble'' means? Of course you do. An ensemble is any Easter outfit that costs more than $50, or possibly the threepiece rock group that played at your cousin Eddie's wedding. In everyday use, the word passes as common coin, without causing much confusion. However, ensemble is one of those double-edge words - ''dynamic'' is another - that vaguely suggest something or other to the man in the street and something else, something more precise, to a musician. The lingo of any trade, profession or calling has many such twin-bladed words. When a musician speaks of good ensemble he refers to the kind of relationship among performers that the better string quartets develop, an understanding so close that the group seems to breathe in and out together, one in which individual egos lose themselves in the effort to make something irreducibly, mysteriously whole out of a collection of spare parts. Musicians of the worthwhile sort value this experience so highly that the idea of ensemble takes on an all but mystical quality for them.",1982-04-25T05:00:00+0000

WASHINGTON, D.C.  Color photography is so prevalent today that it is hard to imagine a time when it did not exist. The amateur snapshooter hardly uses anything else, it dominates the mass media, it has important uses in science and technology, and it has even, in the past decade, established itself in the art gallery and museum.","This is, however, a fairly recent phenomenon. Really workable systems of color photography were not developed until 50 or 60 years after the introduction of black and white photography. It was even later, in the 1930's, that the familiar modern forms came on the market. However, color was desired from the very beginnings of photography, and so color photography has a history of early attempts, obsolete processes and pioneering successes that is fascinating and not very well known.",1982-04-25T05:00:00+0000

The concession is deep, probably more extensive than any ever made by a country in a comparable position of military strength. It fulfills a commitment undertaken three years ago, at the signing of the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, in the hope that it would change not only the face of the Middle East, but eventually the underlying dynamics that have brought only war to the region for the last generation. And so today should be a landmark. The question is whether it will also be a turning point.",1982-04-25T05:00:00+0000

us,'PRIVATE' DEATH,"There is a baby girl in a New York hospital with the kind of birth defects for which there is no help. Her parents, doctors and nurses are waiting for nature to take its course, but so far nature has not been kind. Meanwhile, they look for a place in which she can live in warmth and peace. When she sickens, as is inevitable, no extraordinary means will be used to save her; when she dies, her friends will know as much relief as grief. But for the few months that are her life she will have been treated with courtesy, acknowledged as a human being. Another baby was born two weeks ago in Indiana. He had a incomplete esophagus, which is operable, and Down's syndrome, the consequences of which are impossible to estimate at birth. Nature took its course very quickly - he died in six days - but with considerable help. At his parents' request, the infant wasn't fed. The decision, the family lawyer said, was ""a private matter."" Why private? Had that baby been normal, his death by starvation would have been a public concern. But becausehe had been inadvertently robbed of perfection, he was deliberately robbed of life. His flaws somehow canceled out his rights. Two county courts and the Indiana State Supreme Court appear to have agreed: they declined to force his parents to feed ""Infant Doe."" But if children have a chance to live, shouldn't they get it, whether or not their parents are willing? And if they haven't a chance, like that little girl in a New York hospital, shouldn't they be allowed to leave this world in their own good time? Whether to carry a fetus to maturity is still, and should remain, a women's choice.",1982-04-27T05:00:00+0000

If all the new shares are sold, the $500 million to $600 million raised would help finance capital spending by A.T.&T., whose ability to borrow money is being restricted by the pending divestiture of its operating companies. An S.E.C. spokesman, Chiles Larson, said that A.T.&T. was perhaps the first company to register for the sale of stock under the S.E.C.'s Rule 415, which took effect in March on a nine-month experimental basis. Other companies have registered to sell bonds and other debt offerings under the ruling, which is expected to dramatically transform the investment banking business by giving large corporate clients the flexibility to market securities without investment bankers as intermediaries.",1982-04-27T05:00:00+0000
