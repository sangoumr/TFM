His father, Muthamma Nassir, was a chef at Windows on the World and opened the original Yemen Caf in 1986 with a relative, Yahya Alsubai, on the stretch of Atlantic Avenue bordering Brooklyn Heights, a neighborhood clustered with Middle Eastern restaurants and shops. Akram Nassir says it was the first Yemeni restaurant in New York, if not the United States. In 2011, he opened another in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Now, he and his partner, Mr. Alsubai, have branched out to Staten Island. There, they will again serve a Middle Eastern community, he said. The latest Yemen Caf, a spacious room with a traditional fishing boat hanging on one wall, has outdoor seating. As at the other locations, the specialty is lamb more than a dozen ways, notably slow-cooked, succulent falling-off-the-bone cuts like shanks and shoulder. There are also chicken dishes and Middle Eastern appetizers. ",2023-08-01T15:43:27+0000

Voiced by Chlo Grace Moretz, the title character busts into a futuristic world where knights defend the castle and the powerful might not be as benevolent as theyd like the citizens to believe. Based on a best-selling graphic novel by ND Stevenson and directed by Nick Bruno and Troy Quane (who also co-directed Spies in Disguise), this 2023 animated feature from Netflix gives young children a mile-a-minute main character who slides between good guy and bad guy status, defying the usual stereotypes. Stevenson has called the story a transgender allegory, and the L.G.B.T.Q. representation is a welcome change from the usual kids movie universes, where knights fall in love with princesses, not with each other. Here, Riz Ahmed voices Ballister Boldheart, a knight who has been wrongly accused of murdering Queen Valerin (Lorraine Toussaint). Ballister reluctantly allows Nimona to help him take down a corrupt system, prove his innocence and reunite with his partner, Ambrosius Goldenloin (Eugene Lee Yang). As a character, Nimona has zero chill and might prove a little tough for adults to watch for any length of time, but my son was entertained by the characters constant motion, chaotic energy and what-will-come-next transformations.",2023-08-04T11:00:10+0000

us,Caviar Gets Even More Refined,"These days, it seems that some restaurants will add a dollop of caviar to anything, from fried chicken to hamburgers, practically reducing the once-luxurious treat to a condiment. So its perhaps no surprise that chefs are turning their attention to something more rarefied than your everyday osetra: albino caviar, which ranges in color from alabaster to golden, and is the result of uncommon mutations. The most sought after is that of the beluga sturgeon but, says Hermes Gehnen, the founder of N25 Caviar, an international purveyor, restaurants generally cant afford it. Its more for superyachts. At Les Trois Chevaux in New York, the eggs of the Acipenser ruthenus, a small sturgeon known as the sterlet, are shaped into a quenelle tableside and plated with white asparagus, aerated bchamel and beurre de baratte-basted brioche. The monochromatic presentation allows diners to be more cognizant of what [theyre] actually tasting, says the restaurants owner, Angie Mar, 41, who describes albino caviar as supple and velvety. Rasmus Munk, 32, the chef and co-owner of Alchemist in Copenhagen, is drawn to albino caviars beautiful aroma of butter and creamy texture. He serves it atop a square of crisp, sourdough-flavored freeze-dried milk born of his collaboration with an M.I.T. researcher on food for space travel. And at the omakase restaurant the Araki in London, the chef Marty Lau slices white cuttlefish and squid into fine ribbons and tops them with a spoonful of golden roe. Although white caviar stock is limited, they arent the only pale orbs worth chasing. Snail eggs, which have a mushroomlike flavor, have the same visual appeal despite their earthy taste. Just dont assume theyll be a bargain. Sometimes, says Munk, youll pay even more money for snail eggs than you do for caviar.  Lauren Joseph",2023-08-08T11:00:14+0000

In addition to cooking for millions in disaster areas and writing several cookbooks, Mr. Andrs has found the time to research the 17th-century voyage of Hasekura Tsunenaga, a noble samurai considered the first Japanese ambassador to Spain and the Americas (he even visited the Vatican). He has inspired Mr. Andrs; Koji Terano, the head chef of research and development; Manuel Echeverri, Mr. Andrss culinary director for the various Bazaars; and Victor Rivera, the executive chef in New York, to marry Spanish fare with Japanese preparations. The menu has sections labeled fry/tempura with ham croquetas, chicken karaage and red mullet tempura. Plancha/teppan includes baby squid and crispy socarrat, and josper/robata features short rib and piquillos, honey-miso eggplant and grilled marinated carabinero prawns with Japanese condiments. Its a play on the various concepts that are similar, Mr. Echeverri said. Raw Bar, Crudos, Sashimi, Same Thing is a grouping of mostly raw fish preparations. Small bites come under the heading of little starters. The colorful dining room, exuberantly decorated with huge chandeliers and seafaring accents, seats more than 100.

JetBlue Stranded Our Boy Scout Troop in New York City,"I was one of three adults who led a backpacking trip to the Colorado Rockies this past June with six teenage Boy Scouts from Troop 876 of Savannah, Ga. After seven nights camping, our eighth night  June 26  was to be aboard a redeye to Kennedy Airport, followed by a morning flight to Savannah, both on JetBlue Airways. But our Denver departure was delayed over two hours and we missed the connection. We waited for three hours in line, only to politely be told the next flight available was five days later, even after we offered to fly to Atlanta, Charleston, S.C., or Jacksonville, Fla., instead. JetBlue would not provide a hotel. So we opted for a refund (plus $12 meal vouchers), rented two cars and drove 14 hours home, racking up about $1,200 in travel expenses. But when our refunds from JetBlue came through, they totaled $261 for nine of us, only 18 percent of the original cost. A customer service representative later explained to me by phone that we had been reimbursed for only the New York to Savannah leg. We believe JetBlue should have gotten us on an earlier flight on a different airline or at least reimbursed us for the nine fares and fees totaling $1,458, and perhaps chipped in for the expenses to get home.

Walking through Chelsea to Roslers New York gallery, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, past a gaggle of kids scooters parked inside the glass-fronted foyer of a school, I wondered if continuing on with my day as if this calamity hadnt just happened was a necessary form of self-preservation or an unforgivable failure of empathy.

If that place was about bringing people in, Trunks next one, a 25-room property opening Sept. 1, is meant to draw eyes outward, particularly toward verdant Yoyogi Park, a 133-acre green space in northern Shibuya that the new concrete-clad, seven-story building faces. With balconies extending from every room and a rooftop pool club  another rarity for a Tokyo hotel  the idea is not only to bring visitors to a rising corner of the district thats increasingly crowded with cool shops and restaurants but also to give guests a chance to relax away from the thrum while gazing out over the tree line at the metropolis beyond. The design, led by the Japanese architect Keiji Ashizawas firm, with interiors by the Danish company Norm, has all kinds of warm wood touches and beige textures, and the restaurant will serve pizza and Italian food: Not at all rare in Tokyo these days, but comforting nonetheless.

Christianitys imprint on our literature isnt necessarily about piety or doctrine  though that is sometimes the case. It also trucks in paradox and, at its best, acts as a hedge against over-simplistic and reductive notions of society and of person. In American literature, religious ideas are often more implicit than explicit  a pool into which the work dips, often to great effect. James Baldwins soaring, sermonic prose; Toni Morrisons scriptural authority; William Faulkners Genesis-like cosmologies of Southern identity and place: All draw heavily on a Christian-inflected aesthetic. Which is not to elevate this belief system above others in a country as multifaith as it is multicultural and multiracial. To the contrary, among the issues we will encounter in this series is Christianitys tendency to take down its faith counterparts. Christianity can be a real bruiser. It is cherry-picked and jury-rigged, co-opted and corrupted, and yet it remains inextricable from American identity  which is precisely why it repeatedly finds its way into our fiction.",2023-08-24T09:00:28+0000

us,A Locals Guide to Majorca,"Majorca, the largest of Spains Balearic Islands, has been a classic summer destination for Europeans and Brits for decades. But long before the big resorts sprung up along the coastline and villas came with helipads, the islands hilltop villages attracted artists, musicians and writers in search of year-round sun and solitude. Among the best known of those early visitors were the Polish composer Frdric Chopin and the French novelist George Sand, who spent the winter of 1838 in the town of Valldemossa, in the mountains above Majorcas northwest coast. By 1929, when the British writer Robert Graves and the American poet Laura Riding arrived in the nearby village of Dei  at the recommendation of the American writer Gertrude Stein  and later built a home there, that picturesque hamlet of stone houses and olive groves was already a fledgling artists colony. In 1956, the Barcelona-born artist Joan Mir and his family moved to the outskirts of Palma. Plenty of artistic talent was homegrown, too, nurtured by generations of weavers, glassblowers and ceramists. One of Spains most prominent contemporary artists, Miquel Barcel, grew up on the island painting landscapes with his mother and her friends. Among the islands many signature local crafts is the roba de llenges, or cloth of tongues, a style of ikat believed to have arrived from Asia centuries ago via the Silk Road. And its that deeply rooted artistic tradition combined with an extraordinary natural beauty thats attracting the latest influx of creative types. In the last few years, a number of artists and designers have left larger cities in Europe and moved to Majorca. Some of these new arrivals are renovating old houses and farms in and around the country towns of Sller and Dei or choosing to base themselves in Palmas Old Town, where Gothic spires loom over the port, and theres a fresh wave of contemporary art galleries and idiosyncratic shops dedicated to supporting local artisans. All over the island, new or newly revived hotels compete for the most impressive views.",2023-08-25T21:00:28+0000

us,Help! I Fell in Sicily and my Travel Insurance Ditched Me,"Im a 68-year-old solo traveler who was on a tour of Sicily in June 2022, when I fell getting off a bus, breaking multiple ribs, vertebrae and a pelvic bone. I had purchased the RoundTrip Choice plan from Seven Corners Travel Insurance, so I called, expecting they would help coordinate my medical care with Italian-speaking doctors. But they told me to seek help on my own, save the receipts and file a claim when I got home. Our tour guide was an angel, arranging drivers to take me back and forth to the hospital and even interpreting by speakerphone with doctors. Days later I got a doctor to fill out a form (which I had to Google Translate for him) saying I could travel home, as long as I was in a reclining position. My family chipped in to buy a business-class seat for the return flight, a day-and-night trip from Palermo to Munich to New York to Jacksonville. Seven Corners finally paid $5,772 for my bills and missed trip, but refused to reimburse me for most of my business-class fare. Far worse, I believe they failed to provide me the assistance they promised, essentially leaving me to fend for myself and leaving me unable to communicate with hospital staff. I have registered complaints with the Better Business Bureau and the state insurance agencies of Florida and Indiana (where Seven Corners is based), but Ive gotten nowhere. Can you help?

us,H.B.O. Is Tackling Religion in the Most Remarkable Ways,"Its hard to find a doctrine that better explains this countrys political and cultural trajectory over the past 50 years than the so-called prosperity gospel, which reversed the old dogma in one key, seductive way: It came to interpret the attainment of worldly wealth and privilege as proof of spiritual exceptionalism, the rewards of a life lived righteously. Jesus says in Matthew 19:24: And I say again unto you  it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. But across the end of the 20th century, any number of figures built immense and lucrative flocks by coming at that problem from a very different direction: a promise, perhaps, that you might look great crossing into heaven in a camel-hair suit. That this sentiment aligned so well with politically ascendant strains of conservatism may or may not be coincidence, but the net effect was the same. There is the elevation of wealth as a sign of virtue. There is the sense that if only those in need had been more righteous, they, too, might have been blessed. There is, in short, the long, strange trajectory of American temperament that has, on some level, brought us to HBOs The Righteous Gemstones.",2023-08-30T09:01:55+0000

Sometimes, theyre framed by thick, windowpane-like lines that cast the viewer as a peeping Tom.
