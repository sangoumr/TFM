Between now and Easter Sunday, music lovers will have an opportunity to sample the great variety of ways in which musicians have responded to that call. One can hear the Passover story, for example, in Handel's remarkable but too rarely heard oratorio ""Israel in Egypt."" And churches all over New York City are presenting many of the works that tell the story of Easter, including Bach's ""St. Matthew Passion,"" Stainer's ""Crucifixion"" and settings of the Seven Last Words of Christ, by Schutz, Haydn and Dubois. Of equal interest, though, are the works that look beyond Easter. Among this week's offerings, one can hear virtually the entire history of Mass settings, ranging from anonymous medieval English works to Masses by Josquin, Byrd, Haydn, Salieri, Gounod and Durufle, along with the Misa Flamenca by Paco Pena. Interesting, too, are the many works by local composers and church-music directors, among them Kyler Brown, David Hurd, MacNeil Robinson and Calvin Hampton.

The Girls of Summer","One cloudy afternoon in April 1931, Jackie Mitchell, a 17-year-old minor leaguer, took the pitcher's mound against the Yankees in an exhibition game in Chattanooga, Tenn. Mitchell struck out Babe Ruth on four pitches, then Lou Gehrig on three. Mitchell's feat is little remembered; even less remembered is that the remarkable pitcher was a woman. Such a fate has been all too common, Barbara Gregorich observes in WOMEN AT PLAY: The Story of Women in Baseball (Harvest/Harcourt Brace, paper, $14.95). Women have been playing the sport since students at Vassar College formed two teams in 1866. Two decades after professional baseball began in 1869, women formed ""base ball clubs,"" nicknamed the Bloomer Girls. For the next 40 years, these teams barnstormed across the United States, playing men's semiprofessional and minor league teams in exhibition games. The teams were a victim of the Depression, Ms. Gregorich writes, as women were pushed into softball, ""a game significantly less expensive and less difficult to play."" During World War II, Philip K. Wrigley organized the All-American Girls Baseball League, which inspired the recent movie ""A League of Their Own""; the league lasted 12 seasons, until 1954. The book concludes with profiles of two women who attempted unsuccessfully to become major league umpires, Bernice Gera and Pam Postema. Ms. Gregorich has written a novel about baseball, ""She's on First,"" but her writing here is frequently wooden. Nevertheless, she is to be commended for bringing out of obscurity such baseball pioneers as Maud Nelson, Lizzie Arlington, Amanda Clement and Alta Weiss.",1993-04-04T05:00:00+0000

He has served as legislator, a municipal judge, a Congressman, Governor of Connecticut (1955-61), a Cabinet member in the Kennedy Administration, a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations, and a United States Senator for three terms. After 18 years in the Senate, Mr. Ribicoff retired from public life in 1981 at the age of 71. ",1993-04-04T05:00:00+0000

us,WATCH CONGRESS SQUIRM,"Elizabeth Drew, like many writers on campaign finance, misstates the problem (""Watch 'Em Squirm,"" March 14). It's not that special interests have too much power; representing interests is what elected officials in a democracy are there to do. The problem is that politicians' overdependence on campaign contributions gives too much influence to the interests of the rich and leaves the rest of us underrepresented. No campaign finance law can change the fact that the rich have more money to give out than the poor. So no reform will work unless it makes fund raising less important in the election process. Public financing or free air time on television would help enormously. Eliminating PAC's sponsored by labor unions and other mass-membership organizations -- the only means by which small contributors can now have an impact -- would just reinforce the power of the large donors.

Standly, who finished 72 holes at seven-under 281, missed a chance to close out his first PGA Tour title when a birdie putt stopped an inch short of the cup on the 18th hole of the 7,116-yard English Turn Golf and Country Club course. That left the door open for Stewart and Cochran to force a playoff with birdies on the final hole. But Stewart had a 25-foot birdie putt come up an inch short, and Cochran missed from 40 feet. Each shot 69 yesterday to finish at 282. Standly began play two strokes behind 54-hole leader Greg Kraft. Standly had six birdies, five on the front nine despite rain and wind gusting to 25 miles an hour. His only bogey of the day was on the 11th, but he birdied the 12th and then parred in. Stewart, the 18- and 36-hole leader before falling a stroke behind on Saturday, threatened to play himself out of contention with bogeys on Nos. 4, 5 and 7. But he turned in even-par 36 and shot 33 coming home. The $180,000 winner's check is Standly's largest payoff ever. (AP) Johnson Beats the Wind: Trish Johnson of Wales shot a windblown five-under-par 67 to run away from the field for a four-shot victory in the $450,000 Las Vegas L.P.G.A. at Canyon Gate. Johnson, three shots behind the second-round leader, Brandie Burton, when final-round play began, was one of just nine players to break par yesterday as wind gusts reached 40 mph. She completed 54 holes at seven-under 209 for her first victory in six seasons on the L.P.G.A. tour.

A $100,000 loan would cover the $91,000 balance on the original mortgage, and provide extra cash for home improvements. They found a bank offering a 15-year, fixed-rate loan at 7.75 percent, and set a date for an appraisal fo the house. The appraisal was a shock: The house was worth $21,000 less than the $121,000 the Aynats paid for it in 1986. Because their mortgage balance was now 90 percent of the market value of the house, the Aynats would need mortgage insurance, even for a loan of $90,000. And their new monthly payment of about $1,100, which includes mortgage insurance, would be nearly identical to their old one. Even so, the Aynats decided to refinance.

The same thing happens to fish, shellfish and vegetables, only faster: browning draws the juices from the center to the surface, but with less fat inside to mitigate the flow, a second too long and the succulence becomes cardboard. This is particularly so when sauteing a thin fish fillet or a tiny shrimp and a Spartan amount of fat is used.

The most imposing task is in casting: to find a tenor who, over more than five hours, is able to sustain good tone, often in a high tessitura, and create nuanced interpretations against an orchestra often blaring fortissimo. This tenor must also seem hopelessly callow and blustery one hour (""a regular Li'l Abner type,"" Anna Russell once said) and incurably passionate the next. And at the end of his quest he must find a soprano of surpassing power to justify the first love duet in Wagner's cosmic history, leaving far behind the opera's fairy-tale dragon, shattered sword and riddle-posing god.",1993-04-12T05:00:00+0000

us,ART,"Today ""THINKING IS FORM: THE DRAWINGS OF JOSEPH BEUYS,"" Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan. As a sculptor, performance artist and teacher, Joseph Beuys tried to redefine art, but on paper his spidery drifting line can be positively Old Masterish. Arranged rather pointlessly around an enormous installation piece involving blackboard drawings, this exhibition spans more than three decades of works that especially in the early years ar often exquisite. Through May 4. Also at the Modern: ""MAX ERNST: DADA AND THE DAWN OF SURREALISM."" An in-depth loook at the early development (1912 to 1927) of an artist of implicitly Surrealist sensibility, who also seems to presage post-modernism in his avoidance of a signature style and his use of existing images. Included are wonderful little Expressionistic paintings, startlingly seamless collages and the paintings of the early 20's, which are often memorable for their glowing colors as much as for their haunting scenes and juxtapositions. Through May 2. Also at the Modern: ""JOHN HEARTFIELD: PHOTO-MONTAGES."" A Berlin Dadaist who understood the threat of Nazism from the first instance, John Heartfield (1891-1968) helped invent photomontage and used it to fight for Germany's consciousness and soul. His bitterly satirical, passionately clear-sighted and brilliantlycomposed images, which appeared on book covers and left-wing magazines, are poltical art. This exhibition is the first full-scale surveyof Heartfield's achievement in the United States. Through July 6. Hours: Thursdays, 11 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Fridays through Tuesdays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; closed Wednesdays. Admission: $7.50; $4.50 for students and the elderly; free under age 16. Information: (212) 708-9480. ""SPLENDID LEGACY: THE HAVEMEYER COLLETION,"" Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street. Call it an inhouse blockbuster, a museum-within-a-museum or full disclosure. This show presents the cornucopia of paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and decorative objects that the American sugar baron H.O. Havemeyer and his prescient wife, Louisine, gave the Metropolitan in the decades around the turn of the century. From Rembrandt and El Greco to numerous works by Courbet, Degas, Cezanne and the Impressionists, form Japanese screens and Chinese vases to Islamic ceramics, it is a staggering exhibition. It tells a tale of esthetic passion, opulent living and tremendous public spirit, while also outlining much of the history of art in fine style. Through June 20. Also at the Met: ""THE GREEK MIRACLE: CLASSICAL SCULPTURE FROM THE DAWN OF DEMOCRACY, THE FIFTH CENTURY B.C."" Despite its overblown title and flimsy thesis, this exhibition offers a rare chance to see some of the most esteemed masterpieces of Classical Greek sculpture on American soil, and under exceptionally good viewing conditions: in the natural light of the Lehman Wing. The idealized male nude known as ""Kritios Boy"" is here, as are ""Nike (Victory) Unbinding Her Sandal"" and a section of the Partheon frieze. They probably won't be passing this way again. Through May 23. Also at the Met: ""DAUMIER DRAWINGS."" Daumier's skills as a caricaturist, with which he supported himself, are widelyappreciated, but the full extent of his drawing talent, his knowledge of art history, and his command of the human face and form can now be more thoroughlyappreciated, thanks to this survey (the first in the United States) of 100 works on paper, punctuated by several paintings, prints and bronzes. Through May 2. Also at the Met: ""THE WAKING DREAM: PHOTOGRAPHY'S FIRST CENTURY."" The invention of photography enabled the world to know itself in a new way, and that new knowledge illuminates this astounding exhibition. With 253 often rare, usually breathtaking images from the Gilman Paper Company Collection, the show begins with some of the first photographs ever made, from England and France in the early 1840's, and ends with photography's artistic coming of age in the first decades of the 20th century. It is a compelling in hand with the will to document and the desire to create. Through July 4. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, days 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; closed Mondays. Admission: $6; $3 for the elderly and students. Information: (212) 535-7710. ""PICASSO AND THE AGE OF IRON,"" Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street. In Paris between the world wars, Surrealist automatism and Cubist collage yielded a new offspring, the welded iron sculpture of Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonzalez, with its inventive use of scrap metal and the fluidity of ""drawing in space."" This small sculptural revolution, quickly joined by Alberto Giacometti and the young Americans David Smith and Alexander Calder, is recapitulated at the Guggenheim in an elegantly installed, fabulously spacious exhibition that shows both the art and Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral to great advantage. Through May 16. Hours: daily except Thursdays, 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. Admission: $7; $4 for students and the elderly; free for children under age 7. Information: (212) 423-3500. ""1993 BIENNIAL EXHIBITION,"" Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street. With a heavy emphasis on preachy, often language-laden political art, this exhibition sticks its neck out by having a much more distinct point of view than its predecessors. The rsult is less a picture of the art of our time than of the times themselves, with genuine visual communication kept to a minimum; some of the best moments come in the show's unusuallygood film and video sections. Lobby,second floor and film program, through June 13. Third and fourth floors and video program, through June 20.Hours: Thursdays, 1 to 8 P.M.; Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; closed Mondays and Tuesdays.

The invention of Cubism set off artistic aftershocks all over Europe, most fantastically in Czechoslovakia, where its effects were strongest in the applied arts, not the fine arts. This exhibition of more than 100 drawings and objects created between 1910 and 1925 examines the flourishing of what might be called a Cubism of everday life; it includes furniture, ceramics and metalwork as well as architectural renderings of the Cubist buildings of Prague. Through July 25. Hours: Tuesdays, 10 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Wednesdays through Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission: $3; $1.50 students and the elderly; free onTuesdays after 5 P.M.

The blossoming of German art over the last three decades is inseparable from the multifarious malleability of the photograph. Including painters like Gerhard Richter and Sigmar Polke among its 19 artists, this exhibition elucidates the way artists inother media have made photography an essential part of their enterprise. It alsogives equal time to relatively straightforward photographers, like Bernd and Hilla Becher, who have refused to see their metier as a second-class medium. Through May 9. Hours: Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 10 P.M.; closed Tuesdays.

Morgan Jr. continued to add to the collection that his famous father had so grandly begun, making important acquisitions and opening the library to the public in 1924. This exhibition of more than 300 works features illuminated manuscripts, rare printed books and autographed manuscripts; it is the first comprehensive display of the younger Morgan's collecting achievement.

Includes nearly 100 extraordinary artworks from sub-Saharan Africa: masks, figures, textiles, architectural fragments and reliquary objects.

A tribute to Rboert Bishop, whodied last year after serving as director of the museum from 1977-1991, this exhibition commemorates both his impact on the museum's collection and on the definition of folk art itself. Ranging from portraits by the 19th century artist Ammi Philips to Shaker seed boxes and including contemporary folk art, it offers something for every taste, purist and otherwise. Through Sept. 12.

The pants become a stem to a variety of jacket styles, sweaters and ponchos. Some wearers sport matching striped jackets, or jackets of a different stripe, carrying the elongation to its extreme. A group of three wearers (above) presented a striking effect as they stood against a railing.",1993-04-18T05:00:00+0000

When Warfare Took Off","As the guns of August roared in northern France and on the borders of the German and Russian empires, and as soldiers dug the entrenchments where they would fight for the next four years, warfare took to the skies for the first time. In flimsy machines built of cloth, wood and wire, the new knights of the air engaged in one-on-one combat during World War I in which skill and luck combined to create a different form of chivalry. LEGEND, MEMORY AND THE GREAT WAR IN THE AIR (Smithsonian Institution/University of Washington, cloth, $34.95; paper, $18.95) both debunks and enriches the myths that developed almost immediately around military aviation. The authors -- Dominick A. Pisano, a curator in aeronautics at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, and Thomas J. Dietz, Joanne M. Gernstein and Karl S. Schneide, all curatorial assistants at the museum -- describe how military commanders developed the strategies that remain part of the doctrine of air warfare to this day, how they learned through trial and error what was effective, and how aviators lost their lives as the subjects of these experiments. The book also details how myths about aerial combat were formulated in contemporary propaganda, posters for movies made a half-generation after the war, and the misty-eyed memoirs of aces. ""Legend, Memory and the Great War in the Air"" is a concise synopsis of the origin of a modern form of combat and its impact on our culture.",1993-04-18T05:00:00+0000

Shcherbo, who won six gold medals at the Barcelona Olympics, added the vault and parallel bars titles to the all-around championship he had won Thursday. Miller, a 16-year-old high school student from Edmond, Okla, floundered on the beam, one of her strongest events, and finished last. But the American won a gold in the floor exercises to add to the all-round and uneven bars titles she had already won. The American women's team wound up with three golds, all won by Miller, and two silver medals won by Dominique Dawes. (AP) TENNIS Sampras Is King Kong of Hong Kong Pete Sampras, the world's top-ranked player, won a showdown with second-ranked Jim Courier yesterday, beating the former No. 1 player, 6-3, 6-7 (1-7), 7-6 (7-2), to win the Salem Open in Hong Kong. Sampras, who took over Courier's top ranking last week when he won the Japan Open, won the first set with a service break in the sixth game. Courier squandered two break points in the sixth game of the second set. Both Americans held their serves, with Courier winning the tie breaker, 7-1. Courier saved a match point in the 12th game of the third set to force another tie breaker, but this time it was the 21-year-old Sampras who won it with ease. Sampras hit 15 aces in the final, which lasted nearly three hours. He now has a 7-2 record in matches against Courier. (AP) A Title for Goellner: Marc Goellner of Germany won his first career title by coming from behind to beat Ivan Lendl, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, in the final of the Nice Open in France. It was the first final on the ATP Tour for the 6-foot-6-inch Goellner, ranked 95th in the world. He had never gotten past the quarterfinals of a pro event before Nice. It was the 143d career final for Lendl, who has won 92 titles. Goellner had to win three qualifying matches to get into the main draw. He reached the final with a victory over top-seeded Stefan Edberg. Yesterday, Lendl broke Goellner's serve three times in the first set. But after that, Goellner did not lose another serve. In the second set, the 23-year-old Goellner broke Lendl, 33, in the fifth game to take a 3-2 lead and hold it for the rest of the set to even the match.

The 34-year-old Martin ran shoulder-to-shoulder with Rico over the last four miles before showing the kick that had made him a Commonwealth champion. The winning time was 2 hours 10 minutes 50 seconds. Rico clocked 2:10.53 for second, while Gajdus Grzegorz of Poland was third in 2:11.07. Dorre finished in 2:27.09.

(AP) SOCCER Team Needs to Practice Celebrating Steve Morrow scored the winning goal yesterday as Arsenal defeated Sheffield Wednesday, 2-1, to win England's League Cup. But victory had a price, as Morrow ended up being carried from the field with an injury that was sustained when he was tossed in the air in celebration. Morrow's winning goal came in the 68th minute and was his first for Arsenal. But when his teammates tossed him into the air after the game, they failed to catch him. And as they accepted the trophy, Morrow was carried off the field on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face. It was later determined that he had broken an arm. Sheffield Wednesday went ahead, 1-0, on a goal by the American John Harkes in the ninth minute. But Arsenal got the equalizer in the 18th minute when Paul Merson volleyed home a curling 25-yard shot. Harkes, of Kearny, N.J., became the first American to score a goal in a Wembley Stadium final. Two years ago, he became the first American to play in a Wembley final. The two teams will meet again in the final of the more prestigious FA Cup final at Wembley on May 15.

The Finns took a 1-0 lead four minutes into the second period when Mike Richter, Olczyk's Ranger teammate, gave up an easy goal to Jarkko Varvio. It was the second tie in the tournament for the Americans, who scored a late third-period goal to tie the Czech Republic 1-1 in Sunday's opening game. The tie also left the United States in fourth place in Pool B with 2 points. Germany also has 2 points but a better goal differential than the United States, while the Czech Republic and Finland each have 3 points. The four top teams in each pool advance to the playoffs next week. In a game played in Munich, Geoff Sanderson of the Hartford Whalers had two goals, including the go-ahead score on the first penalty shot of his career, to lead Team Canada to a 4-1 victory over defending champion Sweden. With the score tied at 1-1, Canada was awarded the penalty shot after a Swedish defender covered the puck in front of his goal. The Rangers' Mike Gartner scored his second goal of the tournament in the victory, and goaltender Bill Ranford of the Edmonton Oilers had another exceptional game, making 36 saves after posting a shutout on Monday.

us,They Opened in Vilna,"Until his death in 1985, Joseph Buloff was one of the leading actors in Yiddish drama. ON STAGE, OFF STAGE: Memories of a Lifetime in the Yiddish Theater (Harvard University, paper, $29.95), written with Irving Genn, a family friend, combines selections from Buloff's reminiscences and correspondence with the memories of his wife and leading lady of 60 years, Luba Kadison. Much of their fascinating story concerns the Vilna Troupe, the celebrated Yiddish theater company where the two began their careers. Humor, pathos and occasional hyperbole characterize the authors' descriptions of the improvisation and absurdism that were part of everyday life for Jews in the Eastern Europe of the early 20th century. When Yiddish was prohibited on the stage, actors were instructed to ad-lib in a variety of tongues, even in gibberish, if the local secret police arrived. Buloff claims to have introduced the theater of the absurd with his expressionistic production in 1925 of ""Singer of His Sorrows,"" which Eugene Ionesco told Buloff influenced his own anti-naturalistic writing style. The couple made their way to New York in 1927. They appeared with Maurice Schwartz's famous Yiddish Art Theater. They also formed an amateur theater group in Chicago and toured South America. In the 1930's, Buloff made a successful transition into American theater and film, appearing in such Broadway hits as ""Oklahoma!"" and ""My Sister Eileen.""

Although radon in soil-gas leaking into homes causes 20,000 to 40,000 deaths annually in the United States, about the same number as AIDS, it is not generally realized that radon in drinking water has also been implicated by one research worker, Prof. Douglas G. Mose of George Mason University, as being a possible cause of breast cancer. Unlike electromagnetic fields, radon is a Class A carcinogen, that is, an agent known to cause cancer. Long Island is not very different in residential atmospheric-radon risk from most other places in New York, but the question of radon in Long Island water supplies, especially household water taken from individual wells, has not been addressed. Professor Mose's research suggests that we should look into this on Long Island.",1993-04-25T05:00:00+0000
