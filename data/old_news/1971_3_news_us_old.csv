us,Sporting Club' Opens,"Never, never have the good old days of Hollywood seemed so golden, at least lately, as with the unreeling of a new something-or-other titled ""The Sporting Club"" at the Coronet.

Toward the end, the building is dynamited (after repeated hints that the Vietnam War is undermining things). The club members, men and women, stagger around in the ruins to a thunderous soundtrack rendition of ""Battle Hymn of the Republic.""Earlier, 20 minutes or so, there was a smaller-scale dynamiting of a new dam, at which a rally of war veterans and American Gothic types is being held. Hoping, praying that was the end, I reached for my shoes. No such luck.But the picture finally does end, after more hints, in a wallow of sex and violence (the facade of America?). As the color camera whips around in a frenzy of half-shadows, the braying club members strip down for a mass orgy. And we guarantee you've never seen such a repulsive array of flabby, middle-aged blubber.Studiously plunked down and magnified in a naturalistic, woodsy setting, the stilted, elliptical dialogue, the heavy stylization of the performances and the insistently pointed direction of Larry Peerce (of ""Goodbye, Columbus,"" believe it or not), render it a plodding artificial bore.Lorenzo Semple Jr. has adapted the source, a novel by Thomas McGuane, which a reviewer for this newspaper said ""almost put him to sleep.""

us,Young Wife Fulfills Herself as a Robber:Barbara Loden's Film Opens at Cinema II ' Wanda' Improves With Its Turn to Action,"Barbara Loden's Wanda is a passive, rather stupid young woman from the Pennsylvania coal country who one day leaves her husband and her children, and wanders off into a series of minor misfortunes until, by curious accident, she finds herself the accomplice of a small-time thief who aspires to rob a bank. With the thief, a middle-aged aspirin freak and a most uncivil man, she achieves a kind of hopeful, noncommunicative rapport. And in the climatic bank attempt, a superb sequence, she displays a degree of mere competence that must count for the high point in a life almost wholly given over to lows.I think it worth remembering that ""Wanda,"" which opened yesterday at Cinema II, is a crime melodrama, and not simply a study of its protagonist. It is to the acceptance of the demands and the freedoms of such melodrama that it owes the best of its many virtues.""Wanda"" must rank as that cinematic rarity, a movie that really does get bettermuch betteras it goes along. Once it finds its action, which takes a while, it seems willing to subordinate character to action. Such subordination suggests a classic arrangement of dramtic priorities. And Miss Loden's film, by the time you are through with it, has, rather surprisingly, some of the look of classical moviemaking.Surprisingly, because ""Wanda"" has on the surface all the earmarks of a certain depressed, modish naturalism that with many lesser filmmakers is supposed to stand for truth and invariably takes the place of beauty. The eroded, semi-industrial landscape, the grainy blown-up 16mm print that makes everything look just a bit worse than it is, the mostly nonprofessional cast that specializes in lacunae in the dialogueall seem pretty familiar. That is, until things begin to move, which is just about when Wanda meets her Mr. Dennis. He happens to be burglarizing a bar, when she drops by to use the John and cadge a free beer. Then the film begins to look tight and tough and very economical.The film's technique (handheld camera; sharp cuts with no fades or dissolves) then appears necessary and exciting. And the performances begin to seem necessary too. All the non-actors in the early part of ""Wanda"" greatly embarrass Miss Loden, who is at pains never to steal a scene from them. But with the excellent Michael Higgins, who, with glasses and steel-gray hair, looks like certain late photographs of James Joyce, and who is highly professional, enough changes so that she has her role as well as her reticence, and she becomes freer, more varied, more interesting to watch.As the credits indicate, ""Wanda"" is very much Miss Loden's work. It would be hard to imagine better or more tactful or more decently difficult work for a first film. I suppose it is significantly a woman's film in that it never sensationalizes or patronizes its heroine, and yet finds her interesting and not (as it might have) just interestingly dull.But I like it best because it seems at home with its idioms, close to its action, opening up only rarely (during a model airplane meet, in the fatal bank job) and to moments of genuine insight and not admiration-begging cinematic claptrap. Wanda is a small movie, fully aware of its limits, and within those limits lovely.",1971-03-01T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Power Over Women':Tale of Love Explores Life of 'Right Guy' Rod Taylor Plays Role of Rock Singer,"John Krish's ""The Man Who Had Power Over Women"" is a silly movie that wastes the talents of a generally good cast headed by the estimable Rod Taylor and including several very pleasant women. The title suggests all kinds of secret titillation, but the title is something of an ironic joke. ""The Man Who Had Power Over Women"" is really about true love, healthy sex and what a crummy racket public relations is for a basically right guy.Taylor plays the right guy, and he publicly represents a rock singer (Clive Francis), who, I guess, is the man with the power. To console him for his miserable life, for having to act like a rat even though a private quiver of distaste always lets us know he really isn't one, and for the frigidity of his nevertheless beautiful wife (Penelope Horner)  he has only his income, his Jaguar, his principles, the occasional favors of at least three terrific girls, and the perfect mate for the mind and body in Carol White, who happens to be married to his best friend.Although it sounds pretty much like every third movie you've ever seen, ""The Man Who Had Power Over Women"" enjoys a small distinction in the wonderful ease with which it resolves each of its insurmountable problems.Thus, no sooner does the frigid wife ask Rod Taylor for a divorce (because he's so sexy, I think) than Carol White falls into bed with him. And no sooner does she fall than her husband and his buddy (James Booth  who, thank goodness, didn't love her anyway) is conveniently killed under a truckload of toilet bowls. Rod Taylor feels very sad, and he cries for his pal before running off with the widow  having meanwhile plugged the vile rock star in the jaw, to signify independence.No actor could survive this material, but Rod Taylor, whose face really looks like a fund of worldly trust, does pretty well.

One would therefore think that national and local task forces would be searching for other solutions to the welfare problem. But the White House  though it is still planning to revive FAP, as welfare experts now call it  is preoccupied with revenue sharing. And Mayor Lindsay and Congressman Wilbur Mills, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who are trying in different ways to have the Federal Government take over welfare, are worrying about who pays the bill. None of the programs, FAP included, can do much about the welfare problem itself. That problem is really in the heart of the American economy, which simply does not need all the unemployed looking for work at a living wage and which cannot provide for all the working poor who require higher wages to support their families. Ultimately, therefore, an end to the welfare problem requires either remaking the economy so that it produces full employment at a living wage, or altering public beliefs about welfare so that the Government will provide the unneeded and underpaid with a decent income.",1971-03-07T05:00:00+0000

Satie's detestation of music that must be listened to with one's head in one's hands and his espousal of a purposely banal and decorative musique d'ameublement (furnishings music, or as we would now say, background music) have been guiding contemporary composing styles for many years. It is a line that runs straight from Debussy to John Cage. But in recent years, composers have been pushing Satie's witty little ideas into philosophical, technological and acoustical realms that might have delighted his ironic sense. For, mirabile dicta, what the Satie road has led to is sound that seems to be decorative background but demands to be listened to seriously, like Satie's Socrate.",1971-03-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: A Series of Minor Victories: The Tender Moment' Is at 34th St. East Shows Understanding of People in Love,"Of all the kinds of movies, perhaps the hardest to write about is the movie of romantic pathos, which is a principal backbone of the many-backboned film industry. It is hard because we assume that everything has been said about it (and, really, very little has been said), because we have never, despite a lot of propaganda to the contrary, achieved an articulate respect for erotic impulses, and because critical response still favors big subjects over little ones, public event over private nuance. Thus the paradox of a critical establishment that two years ago proclaimed, to pick at random, ""Medium Cool"" as significant cinema and now complains that it is being ""manipulated"" (a favorite word) by ""Love Story.""And thus it would be easy to demolish Michel Boisrond's ""The Tender Moment,"" which opened yesterday at the 34th Street East. A musical score, piano and orchestra, (Francis Lai) so corny it might make Elmer Bernstein blush; a collection of attractive occupations and preoccupations for the characters that is as self-evidently stage decoration as are the interiors of the terrific or, at the very least, charming apartments in which everybody livesall of it eyewash or earwash and all of it as traditional, as conventional and potentially moving as, say, the pastoral conceit in lyric poetry of the Renaissance.Olivier (Renaud Verley), the young protagonist of ""The Tender Moment,"" is more of a literary extremist, preferring Eluard or Middle English love poetrywith both of which he courts Frdrique (Nathalie Delon), an older woman of 25 and mistress of an even older racing car driver (Robert Hossein), who has so far given up the ghost, he'd as soon marry the girl. Olivier meets Frdrique over a traffic violation, follows her to a fabulous Alpine ski resort, where he beds her (Hossein is off racing the Indianapolis 500), returns with her to Paris, neglects his studies, leaves home, wins his womanand finally gives her back to her loverwhose claim is not only prior but, Olivier realizes, considerably more permanent.What one derives from this material, aside from the pleasures of its various wish fulfillments, has a lot to do with how one responds to the manner of a pickup, to the understanding of a first night, to the whole drama of sexual attraction. For it is in such matters that Boisrond reveals his skill, his reticence, his decency, his feeling for a kind of psychological truth that is uncluttered either by earthshaking revelation or moral condemnation. His understanding of people in love, like his employment of the pathetic fallacy (a fine rain storm at the end to accompany Olivier's self-exile), belongs to a series of minor victories in very ordinary modes. But the victories, if small, win valuable ground, and they are why ""The Tender Moment,"" for all its no surprises, is a refreshing experience.The cast is serviceable, if undistinguished, and Nathalie Delon (Alain Delon's wife) happily suggests healthy appetites in the kind of role that too often feeds on Victorian mush. The minor parts (especially Bernard Le Coq as a pal and beautiful Katia Cristina as Olivier's family's all-purpose live-in maid) are especially well-handled. But in ""The Tender Moment,"" everything in the world plays a background to love, and it is as if Paris streets and mountain ski-trails really did contain and define all the important lessons and pleasures of the soul.",1971-03-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Nelo Risi's 'Dead of Summer':Jean Seberg Portrays Woman Going Insane,"Nelo Risi's ""Dead of Summer"" is the story of one woman's rather too elegant (for my tastes) descent into lunacy, set in midsummer, mostly in a dazzlingly chic modern apartment that is isolated in the same, exotic North African landscape in which Andr Gide's ""Immoralist"" found liberation and Paul Bowles's existential bank teller attained swift, sweet nothingness. Even though Africa is now, in most areas, politically free and no longer dark, it remains fiction's favorite boneyard for incurable romantics.The English-language, Italian-French co-production, which opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvous, displaysor, rather, it exploits, for its own pretentious purposesall of the symptoms of its psychotic heroine, Joyce Grasse (Jean Seberg), the American wife of a German architect working in Agadir.Like Joyce, the movie stares at objects and people without blinking, without comprehension, seeing not objects and people but signs and omens, as well as reminders of some terrible event that might have happened, or might have been simply wished for and dreamt of.When Joyce wakes up on a Sunday morning, she is wearing a cocktail dress. A beggar stares at her from the scaffolding of a building across the way. She stares back. She turns on the shower and is splattered with sandy water that looks like blood. She later comes upon a life-size, inflatable rubber doll that could have been used as some kind of kinky sex object. After all, her husband is (or was) German, and from the larger-than-life photographs of him around the apartment, he looks like the sort of man who should be hiding out in Argentina.Has Joyce actually shot her husband and hidden his body in the laundry basket?It's rather difficult to tell, not because we share Joyce's confusion, but because the camera, which is anything but confused, arbitrarily lowers its gaze everytime we flash back to What Happened.According to this film's producers, Risi, the director of the highly regarded ""Diary of a Schizophrenic Girl"" (which I did not see), has attempted to create a new form of psychological suspense drama by omitting ""explanatory particulars and postscripts."" Instead, they say, he ""makes strong demands on his audience's intellectual responsiveness with laboriously constructed scenes which are . . . rich in revealing, often subtle detail.""The movie is richer in dcor than subtle detail, and the effect of Risi's ellipses is, paradoxically, to make a short story last a good deal longer than our interest can be sustained.There's a further paradox in that the thing that sustains our (at least, my) interest in the film is the physical presence of Miss Seberg, who is hardly the world's most interesting actress, even under the best of circumstances. She is, however, one of movies' most interesting objects. In the years since ""Breathless"" and ""The Five-Day Lover"" her beauty has ""set,"" like plaster of Paris, attaining, curiously, a new perfection in definition as it has hardened. She moves with style, which is sometimes awkward, and behind that extraordinary mask, there is real intelligence.Risi apparently shares my enthusiasm for the star. Aside from a young man who plays her husband's Arab boyfriend, and a doctor who comes on to tell the lady, who has clearly lost her marbles, that ""half of the people in the city are in the same shape"" (which may be the most subtle line in the film), ""Dead of Summer"" is a one-woman show, a Seberg celebration that I can recommend only to other members of the committed band.",1971-03-10T05:00:00+0000

Just when he thinks he has lined up the author's intent, changes. These volatile alterations in emphasis and direction don't seem to trouble the author. Somehow the book manages to be something more than its parts. In spite of its jigsaw structure, the book compels the reader's interest. The result is certainly proof of Mrs. Lessing's skill and vision. But as her previous works have revealed, she is not one whose novels necessarily fall into easy categories. Perhaps these changes in key and concern are only ways of permitting her to declare herself on a number of topics. Since, like most of us, she is not interesting at all times, some of her disquisitions, no matter how exotic in setting or fanciful in incident, are vacuously selfevident. Sometimes in fact she becomes so intent on the preachy side of her fiction that the novel limps to a halt. Yet even these sections are absorbed into her story.",1971-03-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Double Suicide',"The Japanese playwright Monzaemon Chikamatsu died in 1724, but with the opening of Masahiro Shinoda's ""Double Suicide"" at the Bijou yesterday and Kenji Mizoguchi's great ""The Crucified Lovers"" at the New Yorker today, both closely based on his work, he becomes, like Shakespeare, like Neil Simon, one of the better represented dramatists in the city. But unlike Shakespeare, Chikamatsu, at least in these two plays, deals with problems of bourgeois domesticity. And unlike Neil Simon, his mode is tragedy.Shinoda's film concerns a paper-shop owner of Osaka (Kichiemon Nakamura) who neglects his business and ruins his young family in order to court and to buy the redemption of a woman of pleasure (Shima Iwashita) with whom he is in love. Ultimately the pressure of patient wife (also Shima Iwashita) and impatient in-laws, relatives and rivals, grow too great, and he runs away with his courtesan to consummate his love and commit the suicide to which the two of them are fated.Fate figures pretty heavily in ""Double Suicide,"" a bit more heavily, I suspect, than in Chikamatsu's original, which is a puppet play. Shinoda begins with puppets (a direct connection with the bodies of his dead lovers, which he also introduces very earlyso you may know the end at the beginning), and all the way through his movie he retains the puppeteers  black-cloaked, black-masked figures in the background or the foreground, who help change sets, assist the characters and see the action to its conclusion.It follows that ""Double Suicide"" understands that its story is theater, and that its space is theatrical. It is a very modernist reading of classical material, turning walls into stage flats, noticing that substance is insubstantial, and, in its multiple approaches to truth, feeling a good deal like Pirandello.All this may sound very interesting, but I am afraid that it sounds more interesting than in the issue it actually is. For one thing, Shinoda (whose other work I have not seen) seems a tirelessly arty directorwith his camera, his props, his lights and his shadowscontinually discovering effective composition where others might find a revelation or two.But more importantly, all his attempts to distance his material really do distance it (although he allows his actors a good deal of emotion) and suggest an intellectual's mistrust of mere event. Where Mizoguchi in ""The Crucified Lovers"" uses the multilevel spaces of his middle-class houses to build a complex dramatic environment, Shinoda uses potentially similar spaces to indicate a complicated stage set. It is as if he felt the idea of a theater were enough to replace a theater or if he thought that the elaborate mechanics of a metaphor were in themselves a meaning.",1971-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Love Turns 'New Leaf' at Music Hall,"When Henry Graham (Walter Matthau) learns that his fortune has finally run out, he is overwhelmed with quite reasonable self-pity. ""All I amor wasis rich. It's all I wanted to be."" Henry's butler agrees: ""You'll be poor in the only real sensein that you'll have no money."" The desperate problem demands a desperate solution: Henry decides to many an heiress and then get rid of her with all possible dispatch.""A New Leaf,"" which was written and directed by Elaine May, who also costars in the film, is the story of Henry's reluctant character reformation through the love of a rich woman. It's also a beautifully and gently cockeyed movie that recalls at least two different traditions of American film comedy to which I've always been partial.Not since the two-reelers of the 1930's in which Edgar Kennedy, the genius of the slow ""burn, made his accommodation with the idiocies of Florence Lake, his bird-brained wife, have there been displays of anger, frustration and greed as marvelous as those of Matthau in ""A New Leaf."" Then, too, ""A New Leaf"" shares with the great screwball comedies of the Depression an almost childlike appreciation of money: it may not buy happiness, but having a lot of it helps.Essentially, however, ""A New Leaf"" is a love story, since Henry Graham and Henrietta Lowell (Miss May) are eccentrics who could have been made for nobody but each other. He is a misanthropic, suspicious, hand-tailored, high-living playboy, whose preference is for Chateau Lafitte '61, while she is a sweet, trusting, sloppy, near-sighted botanist, who drinks Mogen David Extra Heavy Malaga (""every year is good""), and who also happens to be loaded with money.Although Miss May's approach to the writing and directing of film comedy is pretty consistently at the blackout-sketch level, reminiscent of her collaborations with Mike Nichols, the quality of the sketches in ""A New Leaf"" is so consistently high, and its cartoon characters are so human, that criticism of its form becomes academic. The entire project is touched by a fine and knowing madness.I've always been aware of the fact that Matthau is an excellent actor, who is at his best in comedy, but until now I've only been able to suspect this of Miss May. Her Henrietta Lowell is a kind of spin-off of the gauche ladies who used to confront Nichols on television, but she's also as honestly appealing as she is funny. This has the effect of giving a surprising dimension to the kind of slapstick routine in which a lady manages to put on a Grecian-style nightgown by sticking her head and her left arm through the gown's only arm hole.However, it doesn't do to describe too many details in such a comedythey should be discovered. Everyone in the supporting cast is appropriately lunatic, especially James Coco, as Matthau's stingy uncle, who plans to leave his fortune to Radio Free Europe, but possibly excepting George Rose, as Matthau's philosophical butler, a role once played (more swishily but no better) by Eric Blore. Mostly, however, I admire Miss May's accurate appraisal of the weird world in which we live, in which peppermills are transistorized and sports cars are built to run faster than is possible on any highway.""A New Leaf"" opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall under something of a cloud. Miss May sought, unsuccessfully, to enjoin the film's opening and to have her name removed from it on the grounds that Paramount, which financed the film, was releasing a version of which she disapproved.Not having seen Miss May's version, I can only say that the film I saw should be a credit to almost any director, though, theoretically at least, Miss May is right. The only thing that gives me pause is the knowledge that its success will probably be used in the future as an argument to ignore the intentions of other directorsbut with far less happy results.",1971-03-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Lucas's 'THX1138':Love Is a Punishable Crime in Future,"""THX 1138"" is derived from a prize-winning short that George Lucas made a few years ago while a graduate student at the University of Southern California. Under the auspices of the young San Francisco film company American Zoetrope, Mr. Lucas, now 25 years old, expanded his project into the feature length science-fiction movie that opened yesterday at the Loew's Cine and Loew's State 2. I have a good many reservations about the film's ideas, but they are greatly outweighed by my admiration for a technical virtuosity that by fair means and foul achieves exceptional emotional intensity at the same time.Set in a sanitized, computerized, monasticized underground society of the future, ""THX 1138"" concerns a technician (Robert Duvall) whose roommate (Maggie McOmie) decreases his daily required sedation dosage to the point where he feels desire and they make love. Apprehended for this (a capital offense), he is placed in some kind of wall-less prison that, like everything else in this society, works better in theory than in practice. Together with two companions (Donald Pleasence and Don Pedro Colley, who plays a mistakenly materialized TV image he begins an escape that for sheer suspenseful invention would do credit to the best of adventure films.""THX 1138"" is considerably more than an adventure film, but it is also considerably less than major prophetic fiction. Despite a sustained solemnity in approach and a musical background as ominously ponderous as that of ""Last Year at Marienbad,"" ""THX 1138"" works with much potentially comic material (I think that Mr. Lucas is aware of this) and in the design of itsconsistently beautifulphotography, observing white-garbed figures against an often undifferentiated white background, it sometimes resembles the kind of minimal-information cartoon that was indicative of good taste in animation a few years back.""A few years back"" might almost be a motto for ""THX 1138,"" because whatever horror lies ahead, I don't think that anybody now seriously imagines that it will take the form of a de-emotionalized asexual society enslaved by its own models of technical efficiency. In this respect Mr. Lucas's film looks like a slightly old-fashioned anxiety dreambut if you can accept that (and you should), it becomes very potent material indeed.""THX 1138"" is aided by lovely performances  not only Donald Pleasence, who with typical appeal plays a pathetically enterprising wheeler-dealer in a world that makes no deals; but also Robert Duvall and Maggie McOmie, who must achieve a kind of human identification without highly individualizing characteristics. Miss McOmie's story is pure pathos, and as it materializes in her so vulnerable flesh and then passes into electronic data it becomes one adequate image of the sadness that attends us all.",1971-03-12T05:00:00+0000

Since the film is its own mark of achievement, it must also be noted that, despite its commendable sincerity, it is often as callow as its principals' dedicated but fumbling efforts to make it as people and movie makers.Its title notwithstanding, this amalgam of documentary, cinema vrit and reenactment is the diary of Brandy (Michaux French) and Stanton Kaye. Through off-screen narration and onscreen dialogue, we follow Mr. Kaye (herein called Simon Weiss) through his early youth, in his drive to make movies in his native Los Angeles, his arrival here to join with his ""patron,"" Brandy, to make a movie; their personal relationship on a cross-country auto trip to her native Chicago and L.A. and back again in a strained affair that ends in apparent contentment complete with a baby daughter, cats and a dog.As noted, there are reprises of the action from Brandy's view as she falls in love with Simon but is flatly rejected by him long before the happy ending. And we are also introduced to their parents and friends in vignettes that, like the entire account in this movie about them and their movie, are often static and rarely emotionally equal to the muted anguish and trials projected by the dialogue.Miss French, a petite but unspectacular brunette, and Mr. Kaye, a largely placid type despite the problems, who reportedly are in their twenties, are obviously devoted to their film. If it occasionally leaves the impression of a home-made movie, their unusual inspection of themselves leaves no doubt of their honesty and, perhaps, potential.""Brandy in the Wilderness"" will be shown through Sunday and repeated next Thursday through Sunday.",1971-03-12T05:00:00+0000

""It just means that nobody gets enough.""It's the measure of the film's characters, and of the film itself, which has no real overview, that they talk about love as if it were sex that could be poured from magnums, like champagne. Soap operas, and the audiences that watch them, are most fond of this sort of verbal conceit, which has the ring of wisdom and the effect of relieving characters of responsibility for their actions. Because love runs out on them, instead of the other way around, people are free to indulge themselves in the most unrewarding kind of self-pity.Like most soap operas, ""The Buttercup Chain"" has within it some legitimately interesting but largely unexplored human relationships. France (Hywel Bennett) and Margaret (Jane Asher) are first cousins, born of twin sisters on the same day and raised as brother and sister. They never consummate what is, actually a non-incestuous love, but their guilt is such that it makes them both incapable of loving anyone else. When Margaret comes to live with her cousin in London, he immediately expands his household to include a young Swedish architectual student (Sven-Bertil Taube), whom he picks to be Margaret's lover, and Manny, the American girl, who becomes his mistress.On idyllic holidays in southern Spain, in the English countryside and, finally, in Sweden, the mnage  quatre explores the various heterosexual possibilities of mating to the apparent satisfaction of no one, except possibly Robert Ellis Miller, the director (""The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter"").Miller and his screen writer, Peter Draper, avoided any revealing psychological confrontations in favor of making one of those depressingly modish movies in which the sensations created by things like slick photography, beautiful nudes and intrusive soundtrack music become the substance of the film, instead of its context.In addition to the four leads, who have the physical graces of youth and something of its stridency, the cast includes Clive Revill, a fine if middle-aged (41) actor, as the millionaire who, like Father Christmas, pops in and out of the lives of the young quartet, bringing presents of picnic hampers and champagne, as well as a decent reticence otherwise lacking in the movie.""The Buttercup Chain,"" which was the British entry at last year's Cannes film festival, opened yesterday at the Baronet Theater.",1971-03-13T05:00:00+0000

In the next 30 years, immigration rose precipitously, resulting in fear of competition from cheap Chinese labor and eventual passage in 1882 of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Professor McClellan reveals a curious ambivalence in America: on the one hand, the Chinese were considered barbarous and inferior: on the other, the Manifest Destiny people felt we should protect China (resulting in. the Open Door Policy) and ultimately civilize her. Underlying this confusion of feeling was America's insecurity about her role in the wide world and its rather grandiose thoughts about its role in the Far East. At any rate, American views of China have been stereotyped, uninformed and a product of wishful thinking. An interesting approach to the roots of our continuing and, on the whole, disastrous China policies.",1971-03-14T05:00:00+0000

She holds the mind's other guests in ardent contempt. She appears for meals only to dismiss the household's own preoccupations with writing well as decadent. For more than twenty years now she has been registering, in a torrent of fiction that increasingly seems conceived in a stubborn rage against the very idea of fiction, every tremor along her emotional fault system, every slippage in her selfeducation. Look here, she is forever demanding, a missionary devoid of any but the most didactic irony: the Communist party is not the answer. There is a life beyond vaginal orgasm. St. John of the Cross was not as dotty as certain Anglicans would have had you believe.

us,A Satirical Visit to a Greedy Small Town,"Like Paul Mazursky and Larry Tucker, who hit the Hollywood bigtime with ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,"" Bud Yorkin (the director) and Norman Lear (the writer) are social satirists bred in television, where satire not only is aimed at rather obvious mass attitudes, but also is severely limited by the optimistic attitudes of the same masses. The Yorkin-Lear ""Divorce American Style"" thus became a kind of TV situation comedy about one of America's favorite pastimes. The contents were often surprisingly accurate and cynical, but the packaging was cheerful, pure Saran really.""Cold Turkey,"" which opened yesterday at the Victoria on Broadway and other theaters around town, is Mr. Lear's first solo venture as writer-director-producer, with Mr. Yorkin as executive producer. And it is, within its limitations, a very engaging, very funny movie. The Saran is still there, but it is wrapped around a lot of typical, nasty humor and old-fashioned, clean-cut vulgarity.It's the sort of movie in which the President of the United States is shown running around the country trying to horn in on somebody else's national publicity stunt (and mostly failing); in which a fine, upstanding Protestant minister sleeps with curlers in his hair, and in which the vocabulary of a nice, fanatically anti-Communist, little old lady is pretty much restricted to Jennifer Cavilleri's favorite eight-letter word, which she uses incorrectly.""Cold Turkey"" is, basically, a gimmick movie, but Mr. Lear is so skilled a formula practitioner that most of the variations he works on his gimmick amused me, instead of setting my teeth on edge.Hiram C. Grayson (Edward Everett Horton), the ancient, senile head of a huge tobacco company, is persuaded he'll win an immortality equal to Alfred B. Nobel's by presenting $25-million to any town that can give up smoking for 30 days. The only town that succeeds in signing all its citizens to the no-smoking pledge is Eagle Rock, Iowa (pop. 4,006), an economically depressed area whose social life centers around parties for burghers fleeing to Des Moines and Davenport.How Eagle Rock meets its terrifying challenge is dramatized by Lear in a series of frantic, more or less hit-and run sketches that involve Bob and Ray, impersonating just about every television newsman who has ever become bigger than the events he reports (Walter Chronic, David Chetly, Hugh Upson, among others), as well as (in news clips) Mrs. Patricia Nixon, Shirley Temple and Vice President Agnew.The Eagle Rock citizens, who come apart in their various, spectacular ways in the course of the test, include Dick Van Dyke, as the town's leading minister, who is not above comparing himself to Albert Schweltzer and Popes Plus, John and Paul, and whose only concern for his wife is that she not slouch; Pippa Scott, as his wife, a sad, dreamy, secret smoker; Tom Poston, the town's positively lyrical drunk; Vincent Gardenia, the mayor; and Judith Lowry, the foul-mouthed old fighter against Communism and Big Government. There also are a number of other eccentricly realized, comic stereotypes played with exuberant, hammy joy by people like Sudie Bond, Jean Stapleton, Barnard Hughes and Barbara Cason.Lear shot his film entirely on locations in Iowa, which explains not only its decent, generally unsentimentalized rural beauty, but also, perhaps, its decent, generally unsentimental attitude toard its characters. There are moments when the movie makes a few, half-hearted attempts to say something about the evils of greed and avarice, but its concerns are both more immediate (to get laughs out of things like false teeth and flatulence) and its intentions more specific (to question the economic system that must punish as it rewards).""Cold Turkey"" is not terribly significant satire. It was madeafter allto amuse the very people it is satirizing, but it does this with such hustling, commercial vitality that I found most of it irresistible, even, I might add, when the jokes about catarrh had begun to produce not laughs but wheezes.",1971-03-18T05:00:00+0000

us,' When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth' in Neighborhood Houses,"A tale of cavemen and the cavewomen who love them, Val Guest's ""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth"" opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters. Just as she is to be sacrificed to the misbehaving sun, blond Sanna (Victoria Vetri) falls off a nearby cliff into the tumultuous seas below. Miraculously escaping the wild surf, she swims into a cyclone. She almost drowns, but by lucky chance the crew of a passing raft rescues her. On the raft is Tara (Robin Hawdon), who turns out to be the man of Sanna's dreams.How Sanna and Tara, against all odds, against her people and his people, natural disaster and human wickedness, brachiosauruses and pterodactyls, win their right to true loveand how of the sun the moon is born, creating the tides that in the nick of time drown all their enemiesthis requires comment, consideration, praise, perhaps a poem. But not, I think, movie criticism as we commonly practice it.And yet there is no doubt that ""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth"" answers several thorny questions, such as when and how the moon was formed: After the coming of man, before the extinction of the dinosaurs, and to the accompaniment of a choir of heavenly voices. At the same time, the film fosters a healthy historical humility, for the sight of Miss Vetri, or Magda Konopka, or Imogen Hassall, or many others in their mastadon-skin bikinis, is enough to demolish distance and shatter the perspective achieved through several hundred thousand years of civilization's march.Toward dinosaurs the film is scrupulously fair, recognizing that there were friendly dinosaurs as well as unfriendly dinosaurs, but that most were merely indifferent. In the course of her travails, Miss Vetri grows close to one dinosaur (a stegosaurus, I believe) and to its appealingly playful offspring. But my favoritethe source of my favorite moment in the movieis a fierce triceratops, which, madly pursuing a bothersome caveman to the edge of a precipice, simply doesn't stop running and so falls off the precipice and into a bottomless abyss. You can see how an animal like that, lacking all wisdom and self control, would have low survival value.""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth"" presents a special language problem because it is in Caveman, and without subtitles. However, Caveman isn't a very extensive language (27 words and no grammar), and you quickly learn by watching that ""zak,"" for example, means ""gone away.""Since almost the entire movie consists of Sanna going awayfrom the people, plants and animals who want to do her inthe phrase ""Sanna zak!"" serves for perhaps 85 per cent of the dialogue and gives a tremendous boost toward understanding the action.",1971-03-18T05:00:00+0000

The language is violent, colors are stark, the imagery reduces humans to their animal status. The overriding impres sion the poems leave is of man trapped by God, by nature and by woman. The re sponse to his poems is visceral. In reviewing the poet's earlier Hawk in the Rain, the late Edwin Muir spoke of the author's admirable vio lence. It's not an adjective one would apply to the current volume. One can admire the workmanship, the force and precision of language.

us,More Laughable Than Shocking:Gloria Grahame Cast in 'Blood and Lace',"There's a good deal of blood and a minimum of logic, or lace for that matter, in ""Blood and Lace,"" which was exposed in local theaters yesterday, to illustrate, we assume, that horror can be both vague and silly. Exposed also are Gloria Grahame and a clutch of decidedly lesser-known performers in a low-grade exercise in shadows, screams, traumas and slayings that are largely more laughable than shocking.There is, for openers, the hammer murder of a prostitute whose daughter, Melody Patterson, a blond chick beside herself with neuroses, hate for her mother and a yen to find her father, is sent to the local orphanage run by Miss Grahame.Miss Grahame is not a standard type. She needs the money she gets for operating her sylvan concentration camp and when youngsters try to break out, she has them caught with the aid of her wacky handy man, Len Lesser, who dispatches them with a cleaver and hangs them up in the orphanage's basement freezer.In the convoluted and mindless plot, Miss Grahame indicates through dialogue that is neither scientific, clear nor reasonable that she has a thing for preserving bodies.Everyone, it might be noted, gets his just deserts, including a social worker (Milton Selzer) with eyes for Miss Grahame; and a middle-aged detective (Vic Taybeck) who, it turns out in the ironic, climatic twist, has more than a casually amorous relationship with our young heroine.The haggard Miss Grahame, who simply walks through her assignment and at one point says, somewhat wistfully, ""Oh, yes, I was young once,"" also ends up in her own deadly freezer. That frigid ending, at least, seems proper, even if ""Blood and Lace"" is hardly a recommendation for freezers or flimsy films in the genre.",1971-03-18T05:00:00+0000

I mean that handy diffusion of salt in water, as available as your local ocean, that, when the Army and the Navy and the Atomic Energy Commission have failed, proves to be the only thing that will shrivel a Triffid or shrink a Monolith Monster down to size.Somebody has introduced a bit of ultimate ocean (the Pacific) at the end of ""The Andromeda Strain""one of several additions, plus a few subtractions, that have been made in Robert Wise's screen version without in any way improving upon (in my opinion) Michael Crichton's dreadful novel. In general the drift of the filmmakers has been to heat things up: laser beams rather than curare guns to complicate the crises; a littlewell, I shouldn't call it romance, but the kind of girl (Paula Kelly) with whom there might be romance once this awful mess is overand a momentary crunch of conscience for the Wildfire scientists when they discover, quite gratuitously, that their benevolent top-secret project is really a cover for research in germ warfare.Wildfire, from deep in its fifth sub-basement super-antiseptic laboratories in Nevada, has been engaged in tracking the extraterrestrial reason that almost the entire population of a little Arizona town died one night when they opened up the nose cone of a retrieved satellite. The assembling of the scientists (Arthur Hill, David Wayne, James Olson and Kate Reidno one of whom gets a chance at a real performance) and their biological research against time is all the action of ""The Andromeda Strain.""Crichton put his novel together as if from a collection of note cardsa story outline beefed up with a lot of semi-scientific data. Wise preserves the impoverished positivism of Crichton's method (even to dividing his screen in a dull bid for informational range) but necessarily assigns most of it to his actors. The result is that, except for an odd 30 seconds here and there for individualization (not characterization), everybody delivers exposition right up to and through the last lines of the film.Despite all the drama of the situation (United States threatened with biological destruction from outer space, etc.) nothing very exciting goes on in ""The Andromeda Strain."" Since nobody greatly feels or acts, we are left with the drama of people tensely sitting around in chairs, twisting dials and watching TV monitors. From time to time, somebody gets up and paces the room.Occasionally ""The Andromeda Strain"" returns to the sacred texts, not of science but of science-fiction, and admits its five vulgar resources  as in the sea water, or when in the massive microscope the alien green matter suddenly shimmers and expands, and in agonized horror the Nobel Prize-winning bacteriologist turns to the distinguished microbiologist with, ""My God, it's growing!""",1971-03-22T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen: Making It,' the Story of an Adolescent","""Making It,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet Theater, is about Phil Fuller, a 17-year-old Albuquerque high school student who has read Joyce and Hemingway and Miller, who says that Willa Cather is ""girl's stuff"" and that Salinger sentimentalizes adolescence. The movie presents Phil's literary credentials, which we have to take more or less on faith (although we do see him carrying a copy of ""Tropic of Cancer""), as if to certify his sensibilities, but it has the secondary effect of reminding us of other, more complex fictional world, beside which Phil's is as simplistic as it is bleak.In its own, rather backhanded way, ""Making It"" sentimentalizes Phil's adolescence by placing him in a world circumscribed by well-meaning failures and idiots, all of whom are over 30 and thus, according to the gospel that Phil has had preached at him in movies like this, either envy him or mistrust him.His widowed, mini-skirted mother, who insists on acting like a sister to her son, wakes up at night crying over her lost youth. Yvonne, the wife of the football coach, seduces Phil, who then junks her at about the time she reaches her 30th birthday. Mr. Mallory, Phil's English teacher who is defeated by things like a haggard wife and crying babies, urges Phil to become committed to something, to grow up. He finally does, or so we are led to believe, when he accidentally finds himself assisting at his mother's abortion.""Making It,"" which was written by Peter Bart and directed by John Erman (his first theatrical feature), quite happily avoids a lot of the more hysterical clichs of most under-20 movies. There are no riots, no psychedelic sequences. The soundtrack music is kept to a minimum. But Phil is such a mild, non-particular sort of fellow that it is impossible, at least for me, to become terribly involved.It is perhaps significant that the only moving moments in the film involve the feelings of other characters, such as those of his mother, nicely played by Joyce Van Patten as a sort of pretty, but passive, perennial stenographer, or they involve a certain amount of cruelty, as when Phil turns-on the mother of his girl by giving her a mashed up Marlboro, which she thinks is pot.At the heart of the film is Kristoffer Tabori's performance as Phil. He is a handsome, intelligent young actor, yet what he does kept reminding me of the sort of formances Margaret O'Brien used to give by using adult gestures imposed on her by a drama coach. I should add that at the time I saw the film I did not remember that Mr. Tabori, the son of Viveca Lindfors and Don Siegel, the director (but who uses the surname of his stepfather, George Tabori, the playwright), had actually been a successful child actor on the New York stage some years ago.Phil, of course, spends a good deal of his time in ""Making It"" playing roles, as man-of-the-world (with a fake mustache), as guidance counselor to his adolescent mother, but when Phil drops his disguises, Mr. Tabori seems to find only a rather well-varnished, professional teenager. Like the movie itself, the performance is composed of details, all of which are accurate enough but which are never fitted together to make an especially meaningful experience.",1971-03-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Transient Life':Incestuous Love Theme of Japanese Import,"Akio Jissoji's ""This Transient Life,"" which opened on a double bill with Kihachi Okamoto's samurai drama ""Kill!"" at the Bijou yesterday, is an on-going story of incestuous love that runs for rather more than two hours. It is, all at once, a good deal to take. But I think it is worth taking, for reasons that include both its extraordinary theme and its ambitious, proficient and sometimes impossibly fancy-narrative technique.Set in a modern Japan that preserves its ancient artifacts and fragments of some of its ancient beliefs in a physical environment of gorgeous dense lushness, ""This Transient Life"" concerns a middle class college-age brother and sister who on a rainy afternoon discover one another's bodies and begin an affair that neither intends to end.The girl becomes pregnant. The brother arranges for her to marry a family servantan upright but sexually tormented young man who nevertheless makes an excellent husband and father until, discovering his wife and her brother making passionate love, he kills himself.Two more men the brother has contact with die: a carver of images of the Buddha to whom he apprentices and whose renewed sex life in middle age (the brother's influence) leads to a heart attack, and the carver's son, who in seeking revenge, fatally stabs himself with one of his father's tools.If the action sounds extreme, I had better indicate at once that it is, and that I have described only part of it, and that it is all immensely complicated by a visual style that means to employ every rhetorical device of which the camera seems capable, and by an intellectual program that in mediating between time and eternity really does try to deal with every potential of the film's title.""This Transient Life"" is therefore evocative, ironic, lyrical, bitter, grotesque, sensuously beautiful, contemplative, active, philosophicaland  quite elaborately, lustful.In combining these impulses, the film succeeds perhaps a third of the time, which isn't a bad average, and which makes for interesting watching if only in the exuberance of the effort. Apparently, not a man to flinch at the obvious, when Jissoji wants to tell us that his hero, in the midst of love-making, considers the bone beneath the flesh, he rings a bell and in a series of flash cuts shows us literally some bones beneath the flesh.At his most intense, for example, when he is simultaneously presenting four strands of action on the screen plus an unaccompanied cello suite on the sound track, Jissoji overfills the cup of artistic expectation by a considerable margin. But he never underfills it, and in the movies as in all things, more is more.Jissoji's approach to filming, cutting things up, continually discovering by means of the camera pan and track, has a way or making performances seem more resonant than perhaps they really are. I liked everybody, especially Ryo Tamura, who plays the brother with a kind of sullen intelligence, and the girl (I do not know her name) who plays the image carver's slatternly and appealing young wife.""This Transient Life"" is the kind of imperfect, enormously ambitious movie that again and again, and at the most unlikely moments, breaks through its pretensions to a genuine complexity of vision.",1971-03-23T05:00:00+0000

That's manifestly ridiculous. Weaver is cursed by many problems. He admits as much with almost a straight face, manfully fighting back the merriment that bubbles within him. He has four regular outfielders. Having a fourth may be ac ceptable for bridge, but it becomes awkward in a game that normally calls for three outfielders at a time. How does he shoehorn them all in? It's a pitiful situation. A midwinter trade with San Diego brought Pat Dobson Baltimore and the big righthanded pitcher has the poten tial to become a 20game winner. Since the Orioles already have three 20garners in Dave McNally, Mike Cuellar and Jim Palmer, an instant difficulty becomes apparent. How does a manager manipulate four 20garners into a rota tion?

us,Friends' at the Paris,"The last 10 minutes of ""Friends"" is a deeply touching finale, after a pair of runaway mid-teenagers deliver their own first-born in a remote cottage in Provence where they have lived for a year. The sequence is tastefully handled by the director, Lewis Gilbert, and played with affecting simplicity by the youngsters, Sean Bury and Anicee Alvina. And the beautiful color photography of the marshy Camargue area frames the conclusion idyllically.Finally, and at long last, this rather exasperating drama has scored its point about pure love and two neglected young people isolated from the contemporary scene. Until then, the point takes forever, tediously hovering over the unhappy protagonists in Paris, then setting them up, inch by inch, in their rustic retreat.They are nice children but not especially interesting, until the extremely belated consummation of their tender love. And some of their dialogue has a curiously naive, singsong quality, rendered accordingly.The adults are generally relegated to the sidelines, and the dignified behavior of the two young people is at odds with the thumping pop rock musical themes on the sound track, with two grating tunes yodeled by Elton John, a current favorite.

It's a revealing moment becauseuntil that pointwe have no reason to believe Mr. Tibbs is anything more than an honest cop who does his job as well as he can.Mr. Poitier is an actor-producer of unique economic clout at the boxoffice and thus, I think, it can be safely assumed that that line did not get into the script by accident. It was somebody's inspiration and it was put there to make a point. Because it didn't really fit into the story, it could only be saying something about a real-life career. Here was Sidney Poitier, wearily acknowledging the apotheosis by which a good actor was being transformed into an exalted public figure, a man more or less forced into second-order movies (""They Call Me Mister Tibbs,"" ""The Lost Man"") that demand, not performances, but visitations.With ""Brother John,"" which opened yesterday at the Astor and Loew's Theaters, the apotheosis of Sidney Poitier is now complete, celebrated in a stern, finger-pointing fantasy that has the apocalyptic aspirations of ""Samson and Delilah"" and the vision of ""Search for Tomorrow."" At last Mr. Poitier has taken on a fictional role that matches his lofty public image, an image reinforced by performances of which disengagement has, more and more frequently, been the key.In ""Brother John,"" Mr. Poitier couldn't be more disengagedhe plays nothing less than God's messenger, an impeccably tailored, world-traveled, multi-lingual angel who, born some years before in Hackley, Ala., as John Kane, has returned to his home town to make one final audit before Judgment Day. Since this is familiar, ""In the Heat of the Night"" country, it's no surprise that Hackley is very much on edge.The black workers at the Hill-Donaldson plant are on strike and are becoming impatient. The red-neck sheriff is nervous. He's been warned that a union organizer is coming down from the North. The district attorney, an opportunistic rat, is looking for any disturbance that will help him become Governor (and thus, apparently, unseat George C. Wallace). An out-of-county reporter arrives. Says the sheriff ominously: ""When The New York Times takes an interest in a town like this, we're going to have trouble.""However, what trouble there is in Hackley all takes place off-screen. ""Brother John"" is interested in neither people nor issues, nor even, I suspect, in making much of a case against bigotry, prejudice, cruelty and environmental pollution, all of which get passing notice at one point or another.It is, rather, completely concerned with the proper presentation of its handsome epiphany, James Goldstone, the director (Winning""), is constantly discovering Brother John against aurorean backgrounds of sunlight or blazing white walls. He also favors close-ups that are so tight you get the sensation that you're looking at Mr. Poitier through some Olympian mail slot. Ernest Kinoy's script is no less self-conscious, but then it must be inhibiting to write dialogue for an angel who's not supposed to be funny, who was born in the midst of a thunderstorm and who will return, we are told, ""on the day of the big wind.""There are some good people in the castWill Geer, Bradford Dillman, Beverly Toddbut they all look pretty foolish under the circumstances. If ""Brother John"" is a disasterand it isthe responsibility is Mr. Poitier's, whose company produced the movie and hired everyone connected with it. Time has run out. It's too late to believe that he's still a passive participant in his own, premature deification.",1971-03-25T05:00:00+0000

us,A Lot of Speed and Loads of Hair,"It must have seemed a sure-fire idea. So many dumb movies have been saved by an exciting automobile chase in the last few minuteswhy not make a dumb movie that is nothing but an automobile chase? And perhaps it is a sure-fire idea. At least that is a way of explaining my pleasure in Richard Sarafian's ""Vanishing Point,"" a movie about which I can think of almost nothing good to say.The chase begins in Colorado and ends against a pair of massive bulldozers in California, and it is wholly the idea of one Kowalski (Barry Newman) who is supposed to deliver a car from Denver to San Francisco but in so doing gets involved in a personal race with time, and then with the cops, and then, I guess, with his own fate. A kind of supercharged, overaged, four-wheeled easy rider, Kowalski doesn't show much mindbut he shows lots of hair, lots of heart, lots of soul, and a terrific memory.About the hair, more in a moment. The heart we know, because everytime somebody chasing him goes careening off the road, Kowalski, despite his break-neck pace, always stops to make sure the fellow gets up and walks away from the wreckageand the fellow always does. The soul we know because we are continually reminded of it by a character named Super Soul (Cleavon Little), a blind, black disk jockey unaccountably working out at some dust bin crossroads, who follows the chase on police radio, broadcasts encouragement to Kowalski and thereby makes him an instant culture hero with young people throughout the Far West.Thus Kowalski's public image, though essentially unclear, is very well advertised. He is, according to Super Soul, ""The last American to whom speed means freedom of the soul."" And speed, to this pill-popping last American, means everything you might imagine. But his private images are much more fun, for Kowalski is one of the best flash-backers in the businessalways recalling moments of physical crisis just at the most photogenic danger point or moments of sexual satisfaction when the flesh is warm, the hair is tawny and the focus is mellow.As for the present, the chase is managed with a fairly conventional taste for excitementmuch soft-shoulder work, too much dust, and far too much evocation of grind of the open road.I suspect that Barry Newman really can act, though in ""Vanishing Point"" all he needs is a driver's license. In his first movie, ""The Lawyer,"" he played a fictionalized F. Lee Bailey. And now, aspiring to heavy youth identification, he looks quite accurately like F. Lee Bailey in a fright wig.The nicest thing about the movie is the womennot only Victoria Medlin and Gilda Texter, both beautiful in supporting roles, but also the extras, glorious kids who cheer Kowalski on or line up to oversee his doom. I fear that the gift of ""Vanishing Point"" is not freedom of the soul, but rather a certain pang at being stuck in New York and missing all those great girls in Colorado, Utah, Nevada and eastern California.""Vanishing Point"" opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.",1971-03-25T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: Unusual Journey:' Silence Has No Wings,' From Japan, Bows","""Silence Has No Wings"" is the first feature directed by Kazuo Kuroki, a Japanese filmmaker about whom I have no information other than that he made this film in 1966 after having directed a number of documentaries.In this day of over-communication by press release, by underground rumor and even by Sight and Sound, it's as refreshing as it is rare to come upon a filmmaker so completely anonymous that his work really can stand on its own. However, in the case of new Japanese filmmakers I'm never quite sure whether an ambiguity is intentional, or simply the work of the occasionally fanciful translators. ""Butterfly,"" says one subtitle, ""is eagle and flies between swans.""""Silence Has No Wings"" is a collection of life's turning points, or crises, mostly having to do with love, faced by a succession of unhappy people to whom a tropical Nagasaki caterpillar  itself facing a turning pointbecomes, quite literally, attached on its chance migration from southern to northern Japan.The journey, by train, jet and shank's mare, begins in Nagasaki, moves on to Hiroshima and Osaka, takes an inscrutable leap to Hong Kong, returns to Yokohama, then makes the big leap to Hokaido. It is herein the film's nicest, least self-conscious sequence  that the-caterpillar, newly evolved into a butterfly never before seen in Hokaido, is caught by a small boy. The child is immediately accused by his elders of attempting to promote a scientific hoax only slightly less iniquitous than that of the Piltdown Man.Mr. Kuroki approaches his fiction obliquely, which I like, never overwhelming his characters with exposition, but then, as if he didn't trust himself, he overwhelms them with symbols, heavily meaningful juxtapositions of character against background (cemeteries, junk yards, slums and the like), and, finally, with straight-out allegory.Somewhere towards the end of the film, when the director is (I think) having his say about the crimes of capitalism (or maybe the capitalism of criminals), the passive worm becomes the object of a small gang war. Says one banker (or perhaps industrialist) to another: ""We'll lose a lot if it becomes a butterfly."" Lines like that can turn critics gray overnight.I have no way of knowing for sure, but I have the impression from ""Silence Has No Wings"" that Mr. Kuroki was a young man in the 1950's or early 1960's. It's not his fondness for stop-action, for reverse-negative printing, nor for alternating sweeping long shots with slow pans across a section of human skin, so closely seen that you can't tell whether you're looking at an elbow or a drumstick. Rather it's that replay of the A-bomb explosion, which, with the Coca-Cola bottle, was the trademark for an entire school of Japanese avant-garde filmmakers between 10 and 15 years ago.",1971-03-26T05:00:00+0000

Arthur Mizener has now affixed the original title to his account of Ford's life where it fits a bit loosely. A dis appointed life, yes. A sad story rather than a tragic one. Ford was that physical impossi bility for heroic tragedy, a fat ro mantic with a wal rus mustache. He wrote 81 books, of which only 5 are now easily available. He was, for two brief, fi nancially disas trous periods, the best literary edi tor of this cen tury. And he was, as he got older, such a grandiloquent fibber that he often obscured his very real achievements with ridiculous curlicues: a critic who admired him lamented that it is difficult to take seriously a man who so recklessly exposes himself to the charge of asininity. His embroideries hurt his own reputation, but did they harm anyone else? Mr. Mizener's 600 pages record a life of elephantine ab surdities, not one act of malice or mean ness.

us,Innocence Unprotected':Makavejev Directs Yugoslav Feature Orphan Loves Acrobat Despite Opposition,"Dusan Makavejev's marvelous ""Innocence Unprotected,"" which opened yesterday at the New Yorker, is different enough from any other movie you are likely to have seen to deserve some special explanation.The original ""Innocence Unprotected"" was the first Serbian talking picture, filmed in Belgrade in 1942, under the noses of the Nazis, and for the absolutely nonpolitical purpose of making money. After the war, the film suffered a certain eclipse, at least partly because it pushed the birth of the Yugoslav talkie back into a pre-history when nothing like that was supposed to have happened.Nada, the heroine of ""Innocence Unprotected,"" is a beautiful orphan whose obnoxious stepmother wants her to marry a rich, old, evil and rather unhealthy seeming man. However, true to the concept of a sound mind in a sound body, Nada loves the acrobat Aleksic, and her love is well placed. For after a particularly hairy episode with the rotten old man (Aleksic is at that moment capping his career as he hangs by his teeth from an airplane flying over Belgrade), the acrobat arrives in the nick of time, pulverizes the competition and removes the lady, via tightrope, to a future of presumably everlasting athletic bliss.""Innocence Unprotected"" was written, directed and co-produced by one Dragoljub Aleksicwho also wrote the songs and of course starred himself in his own character. Rather a lot of the old movie is given over to Nada's reveries on the prowess of her hero, each reverie accompanied by appropriate footage showing Aleksic breaking chains, balancing on monuments or hauling hundreds of pounds in weights or people high above the city by means of his wonderful teeth.Aleksic survived, as did all but one of the cast, and I suspect that it was the personality of this charming egomaniac (and true enough national hero) that led Dusan Makavejev in 1968 to make his own tribute to ""Innocence Unprotected"" and those unsung pioneers of the Yugoslav commercial cinema.Makavejev's method is to take big sections of the old film, variously tint them (and hand-color some details), and intercut them with newsreels of the German occupation, Nazi propaganda films, and interviews with the crew, the cast and especially with Aleksic still triumphant. I have some reservations about the mixing of Aleksic's melodrama with the drama of the occupation, but not many about the original film itself and none at all about the sensibility the present director brings to his old folks and their old movie.He describes ""Innocence Unprotected"" as ""the art of a metropolitan half-world . . . on the margins of an industrial culture and morality, somewhere between cafes and circus entertainment, cheap literature and melodramatic trash,"" and he sees this art as finding both intellectual and financial viability in the anarchy fostered by the Occupation.Obviously, Makavejev, (known here for ""The Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator""1967) brings an exceptionally sophisticated understanding to his project. But it is also an exceptionally understanding sophisticationironic, loving, clear-sightedly appreciative of all illusions. For this, rarer than most things on film, I value Makavejev's extraordinary insights into ordinary affairs and his gentle juggling act with Acrobat Aleksic.",1971-03-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Corman's 'Gas':Kips Bay Attraction Is Part of Retrospective,"To the extent that Roger Croman's ""Gas"" is an end-of-the-world movie, you mightif you were taking leave of your right sensesdescribe it as both his ""Weekend"" and his ""Shame,"" although it's far less funny than Godard and a good deal more pretentious than Bergman.According to the Corman vision, which has actually become less poetic since ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" in 1957, a strange nerve gas turns everyone who is over 25 into an instant ancient, thus leaving the world to the young people, who lose no time in repeating the mistakes of their elders.""The film opened yesterday at the Kips Bay Theater as the climax of a four-week retrospective devoted to approximately 30 of the almost 50 movies that Mr. Corman has directed since 1955. (He has produced an additional 40 or so.) As anyone who has followed the Corman career must know, he has special gifts for sensational melodrama (""The Wild Angels"") and fruity horror romance (""Masque of the Red Death""), which he has been free to exercise largely because he works fast and makes films that always look as if they cost five times what they actually did.""Gas,"" sadly, is Mr. Corman's latest attempt to be funny and hipCorman in a Robert Downey mask that doesn't fit. It also reminds me of the story about the four fishermen who, after spending several hours hoping that the pelican overhead would lead them to fish, realize that as they are following the pelican, the pelican is following them.Are movies like ""Gas"" and ""Brewster McCloud,"" spontaneous responses to the lunacies of the age, or are they attempts to exploit them? Without knowing it, could they possibly be following attitudes that, in turn, are following them? I'm really not sure, though I am certain that ""Gas"" is tolerable only as a movie that wants desperately to please. To turn your back on such a defenseless film requires a resolute rudeness.George Armitage's screenplay sounds very much like the work of a writer who has lowered himself into his subject while trying to hang onto heaven. The film pretends to be a Pop Odyssey that leads from Dallas to a New Mexico commune of last resort, enacted by characters with names like Coel, Cilia, Demeter and Jason. There also are encounters with Edgar Allan Poe, riding a Harley, and Billy the Kid, atop a horse named Pretentious.Mr. Armitage's comic conceits seldom make up in surprise what they always lack in originality. His lovers, Coel (Robert Corff) and Cilla (Elaine Giftos),"" display a steadfast optimism that is, indeed, funnier than the various disasters that befall them on their journey. Among other things, they are constantly being captured, once by a football team for whom the sacking of El Paso is the big game, and, later on, by a band of Hell's Angels, whose members spout the clichs of the old right-wing middle-class. There also are A.M.A. jokes (doctor to woman in labor: ""take two aspirins and call me if It gets worse"") and borrowing from other films, including the man-in-the-raincoat from ""Putney Swope.""Most apparent, however, is Mr. Corman's inability to reflect, in the images he chooses, what shouldI assumebe a comic mood. ""Gas"" sounds as if it wanted to be funny, but its style is as solemn as ""The Wild Angels,"" despite its slapstick chases, its Op art effects used as bridges between scenes, and despite its soundtrack score by Country Joe and the Fish that's not bad at all.I must say that I liked all the young performers, and at least one gagthe one about a chemical that could induce movies on the insides of the eyelids. The experiments, however, never succeeded in producing anything except 1930's musicals, and these only in mice. For the most part, the fantasy of ""Gas"" is simply heavier and less absurd than the reality it means to demolish.",1971-03-27T05:00:00+0000

Any adult who can face this British color film without succumbing to its wisdom, sweetness and marvelous mischief, all held, for once, to the viewpoint of the youngsters themselves, had better watch out.Exquisitely directed by Waris Hussein, the picture has striking color photography that crisply squints at contemporary London and an anthill depiction of a public school like a precocious child, missing nothing. This regimented, impersonal milieu, compounded by shortsightedness at home, brings together two students, a rich lad and a brash cockney. Enter now a winsome little brunette student, and if you think you know what will happen after an 11-year-old boy and girl profess eternal love, you're in for a big surprise.As the two chums, Mark Lester and Jack Wild are simply wonderful, now reteamed after their ""Oliver"" and ""Artful Dodger"" roles. Tracy Hyde, a petite newcomer, is darling in the title role, and James Cossins as the school headmaster and Sheila Steafel, Roy Kinnear and Kate Williams as parents are all excellent.Here is a picture insisting that still another generation gapa preteen oneis simmering under adult noses. No filthy and even filthier-mouthed older rebels stripping down and stalking around in murderous petulance here, praise Britannia! Like fresh manna from heaven, this is a genuine children's hour.

us,' A Severed Head',"Perhaps there is a movie waiting to be realized in Iris Murdoch's novel ""A Severed Head."" If so, it must go on waiting, for it has not been touched in Dick Clement's plodding, faithful, doggedly unimaginative screen adaptation, which opened yesterday at the Baronet Theater.""A Severed Head,"" Miss Murdoch's original play, draws heavily upon the conventional turns and expectations of urbane stage comedy  though it reworks those turns and expectations in the interest of its own semimystical conceits. But Mr. Clement has ignored the resources close at hand in favor of bringing the fiction around with its more arcane purposes acknowledged, but not its theatrical type. The result, whether by will or ineptness, seems like nothing so much as a collection of comic situations looking for a comic intention.Superficially a study in modern misalliance among the London well-to-do, ""A Severed Head"" belongs to that class of fiction in which the sum of a plot's surprises really is the substance of the work. It is all very circumstantial, but the circumstances affect some rather pleasantly civilized people. And in the figure of its dea ex machina, an inscrutable, Jewish, Cambridge don named Honor Klein, it means to introduce a source of agony and ecstasy (sexual, mostly) appropriate to a world that catches sight of its abysses only through an occasional crack in the teacup.All of this calls for something like high style. But in ""A Severed Head"" high style extends to some of the costumes and most of the locations  flats, townhouses, country houses  and nowhere else. To have elicited dull performances from Lee Remick, Claire Bloom and Jennie Linden may be an achievement, but not one that I should hope to see repeated.The men are as uninteresting, but fall short of lesser expectations, and only Richard Attenborough, because of his inflated reputation and a juicy role as the film's evil genius (a psychoanalyst, of course), seems a major disappointment.He is also a major piece of miscasting  as is Lee Remick, reduced to a cultivated British accent and a kind of flighty vacuity that may be one of of the few characterizations, fortunately, out of her range.Miss Bloom, as the mysterious East, is in a sense meant to be all presence and no performance. But the others must somehow interact. One of the charms of Iris Murdoch's novel is the articulate ease with which its people communicatetelling lies mostly, but telling them in a rush of great luminous sympathy. Under Mr. Clement's direction, however, nobody communicates, and there are lengthy scenes in which people ostensibly speak to one another, sometimes on matters of great intimacy, without ever making contact.I have rarely experienced such desolation in the midst of plenty at the movies, so little conviction, such a meager sense of good or even ill humor. It is as if the money were there for making a movie, a script written, a cast assembled, scenes blocked out, the whole thing shot and eidtedand nobody thought to ask what was going on, or why.",1971-03-29T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Taking Off':Milos Forman Directs a Charming Farce,"""Taking Off,"" the first American film by Milos Forman, the young Czechoslovak director of ""The Firemen's Ball"" and ""Loves of a Blonde,"" is about Jeannie Tyne but it gives most of its amused attention to Lynn and Larry Tyne, the parents Jeannie leaves behind in Forest Hills when she takes off for the East Village.It is not Jeannie (Linnea Heacock) who has the real adventures, but Lynn (Lynn Carlin) and Larry (Buck Henry), who find themselves at a black-tie dinner meeting of the Society for Parents of Fugitive Children (where everyone turns on with pot), who get drunk and play strip poker, who always seem to be behaving badly when Jeanniefrom time to timecomes home of her own accord.Mr. Forman's specialty is tender farce played out in what are, essentially, very bleak circumstances. The 86-year-old fire chief, who is being honored in the magnificent shambles of ""The Firemen's Ball,"" is suffering from cancer. In ""Loves of a Blonde,"" Andula, who is not only dear but so naive and romantic she appears to be almost dim-witted, falls in love with a musician who is a mama's boy and spectacularly unfaithful to everyone.When you stop to think about ""Taking Off,"" the circumstances are almost as bleak. Lynn and Larry don't seem to have a clue as to what's going on in Jeannie's mind, and although they are decent enough, the house in which they live is a kind of memorial to their humdrum sensibilities: knotty pine paneling, lace doilies on the TV set and piano, and, on the wall, one of those ""perspective"" paintings that, depending on your angle of vision, is a clipper ship, the portrait of a 19th-century lady, or a still life of a bowl of flowers. ""That,"" says a friend of theirs, ""is what I call art.""The circumstances are bleak, but the movie is not. It has as much affection for Jeannie's parents, even at their most foolish, as it has for Jeannie and the freshfaced innocentsthe acid heads, the drop-outs and would-be recording artistsshe meets in her Village wanderings.In terms of narrative and characterization, ""Taking Off,"" on which no less than four writers collaborated, including Jean-Claude Carriere (""Belle de Jour,"" ""The Milky Way""), is so slight it barely exists at all, being hardly more than a series of comic sketches.One of the joys of ""The Firemen's Ball"" was the manner in which the director constructed multilevel gags that unfolded out of each other, as when a couple were seen making love under the table from which the evening's raffle prizes were being stolen, one by one. There is nothing comparable to that comic density here; instead Mr. Forman resorts to the sort of tricky editing by which the action in a succeeding scene is made to seem a humorous comment on what's immediately preceded it, even though they are unrelated.""Taking Off"" has been so artfully constructed, however, that what I suspect to have been a certain barrenness of inspiration often looks a good deal more meaningful than it really is.One of Mr. Forman's great talents is in casting faces as well as real actors. Ths focal point of the film is Linnea Heacock's Jeannie, a girl who doesn't do very much, who hardly opens her mouth but whose eyeslarge, beautiful, and often downcastexpress quite enough.Buck Henry, who looks like a potentially dishonest bank teller, and Lynn Carlin (""Faces"") both are legitimate actors who also happen to be very funny. I'm not quite sure what it is about themperhaps an intensely serious concentration, like that of children listening to music. Of the others, I especially liked Audra Lindley, one of the S.P.F.C.'s major boosters, and David Gittler, who plays a rock musician so shy he can hardly bring himself to focus his eyes on a person rather than a thing.Then, too, thero are all those other unnamed faces in the film, the faces of the young people whom Jeannie meets in the Villagefat, round, beautiful, depressed, aggressive, vulnerable. They literally surround the film (Mr. Forman keeps cutting back to them after their sequence is over) with a solemnity that is both touching and extremely funny. ""Taking Off"" is not a major movie experience, but it isa good deal of the timea charming one.",1971-03-29T05:00:00+0000

Those for ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen"" (the movie, not the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer soundtrack album) don't say very much about the driving genius of Mr. Cocker, which remains his own, quite private concern until his stage appearances, but they serve as necessary and often entertaining intermissions between the fine, galvanizing Cocker performances.""Mad Dogs and Englishmen,"" the name Mr. Cocker gave to the group put together for this tour, is exactly what a cinema vrit concert film should be: music as recorded during lively performances, in this case in Dallas, San Francisco, Piattsburgh, N. Y.; Minneapolis and, finally, New York, at the Fillmore East.Mr. Cocker is not the spectacularly sinuous, sexually aggressive performer that Mick Jagger is. In his old undershirt, which is occasionally dressed up with a few sequins, he is hardly a sight that is immediately riveting. His equally talented No. 2 man, Leon Russell, arranger-guitarist-pianist-composer-what have you, with his long hair, 19th-century topper and white jeans with the flowers on the seat, is much more photogenic. It is, however, Mr. Cocker who provides the show, who sings most of the film's 15 numbers, with, from time to time, a little bit of help from such friends as Claudia Linnear and Mr. Russell.Mr. Cocker's style is post-Ray Charles, post-almost anybody I can think of, a gravelly voice that seems to have been pushed beyond its endurance, but that always retains reserve with which to maneuver through Mr. Russell's complex arrangements. Their rock-blues utilizing the large choir into which the children and Canina sometimes wander, are immensely elaborate without ever being fancy, principally, I suspect, because Mr. Cocker is not a fancy artist.He is simple, direct and great, as is the repertory that includes a lot of rock standards like ""Honky Tonk Woman,"" ""Space Captain,"" ""Let It Be"" and ""Give Peace a Chance."" Thus, people coming upon Mr. Cocker for the first time will not be lost.As in most films of this nature, it's difficult to tell who is responsible for what, but let me say that it was directed by Pierre Adidge, co-directed and edited by Sid Levin, with David Myers as director of photography, which includes the work of at least three cameras.The quality of the blow-up print from 16 millimeter to 35 millimeter that I saw at the Trans-Lux West (where it opened yesterday, as well as at the Trans-Lux East) was not perfect, but certainly adequate. The split-screen effects are sometimes lovely, and the sound recording seemed excellent.""Mad Dogs and Englishmen"" patronizes neither its audience nor its stars. Occasionally it lets peripheral characters make rather sober fools of themselves, such as the professorial disk jockey who tells Mr. Cocker how he could spend ""two hours in the British Museum, just looking at all that stuff they ripped off the Egyptians."" The film, however, is too good-natured, and too involved with the actual performance of a single star, to waste much time with this sort of thing, which is why it is so satisfactory, so pleasing. It is uncluttered, one of the best concert films so far.",1971-03-30T05:00:00+0000
