us,Brooklyn Gothic,"If William Jay Bolton is less well known than Louis Comfort Tiffany, it may be because his career as an American glass maker was a short one. Bolton (1816-84) was an early enthusiast of the Gothic revival. In 1843, he contributed what was probably the first figural window in the country, a representation of the Adoration of the Magi, to the family church. (His brother John may have helped on this project.) Never lacking in self-confidence -- the three letters included in THE STAINED GLASS ART OF WILLIAM JAY BOLTON, 1816-1884 (Syracuse University, $49.95) show him to have been a man of nerve as well as wit -- he immediately undertook the enormous program that would constitute his masterpiece, the 60-odd figural windows for the Church of the Holy Trinity (now St. Ann and the Holy Trinity) in Brooklyn Heights; those windows, certainly executed with the help of John, were probably completed by 1848. A more modest series of windows, for the Church of the Holy Apostles in Manhattan, was completed at about the same time. Willene B. Clark, a professor of art history at Marlboro College, gives an account of Bolton's life and work that is never less than exemplary. Leland A. Cook's photographs, most of them in black and white, are both useful and poignant, since they provide a record of the Holy Apostles windows that were destroyed in a fire in 1990.",1992-08-02T05:00:00+0000

Borg, 36 years old, has said his goal is to play a Grand Slam event next year. But his experience fell victim to the youth and power of his Russian opponent. The 25-year-old Volkov advanced to play Richey Reneberg, who beat Jeff Tarango, 6-3, 6-3. Borg put up quite a fight yesterday. Down 4-0 in the deciding set, he won a game on an ace, broke Volkov, and fought off three break opportunities by the Russian to move within a game. Later, while down, 5-3, Borg allowed Volkov three match point chances, but the Russian failed to capitalize, and the world's former No. 1 player eventually tied the set at 5-5. But Borg began to tire, and Volkov took the final game on an ace after five deuces.

Wadkins, who started the round five strokes back, parred the final 11 holes to match the best final-round, come-from-behind victory on the Tour this year. His six-under, the leading score all four days, is the highest winning score ever at the Greater Hartford Open and the second highest on tour this year. Only Tom Kite's 3-under at the U.S. Open was higher. Donnie Hammond, Nick Price and Dan Forsman finished two strokes behind Wadkins. (AP) Mochrie Takes the Bay State: Dottie Mochrie shot a two-under-par 70 yesterday to pull away from the field for a three-stroke victory in the L.P.G.A. Bay State Classic in Canton, Mass. Mochrie, the tour's leading money-winner this year, entered the final round tied for the lead with Sherri Steinhauer but took command with her steady play on the Blue Hill Country Club course while her playing partners faltered. Mochrie finished at 10-under 278 for the tournament, earning the $63,750 winner's purse. Her 1992 earnings are $243,947. Steinhauer struggled to a 74 and finished third at 282. Stephanie Farwig set a tournament record with a final-round 64 to finish second at 281. (AP) Archer Wins the Northville: George Archer captured the Northville Long Island Classic in Jericho for the third straight year by shooting a four-under-par 68 in the final round to win by two strokes. Archer had 14 birdies and three bogeys in the 54-hole event on the Meadow Brook Club and wound up with an 11-under-par 205 total. Only two other players on the Senior PGA Tour have won the same event three years in a row. Chi Chi Rodriquez won the Digital Classic from 1986-88 and Bob Charles took the Charley Pride in 1987-89. Jim Albus finished second, also shooting a final-round 68. Archer, 52, started the final round with a two-shot lead over Albus, and he never lost it. He earned $67,500 in winning his 10th Senior title. (AP) Faldo Takes Scandinavian Masters: Nick Faldo, the British Open champion, won the Scandinavian Masters in Barseback, Sweden, by three strokes after firing a three-under-par 69 in the final round for a 72-hole score of 277. Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain was among six players from five different countries tied for second. The others were Australians Robert Allenby and Peter O'Malley, Peter Baker of England, Danny Mijovic of Canada and Frank Nobilo of New Zealand. (AP) TENNIS Lendl Beats Reneberg Ivan Lendl, hampered by injuries over the past 18 months, breezed past Richey Reneberg, 6-3, 6-3, last night to win the U.S. Pro Tennis Championship at Brookline, Mass. The match at the Longwood Cricket Club lasted only 71 minutes, as Lendl, ranked No. 12 in the world, trounced the 26-year-old Reneberg, No. 78 in the rankings. The championship was Lendl's first since August 1991. (AP) AUTO RACING Goodyear Wins Marlboro 500 Scott Goodyear, who came so close to a surprise victory in the Indianapolis 500, raced to his first Indy-car victory yesterday in the Marlboro 500 at Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich. This time, Goodyear won an all-Canadian late-race battle with Paul Tracy, taking the lead for good with 19 laps to go on a spectacular restart following the fifth and final caution flag of the race. Goodyear averaged 177.625 miles an hour. Raul Boesel finished third, and Al Unser Jr., who beat Goodyear in the closest Indy 500 in history, was fourth. (AP) BOXING Chavez and Camacho: Get Set Julio Cesar Chavez and Hector Camacho assured six weeks worth of hype by defeating underdog opponents Saturday night in Las Vegas, Nev., as a prelude to a long-awaited fight between the two next month. Chavez (81-0) made the eighth succesful defense of his World Boxing Council super lightweight title by stopping Frankie Mitchell at 56 seconds of the fourth round at the Las Vegas Hilton. A right to Mitchell's already swollen left eye sent the 20-1 long shot staggering back across the ring. He bounced on the bottom rope, slid to his knees and crawled to his corner. Mitchell managed to pull himself up by the ropes before Referee Mills Lane completed the mandatory eight-count, but Lane decided Mitchell was in no condition to continue. Chavez, of Mexico, has the longest winning streak of any boxer in history from the start of a career, as well as 67 knockouts. Mitchell, of Philadelphia, fell to 29-2, with 13 knockouts. Camacho opened the main card by stopping Eddie Van Kirk at 1:03 of the fourth round of a scheduled 10-round welterweight fight. Chavez and Camacho have a long-awaited matchup scheduled for Sept. 12 at the Thomas & Mack Center. The flamboyant Camacho, who entered the ring in a firefighter's outfit, hadn't fought since winning a rematch with Greg Haugen. He improved to 41-1, with 18 knockouts. Van Kirk, a 30-1 underdog, fell to 26-8-2, with 13 knockouts. (AP)",1992-08-03T05:00:00+0000

Johnson (1901-1970) ended abruptly in 1947 when he was confined to Central Islip State Hospital on Long Island for a psychiatric disorder. Despondent and withdrawn, he never left the hospital or painted again. Although the art he left behind suggests many shifting states of mind, despondency is seldom one of them. Rather, it gives evidence of an ambitious artist energetically tackling the issues of 20th-century painting between the world wars, and arriving at a style that combined European modernism with a vernacular American content. This approach defines the work of a number of Johnson's contemporaries -- Marsden Hartley, Jacob Lawrence and Stuart Davis, among them -- but it is the way Johnson mixed and weighted those ingredients that gives his art its distinction.",1992-08-07T05:00:00+0000

There was a logjam of four players two strokes behind the leaders at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club. The defending champion, Brad Faxon, shot 70, Keith Clearwater 70, Wayne Grady of Australia one-over 73 and John Huston 71. The start of the third round was delayed 2 hours 24 minutes by heavy overnight rains that soaked the course. When starting times were redone, players were grouped in threesomes instead of twosomes and teed off on both No. 1 and No. 10. The course was whipped by high winds for the rest of the day, but the winds did not seem to bother the leaders.(AP) Rarick Ties Mochrie: Cindy Rarick, one of the Ladies Professional Golf Association's leading birdie producers, rattled in six yesterday and pulled into a tie with Dottie Mochrie for the lead after three rounds of the McCall's L.P.G.A. Classic at Stratton, Vt. Rarick, whose 10th-place finish last week is her best showing this season despite her No. 6 birdie ranking, had only one bogey for a change and finished with a 5-under-par 66 for a 54-hole total of 209. Mochrie, the tour's leading money winner seeking her second straight victory, started the day two strokes off the pace at four under, and climbed into a share of the lead despite an uneventful round. Rosie Jones, who started five strokes off the lead, had a 69 that brought her in at 210. She is tied with second-round leader Betsy King. (AP) Hill Catches Zembriski: Walt Zembriski maintained a share of the lead after two rounds of the Digital Senior Classic in Concord, Mass., but was joined by a rejuvenated Mike Hill, who rejoined the Tour after three weeks off. Zembriski, who held a one-stroke lead at Nashawtuc Country Club after the first round, shot a two-under-par 70 to move to eight-under 136. Hill, the Tour's co-player of the year in 1991, was three strokes behind Zembriski after the first day but caught him with a five-under 67. (AP)",1992-08-09T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Volcano Lover: A Romance',"At a literary festival some years ago, the critic George Steiner expressed his impatience at the arrogance of poets and novelists, most of whom, it seemed to him, believe that theirs are the only areas of literature in which a writer can be truly creative. For his part, he declared, he would happily swap any number of second-rate sonnets for one page of Claude Levi-Strauss's ""Tristes Tropiques,"" and whole shelves full of indifferent novels for a single chapter of Freud's ""Interpretation of Dreams."" His remarks aroused anger and vituperation, of course, yet many in the audience thought he had a point. That point, however, loses some of its acuity when one recalls that Mr. Steiner has committed fiction of his own -- three books of it, in fact. Would he exchange his first volume of tales, ""Anno Domini,"" for a page of his ""Language and Silence""? Perhaps he would; yet it seems that even the profoundest critics are not content merely to criticize fiction, but itch also to produce the stuff.",1992-08-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Don't Box Him In,"George Bellows is best remembered for his boxing paintings, especially ""Dempsey and Firpo"" (1924), in which a stricken Jack Dempsey is shown falling through the ropes. But Bellows, who died in 1925 at the age of 42, produced more than 600 oil paintings, as well as lithographs, drawings and magazine illustrations, in his short career. THE PAINTINGS OF GEORGE BELLOWS (Abrams, $49.50) and GEORGE BELLOWS AND URBAN AMERICA (Yale University, $45) offer a valuable reconsideration of Bellows's life and art. A member of the Ashcan School, Bellows shared with such painters as Robert Henri and John Sloan a fascination with the hurly-burly life of the New York streets. But Bellows found equal inspiration in the rugged terrain of Monhegan Island, off the coast of Maine, where he produced dozens of striking seascapes. His portraits -- whether of street children or members of his family -- are painted with quick, fluid brushstrokes that give a sense of emotional immediacy and psychological insight. Bellows was concerned with trying to establish logical underpinnings for his art, and was forever trying out new systems of composition and color. The result was that he changed his style more or less markedly every two years or so. Of the two volumes, ""The Paintings of George Bellows"" -- written by Michael Quick, a curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Jane Myers, a curator at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth; Franklin Kelly, a curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington; and Marianne Doezema, an official at the National Endowment for the Humanities -- offers the fuller examination of the artist's work, and includes 76 color plates as well. Along with Ms. Doezema's study ""George Bellows and Urban America,"" it throws new light on an artist widely considered the leading American realist of his generation.",1992-08-09T05:00:00+0000

It was Forsman's fourth PGA Tour victory, his first since 1990. The playoff began on No. 10, a 401-yard par-4 where Faxon was eliminated with a par, and continued on the adjoining 18th, also a par 4. Elkington's approach landed in deep grass at the left side of the green. His third shot moved the ball only a few feet and he was still buried in the grass. He finished with double-bogey 6. Forsman's approach landed in front of the green. He used his putter to get the ball within five feet of the pin, then sank the putt for par and the victory. It was the second consecutive year a playoff was needed at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club. Last year, Faxon defeated Chip Beck on the first extra hole. Forsman earned $180,000 of the $1 million purse. He also won one of the sponsor's cars. The paycheck lifted his earnings to $600,350, by far his best year ever. Elkington started the day tied for the lead with Mike Sullivan at 10-under. He made two birdies, at the 4th and 10th, and parred his way in for a final-round 70.",1992-08-10T05:00:00+0000

Achy Breaky","WHAT: A 136-beat-per-minute, 32-count, 22-step, four-wall line dance based on the Texas two-step and devised by Melanie Greenwood, a choreographer, to promote Billy Ray Cyrus's country single, ""Achy Breaky Heart."" It is the ""dance sensation of the 90's,"" said Thomas McFadden, a spokesman for Mercury Records. The company had the wit to commission the dance, which pushed Mr. Cyrus's album ""Some Gave All"" to cross over from the country chart to the pop chart and go triple platinum. On the pop chart, it went to No. 1 faster than any album since 1963. WHO: Thirty-year-old Billy Ray Cyrus is a former Oldsmobile salesman from Flatwoods, Ky. He has a name like a Dallas Cowboy middle linebacker, a haircut like a mall rat, a face like a soap-opera swain and a chest like a Chippendales stripper. ""Some Gave All"" includes ""Achy Breaky Heart"" -- a patriotic chest-thumper in the style of Hank Williams Jr. -- and sagas of exurban angst like ""Wher'm I Gonna Live?"" (sample lyric: ""She kept my TV/The bills she gave to me"").

Instead, the connection to nature was made even more intimate: the theaters were built into the cliff's base. Fifty thousand tons of rock were blasted away to construct the Large Festival Hall in 1960. The oldest hall, called the Summer Riding School, was once an arena where bearbaiting and horse displays were presented for the local princely households. It was literally carved out of the mountain 300 years ago: arches of cool, moist stone provided a primal backdrop to the festivities. As Salzburg begins a new era under Gerard A.

"" Nonsense. If there is anything one can safely say about Picasso, it is that he spent his whole life devouring, transforming, animating and creating ""things."" Luckily there is much more to PICASSO & THINGS (Cleveland Museum of Art/Rizzoli, $75). There is a delicious essay by Marie-Laure Bernadac, a curator at the Musee Picasso in Paris, titled ""Painting From the Guts: Food in Picasso's Writings,"" which begins with a Picasso epigraph -- ""To love things and eat them alive"" -- and observes that ""Picasso's taste for the still life seems to have involved both cannibalism and mysticism."" What is most striking when you look at the 145 stunning color reproductions, covering virtually the whole of Picasso's career, is how fluidly they move between the animate and inanimate -- how the dead are made live, the live made dead. In 1920 Picasso painted a jug topped by a saucer topped by two apples that evokes a comical curvaceous body with an open mouth; in 1939 he painted a trio of sheep skulls that seem to be laughing. And in 1972, at the end of his life, he drew a self-portrait that makes him look more dead than alive. ""The head,"" Ms. Boggs astutely observes, ""has been turned into a skull. And the skull . . . is a very poignant still life.""",1992-08-16T05:00:00+0000

The 29-year-old Steinhauer, who held at least a share of first place for two of the first three rounds, took a one-shot advantage into the final 18 holes and expanded it on the 6,317-yard St. Charles course. She birdied the first two holes, and second-place Judy Dickinson bogeyed No. 3, giving Steinhauer a four-stroke lead. Dickinson got within a stroke of the leader by the 13th hole, but Steinhauer regained a three-shot cushion by No. 15 and held on for the victory, finishing at 11-under 277. (AP) Archer Wins Senior Event: George Archer won the first Bruno's Classic in Birmingham, Ala., by one stroke. Archer shot a two-over 74 and finished at eight-under-par 208 on the 6,992-yard Greystone Golf Club courseto win $105,000. Jack Kiefer and Rocky Thompson were second. (AP) AUTO RACING Mansell Clinches Title Nigel Mansell of Britain clinched the coveted world Formula One championship yesterday, driving his Williams-Renault to a second-place finish in the Hungarian Grand Prix in Budapest. Ayrton Senna, the defending champion from Brazil, won the race, completing 77 laps around the twisting 2.466-mile circuit in his McLaren-Honda in 1 hour 46 minutes 19.216 seconds for an average speed of 107.157 miles an hour. Mansell finished 40.139 seconds behind Senna for second place. With five events remaining, the 39-year-old Mansell has 92 points. Riccardo Patrese of Italy, his closest challenger, has 40. (AP) Gant Wins Spark Plug: Harry Gant stretched his mileage to the limit to win the Champion Spark Plug 400 at Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn. The 52-year-old Gant topped off his gas tank just before the halfway point in the race, during what turned out to be the final caution period of the 200-lap race. Gant's Oldsmobile Cutlass crossed the finish line 4.94 seconds ahead of Darrell Waltrip. Davey Allison finished fifth but was still hurting from injuries received in a crash on July 19 as well as from the emotional burden of his younger brother Clifford's death in a crash on the same track last Thursday. (AP) TRACK AND FIELD World Record Broken Moses Kiptanui of Kenya set a world record in the 3,000 meters yesterday, covering the distance in 7 minutes 28.96 seconds at the Weltklasse meet in Cologne, Germany. The previous mark in the non-Olympic event was held by Said Aouita of Morocco, who ran 7:29.45 three years ago, also in Cologne. Kiptanui, the 3,000 steeplechase world champion, ran unchallenged for the last three laps, building a huge lead over two other Kenyans. Paul Bitok was second in 7:33.28, followed by Yobes Ondieki in 7:34.18. (AP) Olympian Sets Record: Lynn Jennings, a bronze medalist in the 10,000-meter run in Barcelona, won the women's division of the Falmouth Road Race in Massachusetts yesterday, breaking Joan Benoit-Samuelson's record. Jennings covered the 7.1-mile course in 36 minutes 13 seconds, eclipsing the mark of 36:17 established by Benoit-Samuelson in 1985.

CANCELS INSPECTION IN IRAQ U.N. inspectors in Baghdad canceled a visit to a military ministry considered off-limits by Iraq, abandoning for now a U.S. plan to demand access to sensitive sites. A1 IRAQI AIR ATTACKS EXPECTED A U.S. proposal to protect Shiites in southern Iraq from air attacks by Baghdad comes as intelligence reports indicate that Iraq is preparing to renew an offensive against the Shiites, the White House says. A6 Iraq's official newspapers heaped scorn on President Bush. A6 The U.S. heft in the U.N. could permit unilateral military action. A6 CAMBODIA PEACE PACT IN DOUBT Nearly a year after the U.N. brokered an accord to end Cambodia's decades of bloodshed, the settlement may collapse because of the refusal of the Khmer Rouge to disarm its soldiers. A1 WINTER WARNING ON BOSNIA A senior U.N. official warned that 200,000 to 300,000 people could die in Bosnia and Herzegovina this winter from epidemics and exposure if relief agencies did not immediately step up deliveries. A3 WRONG PORT FOR 150 ASIANS At least 150 Asians, apparently trying to reach the United States illegally, landed on the southern coast of Haiti. A3 South Africa is reeling from the political repercussions of a rugby match. A4 Buenos Aires Journal: A surgeon builds his dream clinic. A4 The Convention A7-11 G.O.P. CONVENTION BEGINS President Bush roared into Houston with a vow to revive his re-election campaign, and Ronald Reagan bestowed his blessing as an anxious Republican National Convention began a search for its old electoral magic. A1 BEDEVILED BY UNCERTAINTY News analysis: George Bush arrived in Houston with the specter of a one-term Presidency and without the politically priceless air of inevitability that so enveloped Ronald Reagan in 1984. A1 FIGHT OVER ABORTION AVERTED The Bush campaign averted a convention-floor debate on the abortion issue by appealing for an image of unity. Yet polls of delegates showed that few favored the rigid anti-abortion plank, and the Bush camp sought to place some distance between the President and the platform. A10 G.O.P. PUNCHING BAG: THE PRESS Press bashing is an honored G.O.P. tradition, but this year, Republicans from President Bush on down are mounting an unusually bitter assault. A7 A RARE STAR TURN FOR MRS. QUAYLE In 1988, Bush campaign aides tried to keep Marilyn Quayle in the background, fearing her fierce personality would overwhelm her husband's. This year they are giving her unprecedented star billing for one major reason: Hillary Clinton. A7 AH, YES, THEY REMEMBER IT WELL Nostalgia swept the Astrodome as Ronald and Nancy Reagan entered, and Republicans recalled fond memories of the 1980's: Adolfo. Ivan Boesky. Cigarettes. A7 Excerpts from the Republican Party's official platform. A10 The party chairman, Richard Bond, should have identity problems. A11 Campaign Watch: Confidence eludes G.O.P. officials on television. A9 The Clinton campaign counters G.O.P. convention publicity. A11 National A7-17 FREEDOM SEVERS PARTNERSHIP For 15 years, two murderers doing time in a Louisiana prison produced the premier publication of prison muckraking, The Angolite magazine, in the process changing countless features of prison life. Now one man is free to join his new wife, but he must leave behind his closest soulmate. A1 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN UPHELD A Federal district judge upheld an affirmative action plan for the City of Birmingham, Ala., that includes numerical hiring goals that were attacked by the Reagan and Bush Administrations. A12 PUSH TO MOVE EXPLOSIVE CASE The judge presiding over the retrial of a former Miami police officer accused in the 1989 deaths of two black men recommended that the case, which had been shifted to two other cities, be transferred again: back to the Florida capital. A15 REVIEWING U.S. ROLE IN 'IVAN' CASE A Federal appeals court ordered a special inquiry into the Justice Department investigation of John Demjanjuk, who was stripped of his citizenship and sent to Israel to stand trial as ""Ivan the Terrible.""

Although an analyst predicted that Eljer might continue to face liability claims since Liberty Mutual stopped insuring Eljer in 1988, company officials disputed that assessment. ""It's simply impossible to crystal-ball-gaze and predict how many claims will be filed in the future,"" said Tom Aldrich, a lawyer for Eljer. ""With this ruling, we believe the insurance coverage we have in place will cover all claims.""",1992-08-20T05:00:00+0000

Assailed for the erotic candor of his work (especially his renderings of women fully aware of their sexuality), discredited for his unorthodox treatment of traditional subjects and accused of being everything from a homosexual to the exploiter of his model, muse and mistress Camille Claudel -- nonetheless Rodin (1840-1917) managed to redefine the nature and purposes of sculpture. RODIN: Eros and Creativity (Prestel/Te Neues, 15 East 76th Street, New York, N.Y. 10021, $69.95) is an intriguing study of the artist's discourse on the erotic. The editors -- Rainer Crone, who teaches art history at Columbia University, and Siegfried Salzmann, director of the Kunsthalle in Bremen, Germany -- have assembled photographs of more than 50 sculptures depicting erotic themes, as well as 32 superb drawings in pencil and watercolor wash. Each sculptural piece has been exquisitely photographed in black and white from multiple angles, to highlight selective details. In an exceptionally lucid essay, the journalist and critic Ginger Danto discusses the emotional ramifications of Rodin's carnal depictions. In another, the art historian Ursula Heiderich examines the creative symbiosis between Rodin and Claudel, including its destructive aspects. Less ambitious in scope and more generic in design, RODIN AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES: The Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Collection (Cross River/Abbeville, $45) presents photographs by David Finn of 25 sculptures owned by the art collectors Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, as well as works by Rodin's contemporaries, including a selection of late 19th- and early 20th-century paintings. Each series of glossy color plates is introduced by a brief but helpful foreword, as well as biographical information about its maker, written by Marie Busco, one of the authors of ""Painting and Sculpture at Lincoln Center.""",1992-08-23T05:00:00+0000

Norman, one of 71 players stranded on the course by an electrical storm Friday afternoon, returned yesterday morning to complete second round play. Norman, who hasn't won in more than two years, scored 10 points under the modified Stableford scoring system used for this event. Medal scores do not count in the event, only point totals. Golfers earn 5 points for eagle, 2 for birdie, zero for par, minus 1 for bogey and minus 3 for double bogey or worse.","Norman rolled in a 20-foot eagle putt on the par-5 17th hole, then dropped a 3-footer for birdie on the 18th, giving him a total of 19 points for two rounds and a tie for second going into the third round. He shared the spot with Greg Whisman, who lost 1 point from the record 20 he scored in first round play. They trailed the leader, Dan Pohl, by 6 points. Pohl pushed his total to 24 Friday and finished his round before the storms disrupted play. The deficit, however, carries little meaning under the unique format used in this tournament. At this stage, players are simply attempting to stay alive through three rounds. (AP) Lopez Tied With Two Others: Nancy Lopez apparently needed some time off. After not playing the last two weeks, she shot a five-under-par 67 on Friday to share the lead with Judy Dickinson and Barb Much at the L.P.G.A. Northgate Computer Classic in Brooklyn Park, Minn. Dottie Mochrie, the leading money winner on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour, made pars on the first seven holes over the par-72 Edinburgh U.S.A. course and then played at four under the rest of the way to finish one shot behind the leaders. Mary Murphy also was one shot back in the $425,000 event. Betsy King was among seven players who were two shots back at 69. The defending champion, Cindy Rarick, shot a 2-over 74, which was better than the 75 she had in last year's opening round. Beth Daniel, who won the inaugural Northgate two years ago, was at 73. Lopez, playing for the first time in the three-year-old Northgate event, got hot on the back nine with four birdies. She is winless on the tour this year but has finished in the top 10 in eight of her last nine outings, including four second-place finishes. (AP) Crampton Finishes Strong: Even with the lead at the G.T.E. Northwest Classic in Kenmore, Wash., albeit a small one, Bruce Crampton wasn't predicting anything positive. And that was despite a birdie-birdie-eagle finish Friday, which gave him a six-under 66 and a one-stroke lead over Arnold Palmer, Miller Barber and Larry Laoretti. ""Golf is such a difficult way to make a living that you're never confident,"" said Crampton, who has won 19 tournaments on the PGA Senior Tour, including the G.T.E. Northwest Classic in 1986 and 1988. ""I've found it's better to let things happen."" Palmer was at 67, helped by his 16th career hole-in-one, along with Barber and Laoretti, the United States Senior Open champ. Tied at 68 were Don Bies, Ken Still, Rocky Thompson and John Joseph, who left his Millbrae, Calif., club job and qualified Monday for his first Senior Tour appearance. Defending champion Mike Hill was in a 10-way tie at 69 with Bert Yancey, Dick Hendrickson, Al Geiberger, Butch Baird, J. C. Snead, Bruce Devlin, Simon Hobday, J. C. Goosie and Dick Goetz.

Flutie, who joined the Stampeders this season as a free agent after playing two seasons for British Columbia, threw touchdowns passes of 28 yards to Carl Bland and 41 yards to Derrick Crawford. Flutie also rushed for 34 yards on six carriers and scored on a 1-yard run in the game played in snow flurries. Calgary improved to 5-2; British Columbia dropped to 0-7.

us,RESULTS PLUS,"AUTO RACING Second Straight for Fittipaldi Emerson Fittipaldi won an eight-lap sprint to the finish following a late-race caution period and won the Texaco-Havoline 200 in Elkhart Lake, Wis., yesterday for his second straight Indy-car victory. Fittipaldi, who led most of the race, held off Al Unser Jr. on the final laps for his 16th career Indy-car victory, including three at Elkhart Lake's Road America. Bobby Rahal, slowed by a near pit collision with Michael Andretti, took third and Andretti was fourth. Scott Goodyear went off the track in the 35th lap, forcing the next seven laps to be run under the yellow flag and creating a tight dash to the finish. Fittipaldi wouldn't budge from the lead -- fighting off two pass attempts from Unser on the first lap after the restart -- and finished the race with an average speed of 110.656 miles an hour on the four-mile road course. Fittipaldi also won at Road America in 1986 and 1988. Unser finished .775 seconds back and Rahal was 1.078 seconds behind. (AP) Nemechek Outduels Earnhardt: Joe Nemechek held off a charging Dale Earnhardt by half a car-length to capture the Busch Grand National New England Chevy Dealers 250 at New Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon. Nemechek, the Grand National points leader, overcame a sparkplug problem during the pace laps and a hard bump by Earnhardt on lap 247 to win the second race of his career. (AP) GOLF Faxon Triumphs in Colorado Brad Faxon was the first on the course and the first to realize how difficult it would be waiting out his cliff-hanging victory in the International at Castle Rock, Colo. ""Boy, that's the worst part of going off first, having to sit there and watch it,"" Faxon said yesterday after watching several challengers miss chances to catch up over the closing holes. Faxon gave them that opportunity after missing a three-putt par on the par-5 17th hole that would have given him some breathing room. As it turned out, however, the breathing room wasn't needed and Faxon scored a two-point triumph in the tournament, in which medal scores do not count. Faxon acquired 14 points under the modified Stableford scoring system that awards points for a player's score on each hole: 5 for eagle, 2 for birdie, 0 for par, minus 1 for bogey and minus 3 for double bogey or higher. Faxon, 31 years old, collected $216,000 for his second victory of the year and fourth of his career. Lee Janzen, a winner in Tucson this year, was second with 12 points. D. A. Weibring and Steve Elkington of Australia were next at 10. (AP) Joyce Rallies to Win: Mike Joyce shot a 64 in the final round of the GTE Northwest Classic at Kenmore, Wash., coming from five strokes back for his first victory on the Senior PGA Tour. Joyce, a club pro from Long Island, sizzled on the 6,455-yard Inglewood Country Club course for a bogey-free round and ended at 204. Mike Hill, the defending champion, who held a one-stroke lead through 36 holes, finished second after a 71 and 206. (AP) Tschetter Finally Wins: Kris Tschetter's eagle on the 12th hole lifted her dwindling lead at the L.P.G.A. Northgate Classic in Brooklyn Park, Minn., yesterday and sent her to her first victory in five seasons on tour. Tschetter, 27, had a one-over 73 at the Edinburgh USA course for a 54-hole total of 211, three shots ahead of Deb Richard. Betsy King and Judy Dickinson tied for third at 216.

His winning time of 13 minutes 0.93 seconds was the third-fastest ever and the best this year. Kiptanui, 21 years old, left himself too much to do on the last lap to beat the time of 12:58.39 set by Moroccan Said Aouita. Earlier this month, Kiptanui set world records in the 3,000 meters and the steeplechase. Four Olympic champion runners were beaten. Nigerian Olapade Adeniken beat 100-meter gold medalist Linford Christie for the third time since the Barcelona Olympics, clocking 10.12 seconds.

""Rio Grande,"" which describes the source and course of the nation's second longest river, goes over much of the same material; the essay is obviously dated, not only in the use of several statistics from the mid-1970's but in its failure to address the consequences of the industrial and population booms that have taken place along the river since then. The other two essays may be of special interest to fans of Mr. Hillerman's mysteries, as they are candid reminiscences on how the author locates his plots and characters in the country and cultures of the Southwest.
