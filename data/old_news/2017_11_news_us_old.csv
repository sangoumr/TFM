Makie, her tiny SoHo clothing shop, is a secret address whispered from one stylish mother to another; its signature wrapping (a brown paper box tied with colorful ribbon and neon-hued feathers) is almost as famous as Yahagis elegant, minimalist and cozy kids wear: onesies, cashmere sweaters and bibs in sophisticated, adult shades of slate, mouse gray and stone white. In 1991, at the age of 23, Yahagi left Japan for New York City, where she opened a bakery with her then-husband near Union Square. But an old issue of Vogue Bambini inspired a new direction. It had these timeless images of kids in outfits by Comme des Garcons that looked like wonderful school uniforms and papas clothes, she remembers; she set up her shop eight years later. There, hidden like little treasures among her garments, is a selection of carefully chosen housewares  paper-thin Japanese terry cloth towels, striped porcelain bowls  that she finds on her monthly trips to Paris and Tokyo, where she also maintains a larger Makie outpost. On the days she isnt traveling, youll find the 53-year-old flitting about her Thompson Street location, dressed in her signature uniform: a navy frayed-twill blazer and cropped trousers of her own design, plus a stack of gold-and-opal rings.

At the center of this action in real life was the Mutiny at Sailboat Bay, a hotel and club in the citys Coconut Grove neighborhood. Roben Farzad, whose family immigrated to the United States from Iran after he was born, grew up in Miami during those years. His new book, Hotel Scarface, is a raucous history of the cocaine boom as it played out at the Mutiny. (The 1983 movie Scarface, also set in this period in Miami, was filmed mostly in California.) All roads led back to the Mutiny, an undercover police officer who worked in Miami at the time told Farzad. The druggies, the celebs, the crooked pols, spies, the informant, cops  good and bad  were all there. Appropriately, Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, the stars of Miami Vice, also were known to drop by. (Thomas even lived there for a time.)

Any connection between this new restaurant and the spaces former tenant, Brasserie, is tenuous. Jeff Zalaznick, a co-owner, is instead calling it a Japanese brasserie. I love the name, and it reminds me of places in Japan with similar names, he said. The Lobster Club might suggest Japan to Mr. Zalaznick, but New Yorkers are more likely to remember an Upper East Side restaurant of that name from the chef Anne Rosenzweig. Now Japan prevails, with the chef, Tasuku Murakami, in the kitchen. There is lobster to be sure, seared on a teppan griddle, in a cocktail, a salad, and dumplings. But the menu is as much steakhouse as it is brasserie, with a long list of sushi and sashimi items as well. The restaurant, which cost $10 million to design and build and was done by the designer Peter Marino, who also created the colorful tableware, is as much inviting lounge as it is restaurant. Framed by a long, bright bar along one side with flooring that suggests Jackson Pollocks work, some of the midcentury Modern style furnishings upholstered in pink and chartreuse are low, conducive to drinking and snacking. Off to one side is another dining room, which can be closed for private parties, done in vibrant red and adorned with Mr. Marinos interpretations of Picasso sculptures.

Christies novel derives much of its notoriety from the solution to its mystery. Its very novel; whether its ingenious or just ostentatious is still debated by mystery lovers. But even more than 40 years after Mr. Lumets film I had presumed that the ending was so well-known that there would be little point in a remake.

Its hardly original to assert that of all the ways we experience place, sight is perhaps the least important; the thing that convinces me Im actually in Japan, for example, is never the slur of neon outside the Tokyo-bound trains windows, but the perfume of soy sauce, cooking oil and burning cedar that is particular to the country. The same is true with Delhi: You step through the airport doors, and there it is  singed rubber, wet concrete, damp loam, roasting cardamom. These days, thanks to the ongoing globalization (or democratization, depending on your perspective) of fashion and music, many cities can look, and sound, very much alike.

Its made of pure, papery crisp cotton, supple linen or the softest Italian wool. Its capacious and effortless, since anything too structured, too clingy or contrived, would be trying too hard. This woman tends to work in a creative field  shes a chef, a landscape architect, an artist, a curator, an editor  and her personal life, too, has a certain ease. She spends weekends in the garden and throws impromptu dinner parties and would rather wear a roomy dress than forgo a homemade piece of rhubarb pie. Youll never see her wearing visible logos (or even identifiable trends), but if you ask her what shes wearing, shell likely name one of a cohort of independent designers who have built a business for themselves, in some cases over decades, by quietly and consistently working outside the realm of mainstream luxury fashion. These designers dont hold runway shows on the fashion-week schedule ... if they hold them at all. They dont advertise or market themselves. Most of them avoid press entirely.

But as the Pulitzer-winning writer Richard Rhodes argues in his book Why They Kill, the popular notion that any regular person is capable of killing under the right circumstances is likely false  it takes a lot to turn someone into a killer. Even seemingly obvious exceptions dissolve under scrutiny. Pointing to a study of 27,574 muskets recovered from the battlefield at Gettysburg, Rhodes notes that nearly 90 percent of the weapons, which are muzzle-loaded and fired one round at a time, were found still loaded. Over 12,000 of them were found still packed with more than one musket ball, some with as many as ten. Its one thing to load a weapon  no one wants to look like a coward in battle.

Thats thanks largely to Braziles vantage as interim head of the Democratic National Committee, struggling to unite fractured and fractious constituents on the left. (Spoiler alert: It didnt work.) So its not surprising that she would offer her own take on what happened last fall  or that it would diverge from Clintons What Happened, which mentions Brazile only in passing and is No. 12 in its ninth week on the hardcover nonfiction list. Braziles memoir-slash-analysis, the cleverly titled Hacks, debuts at No. 6 and claims that Brazile knew all along Clinton was in trouble. The polls were unanimous in her winning, she writes, but I did not trust the polls.  I had visited states around the country and I found a lack of enthusiasm for her everywhere. Brazile says she urged Bernie Sanders to work as hard as he could to bring his supporters into the fold with Hillary, and to campaign with all the heart and hope he could muster. He might find some of her positions too centrist, and her coziness with the financial elites distasteful, but he knew and I knew that the alternative was a person who would put the very future of the country in peril.",2017-11-17T10:00:21+0000

But back in the pre-digital age, I had those black-and-white marbled composition notebooks and new New Yorker eyes (because Id just arrived from London) and I was so wired with everything I was seeing that I had a desire to write it, share it, impart it. I love reading other peoples diaries, too: Virginia Woolfs, Andy Cohens. Chips Channon was a huge inspiration to me; the Tory M.P.s diaries through the 30s and 40s where he interfaced between society and politics  its just riveting stuff.

He made his living and his initial reputation from fashion and advertising photography, which is to say portraits and still lifes, while on his own initiative he made more portraits and still lifes. He respected and followed both fine-art and vernacular traditions, taking the mottled gray backdrop of early studio photography and making it his own. He discovered a daylight studio in Cuzco, Peru, in 1948 and rented it for a week, shooting locals, and then set up daylight studios of his own in Paris, London and New York to photograph people in the generally doomed small trades (glaziers, tinkers, rag and bone men) in their get-ups and with their accouterments  a motif dating back to the mid-19th century.",2017-11-28T10:00:26+0000

Indeed, the 46-year-old has directed a wide range of fashion houses over the past decade, from his revival of the New York label Halston to the French brand Rochas and the Parisian couture house Schiaparelli. Born to a Swedish mother and an Italian father, the Milan native has an aesthetic that marries a Southern European passion for color and craftsmanship with a Scandinavian appreciation for efficiency and minimalism.

At Baar Baar, which means again and again, he dabbles in sous-vide, foams, gels and such, but they do not dominate the menu. His small plates, assorted mixed thali platters and bigger plates provide a range of flavors, including traditional (like tandoori mushrooms, Kashmiri-style lamb ribs and butter chicken) and innovative, like potato and bone-marrow kulcha, asparagus pepper fry with cauliflower mousse, and oysters with guava, chile granita with lemon foam. He makes liberal use of avocados and offers creative cocktails, some mixed with Indian spirits. When it comes to contemporary Indian food, New York is years behind, he said. The restaurants owner, Payal Sharma, is his partner, as are the owners of his San Francisco place, Rooh, which opened last February.

A block farther on, all was quiet again.
