Cloutier, a former Sabre who was traded to the Nordiques earlier this week by the Chicago Blackhawks for Tony McKegney, came up big time after time. The victory ended a streak without a victory at five games for the Nordiques, who are tied with Toronto at the bottom of the overall league standing. In that span, Quebec had just one tie. The Sabres have lost four in a row. (AP) Bruins 5, Canadiens 2: Ray Bourque broke a tie with a power-play goal early in the second period, and Cam Neely and Dave Poulin added third-period goals for Boston in the Bruins' fourth consecutive victory. Boston increased its Adams Division lead over Montreal to 5 points with its second victory over the Canadiens in a week. Andy Moog, the goalie, earned his 21st victory of the season, fourth in a row and eighth in the last nine starts with relief help from Matt DelGuidice midway through the third period. DelGuidice made his National Hockey League debut at the same time as Montreal's Frederic Chabot, who replaced Andre Racicot after Boston went ahead, 5-2. (AP) Flyers 4, Penguins 2: Ron Sutter scored twice as Philadelphia ended Pittsburgh's winning streak at four games. The Flyers, who have won five consecutive home games, have won four of five over Pittsburgh. The victory lifted the Flyers into second place in the Patrick Division, a point ahead of Pittsburgh. (AP) Blues 4, Whalers 3: Rod Brind'Amour circled the net and scored his second goal of the game from the slot with 4:05 left in overtime for St. Louis at home. It was the Blues' second overtime victory in three games and gave Coach Brian Sutter his 100th victory in his third season with St. Louis. The Blues, who have won four in a row, also beat Detroit, 5-4, in overtime on Saturday. On the game-winner, Steve Tuttle fed the puck to Brind'Amour, who skated around the net and beat Daryl Reaugh with a quick shot. Tuttle had a goal and three assists for his first points of the season.

Saudi and Qatari troops backed by American marines reportedly inflicted heavy casualties, taking 161 prisoners and destroying 42 tanks and 35 other vehicles. The allied commander, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, played down the significance of the battle, calling it ""about as significant as a mosquito on an elephant.""

A range of products is available, although there is no consensus among manufacturers and leather experts about which are best. The choice often depends on the type and quality of the leather and the degree of protection desired. As always, read and follow label directions. Problem: Traction in snow or slush Solution: Rubber soles with a rib or tread. Avoid leather soles and high heels. Problem: Traction on ice Solution: Metal ""claws"" or ""grippers"" that clip or strap onto the sole. Problem: Protecting shoes from snow, water or salt Solution: For heavy-duty boots or work shoes, many experts recommmend a beeswax paste; for dress shoes, silicone, although it darkens some leathers, or fluoropolymer sprays, usually sold as water and stain protectors. Mink oil is a natural leather conditioner that can also darken some leathers. Problem: Removing salt stains Solution: Liquid salt-stain removers or desalting products, salt neutralizers or desalters. After applying these products, experts recommend that shoes be cleaned with saddle soap, then polished. Sources: Amity Finding Company, D.& L. Leather Company, Joseph H.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Board chairman said that if the war drags on for more than three months, consumers will turn gloomy and the recession will become severe. On Friday, with a dismal unemployment report, he led the board in a unanimous vote to lower the discount rate a half-point to 6 percent, the second cut in six weeks. Banks responded by reducing their prime lending rate a half-point also, to 9 percent. Mr. Greenspan might be doing some pre-emptive rate-cutting and explaining. Politicians say he shares the blame for the recession, President Bush used his State of the Union address to press for lower interest rates, and Mr. Greenspan comes up for reappointment in August. If the economy does crash, Mr. Greenspan is in effect saying blame the war, not me. The Falling Payroll So much for the notion of a stabilizing economy. The Government said Friday that the nation's payrolls fell by 232,000 jobs and that the average workweek was a half-hour shorter in January.

Sari Nusseibeh, a leading West Bank intellectual and a member of one of Jerusalem's most prominent Palestinian clans, has been a contact for American Congressional delegations and Israeli antiwar groups alike. The 41-year-old philosopher was sentenced to six months of administrative detention on charges of, among other things, collecting intelligence for Iraq. Officials asserted that he had passed data about missile strikes to the Iraqis that could be used to improve their aim. Calls came from the right for his expulsion and from the left for a trial. Amnesty International demanded that Israel support the charges or release him. The prisoner denied the allegations, saying, ""It seems that the authorities want to benefit from the present atmosphere of dehumanizing Iraq to justify my arrest.""",1991-02-03T05:00:00+0000

But, as the city again considers economies of that magnitude for the first time since the mid-1970's, and New York State does, too, some officials are quietly asking -- and advocates outside government are questioning more vocally -- what price today's cutbacks will exact.",1991-02-03T05:00:00+0000

Still Life With Skyscrapers","Between dawn and dusk, the mood of New York City shifts constantly. The architectural photographer Nathaniel Lieberman tries to capture these changes in MANHATTAN LIGHTSCAPE (Abbeville, $55). Choosing panoramas over details, he anchors his photographs with familiar landmarks: the Empire State Building soars out of the hazy gold of the midtown skyline; a lavender twilight becomes a backdrop for the luminous clock on the Metropolitan Life Tower. There are no people in his pictures, no traffic jams. Time-lapse shots turn cars into ribbons of light. The absence of everyday elements makes the images appear weightless.

Most of them are mechanical, with a rotating flywheel, or electronic. Now, fiber-optic gyroscopes, with no moving parts, are about to be introduced. Currently in prototype stage, they are being developed by the Guidance and Control Systems Division of Litton Industries Inc. in Woodland Hills, Calif. They are small, from 1 to 3 inches in diameter, depending upon their sensitivity. Gyroscopes work on the principle of the Sagnac interferometer, which measures the interference of light waves. A single beam of near-infrared light is optically split into two beams of identical wavelength. Each beam is sent the opposite way through a tightly wound spool of fiber-optic wire. Changes in the rotation of the spool mean one beam must travel farther than the other, which causes them to interfere with each other. This can be measured by the interferometer; the larger the interference, the greater the rotational change.",1991-02-03T05:00:00+0000

Though Navratilova broke Sabatini's serve in the third set's first game, her own service was broken in the sixth and again in the eighth after she led 40-0.

Three crewmen were rescued, and the search continued for three others missing in the crash, possibly caused by mechanical failure. MOVING THE BEANS AND THE BULLETS As the number of allied troops passed 500,000 with the arrival of reinforcements from Germany, desert highways took on the look of an American expressway at rush-hour; bumper-to-bumper. The largest quick-order military deployment in history in in its last stages. CREDIBILITY GAP REVISITED The atmosphere at military briefings has turned noticeably testy as correspondents disparage the information as short on facts and at times misleading. Some veterans complain that their briefers seem even less informative than those of ""five o'clock follies"" memory in Saigon. WAR LOSSES ALLIES FORCES Troops: Two airmen were killed in a crash in Kuwait and three were missing in the crash of the B-52. This would bring the daily tally of American losses to 14 killed in action, 26 airmen missing in action and 8 confirmed as prisoners of war. The U.S. Central Command in Riyadh did not provide an overall count. A Saudi spokesman said 18 Saudi soldiers were killed in the fighting at Khafji last week, 29 were wounded and 4 were missing. A Qatari spokesman said he had no casualties to report. Aircraft: In addition to the B-52 bomber lost on its way back to base, an AH-1 Cobra with two aboard and a UH-1 helicopter carrying four crashed over Saudi Arabia. But the U.S. Central Command's briefer in Riyadh did not add them to the daily cumulative count of aircraft losses because, he said, they were believed to be ""non-combat-related."" The command said combat losses as such stood at 15 American and 7 other coalition aircraft, for a total of 22. IRAQI FORCES Troops: The number of Iraqi prisoners grew to ""some 800,"" according to the United States command. No reliable data on other or military or civilian losses were available. Aircraft: The Riyadh command's count of aircraft destroyed while parked or bunkered rose sharply to at least 99 and as many as 140, since some bunkers sheltered more than one. The number of aircraft shot down stood at 27, and 89 aircraft and crews remained sequestered in Iran.",1991-02-04T05:00:00+0000

Shells weighing a ton each hurtled toward what American commanders described as Iraqi command bunkers near the Kuwaiti coast. The command also reported thatsince the war started aerial bombing sorties averaged one a minute. A report from Baghdad said the capital and environs suffered five hours of predawn raids yesterday. Among other targets were tank formations and the lifelines of Iraqi frontline forces. THE VIEW FROM THE TOP Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of the American forces, said Saddam Hussein's will to keep fighting is not likely to be broken since he takes a ""very rudimentary tactical approach to warfare."" The Iraqi military is another story, in his view. It probably is beginning to crack, the general said, and is not ""holding up very well."" In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cautioned that uncertainties still abounded and that no quick victory was in sight. WAR LOSSES ALLIED FORCES Troops: The U.S. Central Command gave no new figures at yesterday's briefing and said the reported deaths of four marines in the a helicopter crash in Saudi Arabia remained unconfirmed. One of three airmen listed as missing after the crash of a B-52 over the weekend was found dead. This brought the number of American losses recorded to date to 15 killed in action, 25 airmen missing and 8 more confirmed as prisoners. Aircraft: A Marine Huey UH-1N helicopter with four men aboard crashed in Saudi Arabia in the 24 hours preceding today's briefing, the second helicopter loss in 24 hours. Termed ""non-battle damage,"" the crash did not add to the previous count of 22 aircraft shot down, 15 of them American. Iraq claimed its forces downed nine more aircraft. IRAQI FORCES Troops: Iraq issued no report, and aside from some anecdotal evidence, no meaningful figures on military or civilian casualties were otherwise available.

Mr. Bush sounded doubtful that air power alone could achieve his war objectives and the visit might take him nearer to a decision on when, or whether, to order an American ground offensive. IRAQ'S ELITE FORCE REMAINS JUST THAT Pentagon analysts believe that three weeks of the most powerful bombardments ever have barely dented the potency of the crack Republican Guard and tank divisions lying in wait along the Iraqi-Kuwait border. A ""strategic reserve,"" they are sheltered in well-protected shelters, sustained by underground supply lines and widely dispersed depots that could last them for up to six months. MISERY FOR THE IRAQIS The people of Iraq, suffering a cold winter of bombs and scarce food, water or electricity, were hit even harder when Baghdad said it was halting the supply of fuel until further notice. The sudden decree gave the people no chance to stock up on heating oil or gasoline. Most of Iraq's refineries are reportedly bombed-out wrecks. WAR LOSSES ALLIED FORCES Troops: The Pentagon said the toll among American forces stood at 12 killed in action, 11 wounded, 24 missing and 8 confirmed prisoners of war. Aircraft: According to the Pentagon, 15 American and 7 allied aircraft were shot down by the Iraqis. That does not count aircraft otherwise lost on war-related missions, like the B-52 and two helicopters that crashed over the weekend with at least some of their crew members killed. IRAQI FORCES Troops: Twenty-five Iraqi soldiers surrendered, having hidden in the battered Saudi town of Khafji since last week's fighting. With them, American commanders counted 842 prisoners in all, including 49 officers. Baghdad said 428 civilians had been killed so far. Aircraft:At least 10 more aircraft reportedly fled to Iran, bringing the number of warplanes and crews sequestered there to about 110. In addition, the Pentagon tallied 28 aircraft lost in combat and 31 on the ground.",1991-02-06T05:00:00+0000

Chang lost, 6-1, 7-5, to Carl-Uwe Steeb in 83 minutes last night a first-round match of the Milan Indoor tournament and admittedly started the year badly. Chang, who lost in the first round of the Italian Open last year, was overwhelmed by the unseeded German player in the first set, spoiled chances of a rally in the second. Steeb, 23 years old, has recovered from a foot surgery that sidelined him for several weeks late last year. He broke Chang's serve three times in the first set, then overcame 2-4 and 4-5 deficits to win the second, capitalizing on unforced errors by Chang to win the last three games. In other first-round action, Anders Jarryd of Sweden breezed past Roberto Raffa of Italy, 6-0, 6-1. The Soviet players, Aleksandr Volkov and Andrei Chesnokov, also earned second-round berths, defeating Cedric Pioline of France and Sebastian Soresini of Italy, respectively.(AP) Gomez Holds Off Devening: Second-seeded Andres Gomez of Ecuador fought off a first-round upset bid in the Volvo-San Francisco tennis tournament yesterday and beat 371st-ranked Brian Devening of Bradenton, Fla., 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. ""I can't remember how long it has been since I won a first-round match,"" said Gomez, the world's No. 6 ranked player. Gomez said the near upset was part of the price he is paying for having taken two and a half months off after a disappointing second half this season. Earlier in the season, he won the French Open, his first Grand Slam title. Also advancing to the second round were Kevin Curren, David Pate, Mark Kratzmann of Australia and Guillaume Raoux of France.(AP) N.H.L. Robitaille Lifts Kings Over Flyers Luc Robitaille's 30th goal of the season snapped a third-period tie and lifted the Los Angeles Kings past the Flyers, 3-2, last night in Philadelphia. Robitaille took a pass from the defenseman Bob Halkidis and beat Ron Hextall to the far side with a slap shot from the right circle at 7:53. It was Robitaille's 21st goal in his last 30 games. Wayne Gretzky, playing in his 900th league game, was held pointless for only the fifth time in 53 games this season. (AP) Bruins 6, Oilers 5: Ken Hodge completed the first hat trick of his N.H.L. career by scoring with eight seconds remaining in overtime to lift Boston at home. Petr Klima scored three goals for the second time in four games for the Oilers and Craig Simpson had the other two goals for Edmonton, which led by 4-1 early in the second period before Hodge led Boston's comeback. (AP) Capitals 5, Canucks 3: Dino Ciccarelli scored his 400th career goal early in the third period to ignite a four-goal rally that lifted Washington past Vancouver at home. The loss extended the Canucks' streak without a victory to seven games. Ciccarelli, Al Iafrate and Dale Hunter scored in an 8:27 span as Washington overcame a 3-1 deficit.

Lieut. Gen. Thomas Kelly, the Pentagon operations chief, said in Washington that ""there has been damage done"" to the Guards, but declined to say how much. ""We would like to see more damage,"" he added, ""which is why we're continuing with the bombing campaign."" IRAQ DESCRIBES CIVILIAN CASUALTIES Iraq said about 150 people, including 35 children, were killed by an allied air raid on the southern city of Nasiriya. The Government also asserted that its artillery killed 40 allied soldiers. The report of the deaths in Nasiriya overnight was by the far the highest casualty toll asserted by Iraq in a single attack since the Persian Gulf war began on Jan. 17. WAR LOSSES ALLIED FORCES Troops: The Pentagon said there were no American fatalities yesterday, leaving the toll among American forces at 12 killed in action, 11 wounded, 24 missing and 8 confirmed prisoners of war. Aircraft: There were no further allied losses yesterday, the Pentagon said. Fifteen American and 7 allied aircraft have been shot down by the Iraqis so far. Those figures do not include aircraft otherwise lost on war-related missions. IRAQI FORCES Troops: Seventeen Iraqi soldiers surrendered to American units, 6 to the Marines and 11 to the Army, raising the total of prisoners of war to more than 850. Aircraft: At least 4 Iraqi fighters tried to flee to Iran, and at least 2 were shot down by American fighters in pursuit. The other 2 planes may also have been destroyed; those losses would bring the overall count in air-to-air fighting to 33 enemy planes lost, against zero for the allies. An Iraqi helicopter was also destroyed over Kuwait. A military spokesman revised the numbers of Iraqi planes taking refuge in Iran, saying 20 fled on Tuesday, not 10, and that the total now stands at 120, not 110, comprised of 95 fighters and 25 transports.",1991-02-07T05:00:00+0000

Flames End Bruins' Streak Brian MacLellan and Sergei Makarov scored less than two minutes apart late in the first period and the Calgary Flames ended Boston's home winning streak at seven games last night with a 4-1 victory over the Bruins. In their third victory in the last four starts, the Flames dominated Boston, the Adams Division leader, outshooting the Bruins by 24-9 in the first two periods and by 31-18 in the game. Tim Hunter gave Calgary a 3-0 lead late in the second period before Graeme Townshend spoiled the shutout bid by the goalie, Mike Vernon, with his second goal of the season in the third period. (AP) Canucks 2, Flyers 1: Troy Gamble turned away 36 shots as Vancouver beat Philadelphia, giving the Canucks only their third victory in 20 games. The loss was the Flyers' third in a row. The Canucks are 3-15-2 in their last 20 games. Vancouver scored first when Trevor Linden's wrist shot from the right face-off circle eluded the Philadelphia goaltender, Ron Hextall, at 6:51 of the opening period at Philadelphia. Linden leads the Canucks in points (44) and goals (24). Dan Quinn made the score 2-0 when he scored his 10th goal of the season on the power play in the final period. Quinn slipped a rebound past Hextall at 9:55. The Flyers scored at 14:33 of the third period. Norm Lacombe took a pass alone in the slot and beat Gamble for his eighth goal of the season. (AP) Canadiens 5, Nordiques 1: Guy Carbonneau set up second-period goals by Mike McPhee and Russ Courtnall as Montreal broke a tie and went on to beat the Nordiques at Quebec. Andrew Cassels, Shayne Corson and Denis Savard had the other goals for the Canadiens. The only Nordique to beat the Canadiens' goaltender, Jean-Claude Bergeron, was the Soviet defenseman, Aleksei Gusarov, Quebec's eighth pick in the 1988 draft. Gusarov got his first National Hockey League goal, tying the score 1-1 in the first period. (AP) North Stars 4, Maple Leafs 2: In Bloomington, Minn., Brian Bellows had his fourth two-goal game in the last three and a half weeks, putting him within 1 of 300 career goals, as Minnesota took a major step toward making the N.H.L. playoffs by beating Toronto.

us,BUSINESS DIARY/February 3-8,"THE ECONOMY Help From Washington for America's Humbled Banks Laws passed decades ago to restrict the big American banks might now be rewritten to help save them. What a change in the bankers' image: from heartless oppressors, vilified in American literature and film, to bumbling spendthrifts and lenders to hopeless causes. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady presented a plan on Tuesday for the first overhaul of the banking system since the Depression. While the laws have remained fixed, the banking world has changed. Foreign banks, once cowed by their American rivals, now account for 29 of the 30 largest in the world. Markets as small as a city or state, once dependable, now are too limited and volatile for consistent profits. Restrictions on underwriting securities and a ban on bank ownership by other industries, once essential limits on banks' influence and risk, now are accelerating their decline. Congressional opposition to several features of the plan is inevitable. Many lawmakers come from states that have restricted the ability of banks to branch out even across county lines. But as Federal officials scramble to bail out the bank insurance fund and loosen bank credit, they recognize that the financing of the nation's businesses and consumers is at stake. Stripping the F.D.I.C. of Power If you can't hit the soldier, shoot at his horse: the Administration's proposed banking laws would strip L. William Seidman's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of its regulatory powers. The plan would split the F.D.I.C.'s authority over banks between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, leaving Mr. Seidman to meekly watch over his dwindling bank insurance fund. Fast as a House Budget Committee microphone could be switched on, he was ready to denounce the plan as ""an invitation to regulatory civil war."" In a skirmish last year, the Bush Administration tried to topple Mr. Seidman from his post; his term runs until October. An Optimistic Budget The din of war and the plaints of recession echo only faintly through the 1992 Bush budget. The $1.45 billion budget he submitted to Congress on Monday counts on an end to the recession by mid-year and allied aid so generous that the Persian Gulf war will cost the nation only $12.8 billion. Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the Administration will probably have to ask for more war money in a few months. The President, painted by the Democrats as the protector of the undeserving rich, hopes to maneuver them into defending some breaks for the wealthy. He wants to limit subsidies to the rich for agriculture, Medicare, school lunches and student aid -- programs dear to many Democratic politicians. Productivity Gains - at a Cost If American factories have truly become more efficient, why all the dismal, shuttered Youngstowns and Flints? The Commerce Department said last week that manufacturing productivity climbed at a record 3.6 percent annual rate in the 1980's, matching trading partners' gains. A service economy it may be, but as productivity among white-collar workers stagnates, manufacturing accounts for an increasing, 23.3 percent share of the nation's output. But the decade's improvements in plant efficiency have come with the loss of two million jobs. Industries like textiles have reversed their fortunes by automating, but far lower employment is the result. Nobody would comfort a small, failing farmer by saying that the success of the vast, mechanized spread next-door was all for the good. Manufacturing productivity likewise comes at a cost. California Runs Dry You farm where there's no rain from April through November, build cities hundreds of miles from the needed water supplies, and sooner or later you're going to run dry. After five years of drought, California's state water project has cut off supplies to Central Valley farmers. Rationing is already the rule in southern California. Several economists estimate that losses to the state's farmers, food processors and factories that depend on inexpensive water will reach $3 billion. This in the nation's most populous and agriculturally productive state. A Whole New Computer Game A powerful group of companies aims to redesign the personal computer from the chip up.

When Mr. Mosher moved to the Lincoln Center Theater in New York, he brought the play with him, and eventually the theater decided to mount it. Dr. Gates and George Houston Bass, the literary executor of the Hughes estate, edited the play and served as consultants to the production. ""Mule Bone"" is being published this month to coincide with its world premiere Thursday at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Broadway. Dr. Gates, the John Spencer Bassett Professor of English at Duke University, was elected to the board of Lincoln Center Theater last spring.",1991-02-10T05:00:00+0000

With shortages acute, Iraqis heard President Saddam Hussein urge them last night to be patient and steadfast and victory would be theirs. KNOTS IN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND Its instant communications a shambles, Iraq's central command spends a full day to get word to the front lines via ""pretty primitive"" - but relatively safe - backup networks, American intelligence officers in Saudi Arabia said. They said quicker but less secure lines were monitored by eavesdropping planes and spy satellites. ""Once the land battle starts,"" one officer commented, ""that won't be nearly good enough."" 'STILL A LOT OF POTENTIAL' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, en route from the gulf to report to President Bush, seems to agree with field commanders that three or four more weeks of air attacks are needed before Mr. Bush can order an ""AirLand Battle"" to begin. ""I think,"" he said, referring to Iraq's ability to resist a ground assault, ""there is still a lot of potential out there."" WAR LOSSES ALLIED FORCES Troops: The United States Central Command in Riyadh gave no new tallies. Aircraft: The briefer in Riyadh reported the loss of a Marine Harrier jump jet over Kuwait and said the pilot was missing. This increased the number of American aircraft shot down to 18. The coalition partners have lost 7, for a total of 25. The officially acknowledged losses do not include aircraft crashes on support missions, on training flights or in other ""noncombat"" incidents. IRAQI FORCES Troops: Forty-two more Iraqi soldiers were reported to have crossed lines, pushing the total of war prisoners toward 1,000.

But it was the Huskies' defense that stole the victory.

""I told the guys before the game that when you play a team of high intensity like Georgetown you've got to match their intensity,"" said the Connecticut coach, Jim Calhoun.

He made chords transparent in one chorus, opaque in the next; he put a canopy of harmony above one solo, smoothly undergirded another and gently prodded a third. His comping transformed hard-bop pieces in conventional theme-solos-theme form into suites of emotions, from suavity to torment to triumph.",1991-02-17T05:00:00+0000

A senior allied commander said a laser-guided bomb had strayed from its target and hit the crowded market. Two American fighter-bombers, attacking entrenched positions of Iraq's Republican Guard, were shot down by surface-to-air missiles. BUSH'S COMMENTS ON HUSSEIN President Bush's call for the Iraqi military to overthrow Saddam Hussein reflects the extent to which Mr. Hussein's downfall is a key consideration in the Administration's Persian Gulf strategy. Mr. Bush was prompted to issue the call after watching televised scenes of jubilation in Baghdad at the possibility of peace, concluding that the Iraqi people were ripe for such an appeal. War Losses Allied Forces Troops: Yesterday, one airman died in a non-combat mission and two were reported missing in Kuwait. No new totals were released yesterday by the U.S. Central Command, but the latest previous toll of American was 62, including 14 killed, 12 wounded, 28 missing and eight confirmed prisoners of war. Aircraft: Two American A-10 aircraft were shot down yesterday, the U.S. Central command in Riyadh reported. At the same time, the command declared that an EF-111 lost several days ago was a noncombat-related loss, even though it was returning from a combat mission. In addition, the command said an F-16C crashed during an instrument approach in Saudi Arabia. Such ""non-combat"" losses are not included in the daily tally of combat losses, which yesterday's briefer placed at 29 coalition aircraft, 20 of them American. Iraqi Forces Troops: The American briefer put the number of P.O.W.'s at around 1,300. Aircraft: The briefer also reported that an Iraqi helicopter was shot down, bringing to 42 the number of enemy aircraft brought down in air-to-air combat -- 36 fixed-wing craft and six helicopters.

Conventional transistors require currents many times more massive before they will turn on or off to create the binary messages of computing. The new device is constructed like a four-layer sandwich of gallium arsenide, aluminum arsenide and gallium arsenide, topped off with a metallic layer that serves as a conductor. The gallium layers contain impurities, or ""dope,"" that provide a source of electrons. At present, the transistor works only at temperatures approaching absolute zero, but the researchers say that problem can be solved.

Shoulders seemed the same as usual -- slightly padded but not extreme. And hemlines, while meandering slowly downward, were not dropping with a thunderous bang. But every top designer's collection had waistlines that were snugly nipped or cinched. Clothes that pulled in at the waist and then shaped out over the hip area gave the silhouette a new look.

Androgynous self-portraits and psycho-erotic paintings were characteristic of his early work, but his later pieces have grown progressively more contemplative, writes Raymond Foye in FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: Three Worlds (Rizzoli, $45). The beautifully designed book has been divided into three sections, to correspond to the three cities in which Mr. Clemente works -- Rome, Madras and New York. The Italian designer Ettore Sottsass discusses Mr. Clemente's ability to illustrate such ""uncertain states"" as memory, nostalgia, complexes and desires. Ann Percy, curator of drawings at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, supplies some biographical information about Mr. Clemente's early years in Naples, where he was born in 1952, and then discusses Arte Povera, the conceptual movement in Rome against which the artist rebelled, choosing instead to return to traditional materials as well as to the human figure. Mr. Foye, an editor and publisher of books about artists, follows with an extensive essay about Clemente in Madras, arguing that the true subject of Clemente's work is ""consciousness itself."" He also discusses Mr. Clemente's early years in New York, his collaborations with the Beat poets Gregory Corso, Allen Ginsberg and John Wieners, and the artist's working process.",1991-02-17T05:00:00+0000

But last Wednesday she accompanied some 100 police officers and Federal agents to Brooklyn in a joint operation against two crack gangs that had been distributing to dealers throughout the borough. The raids capped seven months of undercover work by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the housing police. The joint operation, law-enforcement officials said, was a new tactic against well-armed and deeply entrenched drug distribution systems in the projects that have outmaneuvered the police. Ms. Blackburne, who was named to her post last September, announced that she was establishing a special telephone line to encourage the half-million residents who live in these communities to report drug-dealing activity anonymously. She also announced her intention to rid the buildings of guns. ""I want those guns out of circulation,"" Ms. Blackburne said.",1991-02-17T05:00:00+0000

Navratilova dominated the 58-minute match with a variety of shots that had Garrison running all over the court, sometimes going in the wrong direction. In the first set, Navratilova broke Garrison in the opening game. Then Garrison forced the second game to deuce twice before Navratilova held service. Playing close to the net when not serving and using drop and passing shots to her full advantage, Navratilova also scored service breaks in the fifth and seventh games. In the final set, Garrison forced the first and third games to deuce before Navratilova held serve both times for a 2-1 lead. Garrison lost service in the fourth game, but she broke back in the next game, cutting the deficit to 3-2. Navratilova, however, broke Garrison's serve in the sixth game for a 4-2 lead. Navratilova was forced to deuce in the seventh game before holding serve. Then a service break on a drop shot in the eighth game gave her the match. Coming off double-knee surgery last fall and revamping her game since then, Navratilova improved her record to 30-1 against Garrison. (AP) Forget Triumphs: Guy Forget of France beat Andrei Cherkasov of the Soviet Union, 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 7-6, to win the Donnay Indoor tournament in Brussels. Forget played sharp, attacking tennis from the start en route to winning his second title of the year. Cherkasov was bothered early by Forget's booming serves, but fought back with steady baseline play to give Forget a strong run. (AP) N.B.A. Celtics 126, Nuggets 108: Larry Bird scored 17 of his 24 points in the first period, sparking visiting Boston to its seventh consecutive victory. The Celtics took command with only two minutes gone in the game and breezed to a 36-23 lead after one quarter. Although using their reserves for most of the second half, the Celtics shot 52.7 percent in handing Denver its fifth straight loss.

Twardokens paced the first run of the women's slalom, finishing 34-hundredths of a second ahead of Heidi Voelker, as heavy snowfall and slippery conditions knocked eight of the top 15 seeded skiers from the race. Twardokens, 25, of Santa Cruz, Calif., finished in 51.18 seconds. Voelker, of Pittsfield, Mass., was clocked in 51.52 and Wendy Fisher of Incline Village, Nev., ranked a distant third in 52.79.

The film itself, which spans the same wild extremes that Warhol's life did, offers strong evidence to the contrary. It bears out the thought that Warhol, described by one of Mr. Workman's many interviewees as ""this crazy peasant who somehow is the eye of the storm,"" was indeed a person about whom others -- and he himself, in ""The Andy Warhol Diaries"" -- could speak volumes.",1991-02-22T05:00:00+0000

It was the fourth victory of the season for the Trail Blazers over the Nuggets, giving Portland its first series sweep ever over Denver, which was playing at home. Clyde Drexler had 19 points and 8 assists for the Trail Blazers, who ended a three-game road losing streak and improved their record to 43-10. The Pacific Division leaders made only 43 percent of their 107 shots, but their defense kept Denver at bay. (AP) Lakers 106, Mavericks 92: In Dallas, Magic Johnson had 21 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds for Los Angeles. It was Johnson's ninth triple-double this season and 132d of his career. He had 18 points, 10 rebounds and 17 assists against Houston on Tuesday night. Los Angeles held Dallas to a club-record low for a half in building a 52-29 halftime lead. Dallas's previous low for a half was 31 points against Houston in 1981. (AP) Rockets 92, Bucks 90: Milwaukee's three-game winning streak ended as Otis Thorpe had 28 points and 19 rebounds, and Vernon Maxwell scored the game-winning basket with 40 seconds to play in Houston. (AP) N.H.L. Penguins' Barrage Finishes Leafs Mario Lemieux scored one goal and assisted on two others as the Pittsburgh Penguins scored six times in just over seven minutes of the second period last night and beat the Toronto Maple Leafs, 11-4, in Pittsburgh. The Penguins overcame a 3-0 deficit after 30 minutes for their ninth consecutive home victory, tying the team record set from Feb. 26 to April 5, 1975. The Penguins also scored four goals in 2 minutes 41 seconds of the third period. Lemieux had three assists over all for his second consecutive 4-point game. (AP) COLLEGE BASKETBALL Iowa Shocks Indiana in Overtime Iowa rallied from a 16-point deficit in the second half and beat Indiana, 80-79, in overtime last night in Bloomington, Ind., on a tip-in by James Moses at the buzzer. Indiana (22-4 over all, 10-3 in the Big Ten), which missed six straight free throws that could have won the game in regulation time, took a 77-74 lead on two free throws by Matt Nover and three straight by Calbert Cheaney with two minutes left in the overtime. After a timeout called by Iowa (18-7, 7-7) with 8 seconds to go in overtime, Acie Earl missed one shot and Chris Street missed another on the rebound before Moses' winning tip. (AP) Nevada-Las Vegas 80, Pacific 59: The Runnin' Rebels, playing at home, recorded their 35th straight victory over two seasons, getting 26 points and 11 rebounds from Larry Johnson. Johnson hit 14 of 15 free throws as U.N.L.V. used its inside game to pull away from the Tigers in the second half and remain unbeaten (24-0 over all, 15-0 in the Big West). U.N.L.V., moving within three victories of an undefeated regular season, appeared lethargic and mistake-prone at times, but was never seriously threatened. The point total was the second lowest of the season for U.N.L.V., which came into the contest averaging 104.2 points a game. Pacific dropped to 12-1 and 8-7. (AP) Arizona 100, California 63: In Tucson, Khalid Reeves hit five of Arizona's nine 3-pointers, and the Wildcats' balanced scoring smothered California as Arizona tightened its Pacific-10 Conference lead. Reeves, a reserve freshman guard, and Brian Williams each had 19 points while Matt Muehlebach and Ed Stokes scored 13 apiece as Arizona (21-5, 10-3) made the Golden Bears (11-13, 7-8) their 60th consecutive victim at McKale Center, the nation's longest current home winning streak. (AP) Utah 67, Colorado St. 56: Josh Grant made five of six free throws in the closing minutes and Utah held off Colorado State for the Western Athletic Conference victory in Fort Collins, Colo. The Utes (25-2, 14-1) led by 56-53 when Colorado State's Tracy Jordan missed two free throws with about four minutes left. Utah scored the next 6 points, including the only 4 points of the game by Phil Dixon. Grant, who led Utah with 19 points, made five free throws to put the game away for the W.A.C. champions. Colorado State fell to 13-12 and 4-9.(AP) Temple 80, Massachusetts 70: Playing without Mark Macon for the first time in 120 games, Temple got 20 points from Donald Hodge and beat Massachusetts in Amherst for the Atlantic 10 victory. The triumph was the Owls' 20th without a loss against the Minutemen. Macon, a guard, sprained his right ankle earlier in the week and is expected to be out at least one more game. The Minutemen (16-9, 9-7) cut a 13-point Temple lead to 39-37 at halftime, then led by 41-39 after 1:11 of the second half on a Tony Barbee jumper. Temple (19-7, 12-4) broke the game open with an 11-2 run six minutes into the second half.(AP) Duquesne 88, Rutgers 80: In Pittsburgh, James Hargrove scored 21 points and four teammates also scored in double figures as Duquesne ended Rutgers's streak of nine Atlantic 10 victories. Tony Petrarca added 17 points, including four 3-pointers for Duquesne (12-13, 9-7). Rutgers fell to 17-8 and 12-4.

us,WAR SUMMARY,"BRACING FOR A VAST LAND BATTLE Artillery and ground clashes along the Saudi border grew larger and more heated. In the heaviest allied artillery bombardment to date, a British armored division hammered Iraqi border positions and American artillery and helicopters also pounded enemy fortifications. Iraq fired three Scud missiles into Saudi Arabia, but the rare daylight attack caused no damage. American planes bombed Baghdad even as Baghdad radio played a tap of President Saddam Hussein's speech vowing to continue fighting. WAR LOSSES ALLIED FORCES Troops: Two American pilots were killed in the crash of an Army OH-58 Scout helicopter returning from a reconnaissance mission along the border, bringing to 19 the number of American combat fatalities, Central Command said. In addition, seven American soldiers were reported killed when an Army medical evacuation helicopter, a UH-60 Balckhawk, crashed in Saudi Arabia, apparently while trying to land in bad weather. If their deaths are classified as non-combat fatalities, the number would rise to 40. Aricraft: The crash of the OH-58 Scout helicopter brought the total number of American aircraft reported lost in combat to 23. The other allies have reported nine aircraft lost. Two aircraft were reported sustained an engine failure while conducting refueling operations and a U.S. Marine CH-46 helicopter that made a controlled emergency landing but could not be repaired. Thus, the number of aircraft lost in non-combat accidents since the air war began rose to 18, the Pentagon said. IRAQI FORCES Troops: A final prisoner of war count resulting from bunker attacks Wednesday was revised to 421, 20 of them officers, including the battalion commander and his staff. Fourteen more Iraqis surrendered at the site yesterday and seven surrendered in a small ground skirmish. Armor and weaponry: A ranking United States commander said that 2,100 of Iraq's 4,200 main battle tanks have been destroyed, up from 1,400 reported a week ago. Five anti-aircraft guns, five radar dishes and seven vehicles were reported destroyed in four American helicopter raids on Iraqi border posts.",1991-02-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Guidepost; Pillow Talk,"Over the years pillows become lumpy and lose their resilience. And they collect dust, dirt and perspiration that can discolor them. For these reasons, the Feather and Down Association, a trade industry group, and the Better Sleep Council, which represents bedding manufacturers, recommend that pillows be replaced every 3 to 10 years, depending on the filling and its condition. If you sleep on your side, a firm pillow will give your head extra support. If you sleep on your back, a medium-firm pillow will cradle your head. And if you sleep on your stomach, a soft pillow will ease the strain on your neck. To judge firmness, press down on the center of the pillow. Squeeze and scrunch it; the pillow should be springy and free of lumps. Here are some tips on three kinds of fillings. Polyester fiber: The most popular. They vary widely in price and feel, from very soft to very firm. They are nonallergenic, and some are treated to inhibit bacteria and mildew growth. Down and feather: They have a luxurious ""give"" and durability. Down is the most expensive and softest, though some grades of down are softer than others. Goose down, the softest, is more expensive than duck down. Over the years down tends to flatten out. Dry cleaning will refluff a pillow; new down can also be added. Those with allergies should beware of down and feathers. Those who prefer a firm pillow should try a mixture of down and feather. Foam: Foam pillows tend to be firm and buoyant. They cannot be fluffed, but they hold their shape for years, until the foam starts to crumble. Polyurethane foam is the least expensive; latex, the most.

It was the sixth time in nine games that Wilkins had scored 30 or more points.

From there, each two-man team selects its best ball and plays it for the remainder of the hole, alternating shots.

Using deadly passing shots, he broke Ivanisevic at love to take the first set. Ivanisevic saved a match point in the 10th game of the second set and had two serves at 6-6 in the tie breaker. But he made two errors at the net and Forget clinched the match.

The Way Chile Was","When Chileans voted against Gen. Augusto Pinochet in the 1988 plebiscite on which he bet his presidency, the gray land that he had spent 15 years creating suddenly went Technicolor. Exiles flocked home, politics came alive and passions that had been consigned to old songs and private conversation spilled again into the streets. And from old boxes and behind shelves, Chilean photographers pulled out negatives that through years of poverty and censorship had mostly gone unprinted. With the American photojournalist Susan Meiselas, 16 of them have now assembled many of those images in an extraordinary visual memoir, CHILE: From Within (Norton, $39.95). The book is most striking for what it leaves out. General Pinochet -- who once boasted that not a leaf moved in Chile without his knowledge -- appears only twice. Instead of the street violence that he made a news agency staple, the photographers offer images such as that of a dwarf in a business suit, crossing a promenade that riot police have just swept of demonstrators, or a park after curfew, its inviting benches filled only by an eerie mist. Though the photographs are uneven in their power, almost none of them reveal themselves on first glance. But even before the photographs give way to a selection of writings by the Chilean novelist Ariel Dorfman, the book manages to explain much about how a people coddled for so long by democracy were able to endure General Pinochet's dictatorship and then so patiently take back their freedom.",1991-02-24T05:00:00+0000

We were reminded of this last autumn in Berlin when we tried to find an adapter for the adapter plug. Shopkeepers were familiar with the problem but could offer no solution. Eventually, we fashioned an extension of the prongs themselves by disassembling a German multiple plug adapter and using its prongs to extend those on our adapter plug, a serviceable if somewhat risky solution.

us,Business Diary/February 17-22,"THE ECONOMY Gasoline Prices on the Downswing, but for How Long? Gasoline and crude oil prices have fallen to their lowest levels since shortly before Iraq marched into Kuwait. An American Automobile Association survey released last week said that gasoline had declined to $1.135 a gallon, about the same price as before the war but for a 5-cent-a-gallon Federal tax increase. Oil, driven down by peace proposals, closed on Friday at $17.91 a barrel, less than half its October peak. But don't start celebrating just yet. Even some of those analysts who expect crude oil to stay low expect gasoline costs to rise. Iraqi and Kuwaiti refineries have been ruined in the war; the Iraqis were apparently torching Kuwaiti facilities at the end of the week. Even the Saudis have to import fuel to supply the military, and gasoline demand will rise more rapidly once the American economy revives. ""There will be ample crude for refiners, but not adequate refining capacity for consumers,"" said Alfred O. Munk, a consultant and the former foreign affairs manager for the Amoco Corporation. ""Crude,"" he pointed out, ""is not what you consume."" The Inflation Numbers Game A recession that was supposed to extinguish inflation has still left the pilot light burning. Consumer prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent in January, eight-tenths without food and energy. Economists, who can no more take a figure at face value than Ella Fitzgerald can leave a melody unadorned, went to work explaining away the news. Look at higher liquor taxes, increased auto costs, rising apparel prices, other one-time events, they said. But a few saw underlying pressures, especially the 6 percent annual-rate increase in service costs, which account for about half of the inflation index. In dousing inflation, said William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, ""a short, shallow recession isn't going to give you much benefit."" Greenspan Confused? Let nobody out-worry Alan Greenspan about the Persian Gulf war and the credit crunch. In addressing two Congressional committees last week, he rehearsed his forecast of a mild recession, but then added more fine print than your typical car-rental agreement. Some of those clauses concerned the war, but most troubling, he said, was the Fed's inability to prompt banks to resume lending to their creditworthy customers. If Mr. Greenspan usually appears as a determined general unwilling to reveal his battle plans, last week he all but confessed to confusion. He seemed uncertain about whether to maintain or lower interest rates, adding that others at the Fed are divided. Some of his colleagues counsel patience, anticipating a rebound; others have a darker outlook than his. Here Comes Unicode The United Nations' near-unanimity on Kuwait was unusual, but the computer industry's agreement to use a common digital code is truly extraordinary. The usually fractious companies, including International Business Machines, Apple, Sun and Microsoft, hope for Unicode to become a global standard representing letters and characters in every language. Companies could then more readily write software to work in a variety of languages, and international computer communications would flow more smoothly. ""It's a lot more meaningful than Esperanto, because we're dealing with computers, not people"" said Esther Dyson, publisher of the newsletter Release 1.0. She added that the third world would benefit the most. ""It's like affirmative action for smaller nations,"" she said. Where a Bank Finds Cash Banks may be where they keep the money, but when Citicorp itself needs money, it looks to the Middle East. Prince al-Waleed bin Talal agreed last week to invest $590 million in Citicorp. He had accumulated 4.9 percent of the company's stock last year, so his latest purchase could give him 14.9 percent if he converts his new preferred stock to common. He said in 1988 that he ""would love to be a corporate raider""; just a joke, his aides now explain. Exactly where all the money is coming from is unclear. Prince Waleed is indeed a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, but he had to put up his house as collateral to get a loan from Citicorp just a decade ago. Where Citicorp will find even more badly needed capital might soon become clear. Other possible sources include the displaced royal rulers of Kuwait. ""You go wherever there is a lot of spare cash,"" said James E. Akins, a consultant and former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Even though the Saudi rulers are temporarily pinched, he said, ""There is a lot of spare cash in the Arabian peninsula."" COMPANIES",1991-02-24T05:00:00+0000

Shakespeare's Past Is Present","In 1595, as a member of a newly formed company of actors, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, William Shakespeare began a theatrically sophisticated tetralogy on events leading up to the civil conflict, the Wars of the Roses, that had ended about 100 years earlier. Together, ""Richard II,"" ""Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2"" and ""Henry V"" comprise an epic that some have compared to ""The Iliad."" Like most epics, the plays chronicle a society in transition -- England's emergence from a feudal state into a Renaissance nation. But when the two parts of ""Henry IV"" open on Wednesday at the Public Theater under the direction of JoAnne Akalaitis, with a score by Philip Glass, more than history will be on stage.

(AP) Track and Field Soviet Women Set Relay Mark: The Soviet Union set a world record in the women's 1,600-meter relay and a combined German team took the overall title yesterday at the Six Nations indoor meet in Paris. Germany collected 102 points, with the Soviet Union second with 100. France took third with 84.5 points, followed by Italy 74.5, Britain 62.5 and Spain 57.5. A Soviet foursome of Aelita Iurchenko, Lyudmila Szhigalova, Marina Shomonina and Margarita Ponomaerva was timed in 3 minutes 28.80 seconds, shattering the record by nearly six seconds. The previous mark was 3:34.38 by a West German team in 1981. Katrin Krabbe of Germany, a triple gold medalist at the 1990 European outdoor championships, won the women's 60-meter dash in 7.23. Sigrun Wodars, the 1988 Olympic champion for East Germany, won the women's 800 in 2:00.91. (AP) Tennis Edberg-Svensson Final: Jonas Svensson saved a match point and rallied to beat Guy Forget yesterday and set up an all-Swedish final against Stefan Edberg in the $1 million Eurocard Classic tournament in Stuttgart, Germany. Svensson ended Forget's bid for a third tournament triumph this year and the second in a row with a 2-6, 7-6, 6-2 victory. Edberg, the No. 1 player in the world, beat Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands, 6-4, 6-4. The seventh-seeded Svensson faced a match point on Forget's serve in the second-set tie breaker. But he saved it and went on to win the set and raced through the third after the sixth-seeded Frenchman began making too many errors. (AP) Lendl Breezes in Memphis: Top-seeded Ivan Lendl gave Derrick Rostagno a very brief but thorough lesson, winning in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2 to coast into the final of the $750,000 Volvo Indoor in Memphis. Lendl, ranked third in the world, took only 72 minutes to eliminate Rostagno, 11th-seeded and ranked 42d in the world.(AP) Boxing Knockdown Victory for Dele: Gilbert Dele of France won the vacant World Boxing Association junior middleweight title as he stopped Carlos Elliott in the seventh round of a scheduled 12-round fight yesterday in Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe.

(AP) Golf Sluman Grabs Share of Lead: Jeff Sluman, whose 1988 PGA Championship is his only tour victory, rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt on the final hole yesterday to grab a share of the lead after three rounds of the Los Angeles Open. Sluman shot a three-under-par 68 to move into a tie with second-day leader Bruce Lietzke, who had a 70. Sluman and Lietzke were 10-under at 203 through 54 holes at the Riviera Country Club, barely atop a logjam near the lead. Ted Schulz and Davis Love 3d, both with a 69, were a shot back. Four others were at 205. Lietzke opened a three-stroke lead with a second-round 63, but faltered on the back nine yesterday. Sluman overcame a slow start Saturday to catch Lietzke. Sluman shot a 1-over 36 on the front nine, but had five birdies and a bogey on the backside. Lietzke seemed on the verge of pulling away when he went on a three-birdie spree beginning at No. 9 to go 12-under, but slipped back with bogeys on the 14th and 15th holes.

After the tip off, play was stopped and the Runnin' Rebels were assessed a technical foul for having too many players on the court. No matter. They cruised to their 36th straight victory. The only team with even a slim chance of spoiling U.N.L.V.'s perfect regular season is New Mexico State, which faces the Rebels tonight in Las Cruces, N.M. Actually, an upset would occur tomorrow in some parts of the country. This insomniac's special won't end until 2 A.M. on the East Coast.",1991-02-25T05:00:00+0000

The lead changed hands eight times in the final 3:44, with Barkley's driving shot snapping a 90-90 tie. It was only the Lakers' third loss in their last 13 road games.

It was the 24th consecutive road setback for the Kings, who completed a six-game road trip.

But Washington dismissed the broadcast, saying that there had been no authoritative communication of its message, and that the war would go on. ALLIES FORGE AHEAD Bombers and attack helicopters roamed ahead of advancing allied armies in southern Iraq and Kuwait as Americans reported their first contact with the Iraqi Army's vaunted Republican Guard. Saudi and Kuwaiti units backed by United States Marines and airborne troops were reported preparing for an assault on Kuwait City, while a Marine amphibious force waited offshore. To the north, the 101st Airborne Division sat astride the Guards' supply lines as two other United States Army units, the First and Third Armored Divisions, were reported closing in on the Guards from the west. For the first time in the war, the allies reported the launching of Iraqi Silkworm anti-ship missiles at allied warships off Kuwait, but no damage was reported. Baghdad reported crushing allied ground attacks, with allied troops ""rolling in their blood and shame."" TERRORISM: 'THE ONLY IRAQI SUCCESS' Citing the destruction of Kuwait oil wells and reports that buildings were being blown up and citizens executed in Kuwait City, an allied Central Command spokesman said that ""terrorism remains the only Iraqi success to date."" The top Saudi general said he hopes to bring war crimes charges against those responsible. WAR LOSSES ALLIED FORCES Troops: In the worst Scud attack of the war, at least 27 American soldiers were killed and 98 were wounded when an Iraqi missile demolished a barracks in Saudi Arabia. Before the Scud attack, American casualties since the allied ground offensive began were listed as 4 killed and 21 wounded. From Jan. 17 to Feb. 23, 23 Americans were reported killed, 34 wounded and 9 missing. Five allied Arab soldiers were reported killed and 20 wounded in ground action. Aircraft: Four American aircraft were lost, with three of the five pilots rescued, bringing to 27 the tally of American planes lost in combat. Other allies have lost 9. IRAQI FORCES Troops: Iraqi troops continued to surrender en-masse, with the total now reported to about 20,000. There have been no reports from either side on the number of Iraqi dead and wounded. Armor and Weaponry: An ""extremely conservative"" count by American commanders listed more than 270 Iraqi tanks destroyed in two days, including 35 of their top-of-the-line T-72's.

us,Results Plus,"TENNIS A Losing Return for Connors Jimmy Connors, coming back after a long layoff, could not scrape the rust off his game fast enough to avoid a 6-3, 6-0 pounding last night by Jaime Yzaga in the first round of the Volvo-Chicago tournament. The 38-year-old Connors had not played a match since losing to Ronald Agenor at Toulouse, France, early last October. He underwent surgery on his left wrist in November, then spent nine weeks in a cast. Connors was not sharp enough to play competitive tennis, even against the 65th-ranked Yzaga. He was broken in the fourth and eighth games and Yzaga closed out the first set on serve in the ninth game. In the second set, Connors managed to win just 7 points, ""Was I nervous to play? Yeah, a little,"" Connors said. ""But not about playing. I was nervous to see how my wrist would hold up."" Connors said the loss hardly discouraged him and called his comeback effort ""a day-to-day thing."" He said he hoped his game would improve enough to warrant a shot at the United States Open, which he has won five times. Connors is now ranked No. 978. In another first-round match, top-seeded John McEnroe defeated Gilad Bloom of Israel, 6-2, 6-1. (AP) SKIING Girardelli Nears Fourth Title Rudolf Nierlich may have won the slalom, but the third-place finisher, Marc Girardelli, was the big winner. Girardelli, skiing despite an aching left knee, took a big step toward a record-tying fourth World Cup overall title yesterday at Oppdal, Norway, as two of his main rivals were disqualified for missing gates in the opening run. The next two World Cup races, a giant slalom and a slalom, are set for this weekend at Lillehammer, Norway, site of the 1994 Winter Olympics. Girardelli, who finished 42 hundredths of a second behind Nierlich, has had problems with his left knee since a crash in Colorado in 1984. Dr. Richard Steadman, surgeon for the United States Ski Team, rebuilt Girardelli's left knee. Girardelli added 15 points yesterday for a total of 191. Nierlich won his first slalom of the season, edging Paul Accola of Switzerland by 18 hundredths of a second as the men's tour resumed after a six-week break. (AP) N.B.A. Bulls Rout Celtics for 10th in Row Scottie Pippen scored 13 of his 33 points in a 33-12 first quarter as Chicago scored a 129-99 home-court victory over Boston, the Bulls' 10th triumph in a row. The second quarter belonged to Michael Jordan, who finished with 39 points, 18 in the period. The Bulls won their 19th straight at Chicago Stadium. The 30-point loss was Boston's worst of the season. (AP) Cavaliers 106, Pistons 103: Larry Nance scored 7 points during a span of 2:11 late in the fourth quarter and Cleveland withstood three 3-pointers by Dennis Rodman to beat Detroit, 106-103. The loss was Detroit's sixth in nine games. The Pistons were without the starting guards Joe Dumars (strained hamstring) and Isiah Thomas (injured right wrist) and the backup forward John Salley (strained back). (AP) Bucks 119, Heat 106: Dan Schayes, averaging 9.6 points a game, scored 29 to pace visiting Milwaukee. He had a season-high 31 Saturday in a victory over Cleveland. (AP)",1991-02-27T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Bush also demanded that Iraq hand over all prisoners, assist with mine-clearing operations and comply with all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. BUSH PROCLAIMS VICTORY President Bush said, ""Kuwait is liberated. Iraq's army is defeated. Our military objectives are met."" His address followed a tank battle described as the largest since World War II, in which 800 American tanks and armored vehicles, battleing 250 to 300 Iraqi tanks, reportedly defeated two Republican Guard divisions some 50 miles west of Basra.
