us,Greece: A Vow to Erase a Shame," Prime Minister Antonis Samaras of Greece suggested on Monday that he wanted to eradicate Golden Dawn, the neo-fascist xenophobic political party that is now facing a major government crackdown on charges it is a criminal organization involved in murder, attempted murder, blackmail and other crimes. Mr. Samaras, who was visiting New York for the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, said in a reception sponsored by the American Jewish Committee that his government had no tolerance for the partys anti-immigrant intimidation tactics and other fascist behavior. We are dedicated in completely eradicating such a shame, he said. We must do it within the context of our democratic Constitution. But we have to go all the way and do whatever it takes. His remarks appeared to go beyond previous statements about trying to curb the power of Golden Dawn, which has 18 members in Parliament.

Mr. Abbott, who traveled to Indonesia for talks, has come under fire for continuing a policy that ships asylum seekers arriving by boat to third countries for processing and denies them the right to ever settle in Australia. Mr. Abbotts own plans for combating people smuggling  including forcing boats packed with asylum seekers back into Indonesian waters, buying up boats and gathering intelligence in Indonesian villages  have been heavily criticized by Indonesia. Migrants from the Middle East and South Asia pay smugglers to get them into Indonesia and then onto rickety boats that make the perilous voyage to the Australian territory of Christmas Island, where the migrants can apply for asylum. On Friday, a vessel carrying about 100 people from Lebanon, Pakistan and Iraq sank off West Java, killing at least 36 people. ",2013-10-01T00:57:46+0000

The decisions will be appealed, said Lanna Hollo, a legal officer for the Open Society Justice Initiative, an advocacy organization that supported the lawsuits. In linked but separate civil cases, 13 black and Arab men requested 10,000 euros, about $13,600, in damages from the state after being stopped and in some cases frisked by the police; none of the stops were followed by further police action or charges. The court found that the men had been unable to prove racial motives for the identity checks, which are widely viewed in France as a legitimate policing tactic. A 2009 study conducted by French researchers and the Open Society Justice Initiative found that Arabs and blacks were as much as eight times more likely to be stopped than whites.

Eating was not meant to be part of the experience, says Andrew F. Smith, author of Popped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn in America.

In Cains novels, desire is a prison, a death trap.

What came seeping from around those blockages was a mordant and effervescently graceful disquisition on the nature of poetry, poets, failure and the interesting blind pain of wrongness: a riff-tastic essay masquerading as a novel, or vice versa.

(Showtime) THE MASTER (2012) Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays Lancaster Dodd, the leader of the Cause, a therapeutic, religion-tinged cult built around using painful questions to delve into a subjects past and get at the root of negative emotion and destructive behavior. Joaquin Phoenix (above left, with Mr. Hoffman) plays Freddie Quell, a World War II Navy veteran and alcoholic wreck who seeks solace through Dodds method. And Amy Adams is Peggy Dodd, the latest of her husbands wives and the hidden hand that guides his empire. The Master is really more Freddies story than Dodds, and some of the films drama resides in the struggle between the two characters  and perhaps the two actors  for supremacy, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, which earned its three principals Oscar nominations. Youll be my protg and my guinea pig, Dodd says to Freddie shortly after their first meeting. There turns out to be a lot more to it than that. They are father and son, guru and disciple, passionate friends and bitter competitors locked in a relationship whose sexual undercurrents are as palpable and mysterious as the motion of water under the surface of the ocean. The film, he added, is wild and enormous, its scale almost commensurate with Lancaster Dodds hubris and its soul nearly as restless as Freddie Quells. It is a movie about the lure and folly of greatness that comes as close as anything Ive seen recently to being a great movie. ",2013-10-05T05:00:05+0000

More widely, he said: We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods . . . .

A far cry from the standard-issue budget digs of yore, the hostel suites offer duvet-covered beds, complimentary local telephone calls and optional room service. And the upgrade to a private room comes with the usual boutique hotel comforts: modern dcor (earth tones and oak parquet floors, gray walls dotted with black-and-white photographs of Old Reykjavik), extra-cozy beds (made with up with Lissadell linens) and stunning, top-floor views (of the citys boldly colored roofs).",2013-10-07T17:18:10+0000

He forages aromatic plants, mushrooms, tree trimmings and moss on the trails around the West Coast, then distills everything using an old-fashioned enfleurage process to create essential oils that smell like the Mojave Desert after the rain or a dusky summer evening along the Timberline Trail on Mount Hood. People say the scents remind them of camping, said Newbegin, who currently lives by Mount Tamalpais in Northern California and trained in herbal medicine before becoming what he calls a wildness nose. The latest additions to his forest-centric range are two addition to his line of backpackers colognes: Big Sur, which is infused with wild sage, and Yuba River, a blend redolent of cedar log cabins and the richness of hiking-boot leather.

The label, which took its name from a track by the folk singer Marissa Nadler, one of its artists, has enjoyed one success after another. The first LP by the scrappy guitar-pop band Best Coast moved more than 100,000 copies (and subsequently landed in a Windows ad), a sizable number even for a major these days. The garage rocker Kurt Vile, the lo-fi experimental weirdo Ariel Pink and the chillwave act Washed Out have also experienced success with Mexican Summer.

Out of Hand: Materializing the Postdigital which opens on Tuesday at the Museum of Arts and Design, will present the efforts of some 80 architects, designers and artists from 20 countries, with the designers in the majority. Presenting digital-dependent work from the last decade, displays will run the gamut from life-changing (if not saving) to frivolous, among them dinnerware, sports shoes, furnishings, clothing, buildings and various forms of three-dimensional art. Those represented include Bathsheba Grossman, Greg Lynn, Marc Newson, Magnus Larsson, Roxy Paine, Frank Stella, Zaha Hadid and J. Mayer H. Architects (whose seemingly astounding Metropol Parasol, completed in 2011, spans a plaza in the old quarter of Seville, Spain). The show may harbor a bit much in the way of jewelry and bad art, and most of the buildings will be represented by photographs, but new and useful information should compensate.

After assembling a band through friends and neighbors, their first album as a five-piece, Wildewoman, is due Tuesday from Mom + Pop Music. But their act  with Andrew Burri, Peter Lalish and Ms. Wolfes husband, Dan Molad, on drums, guitars and bass  has already earned fans for its girl-group harmonies and resourceful rhythms; for their Tiny Desk concert on NPR, they turned an empty cashew container into a drum.

Because of worries about press freedom, the government wants newspapers to agree voluntarily to be governed by a new regulatory body and whatever rules it sets up, and has suggested some incentives to win their cooperation. The move to tighten regulations follows a phone-hacking scandal that emerged in 2011 and led to the closing of a newspaper in Rupert Murdochs media empire. Under the plan agreed to Friday, the new regulator could impose fines of up to $1.3 million for violations of its code of conduct. Several prominent newspaper groups argue that any regulatory body set up by politicians could be used to control the news media. It is unclear if the parties will now press ahead with their plan or try again to win more media support. ",2013-10-12T00:49:05+0000

R. R. Tolkiens first Middle-earth fantasy novel, part of a planned trilogy. Richard Armitage plays the exiled dwarf king Thorin, who leads the expedition through a series of encounters with orcs, elves, trolls and other beings. Andy Serkis returns, with the assistance of computer generation, as Gollum. The meeting between Bilbo and Gollum, which takes place in a vast, watery subterranean cavern, is the one fully enchanted piece of An Unexpected Journey, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Its a funny, haunting and curiously touching moment that summons the audience to a state of quiet, eager attentiveness. Even if you arent aware of the apocalyptic importance of Gollums precious ring, you feel that a lot is at stake here: Bilbos life and integrity; Gollums corroded soul; the fate of Middle-earth itself.

(13) 56 UP (2013) In 1964, the director Michael Apted interviewed 14 British 7-year-olds for a television documentary, returning to film the same children every seven years as they progressed into adulthood. This latest installment finds the subjects, like Tony, left, settling into middle age. As in the earlier movies, Mr. Apted again folds in older material from the ages of 7, 14 and so on, to set the scene and jog memories, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. The abrupt juxtapositions of epochs can be jarring, unnerving or touching  sometimes all three  as bright-faced children bloom and sometimes fade within seconds. An analogous project in print or even still photographs wouldnt be as powerful, because what gives the Up series its punch is not so much its longevity or the human spectacle it offers, but that these are moving images of touchingly vibrant lives at certain moments in time and space.

The man, Ji Zhongxing, had been trying to draw attention to his allegations that officials in Dongguan, an industrial city in far southern China, ignored his complaints that security officers there beat him so severely in 2005 that he was unable to walk and had to use a wheelchair. The blast badly injured Mr. Ji and slightly wounded a police officer. The case kindled widespread debate in China, with some Internet users voicing sympathy for Mr. Ji and his ire with government officials. Dongguan officials said they had given him compensation of 100,000 renminbi, or about $16,400, on condition that he drop his complaints. Mr. Ji pleaded not guilty to the charges. His lawyers argued that he had not meant to detonate the explosive, the China News Service reported. The maximum sentence for the charge was 10 years in prison. ",2013-10-15T04:19:37+0000

Against my indictment of the Republican caucus as a whole, theyve basically argued that the seeming irrationality of G.O.P. strategy across the last few weeks mostly just reflects the mistakes, shading into incompetence, of John Boehners negotiating strategy, rather the kind of deeper, essentially methodless dysfunction that I see when I look at the House Republicans.At bottom, these interlocutors think that the House Republicans are a fairly normal majority with a serious leadership problem, and they think Im a victim of what you might call the pundits limited-horizon problem, which fails to work in vitally-useful knowledge political science research in Costs case, business-school theory in Daviss case that would pin more of the responsibility on Boehner, and less on his backbenchers. (You can also read a more personalized version of this argument here, from the pseudonymous blogger Thomas Crown, which is based on a slight misreading of a tweet I wrote to Davis  such are the perils of Twitter! but which works off the entirely correct assumption that my analysis of internal House dynamics lacks the benefit of sustained personal experience with high-stakes negotiations in politics, law or the business world.)",2013-10-17T19:43:22+0000

Typically, Vongerichten says, you cook against the wall, turn around, plate it and it goes out. At Jean-Georges, the staff members cook various elements at their stations and then walk them up to the pass  where they assemble the dishes with monastic precision. When your shrimp appetizer, being plated lower left by two cooks, comes with crispy baby artichokes, crispy mushrooms, smoked paprika gel, lemon fennel pure, microthyme and parsley, a more collaborative and focused effort is required.

And early Roman manuscripts include references to brassica, a word that encompassed wild turnips, cabbages and kalelike plants. By the Middle Ages, kale had spread through Europe and Asia. The Italians developed plants with dinosaur scales, while the Scots created varietals with leaves like frilly petticoats. The Russians produced kale that could survive in the snow. But by the time Tim Peters, who was then farming in Oregon, began experimenting with the plant in the 1980s, kale had become boring.

According to an Associated Press-GfK poll conducted in April, 59 percent of the country believes in a conspiracy, while 24 percent accepts the Warren Commissions conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Another 16 percent isnt sure. (Yes, that adds up to 99 percent. The rest probably blames President Obama.) The best-seller list reflects this split personality. Killing Kennedy, by Bill OReilly and Martin Dugard, echoes the Warren Reports lone gunman thesis and has spent 34 weeks on the hardcover nonfiction list; its currently on the extended list at No. 22. Meanwhile, a new case for conspiracy hits the nonfiction list at No. 14: They Killed Our President, by the renowned historian and investigative journalist Jesse (the Body) Ventura, who with Dick Russell and David Wayne argues the president was killed by disgruntled C.I.A. agents, anti-Castro Cubans and members of the Mafia. . . . Members of the U.S. military were also involved. Like the former professional wrestler he is, Ventura confronts his biggest rival head on.

Design, like all forms of art, can be very personal; members of one of Englands most celebrated families, Emma, Issy and Stella Tennant, draw inspiration from nature, namely from the bucolic surroundings in Scotland to create their sculptures and paintings. It can also be very pared down and minimal, like in the home of two fashion designers in Tokyo, or in the distilled, spacious Antwerp residence of the Belgian architect Vincent Van Duysen. On a larger scale, we discover designers and artisans determined to reinvent neighborhoods and cities around the world. In Sydneys Rosebery neighborhood, three businesses celebrate the best of the citys agriculture, craftsmanship and furniture design. Meanwhile, in Belgrade, locals are turning their city into a world-class destination, with the emergence of design hotels, art museums and adventurous restaurants. We embrace those who break with convention in art and design; Not Vital, a Swiss artist obsessed with habitats, is the Picasso, the Dali, the Andy Warhol of today, claims Andrew OHagan. Howard Slatkins Fifth Avenue apartment is filled with custom-made items, from floor to ceiling; each room has a combination of textiles, lighting, objets dart from different eras and countries.

The group, the only consortium to submit a bid in the auction, will pay a signing fee of about $7 billion to start work on the 35-year concession. The deep-sea field, called Libra, is believed to be one of Brazils most promising exploration areas. Legislation requires the Brazilian company to take control of the new operation, but doubts persist among energy analysts as to whether Petrobras, which has soaring debt and is trying to reverse a decline in Brazils oil production, is overstretched with an array of offshore projects. The auction was carried out in Rio de Janeiro amid protests by oil workers and other groups that oppose the participation of foreign companies in Brazils oil industry. ",2013-10-22T00:35:59+0000

This combination would no doubt be politically helpful to the Republican Party in the short run, but (I argued) it would actually leave liberals with a fairly clear path forward: Keep pressing the Medicaid expansion on states that havent taken it (and look for John Kasich-style Republicans to partner with), return to the Joe Lieberman-killed idea of expanding Medicare to 55-and-overs, and basically try to further shrink the percentage of Americans who arent eligible for one or both of those single-payer programs. This wouldnt amount to the full-on push for single payer that some people expect from the left if Obamacare fails or gets repealed, but it would move the U.S. toward the closest thing to single payer that were ever likely to get: A system in which both the late middle-aged and the lower middle class gradually get folded into government-run insurance alongside the poor, the disabled, and the aged; the individual market survives as a kind of de facto high risk pool (overpriced but technically accessible); and the employer mandate helps prop up employer-based health insurance for a shrunken but still substantial share of the population.",2013-10-22T21:26:06+0000

Yet this city  Wisconsins largest, population 600,000  is hardly a backward-looking place.

The case, one of the most notorious recent child-abduction cases in Europe, was formally closed in 2008. But after a campaign by the girls parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, British and Portuguese investigators began reviewing the evidence two years ago and independently uncovered new leads. In July, British officials opened a formal investigation, and now Portugal has followed suit. Portuguese investigators did not specify what the new leads were, but according to the police in London they are separate from the ones being followed in Britain. Teams from both countries met a week ago to compare notes and to brief the McCanns on the progress. Madeleine disappeared on May 3, 2007, from an apartment in a resort in Praia da Luz, Portugal, while her parents were having dinner at a nearby restaurant. ",2013-10-25T04:08:11+0000

This maneuver was so awkward that you risked burning your hand. So in the 1980s, a number of food-packaging engineers tried to fix the problem. William and Kenneth Dart, of the Dart Container Corporation, created one of the first of a new breed of coffee-cup lids, filing a patent in 1981 for a plastic disc with a press-down tab that acted like a valve. The inventors called this feature a lip-engaging buttress; you pushed on it with your upper lip to release a gulp of coffee. Once you finished drinking, the tab snapped back into place to prevent spills.

Stanton, a 29-year-old Georgia native, started photographing strangers in 2010 after finding his way to New York from Chicago, where he had recently lost his job as a bond trader. My mom basically thought this was my glorified way of not working, he told ABCs Nightline last month. Like, oh, Brandons in New York taking pictures of people on the street and putting them on Facebook, you know what I mean? That description isnt far off the mark, actually. But it misses the primal voyeuristic appeal of Stantons blog, which only increased after he started interviewing his subjects and including short quotations or anecdotes with their portraits. (Q. Where are you from? A. Russia. If you see a doctor smoking, hes from Russia.)",2013-10-25T15:01:49+0000

Few 20th-century figures combined these traits in a more appealing package than the English writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, Paddy to his many friends, who died in 2011 at the age of 96. One of these was Diana Cooper, a famous beauty who turned up in the fiction of Evelyn Waugh.

Wheeler seems not to have calculated the effects of her own gratuitous insults, whether aimed at the agreeable Fattytowns of the Midwest or the crap of contemporary America she encounters at a once-grand seaside resort community in Massachusetts.

(HBO) CLOUD ATLAS (2012) Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, above, take on multiple roles  for Mr. Hanks, a Hawaiian goatherd, a scientist, a London gangster and a 19th-century quack; for Ms. Berry, a muckraking journalist, a researcher and the wife of a temperamental maestro  in this adaptation of David Mitchells 2004 novel, written and directed by Lana and Andy Wachowski and Tom Tykwer. Cloud Atlas is a movie about migratory souls and wayward civilizations, loaded with soaring themes and flights of feeling, as vaporous and comprehensive as its title, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, adding that perhaps the films achievement should be quantified rather than judged in more conventional, qualitative ways. This is by no means the best movie of the year, but it may be the most movie you can get for the price of a single ticket. Its six sections also star Doona Bae, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving and Ben Whishaw. Together the filmmakers try so hard to give you everything  the secrets of the universe and the human heart; action, laughs and romance; tragedy and mystery  that you may wind up feeling both grateful and disappointed.

(HBO) SEDUCED AND ABANDONED (2013) In May 2012, James Toback and Alec Baldwin (from left above) spent 10 days schmoozing their way through the Cannes Film Festival as they tried to secure financing for a proposed movie project: a political-erotic Middle Eastern adventure inspired by Bernardo Bertoluccis Last Tango in Paris and starring Mr. Baldwin and Neve Campbell as the characters played by Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider. The men filmed the proceedings  from pitches to billionaires and studio moguls to encounters with movie stars and directors  then turned it into a cinematic romp about Hollywood deal making. Seduced and Abandoned, which uses split screens much of the time, rambles entertainingly from topic to topic, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times.

Mr. Gates  the Harvard professor, author and critic  is highly visible, interviewing historians, talking to older black Africans who acknowledge that their ancestors became wealthy through the slave trade, chatting with contemporary black Americans over Hoppin John and iced tea, standing at seemingly innocuous city intersections where shameful history unfolded, Anita Gates wrote in The New York Times.

In The War of the Worlds, at 9, American Experience revisits Orson Welless radio drama about an alien invasion on Oct. 30, 1938, and the hysteria it caused. ",2013-10-29T05:00:06+0000

But the same thing seemed to be happening to a lot of people who, like me, swear by their Apple products. When I called tech analysts, they said that the new operating system (iOS 7) being pushed out to existing users was making older models unbearably slow. Apple phone batteries, which have a finite number of charges in them to begin with, were drained by the new software. So I could pay Apple $79 to replace the battery, or perhaps spend 20 bucks more for an iPhone 5C. It seemed like Apple was sending me a not-so-subtle message to upgrade.",2013-10-29T09:00:07+0000

The inquiry began last month, after the killing of an anti-fascist singer by a self-professed supporter of Golden Dawn. The killing was the culmination of a string of assaults attributed to members or supporters of the fiercely anti-immigrant party, which has 18 seats in Greeces 300-member Parliament. Out of 319 police officers questioned, 15 were arrested on various charges, including illegal weapons possession and trading in contraband goods, and of those, 10 were found to have direct or indirect involvement with the criminal activities of Golden Dawn, according to the head of the polices internal affairs unit, Panagiotis Stathis. The investigation found no organized cells, factions or unconstitutional hubs but highlighted inadequate supervision within the force, he added at a news conference.
