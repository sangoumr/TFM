us,Sports People; Nehemiah Talks Track,"Not many years ago, he was track and field's No. 1 hurdler, and world marks he set in 1981 and 1982 still stand. But from complacency that made him ''tire of track and field the way a child tires of a toy,'' Renaldo (Skeets) Nehemiah at the age of 24 sought new challenges in pro football and spent four years as a wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers. He showed occasional brilliance, but never achieved the dominance he had known as a hurdler. Nehemiah regained his amateur status in track in 1986, but his comeback was postponed last year by an Achilles' tendon injury that required surgery. Only now does he feel his speed and strength have returned intact, but he has yet to regain the hurdling technique that enabled him to establish a world record 12.93 seconds in the 110 meters outdoors in 1981 and a world best of 6.82 seconds indoors at 55 meters in 1982. ''I don't know if anyone, including me, can ever surpass those record times,'' said Nehemiah, now 28 years old and assistant track coach at Stanford. ''I'm old news to young guys in track now, but I want to reclaim my reputation for being the best. I have to forget about being a world-record holder and just be a competitor.'' Nehemiah is not talking or thinking about the Olympics now. His immediate goal is to regain form and win a race, the one on Friday in the Panasonic-Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden where his old rival, Greg Foster, will offer the main opposition in the 55-meter hurdles. ''The thought of beating Greg is a great incentive for me,'' Nehemiah said at a track writers' luncheon at Madison Square Garden. ''He's the number one hurdler in the world now.''",1988-02-02T05:00:00+0000

It was his first public comment about the matter. Page A1 Mr. Meese advised Shimon Peres in a 1985 letter to deal with the national security adviser rather than with the State Department on secret discussions about the pipeline project, officials said. A8 A new Middle East peace approach has been proposed by the United States, officials said. It would provide elections for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and a formula for a peace conference on the Middle East. A1 The undecided votes on contra aid were reported by both White House officials and Congressional Democrats to be turning in their favor. But neither side was openly confident of victory. A3 The most wanted man in Nicaragua may be Israel Galeano Cornejo, who is, by all accounts, the most effective commander the contras have ever had. He is an eight-year veteran of war against the Sandinistas. A3 In Ecuador's presidential election, a Social Democratic lawyer finished first and will face a left-leaning opponent in a runoff May 8. The results were a major setback for conservative forces there. A3 A former Soviet official denounced privilege and criticized Raisa Gorbachev and the Soviet Foreign Minister in the speech that led to his dismissal, Le Monde reported. The official, Boris N. Yeltsin was Moscow Communist Party chief.

A1 The Bush-Rather faceoff neither helped nor harmed the Vice President's image, but the persistent controversy over his role in the Iran-contra affair may be taking a heavy toll, a New York Times poll shows. A1 A $1 billion toxic waste cleanup of the most contaminated site in the country, the Army's Rocky Mountain Arsenal, will be paid for by the the Army and the Shell Oil Company, according to a court settlement. A10 Presidential candidates' advertising on television for the New Hampshire primary has cost $1.8 million, with Republicans outspending Democrats 13-to-1, according to a study of campaign spending. A14 Is Jack Kemp being re-discovered? Recent polls have found his standing among Republicans has improved, and conservative publications have rallied to his cause. A14 An oil spill in Puget Sound resulted when a barge sank in pristine water about 70 miles north of Seattle. Coast Guard officials, trying to avert an en-vironmental catastrophe, are struggling to contain the heavy oil. A13 AIDS research using a ''mouse jail'' is being conducted at the National Institutes of Health. The animals carry genes from the AIDS virus, and fears of their escape are the reason for the security precautions.

The plan calls for increased taxes and substantial cuts in services to close what he said would be a $758 million budget gap. A1 The status of the Board of Estimate in New York City is the subject of debate. Members of the board rejected the idea that it was endangered, because any effort to restructure it was likely to violate the Federal Voting Rights Act. A1 A fire in an apartment building in Passaic, N.J., destroyed much of the building and left about 500 people homeless, almost all of them former residents of India, officials said. There were no injuries among the residents. B2 A ''sting'' operation was exposed prematurely last month when court officials learned of the investigation, officials said. In the operation, property agents were videotaped taking valuables from the homes of people they thought were dead. B1 An appraisal: The architecture for Grand Central Terminal is monumental. It is deeply connected with the life of the city. Like New York's other great works of monumental architecture, it unites the noble and the ordinary.

The danger of extreme volatility persists, it said. Also found that many market-makers did not do enough to cushion the plunge in prices. The S.E.C. called for curbs on speculation in stock index futures. It recommended bolstering the financial strength of market-makers and encouraging greater disclosure of the identity of big buyers and sellers. Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms: Otherwise known as the Brady commission, attributed the market plunge mainly to a handful of major investors using computer-assisted trading techniques. Rather than ban those techniques, it urged greater coordination among stocks and futures exchanges, under one regulatory authority, possibly the Federal Reserve Board. Recommended unification of settlement and clearing mechanisms among stocks, options and futures and comparable margin (or down payment) standards on them. Also urged ''circuit-breakers'' on stocks to suspend and cool off runaway trading. New York Stock Exchange: Study by Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, a former Attorney General, blamed speculation in stock index futures and recommended restraints on such trading. Also urged contingency plan for shutting exchanges in emergencies. General Accounting Office: Repeated breakdowns of computer systems on the New York Stock Exchange aggravated selling on Oct. 19. Faulted Federal regulators for inadequate contingency planning.

Page 1 News analysis: The indictment holds little promise of leading to the arrest of General Noriega, and it complicates efforts by the Reagan Administration to ease the Panamanian leader from power. 5 A new Palestinian leadership and organization in the occupied territories is developing. This secret leadership committee is tied to the local factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Islamic fundamentalists. 1 Growing Palestinian unrest and threats of vigilantism among the Jewish settlements rooted like citadel-suburbs amid resentful Arabs are posing fresh problems for the Israeli Army as it faces a third month of Palestinian protest. 1 Approval of the pending arms treaty was threatened to be delayed by Democratic leaders over the issue of how treaties are interpreted. The issue has been a long-standing dispute between Senate Democrats and the Administration. 1 A prominent victim of Stalin's terror, Nikolai I. Bukharin, was wrongly convicted and executed, an official Soviet commission reviewing the purge trials of the 1930's said.

Ethiopia has agreed to create new incentives for food production to combat a famine, United Nations officials say. 3 Poland's purging of many Jews in 1967 from the Communist Party will soon be acknowledged as a ''political error,'' according to a scholar who said he was conveying a message from the Polish leader. 5 Military analysis: The contras have been dealt a psychological blow by the Congressional rejection of President Reagan's aid package.

But for some goods and services campaigns will get less for their money. 9 George Bush stepped up his attacks on Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, saying that Mr. Dole started a fight with the Vice President's campaign but could not take it when they fought back.

Jamaica Just, a young journalist working for a large New York City daily, is the heroine of this first novel by the Wall Street Journal film critic Julie Salamon. Using the device of Jamaica's newspaper assignments on New York life and its characters, Ms. Salamon turns out some observant sketches of, among other subjects, welfare mothers and people who write letters to the editor. But it is a piece on the Holocaust that occasions a series of flashbacks to Jamaica's childhood as the daughter of two survivors who resettled in a quiet Midwestern farming community. Although the novel's psychological portrait of Jamaica is indistinct - she suffers, we are told, from a vague sense of unease, a nameless guilt about her parents' unspoken past - these retrospective views are the most successful sections of the book. The portrayals of Jamaica's Czechoslovak parents, her feisty mother and silent doctor father, and of the beauty and dangers of rural America are evocative and vivid, written with a light, bittersweet poignancy. This contrasts with Ms. Salamon's edgy presentation of Jamaica's up-to-the-minute life as a married working woman; here there is some sharp writing, but the unmodulated tone of New York street-smart flippancy is often misplaced and sounds a number of wrong notes. While one could argue that the story of one's life - and this book seems to be strongly autobiographical - does not require thematic coherence, ''White Lies'' has no center that would serve to pull together its unrelated, episodic set pieces.",1988-02-07T05:00:00+0000

You made me love what we read.''

On the last page of this curious memoir, the blues singer Pleasant Joseph writes: ''The good Lord gave me a chance to make a comeback. I had messed up my whole life from drinking: from slow horses, from fast women and bad whiskey.'' This passage comes as a complete surprise; although ''Cousin Joe: Blues From New Orleans'' contains frequent references to Mr. Joseph's drinking, gambling and womanizing, there has been no indication up to this point that these activities had ''messed up'' his life to the degree that there was ever anything other than a well-earned retirement for him to ''make a comeback'' from. Such is the nature of the book, which tends to be discursive in tone and casual in its approach to matters of substance. It is also strangely uninformative about Mr. Joseph's musical career, and anyone who isn't already aware of his importance is apt to find this account more confusing than enlightening on that score. ''Cousin Joe'' contains some incisive observations about race, poverty and music, and some entertaining anecdotes. But it seems awfully lightweight for a work that Mr. Joseph's collaborator, Harriet J. Ottenheimer, says took the two of them 20 years to complete. Ms. Ottenheimer, a professor of anthropology at Kansas State University, has attempted to distill Mr. Joseph's rambling reminiscences into a narrative ''intended for a general reading public.'' But since the book is so stingy with relevant information, it's hard to see what appeal it could have for that vast portion of the general public that has never heard of Cousin Joe.",1988-02-07T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"1919: The Year Our World Began. By William K. Klingaman. (Dunne/St. Martin's, $27.95.) The year 1919, by any yardstick, was an eventful one, and the historian William K. Klingaman persuasively demonstrates that it began with hope, ended in despair and shaped the 20th century. Consider these highlights: With hostilities ended in the Great War, Woodrow Wilson spends several months in Paris working on a treaty; by year's end, his dream of a League of Nations is shattered. Meanwhile, loyalist Russians wage a futile battle with Bolsheviks; Lincoln Steffens, an ardent supporter of Lenin, tells anyone who listens that he has ''been over into the future, and it works.'' As Germany accepts humiliating peace terms, a former corporal with mesmeric qualities joins a right-wing workers' party and articulates a philosophy of hate. In India, another charismatic leader - this one committed to nonviolence -begins to unite his countrymen against colonial rule. Throughout the world, hunger and unrest foment violence and strikes. Prohibition becomes law, Einstein's theory of relativity is validated, the White Sox throw the World Series and Charlie Chaplin joins Mary Pickford, D. W. Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks to form United Artists. Mr. Klingaman does an admirable job of getting us into the flow of the times with a narrative that relies heavily on contemporary news accounts. Readers will note the almost total absence of analysis, a shortcoming the author cheerfully acknowledges was intentional. But as a detailed record of 12 extraordinary months, his lively chronicle achieves immediacy and sustains attention.",1988-02-07T05:00:00+0000

Like John Gunther's ''Inside . . .'' series, John Ardagh's book about Germany may be of some use to those readers who have absolutely no idea at all about the subject being dealt with. Like Gunther, Mr. Ardagh (the author of ''France in the 1980s'') leans heavily on information garnered from tourist boards. There is much quoting of statistics and polls about everything from employment to sexual attitudes. Unlike Gunther's books, ''Germany and the Germans'' offers no photographs, thereby forcing us to focus entirely on the text - and Mr. Ardagh's observations range from the merely naive to the dangerously foolish. The author breezily addresses many historical topics, with headings like ''Buoyant Berlin, the Survivor That Came in From the Cold.'' The tone is sometimes sappily optimistic, like a tourist brochure, even when discussing such grave subjects as the destruction of Germany's forests by air pollution and the problems of Turkish immigrants. As for the inevitable discussion of Nazis, past and present, the author's soft-pedaling of anything negative achieves shocking results. He speaks of a historical ''brighter side of this picture'' - for example, a few dozen Nazi war criminals received life sentences (most were later pardoned). Then he hastens to pooh-pooh the notion of neo-Nazism, describing it ''insofar as it does exist.''

us,'ART INTO PRODUCTION',"Before the Revolution of 1917, Russian artists were already experimenting with radical visual vocabularies based on abstraction and geometric forms. The pioneers of Suprematism and later Constructivism further championed a new marriage of ''art and life.'' After the Revolution, artists such as Alexander Rodchenko, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Liubov Popova and El Lissitzky actively participated in advertising the virtues of their new society. But they were not simply servants of party politics; they applied their talents to improving Russian industry. The goal of the Productivist artists, as the avant-gardists became known, was to imbue material culture with a new beauty. As Elena Chernevich, a teacher at the Moscow Polygraphic Institute, writes in SOVIET COMMERCIAL DESIGN OF THE TWENTIES (Abbeville, $37.50), ''Art . . . was to be replaced by design, and design not for an elite but for the lives of the masses.'' A new slogan, ''Art into production,'' defined the idea that Russian applied artists had a role in restyling a variety of industrial products and, just as important, the advertising used to sell them. This required a new typography and layout style that completely rejected traditional symmetry and ornament in favor of more reductive and objective graphic forms. Until the publication of this book - edited and designed by the graphic artist Mikhail Anikst and translated by Catherine Cooke - few Westerners were aware of the wide range of Soviet advertising. This exciting material provides a fascinating look at accouterments of consumer culture before Stalin's socialist realism returned advertising design to an unimaginative state.",1988-02-07T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"WINTERS' TALES: Stories and Observations for the Unusual. By Jonathan Winters. (Random House, $13.95.) Included in the publicity material sent to reviewers along with ''Winters' Tales'' is a quotation from Jonathan Winters's most famous fan. ''Jonathan showed me,'' Robin Williams writes, ''that anything is possible - one of the few people able to make me laugh from my soul.'' Notice that while praising his mentor, Mr. Williams does not specifically refer to the book itself, which may mean that he too found these dozens of whimsically macabre short pieces disappointing, sounding faint echoes of H. P. Lovecraft and Steve Martin's ''Cruel Shoes,'' even fainter echoes of such memorable Jonathan Winters characters as Maude Frickert. The comedian-turned-parabolist sometimes gives his stories an ending with a twist, sometimes gives them a twisted ending, sometimes gives them both. Recurring themes are nostalgia for small-town life, the importance of toys to both young and old, the bond between children and grandparents, the estrangement between children and parents, mental imbalance and death - lots of it. Unfortunately, the stories of cognitive animals who turn out to be stuffed, generals who are engaged in military combat with what are revealed to be lead soldiers and cranky partygoers who (surprise, surprise) are the President and First Lady are, if not predictable and menacing or predictable and sentimental, simply so arbitrary as to confound comprehension. What Mr. Winters, who at 60-plus is, in his daughter's phrase, ''proud to be strange,'' has come up with is the equivalent of Garbage Pail Kids cards for adults.",1988-02-07T05:00:00+0000

In ''God's Water Carriers,'' Manes Sperber (1905-84) describes a time during his youth when, questioning God and beginning a lifelong debate over his faith, he climbed a barn roof in his shtetl in Poland to hurl stones into space, in the hope of challenging the God he was certain waited behind the ''trapdoor'' in the sky. This first volume of the autobiographical trilogy ''All Our Yesterdays,'' by a prominent intellectual, novelist and philosopher (and a self-described ''old revolutionary''), is an uneven but earnest account of the education of a religious rebel, the evolution of a man from devout Jew to faithful skeptic. Ably translated from the German, the book concentrates on Sperber's youth, spent in eastern Galicia. The grinding poverty of the time is here, as well as the specter of anti-Semitism and his life in the heder, the classroom where he learned to speak Hebrew by the age of 4. Sperber digresses often and with relish, moving from the literal anecdote to the expansive metaphor and back again. We are party not only to historical events but also to a wealth of personal recollections. As a diary of an education in skepticism, ''God's Water Carriers'' is disjointed, refusing to hew to a chronological narrative line. But as a chronicle of one of the century's more formidable intellects, the book is an enlightening work and a mirror of values - those of a man who, despite having arms too short to box with God, nevertheless rose to the challenge.",1988-02-07T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"LOVING LITTLE EGYPT, by Thomas McMahon. (Penguin, $6.95.) In the early days of electrical power, Thomas Alva Edison fought with Nikola Tesla over whether direct current or alternating current would be the wave of the future. In this novel by Thomas McMahon, a Harvard science professor, Edison and Tesla are on opposite sides again, in a dispute over an electronics wizard who creates a secret underground telephone network for the blind. While the characters in the story are rather mechanical, Evelyn Toynton said here in 1987, ''in the descriptions of circuit switching [ and ] the exhilaration attendant on scientific discovery . . . Mr. McMahon's lyricism comes to the fore.'' THE FATAL SHORE, by Robert Hughes. (Vintage, $10.95.) Britain's decision in the late 18th century to pun-ish criminals by exiling them to the far side of the planet led to the establishment of Australia, a country whose citizens, Robert Hughes says, developed a deeply ingrained suspicion of authority. Mr. Hughes, an art critic for Time magazine and the author of ''The Shock of the New,'' was born and educated in Sydney. He ''tells his vast story with his accustomed elegance and all his usual gift for making resounding historical and cultural connections,'' Thomas Keneally said here last year. THE FLAGELLANTS, by Carlene Hatcher Polite. (Beacon, $7.95.) In Carlene Hatcher Polite's classic novel of a black couple's disintegrating relationship, the flagellants (who assault each other both mentally and physically) are Jimson, an aspiring poet, and Ideal, who comes from a poor community in the South. In their continuing dialogue, the characters ''brilliantly and bitterly tear off layer after layer of rationalization and myth,'' one reviewer said in 1967. ''Novels so ambitious almost always fail. . . . 'The Flagellants' succeeds.'' BRIBES, by John T. Noonan Jr. (University of California, $14.95.) John T. Noonan Jr.'s erudite study of bribery traces such chicanery to early practitioners like Simon Magus and includes such contemporary examples as the Abscam scandal and Watergate. ''Mr. Noonan is a fine writer and a shrewd moralist,'' D. J. R. Bruckner said in The Times in 1984. ''There is scarcely a page in this huge book that does not raise an interesting question or make one redefine one's notions of the morality of public conduct.'' THE TRAVELER, by John Katzenbach. (Ballantine, $4.95.) By slaying an innocent family, an experienced murderer hopes to become immortalized in the serial killers' hall of fame. In 1987, our reviewer, Patrick Anderson, said that while the novel ''has some of the qualities of a best seller,'' it is also ''a serious statement . . . about a society that nurtures and in some ways - with biographies, television movies and journalistic frenzy -encourages its madmen.'' JOHNSON V. JOHNSON, by Barbara Goldsmith. (Dell, $4.95.) The fight by the children of J. Seward Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune, over his $500 million estate was as bitter and sordid as their oppressive family life. Though the author ''often allows her tape recorder to show,'' Herbert Mitgang said in The Times last year, she has put together ''a lively tale.'' HOME FIRES BURNING, by Robert Inman. (Ballantine, $4.95.) A tiresome newspaper editor's homespun wisdom annoys the residents of his small Southern community and might put off some readers as well, Tom Wicker said here in 1987. Nevertheless, the novel ''has stretches of real narrative skill, and its weighty way largely succeeds in causing the reader to care about a town and its people and a way of life.'' THINKING IN TIME: The Uses of History for Decision-Makers, by Richard E. Neustadt and Ernest R. May. (Free Press, $9.95.) The lessons of history, a seemingly obvious ingredient in government decision making, are often distorted or ignored, two Harvard University professors demonstrate. In 1986, James Chace said here that while the authors ''often lapse into dreadful jargon,'' the book is filled with ''rich [ and ] fascinating'' case studies. STRANGERS IN PARADISE, by Lee K. Abbott. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) Though some of these stories are set in Vietnam, they are all about citizens of the desert metropolis of Deming, N.M. ''Plots tend to overlap, a peculiarity that often becomes a virtue,'' William Ferguson said here in 1987. ''It is as if several fields of force were being directed at a single invisible core of meaning, in a prose at once exuberant and inventive.'' CELEBRATING BIRD: The Triumph of Charlie Parker, by Gary Giddins. (Beech Tree/Morrow, $9.95.) When this biography of the jazz saxophonist Charlie (Yardbird) Parker was published last year, our reviewer, Jason Berry, called it ''an elegant, incisive essay. . . . It is as penetrating a character study of Bird as any yet written.'' MISSION TO CIVILIZE: The French Way, by Mort Rosenblum. (Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95.) Even after the loss of its empire, Mort Rosenblum believes, France continues to act like an imperial nation subtly bestowing its civilization on a needy world. In 1986, The Times's John Gross called the book ''an illuminating and extremely useful guide.'' CONTINENT, by Jim Crace. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) A wonderful new force called electricity causes strange cultural ripples when it is bestowed on the primitive inhabitants of Jim Crace's imaginary land. ''This brilliant, provocative and delightful book shows us why progress must prevail, but it also shows us the terrible price that must be paid,'' Robert Olen Butler said in The Book Review last year.",1988-02-07T05:00:00+0000

Meanwhile, cleaning the five-story structure, built in 1867 as a dry-goods store, was not easy. Since landmark law prohibits the use of high-pressure hoses or chemicals on historic facades, the scrubbing was done by ''men up there with little brushes in their hands, like toothbrushes,'' he said.",1988-02-07T05:00:00+0000
us,Wright Seen Anew as an Architect of Thoughts,"In the 28 years since Frank Lloyd Wright's death, his associates, who have tried to keep the flame of his reputation burning, have often done more to damage his name than to enhance it.

Charles, coming off a Seniors victory in South Africa, was nearly flawless in posting an opening round of eight birdies and no bogeys on the par 72, 6,530-yard Champion course at PGA National. Arnold Palmer holds the course and tournament record of nine-under-par 63, set in 1984. ''It was one of those days where everything went right,'' the 51-year-old left-hander said. Gary Player, Al Geiberger, Larry Mowry, Tommy Aaron, Harold Henning, Orville Moody and George Lanning were at 69.(AP) Neumann Ahead by Four Shots: Liselotte Neumann of Sweden fired an eight-under-par 64 to take a four-stroke lead after yesterday's first round of the $225,000 Sarasota Classic. Beth Daniel and Jan Stephenson shared second place with 68s. Nancy Lopez, the defending champion and winner of last week's Mazda Classic, shot one-over 73, making a birdie and two bogies. Neumann, 21, had six birdies and an eagle on the 349-yard 15th hole when she sank a 144-yard second shot with a 7-iron. Donna Caponi made a hole-in-one on the 178-yard 12th hole at Bent Tree Country Club, the second ace of her 23-year L.P.G.A. career.(AP) Mudd Shares Lead: Jodie Mudd twice holed from off the green in a six-under-par 66 that gave him a share of the first-round lead with Richard Zokol of Canada yesterday in the $600,000 Hawaiian Open in Honolulu. Mudd, who hasn't been a winner in seven seasons on the PGA Tour, said he was lucky and added, ''I chipped in once, holed a bunker shot and made a couple of 50 footers.'' He had seven birdies, an eagle and three bogeys. The United States Open champion, Scott Simpson, who played without a bogey on the Waialae Country Club course, and Brad Bryant were a shot back at 67. (AP) N.B.A. 76ers 119, Bucks 113: Charles Barkley scored 46 points as Philadelphia beat the visiting Milwaukee Bucks in overtime last night, giving Jim Lynam his first victory as the 76er coach. Barkley's driving basket gave Philadelphia a 112-110 lead with 2:01 left in overtime, but Ricky Pierce tied it on a short jumper with 1:09 remaining. Philadelphia regained the lead on a layup by Gerald Henderson with 47 seconds left and Barkley added three free throws and a dunk at the buzzer to finish the scoring.(AP) Tennis Navratilova Rallies Back: Top-seeded Martina Navratilova, trailing by 2-4 in the first set, rallied to a 6-4, 6-2, third-round victory over Larisa Savchenko of the Soviet Union yesterday in the $250,000 Virginia Slims of Dallas. Savchenko's serve-and-volley game and unpredictable tactics confounded Navratilova early in the match. ''She made some crazy shots, shots you wouldn't normally try in certain situations,'' Navratilova said. Savchenko, 21 years old, is one of six Soviet women competing this winter on the Virginia Slims tour in preparation for Olympic competition.

Stars are followed by the date of original publication; restaurants reviewed in Diner's Journal do not have stars. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. CHELSEA TRATTORIA ITALIANA, 108 Eighth Avenue, near 16th Street (924-7786) - **(Aug. 7, 1987) The brick and whitewashed dining room is tidy and calm at this friendly and easygoing restaurant that serves some stellar pastas. The menu is notable for the chef's pure and understated approach. The pasta options include agnolotti stuffed with ricotta cheese and spinach with pesto sauce; fettuccine with wild mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes; tagliolini with a tomato-based arrabbiata sauce spiked with garlic and hot green peppers; whole-wheat pasta with raw tomato sauce and basil, and fettuccine with fresh vegetables. Pastas: $11 to $14. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5 P.M. to midnight; Saturdays, 5 P.M. to midnight; closed Sundays. POSITANO, 250 Park Avenue South, at 20th Street (777-6211) - **(Jan. 25, 1985) A three-tiered dining area with green marble tables and high-toned Italian design provides the backdrop for some superior pastas at this bustling and informal restaurant. The menu features cappellini putanesca, which is thin pasta with a sauce of tomatoes, olives and capers; cheese ravioli with tomatoes and cream sauce; radiator-shaped pastas with homemade sausage and cream sauce, and farfalle, a bow-tie pasta, with broccoli, sun-dried tomatoes, black olives, garlic and olive oil. Pastas: $13.50 to $14. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M.; Saturdays, 5:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M.; closed Sundays. REMI, 323 East 79th Street (744-4272) - **(Nov. 13, 1987) This new East Side restaurant combines a striking setting, attentive service and distinctive food. The dining room is peach-toned with indirect lighting from ceiling beams, and gondola oars crisscrossed overhead. Some of the best pastas in town can be found on the changing menu. Among the specials are macaroni with duck breast, tomato and rosemary; farfalle tossed with mixed vegetables and shiitake mushrooms; small shells in a sauce with fresh fennel and sweet sausage, and fusilli tossed with cubes of smoked bacon and grilled radicchio in a light cream sauce. Pastas: $15. Fridays and Saturdays, 6 to 11 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 3 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M. TOSCANA RISTORANTE, 200 East 54th Street (371-8144) - **(Sept. 4, 1987) A dynamic spot worth visiting both for its evocative design and for the food is this Tuscan-style Italian veteran that moved into new quarters last year. The ultra-stylish modern decor is reminiscent of a luxury liner. Several of the pastas excel. If it's available, try the special of taglierini smothered in a voluptuous lamb ragout. Other good options are thin cheese-filled ravioli with zucchini flowers, baby zucchini and diced vegetables in a clear broth. Fettuccine with shrimp and radicchio in a smoky tomato sauce; angel-hair pasta, a special, tossed with eggplant, tomato, fresh basil and little cubes of mozzarella, and green fettuccine with scallops and spinach. Pastas: $18. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5:30 to 10:30 P.M.; Saturdays, 5:30 to 10:30 P.M.; closed Sundays. What the stars mean, page C24.",1988-02-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"NEWS SUMMARY: SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1988","INTERNATIONAL 2-6, 28 Two Soviet Navy vessels bumped two United States warships in the Black Sea as the American vessels sailed through waters claimed by the Soviet Union, prompting a diplomatic protest from the Reagan Administration. Page 1 Evidence of drug trafficking by the Panamanian leader appears to have been overlooked by the Drug Enforcement Administration in exchange for Panama's help in investigating other drug cases, officials said. 1 A Panamanian diplomat resigned, saying he could no longer work for a regime ''characterized by corruption.'' The diplomat was Lawrence Chewning Fabrega, Panama's minister-counselor to the Organization of American States. 5 A rift in Israel's governing coalition intensified as Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir angrily accused Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of trying to ''sabotage'' his attempts at peace in the occupied territories. 1 In Rome, a Palestinian gunman was sentenced to a 30-year prison term for his part in the Rome airport attack in 1985 in which 16 people were killed. Two others were sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment as organizers of the attack. 3 Members of a French terrorist group were sentenced to 10 years each in prison for criminal conspiracy. They were members of the group Direct Action, which has claimed responsibility for a series of bombings and shootings in France. 3 News analysis: Moscow's proposal for a withdrawal from Afghanistan has led to negotiations about the wisdom of demanding that a coalition government be established before an agreement is signed. 6 The 12-nation European Community reached a laboriously negotiated agreement at an emergency summit meeting that will permit a major overhaul of its finances and ease the transition to a barrier-free market by 1992. 3 A U.S.-Mexican Presidential meeting will be held today in Mazatlan, Mexico, at a time when relations between the United States and Mexico are smoother than at any time since the two leaders took office. 5 Sakaide journal: A bridge is a two-way street. 4 NATIONAL 7-9, 33-34 The U.S trade deficit narrowed by $1 billion in December, to $12.2 billion, the lowest level in 11 months, the Commerce Department reported. The improvement consolidated the much larger November gain. 1 Prices at the producer level rose a surprising four-tenths of 1 percent in January, as higher food costs offset declines in energy prices, the Labor Department said. It was the steepest monthly rise since September. 37 Victor Posner struck a deal with a Federal District Court judge after pleading no contest to tax evasion charges. To keep out of jail, the financier agreed to spend $3 million for the homeless and to put in 5,000 hours of community work. 1 Pat Robertson's Southern supporters are out in force, well drilled and intensely committed. Partly because of their organization, Vice President Bush's lead in the South no longer seems comfortable. 1 Alexander Haig ended his campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination four days before the New Hampshire primary. Mr. Haig endorsed Senator Bob Dole, saying Mr. Dole ''is head and shoulders above George Bush.'' 9 Unsecured political loans were made to Representative Richard A. Gephardt's Presidential campaign and political action committee. The loans came from two banks whose top officers hold key positions on Mr. Gephardt's campaign. 8 Senator Paul Simon stresses party orthodoxy 8 The blue-collar vote may be crucial in New Hampshire 8 Jack Kemp charges he has been the victim of a smear campaign 9 The F.B.I.'s sweeping investigation of a group opposed to United States policy in Central America was largely fueled by a Salvadoran evangelist turned undercover informer who has admitted that he invented much of his information. 33 A doctor who built a medical school into one of the top academic medical schools is retiring.

Morris Gross was ordered by a court to spend 15 days living in the building after he was convicted of failing to correct almost 400 building code violations. 1 An escaped prisoner was arrested by the F.B.I. David James Roberts, an escapee from Indiana State Penitentiary, had worked under an assumed name in homeless shelters and soup kitchens on Staten Island. 29 Mayor Koch canceled a trip to Rio, where he was to have been the guest of honor at Carnival. With his last-minute cancellation, Mr. Koch has stepped on a lot of important toes. ''He left us in a very difficult spot,'' one official said. 29 Winners of a lottery for housing qualified to buy one of 300 condominium units ranging from the mid-$90,000 to $160,000. in Mahwah, N.J., a wooded and mountainous community in northern Bergen County. 31 Officials of The New York Post and the leaders of its 10 unions will meet Monday to discuss $24 million in cost cuts that Rupert Murdoch calls mandatory if the paper is to be sold and not closed next Friday. 31 An Adirondack town's postmaster works out of an office adjacent to her living room.

Most writers know something about their motives, though few are as impassioned - or as expansive - as Reynolds Price is in sharing them. Indeed, in many of these 57 essays by the acclaimed author of ''Kate Vaiden'' and other novels, the treacherous business of examining artistic intent - in his own writing as well as in others' - is managed with considerable grace. By turns thoughtful, ornery, eloquent, long-winded and wise, Mr. Price reflects on the work of artists as celebrated as Henry James and Eudora Welty and as little known as the American Indian author James Welch. Some of the selections are less successful than others. Only the persistent will want to wade through Mr. Price's long, pedantic essay on Milton's ''Samson Agonistes'' or a piece about his memories of the first book of Bible stories he received, at the age of 2. Likewise, Mr. Price's tone when discussing certain recurring themes - the Eastern literary establishment's preference for urban novels, the critical deflation of Hemingway, the indiscriminate praise heaped on Faulkner -tends, at times, to sound more chastising than critical. But these are quibbles. In the most discerning and incisive essays, Mr. Price ruminates on our shared need for heroes, the impulse to create, the significance of the word ''home'' and the mysterious ways in which personal history and collective myth combine in the making of art. The picture that emerges from this large collection is of a writer whose deepest concern is not only the telling of stories, but the hearing of them too.",1988-02-14T05:00:00+0000

This personal memoir, the latest volume in the MIT Press's History of Computing series, recalls the early days of the electronic computer industry, when machines with the capacity of today's miniature computers were ''a little larger than a single car garage.'' David E. Lundstrom, a retired electrical engineer who has worked for the Univac division of the Sperry Rand Corporation as well as the Control Data Corporation, offers an account of what he calls a ''narrow but typical slice'' of 30 years of computer history, introducing us to some of the personalities and back-room machinations that shaped this most volatile of industries. As a cautionary tale for executives, this book is valuable. The author astutely demonstrates how computer design is affected (that is, hindered) by such nonengineering problems as management egotism and administrative ineptitude, and he makes a convincing case for granting greater freedom to the innovative designers (those ''few good men from Univac'') who have tried to keep the industry on the fast track. But as a portrait of a lively and exciting business, the book does not succeed. Mr. Lundstrom's narrative skills are lackluster, and are enough to try the patience of even the most avid computerphile.",1988-02-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"ART, AFTER A FASHION","When Diana Vreeland began staging her dynamic costume exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art 15 years ago, she not only narrowed the gap between fashion and art but also enhanced the perception of clothing as a field for serious study. Art museums all over this country and in Europe followed with their own fashion exhibitions, and books examining the sociological and cultural implications of clothing proliferated. This beautifully designed and printed volume is one of the best. With a text by the stage designer Zhou Xun and her assistant Gao Chunming, 5000 YEARS OF CHINESE COSTUMES (China Books and Periodicals, $49.95) intersperses delicate sketches of clothing with the paintings and sculpture from which they were derived. Edited by the Chinese Costumes Research Group of the Shanghai School of Traditional Operas, it is both art book and fashion history, starting with the animal skins and shell ornaments worn before the invention of fabrics and ending with contemporary cotton clothes. Even in the early eras, the colors were subtle and the patterns intricate. After all, the Chinese invented silk and learned how to handle it. The basic shape was the wraparound robe, but over the millenniums there were plenty of variations. Dramatic fashion changes were not invented in the modern era - they are part of the human condition. So are aberrations like the binding of women's feet, which became fashionable in the Sung dynasty (A.D. 960 to 1279). In looking at headdresses, purses, fans and changes in hairstyle for both men and women, the book offers other interesting insights into the development of fashion, Oriental style.",1988-02-14T05:00:00+0000

However, in his concluding remarks, he obscures what is at issue by turning the problem in upon himself. A pastor's poverty or relative poverty is useful in biblical terms only if it has symbolic import: effectively positing the need for an otherwordly ethic in a too worldly society. But we have crossed over a threshold that has rendered such symbolic poverty nonsensical. We no longer blush at even the most outrageously conspicuous consumption. Is it any wonder that the televised gospel of wealth is having a field day, while, when it comes to remuneration, the local pastor is considered at best an unfocused underachiever, and at worst a chump?

Wrap a subway map around this academic book and you have one of the most useful and up-to-date guides to New York City in years. ''New Immigrants in New York'' takes eight recently arrived groups - Dominicans, Haitians, St. Vincentians, Grenadians, Jamaicans, Koreans, Chinese and Soviet Jews - and shows the impact the city has had on them and the impact they have had on the city. For example, we learn that Jamaican women are much more likely to work in New York than they were back home, a fact that has altered the city's garment industry as well as relations between the sexes in the immigrants' new homes. Almost any observer of New York has noticed that Koreans have become the new merchant class, fixing up shops throughout the city. Here we learn that most of these new shopkeepers were professionals in South Korea and that they have filled a vacuum created by Jewish and Italian merchants whose children did not want to follow them into business. The book was written by nine scholars who know how to present their research in a readable and informative fashion, replete with engaging anecdotes and helpful statistics. As editor of this volume, Nancy Foner (a professor of anthropology at the State University of New York, Purchase, and author of the chapter on the Jamaicans) deserves considerable credit for keeping her writers true to their assignments.

In addition to increasing familiarity with steam air conditioning, the program will cut its original cost, said Patricia A. Valente, manager of space conditioning marketing.

The one with the most cars is Dan Dooley Rent-a-Car (800-331-9301 or, in New Jersey, 201-381-8948). It has outlets in downtown Dublin, the Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports and at the ferry ports. Dooley sets no top age limit.

But some on the staff lobbied for other candidates, noting that while the Modern is a museum of 20th century art, Mr. Varnedoe's main interest has been in 19th century works.

By the time we were west of Byron Bay, the iron-gray wedge of cloud had lifted to let the sun cast its warm, early evening light across the undulating grasslands to the flat brown marshes and pale dunes on the ocean's edge. Cape Byron was a distant grass-covered dome surmounted by a white lighthouse. Shafts of sunlight caught the rainfall evaporating from its rocky ledges and the salt-laden spray blowing in from the sea to form a bright rainbow that bridged the shores of the Cape and the patchwork of colored rooftops to the west of it.",1988-02-14T05:00:00+0000

The victory, the Canucks' third in their last 11 games, snapped a six-game Boston winning streak. The Bruins had a 5-3 lead before Garth Butcher scored at 17:49 of the second period. Petri Skriko then set up the defenseman Jim Benning to tie the score at 10:13 of the third period with a short-handed goal.(AP) Whalers 4, Canadiens 1: Lindsay Carson broke a second-period tie to help extend the Canadiens' longest losing streak to the season to four games at Montreal.

Her headdress can be simple or elaborate. She might opt for an elegant suit with a midi-length hemline, balanced by a wide-brimmed hat. She will not, however, wear pants.

Just as ''Bridge'' prepared to end its sold-out West End run Feb. 20, it was joined by major and revelatory new productions of Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' at the National and Eugene O'Neill's ''Touch of the Poet'' at the Young Vic. All three plays occupy second-best positions in their authors' canons, but to see them in tandem -with actors like Mr. Gambon, Ian Charleson, Vanessa Redgrave and Timothy Dalton - is to remember that our classic theater boasts a depth and continuity that our scattered diet of New York revivals rarely allows us to savor.",1988-02-16T05:00:00+0000

Swanilda, the pertly willful young heroine, was the center of the ballet despite the dramatic potential inherent in the character of Coppelius, the mad old toymaker who mistakes Swanilda for a suddenly living doll. The focus is very much on Swanilda in the New York City Ballet's happy, breezy production of the 1870 French ballet, choreographed by George Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova to the traditional score by Leo Delibes. But the balance shifted on Sunday night, when City Ballet performed ''Coppelia'' at the New York State Theater.

Using a wide-open offense that averages 109 points a game, Loyola Marymount of California, with a 20-3 record, ranked 20th this week in making its first appearance ever in The Associated Press college basketball poll. The head coach is Paul Westhead, the same coach who was dismissed by the Los Angeles Lakers 11 games into the 1981-82 season after Earvin (Magic) Johnson complained publicly that Westhead's offense was slow and stodgy. Westhead, now in his third season at Loyola, said he feels no bitterness about his abrupt departure from the Lakers, nor toward Johnson. He seems amused, however, that he was let go because his approach to offense wasn't considered wide-open enough. ''My coaching methods have always been the same, the running game, shoot within seven seconds,'' said Westhead, whose team has won 17 straight games and is the National Collegiate Athletic Association's highest-scoring club. ''Sometimes, for a variety of reasons, people can maybe see things differently. First and foremost, I'm a running coach.

Wilson, who has 17 goals for the season, including 8 in 14 games since being acquired last Jan. 3, scored both his goals on deflections. His game-winner came at 7 minutes 46 seconds of the third period as Wilson, in the slot, tipped in a low shot from the left circle by Ron Francis. (AP) Kings 5, North Stars 4: Luc Robitaille and Bob Carpenter scored 53 seconds apart late in the third period, rallying the Kings at Bloomington, Minn. Robitaille tied at 4-4 at 16:24 on a rebound for his 37th goal. He then set up Carpenter for his 17th goal at 17:17 in front of the net. (AP) Canadiens 3, Bruins 2: Mike McPhee scored winning goal from a goal-mouth scramble with 1:35 to play as Montreal snapped a five-game losing streak. With the puck in a swarm of players near the net, McPhee whirled to his backhand at the side of the crease and tucked the puck past Rejean Lemelin for his 18th goal. (AP) Red Wings 4, Blackhawks 3: Shawn Burr's short wrist shot midway through the third period snapped a final tie at Chicago. Burr fought off a check from the defenseman Dave Manson and scored his 11th goal of the season with 8:42 to play, giving the Red Wings their sixth victory in seven games and moving them 11 points ahead of second-place St. Louis in the Norris Division. Chicago, which had a four-game unbeaten streak snapped, tied the score at 6:53 of the third period. (AP) N.B.A. Cavaliers 115, 76ers 107: Mark Price scored 28 points and Tyrone Corbin made a key defensive play late in the game to help send Philadelphia to its third consecutive loss and 11th in the last 14 games. The Sixers are 1-4 under their new coach, Jim Lynam. Cleveland, which has only eight road victories, two more than all of last season, led by 107-103 on a layup by Brad Daugherty with 2:19 remaining, but Albert King's 3-point shot put the 76ers a point behind with 2:11 to play. After Mark West and Ben Coleman of Philadelphia exchanged field goals, the 76ers had a chance to take the lead with just over a minute to play, but Corbin stripped Charles Barkley of the ball.(AP) Mavericks 123, Bullets 108: Mark Aguirre scored 15 of his game-high 35 points in the first quarter, boosting Dallas to an early 20-point lead. The Mavericks made their first eight shots of the game and shot 69 percent from the field in the opening period. John Williams scored 22 points and Jeff Malone 18 for the Bullets, who lost for the seventh time in their last eight games. (AP) Bucks 115, SuperSonics 93: Terry Cummings scored 20 points and the Bucks started the fourth period with a 21-5 spurt. Seattle, which lost for the eighth time in the last nine games, has not beaten the Bucks in Milwaukee since the 1982-83 season. The Sonics were led by Dale Ellis, who scored 26 points. Nate McMillan, averaging 8.3 assists a game, had 10 of Seattle's 14 in the first half and finished with 13.(AP) Nuggets 138, Celtics 125: Alex English matched his season high with 37 points and Blair Rasmussen scored a career-high 34 as the Nuggets swept the two-game season series from the Celtics for the first time. The Nuggets took control with an 18-4 spurt in the second quarter during which Rasmussen scored 10 points. He also collided with Larry Bird and broke Bird's nose. Bird, averaging 39.2 points since the All-Star Game break, scored only 13 and played only 6 minutes in the second half. The Celtics were led by Kevin McHale's 33 points.

us,Q&A,"Q. The cedar shingles on our 60-year-old home were originally stained, then painted several times. The paint is peeling, and I would like to go back to stain. Can the shingles be sandblasted professionally and then stained? A. The paint can be removed by sandblasting, but this could damage the shingles if not done carefully. As a rule, having the paint removed by using chemicals and pressure-washing is usually safer and more effective, but this, too, must be done carefully by an experienced contractor. After the paint is removed, the shingles can be stained. Q. We recently had our oak floors sanded and refinished with polyurethane. The company that did the job advised me not to wax or polish the floors, just damp mop occasionally. However, a friend who had her floors finished the same way 15 years ago has used polish on her floors and they still look like new. Who is right? A. I agree with your friend, and the condition of her floors proves it. Polyurethane is a tough finish that does not scratch easily, and many companies say that waxing is not necessary or even advisable. But in my experience occasional waxing or polishing does help to preserve the finish and maintain the gloss, and it certainly does not hurt. Q. A brown toilet shows white stains, although there is no such problem with my white toilets. I have tried many cleaners on these stains, but nothing helps. Can you help? A. It sounds as if water with a high mineral content is leaving the streaks. You cannot see them in the white bowls, because the stains are white. Usually, scrubbing with a toilet-bowl cleaner (let it soak on the stain first) or with a product like Limeaway will get rid of these streaks. If this does not work, scrub with Zud, a strong cleaner sold in supermarkets and hardware stores. The stains will probably come back in time; for a permanent cure you may have to install a water conditioner. Q. I painted the trim around my front door a year ago. It is now peeling and the wood under the paint is wet, almost soft. Is there any way to dry the wood sufficiently so that I can paint it again? A. You probably have some rot in that wood, as well as dampness, or it would not be soft. The bottom of the wood should not touch the ground, and there should be caulking around the trim that keeps water from seeping in behind it.",1988-02-18T05:00:00+0000

Marshall's parents have denied any knowledge about their son's involvement with drugs, including his arrest last year as a juvenile on a charge of possession with intent to distribute cocaine.

us,"Dining Out Guide: 3-Star French, Part 1","This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. The date of original publication is listed after the phone number. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. AURORA, 60 East 49th Street (692-9292) - (Jan. 31, 1986) Well-spaced tables and comfortable chairs and banquettes contribute to the luxurious atmosphere of this midtown restaurant. Burnished-wood wainscoting and muted colors play against a lighthearted bubble theme on plates, windows, overhead lights and even the waiters' jackets. And the food can soar as high as bubbles on a windy day. You might start with terrine of foie gras with truffle ice cream; cassolette of squid and black pasta, or warm oysters and spinach with saffron and caviar sauce. Entree options include poached lobster with ginger, lime and Sauternes; veal chop with prosciutto julienne and pepper-mustard sauce, and napoleon of salmon with a smoked salmon and caviar sauce and crisp potato. Desserts rarely disappoint. Pre-theater $37.50; dinner entrees $31 to $37.50. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 5:30 to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 5:30 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. LA COTE BASQUE, 5 East 55th Street (688-6525) - (Aug. 22, 1986) Habitues of this classic French restaurant look for comfort, cosseting and food they can really get their teeth into - and that is what they get. The wraparound dining room exudes a timeless glamour with its murals of coastal France, red leather banquettes and splendid flower clusters. The cooking style is characterized by reduced sauces, lavish presentations and prodigious portions. Recommended appetizers are puff pastry with scallops in a fish-stock-and-cream sauce with Sauternes; fresh foie gras with shiitake mushrooms and veal-stock sauce, and lobster terrine. Entrees follow classic French cooking from a lusty steak au poivre and roast duck with puffed crisp skin and a pepper sauce to stuffed quails in pastry crust with truffle sauce and sweetbreads in a veal-stock sauce touched with Madeira. Dinner prix fixe $48. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 10:30 P.M.; Saturdays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. LA RESERVE, 4 West 49th Street (247-2993) - (June 28, 1985) The two elegant dining rooms at this Rockefeller Center restaurant are enchanting, with beige- and peach-colored banquettes, high ceiling, giant paintings of birds in marshlands and soft lighting. The cooking orientation is strongly classical with a light touch. You might start with warm lobster and asparagus flan garnished with lobster morsels and tangy watercress sauce; fresh foie gras sauteed with Madeira or port wine, and a special seafood charlotte of silky sole mousse filled with pieces of scallops, shrimp, tomato and mushroom with a beurre blanc sauce. Fish dishes, focused and straightforward, include the grilled fillet of red mullet with clove sauce, and poached salmon with beurre blanc sauce touched with coriander. Other entree options are roast duck with ginger sauce, and sauteed noisettes of venison with five spices. Desserts are copious and ever changing. Dinner prix fixe, pre-theater $36, after 7 P.M. $48. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5:30 to 11 P.M.: Saturdays, 5:30 to 11 P.M. LA TULIPE, 104 West 13th Street (691-8860) - (March 1, 1985) This is a charming and intimate little restaurant with a Parisian-style bar up front, chocolate-colored walls and graceful tulip sconces. The kitchen offers a small seasonal menu. To start, you might choose layered eggplant terrine, blini with three caviars, or oxtail consomme. The entrees are nearly always well conceived, stressing flavor over flashiness. Selections include grilled boned squab with braised cabbage and vegetable batons; sauteed fillet of venison with prunes and celery puree; grilled tournedos of beef with home-cured prosciutto with scallions and potato galette, and red snapper cooked in parchment with herbs and vegetables. La Tulipe is dessert heaven, and one option is a terrine of ice cream and glazed fruit from Nice with toasted almonds. Prix fixe dinner $59. Fridays to Sundays, 6:30 to 10 P.M. LE CYGNE, 55 East 54th Street (759-5941) - (April 18, 1986) This excellent French restaurant, in a two-story town house with two small dining rooms on both levels, is one of those discreet institutions that hum along from year to year at a steady pace. Appetizers are uniformly wonderful: succulent little scallops from Maine in lime-accented fish stock with julienne of endive; a sparkling salmon terrine in aspic, and smooth pheasant or duck terrine. Among the entrees are sauteed fillet of snapper with tomato and basil sauce; fresh broiled salmon with mousseline of fresh herbs, and roast squab in a melange of cloves, cepes and artichokes. The frogs' legs, simply prepared in garlic and butter, are some of the best in New York. Dinner prix fixe $56. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 10 P.M.; Saturdays, 5:30 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays.

John Paul II's ''Sollicitudo Rei Socialis'' will keep the theologians very busy during the next week. 5 Failure to control drug trafficking in Panama and Mexico should not be penalized by the United States, a Government report concluded. The countries are still eligible for aid, the report said. 1 A kidnapped U.S. Marine officer is being held by a clandestine group believed to be made up of pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalists. The group accused the officer, Lieut. Col. William R. Higgins, of being a C.I.A. agent. 1 A bomb exploded in Africa killing at least 14 people and wounding more than 30 in South Africa, known as Namibia.

His emphasis is on political and economic continuity. 28 Caraguatay journal: People leave and the dollars arrive 5 NATIONAL 7-10, 50 Economic growth is less robust than it could be, because of past Federal Reserve policy and the October stock market rout, the Administration said in its annual economic report. The criticism of the central bank was the harshest that the Administration has made recently. 1 A top Wall Street speculator was arraigned on charges of illegal possession of a gun that prosecutors said he planned to use to kill Ivan F. Boesky. The accused man, John A. Mulheren, has been under investigation for the past year. 1 Economists in this year's campaign are playing a smaller advisory role than they did in the past. One reason seems to be that a view of economists as seers and problem solvers has diminished. Another reason is the economy itself. 1 Biotechnology research programs are being supported by state governments more than ever before, according to industry analysts and state officials. States are likely to spend $150 million this year on the industry. 7 Jesse Jackson campaigned at home this week, seeking votes from Southerners who find the promises of the New South unfulfilled.

us,FICTION,"THE DARK PATH TO THE RIVER. By Joanne Leedom-Ackerman. (Saybrook/Norton, $19.95.) Joanne Leedom-Ackerman's first novel is a densely plotted, dialogue-filled story that reads like commercial fiction yet examines unconventional territory. Frequently shifting points of view, the book focuses on the fates of two American friends and former newspaper colleagues who are united in their interest in a small, unnamed African country on the brink of revolution. Olivia, a black freelance journalist, has spent years living in Africa and is familiar with the leaders and aims of the National Liberation Association (N.L.A.), a group wishing to free the country from the corrupt excesses of its self-proclaimed president-for-life. Jenny, a white writer at work on a book about African women, is less attuned to the nation's internal problems but has a personal reason for her concern: her husband's investment company has financed a mining operation that may be manipulating both sides of the political struggle. Neither woman has yet reached her potential as a writer, and Ms. Leedom-Ackerman shows how their preoccupation with the country's crisis also liberates them professionally. She is particularly successful in building suspense throughout Olivia's search in New York City for two vanished N.L.A. leaders. Unfortunately, the author has also weighed down ''The Dark Path to the River'' with a lengthy subplot involving Jenny's attempt to extricate her maddeningly naive husband not only from the clutches of unscrupulous businessmen but also from another woman. Ms. Leedom-Ackerman concludes with too many simple solutions and loose ends. However, her writing is often sensitive and ambitious enough to keep the reader interested in both the political and personal spheres she explores.",1988-02-21T05:00:00+0000

us,PARIS CREATES,"Some seasons, the Paris couture is everything it is supposed to be - and more. This spring is certainly one of those. The collections shown last month not only had plenty of clothes for the couture clientele to choose from, but, even more importantly, they were loaded with multiple messages for the fashion community at large. The use of several strong colors in one costume, the sometimes mad mix of flower patterns and stripes, the plethora of polka dots, the penchant for lace and the return to fluttery tulle for fairy-tale ball gowns - all were among the suggestive fabrications. Though general silhouettes remained unchanged - short skirts and fairly close-fitted shapes being the norm - there were some interesting variations, the most notable being skirts that belled or swelled from slightly heightened waistlines. There were a few shapes that forecast new directions. Three pencil-slim, midi-length costumes balanced on top by wide-brimmed hats designed by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel were radically different from anything in the rest of his collection, or, for that matter, elsewhere in Paris. Though obviously not easy to wear - a woman would have to be trimmer than trim and as chic as all get-out to carry them - they are bound to stimulate other designers into new slinky thinking. The high-waisted soft pants of Christian Lacroix should do likewise. And Yves Saint Laurent's intriguing mixes of color - his crossing of several seemingly discordant shades of blue with just an accent of acid green in one daytime costume, for instance - is sure to tempt others to try to follow suit. Accessories and embroideries were full of invention, from Saint Lau-rent's reincarnation of famous paintings in sequins (executed by Lesage) to Eman-uel Ungaro's plastic roses glazed like cheap candy but nonetheless curi-ously desirable. Saint Laurent is bring-ing back the evening cape. But it is the su-perb jackets that Christian Lacroix concocted that will stir the imagina-tions of many a fashion fan.",1988-02-21T05:00:00+0000
us,"In Britain, Many In the Arts Say Profit and Loss Has Replaced Beauty and Truth","After more than eight years, Britain's artists, actors and writers show few signs of being won over by Margaret Thatcher. Some of their deep-seated animosity toward her recently surfaced publicly as a cultural debate. A few weeks ago The Sunday Telegraph ran a prominent article that asked the question: Why do the intelligentsia hate her so much? In reply, Jonathan Miller, the stage and film director, cited the Prime Minister's ''odious suburban gentility and sentimental, saccharine patriotism,'' which, in his view, cater to the ''worst elements of commuter idiocy.'' Writing in The Guardian, Hanif Kureishi, the author of the screenplays for ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ''Sammy and Rosie Get Laid,'' described Mrs. Thatcher's Britain as 'a narrow-minded, authoritarian rat hole.'' Artists of every persuasion have accused the Government of philistinism because of its desire to reduce its role in subsidizing the arts and expand that of the private sector. It has insinuated the values of the marketplace onto the high ground of the arts, these critics say, properly the realm of beauty and truth, not the profit-and-loss statement.",1988-02-21T05:00:00+0000

At least, if you have visions of a beautifully made, perfectly fitting suit with the construction, fit and hand-sewn touches that come only with custom work. Maybe it's easier if you happen to be a man. A lot of things seem to be, especially in Asia. There are certain accepted standards for men's suits made in Hong Kong. There should be no question about the hand-stitched lapels or pad-stitching on the underside of the collar to give it that soft roll. Narrow cotton tape should be applied along the lapel seam and down the front of the jacket to keep it from stretching out of shape, and wool canvas (called hair canvas) used to give body to lapels, collar and shoulders. For women's suits there seem to be no general standards of workmanship.",1988-02-21T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"MRS. CALIBAN, by Rachel Ingalls. (Laurel/Dell, $6.95.) An unhappy California housewife has an affair with a 6-foot-7-inch amphibian humanoid named Larry, who is fleeing from the law. In 1986, our reviewer, Michael Dorris, compared the novel to ''a strange conversation overheard on a bus: sketchy, incomplete, maddening, but totally unforgettable. . . . Rachel Ingalls has created a tight, intriguing portrait of a woman's escape from unacceptable reality.'' THE MAKING OF THE ATOMIC BOMB, by Richard Rhodes. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $12.95.) Albert Einstein's letter to Franklin D. Roosevelt in October 1939, urging the United States to make an atomic bomb, has become enshrined in the mythology of World War II. According to Richard Rhodes's history, which won a National Book Award, it was actually Alexander Sachs, a Wall Street financier, who persuaded F.D.R. of the need for what came to be called the Manhattan Project. Last year in these pages, William J. Broad praised the book for its ''remarkable breadth and depth, revealing new connections, insights and surprises. . . . Short on heroes and villains, [ it ] is populated instead with complex figures in a compelling plot.'' THE FISHER KING, by Anthony Powell. (Norton, $7.95.) In this novel by Anthony Powell, the author of ''A Dance to the Music of Time,'' the fisher king - the impotent ruler of Arthurian legend - is Saul Henchman, a famous photographer who is involved in a difficult romance with his beautiful assistant. In 1986, John Gross said in The Times that the enigmatic story is not ''for newcomers to Mr. Powell's work. . . . But for anyone who has already succumbed to [ his ] spell it can hardly fail to have considerable fascination.'' A MODERN DAY YANKEE IN A CONNECTICUT COURT: And Other Essays on Science, by Alan Lightman. (Penguin, $6.95.) The physicist Alan Lightman's decision to become a theorist rather than an experimenter was made in college after a disastrous experience in an electronics lab; he also learned along the way that he has a talent for telling stories about science. ''Throughout his yarns and reflections, [ he ] marvels at our intellectual bravado and the potency of the human mind,'' Yvonne Baskin said here last year. THE LOVER OF HORSES: And Other Stories, by Tess Gallagher. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) When Tess Gallagher's first collection of short stories was published in 1986, our reviewer, Bette Pesetsky, said she tried to forget that the author was already an accomplished poet. ''The reward was to find an excellent writer of prose who savors the elegance of simplicity and whose stories resonate and linger.'' DEPARTURES: Memoirs, by Paul Zweig. (Penguin, $6.95.) During a short life of painful introspection, the poet and critic Paul Zweig was obsessed by the notion that he was trapped inside what our reviewer, Michael Davidson, called a ''bubble of self-awareness.'' ''Although he wrote in many forms,'' Mr. Davidson said in 1986, ''the memoir may have been Zweig's most appropriate medium. It allowed him to reach back to specific moments and see them in all of their lucidity.'' A SPLENDID EXECUTIONER, by Timothy Downey. (Ivy/Ballantine, $2.95.) The newspaperman Pete Killharney's ''hit list'' of the 10 most reprehensible New Yorkers is an annual journalistic event; when someone starts killing the members of this rogues' gallery, he takes it upon himself to find the murderer. Last year Newgate Callendar said here that the novel is ''brisk, bright, often grimly amusing and a pleasure to read.'' REAGAN'S AMERICA, by Garry Wills. (Penguin, $8.95.) According to Garry Wills, Ronald Reagan's success in selling the public on his version of the American dream shows that he is ''the opposite of a chameleon: environments adapt themselves to him.'' Last year in The Book Review, C. Vann Woodward called this biography a ''remarkable and evenhanded study. . . . For efforts to find Mr. Reagan's 'place in history,' [ it ] will be indispensable.'' DELIRIUM ECLIPSE & OTHER STORIES, by James Lasdun. (Norton, $7.95.) In 1986, our reviewer, Jonathan Penner, said he was not impressed with all of these stories, which won the Dylan Thomas Award for Short Story Writing. But as a whole, the collection ''reveals a combination of talents - narrative, rhetorical, inventive, meditative - so rare that one forgives all else. James Lasdun is a writer to watch.'' HOLY FEAST AND HOLY FAST: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women, by Caroline Walker Bynum. (University of California, $12.95.) To medieval theologians man represented reason and the divine, while women - who were used to feeling subservient -were symbols of humanity, exercising their religious role in rituals involving food and fasting. ''The evidence [ the author ] amasses makes this daring thesis seem inevitable,'' John Freccero said here last year. ''Her work is a prodigious labor of social history, employing every resource imaginable.'' THE FAR CRY, by Fredric Brown. (Black Lizard, $3.95.) After George Weaver has a nervous breakdown, he flees Kansas City for the mountains of Taos, N.M., where he rents a house whose last tenant was a killer. In 1951, Anthony Boucher said here that the novel contains ''a fine bitter study of a bad marriage, and an admirable sense of the reality of murder.'' Mr. Boucher was also taken with Fredric Brown's HIS NAME WAS DEATH ($3.95), which has been reissued by the same publisher. The story of a woman who unwittingly sets off a chain of murders has ''one of the very few endings that have genuinely surprised me in a long time,'' he said in 1954.",1988-02-21T05:00:00+0000

Where do you write for information? - H. C., Hauppauge, L.I. Answer: A ferry service called Alaska Marine Highway operates year-round between Seattle and Skagway, Alaska. Passengers can stop off at ports on the route and board the next ferry passing through, sailing south or north. The vessels also carry cars. Departures from Seattle are only once a week, but the line runs daily service on the northern part of the route, between Prince Rupert, British Columbia, and Skagway, enabling passengers to make brief stopovers and take land excursions. The line's ships have cabins with berths for two, three or four people, but generally the cabins accommodate only about half of the passengers. Those without cabins sleep in chairs or bed down in sleeping bags on the carpeted decks of public rooms. An official of Alaska Marine Highway (Post Office Box R, Juneau, Alaska 99811; 800-642-0066) said that all berths on the Seattle-Skagway service had already been booked for the summer of 1988.

You've heard of novels based on the Bible, Greek myths or even Arthurian legend; this may be one of the first inspired by Mother Goose. But why not? The heroine, Miliana Bartha, who is possessed of ''three children, one husband, two lovers, and a woman friend,'' has an inspiration while scrubbing the floor one day. She decides to write a series of essays on the true meaning of Mother Goose. In doing so, she comes to see these familiar nursery rhymes as revealing the particulars of her own life. Nothing demonstrates this better than the ditty that begins, ''There was a crooked man . . .'' Six years before, Miliana left her second husband, Dominic Racatelli - whom she sees as the crooked man - and took with her a substantial sum of his money. Understandably, he has been searching for her ever since. Hence the title and hence the plot, which involves everything from a dog atop a Ferrari to a journey to the pyramids in the Yucatan. Susan Trott, the author of five previous novels, has an arch style that is very appealing and is a good match for this Mack Sennett-like story. It stands her in particularly good stead when she is writing about her main character, a delicate combination of free spirit and paranoiac. When the banter prevails, this short novel has an eccentric charm. It is only when the author tries to get serious that the charm, and the reader's interest, threaten to flag. Fortunately, though, this tendency mostly reveals itself near the end of the novel. And by then, Ms. Trott has put us in a forgiving mood.",1988-02-21T05:00:00+0000

Lee Ferguson Gruzen is a Protestant married to Jordan Gruzen, a Jew. Like all parents in mixed marriages, they had some important choices to make regarding the religious training of their children. The result of Ms. Gruzen's sincere and well-intentioned quest for answers is this shallow book, an unfocused narrative derived from her reading and interviews with rabbis, priests, counselors, children and other puzzled parents in mixed marriages. More concerned with life styles than with religion, ''Raising Your Jewish/Christian Child'' suffers from a lack of breadth. For the most part the author's reporting is extremely narrow, as she searches for enlightenment in the Trinity School on New York's West Side or in the movies of Woody Allen. There are, however, two observations worth noting. One is ''the clergy's common recommendation'' that whether you are going to raise your children as Jews, Christians, both or nonbelievers, decide early what you want to do - certainly before the baby is born - so as to avoid a sudden and rending disagreement later. The other observation comes from an unnamed priest possessed of transcendent wisdom. How should parents decide? ''Go with the strength,'' he answers Ms. Gruzen. ''If one parent is more involved and committed to his or her faith, then offer that to the child. If the other religion is the more vital one within the home, then honor that one.''",1988-02-21T05:00:00+0000

Michael Wood, author of ''In Search of the Trojan War,'' has now turned to slightly more modern times: the genesis of the English nation. He begins in A.D. 60, when Boadicea led her Celtic tribesmen in a doomed revolt against Roman rule, and ends a millennium later with William the Conqueror. The book's main subject is Anglo-Saxon England, ''a remarkably unified country . . . with a vernacular literature unmatched in Europe . . . and sophisticated machinery of government, chancery, coinage and law.'' Each chapter profiles a historical figure. The list includes Arthur, Alfred and others less famous, such as Offa (who unified central England) and Athelstan (''an English Charlemagne''). Mr. Wood is skilled not only at retelling events but also at showing how the era has been pieced together from archeological finds, Old English poems and surviving documents. Particularly interesting are the connections he suggests between Dark Age Britain and the present day. Tenth-century Northumbria resented rule from Wessex, which may help explain why the modern North of England votes Labor during Tory landslides. Alfred the Great appears as ''an oversensitive, highly-strung young man, strongminded and inventive,'' an early version of T. E. Lawrence. And Ethelred really did deserve to be called ''the Unready'' - the name is a barbed bit of Anglo-Saxon political satire. The companion volume to a BBC television series, this copiously illustrated book is first-rate popular history.",1988-02-21T05:00:00+0000

For centuries the Japanese themselves considered these mountains the sacred domain of the spirits, to be trod upon only by Buddhist priests and white-robed pilgrims. A British missionary, the Rev. Walter Weston, changed all that in the 1890's. When he was not evangelizing, Weston liked to climb mountains, first in the Swiss Alps, later in Japan.",1988-02-21T05:00:00+0000

The prejudices have been less harsh than those affecting other groups, but no less demeaning. THE ITALIAN AMERICANS (Macmillan, $49.50), an account by Allon Schoener, a cultural historian, of Italian life in the United States in word and picture, is a more positive testimony to the nature and achievements of these remarkably vibrant people. It is a beautifully produced book. The lavish illustrations include maps of early Italian exploration (under other national sponsorship) of the New World. There are photographs depicting the development of a community, from the debarkation of immigrants to the integration of later generations into the mainstream of American life - but with a distinctive cultural heritage that still manifests itself. The book avoids the familiar pattern of stressing the well-known figures (though they are in evidence), concentrating instead on the broader picture: workers, shopkeepers, church and veterans' groups. Here are the restaurants, the socials, the family and its members, from Italian grandparent to Yankee grandchildren. These ingredients project the warm feeling of a family album. A well-written introductory essay by A. Bartlett Giamatti, formerly the president of Yale University and now the president of baseball's National League, offers a cohesive overview of Italian-Americans, addressing questions of identity, language, stereotypes, religion, education and, yes, crime. Lee Iacocca has the last word in a brief epilogue to this heroic story from American history.",1988-02-21T05:00:00+0000

He made human rights a theme of his discussions with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and met with leading rights campaigners. Page A1 China sought Soviet cooperation in 1958 for a plan to lure United States troops into central China and then attack them with Soviet nuclear weapons, the Soviet President, Andrei A. Gromyko, has written in his forthcoming memoirs. A1 A rent boycott persists in Soweto, despite the South African Government's nationwide state of emergency. Officials say unpaid rent and service charges in the black township exceed $100 million. A1 Two more Palestinians were killed during demonstrations held in the Israeli occupied territories to protest the forthcoming visit of Secretary of State George P. Shultz. A group of less radical Palestinians asked the Palestine Liberation Organization for permission to meet with Mr. Shultz. A3 The P.L.O. has withdrawn a threat to revive attacks on Israelis outside Israel and the occupied territories. The move was in acquiescence to pressure from the organization's Arab backers, diplomats and officials said. A3 News analysis: Deadlocked talks seeking peace between anti-Sandinista rebels and the Nicaraguan Government are stalemated over issues of legitimacy and are likely to drag on until one side is willing to make concessions. A9 Haitians are anxiously scrutinizing their new President, Leslie F. Manigat, for signs that will tell whether Haiti under his leadership will be a tyranny or a democracy.

us,Meese and the Pipeline: The Story So Far,"1980: War breaks out between Iran and Iraq, and Iran shuts off Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf, through which Iraq had previously shipped most of its oil exports. 1982: Syria, sympathetic to Iran, shuts down an oil pipeline carrying Iraqi oil to the Mediterranean. Iraq, desperate for funds to finance its conflict with Iran, begins shipping its oil across Turkey and Jordan and negotiating with Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia for rights to build permanent pipelines. 1983: Jordanian diplomats ask American officials to obtain Israeli guarantees against attacks on pipelines. The Bechtel Group Inc., the San Francisco-based engineering services company, begins discussions about a pipeline in the Middle East. 1984: Bechtel holds further talks with Jordan and Iraq about the pipeline project, and discusses the plan with the United States Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Jordan and Iraq require additional guarantees that Israel will not sabotage the pipeline, and U.S. officials obtain the requested assurances in the spring of 1984, when Shimon Peres of the Labor Party is Prime Minster. February 1985: Bechtel brings in Bruce Rappaport, a Swiss businessman with connections to Israeli officials, as a partner. A few months later Mr. Rappaport retains E. Robert Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer, to help represent him in the deal. In late February Mr. Rappaport produces a letter from Prime Minister Peres saying Israel won't interfere with the pipeline. May 1985: Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, at the request of Mr. Wallach, arranges a meeting for Mr. Rappaport and Mr. Wallach with Robert C. McFarlane, then President Reagan's national security adviser. June 1985: Mr. Wallach and Mr. Rappaport meet with Mr. McFarlane, who endorses the $1 billion pipeline project. Aug. 15, 1985: Mr. Rappaport pays Mr. Wallach $150,000 for his services. >Aug. 31, 1985: Bechtel submits a new proposal to Iraq and Jordan. Sept. 19, 1985: Prime Minister Peres writes a letter to Mr. Meese expressing great interest in the project and saying he intends to it and Israeli guarantees with Secretary of State George Shultz during an October visit to the U.S. Sept. 25, 1985: Mr. Wallach addresses an ''eyes only'' memo to Mr. Meese on the status of the pipeline negotiations, in which he asserts that payments of $65 million to $70 million would be made to Israel, ''a portion'' of which would go directly to the Israeli Labor Party. Oct. 7, 1985: Mr. Meese responds by letter to Mr. Peres's letter of Sept. 19, suggesting that the Prime Minister should confer with Mr. McFarlane, rather than Mr. Shultz, about the pipeline during his U.S. visit because of Mr. Shultz's previous involvement with Bechtel. Oct. 16-24, 1985: Mr. Peres visits Washington and New York and talks with Mr. Meese and National Security Council officials and staff members about the pipeline project. Oct. 17, 1985: The Overseas Private Investment Corporation seeks a ruling from the Justice Department on the legality of assigning Israeli foreign aid from the United States as part of the pipeline's financial security package. Justice Department lawyers subsequently find the assignment of aid to be legally questionable. Late 1985: Israeli and American officials continue to explore ways to arrange financing and a security package for the pipeline. By the end of the year the Jordanians and Iraqis have rejected Bechtel's proposal and President Reagan's new National Security adviser, Adm. John M. Poindexter, has abandoned alternative ways of pledging Israeli funds to the project. May 1987: A special prosecutor, James McKay begins an investigation into the association of Mr. Meese and Mr. Wallach. Late summer 1987: Mr. McKay expands the investigation of Mr. Meese to include the pipeline project. October 1987: First news reports appear concerning Mr. Meese and the pipeline project.",1988-02-24T05:00:00+0000

In that race, the payoff for the triple was so unusually low as to create suspicions among stewards and board investigators. On Dec. 3, Filion was suspended 90 days for ''driving in a manner inconsistent with an effort to win,'' and five other drivers received 30-day suspensions for ''lack of effort.'' James Marohn and Jay Randall, who also drove in the race, were cleared by the board. However, the charges against Filion were upgraded to the more serious violation of fraudulent acts in racing, based on testimony from Marohn and Leo Bauer, the winning driver.

Manuel Antonio Noriega appeared to cemented his place as principal leader after rebuffing a Presidential move to oust him. Instead, the President himself was declared removed by the National Assembly. Page 1 Support for civilian rule in Panama was voiced by the Reagan Administration. The United States threw its full support behind the civilian President, Eric Arturo Delvalle, in his attempt to oust General Noriega. 5 U.S. curbs troops movements in Panama 5 Most Latin nations back deposed Panamanian 5 Mikhail Gorbachev urged Armenians to end nationalist protests in two Soviet southern republics. The protests pose one of the most difficult challenge he has faced. 1 In a meeting in Israel, George Shultz was reported to have met resistance from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to at least two key elements of the American proposals aimed at starting Arab-Israeli peace talks. 1 News analysis: In South Africa, the government's crackdown this week on anti-apartheid groups is in many ways a progression of the process that began with the banning of the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress in 1960. 3 The P.L.O. observer mission to the United Nations should be closed, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d has decided. But he is prepared for the P.L.O. to take legal action that may delay the closing, Administration officials said. 3 South Korea announced amnesty for hundreds of political prisoners. But by refusing to release many dissidents, including several prominent ones, the new Government faced charges of having reneged on commitments. 32 Rumania rebuffs U.S. trade benefits linked to human rights 3 Abduction splits Lebanese Shiites 4 Rio journal: A city awash in beauty and deluged in peril 4 For Israeli settlers, 'This is a war' 4 For Armenians in U.S., an issue of Solidarity 6 NATIONAL 7-10, 12 Prescription drugs by mail sold in bulk discounts are increasingly being bought by people with chronic diseases in an effort to hold down their health-care bills. But the sales have stirred debate in the medical community. 1 Producers of war materiel such as fighter planes face rejection of their products if they are not made more reliable, according to Gen. Robert D. Russ, head of the Tactical Air Command. 6 In the Jimmy Swaggart scandal, the elders of the Assemblies of God rejected a recommendation of lenient punishment for Mr. Swaggart and returned the issue to Louisiana church officials for reconsideration. 7 The new Supreme Court Justice, Anthony M. Kennedy, disqualified himself in one of the most significant cases the Court will face this term, the challenge to the constitutionality of the special prosecutor law. 7 Regulators warned aspirin makers that advertisements claiming that aspirin prevents heart attacks might be harmful to public health and a violation of Federal law. ''We are concerned,'' one Federal official said. 12 A Republican-led filibuster in the Senate survived an eighth attempt by Democrats to end debate. A break would have allowed Senators to vote on a bill to limit spending on congressional elections. 10 U.S. jury charges drug smugglers used Cuban base 6 Literary plea to preserve farms 7 School boards favor AIDS mandate 10 Politics#8-9 The life of Pat Robertson is a marriage of the sacred and the secular. Much is known about him; he appeared on television daily for more than 25 years, and there are five major biographies of him. But he remains a contradiction. 1 News analysis: Flip-flops have been a focus of campaigning among three main Democratic Presidential candidates, as they argue over who has switched positions on important issues for political advantage. 9 Presidential candidates' supporters in both parties differ greatly, according to the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll. Many candidates have distinctive followings, indicating the groups their messages appealed to. 8 Bush, a cautious front-runner 8 REGIONAL 33-36 A police officer was slain as he guarded the home of a Queens man who had complained to the police about crack dealers harassing his neighborhood. Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward called the shooting a ''deliberate assassination.'' 1 The killing of the officer has brought incredulity to the neighborhood in South Jamaica. Accompanying the slaying were feelings of intimidation and the sense no one is safe. 34 The slaying of an officer cast a pall over a police ceremony 34 The assignment of an officer to guard a witness's home is not unusual, New York City Police Department officials said. ''There was no reason to believe that the police officers would be in jeopardy,'' Mr. Ward said. 34 New York area consumer prices rose twice as fast as those in the rest of the country in January, spurred by increases in housing and grocery costs, the Government said. 1 A move by Chase Manhattan Bank, which may relocate 4,600 of its Manhattan employees, is becoming a cause celebre among city officials trying to attract development to boroughs outside Manhattan. 35 New housing financing called a cross-subsidy is helping to revive a Brooklyn neighborhood. The method relies on selling cooperative apartments to help pay for rental apartments in poor areas. 33 In the Tawana Brawley case, a lawyer for the teen-ager said that he would turn to Federal officials if Governor Cuomo did not replace Attorney General Robert Abrams as the special prosecutor. 35 Scores on standardized state tests are rising, annual dropout rates are declining and class sizes are shrinking in New York, the State Education Department reported in an evaluation of the Board of Regents Action Plan. 35 Ruling ends bar on use of barge as a temporary prison 35",1988-02-27T05:00:00+0000

Less than three hours later, Phinney extended his lead by winning a closely contested one-hour circuit race. He surged ahead of the pack of 91 riders in the final yards to edge Paolo Rosola of Italy. In the first race, Phinney's six-rider team had a time of 54 minutes 15 seconds.

The cost of repairs should be a guide to whether the shoe is worth fixing. Do-it-yourself maintenance can delay professional repairs. Frequent polishing of shoes is the best way to preserve them, industry experts say. Lanolin polish, used with waterproofing products like silicone spray, helps preserve leather. Shoes should be worn in rotation and stored on shoe trees. Shoes caked with salt should be dabbed immediately with a mixture of warm water and white vinegar, or wiped with a liquid salt remover (about $3). For high heels, a clear plastic scuff guard ($1.50) will prevent scrapes and holes. Here is a guide to professional shoe repair.

Besides, his career had been built on fashion lengths, not racing lengths. No matter. Oleg Cassini drove a 10-1 shot to victory at Freehold Raceway Thursday, the second day of his career as a professional harness racing driver. Cassini started in the second position on Hi Po Bay Myst and never trailed, pacing the mile in 2:05 2/5. Hi Po Bay Myst paid $22.20, $13.40 and $7 for $2 across the board, winning by three-quarters of a length over Champaign Johnny. ''I feel great,'' said Cassini in the winner's circle. ''I am very happy to show everyone that I can be competitive.'' On his first day, Cassini finished last in his first race, at least 25 lengths behind the winner. He was thrown from the sulky at the beginning of his second race when his horse reared back and broke the axle on his bike. The track physician said Cassini's blood pressure was too high after the accident and he would not let him drive in his final race. But Cassini had other designs.

us,"Jerry Zaks, Guide to 'Wenceslas Square'","IN LARRY SHUE'S PLAY ''WENCES-las Square,'' opening Wednesday at the Public Theater, a narrator recalls the 1974 trip he took to Czechoslovakia as a college student, along with a professor named Vince Corey, who was finishing up a book about the Prague Spring and its aftermath. The narrator (Victor Garber) is now a scenic designer whose artistic ambitions were fueled and whose maturity was shaped during this visit to Prague, and he tells his story as a kind of tribute to Vince Corey, his onetime mentor. At the end of the play, the narrator turns to the Professor (Jonathan Hadary) and a younger version of himself (Bruce Norris), who are both frozen in time. ''Vince?'' he calls quietly. ''This is for you. Thanks.'' For Jerry Zaks, the play's director, this moment is particularly resonant. When his friend and colleague Larry Shue died in a plane crash in September 1985, Mr. Zaks had already directed Mr. Shue's hit play ''The Foreigner'' in New York, and he planned to direct the playwright's other two full-length works, ''The Nerd'' and ''Wenceslas Square.'' (The current Broadway production of ''The Nerd'' is directed by Charles Nelson Reilly.) ''I remember the way Larry asked me; it was so wonderfully typical of him,'' says Mr. Zaks in his office at Lincoln Center, where he is resident director of the repertory company. ''If we were drinkers, I'd say it happened over drinks, but it was probably over french fries somewhere. He didn't look me in the eye, but he said something like, 'Gee, I certainly wouldn't mind if you want to direct all of my stuff.' So doing this play is for me, in a sense, unfinished business.''",1988-02-28T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE REAL WAR: The Classic Reporting on the Vietnam War, by Jonathan Schell. (Pantheon, $7.95.) Who were we fighting in Vietnam, Jonathan Schell wonders in a new essay introducing his war reports for The New Yorker - Hanoi, the National Liberation Front, the Soviet Union, China, world communism or ourselves? In 1967, John Mecklin said here that ''The Village of Ben Suc,'' one of the works included in this book, was ''written with a skill that many a veteran war reporter will envy, eloquently sensitive, subtly clothed in an aura of detachment, understated, extraordinarily persuasive.'' The book also includes ''The Military Half: An Account of Destruction in Quang Ngai and Quang Tin.'' TEXASVILLE, by Larry McMurtry. (Pocket Books, $4.95.) When Larry McMurtry returns to Thalia, the fic-tional Texas town of his novel ''The Last Picture Show,'' he finds that the movie theater has burned down and been supplanted by VCR's, satellite dish antennas and cable television. Last year our reviewer, Louise Erdrich, said that the book read too much like a screenplay but that it contained scenes that are ''sharp, spare, full of longhorn humor and color. . . . The characters who seemed, at the conclusion of 'The Last Picture Show,' destined to carry on the kindliest of small-town virtues have turned cartoonish and begun to crack.'' THE WHALE AND THE REACTOR: A Search for Limits in an Age of High Technology, by Langdon Winner. (University of Chicago, $8.95.) If only we can awake from our ''somnambulism,'' the author argues, we can make pluralistic technological decisions - like rejecting nuclear energy - and avoid concentrating power in the hands of an elite. ''He may not have totally convincing answers,'' David Dickson said here in 1986, ''but the questions he poses about the relationship between technical change and political power are pressing ones that can no longer be ignored.'' INDIAN COUNTRY, by Philip Caputo. (Bantam, $4.95.) With the Vietnam War behind him, a veteran finds life in Michigan's remote Upper Peninsula as frightening as in ''Indian Country'' - G.I. slang for an area under enemy control. Philip Caputo ''is a fine action writer, controlling the sweep of the narrative with musical skill,'' Frank Conroy said in The Book Review in 1987. ''The climactic passages have a kind of hallucinatory clarity, and they stick in the mind.'' RUSSIAN STUDIES, by Leonard Schapiro. Edited by Ellen Dahrendorf. (Penguin, $9.95.) The longest of these essays by the former lawyer and scholar Leonard Schapiro, who died in 1983, chronicles the formation of Lenin's philosophy. ''It is a model of clarity, close reasoning and tight-packed scholarship and leaves you very much regretting that Schapiro didn't complete the longer study of which it was originally intended to form a part,'' John Gross said in The Times last year. THE KING MUST DIE, by Mary Renault. (Vintage, $6.95.) The best known of Mary Renault's novels is about Theseus, the mythical king of Athens who slays the Minotaur in the labyrinth of Crete. ''What has previously been consigned to ancient vase paintings and frescoes . . . takes on a new meaning,'' our reviewer, Siegfried Mandel, said when the book was first published in 1958. ''She ventures into the complex pre-Hellenic era confidently and with imagination and insight, takes the myth out of mythology by creating a persuasively realistic and touchable canvas crowded with ancient people and places.'' Vintage has also reissued at the same price three more of the British author's fictional re-creations of life in ancient Greece. THE MASK OF APOLLO, published in 1966, is narrated by an actor, Nikeratos, who becomes involved in a power struggle between a friend of Plato's and the tyrant Dionysios the Younger. The hero of THE PERSIAN BOY (1972) is Alexander the Great's young servant and lover, Bagoas. THE PRAISE SINGER (1978) is about the poet Simonides, and offers an inside view of Greek politics in the sixth century B.C., the Age of the Tyrants. NOBEL DREAMS: Power, Deceit and the Ultimate Experiment, by Gary Taubes. (Tempus, $8.95.) The focal points of this story about big science are Carlo Rubbia, the egocentric Italian physicist, and the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, the largest in the world. Last year, our reviewer, Louise B. Young, praised Gary Taubes as ''a good storyteller, [ who makes ] his characters come alive. He recounts amusing anecdotes and describes the competition, the excitement and the tension that are undeniable facts of life in these big laboratories.'' THE LIMITS OF SCIENCE, by Peter Medawar. (Oxford University, $8.95.) There are some questions, Sir Peter Medawar writes, that science cannot answer, yet it is ''incomparably the most sucessful enterprise human beings have ever engaged upon.'' The Nobel laureate ''continues to radiate a confidence in rationality coupled with a no-nonsense didactic pragmatism that verges on the heroic,'' one reviewer said in 1985. SYMBOLS OF AMERICA, by Hal Morgan. (Steam Press/Penguin, $14.95.) As Hal Morgan shows in this well-illustrated book, America's heirlooms include our whimsical menagerie of trademarks, which can be at least as enticing as the products they represent. ''We have reached the region where mythical beings - Elsie the Cow, the Quaker Oats man, the Green Giant - take on a life of their own,'' John Gross said in 1986, ''where chickens are dressed like chefs and peanuts wear monocles; a land of winged heels and winged horses, blue ribbons and golden arches.''",1988-02-28T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"BREAD UPON THE WATERS. By Rose Pesotta. Edited by John Nicholas Beffel. (ILR Press, Cloth, $32; Paper, $10.95.) It was hard to faze Rose Pesotta. When a Spanish-language radio station in Los Angeles was pressured to stop carrying strike bulletins, she took her message across the border and broadcast from Mexico. When the press ignored her continuing garment workers' strike and fussed instead over the showings of the new spring fashions, the former sewing machine operator dressed her strikers in the evening gowns they had made and staged a high-fashion picket line that stole the show - and the headlines. ''Bread Upon the Waters'' (first published in 1944, and unavailable for many years) is a passionate, personal account of her experiences as a national labor organizer from 1933 to 1944, when she served as the sole woman member of the general executive board of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Pesotta's inventiveness, drive and spunk shine through on every page of the book, which she wrote with her friend John Nicholas Beffel. Feminist, anarchist and immigrant Jew, Rose Pesotta (1896-1965) regularly defied sexists, racists, anti-Semites and ideologues inside and outside union ranks. She reached out to ''mothers and daughters [ who ] spent days and nights ruining their eyesight and lungs over finery they never could hope to wear.'' But in 1944, deciding she could no longer tolerate being the token woman on the board of a union whose rank and file was 85 percent female, Pesotta resigned in protest. The feisty, forthright and, ultimately, tragic story she tells is worth the attention of anyone interested in the history of women or labor in America.",1988-02-28T05:00:00+0000

She was shy, self-conscious and had little confidence in her singing talent. She never reached a wide audience, but was a strong influence on singers who did - singers such as Frank Sinatra and Peggy Lee, who appreciated her superb craftsmanship. James Haskins, a co-author of books about Lena Horne and Nat (King) Cole, sketches the casual, almost aimless way in which Mercer's career developed. Her mother was an English-Welsh vaudeville singer, her father was a black American musician, and she was illegitimate. Born in 1900 and raised initially by her maternal grandmother and then in a Roman Catholic convent school in England, she was on her own from the age of 14. She became a favorite of the international set in Paris in the 1920's and 30's and, after coming to the United States in 1938, found a niche for herself in small clubs in New York. Mr. Haskins did not have an opportunity to interview Mercer before her death in 1984, but he draws on the recollections of people who knew her in Europe and the friends and neighbors she acquired after she bought a farm near Chatham, N.Y., in the 1950's. They build a warm, appealing picture of the private Mercer as a simple, down-to-earth person with a strong sense of propriety. But her qualities as a performer are harder to pin down. She had to be seen for an appreciation of what one of her accompanists, Loonis McGlohon, calls her ''unmatched'' power of communication. ''It is something that is difficult to explain in words,'' Mr. McGlohon says, and Mr. Haskins proves it. But when he has the material to deal with her simply as a woman, Mabel Mercer comes vividly alive.",1988-02-28T05:00:00+0000

The Pantheon is on what is properly called the Piazza della Rotonda, and only two of Italy's four kings are buried there: Vittorio Emmanuele II (d. 1878) and Umberto I (d. 1900). The two later kings lived in exile in Egypt and Portugal and are not buried in the Pantheon (nor in Italy). Besides Raphael and the two kings, five others are buried there, including Queen Margherita. Rome has suffered endless damage throughout the centuries, so no doubt it will survive the hamburger invasion. EFFINGHAM P. HUMPHREY JR. Wynnewood, Pa. Paul Hofmann replies: Mr. Humphrey is right in that the square around the Pantheon is officially the Piazza della Rotonda, but most Romans keep calling it Piazza del Pantheon the way New Yorkers keep calling the Avenue of the Americas Sixth Avenue. The first two kings of unified Italy are buried in the Pantheon; the third and fourth both died in exile. Italian monarchists are now campaigning to have their remains transferred to the Pantheon.",1988-02-28T05:00:00+0000

us,'Discovery' and Rediscoveries In Two Shows in the County,"FRANK S. HERRMANN, at the White Plains Public Library, is an artist brought back from the dead. The 11 painters and sculptors forgathered at the Hudson River Gallery in Ossining are rediscoveries, too, although very much alive. Herrmann, who lived from 1866 to 1942, never had to worry about money, while the Ossining artists can have worried about little else in their early years, because all worked for the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. Given the effect that financial security or its absence can have on an artist's output, it's this difference more than any other that makes the two events worth comparing. Herrmann, whose show is hung in the library's Museum Gallery, was the son of a rich businessman. A couple of years younger than Alfred Stieglitz, he grew up with the photographer-to-be on the same East 65th Street block in Manhattan. The two studied in Germany at about the same time, took vacations together, exchanged letters - were, in short, lifelong friends.",1988-02-28T05:00:00+0000

The impact is doubled if the locomotive is visible in the middle distance, pulling a fast train from one city to another, blowing for every curve and crossing. It's tripled if all this happens at night, so that you wake at 2 A.M. to hear the lonesome whistle, and, going to the window, see the string of lighted cars moving by, bright beads against the night.

Klass examines the current wave of reported contacts with unidentified flying objects, including the tale told by Whitley Strieber in his best-selling book ''Communion.'' Mr. Klass describes the work of those self-proclaimed experts whose first guess about any puzzling incident involves a U.F.O. He details claims of everything from straight kidnapping to impregnations by U.F.O.-nauts, supposedly uncovered by investigators. And he pays particular attention to the use, and abuse, of hypnosis in analyzing U.F.O. reports. During treatment, for example, the hypnotist can inadvertently plant ''pseudo-memories'' that later seem real to the subject. Some people may be further damaged or deluded by irresponsible researchers. For instance, one woman who had had an abortion was told that extraterrestrials had removed her fetus for an interbreeding experiment. The interested reader will be fascinated by the story of Christy Dennis, a woman who gained acceptance in U.F.O. circles for two years before admitting her experience with eight-foot-tall golden-haired beings was a hoax. In a tone that is more snide than skeptical, Mr. Klass presents an uncommon view of the methods, motivations and personalities behind all this. The author of ''UFO's: The Public Deceived'' and other books, he does a thorough job in his role as a muckraker.",1988-02-28T05:00:00+0000

us,MULTIPLEX CINEMA FEATURES TRAFFIC,"Your recent article about the new All-Westchester Saw Mill Multiplex Cinema in Hawthorne [ About Westchester, Jan. 31 ] completely missed what is, in our view, the most significant feature of the new center: traffic access in and out of the mammoth parking lot is entirely inadequate. Our recent visit to the complex on a Saturday night provoked vivid and heated comparisons to a descent into hell, as we waited, and waited, for the traffic to inch down into the packed and poorly laid-out parking area. We do not plan to return until this problem is solved. The sole means of entry into and departure from the parking area are two small, two-lane ramps. Each ramp carries one lane of traffic in each direction, and both ramps were, upon our arrival about 20 minutes before show time, jammed in both directions. In an effort to beat this mess, emissaries from cars around us were seen jumping out of their blocked cars to sprint across lanes of traffic for the ticket windows. The traffic flow is so poor that we weren't even parked within 20 minutes, much less inside the gargantuan lobby. In the parking lot itself, traffic seemed to be going in every direction simultaneously, and hence was moving, truly, at a snail's pace. The crowning touch was the theater's incomprehensible decision to have several of the most popular shows begin at the same time, which maximized the load on the sadly inadequate entrances and exits. We can't imagine how the developers of this monstrosity thought two small traffic ramps would suffice, and by what means the local planning officials were persuaded to unleash this disaster upon the people of Westchester.",1988-02-28T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"FORGING PEACE: The Challenge of Central America. By Richard R. Fagen. (PACCA/Basil Blackwell, Cloth, $24.95; Paper, $7.95.) For Americans seeking an alternative to the ''covert intervention, surrogate war, and systematic deceit'' that brand our Government's policy in Central America (as George McGovern puts it in the foreword to ''Forging Peace''), this political primer offers some refreshing ideas for reform. The book is a group project of the liberal organization Policy Alternatives for the Caribbean and Central America that was overseen by Richard R. Fagen, a professor of Latin American studies at Stanford University. He argues convincingly that the best way to secure vital American interests in the region is to promote ''peace through diplomacy'' and ''security through development.'' Unfortunately, events have somewhat overtaken the book. Mr. Fagen suggests that the United States support a ''Contadora-type'' peace initiative, which, among other features, called for a ban on all foreign military bases and personnel in Central America; there is no mention of the current Arias plan, which makes much the same proposals. But never mind. The strength of the book lies in its recommendations for formulating a new United States policy toward Central America. Essentially, that entails stopping all aid to the contras and vigorously promoting throughout the region economic, political and social reform consistent with democratic values and ideals. A pie-in-the-sky idea? Perhaps. But after more than seven years of costly war in Nicaragua, it surely is worth a try.",1988-02-28T05:00:00+0000

Thomas Scully, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Nevada School of Medicine, and the freelance writer Celia Scully have written a medical handbook for consumers that is laced with useful tips for improved communication between health professionals and their clients. Many controversial cases - like the story of Baby M, who became a national symbol of the surrogate-parents issue, and that of a 12-year-old child whose parents chose unorthodox cancer therapy over standard treatment, resulting in accusations of child neglect - are replayed and analyzed as learning exercises for the reader. Discussions of symptoms, diagnoses and extenuating family circumstances are followed by lists of medical options and legal ramifications. There is an unfortunate tendency to avoid discussing the moral aspects of ethically disturbing issues. The authors, however, do offer valuable questions to ask when considering organ transplants, for example, or when making life-and-death decisions for another person. Other subjects include how to redress malpractice and billing fraud and even how to handle the news media in precedent-setting cases. ''Playing God'' will appeal to people who have a hard time separating emotions and intellect when they are confronted with difficult choices, but it may chill those readers who perceive that profoundly complex issues have been reduced to consumer health topics.",1988-02-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Stage: 'A Walk in the Woods',"IN one of several funny passages that threaten to quicken ''A Walk in the Woods'' into nearly a trot, a Soviet disarmament negotiator tells his American counterpart that the real blame for their nations' nuclear deadlock belongs to Switzerland. With its bucolic mountains and centuries of peace, Switzerland is so soothing that it drains the urgency from diplomatic talks about Armageddon. ''We should put the table at the bottom of a missile silo,'' argues the Russian, Andrei Botvinnik (Robert Prosky), to the American, John Honeyman (Sam Waterston). ''Then we would negotiate.'' It's a smart point, and one only wished the evening's playwright, Lee Blessing, had taken it fully to heart. Like his two characters, Mr. Blessing is an earnest foe of the arms race, frustrated by the intractable political games superpowers play with the destiny of mankind. But as a piece of theater, ''A Walk in the Woods'' is the esthetic equivalent of Switzerland, and not only because its setting is ''a pleasant woods on the outskirts of Geneva.'' The play at the Booth fudges the distinctions of actual international politics and arms negotiations, choosing instead to telescope the messy, life-or-death conflict into a sentimental relationship between two likable envoys. Because the candied antagonisms of that relationship are more reminiscent of ''The Odd Couple'' or ''I'm Not Rappaport'' than harsh reality, Mr. Blessing has made a subject as volatile as the bomb seem as pleasantly cool - and as safely remote - as his neutral forest setting.",1988-02-29T05:00:00+0000
