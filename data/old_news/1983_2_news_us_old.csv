us,Who Gets the Money,"The Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance system, or Social Security, as it is commonly called, touches the lives of vast majority of Americans. About 115 million workers and their employers pay taxes into the system. About 36 million retired people, disabled workers and their families receive monthly benefits. Most people receive much more money in benefits during their retirement years than they ever paid in Social Security taxes. The size of retirement and disability benefits are based largely on the income the recipients earned while they were working. People who had high incomes generally receive larger retirement checks than those who made less. But lowincome workers receive at retirement a larger percentage of what they once earned than those who made more money. In recent years, the high rate of inflation has driven benefits up, and the high rate of unemployment has reduced the amount of taxes paid into the system by workers and employers. As a result, the Social Security system has been taking in, and it has had to borrow funds to cover the monthly checks it sends beneficiaries. In Washington this week, the House Ways and Means Committee began hearings on legislation that would reduce benefits and increase revenues so that they system would once more be on a sound financial footing. The Congressional debate is expected to last through the spring. The charts on this page, devised by Nancy Lee, graphics editor of The New York Times, provide an overview of the Social Security system, its history and the reasons for its current financial difficulty.",1983-02-04T05:00:00+0000

These blissful folk could enjoy, say, ''Tristan und Isolde'' almost as much if the words were eliminated. After all, the antiword argument runs, once you know even vaguely what the ''Liebestod'' is about, Wagner's orchestral music spells out the real emotional meanings of Isolde's final scene more effectively than any words could. True enough, as far as it goes, but that is an old, impoverished view of opera, now happily losing ground. I suppose there could be a spectator who enjoyed attending tennis matches blindfolded, simply to relish hearing the ball being thwacked back and forth, but that lover of sheer sound might miss a lot, too.",1983-02-06T05:00:00+0000

In this play, which is set in 1945, we learn that World War II was a time of deprivation for WASP households, in part because there were no men left around to repair broken Hitchcock chairs.

The report also revealed that Israel's Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen.

The Red Sox said they were very interested in Evans and planned to keep him around for the next two years, whether he liked it or not. Meanwhile, one of the club's three general partners, Buddy LeRoux, belittled a report that he wanted to sell his interest because of differences with the other partners, Jean Yawkey and Haywood Sullivan. The others had no comment on any split, but a spokesman for Mrs. Yawkey sought to create a common front on the Evans matter by denying Evans's contention that Mrs. Yawkey favored giving in to the outfielder's demands. ... The Red Sox did have some success with player relations, however.

The needs of most of these people would not be met either by the elevators in subway stations required by a recent New York State Supreme Court decision or by wheelchair lifts in buses. These may provide accessibility in theory but in fact they provide little mobility. What handicapped people need is a convenient and efficient transit system that can carry them door-to-door. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Today, few disabled people make use of the wheelchair lifts installed in 1,300 city buses. The entire fleet of lift-equipped buses has never provided more than 500 rides a month for people in wheelchairs - an average of 17 rides a day. At this rate, with an annual debt service and maintenance bill of $7 million for lift-equipped buses now on the road, each ride is costing more than $1,000. Working against higher ridership are the problems of getting to the bus stop, mechanical difficulties with the lifts and the impatience of drivers and passengers, who often resent the delay incurred in the operation of the lifts. Many riders wind up annoyed, unhappy and angry with themselves for feeling that way. Riding the subways poses greater hazards for the handicapped than does their use of buses. The mandated elevators that, if installed throughout the system, would cost more than $1 billion, hardly offer a solution to the problems encountered by the disabled rider on the platform or in the moving train.",1983-02-12T05:00:00+0000

Though the 60's was really its heydey, from 1962 until Maciunas's death in 1978 at the age of 47, Fluxus was a prolific producer of satirical manifestos, jokey multiples, hit-and-run concerts, cheap publications, street events and theater pieces, quixotically devoted to making art ''unlimited, mass-produced, obtainable by all and eventually produced by all.''

In the course of his complex career he functioned as a critic, editor, gallery owner, promoter, enthusiast and nurturer, but he started as a photographer and he remained one throughout his life. It is his photography, then, that is the focus of the excellent exhibition, ''Alfred Stieglitz,'' which opened Feb. 3 at the National Gallery of Art's freshly renovated West Building galleries. Using 171 exquisite examples drawn from a set of 1,600 key Stieglitz prints donated to the Washington museum by the artist Georgia O'Keeffe, guest curators Sarah Greenough and Juan Hamilton have in large measure accomplished their aim of ''demystifying'' this premier American photographer's achievement.",1983-02-13T05:00:00+0000

One feels that ever since ''A View From the Bridge'' was first seen here in 1955, Mr. Miller has stared at it, brooded over it, prodded it and manipulated it and stretched it every which way, unable to put it down until he'd made it grow up. And we know there have been times in the past when this sort of self-critical reworking produced admirable results for one or another playwright. There are also times when it produces a kind of dramatic forgetfulness: the author has tampered with the text so often that he's quite forgotten what's in it and what's not, whereupon he winds up doing some scenes three or four times over and some scenes not at all. In which case the play isn't really rewritten, it's just overwritten.

This bit of doomsday humor is one strand in one of the most taut, uncertain - and possibly momentous - election campaigns in the 34-year history of West Germany.

The artificial additions lasted until 1924, when everything but the fig leaf was removed.'' I'm sure the latest face lift is an improvement, but it does not follow that we should unequivocally applaud the amputations perpetrated in 1924. What we now have is a well-scrubbed version of the fragmented statue that emerged from the ground at Grottaferrata and entered the Belvedere Courtyard of the Vatican in 1503. What we have lost are the efforts of a gifted sculptor, Fra Giovan' Montorsoli, to reconstruct the original masterpiece. No mere ''capricious restorer,'' Montorsoli served as Michelangelo's trusted assistant in the Medici Chapel in the church of San Lorenzo, Florence. It was he who finished the statue of Giuliano de' Medici, probably worked on the statue of Lorenzo de' Medici and executed the St. Cosmas for the chapel.

By now, you might think, the world would have come to terms with his genius, sorting out the gold from the fool's gold. Not so. This centennial season is certain to demonstrate that ''The Case of Wagner,'' as Nietzsche called it in a famous 1888 essay, is still before the court. I think it should be obvious, after more than a century in which diligent exegetes have churned out millions of words in attempting to explain the man and his works, that Wagner is going to continue to baffle us. And maybe that's a good thing. If the enigma that is Richard Wagner were ever to be cleared up to our general satisfaction, his mystique might die on the spot, like Kundry when Parsifal touches Amfortas's wound with the holy spear.",1983-02-13T05:00:00+0000

The tragic news is that this slender volume is all we will have of Breece D'J Pancake's work, since he committed suicide in 1979, when he was not quite 27 years old. Precisely why he killed himself at the very start of what promised to be a remarkable career is a mystery, though both James Alan McPherson and John Casey, who knew him as a student in the writing program at the Universty of Virginia, set forth a number of clues. Breece Pancake (a typesetter once printed his middle initials as D'J, and he adopted the oddity) ''didn't know how good he was,'' Mr. Casey says in his poignant memoir; ''he didn't know how much he knew; he didn't know that he was a swan instead of an ugly duckling.'' But the stories -tense, elegiac, remorseless in their insistence on the past's dominion over the present - argue for a sensibility so finely honed, so vulnerable to the inexorable passage of time, that it is likely death appeared as a solace. As the stories make powerfully clear, Breece Pancake identified so intensely with the coal-mining and farming area of West Virginia in which he was born that he could not have failed to identify with its slow dying as well.",1983-02-13T05:00:00+0000

Outside the office building, a hand grenade exploded in a group of anti-Government demonstrators who had been heckled and assaulted repeatedly by young toughs singing ''Begin, King of Israel!'' and shouting that it was too bad Hitler hadn't got all the European Jews, too bad they weren't in the Beirut refugee camps where the Phalangists could have finished them off.

us,THE DIGITAL ERA GIVES RISE TO THE 'TONMEISTER',"Easy-does-it often brings better results than a gung-ho try. Most craftsmen already know this, but they're just learning it in the record business, where almost everyone has been trying a little too hard lately. For a while it seemed that engineers let themselves be lured by the new digital techniques into attempting ''ultrafidelity'' recording that allows technical braggadocio to prevail over musical considerations. Instead of capturing the natural sound of music as it might be heard from a good seat in a good hall, engineers were tempted to show off their tricks in a more drastic fashion. Aiming for ''spectacular'' sound, they moved their microphones close to the performers, thereby exaggerating sonic detail out of its natural proportion so that detail overwhelmed the aggregate and - so to speak - the sound upstaged the music. No doubt the result was riveting. Some listeners were mesmerized by the sound. Others thought it crass.",1983-02-13T05:00:00+0000

''Had I been a rich man's son,'' Mr. Douglas says, ''the services of the finest surgeons would have been available. As an iron molder's boy, I almost had my leg amputated before chance intervened and a specialist cured me without thought of a fee.''

us,Griffith Sounds Off,"When a baseball player wins in salary arbitration, he gets the money. The club owner gets to sound off. After his top relief pitcher, Ron Davis, had been awarded a salary of $475,000, Calvin Griffith, the owner of the Minnesota Twins, got his turn. ''He's no more entitled to that kind of salary,'' Griffith said, ''than I am being President of the United States.'' The owner was so upset that he raised the possibility of trading Davis, saying, ''I know deep down in my heart that I would die a slow death if I had to pay him that much money for the whole year.'' But he said he would probably be stuck with Davis, who made $300,000 last year, because ''now that he's making that kind of money, I don't know of anybody who would want him; he certainly isn't worth that kind of money.'' As he complained, Griffith, the last of the major league owners who makes his living strictly from baseball, received some surprising support from Davis.

But in many cases, investing in an I.R.A. can be preferable to another, fully taxable investment, even if the funds are left there for as little as five years, says the accounting firm of Arthur Young & Company. The reason is twofold: You get a dollar-for-dollar tax deduction for the money you contribute to the I.R.A. and that money compounds tax-free until you withdraw it.",1983-02-20T05:00:00+0000

us,THE EDGES OF THE GREAT WAR,"AN ICE CREAM WAR By William Boyd. 408 pp. New York: William Morrow & Co. $17.95. WILLIAM BOYD'S first novel, ''A Good Man in Africa'' (1982), was a tight and bitter comedy about sexual embarrassment and the British presence in postcolonial Africa, an unlikely but almost entirely successful combination of Kingsley Amis and V.S. Naipaul. In his new novel he turns to the little-known East African theater of World War I, in which armies from the British and German colonies there faced each other across the border of present-day Kenya and Tanzania. The British expected the campaign to be a joke; their control of the seas would keep the undermanned and undersupplied Germans from fighting for more than a few weeks. Hence this novel's title - and its irony, for the Germans kept fighting until the Armistice. ''An Ice-Cream War'' is less fully realized than its predecessor, but it is a more ambitious novel, and Mr. Boyd's ironic vision of the way individuals are dwarfed by the history through which they live is a large achievement.",1983-02-27T05:00:00+0000

Not far into the book, however, we find we have left the pleasant surface of an intellectual group biography and descended to a somewhat darker level, the pyschological underlife. Soon we are embroiled in the jealous passions, violent betrayals, suicidal allegiances and symbolic murder plots of a group Freud only halfplayfully called ''the savage horde.''",1983-02-27T05:00:00+0000

Fortunately, by retiring in 1950, he was relieved of the need to find a new introductory ploy, for what may have been true before that time has certainly not been true since. The last 30 years have seen a transformation of the medical profession. What was formerly a care-and-comfort occupation has been converted into the life-saving activity it had always been thought to be by the layman.",1983-02-27T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Complete Poems 1927-1979',"ELIZABETH BISHOP'S steadily widening audience and her endurance among the readers she has once claimed are the reward of constancy to an ideal object. Her reputation is founded on perhaps 25 poems, among them ''Love Lies Sleeping,'' ''The Unbeliever,'' ''The Shampoo,'' ''Over 2,000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance,'' ''Arrival at Santos'' and ''First Death in Nova Scotia.'' Altogether that looks like a modest achievement until one considers that most of the larger poetic reputations of the past century have been founded on similar evidence. The difference is that Bishop's masterpieces stand in a higher ratio to her work as a whole. She published little, because she would not release a poem that fell short of a complete conception; and what strikes one most in reading her poems again is the way they answer each other across pages or volumes, so that each plays its part: ''The Bight,'' for example, earning our esteem for the sake of its much fuller picture of the dream house sketched in ''The End of March''; the figure of streets coupled to stars, a mystery in ''Going to the Bakery,'' somehow clarifying a similar figure in ''Love Lies Sleeping.''",1983-02-27T05:00:00+0000

Their relationship had been composed in great part of remoteness and absence. Most of the feelings it had engendered and fostered had been unarticulated and unnoticed. Indeed, his father's inability to notice him had seemed to Mr. Auster one of the principal and abiding elements of their knowing each other. ''It was not that I felt he disliked me. It was just that he seemed distracted, unable to look in my direction. And more than anything else, I wanted him to take notice of me. ... The more aloof he was, the higher the stakes became for me. ... I realized that even if I had done all the things I had hoped to do, his reaction would have been exactly the same. Whether I succeeded or failed did not essentially matter to him. ... his perception of me would never change ... we were fixed in an unmoveable relationship, cut off from each other on opposite sides of a wall. Even more than that, I realized that none of this had anything to do with me. It had only to do with him.

Naipaul. In his new novel he turns to the little-known East African theater of World War I, in which armies from the British and German colonies there faced each other across the border of present-day Kenya and Tanzania. The British expected the campaign to be a joke; their control of the seas would keep the undermanned and undersupplied Germans from fighting for more than a few weeks. Hence this novel's title - and its irony, for the Germans kept fighting until the Armistice. ''An Ice-Cream War'' is less fully realized than its predecessor, but it is a more ambitious novel, and Mr. Boyd's ironic vision of the way individuals are dwarfed by the history through which they live is a large achievement.",1983-02-27T05:00:00+0000

Illustrated. 245 pp. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press. $18.50.The Progressives called prostitution the Social Evil - an ominoussounding euphemism that betrays the inflated moral enthusiasm with which these reformers set out to attack a vaguely defined problem. It was as if all the world could be set right by making the brothels disappear from America's cities. Ruth Rosen, a professor of history at the University of California, in her perceptive book ''The Lost Sisterhood'' shows that the early 20th-century campaign against prostitution absorbed a broad array of middle-class social and political concerns in a society where class structure and relations between the sexes were rapidly changing. The Social Evil symbolized the decline of traditional morals, the commercialization of human relations, the rise of a threatening urban working-class culture, the exploitation of labor, even the spread of contagious disease.",1983-02-27T05:00:00+0000
