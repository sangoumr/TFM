Mexicos census agency, compiling reports of murders from the 32 federal entities, said there were 26,037 homicides last year, a 4.3 percent decline from 27,213 in 2011, which was the most in recent years. The homicide rate was 22 per 100,000 residents, a decline from 24 per 100,000 the previous year. The homicide rate in the United States is 4.7 per 100,000 people, according to United Nations figures, but Mexicos rate was far lower than several other countries in the hemisphere. A number of analysts believe this data provides a good barometer of overall violence, which had surged because of infighting among criminal gangs and the governments efforts to suppress them. In 2007, there were 8,867 homicides, the lowest number in the last six years. ",2013-08-01T02:54:11+0000

In a statement summarizing the results of its investigation, the attorney generals office said that hydrocarbons that had leaked into the ground decades before the building was constructed had contributed to the buildup of methane gas and that an electrical spark had probably ignited the combustible mix. Pemex is suffering from declining production and has long had a poor safety record.

The driver, Francisco Jos Garzn Amo, had answered a ticket inspectors call on his cellphone and was traveling at a permitted speed of 199 kilometers per hour, or 123 miles per hour, before the train switched to another track in a reduced-speed zone. During the call, an alarm went off in the drivers cabin. The black boxes recorded Mr. Garzn screaming as he tried to activate the brake. The trains speed dropped to 195 k.p.h., or 121 m.p.h., but another alarm sounded, 500 yards from the curve where the accident took place. Mr. Garzn activated an emergency brake three seconds later. A third alarm sounded, and 13 train cars started derailing. Mr. Garzn activated another emergency brake as the train careened from the tracks and then slammed into a wall at 153 k.p.h., or 95 m.p.h., nearly twice the speed limit. Mr. Garzn was arrested last week and charged with reckless homicide in the deaths of 79 people. ",2013-08-03T00:04:54+0000

The movie captures the hypnotic quality of this watery landscape, with its steel blue undulations and the Freudian oceanic feeling it summons. It invites you to gaze into this watery abyss, to ponder its mysteries as well as those of the swimmer whose image brackets the movie and evokes John F.

(Showtime 2) 2 DAYS IN NEW YORK (2012) Julie Delpy directed and stars in this tale about 48 hours in the life of Marion, a high-strung photographer; her partner, Mingus (Chris Rock, above left, with Ms. Delpy, right, Talen Ruth Riley and Owen Shipman), a journalist and radio host; and their two children from previous relationships, as they all deal with the arrival of Marions Parisian family members, who proceed to drive the couple crazy. Marions father (played by Ms. Delpys father, Albert) is detained at the airport for trying to enter the United States with cheese and sausage taped to his body; her sister (Alexia Landeau) and her sisters boyfriend (Alex Nahon) smoke weed in an elevator and have noisy sex in the bathroom, possibly involving Minguss electric toothbrush. The driving crazy part is hilarious and persuasive, partly because Ms. Delpy and her cast depart from the usual caricatures of Frenchness while still engaging in broad, silly satire, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. And although Marion and Mingus never quite seem like a credible, comfortable couple, he added, the films best parts are those that cast an affectionate, unsentimental eye on the city, which looks lived-in, real and nonmythical, the way that Paris often looks in French movies and New York rarely does in Hollywood confections.",2013-08-05T04:15:05+0000

(Cinemax) MATCH POINT (2005) Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish tennis player recently retired from the professional circuit, climbs the British social ladder after taking a job at a London club, helping its rich members polish their strokes. Soon, he has befriended Tom (Matthew Goode), an heir to a business fortune; has wooed his sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer); and maneuvered himself into the family firm and into the family as Toms brother-in-law. But then Chris meets Toms fiance, a scrappy American actress, Nola (Scarlett Johansson, above, with Mr. Rhys Meyers), and suddenly the temperature of his life increases from a polite simmer to a full sexual boil. What passes between Chris and Nola is not only desire, but also recognition, which makes their connection especially volatile, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, describing this drama as a Champagne cocktail laced with strychnine. He added: As their affair advances, Ms. Johansson and Mr. Rhys Meyers manage some of the best acting seen in a Woody Allen movie in a long time, escaping the archness and emotional disconnection that his writing often imposes. It is possible to identify with both of them  and to feel an empathetic twinge as they are ensnared in the consequences of their own heedlessness  without entirely liking either one. But it is the films brisk, chilly precision that makes it so bracingly pleasurable. The gloom of random, meaningless existence has rarely been so much fun, and Mr. Allens bite has never been so sharp, or so deep. A movie this good is no laughing matter. ",2013-08-06T05:00:05+0000

Personally, because I imagine the flavors of this crostata as broad rather than sharp, I would probably stick with reds or ros.

Rick Scott and his cabinet on Tuesday voted to allow anthropologists from the University of South Florida to begin exhuming the remains of boys who were buried decades ago at the Dozier School for Boys in Marianna. The reform school, now shuttered, had a history of neglecting and abusing the boys in its care. Accusations of abuse spanned decades. A group of elderly White House boys, named for the building where they say they were beaten, have come forward in recent years to speak about the abuse. Anthropologists began identifying the graves in a portion of the school that had been set aside for black boys during segregation. Family members of some of the boys who died at the school have fought for more than a year to have the bodies exhumed, examined and reburied in cemeteries closer to home. ",2013-08-07T02:01:37+0000

There are fears that two adjoining blocks, which are badly damaged, will also fall. Fifteen people were missing.

(BET) LUV (2013) A recent parolee (the rapper Common) dreaming of a better life decides to take his 11-year-old nephew (Michael Rainey Jr., above left, with Common) out of school for a day and teach him how to be a man in this crime thriller from the director Sheldon Candis. But as the boy eats his first oyster, tastes his first beer and learns how to steer a car, he also ends up being an accomplice  and perhaps a hostage  to a man who turns out to be a desperate criminal. Mr. Candis, who wrote the script with Justin Wilson, balances the more sensationalistic aspects of the movie  guns are pointed and fired, blood is shed, and threats are issued with heavy, macho menace  with keen attention to details of character and place, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The landscape of Baltimores African-American neighborhoods may be familiar to fans of The Wire (as will the faces of a few of the actors), but Luv is telling a different kind of tale about drugs, the law and urban life. It is, as the title suggests, a love story, focused on the complicated bonds between men who regard one another as family and whose lives are scarred and shadowed by violence.

Holder Jr. to withdraw a subpoena requiring him to testify about a confidential source, in light of the Justice Departments new guidelines for obtaining information from journalists in investigations. On July 19, a federal appeals court ruled that Mr. Risen must testify in the criminal trial of a former C.I.A. official, Jeffrey Sterling, who is charged with leaking classified information. The case involves material published in Mr. Risens 2006 book, State of War. The ruling came a week after Mr. Holder released a report on significant revisions to Justice Department policies intended to strengthen protections for members of the news media. The amended guidelines call for tactics like subpoenas to be treated as extraordinary measures to be used as a last resort, noted David N. Kelley, Mr. Risens lawyer, in a letter to Mr. Holder. We urge you to apply those principles to this case, Mr. Kelley wrote. A spokesman for the Justice Department said it was examiningthe next steps in the prosecution of this case.

(AMC) LOW WINTER SUN Frank Agnew (Mark Strong), a Detroit homicide detective with a tragic past, is persuaded by a colleague, Joe Geddes (Lennie James, above), to help him kill another cop, who he claims murdered a loved one of Franks. But as holes surface in Joes story, Frank starts to worry that he has been played in this new series, based on a 2006 British mini-series of the same title. Ruben Santiago-Hudson portrays the precinct commander, who assigns Frank to lead the investigation into the cops death. David Costabile is an Internal Affairs detective delving into corruption. And James Ransone is a thug who, with his wife (Sprague Grayden), and a police officer on his payroll, looks to set up a drug and prostitution business. Its a deadly serious drama, but some of the early scenes are so overwrought that they are almost laughable, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. The series, she said, doesnt need to overreach. It has an intriguing story, an aptly sinister setting and an excellent cast. She added: Its inevitable for viewers to yearn for the kind of odyssey that series like The Wire and Breaking Bad provided. Low Winter Sun isnt that, but its an entertaining way station. The fifth, and final, season premiere of Breaking Bad leads in at 9. Talking Bad, a companion show hosted by Chris Hardwick that analyzes the seriess last eight episodes, follows at 11.",2013-08-11T06:23:53+0000

us,Whats on Thursday,"4:15 P.M. (Sundance) ORLANDO (1993) A beautiful young nobleman (Tilda Swinton, above) adored by an aging Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp) falls asleep one night in the 17th century and wakes up five days later as a woman. Same person, no difference at all, she says, unflustered. Just a different sex. She continues to learn about life through the centuries up until the present, pondering the differences between men and women  as well as their similarities  in this adaptation by Sally Potter of Virginia Woolfs 1928 novel. Charlotte Valandrey plays Sasha, a wanton Muscovite princess with whom the male Orlando falls in love. Billy Zane is the American with whom Orlandos female version has a more enduring if less sexually demanding relationship. This ravishing and witty spectacle invades the mind through eyes that are dazzled without ever being anesthetized, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. Throughout Ms. Potters Orlando, as in Woolfs, there are a piercing kind of common sense and a joy that, because they are so rare these days in any medium, create their own kind of cinematic suspense and delightedly surprised laughter. Orlando could well become a classic of a very special kind, not mainstream perhaps, but a model for independent filmmakers who follow their own irrational muses, sometimes to unmourned obscurity, occasionally to glory. More than anything else, he added: Orlando is Ms. Swintons triumph. With the firmest but lightest of touches, she has spun gossamer.",2013-08-15T05:00:05+0000

But knowing, sophisticated attempts to replicate those things often traffic in their own kind of snobbery, confusing condescension with authenticity.

The students were also hoping to cast light on the states racial profiling practices and zero-tolerance rules in schools, which have led to increases in suspensions and expulsions. This week, the group won enough petitions by Florida lawmakers to poll the Legislature on the need for a special session. But the group was unable to secure the required 96 legislative votes. Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, also rejected the idea of a session. Republican legislative leaders said it was time for the students to clear out.

(13) PARSIFAL Jonas Kaufmann sings the title role in this new production of Wagners opera about the knights of the grail, staged in a postapocalyptic setting of sun-baked earth and swirling mists by the French Canadian director Franois Girard, in his Metropolitan Opera debut. Ren Pape plays the wise knight Gurnemanz; Katarina Dalayman (on the ground above, next to Mr. Kaufmann and in front of Mr. Pape) is the wayward temptress Kundry; Peter Mattei is the wounded king Amfortas; and Evgeny Nikitin is the evil wizard Klingsor. Daniele Gatti conducts this coproduction with Opra National de Lyon and the Canadian Opera Company, presented in two parts by Great Performances at the Met. The gloominess of this production can become oppressive, Anthony Tommasini wrote in a New York Times review in February. Still, there is much to admire in Mr. Girards thoughtful and intrepid staging, full of striking imagery. The Met, he added, has assembled about the best Parsifal cast available today, while Mr. Gatti draws diaphanous playing from the great Met orchestra and captures the shifting currents of this richly chromatic and complex score.

Adding to the mystique is a sense that Cordova might have retreated because he has something unsavory to hide.

Consider the star reporter Scott McGrath, who plunged into disgrace after a preliminary investigation into Cordovas secrets blew up in his face. McGrath has a score to settle, so when Cordovas achingly gifted daughter turns up dead in a Manhattan ruin, its Take 2 for the unemployed journalist. Nor is McGrath the only one who wants to know whats been going on behind the camera; in short order hes joined by a shabby but smoldering drug dealer named Hopper and a breathless ingnue, Nora Halliday.

About 575 people were rescued by government vessels and small fishing boats by early Saturday, Petty Officer Joy Villegas of the Philippine Coast Guard said in a phone interview.

Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the man who captures her heart: Count Vronsky, a young military officer with the eyes of a poet and a domineering mother (Olivia Williams). And Alicia Vikander is Kitty, a lovely young woman adored by Levin, the gloomy rural landowner (Domhnall Gleeson) widely understood to be Tolstoys alter ego, with his idea of love  an ennobling union of souls  serving as a rebuke to the amorality festering in cities. I assume you know that it ends badly, but Mr. Wrights real interest, like Tolstoys, is in everything that happens in between Annas first meeting with Vronsky and her final encounter with the wheels of a train, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. And while Mr. Wrights screen versions of Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice and Ian McEwans Atonement remain trapped in literariness, he added, Mr. Wrights Anna Karenina is different. It is risky and ambitious enough to count as an act of artistic hubris, and confident enough to triumph on its own slightly  wonderfully  crazy terms. Pious Tolstoyans may knit their brows about the stylistic liberties Mr. Wright and the screenwriter, Tom Stoppard, have taken, but surely Tolstoy can withstand (and may indeed benefit from) their playful, passionate rendering of his masterpiece.

(13, 49) THE LADY VANISHES In this Masterpiece Mystery! movie, based on Ethel Lina Whites 1936 novel, The Wheel Spins, from which Alfred Hitchcock adapted his 1938 thriller, The Lady Vanishes, Iris Carr (Tuppence Middleton, above, with Tom Hughes), a beautiful young socialite, is befriended on a train by an older Englishwoman named Miss Froy (Selina Cadell), who then disappears  after which Iriss fellow passengers deny she ever existed. Only Max Hare (Mr. Hughes), the infatuated engineer, pays heed to Iriss conviction. Is it fair to compare this film with Hitchcocks? Mike Hale asked in The New York Times. It doesnt really matter, because if youve seen the original, its impossible to do otherwise, he decided. This new Lady Vanishes, directed by Diarmuid Lawrence (South Riding) from a screenplay by Fiona Seres, is a perfectly adequate television mystery of the week. But it forgoes the crackling pace, light touch and surprisingly sophisticated sexual banter of the original, opting for melancholy, ominousness and sentimentality.",2013-08-18T05:23:55+0000

(Sundance) THE PLAYER (1992) In this film directed by Robert Altman, Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), the head of production at a large Hollywood studio, tries to fend off a young genius (Peter Gallagher) rumored to have been hired as his replacement while figuring out who is writing him poison-pen postcards. When the hate mails author  a screenwriter (Vincent DOnofrio) Griffin failed to get back to  turns up dead, he becomes a suspect, partly for falling in love with the writers girlfriend (Greta Scacchi, above, with Mr. Robbins). Whoopi Goldberg and Lyle Lovett play the detectives who make Griffin squirm. As a satire, The Player tickles, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. It doesnt draw blood. Mr. Altmans most subversive message, he added, is not that its possible to get away with murder in Hollywood, but that the most grievous sin, in Hollywood terms anyway, is to make a film that flops. In Short Cuts (1993), at 10:15, Mr. Altman intertwines the experiences of Los Angelenos in adaptations of Raymond Carver stories. Mr. Robbins reappears as a philandering motorcycle cop who cant be faithful to the woman (Frances McDormand) with whom hes cheating on his wife (Madeleine Stowe). Lily Tomlin is a diner cook who hits a small boy with her car. Bruce Davison and Andie MacDowell are his parents; Mr. Lovett is the baker who makes his birthday cake. Fred Ward, Buck Henry and Huey Lewis are three pals who find a dead woman while fishing. And Jennifer Jason Leigh is a mother who supports her family by doing phone sex, sometimes while washing dishes or changing diapers. The lives are often desperate and the characters inarticulate, but the group portrait is as grandly, sometimes as hilariously, realized as anything the director has ever done, Mr. Canby wrote. When future social historians want to know what the temper of life was like in one corner of America in 1993, Short Cuts will be a mother lode of information. Its also a terrific movie.

Todays Izmir is largely Turkish, but the moniker lingers. For religious Turks, the label seems appropriate for this sunny, palm-fringed seaside city, with its relaxed attitudes and many nonobservant Muslims. For most residents, though, the nickname is proof of Izmirs progressiveness. Reverential images of Ataturk, the founder of modern secular Turkey, are everywhere, and in June many in the city protested against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan after his Islamist-inspired government cracked down on peaceful demonstrators in Istanbul who had mobilized to save a city park from developers. Izmir  which is among four international cities that are vying to hold the World Expo in 2020  has much to offer visitors: a renovated waterfront, an ever-evolving night-life district and slick new design hotels.

Mr. Rouhani, who took office this month, has vowed to pursue a more flexible approach toward resolving the dispute over Irans nuclear program, which many countries suspect is aimed at giving it the capability to produce nuclear weapons, despite Iranian denials. Last Friday Mr. Rouhani replaced the head of Irans Atomic Energy Organization, which runs the countrys nuclear facilities.

The swan was one of about 200 that live on Baths Island and belong to the queen. Until 1998, under a law dating to the 12th century, killing or injuring a swan was classified as treason, and the crown retains ownership of all unmarked mute swans in areas along the River Thames. Wild swans are also protected under a 1981 act, and to injure or kill a swan  let alone eat one  is against the law. Wendy Hermon of Swan Lifeline said that the whole breast had been removed, and it looked like it had been eaten for lunch. There was just a swan skeleton left, she said. Its absolutely disgusting, I cant imagine the kind of people that would do this. She said the carcass, with its feathers still attached, was taken by her group to be cremated.

us,"Jimmy Connors, Ladies Man","Technically, Jimmy Connors wasnt the most overwhelming player. He was on the slight side; his serve was so-so, his forehand questionable. His only truly great stroke was his two-handed backhand. That he managed to win eight Grand Slam events (five U.S. Opens, two Wimbledons and one Australian Open), spend 160 consecutive weeks at No. 1 (1974-77) and rack up a record 109 career singles titles (John McEnroe and Roger Federer each have 77; Rafael Nadal has 58) is a testament, in large part, to a relentless and, at times, all-consuming will. This trait goes a long way toward explaining Connorss most quietly astounding feat: for 16 years, he held a Top 10 ranking. In an era when tennis careers can flame out over a half-dozen seasons, Connors  who on his 39th birthday won a fourth-round U.S. Open match against the 24-year-old Aaron Krickstein in 4 hours 41 minutes  looks, in retrospect, more and more like a freak of nature or nurture or both.",2013-08-23T09:00:06+0000

In 1802, the term made a hop to Britain after a group of Francophiles in London formed a Pic-Nic Society to gorge, guzzle and perform amateur theatricals. Participants drew lots to determine who would supply which dish  from calfs-foot jelly to blancmange.

A particularly delicious variety that has been popping up at many of New Yorks izakayas (the Japanese equivalent to a gastropub) and sake bars recently is the Tokubetsu Junmai from the gourmet sake brewery Nanbu Bijin. Its name translates to southern beauty, but Nanbu Bijin is actually located in northern Japan, in a region once controlled by the Nanbu clan of samurai. This junmai  a pure, full-bodied class of premium sake  has a bright, floral bouquet, almost like a lily blossom, and starts crisp before offering a sweet finish almost like honeydew.

But considering that the first time around I was a jobless teenager and that a shiny complexion and unwashed hair is probably not the best combination for the office, I looked to Lloyd Simmonds, creative director of Yves Saint Laurent Makeup, for a few pointers.

Jacqueline Jules imagines what Rosh Hashana might be like for a young family whose new year is starting in a new house in a new town. Dina, who is about 7, finds nothing is as it should be: the friends she liked to visit for the holiday are now hours away, and her home is a mess of packing boxes. It doesnt feel like Rosh Hashana here, she complains. We dont even have a round challah. A series of mishaps makes the phrase What a way to start a new year! a common refrain in the house, until a colleague of Dinas father suggests the family join him at the temple he attends. Though the holidays are different than Dina remembers, she learns something about making friends and embracing change. Judy Steads illustrations, rich with festive pinks, greens and purples, are attractive and cheerful even when her charactersexpressive faces register disappointment or impatience. What a Way to Start a New Year! is notable in that Jules assumes a basic understanding of the holiday; making this amusing and less obviously didactic book a pleasure to read.",2013-08-28T17:11:11+0000

(HBO) GLICKMAN (2013) In 1936, the Bronx-born Marty Glickman, above, a national sprinting champion, earned a spot on the United States Olympic track team as part of the 400-meter relay. But in Berlin, with Hitler in the stands, Mr. Glickman and Sam Stoller  the only Jews on the relay team  were replaced the day before the event by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe, ostensibly because secret German runners were expected to challenge for the gold. (Mr. Glickman, who died in 2001, maintained that anti-Semitism was at work.) The Americans won the race; the Germans finished a distant fourth. After returning to the United States, Mr. Glickman eventually found his niche in basketball and football broadcasting. Despite being rejected for a more Midwestern announcer when the N.B.A. finally signed a network contract, he became the voice of the Giants during the 1950s and 60s and the Jets in 1972.

Coetzees richly symbolic early novels Waiting for the Barbarians and Life and Times of Michael K, his starkly narrated new novel plunges us at once into a mysterious and dreamlike terrain. But where those books evoke Coetzees native South Africa and the madness of apartheid, immersing the reader in situations of nearly unbearable intensity, The Childhood of Jesus is set in a possibly posthumous limbo in which a haze of forgetfulness has enervated most of the characters, as in a paralyzing smog. We arrive by boat in a city called Novilla, in an unnamed but possibly southern European country, in the company of a man named Simn, who has taken under his protection a child named David  Not my grandson, not my son, but I am responsible for him. It would appear that the travelers are refugees: they have come from a camp, a place called Belstar, where they were given Spanish lessons and two passbooks. The child has been separated from his parents. Simn seems to have no family at all. Having, like all his fellow travelers, been shorn of his memory on the voyage to Novilla, Simn arrives in unknown territory and must establish himself; he must find shelter and he must find work to support himself and the boy. If Simn has had a profession or a trade in his former life, he cant recall it; he is grateful to find work as a stevedore, for which he is barely qualified. It will be Simns obsession to locate Davids mother, whose name he doesnt know and of whom he knows nothing, not even whether she has arrived in this strange, nameless country.",2013-08-29T19:39:57+0000

Maybe through criticism, some discontinuity, some dialectic, that will enable me to forget him. His future wife proved a stronger motivation than any dialectic.

The overachieving seamstress of Tiger Mending isnt satisfied with simply stitching up cut lips and handkerchiefs; she eventually takes a job in a faraway country sewing the stripes back on ruptured tigers (who apparently yawn too widely for their own good).
