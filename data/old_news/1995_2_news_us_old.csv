us,Surviving a Stolen Car Ordeal,"On the Sunday after Thankgiving, LaRae Mardesic of Los Angelas discovered that her 1988 Nissan Sentra had been stolen from the carport at her apartment. She alerted police then her insurer, Farmers Insurance Group. ""My greatest fear was that they would low-ball me, and I was very cautious when I started to negotiate,"" she said. Rental -- As an account executive for the United Way who visits companies constantly, Ms. Mardesic needed a replacement qiuckly. Her insurance policy required her to pay for a rental car for the first two days -- $16.99 a day at a special insurance rate. After that, she paid $1.99 a day and the insurer paid the balance until the claim was settled. REIMBURSEMENT -- Ms. Mardesic began working with her insurance claim adjuster. Using a car appraisal service, the adjuster placed the car's value at $4,488. After producing recent receipts for repairs and maintenance, she was credited for 20 to 25 percent of those bills. Farmers also covered the sales tax, the remaining time on the car registration and some contents. Ms. Mardesic received a check for $5,033 on Dec. 21. CAR RECOVERED -- The day she received the check, the police found her car. Ms. Mardesic had the option of keeping the cash or taking her old car back. She did not owe any money on the old car, but she decided to keep the money and trade up to a more reliable car. REPLACEMENT CAR -- She settled on a 1993 Sentra, paying $9,990 including tax and licence. Rather that using the insurance check as a down payment, Ms. Mardesic paid down credit card debt that carried a high annual interest rate, 15.15 percent. She borrowed the full cost of the car with a five year loan at 10.5 percent. Over five years, she will pay $13,083 for the car.",1995-02-04T05:00:00+0000

And on Friday came news that January's unemployment rate had turned higher for the first time in over two years, to 5.7 percent from 5.4, with job growth at a weak 134,000. That's bad news for the jobless, of course, but it's just what the Fed wanted -- a too-strong economy means inflation. But even as the Fed clamped down over the past year, the unemployment rate headed stubbornly lower -- until that mirror image cracked last week. Needless to say, the stock market was giddy, with the Dow industrials rushing ahead by 57 points, its largest jump since summer, on the Big Board's sixth-busiest day ever.",1995-02-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Fleece Fabric: Not Just for Skiing Anymore,"WHAT: Polartec, the soft, cozy, synthetic fleece fabrics by Malden Mills of Lawrence, Mass. Manufacturers like L. L. Bean, Timberland and North Face turn Polartec into outerwear for everything from skiing and kayaking to walking the dog. ALIASES: Whether it's called Polarfleece, Polarplus, Polarlite (all Malden trademarks) or Synchilla (Patagonia's version), it's basically the same thing: knitted polyester occasionally mixed with materials like Lycra or nylon to make it more form-fitting. BEYOND THE GREAT OUTDOORS: Henri Bendel started selling a private-label Polartec shirt with pinked edges ($98) last June. Now, the store is making Polartec cardigans, vests, A-line skirts, baseball jackets and leggings in 18 fashion colors like sage, maize and cappuccino. Nicole Miller's fall collection featured Polartec skirts, dresses and twin sets, and J. Crew recently added a Polartec bathrobe ($78) to its catalogue. THE ATHLETES' CASE FOR POLARTEC: The fabric -- Malden makes it in 100 varieties and nearly 5,000 colors, prints and patterns -- is lightweight but extremely warm, and it dries quickly; garments meant to be worn next to the skin have anti-microbial properties, meaning they are hypoallergenic and resist mildew. And unlike wool or cashmere, Polartec can be thrown into the washing machine. The labels even say, ""Do not dry clean."" Malden Mills, which is privately owned, said Polartec's popularity had caused the company to grow at an annual rate of 20 percent for the last decade. Last year, the company had worldwide sales of $400 million. THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS' CASE FOR POLARTEC: Since 1993, Malden has been offering its Recycled Series -- Polartec made in part from recycled clear plastic soda bottles. About 15 large bottles are used per jacket. Malden estimates that it will use more than eight million pounds of recycled plastic this year (about 140 million bottles). GROUNDS FOR APPEAL: ""Customers have reacted viscerally to the feel of this fabric -- it's warm, cuddly and plush,"" said Gail Goldberg, a divisional merchandise manager at Bendel's. ""It's the Rolls-Royce of fleece fabrications."" FIRST EXPERT WITNESS: ""I live in a Polartec cocoon,"" said Sandy Pittman, the New York socialite, who has climbed the tallest peaks on all five continents and has traveled to both the North and South Poles. ""I was one of the last converts to it, because I tend to be a traditionalist. But after a soggy trip to the Arctic in wool knickers, I became a man-made-fiber gal.""",1995-02-05T05:00:00+0000

Adolf Loos, the architect and chief prosecutor of the modernist case against ornament, wrote in 1910. Gottfried Semper, Loos's predecessor by some 50 years, had already noted the correlation between the Ephesians' richly decorated clothing and the Temple of Ephesus. In 1871, Charles Garnier claimed that the silks and jewels worn by the women in the audience had figured in his design for the Paris Opera. Still, the notion that buildings and clothes are interrelated has met with more acceptance among fashion designers than it has among architects, many of whom are suspicious of any attempt to link their work to a subject so readily debased by discussions of hemlines and trends.

Language is wired into the human brain by evolution as surely as web spinning in spiders or sonar in bats, says the author, a professor at M.I.T. who directs the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience there. In this work, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1994, he explains how children learn language and how the brain computes it. This is ""a brilliant, witty and altogether satisfying book,"" our reviewer, Michael D.

us,Where the Dots Came From,"There are plenty of stylish, if by now overly familiar, images in THE PRINTS OF ROY LICHTENSTEIN: A Catalogue Raisonne 1948-1993 (National Gallery of Art/Hudson Hills, $95). There are also plenty of surprises. What is familiar is the artist's signature themes: consumerism, recycled imagery from comic books and 1960's advertising and a penchant for ironic quotations from other artworks. What is surprising is how profoundly the graphic work has fed -- and in some instances proved a catalyst to -- the artist's innovation on canvas. Most startling are Mr. Lichtenstein's pre-Pop prints from the early 1950's, which provide an unusual look at some of his earliest artistic sources. Here, quirky images of knights in armor, damsels in distress and tomahawk-wielding Indians look to Paul Klee and Picasso as their inspiration, rather than to contemporary culture. Here, too, the reader sees foreshadowings of the artist's later visual language: the Ben Day dots, artificial wood grain, parallel stripes and black outlines of his hallmark Pop pieces. The prints, which Mary Lee Corlett, a research associate at the National Gallery of Art, has arranged in chronological order, are divided into three sections: prints made by the artist, prints made in conjunction with events at the Leo Castelli Gallery and prints and related objects that were mass produced. Ruth E. Fine, the National Gallery's curator of modern prints and drawings, has provided a plodding, though fact-filled, essay examining the symbiosis between Mr. Lichtenstein's graphic works and his paintings, as well as the artist's seminal role in the print renaissance of the 1960's. This is an eye-opening book, unusual for the light it sheds on aspects of Roy Lichtenstein's career that were previously unexamined. ANDREA BARNET",1995-02-12T05:00:00+0000

The Penguins moved closer to the N.H.L. record 15 games without a loss at the start of a season, set by the Edmonton Oilers in 1984-85. Pittsburgh's Ken Wregget, the only N.H.L. goaltender to play every minute this season, has allowed 3 goals or fewer in 9 of the 11 games.

He locks Christian Slater in a dressing room at the Gap on the day Slater would have proposed to Ally Sheedy, who breaks up with him for standing her up, therefore never giving birth to ""Paul."" The Complicator also manages to get Corey Haim on jury duty during spring break, disguises himself as a hairdresser to convince Bridget Fonda that her sweetheart (D. B.

The decor may be too geometric for your taste -- rectangles, circles and planes of all kinds in white, red, orange, black and brown -- but the room is very functional. ARTHOUSE (Chronicle, $16.95) is the invention of Graham Percy, an illustrator who was born in New Zealand and now lives in London. It is an imaginary residence built on centuries of Western art, a place where eyes and mind come to play, a source of cheerful wonder. Is it a personal pantheon in which ""A Children's Room for Giorgio de Chirico"" (somber and architectural) and ""A Window Box for Henri Rousseau"" (where a lion sits under leafy plants) are homages to the masters Mr. Percy venerates? Did he instead, after years of respect, decide to take revenge, poke fun and devise a bathroom with a tiny toilet, a little dog and three white balls in a wooden box for Joseph Cornell, or a dollhouse built with Brillo boxes for Andy Warhol? After several visits to ""Arthouse,"" Mr. Percy's intentions cease to matter much. From his sunny arrangement of oranges in ""A Refrigerator for Paul Cezanne"" to the lonely potted plants facing a desolate lawn in ""A Back Porch With Cacti for Edward Hopper,"" the glow of Mr. Percy's love of art and life makes you want to come back.

As a result we were very interested in ""By Rail Around the North Island of New Zealand"" (Dec. 4). The writer clearly had a wonderful time and presented her experiences very well, but we think the reader will get the wrong impression: Railroads are not the method of choice to see New Zealand. We would urge that anyone wishing to really see the wonders of this country to choose either tour bus or autosince the railroads do not go to many of them. We traveled by both road and rail and there is no question which is preferable. D. LEONARD WERNER New York, N.Y. Susan Spano, the author, responds: You probably do see more by road travel, but it can also be more costly. While in New Zealand, I spotted a brochure for a low-cost bus tour operated by the Ice Bus Northland, Post Office Box 1553, Auckland, New Zealand. It makes numerous stops across the North Island, allowing passengers to get off and on at will, with reservations at hostels.

Despite his novelist's unshockable awareness of the range of human type, he had apparently not envisaged a biographer quite like Norman Sherry, who brings to the pursuit of Graham Greene an obsessional, relentless passion for detail and the sifting of ambiguous evidence worthy of the curious object of his unremitting investigations. The result is a book in which we meet the biographer as bloodhound, evidently relishing the thrill of a chase that has taken him on long journeys, through many archives, to many encounters with witnesses, but who at the last is prevented by his own innate compassion from sinking his teeth in his quarry's all-too-vulnerable jugular. For what Mr. Sherry gives us in this second volume of his massive study of a grotesquely complicated life is a compulsively readable, astutely humane account that, in less responsible hands, could have been presented in sensationalist, even salacious terms.",1995-02-26T05:00:00+0000

Travels With Wynton","The life of the jazz combo is a delicate balancing act, juggling several personalities against one another, composition against improvisation, road trip against studio time, art against commerce. The trumpeter Wynton Marsalis's achievements in handling those varied demands have brought him considerable success. Judging from its title, one would expect his book, SWEET SWING BLUES ON THE ROAD (Norton, $29.95), to document how he had managed this mix. At its most engaging, it does just that, offering brief vignettes of the days and nights of a touring band: the humor, the petty annoyances and the satisfaction of making music for (mostly) appreciative audiences. There is also a moving chapterlong homage to respected elder jazzmen. Frank Stewart's elegant photographs offer a nice visual counterpoint to the text. Unfortunately, at some point in his career, Mr. Marsalis took on or had thrust upon him the mantle of Spokesman for the Art of Jazz, a mantle that he now wears quite happily. As a result, too much of the book is taken up with transcripts of classroom sessions in which he restates his views on music and culture and his distaste for rap, rock and MTV. Whether or not one agrees with his assessment of popular culture, he has stated these views forcefully in other, more appropriate venues.

Big-wave surfers tend to use big boards, 10 feet 6 inches in this case, compared with an average 6 feet or so, and have to cope with speed, and fear. Jay Moriarity, 16, pictured above, got stuck in the lip of the wave when he should have been halfway down the face. The wind caught his board and threw it up in the air a moment after this photo was taken. Moriarity went down with the wave and actually hit bottom, something that almost never happens with a wave this size. It was one of the worst-looking wipeouts anyone had seen. But he wasn't hurt; he rested and then caught eight more waves that day. Four days later at the same spot, one of the best big-wave surfers, Mark Foo, was killed when he wiped out on a smaller wave.",1995-02-26T05:00:00+0000
