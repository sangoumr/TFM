Actually, it was not much of a gamble, for the Requiem can make a tremendous impression in the right hands and Mr. Giulini is certainly one of the most accomplished and most inspiring leaders of choral music to be found anywhere in music today.",1982-12-03T05:00:00+0000

''We feel that on a ship like the QE2 - with 24 different cabin categories ranging in price from $1,000 to $5,000 for a five-day trans-Atlantic crossing and with passengers who have widely varying service demands - it would be very difficult to set guidelines.

Dazzling and provocative, Tom Wolfe's essay on modern architecture argues that a cult-like group of ideologues foisted the ''glass box'' on a world that finds the style distasteful. In his review, Paul Goldberger pointed out the similarities between ''From Bauhaus to Our House'' and Mr. Wolfe's 1975 work, ''The Painted Word,'' which maintained that the theories of postwar American painting had become more important than the paintings themselves. ''I share Mr. Wolfe's irritation at the extent to which many contemporary architects seem to make words their priority,'' Mr. Goldberger said.

Roosevelt revalued gold, more ore was discovered and suddenly we no longer needed to stay at a cheap boarding house when we went to Manila.$ My first stay at the Manila Hotel was in November 1935 and was undertaken because my mother wanted me to witness the arrival of Pan American Airways' flying boat ''China Clipper'' on the first commercial flight across the Pacific.

Crimes punishable under this measure, which supersedes civil law, include the following: ''Any act with intent to impair the efficiency or impede the working, or cause damage'' to public property or the smooth functioning of government; abetting ''in any manner whatsoever ... the commission of such an offense''; and failure to inform the police or army of the ''whereabouts or any other information about such a person.''

Before his arrest, he was an active member of the Helsinki Watch Committee and he agitated for the right of Jews to emigrate to Israel. Thus, he is being oppressed not only as a man but also as a representative of the human spirit - and particularly of the Jewish quest to be identified with the people and land of Israel.","Those of us who have never met him have come to know him through his wife, Avital. On the morning after their wedding eight years ago, Mrs. Shcharansky, who had received permission to emigrate, left the Soviet Union with the assurance that her husband would join her within six months. She was further informed that if she did not leave then, she would find it virtually impossible to leave later. As time passed, it became clear that the Kremlin had no intention of granting Mr. Shcharansky a visa. During their separation, Mrs. Shcharansky has labored tirelessly to bring his plight before the eyes of the world. If you have not seen her pain, you cannot understand the meaning of anguish.

Beyond that one-liner, however, the great epigrammatists have not left us many sharp and snappy insights into criticism, the world's second oldest profession. The few aphorisms that cry out to be remembered tend to be somewhat vulgar and do not bear repeating in the presence of sensitive newspaper readers. Certain pungent witticisms on the subject do circulate in the musical world, but no decent person wants to hear about them. Certainly no decent critic would pass them along. The more printable japes run along the general lines of this one, contained in a sniffish note recently received at this desk: ''A music critic is like a surgeon who thinks that when he has removed a woman's appendix he has made love to her.''

Unless the land is leased, some of the value of the mortgage is on the land, not just the building, and land cannot be depreciated. Leon M. Nad, a partner in Price Waterhouse, a leading accounting firm, says there are several sources you might consult to determine the value of the land. Talk with the sponsor of the conversion, the company that insures the property or the financial institution that holds the mortgage.

There might be a discovery of himself too deep for the adventurer to disclose. We suspect he may have stepped over the margin of escape and become part of a lost civilization or a world we had never imagined. Strangeness alone is not enough; the best accounts of travel and adventure leave you with an odd sense of loss and longing. In part that comes from the common experience - that going does not necessarily mean we get anywhere. We are fascinated by the few who have taken a leap and landed in an enchanted place.

The organization said temporary shelters would soon be opened in churches and synagogues.

Wallach last month, were studying what to do next. Robert M.

Other artists - particularly the Dadaists - quickly seized on the new idea, however, and not only as a means of breaking out of the two-dimensional boundaries of painting. Extending the repertory to include less neutral material - photograph shards, parts of old engravings, scraps of advertising, etc. - and inventively juxtaposing it, they made use of collage for symbolic, satirical and political comment.",1982-12-12T05:00:00+0000

They formed the nucleus of what is today a marvelous miscellany of art from antiquity to modern times, including splendid European paintings; a great collection of 17th- and 18thcentury silver; bronzes, ivories, tapestries, miniatures, coins, Greek and Roman sculpture, and antiquities from all parts of the world.

What the medium needed to distract itself from its economic doldrums was a fresh infusion of talent and energy; it got one from the art world, and we all should feel better for it. Throughout its history, of course, photography has drawn from the styles and ideas of painting, so in one sense this art-world influence is nothing new. (Even while purportedly adhering to its own ''inherent'' qualities under the dictates of Modernism, the photography of this century has been influenced by Cubist, Constructivist, Surrealist and even Abstract Expressionist styles.) Artistic trends continue to affect photography, but today the influence clearly goes both ways, with the art world taking as much as it gives. Photography is now an integral part of the practice and discourse of today's art - which may explain why the segregated photography marketplace seems to be withering.",1982-12-26T05:00:00+0000

The new forecast means that revenue will be less than had been anticipated and that spending to help the jobless and needy will be greater. (Page A1.)",1982-12-29T05:00:00+0000

However you may feel about the word, brunch probably conjures up generally expensive meals for which reservations must be made and special clothes (at least, casually elegant) must be worn. As pleasant as such a meal can be, after a week of holiday celebrations topped by New Year's Eve, a more relaxed and less self-conscious version of brunch might be just the thing for New Year's Day. Relaxed and generally inexpensive breakfast-lunches can be had in a number of the city's ethnic restaurants, few of which require reservations, nor do they inspire serious attention to dress. The varied and savory Chinese dumplings that comprise a dim sum breakfast make a diverting and soul-satisfying first meal for the New Year. There are several dependable Chinatown meccas for dim sum that will be open tomorrow. Among the best are Hong Gung, 30 Pell Street (571-0545), serving dim sum from 9 A.M. to 3:30 P.M.; Hee Seung Fung (H.S.F.), 46 Bowery (374-1319), with dim sum from 8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M., and the Imperial Inn, 23 Pell Street (233-1014), where dim sum can be ordered from the menu between noon and 3 P.M.

Both were sensuous rather than cerebral in their approach, but Matisse believed in ''an art of balance, of purity and serenity, devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter,'' while Schiele's often erotic work was raw and tortured and vividly ''psychological,'' reflecting not only his own inner turmoil, but also the avant-garde angst of pre-World War I Vienna.",1982-12-31T05:00:00+0000
