Giuliani have crisscrossed the city seeking support for their electoral bids, countless words have been uttered on issues ranging from the safety of the city to the temperament of each other's opponent. Here are some of the more memorable comments. DINKINS Crime We've hired 9,000 cops since I've been Mayor, for a net of 5,700, pretty close to 6,000 and more coming. And crime is down in the seven major F.B.I. index categories for the first time in 36 years, and for more than two consecutive years. Down in the major areas. Giuliani says, well, crime is not really down, they're just not arresting as many people. Well, you know, you've got less crime, there are fewer things for which people ought to be arrested, that makes sense. nd moreover, among the categories is homicide. Where do you think they are hiding the bodies? He says they are not down, so they are hiding the bodies somewhere, I guess. Nonsense, crime is down. Speech, Bethel A.M.E. Church, Harlem, Oct. 10 Race Whether we like it or not, race is the silent visitor. Race should never be a subject of political debate. But race relations, if our city is to reign pre-eminent, must be spoken about -- without fear, and without rancor. Let me say, as clearly as I can, that I believe race relations can be an appropriate issue for a political campaign. To pretend that people in our city don't discuss it is silly. But our politicians must discuss it as sensibly as most of our people do -- in their daily lives, and in their daily dealings, in the most diverse city in the world. If you want to play the race card, then you should deal the whole deck. Lay out your plan on how to improve race relations in our city.",1993-11-01T05:00:00+0000

Down by the Riverside","J. M. W. Turner is perhaps best known for his alchemical fusings of fire and water, sky and sea, in spectacular atmospheric images in which solid forms, be they ships or castles, seem nearly to dissolve in light and color. To different critics at different times, his monumental canvases have prefigured a range of later styles, from Impressionism to Abstract Expressionism. But it is not the more familiar, grand pictures -- of Parliament on fire or Trafalgar battleships -- that are the main subject of this small and charming book, TURNER ON THE THAMES: River Journeys in the Year 1805 (Yale University, $45). Instead, David Hill, an art historian at the University of Leeds, takes the reader on an intimate excursion into a small domain within Turner's work -- the many beautiful, serene sketches he made of the Thames in his first years at Syon Ferry House, which had a view of the river. During that time, Turner escaped from the entangled politics of London's art world, where the Royal Academy was marooned in petty disputes, to paint alfresco on the riverbanks. From his boat, he made oil paintings as well as watercolors; his lustrous oils are delightfully sensuous, with brush marks in thin paint following the grain of the mahogany boards. With an imagination primed with verses by Virgil and Dante (Turner had also been trying to write poetry), the painter transformed many of England's plain and rustic spots into classic idylls, as in ""Isis"" (1806). Painted at Weymouth, the canvas depicts an elegiac vista of arching trees silhouetted against a golden Italianate sky, with a silvery thread of water winding past. But the reader is not forever lost in Turner's ennobling vision; Mr. Hill's animated and meticulous descriptions of Turner's working methods, often including a contemporary photo of the landscape pictured, provide the perfect counterpoint to the artist's dreamy impressions of a great river on its seaward journey.SIRI HUNTOON",1993-11-07T05:00:00+0000

Last year our reviewer, John Casey, called it a synergy of the author's ""meditative social vision and storytelling immediacy, of her highly developed technical skill and of her alert heart."" JFK: Reckless Youth By Nigel Hamilton. Random House, $15. The first of a projected three-volume biography, this book covers the years from John F. Kennedy's birth, in 1917, to 1946, when he was first elected to office as a Massachusetts Congressman. ""By the very detail and depth of the revelations, the flashes of brilliance and consistency of insight, 'JFK: Reckless Youth' easily takes its place beside the best of recent Presidential portraits,"" Roger Morris said here last year. Random House has also reissued EYEBALL TO EYEBALL: The Inside Story of the Cuban Missile Crisis, by Dino A. Brugioni ($16), the supervisor of aerial reconnaissance photographs at the time. He demonstrates how important the new surveillance technology was to the denouement of the watershed foreign-policy event of the Kennedy Presidency. Last year our reviewer, Graham T.

NEXT ACTIVITY: Competing in the Virginia Slim's tournament at Madison Square Garden, which begins tomorrow. HOMES: Buenos Aires and Key Biscayne, Fla. Q. How is your game going? A. I'm playing very well. This year wasn't probably the best one. I didn't win any tournaments, and it was a little bit weird because I was sick at the beginning of the year. Q. What places are your favorites to play in? A. I love New York. But in Italy, the people go crazy. It seems like a soccer match, because they scream. They have signs with my name. They sing a song. Q. What kind of song? A. I don't know. Something where they mention my name. My family comes from Italy. My name is Italian. Q. Are the players on the tour still shaken up by the stabbing of Monica Seles? A. You know, when we go to play, we don't think about it. But you can find these people everywhere. It could happen any moment. We have to be very careful. Especially when we walk around in a tournament, there is always someone with me. Q. A personal bodyguard? A. No. The tournament provides someone. Q. How accepting are people of Martina Navratilova and other lesbian players on the circuit? A. I don't know how it was before, but right now each person does their own life. I go on and play and try to do my own life and be with my people. I like to go there and play and then leave. Q. What are you listening to these days? A. I like to listen to the radio, but I haven't found any good songs. Nothing new. I listen to soft rock like Phil Collins, Chicago, Air Supply, Jon Secada. I love music, and sometimes I like to write it down and then sing it, too. Q. Are you saying you'd like a second career as a pop singer? A. I would like to do something in the future, something with music. I don't know what's going to happen. My personal dream is to have a family, get married and have kids. Q. Do you really have two perfumes with your name? A. Yeah, we started with Gabriela Sabattini in 1989. For the first fragrance I chose the scent and the package and the colors. It was a lot of fun for me. Q. And for the second one? A. The second one is called Magnetic. For that I had to choose between two different scents. Q. Why did you choose the one you did? A. I don't know. It has different flowers, but it's not because of that. I just tried it on and I felt like it was going more with my personality. Q. How would you describe your personality? A. Publicly calm, very sensitive and honest. Q. And serious? A. No, not really, when I'm around people that I know.",1993-11-14T05:00:00+0000

Hey, Not on My Oscar!","Few movie stars could equal Rin Tin Tin's draw in the Depression, and no one escaped a cuddle for the publicity department with his or her dog or cat -- or one supplied by the studio. HOLLYWOOD DOGS and HOLLYWOOD CATS (Collins, each $14.95), two engaging photographic compilations edited by J. C. Suares, salute Tinseltown's hairiest hunks and heavies. Today some of the shots seem like witty parodies of certain stars' images. One publicity still catches Clark Gable on the set of ""Red Dust"" gazing deeply into the eyes of an adoring Irish setter. Another shows a creamy-complexioned Grace Kelly hoisting a kitten up to a bowl of actual cream. These images seem especially stagy when contrasted with the revealing at-home images rounded up by Mr. Suares, whose previous books include ""The Illustrated Cat"" and ""The Literary Dog."" There is a remarkably intimate portrait of a young Marlon Brando typing moodily with his cat draped around his shoulders. Another unlikely shot captures Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor holding their Lhasa apsos and their Pekingese aboard their yacht, where they lived during a 1971 London stay so their pets would not have to be quarantined. On-screen performances don't get stinted, although fans of Asta will have to settle for one classic checking-out-the-icebox picture from ""After the Thin Man."" Feline fans will savor the career of Orangey, Audrey Hepburn's irritable tabby co-star in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" who frequently had to be restrained from stalking off the set. Mr. Suares does not aim to be comprehensive. Still, no one who has ever owned a dog or cat -- or who has tangled with one -- should pass these books up.HANNA RUBIN",1993-11-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"Business Diary, November 7-12","THE ECONOMY Heeeere's Al! Heeeere's Ross! It's the Nafta Follies! It was the television equivalent of historical fiction. The subject was serious, but it had ""entertainment"" written all over it. As entertainment it scored: Last week's Gore-Perot ""chart wars"" (as a White House aide labeled it) drew the largest audience ever for a scheduled cable program. The subject was the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Ross Perot has gleefully blasted, but kernels of serious debate were hard to spot amid the charts, pictures and what were generously called facts. After the dust cleared, the battle raged hotter than ever for lawmakers' hearts as this week's House vote neared. Many Mexicans did not take kindly to Mr. Perot's depiction of a destitute country almost totally lacking in customers with enough money to buy American products. ""Before he opens his mouth,"" a Mexico City lawyer said, ""he ought to come down here and take a look."" And one newspaper termed Mr. Perot's comments a ""series of calumnies and lies."" Getting, Spending: A Balancing Act Lawmakers, by and large, decide how this nation gets and spends. If getting doesn't keep up with spending, it's clear where to point fingers. But many lawmakers are saying, in effect, ""We can't do it, so make us do it."" That's what a balanced-budget amendment comes down to. The idea creates some odd Senate bedfellows -- Paul Simon, liberal stalwart, who favors more getting (taxes), and Orrin Hatch, conservative extraordinaire, who advocates less spending. Cries are getting louder for a vote, but last week, bowing to Thanksgiving, its backers put it off till February. A Pass Is Just a Pass? No Way! The debate heats up daily: Where, in that vast gray area between leer and lunge, does sexual harassment lie? Several Federal courts have ruled that lawsuits should show workplace harassment so bad that it caused ""severe psychological injury."" Or, in effect, someone can shoot at you as long as you don't get hit. But last week the Supreme Court stepped in and stretched the definition considerably, ruling that harassment that creates a ""hostile and abusive"" environment is illegal. ""The time for strained legal arguments is over,"" said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center. Inflation: It's Gone! It's Back! Inflation was pronounced dead on Tuesday, but some people swore they saw it wink on Wednesday. First came a report that producer prices, having trended downward most of the year, fell another 0.2 percent in October. That provided reassurance that inflation had been tamed, and interest rates retreated. But then came news that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent, the most in six months. The main culprit was a higher gas tax, clearly a one-time blip, but rates headed up again. And the economy is stronger, as the numbers keep showing. On Friday came a report that October's retail sales had risen 1.5 percent, the biggest gain in six months. Slowing Down 10-Ton Speeders Speeding is a big killer on our highways, but it's all relative. A sports car tooling along at 80 is far less lethal than a 10-ton truck. So last week the Transportation Department proposed a ban on radar detectors in trucks over 18,000 pounds. Independent truckers don't like it -- any more than they like the higher diesel prices that spurred last week's protests -- but most other people do, so it will probably happen. Looking Joblessness in the Face Strong as some economic statistics are, they don't help those who are left behind as this nation goes through wrenching changes and dislocations. And their pain could be seen vividly last week on the streets of Detroit, a city that has had its insides torn out by the icy streamlining of the auto industry. Detroit's jobless -- the city's unemployment rate is 13 percent, twice the national rate -- are so hungry for decent work that thousands of them lined up in the cold dawn for jobs that may never exist. The very iffy jobs were advertised by sponsors of a casino in downtown Detroit to be owned by an Indian tribe in northern Michigan. The casino has slim chances of being approved, underscoring the job-seekers' desperation. But as one applicant said, ""There's nothing else happening but crime."" COMPANIES A Drug Maker Goes to the People Makers of prescription drugs have long stayed above the consumer fray, their prices untouched by the messiness of the marketplace. But pressures have mounted from all sides, whether it's Hillary Rodham Clinton scolding them for high prices or upstart generics turning the competitive screws. So, as in so much of the health care universe, times are changing. Last week, in a vivid demonstration of this shift, SmithKline Beecham said it would give $10 rebates for a month's supply of Tagamet, its big-selling ulcer drug. The company's patent on Tagamet runs out in May, and a generic version is on the way, so this could be a signal that name brands will try harder to hang onto their market. Instant Rival for Cellular Phones Wireless communications: two words that define a big slice of our future. But in the flick of an antenna, that future can take on a far different shape, as was proved last week when a relatively obscure company called Nextel Communications agreed to buy a bunch of mobile-radio licenses from Motorola for $1.8 billion in stock. Suddenly everyone looked at the numbers and realized that with the theoretical ability to serve 180 million people nationwide, Nextel had vaulted itself into a force that has to be taken very, very seriously by cellular phone companies. And Nextel, whose shares have quadrupled in a year, has an edge: In addition to voice conversations, it can offer built-in paging and data communications, which most cellular services don't offer. It faces a long, bumpy ride, though; the cellular industry has a huge head start. Going Hog-Wild Over a Chicken Some elf clearly went around Wall Street whispering ""rotisserie chicken"" in eager ears, because last week a lot of investors decided that was the place to put their money. When Boston Chicken, a franchiser, made an initial offering at $20 a share, so many investors scrambled for feathers that when trading opened, the shares more than doubled, ending at $48.50. The shares passed through a lot of hands that day: The offering had just over 2 million shares, but volume was 8.4 million. Investors' ardor cooled by Friday, and the stock slid to $39.75. Paramount Does Its Own Buying Bored with would-be buyers hammering on its door, Paramount made its own big-money acquisition last week. Paramount, which owns Simon & Schuster, agreed to pay $553 million for Macmillan, to create the world's No. 2 book publisher, after Bertelsmann. And whether it's method or madness, this adds a wrinkle to the Paramount war. The book deal is so big it already raises antitrust flags, but if QVC wins Paramount, the antitrust issue gets even thornier: Advance Publications, owner of Random House, is backing QVC. And let's not forget the latest bulletin on Paramount's dance card: BellSouth has agreed to slip $1.5 billion into QVC's pocket as QVC courts the popular studio. INTERNATIONAL Haiti's Children Pay the Price When Americans hear of the oil embargo and other sanctions against Haiti, their mental image may well be of Haiti's military rulers holed up in a bunker, isolated by rising international pressure. The reality might be far more cruel. Harvard public health experts said in a study last week that the sanctions are killing as many as 1,000 Haitian children each month. As another, less painful tack, the Administration is trying to get other nations' support for freezing overseas assets of Haiti's leaders. Starving children might prefer that. Disney's French Albatross The Walt Disney Company is probably wishing it had never tried to translate its magic formula into French. Disney is taking in plenty of money back home, but Euro Disney, clearly the victim of a sorcerer's curse, just drains away the profits. Last week, in fact, Euro Disney -- 49 percent-owned by Disney -- reported a $900 million yearly loss, dragging Disney itself into a quarterly deficit. If it doesn't get fresh cash, Euro Disney said it would face a ""liquidity problem"" (that's American for ""no money""). While banks might fear throwing good money after bad, Disney has too much at stake to walk away. Can Japan's Doors Be Opened? Japan's economy has long been a prime American target. The goods flow out, we say, but tight regulations keep them from flowing in, giving a nasty tilt to the trade balance. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, three months in office, is determined to hack away at that regulatory wall. Last week a panel he appointed called for easing or ending hundreds of regulations, and even, in a nation built on monopolies, advocated strict application of anti-monopoly laws. So Mr. Hosokawa now has a snazzy bouquet to offer President Clinton when they meet in Seattle this week. But it remains to be seen whether he'll really be able to nudge Japan toward freer markets.",1993-11-14T05:00:00+0000

Sadly, most books marketed today under the label of fantasy do a disservice to this proud etymology. Instead of fresh wonders made visible, fantasy as a commercial genre has come to mean endlessly recycled adventures of sword-wielding heroes and spell-casting wizards, recounted in a pseudopoetic prose as dreary and predictable as the characters and settings.

us,A New Framework for Health Care,"To control medical costs and provide secure coverage to all, President Clinton has proposed a vast restructuring of the health care system, to be phased in over several years. The proposal would use financial incentives to encourage consumers to join low-cost health maintenance organizations, and would push doctors, hospitals and insurers to join toether in networks. The strategy is to make consumers conscious of the ture cost of their care and, by fostering competition among plans, to force the plans to cut costs and offer better service. If competition does not drive down costs, mandatory ceilings on the growth of insurance premiums would aim to keep total spending in line with the growth of the economy. THE OVERSEER A seven-member National Health Board, appointed by the President, would monitor state compliance and the functioning of health alliances, interpret the standard benefit package and make recommendations about new benefits to reflect changing technology and needs, and set regional medical spending ceilings. It would develop indicators ofthe quality of service and care offered by health plans and publicize the results to promote informed consumer choices. A committee would monitor drug prices, raising questions to the pharmaceutical companies about those drugs it deems unreasonably expensive. THE PAYERS Employers: Would pay the bulk of the cost. The plan requires them to pay at least 80 percent of the average cost of premiums in thier region, and to support family coverage for married workers. Employee: Would contribute an average of 20 percent toward their own insurance premiums, plus any required deductibles or co-payments. Self-Employed and Nonworkers: Would be required to buy insurance, paying the full cost of premiums, unless they qualify for government subsidies. The cost would be fully tax deductible. Currently only 25 percent of the cost is tax deductible. Government: Would subsidize costs for many small and low-wage businesses and for individuals (like part-time workers and the unemployed) who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Medicare payments would continue for the elderly and disabled. Medicaid would continue to pay for the poor, but through health alliances. Large Corporations: Would have the option to negotiate directly with insurers for their employees' coverage, but would still be required to pay at least 80 percent of employees' premiums. THE BROKERS Health Alliances: The core of the plan. Run by the states under Federal scrutiny, these regional purchasing groups would collect and distribute premiums, certify health plans and offer them to consumers, insure that average premiums grow no faster than Federally set limits, collect and publish data on performance of health plans and negotiate with local doctors and hospitals to set fees for services provided outside H.M.O.'s Access: All citizens and legal resident would be covered. Cost: Alliances would determine a target range for average premiums charged by plans in its area. Plans would not be eligible if their charges were higher than the range. Eligible Plans: Alliances would write a contract with any plan that met state requirements. Options: Alliances would offer a range of medical plans of three types: an H.M.O., a fee-for-service plan, or a combination of the two. Patients could not be turned away unless a plan is overshubscribed. Quality: Allance would publich information to help consumers compare the service and the medical perfomance of various plans. Size: Alliance size would be based on population, so the number of alliances in each state would vary. Structure: Alliance structure would be determined by states. Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance Corporate Alliances: If these employers decided to negotiate directly with insurers and form their won alliances, they would still have to offer the guaranteed benefits package and a choice of plans, though their employees might have fewer providers to choose from. THE OPTIONS Most alliances would offer a large selection of plans, but all must include at least one fee-for-service options offering free choice of doctors. The administration estimates that the average plan cost would be $1,932 a year for an individual and $4,360 for a family, but costs would vary by region. Plans of any type would vary in price; people choosing costlier ones would pay a higher share of premiums. Plans could offer supplemental policies, covering items like extra dental or mental health benefits; employers could choose to pay for these or consumers could buy them with after-tax dollars. H.M.O.: The least-expensive option. Patients sign up with a health maintenance organization and only consult doctors affiliated with that organization. Subsribers typically pay only $10 for an office visit. If they visit a doctor outside the plan, they pay a share of the bill. Combination Plan: The middle option. Patients sign up with a group for most of their care, but reserve the right to consult outside doctors by paying 20 percent of the fee for those visits. Fee For Service: The most expensive option, offering the widest choice of doctors. Patients can see any doctor they choose, but must pay deductibles ($200 for an individual and $400 for a family) and 20 percent of the cost of office visits and hospitalization, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. THE BENEFITS All Americans would be issued a ""health security card"" that would enable them to receive the guaranteed benefits listed below. Dental: Most care for children. Adult preventive benefits phased in by 2000. Drugs: Prescriptions Eye & Ear: Routing vision and hearing examinations; eyeglasses for children only. Extended Care: Nursing homes or rehabilitation centers (as an alternative to hospital stays). Maximum of 100 days each year. Home Care: As an alternative to hospitalization; re-evaluated every 60 days. Hospice Care: For terminally-ill people. Hospital Stays: Semi-private room; private rooms only when medically necessary. Mental Health: Limited psychotherapy; limited inpatient services and psychiatric hospital stays. Office Visits: Professional services, emergency care and other outpatient hospital services; laboratory tests and ambulance. Medical Equipment: Braces, artificial limbs or prosthetic devices, when equipment improves functional abilities or prevents futher deterioration. Outpatient Therapy: Physical, occupational or speech therapy to restore skills lost from illness or injury. Re-evaluated every 60 days. Preventive care: Immunizations, mammograms, Pap smears, prenatal care and cholesterol screening. Substance Abuse: Limited outpatient and inpatient services. The plan excludes services that are not ""medically necessary or appropraite,"" citing cosmetic orthodontia, hearing aids, contact lenses, sex-change surgery and in-vitro fertilization as examples of such services.

This book chronicles four days and nights in November 1965, when American soldiers in the central highlands of Vietnam endured what proved to be the bloodiest campaign of the war. It was also an experience that was emblematic of the entire conflict: the United States used new technological weaponry, only to be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers and persistence of the enemy. Written by a retired officer and a journalist who were there, the book reveals ""equal rations of pride and anguish, and it goes as far as any book yet written toward answering the hoary question of what combat is really like,"" Nicholas Proffitt said here last year. Also reissued is THE TRAGEDY OF CAMBODIAN HISTORY: Politics, War, and Revolution Since 1945, by David P.

us,The Crowd in the Suitcase,"""Language, Thought and Reality"" By Benjamin Lee Whorf Where words travel, can the heart be far behind? I like to pack friendly minds in my luggage when I take long journeys. They're books I've read before, and I don't always read them on each trip; I just like their companionship. Isak Dinesen is a favorite, especially her ""Out of Africa,"" because her delicate insights about people and her precise descriptions of nature make Africa shiver in my imagination. I also like Albert Camus's ""Lyrical and Critical Essays,"" in which he poignantly observes North Africa and the young men of Algiers, who gamble everything on the flesh, knowing in the end that they must lose. Antoine de Saint-Exupery's ""Wind, Sand and Stars"" charms me with its youthful, ebullient mysticism of desert and sky, and its impromptu survival tips. Who knows when I may crash-land far from water -- best to learn how to collect dew on a tautly tied parachute. I never tire of Emerson's ""Essays,"" which really are rambling walks through the New England countryside. They strike a perfect balance between the sacred and the profane, and they include so many sprightly images and epigrams to pause and think about.",1993-11-14T05:00:00+0000

Love and Couples both played on the American Ryder Cup team, and Couples was a member of the three-man American team that won the Dunhill Cup. The other team triumph was in amateur play, in the Walker Cup. This one came with something approaching ease. The Americans led after all four rounds, held a three-shot advantage when play started on the final round and won by four strokes over the Zimbabwe team with a 20-under-par total of 556. The Americans led by a minimum of two shots throughout the final round and were never in danger. (AP) Funk Wins as Daly Loses Big: Fred Funk, who received a good lie when his wedge shot on the closing hole hit a spectator, shot a two-under-par 70 yesterday and won the Mexican Open by a stroke. John Daly, playing in his first tournament since his latest suspension from the PGA Tour, finished 25 strokes behind the leader. (AP) TENNIS Sampras Still No. 1 Pete Sampras overwhelmed Magnus Gustafsson, 6-1, 6-4, yesterday in Antwerp, Belgium, to win the European Community Championships, assuring the American he will remain the world's No. 1 player this year. The victory in the $1.11 million tournament was Sampras's eighth title in 1993 and gave him an edge of more than 500 points in the ATP Tour rankings, making it impossible for his closest challenger, fellow American Jim Courier, to make up the difference next week in the season final -- the ATP finals in Frankfurt.

Giuliani is choosing a strategy that many cities, from Boston to San Diego, have abandoned as costly and ineffective. Although their experience is by no means universal, many cities found that aggressive arrest policies not only failed to ease the drug problem, police officials and crime experts say, but have also overloaded the courts and jails, often providing little punishment.

As his dear friend Howard L. Bingham, a photographer, has said: ""He was born for the camera. . . . No one in the world has a face like Ali."" For MUHAMMAD ALI: A Thirty-Year Journey (Simon & Schuster, $32.50), Mr. Bingham has selected nearly 200 black-and-white photographs from the one million pictures he has taken of Ali since 1962. The book, like its subject, is exceptional. It includes a fair number of ringside photos, but we also see Ali hanging out in Harlem with Sugar Ray Robinson and Roy Campanella; having his snapshot taken by Malcolm X and his ear bent by Jesse Jackson; playfully sneaking up on the ferocious Sonny Liston in a Miami bar in 1963 (even Elijah Muhammad picked Liston to win their fight the following year); and just generally having a good time, with folks sublime (Duke Ellington, Sam Cooke) and ridiculous (Sonny Bono, Don Knotts). When Wilfrid Sheed was writing the text for a picture book on Ali two decades ago, he pored over thousands of photographs and never came upon a single nasty one. Ali looks angry only once in Mr. Bingham's book, on the day in 1967 when he was indicted for refusing induction into the armed forces. Yet the man who had no quarrel with the Vietcong never seemed to hold a grudge against anybody, not even the bigots and boobs who kept him out of boxing for three and a half years and made sure that no one would see the athlete of the century at his peak. In the private, quiet moments depicted here, past and present, Ali comes across as too nice, too gentle, for bitterness. He used to brag that he could hospitalize a brick. He could probably get one to crack a smile too. DAVID KELLY",1993-11-21T05:00:00+0000

us,HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL REPORT,"Scouting the Top Teams Here are the scouting reports for today's high school playoff games involving teams in the Public Schools Athletic League, and Westchester and Rockland Counties. P.S.A.L. Adams (8-3) at Lincoln (9-0), A Semifinals, 12 P.M. Key Players: The Adams defenders, led by linebackers Jerry Corollo and Frank LoMonaco, will have to play the game of their lives if they hope to stop the city's best runner, Frankie Sinclair (133 carries for 1,361 yards and 23 touchdowns), and one of the metropolitan area's top quarterbacks, Corey Valentine (32 of 70 for 887 yards, 14 touchdowns). The Railsplitters' defense, paced by linebackers Jeff Miller (58 tackles, 2 sacks) and Mark Navarette (58 tackles), is not too shabby, either, having shut out its opponents six times this season. The defensive unit goes by the nickname G-Men, after the defensive coordinator, Ed Grezinski. The Adams wing-T offense is led by fullback Michael Richardson. Comment: ""It's a very difficult task to stop all their weapons,"" said Adams Coach Angelo Palumbo. ""We just hope that they don't embarrass us."" Lehman (8-1) at Canarsie (9-0), A Semifinals, 12 P.M. Key Players: Although Robert Talley (142 carries for 1,142) is one of the best backs in the city, Lehman can't expect him to run successfully against a Canarsie defense that has allowed only 27 points. Quarterback Willie Nelson (40 of 80 for 375 yards, 2 touchdowns) is going to have to throw the ball downfield to Larry Belton and Kevin Reavis if Lehman expects to score on a defense that has registered five shutouts. Sam Shehadeh (more than 100 tackles, and 7 sacks), Ernest Coakley (12 sacks), Cory Patterson (5 interceptions) and Lance Schulters (4 interceptions, including 2 for touchdowns) are the Chiefs' mainstays on defense. Offensively, Canarsie plays a ball-control offense with Schulters (104 carries for 868 yards, 14 touchdowns) and Eric Smith (130 carries for 1,134 yards, 11 touchdowns), usually wearing the opponents down. Comment: Lehman and Canarsie have met in the semifinals for the last two years, with Lehman winning both games: 24-6 last year and 18-12 in 1991. Fort Hamilton (9-0) vs. Flushing (9-1), B final at Midwood Field, 12 P.M. Key Players: Fort Hamilton Coach Vincent Laino said that the biggest question in this matchup is whether his team can cope with Ashley Thomas's speed. ""He's just a sensational runner,"" said Laino of the back, who has rushed for 1,100 yards and 19 touchdowns this season. ""We're not all that quick defensively. We're more of an attack defense."" Fort Hamilton's defensive unit is led by linebacker Jimmy Koutroumanos (100 tackles) and tackle Joe Barbieri, who averages 7 tackles a game. On offense, the Tigers rely on running back Angelo LiCausi. Flushing's defense, which features linebacker Bienbenudo Hernandez (90 tackles), has not allowed a point in 14 quarters. The Red Devils' quarterback, Frank Joaquin, who is a native of the Dominican Republic, speaks little English. ""It's really amazing,"" said his coach, Mike Sarachek. ""We send the play in and somehow he manages to call it right every time."" Comment: Fort Hamilton, the P.S.A.L. B defending champion, played its first varsity football game against Flushing in 1991 and defeated the Red Devils, 22-8. Westchester and Rockland North Rockland (11-0) vs. Jamestown (10-2), Class A State Final, 8 P.M., at the Carrier Dome, Syracuse University. Key Players: North Rockland quarterback Jeff Becker has thrown 4 of his 9 scoring strikes to Chris Jackson. The Raiders' rushing attack is sparked by Marcus Larkins (822 yards and 11 touchdowns) and Rasson Wiley, who has rushed for more than 200 yards in each of his last four games. Jamestown, which is located south of Buffalo, has nine players on defense who weigh no more than 170 pounds. Anthony Cusimano, a 5-foot-5-inch, 140-pound defensive end, leads Jamestown's defensive unit, along with tackles Aaron Barnett (6-1, 167) and Jamie Bloomquist, who this past year wrestled at 119 pounds. Bloomquist has since bulked up to 167 pounds. ""They're like a bunch of rats running to a piece of cheese,"" said Jamestown Coach Wally Huckno of his undersize defense. Jamestown's offensive stars are quarterback Jim Barlow, who has passed for more than 700 yards, and tailback Jamie Nelson, who has rushed for 1,050 yards. Comment: The North Rockland-Jamestown game is the final game today at the Carrier Dome in the state's first playoff championship. The Class B final pits Chittenango (11-0) vs. Yorktown (10-1), at 5 P.M.; the Class C matches Rye (9-1) vs. Caledonia-Mumford (10-1), at 2 P.M., and the Class D features Tuckahoe (10-0) vs. Clyde-Savannah (11-1), at 11 A.M. All Eyes on Ornstein Gus Ornstein of Fieldston has set up two official college visits -- to Miami on Dec. 19 and to Syracuse in early January. Other schools interested in the 6-foot-5-inch, 205-pound quarterback are Brigham Young, Boston College, Notre Dame, Michigan and all of the Ivy League schools. Ornstein, a switch-hitting first baseman in baseball, has also been scouted by the Mets, the Chicago Cubs and the Colorado Rockies.",1993-11-27T05:00:00+0000

Delta Woodside posted earnings of $1.79 million, or 7 cents a share, in the quarter that ended on Oct. 2. The Alabama state court jury found that a former sales representative for Delta Woodside's Duck Head unit was wrongly denied $852,118 in sales commissions, Delta Woodside said. The jury tripled that amount and awarded the salesman, Ken Hoots, and two associates $2.6 million on their breach of contract claim.

My health rebounded, almost certainly because of AZT. I was doing so well; I really might beat it. Now, it is clear I will not. You can beat the statistics only so long. Mt T-cell count, which was only 2 when I got my diagnosis, has never gone above 30 - a dangerously low level. I have lived longer than the median survival time by 10 months. The treatments simply are not there. They are not even in the pipeline. A miracle is possible, of course. And for a long time, I though one would happen.

Troupe Tries to Make It in Tough Times","JO ANN STAUGAARD-JONESdid not set out to found a professional dance company 10 years ago on the campus of the County College of Morris, but somehow it happened.

And the trends behind their moves couldn't be clearer: Warner-Lambert, cutting 2,800 jobs, faces narrower drug profits in the great health care shakeout; Philip Morris, cutting 14,000, is facing up to a less-smoky society, and NCR, cutting 7,500, is adjusting to a shifting computer world.

us,American Exodus,"In 1941, at the age of 23, the artist Jacob Lawrence began documenting an epic chapter in the tortured story of American race relations. ""The Migration Series,"" a monumental project chronicling the mass movement northward of millions of Southern blacks seeking economic and political opportunity in the first three decades of the century, was the ambitious 60-painting cycle that resulted. Though every bit in step with the cultural revolution taking place in Harlem at the time, Mr. Lawrence owed much of his early success to the art dealer Edith Gregor Halper, who, after showing the panels in her Greenwich Village gallery, succeeded in selling half of the series to the Museum of Modern Art and the remaining paintings to the Phillips Collection in Washington. The Phillips has now reunited the paintings in a traveling exhibition for which it has produced this handsome catalog, JACOB LAWRENCE: The Migration Series (Rappahannock Press, 1627 I Street, Suite 610, Washington, D.C. 20006, $40), edited by the show's curator, Elizabeth Hutton Turner. Ten scholars, including Henry Louis Gates Jr., have contributed historical footnotes to Mr. Lawrence's career, as well as lucid commentary on the sources of the social and political conditions that gave rise to the mass black exodus north. Most telling, however, are the paintings themselves, which dramatize the story of the migration -- not only the hopes, fears and hardships of a people leaving home and friends for the unknown, but the anonymity and despair many experienced once they had arrived, finding tenement life, dead-end jobs, and a new form of racial discrimination based on custom rather than law. ""We are absolutely a people telling stories,"" Mr. Lawrence has said, a concept that he illustrates with particular grace in these eloquent paintings. ANDREA BARNET",1993-11-28T05:00:00+0000
