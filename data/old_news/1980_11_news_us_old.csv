And, like ''The Buddy Holly Story,'' it hinges on a central performance that is much better than the movie around it. Ray Sharkey, playing a rock Svengali in the days of Frankie and Bobby and Dion and Fabian, captures the drive and monomania of a man who shapes others' destinies rather than his own. In those days, it took looks to be a teen idol - or so the movie, with some cynicism, maintains. Mr. Sharkey's Vincent Vacarri is a man of talent, and so he becomes a manager instead of a star.

If one can say nothing else on behalf of ''Heaven's Gate'' (and I certainly can't), it's probably the first western to celebrate the role played by central and eastern Europeans in the settlement of the American West.

His knowledge of the world appears to have come exclusively from bad television situation comedies. ",1980-11-21T05:00:00+0000
