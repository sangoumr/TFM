us,Pabst's 'Paracelsus' a Handsome Film:The Cast,"""Paracelsus,"" which was shown at the First Avenue Screening Room last Sunday and will be repeated there at noon and midnight today and tomorrow, is a very special footnote to film and political history. Never before released in New York, it is the second film made by the great, supposedly left-wing German director, G. W. Pabst, after he returned to Nazi Germany just in time for World War II.Pabst, who died at the age of 82 in 1967, is a fascinating character, known as ""the red Pabst"" (Papst means pope in German) until he went back to Hitler's new German empire. His best films, including the silent ""Joyless Street"" with Greta Garbo and ""The Threepenny Opera"" (1931), are rather uproarious amalgams of stark realism, wild melodrama and pure poetry. Lots of elements in his films look dated today but also there is usually, something that looks totally new and surprising.""Paracelsus,"" considering when it was made (1943) and under what conditions, is a remarkably interesting film, though full of not especially well disguised propaganda. It's the story of Paracelsus, the 16th-century Swiss healer whose reputation took on a new vogue in the Germany of the early nineteen-forties. Nazi writers and intellectuals began to attribute all sorts of Nazi ideals to the mystic healer who had been ridiculed and oppressed for choosing to write in German instead of Latin and who had challenged the authority of vested (feudal) interests.With the exception of Werner Krauss, who plays Paracelsus as a sort of medieval Dr. Gillespie, crusty but kind, the acting is operatic. The screenplay is full of noble opinions about the German character and its ability to triumph over the ignorance of its enemies.The physical production, however, is astonishingly handsome. In addition, the movie contains one of Pabst's most magical scenes, in which Death, in the person of a juggler, enters a town in the siege of plague and invites the citizens to join him in a celebratory dance. Realism moves into fantasy (and back again) with less awkwardness than most other directors display when making a simple cut between two scenes in the same style.A further footnote to this footnote to history: after the war, Pabst went on to make other films, including ""The Trial"" (1949), about anti-Semitism in Hungary in 1882, but Werner Krauss was blacklisted, largely for his participation in the notorious ""Jud Siss.""",1974-11-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Open Season':A Film of Dull Sadism at Neighborhoods,"Perhaps there are only two kinds of sadism: lively or dull. Peter Collinson's ""Open Season's,"" which arrived yesterday at neighborhood theaters, features the phlegmatic sort and includes some of the most sluggish shootouts we've seen in ages. Three youngish war veterans indulge in a yearly ritual of kidnapping, abusing, then releasing and hunting down a random couple; one of them explains, ""After you've hunted men, animals just don't rate."" However, animals also get their due in this movie, when a child's wavery voice sings ""All things bright and beautiful, all creatures great and small"" while the veterans gun down the furred and feathered beings of the woods.The movie may be meant to strike a blow for humanity, but the message is drowned out by the laughter of the lawless trioin fact, the picture is an anthology of yuks. Cackling, giggling, whooping, gurgling, checking and howling, the old buddies appear to have harvested a sense of the ridiculous from the battlefield. Peter Fonda's talents are wasted throughout. He manages to look formidable at moments, but he mainly behaves like the jovial entertainment director at a resort camp, and he soon runs out of variations on the hahas and the o-ho-hos and the heh-heh-hehs.William Holden appears briefly in an early scene; you then spend the rest of the movie waiting for him to come back. Perhaps he was just visiting the set or taking a shortcut on his way to an appointment on the lot. A hundred minutes pass until you see his face again, although there are a few shots of his boots.Cornelia Sharpe is as bad at screaming as she is at running, and only Albert Mendozaas the male victimacts with any conviction; his bitter reserve does seem just right for the part. Without betraying the plot, it seems safe to voice the suspicion that a couple of the actors had clauses written into their contracts that permitted them to die quite slowly in close-up. Still, although ""Open Season"" is innocent of all suspense, it's not the very worst movie I've seen this year.",1974-11-02T05:00:00+0000

It's also about an innocent young composer named Winslow Leach (William Finley), whose music is stolen by Swan and who becomes the murderous phantom of Swan's new rock palace, the Paradise, after his head gets badly mashed in a record-pressing machine.At one point or another just about everybody in the film sells his soul to Swan (with much signing of heavy, thick legal documents in blood), including a pretty rock singer (Jessica Harper), the girl the Phantom loves and cherishes from afar.Mr. De Palma is a very funny man, as he has shown in marvelously eccentric comedies such as ""Greetings"" and ""Hi, Mom,"" and even in his more conventional films, ""Get to Know Your Local Rabbit"" and ""Sisters."" Compared with even the least of these, ""Phantom of the Paradise"" is an elaborate disaster, full of the kind of facetious humor you might find on bumper stickers and cocktail coasters.The movie spends much too much time just laying out the plot, which is fatal to parody of any sort. It also becomes quite enchanted with its own special photograpic effects, as well as with its bizarre sets, which, because there's very little of interest going on within them, become the mildly amusing surrogate subjects of the film.Almost redeeming the movie is the rock score, by Mr. Williams, and the comic orchestrations that trace the evolution of rock from the duck-tailed, surfing nineteen-fifties and sixties to the seventies and the triumphant emergence of androgyny. The concert scenes  filled with pandemonium, blinking lights and extraordinary soundsare well staged but hardly seem worth the terrific time and effort that must have been required. Almost any A.I.P. ""Beach"" picture or Vincent Price horror film, being the real thing, is funnier.",1974-11-02T05:00:00+0000

Several Government agencies are in on the search for the letter, which was hand delivered to Secretary of State Kissinger on Oct. 10, 1973. According to Mr. King, its disappearance was noted shortly after the former President, Richard M. Nixon, submitted his own resignation letter to Mr. Kissinger last August. Embarrassed officials of the National Archives had to report then that they could not find the original of the Agnew letter, although there were plenty of copies available.

When someone says that something is too highly complicated, her most likely response is, ""I'll highly complicate you on the seat of your pants.""It wouldn't be funny if anyone else said it, but we laugh with Moms in appreciation of her implacable, firmly unbudgeable stand in favor of common sense. The people around her never come up to her instep.""Amazing Grace,"" which opened at three theaters yesterday, keeps Moms on screen almost constantly, but it doesn't provide her with much material. Sometimes the camera just silently follows her as she moves around her house, or walks down a sidewalk, as if hoping she'll come up with a line or a bit of business that will save the day.

Australia, the world's largest producer of aluminum ore, is one of the founding members of the organization, along with Jamaica, Guyana, Surinam, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Yugoslavia.

Jamaica Example Cited Mr. Cairns said that the nations of the association however, might take a lead from Jamaica, which earlier this year imposed a 500 per cent increase in bauxiteexport royalties on the six United States and Canadian companies operating there. Jamaica supplies twothirds of the ore refined in the United States.

us,Screen: Chabrol's 'The Nada Gang' Is at Playboy:The Cast,"Why do anarchists in contemporary movies have to wear black broadbrimmed hats? Solving that minor mystery is essential to understanding the defects of Claude Chabrol's ""The Nada Gang,"" a muddled yet sometimes rewarding movie, which opened yesterday at the Playboy Theater.In Paris, a group of youthful terrorists kidnap the United States Ambassador to France, and the French Government responds with a scenario of overkill. The movie condemns the state even more fiercely than it does the outlaws; when the authorities consider sacrificing the hostage's life so that the public will lose its sympathy for the Left, the film thoroughly fulfills Mr. Chabrol's own conviction that ""the state prefers terrorism to revolution.""There are many fine scenes throughout the movieeach enhanced by impeccable cameraworkas when the stolid Ambassador is seized at a posh brothel while watching a barely veiled prostitute ape Salome, or when a getaway car overturns in a field of rippling wheat. And there are several good performancesnotably, Maurice Garrel as an aging professional revolutionary, a rueful cynic who alternates between being vulnerable or ruthless, wistful or hardheaded.But the trouble with the movieand here comes that hat againis that the pivotal character, the anarchist, is a joke figure. Played by Fabio Testi, he's all burning glances, flaring nostrils, and operatic gestures. Whereas the murderous police officer (Michel Aumont) is thoroughly believable, the Nada gang is mainly ludicrous. To portray them, the director grasps at clichs: those on the Left simply have to oversleep, guzzle booze in the morning and keep untidy homes.Although Mr. Chabrol deplores the group's tactics, he has some sympathy for its intentions. Yet he makes its members into political idiots; for example, the ransom demanded for the Ambassador serves no revolutionary purpose, it's just for ""the cause."" Also, because the script is sloppy, the film seems to equate dissidence with terrorism.Meanwhile, Mariangela Melato plays a creature who's almost obligatory in a movie of this kind: a rebellious swinger who has joined the revolution for sex, not politics, and who dramatizes her own self-hate by boasting that she's a whore. The actress, who doesn't equal her performances in Lina Wertmuller's films, does salvage moments of this hackneyed role with the ironic, level-eyed gaze that she used in ""The Seduction of Mimi.""Mr. Chabrol has chosen a milieu that's just too alien for him, as the absurdity of the film's conclusion proves. While most of his terrorists are middle class, they're too far removed from the bourgeoisie that he understands so well. Still, he has achieved an elegant blast at corrupt authority, even though he has muffed the characterization of its enemies or critics.",1974-11-07T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Warehouse':Japanese Import Opens at Screening Room,"A romance involving dismemberment may seem about as likely as a caper concerning castration, but the first half of Yasuzo Masumura's ""Warehouse,"" which is playing today and tomorrow at the First Avenue Screening Room, sustains an eerie interest. In Tokyo, a blind sculptor and his mother kidnap a model. They keep her prisoner in a warehouse adorned with his sculptures of gigantic eyes, mouths, noses, breasts, arms, legs, and torsosall of which he re-created from the bodies that he handled as a professional masseur.This movie recalls ""The Collector,"" especially when the kidnapper is enraged by the frantic victim's efforts to escape. He wants to sculpture her through touch; after infinite struggles, she capitulates, while taunting him for his virginity and for being his ""mother's toy."" The frightening sensitivity of the blind man is well conveyed, along with the claustrophobia induced by his huge darkened studio. And the respectable appearance of his portly motherwho abets his every lunacy  bestows a background of normalcy that strengthens the obsessions of the picture.However, the film turns clownish toward its conclusion, when the ill-mated pair become lovers, then take bites out of each other's shoulders and hack each other up with knives. (All this occurs on a 70-foot reclining rubber nude.) The woman becomes a raving pain buff, and the movie eventually suggests an Oriental parody of ""The Night Porter."" Subtitles enhance the action: ""Listen, I have a dandy idea!"", she exclaimsand then urges her rather reluctant admirer to chop off her arms and legs. He quite rationally says, ""Why?""The camera is tactfully averted from the ensuing carpentry: we simply hear some heavy thumps and ecstatic howls as she's converted to a torso. He asks if she's happy, while in a voiceover narration, she praises ""the world of the tactual sense,"" ""Warehouse,"" which was called ""Blind Beast"" in Japan, may not grip your emotions, but it certainly clutches your attention. Still, it's a trifle hard to know just whom this movie will satisfyapart from sentimental surgeons.",1974-11-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Little Prince':An Exasperating Film at the Music Hall,"""The Little Prince,"" based on the late Antoine de Saint-Exupry's fable, is a very exasperating experience. It's the kind of movie that refers to adults as grown-ups to show us where it means its sympathies to be. Yet it's too abstract and sophisticated to be of interest to most children, and too simple-mindedly mystic and smug to charm even the most indulgent adult. You don't have to be W.C. Fields to want to swat it.More exasperating is that it's the first film musical in years to be directed by Stanley Donen, who has made some of the best (""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""Fusny Face""), and its book and lyrics are by Alan Jay Lerner and its music is by Frederick Loewe. This score, the first Lerner-Loewe collaboration since ""Gigi"" and ""Camelot,"" is full of lovely things that are a total waste in these barren circumstances.The film opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall.I doubt that anyone could make a really satisfactory movie out of the tiny Saint Exupry book, a fable about a pilot who crash-lands in the Sahara where, while he repairs his plane, he is befriended by a small extraterrestrial boy who happens to be on a sight-seeing tour of the universe.The pilot and the Little Prince talk at great length. The Little Prince reports on his own planet (which is the size of a house) and his earlier encounters on other planets with facetious caricatures, (all of which we see), but nothing much happens. So little happens, in fact, that the movie, which is stretched out with the Lerner-Loewe music, lasts only 88 minutes and seems at least five times that long.Even though ""The Little Prince"" is virtually a two-man musical supplemented by specialty numbers by a handful of other performers, it's been given the big movie-musical treatment (including a location trip to Tunisia), which simply emphasizes the coyness of its philosophy and the desperation of actors who never seem to know what kind of movie they're making.When Richard Kiley, who plays the pilot, races across the Sahara singing (in very good voice) a new Lerner-Loewe love song, Mr. Donen photographs him from what seems to have been a swooping helicopter. The song will sound great in the soundtrack album, but the actor, seen alternately in long shots and close-ups, appears to have lost his mind.Six-year-old Steven Warner, who plays the Little Prince, is a sweet-looking child who bears a strong resemblance to the original Saint-Exupry illustrations (the best things in the book), but since he is never more than a sweet-looking child, it's difficult to understand how he could prompt the stereophonic passions of the score. He has a delightful laugh, but the way things are done these days I wondered if it might be Mercedes McCambridge.Bob Fosse, an extraordinarily talented actor-director-dancer-choreographer, shows up ino in one sequence as the personification of the poisonous snake who finally provides the Little Prince with transportation home. What a child might make of this scene I can't imagine; Mr. Fosse, dressed like a 19th-century Chicago pimp, dances around the Sahara in those marvelously eccentric movements that look great when done by Gwen Verdon but embarrassing in this context.Less peculiar but not much more effective is Gene Wilder as a fox who hands on to the Little Prince one of the nuggets of wisdom that is supposed to make the movie meaningful. What is essential, says the fox, is invisible to the eye. Another variation is that ""it's only with the heart that one can see clearly.""This is the sort of gimcracky wisdom that only a self-absorbed adult could conceive of as being comprehensible to a child. When children imagine things, they see them. There is no nonsense about it. The imagined things are invisible only to jaded adults who patronize children and childhood, either because the real world is too much for them or because they don't know better.In addition to the score, particularly a song called ""I've Never Loved a Rose,"" there are some other isolated good things in the movie, including the opening sequence in which a small boy tries to convince his elders that a picture he has drawn is not of a hat but the silhouette of a snake that has swallowed an elephant.There are lots of pleasures that children and adults can share: zoos, circuses, ""Alice in Wonderland,"" Charlie Brown, roller coasters, hot dogs between meals. ""The Little Prince"" is not one of them.",1974-11-08T05:00:00+0000

George Sarret (Michel Piccoli) is a former World War I hero, now a lawyer with a way of seizing the unexpected opportunity at a moment's notice.When Philomene and Catherine enter his life, George begins to plan things with care. He premeditates. He is the architect of what becomes their (mostly) astonishing good fortune. Their game: insurance fraud and murder.""Le Trio Infernal,"" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie Theater, is an elegantly acted, handsome-looking French film, a macabre comedy with serious intentions that ultimately prevent it from being as funny as one longs for it to be.Philomene and George are made for each other, both being ambitious, calculating, venal and, when the occasion requires, horrendously vicious. Compared with these two, Catherine, the younger sister, is an old-fashioned sentimentalist.She doesn't mind sharing George with Philomene, and she doesn't object to George's marrying each of them off in turn to an elderly husband who is then quickly insured and dispatched in one way or anotherHowever, Catherine does become all weepy on Christmas Eve, when George, strictly according to plan, shoots their two dinner guests, a pushy, opinionated, overfed pawnbroker (Andrea Ferreol) and the pawnbroker's timid lover (Hubert Deschamps).Catherine becomes so upset she can hardly help lug the bodies up to the bathroom, where they are to be dissolved in sulphuric acid. A couple of days later, when it's time to ladle the contents out of each bathtub, Catherine gets sick to her stomach. In the context of these goings-on, Catherine is a silly goose.""Le Trio Infernal"" is the first feature to be directed by a new French director named Francis Girod, who also collaborated with Jacques Rouffio on the screenplay, adapted from a novel by Solange Fasquelle. He clearly is a director of talent, though not just because the film looks so good.After ""The Conformist,"" ""Stavisky,"" ""Love and Anarchy"" and ""Amarcord,"" all thirties movies are beginning to look alike, if only because of the marceled hair, the slashing red lipstick and the vintage motor cars.Mr. Girod scores his success with his actors. For the first time in years, I was convinced that Romy Schneider is an actress of wit, capable of expressing all kinds of feelings simultaneously. Mr. Piccoli may have played this sort of role before, but he has never done it with such cold, comic, vain precision. Miss Gomska, who looks enough like Miss Schneider really to be her sister, expresses a kind of vestigial decency that finally seems to be what the film is all about.That is, if the film is about anything at all, and I'm not sure it is.Because of the emphasis the director places on grotesque though not really shocking details, he seems to be inviting us to interpret the film as some kind of extravagant comment on France (or Europe) midway between two extraordinary cataclysms. These details aren't funny. Neither are they interesting enough clinically to justify their inclusion in the movie. The tone is confused rather than ambiguous in the way that would allow us to appreciate it on several levels at once.",1974-11-09T05:00:00+0000

us,An Unpolished 'Window Cleaner',"Since the British film industry has been gutted by the economy and so very few English movies are being made at all, it's painful to report that Val Guest's ""Confessions of a Window Cleaner"" should be avoided. Oozing with a horrible jauntiness, this feeble sex farce is also very old-fashioned. Set in a world of birds and dollies, it reeks of something that Time magazine once called Swinging London, and even the miniskirts are out of date. The movie opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.A winsome window washer (Robin Askwith), who has a lovable tendency to shatter glass, manages to hit the hay with most of his female clients while wrestling with the difficulties of seducing a voluptuous young policewoman. The script strains hard for wit, as when someone brings home a stuffed moose head and all his relatives say ""Oh, God."" Then they promptly name it Clarence. But of course it falls off the wall. Even so, the picture would be no more than momentarily depressing if the cast didn't include some veteran English character actors, such as John le Mesurier, Dandy Nichols and Richard Wattis. Their dignified presence yields a bleak reminder that movie work is scarce in England now.",1974-11-09T05:00:00+0000

Unlike the small town, where a person is a known and fixed quantity, the city is a place where you can assume a pose without easily being found out. In Raban's words, most people are hidden most of the time, their appearances are brief and controlled, their movements secret, the outlines of their lives obscure.",1974-11-10T05:00:00+0000

SLR's not only offer easy lens interchangeability, they also enable the photographer to actually see through the lens while focusing and composing. Thus, in a direct way, the SLR camera is an extension of the photographer's eye and by using lenses with different optical characteristics his or her vision can be extended and amplified in interesting waysand therein lies the answer to the second question: What can these lenses do for the photographer? Lenses for SLR cameras can be divided into five basic categories: normal lenses, wide angles, longfocus or tele lenses, zoom lenses, and macro lenses.",1974-11-10T05:00:00+0000

There have been a lot of words written about rock but the first book to express the subliminal content of the music in pictures is Rock Dreams, a collection of combined photographs and paintings in full color by a Belgian artist named Guy Peellaert. The paintings, on which Mr. Peellaert labored for three years, are a stylistic melange of camp, kitsch, pop art and even a little Norman Rockwell, if you can imagine a stoned Norman Rockwell (may The Saturday Evening Post strike us dead for that thought). Using his own dreams in some cases, Mr. Peellaert has draped the private lives and public images of a galaxy of rock stars from Bill Haley to Marc Bolan in fantasy, Rock Dreams unlocks the collective subconscious of the rock fan, spewing out an iconography of rocka pantheon of heroes and heroines swimming in the floating world of changing fads. There is Elvis Presley (in a bathing suit) kneeling before an image of the Virgin, thanking her for the success of Crying in the Chapel, Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello at a beach party, the Beatles having tea with the Queen, the Rolling Stones in Nazi uniforms entertaining prepubescent girls. Mr. Peellaert ranges from parody of Pat Boone's whitebuck wholesomeness to a sick joke (Stevie Wonder as a blind beggar in front of the Apollo Theater) to a stark picture of Janis Joplin sprawled on a bed in an empty room.

And yet no comparable musician of our era has ever had his musical esthetics so consistently challenged. In fact, to anyone who reads serious record criticismthe only way to get a steady bead on the conductor these days since his appearances in America are infrequentit might seem downright perverse for the international music community to hold him in such awe.",1974-11-10T05:00:00+0000

Professor Hugh TrevorRoper, the author of The Last Days of Hitler, called him a molelike creature, who seemed to avoid the glare of daylight and publicity. Hitler's chief of intelligence, Walter Schellenberg, concentrating rather on Bormann's external appearance, thought that he resembled a pig in a potato field. At the end ofthe Second World War Bormann disappeared in the ruins of Berlin during the final stages of the futile Nazi defense of the old Reich capital against the Red Army. Although generally presumed to be dead, he was sentenced to death in absentia by the international war crimes tribunal at Nuremberg on Oct, 1, 1946. For nearly 30 years since then the circumstances of his death, or survival, have remained shrouded in mystery.",1974-11-10T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Lenny,' With Dustin Hoffman, Is One --Fourth Brilliant","""Lenny,"" Bob Fosse's film version of Julian Barry's Broadway play about the life, assorted trials and death in 1966 of Lenny Bruce, looks to be about three-fourths dramatized biography and one-fourth recreated stage performances.These scenes trace Lenny's progression from the early nineteen-fifties, when he was a strip-joint comic (Customer: ""Do you sell alligator shoes?"" Salesman: ""What size does your alligator wear?""), to Lenny's last exhausted years, when, after successive police busts for drugs and obscenity, he had reduced his nightclub act to obsessive readings from the court records.This one-fourth of the film is so brilliantand so brilliantly acted by Dustin Hoffmanthat it helps cool one's impatience with the rest of the film, which is much more fancily edited and photographed but no more profound than those old movie biographies Jack L. Warner used to grind out about people like George Gershwin, Mark Twain and Dr. Ehrlich. In movies, now as then, genius is principally defined by the amount of time spent dealing with disappointment.""Lenny,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema One, has the advantage of being able to present a lot of the original Lenny Bruce material, even the material that just a few years ago got him arrested here and in San Francisco. The movie also has an advantage in that much of this material still has some shock value in its dependence on rude 4-letter and 10-letter words and on rude allusions to sacred events (the Crucifixion) and sacred people (Eleanor Roosevelt, Pope John XIII).However, ""Lenny"" is never very precise about what happened to Lenny or why. Unless you've read the Albert Goldman-Lawrence Schiller biography, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, Lenny Bruce!!"" you might get the impression from the film that the desperation of Lenny's last years, as well as his death, were the exclusive result of harassment by the police and the courts and that Lenny had no role in his own collapse.Ironically the form of the movie only serves to emphasize this fuzziness. Mr. Barry's screenplay is in the shape of a series of overlapping interviews with Lenny's former wife, Honey (Valerie Perrine); his mother, Sally Marr (Jan Miner), and his agent (Stanley Beck), which, in turn, cue in the flashbacks.These interviews are full of phony, simulated cinma vrit-type irrelevancies in speech and manner that you never for a minute believe, any more than you believe that Lenny was just a sweet brilliant fellow who had some hard luck.The movie makes no point of Lenny's terrible childhood or his ambivalent feelings toward his father. His mother, the sometimes nightclub comic and emcee, is, as played by Miss Miner, a good deal less bizarre than Portnoy's, and Honey, as played by Miss Perrine, is about as voracious as a Goldilocks with a big habit for porridge.Honey's affairs with other women, accepted and sometimes encouraged by Lenny, are touched upon so gently as to seem of little imporance, as is Lenny's dependence on drugs, taken in such massive doses that he seems to have been a mental as well as physical wreck toward the end.Such vagueness, probably prompted by the producer's necessity to have the legal approval of both Honey and Sally Marr, denies the actors a lot of material that would have enriched their performances. Mr. Hoffman is such an interesting actor that he goes a long way toward filling in the gaps, but the others are not so fortunate. Miss Perrine is immensely effective in individual scenes but the character remains a cipher. Miss Miner is the gold-hearted stereotype.Mr. Fosse, the director of ""Cabaret,"" is also inhibited here. The production, photographed in glorious black-and-white, has a fine, seedy look but this, after all, is just more description. Was Lenny truly some kind of mad prophet or simply an accidental product of his times, which, though he died in 1966, were really the gung-ho nineteen-forties and the uptight fifties? It's to the film's credit that it raises this question, though it doesn't supply us with much information with which to answer it.",1974-11-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Trial of Billy Jack,' a Sequel:More or Less a Rerun of the 1971 Success","""The Trial of Billy Jack"" is nearly three hours of naivet"" merchandised and marketed with the not-so-innocent vengeance that I associate with religious movements that take leases on places like the Houston Astrodome.The film, which opened at theaters around town yesterday, is the sequel to the hugely successful ""Billy Jack"" and is more or less a rerun of the kind of things that happened in that 1971 film. It's part pageant, part kung fu action film, part Western, part earnest civics lesson, part Show Boat melodrama, part recollection of the various horrors of the late nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies updated (sometimes desperately) to make contact with today.Like ""The Little Prince,"" it places a heavy philosophical load on the old ticker. ""That's the trouble,"" says a character at one point, ""you always try to understand with your head. You don't listen to your heart."" Brains are getting it in the neck in the new movies.""The Trial of Billy Jack,"" like the original film, is about the good-doing Indian half-breed, Billy Jack (Tom Laughlin), who has a lot of Bruce Lee, Robin Hood, Cochise and Jesus in him. (It's no accident that the film contains a song that asks ""Are You Dying Just for Me, Billy Jack?"" and seems to expect an affirmative reply.)It's also about Jean Roberts (Delores Taylor), who is beloved (usually from afar) by Billy Jack and runs the Freedom School, somewhere near Arizona's Monument Valley, where flower children left over from the sixties edit ""Nader-like periodicals and newspapers"" that expose Big Government and Big Business.The narrative, which has a gargantuan clumsiness to it that some critics have professed to find endearing, though it strikes me as aggressively dumb, picks up the story of Billy Jack where the first film left off. Billy Jack gets out of prison and returns to the Freedom School, which has had such success with its exposs that not only the local bigots but also the rascals in Washington try to crush the school. In between rap sessions on child abuse and the rights of American Indians, the melodrama accumulates (it certainly doesn't mount), climaxing in a Kent State-like attack on the school by members of the National Guard.It would be easier to accept the film's good intentions if the movie weren't so schizoid that one can't be at all sure what its intentions really are.Though it means to preach nonviolence, the only scenes of any interest are the violent ones, and always violence shows up as the only meaningful way to deal with evil.We are told that the Freedom School kids have successfully exposed the oil industry's influence on Washington, yet the kids we see and hear would have difficulty exposing anything more complicated than a Baby Ruth bar. Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr. and Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr. didn't get to the bottom of Watergate by sitting around and listening to their hearts, for heaven's sake.The movie is very, very long. It lurches towards obligatory scenes that turn up in no special order, and it is spotted here and there with topical references that are so arbitrary they prompt laughter (""With Ford and Rockefeller, nothing will change much""). It's also shot through with Indian (American) mysticism and self-improvement suggestions that evoke shades of Moral Re-Armament, which was never a hotbed for radical political thinkers.Even the scenery becomes offensive after a while; it's such a waste of magnificent backgrounds we have long associated with the great John Ford films.In addition to Mr. Laughlin and Miss Taylor (Mrs. Laughlin in private life), the cast includes Teresa Laughlin, their 16-year-old daughter; in a prominent supporting role, while 19-year-old Frank Laughlin, their son, is given directorial credit. None of them is terrific. The screenplay was written by Frank and Teresa Christina, who, I understand, are actually Pa and Ma Laughlin. If this film has even half of the success of the first film, ""Billy Jack"" could well become Hollywood's first one-family, multimillion-dollar cottage industry.",1974-11-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Seminarian Is Hero of 'Let the Church Say Amen!':The Program,"""I know I want to be a minister and I know I've got to be black"": the discoveries and the dilemmas of a young seminarian are evoked in St. Clair Bourne's ""Let the Church Say Amen!"", a thoughtful and skillfully made documentary which opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art and will run through Tuesday.We first encounter the young man on the campus of the Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta, where it's stated that ""religion has been one of the basic elements of black life. . .from the church, many progressive movements have sprung."" One student remarks, ""I don't think we deal with challenging the white man's conception of God."" Before participating in a field interneship program, the future minister says that the choice of a denomination doesn't matter greatly to him, but that he's particularly interested in the ghetto church. However, an adviser suggests that he become acquainted with a rural church.The film follows him to a Baptist church in Mound Bayou, Miss., where he confers with an old country preacher about the intensity of religious feeling in that community. Next, he spends time at a Methodist church in Chicago, where the urban congregation airs some generational conflicts. He also visits a group of teen-agers whom a youth organizer encourages to talk about their attitudes toward death, suicide""Is is a cop-out?""and the assassinations of black leaders. A member of the church later objects that the organizer ""teaches them too much black.""Finally, the seminarian returns to Atlanta; the film then intercuts between a Christian minister's sermon and a discussion with some Black Muslims who are standing outside the chapel. The minister stresses the tangible realities of black lifeincluding the children who suffer from malnutrition ""while the politicians thrive""and he warns against an overly mystical approach to religion. Especially because the camera never seems to be intrusive, the film yields a strong sense of the varieties of religious experience that one young man has been exposed to, and the breadth of choice that confronts him. Since the different roles of the contemporary church are so sensitively explored, the documentary should be equally enlightening for those who do or don't belong to the church itself.",1974-11-14T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Hindered',"Having chosen a decidedly unusual, if slightly improbable but altogether touching subject, Steve Dwoskin demonstrates delicate artistry in ""Hindered,"" which had its American premiere last night at the Film Forum. The 35-year-old, New York-born moviemaker-artist, reportedly completed his feature in recent months for showing on German television. He has made a liaison between an Angst-ridden girl and her disabled, crutch and braces-encumbered young man into a microscopically fine and sensitive dissection of the tenderness and pain of an extraordinary involvement.Mr. Dwoskin, who was represented here last year by another absorbing feature, ""Dyn Amo,"" exhibits an almost exhausting predilection for close-ups of eyes, noses, hands, feet and faces to dramatize, ever so slowly, the feeling of his star-crossed principals. But if a viewer is nagged by a need for explanations, the cumulative effect of their personal drama is both bittersweet and moving.The film, whose sparse German dialogue is translated by literal English subtitles, projects a special kind of poignancy since, as a program note mentions, it is basically autobiographical and Mr. Dwoskin, who also plays the young man, seems also to be handicapped. But to his credit, his color camera focuses mostly on the object of his affection, Carola Regnier, a newcomer to this observer, who uses her expressive, if not beautiful face and body to affect a powerful, controlled tour de force.Her detailed fascination with his disability, her precise, sensitive reactions to growing anxieties, her mounting indecision and her final wrenching decision to leave him are interlaced, glowing cameos of authentic emotion and meaning.Mr. Dwoskin's comparatively rare appearances are self-effacing but equally realistic. At one point, Mr. Dwoskin, a long-haired, laconic, seemingly unemotional type, comforts his perturbed girl. ""Don't worry. You think too much about it."" Mr. Dwoskin's forthright and unsentimental drama not only gives us something to think about but also stirs the heart.",1974-11-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Vietnam Lesson:'Introduction to Enemy' From Jane Fonda,"Patience may never become one of our national characteristics. But we could take some lessons from the Vietnamese. Rebuilding and rebirth are the themes of ""Introduction to the Enemy,"" which was made collectively by Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, Haskell Wexler, and others; it depicts their travels through North and South Vietnam last spring. The documentary is playing today and tomorrow at the First Avenue Screening Room. Anyone who was or is concerned with the war should see italong with those who think that the war is over.Throughout this quiet, modest film, in which scrap metal from American airplanes is made into bicycles, and an old man explains that he rebuilt his house 12 times (on five occasions after the French bombings, and seven times after the American raids) and misty green crops rise from filled-in craters, it is stressed that the Vietnamese do not hate Americans, that they want to know more about us. Again and again, different Vietnamese citizens say that they distinguish between a population and its political leaders: they repeat that they do not blame Americans at large for the destruction of their country. Yet the wounds of their continuing experience are as tangible as the unexploded mine that goes off and kills a man during the filming.The film seethes with small children; it seems quite amazing that there are so many Vietnamese children left alive, or that smiles of all ages should be turned toward the camera. Miss Fonda and Mr. Hayden function as un-obtrusive guides. They journey from Hanoi to the South, crossing the demilitarized zone to the Quang Tri province. Miss Fonda interviews people about their work, asking why one chose to become an actress, or a translator, or a member of the resistance. The answers are thoughtful, decisive  as much personal as political.Another recurrent theme is that Vietnam is one countrythat the artificial division of the North and the South is not accepted by the Vietnamese. It's remarked that most families have relatives living in both areas; an editor adds, ""The North and the South have always shared moments of joy as well as moments of sorrow and tragedy."" Moreover, ""American leaders are constantly reminding us that the bombing could be renewed."" A very old man says he'd be happy to die if he could see one day of reunification.Though the Paris Peace Agreements have not been fulfilled, a restrained optimism surges through this documentary. The mood of the film is distilled when someone asserts that ""the needs of peace are greater than the needs of war""meaning that rebuilding schools and hospitals and homes and entire cities demands resources and energies that simply aren't available in wartime. All in all, this pensive and moving film serves as a chapter of our own education about the Vietnamese past and the rhythm of life in that country now.",1974-11-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Savage Is Loose',"""The Savage Is Loose,"" produced, directed and distributed by George C. Scott, who also stars in it with his wife, Trish Van Devere, is one of those desert-island movies in which the members of the audience, more often than the characters within the film, keep searching the horizon in hopes that a ship will pass by.The film, which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and other theaters, is a three-character, four-actor melodrama about a scientist, his much younger wife and their son who are shipwrecked on a tropical isle early in this century. What begins as a kind of tab show version of ""The Swiss Family Robinson"" quickly disintegrates into a muddled meditation upon the survival of the human race, but under conditions so special that the film's primal concerns eventually become ludicrous.A heavily portentous line spoken early in the film by the son (played as an adolescent by Lee H. Montgomery) points the way: ""Mother, when I grow up, can we get married?""Trouble erupts 10 years later when the son, now played by John David Carlson, has started to court his mother in earnest. He leaves orchids by her coconut-shell soup bowl and asks pointed questions on the order of: ""Who was Cain's wife?"" When Mom and Dad make love, he likes to peek.Says Mom to Dad in the semi-privacy of their bamboo-walled bedroom: ""We've got a lusting male with no outlet."" That is, no satisfactory outlet. Mom has found that the boy has constructed a curious substitute woman, apparently out of the all-purpose coconut shells, in a jungle hideaway.It isn't long before things come to a showdown, largely because Dad has allowed himself to get cranky and go to wrack and ruin (Mr. Scott at this point looks like a cross between the Biblical Abraham and Raymond Duncan) and seemingly because the life force is so strong that Mom's resistance to her son begins to run out.Someone might very well have made a plausible Oedipal metaphor out of this story, but not Max Ehrlich and Frank De Felitta Jr., who wrote the screenplay and stuffed it with unequal alternatives.A major point is made at the beginning of the film of the conflict between the parents. The mother wants to raise the boy as a civilized child who can read and write, while the father feels the boy must be taught to dominate his environment. This supposedly has the effect of turning him into the savage of the title, though why he couldn't also have learned to read and write is never properly explained.By reducing the Oedipal conflict to such a basic confrontation, the movie has the effect of making a common psychological conflict seem as remote to most of us as the emotional lives of Siamese twins.""The Savage Is Loose"" works neither as an adventure film, as a psychological exploration, nor, heaven help us, as a family melodrama. Although I think that Mr. Scott has been talking through his hat in recent public statements that the movie is not about incest, the subject is so genteelly handled that I can't imagine children seeing the film would be anything but confused and probably bored.The production, photographed entirely on location south of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, looks pretty and has the studied blandness of a film directed according to a 50-year-old textbook on movie making. What force it has comes entirely from the performances of Mr. Scott and Miss Van Devere, though the banality of the script has a way of letting them seem overwrought when they mean to be believably passionate. The less said about the other performances, the better.",1974-11-16T05:00:00+0000

The dam breaking, floods rising, bodies falling, towers crashing or burning, the earth heaving, pavements parting and the random explosions are all enhanced by Sensur-round: special vibrations on the soundtrack cause your spine and your throat to tingle. (You may also wonder if they curdle the brain cells.) It seems greedy to wish that ""Earthquake"" were in 3-D. At any rate, the whole experience opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld Theater.The deadpan delivery of key lines informs us when the worst is coming. Such as: ""I know you'll laugh, butI think we're going to have a really big quake."" Or (to a child on his way to the playground): ""Just be careful crossing that bridge."" And (to those fleeing from a cellar that's about to be flooded): ""Relax! there's lots of time!"" The impulse to shout advice to the screenget out! go away! don't enter that buildingis quite powerful, so this does rank as a participatory movie.While the exertions that the cast goes through can't really be called acting, Ava Gardner (looking magnificent), Charlton Heston (a bit less wooden than usual), Genevieve Bujold (brisk and beguiling), Marjoe Gortner (a righteous psychotic) and George Kennedy (a nimble cop) do convey an exhilarating amount of panic. There's also a pleasing glimpse of Walter Matthau as an imperturbable drunk; he's listed under his true name, Walter Matuschanskavasky. Although the special effects are staggeringly realistic, I'll go along with the psychologists who say that the disaster movies manage to assert that it couldn't happen to youbecause it's happening to movie stars.""Earthquake"" is far less sophisticated than ""Jugger-naut,"" but much more so than ""Airport 75""a really rotten movie that's entertaining just because it's so bad. (There, it would be nice to see the Charlton Heston and Karen Black roles reversed, so that an experienced woman pilot would guide a sobbing male steward at the controls: ""Take a left turn, honey."" ""Oh God I can't."" ""Now, now."") ""Earthquake"" also includes a skyscraper bursting into flames  no doubt in order to steal a march on ""The Towering Inferno,"" which won't open until next month. While the quake isn't gory, it's the most harrowing of these movies so far, hence it mightn't be appropriate for anyone under 10. But for those who have a soft spot for calamity pictures, there's a sense of ritual cleansing afterward. And for some reason, it also made me hungry.",1974-11-16T05:00:00+0000

Mexican police came knocking on their door one night. He was badly beaten,, and the whole familyhe, his wife and two childrenwere taken to the northern border and delivered to the Feds.

This isn't to suggest that there is much value in such pious concepts as The Art Form of Our Times""; but it is to deflate, at least slightly, the aura of sanctity that in some circles still hangs over the idea of the artist's vocation. The greatest artists never finish with their forms because they never run out of things to discover in them: indeed, that is one definition of their greatness.

Csonka, surely faking an ankle, injury after;, scoring only two touchdowns, just loafed on the sideline in the final quarter of, the easy 3528 victory over the Buffalo Bills that dropped the Dolphing into first place in the American Con ference East yesterday. Warfield, who hadn't bothered to appear for several games because of a pulled hamstring muscle that didn't even require amputation, caught only one touchdown pass from Bob Gniese for only 49 yards; caught a pass for a mere 54 yards that positioned one of Csonka's reluctant touchdowns and waited until the final minute to catch another pass for a 31yard gain on the Dolphins winning drive. Kiick, who enjoys his weekly naps on the Dolphins bench and who annually has nominated Don Shula as the National Football League's humanitarian of the year, woke up time to maintain the winning desire by agreeing to catch a 12yard pass and deigning to run 11 yards on the next play.

And for that one must be profoundly grateful, because one. paradoxical result of the keening and handwringing and cries of mea culpa that throughout the last century or po have been expended over imperialism's westward expansion is that the Indian has been robbed of his dignity. By assigning blame  and by designating oppressors and victims, we diminish the tragedy to melodrama (true tragedy is never cowboys and Indians). And by reducing the settlement of the West to melodrama, we shrink the Indian in stature. No, T. R. Fehrenbach doesn't make us feel guilty about the Indian. He grants him his dignity. Grants him his dignity, first of all, by choosing to write about those tribes collectively known to themselves as Nermernuh (or True People: each Indian tribe considered itself the true people, apparently) and to European settlers as Comanches (from the Ute phrase Kohmahts, or Those Who Are Always Against Us""each Indian tribe considered the other tribes the enemies, apparentlywhich the Spanish wrote down as Komdntcia, which in turn became conventionalized as ComanChe). Not that Mr. Fehrenbach regards the Comanches as superior to other tribes, or anything. It just hap pened to be the Comanches who most proficiently exploited the horse once the Spaniards had introduced it, who most, successfully took up the hunting way of life in the great plains to, the east of the Rockies, who most ferociously resisted the imperial expansion of the Spaniards and AngloAmericans and who thus most decisively affected the course of American history.",1974-11-22T05:00:00+0000

The explanation for this seeming contradiction is very simple: Ford and his constituents believe firmly in home rule, in effective decentralized government. Over the years, Jerry Ford has done his part to keep things in Grand Rapids independent of Washington by voting against programs which would expand the role of the Federal Government in local affairs, while his constituents have done their part by voting for local levies which would make improvements in the communityin their community (don't forget that 75 per cent of the county's residents are home owners)without the Federal Government dictating how",1974-11-24T05:00:00+0000

William Fulbright, of the furrowed brow, the threepiece suit, the dignified mien, and, for almost all that time, of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. To the folks down home in Arkansas, he was plain old Bill Fulbright, shirt sleeves rolled up, baggy pants held up by suspenders and collar open at the neck, talking to them about the price of cotton and chickens, doing their business in Washington, D.C., and mostly keeping a discreet silence on the burning matter of race. At last, however, as he approached his 70th year, the trick failed him. Voters in the Democratic primary decided that Fulbright had neglected them and that they preferred instead an immensely popular young Governor named Dale Bumpers, young enough to be Fulbrighfs son, new enough to have almost no history and no enemies. Bumpers had declared throughout his campaign that there was a mess in Washington, and that Fulbright had been there all those years.

While he treated a sick cow in a farmer's barn, the good doctor would also try gently to drum up some loan business for the bank. He'd tell the farmer that if he'd buy a barn cleaner (a thennewfangled machine that scoops up manure), he could handle another five or six milch cows. The profits from the additional milk, Dr. Moyer explained, would more than pay the 5 per cent interest on a loan to buy the machine. Quakertown's Pennsylvania Dutch farmers were cautious folk, not eager to be in debt, and they thought about it for awhile.

A movie called The Fly comes to mind, for some reasonan understated yet powerful scifi thriller about a who through a mixup with it transformation machine exchanges not his gender but his head with a common housefly, the film's only flaw being Vincent Price as a secondary character. But in The Return of the Fly, Mr. Price took over everything (I still carry around with me a troubling if somewhat vague memory of Mr. Price's staring in horror at a friend who has just been turned into a giant bunny  rabbit)and the result was dreadful, or, as Myra Breckinridge might put it, de trop. And so it goes with Gore Vidal's two novels. The first seemed original, surprising, a classic of its kind (since it was the only one of its kind, it could hardly avoid being such), and its only flaw was its somewhat too clever ending, in which Myra is hit by a car and transformed back to masculine Myron by the resulting surgery. But in Myron, Mr. Vidal's cleverness takes over everything, and if the result is not so bad as to be dreadful, it is certainly a shade too much.",1974-11-26T05:00:00+0000

A spokesman for the state racing commission said the legislation would make New Jersey race tracks more competitive with tracks in Pennsylvania and New York. He said that better purses would attract better horses and the attendance at tracks would increase. With increased attendance, the betting also would increase, meaning more money for the state. Under the bill, the take would be increased on wagers other than straight winplaceshow bets. The take on exotic betting, such as the trifecta, would be increased from 17 per cent. to 25 per cent.
