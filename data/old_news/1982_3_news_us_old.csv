For many years this seemed to be the unhappy fate of the National Academy of Design, which was founded in 1825 and is thus the most venerable of the city's art institutions. While its members found a comfortable shelter from modernist outrages and innovations in the academy's staid programs and exhibitions, the rest of the art world hardly gave these activities a thought. For decades at a stretch - in the 1950's and 60's, say - it was possible to feel completely informed and up to date about contemporary art in New York without ever entering the august premises that have served as the academy's home since 1940.",1982-03-05T05:00:00+0000

The plumbing leaks have since been repaired, but subsequent studies showed there were indeed excessive cases of cancer - at least two of them fatal - and other serious illnesses among those at Smith Hall. Last month, after tests revealed possibly harmful concentrations of a known carcinogenic hormone in the building, Rutgers officials ordered it closed pending further tests.

In most cases the choice will depend on the size or weight of the load to be supported, but it may also depend on the type of masonry and its condition (hard or soft, solid or crumbling, etc.) Broadly speaking, the most common methods used in the home for fastening to walls made of brick, poured concrete, cement block and other forms of masonry fall into one of two categories: (1) Specially hardened nails or threaded studs driven directly into the masonry with a heavy hammer or with a special tool; (2) expansion-type anchors inserted into a hole bored in the masonry. A screw or lag bolt is then inserted in the anchor to fasten the shelf bracket or other hardware in place. The hardened masonry nails, which can be driven directly into the masonry with a hammer, are mainly used for fastening wood strips or 2 by 4's to a wall prior to putting up paneling or insulation (or to nail 2 by 4's to a concrete floor when framing out an unfinished basement). A small sledge or extra-heavy hammer is required for best results. These nails are quite brittle and will break or snap off (instead of bending) if not hit squarely with each blow, so safety goggles must be worn. Masonry nails are generally used where only a moderate amount of stress will be encountered, and where a heavy load is not involved. Even then, they will hold properly only if the masonry is solid, and they tend to shatter bricks unless driven into the mortar joints - and even then they may cause the bricks to loosen. When there are many masonry nails to be hammered in, a special tool can be used to make the job easier. Often called stud drivers, these tools are similar to the gunpowder-actuated tools that professional contractors use for driving masonry fasteners into concrete and steel. (A controlled explosive charge drives the fastener into the surface, much as a bullet is expelled from a gun's nozzle). For do-it-yourselfers there is a less expensive (and safer) hammerin type of stud driver with a snug-fitting hardened steel anvil that slides in through the center. It projects out at one end so that a special nail (or threaded stud) can be inserted in the other end with its head against the anvil. The projecting point of the nail or stud is then pressed against the wood or material being fastened in place while the anvil is struck several hard blows with a heavy hammer. The tool concentrates all the power of the blow against the head of the fastener, driving the hardened nail through the wood and into the masonry. The sleeve in which the nail fits keeps it from bending or breaking and makes it much easier to drive the nail straight in. For supporting large shelves and for hanging cabinets and other heavy loads on a masonry wall, one of the various expansion-type masonry anchors, similar to the styles illustrated above, are generally recommended instead of using masonry nails. These provide a stronger grip and are less likely to pull loose under heavy stress, and all work on basically the same principle: The anchor itself consists of a hollow sheath or sleeve that is inserted into a hole drilled in the masonry beforehand. A screw or lag bolt (a type of heavy-duty screw) is inserted into the center of this anchor, then tightened. This causes the anchor to split or expand so that it locks itself firmly in place inside the masonry as it presses against the sides of the hole. As a result, tremendous pressure is required to pull it out, and it is even harder to apply enough stress to shear it off. To drill the necessary hole in the masonry - the size hole required is specified in the manufacturer's literature - an ordinary electric drill can be used with a carbide-tipped bit that is made for use in masonry. These bits come in all popular sizes, and are best used with a slow-speed three-eighth-inch or half-inch drill, or with a variablespeed quarter-inch drill (the typical quarter-inch drill is too fast for use with carbide bits, unless it has variable speed control). When drilling in masonry with a carbide bit, steady and constant pressure must be applied on the drill handle. Allowing it to slip inside the hole will cause the bit to dull rapidly. Holes can also be drilled by hand, using a hammer and a special type of cold chisel called a star drill, so named because it has a star-shaped point that consists of two cutting edges that cross each other at right angles, as illustrated. This is hammered into the masonry while rotating it slightly (about one-fourth of a turn) after each blow, until the hole is as deep as required. The three most common types of expansion anchors that are designed for use in solid masonry are those made of plastic, impregnated fiber or some type of metal (metal anchors are usually made of a lead alloy, so they are often referred to as lead shields, rather then as anchors). Plastic anchors (much the same as the plastic anchors sold for use in hollow walls, described in last week's column) accept regular wood screws of the proper size. Self-tapping screws, which have threads all the way to the head, will grip even better when attaching metal brackets or other thin materials. Fiber anchors, which also accept conventional wood screws, will also hold better if self-tapping screws are used in most applications. Both of these anchors are fine for most medium-weight loads where regular wood screws are adequate to support the load. However, for heavier loads, metal shields or lead anchors are generally preferable. These are split shields that are designed so they can expand inside the hole when a large, heavy-duty lag bolt is inserted and tightened (a lag bolt is a large threaded screw with a square or hex-head instead of a slotted head, so it can be tightened with a wrench instead of a screwdriver). In addition to this type of lead shield, there are also a number of other types of metal and hard plastic anchors that are split into two sections and come with regular threaded bolts so that no lag screw is required. These work in the same manner as the ones just described - the anchor is inserted into a hole in the masonry, then the bolt is tightened. The anchor splits or expands inside its hole as the bolt penetrates (or as a nut on the outside is tightened), locking it into place inside its hole.",1982-03-11T05:00:00+0000

But its quietness is not some accident of fate in sprawling, bustling New York City. As deed restrictions placed on the first houses that sprang up in the district in the 1840's show, Stuyvesant Square was designed at the start to house ''no brewery, distillery, slaughter house, blacksmith shop, forge, furnace, soap, candle, starch, varnish, vitriol, glue, ink or turpentine factory,'' or, for that matter, any ''factory for canning, dressing or preparing shins, hides or leather or any cow or livery stable or cattle yard or any other Metropolitan Baedeker dangerous, noxious or offensive establishment.'' To walk through the square on a weekend afternoon in winter is to see it plain and sense its history. A do-it-yourself walking tour might start in Stuyvesant Square Park west, in front of the statue of Peter Stuyvesant, Governor of Nieuw Amsterdam in the mid-17th century, on whose ''bouwerie,'' or farm, the square was laid out. That statue is the only feature of the west park that is different from its eastern half. As portrayed by his sculptor, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, the one-legged Stuyvesant looks very like a dancing master, hip tilted, leaning on his stick as he gazes thoughtfully in the direction of the Friends Meeting House on the southwest corner of 16th Street.",1982-03-12T05:00:00+0000

The opposition to the policy came from two freshmen Democratic Senators, Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut. (Page 1, Column 3.) The Caribbean economic plan proposed by the Reagan Administration was endorsed by President Franc,ois Mitterrand of France, who flew to Washington for a meeting with President Reagan. There was no indication from the public statements issued after the meeting of nearly three hours that France and the United States do not continue to hold differing views on the guerrilla war in El Salvador or on the general question of outside involvement in Central America.

''Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant'' is Anne Tyler's ninth novel; her career began in 1964 with a fully realized first novel (the title was ''If Morning Ever Comes,'' and there are piquant links between it and her latest book); everything I've read of hers since then - stories, novels and criticism (Anne Tyler is a first-rate critic, shrewd and self-effacing) - has been, at a minimum, interesting and well made.

Each side retains advantages and disadvantages relative to the other. For instance, the Soviet Union does retain an overall advantage in missile-throw weight. However, this advantage is more than offset by United States superiority in total warheads deployed and greater warhead survivability as a result of more diverse United States strategic force deployments.","I concur with the authors in their assessment that growing instabilities in the nuclear equation are caused by the spread of nuclear weapons, and serve to increase the prospects for nuclear war by accident.

us,         HOT POTATOES TO HOLD ONTO,"One of our favorite vegetable stories involves the so-called ''common potato.'' Legend has it that Sir Walter Raleigh once returned to Ireland from Virginia and carried with him several potatoes, which he proceeded to plant and which flourished in his garden. When they had reached maturity, he dug up a few and presented them to Queen Elizabeth's kitchen. A misunderstanding cook tossed away the tubers and served her majesty a platter of leaves. It is certainly no legend that we regard the potato - in almost any form, sauteed, deep-fried, pureed, tossed into a stew or made into a salad - as one of nature's greatest inventions. There are few vegetables that have more virtues. Potatoes are delectable served hot or cold, but the flavor of a potato depends to a great extent on the flavors and textures of the foods with which it is combined. Put it in league with a garlic-tinged sauce, a chopping of parsley, chives or scallions, or a puree of leeks or other vegetables, and there is a flavor explosion of the most refined and delectable sort. We thought of this recently in creating a series of luncheon or supper dishes with baked potatoes as a base. From childhood we have found stuffed baked potatoes, with a topping of cheese, irresistible. Why not, we wondered, blend them with an assortment of savory ingredients such as shrimp, ground pork with rosemary, or oysters and those Creole vegetables, onions, green pepper and celery? The results were all to the good. These stuffed vegetables can easily serve as appetizers before a meal or, taken on their own, can just as easily constitute a meal - a light supper, say - by themselves. Pommes de terre aux crevettes (Baked potatoes with shrimp) 4 large Idaho baking potatoes, about half a pound each 1/2 pound raw shrimp in the shell 3 tablespoons butter 1 cup coarsely diced fresh mushrooms 2 tablespoons dry Sherry wine 1/4 cup heavy cream Salt, if desired Freshly ground pepper A few drops of Tabasco 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese. 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 2. Arrange the potatoes on a baking sheet and place them in the oven. Bake one hour to one hour and 15 minutes or until done. 3. Meanwhile, shell and devein the shrimp. Cut the shrimp into small cubes. 4. Heat one tablespoon of the butter in a saucepan and add the shrimp and mushrooms. Cook, stirring, about one minute. Add the wine and stir. Remove from the heat. 5. When the potatoes are done, slice off the top of each one, about half an inch from the top. Carefully scoop out the center of each potato bottom to make a ''boat'' for stuffing. Put the scraped-out potato pulp into a saucepan or bowl and mash well and uniformly. Add this to the shrimp mixture. Add the cream and one tablespoon of butter and cook briefly, stirring.

us,         WHEN A HEATING SYSTEM'S SAFETY VALVE GIVES WARNING,"IN houses that are heated by a circulating hot water system, the homeowner is often dismayed when he suddenly finds that water is spurting out of the pressure relief valve located on one of the hot water supply pipes just above or close to the boiler. In some installations, it may be on a pipe that runs alongside the boiler. This valve is a safety device that squirts out enough water to relieve the pressure, then shuts down again. The valve has a hinged lever on top that can be flicked up and down; lifting up on this lever manually will always release some water from the valve's discharge outlet, or from the length of pipe connected to it (usually ending down near the floor). In most cases, water spurting from this valve is an indication that the expansion tank needs to be drained. This tank, usually directly over the boiler, or at least close by, is supposed to be half full of air and half full of water. The air inside is compressed by the heated water and helps to build up the required pressure inside the system without creating steam. It also acts as a cushion to compensate for expansion and contraction of the water inside the closed system as it heats up and cools off. Eventually the tank loses its air cushion and fills with water because the trapped air is gradually dissolved by the water. When this happens, the pressure in the system gets too high and the relief valve ''blows'' - squirts water out through its overflow. Another result may be poor heating efficiency in parts of the system, or it may cause several radiators to become air-bound so they cannot heat up. To prevent this, the expansion tank needs to be drained periodically. Once a year is usually enough, though some systems can go longer without needing draining. Usually you can tell when the tank needs draining by feeling the outside of the tank while the system is working; the bottom half should be quite a bit hotter than the top half. If it is uniformly hot all the way up, chances are it is full of water. (On some of the newer systems, the expansion tank never needs draining - it has a rubber diaphragm inside that keeps the water and air separated. These tanks have no drain valve and only have one pipe leading into them. If this type of tank ever does become waterlogged, because of the diaphragm's rupturing, it must be replaced completely.) To drain those tanks that need draining, here are the steps to follow: 1. Shut off the system and wait for the system to cool, then turn off the inlet, or supply, valve in the pipe leading into the tank. 2. Hold a bucket under the drain valve, or attach a hose to it, then open the valve and let the water run out until the tank is empty. 3. Close the drain valve, then open the inlet valve to allow water to enter the tank again. Start up the system and when the boiler heats up, the pressure gauge should read normal again (the needle should match the permanently set one on the gauge). On some expansion tanks, the drain valve is also a purge valve - it lets air enter the tank as the water is drained. With these you do not have to shut off the inlet valve, nor do you have to drain the tank completely. After the system has cooled, you simply drain off three or four buckets full of water, then close the drain valve and restart the system. Answering the Mail Q. We recently installed ''high-hat'' recessed lights in one ceiling that project up into the insulated floor of the attic. Since it is unsafe to put insulation around or over the lights, we left it off around them. Now there are cold drafts coming down from above through the holes cut in the ceiling. Do you have any idea how to cure this problem? - C.C., Wyckoff, N.J. A. Build a box over the top of the lights where they project up into the attic. Just make sure the box is large enough to allow for the heat put out by each fixture (check with the manufacturer). In addition, provide some small openings on two sides of each box so heat can escape. Some cold air may still enter through these openings when the lights are off, but much less than what comes in now. Q. My home has been painted many times with oil paint. I now want to switch to latex paint because it is easier to work with. Is this possible? - L.D.L., Southbury, Conn. A. Yes. Just make sure you get rid of any excessive chalking and/or powdering on the old paint, and that you dull down any glossy places before applying the latex paint over it. Q. I have removed wallpaper from our plastered walls and ceilings and now intend to paint. There seems to a shiny residue of sizing, or possibly some paste, remaining on the plaster. Must this all be removed and if so, would the plaster have to be sized again? - M.T., Tenafly, N.J. A. You should scrub all the residue off with hot water and detergent. Allow the plaster to dry thoroughly, then apply a coat of primer sealer, followed by the paint of your choice. Either oil or latex can be used for the final coat, but I would advise an alkyd primer sealer for the first coat.",1982-03-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"In 1793, a young soldier deserted the Fort Hamilton compound, which was not yet a town but only a defensive perimeter against the Indians, to return to his sweetheart in New York. Caught a few miles downriver, he was brought back to the garrison where he was, an early chronicler noted, ''swung off without a murmur.'' In 1978, a respected citizen of Hamilton was accused of a crime few people had previously thought of as a crime and which no one wanted to talk about until the alleged incident became a public scandal - the occasion for the town to examine itself as it never had. The resemblance between the calamities is less than identical, more than coincidental. In each case the collective impulse was to get rid of someone whose presumed deed threatened what was perceived as the integrity and structure of the community.","I went to Hamilton not so much looking for as assuming change. The prevalence of change is a given in America. Yet what I found was an astonishing, striking, virtually genetic resemblance between Hamilton's past and its present. The desire to sell, build, expand, advertise, migrate, win, get more for the children - all of this has been in Hamilton for over one hundred fifty years. Dazzled by the vividness and clutter of technology, Hamiltonians themselves remark on how much has changed in the town. Buildings are replaced, everything runs by computer, people are ciphers. Sidewalks are no longer safe, everyone gets mad at his neighbor too easily, public officials are dishonest, kids leave town if they get an education. Yet each of these complaints echoes one in the nineteenth century. The bootlegging city marshal of the 1870's is mirrored in the sheriff who in the 1970's was convicted of embezzlement, conflict of interest, and income tax evasion. The rapid pace of change disturbed those Hamiltonians of the 1890's who longed for ''the gentler days gone by'' when families stayed together, indeed for their own youth.",1982-03-19T05:00:00+0000

us,         REPAIRING OR REPLACING CERAMIC TILE: SOME TIPS ON CUTTING,"WHEN making repairs to a ceramic tile wall, or when replacing some missing or damaged tiles, the do-it-yourselfer will often find it necessary to cut tiles to fit against the top of a sink or tub, or to fit into a corner floor joint. Cutting a tile may also be necessary when fitting it around a wall-mounted faucet or fixture of some kind. If there are a large number of tiles to be cut (for example, when doing an entire wall) then it would probably be worth while renting one of the special tile-cutting machines that are available from most local dealers. However, when there are only a few tiles to be cut as part of a repair or remodeling job, then the only tool required is an ordinary glass cutter - preferably a new one that has not been used very much so that the steel cutting wheel is still quite sharp. To guide the glass cutter in making a straight cut, you should use a ruler or straightedge of some kind. Better yet, use a small square if you want the cut piece to have a truly square corner. Then, holding the glass cutter almost vertical between the first two fingers and with your thumb pressing against the back side of the handle, draw the cutting wheel across the glazed surface of the tile with a single firm stroke, bearing down with a moderate but steady pressure all the while. Do not go back and forth over this score mark - go over the line of cut only once with the cutting wheel. If you go over the scored line more than once with the cutter the break will be ragged and the glazed face will likely show chip marks. After scoring, place the tile, face up, over a piece of dowel or a large bolt so that the score mark is directly over it. Then press down hard on both sides of the cut line as shown in the accompanying drawing. The tile should snap cleanly in two along the scored line. If any rough edges do result, these can be smoothed with a medium-cut file or with an abrasive stone. A file can also be used for final trimming to fit if the cut is slightly oversize, as well as to cut shallow notches or grooves in the edge when required to insure a snug fit. However, when sizable notches or grooves are required, or when a tile must be cut to fit around a curved projection (such as water pipes or faucets), then a different technique is used. First, use the glass cutter to score a curved line following the contour that you want the tile to fit against, then use the glass cutter again to score a number of closely spaced crisscross marks over the section that is to be removed. Next, use a pair of heavy pliers with straight jaws, or a pair of end-cutting nippers, to ''nibble'' away the scored section of tile, breaking away one small piece at a time until you have removed all the waste inside the scored outline. Final smoothing can be done (if necessary) by using a half-round file or round abrasive stone. Answering the Mail Q. I have a steep concrete driveway that has been undermined by mole tunnels, as well as by washouts that occurred after several heavy rains. As a result, the driveway has cracked in several places and there are many hollows under it. Is there any way these hollows can be filled in without having to replace the entire driveway? -G.H., Selden, L.I. A. I seriously doubt it. In some cases where there are minor washouts under a concrete slab you can dig down alongside it, then pack sand and gravel in from the side and backfill with earth, but from your description I think you will have to break up the old driveway in order to fill in the ground under it properly. The broken pieces of concrete can be used as fill, however, in the larger holes and cavities. Make sure you get rid of the moles before you go ahead with pouring the new concrete, and use at least four to six inches of sand and gravel to put down a good solid base under the new concrete before you pour it. Q. My dining room has painted wood paneling on the walls. I want to cover the part above the chair rail with wallpaper, leaving the paneling as is under the chair rail. However, owing to the grooves in the paneling, I have been told that before wallpaper can be put over it I would first have to apply a special lining of heavy vinyl that is made for covering cinder blocks prior to papering. This heavy vinyl material would cost more than the paper I intend to put on over it! Would it be practical to fill in the grooves with caulking or putty instead? -C.L.Z., Morris Plains, N.J. A. Caulking and putty would both be impractical; they do not dry hard, and would be difficult to smooth down properly anyway. A wood putty (powdered) or a plastic patching compound could probably be used, but this would be a quite a job and I have my doubts as to how smooth you could get the surface (bumps or ridges would show through the paper). I think your best bet may be to nail up a thin layer of hardboard first. Give this a coat of alkyd primer sealer, or shellacbase sealer, then hang your paper over this.",1982-03-21T05:00:00+0000

In other words, was Mozart feeling sad when he composed his unfinished Requiem? Probably, since he was dying at the time and seems to have known it. Can the stormy anger that one hears in certain of Beethoven's middle piano sonatas be traced to his realization that he was going deaf? Again, probably. Common sense would argue that such connections, while anything but invariably tight, do often exist. And yet you know, of course, that many musical estheticians do not agree.

Alvarez's ''Life After Marriage,'' I found myself wishing that he had taken his case histories of divorce from novels rather than from life, for the novelist's imagination is more likely to be generous than the voice of someone hurt, angry and bewildered. Since divorce is so common, it seems to me that what we need is a heartening literature on the complexity, even the poetry, or the tragicomedy of the thing. It isn't all anguish - nothing ever is. There is a considerable body of literature developing now in which the novel of divorce is becoming our new Bildungsroman, an educational adventure in which the hero or heroine is followed from a picaresque or impetuous youth to responsible, or at least ironical, adulthood. The characters in these novels marry as adolescents and divorce as adults.",1982-03-21T05:00:00+0000

Exploring movement in all its aspects is his particular concern as a modern-dance choreographer, and he is quick to see its uses where others do not. Sitting on a bench in his New York studio the other day, he springs up and is suddenly transformed into a shortstop on an imaginary baseball diamond. Cunningham darts from side to side to field an invisible ball. ''You see?'' he says triumphantly, pointing out what few baseball fans ever notice: His shortstop's feet are turned out, allowing him to move with speed in either direction. Interested in speed himself, he has never agreed with modern dance's general rejection of ballet's turned-out foot position. ''You need it for momentum,'' he says.",1982-03-21T05:00:00+0000

OTIS FERGUSON, CRITIC","I FIND with regret that the work and even the name of Otis Ferguson are generally unknown to readers under 60. Older persons are likely to remember the work with pleasure. Much of it dealt with swing bands or well-crafted films and, by extension, with the revival of popular culture during the 1930's, an aspect of the period that is often neglected. Otis - I can't think of him coldly as ''Ferguson'' - approached those subjects freshly, accurately, with lyrical enthusiasm and contempt for anything faked. Everything he wrote was attentively read in its time, besides leaving echoes in the work of later critics. But the author, who had volunteered as a merchant seaman, was blown up by a German bomb in the Gulf of Salerno, and his writing could only be found in the back files of magazines, chiefly The New Republic. Now, after 40 years, it is good to learn that the best of the writing, in many fields, is being collected as an ''Otis Ferguson Reader,'' which the December Press, of Chicago, will publish.",1982-03-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Parliament Ties in Vote on Begin,"A vote in Parliament on a motion of no confidence resulted in a tie today, prompting Prime Minister Menachem Begin to propose that he and his Cabinet resign. But the Cabinet rejected his request and voted 12 to 6 to stay in office. The vote in Parliament, tied at 58 to 58, came on three motions of no confidence over the Government's handling of recent disorders in the West Bank. But the crucial erosion of Mr. Begin's strength resulted from the defection of some right-wing legislators who are opposed to the final pullout from Sinai, scheduled for April 25. Although the tie did not legally require the Cabinet's resignation, Mr. Begin argued that Cabinet proposals would be hostage to the whims of splinter groups in Parliament unless the Government was reconstituted. Mr. Begin's coalition now controls just half of the 120 seats in Parliament. The opposition Labor Party has 48 but is given no significant chance of attracting support from the religious parties, which hold most of the balance and generally prefer Mr. Begin's politics. The Prime Minister's proposal to resign, which he could have done without Cabinet approval, was opposed by most of his key ministers, including Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Finance Minister Yoram Aridor was the only other member of Mr. Begin's Herut Party to support resignation. After the ministers held an emergency meeting tonight, the Cabinet Secretary, Aryeh Naor, announced, ''The Cabinet has just decided to reject the Prime Minister's proposal whereby he would have gone to the state President and tendered his resignation.''",1982-03-24T05:00:00+0000

REFLECTING THE SUPREMACY OF NATURE","Since Timothy O'Sullivan, landscape photographers have had to face up to the natural world's hostility. O'Sullivan's 19th-century views of the American West served as evidence of nature's cataclysmic tendencies and helped dispel the notion that the world was organized by a benevolent dictator with man's interests in mind. Today we see the world as O'Sullivan did. For a time photographers of this century could believe, with T.S. Eliot, that the world would end ''not with a bang, but a whimper,'' but entropy no longer seems the problem.

us,Q and A; Rules for Subletting,"Question: I have sublet an apartment and was told that though it was rent-stabilized, I would have to pay whatever the landlord charged because I was a subleasee. Is this correct?...A.J., Brooklyn Answer: No. The rent a subleasee can be charged for a rentstabilized apartment is regulated. If you rent directly from the prime tenant and the apartment is furnished, you can be charged 10 percent above the prime tenant's rent. If the apartment is not furnished, there can be no extra charge. If you rent directly from the owner, he can add to the rent the vacancy surcharge allowed under the prime tenant's lease. Thus, if the prime tenant has a two-year lease that allows a 13 percent rise, the owner can charge you an additional 13 percent. If you think you are being overcharged by either a prime tenant or a landlord, you should file a complaint with the Conciliation and Appeals Board. 666 Fifth Avenue.

us,"Q. In normal conditions, do the members of any species feed regularly on themselves?","A. This is a difficult question, not least because so many circumstances observed by humans are so far from ''normal conditions.'' It has been noted over and over that carnivorous fishes eat smaller members of their own species, especially their own young (and other fishes' young of the same generation). This is often seen, for instance, among guppies in aquariums, where the young cannot escape their parents beyond a tempting distance, but it is not known whether it happens in the wild, where the baby fish can seek locations out of harm's way. Again, trout are reputed to be voracious eaters of their own young, but some scientists believe this happens only when other nourishment is lacking. Reports of cannibalism among squid have been published, but have also been contested. Among invertebrates, the females of praying mantises and many spiders regularly attack and consume the males after mating. These circumstances are ''normal,'' but infrequent in the life of any particular female mantis or spider. According to Donn Rosen, curator of icthyology at the American Museum of Natural History, cannibalism as part of normal life is not known for certain to occur in any species except man, and, more particularly, among certain peoples in Papua New Guinea.",1982-03-30T05:00:00+0000
