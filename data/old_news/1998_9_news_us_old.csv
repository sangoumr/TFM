''There's nothing worse than a boring plate,'' Mr. McConnico said from his atelier on the outskirts of Paris. The cocktail napkins are $3.50 for 20; dinner napkins, $7.50 for 40, and dinner plates, $4.75 for 8. The paper goods, made by Caspari, are at Kate's Paperie, 561 Broadway (Prince Street).

Liberty House, designed by Dennis Wedlick, is based on preferences from the readers of Country Home magazine. The house has no closets -- ''No reader mentioned them,'' Mr. Wedlick said -- no kitchen per se and no living room. The 2,500-square-foot experimental house was built in eight sections in Pennsylvania, then trucked to the yacht harbor at the World Financial Center. The grand hallway is 22 feet high but only 11 feet 9 inches wide. ''Well, 13 feet 9 inches was the factory capacity,'' Mr. Wedlick said. There are ballet barres for hanging clothes, with lots of storage -- ''I'm a basket person,'' said Mary Emmerling, the creative director of Country Home, who decorated the house and nicotine-stained the hall. Salvage supplied huge doors, a mantel and a wooden spiral stair for an imaginary teen-age daughter's two-story ''apartment.'' ''We weren't concerned with resale,'' Mr. Wedlick said. ''Resale is the death of architecture.'' Extras include a gift-wrapping area and a satellite dish.

An Assistant Professor in Mount Sinai's Derald H. Ruttenberg Cancer Center, Dr. Spanopoulou was a gifted researcher whose outstanding achievements led to her appointment last year as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, joining one of the Nation's most elite circles of scientists conducting cutting-edge work in cell biology, genetics, immunology, neuroscience and structural biology. Dr. Spanopoulou received her undergraduate degree in pharmacy from the University of Athens in 1983, her Master's degree in general biochemistry in 1984 from Chelsea College of the University of London, and her doctorate in molecular biology from Kings College of the University of London in 1990. She then worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rockefeller University before joining Mount Sinai in 1995. Her research, which has appeared in numerous scientific publications, focused on the molecular mechanisms of the immune system and the potential role of those mechanisms in the onset of leukemia and lymphoma. Her husband was an immunologist who served as an instructor in the Ruttenberg Center. They were aboard the ill-fated flight en-route to her native Greece for their son's christening.

The P.T.A. president, Esther Long, and about 10 other ''cop moms,'' as they became known, became the first crossing guards in America -- at least, as far as she knew. So noteworthy was the development that the Encyclopedia Britannica published a photograph of her on the job at Pearl and Monmouth Streets under the ''Police'' entry in its 1952 yearbook. The school was closed about 20 years ago (it is now a restaurant), but crossing guards are commonplace, though now mainly paid. Esther Long Bragar, the founding cop mom, still lives in Red Bank.

Of the 10 women Steve Sullivan profiles (there are also some fetching frontal views), six seem to have wound up modestly to deliriously happy. True, there was one suicide and quite a few divorces, and several of the women might be described as unfulfilled. The principal qualification for stardom in certain circles in the 50's was a bosom of jaw-dropping proportions. In contrast to today's bionic beauties, these women look engagingly real. Sometimes a little too real -- in a few shots it is apparent the subjects were not subsisting strictly on celery sticks. But only a cad would quibble. Although all the women had their moments, in some cases multiple moments, none became a star on the order of Marilyn Monroe or even Raquel Welch. But they made the most of what they had, and many of them seem to have had a good time in the process. The burlesque queen Jennie Lee, for example, was proud of what she did, performed until she was 50, and in her later years ran an exotic dancers' museum. ''It's been a lot of fun,'' she says. ''I had a good career and made lots of money. And anyway, how else could I travel the world like a millionaire without actually being one?'' To which all I can say is, lady, good for you.

His operas, so much more pliant and equivocal in tone, were largely forgotten until the 1920's. In 1927 he finally made his debut as an opera composer in the United States, when Smith College staged ''Giulio Cesare,'' which remained for several decades the Handel opera of choice.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; The Language of Sickness,"Surgeons may play God with human lives, but their cloak of technical mastery and medical jargon hides a deep vulnerability. After all, they must stand humbly by at that terrible moment when, as Richard Selzer puts it, ''the humidity of life'' dissipates into arid nothingness. It's understandable, then, that while still a relatively young man, Selzer found that he, like a doctor he writes of in THE DOCTOR STORIES (Picador USA, $25), ''had grown tired of blood, of always having to be involved with blood.'' Yet for Selzer, giving up the scalpel for the pen didn't mean turning away from the hospital. In the introduction to this selection from three decades of his short fiction, he makes it clear that he has always seen language and medicine as intertwined: ''Take away metaphor from illness and there is left only the suffering.'' Not surprisingly, it is the language of sickness that Selzer puts on display with a surgeon's deliberate care: In ''Whither Thou Goest,'' a widow searches for the man who received her dead husband's heart in a transplant; in ''Angel, Tuning a Lute,'' the painter Luca Signorelli tries to resurrect his dead son by portraying the corpse, only to realize that ''there is something beyond technique and facility,'' that ''grace must season the painter's hand.'' The doctor's hand too, it would seem. Selzer's fiction is refreshingly old-fashioned: his prose is formal, his ironies straightforward. (In ''Luis,'' a street urchin is poisoned when the ''glowing disk'' he thinks will save his family turns out to be a radioactive part from a discarded medical instrument.) In his introductory essay, he says, ''I am averse to killing off my characters, and have done so only when there was no other way.'' Yet the string of corpses that connects ''The Doctor Stories'' suggests that in fiction, as well as in fact, the healer never has as much control as he may imagine.

During the 1980's, the two men served together on the Federal Appeals Court in Washington, and though they were on opposite ends of the political spectrum, the liberal Mikva and the conservative Starr were friends. Mikva and Starr socialized at each other's homes, dined out together with their wives. When Mikva thought of Starr, words like ''ethical,'' ''fair,'' ''decent'' came to mind. If Mikva saw a fault in the younger judge, it was that Starr was a little too much of an egghead, too pedantic, just not street-smart. This was brought home to Mikva one day during a near fistfight at the Federal courthouse. Starr, Mikva and Laurence Silberman were on a three-judge panel and, when they retired to the conference room, it turned out that Silberman was furious with Mikva over the case they had just heard. ''Silberman said to me, 'If you were 10 years younger, I'd punch you out!' '' Mikva recalls. ''I look over, and there was Ken, looking at the ceiling, wishing he was not there. He never said a word. I attributed it to the gentle son of a minister who didn't like controversy.''",1998-09-06T05:00:00+0000

In response, State Senator Ernie Adler wants the 1999 Legislature (Nevada pols meet biennially) to pass a ''poor man's art exemption.'' Buy $250 worth of local art and you'll pay just 2 percent sales tax instead of the customary 7. Adler also hopes that the tax break will liven up the market in a state that isn't exactly an arts hub.

My mind replayed a scene with Glenn when the two of us were having lunch in my office and my secretary walked in saying Kennedy has been shot. Our lives had been closely intertwined. Glenn ran my business, the Custom Shop, for 17 years. One day he said: ''why can't I drink at my own bar?'' Then he said: ''I want to open a restaurant.'' Glenn really knew food and Glenn could cook. For him it would be a hobby and, crazy as it may sound, I encouraged him to go ahead. Glenn continued to run my business on a part-time basis (now from noon to 5 daily) for the next 3 years and with very good reason he was proud of Mortimer's Restaurant. We celebrated my 80th, 85th, and 90th birthdays there, and on each occasion, Glenn created a beautiful setting-a completely new Mortimer's-revealing his creative imagination.

In ''Without Limits,'' a writer famed for enriching screenplays (his own and others') with the gift of unruly, unpredictable life has taken on a curiously amorphous subject and invested it with deep, reflective power. And precisely because this sports story is not about winning, losing or even how you play the game, it becomes a broader parable than the viewer has any reason to expect. Its wisdom, and clearly Mr. Towne's, lies in the film's way of filtering a young man's headstrong nature through an older man's more rueful point of view.",1998-09-11T05:00:00+0000

That view holds that in giving the 12 notes of the scale equal weight, and freeing them from conventional harmonic relationships, Schoenberg demolished what had until then been a universally comprehensible musical language.

Instead, Bonnard's luminous works were grouped thematically -- landscapes in one gallery, still lifes in another -- with a pointed disregard for dates. Youthful efforts from the 1920's were tossed together with canvases painted around 1947, the year of Bonnard's death. The Frenchman's last completed painting, a small, dappled image of a blossoming almond tree, was stuck into the center of the show.

Recognizing unknown artisans may not have been his original intent, but Evans, who designed layouts for Fortune magazine and taught graphic design at Yale University, was fascinated by the way both professionally designed and primitively scrawled letter forms communicated to the public and left unique marks on the landscape. Evans understood typographic sophistication, but the typography and lettering that he chose to chronicle, as well as the hand-painted signs that he collected and exhibited, were the work of untutored sign makers for stores, restaurants, barber shops, sidewalk stands and churches -- the unheralded artifacts of popular culture that most passers-by take for granted.

us,Miss Lewinsky: Are You Ready for Your Makeover Now?,"Back when Monica Lewinsky was an anonymous Pentagon staff member rather than the (rumored) focus of a publishers' bidding war, she confided to a colleague that being President Clinton's fashion stylist would be her dream job. No longer. At her 25th birthday party in July, she told friends what she really wanted as a present: ''my life back.'' But what does that mean at this point? Based on analysis of past imbroglios, it seems that infamous women like Lewinsky have three basic options: they can disappear, they can marry well or they can try to stay famous for a while (writing, acting, etc.). What's obvious is that Lewinsky needs a whole new game. As a belated birthday gift, we asked several repackaging specialists how she might proceed.",1998-09-13T05:00:00+0000

Rather than smoothing her parents' way, the child's behavior causes a rift as Peter and June begin to fear her new ''savage'' habits. June, in particular, makes futile efforts to keep her daughter in check, but Taylor escapes more and more often into the rain forest, largely forgetting her Western upbringing. As the tension builds, Gillison deftly balances premonitions of doom with glimmers of hope, teasing readers with the possibility that the Campbells, despite a mounting array of physical and psychological dangers, may somehow find their way back to a world where their considerable flaws won't prove to be fatal.

Underneath, it had a form-fitting body suit made from Dri-Fit (a fabric that helps perspiration evaporate quickly), which let her change the dress right on court. Ms. Hingis wore her hair in a vertical ponytail, borrowing from Patrick Rafter, last year's men's champion. Mary Pierce added points to her fashion ranking with accessories: pearls and a tattoo peaking from the shoulder of her signature body-hugging Nike dresses (a look booed at the French Open). Anna Kournikova stopped short of the bikini-style outfits she's often photographed in, sporting instead sexy little skirts and dresses. Venus Williams aced the bra-top competition, wearing revealing halter, T-back tops from a line she helped design.

The new Regents testing program will go further toward discounting and disempowering students. How many more layers of distrust, competition and game-playing will these new tests add to our children's school cultures? How much profit will test makers and edu-bureaucrats make from this new stack of mindless paperwork? How many overachievers will lose focus on the important things in life in preparing for these academic exams? What will be the implications for the well-being of first-graders if principals, teachers and parents are beginning to stress over test preparation at the elementary level? How will our high school students learn responsibility and critical thinking skills if they are left out of important decisions and instead are forced to focus on the prefabricated tests of a huge educational bureaucracy? When will public schools wake up and remember that there job is not to provide good test scores, but to provide a good education for our children?",1998-09-13T05:00:00+0000

In rooms where CAROLINE and JOHN JR. once played, Wall Streeters and former Republican officials sipped Chateau Margaux and dined Friday on gold-leaf china to honor one of Mr. Bush's favorite charities, the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Tanned and fit, Mr. Bush asked: ''What do you do when you used to be President with the rest of your life?'' His answer: ''Plug my causes,'' including charities where ''I'm a big deal now.'' JOHN HENNESSY , chairman of CS First Boston, and LIZ TILBERIS , editor of Harper's Bazaar, attended the event as did BOB MOSBACHER , a former Commerce Secretary; WALTER CURLEY , a former Ambassador to France, and JOSEPH ZAPPALA , a former Ambassador to Spain. Mr. Koch, who paid $9.5 million for the apartment and spent three years redecorating it, quipped: ''If I knew what Jackie's possessions would fetch at Sotheby's, I would have taken the place furnished.''",1998-09-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Black and White in the Yellow Nineties,"''Wierdsley Daubery,'' as Aubrey Beardsley's critics called him, personified the esthetic ideal of the decadent 1890's despite the brevity of his career. In 1892 he was earning enough by his illustrations to escape his day job, but five years later, at the age of 25, he espoused Roman Catholicism and renounced his erotic drawings before dying from consumption. In AUBREY BEARDSLEY (Abrams, $39.95), a judicious and handsome critical study, Stephen Calloway, a curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum, suggests that the identification of Beardsley (1872-98) with the Wildean excesses of the decade was part myth from the start. It was a misrepresentation that was to injure Beardsley as well as to advance him. His work as art editor for the notorious ''Yellow Book,'' for example, recalled Japanese prints and French ''lubricity,'' carrying a whiff of vice to a journal of only occasionally risque art and writing from the likes of Henry James and Max Beerbohm. But the moral backlash provoked by Oscar Wilde's trial for gross indecency led to Beardsley's being fired, and while his best work was yet to come, he was never again as financially or professionally secure. Beardsley always used imitation as a spur to innovation, and Calloway magnificently elucidates his influences -- among them, his mentor Burne-Jones, his enemy William Morris, Mantegna, Charles Ricketts and James McNeill Whistler. To each he owed a not inconsiderable debt, yet Calloway is persuasive in his assertion of Beardsley's distinct artistic genius. Sarah Harrison Smith",1998-09-20T05:00:00+0000

us,My Favorite Show; Robert Pinsky on 'The Simpsons',"Why do I like ''The Simpsons'' so much? Because the show is funny, brilliantly written for masterful vocal actors. But also, I think there is something about ''The Simpsons'' that penetrates to the nature of television itself. The most powerful televisionof my lifetime has been broadcast live, what the book industry would call ''nonfiction'': sports events, trials, assassinations, funerals, wars, missions into space. What all of these spectacles have in common is that they are unpredictable. Even a one-sided World Series game or a carefully planned state funeral might suddenly erupt into surprise, some spontaneous marvel of passion or comedy, as large as a bombing or as small as some unanticipated facial expression. Television has a unique power to bring the dynamic, potentially startling event into the viewer's private, intimate space, immediately.

The Faculty and Staff of New York University School of Medicine deeply mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague, Rosa Foscarinis, MD, Clinical Associate Professor of Pediatrics. Dr. Foscarinis died in a car accident in Athens, Greece on August 21, 1998. She was 82. Dr. Foscarinis was affiliated with NYU for about 4 decades. After earning her MD degree from the School of Medicine of the National University of Athens in 1940, she came to the US to pursue specialty training. She completed a residency in pediatrics at Gouverneur Hospital in 1950 and at NYU's University Hospital (formerly called New York Post-Graduate Hospital) in 1951. Dr. Foscarinis served as a dedicated, compassionate assisting attending in pediatrics at both the NYU Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital. She was also an attending in pediatric allergy at Gouverneur Hospital. We extend our sympathies to Dr. Foscarinis' husband Nicolas, her daughter Maria and all the members of the Foscarinis family.

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Smile When You Call It Pulp, Stranger","Before he became known for wonderfully quirky crime novels like ''Get Shorty'' and ''Out of Sight,'' Elmore Leonard was a master of the pulp western. THE TONTO WOMAN (Delacorte, $23.95), a collection of stories published in various magazines from the 1950's to the 1980's, is a perfect introduction to this work. Like almost all westerns, these are essentially morality tales, but in Leonard's world the triumph of good over evil often comes with an unexpected twist. In ''The Tonto Woman,'' we also see the genesis of his economical prose style and his ability to sketch distinct, multifaceted characters. Leonard doesn't dither; every word counts. In ''You Never See Apaches . . . ,'' the first sentence -- ''By nature Angsman was a cautious man'' -- is the perfect setup for a violent adventure in which a scout is hired by three lowlifes to lead them in search of a gold mine that happens to be on Apache land. Leonard's stories are driven not so much by events as by character. In the title story, the wife of a wealthy rancher is kidnapped, sold into slavery to the Mojave tribe and branded on her face so that ''when she died the spirits would know she was Mojave and not drag her soul down into a rathole.'' Returning in shame to her husband, she is forced to live alone on a secluded ranch, where she encounters an outlaw, Ruben Vega, who will reintroduce her into polite society. We shouldn't be surprised. After all, here's how Leonard introduces Vega: ''A time would come, within a few years, when Ruben Vega would go to the church . . . and say to the priest, 'Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been 37 years since my last confession. . . . Since then I have fornicated with many women, maybe 800. No, not that many, considering my work. Maybe 600 only.' And the priest would say, 'Do you mean bad women or good women?' And Ruben Vega would say, 'They are all good, Father.' '' Charles Salzberg",1998-09-20T05:00:00+0000

us,A Once-Thankless Task Is Now a Chance to Shine,"Replacement actors, once seen as pale shadows of the performers in the original cast, are no longer playing second fiddle to their predecessors. Substitute casts are now charged with star power, as evinced by a string of new lighted names on theater marquees, from Jennifer Jason Leigh and Blair Brown arriving in ''Cabaret'' to Christian Slater segueing into ''Side Man'' to Richard Benjamin and Paula Prentiss moving into ''Power Plays.'' The shift away from scrubs among the subs to first-string quality is driven by producers' needs to satisfy ticket buyers' demands for known quantities, abetted by the desire of screen and stage actors, from Hollywood and London, to work in New York theater. The results can be exciting, as demonstrated by Lillias White's energizing ''Dinah Was,'' the biographical drama of Dinah Washington. Ms. White, who won a Tony for her role as a hooker in ''The Life,'' performs a brace of Washington hits, grabbing hold of the audience and not letting go. Over at the Royale Theater, Brian Cox, Henry Goodman and David Haig have taken over from Alan Alda, Alfred Molina and Victor Garber in ''Art,'' and it is Mr. Cox, and his wonderfully blustery portrayal of Marc, the bombastic neocon, who now sets the rhythm of the play.",1998-09-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Tea With God,"Leo Polishook's grandfather, a Jewish gangster known as the Pasha of Allen Street, was a bootlegger who made gin in his bathtub while he was bathing (because, he claimed, his bodily fluids gave the liquor a distinctive taste) -- until, so one story went, a rival gangster tossed a match into the tub. After growing to manhood in a Lithuanian town called Plissa, Moses Polishook transformed himself into a dapper American gangster. Half of the remarkable stories his grandson tells in David Black's semiautobiographical novel, AN IMPOSSIBLE LIFE (Moyer Bell, $18.95), take place here in the early part of this century and focus on the exploits of the resilient and resourceful Moses. The other half take place back in Lithuania sometime in the last several centuries. Then again, perhaps none of the stories ever took place anywhere, for each of them is described as a bobeh myseh, an old wives' tale. In Plissa, the stories focus on Leo's grandmother, Bella, who lived through pogroms, rapes, murder and cholera and who tells of Heschel the Newcomer and his freckled, redheaded wife, Miriam. Other stories include a wildly mixed cast of seducers, con artists, fools, fakes, faithless wives and beautiful daughters. Golems, dybbuks, demons, angels and talking beasts have what seem to be sensible parts in the action, as do Adam and Eve, Noah, Moses, Abraham, Joseph and Sarah. Even God visits to answer questions and drink tea at the kitchen table. Some of the tales are told with vaudeville rhythms, some with the inflection and diction of the shtetl. All are impossible, wonderful, irresistible. If, as Black suggests in a note at the end of the book, this narrative is something of a family legacy, then he has inherited untold wealth.

''I don't find intent to deceive because there's no way to prove whether the spirits were there or not,'' said Judge Richard J. Hodgson as he dismissed charges against Joy Jadusingh, a voodoo healer. Jadusingh convinced a wheelchair-bound client that ''murderous cabbages'' were invading her home, and that the only defense was ''mystical water'' from Atlantic City. The victim shelled out more than $90,000. But since she and Jadusingh had arranged a service contract, the defense attorney, J. Michael Farrell, successfully argued, What's the crime? The prosecutor, Henry S. Hilles 3d, calls the judgment a license to steal: ''Proving that demons don't exist is tough, which makes a predator like Joy Jadusingh very hard to convict.''",1998-09-27T05:00:00+0000

Now, his newly appointed chief executive and close friend from business school, Richard D. Nanula, has bought a house in Greenwich for $6 million, but is renting elsewhere until it is renovated. Juergen Bartels, another Starwood executive, also bought a big house recently in the same neighborhood, and he, too, is renting until the contractors are finished with a makeover.

A material primarily known to the aerospace industry, it's being used to produce the lightest racquet ever, Wilson's Hyper Sledge Hammer. Weighing a mere 8.3 ounces, it promises to blast past titanium models and become the power racquet for weekend hackers. ''The Hyper Sledge Hammer is now the lightest racquet on the market,'' said Bill Gray, equipment editor at Tennis magazine, which has play-tested the racquet against other new models. Jim Baugh, the president of Wilson, said the featherweight racquet is too stiff for most pros, but perfect for the player with a short, compact swing or an older player looking for a little more zip. Available in sports shops next month, the Hyper Carbon, $350, is designed to give a player a lot more power. ''It's definitely not for a pro, who already has that,'' Mr. Baugh said. Mr. Gray said: ''If Pete Sampras got hold of this racket, he'd probably burn a hole through the back fence.

Updated for a more mature, fashionable foot, this year's styles come in everything from flannel to velvet, with pointy or square toes and artfully shaped or traditionally flat heels. The only must seems to be the girlish instep strap. Prada and Miu Miu did a rubber-sole sport Mary Jane with a Velcro closure, $230 to $250, which was seen at the September fashion shows. They also have a harlequin style in black and white and red and white (top row) for $340. ''That shoe is so graphic and modern,'' said Lauren duPont, accessories director of Vogue, who suggested pairing them with a simple slip dress. For NoLIta Lolitas, Sigerson & Morrison, 242 Mott Street, offers Mary Janes with a heel and sling backs for $228 (bottom left). Barneys made a witchy-looking Jane (bottom center) for $195. Diego Dolcini for Trend Les Copains (807 Madison Avenue, near 67th Street) showed a version for $290 (bottom right) on the fall runway with a skinny, midcalf tweed skirt.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Never Far From Vitebsk,"Henry Miller said it best when he described the artist Marc Chagall as ''a poet with the wings of a painter.'' In his MARC CHAGALL: 1887-1985 (Taschen, $39.99), Jacob Baal-Teshuva focuses on Chagall's adroit use of mystical and free-floating images to create canvases that are poetic pictorials. Born in 1887 in the dismal town of Vitebsk (now in Belarus), near the Lithuanian border, Chagall never saw a painting until 1906, when he spied a fellow student copying a book illustration. Baal-Teshuva, a longtime friend of Chagall's whose warm feelings of friendship ripple throughout his text, follows the artist's career through Vitebsk, St. Petersburg, Paris, the United States and back to France. Concentrating primarily on Chagall's refusal to embrace artistic trends, Baal-Teshuva identifies the painter's strict adherence to Jewish tradition and his affinity for Vitebsk as the unifying themes of his work. Vitebsk, Chagall once said, ''was the soil that nurtured the roots of my art''; of his religion he commented, ''Were I not a Jew, I would not have become an artist.'' From Chagall's prolific career, Baal-Teshuva cites one constant: his use of dreamlike fantasy images combined with vivid memories of his childhood, both of which maintain a constant dialogue between the artist, his origins and his religion.

His season programs, like those of Esa-Pekka Salonen, in Los Angeles, have become models of how modern symphony orchestras can inhabit the present without neglecting the past.

Because Mr. Golijov often quotes or alludes to existing material -- Hebrew prayers and chant melodies, for example -- sections of his works seem tonal.
