us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;An Unstill Life,"The life and work of the Italian photographer Tina Modotti (1896-1942) have become fodder for such a variety of causes that Sarah M. Lowe's vow to write Modotti's ""cultural biography"" and ""dislodge her from the center of her legend"" may cause cynics' eyebrows to arch in suspicion. Yet, as the author's intelligent introductory essay to the 150 elegant duotone photographs reproduced in TINA MODOTTI: Photographs (Philadelphia Museum of Art/Abrams, $45) soon makes clear, Ms. Lowe means what she says. She has done extensive research about the political, social and cultural contexts of Modotti's many whereabouts. Tina Modotti was an uneducated working-class girl in turn-of-the-century Italy and a sophisticated actress, muse and femme fatale in Hollywood before spending the years from 1923 to 1930 in Mexico, where she became an increasingly political photographer; later, among other activities, she was a relief worker in the Spanish Civil War. Ms. Lowe, an art historian and curator, puts the facts of Modotti's life in illuminating perspective, tracing the artist's esthetic development, her ties to the Modernist movement and her awareness of the conflict between making art and making politics. If ""Experiment in Related Form"" (1924) -- a double exposure of five glasses of differing sizes whose rims seem to float, intersect and shine all at once -- means freedom from the austere esthetic of Edward Weston, Modotti's lover and teacher of photography, the sea of sombreros in ""Workers Parade"" (1926) marks Modotti's first expression of her disappointment with the unfulfilled promises of the Mexican revolution and her commitment to a new social order. From portraits of Aztec mothers with their infants to ""Mella's Typewriter"" (a close-up of a Communist lover's instrument of intellectual and political activity), Modotti's tight cropping and still-life esthetic excelled at melding Mexican culture and Modernist photography.

Voila, mechanized oysters. One good idea deserves another, and Renaut discovered that oysters, when plunged into a saline solution, become sleepy and yawn -- long enough for the oyster thread and tab to be harmlessly slipped into place. His ringed oysters went on sale in France at Christmastime and seem to have been well received. The world, as they say, is now Renaut's oyster.

This is far too hyperbolic a statement. Ms. Doerr does have a sure and elegant hand when it comes to describing flora and fauna and the houses in California and Mexico where she has lived. But with her keen attention to detail in matters of character and emotion, she demonstrates a compassionate spirit that is anything but evil. Using an episodic structure similar to those in her novels, ""Stones From Ibarra"" and ""Consider This, Senora,"" this new book allows Ms. Doerr to contemplate certain events from the nearly nine decades of her life, even as she returns us to the locales made familiar in her fiction. Writing with admirable simplicity, she recalls spending sublime childhood summers at the beach, knitting a muffler for an American soldier in France (who sent her a much-cherished thank-you note) and going off to Smith College in 1927. There are also memories of being widowed at 65 after 42 years of marriage and then going back to college, and of helplessly standing by as her son began to succumb to cancer. Several of the short stories, set in Ibarra, reacquaint readers with Sara and Richard Everton, who were introduced in Ms. Doerr's first book. Others explore different parts of rural Mexico. Like the matilija poppies of Ms. Doerr's youth, ""whose crushed tissue-paper petals unfolded every June into white flowers as big as a child's face,"" these previously uncollected short works are strikingly pure and radiant.

The problem is a sticky floor as much as a glass ceiling: The income gender gap opens up within the first year of practice, and among top legal officers of corporations ranges as high as 35 percent. And tougher times for lawyers have meant fresh setbacks for women. From law schools, where nearly half the students are female but the faculty remains overwhelmingly male, come reports that the performance of some women is suffering because of a resurgence of overt male hostility.

us,Books in Brief: FICTION & POETRY;Faces of Brazil,"In the mid-1930's, a young French ethnographer named Claude Levi-Strauss ventured by rail, truck, canoe and horseback into the Brazilian interior to document the cultural habits of tribal groups whose numbers and customs were still somewhat protected by their relative isolation. Equipped with a Leica and ""an oval-shaped miniature 8-mm. camera whose name I have forgotten,"" the anthropologist, feeling ambivalent about the use of photography in such a setting, nonetheless created a rare visual record of archery contests, funeral rites, face painting and other traditional customs, some of which have long since been abandoned. The photographs of the Nambikwara, the Bororo and the Caduveo form the centerpiece of Mr. Levi-Strauss's SAUDADES DO BRASIL: A Photographic Memoir (University of Washington, $39.95), skillfully translated from the French by Sylvia Modelski. There are also images of Sao Paulo in the 1930's when it was a frontier city of ""singular beauty"" and not yet one of the industrial capitals in the world, and of pristine Brazilian landscapes that now, in large or small part, bear the scars of mining and logging as well as other ravages of modernization. The reader might be surprised at the remarkable, if rueful, candor with which the renowned anthropologist introduces the volume: ""The photographs leave me with the impression of a void, a lack of something the lens is inherently unable to capture."" Although Mr. Levi-Strauss, a chief architect of structural anthropology, declares that he is not a photographer, ""not even an amateur,"" the images here are skillful and compelling. But it is not the quality of the photographs he is apologizing for; it is history. And his apology is not directed at us so much as at the ghosts of his tribal subjects, ""the last escapees from the cataclysm"" of European colonialism and its aftermath.

A poll of 2,000 teen-agers around the country conducted by Louis Harris & Associates found that 1 in 8 youths -- and almost 2 in 5 in high-crime neighborhoods -- report carrying a weapon for protection. Almost half said they had changed behaviors -- from changing groups of friends to avoiding parks to missing school -- as a reaction to fears of crime. Teen-agers overwhelmingly said they were willing and eager to take part in activities or programs aimed at combatting crime. The poll served as another reminder that, if the transition from childhood to adulthood has never been easy, it is especially difficult now. PETER APPLEBOME",1996-01-14T05:00:00+0000

HOLDING ON (Norton, $25), a collection of profiles of more than 50 American characters, will either cheerfully remind you that somewhere creative people pursue offbeat passions or leave you annoyed that you are not among them. Take Robert Shields, the author of the world's longest diary, a minute-by-minute account that comprises more than 34 million words; or Dewey Chafin, a snake handler in West Virginia who says, ""Why I do it is because the Bible says to do it, and that's just the bottom line."" Many of the people interviewed in ""Holding On"" are included not because of their personal peculiarities but because they are walking and (thankfully) talking bearers of history -- like Sylvia (Ray) Rivera, a drag queen, and Seymour Pine, a retired police officer, who faced off against each other at the 1969 Stonewall riots; or Geneva Tisdale, a cook at the Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C., who recalls the student sit-ins there in 1960. The radio producer David Isay, who wrote the text, and Harvey Wang, who took the photographs, respect the distinctive lives they document in the book.

Peering into the tenement windows along the route, another opined, ""was better than theater."" The El was completed in just 14 months, opening in 1878, but its clackety-clack outlasted Manhattan's other three elevateds, which were mostly abandoned by 1940 in the name of progress. (The Sixth Avenue El underwent an unfortunate reincarnation, its steel having been sold as scrap to Japan in the late 30's.) A canopy formed by the Third Avenue El's spindly girders plunged the pubs and antiques stores below into perpetual twilight. Its tracks could not accommodate the newer (and faster) trains, but the El continued to rumble until 1955, when Ann Shanks preserved its final months with these and other vivid photographs that will be exhibited at the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn from Jan. 21 through March 24. At the El's demise, its replacement by a new Second Avenue line seemed assured. It wasn't. Only a mile of the Second Avenue subway was bored before the city ran out of money in the mid-70's, though the tunnels are still maintained because they help support Second Avenue. Meanwhile, a task force charged with improving mass transit on the East Side has been exploring, among other possibilities, a new elevated line.",1996-01-14T05:00:00+0000

John Campton, a divorced American painter, is loath to have George, his French-born son, join the fighting at the front. But George's desires intervene. M. F.

AT 71, Josef Skvorecky remains an ironist, a disposition granted him by nature and by the successive totalitarian regimes under which he lived until he emigrated from Czechoslovakia to Canada in 1968. In his novels, Mr. Skvorecky writes with the skeptical authority of an ironic witness to tragic events. He approaches matters of principle offhandedly, as if to remind the reader how indelicately principles are adduced in an absolutist state. ""Faith?"" asks one of his characters in the aftermath of the Prague Spring. ""Where, except maybe in a madhouse, is there any faith left to be lost?"" Yet Mr. Skvorecky's novels abound in faith, though it's guarded by the self-exposing irony of a writer. So it is remarkable to come upon ""The Bride of Texas"" (it was published in Czech in 1992). Mr. Skvorecky has set this work among a group of Bohemian-born soldiers during the final weeks of the American Civil War, when Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman was marching northward through South Carolina in a landscape set alight by withdrawing rebel forces and by stray elements of his own advance troops called ""bummers."" At the end, Sherman would turn away from a climactic battle at Bentonville, N.C., because he knew the war was almost over and because, as he says, war ""is not an exercise in mass execution.""",1996-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction;Stuffed Sparrows and Other Statements,"The French artist Annette Messager is remarkable for many reasons: she is one of a handful of French women artists who have been exhibited internationally since the 1960's; she has addressed, with unflagging originality, feminist issues while working in a country with no coherent feminist tradition in painting; and her multimedia artworks have a push-me, pull-you ambivalence that makes them deliciously provocative. ANNETTE MESSAGER (Los Angeles County Museum of Art/Museum of Modern Art/Abrams, paper, $24.95), the catalogue to her first retrospective exhibition in the United States, now at the Art Institute in Chicago, offers a concise introduction to her art. Ms. Messager, whose greatest influence is the work of the Surrealists, often works in series; photographs and taxidermized animals have been two constants of her introspective and sometimes menacing artworks. One of her most tender yet macabre early series, ""The Boarders,"" featured an installation of stuffed sparrows in hand-knit sweaters, which she baptized, punished and took for ""walks,"" conflating maternal, childlike and corporal impulses. In the 70's, she tackled themes other artists pursued much later: her photo series ""Voluntary Tortures,"" which documented women's mudpacks and plastic surgeries, anticipated the work of Jenny Saville and Orlan by nearly two decades, and she used jokes and aphorisms as a means of ironic cultural commentary long before Richard Prince and Jenny Holzer did. Recently, Ms. Messager has combined drawing and stuffed toys in more pointedly political pieces about global issues. Written by the exhibition's curators, Sheryl Conkelton of the Museum of Modern Art and Carol S. Eliel of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, ""Annette Messager"" overlooks some of the artist's quirkier early works (for ""My Approaches,"" for example, she sat at a cafe table and photographed businessmen's flies), and it neglects to clarify this proto-feminist artist's relationship to American feminist art of the 70's, many of whose concerns she shared. Still, it traces the evolution of Ms. Messager's singular vision and confirms her status as one of France's most engaging post-modern artists. Margot Mifflin",1996-01-21T05:00:00+0000

Not a single plateau but a labyrinth of plateaus, canyons, peaks and desert basins occupying adjacent parts of Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, the region remained unexplored until the mid-19th century. Since then, it has inspired some of our best thinking and writing about wild nature and humanity's relationship with it. Arid climate and rugged terrain provided seminal opportunities for the developing sciences of geology and archeology. Anasazi cliff dwellings remained remarkably well preserved 700 years after their abandonment, and sedimentary strata provided a record of evolution since the Paleozoic Era.

I've gone to clinics and stuck my arm out for those disposable needles, each time forgetting the fear and nausea that descend upon me before the results come back, those minutes spent in a publicly financed waiting room staring at a video loop about ""living with"" this thing that kills you. These tests have taken place over five years, and the results have always been negative -- not surprisingly in retrospect, since I am not a member of a ""high-risk group,"" don't sleep around and don't take pity on heroin-addicted bass players by going to bed with them in the hopes of being thanked in the liner notes of their first major independent release. Still, getting tested always seemed like the thing to do. Despite my demographic profile, despite the fact that I grew up middle class, attended an elite college and do not personally know any women or straight men within that demographic profile who have the AIDS virus, I am terrified of this disease. I went to a college where condoms and dental dams lay in baskets in dormitory lobbies, where it seemed incumbent on health service counselors to give us the straight talk, to tell us never, ever to have sex without condoms unless we wanted to die; that's right, die, shrivel overnight, vomit up our futures, pose a threat to others. (And they'd seen it happen, oh, yes, they had.) They gave us pamphlets, didn't quite explain how to use dental dams, told us where we could get tested, threw us more fistfuls of condoms (even some glow-in-the-dark brands, just for variety).

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry;The Color of Fatality,"Alberto Manguel's foreword to A BLUE TALE AND OTHER STORIES (University of Chicago, $14.95), a posthumous volume by Marguerite Yourcenar, explains that the three ""curiosities"" collected here, written between 1927 and 1930, when the author was in her mid-20's, shed light on her artistic development and life. While fruitful critical and biographical connections can be drawn between the stories and Yourcenar's formidable oeuvre -- particularly ""Memoirs of Hadrian,"" ""Alexis"" and ""Oriental Tales"" -- the stories also stand on their own. As translated by Mr. Manguel, the prose of the young Yourcenar is accomplished and her vision arrestingly mature. In the first story, ""A Blue Tale,"" European merchants set out to plunder a cave full of sapphires on a Middle Eastern island only to meet failure, death and destitution. The spare recitation and repeated use of the color blue prove to be haunting features in this fable of greed, in which a woman catches sapphires in her hair for the merchants; after she is cruelly kidnapped, her tears turn to aquamarines. In ""The First Evening,"" initially written by Yourcenar's father and revised by her at his request, a jaded, self-absorbed man travels with his young wife to their honeymoon in Switzerland. His fear of life's banality, which engulfs him as he approaches his conjugal bed, is momentarily abated by a telegram announcing the death of his former mistress, who still preoccupies him. The last story, ""An Evil Spell,"" further reveals Yourcenar's imaginative powers as she describes a witch hunt, set somewhere near the Mediterranean in southern France. Here a woman named Algenare is deemed to have cast an evil spell on a woman she envies. Pointing up the human need for scapegoats, Yourcenar illustrates how naming and becoming are one, as the villagers brand Algenare a witch and Algenare herself finds in the night sky ""in large trembling strokes, the giant letters of the witches' alphabet."" For its insight into human frailty and vice, for its language forged with precision and nuance, this slim trio of tales is richly rewarding. GARDNER MCFALL",1996-01-21T05:00:00+0000

Vachon (1914-75), who had been part of a distinguished photographic team working for the Farm Security Administration in the 1930's, did not much relish doing official publicity shots, and most of the pictures he took in Poland were put away in archives without being published; but, as they are collected in POLAND, 1946: The Photographs and Letters of John Vachon (Smithsonian Institution, $39.95), they bring back, with a startling poignancy, a time that for most of us is a forgotten historical zone. In Poland, perhaps more than in most of Europe, the war didn't really finish with its official end; and in his trips across the country, Vachon everywhere found the evidence of a continuing battle for survival, of massive social rearrangement and of still-seething political conflicts. Cities in rubble, children with rickets, villages burned to cinders by underground units fighting the newest Soviet domination, inhabitants of formerly German cities being deported, repatriates from Eastern territories being transported in filthy boxcars: this could be a terribly depressing record -- and yet, oddly, it isn't. In his letters to his wife, Vachon, despite his political naivete, wrote with great understanding not only about the hardships he witnessed, but also about the courage and dignity of the people he encountered -- and his images convey this fundamental sympathy. In the many faces of strangely grown-up children, in the eyes of repatriates looking up with stubborn gravity, in the haunting melancholy of lone figures among ruins, in a family of peasants against a moody rural landscape or a row of women salvaging bricks from a crumbled building, Vachon repeatedly caught both the pain of what had happened and the sense of fierce life reasserting itself. These impressionistic and somberly beautiful photographs constitute a deeply affecting portrait of a place and a people struggling to emerge from a terrible war into an uneasy peace.

Although it is advertised as a novel, it tells the story of the 1992 Democratic primaries pretty much exactly as they must have appeared through the eyes of George Stephanopoulos. Almost every character, incident and setting has been drawn directly from life, and the author does everything in his power to make sure that we do not miss the connections. Bill Clinton is recast as Governor (of a small Southern state) Jack Stanton, complete with bimbo eruptions, a draft problem and a strident wife (here named Susan). The pious Governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, has become the pious Governor of New York, Orlando Ozio; Gennifer Flowers has become Cashmere McLeod (with tapes); Hope, Ark., has become Grace Junction (the state is unnamed). Even the journalists are impossible to miss: the oenophile R. W. Apple Jr. of The New York Times makes a cameo appearance as the oenophile A. P. Caulley of The New York Times.

Craggy and handsome, perhaps, but sadly wanting in interpersonal skills. This explains why the romantic heroines of classic literature always end up with the short end of the stick, throwing themselves under trains and whatnot. In FRANKLY SCARLETT, I DO GIVE A DAMN! Classic Romances Retold (HarperCollins, $9.95) two writers (women, naturally) have reimagined a dozen of the great love stories, and this time each male role is played by a responsible adult who's in touch with his feminine side and not afraid of making a commitment. In Beverly West and Nancy K. Peske's version of ""Wuthering Heights,"" for example, Heathcliff is not the wild-eyed hunk who was always making scenes on the moors. Instead, like Edgar Linton, he appreciates Cathy's ""obvious complexity"" and is willing to share her in a mnagetrois. In an alternative ""Gone With the Wind,"" Rhett Butler tells Scarlett he realizes ""the antebellum South's restricted vision of womanhood has been a tremendous obstacle in your path toward self-realization,"" then offers to cook dinner for the two of them. As for ""Casablanca,"" forget the ""hill of beans"" scene on the tarmac. In this retelling, Rick and Ilsa escape with the stolen letters of transit, while the bisexual Victor Lazlo stays behind with Sam to run Rick's Place and explore ""the beginning of a beautiful relationship."" Funny but a bit predictable (Delilah encourages Samson to get ""one of those trendy new blunt cuts,"" plus manicure and facial), the stories in ""Frankly Scarlett, I Do Give a Damn!"" remind us that love doesn't have to be tragic to be interesting -- but it helps.
