He taught himself to pray, and he saw the Prophet Muhammad in his dreams. One year, on the day in the calendar when some Muslims say all of creation bowed in respect to Muhammad, he stayed up all night, looking out his bedroom window and waiting to see the trees bend. I dont know why, but I was a very sensitive kid. I had an acute awareness of splendor, Mr. Akhtar told me in one of the conversations we had over the summer.

It, Andy Muschiettis adaptation of the novel by Stephen King, belongs in the same tradition of small-town terror as Wes Cravens Nightmare franchise, though the question of influence has a certain chicken-and-egg quality. Pennywise the clown, the designated predator in It, (played by Bill Skarsgard) is, like Freddy Krueger, an avatar of deep childhood fears. And like Freddy, hes also the literal, lethal manifestation of the evil of the world. As such, he has the potential to spawn endless sequels. Hell be back.",2017-09-06T13:01:28+0000

He would give me ruby and sapphire beads to occupy me, the younger Kasliwal says, as though they were toys. In the jewelry trade for nine generations, the Kasliwals and their storied 109-year-old store and workshop have created spectacular pieces for royals (Princess Diana), maharanis (the Ava Gardner-like Gayatri Devi of Jaipur) and rock stars (Mick Jagger). In the wake of Munnus 2012 death at age 54 from brain cancer, his 33-year-old son, who friends call Sid, has emerged in his own right as a designer  and bon vivant. Munnu brought Indian fine jewelry the international recognition once reserved for European houses and championed previously unsung stones like the spinel; his son, who opened a vivid new Mumbai boutique in 2015, aims to further marry historical influences with contemporary settings in his work. Good-naturedly dodging his mothers entreaties to settle down, the peripatetic and engaging Kasliwal scours the world for outrageous gems (a recent find was an old 10-carat mine diamond at a Las Vegas antiques show) and the best parties.

Trump, they noted, would give Congress six months to save the DACA-protected Dreamers from deportation with a legislative fix. Never mind that House Republicans sabotaged a chance to help Dreamers in 2013, when John Boehner, the House speaker, refused to hold a vote on an immigration-reform bill that had passed in the Senate to a vote on the House floor. Now, NPR reported, Republicans might favor a bill introduced by Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida that would give Dreamers a path to citizenship. Overwhelmingly, Republicans tell me: Yes, I could support giving these young immigrants permanent status in our country,  Curbelo told All Things Considered,  as long as we continue moving towards better border security, the enforcement of our immigration laws.  Yet among the undocumented activists whom I got to know while reporting in Arizona earlier this year, such a compromise is hardly viewed with relief. Rather it is the Catch-22 that they have been dreading ever since Trump was elected.",2017-09-06T18:14:30+0000

But the quibbling misses an important concern about what it means to argue for a female-only canon. The power of the list came, in part, from its mere existence, from how necessary it felt. Behold the many artists ignored by mainstream coed lists! Aaliyah! Shakira! Tori Amos! Chaka Khan! Why would albums by women who rank so prominently on a list determined by women be missing from one determined by all genders but really mostly men? The question matters. This week we talk about why it does.

us,The Way to Survive It Was to Make As,"The road to Virginia Episcopal School was more secluded in those days, winding a few miles from the white section of segregated Lynchburg through a wood of maple and oak to the schools rolling campus, shielded by trees and the more distant Blue Ridge Mountains. The usual stream of cars navigated the bends on the first day of school, white families ferrying their adolescent sons. Like nearly every other elite prep school in the South, it had been the boarding schools tradition since its founding in 1916 that its teachers guide white boys toward its ideal of manhood  erudite, religious, resilient. But that afternoon of Sept. 8, 1967, a taxi pulled up the long driveway carrying a black teenager, Marvin Barnard.

A traveler, back then, was far less likely to find in the foreign traces of the familiar. Depending on where he ventured, he had significantly fewer guarantees of safety, and equally thrillingly, only limited ways of communicating with those he knew and had left behind. And it wasnt only that you could (and, indeed, would) travel as Ibn Battuta had, but, crucially, you could travel where Ibn Battuta had, as well: Sanaa and Baghdad and Damascus, all of which are now treacherous or off-limits, cities in countries forced by war or disaster or bad governance to deny their cultures extravagant senses of hospitality.",2017-09-07T12:52:16+0000

It wasnt from the nonstop news coverage on CNN and elsewhere; it was from the transmissions that lay behind it, in the pulses of information coming down from space. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, crucial tools for monitoring big storms in the Gulf of Mexico, were capturing cloud formations, surface temperatures and barometric pressures, which were then fed into computer models tracking the storms strength and intensity. At the same time, NASA was using a group of satellites to keep tabs on soil moisture, flood patterns and power failures all over East Texas. In various ways, this torrent of data was being collected continuously from hundreds (or even thousands) of miles overhead, through radar instruments and spectroradiometer sensors and exquisitely calibrated imaging cameras. The machines being used arent household names  they go by acronyms like GOES-13, Modis and SMAP  but they demonstrate why the popular view of Earth as a big blue planet with only the Moon as its companion could do with some revising.

But with racial barriers slowly going down, officers are increasingly needed in middle-class neighborhoods like Hanford Park, where white residents are literally up in arms over the black families buying homes on their blocks.",2017-09-13T09:00:26+0000

But it was not technically office space, either  it was the bottom three floors of one of the opulent Beaux-Arts style mansions built by wealthy Bruxellois during the late 1800s, in the quiet, forested area south of the city center. Belgiums architectural conservation laws had been notoriously lax, and so over the decades many of those buildings were demolished or carved up into offices or apartments. But the interiors of this one had somehow survived mostly intact, with ornate stucco moldings, marble fireplaces, wooden paneling, wrought-iron stair rails and parquet floors made in the traditional way, without a single nail.

Alice Waters? The owner of Chez Panisse and generalissimo of the organic food revolution? Back then, she happily admits, her favorite lunch was grilled cheese with pickles and maybe an orange soda, if she could sneak out to a local dinette. I think of grilled cheese sandwiches as one of the great comfort foods, she writes, before snapping out of it to become the Waters we all recognize: These days I make them with a Cantal, a mountain cheese from France thats a little like a Swiss  I like my cheese to be a bit tangy. I usually choose some good whole wheat or levain bread from Acme Bread Company. I slice the cheese and put it inside the bread, put some olive oil in a cast iron pan  not too much!  drizzle oil on the top of the sandwich, and then weight it down with another cast iron pan. When it gets really brown, I turn it over, and when the cheese starts to bubble out the sides, I take it out. Then I rub both sides with half a clove of garlic and serve it with a dill pickle or some sauerkraut (good homemade sauerkraut, not the kraut out of the can that I never liked as a child!). Or Ill have a little undressed salad on the side  the melted cheese and the olive oil from the sandwich almost dress the lettuce. Sometimes in the summer Ill put some hot peppers in. All right, that does sound pretty good. But its probably for the best that Chez Panisse never established a childrens menu.

Before the company hosts its fashion-forward gala evening on Sept. 28  with designers and choreographers collaborating on new works  there will be two weeks of Peter Martinss Swan Lake. Its all about the dancers, and Sara Mearns, who is scheduled to perform opening night opposite Tyler Angle, should start the run off right: Her rendition of the dual role of Odette/Odile is extraordinary. As the season continues, there will be three premieres by company members, the principal Lauren Lovette and the soloists Troy Schumacher and Justin Peck, City Ballets resident choreographer. Theres one wild card in the mix: Gianna Reisen, a 2017 graduate of the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, will create her first work for the company. Ms. Reisen, 18, and now an apprentice at Ballet Semperoper Dresden, is the youngest choreographer the company has ever featured.

Its like open-heart surgery, making music. Every time its invasive. The source of this particular affliction is Joanne, the 2016 album of soft-rock ballads that plunged her into a tailspin as she wondered if fans would accept her transformation from disco-pop provocateur into grief-driven chanteuse. The director, Chris Moukarbel, frames the story with scenes from Gagas February Super Bowl halftime performance, her studded boots dangling midair as she is hoisted to the stadium rafters. But its her cyclonic private life that fascinates as a multitude of producers, publicists, masseuses, doctors and makeup artists help manage her workday and the pain caused by a hip fracture in 2013. Still, being the woman born Stefani Germanotta can be deafening in its loneliness.

To be told that you have two years or one year or six months left is to be excused from a paradise of ignorance into rude knowledge. And yet to have this appointment in Samarra inked on your schedule is also a kind of blessing or special power. We expect that those facing death ought to live a little differently because of it. They have an opportunity, or so we think  to put things right, to make reparations and bequests and arrangements. To book a special experience, long desired but deferred. To prepare a statement. For artists, the knowledge that the end is beckoning may provoke a last surge of inspiration to begin or complete final works, works that invariably come to acquire an extra significance, no matter how flawed the works themselves.",2017-09-15T13:56:15+0000

Its an impressive group that includes Martino Gamper, famous for his 3D drawing project 100 Chairs in 100 Days, whose button-top stools figure in the space, and his wife, the sculptor Francis Upritchard, who helped choose a vibrant orange for the walls. The shade reminded Pilotto and de Vos of houses theyd seen on a recent trip to Lima, Peru (were currently in a South America phase, Pilotto says). Elsewhere is a hand-knotted rug with a painterly diamond motif from Ecuador, an actual painting by Peter McDonald and a bench that the designer Bethan Laura Wood covered with a rainbow-hued patchwork textile. Its a perfect complement to the brands latest ready-to-wear collection, which Pilotto describes as tropical-baroque and includes quilted microfiber jackets and an asymmetrical dress embroidered with chenille yarn. One day, he and de Vos were in the studio of the glassblower Jochen Holz and found themselves drawn to a series of glass coat hooks Holz had made, which Holz has now remade for them as a series of sculptural glass-drop earrings and cuffs. It was about playing with different materials and seeing what we could do, says Pilotto. And just such a natural dialogue between disciplines.

Not anymore.Making charcoal for sale out of the refuse from nearby sawmills, work for the desperate and destitute, has become almost exclusively womens work in San Pedro. It may have started with one widow from Bogart, a desperately poor slum, who ventured into one of the three charcoal fields in San Pedro, the Parc Du Pont, intent on making a dollar to feed her family.As Joana Choumali learned when she began documenting the women in 2013, men are happy to sell wood, San Pedros largest export, and let women keep the filthy, back-breaking work of making charcoal. Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.Three years later, Ms. Choumalis project, Sissi Barra (The Work of Smoke), illustrates the harsh reality for women with few choices, the poorest of the poor, in the Ivory Coast. While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africas fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers. Her conversation with Evelyn Nieves has been condensed and edited.",2017-09-20T08:00:29+0000

She spent two days just wandering the grounds, where contemporary sculptures (a monumental steel chair covered in antlers, a tiny wood house in a clearing) by the likes of Marina Abramovic, Robert Wilson and Maya Lin stand amid tall beech trees and, in some cases, grazing cows. (The art foundation shares the land with a working dairy farm.) Deep in the woods, Holzer found herself thinking of fairy tales light and dark. Then she came upon a waist-high stone wall that dates to the 1700s. I started following it and knew it was the site, she says. Her contribution to what is now known as Wanas Wall was to carve a different phrase or truism from her past work into a stone block every 20 feet or so. all things are delicately interconnected, reads one.",2017-09-21T14:20:19+0000

Any novice cook, not just a teenager, has much to gain as Mr. Ppin describes cooking with his 13-year-old granddaughter in his new book, A Grandfathers Lessons. The first? Cook as a family. Second and third (and these are from his granddaughter) are to set a table properly and practice good manners. Mr. Ppin gives lessons in sourcing ingredients like fish, then provides an easy microwave horseradish cream sauce for fillets. Experienced cooks should note a mayonnaise-based dressing called mayogrette, and how buttered, sugared bread fingers become emergency cookies. Mr. Ppin also delivers an excellent caramel tutorial. Yet for all his Gallic expertise, he does not ignore ribs and hot dogs: A Grandfathers Lessons: In the Kitchen with Shorey, by Jacques Ppin (Rux Martin/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $30).",2017-09-25T20:26:01+0000

There was almost nothing left but the barest traces of Leiters life  boxes of photographs, a paper lantern, an unfinished sketchbook, a lonely chair  which Halard documents in a new book. In the photographs, taken in 2015, the walls are stained and peeling, the floors spattered with paint. One can clearly see the ravages of time.

The classic pale ivory cheese with fruity, citric flavors is now available.

The cheese, made in very small batches at the Cornell Food Processing and Development Laboratory in Ithaca, N.Y., is aged for 12 months in Murrays ripening caves in Queens. The resulting Cheddar has a creamy, yet firm and slightly crumbly texture. The cow milk comes from the Old Chatham Sheepherding Company in the Hudson Valley and, vegetarians should note, the wheels are rubbed with lard from New York State pigs before the cheesecloth is applied, something that is frequently done when making Cheddar: Murrays Clothbound Cheddar, $29.99 a pound, murrayscheese.com.",2017-09-25T21:19:59+0000

He made his way down the aisle of the Bombardier CRJ 900, found his seat, 17A, in the economy cabin, then settled in for the 923-mile flight to his final destination, Whitehorse, in Canadas Yukon Territory. He was carrying a camouflage backpack, but he checked some other luggage at the beginning of his journey, two cities earlier, at New Yorks LaGuardia Airport. That luggage consisted of a high-end hunting bow and a duffel bag. Hunting bows are dangerous weapons, and when you travel from the United States to Canada with a bow, you are supposed to retrieve it and whatever other luggage you are traveling with at your initial port of entry, then escort it through customs for inspection before continuing your journey. He had entered Canada in Toronto but failed to retrieve his bow and duffel bag there, which is why, a half-hour after his flight arrived in Whitehorse, when most of the other passengers had long since gotten their things and gone on their way, he was still milling around the baggage carousel, looking increasingly forlorn, as it appeared his luggage was not going to show up.",2017-09-27T22:00:01+0000
