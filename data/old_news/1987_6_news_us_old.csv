While Mr. Furst inhabits the play with a look of bewilderment, his four fellow freres throw a proverbial custard pie in his face. ''The Comedy of Errors,'' which opened last night at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, plays fast, loose and lunatic with the original.

us,Q&A,"Q.Can fiber-optic telephone lines be tapped? A.Fiber-optic telephone lines -microscopic filaments of glass fiber through which voice and data are sent on beams of laser light - can be tapped but only with great difficulty. And the party who receives the call can detect the eavesdropping. According to Dr. Edmond Murphy, a researcher at the integrated optic components division of Bell Laboratories, the least complicated tapping method is to cut open the cable and find a single optical fiber. This fiber is wrapped tightly around a narrow rod. The light flowing through it migrates to the outer portion of the fiber where it can be picked up with a light detector and its information deciphered. Tapping a fiber-optic line reduces the strength of the signal and the receiver would know almost immediately that the line was being monitored. Q.Is baldness confined to the top of the skull or can it occur on the chin? A.The most common form of baldness is male-pattern baldness of the scalp. It affects mainly men from age 18 to 50 years and is the result of heredity and normal hormonal variations. But other medical conditions can cause baldness elsewhere on the body, according to Dr. John Romano, a physician at New York Hospital, Cornell Medical Center. For example, thyroid disease can cause a thinning of head and body hair. Dr. Romano said that once the thyroid condition was controlled, the hair thickens. Forms of baldness or alopecia, such as areata, totalis, and universalis, cause hair loss in patches on the scalp, on the face and over the entire body. Dr. Romano said that there were no general cures for these but that steroids often were effective.",1987-06-02T05:00:00+0000

The two PGA Senior Tour members each shot a 1-under-par 71 at the wind-swept Wakonda Club and won $5,250 each. Gay Brewer finished at even-par 72, while Billy Capser, Lee Elder and Bob Brue were next at 73. Douglass birdied the final two holes, then quickly returned to his home in Colorado. Player, who was last on the course, finished more than an hour later. Because a playoff wasn't possible, Douglass and Player split the total first- and second-place money from the $30,000 purse. Player appeared to be out of the running when he hit his tee shot over the green on the par 3, 171-yard 17th hole. He ended up with a 4, which put him at even par. But, he recovered quickly. His second shot on the par-4 hole from about 90 yards away landed 8 feet from the cup and he rolled his putt directly into the middle of the hole for the birdie. Douglass sank a 3-foot putt for his birdie on 18 and was left with an easy putt on No. 17 after using a 6-iron to drop his tee shot 4 feet from the cup.(AP) Horse Racing Bold Mate Wins at Belmont: Bold Mate, a stakes-winning 3-year-old filly making her first start since Feb. 7, caught Shiering Gal, the heavy favorite, and went on to a three-length victory in the featured Cresta purse yesterday.

us,Q&A,"Q.Our house foundation has had a crack for a couple of years. Now there is a new crack in the foundation in the front. I don't know how serious this is, nor what should be used to seal the cracks. Can we do this ourselves? If not, who should we call in? A.Since you don't mention it, I assume water is not coming through the cracks. So the problem is probably not serious - unless the cracks keep growing, or open up after they have properly filled. If the old crack seems to have stabilized and is not getting bigger, you should be able to repair it yourself. Use a hydraulic patching cement, sold for use on concrete basement walls. Cut out the cracks to widen them slightly, and undercut them so they are wider below the surface than at the surface. Clean out dust and chips with a stiff brush or vacuum, and follow the package directions for mixing and application. If you do want a professional, a good mason can do the job. Q.A cinder-block extension that is just 9 by 22 feet was built onto my house some years ago. I want to gut the inside and renovate it. I also want to add insulation, but because the area is so narrow, I want to put the insulation on the outside. What can I use for this? A.You don't specify what is now on the outside or whether you plan to rip any existing siding off. It is probably best to put rigid sheets or boards of foam insulation on the outside of the cement blocks. Usually made of Styrofoam or similar plastic foam, these insulation boards are applied to the masonry with mastic cement and some masonry nails or anchors. The sheets are then covered with siding. If the outside of the blocks is painted or stuccoed, the insulation can go directly over this. However, if the outside has siding, it must be removed before the insulation can be applied. Q.My house cellar has a dirt floor, and after a heavy rain it can accumulate standing water. I want to finish this space, but a concrete slab floor would be prohibitively expensive. Someone suggested decking, as long as it is firm and level. I could use redwood or cedar, but would prefer pressure-treated lumber, to save money. I am told that this can give off an odor when used indoors. Can it be used in such a damp area? A.No reason why not. Pressure-treated lumber is often used in enclosed places; one type is even used for foundations and basement walls instead of concrete. Be sure to buy the type treated for constant contact with damp soil. If you want to use the cellar for storage, or for any other purpose, cover the dirt with a vapor barrier of heavy sheet plastic or roofing felt before the decking is put down. Otherwise the cellar will always be damp and will eventually cause the house to be damp. It will also probably cause a musty odor that is very hard to get rid of.",1987-06-04T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"STORIES IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE. By Yannick Murphy. (Knopf, $15.95.) The language of Yannick Murphy's spare, stark vignettes is, for the most part, that of childhood. And while she concentrates on depicting the shadows of violence, the disingenuous flirting with taboos that can make these years distinctly unpleasant, there is also a strain of longing underneath the harsh surfaces of her fiction that usually keeps it just within range of our sympathy and understanding. The most successful of these 17 stories, like ''Ball and Socket,'' illuminate the web of love and sexual tension that must be broken by a father and his growing daughter, or, like ''Believer in Death,'' explore the tentative camaraderie of a mother and daughter who pass up Fourth of July fireworks for a nocturnal foraging trip to the junkyard. But almost always there is an unpleasant jolt of some kind: a sea of rats blocks the way to the dump; a father-daughter stroll is interrupted by the discovery of a boy's body hanging from a tree. Meant to be disturbing and provocative, Ms. Murphy's revelations, especially in such brief scenarios, can also seem gratuitous. And yet, despite their unevenness, the stories in this debut collection from a 24-year-old New Yorker have a surprising assurance. More surprising is the ease with which Ms. Murphy moves from down-home country landscapes to gritty city streets, then highlights these characteristically American settings with glimpses of wartime China, of bloody Saigon. Such bold dexterity suggests that, like the heroine of ''The Escape,'' a woman fleeing in a tightly sealed train from fighting in Manchuria, this writer may be ready to pull down the boards that wall up the windows of her prose, to try for a big picture instead of a handful of artfully shocking snapshots.",1987-06-07T05:00:00+0000

The story told of the bitter fight that ensued for custody of their infant son, Philip, a fight between Taylor's parents in Indiana and his deceased wife's sister and brother-in-law, who live in Staten Island, N.Y. In desperation, the latter couple retained Janice Miller, a lawyer who herself was once a battered wife, and last August, a New Jersey court awarded custody to her clients. But just days later, Taylor's parents defied that order and secretly adopted Philip during the child's visit with them in Indiana. Now, Janice Miller was in a new battle to retrieve Philip.

A creature of private habits, for all the fire of its orange, yellow and apple-green plumage, it apparently found the hurly-burly of our emerging nation disagreeable - and not being the sort of creature to air its disagreements in public, it quietly began to disappear. The last confirmed sighting, on the southern shore of Florida's Lake Okeechobee, occurred in 1904. More than three-quarters of a century later, dubious sightings will still occasionally trickle in to arouse ornithologists - who, with skeptical intellects but hopeful hearts, continue to entertain visions of the bird modestly flourishing around some brackish backwater.",1987-06-07T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"BARONS OF LABOR: The San Francisco Building Trades and Union Power in the Progressive Era. By Michael Kazin. (University of Illinois, $24.95.) This welcome labor history covers broad trends in San Francisco in the Progressive Era: building trades union and business interplay, the personalities and careers of the ''labor barons,'' mayors of San Francisco who came out of the labor movement and the decline of labor influence prior to World War I. San Francisco's story is unique and is one that has not been told until now. The Great Earthquake of 1906 and the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915 provided a wealth of construction work and arenas of influence for San Francisco's building trades. ''In the years from 1912 through 1915,'' Michael Kazin writes, ''every public event in San Francisco took second place to the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The exposition was unmatched as a device to boost the good name of San Francisco and the morale of its citizens. . . . It promoted a growing American commercial empire around the rim of the Pacific. It even made a profit.'' This, in spite of intense haggling between laborers and business promoters to control the exposition builders' conditions. The Progressive labor leaders in San Francisco displayed a class consciousness not evident in any other American city in the early 20th century, a time when most Eastern labor movements were weakened by internal issues. Mr. Kazin, who teaches history at American University, suggests his book ''may prove enlightening to readers concerned with the severe crisis facing contemporary unionism: an aggressive corporate elite, a dwindling membership, and an increasingly hostile political environment, the very same problems faced by unions seventy years ago in San Francisco.''",1987-06-07T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"IN VISIBLE LIGHT: Photography and the American Writer: 1840-1940. By Carol Shloss. (Oxford University, $24.95.) Like John Berger and Susan Sontag, Carol Shloss views an artist's approach to his subject as an exercise of power. ''In Visible Light,'' an extended meditation about the politics of seeing, examines the complex, often uneasy exchange that takes place between photographers and writers and their sources. There are artists, Ms. Shloss writes, who make a personal connection with their subjects, creating art as a way of bearing witness. And there are those, like Diane Arbus, who remain detached. For them, vision is ''a kind of theft,'' a tool to be exploited for purposes of power or personal gain. The author of ''Flannery O'Connor's Dark Comedies,'' Ms. Shloss is concerned with questions of voyeurism and power, how and when observation becomes transgression - or worse, political manipulation. For this reason she uses photography, a medium in which problems of ''approach'' are explicit, as an analogue to the more veiled ways in which writers work. She begins this comparison by drawing parallels between writers and photographers of the 19th century, including Henry James and Alvin Langdon Coburn. However, her thesis is most persuasive in the latter sections devoted to the American realists of the 1930's - Theodore Dreiser and Alfred Stieglitz, James Agee and Walker Evans, John Steinbeck and Dorothea Lange. Unfortunately, because Ms. Shloss views all esthetic issues in strictly political terms, what begins as a scholarly analysis ultimately becomes an assertion of ideology. For those who believe art offers something beyond polemics, her argument will seem too confining.",1987-06-07T05:00:00+0000

A PERFECT SPY, by John le Carre. (Bantam, $4.95.) John le Carre's tale of a high-ranking British Intelligence officer who goes into seclusion after his father's death is ''a first-rate espionage novel, perhaps the best of his already impressive oeuvre,'' Frank Conroy said in The Book Review in 1986. Its structure is straightforward, he said, and readers who have found some of Mr. le Carre's works ''overly Byzantine - to the point of self-indulgence - will have no trouble on that account.'' THE BIG TIME: The Harvard Business School's Most Successful Class - and How It Shaped America, by Laurence Shames. (Mentor/New American Library, $4.50.) The Harvard Business School's class of 1949 rode the crest of the postwar industrial wave to the upper echelons of corporate America. Laurence Shames' study of the class is a ''lively account,'' Louis Uchitelle said here last year, told ''with a novelist's eye for description.'' It bogs down, however, in exploring the responsibility of the '49ers for the country's subsequent manufacturing decline. FIRST LOYALTY, by Richard Lourie. (Dell, $3.95.) A Russian scientist stumbles upon a life-extending drug and tries to smuggle his secret to the West in Richard Lourie's suspense novel. The author ''is sometimes beautifully apt and original in his ideas,'' Joseph Hone said in these pages in 1985, ''as well as quick and very chilly in his handling of action.'' CRABGRASS FRONTIER: The Suburbanization of the United States, by Kenneth T. Jackson. (Oxford University, $8.95.) This history of the suburban boom and the forces that brought it about is the most comprehensive so far, our reviewer, Grady Clay, said in 1986. The author ''is at his best in analyzing the various Federal subsidies, most notably for the single-family house, that made suburbia possible and its expansion inevitable.'' NIGHT, by Edna O'Brien. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $4.95.) In a nightlong soliloquy, the narrator of Edna O'Brien's novel lies awake recalling her rural Irish childhood and a life of loves and losses. ''It is all tremendously rich,'' Sara Blackburn said here in 1973. THE EATING OF THE GODS: An Interpretation of Greek Tragedy, by Jan Kott. Translated by Boleslaw Taborski and Edward J. Czerwinski. (Northwestern University, $14.95.) The Polish writer Jan Kott's study of Greek tragedy examines the relations between gods and men in the works of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides from a modern perspective. ''He sights at Greek tragedy . . . along the smoking chimneys of Auschwitz,'' one reviewer said in 1973. ''Howls of pain and madness echo through these pages.'' THE CAR THIEF, by Theodore Weesner. (Vintage, $6.95.) This portrait of a young felon, Theodore Weesner's first novel, is ''so modestly precise and so movingly inevitable that before I knew what was happening to me I felt in the grip of some kind of thriller,'' Joseph McElroy said here in 1972. ROMANTIC IMPRISONMENT: Women and Other Glorified Outcasts, by Nina Auerbach. (Columbia University, $13.) The literary critic Nina Auerbach offers a collection of essays, written over a 17-year period, on Austen, the Brontes, Dickens, George Eliot, Ellen Terry and others. They add up to ''a fascinating overview of the evolution of feminist criticism,'' Angeline Goreau said here in 1986. THE MAN WHO LOVED LEVITTOWN, by W. D. Wetherell. (Avon, $3.95.) W. D. Wetherell, the author of these 10 short stories, displays ''a sharp, fresh eye and a complicated view of our dislocations, pains and dreams,'' Robert Ward said in The Book Review in 1986. Some of the tales, he said, are ''unforgettable.'' MARIE BONAPARTE: A Life, by Celia Bertin. (Yale University, $12.95.) Princess Marie Bonaparte (1882-1962), the great-granddaughter of Napoleon's younger brother and the wife of Prince George of Greece, was a patient and pupil of Freud's and helped establish psychoanalysis in France. ''Her story is fascinating and is told with perceptive skill'' in this ''excellent biography,'' Anthony Storr said in these pages in 1983. HARD RAIN FALLING, by Don Carpenter. (Ballantine, $3.95.) Jack Levitt is a loser, from his illegitimate birth and abandonment through a felonious life of reform school, San Quentin, prizefights and marriage to a bitter socialite. Don Carpenter's novel ''preserves the events of a life in prose polished flat,'' Webster Schott said here in 1966. He ''writes about pool, boozing it up, smashing faces and furniture, and taking the ride to Q as if he were Hemingway describing Caporetto.''",1987-06-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Faking It on Film,"This book offers a fascinating look at the cinema that flourished between 1895 and 1915 in America, before movies could be mentioned in family newspapers. Driven by a furious demand for ever-new product, what these early silent films lacked in technical sophistication they more than made up for in imaginative exuberance. Their titles alone are tantalizing: ''Smashing a Jersey Mosquito'' (1902), ''Electrocuting an Elephant'' (1903) and ''Princess Nicotine; or, The Smoke Fairy'' (1909). These and some 60 other short films of the period -several lasting as little as 17 seconds - are represented in BEFORE HOLLYWOOD: Turn-of-the-Century American Film (Hudson Hills Press, in association with the American Federation of Arts, $35) by frame enlargements showing crockery painted on kitchen walls and other delightful oddities. There are also stills from faked ''actualities,'' news events filmed with models on Manhattan rooftops or, as was the case with ''The Battle of Manila Bay'' (1898), table tops. The accompanying essays are uneven, but those by recognized scholars of early American film, such as John L. Fell and Charles Musser, are enlightening. The piece by Judith Mayne, ''Uncovering the Female Body,'' uses a one-minute film called ''What Happened on Twenty-Third Street, New York City'' (1901) - in which a young woman's dress is lifted by a blast of air from a grate - to provide a brief but fascinating summation of feminist film theory. The real stars of the show, however, are the priceless frame enlargements, augmented by Richard Koszarski's excellent photographic essay, ''Offscreen Spaces,'' showing nickelodeons, studios, fan magazines, posters and shots of early enthusiastic audiences.",1987-06-07T05:00:00+0000

Osakans boast of this passion, noting that they are unlike the people of nearby Kyoto, who discreetly spend their money on luxurious clothes and furnishings. While Osaka shouts out its gluttony unashamed, Kyoto eats in silence, shielding its mouth with a delicately raised hand. Sei Shonagon, the 11th-century lady-in-waiting who described the manners and mores of the imperial court in her miscellany, ''The Pillow Book,'' remarked that one of the sights that disgusted her most was that of a group of workmen near the palace eating their lunch. The aversion to public displays of eating persists today not only in Kyoto but also throughout the higher levels of Japanese society. But pick up any book or magazine written by Osakans on the subject of their regional food, and that phrase, ''kuidaore no Osaka,'' inevitably appears, if not on the cover then at least within the first few pages.",1987-06-07T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"TEMPTING FATE. By Laurie Alberts. (Houghton Mifflin, $17.95.) The state of Alaska, disconnected from the rest of the country, has much in common with the characters in Laurie Alberts's first novel, ''Tempting Fate.'' Alaska is separate, little explored and cold. So are many of the characters. A disconsolate Russian, a hell-bent Indian and a flaky dropout from New England move about the little island of Vladimir, salmon fishing for a living and getting potted the rest of the time in local saloons. The ragtag characters in this book have settled in Alaska for various reasons, some because fishing is in their blood, one because the name ''Vladimir'' has special significance for him, and Allie, the novel's main character, because she claims to have already ''used up'' the rest of the continent. Yet instead of being the last, great untamed frontier, the wild and woolly dreamscape that many of these people think it is, Alaska serves in this story as a sort of subarctic halfway house, a rehab center for the wayward who are presumably en route to a better life (though many, it turns out, are not). Ms. Alberts, who has traveled widely and who won a Michener award for this novel, is at her best in describing the rigors of life aboard the fishing boats; she ably evokes a climate and style of life that few will ever know, much less imagine. The scenery is vivid, as is her depiction of the life of the Alaskan Indian, whose customs and lore have been compromised by the influx of oil entrepreneurs and big business. Though limited by the sameness of its scenes (bars, boats and more bars) and an excess of pitiable characters, ''Tempting Fate'' is a perceptive work of adventure fiction.",1987-06-07T05:00:00+0000

us,THE CONTINUING HEMLINE SAGA,"SELDOM, IN RECENT MEM-ory, has a shift in fashion so caught the public's interest. The unfolding story of the short skirt has become news for all pages: front, editorial and advertising. Meanwhile, those people truly interested in fashion -the designers, manufacturers, retailers and customers - avidly pursue this new knee-baring trend. At the moment, there are few high-hem skirts available; they are mostly in the junior and avant-garde designer departments. In the new collections for fall, however, American designers have gone all-out for the shorter lengths; they will soon be shipping hemlines that hover above or in the middle of the knee.

us,HOW OTHER NATIONS APPRROACH THE PROBLEM,"Even at the seven-nation industrial summit this week AIDS will be on the agenda. In attempting to change both public health practices and private conduct, European governments have begun shaping national policies. Most require reporting of AIDS cases, as in the United States, but not testing. Most have extensive educational campaigns, though they have far fewer cases than the United States. A sampling of measures taken by foreign governments follows. France: Reporting of AIDS cases is mandatory. A few groups, including prisoners and members of the armed services, are tested for the virus in the course of normal medical examinations. A publicity campaign with TV spots and subway posters began in April, and the law has been changed to allow advertising of condoms. West Germany: The Federal Government does not require reporting of AIDS cases or testing of any groups. The state government in Bavaria has begun compulsory testing of prostitutes, prisoners, drug addicts, applicants for jobs in the public sector and most non-European Community nationals applying for residence. Britain: There is no testing or reporting requirement. Leaflets have been mailed to every household in the nation and explicit advertisements appear on television, but two researchers at the Washington conference said the campaign had had ''little impact'' on high-risk groups. Japan: The Government has proposed legislation requiring physicians to report AIDS cases and positive results from antibody tests and giving local authorities power to order exams for suspected virus carriers. Educational programs are carried out by local governments. Sweden: Testing is entirely voluntary now, but in the autumn screening of military recruits and pregnant women will begin. Reporting of positive test results is mandatory, and anyone who knowingly transmits the virus may be isolated against his will in a hospital. Recently the number of those requesting tests has declined. Soviet Union: No AIDS policy has been developed, and publicity is limited to articles in the press. Officials say they plan to require testing of all foreign students.",1987-06-07T05:00:00+0000

us,LIKABILITY CAN BECOME A LIABILITY,"CALL IT THE LIKABILITY Factor. It's as good a yardstick as any for measuring TV entertainment. Certain forms, notably situation comedies, are almost aggressively likable. ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' wasn't just nice; it was adorable. That's how sitcoms are built. Even Archie Bunker had to be a ''lovable'' bigot. Weekly drama series, while more flexible, offer their own variations, among them characters you love to hate - J. R. in ''Dallas,'' Alexis in ''Dynasty.'' One curious result is that when a new series actually throws in a few characters who seem somewhat less than likable, it is inevitably hailed as a daring breakthrough. Steven Bochco, the executive producer, has had two strong NBC entries in this category: ''Hill Street Blues,'' now deceased, and ''L.A. Law,'' this past season's trendy hit. In addition to devising a new style, achieved largely with hand-held cameras and several rotating plots in each episode, ''Hill Street Blues'' captured attention with its unusual gallery of regular characters. There was the normal quota of solid types, led by the upstanding Captain Furillo (Daniel J. Travanti), but consider a couple of the oddballs on this police force: Belker (Bruce Weitz), the growling loner who would sometimes bite the people he arrested; or Renko (Charles Haid), a cheerfully bigoted, good old Southern boy, having problems with his new black partner. These were the kinds of touches that gave ''Hill Street Blues'' its distinctive edge. But that edge was gradually dulled as the series succumbed to the lure of the Likability Factor. In time, Belker became just another family man with a nagging mother problem, and Renko turned into a model of racial enlightenment. In the process, ''Hill Street Blues'' became ordinary. Unfortunately, the same process appears to be in an accelerating mode for ''L.A. Law,'' created by Mr. Bochco and Mary Louise Fisher, formerly one of the top producers of ''Cagney & Lacey.'' Here again, the good guys are on prominent display, beginning with Leland McKenzie (Richard Dysart), the law firm's senior partner and resident moral guru, and continuing down the line with Michael Kuzak (Harry Hamlin), compassionate and good looking; Ann Kelsey (Jill Eikenberry), idealistic and good looking; Victor Sifuentes (Jimmy Smits), aggressive and good looking, and Stuart Markowitz (Michael Tucker), sweet and, for a dab of variety, merely pleasant looking. Standing somewhat outside this charmed and charming orbit, at least for the first few episodes, were Douglas Brackman Jr. (Alan Rachins), the insufferable son of one of the founders, and Arnie Becker (Corbin Bernsen), the breezily manipulative expert in divorce cases. Doug and Arnie were just nasty enough to give ''L.A. Law'' its much-lauded aura of realism.",1987-06-07T05:00:00+0000

This is a trick used in many famous European gardens. If there are no pruning leftovers, use bamboo stakes, which are inexpensive to buy at garden centers; save nylon stockings to cut up as soft ties. Finish all planting. Put out tender tropical waterlilies in garden pools (their flowers are held high on stems well above the water). Groom rows where spinach, peas, radish and spring onions matured and replant these rows with beets, carrots, chard and, if there is room, another row of beans. Be sure the cucumbers and melons have adequate space. Straighten any corn seedlings knocked over by winds. Check tomato plants for suckers and snip out these unwanted growths between thumb and forefinger. Every few mornings, snap off faded petunias and geraniums to maintain plants and sustain bloom.

The discussion appeared to be an attempt by Washington to signal concern over the missiles. Page 1 Poland's Roman Catholic Church has grown remarkably strong in the nine years of of Pope John Paul II's papacy. But the church from which he came faces serious and paradoxical problems of its own success. 1 Moscow is worried about U.S. actions building up its fleet in the Persian Gulf, but it has no intention of adding to its force of three small warships in the Persian Gulf, the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister said. 1 Richard V. Secord did not profit from the Iran arms sales, he insisted. Responding to Congressional criticism, General Secord said he was eager to reappear before the committees investigating the Iran-contra affair. 1 Argentina's army feels under siege from a civilian society that it views as ungrateful for their action in putting down leftist subversion in the 1970's. The unhappiness could become a ''boiling kettle,'' a diplomat said. 20 Western Europeans credit Moscow with arms-control progress despite American efforts to portray move ment toward an accord on medium-range missiles as a vindication of the Reagan Administration's negotiating approach, a survey says. 7 India will discuss aid to Tamils in Sri Lanka with Colombo, the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister said. India has been under international criticism for violating Sri Lankan airspace last week. 21 Mexican connections to U.S. groups supplying aid to anti-Sandinista forces in Nicaragua has led the Mexican political establishment and its right-wing opposition to trade charges of impropriety. 17 Rightist split deals blow to Chirac 3 Thatcher keeping lead in polls 13 Brazil acts against cocaine traffic 19 NATIONAL 24-35, 46-48 2,,q>The creation of very large banks should be encouraged to better compete with financial institutions in Japan and Europe, Treasury officials have concluded. The plan would permit industrial companies to acquire banks. 1 'Civics' is making a comeback in schools. Buoyed by the Constitution's bicentennial, students are signing up for courses in ''law-related education'' or ''citizenship education.'' 1 The chief White House chef retires on Oct. 1, despite efforts to persuade him to stay on until the end of the Reagan Administration. ''My inner feeling is that it's time to leave,'' the chef, Henry Haller, said. 25 A fatal nuclear reactor meltdown in the next 10 to 20 years would not be a surprise because the safety level at nuclear reactors around the country is so low, a retiring member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. 32 Gary Hart's creditors are concerned after a preliminary decision by the Federal Election Commission that Mr. Hart's Presidential campaign cannot qualify for Federal matching funds. 35 A detective's report about Mr. Hart which had photographs showing him entering and leaving the house of a Washington woman prompted him to withdraw from the Presidential race, his former press secretary said. 34 The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s endorsement of a Presidential candidate before the 1988 primaries and caucuses begin is unlikely.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"UNDER THE LAKE. By Stuart Woods. (Simon & Schuster, $17.95.) Authors, journalists, greeting-card versifiers and anyone else who writes on deadline might have problems relaxing into this slick supernatural mystery. The hero's writing block would surely give that tribe more anxiety than the apparitions that haunt the lakeside cabin in rural Georgia where he has gone to work on a book. Granted, ghostwriting the autobiography of a chicken-franchise merchant is hack work quite unworthy of John Howell, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, but a job's a job. It's hard for us to concentrate, however, on mysterious lights from under the lake and wan child-ghosts beckoning at the window when we're worrying how the hero is going to meet his deadline. After taking a hefty fee from the chicken-plucker, he scoots into town to drink all day with the boys at Bubba's Cafe and to carry on at night with a sexy undercover colleague. Mr. Woods spins a pretty tale about an unhappy family of Irish immigrant ghosts that keep popping out of the lake to tell their woeful story to the reporter on those rare occasions when he's in residence. But a good ghost story must have the power to tug the reader away from all worldly preoccupations and entice him into a bond of belief with the storyteller - ''meeting me halfway among the primeval shadows'' is how Edith Wharton put it. Mr. Woods, like his hero, is easily distracted. The supernatural sequences are too few and too perfunctory to sustain the suspense, and the ghosts themselves never come alive, so to speak. There is more flesh on the locals, a secretive group of inbred rustics similar to those specimens from ''Chiefs,'' an earlier book by Mr. Woods that was turned into a television mini-series. But we still can't forget the chicken-and-egg man, who will never know how we agonize over the writing of his autobiography.",1987-06-07T05:00:00+0000

They ask Mr. Chaikin and the associate director, Nancy Gabor, for clarification, then try the scene again. This perplexing rehearsal process is not an avant-garde attempt to replicate the characters' communications havoc (though Mr. Chaikin has long been known for unconventional directing methods).

Page A1 News analysis: The Venice summit will start with unusually modest prospects and raises the question of why anyone bothers. One reason is that the Group of Seven governments use the conferences to tackle periodic crises. A1 High and dry in Venice A8 On the border between Iran and Iraq, the Iraqi city of Amarah has established formidable defenses to halt an Iranian attack. If Iran mounts a major offensive, Amarah would be a logical new objective, military analysts believe. A1 If Iran deploys land-based missiles, the United States will view that as a ''hostile act'' that could bring retaliation, Howard H. Baker Jr., the White House chief of staff, said. A8 David Fischer received immunity from the special prosecutor in the Iran-contra affair, investigators said. He was the President's personal aide and later worked with a company linked to illegal fund-raising for the contras. A1 Rejecting austerity plans, Zambia has fueled a wide-ranging debate about the International Monetary Fund. The debate is whether the fund's policies represent the best prescription for indebted third world economies. A12 Israel's next ambassador to the U.S. has been chosen. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres agreed to appoint a career diplomat, Moshe Arad. The Cabinet also endorsed Mr. Arad's selection. A3 Organizing the Pope's visit to Poland has been easy, but has produced quandaries, Vatican officials say. The Polish Government is eager to have him come, but some say that the visit has become a propaganda tool. A13 Updates in the U.S. tariff schedule are about to be undertaken after more than a quarter-century. The new system would bring the United States in line with international standards.

A1 A new AIDS advertising campaign will be created by the city to encourage teen-agers to abstain from sex, Mayor Koch said. The Mayor said that the campaign is being created because even sex with a condom is not safe. A1 Morris Tarshis's lack of records of appointments, visitors or official telephone calls raise questions about his stewardship of the obscure but powerful Franchise Bureau, investigators said. B1 New York Hospital was exonerated by the results of an autopsy in the death of a critically ill infant during a power failure last week. The autopsy attributed the death primarily to the ''severe prematurity'' of the boy.

Camel GT sports car event after a part of the car's left-rear suspension broke. He shared the cockpit with the defending I.M.S.A. champion, Al Holbert.

us,Q&A,"Q.Why does hair on the head turn gray? A.There has been little research into the cause of gray hair, but it is obviously related to age. Scientists have learned that melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in hair, gradually lose their ability to manufacture it and eventually die. Dr. Arthur K. Balin, a dermatologist at Rockefeller University, said that about 25 percent of all men and women had some gray hair by 25 years of age and that about 28 percent eventually became totally gray. Q.Why do newborn elephants weigh so little? A.Although elephants are among the largest mammals on earth, their babies are significantly smaller, relative to the adult's size, than are other newborn mammals. The average weight of an elephant calf is 200 pounds at birth; its mother weighs about 8,000 pounds. This compares to an 8-pound human baby with a 110-pound mother and a 1,000-pound cow with a 70-pound calf. Dr. Michael Schmidt, a veterinarian at the Washington Park Zoo in Portland, Ore., said one possible reason that elephant babies weigh so little is that the female elephant has a 4-foot-long, sloping birth canal. Dr. Schmidt said that in early times, much larger calves probably encountered difficulty traveling the canal so elephant babies evolved to a much smaller size.",1987-06-09T05:00:00+0000

Page A1 The President is suffering setbacks at the seven-nation summit conference in Venice, according to American and other participants. Officials said no noteworthy economic policy proposals were likely. A1 News analysis: The Venice summit was predicted to have had ''important developments'' by the White House chief of staff. But other key aides to President Reagan sounded a good deal more defensive, especially in private. A10 News analysis: Important questions about the Iran-contra affair remain unanswered. Precisely what President Reagan knew and did will not be known until Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, testify. A1 Fawn Hall testified about details of how she helped Col. North alter, shred or remove documents implicating him in the Iran-contra affair. It was her second day of testimony.

us,Dining Out Guide; Steaks and Chops,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. THE COACH HOUSE, #110 Waverly Place (777-0303) - **(Sept. 20, 1985) Brick and paneled walls, red leather banquettes and colorful artwork contribute to the Early American charm of this Greenwich Village restaurant. One of the best black pepper steaks in town comes out of this kitchen - a well-aged slab of tender beef embedded with black peppercorns and blanketed in a dark, intensely favorful veal-stock sauce. Other good options are the prime ribs of beef and rack of lamb. Entrees $18.50 to $25; complete dinners from $30 to $37. Fridays through Sundays, 5:30 to 10:30 P.M. FRANK'S, #431 West 14th Street (243-1349) - (Feb. 3, 1984) A homey, unpretentious Italian steakhouse, comfortable as an old flannel shirt, Frank's has a pressed-tin ceiling, languid overhead fan, sawdust-strewn tile floor and a long, elbow-worn mahogany bar. The best of the food is zesty, and the portions are large. Lamb chops are tender, cooked to a delicious crusty crisp outside, with a rosy pink interior; other selections include the pound-and-a-quarter veal chop, shell steak and skirt steak. Entrees $12.50 to $22. Fridays, 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 5 to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 5 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. JAKE'S, #801 Second Avenue, at 43d Street (687-5320) - **(Aug. 31, 1984) A sleek, sophisticated restaurant with black-and-gray interior and red accents, Jake's is a good place to go for some old-fashioned beef: juicy, tender and prime. The prime ribs of beef, two inches thick, fat free and glowingly pink, are enough for two, and the same is true of the rack of lamb - four rosy-hued double chops with crusty coatings are almost fork tender. Also recommended are the thick minute steak and the filet mignon. Entrees $15 to $25. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5 P.M. to 1 A.M.; Saturdays, 5 P.M. to 2 A.M.; closed Sundays. KEEN'S CHOP HOUSE, #72 West 36th Street (947-3636) - *(March 22, 1985) The century-old landmark building has been renovated, but the four main dining rooms and gleaming old bar still have the look and aroma of a clubby masculine haunt. The star of the menu is the mutton chop, a large section of double-cut loin, charred outside and succulently pink in the center. Broiled filet mignon, rack of lamb and a thick, crusty veal chop smothered in wild mushrooms are all skillfully grilled. Entrees $14.50 to $22.50. Fridays, 11:45 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 5:30 to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 5 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. PALM, #837 Second Avenue, near 45th Street (687-2953) - *(May 30, 1986) This archetypal New York steakhouse, with its sawdust-strewn floors and walls festooned with celebrity caricatures, still plays to clamorous, standing-room-only crowds. The 17-ounce sirloin steak that made the restaurant famous is still a winner -seared under a superhot broiler to impart a blackened crust while remaining juicy and succulent within. Other reliable options are veal chops and double-cut lamb chops. Entrees $17.50 to $22. Fridays, noon to 11:30 P.M.; Saturdays, 5 to 11:30 P.M.; closed Sundays.

The plan, which would bar shares carrying more than one vote each, effectively removes one defense against takeovers; it is aimed at preventing managements from diluting existing shareholders' voting power. The New York Stock Exchange is likely to relax its rules against multiple classes of stock. [ Page D1. ] The stock market continued its leisurely rally, but trading slowed to 138.9 million shares.

Intel has bought back $361.6 million of its stock, leaving I.B.M.'s stake at about 11 percent, down from 20 percent. I.B.M.'s cash infusion, made in 1982, had resulted from its fear that Intel might not have enough capital to develop chips used in personal computers. [ D1. ] Procter & Gamble will restructure some product lines and close several factories, resulting in an $800 million pretax charge against earnings. A sizable portion of the write-off stems from the company's costly battle in the ready-to-eat cookie business. The moves also reflect the growth of liquid detergents at the expense of powders.

The search is being handled by Frank A. Olson, the company's chief executive. [ D1. ] Charles F.

Alas, that good advice is no longer followed. When we ate at Tavares in 1985, my wife asked for a copy of the menu to take home. The waiter inadvertently gave her a Portuguese menu instead of the English one from which we had ordered. When we later compared our bill with the menu, the prices were 50 to 75 percent higher on the bill than on the Portuguese menu. HERMAN HARMELINK 3d Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Fernando Lopes, owner of Restaurante Tavares, replies: At any time of the year the prices on the Portuguese, French and English menus are exactly the same. What happened in this case is that we always give an old menu - sometimes a year or more old - when we offer one to a client because we need the menu of the day for other customers.

As a conscientious young interviewer, I had prepared a page of probing questions for the venerable artist - he was then only in his early 60's, I must remind myself - but, hoping to oil the wheels of conversation, I mentioned that I not only owned all of the Segovia recordings available but had recently been inspired by them to become a student of the guitar. Big mistake. Segovia immediately took his instrument from its black case, unwrapped the shroudlike cloth that protected it, and pushed it into my hands. In an almost paralytic state, I began an easy etude by Sor, noting with interest that while the fingers seemed to be moving, no human will - certainly not mine - seemed to be impelling them.",1987-06-14T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"AFTER THE HOLIDAYS. By Yehoshua Kenaz. Translated by Dalya Bilu. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $16.95.) First published in Israel 23 years ago, this powerful novel is an ironic, biting portrayal of pioneer life in pre-World War I Palestine. What some early Zionists called a paradise on earth, a land without people for a people without a land, the Israeli writer and critic Yehoshua Kenaz describes as inhospitable, threatening and heavily populated by Arabs. He mocks the Socialists for their rhetoric on the moral righteousness of manual labor and dismisses the religious as madmen, fools and ''Talmudic scholars who had abandoned the articles of their faith but had remained as idle as ever.'' Written in a tone of quiet detachment, and gracefully translated, ''After the Holidays'' presents a cast of highly individualized characters, a number of whom are raped, murdered or otherwise die badly. At the center of the story is the deracinated family of Haim Weiss, his chronically depressed wife, Bracha, and his two mad daughters, Batsheva and Riva, who wreak havoc on the lives of anyone near them. The most memorable character is Baruch (which means blessed in Hebrew), a dimwitted, strong-backed laborer whom Weiss employs to oversee his orange groves. In a series of tragic mishaps, Baruch becomes the counterpart to Lennie in John Steinbeck's ''Of Mice and Men.'' Also portrayed in sharp detail are Borochov, an intellectual without ideas who longs to express a hopeless, sticky Romanticism in poetry but cannot write a word; the drunken cart driver Friedman, who turns his daughter's wedding into a hilariously chaotic scene reminiscent of Bunuel's ''Viridiana''; and Langfuss, the unctuous real estate broker who makes money on everyone's misfortune. While no one in this book has any lasting pleasure in life or is exempt from disaster, ''After the Holidays'' (the first of Mr. Kenaz's novels to be translated into English) is not bleak or gloomy; its oblique, dark humor turns tragedy into absurdist comedy, milk and honey into acid and vinegar.",1987-06-14T05:00:00+0000

Yet in its way, this 402-foot-long, two-story-high box of steel, wood and glass, which seems so plain, is as expressive of personal style as any museum in America. Indeed, there may be no museum building anywhere that tells us as much as this one does about the person who created it. It is a built expression of the character of Dominique de Menil, the remarkable patron who, with her late husband, John, assembled the extraordinary collection that is displayed within. Like Mrs. de Menil herself, this new building is reserved and unpretentious on the surface -but it is no shrinking violet.

Short plays are generally regarded as curtain raisers or afterthoughts, perhaps stageworthy but not commercially viable. They can be seen in the annual marathon at the Ensemble Studio Theater, or in special festivals at other institutional theaters, such as the Actors Theater of Louisville. After a brief run, they disappear (unless they are taped for television).

Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, the retired Air Force officer who organized arms sales to Iran and the contra supply operation: ''I don't think they viewed it that way, sir. I think that they viewed me as a . . . logistics operator and commercial go-between. . . .'' May 18 Robert W. Owen, a former aide to Senator Dan Quayle, Republican of Indiana, and a courier for Colonel North whose business card was found in the wreckage of a downed contra supply plane in Nicaragua: ''I was a private citizen who believed in what I was doing. I thought I was doing it, certainly, under the auspices of the United States Government, but I was still a private citizen.'' May 21 Joseph Coors, vice chairman and director of the Adolph Coors Co. brewery, telling why he deposited $65,000 in a Swiss bank account set up by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North to aid the contras: Colonel North ''. . . was very anxious to provide me with an area where he thought I could be of most help. . . . That was in the area of providing a small Maule airplane.'' May 28 Lewis A. Tambs, former Ambassador to Costa Rica, describing his reaction to the news that John K. Singlaub, a retired major general, had promised a contra leader that the United States would provide food, arms and advisers: ''. . . I said, 'You cannot negotiate for the United States Government.' He said, 'That does not mean the United States Government.' He said, 'That means we private United Statesians.'' June 4 Arthur L. Liman, chief Senate counsel, referring to an arms-for-hostages deal with Iran: ''When you were told that this agreement that you had negotiated had been approved by the President of the United States, you must have felt very proud.'' Albert Hakim, General Secord's business partner: ''I felt proud throughout, sir. I felt proud being part of the team.'' Mr. Liman: ''Did you feel like you had been the Secretary of State for a day?'' Mr. Hakim: ''I would not accept that position for any money in the world, sir.'' Mr. Liman: ''Well, you had it better than the Secretary of State in some sense. You didn't have to get confirmed, correct?'' Mr. Hakim: ''I still believe that I have it better than the Secretary. I can achieve more, too.'' Mr. Liman: ''And if this, if this initiative had succeeded, did you ever make any calculation as to how much you and General Secord would make?'' Mr. Hakim: ''In what period of time, sir?'' Mr. Liman: ''People tend to think in terms of three- or five-year plans.'' Mr. Hakim: ''Many millions.'' June 5 Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii and chairman of the Senate panel: ''. . . It just saddens me to be told that as a United States Senator, I may not be privy to certain information, but . . . Mr. Hakim can be made privy to all our secrets.'' June 9 Fawn Hall, Colonel North's secretary, describing her feelings about being asked to alter documents: '' . . . I felt uneasy, but . . .

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"A SHADOW IN THE WEAVE. By Michael Humfrey. (Overlook, $15.95.) It wouldn't be a surprise to find this novel on the shelf of some Caribbean great house transformed into an inn, perhaps written in the 1960's when the islands were waking from the long colonial nightmare. Though the book is about miscegenation, it is also an allegory of the struggle between good and evil and the choice human beings have between the two. A young, white, convent-educated woman of planter stock and a black engineer hired to work on the family estate fall in love on the fictional island of San Sebastian at a time, shortly after World War I, when the outcome is bound to be harrowing. Michael Humfrey, who was born in Grenada and now lives in England, is slow to start his story; the device of discovered diaries and the elegiac tone of the narrator, the heroine's nephew, don't help. But the mood is a foil for the book's extensive descriptions of nature. (The author, an authority on marine mollusks, has written a standard guide to seashells of the West Indies.) This paradise, with the idealized couple a kind of Adam and Eve Crusoe in exile on a pristine islet that could be one of the Grenadines, is subtly contrasted with the hellish racism of the colonials on the main island and later, during World War II, with the cynicism of German submarine crews who, sometimes fatally, disrupt the lives of the poor fishermen. That Victoria at last ignores her convent teachings - ''We must forgive them'' - and fights actively against the evil around her seems also to be a message the author somewhat didactically is trying to convey.",1987-06-14T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"BREAD AND CIRCUS. By Morris Renek. (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, $18.95.) This historical novel is like New York City itself. So many characters do so much so fast that one is seldom entirely sure of what is going on. Historic fact suggests that the hero, William M. (Boss) Tweed, must come a cropper at the end, but in the meantime one is carried along by the energy of this tale of 19th-century power and lust and by the enchantment of the author's gift for the metaphor juste. We meet the behemoth Tweed at table over a plate of empty oyster shells as he wipes his lips with ''a small flag of a Delmonico's linen napkin'' while savoring thoughts of the battle ahead. The Fifth Avenue crowd, led by the fastidious white-clad Samuel Tilden, whom Tweed has served, now plans to dump the popular patronage-wielding Tweed so as to push reform and beat back the menace of the growing Republican Party. Once joined, their battle lasts a decade, encompassing the carnage of the 1863 Draft Riots, Tweed's affair with the fictive Augusta Cordell and cartoons drawn by that relentless crusader Thomas Nast. Augusta expresses her needs in the language of ''The Playboy Advisor,'' and other characters speak in maxims such as, ''Innocence is useless . . . yet to live without it is to live without the sun.'' In sketching Nast, Mr. Renek, the author of ''The Big Hello'' and other novels, manifests his gift for verbal portraiture, but his best character is New York City itself, so young that 42d Street is lined with desirable mansions and Throgs Neck is a vista of fertile wetlands and aquatic birds. In the top hat and spittoon world of ''Bread and Circus,'' the city is, as ever, corrupt, chaotic and paradoxical.",1987-06-14T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"CONTINUO: A Life in Music. By Robert Starer. (Random House, $16.95.) The composer Robert Starer has written an autobiography of a remarkable sort. He reveals himself almost entirely through stories about people who have passed through his life, among them the dancer Martha Graham, the conductor William Steinberg and the composer Joseph Tal. The stories, graced by a writer's skill for finding the telling detail, are fleshed out with perceptive thoughts about the business of composition. But at heart, the book is much more interesting for what it says about people than about music. The author emerges as a person one would very much want to meet - modest, honest, self-critical. Born in Vienna, Mr. Starer was forced to leave at the age of 14 when the Nazis moved into Austria. He was sent unaccompanied by his parents to Jerusalem and did not see his mother again. On his own in Palestine, he came under the influence of the imposing Mr. Tal, and also met the stately tenor Hermann Jadlowker, the man whom years earlier Kaiser Wilhelm had called ''my Lohengrin.'' The author's American career began with a stint as a Juilliard student and has included work for Broadway, television and dance, in addition to his compositions for the concert and opera stages. Throughout ''Continuo,'' Mr. Starer writes in lean, graceful prose, buoyed by an evident optimism. ''I have moved from an old, decaying civilization to a young, powerful one, having touched others in between,'' he concludes. His wanderings make for an amusing and engaging book.",1987-06-14T05:00:00+0000

Lady Be Regal was runner-up, 2 3/4 lengths ahead of Chase the Dream. The victory was the fifth in 11 starts this year for the 3-year-old daughter of Sir Wimborne-Cousins Three. She went one mile on the fast track in a moderate 1:38 2/5 to earn $43,860 for Margaret Smyth and returned $5.40 for $2 to win as the favorite. Harness Racing Go Get Lost Finds Success: Before the $100,000 Statue of Liberty Trot got under way, John Hogan was worried that Go Get Lost may not have belonged in the star-studded international field. But halfway down the stretch, Hogan was suddenly thinking about winning. And once he hit the wire, Hogan not only knew the 3-year-old Go Get Lost belonged in the race, he also knew he was driving a favorite for the Hambletonian this summer. ''This is a real handy colt,'' said Hogan after Go Get Lost put on a strong stretch run to capture the Statue of Liberty Trot by a nose at the Meadowlands Saturday night. ''He can pretty much do anything, go to the front, come from behind.''",1987-06-15T05:00:00+0000

An underground detonation contaminates the immediate underground area, but there have been no leaks into the atmosphere since 1970, according to Chris West, a spokesman for the Nevada Test Site. In time, however, underground water will be contaminated by radiation from a test. There is little rainfall in the Nevada desert and the water table is more than 2,000 feet below the surface. Still, water under the test site will not be fit to drink. Mr. West said the Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Geological Survey have concluded that the contaminated water moves so slowly underground that by the time it leaves the site the radiation level would be within Federal standards for drinking water.",1987-06-16T05:00:00+0000

The star-crossed romance must have been appealing, too, since Mr. Martin conveys hopeless longing very well.

The action left open the possibility that they may be court-martialed. Page 1 A South Korean official warned that ''extraordinary measures'' were inevitable if civil unrest did not end, and that the country was plunging toward ''social chaos.'' The warning came from the Prime Minister. 1 The anti-Government protests have been an occasion for many Koreans to vent their anger at the United States. Many Koreans lament what they see as the United States Government's failure to exert more active pressure for change. 4 Are the French lazy? The country of sunbathers and cafe habitues is in an uproar over this question, prompted by a provocative new book that accuses the French of not working hard enough to compete. 1 A Soviet election with choices for various candidates will be held Sunday for the first time since the Soviet authorities began direct elections to government offices. Only selected districts will have such elections. 1 Shipments of oil to Nicaragua will be resumed by Mexico and Venezuela, according to Mexican Government officials and Latin American diplomats. The shipments were suspended two years ago. 3 In the Iran-contra investigation, Lieut. Col. Oliver L.

The 6-to-3 decision did not question a defendant's right to confront a child accuser at his trial. 7 Charges against General Dynamics and four of its top executives were dismissed by a Federal judge late Friday. The criminal charges alleged the company mischarged the Defense Department $7.5 million. 1 The Trailways Corporation will sell many of its buses, terminals and garages to Greyhound Lines Inc., thus conceding the nation's roads to its much-larger rival. 37 The stock market climbed higher into record territory, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing up 12.72 points. In the process, Wall Street weathered another ''triple witching hour.'' 37 The prosecutor in the Deaver case ''mischaracterized facts'' and made use of ''irrelevant legal principles'' in issuing a subpoena for the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, the Justice Department charged. 5 Irrigation in the West is too costly, farmers said. As water from a dam on the Dolores River in Colorado starts to flow to farms, some farmers plan to sue the Bureau of Reclamation to try to stop the water's delivery. 5 Texas' Governor misled the National Collegiate Athletic Association, a report says. Bill Clements tried to cover up his involvement in the Southern Methodist University football scandal, it says. 5 Patricia Schroeder would run for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination beginning in September if she raises enough money by then for a pay-as-you-go campaign, the Colorado Congresswoman said. 8 Doctors judged as incompetant will still be barred from the Medicare program, an organization that monitors Texas doctors vowed.

The trial of four white teen-agers charged in the death of Michael Griffith will begin on Sept. 8. Seven other defendants will be tried afterward on other charges. 31 Bess Myerson was obsessive in her behavior during a romance, according to a police report prepared in 1980. The report was not included in a background check when Mayor Koch nominated her for a city post. 29 Reacting to the Goetz verdict, Benjamin L.

us,Nothing Exotic Is Alien to Them,"Earth's first experimental space colony, City of the Second Chance, a low-density Babylon - Los Angeles has been called a lot of things, but historical is not often one of them. Sam Hall Kaplan, a transplanted New Yorker writing on design for The Los Angeles Times, wants to correct the pop image of L.A. as ''a city of weirdos on roller-skates in pursuit of deep tans and shallow relationships.'' Beginning with the year 1781, when the Indian village of Yangna was transformed into the Spanish settlement (44 people) of Pueblo de los Angeles, and moving swiftly to the boom times of the late 1950's, when 107 houses sold per hour, L.A. LOST & FOUND: An Architectural History of Los Angeles (Crown, $27.95) provides a lively, streamlined chronology of the events, industries and architects that ''shaped and styled L.A.'' The word ''styled'' sounds perfect in connection with the city's reputation for trying out exotic styles like so many interchangeable wigs, but Mr. Kaplan puts the accent on more-or-less indigenous building types, for example, the bungalow and the ranch house, and on serious architects, such as Richard Neutra, the Greene Brothers and Frank Lloyd Wright, who did some of their best work in Los Angeles. The final chapter offers a series of photographic epitaphs chronicling buildings lost (demolished) and found (restored). It is depressing to discover just how many have been torn down in the landmark-conscious 80's, but Mr. Kaplan, with the help of the volume's principal photographer, Julius Shulman, offers abundant evidence that, whatever happens, L.A.'s time is now, always has been and always will be.",1987-06-21T05:00:00+0000

If one sets up to be a writer, one should be able to write anything, from a sonnet to a sermon, or at least be willing to try. I write not criticism but book reviews.

In his brief and unrestrained memoir, Sir Nicholas Henderson commits that most unusual sin - he reveals the hidden world of Britain's Foreign Office, and brings to life several of the colorful men who served as its master. The author, Britain's ambassador to Washington from 1979 to 1982, spent his earlier career nursing a passion for anonymity as private secretary to five foreign ministers. In this high but shadowy post, he gained unrivaled access to both the intrigues of power and the quirks of the powerful. ''Private Secretaries [ are ] the keepers of private secrets,'' he writes, ''just as . . . the Secretaries of State . . . are the keepers of state secrets.'' He describes fondly his years in the entourage of Anthony Eden, the suave political insider whose gilded public career was eclipsed by an emotional breakdown suffered during the Suez crisis; Ernest Bevin, the folksy west country trade unionist whose taste for sherry was surpassed only by his success at statecraft; Richard Austen (Rab) Butler, whose short tenure at Whitehall was clouded by a reputation for indecision and a talent for avoiding political confrontation; and Michael Stewart, the most ''unsung'' of modern Foreign Ministers, loved for his bookish and quiet bearing and hated for his vocal support of United States policy in Vietnam.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"GENERAL A. P. HILL: The Story of a Confederate Warrior. By James I. Robertson Jr. (Random House, $24.95.) ''A. P. Hill came up'' is a phrase often found in the stories of Civil War battles told from the Confederate side. General Hill's Light Division always seemed to be on the spot in the major engagements fought by the Army of Northern Virginia. He was one of Gen. Robert E. Lee's favorite combat generals - and one of his most troublesome. Hill reached the level of his incompetence when he was promoted to lead a corps and proved he couldn't work with other generals. To the credit of his biographer, James I. Robinson Jr., a professor of history at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, he is both praised and damned for his valor and his foolhardiness in this book. This is a battle biography, and it disproves the romantic legend that the Confederate generals were brilliant tacticians who were outnumbered but never outfought. Hill does not emerge as a man of thought or vision; there is hardly anything in the book about the aims of the war or what he believed he was fighting for. The judgment of Douglas Southall Freeman, in the foreword to his three-volume study, ''Lee's Lieutenants,'' still stands: ''Hill was full of contradictions, able and negligent, cooperative with his subordinates and both punctilious and contentious in his dealings with his corps chief.'' Mr. Robertson's book confirms that judgment in detail.",1987-06-21T05:00:00+0000

For, according to the experts, the primary difference between a winter shoe and one made for summer is weight.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"USURPERS. By Francisco Ayala. Translated by Carolyn Richmond. (Schocken, $15.95.) Like many of the best Spanish writers of the post-civil war period, Francisco Ayala, one of Spain's modern masters, came to artistic maturity in exile -much of it spent in the United States. But until now his work has been largely unavailable in English. The eight stories of ''Usurpers'' (1949), here translated to convey the rhetorical weight of the original, serve to illustrate the author's belief that every exercise of power is by nature a usurpation. In ''The Impostors,'' set in 16th-century Portugal, a pastry chef tries to pass himself off as royalty; when he is exposed, we are given to understand that he is a reflection of the fraud already inherent in the idea of monarchy. (Not surprisingly, Mr. Ayala's works were banned in Spain for most of the Franco era.) In ''The Invalid,'' Enrique III of Castile leaves his sickbed to arrest a band of rebellious noblemen; months later, drowsily questioning his retainers, he learns that the prisoners have gone free - and that he himself gave the order to release them. ''The Bewitched'' is a quietly terrifying story reminiscent of Kafka's ''Trial.'' When a man is finally granted an audience with Carlos II, the monarch is distracted by a pet monkey, and the petitioner leaves without ever making his request. Nothing of substance is uttered, because there is no substance; late 17th-century Spanish society is revealed as a sham, an elaborate appearance of power whose center is a drooling idiot. Of course Mr. Ayala's j'accuse is not directed just at the distant past. The volume ends with the striking ''Dialogue of the Dead: A Spanish Elegy,'' in which cadavers muse about the Spanish civil war that took their lives. The tragic modern conflict is everywhere present.",1987-06-21T05:00:00+0000

Rebecca is true to her friend Sagana, but by the end of this curious first novel she is most loyal to herself. The women grew up together playing fantasy games with dolls, and in their mid-20's they share an apartment in New York City. Both unwed, they have given birth to girls, when Sagana, disgusted with Rebecca's relentless pursuit of men and lackadaisical approach to motherhood, absconds with the babies to a virtually all-female upstate mountaintop commune she has founded without Rebecca's knowledge. As the book opens, Rebecca is recovering from a fever at the commune, where she has come to seek her baby and Sagana, who are deliberately hidden from her. She is aided in her quest by a teen-aged boy who has answered a classified advertisement calling for ''Adams'' to come ''meet your Eves!'' Rebecca all but falls for him. Sagana, meanwhile waits in her hut, ready to consider Rebecca's apologies. Janice Eidus, who has also published short stories, possesses a fierce imagination; she also adroitly orchestrates intrigues. Rebecca is convincing - a woman determined to grow by her own convictions. Sagana is more eccentric, a caustic, stereotyped feminist who believes most men are ''bland . . . like cottage cheese.'' Questions in the book nag: How did the women in the commune create such an idyll? How do they survive financially? Fantasies and symbolism (a voodoo enactment with dolls) are either carried too far or left ambiguous. It is not clear if the author meant to impart an otherworldliness to accentuate the characters' idealistic side. Nonetheless, the book's surrealistic edge is inventive and darkly amusing, even if Ms. Eidus's technique is not yet quite equal to her vision.",1987-06-21T05:00:00+0000

Wallace Lawrence 3d, of the Russian Travel Bureau, an American company that has specialized for many years in tours to the Soviet Union, it borders on the black market because it can easily lead to buying rubles for dollars. And unofficial currency trading is illegal, he says. However, Mr. Lawrence adds that he thinks it a good idea to take along bubble gum to give to children.

But Volk said that Bill Walton, Boston's backup center, probably would have an operation that would sideline him all next season. The Celtics said McHale's lower leg and foot would be in a cast for eight to 12 weeks. McHale had bone spurs removed from his right ankle and a screw inserted in the broken navicular bone of his right foot. He was injured March 11 in a game against Phoenix when a Suns player stepped on his foot and he pulled it away. McHale played in 77 regular-season games and was sixth in the league with a 26.1-point scoring average. He led the league with a .604 field-goal percentage and was seventh in blocked shots. In the final playoff series against the Los Angeles Lakers, he played in all six games and averaged 20.5 points and nine rebounds per game. Walton, who also has a broken bone in his right foot, played in just 10 regular-season games and saw action sparingly in the playoffs. Volk said he thought Walton probably would choose radical surgery that would enable him to play on a stronger right foot after missing next season rather than less severe treatment that might let him play next season, but wouldn't strengthen the foot as much.",1987-06-23T05:00:00+0000

Scientists believe that animals in the wild do so to increase the survival potential of the remaining offspring by lessening their competition and that the practice is more likely when resources are scarce. The killing of young may be ''retroactive birth control,'' said Dr. Henry Horn, a biology professor at Princeton University. ''It's as if the parent is making a cost and benefit analysis depending on the environment.'' Captive animals may eat newborns because of improper maintenance and stress, according to Dr. Ethel Tobach, a curator and comparative psychologist at the American Museum of Natural History. ''A cage may be pleasing to us, but such an environment may not be conducive to healthy living for the animal,'' she said.",1987-06-23T05:00:00+0000

Page A1 The South Korean president met with Kim Young Sam, leader of the main opposition party, as they began potentially crucial talks aimed at ending the country's civil disorders. It was the first time the two men had met. A1 South Korea's economy has grown over the years despite many political troubles. While the recent demonstrations have prompted fears that foreigners might shy away from the country, there is little evidence to merit such anxiety. A1 Man in the News: Gaston Sigur, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, arrived in South Korea in the midst of a major constitutional crisis. He said he wanted an orderly transition of government in Korea. A12 A U.S.-Soviet arms control accord removing medium-range and short-range nuclear missiles from Europe is ''inevitable,'' the NATO alliance's departing military chief, Gen. Bernard W. Rogers, said. But he considers it a mistake. A3 News analysis: Congressional fears about United States policy in the Persian Gulf stem from the Adminis-tration's penchant for small-scale military ventures, such as last year's air strikes on Libya. A7 Tamil refugees' claims of torture in Sri Lanka have been denied by the Government.

Jim Thorpe sank a 20-foot birdie putt on his final hole to tie Dan Forsman, Wayne Levi and Bernhard Langer at 65 on the dry, 6,786-yard course that Thorpe said ''is playing like 6,200 or 6,300 yards.'' Tom Watson, who finished second by a stroke in the United States Open last Sunday, shot 67 in his quest for victory and a spot on the 12-member United States Ryder Cup team. Unless Watson wins this tournament or the PGA Championship in August he has virtually no chance to make the team, which will try to get the Ryder Cup back from the European team in the matches at Muirfield Village in Ohio Sept. 25-27. Watson missed qualifying for the 1985 Ryder Cup team by one shot at the PGA Championship that year. He is currently 16th in the standing based on points accumulated in 1986 and 1987 tour-sanctioned events through this year's PGA Championship. McLean Captures Playoff: Jim McLean of Quaker Ridge in Scarsdale, N.Y., defeated Mike San Filippo of Ridgeway, N.Y., in a playoff on the 19th hole to win the Manufacturers Hanover Westchester PGA Championship at Silver Spring in Ridgefield, Conn. McLean, a former all-American at Houston, trailed by three holes with five to play. He caught San Filippo at the 17th with an 18-foot putt for birdie. The victory, McLean's first individual title ever, earned him $1,500. San Filippo collected $1,000.

It was a major show of Mr. Gorbachev's political strength. Page 1 News analysis: Soviet politics and policy have taken a startling turn. Mr. Gorbachev has laid to rest any doubt about whether he sides with the self-styled radicals who have pushed to quicken the pace of economic change. He is with them. 1 Man in the News: A. N. Yakovlev's promotion to the Politburo is the latest by Mr. Gorbachev of a man in his own mold. Mr. Yakovlev is an exponent of increased openness who is adroit in dealing with the West. 5 In Seoul, riot policemen struggled but ultimately managed to retain control of the city's streets against tens of thousands of anti-Government protesters. The clashes were the most ferocious in a week. 1 The South Korean protesters's goal is freedom, supporters said. In the Seoul neighborhood of Yongdungpo, the ferment of recent weeks has drawn the interest and emotions of many working-class residents. 3 A U.S. official expressed optimism about the situation in South Korea, saying President Chun Doo Hwan was amenable to changes. The State Department official, Gaston J. Sigur Jr., conferred with Mr. Chun this week. 3 William J. Casey repeatedly misled the House Intelligence Committee about the secret arms sales to Iran and the supply operation for the Nicaraguan rebels in one of his final appearances before the panel, a transcript shows. 1 OPEC is close to an agreement on a production quota for the second half of the year that is lower than originally projected. The apparent agreement is a victory for Iran, which wants to maximize prices, and a defeat for Saudi Arabia. 35 The trade status of Rumania was suspended. The Senate voted to suspend most-favored-nation trade status to the country for six months to protest Rumanian policies on human rights and emigration. 5 In a skirmish on arms control, the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives retreated, as it agreed to drop two key provisions from the supplemental budget for 1987. 2 U.S. chides Greece on terrorists 4 Zakinthos journal 4 U.S.-Spain talks on bases recess 4 Beirut kidnappers identified 4 50 killed in Philippine air crash 28 Japanese quits whale group 28 National 6, 12-14, 32-33 Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. retired from the Supreme Court for reasons of age and health. His surprise announcement set the stage for what is certain to be a bitter, politically charged Senate confirmation battle. 1 A successor will be named quickly for Justice Powell in the hope of finding a candidate who tips the ideological balance on key issues without generating a protracted confirmation fight with the Senate, officials said. 1 Justice Powell sat at the center of an often polarized Supreme Court for a decade and a half. The Court's balancer and compromiser, he is creating, through retirement, a particular void, in tone as well as substance. 32 In a victory for property owners, the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, sharply limited the power of governments to force landowners to surrender ownership rights without them compensation. 33 The President had polyps removed from his colon at a medical checkup. White House officials said the two small polyps appeared to be noncancerous, but the results of pathology tests are not expected to be available until Monday. 1 The JWT Group will be purchased by a much smaller British marketing company. The purchase of theworld's fourth largest advertising company by the WPP Group is the industry's first unsolicited acquisition. 35 Jack Kemp's focus on minorities has been among the hallmarks of his Presidential campaign. He has called for his party to reach out to voters who are black, Hispanic, poor or members of other disadvantaged groups. 14 A Republican strategy to recapture the political initiative appears to be emerging. In a speech, the chairman of the Republican National Committee used the strategy, which focuses attention on Democratic tax and spending proposals. 14 A twin-engine cargo plane crashed three miles short of Boston's Logan Airport in a residential neighborhood, killing the pilot and setting off a nine-alarm fire, which gutted three buildings and seven cars. 6 Louisiana political challengers tone down ads 6 Indian and Eskimo births rising 12 House votes $350 million to combat acid rain 14 Regional 29-31 General outlines for an ethics code for New York State political leaders and a system of regular outside audits of all parts of state government have been agreed on by Governor Cuomo and legislative leaders, the Governor said. 29 42 subway newsstands may close unless contracts can be settled, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. An agreement with Kapoor Brothers Inc. is being terminated because the company owed back rent and fees. 31 Honors for District 4 schools in East Harlem have come from the White House, the MacArthur Foundation, and to the students, whose test scores were up yet again. ''This has been the best year the district has ever had,'' one official said. 29 A 'special independent investigator' was called for by New York State Assembly Republicans to look into allegations of improper business dealings by the executive director of the Thruway Authority, Alexander A. Levine. 30 Sale of Queens Farms Dairy's assets in New York City to John Labatt Ltd., the Canadian beer and food conglomerate, was announced by Labatt officials. 29 A law to protect freshwater wetlands in New Jersey has been agreed on by Governor Kean and legislative leaders. The agreement paves the way for the Governor to lift his moratorium on wetlands development. 29 In the Bess Myerson inquiry, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, Rudolph W.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"DOING WORDS. By Katie Johnson. (Houghton Mifflin, $15.95.) In a small, cluttered classroom in rural Maine, Katie Johnson's first graders are learning to read, but not by fitting themselves into someone else's world, like the antiseptic family life of Dick, Jane, Sally and Puff. Instead, Ms. Johnson's pupils are creating their own texts - words at first, then sentences and eventually stories. The words are not imposed by adults; they come from a child's own experience, growing out of friendships, family, fears and joys. And as they write these words - these ''key words'' or building blocks - they come to possess them as easily as they possess the feelings and images that provoked them. Harnessing the raw child power she finds in abundance, Ms. Johnson leads her classes through six stages, or movements, of doing words, an adaptation of the approach outlined almost 25 years ago by Sylvia Ashton-Warner in her book ''Teacher.'' As it was with Ms. Ashton-Warner's Maori children in New Zealand, so it is with Ms. Johnson's in New England: self-expression is powerful magic. In ''Doing Words,'' Ms. Johnson, who has refined her method in the course of a dozen years, has compiled a how-to book for teachers as well as a loving, anecdotal guidebook for parents who want an insight into childhood potential.",1987-06-28T05:00:00+0000

us,BOSTON'S CHANCE FOR ITS OWN BATTERY PARK CITY,"THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF GET-ting a lot more office space into an existing downtown: squeezing it in or adding it on. This may seem painfully obvious, but it's too often forgotten in the endless debate over the future of our major cities. There really are no empty lots in our denser and more prosperous cities; simply by being built, every large-scale project is going to disrupt something. If building a significant amount of new office space is an economic necessity, there is not going to be any painless way to put it anywhere. When massive developments are shoehorned into the existing urban fabric, they can be devastating to the scale and the quality of life of the city. When ambitious projects are built on the edges of the existing business district, expanding the downtown rather than filling it up more tightly, this growth can overwhelm very different kinds of neighborhoods, changing their character forever.",1987-06-28T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"LINES OF BATTLE: Letters From American Servicemen, 1941-1945. Edited by Annette Tapert. (Times Books, $22.50.) Generals' memoirs are all very well and so are military histories, but to convey what war is really like, one must go to the soldier whose strategic outlook is limited to the next treeline or flying mission. This book of letters from World War II, skillfully edited by Annette Tapert, who earlier produced a similar volume in Britain, paints a picture of living and fighting a war from the standpoint of the men who were doing it. The letters are the thoughts and words of men who, in the words of a Marine dive-bomber pilot, ''want to get back home . . . with their wives, or get back a job, or work on a farm.'' To John Babbitt, an artilleryman, North Africa ''looked like Florida, palm trees and all,'' but it was where he ''went many nights without sleep, many days not much to eat or drink,'' where home was a foxhole dug with hands and helmet. Officers, who censored one another's mail, had wider opportunities for description than did the enlisted men. Indeed, the letters of Brig. Gen. Theodore Roosevelt Jr. from North Africa and Europe are marvels of capsule history, sensitive and thoughtful. The book, properly, has a mosaic quality; it is an engaging footnote to history, and David Eisenhower, the grandson of one of that war's great commanders, provides a competent introduction. It is liberally illustrated with photographs, too many of soldiers reading or writing letters, but the pictures of the men who were the authors will cause veterans to pose that age-old question: ''Were we really that young?''",1987-06-28T05:00:00+0000

Mitchell Gant was stealing a telepathically controlled advanced jet fighter from a Soviet testing field. Gant, the hero of Craig Thomas's previous best-selling cold war techno-fantasies, ''Firefox'' and ''Firefox Down!,'' now returns to the Soviet Union to rescue an American agent who has evidence that the Russians are about to orbit a laser battle station. On a mission that requires enormous daring -and, from the reader, an even greater suspension of disbelief - Gant flies a captured Soviet helicopter 1,000 miles across Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and the Aral Sea into the Baikonur launching complex. Once there, he stumbles onto a military plot against the slightly dovish Soviet premier. Joining forces with a K.G.B. colonel, Gant outflies numerous crack Sovet pilots and defeats the army's security apparatus. He also kills quite a few Russians who, according to Mr. Thomas, weren't enjoying life much anyway. Gant has flown himself into a miserable country laid waste by corruption, cynicism, alcoholism, drug abuse, bigotry, etc. And, of course, plenty of cold weather. The author's portrait of the Soviet Union is harsh and myopic - in other words, about on the same level as a Soviet propagandist's view of the West. Mr. Thomas's plot is nearly as crude. He repeatedly throws one obstacle or another in Gant's path. He tells us each obstacle is an insurmountable one -then allows Gant to surmount it.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"WHEN BATTERED WOMEN KILL. By Angela Browne. (Free Press/ Macmillan, $19.95.) Are women who kill their abusive partners criminals, and are they somehow different from other battered women? These two questions preoccupy Angela Browne in ''When Battered Women Kill,'' her compelling study of 42 abused women charged with the murder or attempted murder of their partners. Ms. Browne wisely plants us inside the lives of her subjects - we move with them through ordinary courtships and marriages and find ourselves, chapter by chapter, facing a wild, unimaginable escalation of brutality and terror. Ultimately the victims, believing they or their children will be further harmed, kill or try to kill their abusers. Each woman has a documented history of physical abuse; all have attempted to escape and seek outside help; few have prior criminal histories. Most are charged with first-degree murder. Although Ms. Browne's use of personality theory to explain male violence reduces a complex social problem, embedded in centuries of inequality and domination, to a psychological one, her central findings are critical reading for lawyers, judges, mental health professionals and shelter providers. A psychologist and research associate at the Family Violence Research Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire, Durham, Ms. Browne adds to the growing body of evidence that battered women are neither masochists nor homicidal maniacs who engage in mutual combat with their partners. Look to the perpetrators, Ms. Browne tells us, as she documents the factors that may predict their lethality. Her findings are an important addition to the growing literature on violence against women in the family.",1987-06-28T05:00:00+0000

Recently arrived from Boston, I had never seen the stonelike shadowy surface of a blue corn tortilla against the pale soft green of chili sauce, the white of sour cream. The colors and textures seemed as Southwestern as adobe. Blue corn tortillas are coarser, grainier and crumblier than those made of yellow corn, and this tortilla fell apart on my tongue. That night I felt as if I were eating earth - not dirt, but food that was somehow connected to the richness of earth.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"BLESSED MCGILL. By Edwin Shrake. (Texas Monthly Press, Paper, $9.95.) Set in Texas and Mexico during the years after the Civil War, this novel's intriguing combination of personal disasters and grand adventure occurs during a historical period when both were taken for granted. The action in this humorous and macabre story includes plenty of scalping, one man skewered, three others roasted alive and a narrator, Peter McGill, who concedes, ''I didn't actually kill a man until I was seventeen.'' As the book begins, McGill is being stalked and expects at any moment to be killed by a former friend, Octavio, a young Indian better known as Gotch Eye. The novel is McGill's attempt to set down the story of his life, ''hopping over the more boring parts since I am in a hurry.'' In the hands of Edwin Shrake, a screenwriter and novelist, the device works nicely, especially since he had the good sense to give McGill a quirky but well-educated mother who accounts for his literary ability. When McGill first sees his future wife, Ellen, she is a naked child, recently orphaned by Indians. He rescues her - sort of - but not in the courageous way Ellen, and most readers, might expect. Later, he pokes fun at tall tales of the West when he travels to Baltimore and rescues Ellen, for real this time, from a school for young women. McGill's misunderstandings with Octavio, which lead to murder, are the heart of the story, and Octavio lives up to their nasty reputation. The only things that don't work are the gratuitous appendices explaining McGill's ''sainthood.'' ''Blessed McGill'' is an engaging new look at the old West.",1987-06-28T05:00:00+0000

The cassette does a good job of demonstrating most of the steps involved in cutting, fitting and installing both plywood and solid wood paneling, but because it tries to crowd in so much, some tricky working techniques are glossed over too quickly. For example, although the title doesn't indicate this, a sizable segment at the end of the tape is devoted to putting up various types of wood shelving on a paneled wall. Yet such details as how to cut small openings for electrical outlets are not demonstrated, only verbally explained. Also, the segment on putting panels up over a brick wall includes only the briefest description of the tools and techniques that are normally used for fastening wood furring strips to a masonry wall.",1987-06-28T05:00:00+0000

Welcome back to Megan Roberts, the sensitive but indomitable heroine of Hugh Miller's previous novel, ''The District Nurse,'' taken from his BBC television series. This British writer, once a pathologist's assistant, is adept at probing the dreary lives of the small southern Welsh mining town of Pencwm. It is 1927, and ''Snow on the Wind'' opens with 35-year-old Megan, a native of North Wales, trying to wall in memories of her fiance and their child, now both deceased. Two years into an intense nursing career, she is still battling the villagers' distrust of strangers and the dangerous influence of Nesta Mogg, a questionable folk healer. The arrival of Timothy Morris, a 37-year-old physician from London, seems to threaten Megan's status as the district's sole health official; she confronts the new doctor with growing hostility, accusing him of iniquity even as he is trying to do his utmost for the poor and ailing members of this superstition-ridden community. During a whooping cough epidemic she verges on nervous collapse and Timothy orders her to take a month's leave. When, in her retreat in North Wales, Megan chances on the doctor's tragic secret, her attitude toward him softens. Eventually these two extraordinary people become friends and then lovers, drawn closer by their commitment to saving lives. Like Sherwood Anderson, Mr. Miller knows how to focus in on small-town existence, and his cameos of lonely, frustrated local figures are sparing but memorable. Megan's determination to fan the sparks of life sustains her again and again.",1987-06-28T05:00:00+0000

Alex Katz, known for his boldly stylized paintings of leisurely, domestic scenes, has throughout his career associated with writers and poets. Ann Beattie is the literary godmother of the ''big chill'' sensibility and has in common with Mr. Katz a deliberate flatness of expression. In a prefatory note to ALEX KATZ by Ann Beattie (Abrams, $27.50), the editor suggests we may expect a text free of ''the constraints of art historical reference or criticism.'' On the subject of a double portrait called ''Roger and Sophie,'' Ms. Beattie writes: ''The dog, with its lack of narcissism, may have an advantage not often found in Katz's paintings. . . . Roger's angular haircut calls attention to the artifice of our shaped hair. It is brought out even more by the dog's natural softness and shagginess - a dog that we could reach out and touch. The dog is being a dog, and Roger - because he has summoned the dog -is allowing himself to be human and to be defined by the dog's presence.'' The passage is representative.

The East Germans dominated the women's events from the start and finished on top of the standings with 119 points, a margin of 27 points over the Soviet Union. But the Soviet athletes, who trailed after the first day of events at the Rosicky Stadium, had a strong comeback yesterday to win the men's event with 117 points, 2 1/2 more than the East Germans. Linford Christie of Britain scored the only double of the meet. He won the men's 200 meters in 20.63 seconds yesterday after taking the 100 meters in 10.23 seconds Saturday. Francesco Panetta's victory in the steeplechase was the highlight of the meet, as the Italian won in the fastest time in the world this year: 8 minutes 13.47 seconds.(AP) Show Jumping Rookie Is Lake Placid Winner: Greg Best of Flemington, N.J., a rookie on the show-jumping grand prix circuit, picked up his third victory of the year yesterday in the $30,000 Lake Placid Grand Prix, closing event of the 18th annual Lake Placid Horse Show. A starting field of 57 horses competed in a one-round format on a 16-jump, 466-yard course. Only 12 of these horses completed the course without penalty. The fastest of these times was turned in by Best, a 22-year-old University of Pennsylvania graduate. He finished in 61.797 seconds on his 8-year-old thoroughbred, bred on Chado Farm in Neshanic Station, N.J. Best, the leader in the Rhulen Rookie of the Year standing, edged Jay Land of Atlanta, who finished in 62.474 seconds on Leapy Lad, an 11-year-old Irish-bred gelding.

And how could his initial production of ''Dreamgirls,'' which ran from 1981 to 1985 at the Imperial, fit into the Ambassador anyway? A small house with a shallow stage, the Ambassador can't meet the physical requirements of most modern musicals, let alone those of a show whose controversial Robin Wagner set featured electronically mechanized towers and bridges. This ''Michael Bennett production'' of ''Dreamgirls'' can only be - and in fact is - a bus-and-truck touring company, stripped down by its director two years ago for fleet and economical travel on the road. When the curtain rises at the Ambassador, we see a stage nearly as bare as that for Mr. Bennett's ''Chorus Line'': a black backdrop, a few hand-twirled ''towers'' that might have been constructed with a kid's Erector set, a small constellation of theatrical lights.",1987-06-29T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q.Why is varnish usually applied only to the outside wood surfaces of a violin? A.Varnish is applied to the outside surfaces of a violin to give the instrument its shiny look and to protect it from dirt and damage, said David Segal, a violin maker in New York City. The inside of a violin does not require the same protection. Nevertheless, some violin makers also apply polishes such as varnish, linseed oil or diluted glue to the inside of their violins. Mr. Segal paints a gluey solution to the inside of his violins. ''The solution strengthens the wood and insulates it from humidity and dryness,'' he said. QDoes clear glass block harmful rays from the sun, and are you protected in the shade of an awning or tree? Can the sun damage hair? A.Clear glass blocks most ultraviolet rays, which can cause sunburn, wrinkling, freckles and precancerous changes in the skin, according to Dr. Leonard Harber, director of dermatology at the Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, and Dr. Allen Lawrence, chief of dermatology at the University of Chicago Medical School. Glass contains impurities, such as iron oxide, which absorb longer rays of ultraviolet light, the most harmful type. But the impurities do not absorb shorter ultraviolet rays, which are believed to be as harmful if a person is exposed to the rays over a prolonged period. The purer the glass, the less effective it is in absorbing ultraviolet rays, Dr. Harber said.",1987-06-30T05:00:00+0000

The officials did not say how they learned of the overture.

A18 Fifteen groups were denied rights to freedom of speech and assembly by officials and police agencies in connection with Philadelphia's celebration of the Constitution bicentennial, a lawsuit filed by the groups charges. A18 The V.A. was ordered to drop plans to close nine outreach centers that counsel veterans suffering from the Vietnam-era version of combat fatigue.

Java Gold, making his first start since April 18, was the 1-to-10 favorite as the lone 3-year-old in a field of four, and looked as if he were home free after bounding to an easy early lead. He led by two lengths after setting fractions of 0:24 1/5 and 0:47 2/5, but Cutlass Reality, who began to gain as they rounded the stretch turn, drew even with a furlong to go. Java Gold, under Pat Day, fought back from the rail but lost the duel in the final strides. Cutlass Reality, a 5-year-old who paid $12.40 for $2 to win as the second choice in the betting, ran the mile in 1:36 4/5 under Julio Pezua, over a track called the dullest of the meeting, so it was a fine effort for both horses. El Basco finished nearly 11 lengths behind in third. Java Gold, winner of the Remsen last fall as a 2-year-old, won two allowance races at Aqueduct in April, but then was knocked out of the Triple Crown races by a virus. His main goal is the Travers Stakes at Saratoga Aug. 22.

Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes, which won the America's Cup, took fourth, but entered port flying an infringement flag, an admission of a violation, and was dropped to seventh place. Kookaburra II, sponsored by the Royal Perth Yacht Club, holds the overall lead with 31.75 points. Bengal is second with 26.25 points, and New Zealand is third with 20 points.
