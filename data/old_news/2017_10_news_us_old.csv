In The Naughty Nineties, David Friend turns instead to the 1990s, when those same baby boomers were in positions of greater power: from Bill Clinton in the White House to Howard Stern on the radio to the producers Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray on MTV with The Real World. Friend finds that the decades sexual and political attitudes shaped, in ways both progressive and conservative, the ground we stand on today. On one side are widespread moves to the left on social issues. But a good case can be made, he also writes, that Donald J. Trumps presidency would never have been possible had the 1990s not normalized and formalized personal branding, reality programming, 24/7 news, tabloid scandal coverage and online self-expression.

Chen Lien Tang put the family name on many restaurants before retiring to spend time in China, New York and Taiwan. But he recently became bored. Hes getting old, and he felt the need to do it again, one last time, said his son, James Tang, who is also involved in the business. Last spring, the family opened Shorty Tang Noodles in Chelsea. Now, they have installed a grand restaurant seating about 350 on three floors in the family-owned building (formerly the Bank of China) next door to where Shorty Tang, who died at 50, opened his original Hwa Yuan restaurant in 1968. (The restaurant closed in the 1980s.) The elder Mr. Tang, now 66, designed the new restaurant, seeing to every detail, including richly hand-carved doors he brought from China. Im going to remake history here, he said. Sesame noodles, fine scallion pancakes, Sichuan kung pao chicken done simply, the way its supposed to be, just with chiles and garlic. He will also serve some banquet dishes on a menu that leans toward Sichuan heat but not exclusively so. He plans to try new ideas, he said, because times have changed. Among them are raw-bar selections displayed at one end of the bar in the front dining room, and cheesecake for dessert.

A short word like quiet or, in musical terminology, piano. That word, piano, would be repeated. It would be repeated several times. As it was repeated, we would become conscious that it had changed, that in the process of being repeated it had changed, quietly, had expanded from quiet to quietly, imperceptibly. And as this imperceptible change became perceptible, so we would notice that another deeper aspect of its meaning  also simple  was making itself felt: a basic figure of speech, a bass figure. Alongside piano and bass something else would emerge, a rustle so faint it could be nothing, a nothing stirring into something that sounds breeze-scattered: a rattle, dimly perceived, moving so slowly it will have to develop significantly before it can be recognized  measured  by the form of time known, since the dawn of time, as rhythm and, later, as percussion. At some point  though the key point is that we will not be able to say with certainty when, where or how this point was achieved  piano, bass and drums will have moved either into a deep propulsive groove or into a maelstrom of relentless intensity. And then, after an extended stretch of time, the music will subside  or plunge  back to the silence from which it emerged faintly, quietly. So this article, ideally, would unfold in a single, long paragraph as a way of approximating the experience of listening to a typical performance by the Necks, the Australian trio who, for the last dozen years, have obsessed me to the point of mania.",2017-10-04T09:00:26+0000

From this isolated, antique outpost, Kubitschek, who is 47, wields considerable influence over far-right thinkers, activists and politicians across Germany, who make regular pilgrimages to Schnellroda for an audience with him. The manor serves as the headquarters for the magazine and publishing house that Kubitschek runs with his wife, the writer Ellen Kositza, and also for a rightist think tank, the plainly named Institute for State Policy, and a small organic farm where he raises rabbits and goats. Kubitschek calls himself a conservative, battling to preserve Germanys ethno-cultural identity, which he says is threatened by immigration and the alienating effects of modernity. He identifies as part of the German New Right, which seeks to dissociate itself from the old right, which in Germany means Nazis. German political scientists, by contrast, classify the brand of thinking Kubitschek ascribes to as either an ideological hinge between conservatism and right-wing extremism, or as simply extremist  not vastly different, in other words, from the old right. Kubitschek, however, presents his views with a disarming, Teutonic idealism that recalls a Germany that long preceded the rise of Hitler.

On top of it, a layer of sedimentary rock rich in iron ore formed nearly two billion years ago, when the region was ocean floor. Then a billion years ago, Earths crust cracked open, producing a 50-mile-wide fissure stretching from Lake Superior to Kansas. For the next 100 million years, lava bubbled up into what geologists call the Midcontinent Rift, forming a mineral deposit filled with copper and nickel. Settlers first made their way to the area in 1865 in a fruitless search for gold. What they did find was iron ore, and lots of it.

us,Film Series in NYC This Week,"COMIN AT YA!: 3-D 35MM at the Quad Cinema (Oct. 13-19). Todays 3-D movies use digital projection, but that stereoscopic effect was originally achieved by having two overlapping images projected from strips of film. The revival of 3-D cheese-fests in the 1980s afforded a rite of passage to some rising stars of the decade, including Molly Ringwald in Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone 3-D (Oct. 13), Dennis Quaid in Jaws 3-D (Oct. 15 and Oct. 17) and Demi Moore in Parasite 3-D (Oct. 18). But the attraction of a retrospective like the Quads is a chance to see rare formats in action. Arch Obolers The Bubble (Oct. 14), from 1966, was recently restored for digital projection, but the Quad will present it in its original 35-millimeter Space-Vision. Instead of two projectors running simultaneously  one for each eye  as was the practice in the 1950s, Space-Vision achieved the 3-D effect using one projector and one film strip with two images in every frame. This will be the first known screening of the original roadshow version since Mr. Oboler cut the film by more than 20 minutes in 1968, says Robert Furmanek, founder and chief executive of the 3-D Film Archive. 212-255-2243, quadcinema.com",2017-10-12T21:00:39+0000

Twitter is ablaze with other women and men sharing their own stories of sexual misconduct at the hands of the powerful, spawning conversations about power and fame, privilege and punishment. The aftermath has raised questions about the commonality of harassment  and has forced us to confront our own complacency. We were compelled to talk about the cultural petri dish that allows assault and abuse to perpetuate and about what might be changing, socially and technologically, that is encouraging survivors to come forward. We also discuss the recently released Blade Runner 2049 which somehow felt lacking, as if science fiction cant keep up with the reality of the moment were living through.

He even attended the Womens March at Sundance. Yet privately, he appears to have been a sexist ogre, using his power to exploit and humiliate women.

Almost under her breath, she added, He was a reformer. Any hope for the liberalization of Russia seemed to die with the czar who had freed the serfs and attempted to modernize the country. Alexander IIs death brought to power his hard-line successor Alexander III, who initiated a harsh crackdown (among those soon executed was the older brother of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin). This would only sharpen the conflict in the country. Peasants had no bread. Workers lives were miserable and often endangered. And soldiers were forced into battle in the Great War, a fight they could not win. Alexander IIIs son and successor, the hapless Nicholas II, would abdicate in 1917.

The menu lists dishes, some fairly uncommon, in a slew of categories, like cold items that include baby sardines with grated daikon, steamed monkfish liver with ponzu sauce, and cold udon with tempura. Hot dishes, appetizer-style, include chawan mushi, and miso-glazed eggplant with seafood, with more substantial portions for items like tuna tail steak. Fried dishes, kushiyaki skewers, plus sushi, sashimi, rolls, salads, soup and desserts round out the menu. All served in a subdued and elegant setting decorated with handmade ceramic tiles. The chain has its own aquaculture facility for bluefin tuna and king yellowtail, which it flies in to its restaurants daily, including now to New York.

Despite not having any war buddies, photographs or other tangible memorabilia, he offered enough details about his service (locations, activities and the name of a friend who was killed in front of him) that my siblings, as well as his friends, his wife and his wifes family, believed he was a veteran. My mother and I, however, were never sure he was telling the truth about the nature of his service. For instance, when I was a teenager, I was with my father when he purchased a Purple Heart medal at an antiques fair. He explained that he had lost his, that it was possibly with his first wife.

I felt as if I were getting these weird directions that I should figure out how to communicate with people inside a prison. Then I heard about the Prison University Project, an on-site degree-granting college program at San Quentin, and so I started teaching a history-of-photography class. For about three years, I worked on an audio project about life inside the prison, and the local public radio station found out and offered to train us. I enjoyed it, but it started to feel more like journalism and less like storytelling. I wanted to do something more like art.

Other attractions include presentations of live birds associated with Halloween, like owls, ravens and vultures, and a costume parade with stilt walkers from Alice Farley Dance Theater, above. The Queens Zoos festivities, also 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., include holiday treats for wildlife  meat-stuffed pumpkins, for example  and a haunted trail for people.

us,A Shortlist of What We Like Right Now,"Born in Nebraska and raised on a ranch east of Reno, Nev., John Mason arrived in Los Angeles in 1949 curious about ceramics, a discipline that was then largely dismissed as a craft rather than a fine art. But Mason wasnt deterred: He trained at the Otis and Chouinard art institutes under master ceramists Susan Peterson and Peter Voulkos, and was among the first artists to show at L.A.s now-iconic Ferus Gallery, known for championing art that bridged the gap between high and low. (Warhols soup cans debuted there in 1962, as did John Altoons lyrical, quasi-Abstract Expressionist Ocean Park paintings.) In the decades since, the now-90-year-old Mason has become renowned for his simple geometric forms (spears, crosses and torqued pillars), which he fires in a room-size kiln in his downtown L.A. studio. An upcoming solo show at Albertz Benda gallery in N.Y.C. will highlight some of his towering columnar works, along with more intimately proportioned, pedestal-friendly sculptures, most of them never previously seen. Some unfold vertically like the gills of an accordion, swiveling effortlessly up from their bases; others stand stoically, their smooth surfaces defined by crisp edges. Glazed in rich, earthy hues like turquoise and burnt umber, they are arresting reminders of an artist who superseded the technical limits of clay  as well as the superficial opposition of art and craft, paving the way for later artists such as Sterling Ruby and Brie Ruais.

That effort is what has taken the chef, Mark Ladner, many more months than he anticipated to engineer his concept. Now, with skills honed in the serious precincts of Del Posto, after time in some of the earthier Batali-Bastianich properties like Otto, hes ready. Enter the restaurant up some stairs, and you go straight to the counter where the action is. Its a completely new design, and its much better, he said. Last spring, poised to open, he and his business partner, Nastassia Lopez, decided their kitchen plan wasnt working, so they had the whole thing rebuilt to make the pasta assembly line more efficient, always with an eye on the stopwatch. Mr. Ladners combination of speed and quality at a low price involves a freezing method. He offers three types of pastas with a basic marinara sauce for $6 to $7; adding pesto or meat costs another dollar, and 50 cents gets you a topping like cheese. Beverages include wine. To one side in the high-ceilinged space are plush banquettes, tables and chairs: 510 Avenue of the Americas (13th Street), no phone, pastaflyer.com.",2017-10-31T16:52:49+0000
