us,FICTION,"SNOWSTORMS IN A HOT CLIMATE. By Sarah Dunant. (Random House, $15.95.) First published in Great Britain, this psychological thriller travels well. While American readers may not find the settings - cramped, gritty New York City and the vast, sparkling California coast, among others - particularly exotic, they will find the writing refreshingly economical and astute. Witness, for example, this nice moment during a trans-Atlantic flight: ''On the aisle seat a corn-fed American in a checked jacket was already settled into a Mickey Spillane. He grunted as I squeezed past him. A man in tune with his fiction. There would be violence before I returned.'' The narrator, Marla, is a bored Oxford professor who travels to New York at the behest of her best friend, Elly. Upon her arrival, Marla learns that Elly has become hopelessly enmeshed in the affairs of an impossibly handsome, enigmatic cocaine dealer named Lenny, who's an amateur historian and is said to have killed a woman. As Marla tries to rescue Elly from an inevitable downfall, she finds that she too has become caught in a complex web of emotions: friendship, romance, curiosity, jealousy and revenge. Although it has its share of violence, ''Snowstorms in a Hot Climate'' is no Spillane; written from a feminist perspective, this first novel is intelligent and rarely predictable. But Ms. Dunant, a British television and radio producer and commentator, needs to fine-tune her fiction; she relies too heavily on secondhand storytelling to advance her plot. That's unfortunate, because the few scenes that do have ''live'' action - including a climax on a bridge high above a Scottish gorge - are truly breathtaking.",1989-01-01T05:00:00+0000

Once I was at a gathering of writers in which much was being made of the difference between ''continually'' and ''continuously.'' Later that evening, as we were watching the news (another measure of how enjoyable the occasion was), the television meteorologist announced that there was a 50 percent chance of rain for Saturday and a 50 percent chance for Sunday as well, and concluded that there was therefore a 100 percent chance of rain that weekend.

us,NONFICTION,"UNDERCOVER: The Secret Lives of a Federal Agent. By Donald Goddard. (Times Books, $19.95.) Michael Levine was a big, tough, streetwise kid from the Bronx. With a penchant for settling arguments with his fists, he could easily have found a permanent home in one of New York's finer penal institutions. Instead, thanks to a brochure extolling the virtues of ''A Career in U.S. Treasury Law Enforcement,'' his life took a more positive turn. In ''Undercover,'' Donald Goddard - the author of ''Joey,'' a biography of the Mafia chieftain Joey Gallo - recounts the life Mr. Levine led as an agent for various Federal departments, including the Drug Enforcement Agency. With a chameleonlike talent for assuming various identities, Mr. Levine was able to rack up a very impressive arrest record throughout the pre-crack era of the 1960's and 70's. Using specific cases, Mr. Goddard weaves an exciting account of one agent's obsessive fight against drug traffickers. And wisely, he does not neglect the toll taken on the personal life of Michael Levine: a failed marriage and the drug dependency of his own brother. Mr. Goddard handles the various drug operations with clarity, which is not easy given the often intricate connections that mark these ''buy and bust'' operations. However, after a time the cumulative effect and sheer number of these tales are numbing, and it becomes frighteningly apparent that the fight against drugs, as we have been conducting it, is futile.",1989-01-01T05:00:00+0000

At the conclusion of ''Family,'' a character on his deathbed reviews his life and can recall nothing but a kind of exalted trivia, a ''whole pile of random detailed impressions, that were hazy, but light as a feather.'' These phrases offer a precis of Natalia Ginzburg's method, which consists of a similar piling-up of minutiae, paragraph upon paragraph, interrupted only by an occasional patch of dialogue. At first her style may seem monotonous, flat and maddeningly repetitive. But readers willing to surrender themselves to her peculiar rhythms will soon discover the urgency, and the feather-lightness, of a masterful writer. In the title novella, the author applies her literary pointillism to the deteriorating marriage of an architect, Carmine Donati. Bored and frustrated, Carmine is subject to the free-floating discontent that is typical of Ms. Ginzburg's characters. This same crucial indecision also affects Ilaria Boschivo, the aging widow at the center of ''Borghesia.'' At a friend's urging, Ilaria acquires a cat, which almost instantly dies. A trivial thing, she thinks - and yet, ''all of a sudden, she was discovering that even poor sorts of pain are acute and merciless, and quickly take their place in that immense, vague area of general unhappiness.'' Such small-scale heartbreaks, such poor sorts of pain, have dovetailed beautifully in Ms. Ginzburg's prose over the course of many decades; this scrupulous translation of the two novellas in ''Family,'' which were originally published in 1977, only confirms her position as one of Italy's best and most idiosyncratic writers.",1989-01-01T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"REFLECTIONS ON THE WAY TO THE GALLOWS: Rebel Women in Prewar Japan. Translated and edited by Mikiso Hane. (University of California/Pantheon, $22.50.) In the Japan portrayed in this book, from the late 19th century up to World War II, young girls work 12-hour shifts in textile factories, poor farmers sell their daughters to brothels, police arrest anyone suspected of socialist sympathies and women are prohibited by law from participating in political activities. In ''Reflections on the Way to the Gallows,'' Mikiso Hane, a professor of history at Knox College, uses biographies and memoirs to tell the stories of 13 Japanese women who joined left-wing groups to fight these and other injustices and remained steadfast despite hunger, homelessness, torture and imprisonment. Details from their lives, not their political rhetoric, show clearly their intrepid spirits: impoverished Fukuda Hideko giving a precious 50 sen to a beggar woman; Kanno Sugako studying English mere days before her execution; imprisoned Yamashiro Tomoe delighting in the taste of pickled greens on a winter's day. Also intriguing is the contrast between these women's determination and loyalty to ideals and the hypocrisy and meanness of many of the men in their lives. The male comrades of both Kanno Sugako and Fukuda Hideko advocated the liberation of indentured prostitutes, yet shamelessly frequented brothels. After spending the night with her socialist lover, Kaneko Fumiko went hungry while he selfishly ate the breakfast delivered to his room; he offered her his leftovers only as an afterthought. Readers unfamiliar with Japanese names may be confused by the comings and goings in some of the memoirs, but the translations read smoothly. Mr. Hane's introduction provides good background on the status of women in prewar Japanese society.",1989-01-01T05:00:00+0000

Moshe Ma'oz, a professor of modern Middle East history at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has set out to write what he calls ''a political biography of an outstanding ruler of modern Syria,'' President Hafez al-Assad. However, as Mr. Ma'oz himself points out, this is no easy task for an Israeli. ''I have tried to remain as detached as I can,'' he writes, ''but without losing empathy for the study of Syria and Asad, with their interests and aspirations.'' What emerges in ''Asad, the Sphinx of Damascus'' is a thoughtful study, valuable for the wealth of detail and well-organized facts it presents about Mr. Assad (whose name can also be rendered, as it is in this book, Asad). It presents a full outline of his strengths and weaknesses, successes and failures; his legacy as a member of a minority sect in a land of feuding factions; his rise to power during the 1960's within the Syrian military and the Ba'ath party; his ambitions for a Greater Syria and leadership within the Arab world; his strategies for the conflicts with Israel and within Lebanon, and his harsh suppression of dissent at home. But it is clear that the material has been culled from a distance; the cited sources are, for the most part, works of history, published reports and other accounts available in Israel, the West and the Arabic press. Considering the relative dearth of material available on the subject, the book is useful as a guide to the forces that have produced Mr. Assad. Yet one hungers for what this author could not be expected to provide: the humanizing anecdote, the personal insight a biographer achieves when he becomes close to the subject himself.",1989-01-01T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"PEACHTREE ROAD. By Anne Rivers Siddons. (Harper & Row, $18.95.) The prologue of ''Peachtree Road'' promises a sweeping chronicle of wealthy Atlanta gentry ruined by their privileged destinies, a formula for blueblood decay. The plot is jammed with incest, arson, suicide, gang rape - cardinal components of the great Southern saga. Sheppard Gibbs Bondurant 3d, the benumbed, reclusive son of an aristocratic Georgia family, narrates the tale, which spans some 40-odd years of life on Peachtree Road, the axis of Atlanta's exclusive Buckhead section. Baroque rituals precisely dictate the pattern of Buckhead's social fabric, and Shep devotes his life to protecting his beloved cousin Lucy from these censorious standards. At first Lucy appears to be the classic wild-child Southern spitfire, but as she ages she descends into alcoholic nymphomania. Shep doggedly follows her from one melodramatic exploit to the next as the civil rights movement and the rise of the New South churn in the background. Anne Rivers Siddons provides many loving descriptions of the Atlanta area and some finely tuned metaphors. However, aside from Shep and Lucy, the novel teems with peripheral figures who are brought forth almost in the style of a census. We learn about their cars and homes, and the ages of their children, but beyond that they remain bit players in a drama that sets out a string of carefully spaced mishaps. The premise of ''Peachtree Road'' is that the South's rigid code of behavior tragically destroys those who live by it, or near it. But it is an inadvertent tragedy that Ms. Siddons has wrought here in her fifth novel: the epic weight of her straining theme flattens her characters into stereotypes; their machinations do not, in the end, deserve the attention she has lavished on them.",1989-01-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Not Just Black vs. White,"The stormy politics of South Africa since the emergency decrees of 1985 reaches most of us in single, incendiary images from news reports. Yet the reality of life under apartheid is far more complex than simple distinctions like black versus white, writes David C. Turnley, a photojournalist, in WHY ARE THEY WEEPING? South Africans Under Apartheid (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, Cloth, $35; Paper, $19.95). This beautiful but disturbing collection of more than 100 of Mr. Turnley's color photographs, with a superb accompanying essay by Alan Cowell, formerly the New York Times bureau chief in Johannesburg, is an unusual book. Mr. Turnley tries to provide a human context for recent political unrest. Not only does he record moments of joy, intimacy and grief within the tribal homelands and poor black townships; he also captures something of what it means to be a white Afrikaner living in a rural farming community or a rich urban suburb. And though he includes many dramatic images of the mass funerals and prayer vigils that have been the only vehicles for black activism since 1976, when the Government banned outdoor political gatherings, his most haunting photographs are those in which blacks and whites are pictured side by side as boss and worker, inextricably linked through economics, though hopelessly separated by Pretoria's racist politics. Mr. Cowell provides all the historical background these pictures need. He explores the politics behind the current state of emergency and writes interestingly of the violence at Crossroads, Capetown's most renowned squatter camp, and the inception and organizational strategy of the U.D.F., the coalition of anti-apartheid groups. Since the Pretoria Government's press restrictions in 1986, neither Mr. Cowell nor Mr. Turnley has been permitted to continue his coverage of South Africa, which is further proof of the power of their work.",1989-01-01T05:00:00+0000

us,BUSINESS DIGEST,"INTERNATIONAL REPORT The Canadian-American free trade agreement will bring cheaper ice skates and skateboards, fur coats and auto parts to many Americans. Canadians may find bargains in skis, furniture, computers and telephone handsets under the tariff cuts that took effect at midnight on Dec. 31. Duties are being reduced or eliminated in more than 8,000 categories - the start of a 10-year process that will end practically all trade barriers between the countries, freeing investment and strengthening ties. [ Page 29. ] Debt swaps are coming under fire in Latin countries. This method of reducing the region's payments - through conversion of debt into equity - is said to swell the money supply in countries already struggling with triple-digit inflation. Another complaint is that it expands foreign control of local economies without significantly increasing investment. [ 29. ] OPEC appeared ready to curb oil production under an agreement aimed at raising prices by cutting output nearly 20 percent. But experts said prices would probably stay below $15 a barrel because of high levels of supply. The accord, which would limit production of the 13 OPEC members to 18.5 million barrels a day for six months, took effect yesterday. [ 29. ] U.S. stock markets were again outperformed in 1988 by their counterparts abroad. Out of 20 countries, the United States ranked 12th when return is measured in dollar terms, outdone by Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Japan, France, Australia, Singapore/ Malaysia, Hong Kong, West Germany and Canada. [ 32. ] THE ECONOMY Superconductor patent battles now beginning could determine which organizations and even which nations control the rights to the new high-temperature materials that could revolutionize fields like computers and electricity generation. [ 1. ] Many American farmers appear to be prepared to fight on the issues of free trade that they see symbolized in a barrier the European Community has imposed against any American beef produced with the aid of growth hormones. [ 10. ] The new Banking Committee chairmen are a study in contrasts. Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the 15-term Democrat from San Antonio, is the House eccentric, ardent populist and the first Hispanic person to be elected to Congress. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., a three-term Democrat from Michigan, with business training from Harvard, is deliberative and serious. [ 12. ] COMPANIES Airline profits in the United States are soaring to their highest level since the industry was deregulated 10 years ago. Behind the boom are higher air fares and modest growth in traffic. [ 29. ] Detroit is preparing an expanded auto show that it hopes will burnish its faded image as the international leader in car manufacturing. The show, which opens Saturday, will include the introduction of several new models by domestic and foreign makers. [ 29. ] San Diego officials oppose the bid by a utility company in Los Angeles to acquire San Diego Gas and Electric. [ 29. ] THE MEDIA BUSINESS New varieties of video news releases worry some experts on journalism. Concerned about the quality and ethics of television news, they think this technique used to convey corporate views represents a dangerous blurring of news and advertising. Television. [ 33. ] A computerized ordering system for booksellers will go on line this spring, promising far greater speed and an end to much guesswork. Twenty-five major publishing houses have already agreed to participate in the system, called Pubnet. [ 33. ] A ''business magazine'' program begins today on public radio, with roughly 80 stations carrying the broadcast nationwide, making it the most widely distributed program of its kind. Called ''Marketplace,'' it will be distributed by American Public Radio. [ 33. ] TODAY'S COLUMN The Tax Reform Act of 1986 is harmful to the nation's economic health, some economists assert, because it encourages debt more than equity, a situation they say is particularly noticeable in regard to leveraged buyouts.

us,BUSINESS DIGEST,"THE ECONOMY The economy grew in December at the highest rate in five months, partly because of a surge in export orders, according to the monthly report of purchasing managers. Production, new orders and export orders all surged. [ Page D1. ] The Federal Home Loan Bank Board put on a stunning display of its ability and willingness to strike deals last week. In five days, the agency arranged the sale of 34 troubled savings and loan companies with almost $62 billion in assets. It also agreed to spend $13.8 billion to cover losses at those associations. [ A1. ] After-Christmas discounting has been restrained, because many retailers had better-than-expected holiday sales. Inventory controls have also helped to avert big price cuts. [ D1. ] WALL STREET OUTLOOK The stock market turned in a remarkably strong performance in 1988, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 11.8 percent. Some professionals see bigger gains in 1989. [ D1. ] Corporations found investors generally unwilling to buy new issues. But mortgage- and asset-backed securities and foreign issues known as Yankee bonds rose in popularity. [ D5. ] A possible political backlash on takeover activity is feared by deal makers, who are wary of stirrings in Congress. [ D1. ] Analysts are unified in their view of what is likely to unfold in the credit markets during the next six months, with higher interest rates predicted. But what will happen later is a matter of considerable dispute. [ D1. ] Year-end bonuses will be especially generous for mergers and acquisitions specialists at some big firms. Most stock and bond traders have less to look forward to. [ D4. ] Companies involved in big takeovers are notably absent from the list of the year's top winners and losers on the Big Board. [ D10. ] The American Stock Exchange was the nation's strongest market, in general, in 1988. Its market-value index rose 17.5 percent. [ D12. ] The over-the-counter market grew strongly, with healthy gains by companies that were sold or put into play. [ D13. ] MARKETS The dollar varied little in currency trading in Frankfurt. Most markets were closed yesterday for the New Year's holiday. [ D16. ] INTERNATIONAL American meat exporters have found alternative markets for many products they normally sell to Europe. But the industry will not escape some harm from the European Community's ban on beef produced with growth hormones. Prices of organ meats are expected to decline in the U.S. as supplies increase. [ D1. ] COMPANIES A revamped Christian Science Monitor is being introduced today. The changes, which include fewer pages, color photography and less advertising, prompted the resignations in November of three top editors. [ D8. ] Florida officials have filed suit to halt $7 blood-cholesterol tests by a company, Heart Chek, in what could be a test case for a fledgling industry. [ A17. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS Charles Schwab expects a better year for brokers in 1989, but he concedes that strong competition may drive some firms out of business and lead to more acquisitions. Talking Business. [ D2. ] Corporate profits rose faster than predicted a year ago, but the outlook for 1989 is for more modest gains. Industries dependent on capital spending and exports are expected to perform the best, analysts say. Market Place. [ D5. ] Braniff named McKinney & Silver as its agency of record. Analysts expect the airline to reposition itself as a carrier for business people who travel to smaller cities. Advertising. [ D9. ]",1989-01-03T05:00:00+0000

Johnson was banned for two years after testing positive for steroid use following his victory in the 100-meter dash at the Seoul Olympics. In a magazine interview published yesterday, Thompson said: ''I hope the authorities make sure that Ben Johnson can never run again because of the damage he has done to the sport. I can't believe he could be back in two years. I think someone of his stature should be made an example of. Until we ban people for life, we are not taking the problem seriously enough. I think many of us don't have the best interests of the sport at heart - and that's indefensible because we are supposed to be the moral guardians of the sport.'' In the interview with Athletics Today, a weekly track and field magazine published in Britain, Thompson also said that drugs and commercialism have so tainted track and field that he would not want his young daughter to enter the sport when she grows up.",1989-01-05T05:00:00+0000

''I really think I'm being made the fall guy and I think this was a set-up deal from the beginning,'' Sumner was quoted as saying. ''From the way it's turned out, I think this has been in Shanahan's mind from the beginning. I know one thing; he wasn't ready for the job.'' Shanahan, at 36 the league's youngest coach, responded by saying, ''I had a lot of respect for Charlie as a person and what he's accomplished in the profession. But I felt a change was necessary in the best interests of the organization.''(AP)",1989-01-05T05:00:00+0000

The game was played in Richfield, Ohio. Cleveland, which improved its record to 23-5, extended its franchise record for consecutive victories in a season. It also matched the team record for consecutive victories set over two seasons (1977-78 and 1978-79). The Cavaliers' Craig Ehlo neutralized Chicago's Michael Jordan in the fourth quarter, limiting him to 2 points in the period until Jordan made a 3-point shot with 28 seconds to go. Jordan finished with 32 points, 20 of them in the first half. A dunk by the Bulls' Horace Grant tied the score for the 20th time at 90-90 with four minutes left. Harper then took control, making a scoop shot, a short jumper, a free throw and a fast-break layup off a steal to put Cleveland up by 97-90 with 1 minute 40 seconds to play. Jordan's 3-pointer got Chicago within 4 with 28 seconds left, but the Bulls could get no closer. Larry Nance led Cleveland with 24 points and Harper scored 20.(AP) Spurs 119, 76ers 104: Willie Anderson, a rookie, scored a career-high 36 points last night as San Antonio, playing at home, handed Philadelphia its fourth straight loss.

The game was played in Bloomington, Minn. The North Stars entered the game with only 28 power-play goals in 190 opportunities for a league-low 14.7 percent success ratio. The Flyers, who came into the game with the league's top-ranked power play, were 0 for 6. Philadelphia had won 10 of its last 11 games, all with Ron Hextall in goal. But Hextall was victimized by two long and relatively weak shots in the third period, including Habscheid's game-winner. With Moe Mantha, a former North Star, in the penalty box and the score tied at 3-3, Habscheid took a pass from Neal Broten at the point and took a low, bouncing shot that eluded Hextall.(AP) Blues 5, Dynamo Riga 0: Tony Hrkac scored a goal and added two assists, leading St. Louis to the victory last night in St. Louis. It was the fourth loss in six games for the Soviet team. The shutout went to Pat Jablonski, who was called up for the game from the Blues' Peoria farm team in the International League. He had won only three games for Peoria this season and did not have a shutout. Riga's record dropped to 1-4-1 on its seven-game tour of the United States.

The spacious dining room has an opulent look, with banquettes and an impressive carved-wood ceiling. Familiar Italian dishes are prepared with flair: fresh salmon and green peppercorns are added to fettuccine in a light cream sauce; gnocchi are tossed in a pesto sauce with a crunch of pine nuts and thin green beans.

us,Iran-Contra Events Span the Reagan Era,"Aug. 4, 1981 Maj. Oliver L. North of the Marine Corps is assigned to duty at the White House with the National Security Council. December 1981 President Reagan signs a ''finding'' authorizing a covert Central Intelligence Agency operation to support the Nicaraguan rebels, or contras. December 1982 The first Boland amendment becomes law barring use of Federal money to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua. Various versions of the amendment are in effect until October 1986. Spring 1983 North is assigned by N.S.C. superiors as the White House link to the contras. February 1985 Using a series of dummy corporations in Switzerland and elsewhere, North, now a lieutenant colonel, and two associates, Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim, make the first of six purchases of arms for the contras. Money comes from a secret $24 million contribution by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. North and his associates eventually spend $16.5 million for military aid for the contras. Hakim, Secord and a third associate, Thomas C. Clines, will retain for themselves $4.4 million in commissions. Summer 1985 Press accounts link North to a private network supplying military aid to the contras. North suggests to his N.S.C. superior, Robert C. McFarlane, that he rewrite secret White House documents to conceal his role in the contra aid effort. McFarlane rejects the suggestion, but later tells Congress that North ''did not solicit funds or other support for military or paramilitary activities.'' Early July 1985 Israeli Government officials tell McFarlane that Iran wishes to open a ''political discourse'' with the United States, an overture that soon leads to the first shipment of American arms to Iran and the release of an American hostage. July 1985 Secord agrees to begin an airlift operation to supply the contras. Nov. 19, 1985 North is drafted by McFarlane to handle logistics for a second shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. He turns to Secord, telling him in a letter that his ''discrete'' assistance is again required ''in support of our national interest.'' The North-Secord-Hakim network ferrying arms to the contras assumes a role as the agent for future secret shipments of American arms to Iran. April 4, 1986 In a memorandum, North outlines a plan to have $12 million in profits from the Iran arms sales diverted to the contras. The memo is prepared for John M. Poindexter, who has succeeded McFarlane as NSC adviser, to relay to the President. Poindexter later testifies that he never showed the memo to the President. May 25, 1986 McFarlane, North and other American officials fly to Teheran, carrying spare parts for Iran's Hawk antiaircraft missiles. They spend four days meeting with Iranian officials, unsuccessfuly trying to win the release of all the American hostages. Aug. 6, 1986 North meets with 11 members of the House Intelligence Committee and denies raising money for the contras or offering them military advice. Later North testifies that he lied in this session. Oct. 5, 1986 A cargo plane carrying arms to the contras, part of the North-Secord resupply operation, is shot down over Nicaragua. Three crewmen are killed and a fourth is captured. Nov. 3-6, 1986 Press accounts say the United States sent arms to Iran. Nov. 12-19, 1986 North and other White House officials prepare increasingly inaccurate chronologies of events in the Iran affair. Nov. 21, 1986 North is told that Justice Department officials will inspect his files the next day, and he begins shredding documents. Nov. 22, 1986 Justice Department officials discover in North's office an April 1986 memo to the President that mentions the diversion of Iran-arms sale money to the contras. Nov. 23, 1986 North meets privately with McFarlane and assures him that the diversion of arms money was approved by the White House. North meets with Attorney General Meese and tells him there was a diversion of funds. Nov. 24, 1986 Meese goes to the White House and tells the President of the diversion. Nov. 25, 1986 Meese announces the diversion of money from the Iran arms sales to the contras. President announces Poindexter's resignation and North's dismissal. July 7, 1987 Under a grant of limited immunity, North begins six days of televised testimony before the Congressional committees investigating the affair. He says he has no idea if the President had any knowledge of the diversion of funds to the contras. He also says that William Casey approved the diversion and that the arms sales were originally intended as an exchange for the hostages. Jan. 19, 1988 The Supreme Court upholds the prosecutorial power of Lawrence M. Walsh, the special prosecutor, in the Iran-contra criminal inquiry. March 16, 1988 North, Poindexter, Secord and Hakim are indicted on charges of conspiring to defraud the Government by illegally providing the contras with funds from the sale of American weapons to Iran. March 18, 1988 North resigns from the Marine Corps and says he might subpoena ''the highest-ranking officials of our Government'' to defend himself against criminal charges. June 8, 1988 Judge orders that North and his three co-defendants be tried separately. Nov. 21, 1988 Judge says he will grant North's lawyers ''wide latitude'' to cross-examine Government witnesses about ''involvement in sensitive matters.'' Nov. 30, 1988 White House announces that it intends to stop the release of secret documents North wants to use in his defense. Dec. 1, 1988 President rules out a pardon for North, but says the White House has a ''duty'' to withhold certain classified documents. Dec. 12, 1988 Judge rejects bulk of the defense's demand to use 30,000 pages of secret documents as evidence. Gives defense attorneys until Jan. 3 to select 300 classified documents for public disclosure in the trial. Dec. 21, 1988 Judge sets Jan. 31, as date of North's trial. Dec. 30, 1988 Reagan and Vice President Bush are subpoenaed to testify as defense witnesses. Jan. 5, 1989 Walsh asks the court to dismiss the two main charges against North because of the problems over the use of classified documents.",1989-01-06T05:00:00+0000

HAZELTINE CORPORATION: A Greenlawn, L.I., manufacturer of military electronic systems.In 1986, the company, which also has plants in Massachusetts, was bought by the Emerson Electric Company of St. Louis. In 1988, Hazeltine had sales of about $158 million, 2.4 percent of Emerson's $6.7 billion in revenues. TELEDYNE INDUSTRIES, a subsidiary of Teledyne Inc. of Los Angeles, is a major manufacturer of airplane engines, making half the general aviation piston engines in the United States. The company also makes airframe structures, robot and remote control aircraft, spacecraft and drone systems. Its sales for the nine months ended Sept. 30 were $2.56 billion, up from $2.41 billion for the 1987 period. Net income amounted to $293.6 million compared to $218.4 million the year before. Stuart E. Berlin: The only Government employee indicted, he headed the ship systems engineering branch of the Naval Air Systems Command from October 1986 until he was reassigned by the Pentagon last June. A Navy procurement specialist, he faces charges of accepting bribes in exchange for providing classified information. Court documents say Berlin provided information to Teledyne and Hazeltine. William L. Parkin: An Alexandria, Va., consultant, he worked in the Navy's Joint Cruise Missile Project from 1977 to 1983. According to court papers released earlier, he was hired by Hazeltine to get inside information from the Pentagon that would allow the company to compete for a $15.9 million contract for battlefield equipment. The indictments said Teledyne agreed to pay the Parkin firm $160,000 to obtain information. Fred H. Lackner: A Woodland Hills, Calif., consultant, he worked for several aerospace companies, including a Northrop Corporation electronics unit in Hawthorne, Calif., the Stromberg Carlson Corporation in Winter Park, Fla., then a unit of the General Dynamics Corporation and later a division of the United Technologies Corporation, and the systems development unit of the Unisys Corporation. The indictment said Mr. Lackner and Mr. Berlin struck an agreement that Mr. Berlin would help Teledyne win a contract in exchange for money. Joseph Colarusso: A former senior vice president of Hazeltine who worked at the Greenlawn office, he joined the company in 1959 and was appointed senior vice president in 1984. He resigned last month. He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the Government and commit wire fraud. Charles Furciniti: A former marketing representative of Hazeltine who held the title of vice president, he worked for the company for 20 years, resigning last May to take a post with another company. Like Mr. Colarusso, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the Government and commit wire fraud. Michael Savaides: A Washington-based lobbyist for Teledyne, the Government said he had a financial relationship with Mr. Parkin. Affadavits showed that Mr. Parkin, Mr. Berlin and Mr. Savaides had planned at one time to divide $150,000 from Teledyne. Source: Associated Press",1989-01-07T05:00:00+0000

(Dufour Editions, Cloth, $27.50; Paper, $13.95.) For a few years in the mid-1880's, the eyes of the Russian literary world turned to Vsevolod Garshin. Dostoyevsky and Turgenev were dead, Tolstoy had given up writing and Chekhov was just beginning. Garshin seemed to be the rising star. But his suicide in 1888 at the age of 33, after only a decade of writing that produced a handful of stories, cut short those expectations and relegated Garshin to obscurity outside Russia. Nevertheless, as this ably translated collection proves, Garshin was a powerful, innovative writer of unusually broad stylistic range. He wrote lyrical children's fables as well as brutally realistic war stories. And while Garshin borrowed from his more famous predecessors, particularly Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, he did so with original results. For example, in ''The Signal,'' which tells of two peasant railroad workers oppressed by poverty and corrupt officials, he challenged Tolstoy's view of the Russian peasant as a wise, Christlike figure. Garshin also showed a surprisingly modern insight into human psychology. His stories are full of the senseless, bloody horror of war, the dehumanizing effects of poverty and disease, the innate cruelty of life. And his heroes face a timeless dilemma: they are tortured by the suffering they see all around them, frustrated by their inability to do anything about it, yet morally unable to ignore it.",1989-01-08T05:00:00+0000

There was speculation that Mr. Dukakis was making early preparation for a 1992 Presidential run, and at least one Democratic political consultant said the Governor had ''started to plant the seeds'' for such a campaign. But Dukakis aides insisted that it was too early to speculate, and the 55-year-old Governor offered only vague hints at his plans, saying, ''Public policy and public service is what I'm all about.''",1989-01-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Tasteful to Tasteless With a Flick of the Dial,"What's it to be: gentility or barbarity? Television can give you either, as long as a demand is detected. On tonight's Masterpiece Theater presentation, ''A Wreath of Roses,'' we can find British actors bringing a familiar measure of good taste and, yes, exquisite manners to a violence-tinged tale of loneliness. Then, in the barbarity sweepstakes, some of the extremes have reached a point that must give pause to students of contemporary civilization. Submitted for evidence is ''The Diceman Cometh,'' a Home Box Office ''On Location'' comedy special that had its debut New Year's Eve and will be rattling around the HBO schedule for a couple more weeks. The star is Andrew ''Dice'' Clay, a former Brooklynite who has parlayed street-corner lewdness into a presumably profitable gig. The pay-cable service is carefully promising that the program will never be shown earlier than midnight. As one executive murmurs: ''Put the children away for this one.'' Masterpiece Theater is undergoing some basic changes this season. There will be more ''one-shot'' dramas, presented in a single evening instead of being stretched into a mini-series. And there will be fewer pieces done in period costumes. Coming up in a few weeks, on Feb. 12, for example, is Alan Bennett's ''Bed Among the Lentils,'' taken from a series of six monologues he wrote for the BBC under the umbrella title of ''Talking Heads.'' The ''Lentils'' play is about a woman describing her very unfulfilling marriage to a much-beloved vicar of the Church of England.

That a person is made up of syllables and life is really a run-on sentence that only death can bring to an end. That nihilism is the only defensible philosophy for modern times. That May 1968 says it all. So beware. Don't be misled by that academic vernacular spoken on college campuses. When some stylish student reproves ''Oh, that went out a year ago,'' it is not Pierre Cardin she has on her mind. What she has on her mind is some form of French-spoken consciousness. An author: Sartre, Levi-Strauss, Piaget, Barthes, Lacan, Foucault, Derrida, Kristeva. A text : ''Being and Nothingness,'' ''The Order of Things,'' ''Of Grammatology.'' A movement: existentialism, structuralism, deconstructionism. A Gaulish mantra: semiology, post-modern feminism, intertextuality, the arbitrariness of the sign.

Having taken on Coke with the ''Pepsi Generation,'' John Sculley left his job as president of the soft-drink company to enforce some discipline at Apple Computer, where he eventually replaced the legendary Steven Jobs. This book ''is an intriguing account of one of the decade's most celebrated corporate crises,'' John Taylor said here in 1987. THE WESTERN LANDS, by William S. Burroughs. (Penguin, $7.95.) In the last book of a trilogy that began in 1981 with ''Cities of the Red Night,'' an old writer named William Seward Hall enlists the characters in his fiction to help him navigate through the netherworld to the Western Lands, the Egyptian name for Paradise. ''Mr. Burroughs has gone his own outrageous way and literary fashion has gone virtually in the opposite direction,'' Jonathan Baumbach said in The Book Review last year. ''The genius of this trilogy and of Mr. Burroughs's best work in general is that it sets itself virtually impossible tasks, springs from private obsession, makes little or no concession to the reader, offers us a vision that is viscerally unpleasant and often repellent, and still manages to work.'' DEBUTANTE, by Gioia Diliberto. (Pocket Books, $4.95.) With the help of the gossip columnists, a 17-year-old debutante named Brenda Frazier became such a sensation in 1938 that an orchid was named after her. ''There is something voyeuristic'' about this story of her eventual decline, John Gross said in The Times in 1987. But the author ''shows commendable skill in piecing together the whole sad story.'' THE MELTING POT: And Other Subversive Stories, by Lynne Sharon Schwartz. (Penguin, $7.95.) History shadows many of these stories, and in one of them memories of the Holocaust invade suburbia as a woman and her husband try to exterminate a colony of bees. ''Lynne Sharon Schwartz writes cleanly and with compassion,'' Perri Klass said here in 1987. PAST TENSE. Diaries: Volume One, by Jean Cocteau. Translated by Richard Howard. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $8.95.) In the first installment of the journal he kept during the last 13 years of his life, the film maker, artist and writer Jean Cocteau describes encounters with Colette, Matisse, Picasso, Jean Genet and Somerset Maugham. But it is most valuable, The Times's John Gross said in 1987, for its ''acute'' observations on Marcel Proust. THE BOOK AND THE BROTHERHOOD, by Iris Murdoch. (Penguin, $8.95.) Several lapsed revolutionaries from Oxford decide to bankroll their old friend David Crimond, who is writing a utopian tract. Last year our reviewer, Charles Newman, called this novel ''a triumphal celebration of literacy as a social bond.'' LEBANON'S PREDICAMENT, by Samir Khalaf. (Columbia University, $14.50.) A Lebanese sociologist tries to understand why his country fell apart. In 1987, Thomas L. Friedman said here that the book is ''suffused with the passion and insight of a true Beiruti trying to explain to himself and to the world why he can't go home anymore - why and how it happened that his house may still be standing, but the spirit that once inhabited his neighborhood . . . has scattered to the winds.'' TRICKS: An 87th Precinct Novel, by Ed McBain. (Avon, $3.95.) Trick-or-treaters are killing liquor store owners in the 39th installment of this series. In 1987 our reviewer, Newgate Callendar, compared this novel to ''expertly manufactured . . . literary furniture.'' But ''it's all done very professionally, and the writing races along.'' IN WHOSE INTEREST? International Banking and American Foreign Policy, by Benjamin J. Cohen. (Yale University, $12.95.) Bankers and diplomats have long enjoyed a symbiotic relationship, but what is good for international finance is not always good for the commonweal, Benjamin J. Cohen argues. Mr. Cohen has written ''a rich and engrossing analysis,'' Edward L. Morse said in The Book Review in 1986. LULLABY AND GOOD NIGHT, by Vincent T. Bugliosi with William Stadiem. (Signet/New American Library, $4.95.) Drawing on a sex scandal that made headlines in New York in the 1920's, two lawyers have written a novel about a woman who takes revenge on the political machine that framed her as a prostitute. Last year our reviewer, David Black, said the authors ''have attempted a moral complexity that is often missing in novels based on criminal cases. . . . It is an ambitious entertainment that strives to see a city - and an era - whole.'' CHAMBERET: Recollections From an Ordinary Childhood, by Claude Morhange-Begue. Translated by Austryn Wainhouse. (Marlboro, $9.) One day in 1944, when the author was 7 years old, the Nazis came and took her mother to Auschwitz. This memoir is ''heartbreaking,'' Marianne Veron said in The Book Review last year. Claude Morhange-Begue ''evokes the child's perception of the surface of life, the colors of the seasons and the loveliness of little things, but also her terror of the underlying drama that went unexplained.'' THE MURDER OF MIRANDA, by Margaret Millar. (International Polygonics, $4.95.) When a rich widow disappears along with the head lifeguard at a Palm Springs beach club, a young Hispanic lawyer named Tom Aragon is called to solve the case.

us,FICTION,"THE SANDS OF TIME. By Sidney Sheldon. (Morrow, $19.95.) Being Sidney Sheldon means never having to say you're writing. In his 10th book, ''The Sands of Time,'' Mr. Sheldon appears to have produced a literary version of painting by numbers. The story follows the fortunes of four nuns from an intensely austere Spanish convent as they wander through scenery that seems to have been imported from ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' - in the company of some fugitive Basque nationalists. All are hunted by a secret police chief, Colonel Acoca, who is described, seemingly on every third page, as ''a giant with a scarred face.'' Each of the nuns bears a Terrible Secret. One is a certifiable, jilted-in-love crazy person; another has been raped at 14 by her mother's Moorish lover; the third, Heaven help us, is a genuine Missing American Industrial Heiress; and the fourth is a distinctly earthy woman on the lam from the Italian police. The Basque leader is ''six feet tall, with a strong, intelligent face, a muscular body, and brooding dark eyes.'' The other characters are paper dolls. The style is reminiscent of a syrupy 1950's magazine, enlivened by ''the lubricious creak of bedsprings,'' to say nothing of a pastoral co-ed nude rubdown with dry leaves. This would all be good, picaresque fun if it weren't so exploitative of women in general and nuns in particular. Each wimple is wrapped around a featherhead, and the contemplative life of the convent is brutalized with graphic descriptions of self-flagellation. To make things worse, the wanderings around Spain read like a strange collaboration between Barbara Cartland and Ernest Hemingway.",1989-01-08T05:00:00+0000

Katherine Ellison is part of the Pulitzer Prize-winning San Jose Mercury News team that in 1985 traced the money of Ferdinand E. Marcos, then President of the Philippines, around the globe. In ''Imelda,'' she is on the track of bigger game - the soul of the country as well as of her subject, Imelda Marcos, the President's wife, his political equal and - but for the explosion of long-simmering revulsion with their staggering corruption - his potential successor. In a story that sometimes, unfortunately, reads like a cross between a script for ''Dallas'' and a psychohistory of a Pacific Rim Evita, Ms. Ellison takes us from Imelda Romualdez's adolescence on the island of Leyte and her days in postwar Manila through her transformation from a college beauty queen to full political partner in a ''conjugal dictatorship.'' In Ms. Ellison's view, Imelda Marcos's drive to be rich and worldly and her sensitivity to insult, real or imagined, mirrors a national nostalgia for colonial times and rage at the developed world that made the Philippines, for a decade at least, a sucker for the surreal romance she spun with her Cultural Center, her Western jet-set associates and her good works for the many poor, who were growing only poorer during the Marcos regime. The First Lady's rage at Corazon Aquino in the presidential campaign that led to the Marcoses' exile was as much personal as political, Ms. Ellison opines: in ''a matriarchal society overtly ruled by men,'' Mrs. Aquino, a member of ''the landed wealthy class that Imelda had always felt snubbed by . . . was winning power seemingly without effort.''",1989-01-08T05:00:00+0000

His idea was that such slices of popular culture - anything excluded by folk and American studies' scholars as too contemporary - would revolutionize education.

The Whitney retreats, asking Mr. Graves to produce a scaled-down version of his design.

Behemoths, butterflies and other creatures populate ''Fables for the Nuclear Age,'' canny political parables that take up where Aesop and Orwell left off. As animals scheme to shift the balance of power, they imitate Homo sapiens' diplomatic strategies more apt to escalate problems than to solve them. For example, an uneasy alliance of paranoid sharks and sanctimonious turtles collapses when shark spies expose promiscuity among the turtles (a species respected for its monogamy), paving the way for blackmail. The sharks' denial of spying is categorical, under the cynical reasoning that ''if you assert anything strongly enough, half the fish in the ocean will believe you.'' In another tale, rival monkeys negotiate limits to the stockpiling of coconut-cannonballs behind masks that express cliches -Astonishment-and-Indignation, More-in-Sorrow-Than-in-Anger and Limits-to-Our-Patience - and stall progress. The anthology ends in an eerie evolutionary tale. A dinosaur, taunted by propaganda about his tiny brain, asks God for his peers' respect for his mind, not just his tread. He is reincarnated as an atomic scientist - great mind, weak body - who makes the earth shudder. The author, Alan Neidle, earned his skepticism as an official with the State Department and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from 1957 to 1981, participating in international negotiations to curb nuclear weapons. All-too-human expressions - shrewd, gullible, stubborn - are deftly rendered in Jeff Leedy's sketches.",1989-01-08T05:00:00+0000

The night after her mother's funeral, Ellie, the heroine of Kristin McCloy's first novel, has a dream: she's riding in a car with her mother; neither is wearing her seat belt. They go faster and faster, until. . . . The very next night, Ellie meets Jesse, a long-haired, half-Cherokee biker who lives down the road. She asks him if she can have a ride on his motorcycle. When he asks her where she wants to go, she says, ''I don't care, I just want to go fast.'' She does. Every bit of common sense and friendly advice to the contrary, once Ellie's had a taste of what it's like to sleep with Jesse, that's it. She can't stay away, and she won't. She gets up in the middle of the night, goes to his door, begs to be let in. She lies to her father and to her boyfriend to guard this affair. In the end, she's like a desperate animal, stalking Jesse wherever he goes. Though Ms. McCloy can reach the level of poetry when she's writing of Jesse and Ellie's lovemaking, by the end of the novel the reader is left wondering about the cause of Ellie's uncontrollable desire. After 250 pages, you're certain it can't be Jesse. He's a petty criminal, selfish, barely literate and, ultimately, boring. Ms. McCloy makes an effort to explain things by introducing Ellie's discovery of her mother's infidelity, thus linking the destinies of the two women. But this seems contrived. Though there is fire in ''Velocity,'' clearly something is missing.",1989-01-08T05:00:00+0000

America's self-styled ''gray-flanneled kamikaze pilot,'' Stan Freberg wields the stiletto of satire against the smug and self-satisfied in popular culture and advertising. Mr. Freberg was the mad prophet of the airwaves, performing on radio, television and records his hilarious sendups of everything from ''Dragnet'' to the overcommercialization of Christmas. An independent taking on Madison Avenue, Mr. Freberg has always made his ad work intentionally provocative: the nine out of ten doctors who prefer Chun King chow mein (all but one of the doctors Chinese); a radio mini-musical for Butter-Nut coffee called ''Omaha!''; the campaign for Contadina tomato paste that asked, ''Who put eight great tomatoes in that little bitty can?'' Mr. Freberg's goal was radical when he began in the 1950's, but standard procedure today: advertising that ''was actually something you would wish to hear as opposed to turning it off.'' So it is surprising that someone as iconoclastic and unorthodox as Mr. Freberg would write such a conventional autobiography. ''It Only Hurts When I Laugh'' is straightforward, almost matter-of-fact, without his characteristic verve and bite. Too often, devices familiar to memoirs intrude: ''Little did I realize when I was growing up . . .,'' frequent references to famous folks who are fans. Take note: this is a first volume, covering Mr. Freberg's life and career until 1963; his further adventures are being saved for the next book. To his credit, Mr. Freberg acknowledges this in the preface, and it becomes a kind of running gag. Yet it might have been better to put all of his great material into one not so little bitty book than to ask the many Freberg aficionados to come back for seconds.",1989-01-08T05:00:00+0000

What was done between 1888 and 1900 by the young Pierre Bonnard, the young Edouard Vuillard and their colleagues in the brotherhood known as the Nabis is difficult to identify in any existing major museum. This is not because it is unknown, but because it ranged from large-scale easel paintings and murals to theater programs, theater decors long vanished, original prints, book jackets and book bindings, designs for fans and lamp shades, posters and caricatures, illustrated books, political and social polemics, and designs for stained glass and furniture. By calling themselves the Nabis, after the Hebrew word for prophet, the artists in question made a specific claim for themselves.

His agent, Reggie Ringuet, called the Mets to find out if they had any interest in him as a relief pitcher. Guidry spoke with Pat Gillick, general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, who apparently do have some interest in him as a reliever. ''Basically, I couldn't give him an answer at this point,'' said Joe McIlvaine, the Mets' vice president for baseball operations. ''The only interest we might have would be as a leadup man in the bullpen. He's a veteran pitcher who certainly knows how to pitch. The problem is would he get enough work to make it worthwhile. It's something we have to think about.'' Gillick did not make Guidry an offer but talked to him about his left shoulder and his thoughts on relieving. ''He really didn't comment one way or another,'' Gillick said. ''I think if he had his druthers, he'd rather be a starting pitcher.'' In having his agent call the Mets, though, Guidry was indicating a willingness to relieve because he knows the Mets don't need a starter. The left-hander, who is a free agent after having pitched for the Yankees for 13 years, likes the idea of staying in New York. No movement is expected in the next week in Guidry's effort to find a job because he and Ringuet are leaving tomorrow for a week of skiing in Colorado.",1989-01-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Wall St. to the Bronx: the Prosecutor's Unfinished Work,"The resignation of Rudolph W. Giuliani as the United States Attorney in Manhattan came as a number of major cases were unresolved or about to go to trial. These are among the defendants in the cases: Michael R. Milken Mr. Milken, the head of the high-yield, or junk bond, unit of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., has been at the center of a two-year investigation of Wall Street. Mr. Milken, who received a letter late last year from the United States Attorney indicating that he was the target of a criminal investigation, is expected to be charged along with other Drexel employees with many securities law violations. The GAF Corporation GAF and a top executive have been charged with criminal manipulation of stock in transactions involving its ownership of stock in the Union Carbide Corporation. Yesterday, a Federal judge declared a mistrial in the GAF case, charging ''prosecutorial misconduct.'' Paul Bilzerian Mr. Bilzerian, the Florida takeover specialist who is the chairman of the Singer Corporation, was charged last month with securities fraud. The case is scheduled to begin trial in May. Princeton/Newport Partners Five principals of Princeton/Newport, a New Jersey investment firm, were charged along with a former trader from Drexel with conspiring to create fraudulent tax losses through phony stock trades. The firm was not charged but it collapsed last month. Trial is to begin in June. Wigton, Tabor, Freeman The case against Richard Wigton and Timothy L. Tabor of Kidder, Peabody & Company, and Robert M. Freeman of Goldman, Sachs & Company is perhaps Mr. Giuliani's greatest defeat in the securities field. The three men were charged with a host of violations of the Federal securities laws. The Government was forced to drop all charges in 1987, however, after the three pleaded not guilty and prosecutors were unprepared to go forward with their cases. At the time, Mr. Giuliani vowed to bring broader indictments. He has not done so. Teamsters A lawsuit filed by Mr. Giuliani last summer said local executives of the union had Mafia ties. The trial is to begin Feb. 27. Wedtech One remaining trial, a civil suit on racketeering charges, is that of E. Robert Wallach, a friend and personal lawyer of Edwin Meese 3d, and two financial consultants, R. Kent London and W. Franklyn Chinn. The case has yet to go to trial. Robert Garcia Representative Robert Garcia, Democrat of the Bronx; his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, and a lawyer, Ralph Vallone Jr., were indicted on charges involving an alleged bribery-extortion scheme to obtain $185,000 from the Wedtech Corporation. The trial is scheduled for June 1. The Marcoses Former President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines and his wife, Imelda, were charged with racketeering involving allegations of fraud and embezzlement concerning Manhattan real-estate deals. Mrs. Marcos pleaded not guilty and is free on bail. Mr. Marcos, said to be too ill to travel, has not been arraigned yet. The Helmsleys Harry and Leona Helmsley and two officers of the Helmsley Corporation were indicted last April on 47 counts of conspiracy, extortion and tax evasion. Last month, a Federal appeals court denied for the second time a motion for dismissal. The trial is to begin April 24.",1989-01-11T05:00:00+0000

''The degree to which it is torn will have to be determined through diagnostic arthroscopic surgery.'' Reconstructive surgery on the knee could sideline Manning, the league's No. 1 draft choice, for the rest of the season and possibly longer. Manning was injured last Wednesday at Milwaukee. The 22-year-old forward said he ''heard a snap'' when he landed stiff-legged after making a layup. ''He will come back from this injury,'' Daly said last night. ''Realistically, the general rule is one year, but it's all generalized. Will he be 100 percent? That's open to question. Maybe he'll be at about 90 percent when he comes back, but 90 percent of Danny Manning is a lot better than 100 percent of most N.B.A. players. His age is greatly in his favor, but he still will lose some of the explosiveness in his right leg, some of his quickness and his cutting ability.'' (AP)",1989-01-12T05:00:00+0000

us,THE CZARS NEVER HAD IS SO GOOD,"In 1770, eight years after she became Empress of Russia, Catherine the Great established the workshops that would lavishly and permanently furnish the imperial palaces. Catherine's move gave birth to the Russian furniture industry - and the Russian style. Antoine Cheneviere, a Swiss-born London antiques dealer specializing in Russian furniture, has written RUSSIAN FURNITURE: The Golden Age 1780-1840 (Vendome Press, $65), the first major book outside of the Soviet Union on the style as it evolved over a 60-year period. Compared to the French, German and Italian furnishings that inspired the artisans who worked in St. Petersburg and Moscow, the Russian furniture they produced was frequently weightier, bolder in scale, more elaborately carved, richer in detail and more exquisitely crafted. Mr. Cheneviere explains how this style developed and discusses its designers and artisans, including the man who may have been Russia's Chippendale - Andrei Nikiforovich Voronikhin. Most of the illustrations are of major examples of the gilded, malachite-veneered, crystal, bronze, steel and carved wood chairs, tables, desks and chests in Russian museums. Many of these, especially the elegant steel furniture from the town of Tula and the tables, desks and chests veneered in malachite, jasper, porphyry and lazulite are breathtaking - a far cry from anything produced in Europe.",1989-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,PRESIDENTS: THE POWER AND THE MEDIOCRITY,"James Bryce and Harold Laski, household names in another era - at least in certain intellectual circles - appear to have receded into that decent obscurity reserved for those whose major works, still in print, are rarely read. In a world of thermonuclear weapons and booming new industries, of innovative and complex communications systems and news media held to be immensely influential, with vastly expanded public bureaucracies expending money in amounts once never conceived of, books published in 1888 and 1940, purporting to treat what is putatively the most powerful position in the world, the American Presidency, can only be thought old-fashioned. It is a curious fact, however, that those who continue to write (or think) about the office - and their number is legion, particularly in the United States - do so generally in the tradition of either Bryce or Laski, whether they know it or not. What is even more curious, perhaps, is that while both have become part of our political discourse, the substantial differences between them are largely ignored.

But I was wrong to assume that he would rhapsodize about ''the classics'' or the Royal Shakespeare Company or the National Theater. ''I'm beginning to worry that there can be too much Shakespeare,'' he said, referring to the five not altogether distinguished productions of ''The Tempest'' he'd already seen this year. ''What I'll really miss most,'' he said, ''is Vanessa Redgrave. I've seen her give a half-dozen performances that I'll never forget.'' Miss Redgrave is giving one of those performances right now in a West End revival of Tennessee Williams's ''Orpheus Descending.'' Will homebound Americans ever see it? One can hardly assume so; Miss Redgrave, whose vocal support for the Palestine Liberation Organization is repugnant to many, has been conspicuously absent from our stages since the Boston Symphony Orchestra canceled her engagement as a narrator for Stravinsky's ''Oedipus Rex'' in 1982.

True, he does have an M.B.A., an upscale wife and a nice house in the suburbs, but he also has a very heavy enemy in Tony Allio, leader of the Atlantic City mob, who has hated him since they were in high school together in south Philadelphia. Frank, it seems, had humiliated Tony way back then, and nobody - repeat, nobody - humiliates this guy and gets away with it. Tony, deciding it is finally payback time, sets in motion a scheme to bring Frank to his knees by taking advantage of his wife's addiction to gambling. Tony's goons get her deep into debt, drug her, then kidnap the poor woman and hide her away in a pimp's apartment. Why kidnap her if they already have enough of her markers to break Frank's will, force him to steal money from his own bank and destroy his life? For the same reason they kill Frank's father, a tough but honest cop, and beat to death an old woman who just happens to get in their way: to make them despicable low-lifes who deserve what they get. And they get a lot before Frank finally crushes them into smears of grease. How is an M.B.A. banker able to take on such evil thugs? Hey, he knows karate. Plus he's one of those violence-haunted veterans of Vietnam, a former Green Beret who can . . . well, you know what they can do.

''Everyone now is doing a Colonial base with more contemporary flairs,'' he said.

That doubles Vail's skiable terrain to 3,787 acres served by lifts. The spread is six times the size of Aspen Mountain, its traditional rival; more extensive than Colorado's Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, Arapahoe Basin and Keystone combined.

An architect whose initial fame came from his attempts to use glass to make patterned and colorful facades (Mr. Pelli did Museum Tower in New York and Four Leaf Towers in Houston, among others), his quest clearly has been to find a way to make buildings that are richer than the austere Mies van der Rohe knockoffs of the 1960's and 1970's, yet avoid the literal cribbing from history and the somewhat precious use of details that are so often part of post-Modernism.

Worldwide corporate demand for dollars was also said to be heavy.

us,NONFICTION,"A SOVIET ODYSSEY. By Suzanne Rosenberg. (Oxford University, $19.95.) As a child in the Ukraine, Suzanne Rosenberg would be awakened by the gunfire of the Russian civil war. But she spent her formative teens in Montreal, where she was taken by her mother at the urging of their Canadian relatives. Consequently, when mother and daughter went back to the Soviet Union in 1931 to be at the forefront, as they saw it, of the struggle for a new world, she perceived the events that followed through an unusual double vision - as a Russian uplifted by the ideals of the Revolution and as a product of a Canadian education, with its bedrock of liberal beliefs. The result in ''A Soviet Odyssey'' is an extraordinary personal memoir of the Stalin years. What comes through in this harrowing account - Ms. Rosenberg, her mother and her stepfather were all sent to prison camps on trumped-up charges, and only she survived, to find her way back to Canada - is the sheer madness of the terror that Stalin loosed upon the land. It was as if one man's paranoia at the center of power brought out the sickies everywhere, and drove millions - needlessly, mindlessly, purposelessly - to their deaths.",1989-01-15T05:00:00+0000

Dr. Ward asks her to stick out her tongue; he grasps it with a piece of cotton gauze. Carefully, he guides a curved metal syringe down her throat, to just above her vocal cords. Watching with a mirror and a light strapped to his head, he places drops of the chemical epinephrine, the human hormone that charges up the body in the grip of trauma or excitement or fear, onto her inflamed, irritated vocal cords.

Partially offsetting the impact of these interest payments was the placement in non-accrual status, beginning in the third quarter of 1988, of certain loans to borrowers in Argentina, which reduced latest quarter earnings by $13 million after taxes and $31 million after taxes for the year.

Klimova and Ponomarenko have never won a major event, having been runners-up in eight previous world, Olympic and European championship appearances. But the Soviet pair got off to a perfect start in their quest for gold as they led a Soviet sweep of the first three placings in the compulsories. Maya Usova and Aleksandr Zhulin were in second place with Natalya Annenko and Genrikh Sretenski third. Klara Engi and Attila Toth of Hungary placed fourth, ahead of the leading Western pair, Sharon Jones and Paul Ashkam of Britain. With the compulsories counting for only 20 percent of the total mark, Klimova and Ponomarenko still had a long way to go. The original set pattern takes place tomorrow and the free dance Friday.(AP) SKIING Girardelli Wins Giant Slalom: Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg posted the best times in both heats to win a giant slalom race in Adelboden, Switzerland, and widen his overall lead in the World Cup standing.

The big surprise, however, was the second-place finish for 22-year-old Ole Christian Furuseth of Norway, who joined the circuit only last season. He was timed in 2:32.49. Alberto Tomba of Italy was third. Girardelli raised his overall World Cup point total this season to 219, with Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland trailing him at 183. Tomba, who does not compete in downhill races, is third with 113 points.(AP) COLLEGE BASKETBALL/WOMEN Louisiana Tech 88, Austin 54: Venus Lacy scored a career-high 36 points and grabbed 14 rebounds to lead Louisiana Tech, ranked No. 3, past 17th-ranked Stephen F.

''If we sign a one-year deal, that's definitely an option in the future,'' he said. Unable to come to terms on a multiyear pact, Hershiser, who made $1.1 million last season, filed for salary arbitration and is to exchange salary figures with the Dodgers today. The Dodgers have not been commenting publicly on the talks, but, as Hershiser pointed out, the team has not hesitated to lose such popular stars as Steve Garvey and Steve Sax rather than meet their salary demands.

The decision breaks down part of the wall that has separated banking and the securities business since 1933 - the Glass-Steagall Act. [ Page A1. ] The nation's trade deficit widened substantially in November, to $12.5 billion, as exports declined and imports surged to the second-highest level on record, the Commerce Department reported. Administration officials and private economists called the increase a serious disappointment. [ A1. ] Japan reported that its trade surplus rose in December to $9.65 billion, a record. [ D26. ] U.S. industry operated at its highest rate in nine years last month, the Federal Reserve reported, but analysts said the modest growth should allay fears that inflation is rising. [ D26. ] COMPANIES Kidder, Peabody will shortly announce a major reorganization that includes the appointment of a new chief executive, Wall Street analysts and executives said. Speculation on a new chief centered on a 41-year-old executive vice president of G.E. Capital. [ D1. ] The S.E.C. and Drexel Burnham Lambert are at an impasse over how to settle the charges of securities law violations against the firm, a person directly involved in the case said. The stumbling block is over the issue of moving its junk bond unit. [ D1. ] I.B.M. reported that its fourth-quarter net income rose 12.4 percent from a year earlier, below some analysts' expectations.

Baker 3d at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as recorded by the Federal News Service: Latin American Policy RICHARD G. LUGAR. How do you intend to take charge in the Latin American situation, or how are you going to manage, really, in the next two or three weeks, in which a good bit may happen? A. Well, I think, until Friday, Senator Lugar, the problem will continue to be managed by the outgoing Administration. If I am confirmed by this committee and by the Senate, I will, of course, be able to address - to give it some attention as of the date of that confirmation by the full Senate. There are people who are in the Department who are not - who will remain in the Department and who have been dealing with these problems for a considerable period of time and will be available to continue to deal with them during that transition period of whatever it is, five or six days. I don't know, under our system, what I can do in that period, if that's the gist of your question. Q. I'm afraid that things are drifting, and I don't really see, in the Department right now, the ability to handle any of this. And I'm -and this must be of some disturbance to your - A. Well, as you know, Senator, it is disturbing to me. As you know from my private visits with you and the other members of the committee, I don't see an issue coming at us any quicker than this one. I think it's going to be right on our doorstep when we take office. That's what I have said in my private visits with you, and that's why I think it's so extraordinarily important that we get together, as a Legislative and Executive Branch, on what our policy ought to be down there - get a unified policy and start implementing it, because these problems are not going to go away without it, and they're going to multiply. Middle East Peace NANCY LANDON KASSEBAUM. I just got back from a trip to the Middle East. . . . As often as I heard in the countries we visited that their support for an international peace conference and some type of comprehensive solution, I also was struck with really how far apart all the major players on what they really expect from the peace conference. . . . Are we not raising expectations too high about an event that may be just then argued as far as the shape of the table? And is it better to be seeking, perhaps, some smaller steps that could lend support, then, for the grander agenda? A. . . . So I think that we should pursue whatever avenues there are that could help us find a way to peace in the Middle East, as I just indicated to Senator Simon, but I think we ought to all be realistic about the prospects for achieving a breakthrough. I don't, you know, there is no more intractable problem facing us; there has been no more intractable foreign policy facing us for a long time. That doesn't mean that we - the difficulty of the task does not - should not deter us from making the effort. Human Rights Conference Q. Going on to another question, were you involved in the recent decision that we go along with a human rights in Moscow in 1991? And what's your opinion of this development? A. Well, contrary to published press reports, Senator Kassebaum, I was not involved in the decision. . . . I've had some reservations in watching the issue develop, even during the campaign, about the wisdom of holding a human-rights conference in Moscow, but having said that, I have to say to you that I am impressed by the changes which are taking place in the Soviet Union and what Secretary Shultz and the President have achieved there.",1989-01-19T05:00:00+0000

Peter Svoboda added an empty-netter as the Canadiens stretched their unbeaten streak at home to 17 games. Montreal's last loss at the Forum was to Pittsburgh on Oct. 29. Joel Quenneville gave the Whalers the lead just 83 seconds into the game, but McPhee tied it with his 16th goal at 4:22 of the third period by completing a two-on-one play with Claude Lemieux. Carbonneau notched the winner at 11:00, getting away a soft shot that eluded the goaltender, Peter Sidorkiewicz.(AP) Oilers 9, Jets 4:Mark Messier had two goals and two assists as the Oilers snapped a four-game winless streak.

Caribe Diner's Journal (March 14, 1986), 117 Perry Street (255-9191) - A jungle of palms thrives at Caribe, an informal Greenwich Village restaurant with flamingo-pink walls and wicker furniture. Accompanied by reggae, the food is a mix of specialties from several Caribbean islands and includesthe Jamaican national dish, ackee and salt fish. On the menu are black bean soup, jerked chicken (chicken baked with West Indian spices), braised oxtail that comes with fried plantain and rice and beans, and spiced and baked whole red snapper.

This seafood house has a Thai chef, accounting for the distinctive and spicy preparations. Recommended starters include the conch chowder, and crayfish and rock shrimp in garlic and lemon. Cayenne-spiked crab cakes are served with a cilantro sauce. Other entrees are Key West grouper, tilefish with fresh basil, and grilled mahi-mahi with stir-fried vegetables.

Indochine ** (Nov. 25, 1988), 430 Lafayette Street (505-5111) - This still-trendy, still-noisy downtown restaurant serves a mix of Vietnamese and Cambodian cuisines. Southeast Asia of an earlier age is evoked by the palm fronds and banana leaves hand painted on white walls. The kitchen is skilled in deep-frying, as demonstrated by Vietnamese spring rolls. Other good dishes for starters or main courses are the steamed shrimp salad with mint and lemongrass; fish steamed in banana leaf, and spicy beef salad with lemongrass and shallots.

Main-course portions are large and include peppery fried chicken, roast chicken with waffles, and Carolina shrimp creole. Appetizers are $5.75 to $6.75, entrees $15.75 to $21.75.

Mr. Rich sold oil that was in effect under price controls at free-market prices and shifted millions of dollars in illegal profits overseas. In 1983 Mr. Rich, who had fled to Switzerland, was charged with evading $48 million in income taxes. A year later two companies he controls pleaded guilty to criminal tax charges and agreed to pay $150 million to the Government. While the companies are free to do business in the United States, Mr. Rich and his partner, Pincus Green, face arrest on tax charges if they return. Efforts to extradite Mr. Rich have been unsuccessful. The Silver Crisis: In 1979 two of the Hunt brothers - Nelson Bunker and William Herbert - set out to control the world silver market.The buying spree pushed prices up and brought much old silver into the market. Prices collapsed in late March 1980. The collapse, which shook the foundations of a number of major financial institutions, cost the Hunts well over $1 billion. Federal charges of manipulation against the Hunts , in addition to damage claims, are outstanding. The Con Man's Game: James A. Carr, and the firm he headed, Lloyd, Carr & Company, sold fraudulent London commodity options to investors in the United States in 1977.Federal investigators discovered that Mr. Carr was Alan Abrahams, an escaped felon. As Mr. Carr, Mr. Abrahams bilked customers of $28 million.

Panic hit when investors learned there was nothing to support the loans. Sixteen companies and two brokerage houses were forced into bankruptcy.Mr. DeAngelis spent seven years in prison and was released in 1972.

The cost of a queen-size comforter can range from $89 to $900, depending on the quality of the down, the ratio of down to feathers, the quality of the fabric shell and the intricacy of the stitching. Here are the main indicators of quality; all should be listed on the literature provided with the comforter, or available on request. Filling Power: Reflects the contents' ability to provide warmth and spring back when compressed. Manufacturers consider 500 the minimum and 700 extremely high quality. Weight: Minimum weights suggested by manufacturers are 20 ounces for a twin size; 24 ounces, full; 29 ounces, queen, and 34 ounces, king. Blend: The higher the percentage of down, the warmer the comforter. If the down has been blended, the manufacturer must indicate the percentage and type of feathers and down. Thread Count And Stitching: The higher the thread count of the fabric shell, the less down will escape; avoid shells with a count of less than 220. Baffled stitching, which uses an interior fabric wall, is the most effective and costly.

No American response was forthcoming. Page 5 Parts of a Soviet hero's memoirs that criticize Stalin's World War II leadership and blame him for the deaths of Soviet citizens were made public for the first time. The war hero is the late Marshal Georgi Zhukov. 3 Andrei Sakharov was nominated for a seat in the new national Congress of Deputies, but after he was spurned by the scientific establishment. His platform: human rights, disarmament and environmental protection. 3 Soviet bombing of Afghan guerrillas has taken a new turn with Soviet forces using a new, heavier bomb for the first time in the Afghan war, Washington officials say. 3 Lech Walesa said he is ready to talk with Poland's leaders about restoring the legal status of the outlawed union. It was the first sign that he accepts a Communist Party resolution passed Wednesday. 3 Israel closed schools in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying gatherings of students had contributed to a rise in demonstrations. And the Defense Minister unvieled his plan to end the uprising. 4 Yasir Arafat disputed a U.S. charge that he had threatened Arabs who tried to halt the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank. Other senior P.L.O. officials also countered the charge. 4 U.S. Jewish groups say they will urge Bush to deny Arafat a visa 4 Lima Journal: starting over, the Ex-Peruvian way 4 South India election will test political strength of Gandhi 5 Burma refuses to say when it will hold elections 28 National 6-12 George Bush became 41st President of the United States. He promised an end to divisiveness between the White House and Congress and vowed a new effort to heal social wounds. 1 World leaders congratulate Bush, bid Reagan farewell 9 News analysis: Mr. Bush called for subtle yet significant corrections in the nation's course: away from bickering between the White House and Congress, insensitivity to the poor and greed. 1 Peggy Noonan: the writer behind the speech 10 The inauguration marked a passage Mr. Bush has made in the last ten weeks with an ease that has amazed all but those closest to him: from faithful and sometimes fumbling lieutenant to self-assured leader. 1 The Reagans left the Bushes notes as they finished packing, with Ronald Reagan wistful, Nancy Reagan worried. At the ceremonies, Vice President Quayle was animated, President Bush excited. 1 ''Carry on,'' Ronald Reagan said in Washington when he was asked for final thoughts. Then he left on the first leg of his trip to California. 7 Bittersweet day in the White House as Reagan staff departs 7 The inaugural balls are the highpoint to the week's festivities, but, generally, these affairs - big, dense and anonymous - are not the places to seek out the rich or the powerful. 8 Commodity traders in Chicago are being pressed by fraud investigators to name others who may have engaged in illegal activiites, lawyers and others said. 1 Chicago's commodity exchanges begin fruad inquiries 39 Workers at a Colorado weapon plant, where plutonium is formed into triggers for nuclear warheads, took the first steps to reopen a processing building shut down since October for emergency repairs. 11 A Boeing 737 jet engine broke away during takeoff from Chicago's O'Hare Airport, but the jet returned safely to the runway, scattering debris that delayed other flights at the nation's busiest airport. 11 Whether to build a domed stadium in San Antonio is a question on the city's ballot today that has become much more: a debate over the city's future course and over its troubled Mayor's legacy. 11 A former head of the Ku Klux Klan is running in a special Louisiana primary election held today to fill a seat in the state House of Representatives. Though he trails in the polls, some say he may score an upset. 11 A large trade deficit in November has signaled that the downward course achieved last year after a long and agonizing battle may be ending. 37 Exxon's Canadian subsidiary, Imperial Oil Ltd., agreed to pay Texaco Inc. $3.24 billion for its 78 percent interest in Texaco Canada, Canada's fourth-largest oil and gas enterprise. 37 Regional 29-33 A boy accused of selling crack from a bike will remain in police custody, a Suffolk County judge ordered after finding reasonable likelihood that a crime had been committed. 1 News analysis: Child protection by New York City became a target for criticism again for the city's handling of a Bronx family whose 10 month-old boy suffocated last week. 29 Two policemen were shot, one critically, as a murder suspect they had gone to arrest burst through the door of a Brooklyn apartment and, the police said, opened fire with a .25-caliber automatic gun. 29 Joel Steinberg was portrayed by prosecutors as a repulsive killer of Lisa Steinberg and an evasive defendant who tried to conceal murder with lies and deceit and then, failing that, blamed Hedda Nussbaum. 29 Man in the news: Otto Obermaier, who was recommended for United States Attorney in Manhattan, is known by his friends as a person of diverse experience and fierce independence. 31 State mental-health officials have ordered management changes at a children's psychiatric center where a state inquiry uncovered a patients' ''sex club'' and four instances of sex between staff members and patients. 30 A bite to eat, a gunshot, and a young woman's life is wasted 29 Women says she will stay put, park or no 30 Neediest Cases 33",1989-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"CENTURIES OF FEMALE DAYS: Englishwomen's Private Diaries. By Harriet Blodgett. (Rutgers University, $29.95.) On Oct. 23, 1848, Caroline Fox, the 29-year-old daughter of the eminent English scientist Robert Were Fox, noted succinctly in her diary, ''A wet day and all its luxuries.'' The following day she recorded as, ''A fine day and all its liabilities.'' Thus were one woman's days characterized for posterity. Women's diaries, writes Harriet Blodgett in ''Centuries of Female Days,'' ''provide invaluable testimonials to individual female lives and reveal patterns of female existence.'' They also ''constitute a literary tradition of female serial writing.'' Quoting from the diaries of 69 English or Welsh women whose private thoughts were written between 1599 and 1939, Ms. Blodgett offers illuminating examples of her subjects ''in process of being in a particular world.'' Some of these diarists were obscure housewives, while others were mothers, wives or daughters of men well known to history. Many were accomplished in their own right, among them Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Beatrix Potter, Katherine Mansfield, Beatrice Webb and Virginia Woolf. Ironically, all the diaries quoted in this volume were intended as private and personal (this was one of the author's criteria for inclusion in her study), yet all have been published in some form (another of the author's requirements). There is is a tantalizing clamor of voices, unfortunately dominated by Ms. Blodgett's. Readers will be left wishing that this book heralded a plan by some publisher to issue obscure diaries, which, read in sustained form, are far more intriguing than the muted tidbits scattered in this compendium.",1989-01-22T05:00:00+0000

us,FROM ALPHA TO OMEGA,"CIVILIZATION OF THE ANCIENT MEDITERRANEAN: Greece and Rome. Edited by Michael Grant and Rachel Kitzinger. (Scribners, $225.) That price is not a typographical error. What you get here is 1,980 double-column pages in three volumes containing 97 chapters by 88 authorities on everything from farming and cooking to taxes, warfare and divinities in Greece and Rome. Michael Grant, who in a long life of scholarship has written many volumes on the ancient world, and Rachel Kitzinger, who teaches classics at Vassar College, have assembled the articles in groups that generally proceed from geography and history to government, from individual and family life to social life and ideas. But it is obvious they have not supplied their writers with outlines; there are some delightful departures and surprises tucked away in these pages, and it is not hard to detect not only different attitudes, but disagreements among the contributors. All the articles are written for the general reader, but some of the writers are much sprightlier than others. On the whole the essays on technical subjects like farming, building, engineering and mining are more energetic and revealing than those on government, society and intellectual and spiritual life, although the one on Greek philosophy and another on divinities in general are more elegant and penetrating than one expects in a small encyclopedia. The bibliographies following each chapter are current and comprehensive, the photographs and illustrations are as instructive as they are delightful and the maps are easy to read (however, it is difficult to guess why the editors chose to illustrate the provinces of the Roman Empire at the end of the reign of Augustus rather than a century later when it had reached its greatest extent).",1989-01-22T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"SAFE PASSAGE. By Ellyn Bache. (Crown, $16.95.) Ellyn Bache's first novel begins with a mother's premonition of disaster: ''At four-thirty on Sunday morning Mag came up from sleep with her heart thumping and sweat pouring from her.'' Mag Singer's premonition rapidly proves true as she and her husband, Patrick, learn from an early-morning newscast that the Beirut airport, where one of their seven sons is stationed as a marine, has been destroyed by Lebanese terrorists. All communication with the base has been cut off and they have no way of finding out if he is dead or alive. As the news spreads over the next three days, the Singers gather to hold what they all fear is a death watch, leaping when the telephone rings and hoping for the young man's safe return. Mag buries herself in music, racked with guilt over earlier resentments (''I never wanted children. . . . This is the punishment'') as Patrick goes intermittently blind from a mysterious malady no one has been able to treat; meanwhile, their other sons nervously express their own fear through imagined paralysis and bargain-filled prayers. The problem with ''Safe Passage'' is that Ms. Bache has chosen an event as genuine as a newspaper story and imbued it with an ultimately belittling inauthenticity. The family members are all light sketches with unconvincing emotional lives. And the events that are supposed to be compelling - Patrick's inexplicable blindness, Mag's climactic battle with a neighborhood foe - seem strenuous attempts to rouse emotion where none is really felt. Mag, in particular, is a character who is clearly intended to embody the contradictions of motherhood, and as such is more of an idea than a person. Basing a novel on actual headlines can be a dangerous enterprise. Unfortunately, Ms. Bache has not avoided its pitfalls.",1989-01-22T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"JULIA PARADISE, by Rod Jones. (King Penguin, $6.95.) A Shanghai psychoanalyst cures a missionary's wife of tormenting fantasies by making love to her while she practices free association; in return, she helps him overcome a debilitating case of ennui. In 1987, our reviewer, Wray Herbert, said this ''haunting first novel [ is ] a remarkable accomplishment.'' THE RISE AND FALL OF THE GREAT POWERS: Economic Change and Military Conflict From 1500 to 2000, by Paul Kennedy. (Vintage, $12.95.) Time and again, a Yale historian argues, mighty empires have hastened their own demise by spending too much money on the military. ''In a work of almost Toynbeean sweep he describes a pattern of past development that is not only directly relevant to our times but is clearly intended to be read by policy makers, particularly American policy makers,'' Michael Howard said in The Book Review last year. ''There are lessons to be learned from the past at a profounder level than those of Munich or Sarajevo, and the American leadership would do well to heed them.'' BROKEN GROUND, by John Keeble. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) An engineer from Portland is recruited by a sinister multinational corporation to help build a prison in the Oregon desert. ''Skillfully blending elements from regional writing, adventure thrillers and magical realism, Mr. Keeble weaves a tale made up of many finely observed scenes,'' Tom Nolan said here last year. FIGHTING FAITHS: The Abrams Case, the Supreme Court, and Free Speech, by Richard Polenberg. (Penguin, $9.95.) In 1919 the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of four Russian anarchists charged with sedition for advocating a munitions workers strike. But in the long run, the dissenting opinion by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. has been the most influential aspect of the case, helping establish that the First Amendment protects all political speech that does not pose a ''clear and present danger'' to the country. Last year, our reviewer, Carol E. Rinzler, called this ''a lively [ and ] meticulous history.'' In UNTENDED GATES: The Mismanaged Press (Columbia University, $14.50), Norman E. Isaacs argues that newspaper editors often abuse their constitutional privilege, arrogantly dismissing complaining readers as kooks. The author, who was chairman of an ill-fated group of journalistic ombudsmen called the National News Council, ''makes a number of telling points,'' Kathleen J. Turner said here in 1986. THE SILVER DESOTO, by Patty Lou Floyd. (Washington Square/Pocket, $5.95.) These short stories about growing up in the days of the Oklahoma dust bowl are ''strong and memorable,'' Jill McCorkle said here in 1988. ''Patty Lou Floyd creates an unforgettable journey into adulthood.'' TIME AND THE ART OF LIVING, by Robert Grudin. (Ticknor & Fields, $8.95.) In a melancholic series of vignettes and philosophical observations, a Shakespeare scholar reflects on life, death and the nature of time. In 1983, one commentator said the book ''could be enormously valuable to anyone trying to restructure a life.'' THE STRANGE NATION OF RAFAEL MENDES, by Moacyr Scliar. Translated by Eloah F. Giacomelli. (Ballantine, $4.95.) A Brazilian financier inherits two notebooks that trace his ancestry to the prophet Jonah, the philosopher Maimonides and the ancient cult of the Essenes. Last year, our reviewer, Herbert Gold, said this ''contemporary story of financial and sexual skulduggery . . . sings with a fado wail,'' a kind of Portugese folk song. THE RECORDING ANGEL: The Experience of Music from Aristotle to Zappa, by Evan Eisenberg. (Penguin, $7.95.) By reshaping the way musicians think of their craft, the invention of the phonograph led to a new art form, Evan Eisenberg writes. This ''seems to be the first full-length book on the implications and effects of recording on music,'' Jon Pareles said in The Times in 1987. ''It's bursting with ideas, taking up topics from the ties between ritual and music to the compression that 78-rpm records brought to the classic blues.'' HER OWN TERMS, by Judith Grossman. (Ivy, $3.95) Having escaped dreary South London for the literary life in Oxford, Irene Tanner can hardly believe that she still must overcome the obstacle of being a woman. This novel ''replicates for the reader the confusion, the sense of dislocation from self, the inability to recognize what is demeaning, self-denying, that many women experienced who grew up and were educated in the 50's and early 60's,'' Sue Miller said in The Book Review in 1988. ''Its achievement is that it does this without cant, without dogma, without a grain of self-pity.'' EUROPE: A Tapestry of Nations, by Flora Lewis. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $10.95.) Drawing on years of experience as a foreign correspondent, a New York Times columnist reflects on the personalities of the countries of Europe. Writing in The Times in 1987, Anthony Sampson said that ''for many American visitors to Europe, [ the book ] will provide an invaluable introductory guide, to remind them just how different these countries are from each other and from America, and how complex are their varied histories and formations.'' A CUP OF DEATH, by Gene Thompson. (Ballantine, $3.50.) After a classics professor is murdered, a piece of missing jewelry points to a conspiracy that seems to have roots in ancient Greece. ''It's a very complicated plot, and Mr. Thompson has many strands to weave together,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year. He does so ''neatly and artistically.''",1989-01-22T05:00:00+0000

While the question ''Who is a Jew?'' has been raging in Israel, the answer in the United States is simple enough. As a leader of the Jewish community of Waco, Tex., says: ''If somebody says he's Jewish, that's good enough.'' In ''Members of the Tribe,'' a richly detailed, perceptive and often funny book of vignettes gathered during a six-month tour of 30 states, Ze'ev Chafets - an Israeli writer who was raised in Pontiac, Mich. - recounts the many ways Americans define their Jewishness. There are, for example, the houses of worship, like the All People's Synagogue in Miami, where a renegade rabbi converts people to Judaism in a one-day crash course; the black synagogue in New York, where the rabbi prays for ''Israel, Africa and America;'' and the Gay Synagogue in San Francisco, where every one is invited to the ''lesbian Havdalah [ prayer ] hot tub'' service to mark the end of the Sabbath. For some Jews, all this worship is too much and so they have found a new religious shrine - the health club at the Jewish community center where, Mr. Chafets tells us, ''cigarettes have replaced pork as the forbidden substance of choice.''",1989-01-22T05:00:00+0000

Bill Walsh, the 49ers' coach, said it would take two men to block him. ''Krumrie is the foundation of our defense,'' said Dick LeBeau, the Bengals' defensive coordinator. Cross is a wise old head with bad knees and reduced quickness. He is in his 13th pro season and says it will be his last. Michael Carter, 49ers' nose tackle, vs. Bruce Kozerski, Bengals' center: Though Carter is explosive and quick, he sometimes tries so hard to make plays that he overruns them. ''If we're going to run the ball effectively,'' said Kozerski, ''we've got to stay on him, but we're not going to be driving him back 10 yards because no one does it.'' Carter responded, ''Once Kozerski gets the edge on you, he can cut you off the play, but as long as I stay low I'll be fine.'' Jerry Rice, 49ers' wide receiver, vs. Eric Thomas and Lewis Billups, Bengals' cornerbacks: In the regular season, Rice averaged 20.4 yards a catch, and in two playoff games he has caught five touchdown passes, including three against the Bears in the N.F.C. championship game. Sprained ankle or not, he is still the 49ers' game-breaker, and Thomas said he had to be controlled at the line of scrimmage. LeBeau said he would not flop cornerbacks, so Thomas and Billups will share the coverage. Roger Craig, 49ers' running back, vs. Bengals' front seven: This season's lighter Craig is the premier all-round running back in the league, with 1,502 yards rushing and 534 yards in receptions. If he gains 100 yards rushing or near that in receptions the Bengals will be in trouble. ''If he finds the seam and breaks into the secondary,'' said LeBeau, ''he's very difficult to bring down one on one. And you can't give him the wide seam.'' Bill Walsh, 49ers' coach, vs. Sam Wyche, Bengals' coach: These are two old friends who worked together as quarterback coach and quarterback and later as coach and assistant coach. They are smart and innovative and not afraid to be different. Walsh scripts his first 25 plays to avoid stereotyped play calling and to allow his players to prepare better. Wyche often uses no huddle or a quick huddle to create chaos and uncertainty in the opposing defense.",1989-01-22T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THE CARPATHIANS. By Janet Frame. (Braziller, $17.50.) Janet Frame's 11th novel, her first in nine years, is an unconventional fantasy. Told for the most part from the viewpoint of a wealthy, compulsive globe-trotter, a middle-aged New Yorker named Mattina Brecon, it describes her two-month stay in the fictional New Zealand town of Puamahara. The book takes as its starting point the discovery of a strange celestial phenomenon: a galaxy that, paradoxically, appears at the same time ''both relatively close and seven billion light years away'' as a result of light's passage through intervening gravitational forces. ''The Carpathians'' examines what might happen if this so-called Gravity Star phenomenon suddenly affected our own world - starting in the street in Puamahara where Mattina takes up residence - and ''destroyed the concept of nearness and distance as opposites.'' Fascinating, frustrating, obscure, complex, with a deceptively haphazard plot and confoundingly shifting points of view, ''The Carpathians'' is not a fast, entertaining read. But it is a small masterpiece of literary craftsmanship, the work of an original thinker with a poet's ear for the sound and cadence of language. The catastrophic effects of the Gravity Star paradox on one New Zealand neighborhood prefigure Ms. Frame's vision of the worldwide destruction ''of the old ways when distance is near and the eastern mountains of Puamahara could be the Carpathians; and weight becomes lightness; and the trees . . . have their roots in the sky.'' In just under 200 pages, Ms. Frame conveys volumes: her book yields new facets of meaning with each rereading.",1989-01-22T05:00:00+0000

us,The Coaches Speak Out,"Sam Wyche On meeting Bill Walsh for the first time: ''I was a Cincinnati Bengals rookie. I don't remember the first 'Hello' or 'How do you do?' I was a rookie walk-on trying to find out where Cincinnati was.'' On what he has learned from Walsh about being a head coach: ''He's an integral part of my style. You'll see some of the same mannerisms. Sometimes, he flips his hand and he puts his hand to his teeth. I'll do that. I think I'm trying to figure out how he wins.'' On the Bengals' role as underdogs: ''We plan to show up for all four quarters. Our guys took a vote.'' On his love of gimmick plays: ''We have 12 gimmicks in this game, but I don't know how many we're going to use. We try to go into a game with 10 or 12. We think of them not as gimmicks, but as sound plays.'' On reports that he will quit his job because of the pressure: ''Some days, I say I'm not too sure this job is worth what it puts you through. A lot of people feel that way about their jobs. I'm not leaning toward getting out of football or leaving the Bengals.'' On his memories of Super Bowl XVI, when he was the 49ers' quarterback coach: ''I remember the snow and the ice driving to the Silverdome. I was sitting on the second bus with Bill Walsh, and the road was blocked. He got up and said: 'Don't worry, men. The score is only 3-0 and we're hanging in.' That got a big laugh and helped relax the players.'' On his reputation as a players' coach: ''When I started, I was older than some players, and I played the game. Well, I was on rosters for nine years. I showered with a lot of the fellows.'' Bill Walsh On his feelings about Wyche, who played and coached under him: ''It's sort of a love-hate thing. I care so much about him, what he's done and all his accomplishments. But you have to deal with them. On one hand, it's great to see him. On the other hand, I'd prefer to see someone else.'' On the time when he was the Bengals' quarterback coach and Wyche was a rookie free agent: ''We liked him. He was big and strong. We made a quarterback out of him. I coached him four years and developed him to the upper reaches of mediocrity.'' On whether Walsh, the teacher, can beat Wyche, the student, in the Super Bowl: ''Not if I'm still teaching Magellan and Columbus. Not if I'm outdated. I'm just concerned we can stay with him.'' On the importance of scoring first in the Super Bowl: ''I don't know if it's important to score first. Now if you score first, second and third, that's another thing.'' On the success of the Bengals' no-huddle offense: ''It's very creative, very interesting. It took time to refine it. I think it's the wave of the future in football. But one problem with it is that the team using it fatigues quickly.'' On whether other teams will adopt the no-huddle offense: ''We've seen the nickel defense developed by George Allen and the 46 defense by Buddy Ryan. We've seen the one-back offense from Joe Gibbs and the Redskins. People emulate those things, and they often fail.'' On his offensive plans for the game: ''We hope to throw in the neighborhood of 30 passes. We hope we can complete 20. It's up to Joe Montana to sustain the offense on those third-and-4, third-and-5 situations.'' On the one-sided Super Bowls in recent years: ''It's like a heavyweight fight, a championship fight. Both people come in really armed, but it ends very quickly. That can happen in football. One team gets a lead and the other begins to take more and more calculated risks. The odds get higher with everything they do, and they're unable to change the course of the game and the score gets out of hand.''",1989-01-22T05:00:00+0000

us,AT REST IN GOOD COMPANY,"Cemeteries are, perhaps paradoxically, living catalogues of history, and when it comes to name-dropping there are few that can match Woodlawn Cemetery's roster of illustrious interments. From the first burial there in 1865, Woodlawn's 400 splendidly landscaped acres have grown increasingly crowded; today there are almost 300,000 occupants. Among them are six New York mayors (including Fiorello LaGuardia), the diplomat Ralph Bunche, the dancers Irene and Vernon Castle, Duke Ellington, Joseph Pulitzer, F. W. Woolworth, Robert Moses, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Herman Melville, Fritz Kreisler, the feminist crusader Carrie Chapman Catt, George M. Cohan, Damon Runyon, the nation's first admiral, David Farragut, the financier Jay Gould and one of his nemeses, the cartoonist Thomas Nast. Woodlawn, in the Bronx, grew as an alternative to Brooklyn's no less beautiful Green-Wood, also a cemetery filled with notables and marked by similar extraordinary statuary. The route from Manhattan to Green-Wood became, it seems, too vulgarly populated to hold a somber procession and some gentry sought a new site out of town and accessible by train or boat. In WOODLAWN REMEMBERS: Cemetery of American History (North Country Books, Paper, $24.95), Edward F. Bergman, chairman of the department of geology and geography at Lehman College, approaches with historical perspective and gentle humor a topic that in other hands might have been dulled by palliative pieties. He writes of cemeteries and their role in spurring public parks to match their own charm. He provides a list of the famous architects whose handiwork memorializes the wealthy departed in a style suitable to the manner they knew when they were alive. Each of his entries contains an illustration dealing with the notable in life, along with a photograph of the tomb, grave or mausoleum in Woodlawn and a tidy biography. Mr. Bergman understands that a cemetery is less a story about how one died than it is an account of how one lived.",1989-01-22T05:00:00+0000

The Cavaliers had seven players in double figures, and the 142 points represented their best output of the season. They won their fifth game in a row and their 12th straight at home to improve their league-leading record to 30-7. The 6-foot-11-inch Nance, going against such defenders as 6-8 Larry Smith and 6-5 Mitch Richmond, took control of the game early, scoring 16 first-half points to help Cleveland to a 72-52 halftime lead. Richmond's 3-point shot at the start of the second half got the Warriors within 17, but they got no closer. Chris Mullin led Golden State with 27.(AP) Pacers 117, Nuggets 102: Herb Williams had a team-record 29 rebounds as Indiana defeated Denver at home to end a five-game losing streak. Reggie Miller led the Pacers with 27 points.

Anderson also had nine assists and six steals, both season highs. The Spurs used a 22-6 third-quarter run to blow open what had been a tight game. Miami finished with 34 turnovers, one shy of its season high.

Flames 3, Canadiens 1: Joe Mullen snapped a 1-1 tie with eight seconds left in the second period and Joe Nieuwendyk scored Calgary's other two goals as the Canadiens' 18-game home-ice unbeaten streak was snapped. The Canadiens, who hold a 3-point edge over Calgary in the overall league standing, had won 16 and tied 2 at the Forum since Oct. 29. Mullen beat the Montreal goaltender, Brian Hayward, just seconds after Calgary won a face-off in the Canadiens' zone. Mullen, positioned at the top of the right face-off circle, used the Montreal defenseman Chris Chelios as a screen while unleashing a shot that caught the corner to Hayward's left. It was Mullen's 31st goal of the season.

The menu changes daily and includes three entrees (red meat, poultry and fish) served with hearth-roasted winter vegetables. Dinner can start with carrot soup and ''spider'' corn bread; entrees might be turkey, leg of lamb and tuna or salmon steak. Lunch is $4.50 to $7.50 and is served from noon to 2 P.M. Friday to Sunday.

Not taking any shots at Miami, because cocaine is everywhere, but it is probably more prevalent there than anywhere else in America. It was an obvious fact we couldn't overlook. We had some extra concerns about Stanley, but we didn't expect a relapse.'' Coach Sam Wyche took exception to Turner's observations.

Page 1 Possible collapse of the Afghan Army is a danger to Soviet troops in the last three weeks of their withdrawal through mountain passes that hold hundreds of ambush sites and thousands of Afghan guerrillas. 1 A U.S. survey of damage in Armenia after an earthquake last month has found an almost unscathed village only three miles from catastrophic damage. Soil conditions may have made the difference. 5 Angolan officials say they will seek a political solution to their nation's long-running civil war, amid reports that the Government has had contacts with the Unita rebels. 4 A decision by a South African judge that let a white avoid jail after he killed a black has been condemned by Johannesburg's legal association. A Member of Parliament said she would seek impeachment. 28 The U.N. is withholding food aid from Ethiopian refugees in Somalia because of what they say is Somalia's use of refugees in the military. Somalia has accused the United Nations of endangering 400,000 refugees. 4 Yasir Arafat held official talks with the European Community for the first time. Afterward, West European officials said they backed his call for an international conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict. 3 At a Solidarity church meeting, an official of the trade union was greeted with suspicion over the Polish Goverment's intentions for talks that Solidarity agreed to last Sunday. 3 Two Nazi war criminals got pardons from the Dutch Parliament after spending 43 years in prison. They were convicted for their parts in the deaths of more than 10,000 Dutch Jews in World War II. 3 Taipei journal: When Greeks ask Trojans to step into the horse 4 National 6-9, 32 Savings and loan deposits are safe and all guarantees would be honored by the Government, President Bush said as he sought to calm depositor fears over industry troubles and a over plan for account fees. 1 Two representatives of Unisys pleaded guilty to charges of making illegal campaign contributions, and a Pentagon supervisor pleaded guilty to taking bribes, in developments of the Pentagon fraud inquiry. 1 Questions on John G. Tower's work as a military consultant continue. And the Secretary of Defense-designate is likely to face more questions on that score next week. 8 Lyndon LaRouche was sentenced to 15 years in prison for scheming to defraud the I.R.S. and deliberately defaulting on more than $30 million in loans from his supporters. 1 Stock prices surged again as foreign buying intensified and the Dow Jones industrial average completed its best week in eight months. A stronger dollar and reports of a slightly weaker economy helped push up prices. 1 A ban on the sale of assault rifles has become much more likely after a gunman's rampage on a schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., and a wave of gang violence. 1 The political role of a Chicago area is larger than its size would suggest. In a city where most citizens vote along racial lines, affluent ''lakefront liberals'' are the only white voters likely to support a black. 9 President Bush endorsed a pay rise to increase Congressional salaries by 50 percent, bringing sighs of relief to Capitol Hill. But he said parts of the proposal ''bother people, including me.'' 8 Bush grapples with the press's follow-up questions 6 Bush says interdiction is also important in drug fight 7 President Bush can be ordered to testify at the criminal trial of Oliver North along with former President Reagan, a Federal judge said; he said that he would do so only ''as a last resort.'' 8 Jack Kemp said his top priority as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development would be to deal with homelessness, which he told a Senate panel is ''a national tragedy of appalling proportions.'' 7 Senate panel moves swiftly to approve trade nominee 7 The economy grew at an annual rate of 2 percent during 1988's fourth quarter, after 1.1 percentage points were subtracted to account for the summer's drought. 35 A $434 million takeover offer was made by the Prospect Group, an acquisitions company, for the Illinois Central Transportation Company, which operates the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad. 35 Apple Computer earnings will drop in the current quarter, the company said, in a dramatic reversal from a statement last week. 35 Regional 29-32, 50 Uncertainty over electricity costs and future supplies on Long Island is taking a rising toll on businesses on the Island, economists and business leaders say. Many companies are frustrated by the Lilco stalemate. 1 The six sons of Stephen Kelley, who was killed by an off-duty New York City police officer, say they feel adrift and lonely without their father but are keeping busy and bracing for an agonizing reunion. 29 Twenty-five doctors were expelled along with 20 pharmacies from the Medicaid program by New York State, which said they prescribed and dispensed unnecessary drugs to addicts and billed the Government. 29 The City Hall job-dispensing that recently came under an unflattering spotlight of a state investigation was as much a case of personal as political patronage, with officials finding jobs for relatives and friends. 29 Seton Hall's student base is changing from working class to affluent while the Catholic university watches its basketball team rack up a remarkable 17-2 record and second place in the Big East conference. 29 When the New York City authorities determined that Ralph Richardson had committed suicide, they combined physical evidence with the event's circumstances and a dash of common sense, officials said. 31 A college student and a bank teller were arrested in connection with the attempted bombing at a surgical supply company that uses dogs for research. 30 The search for a Hasidic rabbi continues 31 Neediest Cases 10",1989-01-28T05:00:00+0000

In the Austria of the Anschluss, 16-year-old Helga Wegscheider zealously embraces Hitler's message, convinced of the justice of his design for Europe. Like her fiance, an SS soldier, she devotes herself passionately to the Nazi cause. But at home something else is taking shape, outside the scope of Helga's bedazzled vision: her brothers hold secretive Bible-group meetings, her parents' conversation is sprinkled with cryptic remarks. Only years later do the pieces fall into place, revealing to Helga her family's involvement in the Viennese resistance. ''All Our Games'' is a forceful American debut for Erika Mitterer, one of Austria's most eminent poets, whose fiction has never before appeared in an English translation. Complex and multilayered, it tackles head on the agonizing question of collective guilt for World War II, without rationalization but with burrowing introspection. Ms. Mitterer spares few truths. ''We enjoyed the war,'' her narrator writes. ''I was one of them, one of these shabby cowards who only shout with joy for the rich and mighty and despise the loser.'' It's hard at first to like Helga, who tells the story in the form of a memoir for her 15-year-old son, whose paternity is the book's central, page-turning mystery; but we readily respect her for surmounting her own ignobleness. The translation by Catherine Hutter is stilted and literal rather than lyrical, but it can't affect the potent, poetic witness this novel bears to what it was like to live the war from the other side - and survive as a human being.",1989-01-29T05:00:00+0000

Although there have been memorable basketball teams led by greater individuals, there may have been no more remarkable combination of players than the 1970 National Basketball Association champions, the New York Knicks, led by their buttery-smooth point guard, Walt Frazier. ''We weren't the tallest, fastest, or best jumpers,'' Mr. Frazier writes. ''We were just the most intelligent team I've ever seen.'' Unfortunately, ''Walt Frazier: One Magic Season,'' an autobiography that focuses on the 1970 season, is thin on background and context: his childhood in Atlanta in the 1950's whizzes by with the speed of a breakaway layup. Disappointingly, Mr. Frazier and his co-author, Neil Offen, a former New York Post sportswriter, do not lavish much more attenton on any other topic: the Knicks' coach, Red Holtzman, and Mr. Frazier's teammates - including Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusschere, Dick Barnett and Willis Reed - appear as mere sketches. An account of the record-setting 18-game winning streak early in the season is so much wood to be chopped, and the rest of Mr. Frazier's career is an afterthought (the Knicks won another title three years later but ''the funny thing is, I can barely remember that second championship''). Even the description of the climactic seventh game of the 1970 championship against Wilt Chamberlain's Lakers, enlivened by the undeniable drama of Mr. Reed's wounded glory, is more perfunctory than moving. The book, which suffers from the cautious, steady style that made Mr. Frazier successful as a player and television commentator, is forgotten as quickly as it is read. What remains is what existed before: the memory of an ineffably wonderful basketball team.",1989-01-29T05:00:00+0000

Moira Finch is a broke, straight social climber with a heart of unalloyed steel who has a penchant for disastrous investments. ''Blue Heaven'' is their nuptial adventure story, following them as they embark on a marriage designed to swindle their rich but parsimonious families out of a fortune in wedding gifts. Greed, lust, blackmail, petty jealousy - they're all here, described with glib alacrity by Gilbert's best friend (and sometime lover) Philip Cavanaugh, a struggling songwriter who is in for a cut. As Gilbert and Moira try to outfox their families, their friends and each other, they confront the wrath of both his Mafia stepfamily and an affected SoHo designer who speaks ''as if it were midnight and she was standing on a railway platform in Zurich, fingering the blueprints under her trenchcoat while waiting for the Belgian with the carnation'' - not to mention the ire of assorted muscular, jilted ex-lovers. By the time the plot escalates to a scene in which a drug-addled transvestite bank officer impersonates Moira's dear Mummy, the Duchess, for the benefit of Gilbert's family, it's clear that Joe Keenan has put the high back in high jinks. His sendups of trendy poseurs and criminal nouveaux riches are biting and dead on. Mr. Keenan, a playwright and lyricist, has a good ear for a gag (''I soon learned,'' his narrator reports, ''that though mafiosi are heinous sorts with no respect for law or the sanctity of human life, they do, as a class, tip well'') and his dialogue is refreshingly effervescent. This novel will be thoroughly enjoyed whenever there's a little time to kill - on the beach, in transit or while bedridden with a lingering cold. ''Blue Heaven'' may not be ethereal literature, but it certainly has the gift of gab.",1989-01-29T05:00:00+0000

Annie Proulx's nine stories, who have come to northern New England to seek self-renewal by grouse hunting, trout fishing or folk singing, are as harried by misery as the people who live there. Cut off from their spouses or harassed by their mothers and sisters, they are shy, battered, depleted men. In ''The Wer-Trout,'' for example, two neighbors named Rivers and Sauvage go north to fish the swamps known as the Yellow Bogs. Sauvage's wife has been carted off by her doctor for putting a mouse in her mouth. Rivers's wife has intuited her husband's itch of interest in this wire-haired woman, who's plowed across their lawn in a Jeep, ravaging their young apple tree and garden. Enraged, Mrs. Rivers leaves for the city with her tapestry designs, sewing box and vitamins, declaring her husband ''a fishing alky'' who can't make a living or secure decent neighbors. At the bog, Rivers drinks whisky, fishes naked and treads on his precious bamboo rod, while Sauvage, with discount-store gear, catches large lunkers that he fries and eats ''as he would a slice of watermelon.'' Through the contrast between Rivers and Sauvage, Ms. Proulx explores both the cultural and sexual conflicts of her characters. Similar concerns are at play in ''Bedrock,'' a story in which Bobhot Mackie (one of the many odd regional names that appear in Ms. Proulx's fiction) installs his sister Maureen as housekeeper - and then new wife - to a mournful widower named Perley in order to seize control of the older man's farm. As this convoluted relationship deteriorates, Perley has a surprising revelation as he recalls a hazy incident from his past, thus confronting his own moral culpability. Ms. Proulx's stories are most compelling when they're rooted in a coarse rural sexuality. At these times, their sometimes enigmatic, often lyrical images seem to complement New England's lavish but barren beauty.",1989-01-29T05:00:00+0000

There are thought to be 40,000 Asians in Brick Lane, mostly Muslims from Bengal, a region cleaved in 1947 when India was partitioned and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) created. They have come for many reasons - exiles, refugees, schemers - and they have not always been welcomed.

In her first novel, Andrea Barrett enlists the whole empyrean - Orion through Libra through Pegasus - to serve as a backdrop for and sad commentary on a dissolving family. Her story opens on a Vermont mountaintop in 1955 when 19-year-old Penny Webb succumbs to the charms of a ski bum named Benjamin Day. In rapid succession, Penny becomes pregnant, married and miserable. While her new husband carves Cape Cod into housing developments and chases other women, she withdraws into twin solaces: her children, Cass and Webb, and her study of the stars. But after 11 years of marriage even these fail her. The family breaks apart, its ''elements joining and separating and recombining into changing patterns.'' Penny divorces Benjamin, who marries a younger woman, Diane, who gives birth to a third child; Cass and Webb carry on continuous domestic warfare against their stepmother; Benjamin wearies of Diane, too, and divorces her to marry yet another younger woman, Jill. By the time ''Lucid Stars'' concludes, in 1977, these characters have settled into a sprawling familial constellation - ''as if,'' Diane notes, ''their loose-linked family hangs in the sky, joined for a few minutes by the wandering moon.'' Initially the prose in this sidereal drama suffers from a certain slackness, but as the novel gains momentum it deepens, and Ms. Barrett's language adeptly rises, or falls, to portray occasions of considerable unhappiness. She also possesses the gift of forgiving her characters more readily than they do one another - which is neither more nor less than they deserve. In doing so, she has made a spacious and sympathetic debut.",1989-01-29T05:00:00+0000

With its almost magical ability to create money out of thin air, the powerful and mysterious Federal Reserve has probably been the focus of as many conspiracy theories as the freemasons and the Trilateral Commission. William Greider ''has set out not just to demystify the Fed, but to place it in context, especially in the last decade,'' Adam Smith said here last year.

us,Cambodian War Seen Through Cambodian Eyes,"JUST 30 FEET AWAY, IN THE SUN-FLECKED shadows of the Cambodian jungle, was the sight that locals and visitors most dread: crouched, aiming his rifle, a teen-ager in dirty black pajamas and a red-checked scarf; nearby were four other Khmer Rouge guerrillas, in black with checked scarves, darting and dodging behind trees, guns pointed. Within minutes, the battle erupted. Through the noise and smoke of gunfire, exploding mines and burning leaves, two men seemed to be hit. Then, bizarrely, above the pandemonium came the sound of children laughing. Someone shouted ''Coupez!'' And the cameras stopped rolling. The feature film being shot in Kompong Speu Province last month isn't the first movie about the Khmer Rouge. In addition to the American ''Killing Fields'' (1984) and a recent Czechoslovak feature, ''Nine Circles of Hell,'' several documentaries have tried to show the genocidal Communist regime that ruled Cambodia from 1975 through early 1979, leaving the country in ruins and a sixth of its population dead. But this is the first film about the Khmer Rouge made by Cambodians in Cambodia - in fact, the first film of any kind made there since the Khmer Rouge dismantled the society in 1975.",1989-01-29T05:00:00+0000

'' By way of answer, he explains how important it was to Mr. Bernstein to have dramatic credibility in the casting, to have his singers ''really become the characters they were singing.''

Latest quarter and year reflected restructuring charges of $44,000,000 and $52,000,000, respectively. The company said prior year results are restated for an accounting change. The comany said the latest quarter earnings benefited by a $2,000,000, or 2 cents a share, by higher exchange rates for foreign currencies; for the year, the benefit was $22,000,000, or 23 cents a share. The company said in 1987, Taylor Food Products Inc. and certain components of Pumps and Valves (subsidiaries of Gallaher Ltd.) were sold and the company announced plans to discontinue operations and dispose of Sunshine Biscuits Inc., Pinkerton's Inc. and the Andrew Jergens Company. Accordingly, results of these operations were separately classified. The estimated net gain on the disposition of these companies was deferred at Dec. 31, 1987, until the sales were completed. During 1988, the company sold Sunshine Biscuits, Pinkerton's, and Andrew Jergens, the remaining components of Pumps and Valves and W. R. Case & Sons Cutlery Company. Proceeds from the sale of these companies approximated $648 million and resulted in a net gain of approximately $58 million. This gain, partly offset by losses from operations of discontinued subsidiaries, resulted in income of $39 million for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 1988. The latest and year-ago periods all included results of operations since dates of acquisition of the distilled spirits business of National Distillers and Chemical Corporation (acquired May 1987) and ACCO World Corporation (acquired August 1987) as well as certain subsidiaries purchased from E-II Holdings Inc.

Then the wide receiver protested at a news conference that his complaints last week about not receiving proper recognition from the news media were ''blown out of proportion.'' Rice stressed that charges of racism had been in no way implied in his critical remarks. ''I was the most valuable player,'' he said at a ceremony at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. ''I thought I deserved more coverage, but between Bill Walsh retiring as coach and stories about Joe Montana, I got lost in the shuffle. I'm a real modest guy, but I went out and played my best ball that day. It's not that I wanted all the attention. I just wanted respect for what I achieved. It surprised me that I had to say something to get attention. But it was something that had to be said.'' ''What I said won't hurt the 49ers,'' he said. ''Joe Montana and I have a good understanding, good chemistry. My complaints were not against Joe.
