No matter the destination  from Qatar to the Caribbean  theres some attendant glamor shot of a zero-edge pool or a honeymooning couple kicking at shells on the beach at dusk. Its mind numbing. Then the other day a book passed our desk called South Africa, by a new publishing venture called Well Souled. The volume is a hefty and, yes, glossy 312 pages: images of the countrys people, landscape, architecture, food, fashion, iconography. The founder and editor Mital Shah, a 31-year-old former executive at Vera Wang, says she came across all her subjects solely through word of mouth. I didnt cast a wide net. I just let one person lead to the next. And I tried to meet everyone, but I didnt try to cover everything. (To document her far-flung network, theres a map of her contacts at the end of the book.) The result is a seductive but not synthetic portrait of a place; we encounter musicians, athletes, and designers, along with children orphaned by AIDS, ordinary citizens, and pinup girls from the pages of 1950s Drum magazine. I wanted this project to be about being well-traveled but always being soulful about how you travel, says Shah, who will release books on more countries and who has plans to apply the concept to other media, along with fashion and home design. We want to offer luxury and culture at the same time  and always be giving back. To put its money where its passport is Well Souled will give 20 percent of the sales of South Africa to organizations that help AIDS orphans; the same percentage from a book about India will go toward rural education. Its a big number, but we wanted to put that stake in the ground. Were feeling that. To order a copy, go to www.wellsouled.com.",2008-02-01T16:57:59+0000

In this slim memoir, Hartog, a noted novelist and playwright who died in 2002, sketches his mother: shes the girl beneath the flowering cherry, the piously forbearing housewife and the white-haired mischievous saint, attested doer of good works in Japanese prison camp and Dutch retirement home alike. But at its heart, A View of the Ocean is an unsparing account of her death. De Hartog was a sort of northern European Hemingway: a best-selling novelist and legitimate hero of the Dutch resistance before he turned 30. But for all his physical and moral courage, he couldnt bear nursing his mother in the last weeks of her life. He breaks down in the attempt  and the simple rhythm of his prose turns to a howl. In particular, hes undone by the stench of her cancerous breath: It defeated everything in me that wanted to help, to love, to succor. This is painful to read, but that pain is necessary to understand why de Hartog  though a lifelong skeptic  turns to prayer, and to believe in the religious revelation that follows. The ending suggests he will convert to Quakerism. In fact, he did, adamantly, and went on to write several well-regarded novels about that faith.",2008-02-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Paperback Row,"THE VIEW FROM CASTLE ROCK: Stories, by Alice Munro. (Vintage International, $14.95.) Munro (right) based her 12th collection of stories on family records extending back to their origin in the Scottish lowlands. They were not memoirs but they were closer to my own life than the other stories I had written, she explains in a foreword. You could say that such stories pay more attention to the truth of a life than fiction usually does. But not enough to swear on. In the books second half, Munro moves toward the present and her typical themes: class, domesticity, sexual desire and the tensions between ambition and loyalty, duty and dreaming. Our reviewer, A. O. Scott, said Munro is incapable of writing a sentence that is sloppy, dishonest, unnecessary or dull. Another story collection  his first  comes from Colm Toibin, the author of five novels, including The Master. All nine of the tales in MOTHERS AND SONS: Stories (Scribner, $14) contain a mother and son, but rarely are they together. Instead, Toibin is interested in people in hiding from themselves and their feelings, and in the relationship between the watcher and the watched. Writing in the Book Review, Pico Iyer found that Toibins craft is immaculate, and that the stories are beautiful and echoing, but warned that despite its title, this is not ... a collection to share with your loved ones on the second Sunday in May.",2008-02-03T05:00:00+0000

The only way to save these people is to throw a switch that will divert the train to another track. This will save the five, but unfortunately will kill another person standing on the second track. Now imagine the same runaway trolley and the same five people, but this time you are standing on a bridge above the track, next to a very large stranger. The only way to stop the trolley is to shove the man off the bridge and into the trolleys path, killing him but saving the five. (It wont help to jump yourself; youre too small to stop the trolley.) What is interesting is that both situations present the option of saving five by killing one, but most people respond to them differently. Most believe that you would be right to throw the switch, yet wrong to push the man. But why do we think this? And are we right to do so? ",2008-02-03T05:00:00+0000

Making pudding, on the other hand, is a different kind of exercise in stretching time  a pleasant one. The five minutes spent in front of a stove, dragging a wooden spatula across the pan to ward off scorched spots and looking for that subtle thickening that seizes the custard just before all-out lumps break out, are elastic, meditative, (ideally) unbothered  a reminder that sometimes the comfort of a comfort food has less to do with eating than it does with cooking.

Buddy Elias, Franks  82-year-old cousin, who is chairman of the Anne Frank-Fonds, a Swiss-based charitable organization that holds the copyright to The Diary of a Young Girl, said: We are very much against it. The Holocaust is not a theme to be made into a musical. He said that the foundation had not opposed earlier film, theater and television adaptations because they were considered realistic. He noted, however, that the foundation had no recourse against the musical because it does not quote from the diary. Rafael Alvero, the director and developer of The Diary of Anne Frank: A Song to Life, scheduled to open on Feb. 28 at the Caldern Theater in Madrid, insisted that the show was very faithful to the diary.

The shooting occurred about 5:30 a.m., after a vehicle with four occupants pulled up in front of the house, on North 12th Street, and two of the four went to the front door. Apparently, the suspects were mistakenly searching the wrong residence for someone they were going after, said Paul M. Loriquet, a spokesman for the prosecutor. The officer, whose name was not released, was getting ready for work at the house, which belongs to a friend or relative, when he heard the banging and answered the door, taking his service pistol with him, Mr. Loriquet said. One of the men at the door, Khalif Cousar, 29, of East Orange, pointed a loaded handgun at the officer, who fired three times, killing Mr. Cousar, Mr. Loriquet said. No one else was injured. The three suspects were being questioned on Sunday. Mr. Loriquet said that after a preliminary investigation, it appeared the shooting was justified. Compiled by Denise Fuhs",2008-02-04T05:00:00+0000

A competitive field of Democratic candidates was reflected in earlier fund-raising and more aggressive spending through early 2003.

The New York Post praises them as Supermen! while The Daily News blares Champs on their front covers. Giants quarterback Eli Manning, arguably played more like Brady than Brady himself, and was awarded the most valuable player award only a year after his older brother, Peyton Manning, won it while leading the Indianapolis Colts to the championship.The newspapers dissect the heart-stopping game (the lead switched three times during the final quarter). The Patriots defense crumbled in the fourth quarter, which proved telling given that the Giants aggressive defense shut down what was perhaps the best offense in the history of football. While the Giants were universally deemed the underdog, Plaxico Burress, who caught the game-winning touchdown, exhibited prescience in his pre-game prediction of a low-scoring game with a small margin of victory in favor of the Giants (off by the winning margin, off by the exact score, but close enough that everyone is praising him).

And Binx himself represents a certain kind of self-conscious Southern protagonist who isnt quite an anti-hero but is self-conscious, well aware of his limitations and foibles  if he doesnt in fact revel in them. Hes wounded and he knows it and he loves himself for it  hes a noble Confederate junior officer ill-equipped for life in the squalid Union, and proud of it.

There were predictable retorts: ""Yankees Stink"", or its equivalent. When they played ""New York, New York"" over the loudspeaker after the award presentation, it must have reminded New Englanders of the swagger that accompanied so many Yankee victories over the years.",2008-02-05T05:00:00+0000

us,The Featherweights,"Im glad we have a show in New York thats generating some debateHalston, of course. Theres nothing in my review tomorrow about Jil Sander, though I did wonder if the tulle-veiled tweed and embroidered skirts, etc. at Herrera and Oscar started with Raf Simons transparency collection for spring. I think the only point of comparison between Sander and Halston is that both designers had to clean house a bit with their brands, find the main points. (I hate that dreaded word DNA; I expect to find bodies.) After two or three seasons of establishing a line and his tailoring, as well as the great dresses, Simons has felt free to do more with Jil. I suspect Marco Zanini will do the same thing. The guy is smart, and not affected by the side-show dramas. And look at all the boxy, flaring and embellished jackets weve seen on the runways this weekthe oversized grunge plaid at Preen, the A-line shapes at Herrera, the tweed numbers at Oscar. And who does a super-simple, sharp-shouldered, one-button jacket with a slim skirt (on Freja) and makes it look new? Mister Zanini. That was my favorite look in the show. Its all about knowing what to eliminate. I agree with Marco about the 70s context thing, though I looked at it differently in the review. Halson was not about the furnishings; he was about the architecture: line and cut, and color for visual impact and warmth. So what was Liza M. doing in the front row? Why do the new owners feel they have to sell Halston by telling the history? Its such an old approach. ",2008-02-05T23:31:40+0000

About two-thirds of the references put drugs, alcohol and tobacco in a positive light by associating them with sex, partying and humor, the study said. Some genres, like rap and country in comparison with pop, have more references than others. The team used Billboard charts to identify the most popular songs of 2005, based on sales and airplay. They selected the 279 most popular from country, pop, R&B, rap and rock to examine for references to drugs, alcohol and tobacco. One third had explicit references; 42 percent had some kind of substance abuse reference.

Long-range missiles are one of the components of such weapons. That causes concern.

His comment was nuanced, but by even bringing climate policy into a conversation on severe weather, he was probably destined to get roughed up. The reason? The science remains utterly equivocal on how global warming might boost the longstanding peril from tornadoes in the storm belt.",2008-02-07T19:31:48+0000

And for the last few decades, at least, it worked. But here, once again, come the chaotic winds of democracy to derail the efficient engine of party politics. The Democratic race, in particular, could go all the way to Denver, and it could end uglyperhaps with super delegates hijacking the convention, or with lawyers arguing about whether Florida and Michigan should be seated.The accepted wisdom about such drawn-out, titanic clashesand the reason that insiders have worked so hard to preclude themis that they are ruinous for a party. The failures of sitting presidents like Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter (as well as challengers like Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale) are said to have proven that parties riven by internal disputes in the summer are incapable of reuniting in the fall; a nominee needs time before the convention to soothe feelings, raise money and recast himself for the general election. This year, though, the accepted wisdom is at least half wrong. That is, it probably still holds true for Republicans, but it could be a mistake to assume the same about Democrats.",2008-02-07T23:05:22+0000

But Ms. McCauley said on Thursday that the five months of protests led by a group calling itself Enough Is Enough now lacked specificity and impact. I thought this was more like the Montgomery bus boycott, but going into the sixth month, this looks more like the Salem witch trials or The Scarlet Letter, Ms. McCauley said in an e-mail message. The protests are led by Baptist ministers who say that BET broadcasts music videos that degrade women and black and Latino men. After focusing on Ms. Lee, the protest rallies spread to the Upper East Side home of Philippe Dauman, the president and chief executive of Viacom, which owns BET. The Rev. Delman L.

Its called an orchestra. But how do you organize them? Pay them? Make use of their time? Keep them happy? Keep audiences happy?All sorts of models exist. I had a chat with Ivan Fischer, who leads the Budapest Festival Orchestra, at a Lincoln Center bakery/eatery on Friday, and he told the story of his group. It sounded pretty special. Now since I have not looked closely at exactly how the orchestra works, it is hard to gauge the reality. But at the least, Mr. Fischers description sounded like a fine ideal.The Budapest Festival Orchestra has been around since 1983, when Mr. Fischer, a budding freelance conductor at the time, decided to settle down and helped establish it. But it has not achieved the notice in this country of other top European bands. It has concert dates Friday night and Sunday afternoon as part of Lincoln Centers Great Performers series.Mr. Fischers orchestra, he said, has three cardinal virtues, established at its creation: an emphasis on the players individual creativity; few rules, for maximum flexibility; and unusual programming.Thus, on Point 1, the orchestra has internal concerto competitions, so not just principals get to play solos. Players are encouraged to come up with their own chamber music programs. Seating rotates. More active musicians make a better team, said Mr. Fischer, who speaks slowly with a Hungarian accent. The no-rules rule means no long-term contracts, no overtime and auditions that end up with five or six finalists who play with the orchestra.Innovative programs mean daylong festivals devoted to a composer; surprise concerts, in which the program is unknown until the players come on stage; and sight-reading concerts, in which a slip of paper is drawn out of a tuba bell with a seat number. The person in that seat then picks the piece. A truck with the orchestra library is waiting outside, so the parts can be delivered. Next season, the orchestra comes to Carnegie Hall with Gypsy musicians.Often readers of material like the above will write in and say, Gee, thats all very well, but my orchestra has been doing those things for ages; you failed to mention X, Y and Z. So consider this an open invitation to comment on ArtsBeat about orchestra models, model orchestras and interesting features of both.",2008-02-08T22:18:00+0000

Mr. Young made no distinction between the Vietnam War, during which Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young earned a reputation for political activism, and the war in Iraq, which their tour condemned with songs like Lets Impeach the President. It is all the same war, and it hurts everybody, he said.

Opposition to the war continued and broadened after the election of Richard Nixon that fall, but one of the engines of the antiwar movement, Students for a Democratic Society, largely disbanded after a split in 1969; the next year its leaders, gripped by revolutionary fantasies, went underground.

Popular notions, these, but clinicians familiar with the research of the past 30 years believe otherwise. Well-controlled studies of cognitive-behavioral and other types of psychotherapy have shown them to be as effective as medication for certain kinds of psychological problems, like panic attacks. Indeed, for some disorders, cognitive-behavioral therapy may have longer-lasting effects than medication. Experienced psychiatrists know that both psychotherapy and medication have their proper place and often work best when combined.",2008-02-10T05:00:00+0000
us,Breaking Through," In 2005, at the Sundance Film Festival, a star was born, but almost no one noticed. Well, actually, a few studio executives who saw Hard Candy raved about the performance of the unknown Ellen Page  she played an avenging, psychopathic 14-year-old who entices and then violently tortures a would-be pedophile. But the movie was so relentlessly disturbing (at one point, Pages character ties her enemy down and slowly begins to castrate him) that when Hard Candy was released the following year, no one went to see it. What the audience missed then is what they later found in Juno  the birth of a different sort of actress. Unlike her glamour-girl peers who double as tabloid superstars, Page, who is now 20, is a tomboy  her on-screen persona is sharp, clear-eyed, determined and self-consciously original. In Hard Candy, she managed to be adorable and persuasive while wielding a large knife; in 2007, that same spirit and charm animated Juno, a kind of fairy tale about a pregnant 16-year-old who decides to have the baby and give it to the couple (in the end, half the couple) she chooses. In Juno, the lack of realism  no one questions Junos decision  and the lack of politics are trumped by the overwhelming appeal of Pages acting. She is so alive on screen  so unique, so ingratiating  that she makes the character, and the entire film, believable.",2008-02-10T05:00:00+0000

The two-story, wood-frame synagogue, right, designed by Crescent L.

The design was modeled after synagogues on the Lower East Side, where the founders of the congregation, established in 1907, had originally lived. In 2002 the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also on Tuesday, the commission voted for a third time to designate the Jamaica Savings Bank building, an 1898 Hough & Duell Beaux-Arts structure at 161-02 Jamaica Avenue, in Jamaica, as a landmark. Twice previously, the commissions landmark designation for that building has been overturned: by the Board of Estimate in 1975, and by the City Council in 1992.

Although colleagues long thought they had him pegged, he made an abrupt about-face on vouchers in the most recent issue of City Journal, the institutes magazine, saying there was little evidence they had done much to improve public education across the country. In the circles Mr. Stern inhabits, such a sentiment is a kind of heresy, and his essay has set off a firestorm. But he is relishing the attention.",2008-02-13T14:08:53+0000

Similarly, the group says that of the 194 artists in the collection of the Broad Foundation, the nonprofit organization that acts as a lending library for Mr. Broads art holdings, 96 percent are white and 83 percent are male. That, the group said, is an insignificant number of women and artists of color. Contacted about the statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Broad and his art foundation, Karen Denne, said by e-mail: Women are prominently featured in the opening installation at BCAM, which was curated by Lacma. In fact, 33 percent of the works in the exhibit are by women. One of the largest galleries at BCAM is devoted to Cindy Sherman, whose works the Broads have collected since 1981.' Ms. Denne added, Artwork with a strong social and political perspective has always been important to the Broads and to their collecting. She said that 33 percent of the 43 artists added to the foundations collection since 1995 were women .",2008-02-14T05:00:00+0000

In these graceful dramatic turns the play suggests how the line between enemies, and even identity itself, shifts as easily as the sands for anyone in the surreal state of combat.",2008-02-15T13:51:00+0000

The man, William Kunsman, had met Dr. Faughey and her husband at a guitar camp six years ago and had recent contact with her via e-mail, according to Al Baker. While newspapers observed that Mr. Kunsman had little resemblance to the man in the videotape (Mr. Kunsman appeared to have a full head of hair, while the killer had a bald spot), he had been identified in a picture lineup by Dr. Faugheys colleague, Kent D. Shinbach, a psychiatrist who was in the office during the murder and was critically injured. A patient who was in the office and tried to stop the assailant as he was leaving did not identify Mr. Kunsman. ",2008-02-15T13:54:55+0000

Bloomberg rattled off a grim list of gun rampages across the country that have left at least 18 people dead in February alone, not counting the gunmen who in some cases killed themselves or were killed by police. Mr. Bloombergs comments on his weekly radio call-in were part of his crusade to get illegal guns off the streets.This month John, so far, has just been wretched, the mayor told John Gambling, his host on WABC-AM (770). He said he had asked his press secretary, Stu Loeser to get me a list of things that occurred just this month alone. Yesterday, Northern Illinois University, six people, another one died this morning, six people killed. Last Friday in Baton Rouge, a college student shot and killed two people then took his own life. Last Thursday, a gunman shot and killed five people in Kirkwood, Mo., in the City Hall, killed two City Council members and two police officers, and the mayor was very seriously wounded, and hes hanging in there. And Feb. 2, just a week ago, in the Lane Bryant store in Illinois, a gunmen shot and killed five customers and employees, all in their 20s and 30s.

us,Dream Logic,"We poets in our youth begin in gladness, wrote Wordsworth, who might have felt otherwise had he spent his own youth as an adjunct assistant professor of creative writing. If hed done so, as many younger writers do nowadays, hed probably have thought twice about pairing gladness with a job that often involves $50,000 in student loans and no health insurance. To be fair, its never been easy to be a young poet, and teaching creative writing is certainly safer than working as a roofer. Yet because most are neither wealthy (like the young James Merrill) nor constantly in jeopardy (like Villon), writers in their early careers today face a peculiar and sometimes unenviable set of circumstances. On the one hand, the proliferation of M.F.A. programs gives a poet the chance to make a sort-of living from his art; on the other hand, the insularity of that world can tax both an artists social skills and his resistance to fashion. Given these difficulties, its tempting to replace Wordsworths salute to youthful vitality with the 29-year-old Bon Scotts less optimistic observation: If you wanna be a star of stage and screen / Look out, its rough and mean.

I suggested to my students that the comparison might reflect one difference between 19th- and 20th-century fiction. Perhaps these contrasting openings had something to do with the way our attention spans have been altered  for better or worse  by the bright gratifications of movies and the rhythm of television, which has schooled us to expect the hook before the first commercial.

Youre practicing identity politics when you vote for or against someone because of his or her skin color, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or any other marker that leads you to say yes or no independently of a candidates ideas or policies. In essence identity politics is an affirmation of the tribe against the claims of ideology, and by ideology I do not mean something bad (a mistake frequently made), but any agenda informed by a vision of what the world should be like.

Speaking for about 50 demonstrators outside the De Flint theater in Amersfoort, where Mr. Heesters, above, performed, Piet Schouten said: He kept singing for the Nazi regime, for the Wehrmacht, and he earned millions. Those are facts, and we have a problem with that on behalf of all the victims. Mr. Heesters was never accused of being a propagandist, and the Allies allowed him to continue his career after World War II. But in the Netherlands he is viewed by some as unforgivable, though he wrote in his postwar autobiography, I was ashamed of myself, and I still havent stopped feeling this way. In 1964 he was booed off the stage in Amsterdam when he appeared as the Nazi-hating Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music. No disturbances were reported during the concert in Amersfoort, where Mr. Heesters, who lives in Germany, was born. But a handful of neo-Nazis turned up, uninvited, to support him, and some were detained by the police after they hurled eggs at demonstrators.",2008-02-18T05:00:00+0000

It was marked urgent and inquired if I had received a letter from Armani. I had not, but it didnt take a genius to know what the letter was about. Armani had decided not to invite me to his show and, of course, that was the intent of the letter, once I had read it. He didnt like the tone of my comments about his January couture show in Paris; specifically, he thought I was belittling of his family and friends. I had described their appearance and manner in the moments before the show. It was pretty innocuous stuff. Armani, though, didnt think so. I asked Triefus why Armani had waited until just before todays show to say something; the couture reviews had come out two or three weeks ago. Triefus said Armani had become preoccupied with his ready-to-wear showwere up to fall 2008and hadnt had time to return to the matter until now. Thats our fault, Triefus said.

us,Supreme Court in Japan Upholds Mapplethorpe,"The Supreme Court of Japan on Tuesday overruled a 2003 Tokyo High Court decision and decided that Mapplethorpe, a book of erotic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe (1946-89), shown at right in a self-portrait, did not violate obscenity laws, The Associated Press reported. The decision should pave the way for sale of the book in Japan for the first time in eight years. Although it decided that the book was not indecent, the Supreme Court rejected a demand by the publisher, Uplink, for government compensation of $20,370, according to Takashi Ando, a spokesman for the court. Takashi Asai of Uplink had been contesting the confiscation of the book in 1999 and his voluntary suspension of its sales in 2000 in response to police warnings. In the Supreme Court decision, by a majority of the five-judge bench, Justice Kohei Nasu wrote that the 384-page volume of black-and-white portraits, including 20 close-ups of male genitalia, compiles work from the artistic point of view, and is not obscene as a whole. Mr. Asai sold about 900 copies of the Japanese version of Mapplethorpe, originally published in Japan by Random House in 1994 without objection from the authorities. But airport customs officials, declaring the book obscene, confiscated Mr. Asais copy when he returned from a trip to the United States in 1999. He called the Supreme Court decision groundbreaking and said it could change the obscenity standard used for banning foreign films that depict nudity and for censoring photographs in books.",2008-02-20T05:00:00+0000

And in that final scene, when Violet has finally driven the last of her daughters away, Johnna sings to her from the last lines of the same poem: This is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends.

The claim that MI6 worked with French intelligence agents and the C.I.A. to kill Diana and her lover, Emad Mohamed al-Fayed, known as Dodi, and that the plot was directed by Prince Philip and Prince Charles was made at the inquest this week by Mr. Fayeds father, Mohamed al-Fayed. Sir Richard, below, who led MI6 from 1999 to 2004, was its operations director at the time of the crash. Breaking with the agencys longstanding policy of never commenting on allegations about its activities, he said he could state with complete confidence that MI6 had no operations involving Diana in the summer of 1997 and that allegations of complicity between the agency and Philip and Charles were absurd.

Marion True, the former Getty curator, is charged with conspiring to acquire illicitly excavated antiquities for the museum. Several of the pieces discussed on Wednesday by the prosecution witness, Daniela Rizzo, are now on view at the presidential palace in Rome as part of an exhibition of objects recovered from American museums in the last two years. Ms. Rizzo repeatedly projected an image of an artifact onto a screen next to a photograph of the same piece in a dirt-encrusted, unrestored state. For most of the pieces, she said, acquisition documents provided by the Getty did not cite the objects provenance. If it came from an authorized dig, it would say so and give a date, she said.

us,Playing by Party Rules,"When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, he talked, memorably and incessantly, about protecting those families who worked hard and played by the rules. Sixteen years later, it appears ever more likely that the outcome of this years Democratic nomination fight will rest, in the end, on how party leaders interpret the rules. As Ive written here before, there is no real ideological divide in the party; most Democrats would seem to be satisfied with either Hillary Rodham Clinton or Barack Obama, so theres no reason to think either candidates followers will automatically revolt if they lose. But no matter who wins, if the process itself ends up confirming the growing suspicion among voters that the rules are only there to be rigged, then the outcome could devastate a party whose central argument is all about fairness. Much has been written about the possible permutations in the Democratic race from here on out, but at this point its fairly simple. After his victories Tuesday, Mr. Obama now has a slim but hard-to-surmount lead in pledged delegates  those awarded in state contests. If Mrs. Clinton were to win the trio of Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania by huge margins, then she might be able to overtake him, but that doesnt seem terribly likely, given the dynamic of the race right now. Even so, neither candidate has much chance of emerging from the primaries with the 2,025 delegates needed to lock up the nomination, which means that even if Mr. Obama maintains his lead, Mrs. Clinton canand probably willfight on.",2008-02-21T16:24:11+0000

In a three-day trial that ended on Thursday, lawyers for the Georgia OKeeffe Museum in Santa Fe, N.M., argued that Fisk lost the right to the prized collection and violated the terms of the 1949 gift when it took the works off display and tried to sell some. Fisk countered that it had never tried to sell the whole collection and that it now had the money to display the works according to the artists wishes. Seeking to shore up its finances, Fisk agreed in principle last fall to sell a 50 percent stake in the collection to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark., for $30 million. But on Feb. 8 Ellen Hobbs Lyle, a Davidson County Chancery Court judge, struck down that proposal, saying it went against the donors wishes.

Its origins date to the time when a chap named Alex Collins studied abroad and lived on a commune where many garments were communal property. Eager to recreate back home that year of my life when not having possessions didnt bother me, Collins held a party at which guests were told to swap outfits every time a whistle blew. The mayhem inspired Eloise Markwell-Butler, Dean Slydell, Dani Mazzer and Nick Frew to take the concept public, aided by donations from the vintage megastore Beyond Retro. Swap-a-rama Razzmatazz is now held at Favela Chic in the Shoreditch neighborhood once every month. Clotheslines festoon the club, and when the klaxon sounds, you either swap or split: ogling bystanders are evicted. Markwell-Butler likens it to being in a mad persons laundry.

His new collection of essays, My Unwritten Books, offers blueprints and eulogies for seven books he says hell never write, on topics including his Jewish identity, teaching, animals and politics. These essays are not imaginary CliffsNotes; they stand alone and reveal Steiner at his most complex: irascible and passionate, erudite and self-absorbed, determined to engage the most difficult cultural problems. His lyric fury is sharpest in School Terms, in which he surveys educational practices across the globe  then takes a flamethrower to them. Steiner, who taught at a string of top institutions before settling down at Harvard, then Cambridge, ultimately proposes an bersyllabus that would gorge us on the worlds diverse knowledge.

At no time had it cultivated or mined or manufactured any good; it acted, rather, as merchant, factor, broker, financier. At its beginnings, it imported the axes that it traded for wampum, which it traded for beaver skins, which it sold for export. Later on, it bought corn and wheat from the farms of the north and sent its ships laden with them to the Caribbean, where they exchanged their cargo for sugar, rum, molasses, and indigo, which, on the ships' return, Beeche re-exported to the east and west; sometimes, the eastbound ships, after first calling in Britain or France, traveled down to the African coast and then sailed back across the Atlantic with cargo that was human. Beeche was among the first in New York to trade commercial and government paper, and as the years passed it added the securities of banks, then of railroads, then of manufacturers, to its repertoire. By the turn of the last century the firm had grown into a large financial enterprise with thousands of employees, branches throughout the world, and a dozen divisions. Yet its basic business remained the same: trading for its own benefit and brokering the trades of others. No Beeche had touched a plow or a hammer for centuries, nor had he employed anyone who did.

Now, through the London interior design company Beaudesert and the archives of Ascher Studio, reproductions of Beatons checks, florals and stripes are being sold at Liberty of London. The Cecil Beaton fabric collection  on silk, cotton, linen and wallpaper  was inspired by a scarf that Beaudeserts managing director, Andrew Ginger, found on eBay; Beaton had originally designed it for the textile firm Ascher. In the 1940s and early 50s, Zika Ascher commissioned artists such as Henri Matisse and Henry Moore to design fabrics, paying them 25 per motif, according to his son, Peter. All the big designers, like Balenciaga, Givenchy, Lanvin and Yves Saint Laurent, would buy their fabrics from Ascher Studio. Although not known for his brush strokes, Beaton was an obvious choice for fabric, and Zika allowed him free rein.

us,The Sound and the Fhrer,"Among the many acid pleasures of the work of Roberto Bolao, who died at 50 in 2003, is his idea that culture, in particular literary culture, is a whore. In the face of political repression, upheaval and danger, writers continue to swoon over the written word, and this, for Bolao, is the source both of nobility and of pitch-black humor. In his novel The Savage Detectives, two avid young Latino poets never lose faith in their rarefied art no matter the vicissitudes of life, age and politics. If they are sometimes ridiculous, they are always heroic. But what can it mean, he asks us and himself, in his dark, extraordinary, stinging novella By Night in Chile, that the intellectual elite can write poetry, paint and discuss the finer points of avant-garde theater as the junta tortures people in basements? The word has no national loyalty, no fundamental political bent; its a genie that can be summoned by any would-be master. Part of Bolaos genius is to ask, via ironies so sharp you can cut your hands on his pages, if we perhaps find a too-easy comfort in art, if we use it as anesthetic, excuse and hide-out in a world that is very busy doing very real things to very real human beings.

Mountains of smoke rose to the sky, and mountains of flame came seething down to the earth; every jet that struck the ground turned into a volcano, and rose again, higher than before; the whole mass, boiling and bursting, became a river of fire, a lava flood that went streaming down the valley, turning everything it touched into flame, then swallowing it up and hiding the flames in a cloud of smoke.

us,Early Bloomers,"There were a few blousy moments during the spring collections when you could be forgiven for thinking you were attending an 1850s suffragist rally or a gym class at Vassar in the 1920s. Bloomers  sometimes diaperish, usually subversive and most womens idea of fashion hell  produced smirks and double-takes in New York and Europe. Gaultiers iteration had a Pirates of Penzance picturesqueness. In an unusually insane show, Comme des Garons advanced the possibility of bloomers that were not just frilly but also falling apart. Pradas take, short-short and sewn in shiny fabrics, was straight from the stroller. Betsey Johnson, well, you can guess. While todays bloomers can be traced in a straight line to the pumpkin breeches that Renaissance men wore at the top of their hose, they are but fuzzy cousins to the garment favored by the early womens libber who lent them her name, Amelia Bloomer. She rebelled against the petticoats and floor-grazing skirts of the mid-19th century in favor of knee-skimming designs layered over ballooning trousers gathered at the ankles. The bifurcated look had something weirdly haremlike about it and, however liberating, was light only in relation to what had come before. Bloomer was ridiculed but of course vindicated with the hindsight of history. Designers have fallen in and out of love with bloomers at least since 1976. Bonnie Cashin, the sportswear pioneer, celebrated the bicentennial with a collection of Amelias. Bonnie loved bloomers because they could be completely customized by the wearer, says Stephanie Lake of the Bonnie Cashin Foundation. Is there any designer who hasnt dabbled in bloomers? You can wear out your search engine trying to find one. Saint Laurents fling was in 1987. Vivienne Westwood cast her vote in velvet in 1998. Armani has shown bloomers off and on for several years.

When I asked to borrow Moms dress, she flatly refused, saying that red at a coming-out party went against all codes of etiquette. So I did what any savvy New York girl would do: I called Valentino himself, who was thrilled at the idea of making me the social scandal of the season. He gave me my own gown, and since then, I have worn many more  recently to his anniversary in Rome and to Elton Johns birthday party.

us,Jazz Man,"Nearly a century after jazz emerged as a musical form with profound cultural resonance, the jazz novel, like the theater of the absurd and radio drama, seems an archaism, a good subject for a third-year undergraduate elective or a Bravo documentary. When we think of jazz fiction, we think not only of books centered on the music but of work steeped in the jazz aesthetic  an implacably rigorous and cosmopolitan tradition rooted in the blues and the African-American experience, in which obedience to the moment has primacy. We also call to mind writers dating back to the Harlem Renaissance. We think of Langston Hughes and Jean Toomer; and of F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose legend is inextricable from the age named for jazz; we think perhaps of Kenneth Rexroth; of Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin and Amiri Baraka; and of Jack Kerouac and his fellow Beats, among many others. We think of past eras in a montage of changing modes of headwear: top hats ... fedoras ... kufis ... berets. But we are unlikely to think immediately of jazz when we think of contemporary literature, and we may well conceive of the act of writing a jazz novel in the 21st century as akin to wearing a hat today  as an affectation, a mark of a retro obsession or a hint that one is trying to hide a certain lack of something up top.",2008-02-24T05:00:00+0000

The artist who concocted this misshapen, bug-eyed, fang-toothed, pimply-faced, spaghetti-haired, pig-nosed monstrosity was Basil Wolverton (1909-78), a Mad mainstay who specialized in things ugly. He created Lena the Hyena, a character who appeared in Al Capps Lil Abner and was known as the ugliest woman in Lower Slobbovia. And he was the mastermind behind Powerhouse Pepper, a mock-heroic melodrama, as well as covers for GJDRKZLXCBWQ Comics: A Gallery of Gooney Gags and DC Comics Mad-like Plop! Always recognizable for unbridled grotesquerie, his art ran the gamut from political satire (Candid Close-Ups: Hitler) to goofy science fiction (Rocket Rider) to biblical illustrations (for a decade he wrote and illustrated the Bible story, serialized in The Plain Truth magazine, for the Worldwide Church of God). His epic in this last genre was a gory interpretation of Armageddon, complete with horrific atomic aftermaths. He did, however, also produce posters for Topps, the trading card company. While his penchant for extreme physical exaggeration may not have been to everyones taste, through Mad he exercised incalculable influence on the history of comics and the perceptions of impressionable preteens, like me. Gross was and remains a generational code. ",2008-02-24T05:00:00+0000

They were thinking in more abstract ways, says Janis Staggs, who curated the show Wiener Werksttte Jewelry, which opens at the Neue Galerie in New York on March 27.

I had come from the land of saddle shoes, bobby socks and plaid jumpers, and suddenly I was confronted with a world of snobby 11-year-old sophisticates in nylons, heels and miniature versions of their mothers 70s sheaths. I was still a child  I wanted to go trick-or-treating on Halloween, they wanted to play truth or dare with the boys; I was proud of my Girl Scout merit badges, they wanted to wear their green uniforms to entice older boys.

I myself was wearing earmuffs at the time, but that wasnt the reason I noticed all the other earmuffs  I noticed them because I happen to know that I personally started the trend of earmuffs. I began wearing them at the age of 21, when you could barely find a pair in a store, which doubtless was one reason no one wore them but me. The only ones for sale were made of felt, came in two separate bits and hooked over your upper ear and then snapped against your head. They were inadequate thermal protection compared to my current pair, which are made of fake fur; but they were far superior to being outdoors in winter without anything at all over your ears. I had serious fantasies that by wearing them, I would start something, fashion-wise, and now it seems I have. Its true its taken a while, 45 years to be exact, but earmuffs are definitely catching on, and its because of me.",2008-02-24T05:00:00+0000

They serve the same purpose as the boundary flags in ski resorts. You can ski in the ungroomed powder if you want, but youd better know what youre doing, and be willing to take the risk. Still, we do not turn on the television to watch average skiers take safe trips down the green trails. We turn on the X Games to see heli-skiers land on the top of glaciers and shoot off the edges of the cliffs, or watch the great Shaun White shred some gnarly terrain, as my son says.

It was a stunning day, cloudless and mild. The first show for most of the editors and buyers was Balmain (the tightest, smallest pants and club tops in leather and metal mesh, nothing surprising) and a number of the guests had brought their young children. In the course of the day I heard a lot of things. Will Robert Rimondi and Tommaso Aquilano of 6267 take over Ferre? Is Hedi Slimane in negotiations for his own men's and women's label?

(Photo: Another look from the Rick Owens fall 2008 collection in Paris. (Jean-Luce Hur for The New York Times))   Rick Owens was this afternoon: great show. The collection is more voluptuous than last season, with the familiar darkness and Owens grit. Owens gives a kind of hour-glass shape to jackets, sometimes using two or three fabrics in combination, and creating sculptural effects. The thought process seemed very top to toe, with small, square-ish caps, fins and cube-like volumes on some of the jackets, and wedge-heel boots with flaps that spill around the calf and drag on the ground. In the midst of all this shape and texture were simple tank dresses and skimmy biker shorts in cashmere. Thom Browne happened to be at the show.   The New York Times Magazine and the International Herald Tribune had a party tonight at the Mini Palais. I stopped by for a few minutes. Well, that was the plan... I saw Stefano Pilati, Sidney Toledano of Dior, Kris Van Assche, Maria Cornejo, and Manuel Puig, whose company owns Nina Ricci. Puig is an interesting guy to talk to--about business, U.S. politics, Europe, Formula 1 racing. On my way out, I ran into Karl Lagerfeld and Amanda Harlech.

The commission, acting against only those stations subjected to complaints, fined 13 stations and affiliates $7,000 each.

For nearly 30 years rumors circulated that tomb robbers had dug up the statues on a hillside in the ancient Greek settlement of Morgantina in Sicily. After amassing evidence that they were looted, Italian investigators began seeking a handover of the acroliths  statues usually made with wooden torsos but with stone heads and extremities  in the late 1980s. Mr. Tempelsman, a diamond importer perhaps best known for having been the companion of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, remained unswayed until the Italian government threatened to sue him, an official said Monday. He hadnt wanted to give them up because hed paid for them; thats what he told me, said Mario Bondioli Osio, who formerly headed of an Italian commission that sought to recover the countrys lost cultural patrimony. Mr. Tempelsman, who was said to be traveling and unavailable for comment, bought the acroliths from the London dealer Robin Symes in 1980 for a reported $1 million. In 2002 Mr. Bondioli Osio, Mr. Tempelsman and the University of Virginia worked out a deal under which Mr. Tempelsman would give the university partial ownership of the statues for five years and then cede them entirely. On Jan. 1 the acroliths  their wooden bodies long ago lost, leaving two heads, three hands and three feet  became the property of the university, which promptly returned them to Italy. The statues, one of which is shown above, arrived in Rome on Friday along with nine classical antiquities from the private collection of the New York philanthropist Shelby White that were ceded to Italy in January under a separate pact. Italy says Ms. Whites artifacts were also looted from Italian soil.",2008-02-26T05:00:00+0000

Museums typically collect a thousand times as many things as they get rid of, Mark Taylor, the associations director, said in a posting on its Web site (museumsassociation.org.). Wonderful collections can become a burden unless they are cleared of unused objects. The association told its members to give unused art to other museums or public institutions or, in exceptional circumstances, to sell it. The organization expressed hope that its new policy would encourage museums to put some pieces on display, and said it expected only a few sales each year. Vanessa Trevelyan, convener of the associations ethics committee and head of Norfolk Museum and Archaeology Service, said, Although disposal of items is not without risk, it is preferable to transfer items to an alternative home where they will be treasured, rather than retain material that is not supporting a museums research, display or interpretation functions.",2008-02-26T05:00:00+0000

The show, an adaptation by David Ives of a recently discovered Twain manuscript, was generally well reviewed, and its star, Norbert Leo Butz, drew raves. But the stagehands strike, a traffic jam of plays  some of which received stellar reviews  and the traditionally bad winter months helped do it in. If I thought I could stay open through May, I would, but financially it just doesnt make sense, Bob Boyett, the lead producer, said.And it also just so happens that Macbeth, like its title character, is duly poised to fill the vacancy.

us,The Relevance of Ralph,"Eight years ago, I traveled the country with Ralph Nader. He was sardonic and surprisingly funny. As we drove through post-industrial landscapes of depressing sameness, Mr. Nader kept up a constant monologue about the spiritual costs of box stores and fast food. I recall standing at an airport counter  it was Sioux Falls, or maybe Fargo  where the agent cheerfully informed Mr. Nader that he had been upgraded to first class; he protested vigorously and smoldered the entire flight home. After Mr. Nader was tossed out of the presidential debate site in Boston, he and I watched the next debate in front of the TV at the brownstone that was his Washington headquarters. I ate pizza as Mr. Nader paced the room trying out phantom debate lines and railing against the two corporate supremacists on stage, who, he pointed out, refused to mention the plight of the working poor, the tilt of the political system toward special interests, the human toll of free trade.Mr. Naders candidacy took a dark turn in the closing weeks of the 2000 campaign. Until then, he had been running primarily to get the 5 percent of the vote he needed to qualify the Green Party for matching funds. But then Mr. Naders consuming resentment  at the way leading Democrats pressured his friends to denounce him, at the way Al Gore refused to speak his name  seemed to possess him, and at some point he seemed to make it his mission to deny Mr. Gore the presidency, attacking his Democratic rival in swing states over the protests of his own aides. Ive always thought that Mr. Gore probably could have avoided what came next simply by picking up the phone in those final weeks and making some small gesture of respect toward the man.

That was the essence of a court ruling on Thursday in Bergen, Norway, where the Grammy-winning Ms. Winehouse was scheduled to appear on Friday, Agence France-Presse reported. One of the people involved in the case, Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy Winehouses husband, is currently in jail in Britain and cant make the trip, said Anne Vedvik of the Bergen court. The hearing has therefore been postponed to an undetermined date. Ms. Winehouse, 24, her husband and her hairdresser were arrested in Bergen in October and charged with possessing a quarter-ounce of marijuana. Ms. Winehouse was released after paying a $756 fine, which she later contested. Agreeing to a fine in Norway is equivalent to admitting the charges, which could make it difficult for Ms. Winehouse to obtain visas. Mr. Fielder-Civil has been in custody since November, awaiting trial on charges of assault and conspiracy to pervert the cause of justice. He is accused of trying to bribe a barman not to testify against him in an assault case. ...

Fare Increase,"Updated, 9:40 p.m. | Even the most seasoned subway and bus riders might be a bit confused by some aspects of the fare increases that take effect at 12:01 a.m. Sunday. Passengers who buy regular pay-per-ride MetroCards will start to see odd amounts left over on their cards. Those who buy MetroCards at supermarkets and newsstands will find themselves paying amounts like $17.39 and $52.17. And New Yorkers who want to hoard unlimited-ride MetroCards at the present cost should beware: the M.T.A. wont say how long the cards will be honored. ",2008-02-29T21:17:47+0000

But August is not brainy to the degree of preachiness or wrought with heavy literary earnestness. It is not at all condescending, and  though I know America is so often perceived as haughty and arrogant  it is this America, this mix of high and low, as Frank points out, and this humor thats loaded with so much humanity, that I like to think of as ours. That the play is breaking rules that I havent even considered, as Marsha so fascinatingly explained, is all the more reason to call it American to its core.",2008-02-29T21:49:26+0000
