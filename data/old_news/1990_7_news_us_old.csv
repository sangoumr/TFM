Like all great clowns, Allen Stewart Konigsberg wants to be taken seriously, and Graham McCann has granted his wish. In ''Woody Allen: New Yorker,'' the comic invention known as Woody Allen is scrupulously analyzed for what it may reveal about the cosmic tensions of our age. After more or less apologizing for the comedies that predate ''Annie Hall,'' Mr. McCann, who teaches social and political theory at the University of Cambridge, concentrates on Mr. Allen's later movies, in which the big questions of love, death and ''when do we eat?'' ceased to be funny and became, instead, occasions to preach the need for commitment, faith and family ritual. The author, with the help of Hobbes, Plato, Freud, Kafka, Foucault, Malraux, Rousseau, Baudelaire, DuBois (Blanche) and Wittgenstein, sees Mr. Allen's films as a search for a humane form of comedy that ''absorbs skepticism,'' permitting us to trust. Mr. McCann is a talented writer, but his prose sometimes reaches the kind of critical density that Mr. Allen has hilariously parodied, to wit: ''Jokes are obliged to compete in the market-place of pleasures associated with laughter, and for that reason their materials must be less privileged, less personally limited, and their ludicrous context must be wider than obtains in daily extemporaneous provocations to laughter.''

Instead the Administration formed a study group, to report to the President by Sept. 1, and called for changing the Endangered Species Act to take into account other endangered life forms - like loggers. Federal officials say saving the owl would cost 28,000 jobs in the Pacific Northwest over the next 10 years. Andy Kerr, conservation director of the Oregon Natural Resources Council, called the Bush proposal ''the Tiananmen Square for American wildlife.'' But Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said, ''We take the Endangered Species Act seriously and will implement the law faithfully.

But the financial markets have felt nary a ripple. For the week, the Canadian dollar - still supported by high interest rates - was up 1 percent at 1.1633 to the dollar. The Toronto stock index on Friday was up 14.01 to 3544.6, an increase of 1.5 percent for the week. President Bush's acceptance of the possibility of a tax increase weakened the United States dollar against major currencies at the end of the week.

''Cheb'' and ''chaba'' mean ''young,'' and rai is clearly the music of an urban, modernizing generation.

us,  COCTEAU'S PALETTE,"Jean Cocteau (1889-1963) lived as many lives as a cat, and most of them at the same time. Novelist, poet, playwright, film maker, diarist, critic, illustrator, painter and set designer - this Parisian prodigy knew everyone, tried everything and was invariably attracted to whatever he wasn't up to at the moment. In THE VISUAL ART OF JEAN COCTEAU (International Archive of Art/Abrams, $49.50), William A. Emboden, the research director of the Severin Wunderman Museum in Irvine, Calif., home of the world's largest collection of Cocteau artworks, contends that despite his successes as a writer - and probably because of them - Cocteau really wanted to excel in drawing and painting. For the last 12 years of his life, he worked almost exclusively as an artist, making paintings, murals, ceramics and tapestries, but he despaired of ever becoming as great as, say, his friend Pablo Picasso. Since then, the world has not much praised Cocteau's visual art, and Mr. Emboden rightly challenges this history of benign neglect. Picasso did dominate Cocteau's visual imagination, but Cocteau's witty sensibility sneaks through, most slyly in drawings he made under the influence of opium. Unfortunately, Mr. Emboden is so eager to defend Cocteau that he forgets to evaluate him. This uncritical essay, accompanied by 161 gorgeous color plates, will probably be useful as a reference work, but Mr. Emboden neither marshals the arguments to support his central thesis - that Cocteau ''significantly changed each art form in which he worked'' - nor offers much insight into what these seemingly derivative paintings and sketches have to tell us about Cocteau's more radically innovative novels, movies and plays.",1990-07-01T05:00:00+0000

The wedding Friday of Japan's newest princess, Kiko Kawashima, to Prince Aya, the second son of Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, culminated a year of gently demonstrated Kiko-mania. When the 23-year-old commoner, who is the daughter of a university professor, appeared at her first news conference wearing pearls, brokers soon began recommending pearl companies to clients. Teen-aged girls styled their hair after hers and learned to mimick her polite smile. Copies of her engagement ring to Prince Aya, a pair of intertwined catfish - the species he is studying as a zoologist - sell briskly as wedding souvenirs. All the hoopla has encouraged many Japanese to hope that Princess Kiko will open up the traditionally remote court. The princess, a graduate student in psychology at Gakushuin University in Tokyo, has expressed an interest in finishing her master's degree and pursuing a career, but whether she will be allowed to is uncertain. She has often hinted that she and her husband have separate pursuits. Prince Aya ''likes to study catfish,'' she said recently, ''and I like to study people and cognition.''",1990-07-01T05:00:00+0000

You know, one of those ''You're not getting older, you're just getting fatter and losing your hair'' cards. In fact, reading ''Dave Barry Turns 40,'' a collection of columns by the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist at The Miami Herald, is like going through the humor section of a greeting card store, except there are more laughs here. For example: ''If you pick up any current actuarial table and look up the average life span for a person of your particular age, sex, and weight, you'll realize that, statistically, you have to squint like hell to read the numbers.'' According to Mr. Barry, this is what happens at 40: Thin women eat entire chocolate cakes and the calories go into your body. Members of midlife marriages - ''in thickness as well as health'' - can now write 17-pound books on the way their spouses eat. Men undergo midlife crisis, the symptoms of which are ''wearing enormous pleated pants and designer fragrances ('Ralph Lauren's Musque de Stud Hombre: For the Man Who Wants a Woman Who Wants a Man Who Smells Vaguely Like a Horse')'' and buying ''a boat shaped like a marital aid.'' A woman experiences ''the change'' when her body, in a complex process, senses she ''has reached the stage in her life where her furniture is much too nice for her to have a baby barfing on it.'' Participant sports are limited to golf, fishing and ''shrieking at Little Leaguers.'' And politically, you might wake to find that ''you assign a lower priority to ending world hunger than to finding a cleaning lady.'' Finally, Mr. Barry compares attending a Rolling Stones concert in the 60's with attending one recently. This time the concert started punctually - ''probably because if it hadn't, one of the estimated 13,000 attorneys in the audience would have filed a lawsuit'' - and the crowd was high on knowing they had baby sitters on a weekday night. That Dave, he's a real card.",1990-07-01T05:00:00+0000

As part of a rescue deal from his bankers that enabled the 44-year-old developer to meet an interest payment on a junk bond issue and narrowly avert personal bankruptcy, Mr. Trump was told that he cannot spend more than $450,000 a month on personal and household expenses for the rest of the year. He must scale back that spending to $375,000 a month next year and to $300,000 a month in 1992. Mr. Trump is said to have spent $583,000 on day-to-day necessities in May. The allowance does not cover expenses like mortgage payments and the costs of running his yacht and private plane. Trump, the allowance, gave vast new material to the cartoonists and the television talk show hosts and removed some of the sheen from Mr. Trump's carefully burnished image as an invincible entrepreneur of untold wealth. But while giving up some management control to the bankers, Mr. Trump still kept ownership of his multibillion-dollar empire.

When the Roses' marriage explodes, it becomes a dark, funny divorce to the death, a battle whose weapons include pate of dog.

us,All About/Yellow Pages;   Changing Shopping Habits Keep Those Fingers Walking,"Yellow Pages publishers are learning to behave less like utility companies and more like their advertising brethren on Madison Avenue. In the six years since the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Yellow Pages have gone from dowdy and predicatable - almost like the white pages - to venturesome and competitive. ''The Yellow Pages have always been perceived as a stagnant and stodgy medium,'' said Larry Small, a vice president of the Yellow Page Publishers Association, an American trade group. ''But people's shopping habits are changing. There is more catalogue shopping, more home TV shopping. If we spend all our time protecting our turf and none of our time exploring new terrain, that's short-sighted.'' The new era brought plenty of challenges, and some quick responses. Newly independent regional telephone companies began invading one another's territories, cloning local directories. Specialty Yellow Pages proliferated, aimed at Hispanics, the elderly, gay people, even weekend boaters. New gimmicks multipled, from tear-out coupons to ''audio text'' numbers that offered recorded messages with anything from sports scores to soap opera updates. Today, many publishers have retrenched, scrapping specialty directories. Yellow Pages titles in the United States, which surged from 5,800 in 1983 to 6,700 in 1986, have declined to 6,300. The most ambitious flop was the Southwestern Bell's ''Silver Pages,'' a directory for senior citizens offered in 90 cities that was dropped in 1988 after three years. The elderly, it seemed, didn't like being singled out.",1990-07-01T05:00:00+0000

But then came the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, and Mr. Fang, who believes Marxism had failed in China, was accused of being an instigator. Mr. Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, took asylum in the United States Embassy, where they lived as China's most well-known dissidents until last week, when China allowed them to take an American plane to London. A Chinese Government statement said Mr. Fang was being allowed to leave to seek medical treatment, and mentioned, as if it were news, that he and Miss Li had admitted opposing the Four Cardinal Principles of the Chinese Constitution, which include adherence to Marxism-Leninism. Most diplomats believe the United States' extension of most-favored-nation trading status to China, shortly before the release, played an important part in the negotiations.

Magnani's character, Camilla, has an ingenue's innocence and effortless charm, but she is played by a middle-aged woman who seems uncomfortably stuffed into a funny, harlequin-patterned dress. Renoir recalled in his autobiography that after spending half the night in clubs, Magnani would arrive on the set hours late, with heavy bags under her eyes, unable to remember her lines. He had to coax her into facing the cameras, but once he did, within minutes she looked younger and became Camilla: a woman who gains the love of an actor, a matador and the viceroy, only to find herself alone on stage at the end of the film.",1990-07-06T05:00:00+0000

It was the fourth time in 15 months that Christian Scientists have been convicted of manslaughter or neglect in cases where their children have died. The Twitchells, who had faced a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison, were sentenced to 10 years' probation and were ordered to take their three other children to a pediatrician for regular examinations. They are appealing the conviction. ''This has been a prosecution against our faith,'' Mr. Twitchell said after the verdict.

And four cents of the pound's rise came in the last week. John Major, Chancellor of the Exchequer, aided the rally with a speech in the House of Commons. The Chancellor said interest rates in Britain would have to remain high because of the continued rapid growth in loans, which spur spending and aggravate inflation.

In her new collection of essays, Florence King comes on - as usual - like someone with Tourette's syndrome at a diplomats' ball. At a time when what she likes to call ''caring 'n' compassion'' have sissified American public discourse, Ms. King does not believe in coddling the reader. The pages of ''Lump It or Leave It'' are splattered with the gore of sacred cultural cows: schoolteachers (''the Educationist Mafia''), the United States Constitution (''Mr. Nice Guy's hankie'') and democracy itself (''the crude leading the crud''). With the mouth of a truck driver (one given to protestations of hot flashes) and the mind of a Jesuit, she can write a mean tour de force, commuting felicitously from lit crit to historical commentary to buzzword-bashing satire to the Dixie-style memoir-comedy she patented in her splendid debut, ''Southern Ladies and Gentlemen.'' So bracing is Ms. King's oxymoronic literary persona - Republican sometime-lesbian, Hamiltonian scholarship student, cussing moralist, funny scold, anti-virginal spinster, etiquette-crazy anarchist, Southern intellectual - that I enjoyed the mildly self-serving essay on fame and her unintentionally elitist tirade against college diplomas and even the stretch of book reviews reprinted from Newsday. I got only a little nervous when she turned her reductio ad absurdum archness on school prayer (have two Protestant prayers a week, two Catholic and one Jewish) and abortion (give them routinely to rape victims). And reading her bizarrely gratuitous attack on Michael Dukakis's campaign manager, Susan Estrich, her incest-is-a-feminist-conspiracy argument and a militantly charmless reappraisal of Andrea Dworkin made me feel as if I were watching a favorite eccentric teacher turn into a nasty drunk.",1990-07-08T05:00:00+0000

us,  FICTION,"TOWARD WHAT BRIGHT GLORY? By Allen Drury. (Morrow, $22.95.) In his 17th novel, Allen Drury has set himself the task of resurrecting campus life at Stanford University in the last academic year before World War II. From the vantage point of roughly a half-century, the period seems (as Evelyn Waugh described pre-Great War Oxford) as ''lost as Lyonnesse.'' However, in ''Toward What Bright Glory?'' Mr. Drury is less than successful in finding it again - and in making the reader care about his little California community. His is a world of wet-towel-snapping fraternity brothers, dumb football players and, of course, a wise, kindly university president. Indeed, the book is a platoon-movie novel. The usual suspects rounded up by Mr. Drury include a German-American Nazi sympathizer, a nisei who wants to be treated like a nonhyphenated American, a sensitive black, a South Carolina cracker, various Betty Coed paper dolls and - last but not least - the editor of the university daily, who has just returned from a trip to Germany and wants to use his paper to awaken the community to the Nazi menace. (The editor, Tim Bates, keeps notes on his fellow students, presenting Mr. Drury with a mother lode of quick and easy descriptive passages that do not have to be woven into the plot or otherwise tax the author's creativity.) If you think the title is pretentious, try the novel's prose. Mr. Drury has done better and, one hopes, will again.",1990-07-08T05:00:00+0000

''Imagination is everything in a world going fast to the devil with realism,'' says a character in one of the playwright Sigerson Clifford's delicious tales, which first appeared in several Irish newspapers and were brought together in 1989, four years after his death. The words describe a grandfatherly storyteller who could be Clifford himself, judging from the philosophy at work in these very brief pieces, which seem to be bits of local Irish lore molded into the form of the modern short story. Each entry in ''The Red-Haired Woman: And Other Stories'' is a quick, often profound glimpse of Irish life, mostly in the countryside. The characters appear, fall into a bit of trouble and get wherever they're going without a lot of palaver. The simple plots glisten with semiprecious gems of language. In ''The Go-Getter,'' for example, an immigrant returning from America tells us that the Irish hills ''had clean faces with every tooth of rock scrubbed until it shone like a shilling. There was so much blue in the sky it seemed as though the sky had fallen'' - a reflection not only of the landscape but of the legendary fear of the ancient Celts that the heavens would collapse. In other stories, the fears of modern Celts are also described. The mood of these characters is often suggested by the weather (''a cold night for January, with frost polishing the stars as we huddle closer to the Corner away from the teeth of the wind'') or by the look of their homes (''a small, thatched, tramp's hat of a house, limewashed a dirty white, with one tiny window like a mouse's eye peering at the passing world''). The most haunting story is that of a retired schoolmaster who recalls, with a smile, a student essay in its entirety: ''I went for a walk yesterday evening around by Mulvey's Mill. I saw nobody and nobody saw me.'' A few days later, he goes out for a walk on Christmas Eve, unobserved and alone.",1990-07-08T05:00:00+0000

us,  FICTION,"FURORS DIE. By William Hoffman. (Louisiana State University, $18.95.) William Hoffman's 10th novel is an ambitious, well-written book. Its great theme is that the believer, the person of conscience and religious faith, is destined for destruction in our dissolute culture. Amos (Pinky) Cody is the son of a poor, alcoholic father and a mother who appears to be a religious fanatic. As a teen-ager, he witnesses the prevention of his father's arrest for public drunkenness. Vowing to work for the man who intervened, one Mr. DuVal, Pinky insinuates himself into a position performing odd jobs at DuVal's office, thus setting himself on a collision course with the boss's son, Wylie. Set in the coal country of West Virginia, ''Furors Die'' traces the lives of Pinky and Wylie through their teen-age and college years, and on into adulthood, marriage and careers. Predictably, the spoiled, privileged Wylie is nonchalant about everything from tennis to sexuality. Indeed, the major flaw in this novel may be that Wylie, who has no deep inner conflict or drive, is placed at its center. Pinky, his antagonist, is the sufferer and the tragic figure, the poor-boy-become-capitalist who is ultimately corrupted. The antithesis of Wylie, Pinky is distorted by greed and his envy of and admiration for the well-bred rich. Yet Mr. Hoffman stands back from Pinky, even occasionally satirizing him for his social and sexual ignorance. Despite its flaws, ''Furors Die'' is a quickly paced, well-plotted work that links individual moral corruption with larger concerns like social justice and environmentalism. It entertains while offering insight into some of the most important issues of our time.",1990-07-08T05:00:00+0000

Carl Lewis, the track and field superstar who has won six Olympic gold medals, is one of the world's greatest athletes. In his autobiography, ''Inside Track,'' Mr. Lewis focuses not on his athletic prowess but on the reasons why he has been unable to cash in on his celebrity. Here is a man who could have been the cover boy for Wheaties - he has been ''the world's fastest human'' for close to a decade and has won 62 straight long-jump competitions since 1981. And Mr. Lewis, only 28 years old, could well add to his Olympic booty in 1992. But while he makes a handsome living, Mr. Lewis writes that he does not have any major endorsements from American companies. For someone who says one of the first things he told his college coach was ''I want to be a millionaire,'' this has not made for a happy camper. Mr. Lewis blames the news media for casting him in a negative light. He also blames the Athletics Congress, the organization that governs track and field in the United States, for mishandling the sport in general, and specifically for attempting to undermine his commercial opportunities because of a longstanding feud between the organization and Mr. Lewis's racing team, the Santa Monica Track Club. Mr. Lewis makes many valid points and is particularly hard-hitting in his documentation of abuses in college recruiting and his criticisms of the Athletics Congress. However, he seems unnecessarily harsh on his rivals, such as the sprinter Ben Johnson and the long jumper Larry Myricks, and he uses ''Inside Track'' to take swipes at what amounts to an enemies list of just about anyone who has ever crossed him on or off the track. Written with the Pulitzer Prize-winning sportswriter Jeffrey Marx, ''Inside Track'' provides a revealing look at the underbelly of international track and field, but misses a precious opportunity to dissect Mr. Lewis's remarkable athletic talents and show the kind of grace and humility that might make him more endearing to corporate America.",1990-07-15T05:00:00+0000

When it is pointed out to Elinor, the central character in the British writer Penelope Farmer's third novel for adults, that she is letting her feelings run away with her, she rails against the notion that people ought to have a sense of humor, a belief that she equates with not taking oneself seriously. In this collection of 10 chronological episodes, each set in a different locale, Elinor does indeed take herself seriously. The novel begins with her shatteringly lonely stay as a young student in a dismal pension in Munich, then moves to a disappointingly rain-soaked honeymoon in a broken-down tower in France and, as the years pass, on through an unrelieved succession of bad weather and dingy accommodations in places as far-ranging as India, Israel and Spain. But no matter where she is, Elinor's serious preoccupation with her unhappiness is a constant companion. What flashes of irony and humor there are in the book are curiously neutralized. In one chapter, for instance, Elinor finds herself on a kibbutz with her ''oversize, noisy'' lover from Brooklyn, an intellectual who, in searching for his Jewish identity, develops a passion for farming: ''Instead of going on about Norman Mailer and Allen Ginsberg, he told her more than she thought she wanted to know about turkeys.'' But irony needs distance, and even in this unlikely situation Elinor never releases her grip on angst but instead internalizes, in great detail, her sense of dislocation. The narrative structure of ''Away From Home'' is an interesting one, and it is clear that Ms. Farmer has a subtle and expressive command of language. But some perspective and, yes, some humor would have given this book a few more dimensions.",1990-07-15T05:00:00+0000

Since the 1850's, when all-rag paper became prohibitively expensive, printing has been done on wood-pulp paper. But alum, a component in that paper, reacts with atmospheric moisture to form an acid that dissolves the wood fibers: books become discolored and brittle. A new process, developed by Akzo Chemical Inc. of Chicago and the 16-million-volume Library of Congress, may help. Books are first put into an airtight chamber where a vacuum draws out moisture. Next, diethyl zinc, a highly reactive gas, is piped into the chamber under modest pressure to neutralize acid, then removed. The entire computer-controlled treatment takes 60 hours. ''The process leaves books with an alkyline reserve which also protects them from acids in the air,'' said Richard F. Miller, Akzo's project director.",1990-07-15T05:00:00+0000

us,  After Everything Came to Nothing,"A LOT TO MAKE UP FOR. By John Buell. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $18.95.) ''Strange that living should be so difficult,'' muses Stan Hagan, one of the three central characters in this quiet, sad, yet hopeful novel of people struggling to restore meaning and purpose to their lives. Stan, a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, comes to the small Canadian town of Ashton in search of Del Symons, a young woman he mistreated during the time of their mutual enslavement to ''pleasures now joyless that they couldn't stop pursuing.'' He is befriended by Martin Lacey, a retired farmer convalescing from a heart attack, who gives him room and board in return for his help in the small vegetable garden that Martin can no longer maintain alone. Stan and Martin are drawn together by their shared experience of ''having everything come to nothing,'' of finding that even the simplest routines have become acts of will, self-created bulwarks against a sense of isolation and futility that threatens to engulf them. Del, too, needs all her emotional resources just to get through each day. She's straight now, but her infant daughter was born addicted. Del, who cleans houses to support her child, has ''no dreams for the future, it was all she could do to live in the present.'' John Buell, the author of four earlier novels, writes with clarity and exactness of damaged lives and the strength that is needed to repair them. Because Mr. Buell refuses to dress up his characters' all too common problems in flashy literary clothes, ''A Lot to Make Up For'' may strike some readers as drab. Those who look more closely, however, will find a homely lyricism and a deep understanding of human nature that are far more satisfying than verbal pyrotechnics.",1990-07-15T05:00:00+0000

us,  FICTION,"BEN. By Max Schott. (North Point, $17.95.) '' 'Mom has a tumor in her brain. It's growing,' I said, brightly. To have a tumor in your brain - like a ship in a bottle - would be novelty enough alone, but to have one growing was nearly a miracle.'' Max, the young boy who narrates this novel by the author of ''Murphy's Romance,'' is naive enough to be fascinated and hopeful about desperate situations, yet he is honest and real enough that the reader never tires of him. At this time of family crisis, Max becomes fascinated with the title character, Ben Webber, a stablehand who works near Max's home in the California ranch country - and has troubles of his own. Chief among these is his wife, Audrey, a younger woman who keeps running off to do trick riding on the rodeo circuit. As the novel progresses, Max and Ben develop a close, though still oddly distant, relationship. When, for example, Max's mother dies and his father decides to marry her sister, Ben is sympathetic to the boy. ''Just because it's good for your dad and Anna,'' Ben tells Max, ''doesn't mean it's good to you.'' Throughout ''Ben,'' Max Schott flirts with the sentimental, but ultimately his characters' dignity saves them, from sentiment and worse. (Even when he's drunk and vomiting, notes Max, Ben ''did it all neatly, like a man who knew how.'') Finally, though, it is Audrey, the malcontent wife, who faces life with the most horse sense. If she loses her footing while balancing on two horses, she just drops ''down onto the back of one horse, before it's too late.'' And if it's too late? ''You just fall off,'' she says blithely, ''between the horses sometimes. They try not to step on you - they don't like squishy things under their feet.''",1990-07-15T05:00:00+0000

''It reminds me of some bad Turkish cigarettes I used to smoke.'' Yet for more than 25 years there was perhaps no better word to describe him as he helped run Hollywood and dictate the cinematic tastes of the American public. Warner (1892-1978), a onetime grocer who grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, was one of the four brothers who formed and shaped the Warner Brothers studios. Bob Thomas's new biography, ''Clown Prince of Hollywood,'' is a nimble, readable study of a man who, despite signal achievements in the early days of modern motion pictures, was often viewed as a frustrated comedian who desperately wanted to make people laugh. All Warner did was to revolutionize the modern movie: in 1927 he produced ''The Jazz Singer,'' the first talkie, and through the 1930's and 40's he played a role in selecting the actors and stories that would become ''A Star Is Born,'' ''Casablanca'' and other film classics bearing the Warner Brothers logo. Mr. Thomas, the longtime Hollywood correspondent for the Associated Press, peels back the wisecracking public persona to give us a glimpse at a complex man: the notoriously stingy tipper, the multimillionaire with torn underwear, the man of volatile passions (professional and otherwise). But Mr. Thomas has not written a warts-and-all biography. He offers insights into Warner's creative mind - with a workmanlike background on the genesis of Warner Brothers - and does so with language that is muscular and witty.",1990-07-15T05:00:00+0000

As he announced last week that next year would be his last as president, the 63-year-old administrator was widely praised for his role in nearly doubling N.Y.U.'s endowment from $287.3 million to $540 million while transforming the school into a major research institution.

The sentencing last week capped a slide from baseball grace that began more than a year ago when, as manager of the Cincinnati Reds, he was accused of betting on baseball games. He was subsequently banned from baseball for life. Then the Internal Revenue Service investigated him and found that Rose had failed to declare earnings of nearly $346,000 from card shows, personal appearances and the sale of baseball memorabilia. As part of his plea bargain, Rose will also spend three months in a halfway house and 1,000 hours in community service. Contrite, he said, ''I accept my punishment.''",1990-07-22T05:00:00+0000

She was one of the first to juxtapose areas of plain weave with areas of unwoven warp, to incorporate knots, braids, shells and feathers into her pieces and to create weavings intended to be hung away from a wall, adding a sculptural dimension to what traditionally had been a flat art. However, Ms. Tawney's works have won her little acclaim, apart from a small, ardent following. LENORE TAWNEY: A Retrospective (American Craft Museum/Rizzoli, $45), edited by Kathleen Nugent Mangan, an independent curator, is an unusually handsome catalogue published in conjunction with an exhibition at the American Craft Museum.

Not necessarily: roughly 15 years passed between the departure of the New York City Police Department from its old headquarters at 240 Centre Street in Manhattan and that building's reopening last year as a strikingly elegant cooperative apartment building; an even longer period elapsed between the abandonment of the old Association Residence, a Victorian Gothic landmark on Amsterdam Avenue at 103d Street, and its reopening this past spring as the largest youth hostel in North America. And it was almost a decade between the time architects were hired to restore Borough Hall in Brooklyn and the completion of that work last year.

The coin toss came after months of courtroom haggling and several recounts found that Ms. Mulligan, a paralegal and political unknown, got the same number of votes as the incumbent, Penny Pullen, who has represented the wealthy suburban Chicago district for 14 years. The race attracted unusual attention because of the candidates' diametrically opposite views on abortion rights: Ms. Mulligan is for, Miss Pullen is against.

Every baseball umpire dons a mask to work behind home plate, but the former National League umpire Dave Pallone wore one off the field as well. The reason, Mr. Pallone reveals in his emotional memoir, written with the freelance writer Alan Steinberg, is that he is gay. Fearing that prejudice might cost him his job, Mr. Pallone kept his homosexuality secret from all but a few close friends throughout his 10-year career in the major leagues. But discrimination killed his career anyway, he asserts, as a result of false allegations about his involvement in a teen-age homosexual sex ring. The fact that he was forced to resign even after being cleared of all charges leads Mr. Pallone to assert in ''Behind the Mask'' that organized baseball itself is guilty of leading a double life. ''Publicly, it pretended to be inclusive and fair, but it was close-minded and biased behind its mask.'' Mr. Pallone also details the other controversies that characterized his career. Because he got his job by agreeing to be a scab during the 1979 umpires' strike, Mr. Pallone was ostracized by most of his colleagues from his first game to the last. He also received unwanted notoriety for the 1988 shoving incident with Pete Rose, in which the former Cincinnati Reds manager was suspended for 30 days after pushing Mr. Pallone while arguing a close call. Hot-tempered and tough, Mr. Pallone is not always easy to like, but he argues his case cogently. ''If you're gay, think about removing your mask,'' he concludes. ''Because unless more of us do that, the back-room politics of prejudice will continue to destroy productive careers and lives.''",1990-07-22T05:00:00+0000

In the early morning hours of March 31, 1980, someone killed Kathleen Graham with a sledgehammer in her Shreveport, La., home. Her husband, who was in the bedroom with her at the time, displayed no emotion over his wife's murder. Lewis Graham never cried, cursed or became hysterical. Although he said a minor injury left him unconscious during the killing, Mr. Graham spoke freely and calmly with police, hoping they would find the intruders he said killed his wife. However, the husband instantly became the only suspect, reports Craig A. Lewis in ''Blood Evidence.'' Apparently blame focused strongly on Mr. Graham not because of motive or evidence, but because of personality: people simply could not believe an innocent man could possibly remain so outwardly composed (Mr. Graham, for example, wanted the house cleaned up immediately so the family could return home). Much was made in the trial about his self-containment, writes Mr. Lewis. ''The prosecution and defense disagreed on whether Lewis Graham was a killer or a victim, but they had to agree that his reactions to the murder were unusual.'' Mr. Graham, who was convicted of second-degree murder, has been in prison for almost 10 years now, never wavering in his story. The prosecution had a case, of course, primarily bloodstains and other circumstantial evidence. But what really convicted him, Mr. Lewis contends, was Mr. Graham's demeanor. Whether that conviction is just remains unconvincing to the reader. Mr. Lewis expanded this book from a 25-part series he wrote for The Shreveport Journal. He has clearly done his homework here, but leaves the reader with the frustrating feeling that the murder is still a mystery.",1990-07-22T05:00:00+0000

''Trial by Jury'' is to litigation what sportswriting is to playing ball. It is a collection of articles, originally published in The American Lawyer, about 17 celebrated lawsuits of the 1980's. (Seven articles are written by Steven Brill, the magazine's founder and editor in chief.) Prominent are scene-by-scene analyses of courtroom tactics, post-trial juror interviews and lawyerly gossip about backstage deal making and judgment calls. This is solid reporting. And there is a good selection of interesting, important cases: Beech-Nut's unsuccessful defense against Federal charges of having sold flavored water as apple juice, Beulah Mae Donald's suit against the Klansmen who killed her son and the suit by Rose Cipollone's heirs against the Liggett Group, which had manufactured the cigarettes she smoked. Unfortunately, other pieces rehash old topics: Westmoreland v. CBS, Ariel Sharon v. Time, Pennzoil v. Texaco and Abscam. One also misses an editor's hand. These articles have not been revised, merely reprinted. There is no index. Lawyers' gambits and jurors' conflicts do not explain every verdict. One needs a context - a concern with the legal doctrines, institutions and problems around which courtroom dramas play out. Lacking this, too much of ''Trial by Jury'' is simply stale news.",1990-07-22T05:00:00+0000

For 40 years he and the organization he leads, the South African Communist Party, were outlawed. But in February the ban was lifted and last week Mr. Slovo came so far out of hiding that he appeared on a popular radio call-in program in Johannesburg. ''I think that it's a sickness of our society that when a white is associated with blacks, that he must be the mastermind,'' he told his listeners. With the Soviet empire crumbling, Mr. Slovo said he held fast to his Communist ideals. His wife, Ruth First, was killed in Mozambique in 1982 in a bombing believed to be the work of South African security forces. The couple's fight against apartheid was the basis for ''A World Apart,'' a popular film written by Mr. Slovo's daughter.

Gloriously situated at the north end of Trafalgar Square, it is the sanctuary of a specific sensibility and the stronghold for 150 years of a heroic view of art. Toward that sanctuary and that stronghold, protective feelings run hot. Right now, the National Gallery is in fine shape, thanks in part to American intervention. Late next spring, the new Sainsbury Wing, designed by the Philadelphia architectural firm of Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown is due to be opened by the Queen. Several years ago, an American art enthusiast, John Paul Getty Jr., gave the gallery a $50 million???? pound sum for acquisitions. The French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist rooms are being given a long-overdue rehabilitation by Walter H. Annenberg, former Ambassador to the Court of St. James, who gave $5 million for the purpose.

And nowhere does that natural beauty and spirit better exist than in Glacier National Park, a one-million-acre pocket of purity tucked into the northwest corner hard by Canada. Glacier's awe-inspiring alpine vistas are easy to get to but hard to forget. The severity of its mountain geography and its location, slightly off the usual over-traveled Western park trek, have in a wonderfully quiet way helped preserve Glacier from the hordes of Winnebagos, trailers and over-burdened station wagons that clog the roadways at places like Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons. Because of weather conditions, the upper reaches of the park usually do not open until June and the lower portions in April, but now is the time to plan a visit, since accommodations are limited and reservations often necessary.",1990-07-22T05:00:00+0000

In this account of her struggles with self-imposed solitude, the essayist Alice Koller discloses her most intimate secrets with startling nonchalance. She can get away with this because she stands as far away from us as possible and because her voice is strong and carries, not only from the New England and Virginia country houses where she has spent the past 28 years, but from the place just beyond the pale of human contact where she lives. With her three German shepherds for companionship, Ms. Koller has been stalking the stark American landscape Henry David Thoreau called ''the vantage ground of . . . voluntary poverty,'' where she leads the examined life. Utopia always looks great from a distance, and Ms. Koller draws us into hers with sentences as brooding and hushed as the hours before dawn in which she writes. The problem with utopia, of course, is that once you get there, there is not much to do. Ms. Koller's exemplary life provides a wealth of instructive anecdote - books she has written, houses she has rescued from disrepair, dogs she has nursed - but seems, ultimately, rather limited. And while each of ''The Stations of Solitude'' (designated by chapter headings like ''Moneying'' and ''Singling'') offers a beguiling rest stop on the road to self-knowledge, Ms. Koller lingers longer than she should on a rehash of the events that led up to her hermitic existence. Her main obstacle to contentment is apparently the doctorate in philosophy she earned from Harvard University but never put to use in a permanent academic post. This book's uneven tone calls to mind the patter of a brilliant but eccentric performer: it enthralls one minute and gets querulous the next.",1990-07-22T05:00:00+0000

Though he was released under conditions that included a stipulation that he renounce terrorism, Dr. Bosch hardly seemed repentent. He called the agreement ''a farce,'' adding, ''They purchased the chain but they don't have the monkey.'' What brought about his release?

us,Design;   A Soft Touch,"The sequence of pale rooms is devoid of pattern and color. The architectural details are subtle and correct. In each room, antiques are placed sparingly. The look is slightly unfinished - a brand of romantic modernism that is the unmistakable signature of Boston-based designer William Hodgins. In many ways, the style recalls the work of two great designers from earlier in this century: Billy Baldwin and Syrie Maugham. Like Maugham, Hodgins is a leading proponent of the colorless room, and like Baldwin, his interiors are at once tailored and highly personal. Hodgins dismisses such comparisons, however, preferring to discuss the new apartment in its architectual context. His two-bedroom home, in the Hotel Agassiz, an 1872 building that was one of the first apartment houses in Boston, has views of Commonwealth Avenue. Indeed, the setting is right out of a Henry James novel. The decorating is not. All the rooms have an open, airy feeling. But when the designer first found the space, it had been substantially modernized, stripped of its period details and arranged so that rooms were not properly oriented to take advantage of the windows. Hodgins moved walls, replaced mantels and added moldings, inventing the architecture he imagined the house once had. He installed dentil moldings throughout the apartment, except in the living room, which had higher ceilings. ''In this taller room, the moldings looked skimpy,'' Hodgins says. So he hired Robert Jackson, a trompe loiel artist, to paint the same style molding, only an inch and a half deeper.",1990-07-22T05:00:00+0000

From the moment this first novel opens, one has the impression of having fallen into the clutches of a natural storyteller, a writer whose love object, in the end, is the city of Paris - Paris in summer, to be precise, sweltering and sinister, ravished by pleasure-hungry visitors and busloads of tourists who move through the streets ''like sharks through a sunken city.'' It's an appropriately decadent setting for the tale that the narrator, a Wall Streeter-turned-gigolo named Francis Buchanan, unfolds in a voice as smooth and dry as a glass of Montrachet. Rich, sexually restless women are his prey, the suites of the luxurious Hotel Meurillon his territory, all described with a tough, mesmerizing cynicism. When Francis becomes entangled with Emma Cullington, a beautiful, drug-addicted Texas heiress, the narrative of ''An Available Man'' assumes a distinctly purgatorial cast, as the liaison dangereuse moves from the drug dens of the Left Bank to the treacherous cantinas of Houston. That Patric Kuh has a gift for conveying a spirit of place, however sordid the atmosphere, is undeniable. It is only in portraying the novel's uniformly cold, sexually rapacious women that he disappoints - particularly with Emma. The essence of Francis' obsession with her never seems quite compelling, nor is there sufficient motivation for Emma's bent for self-destruction. There are too many moments, as well, when the minutiae of her sleazy, junkie-dominated world, however morbidly fascinating at first, simply become tiresome. Ultimately, Mr. Kuh's most bewitching and sensual female ''character'' is Paris itself - a city the author clearly knows well, and whose beauty and unsavory aspects he succeeds equally well in evoking.",1990-07-29T05:00:00+0000

Rather than dragging the director into the present with its compelling relevance, this production assumes newness as a virtue in itself and then searches for ways to justify it. Here Handel's rendering of an epical purveyor of war has had its purely political nature separated out and freeze-dried.

An immigration official jostled him and Yonkel slugged the man and swore at him in a Russian-Texan drawl. When it was discovered that this strange cowboy was a United States citizen who had fought in the Civil War, Yonkel was readmitted into the country. The first Jewish Texan was one of the conquistadors, Gaspar Castano de Sosa, who set foot in the Lone Star State in 1590. Eight Jews fought at the Alamo, and when Texas joined the Union in 1845, its first Congressman was David Kaufman, a Jewish graduate of Princeton University. These and other funny and fascinating anecdotes are relayed by Natalie Ornish in PIONEER JEWISH TEXANS: Their Impact on Texas and American History for Four Hundred Years, 1590-1990 (Texas Heritage Press, P.O. Box 12765, Dallas, Tex. 75225, $39.95).

us,  Ghosts Must Catch The Spirit of the Time,"Every age gets the ghostly lovers it needs. At a decisive point in the 1947 film ''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,'' the audience finds itself hoping that Gene Tierney will break her engagement to George Sanders - she's the last to know he's a cad - and run into Rex Harrison's arms. Now, it's true that the sea captain Harrison plays is a ghost, so technically he has no arms. Only the young, beautiful, widowed Mrs. Muir can see or hear him. His disembodied state would put a terrible crimp in their social life, and delicacy prevents even mentioning something so impossible as their sex life. To root for the captain is to wish that a young woman chooses death over life. Why do we feel certain that this ghostly lover is the only man who can make her happy? A literal reading of the movie suggests the triumph of spiritual love over time, space and physical desire. Save that one for chivalric romances. We root for the ghost because he is Rex Harrison, handsome, deep-voiced and in his prime. On screen he is so strong a physical presence that Sanders seems like a wimp beside him, real or not. Harrison does no ghostly fadeaways, never walks through walls and only once scares off some unwanted guests. ''I am real,'' the seductive, bearded sea captain tells Mrs. Muir. ''I'm here because you believe I'm here.'' But this romantic moment does not make us believe in spirits. Instead, at some unconscious level, Harrison makes us suspect that when we're not looking, he and Mrs. Muir manage to overcome their apparent physical problems, and that being escorted to dinner parties by an invisible partner would be a small price for Mrs. Muir to pay. It is an extreme disappointment when the ghost leaves Mrs. Muir for her own good; doesn't he understand his power?",1990-07-29T05:00:00+0000

Coal-mine collapses and oil spills are front-page stories; the world of nuclear weapons and power plants, writes John May, exists in secrecy. ''The Greenpeace Book of the Nuclear Age'' seeks to provide a compendium of 45 years of bad news. Mr. May, the editorial director of Greenpeace Books, describes how the Nuclear Regulatory Commission evaluates mishaps at civilian reactors. In 1982, for example, there were 4,500 accidents at the 81 operating nuclear plants in the United States, but only 253 were considered particularly significant - and more than a quarter of the total were attributed to human error. This book includes not only the undisputed facts but the maybes. Mr. May discusses, for example, the high incidence of cancer among the cast members of ''The Conqueror,'' the 1954 John Wayne movie filmed in the Utah desert only 137 miles from the military's Nevada nuclear test site. Tendentious and frankly alarmist, ''The Greenpeace Book of the Nuclear Age'' may not be the last word in the nuclear debate, but it is a useful reminder that nuclear power is hardly an unmixed blessing.",1990-07-29T05:00:00+0000

It is to James Trager's credit that his detailed account of New York's plushest street breathes more life into the thoroughfare than is visible to the naked eye. There are several Park Avenues in addition to the rich residential one. There is the poor residential Park Avenue, the one of the barrio, up where the railroad tracks emerge from underground. There is the glassy Park Avenue of pretentious office buildings in the north 40's and the 50's. And there is an older, still more or less quiet Park Avenue south of Grand Central Terminal - which is, of course, the stunning centerpiece of the entire street. Farther downtown there is Park Avenue South, which is less lordly, and finally there are the half-dozen blocks of Fourth Avenue, which was Park's original name before it moved into more affluent circles. Like so many New York streets, Park Avenue represents change and various generations of architecture. Why, asks Mr. Trager, does Fifth Avenue have so many more big, ugly, modern apartment houses than Park Avenue has? He explains that Park Avenue, which had its beginnings as a railroad street, received its apartment houses during the early decades of the century, when building standards were high. When the Fifth Avenue mansions gave way to new builders after World War II, their replacements conformed to new architecture. Mr. Trager, the author of ''West of Fifth: The Rise and Fall of Manhattan's West Side,'' has studded his book with anecdotes about the great financiers, writers and society figures who have lived on Park Avenue. He appends a house-by-house chronological list of current Park Avenue buildings. There is no bus line on poshest Park Avenue and its relatively unpeopled sidewalks are far from chummy, but Mr. Trager takes the reader on an illuminating trip worthy of the carriage trade.",1990-07-29T05:00:00+0000

She liked her shoes polished and her shirts neatly done by the Chinese laundry around the corner. She had camped out before, but not anything hard-core, not anything like this. This was a four-month trek that began in London and wended its way through Central Europe and on to the Middle East. This meant extensive cohabitation with 20 strangers and no showers and certainly no Chinese laundries. But Strasberg coped. Her pivotal, pre-journey purchase was an orange DKNY parka, which doubled as a pillow throughout most of the trip. (Little did she know that parkas were hitting celebratory status on European runways; see pages 36 and 37.) ''I didn't want to look too goofy, and I didn't want to look 'regulation camping,' '' Strasberg says, ''but I needed something that would make the transition from Syria to the streets of Rome.''
