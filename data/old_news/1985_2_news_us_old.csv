In recent years, as modernism has lost much of its authority, the work of sculptors who started out with one foot in Minimalism, such as Joel Shapiro and Alain Kirili, has included increasingly direct references to the human figure. If their work is seen alongside some of the 1980's work of Nancy Graves, Bryan Hunt and John Duff, it is clear that a sculptural momentum toward the human figure has been building.",1985-02-01T05:00:00+0000

He started out as a painter, and the high-key fantasies he produced - combining abstract with figurative elements - look very much at home in the context of today's neo-Expressionism. The work, so out of sync with Smithson's Minimal image, has been buried since a 1961 presentation of it at the Galleria George Lester in Rome. But now's the time, if ever. And at the Diane Brown Gallery, 100 Greene Street (through March 2), the first full presentation in this country of his pre- Minimal painting from 1959 to 1962, we see his poetic imagination in riotus bloom. Even as a teen-ager, Peter Halley reports in a catalogue essay, Smithson had tuned into Abstract Expressionism, and was also responsive to Dubuffet. We have no trouble discerning that in the painting ''Purgatory,'' in which a heavy, erratic grid on a white ground reveals through its openings fierce, crudely drawn faces and toothy mouths, a la de Kooning and Dubuffet. But, young, restless and a closet romantic, he took cues from everywhere. Pursuing further the mythic element in Abstract Expressionism, he looked into such European movements as Surrealism and Symbolism. An interest in Catholicism led him to the primitive mysticism of Byzantine painting. From Rome, which he visited in 1961, he got a concept of religion as theater, and William Burroughs's ''Naked Lunch'' acquainted him with the ''savagery'' of Pre-Columbian art.",1985-02-01T05:00:00+0000

What Harrigan is doing, of course, is launching a revolution that would lead to the modern Broadway musical as we now know it. Or as we usually know it.

GOLF CLUB EMBROILED IN BUILDER'S ZONING FIGHT,"To an outsider, the fight to save the Hauppauge Country Club suggests a football game in which both sides wear the same color jerseys and run for the same goal posts: Everyone wants to save the club, but no one can agree how it is to be done. On one team is a developers group, the Holiday Organization, which entered into a contract to buy the 25-year-old golf course here in 1983 for $9 million. Last June, a principal in the Westbury, L.I., Company, Gerald Monter, filed a request with the Smithtown Planning Department, which has jurisdiction over Hauppauge, asking that the 135 acres of the course be rezoned to allow the construction of condominiums. Mr. Monter, a 63-year-old former high school shop teacher, argues that the only way to preserve the private golf course, which he says loses money each year, is by building on it. He proposed the construction of 300 condominium units (later reduced to 203 units) clustered on 50 acres around the club's fairways. The $45 million project would be marketed as a ''golf course community.'' Alternately, Mr. Monter said, if he were denied the rezoning he would destroy the course and build 203 single- family homes spread out across the full 135 acres. The latter option would require only minimal approval from the local authorities, since the current zoning, written many years ago, allows that level of density. Thus were the lines blurred. If local residents, many of whom opposed the development at the club, won their fight to keep the land from being rezoned, they might lose the club entirely.",1985-02-01T05:00:00+0000

He started out as a painter, and the high-key fantasies he produced - combining abstract with figurative elements - look very much at home in the context of today's neo-Expressionism. The work, so out of sync with Smithson's Minimal image, has been buried since a 1961 presentation of it at the Galleria George Lester in Rome. But now's the time, if ever.

His series of operas on the plays of Goldoni (he also drew on Moli ere, Perrault and Shakespeare) comprise what is very probably the most distinguished body of works in the opera buffa tradition after Donizetti's.",1985-02-03T05:00:00+0000

Cohen.   222 pp. New York:   Oxford UniversityPress. $17.95,"BEST known by his pathbreaking biography of Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin, Stephen Cohen is one of the outstanding figures in the generation of ''Sovietologists'' who first made their mark in the 1970's. In part because of their frequent visits to the Soviet Union, scholars of this generation combine a sharply critical view of the Soviet political system with a sense of respect and even kinship for Russians they know - not a few of whom are intellectual dissidents. While fully aware of the limited influence of these acquaintances on Soviet politics, the new Sovietologists are apt to be impressed by the dissidents' picture of Soviet society and history. Having come to know a post- Stalinist and postrevolutionary Russia that differs in many ways from the ''totalitarian model'' used by the older generation of Western Sovietologists, it is not surprising that one of them should ask whether or not the time has come to sketch out an alternative view of Soviet history. This is what Stephen Cohen, a professor of Soviet politics and history at Princeton University, has undertaken in ''Rethinking the Soviet Experience.''",1985-02-03T05:00:00+0000

The Golden State Warriors came into their game against the Knicks with the league's worst record (10-35) and a string of 16 consecutive losses, one short of a club record. But playing before 9,321 fans in their home arena, the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, the Warriors won, 114-98, extending to 15 the Knicks' club-record road losing streak. The outcome was actually decided when the Warriors hit their first 13 shots of the second period to turn a close game into a rout. They outscored the Knicks, 33-5, over a span of about 8 minutes to build a 28-point margin, 62-34, that was never seriously challenged. The Knicks, who dropped their third straight game over all, fell to 17-31. They were led by Pat Cummings, who had 27 points. Bernard King, back for his second game after missing eight games with a sprained ankle, added 23 points but did not play in the final period. For the Warriors, Eric (Sleepy) Floyd was most productive, scoring 26 points, mostly on some stellar outside shooting.

These Victorian buildings, white giants with peaked roofs and sprawling porches, were sized to their setting: the Mount Washington Valley, which lies at the foot of the Northeast's highest mountain (6,288 feet), and at the edge of the timberland that is now the White Mountain National Forest. In the winter the hotels' horse-drawn sleds would meet guests at the Glen railroad station, south of Jackson (the station is now occupied by a ski club), and from there would take them off to snowshoe, to climb and, starting in the 1930's, to careen down the snowy hillsides on wooden slats.",1985-02-03T05:00:00+0000

An exhibition, ''Fabled Cloth: Batik From Java's North Coast,'' which opened recently at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, brings together some 50 examples spanning that period of excellence. Nearly all of the fabrics, which are about 3 feet wide and 7 or 8 feet long, were used as sarongs, worn by women, or as the larger kain panjang, worn by men.

us,  THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF STEAM GRATES,"On the Ellipse, a large grassy area just south of the White House, a man slept on a grating as a cold rain gave everything a thin glazing of ice. The man was so bundled against the cold that little of his features could be seen within the tiny puff of steam that rose from the grating. It was midday, and the man was sleeping. He finally moved, his hand rising to his face, and the only thing identifiable about him was that he was white. In this city, with its predominately black population, most street people seen in the downtown area are whites. Why? Marie Nahikian, chairman of a local group, the Coalition for the Homeless, says one explanation may be that Washington's blacks are more willing to care for their poor than the considerably more affluent whites. ''There are black homeless people,'' Miss Nahikian said, ''but the black community does take care of its own. There are two Washingtons - the local Washington and the Federal Washington. In the local Washington, it is possible that blacks in the local community tend to double up more than whites.'' By some estimates, Washington has as many as 15,000 homeless of all races. Other cities, such as New York, probably have more. But in Washington, the homeless who occupy doorways and gratings in the shadow of the nation's greatest public buildings are a particularly poignant sight. A hundred yards or so from the man on the Ellipse, four men had set up an encampment on 18th Street near Constitution Avenue, across from the headquarters of the Daughters of the American Revolution.",1985-02-07T05:00:00+0000

CORRIGAN, a 25-year-old Carmel resident, says he blew the whistle on Indian Point and that that was what got him dismissed as a security officer there two years ago. His ''crusade,'' as he calls it, led him to criticize nuclear-plant safety at a public hearing in July 1982, while employed at the Indian Point 3 nuclear facility in Buchanan. For that, he says, his superiors called him on the carpet and subsequently dismissed him. Since then, he has written to Prisident Reagan and to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about his case and has initiated a suit in State Supreme Court in Putnam County for damages against his former employer and two plant unions - Local 1- of the Utility Workers of America and the Nuclear Security Officers Benevolent Association - claiming that they disregarded his rights and that the unions had failed to institute grievances on his behalf. No hearing date has been set. The former employee, the New York Power Authority, says Mr. Corrigan was dismissed on Jan. 10, 1983, for not showing up for work on three occasions, not because of his views on security matters. Mr. Corrigan, who charges that the authority's case was ''manufactured against me to have me removed,'' compares himself to Karen Silkwood, the plutonium-plant critic who was killed in a mysterious car accident in Oklahoma in 1974.",1985-02-10T05:00:00+0000

If Jiri Valenta is coordinator of Soviet and Eastern European studies at the United States Naval Post-Graduate School. it fails to do so, it may miss a critical opportunity to use the contras to exploit tactical differences between Moscow and Havana. Nicaragua's international connections are a consequence of the way it consolidated its revolution following Eastern European and Cuban models. The Nicaraguan leadership began by creating a classic Leninist ''vanguard party'' - the Sandinista front - to coerce and indoctrinate the people. By now, the revolution is in its second phase, characterized by increasing bureaucratization and the formation of a ''new class'' - the Sandinista leaders and their wives and mistresses - that is as privileged and corrupt as the displaced pre- revolutionary elite. Consolidation of power on the home front has been accompanied by increasing support for guerrilla movements in neighboring nations and growing military ties with Moscow. The Nicaraguans claim that they no longer provide material support for the Salvadoran guerrillas, but, as one Sandinista official confessed to me, ideology dictates that the revolution spread through the region; otherwise it will perish.

Historically, they climb at a ratio of about 1.85-to-1 relative to the market as a whole, says Perrin H. Long Jr., an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services. That makes brokerage stocks an attractive investment in a rally, Mr. Long said.

Others expected thoughtful or inspiring words from John Paul during a stop in El Guasmo, a shantytown slum on the edge of the Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil. But Mr. Ortiz and Mrs. Hernandez expected nothing short of a miracle. ''Things change in every country he visits,'' Mr. Ortiz said with conviction, adding that no one could ignore the Pope's appeals on behalf of the poor. Mrs. Hernandez was sure of change ''because I have faith in him.'' Such was the responsibility that John Paul carried as he addressed millions of people in Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago. As the head of a church that is governed from Europe, the Pontiff oversees an organization that is strongest in the third world and, by the year 2000, will have a majority of its membership in Latin America. Moreover, it is in Latin America where, from the Vatican's point of view, some of the most troublesome movements within Catholicism have taken root. Most notable among these is the theology of liberation, which sees a special responsibility for the church to lift up the poor, and often advocates radical politics as the way to do it. Yet at the end of the Pope's 12-day trip, many questions remained unanswered.",1985-02-10T05:00:00+0000

us,THE LIFE WE LIVE AND THE LIFE WE WRITE,"WHERE does autobiography end and fiction begin? Best seller lists and publishers' catalogues assume we know the answer to this question, as they assume there is a clear- cut difference between fiction and nonfiction. Many writers are not so sure. The strongest and most passionate writing always comes out of our own experiences and obsessions - but how we transform these obsessions depends on the writer, or even on the writer's mood, at a given point in time. In some ways, I knew my 18th-century historical novel, ''Fanny: being the True History of the Adventures of Fanny Hackabout-Jones'' to be a truer spiritual autobiography than my other novels, ''Fear of Flying'' or ''How to Save Your Own Life'' or even my most recent, ''Parachutes and Kisses.'' In seeking to devise a historical fable for myself, I was forced to reveal my own obsessions to myself in a very distilled way. But to most readers, the more a book resembles the outer structure of an author's life, the more ''autobiographical'' it will be presumed to be. That there is autobiography within fiction and fiction within autobiography comes as no surprise to the author or reader who knows exactly what Gustave Flaubert meant when he said: ''Madame Bovary, c'est moi.''",1985-02-10T05:00:00+0000

Even today the oratorio is beloved by a large audience, and it was significant that the New York Philharmonic's four performances in 1979 sold out well in advance. So it is somewhat surprising that it has not been recorded very often. The Schwann catalogue lists only three albums and a one-disk set of excerpts. Now there is an able new version on the Erato label (NUM 751473, three disks). It bears the title ''Elias,'' using the German text, which Mendelssohn set first, although the premiere was given in English in England. Michel Corboz, the Swiss conductor, leads the Choirs and Orchestra of the Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon, and the soloists are Edith Wiens, soprano; Carolyn Watkinson, alto; Keith Lewis, tenor, and Benjamin Luxon, baritone.",1985-02-10T05:00:00+0000

us,POINTLESS GRAND JURY SECRECY,"There is a troublesome thread connecting the Bernhard H. Goetz shootings, the death by a police shotgun blast of Eleanor Bumpurs and the death in police custody of the graffiti artist Michael Stewart: each case was subject to investigation and preliminary judgment by a secret grand jury. While these events were generating front-page stories, the secrecy of grand jury proceedings was nurturing an atmosphere in which cynicism about the criminal justice system and accusations of racial bias flourished. The grand jury system, which badly misserves the public interest, should be reformed. In theory, the secrecy of grand jury proceedings protects defendants and the integrity of the criminal justice process. In reality, it does neither in most cases, which may explain why 25 states prefer preliminary court hearings to grand jury investigations. The purposes of grand jury secrecy are to encourage testimony and to protect witnesses; to guard against the flight of suspects who may not know they are being investigated; to preserve the reputations of innocent suspects; and to assure that an unbiased petit jury can later be convened if a suspect is indicted. Thus, grand juries are useful in organized- crime cases, where secrecy may induce informers and gang members to testify, and in probes of corruption among public officials. But what about cases in which a suspect is identified or arrested prior to grand jury proceedings? Here, the reasons for secrecy disappear. In publicized cases in this category, the people's right to know the facts and evaluate the process of justice clearly outweighs any interest in secrecy. In the Goetz case, for example, the key players faced the bright lights of publicity well before the grand jury proceedings. There was no realistic fear that witnesses would either hesitate to testify or be endangered if they did. Normal subpoena power was adequate to compel testimony. The flight of suspects was not a factor, and the protection of Mr. Goetz's reputation was hardly a concern after the publicity he received - and, in fact, courted - after his arrest.

Conventional telescopes have been limited in size by the extreme difficulty of casting very large blocks of glass, polishing them into large mirrors of exactly the necessary shape and maintaining that shape despite the effects of temperature and sag as they sweep the skies. The new telescopes, all of them proven in tests but not yet in full-scale operation, are being made possible by such innovations as mass production of large mirrors in swirling baths of molten glass, liquid mirrors formed of large, fast-spinning basins of mercury, and the use of multiple conventional telescopes linked together in the fashion of the large arrays of antennas used in radio astronomy.",1985-02-12T05:00:00+0000

The festivities always attract flocks of tourists, and anyone who doesn't know the area might wish to take along the new Chinatown Map and Guide, published by Iris' Art Studio. It includes a brief history of Chinatown, information on the Chinese Zodiac (this will be the Year of the Ox), descriptions of the four main cuisines and lists of food and clothing stores as well as restaurants. There is also a walking tour keyed to the map, which is easy to read since the area covered is rather small and the print is large. The Chinatown Map and Guide is printed in black, red and gold on glossy white paper and sells for $2.50 in bookstores or directly from Iris' Art Studio at 146 Sullivan Street, telephone 212-677-9383. 2.*Lucite and Silver Tie Black tie with a difference: This one is made of black Lucite and sterling silver and isn't really a tie at all. It is a hinged neckpiece that a man may wear in lieu of a tie or a woman may wear as jewelry.

Decades later local graybeards with lips untouched by a lie would assure you that they had often seen the future novelist swinging on the vicarage gate.

The company says that ''Biotan is not a sun screen, but its action works synergistically with ultra-violet sun filters to increase photo- protection against U.V. rays.'' It further claims that this Biotan complex stimulates the skin to produce more melanin, the component in the skin that interacts with the sun to create a tan.

Politicians speculate that the two challengers will make the Mayor's re-election more likely by splitting the votes and energies of his opponents.

THEY MADE TOMBS FOR A LIVING","One of the most enthralling archeological discoveries in recent decades was the excavation of the 3,000-year-old ''village of the tombmakers'' in what is now Deir el Medina in Egypt. Here, under the shadow of the desert cliffs in which they worked, lived the elite community of skilled craftsmen - stone quarrymen, masons, sculptors, draftsmen, painters and wood carvers - who built the great tombs of the kings. Generation after generation of these villagers left behind a record of daily life in their ubiquitous graffiti and in the meticulous records of their scribes. In ANCIENT LIVES: Daily Life in Egypt of the Pharaohs (Holt, $18.95) , John Romer, who spent 15 years as an archeologist in Egypt, re-creates in rich, sensory detail the rhythms and textures of ordinary life in an extraordinary time and place. We learn what the villagers' houses were like, what they ate and wore, what they dreamt about (there is even a remedy for frightening dreams - a recitation ''accompanied by the eating of fresh bread and green herbs moistened with beer''). We hear of the frantic speed with which quarrymen and artists, working in shifts, prepared a tomb for a royal burial, of feuds between foremen and of workers' strikes when food rations, which had to be brought to the isolated village from across the Nile, were delayed. Some readers may be put off by the dense accumulation of archeological detail. But for those who stay with it, this book has rewards. Mr. Romer can make you feel ''the silence of the desert hissing in the evening air,'' hear the chink of the grave robber's chisel and see artists at work in dark, cavernous chambers lit by flickering oil lamps.",1985-02-17T05:00:00+0000

Both the paintings of Caravaggio and the development of landscape painting in Rome, the subject of the loan exhibition at the Richard L. Feigen Gallery, reflect the growth of naturalism in the 17th century and the Baroque fascination with light. Both also reflect, though in very different ways, the breakdown of the Renaissance belief in the primacy of man and the Baroque's intense awareness of mortality. Caravaggio's stark dramas are distinguished in part by a penetrating sense of fatality. In landscape painting, human beings are often dwarfed by vast expanses and silenced by the indestructible rhythms of the natural world.",1985-02-22T05:00:00+0000

They then present this blown-up detail as a work by a new abstract painter. The subject of the original painting is lost, the loops and swirls of paint take over, and the superficial resemblance to an abstract painting of the 1940's and 50's can be very striking.

These ''talk pieces,'' as he calls them, belong somewhere among a standup comedian's rap, a storyteller's fable and a formal lecture. Mr. Antin's manner is relaxed and the progress of his talk seemingly random. I say ''seemingly'' because his casual manner belies a more serious intent. That intent has something to do with the nature of audience expectations - the way we expect a poet to read his poems, a lecturer to follow a reasoned argument, a performance artist to ''do'' something. Mr. Antin defeats all these expectations and provides something else, and as anyone who has witnessed one of his talks can testify, the experience can be stimulating in all sorts of ways that poetry readings, lectures and performances seldom are.",1985-02-24T05:00:00+0000

CBS ISN'T BLAMELESS","There was a sad and somewhat hollow ring to Gen. William C. Westmoreland's claims of victory in his two-and-a-half year battle with CBS to save his honor and punish the network to the tune of $120 million. The network has indeed won. The general has capitulated. But there is something unpleasant about the way CBS is gloating in victory. In their joint statement, CBS and General Westmoreland said they ''believe that their respective positions have been effectively placed before the public.'' That is probably true. But it has been done at a cost of millions of dollars and considerable anguish on both sides. That alone makes gloating seem inappropriate. In fact, had ''The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception,'' the documentary over which the court battle was fought, been produced in a less polemical fashion, with more concern for standards of fairness, the public would undoubtedly have been better served and the lawsuit would probably have been avoided. The reason is that CBS almost certainly misled viewers by reducing an extremely complex situation to an unrealistically simple thesis - that General Westmoreland ''cooked the books,'' conspiring to deceive the President about enemy troop strength so that he could continue pursuing an immoral and unwinnable war. Even if you buy the CBS thesis, as some knowledgeable observers do, the question still arises, why produce the show in such a one-sided way? After all, there are many equally knowledgeable observers who consider the thesis absurd in its simplicity.",1985-02-24T05:00:00+0000

But last week, his confirmation was blocked until Democrats and Republicans resolved their differences on an entirely unrelated concern yesterday.","The delay began when Senate Democrats from farm states opened a filibuster aimed at tying a vote on Mr. Meese to emergency farm credit legislation. Although a tentative agreement was worked out Friday that would have increased loans to farmers for spring planting and made them easier to obtain, the deal fell victim to partisan rancor. The filibuster continued yesterday, but late in the afternoon, the new Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, and the Democrats' leader, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, announced another deal: Friday's agreement would go forward, and the amendments that Democrats and Republicans wanted would be attached to an African relief bill tomorrow.

A COURT'S NO FORUM","In the aftermath of my decision to withdraw my libel suit against CBS in return for its acknowledgment that I had conducted myself faithfully and in a patriotic and loyal manner, I have received positive and negative responses from those who supported me in my effort. Perhaps the most significant lesson I have learned is this: a court of law is not the proper place for deciding matters of historical significance or indeed judging the motives of those who played important roles in history. However, as my case and several others have recently demonstrated, this country and its citizens, public and private alike, need some nongovernmental, nonjudicial forum where complaints against the media can be heard, judged and redressed. This is not an indictment of our legal system. All who participated in my case, including the defendants and their counsel, conducted themselves in a proper manner. But one cannot recreate a major historical event in the courtroom. As for the CBS Reports television program ''The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception,'' I know that it was biased, misleading - far from objective. But that sometimes occurs in journalism, which properly seeks to expose misdeeds, bad judgments, acts against the public interest.

us,IN SHORT,"A. W. Clemmons, real estate developer and sometime theatrical agent, is a solitary in his private life, someone whose anger has led him to ''swipe a clear radius around himself,'' who feels a ''sense of communion in empty houses.'' We are given to understand that his problem is womankind. Estranged from his wife, Clemmons lives and works in Boston Corners, a town made famous by the brutal prizefight held there in the last century. As the novel opens, Clemmons is surprised to learn that his daughter Milly intends to get married in the very spot on the field where the boxers spilled each other's blood. The field thus becomes the central metaphor of this well-told chronicle, a way of summarizing Clemmons's struggle with the females in his life - women ''who took a part of him into themselves . . . so that gradually the original disappeared into them.'' The protagonist does not seem to recognize this white-hot misogyny for what it is; his vision is continually blurred by sentimentality (his toothsome daughter Daisy, for him, has eyes like ''Christmas mornings''), and the true shape of his rage is often reduced to a childish or hysterical notion of responsibility. When he contracts a social disease, he imagines that it has been produced by ''every woman he has ever known''; climbing a dangerous ladder, he tries not to listen to his mother and daughter - because their warnings, in the past, have supposedly caused him to fall. It seems that the institution of family will always make Clemmons uncomfortable, no matter how often he wanders back into its ambiguous warmth; the pleasures he lives easily with, by contrast, are the embers of an eternal adolescence, sly promises of fire in the ash pits of the everyday.",1985-02-24T05:00:00+0000

If Wendell Berry, author of ''The Unsettling of America'' and ''The Gift of Good Land,'' is a writer and farmer. Mr. Stockman were speaking for himself, he could be ignored. What matters is that he is representing an attitude that has been dominant in the offices of agriculture since Ezra Taft Benson was Secretary, in the Eisenhower Administration. Mr. Stockman, a key member of an Administration that would abandon farmers to the justice of the market, assures us that the continuing dispossession of thousands of farm families is merely a matter of good economics: ''that is the way a dynamic economy works.''

Miss Vail believes that accessories are easy to order by mail because size is rarely a problem - and she has a point. But what makes her catalogue really special is her eye for fashion. Thus her jewelry for spring includes long chains and pearls with Maltese crosses, heavy bangles and oversized earrings. Hosiery includes dotted and lace pantyhose as well as colorful anklets, and there is an assortment of silk mufflers in a rainbow of colors. To order the catalogue, which is illustrated with color photographs, send $2 to Siri Vail Collection, 5551 North Long, Chicago, Ill. 60630. 2.*Scrub-a-Dub Fun How to encourage a child to scrub- a-dub-dub: Provide colorful sponges shaped like pigs, teddy bears, frogs, ducks or sea shells.

us,  PHILADELPHIA SHOW: A FLOWERY CLASSIC,"PHILADELPHIA ng of t SOMETIME late Friday night, the mud should be hosed from the five acres of floor, the bulldozers and forklifts should disappear and the final flowers should be in place. By 8 Saturday morning, 160 horticultural judges will have arrived at the annual spring rite of the Philadelphia Flower Show. The show, first held in 1829, will open to the public Sunday and will run through March 10 at the Civic Center, near the University of Pennsylvania campus. There will be more than 50 displays by nurseries, florists, plant societies and garden clubs, along with nearly 600 competitive horticultural classes and 83 trade booths. The sponsor is the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, which says this is the largest indoor flower show in the world. The theme is ""A Touch of Britain - Our Garden Heritage,"" a reference to the Royal Horticultural Society's Chelsea Flower Show in London, the closest world-class competitor to the Philadelphia show. While both shows attract many visitors - last year the Philadelphia had 230,000 and the Chelsea 240,000 - the two have one major difference: in Philadelphia, almost all the plants must be forced, while at Chelsea, which is held in May, spring species are in bloom naturally. ""To exhibit in March, most nurserymen must force twice as many plants as are needed to insure a good selection,"" said Jane Pepper, president of the society and manager of the show. A sense of sharing seems to permeate this year's event: two distinguished British guests, the gardener and author Rosemary Verey and the flower arranger Sheila MacQueen, have been invited to serve as judges and speakers. Also on hand from England is Geoffrey Ace, who heads the landscape construction department of the Merrist Wood Agricultural College in Worplesdon, Surrey, England. The college's exhibits have won six consecutive gold medals at Chelsea and have so impressed Ed Lindemann, designer of the Philadelphia Flower Show, that he arranged for Mr. Ace and four students to participate in the show. For months, the Merrist Wood group has planned its exhibit, working by mail and telephone with its counterparts at Mr. Lindemann's alma mater, the Delaware Valley College of Science and Agriculture in Doylestown, Pa. This week, under Mr. Ace's guidance, students from both schools were laying a precise stone edge for the undulating bed of thyme, artemisia, candytuft, columbine and the other plants. At the foot of the Civic Center's central escalator, the Philadelphia society's display is being created in association with Gale Nurseries of Gwynedd, Pa. Charles Gale Sr., the owner, said the exhibit will include a boxwood knot garden and a parterre of ageratum and begonias, as well as an arborvitae hedgerow framing a formal rose garden. Mr. Gale is also very proud of his use of what he calls ""the classic British gardening trick"" of interplanting clematis and climbing roses. No British-inspired flower show would be complete without quaint cottages. Rose Valley Nurseries of Media, Pa., is working on a thatched- roof model. The ""thatch"" is hay, since according to the nursery's owner, Wayne Norton, ""the half-acre of reed required for a thatched roof is nearly as hard to find here as it is in England."" Gardeners might spend an extra moment at this display, because rather than the classic cottage garden of flowering perennials, Mr. Norton is planting ornamental grasses, sedges, rushes and reeds. Meadowbrook Farm of Meadowbrook, Pa., will execute a series of dooryard gardens with whimsical potted topiaries of ficus and ivy, but the most naturalistic garden will be that of Vick's Wildgardens of Gladwyne, Pa., which will include a running stream and some 35 tons of rock. When asked how his design fit in with the show's theme, Albert Vick Jr. answered spiritedly: ""There's no relation to the theme. My display is a touch of America, with flora that is native to this part of the country."" The Philadelphia Civic Center is at 34th Street and Civic Center Boulevard. Tickets are $6.50 for adults, $3.25 for children under 12. Hours are 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Sundays, 10 A.M. to 9:30 P.M. Monday through Saturday. The Civic Center is a 15- to 20-minute walk from the 30th Street Amtrak station; during the show, shuttle buses will operate every 15 minutes, at 85 cents a ride in exact change. - GARDENING",1985-02-28T05:00:00+0000
