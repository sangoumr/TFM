The Bukhara emirate was taken over by the Soviet Union in 1920, becoming a part of the republics of Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan. But its music and dances were preserved, and tomorrow at Merkin Concert Hall, New Yorkers will have an opportunity to hear Bukhara's traditional music, or shashmaqam, along with the region's folk songs and dances.",1988-01-01T05:00:00+0000

The drop came despite what dealers said was a fourth straight day of buying dollars by the central banks of Japan, West Germany and Switzerland. For the second consecutive year, the dollar recorded the dubious distinction of falling to its lowest levels of the year on the year's last day. The outlook for 1988 is not much better, although the Group of Seven has proclaimed again that the dollar has fallen enough. [ Page 1. ] COMPANIES American vintners are deeply concerned but widely divided about how to combat the movement to curb wine consumption. A growing interest in health and concern with alcohol abuse are fueling a drive for greater regulation of the wine industry. While wine makers say they do not see a direct connection between declining wine sales and the various advocacy groups - which they call ''neo-prohibitionists'' - some vintners nonetheless take them as a serious threat. [ 1. ] Texaco will borrow $3.4 billion and use $2.2 billion of its cash to settle its dispute with Pennzoil, pay off its creditors and emerge from bankruptcy, the company said in a document filed with a Federal Bankruptcy Court. Texaco's shareholders will vote on the proposal in a special monthlong ballot in March, with a two-thirds vote in favor required for acceptance. A Federal bankruptcy judge could approve the plan even if it is rejected by the shareholders. [ 39. ] Conrail's president and chief operating officer resigned after being passed over as designated successor to the chief executive. Stuart M. Reed, the president, had been in the shadow of L. Stanley Crane, the chairman and chief executive, during his eight years at Conrail. Mr. Reed said he was shocked to learn that the board did not intend to consider him for the company's top position. [ 39. ] USX expects to take a charge against fourth-quarter earnings to reflect the decline in the value of oil inventories at its Marathon Oil subsidiary. [ 41. ] Imperial increased to $108 the cash portion of its offer for Holly Sugar, from $105. Holly had previously agreed to be acquired. [ 41. ] MARKETS The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.27 points, to 1,938.83, ending a frustrating and record-smashing year. The Dow dropped 60.84 points this week to end the year 42.88 points, or 2.26 percent, above its 1986 close of 1,895.95. Some experts attributed yesterday's showing to the dollar's latest drop and to tax-related selling. [ 39. ] Treasury note and bond prices fell as much as a point, as the dollar's decline cast a pall over the credit markets. Besides lamenting the absence of demand from foreign investors, traders said prices were reduced by unconfirmed rumors that Japanese investors would be heavy sellers of bonds on Monday. [ 48. ] Precious metals futures posted moderate advances, but analysts said the gains were more subdued than they would have otherwise expected in view of the dollar's drop. ''Gold just doesn't want to rally,'' one analyst said. [ 49. ] THE ECONOMY A.T.&T. will lower rates for interstate long-distance calls by an average of 3.5 percent starting today, a larger reduction than expected. The lower rates reflect a $772 million reduction in the charges that A.T.&T. pays for connections to local systems. [ 39. ] Orders to factories edged up 0.1 percent in November, the weakest showing in three months. The report prompted concern about a possible slowdown in manufacturing in the aftermath of the October stock market collapse. [ 39. ] Prices that farmers received for raw products fell 3 percent in December from the November average. Lower prices for oranges, tomatoes, eggs and lettuce contributed most to the decline.

John Longley, general manager for Bond's syndicate, which has competed in the last five America's Cup series, said work on the super-maxi Waltzing Matilda would cease immediatly, even though the Bond syndicate had spent more than $1 million on it. Fay has criticised the San Diego stance and says the challenge will almost certainly now be a one-on-one battle between New Zealand and the cup holder. ''It looks as though even pressure from Bondy can't force San Diego to change its mind,'' Fay said. ''It looks like they still have their minds on the 12-Meter challenge in 1991 and just want to get this one out of the way.

us,"NEWS SUMMARY SATURDAY, JANUARY 2, 1988","INTERNATIONAL 3-8, 24 A Salvadoran amnesty law has led to the release of several gunmen accused of killing American and Salvadoran civilians, the United States embassy and human rights activists in that country say. Page 1 Israeli soldiers were on alert in Gaza, Jerusalem and the West Bank to combat Palestinian attempts to commemorate the 23d anniversary of Yasir Arafat's first military operation against Israel. 1 In Egypt, hundreds of protesters chanting Islamic fundamentalist slogans were beaten by the police. The police also besieged others at Cairo's Al-Azhar mosque, witnesses said. 8 News analysis: The Soviet economy entered a new era as Moscow initiated a program under which workers are being asked to change their notion of work without having early rewards from years of economic experiments. 1 In televised New Year's greetings by President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev to the Soviet and American people, Mr. Reagan told millions of Soviet viewers about freedoms unavailable in their country. 1 Britain suppressed information about the causes of a major nuclear accident, a fire at a British nuclear plant in 1957. The Prime Minister feared it would threaten cooperation with the United States, documents show. 3 In Cambodia, the Prime Minister has reassumed the position of Foreign Minister. The move by Prime Minister Hun Sen may affect the tentative peace process in that country. 24 A Bangkok hotel fire killed 13 people and injured 36 others. Some guests suffered injuries trying to jump from windows or rooftops, according to police and fire officials. 3 From Poles ferment, a socialist party 3 Tokyo journal: Wrestler fails to keep hold on an honorable past 4 Soviet halts jamming of broadcasts to Poland 5 Czechoslovak president lauds Soviet goals 6 NATIONAL 9-10, 44 Nobody, it seems, has enough time, according to market researchers and poll takers. The sense that there is too much to do is especially acute at this time of year. Yet people cannot seem to resist piling on more. 1 In Idaho, laws against harassment because of religion or race have been passed in communities surrounding the headquarters of a neo-Nazi sect. ''This community has been examining its conscience,'' one legislator said. 9 Philadelphia's police are improving but have ''not yet fully escaped the powerful pressures of the past that permit misconduct and result in lower standards of policing,'' a citizen's group said. 9 A California smoking ban on planes, trains and buses took effect, but at least two airlines ignored the law, saying superseding Federal regulations allowed smoking sections. 44 Gary Hart's 1988 campaign funds cannot be claimed by two of his creditors to satisfy debts from 1984, a Federal magistrate ruled, saying that the current campaign organization was a distinct legal entity from the 1984 organization. 9 A judge shortage poses a problem that is not likely to be resolved soon because of budget pressures, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said in a year-end report on the Federal judicary. The shortage is among both trial and appellate judges. 10 A.H. Robins accepted a takeover bid from Sanofi of France. Sanofi will pay $600 million for 58 percent of Robins and will guarantee bank loans to a trust fund for women claiming injuries from the Dalkon Shield. 29 The PTL ministry's trustee will take action to recover what the Internal Revenue Service says is $9.36 million in excessive compensation paid to Jim and Tammy Bakker, an attorney for the trustee said. 9 A motor tied to superconductivity has been developed by scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory. It is the first electrical motor based on the properties of the material that conducts electricity with minimal resistance. 10 Dallas trash, from cans to bags 9 Monsignor accuses South Carolina Republicans of racism 10 REGIONAL 25-27 A Coliseum site development plan has been approved by the Koch administration. The new plan makes no reference to the height of the project, reduces its purchase price and places a new financial constraint on the developer. 1 In the schools chancellor battle, the president of the New York City Board of Education and the head of the teachers union moved closer in deciding who should hold the post. 1 News analysis: The chancellor's job is the focus in a battle over whether the person hired should be an outsider, unencumbered by existing loyalties, or an insider, someone steeped in the system's bureaucracy. 27 Chancellor candidate is perceived as teachers' ally 27 Despite a shortage of hospital beds in New York City, an average of 2,000 beds a day are occupied by patients who are medically ready for discharge and do not belong there, government and health care officials said. 25 Some defendants on New Year's Eve waited in a holding pen behind the courtroom of Judge Joel M. Goldberg, waiting to be arraigned. Judge Goldberg presides over the first and perhaps the most undesirable full court session of the year. 25 Noise and excitement in Stamford on New Year's Eve were the signs of the successful staging of a family-style, arts-oriented and alcohol-free celebration. More than 10,000 people attended. 25 Dreams and fears of the new year were expressed by New Yorkers on the first day of 1988. While some people said they had concrete plans for what they wanted to accomplish, others expressed anxiety about what the year would bring. 25 The first Democratic chief executive in Suffolk County in 16 years was inaugurated. At the hourlong ceremony, the chief executive, Patrick G. Halpin, described the county as an area ''on the edge of greatness.'' 27 About New York: Composer, at 75, gets his big break 25 Two officers find cache of guns and drugs in Queens house 26 Lawyers seek court order in Zibabwean child abuse case 27 Neediest Cases 28",1988-01-02T05:00:00+0000

People will be more concerned about poverty in America if they see its face up close. That appears to be the premise that inspired Eugene Richards, an award-winning photographer, to put together this book, a collection of photographs and interviews documenting the hardship endured by 21 of the nation's 32.4 million poor people. The interviews seem dull and dreary at first, but the voices of the poor ring out with piercing poignancy from some of the later pages: ''The day I sold the last of my livestock was probably the saddest day of my life,'' says an ex-farmer in Creighton, S.D. A woman in Douglas, Wyo., who supports a family by working night and day, says she is ''very ashamed of how I treated my life and my kids'' in earlier years. The photographs give a powerful impression of life in a shantytown on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, in a shack without electricity in Still House Hollow, Tenn., in a Chicago slum, or in Texas border towns. By neither romanticizing nor scorning the poor, the book breaks the stereotypes of poverty and portrays poor people as individuals. Rhoda H. Karpatkin, executive director of Consumers Union, says in an afterword that the book is ''our attempt to take the wrapping off America's most unacceptable product - poverty - and to reveal what it looks like and feels like.'' The book succeeds in achieving that difficult objective, though it does not offer much insight into the causes of poverty or means to alleviate it.",1988-01-03T05:00:00+0000

At the Whitney Museum of American Art (945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, through Jan. 17), an exhibition of 14 works focuses on Calder's activities during the early 1930's. In these few years, after a revelatory visit to Mondrian's studio in 1930, the artist abandoned the animated wire sculpture often featuring acrobats and other circus scenes, that had earned him his initial reputation. (A prime example of this first phase, of course, is his late 20's ''Circus,'' permanently installed in the Whitney's lobby.) He moved rapidly to balancing acts of an entirely abstract nature, forging a singular alliance between the structural purity of Constructionism and the playful suggestiveness of Surrealism and making the first of his signatory ''mobiles'' and ''stabiles.''",1988-01-03T05:00:00+0000

In this eclectic and engaging smorgasbord of bons mots, statistics, anecdotes and epigrams, one source crashes George F. Will's buffet line twice. ''This ain't a football game. We do this every day,'' Earl Weaver, former manager of the Baltimore Orioles, says about baseball. To this, Mr. Will, the noted conservative political columnist and commentator, adds that, ''Baseball's best teams lose about 65 times a season. It is not a game you can play with your teeth clenched.'' So it is with politics. The author says he hopes to ''defend the dignity, the gravity, the seriousness of the political vocation,'' but in analyzing the rituals of elections and forecasting how they will be played out in 1988, he calls upon wry, mordant commentators: Oliver Wendell Holmes, Max Beerbohm, John Maynard Keynes, Mark Twain and William Shakespeare. The book's three chapters cover President Reagan and the two major parties, about whom Mr. Will's biases are plain. Most Democrats, he suggests, must regard their recent Presidential nominees the way Earl Weaver regarded umpires when he shouted, ''Are you gonna get any better, or is this it?'' Not surprisingly, Mr. Will places his bets on Republicans and advises them on such issues as arms control, which he persists in opposing as ''the central drain on executive energies.'' On most other issues, Mr. Will is happier when no candidate is ''to the left of the fish fork or to the right of the soup spoon'' and when ''politics takes place between the 40-yard lines.'' He is serious about politics but makes a convincing case that, ''All American elections are entertaining. They, like baseball, are only dull to the dull.''",1988-01-03T05:00:00+0000

Can we fault the art critic Thomas McEvilley for the preposterous ambition of ''North of Yesterday''? He flings together the quick and the dead, urban derelicts and characters dreamed up (literally) from an anecdote of Herodotus, and indulges in an orgy of mythologizing - not to mention a mythologizing of orgy. But if in this novel Quintus of Smyrna (fourth century A.D.) strolls the mean streets, if a dope addict sorts out Cheops' family tree with a centuries-dead pimp and whore, did Leopold Bloom really do less? Can't Joyce serve as a precedent for a novel inflated from a scrap of plot? For logorrhea? Couldn't we look to Lawrence as the great original of eroticism reeling with its own lyric impulse, and bugger our bourgeois decorum? (''North of Yesterday'' frequently details, for example, episodes of carnal knowledge between a drugged woman and a . . . walrus.) Didn't Djuna Barnes's ''Nightwood'' assemble a crazy cast and set them to philosophizing in brittle, opaque images and lapidary prose? Wasn't Walt Whitman, in ''The Sleepers,'' a dream journeyman, chanting his intense sojourn through the city suspended? All these and more Mr. McEvilley dares. The phantasmagoria, the quirks of style, the relentless duplication of motif - all might be accommodated if ''North of Yesterday'' were not so badly written. Fewer than a dozen sentences in the novel fail to give pain. Doggerel interlards the prose. The author's clumsy and tasteless language would hardly support a slight fictional structure; but his model is the pyramid of Cheops, and the collapse is complete.",1988-01-03T05:00:00+0000

Simply because one of the world's most powerful men, indeed the world's supreme Communist leader, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, was speaking to us in warmly seductive tones, employing words reminiscent of the social optimism of the 1960's - ''interrelatedness, integral, global peace, democratization'' - and assuring us of matters that sounded almost literally too good to be true, as if our deepest, most desperate wishes were being uttered in an exotically foreign language and translated into our own, did it mean that these matters could not be true? - or even probable? Though the grim lessons of history suggest otherwise, and idealism's trajectory usually falls off rapidly, man is, of all creatures, the hopeful animal; and it is a hard task to resist believing in the very things (above all, an end to the fanatic arms race of past decades) that we have been talking about for so long.",1988-01-03T05:00:00+0000

And perhaps, if we look hard enough, clear connecting threads will be revealed. However, conversations with creative artists about the way they work show that the creative process is an ongoing process of exploration, often into unknown territory. By the time a work of art reaches the public, its creators are often already immersed in future projects that will redefine our perception of the sensibilities we are just coming to know.

us,New & Noteworthy,"ANNA DELANEY'S CHILD, by John Thorndike. (Plume/New American Library, $7.95.) Anna Delaney is grief-stricken by the loss of her son in a car crash; her father, Alex, is depressed over the death of his wife. This ''lyrically powerful'' first novel ''deftly explores the ethics of memory, dramatizing how Anna and Alex learn to forge bonds with the living without betraying their loving memories of the dead,'' Sherie Posesorski said in The Book Review in 1986. THE CYCLES OF AMERICAN HISTORY, by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. (Houghton Mifflin, $11.95.) Liberalism may be on the wane, but as the wheels of history turn, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. believes, its day will come again. In this book of essays, Benjamin R. Barber said here in 1986, ''Mr. Schlesinger both describes and, as an intellectual engage, embodies liberalism's powerful virtues: its intellectual circumspection, its political vigor, its antipathy to extremism, its championing of the unpopular sides of liberty and tolerance and its devotion to social justice. And, without quite meaning to, he exemplifies some of the defects that have contributed to its recent decline.'' AT PLAY IN THE FIELDS OF THE LORD, by Peter Matthiessen. (Vintage, $6.95.) When Peter Matthiessen's novel about the foibles of fundamentalist missionaries in the Amazon jungle was published in 1965, our reviewer, Emile Capouya, liked the author's ''detailed picture of Indian customs, his insight into character and his physical descriptions. [ The book ] is never less than a very superior adventure story, and often a good deal more than that.'' The same publisher has reissued two more of Mr. Matthiessen's early novels. RADITZER ($5.95) is about a strange friendship between two sailors during World War II, one a derelict ne'er-do-well, the other a young aspiring artist. ''This novel is a complex moral parable,'' David Boroff said here in 1961, which reminds us ''that the links that connect us are strangely intricate.'' The hero of PARTISANS ($5.95) is a young American journalist who becomes enmeshed in a search for a disgraced Communist leader. In 1955, William Goyen complained in The Book Review that the author's characters were ''only mouthpieces,'' but he was impressed with the ''thoughtful attempt to find answers to ancient and serious questions.'' A SEASON ON THE BRINK: A Year With Bobby Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers, by John Feinstein. (Fireside/ Pocket Books, $4.50.) Bob Knight, the sometimes overbearing basketball coach at Indiana University, is known to despise the press. So it is remarkable that he allowed John Feinstein, a Washington Post sportswriter, to spend the 1985-86 season chronicling his tempestuous relationship with his team. ''It's the best book on sports that I have read in some time,'' one reviewer said in 1986, ''and one of the most troubling.'' SAINTS AND STRANGERS, by Angela Carter. (King Penguin, $5.95.) The characters in Angela Carter's collection of eight stories include Edgar Allan Poe, Lizzie Borden and Jeanne Duval, the alienated mistress of Charles Baudelaire who ''was like a piano in a country where everyone has had their hands cut off.'' ''Ms. Carter's is an absolutely unique voice,'' Charles Newman said in The Book Review in 1986, ''intensely literary without being precious, deep without being difficult, indifferent to formulas without being 'experimental,' and funny without being superficial or cruel.'' A MISSING PLANE, by Susan Sheehan. (Berkley, $3.50.) After the wreckage of a World War II transport plane was found in the New Guinea jungle in 1982, Susan Sheehan recorded the efforts of the United States Army's Central Identification Laboratory to excavate the decades-old remains. And, through interviews with friends and relatives, she unearthed the histories of the 22 men who had been on board. In 1986, our reviewer, Eric Lax, called the book ''a superbly reported reconstruction of a quirk of fate and its aftermath.'' CITY OF WOMEN: Sex and Class in New York, 1789-1860, by Christine Stansell. (University of Illinois, $9.95.) During the 19th century, Christine Stansell believes, New York City's working women developed into a socially aware class that challenged the status quo. While Martha Saxton had quibbles with the neo-Marxian analysis, she said here in 1986 that the author had written ''an immensely important book for historians.'' SHERMAN'S MARCH AND VIETNAM, by James Reston Jr. (Macmillan, $10.95.) The My Lai massacre and other Vietnam war crimes have roots in General Sherman's historic march to the sea, James Reston Jr. argues. Stephen W. Sears said here in 1985 that he found the analogy strained, but he admired the author's ''ambitious effort both to understand and to resolve what was for many the central dilemma'' of the United States' role in Southeast Asia. A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW, by Max Wilk. (PaperJacks, $4.50.) This roman a clef about the early days of television revolves around a Hollywood film executive's attempt to document the rise and fall of an obnoxiously ambitious comedian. Max Wilk ''handles nostalgia well,'' our reviewer, Carole Klein, said in 1986. He is ''a stylish and skillful storyteller.'' THE POLITICAL LIFE OF CHILDREN, by Robert Coles. (Houghton Mifflin, $10.95.) By interviewing children in trouble spots around the world, the author tries to learn how they develop their political and moral consciousness. ''There is no one who is more interested in what children say, sing, don't say or don't sing - and why - than Robert Coles,'' Neil Postman said in The Book Review in 1986. ''He is to the stories that children have to tell what Homer was to the tale of the Trojan War.''

In 1945, Rumanian intelligence officers provided the nascent United States intelligence organization with copious secret files on the Soviet Union - of value in part because they covered Soviet territory occupied by Rumanian forces during World War II. In 1978, Ion Pacepa, chief of the Rumanian foreign intelligence service, defected to the United States, one of the highest-ranking East European espionage chiefs to change sides since Communist rule was established in Eastern Europe. On the face of it, he seemed to be the biggest catch from Rumania since the 1945 files. But since his defection, Mr. Pacepa, who in Rumania attained the rank of lieutenant general and was a personal adviser to President Nicolae Ceausescu, has several times changed his stories. The changes, according to the State Department and counterintelligence officers who have debriefed him, have cast doubt on his veracity. Now, with ''Red Horizons,'' he offers a version of his life and experiences that increases one's doubts about whether his defection was much of a coup. Mr. Pacepa is the Happy Hooker of the spy trade, relating utterly sordid tales of a drunken Ceausescu son tearing the clothes off women at parties and urinating on a plate of oysters, of the deviant sexual tastes of a Palestinian leader and vile acts by Rumanian politicians. These squalid anecdotes about the private lives of the Communist elite make up a good part of the memoir; I can confirm his picture of the debauchery of the Ceausescu son Nicu, who heads the Communist youth movement. But when Mr. Pacepa describes the poor, rundown Athenee Palace Hotel as a grand nest of spies, or boasts that Rumania maintained powerful ''agents of influence'' in this country, or profited from the theft of American advanced technology one can only chuckle. Besides, his stories are all at least a decade old.",1988-01-03T05:00:00+0000

Proud Debonair was placed second in the revised order of finish with Native Wizard awarded the third spot. King's Swan, the odds-on favorite, bore in, impeding Native Wizard nearing the finish. He reached the wire a half-length ahead of Clever Secret, but was disqualified following an inquiry. Clever Secret carried 112 pounds and E. T. Baird over the mile-and-a-sixteenth route in 1:45 1/5 on a fast track. The 4-year-old colt by Secretariat-Small Loaf earned $54,180 for Eugene V. Klein and returned $30.60 for $2 to win in the field of nine. Bowling A First for Jasnau: Mike Jasnau of Wichita, Kan., threw a strike in the final frame to capture his first Professional Bowlers Association title in the ARC Alameda Open in California.

(AP) Track and Field Pascuzzo Qualifies for Games Trials: Mike Pascuzzo of Mount Laurel, N.J., a former University of Maryland high jumper now competing for the New York Athletic Club, made the qualifying height for the 1988 Olympic trials yesterday when he cleared 7 feet 5 inches during the Reebok New Year's Indoor Festival at the fieldhouse of the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y. Bill Krone won the two-mile run in 8 minutes 53.38 seconds. Jim Flynn was second in 8:56.98, and Pat Petersen was third in 9:01.37. In high-school events, Rod Greenidge of Boys and Girls upset Sam Rice of Cardinal Hayes in the 300-meter dash in 35.88 seconds.

Boxing Nunn Keeps His Title: Michael Nunn of Van Nuys, Calif., the North American Boxing Federation middleweight champion, defended his title against Kevin Watts of Pleasantville, N.J., yesterday by taking a unanimous 12-round decision in Los Angeles. The champion, who weighed 160 pounds, used superior hand and foot speed to negate Watts's punching power. Watts, who also weighed 160, moved in steadily and kept pressuring. The 23-year-old Nunn, who won his 28th consecutive bout, is ranked No. 2 by both the World Boxing Council and the World Boxing Association. Watts appeared to make Nunn back off in the 11th round, hitting him with a powerful left-right combination. But Nunn regained his composure and finished the round in command. Nunn improved to 28-0; Watts fell to 17-4-1.(AP)",1988-01-03T05:00:00+0000

The state Correction Commissioner, Michael V. Fair, disclosed last week that he had received the apology in a letter from Mr. Therrien, a former state trooper who in 1975 was sentenced to serve two consecutive life terms for killing his business partner and a Westwood police officer. Mr. Fair, who two years ago overruled other prison officials in approving Mr. Therrien's petition to transfer to the minimum-security facility from which he subsequently escaped, said he felt ''burned and betrayed.''

John W. Ryan looked over the same border 206 years later, saw the corporate headquarters of Westchester County, and decided that a 17-home development on the same hillside would have a market. Work has begun on three houses since the project was approved in the summer, with the first to be completed in March. The entire project should take three years to complete. The four-bedroom, colonial-style homes, priced from $700,000 to $750,000, will sit on three-acre lots, as mandated by Ridgefield zoning laws. The town also required that the project, near several stables, have a riding trail across it. ''Ridgefield is equestrian country, and so they wanted to get from one area to another,'' said Daniel R. Pisani, Mr. Ryan's partner. ''It's sort of like a right of way.''",1988-01-03T05:00:00+0000

American companies made deals with European radio stations for tapes and other materials, and out came Verdi and Donizetti operas nobody had ever heard. Young, unknown artists came cheap, and they were signed up left and right. Some, like Alfred Brendel and Paul Badura-Skoda, went on to big things.

Boxing On the Comeback Trail: Donald Curry, a former welterweight champion, continued his comeback by scoring a unanimous 12-round decision over 25-year-old Lupe Aquino of Mexico in a super welterweight bout yesterday. On the same card, Gianfranco Rosi of Italy, the World Boxing Council super welterweight champion, defended his title by knocking out Duane Thomas of Detroit. Rosi will now defend on April 8 against Curry. Curry piled up a wide advantage by landing fast left hooks and precise combinations to the body and head of Aquino. Curry, of Fort Worth, lost his welterweight title in September 1986 to Lloyd Honeyghan of Britain. Last year, Curry was stopped by Mike McCallum in six rounds for the vacant World Boxing Association junior middleweight title.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: TUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1988","INTERNATIONAL The U.S. and other governments bought an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion in dollars, helping the currency recover from a sharp decline in Asian trading, dealers said. To some market analysts, the purchases indicated that Washington and other governments feared another uncontrolled fall in the dollar. On Wall Street, stock prices staged a strong rally. [ Page A1. ] The dollar rallied on the signs of buying by the central banks. Gold fell $7.05 an ounce in New York, to $479.20. [ D16. ] Saudi Arabia is taxing foreign businesses and workers on their incomes and increasing import duties on many goods. It also issued its first public debt in a quarter-century and drew money from its foreign currency reserves. The taxes will affect the profitability of hundreds of foreign companies and will fall heavily on the one million foreign workers, including 35,000 to 40,000 Americans. [ A1. ] Iranian and Turkish officials discussed a new pipeline. Iran's desire for a pipeline through Turkey reflects the toll that Iraqi raids are taking on Iranian shipments, experts say. [ A10. ] Price Waterhouse won't require clients to write down the value of their Mexican loans if they participate in a plan to exchange part of those loans, at a loss, for new Mexican bonds, the accounting firm is expected to announce. [ D4. ] COMPANIES Hoffmann-La Roche offered $4.2 billion for Sterling Drug, makers of Bayer aspirin, Phillips Milk of Magnesia and dozens of other pharmaceutical items. The $72-a-share cash offer, which is being presented directly to shareholders, drew no immediate response from Sterling, which is expected to resist. [ D1. ] Reader's Digest will buy Family Handyman, the home-improvement magazine, its second acquisition in a little more than a year. The price was thought to be about $30 million - a relatively high 12 times cash flow. [ D1. ] Continental's first-class seats and service will be sold for coach fares, and other airlines are expected to follow suit. Continental, Eastern and Northwest also announced cuts of as much as 20 percent in discount fares. [ D1. ] Dow Jones sold its Richard D. Irwin textbook publishing unit to Times Mirror for $135 million. [ D3. ] E-II Holdings will put up six candidates for American Brands' board. [ D3. ] MARKETS Stock prices staged a powerful year-opening rally and traders said a strengthening dollar and program trading were behind the surge. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 76.42 points, or 3.94 percent, to 2,015.25. That was its fourth-best point gain ever and its highest close since Oct. 21. [ D1. ] Treasury bond prices retained moderate gains after soaring earlier in the session. While relatively light, the trading was described by some dealers as somewhat unnerving. [ D15. ] Oil prices climbed after an OPEC official said output quotas were being observed, even though few people believed him. [ D16. ] THE ECONOMY Natural gas prices climbed to their highest levels in two years amid the combination of cold weather and a fresh dispute between pipeline companies and gas producers over a Government ruling on prices. Executives at several large users of natural gas said supplies appeared to be plentiful. [ D1. ] A proposal in Delaware to restrict takeovers advanced when a group of lawyers approved it. If the plan enters the Legislature, its fate is unclear amid opposition from S.E.C. officials and large stockholders. Twenty-seven states already have such a law. [ D4. ] Construction spending jumped 2.2 percent in November, the biggest increase in nine months. [ D4. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS Accountants are failing to keep up with the sweeping changes of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and have failed to give their clients important advice on critical matters. Tax Watch. [ D2. ] The Dow's worst performers sometimes turn into winners the following year. The laggard approach to investing produced some interesting results: In 1987, the Dow's five weakest performers of 1986 turned in a banner performance. Market Place. [ D6. ]",1988-01-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q. I am using a veneered hardwood plywood to panel a wall. My problem is covering up the nail holes after I nail the panels in place. No matter what kind of filler or putty I use, the holes are still noticeable. Can you suggest an easy solution? A. An old cabinetmaker's trick should work. Wherever you drive in a nail, first use a very sharp chisel to raise up a sliver of the veneer. Do this without splintering the wood, and without completely shaving it off. Prop the sliver up with a toothpick; then use a nail set to drive the finishing nail through the plywood or paneling under the sliver. After the nail has been countersunk, use some white glue to secure the sliver. Q. My concrete basement floor is covered with vinyl asbestos tile. Mild water pressure under the floor has puckered the tile, especially at the edges. Because I am concerned that walking on the flooring may release asbestos fibers into the air, I had planned to carpet the area. But carpet dealers tell me that the moisture will cause a mildew problem. Can I solve the asbestos problem while also containing the moisture? A. There is probably little need to worry about the asbestos unless you scrape up the tiles or sand them. You can cover them with an outdoor carpet that will withstand dampness, but this will not contain the moisture, which could lead to mildew. The overall solution is to cure the moisture problem first. Call in a waterproofing contractor, who might install a drain system with a sump pump to carry water away. Then you can lay outdoor carpeting, or any other floor covering, over the existing tiles. Q. The supply valves on all my hot-water radiators are rusted in the open position. Most of the heat goes to the upper floor, leaving the lower floor much cooler. I have considered replacing the valves, but am afraid this might jar the old pipes and cause leaks. What should be done? A. In a hot-water system, the valves on all radiators should be open all the way, or shut all the way - never partly open. You might increase heat downstairs by shutting off some upstairs radiators, but this usually doesn't work. The best solution is converting to a two-zone system, with a thermostat for each floor. An experienced mechanic should be able to repair or change the valves without damaging the pipes. Q. We recently moved into a 1939 house and had the bedrooms repainted, not realizing that the walls had been covered with wallpaper that was painted over. The paint job looks only passable, so I am thinking of repainting or putting up new wallpaper. I know I will have to remove the old wallpaper to paint. What is the best way to do this? A. Removing wallpaper that has been painted is a tough job. It might be close to impossible on dry wall, but is easier on plaster. In a 1939 house, the walls must be plaster. Start with a long-handled scraper (the kind for stripping off wallpaper). This has razor-sharp blades and a head that holds the blade almost flat on the paper for efficient scraping. Starting is the hardest part; after that you can usually shave the paper and paint from the wall in strips. After scraping off as much as you can, you might rent a steamer to get the rest of the paper off.",1988-01-07T05:00:00+0000

Formerly four adjacent warehouses at 44 Sherman Avenue, the 54-unit condominium will be completed in March after a year-long, $3.5 million gut rehab. The buildings, once filled with office furniture and archives, were of different heights and additions had to be made to bring the entire structure to its present six floors. Meanwhile, floors did not always meet from one warehouse to another, and the basement, which will be used to park 22 cars, needed 19 tons of steel girders to compensate for nine support columns that had to be removed. The result, Mr. Fioretti said, is solidity, even though the oldest of the warehouses dates from 1890. ''This thing will stand when everything else around it dies,'' he said.",1988-01-10T05:00:00+0000

This ex-naval officer, amateur boxer, cat burglar, linguist, expert lover and former operative for some shadowy government agency is your perfect adventure hero. In fact, his only imperfections are the occasional physical scar and his raspy voice, which produces a growl that resembles the Cookie Monster's. Hatcher, now living on an island somewhere off Florida, is making ends meet by heisting art and ransoming it back to insurance companies when he is recruited to find an old pal, Murphy Cody, who was presumed killed in action 15 years earlier in Vietnam. The ensuing worldwide search leads the reader through familiar thriller territory in quest not only of Cody but also the mysterious identity of the person known as Thai Horse. William Diehl, the author of the novels ''Chameleon'' and ''Sharky's Machine,'' throws everything into this suspense thriller: drugs, the Mafia, Vietnam, Latin American politics, Chinese gangs, Arab terrorist bombings -even a tiger hunt partly seen through the eyes of the tiger. Along the way, we learn much about the Far East. Too much, in fact. Nevertheless, Mr. Diehl knows how to tell a story, and his novel moves along at a good pace. Unfortunately, too many ''colorful'' characters get in the way of the narrative as he scrambles to tie up all the loose ends.",1988-01-10T05:00:00+0000

Yet, until the late 1970's, a distinct boundary separated this literature from the ''modern'' symphonic, operatic and chamber music mainstream - a repertory that begins with the Classicists, gets into full gear for the Romantics, and makes its way somewhat more fitfully through the 20th century.",1988-01-10T05:00:00+0000

Most of us are familiar with the tragic and heroic story of Jim Brady, the White House press secretary; now, Mollie Dickenson, a journalist, has given us a more complete portrait of the man. Leading with the events of March 30, 1981, when Mr. Brady was critically wounded in John Hinckley's failed attempt to assassinate President Reagan, the author goes into absorbing clinical detail about Mr. Brady's injury and the surreal scene at George Washington University Hospital (including Uzi-toting Secret Service agents clad in surgical greens). She deftly intercuts the account of Mr. Brady's recovery with the story of his life and political greening, from Illinois ward politics to the Pentagon and finally to the Reagan campaign. Threaded throughout are anecdotes, most of them garnered from journalists, Washington cronies and Mr. Brady himself, that add up to an informal social history of Republican politics since the mid-1970's. Ms. Dickenson's most important point is that a stronger role for Mr. Brady might have made the Reagan White House a more ideologically temperate place. Mr. Brady is a dyed-in-the-wool moderate and Ms. Dickenson maintains that White House staff, not John Hinckley's bullet, have kept his presence from being more strongly felt.

us,FICTION,"THE PIOUS DANCE: The Adventure Story of a Young Man. By Klaus Mann. Translated by Laurence Senelick. (PAJ Publications, $15.95.) In this 1925 novel, written when its author (Thomas Mann's son) was 19 years old, everything - carnivals, despair, erotic love, bug bites - is experienced with the solemn rhapsodic intensity of romantic youth, a mood reminiscent of Rimbaud that is skillfully captured in Laurence Senelick's translation. Leaving behind his cultured provincial family, young Andreas Magnus comes to Berlin in search of reality and suffering and becomes embroiled in the labyrinthine homosexual underworld of the city. He performs in cabarets with an aging transvestite and a pitiful former prostitute, both of whom fall in love with him; he in turn falls in love with a beautiful hedonist, Niels, who torments and rejects him. While the shrill, sad revels of his doomed circle grow more and more frenzied, Andreas's quest for meaning leads him into mysticism. Haunted by dreams of the Virgin Mary, he purchases a rosary and drapes it reverently over his only photograph of Niels. At last, after Niels disappears, Andreas is finally released from his pain by the revelation that to love another being and suffer for him is to become acceptable to God. The reader of ''The Pious Dance'' may hunger at times for more causality and human interaction, conversations and personalities rather than gratuitous acts and poetic talk of essences. But compared to the psychopathic cool of the characters depicted by fashionable young writers today, Andreas's feverish sorrow, his religious yearnings, his anguished meditations seem not only touchingly innocent but even morally admirable.",1988-01-10T05:00:00+0000

His Hyatt Regency in Atlanta, completed in 1967, was the first postwar hotel with a central atrium, and it changed the nature of hotels everywhere, replacing the banal boxes of the Hiltons and Sheratons with the Portman trademarks of vast atrium spaces, fountains and glass-enclosed elevators. Mr. Portman spent the 1970's designing one hotel after another - each one, it seemed, bigger and showier than the one before. But his real dream, he had said for a long time, was to design a different kind of hotel, a hotel that would free him from the stereotype of the architect as producer of extravaganzas; it would also prove that he could design a small luxury hotel, a building that would rank as a serious work of architecture as well as set new standards for hotelkeeping.",1988-01-10T05:00:00+0000

Republicans and Democrats in Congress, the United Mine Workers union and now a number of the agency's top career safety engineers have accused it of going too far - of calculated laxity in enforcing safety standards in what has long been the most hazardous of all industrial workplaces.",1988-01-10T05:00:00+0000
us,NONFICTION,"OVERTIME: A Twentieth Century Sports Odyssey. By Peter Schwed. (Beaufort, $15.95.) Many young sports fans know the joy of settling onto a grandfatherly lap and listening to colorful tales from someone who professes to have seen Babe Ruth swing a bat or experienced the patriotic euphoria created by Jesse Owens in 1936. In this collection of childhood memories and homespun stories, Peter Schwed - the author of several books, a former editor at Simon & Schuster and a self-proclaimed ''sports freak'' who grew up in the 1920's - tries to be everyone's grandfather. A native of Long Island and a passionate club-level tennis player, he writes mainly of such personal passions as his family's devotion to Princeton sports, his father's penchant for horses, his brother's sense of humor and his own quest for a tennis haven. Mr. Schwed's sports knowledge, his admiration for athletic achievements and compassion for perhaps the most maligned of athletes, the defeated, are evident. But his meandering accounts of the intricacies of such sports as badminton and carom billiards, combined with his sometimes overly romantic style, dampen the impact of his reflections. The author also missed several opportunities to break new ground. Any tidbit concerning perhaps the most profound enigma in tennis history, Bill Tilden, would have been welcomed. But Mr. Schwed, who edited a book written by Mr. Tilden while the former player was serving a prison term for homosexually molesting a minor, dismisses the incident in one paragraph. Sports books of this nature can often provide useful reminders of some glorious past feats. Unfortunately, ''Overtime'' deteriorates rather quickly into a family album.",1988-01-10T05:00:00+0000
us,New & Noteworthy,"PERU, by Gordon Lish. (Scribners, $8.95.) A violent television newscast from Peru and a bump on the head jar a 50-year-old man into a remorseless recollection of a murder he committed as a child. Told in an obsessively circular manner, the novel ''increases speed to a kind of frenzy,'' Stephen Dobyns said in The Book Review in 1986. ''It is an amazing book - not attractive or likable but amazingly built, almost like a corkscrew.'' GOD'S FOOL: The Life and Times of Francis of Assisi, by Julien Green. Translated by Peter Heinegg. (Peren-nial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) With little more than hagiography and dubious legends to draw on, compiling an objective biography of a medieval ascetic is a daunting task. ''For every one statement of fact in the book there are two questions,'' Rachel Billington said here in 1985. Ultimately, though, the novelist and diarist Julien Green ''has persevered, building up the probabilities of Francis' life through the nearer certainties of historical background.'' The book is, she said, ''a labor of love.'' PARADISE, by Donald Barthelme. (Penguin, $6.95.) Three homeless lingerie models, who have given all their money to fight starvation in Africa, move in with Simon, a 53-year-old architect. Our reviewer, Elizabeth Jolley, said that although Donald Barthelme has written some of the most innovative contemporary fiction, ''Paradise'' still comes as ''a shock and a revelation.'' The novel is made up of a ''collision of brilliant moments [ that ] cannot be summed up,'' she said in 1986. THE BLIND WATCHMAKER: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design, by Richard Dawkins. (Norton, $7.95.) In his effort to show that God is not a necessary ingredient in the creation of life, the biologist Richard Dawkins programmed a personal computer to demonstrate a crude but visually spectacular form of evolution. ''Readers who are not outraged will be delighted,'' Michael T. Ghiselin said here in 1986. ANYWHERE BUT HERE, by Mona Simpson. (Vintage, $6.95.) Adele August flees her husband and a boring life in Wisconsin to drive her daughter to California while she's still young enough to become a child star. The two main characters are ''the most exasperating, insupportable and credible mother-daughter duo to make their presence felt in recent fiction,'' Le Anne Schreiber said here last year. She found the novel brilliant and funny as well as ''trying and unique.'' THE USES OF LITERATURE, by Italo Calvino. Translated by Patrick Creagh. (Helen and Kurt Wolff/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $6.95.) The subjects of these essays include Homer, Ovid, Balzac and Stendhal, but the book is as much about Italo Calvino's own inventive prose. ''One comes away from this collection of intellectually playful essays . . . inspired to go back and reread the body of his fiction,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times in 1986. SPHINX, by D. M. Thomas. (Washington Square/ Pocket Books, $4.95.) Toward the end of D. M. Thomas's third novel about poets and spies in modern Russia, a Welsh journalist reads (and disparages) a book called ''Ararat,'' which, in reality, was the first installment in Mr. Thomas's planned literary quartet. Last year, The Times's Walter Goodman called this self-referential effort ''a virtuoso performance.'' THE THIRD ROSE: Gertrude Stein and Her World, by John Malcolm Brinnin. (Merloyd Lawrence/Addison-Wesley, $14.95.) ''Civilization began with a rose,'' according to Gertrude Stein's inscrutable, much-parodied aphorism. ''Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.'' When this biography of the avant-garde writer was first published in 1959, our reviewer, Lloyd Frankenberg, stretched the floral metaphor even further. ''Without disturbing the separate roses,'' he wrote, ''the book gathers them into a handsome, wittily gallant bouquet.'' ANAGRAMS, by Lorrie Moore. (Penguin, $6.95.) Benna Carpenter, a solitary woman who is at various times a poet, a singer, an aerobics instructor and other things, has an imaginary friend, Eleanor, and an imaginary daughter, Georgianne. ''Benna loves Georgianne intensely,'' Carol Hill said here in 1986, ''and in this love, which is sustained only by words, we discover how much this novel is about language, about the power of sounds to slice through the darkness, and through meaning to join us.'' IF YOU WANT TO WRITE, by Brenda Ueland. (Graywolf Press, $6.50.) ''Everybody is talented, original and has something important to say,'' the writer and teacher Brenda Ueland writes in this book, which was first published in 1938. When it was reissued last year, one reviewer said its ''advice rings contemporary in its emphasis on centering or locating a self [ that ] can be relied upon to provide'' the voice necessary to create effective prose. ENTERING FIRE, by Rikki Ducornet. (City Lights, $6.95.) An amateur botanist who is a descendant of Cyrano de Bergerac develops new varieties of orchids in the Amazon, while his son becomes a Nazi sympathizer in France. ''Though the satirical ambitions of the novel are not fully realized,'' Oliver Conant said here last year, it ''displays a cheerfully gruesome audacity and an imagination both lively and bizarre.'' THE MORNING AFTER: American Successes and Excesses 1981-1986, by George F. Will. (Collier/Macmillan, $9.95.) When this collection of columns by the conservative pundit was published in 1986, our reviewer, Randall Rothenberg, found most of them too mechanical. But in the essays on his teen-age son, who was born with Down's syndrome, George F. Will's ''quiet anger can be affecting. . . . The columnist's assertion of his son's dignity and happiness, even in the face of governmental, judicial and journalistic arrogance, is nothing less than powerful.''",1988-01-10T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Goldfarb and other dissidents know they are hoodwinking themselves about the meaning of glasnost. Any Russian dictionary confirms that it means only ''publicity,'' and their hoped-for meaning of ''openness'' is derived from three Russian nouns - otkrovennost, pryamota and yavnost (''Smirnitsky and Muller,'' 1985).

us,FICTION,"BROWNSTONE FACADE. By Catherine M. Rae. (Joan Kahn/St. Martin's, $13.95.) Catherine M. Rae has concocted a leisurely mystery-romance in her first novel that fairly cries out for a long train ride during which to read it. She presents New York City in the winter of 1920 through a frame of more recent years: In 1981, a middle-aged man comes upon a disturbing memoir purportedly penned by his late aunt two decades before. ''I have decided,'' the nephew declares in a foreword, ''now that everyone directly concerned with the events of that winter has died, to make public what she wrote.'' Readers in whom such words produce a frisson of anticipatory pleasure will find the story that follows as civilized, as restrained yet as modestly bracing as a cup of Earl Grey tea. Early in this century, the Upper East Side brownstone of the title was the home of the Millerton family: Papa, Mamma, Carrie, Alfred, Tom, Will, our narrator Grace and her younger sister Rose. The winter of 1920 finds Rose absent and unmentionable within the family, Grace still mourning the fiance she lost in the Great War, Alfred at last pulling out from under his mysterious bankruptcy, and Mamma starting to ail. Unaccountable noises in the house lead to a story of blackmail, madness and death - which sounds lurid enough but is presented in an extremely sedate style.

Interestingly, this reflects the crux of the problem. A lasting peaceful soluton will be found only through an agreement between the Sri Lankan Government and Tamil guerrillas. Failure to do so will only strengthen the Tamils' resolve to create a separate Tamil nation and will increase the agony of an already bleeding nation. The only beneficiary of the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement is India, which gained a strong foothold in Sri Lanka. EVA S. ANTON Chicago",1988-01-10T05:00:00+0000

On the way to the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) charted in this book, we confront hoards of electrons, protons, neutrons, mesons and their discoverers, rushing by like billiard players burdened with eight-balls, positively and negatively charged. Using a peculiar mix of scientific and lay terminology, Barry Parker, the author of two books on science and a professor of physics and astronomy at Idaho State University, has produced a dandy particle-theoretical physics guidebook describing the quest to understand the universe and all its parts. The story ranges from dullish John Dalton surmising the atom in 1808 to physicists rewriting the Big Bang theory right now. The book should be consumed quickly, before it ages. Dates would have been useful, but never mind, because finally, here we have clear explanations of the action in particle accelerators (CERN, SLAC, FERMILAB), and reasons for the clamor for more powerful versions. And what interesting questions the GUT quest raises. Is there really a shadow world? Why do fundamental particles collect in threes? Are those really cosmic superstrings glowing near the center of our galaxy? From between the lines emerge some illuminating views of physicists struggling (and battling) toward truth, glory and first publication honors. A caveat: The subject matter is sometimes arcane. Yet the book creates a strange anticipation. Perhaps this science and this story is, indeed, physics for poets. IRIS POLISKI",1988-01-10T05:00:00+0000

The play's setting has been moved from Athens to funkier Brazilian climes (turn-of-the-century Bahia), with the bossa nova beat of an offstage band often overriding the poetry. And there's a harmless, old-time liberal political agenda. By transforming the young lovers into starchy European colonials and the fairies into jungle spiritualists, this ''Dream'' is less a vision of romantic emancipation than an outsider's gaga celebration of the liberating culture of the third world.",1988-01-13T05:00:00+0000

Both countries also agreed to intensify efforts to halt the dollar's decline. The Japanese leader also made several conciliatory gestures on the trade disputes that have marred bilateral relations. [ Page A1. ] The dollar's value swung sharply, apparently influenced by central bank intervention and a variety of rumors. In New York, gold prices fell slightly. [ D20. ] West Germany's G.N.P. grew only 1.7 percent last year, compared with 2.5 percent in 1986, Bonn confirmed. [ D2. ] COMPANIES Texaco said the U.S. might seek $6.5 billion in back taxes as part of the company's bankruptcy proceedings. Tax lawyers said that would represent the largest corporate tax case ever. [ A1. ] Batus offered $4.2 billion for the Farmers Group, the nation's seventh-largest property and casualty insurer. Farmers Group said it would consider the $60-a-share proposal.

Apple is also revamping its line of laser printers. [ D1. ] Ashton-Tate and Microsoft plan a joint software product that manages data bases on computer networks. Again, the goal is to compete more potently with I.B.M.

Trump wants a stake in Federated Stores and has asked for U.S. clearance to buy at least $15 million of shares.

[ D4. ] Prime Computer sweetened its offer for Computervision, to $15 a share, or a total of $433.5 million. [ D4. ] ECONOMY U.S. oil production dropped 4.5 percent last year to the lowest level since 1977, and demand rose 1.8 percent. As a result, the U.S. had to raise its imports to 6.5 million barrels a day.

The Bullets have won all three of their home games since Wes Unseld took over as head coach 12 days ago. Washington broke the game open midway through the third quarter. Over a span of 5 minutes 22 seconds, the Bullets outscored the Bucks, 20-5, opening a 93-74 lead. Malone, who made his first 10 shots in the game, scored 7 points in the burst. Malone's first basket of the game gave him 20,709 points in his 12 seasons in the N.B.A., and moved him past George Gervin into 11th place on the league's career scoring list. He finished the evening at 20,743, 137 behind Bob Pettit in 10th place. Malone is 13th on the combined National Basketball Association-American Basketball Association scoring list with 22,914, trailing Elgin Baylor, No. 12, by 235. The Bullets got 25 points from Bernard King. (AP) Cleveland 91, Chicago 88: Craig Ehlo scored 4 points in overtime and Brad Daugherty added 3 as Cleveland defeated Chicago in Richfield, Ohio. Ehlo sank two foul shots with five seconds remaining to give the Cavaliers the final margin before Michael Jordan's 3-point attempt bounced off the rim with two seconds left. A foul shot by Jordan, who scored 28 points, tied the game, 82-82, with 18 seconds left in regulation time. (AP) N.H.L. Flyers 3, Sabres 1: Dave Brown scored two goals last night in Philadelphia as the Flyers ended Buffalo's six-game winning streak. The Flyers returned to first place in the Patrick Division, 1 point ahead of Washington and the Islanders. Brown's first goal gave the Flyers a 2-1 lead with 1:55 remaining in the first period. He skated the length of the ice and pushed the puck past the fallen goalie, Jacques Cloutier. After a scoreless second period, Brown followed his own shot and beat Cloutier over his gloved hand for a 3-1 lead 56 seconds into the final period. Kjell Samuelsson gave Philadelphia a 1-0 lead at 13:35 of the first period on a slap shot from the right face-off circle. Buffalo tied the game 61 seconds later when Christian Ruuttu knocked a rebound past Ron Hextall. (AP) Figure Skating Witt Captures Title: Katarina Witt of East Germany, skating to ''Carmen,'' won the European women's figure skating championship yesterday in Prague for the sixth consecutive time. Witt tied Sonja Henie's mark of six straight titles by easily winning the long program, worth 50 percent of the total score. Her two top challengers, Kira Ivanova and Anna Kondrashova of the Soviet Union, both fell during their long programs and were second and third for the second consecutive year. Witt landed four triples - two in combinations - in a four-minute program. She earned two perfect marks of 6.0 for artistic impression, and mostly 5.8's and 5.9's, for the routine she hopes will carry her to a second Olympic title next month at Calgary. In other events, Soviet defending champions were leading. Aleksandr Fadeyev led in the men's event after the compulsories, while Natalya Bestemianova and Andrei Bukin led in ice dancing. (AP) Skiing Swiss Wins Downhill: Michela Figini of Switzerland dominated the field to win a World Cup downhill event yesterday in Zinal, Switzerland, leaving Karen Percy of Canada nearly one second behind. Figini, the 1984 Olympic downhill champion, was timed in 1:55.16 minutes for her third victory this season. Percy, who fractured a thumb two weeks ago, finished in 1:56.10 as she turned in her best finish in four World Cup seasons. Petra Kronberger, a 19-year-old Austrian, came in a surprise third in 1:56.39 over the 9,707-foot course. Starting 37th, she edged the defending World Cup champion, Maria Walliser, by 13 one-hundredths of a second. The next nine women finished within one second in a tight battle for World Cup points. Figini pushed her total to 146 points after 15 events. Walliser moved into second with 102 points. Blanca Fernandez-Ochoa of Spain slipped to third with 101. (AP)",1988-01-15T05:00:00+0000

Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. ARIZONA 206, 206 East 60th Street (838-0440) - **(Nov. 15, 1985) The ultimate winter fantasy is to dine near a fireplace, and finding such a setting in the city is a search worthy of any explorer. The glowing hearth at this narrow East Side restaurant is only one reason to stop by. Virtually all the recipes demonstrate how appealing California- and Southwestern-style cooking can be. Appetizers include flour tortilla with crab meat and salsa verde and goat cheese ravioli with Anaheim and ancho chili sauces. Main-course options are chili-rubbed chicken with sauteed broccoli rabe; chile relleno with sauteed pork adobado, and grilled swordfish with chayote tomatillo. Dinner entrees $19 to $23. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 11:30 P.M.; Sundays, 6 to 11 P.M. BLACK SHEEP, 344 West 11th Street (242-1010) - *(April 22, 1983) The pleasantly romantic atmosphere of this convivial bistro is enhanced by the lace curtains and fireplace. The kitchen style can be best described as country cooking from France. To start, you might choose the country pate made of chicken, pork and liver, or a seasonal soup. Entree options include duckling cooked two ways: the leg is braised with Armagnac and the boneless breast is grilled; marinated and grilled leg of lamb with herbs, and Norwegian salmon fillet steamed and served over noodles with smoked salmon, dill and cream sauce. Five-course prix-fixe dinner $23 to $31, depending on entree. Fridays through Sundays, 6 P.M. to midnight. DEVON HOUSE, 1316 Madison Avenue, at 93d Street (860-8294) - **(May 24, 1985) A century-old fireplace graces one of the formal dining rooms at this patrician East Side restaurant. The food is essentially Continental with a dash of West Indian salsa sprinkled in. You might start with escargot in garlic-tinged cream sauce or a soup of leeks, lettuce and spinach in chicken broth. For a main dish, options include broiled fillet of salmon, marinated and braised in stock, white wine and Jamaican peppers; roasted baby pheasant with red wine sauce and sage, and filet of beef in a zippy Pickapeppa sauce with green peppercorns. Entrees $24.50 to $29.50. Fridays through Sundays, 6 to 11 P.M. JANE STREET SEAFOOD CAFE, 31 Eighth Avenue, at Jane Street (243-9237) - *(May 8, 1987) A working fireplace and brick and natural wood walls provide the backdrop at this sleeves-up fish house. Better appetizers are the brittle fried zucchini sticks and succulent steamed littleneck clams. For a main dish, you can usually rely on the crispy golden-brown fried fillet of sole and the poached fillet of king salmon with a mild dill sauce. Also recommended is a frequent special called sole Portuguese, which is a fillet served atop a crest of garlic-loaded tomatoes and mushrooms. Entrees $11.95 to $20. Fridays and Saturdays, 5:30 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, 4 to 10 P.M. RENE PUJOL, 321 West 51st Street (246-3023) - *(Sept. 26, 1986) One of the few surviving family-run French restaurants in the theater district is this one with its stucco and timber dining rooms and working fireplace. For starters, the duck terrine is rustic and tasty; and you can't go wrong with the intense old-fashioned onion soup. For an entree, you might choose rack of lamb with pan juices and assorted tiny vegetables; pink sauteed veal kidneys in red wine sauce, or Dover sole meuniere. Five-course prix-fixe dinner $26 to $30, depending on entree. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5 to 11:30 P.M.; Saturdays, 5 to 11:30 P.M.; closed Sundays.

If so, that institution should offer a tenured post to Henry Harper, the classics professor who is the hero of ''Another Antigone,'' the new play by A. R. Gurney Jr. at Playwrights Horizons. In the delightful performance of George Grizzard, Harper is crusty yet passionate about learning, a determined foe of academic fads and inflated grades, a mesmerizing lecturer who can make throwaway jokes about the Bacchae.

The uncertainty has led people to postpone purchases, and indeed the outlook remains clouded as the Federal Reserve adjusts for changing economic conditions. Generally speaking, an economic slowdown would translate into lower interest rates, while a widening of the trade deficit would destabilize the dollar and force the central bank to push interest rates higher. But analysts say that for consumers, at least, the rates now in effect should prevail for several months; a good time, in other words, to make plans.

The Dow Jones industrial average gained 39.96 points, to close at 1,956.07. 35 The financial dealings of a Dole aide concerned other people working on Senator Bob Dole's Presidential campaign.

The new requests include more money for the space station and space shuttle improvements, according to an aviation industry magazine. 9 A tag sale at Michael Deaver's office was held to raise money for Mr. Deaver's reportedly million-dollar legal and medical bills.

Konroyd will sit out the Islanders' next four games, starting this evening against the Devils, for his part in a stick-swinging scuffle with Cunneyworth last Tuesday night. Cunneyworth drew a three-game suspension, a lighter sentence, according to O'Neil, because Konroyd swung first and acted more severely. But there was nothing light about the penalty Cunneyworth drew for striking Michael Thelven of Boston on the helmet and knocking down the Bruin defenseman during an altercation last Dec. 29. That stunning blow brought a five-game suspension, meaning that the Penguins will lose Cunneyworth for eight straight games.",1988-01-16T05:00:00+0000

Walliser trailed Figini, the World Cup leader, on the steep first half of the course but picked up speed to finish seven-hundredths of a second ahead. The winning time was 1 minute 52.17 seconds.

Both verdicts were reversed by appeals courts because the prosecution suppressed critical evidence. Mr. Carter's cause was championed in the mid-1970's by civil rights leaders, politicians and entertainers, and Bob Dylan recorded ''Hurricane,'' a popular ballad depicting Mr. Carter as a man unjustly accused.

Although the play takes place in Athens and the forest beyond, it is an Athens of the mind, and the fairies can be relocated to almost any fictive environment - in contrast to the histories, which, by definition, are so rooted in specificity. The tragedies and many of the other comedies also happen in clearly defined courts, battlefields and forests. Although they certainly can be relocated, they are more indigenous than ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' which, with its extraordinary mythic qualities, can assume an even greater universality. A director can, in other words, imagine his own ''Dream'' - or nightmare - while the heart of the play remains immutable.",1988-01-17T05:00:00+0000

His new book, NEW YORK: A Physical History (Atheneum, $29.95), is as opinionated as that earlier volume, more of a commentary than a history, although it has dates and names in abundance (including such tidbits as crediting the high-powered firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill with the design of a small building in Times Square that now houses Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs). The book is organized by categories - water supply, transportation, immigration, monuments and so on - and thus tends to jump around chronologically. In his criticism, Mr. White hews to fairly conventional esthetic orthodoxy but serves up some surprises, such as his opinion that 240 Central Park South ''ranks as one of the great apartment houses.'' He views the city's development through phenomena that might at first seem remote or arcane. For example, he links the Irish potato famine of the 1840's to the enlargement of private residences from Federal-style intimacy to Renaissance Revival grandeur, fueled by the ''vast labor pool for domestic service.'' He sees the change in the skyline after World War II occurring largely because ''air conditioning made possible interior offices far from a window, and great fat boxes were plunked down among the finials.'' This book is an appropriate accompaniment to a period in which physical development is a hot topic and a subject of major importance.",1988-01-17T05:00:00+0000

The painting caused quite a stir at the Armory Show of 1913 in New York, owing to the liberties it took with the human form. The artist's adaptation of Cubist and Futurist ideas served to represent three-dimensional form in movement upon a two-dimensional surface. The work foreshadowed these CAT-scan-derived images in the sense that Duchamp freed the artist from having to mentally integrate numerous separate images of the body. It is as if an artistic representation evolved into a therapeutic tool. CHARLES D. COLLINS Rochester",1988-01-17T05:00:00+0000
us,NONFICTION,"A DESIGN FOR LIVING. By Lillian Langseth-Christensen. (Viking, $18.95.) Today, Josef Hoffmann is revered by design enthusiasts the world over. But at the beginning of this century the Viennese architect, one of the founders of the Wiener Werkstatte movement, had only a coterie of avant-garde admirers. One of these was a 10-year-old girl who was introduced to his spare designs in a German magazine, Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration (German Art and Decoration), that came to her parents' home in New York, where their wood-paneled library boasted ''a fringed moose-hide hassock, on a grizzly bear skin.'' Over 70 years later, Lillian Langseth-Christensen, now a decorator and a food writer, has written an engaging memoir, illustrated with personal snapshots, of her acquaintance with the man whose rooms and objects were to have such a revolutionary effect on future generations. ''Nothing ever lay about,'' the writer recalls. ''J. Hoffmann, whom I began to think of as a man, did not hold with clutter.'' In the annals of interior design, that may be one of the most memorable of understatements. At 14, Ms. Langseth-Christensen convinced her parents that she should study with Hoffmann. Her meeting with the painter Gustav Klimt and his cat continues the chronicle of a privileged and cultured life in Vienna. The author's perceptive visual and esthetic memory - she describes Hoffmann as ''a three-piece mountain of pepper and salt homespun. . . . Black and white were his two colors. They were all he needed'' -reminds us that there isn't any substitute for being there, and for being able to remember and write it all down so well.",1988-01-17T05:00:00+0000

The building is the new headquarters of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., the communications conglomerate, and the place is the neighborhood of West 66th and West 67th Streets off Central Park West, just north of Lincoln Center. It is not a typical part of town by any means. Although West 66th Street contains a fairly uneven mix of industrial architecture (much of it housing other facilities of the ABC television network) and new high-rise apartment buildings, West 67th Street is a remarkable enclave of exceptionally gracious early-20th-century apartment buildings, many of which contain double-height studios originally constructed to house artists. This is a place like no other, a self-contained village as much as it is a New York City block.

Everything was clean, orderly, an office seemingly poised for an important meeting of Wall Street dealmakers. But E. F. Hutton had cut its last deal. Slate gray and set in a haggard face, Mr. Rittereiser's eyes flashed with anger and bitterness as the 49-year-old chief executive recounted his version of one of the most tangled tales of intrigue to hit Wall Street in years: the messy, ultimately destructive, battle for control of the company that had once been one of America's proudest and most profitable brokerage houses.

Information may be to the age of technology as oil was to the industrial era: the fuel running the world's economies. David H. Brandin, president of Strategic Technologies Inc., and Michael A. Harrison, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrate forcefully that those who control information will be the new world leaders. The Western defense system, the stock market, telecommunications, air traffic control and even competitive manufacturing are now highly dependent on rapid, computerized information and more dependents are being added yearly. Information technology is worth at least $100 billion a year and is growing ''beyond our ability to measure it.'' Not surprisingly, the United States and Japan are the two major players in this competitive field, with a balkanized Europe lagging and Korea closing in fast. Less well known is the rise of Malaysia as a producer of integrated circuits and the Soviet Union's lag in digital communications because the K.G.B. eliminated direct distance dialing in 1982 to facilitate monitoring of telephone calls. One of the book's oft-repeated refrains is that the United States is in serious trouble, with 10 percent of its population functionally illiterate, and the lack of a coordinated Government and industrial policy. The authors virtually omit some players, such as Israel. Nonetheless, the book identifies many important issues, including the need for better software to make different computers compatible and the need for a Cabinet-level technology department in the United States. Over all, it is a worthwhile introduction to the field of ''knowledge capital.''",1988-01-17T05:00:00+0000

''I am a 58-year-old provincial,'' writes the narrator of William Trevor's slim novella, the latest in the Harper Short Novel series. ''I have no children. I have never married.'' The person responsible for this state of affairs is Frau Messinger, an Englishwoman who finds refuge from World War II with her elderly German husband near the Irish town of Cloverhill. The great events of the far-off war and Cloverhill's distance from Dublin make the town a backwater twice over, its tedium double-dyed. Soon the glamorous new arrival begins to rely on young Harry, the narrator, to run errands for her and, just as important, to listen, spellbound, as she relates the story of her life. For a teen-age boy in oppressively dull circumstances, destined to toil in his father's lumberyard, Frau Messinger is a dangerous dose of romance, almost a screen goddess in her perfection and unattainability. The cinematic suggestions become explicit when Herr Messinger builds Cloverhill's first movie house, names it the Alexandra after his wife, and finds Harry a job there. Some 40 years later, we learn, Harry has taken possession of it - or vice versa. Like Miss Havisham's wedding cake, the boarded-up theater has succumbed to rodents and rot. Its proprietor has become the curator of a fantasy or, as he describes himself, ''the ghost of an interlude.'' Elusive and elliptical, ''Nights at the Alexandra'' seems a touch perfunctory, a sketch rather than a fully realized drama. But the noted Irish novelist and short-story writer's prose - austere, distanced and precise - casts the familiar spell.",1988-01-17T05:00:00+0000

Lynch's trainer, Doug Peterson, and a United States ski official, Jim Page, were initially barred for the same period as Lynch. . . .

The restructuring portion of the charges amounts to $82 million. The company said the 1987 loss reflected the impact of a previously announced decision in the second quarter to increase the reserve for possible credit losses by $1.7 billion. The 1986 net income was after an extraordinary charge of $33.5 million in the fourth quarter, resulting from the repurchase of high-coupon debt securities. The results for the latest quarter also include a gain of $35.7 million, or $23.5 million after taxes, on the sale of a 20 percent interest in Banco Manufacturers Hanover (Portugal), S.A., and a gain of $25.9 million, or $14.1 million after taxes, from the sale of aircraft previously on lease to corporate customers. The 1986 fourth quarter results included a gain of $44.5 million, $29.3 million after taxes, from the sale of properties in New York City. The company said that earlier in 1987 it realized a gain of $55 million, or $29.4 million after taxes, by recognizing a portion of the excess value in its pension fund, and a gain of $29.2 million, or $12.8 million after taxes, from the sale of two residential properties in Tokyo. The full year 1986 results also included a gain of $172 million, or $117 million after taxes, from the sale of the company's mortgage banking subsidiary.",1988-01-20T05:00:00+0000

A second contractor says that the plaster may have separated only in some areas, and that if he tapes the cracks, smooths out the plaster and inserts long screws into the beams, the ceiling will hold. What do you recommend? A. The second procedure is a gamble. I would favor complete replastering because there is a good chance the wood lath is rotted and needs replacing. Also, if the plaster has separated in one place, it probably is loose in other places. Q. I want to change the color of the ceramic tile on my bathroom walls and floor. Is there an effective method of painting tile? A. You can paint ceramic tile with a two-part epoxy enamel, or you can use a good grade of alkyd enamel, although this probably will not last as long. Either way, you must carefully clean the tiles and the grout or the paint will peel. If you use an alkyd enamel, first use a shellac-based primer like Enamelac or BIN. Remember that the paint on the floor tiles will wear quickly, and you will have to repaint periodically. Q. I want to paint the brick at the entrance of my house to change the color. Does the brick have to be treated first, and should I use a special paint? A. You can paint brick with a latex masonry paint made for exterior use. Just be sure the brick is clean first. Painting brick, however, is seldom a good idea because peeling and flaking become a problem. Brick manufacturers do not recommend painting, as the paint traps moisture inside the brick.",1988-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Rushing to N.F.L.?,"Craig Heyward, Pitt's all-America tailback, has not attended classes this semester and has told friends he wants to play in the National Football League next season, according to published reports. Heyward, second in the nation in rushing last season with 1,655 yards, flew to Washington last night to meet with an agent, Bruce Allen, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported in today's editions. National Collegiate Athletic Association rules prohibit a player from having any contact with an agent while he has college eligibility remaining. The 5-foot-11-inch, 284-pound Heyward, who rushed for at least 100 yards in all 12 of Pitt's game last season, would not be eligible for the N.F.L. college draft this April under N.C.A.A. rules because he has one year of eligibility remaining and has not graduated. However, if the N.C.A.A. were to declare Heyward ineligible, he could be placed in a special supplemental draft. Cris Carter, a wide receiver for Ohio State, joined the N.F.L. last September under similar circumstances. Several N.F.L. scouts said Heyward, who was a redshirt junior last season, would be a high first-round draft pick if he were in the April draft. The Post-Gazette reported Heyward had told friends for several weeks he wanted to turn pro. The newspaper said Heyward did poorly in his fall semester classes and has not attended winter-term classes, which began Jan. 6. Heyward finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy balloting behind four seniors.",1988-01-23T05:00:00+0000

The policy is designed to end the wave of protests in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that began in early December. Page 1 A curfew on an Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem was imposed by the Israeli police, who invoked emergency powers in the city for the first time since East Jerusalem was annexed in 1967. 6 A European armaments plan intended to maintain the military balance on that continent was endorsed by top Pentagon officials. The plan would be effective after the withdrawal of nuclear missiles under a new treaty. 1 A Paris and Bonn military council was created along with the legal basis for a French-German brigade on the 25th anniversary of their friendship treaty. They also unveiled an advisory council to coordinate economic policies. 3 Sandinista demonstrators attacked and broke up a meeting at which speakers were demanding amnesty for prisoners. Police officers stood by as the demonstrators threw rocks at relatives of the prisoners. 5 The amount of aid to the contras that President Reagan will request will be postponed until the last minute because the situation in Washington and Central America is so fluid, White House officials said. 5 A second Haitian opposition leader was detained at the airport in what many Haitians and diplomats said appeared to be a Government effort to divert attention from the presidential elections last Sunday. 5 The head of England's miners' union, Arthur Scargill, is preaching his message of working-class struggle in the vernacular of Marxism while the rest of the British trade union movement is headed toward moderation. 3 Conservative leaders in Taiwan have sought to install the 90-year-old Madame Chiang Kai-shek as chairman of the Nationalist Party after the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo last week. But specialists said the plan is unlikely to succeed. 28 Caracas Journal: A President and a Liaison 4 P.L.O. is said to delay on setting up a government in exile 6 U.N. chief asks action on Arab-Israel conflict 6 NATIONAL 7-9, 50 A law on 'independent counsels' was struck down by a divided Federal appellate panel.

The company is to develop a billion-dollar computer complex to simulate strategic defense systems and evaluate whether it is technically possible to repel a nuclear attack. 1 7 baseball players can be free agents without relinquishing their existing contracts. The ruling was made by the arbitrator who found that baseball club owners acted in collusion against free agents. 1 Extensions for illegal aliens who, for reasons beyond their control, are unable to meet the May 4 deadline to apply for amnesty under the new immigration law may be granted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, officials said. 7 Mayors expressed frustration and anger over the way they think Washington has treated cities for the last eight years. But some were cautiously hopeful that there would soon be changes. 7 About 50,000 anti-abortion protesters demonstrated in Washington on the 15th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing the procedure. 50 Gary Hart sought to rebut charges of financial irregularities in his campaign, offering details he said showed that neither he nor his campaign organization had knowingly violated Federal election law. 9 Students confronted George Bush with questions seeking explanations for several changes in his past positions and on his role in the Iran-contra affair.

He said Government charges of jury tampering had persuaded him a mistrial was required. 1 The M.T.A banned smoking on all Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter Railroad trains. Railroad officials said that with the ban, cars would be cleaner and cost less to maintain. 29 In a Brooklyn anti-drug drive, Muslims with walkie-talkies, some of them armed off-duty correction and police officers, have begun patrolling the Bedford-Stuyvesant section. 29 Harassment of two witnesses for the prosecution was charged by a Queens prosecutor in the case of the burning of a house intended for foster-care infants. He said the actions included sending anonymous threatening letters. 31 Four bids to buy The New York Post by publishers and real-estate developers were submitted as a deadline for offers closed.

The designs of the universe radiate from her head extending over the sleeves and bodice,'' Walter F. Morris Jr. writes in LIVING MAYA (Abrams, $40). During 14 years of research, this American anthropologist found parallels between the diamond patterning woven into intricately brocaded blouses of contemporary Mayas in Chiapas, Mexico, and the fabric designs depicted 1,200 years ago in the art of their ancestors, the Classic Mayas. He believes that the symbolic signs reiterate the same sacred concepts: the path of the sun from east to west, toads symbolic of fertility, and the Earthlord, master of rain and the world of the dead. The weavers told Mr. Morris that female saints, who appear in their dreams, are the source of the design differences that distinguish the various communities. To weave a perfect huipil, it must be well dreamt, they say. Scenes of fiestas and daily life, in the stunning photographs by Jeffrey J. Foxx, are juxtaposed with illustrations of their vibrantly colored garments.",1988-01-24T05:00:00+0000

Though this book, first published in Britain in 1952, includes a murderer on the run, a wronged woman and a revenge-obsessed policeman, it is not really a mystery or a thriller. It is, rather, a charming, old-fashioned novel of life in a remote section of the Scottish Highlands right after World War II. Old Sandy has retired from the sea to the croft that belonged to his ancestors, there to live with his dogs, hens and cow. But suddenly both his serenity and his self-sufficiency are shattered by the arrival of Nicol Menzies, the village policeman, as he searches for Allen Innes, a young man who has just killed Menzies' brother in a brawl over a woman. Sandy knows and likes Innes and decides to help him escape the ''blood hunt.'' But Sandy's efforts on Innes's behalf involve him far more deeply than he ever expected in the lives of his neighbors, whom he - and we - come to see as ''quiet decent people. . . . The salt of the earth. And the earth needs its salt.'' Like these characters, ''Blood Hunt'' is a quiet, decent novel, one of the more than two dozen Neil M. Gunn (1891-1973) wrote about the fishermen, farmers and villagers of the Highlands and their struggle not only to adapt to the stern demands of its land and sea but also to strike the correct balance between individual freedom and a duty to society. Gunn's work is not well known in the United States, an oversight that will be corrected as his new American publisher introduces the novels here. They offer readers a chance to recapture a world that, to our loss, has all but disappeared.",1988-01-24T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE LOCKED ROOM: The New York Trilogy, Volume Three, by Paul Auster. (Penguin, $5.95.) In the latest of Paul Auster's self-reflexive, metafictional whodunits, a biographer turns detective and sets out to solve the literary and linguistic mysteries surrounding the disappearance of a friend. Last year our reviewer, Stephen Schiff, said he had found the author's previous two novels annoyingly austere, but added that in ''The Locked Room,'' his ''philosophical asides now sound heartfelt instead of stentorian and his descents into semiological Angst feel genuinely anguished and near.'' BEARING THE CROSS: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, by David J. Garrow. (Vintage, $10.95.) The victories of the civil rights movement were not Martin Luther King Jr.'s alone, but this biography ''reminds us anew that his leadership was the indispensable ingredient,'' Howell Raines said here in 1986. ''Through tireless interviewing, through skillful use of the Freedom of Information Act and, not least, through his principled refusal to submit to F.B.I. entreaties to suppress details of the bureau's spying on King, Mr. Garrow has provided the fundament of fact on which future King biographies must rest.'' To coincide with his birthday this month, Mentor/New American Library is reissuing another classic King biography, LET THE TRUMPET SOUND: THE LIFE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., by Stephen B. Oates ($4.95.), which won the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book Award. In 1982, Eric Foner said in The Book Review that the author was especially good at ''tracing the origins of King's ideas in his early upbringing and preparation for the ministry.'' The same publisher is also reprinting King's own book, WHY WE CAN'T WAIT ($2.95), which was first published in 1964. FOE, by J. M. Coetzee. (King Penguin, $6.95.) The South African novelist adds a new character, Susan Barton, to Daniel Defoe's story of Robinson Crusoe. She returns to civilization from the desert isle and entreats Defoe to immortalize what (without literary embellishment) was actually a rather boring experience. The novel ''illuminates the fiction-making process and the relationship between reality and art'' and is ''a finely honed testament to its author's intelligence, imagination and skill,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times last year. THE WISE MEN: Six Friends and the World They Made: Acheson, Bohlen, Harriman, Kennan, Lovett, McCloy, by Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $12.95.) By interweaving the life stories of six of the most influential members of the country's foreign policy elite, Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas show how human volition can reshape the geopolitical landscape. In 1986 our reviewer, Ronald Steel, called the book ''a fascinating, informative and ultimately disquieting study.'' THE BOOK OF EBENEZER LE PAGE, by G. B. Edwards. (Moyer Bell, $8.95.) Published posthumously, this story of life in the provincial Channel Islands is ''one of the best novels of our time,'' Guy Davenport said in The Book Review in 1981. ''I know of no description of happiness in modern literature equal to the one that ends this novel.'' TOMBEE: Portrait of a Cotton Planter, by Theodore Rosengarten. With the Journal of Thomas B. Chaplin (1822-1890), edited by Theodore Rosengarten and Susan W. Walker. (McGraw-Hill, $12.95.) The historian Theodore Rosengarten - whose previous book, ''All God's Dangers: The Life of Nate Shaw,'' a biography of a black sharecropper, won a National Book Award in 1974 - re-creates the life of an unsuccessful plantation owner who is ruined by the Civil War. ''By deftly combining the inner world of an individual, the performance of a social class and the material conditions of community life, Mr. Rosengarten bares a society that is long gone but that still haunts a racially rent America,'' Eugene D. Genovese said here in 1986. THE JUDGE'S STORY, by Charles Morgan. (Ballantine, $3.50.) To save a man from prison, a retired judge sacrifices his material well-being, showing that money doesn't really matter so much after all. In 1947, our reviewer, Richard Sullivan, called this novel a ''quiet, intense drama'' that ''combines a theme of absolute importance with . . . accomplished skill in story-telling.'' THE RISE AND FALL OF AN AMERICAN ARMY: U.S. Ground Forces in Vietnam, 1965-1973, by Shelby L. Stanton. (Dell, $4.95.) Written by a military historian who served in Vietnam, this detailed history of the war is often superficial in its analysis, Eliot A. Cohen said here in 1985, but at its best ''it gives the reader a terrifyingly graphic description of combat,'' and it ''will stand for years to come as an indispensable resource for students of the war and the American defense establishment that has survived it.'' O BEULAH LAND, by Mary Lee Settle. (Scribner, $8.95.) In the days before the Civil War, Jonathan Lacey struggles to carve from the Virginia wilderness an estate idealistically called Beulah. ''Remarkable for its inclusiveness, this historical novel is head and shoulders above most of its contemporaries,'' Charlotte Capers said here in 1956. The same publisher has also reissued PRISONS ($8.95), which, published 17 years later, now forms the first volume of what has come to be called the ''Beulah Quintet.'' THE INLAND ISLAND, by Josephine Johnson. (Sandstone/Ohio State University, $8.95.) From the seclusion of an abandoned farm in Ohio, Josephine Johnson writes about the ills of contemporary society. When this chronicle was published in 1969, our reviewer, Edward Abbey, called it ''terse and tense and starkly clear. . . . There is hardly a prosaic line or a smoggy thought in the whole book.''",1988-01-24T05:00:00+0000

It has lain unproduced since 1946, but three songs from it were sung Friday night at Alice Tully Hall to kick off the Juilliard School's annual Focus Festival of 20th-century music.

Telefunken recorded other literature, too, of course, and while early-music enthusiasts made up a large part of its market in the United States, many buyers also regarded the label almost as an audiophile line, for it had built a reputation for magnificent LP pressings.

Though she and her all-American husband have a cute little girl and a lovely apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, when Cullen goes to sleep at night she dreams of Rondua, a land of strange beasts and quests and hidden dangers that could be straight out of C. S. Lewis's Narnia chronicles. And when she wakes, she discovers that she has an unsettling ability to, well, zap people. Clearly this is not your ordinary novel. Jonathan Carroll, an American writer who lives in Austria, juxtaposes the richly drawn dreamscape of Rondua with Cullen's significantly less interesting daily existence: she takes walks around the neighborhood, chats with her upstairs neighbor and contemplates an affair with a movie director. Gradually the dream world seeps into the real one. Unfortunately, the novel's psychological insights are all too obvious (Cullen's companion in Rondua is a young boy, the son she would have had if she hadn't undergone an abortion several years earlier) and the writing is flat, the characterizations superficial. The surrounding plot, such as it is, is meant to be a thriller in which a homicidal young boy is obsessed with Cullen. But the final climactic scene comes as no surprise. Mr. Carroll does let himself go when it comes to Rondua, a land of salmon-colored pyramids, yellow waves and an enormous dog named Mr. Tracy; here Cullen crosses the Plain of Forgotten Machines, sees a circus where memories perform and encounters the villainous Jack Chili. Rondua is the product of an unfettered, un-self-conscious imagination; it's too bad the rest of the novel doesn't measure up.",1988-01-24T05:00:00+0000

The appearance of the poem, ''Bukharin's Widow,'' was likened by Kremlin watchers to a nail out of Bukharin's historical coffin. A few months after Mr. Yevtushenko celebrated Bukharin, the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, confirmed in a speech the official righteousness of the poet's judgment, speaking favorably of Bukharin. Now, experts suggest, Bukharin's official rehabilitation may soon occur.",1988-01-24T05:00:00+0000

us,TALE OF TWO TOWERS ON BOSTON BOYLSTON STREET,"There are times, occasion-ally, when the cumbersome, irritating, ponderous and essentially irrational process of public review of large building projects yields positive results, and this saga of two towers on Boylston Street is one of them. It is a long story that can be summarized like this: In 1982, the New England (formerly the New England Life Insurance Company), along with the Gerald D. Hines Interests development company, commissioned Philip Johnson and John Burgee to design a new headquarters for a site in Boston's Back Bay. The architects proposed a building consisting of twin 25-story slabs topped by arches, which was intended to look something like a 19th-century crystal palace stretched out into a skyscraper, but to many people this odd form looked more like a pair of 1930's Wurlitzer jukeboxes.",1988-01-24T05:00:00+0000

They were agents of the Soviet secret police - then called the N.K.V.D., now the K.G.B. - operating in a special unit dedicated to terrorism. The unit's existence became known through a series of sensational incidents 50 years ago - including the assassination in Switzerland in September 1937 of Ignace Reiss, an N.K.V.D. defector; the kidnapping from the streets of Paris of a White Russian general, Yevgeni Karlovich Miller, only weeks after Reiss's death; and the murder in a Paris hospital of the son of Leon Trotsky, Lev Sedov, in 1938. Though centered in Paris, the group's tentacles reached into Spain, where an anti-Stalinist leftist, Andreu (Andres) Nin, disappeared from police custody in June 1937. And in 1940 the leading member of the group, Leonid Eitingon, directed the assassination of Trotsky in Mexico.",1988-01-24T05:00:00+0000

The pain persisted, and a specialist who gave the 58-year-old Pop artist collagen injections for smoothing face wrinkles urged him to see an internist. On Feb. 18, 1987, Warhol was advised by his regular physician, Dr. Denton S. Cox, that he needed immediate surgery to remove an infected gallbladder, normally a routine procedure. Pathologically fearful of dying, Warhol locked many of his valuables in a safe and on Feb. 20 checked into New York Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side. His operation on Feb. 21, all agree, was flawless. But by the next morning, he was dead. Andy Warhol's death last year and a continuing controversy over the 1984 death at that same hospital of Libby Zion, an 18-year-old Bennington College freshman, have plunged one of America's biggest and best-known medical centers into a state of siege. New York Hospital has been battered by government inquiries, bad publicity and internal dissension. It has seen its teaching system questioned, its pride diminished, its occupancy rate decline, and, in an unusual state action, three doctors affiliated with the hospital threatened with loss of their medical licenses. Throughout the hospital, anxiety is almost palpable - anxiety about what is happening inside patients' rooms and operating suites and administrative offices, and anxiety about how the institution looks from the outside, especially to prospective patients and staff and to philanthropists.",1988-01-24T05:00:00+0000

''For the first time in history, white people were transporting black men and women and children out of Africa not to be sold but to be saved,'' writes Ruth Gruber, the author of 12 previous books and the only foreign correspondent permitted to witness the secret mission that the world came to know as Operation Moses. In November 1985, Israeli agents, using more than $65 million raised in secret from people throughout the world, clandestinely airlifted 15,000 black Ethiopian Jews to Israel. Ms. Gruber weaves history, international politics and personal interviews into her suspenseful, behind-the-scenes chronicle. She recounts the day-to-day struggles of 15-year-old Alitash and her boyfriend, Daniel, who flee with a group of their friends on a perilous journey through the forests and deserts of Ethiopia and the Sudan; of 72-year-old Yona ben Naftali, the spokesman for the Jews of Gondar, who waits years for permission to fly to Israel with his wife, Tourou; and of 14-year-old Ezekiel, who buried his family along the way to the Holy Land. ''Rescue'' documents the worldwide network of support that sustained the undercover mission, as well as the corruption, press leaks and bureaucratic errors that left thousands of Ethiopian Jews stranded in disease-ridden refugee camps. Instead of getting caught up in the bureaucratic problems of backslapping and blame, the author makes the decision to focus on the human story of the Jews called Falashas, or strangers. It's the right decision. Ms. Gruber, an adept storyteller with a fine eye for detail, draws a vivid portrait of an ancient community whose members maintained their faith through 2,700 years of exile, in such isolation that they believed themselves to be the last Jews in the world.",1988-01-24T05:00:00+0000

us,And in This Corner . . .,"Negotiations for a Mike Tyson-Michael Spinks fight have taken a new turn. Shelly Finkel, a fight manager and close friend of Tyson's co-manager, Jim Jacobs, has entered the acrimonious negotiations in an attempt to smooth out the differences between the Tyson and Spinks camps. Talks broke off over the weekend in Atlantic City, ostensibly because of differences on the money to be paid to the fighters. However, there have also been strong personality clashes between Spinks's promoter, Butch Lewis, and Bill Cayton, who is co-manager with Jacobs of Tyson. Finkel spoke Monday to Jacobs and Cayton, and asked whether they would mind if he spoke with Milt Chwasky, the attorney for Lewis. They agreed, and Finkel and Chwasky met Monday. ''We're hopeful,'' said Finkel, ''something will happen with the fight this week. I'm optimistic. Look, the reality is that it's the best thing for both fighters; it's the most money for both fighters. I point-blank asked both sides, 'Do you want the fight to happen?' '' Finkel said the responses were affirmative. Finkel has a stake in the negotiations - he could wind up being in charge of the closed-circuit operation for the lucrative bout. Cayton has also entered discussions with promoters of Frank Bruno, who would replace Spinks in a June bout if a Tyson-Spinks match is not made.",1988-01-27T05:00:00+0000

Here more than anywhere else in the world quilting has flourished, inspired by homespun innovation. Today that innovation is propelling quilt making into new territory.Contemporary quilt makers are transforming the craft. Their works are as far removed from what came out of the old-fashioned quilting bee as microwave oven is from the wood-burning stove. ''The contemporary quilt has a whole new esthetic to it,'' said Paul Smith, director emeritus of the American Craft Museum in Manhattan. ''In the last 10 to 15 years, there has been a lot of experimentation with the quilt format. Quilters have broken with traditional geometric patterns and materials, and have expanded the vocabulary of the traditional quilt.'' No longer interested in creating decorative covers for the bed, contemporary quilt makers are piecing and stitching fabric into visually exciting works intended to be hung on walls, like paintings. No longer bound by the patterns of traditional quilts, they are creating abstract and allegorical patterns of their own. And no longer tied to the tradition of hand stitching, they are using the sewing machine for part - and sometimes all - of the work.",1988-01-28T05:00:00+0000

Roberts was heavily recruited, but he chose Paterno and Penn State because ''they told me I was going to play quarterback when they recruited me,'' he said. ''They said if I was good enough, I would play. I just never got my chance.'' Earlier this month, Roberts, who lost his football scholarship for academic reasons, left Penn State after carrying the ball five times and throwing one pass in three seasons. Now he is looking forward to playing football next fall at Trenton State and to improving his academic record. But he still has memories of Penn State: ''It's good football and everything, but up there it's very political. It's things you don't know about if you are outside. State College is Joe Paterno. It is his town. Everyone has some fear of him. He is so higher and greater than everyoneelse.''",1988-01-30T05:00:00+0000

Speaking on British television, Lewis said that many drug abusers were not being caught and that some athletes had agreements with meet promoters to avoid being tested.

Twenty-four karats is 100 percent gold; 18 karats is 18 parts gold and 6 parts other metal; 14 karats is 14 parts gold and 10 parts other metal. Copper produces a reddish tint, and a mix of copper and silver retains gold's natural yellow color . The jewelry listed here is available at many jewelry and department stores.

(The last living Leschetizky pupil of importance is Mieczyslaw Horszowski, 95 years old and still going strong.) In his great days, up to World War II, Moiseiwitsch was one of the supreme pianists. He had everything - technique, a glorious sound, poetry, strength when needed, an easygoing and unmannered musical mind. He made playing the piano sound so effortless, and so natural. His colleagues ranked him with any living pianist. Stylistically he was primarily a lyricist. He was not as mercurial as Hofmann, or as pre-planned as the more austere Rachmaninoff.

This book is a selection of epistles - monthly newsletters-cum-fundraising appeals - issued from Times Square. The Rev. Bruce Ritter is a remarkable Roman Catholic missionary to the runaway, castoff and abused street kids drawn into drugs and prostitution. His calling came when six homeless youths knocked on his apartment door in 1969. Since then Father Ritter has sheltered, by his count, more than 100,000 young people in Covenant Houses in New York, Houston, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Toronto and Guatemala. The lives he depicts are wrenching. Meet Ernie - ''We found him sleeping in a garbage can.'' Cheryl, 14 years old, was strangled in a West Side warehouse. The brothers Jose and Gustavo were conceived, born and orphaned in a Guatemalan brothel. Nandy, an 11-year-old boy, was offered by a pimp for $20. Some passages are repetitive; others are preachy tirades against the sex industry. Father Ritter's style is conversational, occasionally rising to memorable: ''Sometimes God has a kid's face.'' A shelter ''was right next to the biggest pimp bar on the Strip and right across the street from a porno theater and a massage parlor. You couldn't want a more perfect location.'' He pleads for supplies: ''Anyone with some extra sheets and pillow cases or blankets can win some points with the Lord.'' For his tireless good deeds, Father Ritter surely has earned a bounty of points.",1988-01-31T05:00:00+0000

In THE RING OF TRUTH: An Inquiry Into How We Know What We Know (Random House, $24.95), an immensely pretty book crafted as a companion volume to a public television series of that name on scientific inquiry, Philip and Phylis Morrison, master teachers both - he at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she in classrooms for all ages - go a long way toward telling us. From ''the big new idea of 1280'' (eyeglasses) and ''the commonsense emphasis on the visible,'' to the ''magnificent finding of the eighteenth century,'' that weight is unchanged through all sorts of processes - that is, the constancy of matter - to the astrophysical mysteries of our own period, the Morrisons show how lines of argument follow experience and experiment underlies theory. Take the 19th century's ''deepest insight'': ''the identification of the idea of energy.'' Tour de France cyclists are the scientific instruments, with calculations of their intake and output augmented by their own analyses. ''You can use up an awful lot of calories, so . . . you have to put them back in,'' says one. To demonstrate the essentiality of carbon, the chef Julia Child is the applied biochemist. In less deft hands, such devices could cloy. Intermingled as they are with an illustrated history of mapping or reports on the archives and archivists of the Harvard Observatory, and infused with the Morrisons' seriousness about transmitting in a personal way a grasp of science as a whole, they are mostly fun.

us,FICTION,"TITCH. By Chaim Bermant. (St. Martin's, $13.95.) Chaim Bermant's brief eighth novel closely resembles the oft-told tale of the American Jew who comes of age during World War II, discovering in wartime his Americanness as well as his ambivalence about his Jewish identity. The differences in ''Titch'' are that its bookish Jewish youth, the repository of his immigrant family's ambitions, is British; that the locale is neither the Bronx, Brooklyn nor Newark but Manchester; and that the forbidden fruits are rashers and the granddaughters of baronets. ''Titch'' otherwise runs along familiar lines. Polish-born Sammy Hoch grows up in a traditional Jewish home ruled by his opinionated father, who is a big noise at the synagogue and an even bigger noise once his son wins a scholarship to the prestigious Manchester Grammar School. When Sammy is called up for military service, he is assigned, to his shock, to the army of the Polish Government in exile. In basic training with his British peers, Sammy had believed that he ''had been finally grafted to the trunk of olde England, integrated, assimilated, at one with the men around me, to the point almost of resenting the Jew in me. And now, suddenly, I was reclassified a foreigner.'' Sammy serves the Polish Army as a rabbi's assistant, an irony whose bitterness Mr. Bermant could have expressed more fully, given Poland's history of anti-Semitism. The first in a projected trilogy, ''Titch'' ends abruptly with a cliffhanger that dangles at curb height. Despite its occasional flashes of humor, the novel never approaches the wit and inventiveness that has distinguished American literature exploring the same ground.",1988-01-31T05:00:00+0000

Ross Thomas's nimble international thriller will get you to Washington, Malibu, Manila, Hong Kong and even - with a few backup books like his earlier ''Briarpatch'' and ''Cold War Swap'' - to the Philippines. These are also the locales visited by the putative hero of ''Out on the Rim,'' Booth Stallings, an expert on terrorism who is given the unenviable assignment of waving a $5-million bribe at a Communist guerrilla leader to dissuade him from bringing down the Aquino Government. Being no bushwhacker himself, Stallings shrewdly recruits the services of four professional adventurers, who are no sooner hired than they're scheming with (and against) him on ways to take the money and scoot. At this point, Mr. Thomas proves that he really knows how to fly this airline literature as he puts his plot through some sidewinder loops that confound all our assumptions about the moral and political value of the original do-good assignment. With each twist of the story, he also reveals a darker side to his disarmingly comic characters, who include a consummate con artist who goes by the sobriquet of Otherguy (as in ''the other guy did it'') Overby and a wily tactical genius, Arthur Wu, who declares himself the Emperor of China. Ultimately, Mr. Thomas uses the heroic conventions of the genre to mock the very notion of heroism. With cynical amusement, his witty rogues define a world war as ''the ultimate geography lesson'' and terrorism as ''politics without moral compunction.'' It's this kind of black humor that can keep you laughing even while the plane goes down.",1988-01-31T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"A TIME FOR GIANTS: Politics of the American High Command in World War II. By D. Clayton James with Anne Sharp Wells. (Franklin Watts, $19.95.) A distinguished historian and the author of the well-received three-volume biography ''The Years of MacArthur'' here focuses attention on the careers of 18 top American military leaders. The roster comprises seven Army generals (Dwight Eisenhower, Douglas MacArthur, George Marshall, Joseph Stilwell, George Patton, Mark Clark and Omar Bradley), five admirals (Ernest King, William Halsey, Chester Nimitz, William Leahy and Raymond Spruance), four Army Air Force generals (Henry Arnold, Carl Spaatz, George Kenney and Ira Eaker) and two Marine generals (Holland Smith and A. Archer Vandegrift). D. Clayton James outlines the prewar old-boy network that helped to propel graduates of the service academies to the highest command positions at the outset of World War II. Mr. James amasses a great deal of information, relying primarily on published biographies, but - strangely for such an accomplished historian - he fails to evaluate it. Disconcertingly, he does not provide an in-depth examination of the processes through which America's top military leaders were chosen. In fact, the book has the subdued, judicious tone usually found in official histories. In the end, Mr. James reaches the breathtakingly prosaic conclusion that ''without exception, these eighteen leaders seemed to have achieved their positions of high command by being the best qualified and most experienced officers available for the jobs at the time.''",1988-01-31T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE STARS AT NOON, by Denis Johnson. (Vintage, $5.95.) A young American woman seeking ''the exact dimensions of Hell'' goes to Nicaragua in this story by the author of ''Fiskadoro.'' ''It is daring, this political novel that disdains politics, this philosophical work that rejects all philosophies,'' Caryn James said here in 1986. ''It suggests that Denis Johnson is one of our most inventive, unpredictable novelists.'' WILLA CATHER: The Emerging Voice, by Sharon O'Brien. (Fawcett Columbine, $12.95.) Willa Cather, whose best-known novels include ''O Pioneers!'' and ''Death Comes for the Archbishop,'' so closely identified with men that she went by the name William in college, yet she created memorable female characters. In her detailed look at this affecting writer, whose works made the lands of Nebraska and New Mexico come alive, Sharon O'Brien has ''written a woman artist's life, seldom if ever re-created so imaginatively and, therefore, so accurately,'' Carolyn Heilbrun said in The Book Review in 1986. THE MISALLIANCE, by Anita Brookner. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $6.95.) When Blanche's husband leaves her for his young secretary, he takes the couple's friends with him. ''Few writers have come close to [ Anita ] Brookner in the depiction of female loneliness,'' our reviewer, Fernanda Eberstadt, said here last year. The novel ''exercises an almost inexplicable grip on the reader - a tribute to her formidable gifts as a psychologist of the wounded woman's heart.'' THE RIVER THAT FLOWS UPHILL: A Journey From the Big Bang to the Big Brain, by William H. Calvin. (Sierra Club, $12.95.) Written in the form of a mile-by-mile diary of a raft trip through the Grand Canyon, William H. Calvin's book is not only about geology and evolution but about cosmogony, ecology and neurobiology. ''Vivid analogies bring the science down to earth,'' Ricki Lewis said here in 1986. The result is ''a unique piece of science writing.'' POISON: An 87th Precinct Novel, by Ed McBain. (Avon, $3.95.) One of the greatest mysteries posed by this Ed McBain novel, John Gross said in The Times last year, is why the author's formulaic police procedurals are so much better than those of his competitors. In this story of a triple murder, two committed with a poison called nicotine, ''the investigation snakes its way to an exciting and unexpected conclusion.'' THE DEAL OF THE CENTURY: The Breakup of AT&T, by Steve Coll. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) With local rates rising and Mickey Mouse telephones glutting the market, some critics wonder whether the divestiture of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was such a noble cause after all. By re-creating the tale and its real-life characters, Steve Coll has produced ''an edifying account of a seminal antitrust case [ that ] also manages to be a moving story,'' Susan Kinsley said here in 1986. LOVE AND WORK, by Reynolds Price. (Ballantine, $3.50.) In this novel about a novelist, a self-centered writer who resents the demands of family and friends finally comes to accept love and responsibility. In 1968, Thomas Lask said in The Times that the solution to the protagonist's dilemma seemed too pat, but he admired the book's style. The ''prose is a pleasure to read, pliant, capable of fine gradations of mood and atmosphere and especially effective in building up the interior weather of every act and scene.'' MEN'S LIVES, by Peter Matthiessen. (Vintage, $7.95.) For more than 30 years, Peter Matthiessen has lived among the Bonackers (natives) of Long Island's South Fork, watching as the fishermen's lives have been destroyed by encroaching Manhattanites. ''In this magnificent and somber portrait [ he ] shows a stubbornly surviving culture being carelessly exterminated,'' our reviewer, Jonathan Raban, said in 1986. The same publisher has added two more titles to its series of Matthiessen reprints - the novels FAR TORTUGA ($10.95) and RACE ROCK ($8.95). THE ALL OF IT, by Jeannette Haien. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) An Irish woman confesses to her priest that her husband, now dead, was really her brother. ''Though the novel is slight, both in length and scope,'' Jeanne McCulloch said here in 1986, ''it is an elegantly written, compact and often subtle tale.'' PLAYING GOD IN YELLOWSTONE: The Destruction of America's First National Park, by Alston Chase. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $10.95.) Through stupidity, neglect and mismanagement, the National Park Service is ruining Yellowstone, the author argues in this polemic. In 1986, our reviewer, Philip Shabecoff, said the book is ''single-minded to the point of absurdity,'' yet ''provocative, well written and well meant.'' TONGUES OF FLAME, by Tim Parks. (King Penguin, $5.95.) In the climax of a novel about religious fanaticism in modern England, a 15-year-old boy watches in horror as his rebellious older brother is forced to undergo an exorcism. The book, which won the Somerset Maugham Award for writers under 35, ''is a hilarious and original portrait of a young boy grappling with good and evil,'' our reviewer, Meg Wolitzer, said here in 1986. MY FATHER AND MYSELF, by J. R. Ackerley. (Poseidon, $7.95.) ''I was born in 1896 and my parents were married in 1919.'' The writer of those words, the first sentence of this memoir, was a shy homosexual, his father a hard-drinking womanizer. In reconstructing his private life, the author and editor J. R.
