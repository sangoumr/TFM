Annenberg, who for more than four decades demonstrated on a breathtaking scale his passion for art and his support of this institution. With his wife, Leonore, he based his philanthropy at the Metropolitan on the understanding that great museum collections remain great by continuing to evolve and to grow. Through a series of landmark gestures-gifts of works of art from masterpieces by Van Gogh to masterpieces of Asian sculpture, along with major grants for acquisitions-they have enhanced the very heart of the Metropolitan Museum, its collections, for generations to come. Walter Annenberg was involved in countless other ways as well: as a Trustee and benefactor; as a committed supporter of education in the arts; and as the donor of a major challenge grant that has enabled the Museum to build a new Center For Imaging and Photography. But his most spectacular gesture was the decision in 1991 to bequeath his collection of fifty-three Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, watercolors, and drawings to the Museum, the largest single gift of art to the Metropolitan in more than a quarter century. Since 1993, this outstanding collection has been in residence at the Museum for six months of each year for all to enjoy. Walter's motto was ''strength to strength,'' and his legacy of sweeping generosity will be held dear by us and by the museum-going public in perpetuity. We extend our deepest condolences to Mrs. Annenberg and to the entire family. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director David E. McKinney, President",2002-10-02T05:00:00+0000

Palm, whose stock price has plummeted from $165 a share at its March 2000 initial public offering to 65 cents yesterday, has suffered from rollout problems, weak demand and stiff competition from Microsoft . Reverse splits reduce the number of shares outstanding, but do not alter the company's market value. The capitalization of Palm, which once exceeded that of Ford Motor , has buckled with the high-technology bubble. Palm, based in Milpitas, Calif., is now worth about $376 million and has reported losses in six of the last seven quarters. In August, Palm was removed from the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. ""I am convinced that this decision, combined with continued strong execution by Palm's management team, will contribute to shareholder-value creation,"" said Eric A.

Annenberg, who for more than four decades demonstrated on a breathtaking scale his passion for art and his support of this institution. With his wife, Leonore, he based his philanthropy at the Metropolitan on the understanding that great museum collections remain great by continuing to evolve and to grow. Through a series of landmark gestures-gifts of works of art from masterpieces by Van Gogh to masterpieces of Asian sculpture, along with major grants for acquisitions-they have enhanced the very heart of the Metropolitan Museum, its collections, for generations to come. Walter Annenberg was involved in countless other ways as well: as a Trustee and benefactor; as a committed supporter of education in the arts; and as the donor of a major challenge grant that has enabled the Museum to build a new Center for Imaging and Photography. But his most spectacular gesture was the decision in 1991 to bequeath his collection of fifty-three Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, watercolors, and drawings to the Museum, the largest single gift of art to the Metropolitan in more than a quarter century. Since 1993, this outstanding collection has been in residence at the Museum for six months of each year for all to enjoy. Walter's motto was ''strength to strength,'' and his legacy of sweeping generosity will be held dear by us and by the museum-going public in perpetuity.

Now a deal negotiated by the nonprofit developer Urban Homesteading Assistance Board allows a squatter who, for instance, once voluntarily paid $250 a month in building dues for 800 square feet of space in the East Village to pay $750 a month in combined mortgage and operating costs. On the open market, an apartment of the same size in a co-op in that neighborhood could easily cost $2,300 a month ($800 alone on operating costs), according to Citi Habitats, a residential brokerage company. The squatters got a deal, but one with several catches. Owners can sell only to individuals or families making no more than 80 percent of the median income of New Yorkers, as arrived at by the federal department of Housing and Urban Development ($45,200 for a family of three, for example). And over the next three years, no former squatter can get more than $9,000 for a nonstudio apartment, a fraction of its worth. But after years and in many cases decades of renovating their apartments and putting in what they call sweat equity, the families, artists and middle-class pro-fessionals turned owners are for the moment content to enjoy the fruits of their labor.",2002-10-06T05:00:00+0000

When I begin the class, after the first few announcements and the like, I wave the paper in front of the class, and read some of the headlines. The point I want to get across to the students is that every domestic story in the front part of the newspaper, before you get to the recipes and the comics and the sports pages, has a legal angle-has some connection with the legal system. Of course, I have no control over the newspaper, but the trick never fails. Almost invariably, every story about public life in the United States, or private life interesting enough to get into the newspaper, will mention a law, a legal proposal, a bill in Congress or in the state legislature, or something a judge, a policeman, a court, a lawyer has done or said; or some statement from the president or other high officials, in any case always about some affair or situation or event done , with, through, or against the law. In the world we live in-the country we live in-almost nothing has more impact on our lives, nothing is more entangled with our everyday existence, than that something we call the law.

Men and women, children and adults, old people and newborn babes, the living and the dead, the sick and the healthy, innocents and murderers, the learned and the ignorant, workers in the depths of coal mines, cosmonauts in their celestial orbits - these and thousands of other categories of people were all linked to a common essence this innovative expression.

Annenberg, an Emeritus Trustee and a member of the Joint Committee of the Trustees of our Annenberg School for Communication. Ambassador Annenberg was a loyal alumnus and dedicated benefactor who, with his wife, Leonore, made contributions of profound importance to the University and society. We remain forever indebted to him for his generosity and vision in founding on our campus in 1958 the Annenberg School for Communication, to promote the highest standards of professionalism and ethics in the fields of communication and journalism. By adding substantially to the original endowment through the Annenberg Foundation, to support among other things the Annenberg Institute for the Study of Democratic Institutions and Goverment and the Institute for Adolescent Risk Communication, he ensured the school's vitality and efficacy well into the future. Further demonstrating his commitment to higher education, he established 16 professorships at Penn, thereby strengthening schools, centers, and programs throughout the University. He funded the Annenberg Scholars to provide financial assistance to students who would not otherwise be able to afford undergraduate and graduate education. In addition, he was instrumental in the founding of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, the only institution in the world devoted exclusively to post-doctoral research on Jewish civilization in all its historical and cultural manifestations. He also founded here in 1970 the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, which continues to serve the University and the greater Philadelphia community. Walter Annenberg's name is forever linked to the history of this institution, having dramatically increased its ability to advance learning and culture throughout the world. The Penn community mourns the death of our friend and extends our profound sympathy to Leonore Annenberg and to the entire Annenberg family.

us,What Becomes a Legend More?,"''Winners always write the history, and the Yankees have written more than their share,'' Glenn Stout writes in YANKEES CENTURY: 100 Years of New York Yankees Baseball (Houghton Mifflin, $35). He devotes plenty of space to the Yankees before they were winners -- they didn't hit pay dirt until 1921, their 19th season. As late as 1920, The Sporting News referred to the Yankees' ''Old Jinx,'' as the franchise seemed to be perpetually afflicted with debilitating injuries and various other forms of bad luck. That ended, of course, soon after the acquisition of Babe Ruth in 1920, though Stout refutes the oft-told story about the Boston Red Sox owner Harry Frazee selling the Bambino in order to finance a Broadway production of ''No, No, Nanette.'' Not to be confused with ''Yankees Century'' is A YANKEE CENTURY (Berkley, $26.95), a haphazard primer by Harvey Frommer on the franchise's history. THE NEW YORK YANKEES ILLUSTRATED HISTORY (St. Martin's, $29.95), on the other hand, is like a lovingly constructed family photo album, the margins filled with stories told by a few of your more interesting uncles, in this case The New York Times's sportswriters Dave Anderson, Murray Chass, Robert Lipsyte, Buster Olney and George Vecsey. Here are the familiar images -- Ruth watching his 60th homer sail over the fence; Lou Gehrig watching infield practice before the first game in nearly 15 years in which he didn't play; Casey Stengel gazing into his crystal baseball; Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson nearly coming to blows -- but there are others, both less familiar and more revealing. Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle are depicted in 1951 (DiMaggio's last season and Mantle's first). DiMaggio's smile appears forced, and he looks at neither the camera nor his understudy. As Lipsyte writes, ''Despite the hype or maybe because of it, the great DiMaggio never gave Mantle the time of day.'' Rob Neyer",2002-10-06T05:00:00+0000

But last week researchers announced that a large and lengthy study in Shanghai had found no evidence that breast self-examinations reduced deaths from breast cancer.

If it is approved, the machines will replace the 1950's-era Breathalyzers in the 465 police departments in the state.

A year later, Congress and the president decamped to Philadelphia, and a decade after that, they settled into a new federal city next to which the City of Brotherly Love seems like Shangri-La.

It was from here that a ''planning council'' of activists and parents ran the local schools in an experiment, financed by the Ford Foundation, in ''community control.'' The premise of community control was that ghetto children were failing in school, not because of the terrible problems of inner-city life but because of neglect, even hostility, from the system's overwhelmingly white teachers and administrators. Community control, or, as it came to be known, decentralization, would empower those who cared most about the children -- parents, elders, neighborhood leaders -- to guide their education.",2002-10-06T05:00:00+0000

There also will not be traffic back-ups and parking problems. Just walk into the front barn, parts of which are 150 years old, get your basket and head out to the orchards. On busy weekends in October, Mr. Kielblock will shuttle you up to the far orchard by tractor, but on weekdays, you can walk right down the hill to the nearest grove. Almost all the apple trees on the 57-acre Hillview Farm are dwarfs, which make them perfectly suited for children to pick.

The comparison he finds most telling is with hunting-happy Canada, where there are 7 million guns for a population of 33 million -- a ratio similar to our own -- but fewer than 400 deaths a year.

Immediately to the east of the immense, glittering bulk of the Cond Nast Building, which is on the northeast corner of 42nd Street and Broadway, is a peculiar little arts complex situated in a string of dingy buildings.

Registration plate RTW1, red leather upholstery, walnut dashboard, no radio, and a blue metal RAC badge on the front. (The RAC man, portly and moustachioed, with heavy patched boots and a subservient manner, had arrived to enrol us. His first, preposterous question to my father - 'Now, sir, how many cars have you got?' - passed into quiet family myth.)

The bill, which is meant to prevent children from using guns, passed the Senate in previous sessions but was not considered by the Assembly. The legislation was amended last week and is expected to be voted on today. Sponsors of the bill said childproof handguns would not be mandated until the technology was commercially available and proven to be reliable.

Mrs. Annenberg is President of the American Friends of The British Museum and a source of constant inspiration.

The professionalism he brought to his philanthropy was well known, as was the charm and sense of humour he was imbued with. The generosity of the Annenberg Foundation towards the British Museum has been of seminal importance, per manently recognised in the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Information Centre.

Last month, the mayor of Moscow, Yuri M.

The monument was pulled down after the collapse of the August 1991 coup, which hastened the end of the Soviet Union. Aleksandr M.

In Midtown, the quirky shops and small galleries are open, and the flat, quiet streets invite bicycling. You won't get lost, whether walking, biking or driving; in 1848, when thousands of manic gold seekers were debarking from steamboats here for the overland rush to mining country, the new city of Sacramento was laid out in a neat grid, with north-south streets numbered and east-west streets lettered. You can also find something here that California isn't known for: fall color. After a walk down streets shaded by hardwoods, palms and conifers, you'll be ready to believe a hard-to-verify local claim: that Sacramento, with one million trees and 407,000 people, has more trees per capita than any other city in the world.

us,The Smallpox Decision,"President Bush faces a momentous public health decision: whether to make smallpox vaccine available to all who want it or limit its use to the health personnel who would have to cope with any bioterrorist attack. The issue is fraught with difficulties. If Mr. Bush makes the vaccine widely available, there will be severe side effects in a small percentage of recipients. If 100 million people chose to be vaccinated, perhaps 100 of them might die and many more could be severely injured. But these casualties would pale in comparison with the toll that would be exacted by a smallpox attack. Should a smallpox epidemic spread out of control, it could kill tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of unvaccinated people.",2002-10-13T05:00:00+0000

us,'Blue Shoe'," The world outside the window was in flames. The leaves on the pistachio trees shone fire-red and orange. Mattie studied the early-morning light. She was lying on the side of the bed where her husband should have been sleeping. Those trees were one reason she'd moved back into her parents' old home after leaving Nicholas, these trees and the sloping grassy hillside behind the house. Also, there was no mortgage: her parents had paid it off during the course of their marriage. She and her brother, Al, had grown up playing on the hill and in the buckeyes with their low, broad branches; her six-year-old, Harry, played there now, and her daughter, Ella, two, would also climb one day soon. The leaves of the delicate Japanese maple between Mattie's window and the wobbly fence were still green, but elsewhere in the garden were russets and butterscotch-oranges, other trees giddy with color, almost garish, like gypsy dresses. When she strained to listen, she could imagine them saying, We gave you shade, and now we'll give you a little kick-ass beauty before we die. A choir of chickadees and finches sang above the sounds of a quiet neighborhood waking up, the cars of people heading to work and school, the clatter and thumps of the recycling truck, a dog barking, leaves rustling in a gentle wind, silence.

It was thought that I, being the fourth son in a family whose brickworks would only comfortably support three, might learn something there of the shipping trade, my uncle's connexions in this area being quite extensive. Neither my father nor my uncle saw fit to consult me in this matter. Having assumed that any young man should welcome the chance to work amid great seagoing ships, they regarded my opinions as settled beforehand. Thus it never came into their consideration that I disliked the sea above all things, and had once resolved, during an intolerable bark crossing from Cardiff to Portishead some years past, never to set foot on the boards of a ship again.

How can you, with the manager constantly hovering over you and the strains of ''We Will Rock You'' or some other sales-meeting anthem ricocheting around your brain? You've got to be on, you've got to be pumped, you've got to be ready to pursue a car that noses into the lot, and then be standing right there, hand extended, when the wary customer steps out. Body language is vital. Philip Reed, a writer who last year posted a diary on the Internet about his stint as a car salesman, described a seminar in which he was taught how to shake hands -- with a ''slight pulling motion'' that represents ''the beginning of your control over the customer.'' Reed observed that the car salesmen he worked with shook hands with one another often, too, practicing for ''Mr. Customer'' and ''staying loose.'' There was also a lot of ''high-fiving, fist-bumping, back-slapping and arm-squeezing'' and during slow periods a lot of ''tie-pulling, wrestling and shadowboxing.''",2002-10-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Cellist's Block,"Isabel Masurovsky, the narrator of DISTURBANCE OF THE INNER EAR (Carroll & Graf, $25), Joyce Hackett's strange and intermittently lovely first novel, is a onetime child prodigy, a brilliant cellist who has been artistically blocked for a decade. When Isabel was 14, on the night of her Carnegie Hall debut, her parents died in a car crash. She hasn't played well since. She awakens on the book's first page in a Milan hotel to discover that her septuagenarian lover, the only person who remembers her illustrious past, has died. Stranded in Italy with no family, little money and an exceedingly delicate temperament (she finds the crunching required to eat an apple unendurably violent), Isabel proceeds to make a series of mysterious and haphazard choices. She begins an uneasy romance with a surgical resident who sidelines as a gigolo, and takes work tutoring a troubled adolescent boy with a taste for dog biscuits. The boy's father owns an exquisite 16th-century cello, the same instrument, Isabel suspects, that was confiscated by the Nazis from a famous Jewish musician. Isabel is powerfully drawn to the cello, which, like her, hasn't made music in years. The Holocaust casts its long shadow over them both: Isabel's father, a pianist and a concentration camp survivor, has left his daughter a legacy of crushing anxiety. When she was a child, he told her ''that bad people crumbled if they heard Beethoven or Bach,'' and that only her musical virtuosity would protect her. The novel is breathless, opaque and hard to track; it is also singular and sometimes haunting. Jennifer Marie Reese",2002-10-13T05:00:00+0000

There you found short stories of varying lengths along with ''serials,'' novel-length narratives broken into two, three or more installments. Each installment began with a brief synopsis so densely packed with information as to be virtually unintelligible. If for some reason you missed the beginning of a serial, you had to piece together what was happening from clues embedded in the latest installment. Even many of the ostensibly stand-alone short stories belonged to loosely connected series, set in societies, worlds or universes that the writer had used before.

That fact was notoriously illustrated in a 1995 piece, a pup tent appliqud with 102 names titled, bluntly, ''Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995.''",2002-10-13T05:00:00+0000

Take a peek into the minuscule kitchen. Large enough for just two people, it is the launch site of the famous Station Burger ($5.75), served with bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, raw or fried onions and American or Swiss cheese. A plain burger is $4.50, a cheeseburger with American or Swiss is $4.75, and a cheddar burger is $4.95. But all is not burgers. There is the Invention ($5.50), with house-prepared hot roast beef, American cheese and fried onions between two slices of grilled rye, and the Station Steak Sandwich served with six ounces of sliced top round on a hard roll ($5.75). On the back of the menu are the sides, like a mass of onion rings ($4.25), a large order of fries ($2.75) and cheese fries ($2.50 small). To wash it all down there are beers, soft drinks (pitcher $6.50 ), or coffee or tea ($1). Desserts are not an option, unless you bring your own, and some customers do. Millicent K.

The chairman, Dennis Gillings, bid $11.25 a share, or about 35 percent more than the stock's closing price of $8.31 on Friday. Mr. Gillings controls about 5.5 percent of the company's shares. The company's stock price has fallen almost half this year as sales slowed. Some investors said the bid was too low because Mr. Gillings might be able to use the cash of Quintiles to help finance the transaction. Mr. Gillings has formed a company, Pharma Services, to acquire Quintiles. Pharma Services has a commitment for debt financing and is discussing equity financing, Quintiles said.

The Pressplay service already includes songs from the two major music companies that own it, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group, part of Vivendi Universal, as well as from EMI. Pressplay is expected to announce a deal with Warner Music Group, part of AOL Time Warner, shortly, a move that would make it the only service to offer the ability to download music from all five major recording companies. But only a limited number of Pressplay's songs can be copied onto CD's or transferred to portable devices by a customer. Listen.com, whose Rhapsody service offers the ability to hear songs from all five labels, is expected to let consumers start copying songs next week. Amy Harmon (NYT)",2002-10-15T05:00:00+0000

New York's big cities must maintain the highways within their borders, and the state insures them against resulting lawsuits -- all except New York City. The policy, set 50 years ago and written into law in 1987, was estimated by a lower court to cost the city tens of millions of dollars annually. The city claimed that it, too, was covered by the 1987 law. Yesterday, the Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that New York City was excluded, though it added that the state had offered no justification for the policy.

The service, which will be made available to all customers early next year, costs $18.86 a month for unlimited rentals. Wal-Mart said it could offer more than 12,000 titles, about 12 times the number that is carried in an average rental store. With the move into mail order DVD rentals, Wal-Mart directly takes on earlier entrants into the market like Netflix, Blockbuster, CafeDVD, QwikFlicks and DVD Avenue. Netflix, the market leader, mails out about 190,000 discs each day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers. Wal-Mart has long been acclaimed for the advanced inventory systems in use in its 2,800 retail stores. The company is hoping to replicate that success online with DVD rentals. ''Our customers have long counted on Wal-Mart for quality family entertainment,'' said Gary Severson, a senior vice president at Wal-Mart. ''With our online DVD rental service, we will be able to deliver even greater convenience and selection to our customers.'' Netflix, however, has a head start on Wal-Mart. In an effort to cut down rental turnaround times, Netflix added 10 new regional distribution centers in June. Andrew Zipern (NYT)",2002-10-16T05:00:00+0000

''Mentioning Latin America and telecommunications in the same breath is viewed as a death sentence in some places because of their respective crises,'' Tim Harmon, C.I.H.'s chief executive, said in an interview. ''We think it's an opportune time to get into both areas, when others are running out of the fire.''

Critics have called the plan a veiled plot to slash jobs in France's enormous state bureaucracy and a threat to the country's national identity.

A graduate of the Brearley School and Magna Cum Laude graduate of Bryn Mawr, she held an M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard, where she was awarded the Caroline A. Wilby prize for her doctoral dissertation as ''the best original work in any department.'' Among her many professional activities, Patricia Labalme was Associate Director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, (1982-1988) and Secretary of the Corporation (1982-1992). From 1992-1997, she was Assistant to the Director, Dr. Phillip A. Griffiths. Most recently, she was a Visitor in the School of Historical Studies, at the IAS. Known also for her dedication to independent school education, she was, among her many affiliations, president of the Brearley Board of Trustees (1978-1982). She was also a trustee of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation (1979Present), the American Academy in Rome (1979-1999), the first female trustee of the Lawrenceville School (1985-1996), and a trustee of the Renaissance Society of America (1982-Present). She was also a member of the Ateneo Veneto and the Istituto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, both in Venice, and Director of the Quantum Chemical Corporation. Her passion for humanism was formed by her lifelong friendships with professors Werner Jaeger, Myron P. Gilmore, Helen Maud Cam, Paul Oskar Kristeller, Vittore Branca and Felix Gilbert. It was Gilbert, her professor at Bryn Mawr and her colleague at the IAS, who, after three decades of encouragement, persuaded her to start her book on Marino Sanudo's diaries. At the time of her death, Dr. Labalme was close to completing this book, which received initial funding from the NEH.

White, who will oversee the book's completion. A private service was held at the family home in West Cornwall, CT, on October 14. A memorial service will be held at the Marciana Library in Venice.

Labalme, Henry G. Labalme, Lisa G. Osterland & Victoria A. Labalme, grandmother of six, and sister of Ann H. Poole, all of whom mourn her passing. A graduate of the Brearley School and Magna Cum Laude graduate of Bryn Mawr, she held an M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard, where she was awarded the Caroline A. Wilby prize for her doctoral dissertation as ''the best original work in any department.'' Among her many professional activities, Patricia Labalme was Associate Director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, (1982-1988) and Secretary of the Corporation (1982-1992). From 1992-1997, she was Assistant to the Director, Dr. Phillip A. Griffiths. Most recently, she was a Visitor in the School of Historical Studies, at the IAS. Known also for her dedication to independent school education, she was, among her many affiliations, president of the Brearley Board of Trustees (1978-1982). She was also a trustee of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation (1979Present), the American Academy in Rome (1979-1999), the first female trustee of the Lawrenceville School (1985-1996), and a trustee of the Renaissance Society of America (1982-Present). She was also a member of the Ateneo Veneto and the Istituto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, both in Venice, and Director of the Quantum Chemical Corporation. Her passion for humanism was formed by her lifelong friendships with professors Werner Jaeger, Myron P. Gilmore, Helen Maud Cam, Paul Oskar Kristeller, Vittore Branca and Felix Gilbert. It was Gilbert, her professor at Bryn Mawr and her colleague at the IAS, who, after three decades of encouragement, persuaded her to start her book on Marino Sanudo's diaries. At the time of her death, Dr. Labalme was close to completing this book, which received initial funding from the NEH. The book will be published posthumously under a unique arrangement in which the IAS has created a special position, a Director's Visitor, to be held by Professor Laura S. White, who will oversee the book's completion. A private service was held at the family home in West Cornwall, CT, on October 14. A memorial service will be held at the Marciana Library in Venice.

A leading figure in the growth of Forbes Magazine and the magazine's executive editor until his retirement in 1992, died Wednesday of pneumonia in New York City. He was 75 and had been battling pulmonary fibrosis for many years. Jim graduated from Bowdoin College, Class of 1948, and earned a Master's Degree in dramatic literature from Columbia University. He taught English at midwestern colleges before chucking academia for journalism. He joined Forbes in 1955 and rose through the ranks, along the way penning a record number of cover stories. His skeptical mind and his broad concept of what constituted business journalism greatly influenced both his style and the philosophy of the publication as it is today. Throughout his life Jim retained a lively interest in the theater and in the novel. After his retirement he published in 2000 ''Fellow Travellers'', a novel based loosely on the family of controversial financier Armand Hammer; Cook knew Hammer well and had frequently written about him for Forbes. Cook is survived by his wife, Claire, and daughters, Karen and Cassandra, all of New York City. A memorial service will be held in the Forbes Magazine Galleries at a date to be announced.

us,About the Photographs,"When William Eggleston began the series that he would later name, somewhat misleadingly, ''Los Alamos,'' he was a young photographer known only to insiders and fellow artists, and he had worked only in black and white. In 1965, he decided to experiment with color, photographing scenes in his home city of Memphis. Nine years later, he had traveled throughout the American South and had taken more than 2,000 pictures for the series -- improbably beautiful images of the shards of everyday life, in a striking, unexpected color palette. But despite the strength of the images and support from his fellow artists, most of the series was never displayed or published. The negatives went into storage and, on the whole, stayed there for the next three decades. Eggleston himself can't really say why. ''We kept saying, 'We'll show these,''' he says, but the project, as he puts it, ''remained buried.'' Over that time, however, his work began to attract a great deal of attention, from both collectors and critics. He published several books; he was the subject of close to 100 solo shows; his prints sold for more than $100,000. And yet one large chapter of his career was still all but lost. Recently, accepting an invitation from the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, he returned to the work that had been sitting in storage all that time. He began printing the negatives using the labor-intensive dye-transfer process, which he had been among the first to adapt from advertising to art photography. ''I have seen little proofs through the years,'' he says, ''but not the whole thing. Just recently, now that they've been brought into existence through this process, I've seen them, you could say, for the first time.'' This March, 88 prints from the collection, which will be published in book form by Scalo, will go on display in Germany; later they will travel in Europe and the United States. As for how the images, now so evocative of a lost moment in American culture, have survived the years, Eggleston says: ''I think they look better. It's like seeing some old friends you thought were forever gone.''",2002-10-20T05:00:00+0000

The governor said the attorney general had reviewed the detectives' reports during Mr. Santiago's confirmation hearings and had determined they were groundless. Mr. Santiago, the former Newark police director, was the most controversial of the governor's top appointments last winter. During a stormy confirmation process, opponents cited Mr. Santiago's short temper as well as an old assault case and tax problems in his background. Mr. Santiago was already facing problems last week related to internal state police reports. After published reports surfaced that he had requested internal investigative files regarding himself and staff members, the governor announced that the Office of Government Integrity would review whether the request violated state rules.

Hoboken, of course, has achieved a certain level of fame as the Mile Square City. Keep those tape measures out, though, because nearby Wallington also sits on a square mile of land. I learned this cartographic fact at the One Square Mile Pizzeria and Grill. From the outside, the restaurant is rather inviting, with a stone facade, gravel-and-stucco panels, and most notably, a tall, sloping red roof. Inside, Martin and Alex Papazian, the father and son who have operated One Square Mile for seven years, have created a family-friendly atmosphere. It's surprisingly spacious -- not a square mile, but certainly big enough. Overhead, you'll find exposed beams, ceiling fans and hanging brass lamps. There are also fast-food-style booths, potted plants, a World Class Bowling video game and a Dirty Harry pinball machine. You may recognize the interior as a location from a few episodes of the Comedy Central series ''Strangers With Candy.'' There are no strangers with candy here, just kind folks with great food: soups and salads, pizza, subs, sandwiches, seafood, pasta and more. As an appetizer, my friend Joe devoured a delicious deep-fried hot dog with extra-tasty sauerkraut ($1.45) and washed it down with New Jersey's own Sea Breeze birch beer. I sampled a decent cheeseburger ($1.75). We then split a medium pie with sausage ($8), which was hot, greasy and good, on a thin, crispy crust. In all, we had one square meal at One Square Mile.

us,Photographer in Spite of Himself,"Julian Dimock did not choose to become a photographer, he did not like taking pictures, and his unheralded career was short. It was also spectacular. At the peak of the Gilded Age, Dimock's father, a wealthy Wall Street financier, was also a conservationist and writer; his son accompanied him around North America to take pictures to illustrate his father's prose. When the elder man died in 1917, Dimock promptly packed up his reflex camera and abandoned his entire body of work, roughly 6,000 glass-plate negatives. For the next 80 years they sat untouched in the research library archives of the American Museum of Natural History. CAMERA MAN'S JOURNEY: Julian Dimock's South (University of Georgia, $39.95) does more than record the Dimocks' excursions to South Carolina in 1904-5; the images refract the harsh light of suffering and privation into visual beatitudes. Dimock captured incalculable depths in his offhand studies of farmers and fishermen, young dandies and aged former slaves. The motley rags of a sawyer, the bulging veins of a blacksmith's hand, even horses and oxen possess a striking luster. In one haunting shot, the bent backs, bowed heads and draped bodies of women float like praying angels above the unyielding desiccation of a cotton field. Something that transcends our recognition of common humanity ultimately emerges from these portraits. Despite sharecropping, repression, poverty, illiteracy, exploitation, powerlessness and the grinding humiliations of segregation, these extraordinary images disclose the wellsprings of nobility.

us,'Emma's War'," Aid makes itself out to be a practical enterprise, but in Africa at least it's romantics who do most of the work-incongruously, because Africa outside of books and movies is hard and unromantic. In Africa the metaphor is always the belly. ""He is eating from that,"" Africans will say, and what they mean is that is how he gets his living. African politics, says the French scholar Jean-Franasois Bayart, is ""the politics of the belly."" The power of the proverbial African big man depends on his ability to feed his followers; his girth advertises the wealth he has to share. In Africa the first obligation of kinship is to share food; and yet, as the Nuer say, ""eating is warring."" They tell this story: Once upon a time Stomach lived by itself in the bush, eating small insects roasted in brush fire, for Man was created apart from Stomach. Then one day Man was walking in the bush and came across Stomach. Man put Stomach in its present place that it might feed there. When it lived by itself, Stomach was satisfied with small morsels of food, but now that Stomach is part of man, it craves more no matter how much it eats. That is why Stomach is the enemy of Man.

us,'The Threatening Storm'," For many long years, Iraq and the United States had little to do with each other. The days of Iraq's greatest glory occurred long before there ever was a United States, and in recent centuries, while America was still a young and relatively isolated nation, the Iraqis were ruled by the Ottoman Turks, whose relationship with the United States barely existed. Even after the fall of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and the formation of the modern state of Iraq, it was Britain, not America, that dominated Iraqi politics for decades. Indeed, as for many Arabs, until only the last few decades, the United States was little more than a strange name of a distant land for most Iraqis. Before the Second World War, the United States had only commercial relationships in the Persian Gulf, and it carefully avoided any involvement in the region's politics. In the decades after the war, Washington did take an increasing interest in the Gulf but mostly focused its attentions on Saudi Arabia and Iran. Iraq was a weak radical Arab state with ties to Russia but did not pose enough of a threat to take seriously. It was not until the 1980s that the two countries came into meaningful contact, and then the limits of their prior relations bred ignorance, miscalculation, and suspicion, leading to regular misreadings of each other's intentions.

The French filmmaker Jean Rouch picked some of the strangest in his 1954 movie ''Les Matres Fous'' (''The Crazy Masters''), about a West African cult in which dancers adopt the identities of their British masters (governor general, engineer, major, corporal of the guard) and then, foaming at the mouth, burn themselves with torches and consume a ''tea'' that consists of sacrificed dog. ''Les Matres Fous'' inspired Jean Genet's play ''The Blacks,'' but the subject matter, suggestive as it was, was not the point. Rouch was the point, with his witty, self-mocking voice-over, the most candid heard to date in nonfiction film. Six years later Rouch would return to Paris and help invent cinma vrit, his being the self-referential kind that focused not just on events but on the filmmaker's role in making them happen. But in ''Les Matres Fous'' he was already speculating wryly about what it meant to make movies like that -- what bizarre identities his membership in the cult of anthropologists had allowed him to adopt.",2002-10-20T05:00:00+0000

The miniflutes come with the wine in a pack of four at liquor stores across the United States for a suggested retail price of $39.99.

The jackets hit the shelves of Le Bon March, an upscale department store in Paris, this November, for about $29. They will also be sold at duty-free stores in the United States and at Sherry-Lehmann on Madison Avenue, for $40. ''Champagne is a very traditional wine, but the packaging, the shape of the bottle, the label, the various boxes -- they change constantly,'' said Daniel Lorson, a spokesman for the Interprofessional Champagne Committee.

Labalme, Henry G. Labalme, Lisa G. Osterland & Victoria A. Labalme, grandmother of six, and sister of Ann H. Poole, all of whom mourn her passing. A graduate of the Brearley School and Magna Cum Laude graduate of Bryn Mawr, she held an M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard, where she was awarded the Caroline A. Wilby prize for her doctoral dissertation as ''the best original work in any department.'' Among her many professional activities, Patricia Labalme was Associate Director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, (1982-1988) and Secretary of the Corporation (1982-1992). From 1992-1997, she was Assistant to the Director, Dr. Phillip A. Griffiths. Most recently, she was a Visitor in the School of Historical Studies, at the IAS. Known also for her dedication to independent school education, she was, among her many affiliations, president of the Brearley Board of Trustees (1978-1982). She was also a trustee of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation (1979Present), the American Academy in Rome (1979-1999), the first female trustee of the Lawrenceville School (1985-1996), and a trustee of the Renaissance Society of America (1982-Present). She was also a member of the Ateneo Veneto and the Istituto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, both in Venice, and Director of the Quantum Chemical Corporation. Her passion for humanism was formed by her lifelong friendships with professors Werner Jaeger, Myron P. Gilmore, Helen Maud Cam, Paul Oskar Kristeller, Vittore Branca and Felix Gilbert. It was Gilbert, her professor at Bryn Mawr and her colleague at the IAS, who, after three decades of encouragement, persuaded her to start her book on Marino Sanudo's diaries. At the time of her death, Dr. Labalme was close to completing this book, which received initial funding from the NEH. The book will be published posthumously under a unique arrangement in which the IAS has created a special position, a Director's Visitor, to be held by Professor Laura S. White, who will oversee the book's completion. A private service was held at the family home in West Cornwall, CT, on October 14. A memorial service will be held at the Marciana Library in Venice.

us,Mapping an Avalanche,"Last month, a glacier that clung to a mountain face in the Russian republic of North Ossetia collapsed, initially sending eight million tons of ice crashing into the valley below. More than 20 million tons of mud, rock and ice had accumulated in the gorge by the time the avalanche stopped. Summer had brought heavy rains, and when the weather turned colder, there was even more ice on the Maili glacier; possibly because of the amassed weight or an earthquake tremor, it finally gave way on Sept. 20. It was the third time in a century that part of this glacier fell, but this avalanche distinguished itself by claiming an estimated 140 lives. Among those lost under the ice were a film crew and Sergei Bodrov Jr., Russia's James Dean, immortalized by the sudden force of nature. As heroes of the Soviet past had begun slipping from collective memory, the boyish Bodrov, 30, won the love of many Russians. His popular and overtly nationalist film ''Brother'' was criticized by some as racist; nevertheless it struck a chord in a nation that had lost its sense of pride. A government official estimates it will take a decade for the icy grave to thaw. The roaring violence of that day is nearly impossible to imagine now. The only reminder is when the ice creaks as it melts. Sabrina Tavernise",2002-10-20T05:00:00+0000

Instead, the arrangement keeps the debt on Xerox's books. The arrangement will have the same impact on Xerox's ability to finance equipment leases as the one originally expected, and investors pushed Xerox's stock up $1.04, to $6.98 a share. Analysts said much of the buying represented relief by investors who had grown nervous when the financing deal took so long to complete.

Neither company would comment yesterday on the specific terms of the new arrangement, which was reached over the weekend.

The Board of Trustees, staff, docents, and volunteers of the Skirball Cultural Center, Los Angeles, express our deepest sorrow upon the death of our beloved friend and Assistant to the President/Secretary to the Board of Trustees, Rabbi Stanley F. Chyet. Dr. Chyet led a life remarkable not only for his own accomplishments but also for his influence on the many people whose lives he touched as a husband, father, poet, professor, mentor, rabbi, colleague, and friend. In the early 1980's, he helped forge the vision for the Skirball Cultural Center one that explores the connections between the age-old Jewish heritage and the vitality of American democratic ideals. Dr. Chyet's wisdom, warmth, and passion for American Jewish history helped shape every aspect of the Skirball. Since opening in 1996, the Skirball has welcomed over 3 million visitors. Its core exhibition, ''Visions and Values: Jewish Life from Antiquity to America,'' is to a major degree the product of his scholarship and teaching brilliance, particularly sections that examine the immigration experience and Jewish life in America. Dr. Chyet loved poetry and was a consummate poet. Through his poetry, he extended the human experience by giving voice to the voiceless. He was a utopian in the truest sense of the word. He taught us that a humane and reflective life is possible and that to be human is somehow not to lose hope in the face of despair, to retain humor in the face of catastrophe, and to realize peace without ignoring conflict. His scholarship, his poetry, his defining humility, and his beautiful humanity will continue to inspire us and all future generations who visit the Skirball Cultural Center. He has left us with an enormous legacy. Howard I. Friedman Chairman, Board of Trustees Skirball Cultural Center Uri D.

In September, the city's Department of Health cut its school nursing budget across the board. Yesterday, Ms. Gotbaum said in a statement, ''Children attending parochial and private schools have the same needs as public school children.'' Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health, responded in a statement, ''Given resource constraints, we cannot continue to provide a higher proportion of nursing services to nonpublic schools without jeopardizing services to public schools.''

The company's stock price fell 31 percent after the report. Revenue will be $100 million to $110 million in the quarter, the company said, short of the $118.9 million expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Sykes had a net loss of $9.35 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $120.3 million a year earlier. The company may close some customer-help centers and cut some jobs because some call-center contracts will end in March. Fourth-quarter revamping costs will reduce pretax results $19 million to $23 million, or 35 cents to 43 cents a share after tax, Sykes said. Shares of Sykes closed down $1.54, at $3.37.",2002-10-22T05:00:00+0000

However, it said it remained cautious because of uncertain spending on technology, a relatively weak consumer market and aggressive competition.

The company reported third-quarter net income of $90 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with $70 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a write-down for the abandonment of a software project, Lexmark earned 79 cents a share in the latest quarter. After Lexmark announced its outlook for the quarter on Oct. 10, analysts raised their expectations to an average of 78 cents a share from 64 cents, according to Thomson First Call.

State law allows up to 5 percent of available tickets to be set aside for a particular group before sale to the public. On Monday, the state attorney general and the state's Division of Consumer Affairs sued Clear Channel Entertainment, which leases PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel. They accused the company of at times selling more than 50 percent of the center's 17,500 seats to American Express cardholders. American Express is not a defendant in the suit. Clear Channel released a statement saying that the company was surprised by the lawsuit. ''We remain committed to complying with New Jersey state law,'' it said.

The company said it needed more time to test the game. Shares in THQ Inc. lost 39 percent after the company said Monday that its 2002 profits would be at the low end of earlier projections, and its 2003 earnings would be far below analyst consensus estimates. The company blamed poor global economic conditions, and the lower-than-expected sales of the Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft Xbox. The news came as the industry prepared for the crucial holiday sales season. But not all video game makers were expressing concern. Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., based in New York, said yesterday that it had received more orders for the new version of ''Grand Theft Auto,'' than it did for the first version of the game, one of the most popular games ever. The new version, ''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,'' is scheduled to reach stores next Tuesday. Matt Richtel (NYT)",2002-10-23T05:00:00+0000

A preliminary study, issued in February by Save the Children U.K. and the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, said refugee children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were frequently forced by camp officials to have sex in exchange for food and medicine. Of the 43 cases of possible sexual exploitation investigated, only 10 were substantiated and none involved a United Nations staff member, the new report said. But it acknowledged that conditions in the camps made refugees vulnerable to sexual exploitation, especially young women, and included 17 recommendations for improvement. Daniel B.

The victim, whose identity was not disclosed, was shot at 8:45 p.m. and pronounced dead about 10:20 p.m. at New Island Hospital in Bethpage, the authorities said. Lt. Dennis Farrell of the Nassau County Police said that after the boy was shot once in the chest, two young men dressed in dark clothing were seen running from the station. It remained unclear what prompted the shooting, which took place near a stairway leading to the station's platform. Investigators said the victim was accompanied by a friend, who was interviewed by detectives last night. Although no trains were at the station, which is in the central business district of Farmingdale, the shooting was witnessed by several people who had just exited a train that departed only moments before, the police said. The shooting caused officials to suspend rail service in both directions from 9 p.m. to 9:36 p.m., said Brian Dolan, a railroad spokesman. Thomas J. Lueck (NYT)",2002-10-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing: Biotechnology," AMGEN POSTS $2.6 BILLION LOSS Amgen Inc. the world's largest biotechnology company, reported a steep third-quarter loss yesterday as acquisition-related costs offset higher drug sales. The company, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said its net loss was $2.6 billion, or $2.10 a share, after a $3 billion charge related to the acquisition in July of the Immunex Corporation; that is in contrast to net income of $330 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, Amgen said earnings rose 32 percent, to $437 million, falling within the range of analysts' expectations. Amgen said its quarterly product sales rose 53 percent, to $1.3 billion, benefiting from the Immunex deal and the introduction of new products. The company projected product sales growth in the high 30 percent range for the full year and said earnings per share, excluding one-time items, would grow at a mid-teens rate. Amgen said it still expected combined sales of Epogen and Aranesp to grow this year in the low 20 percent range compared with 2001, but it raised guidance for Neupogen/Neulasta sales to a range of 32 percent to 34 percent compared with previous guidance of about 25 percent growth.

Predatory lending is the practice of issuing a loan in bad faith that often results in the forfeiture of a borrower's assets. The bill would prohibit companies that issue predatory loans or buy them on the resale market from doing business with the city. Mr. Bloomberg, in a statement, expressed concern about predatory lending but said the measure was defective and ''not the appropriate vehicle for addressing these concerns.''

But the companies said they intended to resubmit the application with the questions answered in a few months. The grass, intended primarily for golf courses, has attracted attention because it would be the first major non-agricultural genetically modified crop. The grass has a gene that allows it to withstand Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, allowing groundskeepers to spray herbicide to kill weeds while leaving the grass intact. The Washington-based International Center for Technology Assessment, an environmental group, opposed the application, saying that the type of grass involved, creeping bentgrass, can be a weed and that giving it resistance to Roundup would make it harder to kill and that the herbicide tolerance gene might spread to other grassy weeds. Jim King, a spokesman for Scotts, said that creeping bentgrass was not a type suitable for consumer lawns and would not be sold that way. He would not reveal what questions the Agriculture Department had regarding the application. But he said that withdrawal of an application is not uncommon and that Scotts hoped to have the grass on the market by late 2003 or 2004. Andrew Pollack(NYT)",2002-10-24T05:00:00+0000

us,World Business Briefing | Europe: Legal Dispute Over Cegetel,"Vivendi Universal is suing the Vodafone Group in an attempt to gain more time to put together a counterbid for Cegetel, the large French phone company. Last week, Vodafone offered to buy the 85 percent of Cegetel it did not already own for 13.1 billion euros ($12.8 billion). The offer includes the stakes held by the BT Group, SBC Communications and Vivendi. Under the terms of a shareholder agreement, Vivendi has the option of counterbidding and can supersede Vodafone's offer for the BT or SBC stakes. Vodafone has given Vivendi a deadline of Nov. 10 to make a counteroffer. Vivendi's plans to either buy those stakes or try to get Vodafone to offer a higher price suffered a setback this week, when Vivendi received unacceptable offers for its publishing division, which includes Houghton Mifflin. It has now decided to auction Houghton Mifflin at a later date if it does not receive higher bids by tomorrow. Vivendi is arguing that the Nov. 10 deadline violates part of the Cegetel shareholder agreement, which stipulates that any offer for Cegetel must be accompanied by a 30-day grace period for due diligence. Vodafone says that rule does not apply to existing shareholders, who are already familiar with the company. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)",2002-10-25T05:00:00+0000

There are enough restaurants so that none can afford to be mediocre, and it's hard to go out without hearing live jazz, bluegrass, rock or ethnic music. (Pick up a copy of The Ithaca Times -- a free weekly entertainment paper lying around in delis and coffeehouses -- to see who's playing where.)

His father ''answered only 'Yes,' 'No,' 'Maybe,' / and never volunteered a private thought''; his mother put up with the silence until the day she walked out and the father followed her in the family car, ''driving beside her, slow as a beginner, / pleading, my baby brother and I / crying out the windows, 'Mama, don't go!' / It was a scene to break your heart / or make you laugh -- those wailing kids, / a woman walking briskly with a suitcase, / the slow car following like a faithful dog.'' Yet Bowers's recollections have an extra dimension because they are set in the segregated South, and his memories of life there can be ugly as well as winsome, often at the same time. In one poem he refuses to forgive himself for his cruelty to the first black student admitted to his school, a classmate whose name he never even bothered to learn. In another, he pretends to be the champion sprinter Wilma Rudolph ''breaking / the finish-line tape, / ashamed to have such thoughts, / not because I was a boy / but because I was white, / proud of her just the same, / of the speed that carried her / down the world's ellipse, / out of our shared hometown.''

Just walking through the door is guaranteed to work knots out of your shoulders. Instrumental music plays in the background, and a flat-screen television flashes underwater scenes of coral and fish. Then there are the beverages, which promise to pep you up, slim you down and do everything else that mud baths, hot stones and water jets might do. Not that the regular smoothies -- which cost $4.50 to $4.75 and come in 20-plus flavors -- do all that. They're just 24 ounces of refreshment, a not-too-sweet blend of juice, fresh fruit, ice and sherbet or frozen yogurt. The spa factor comes in from eight exotic ''boosters'' that can be added to any drink. With names like flu fighter and fat stripper, they rev the smoothies up with blends of vitamins, minerals, protein powder and other ingredients both familiar (chamomile) and strange (kava kava root). It might take practice before you can order a boosted smoothie with a straight face. Imagine requesting Temptation with a Sex Drive in front of your mother. (That's a smoothie with guava juice, mango, banana and pineapple sherbet boosted with yohimbe bark, Siberian ginseng and saw palmetto.)

Is there a style, high or low, that has not felt the influence of Fifth Avenue, or Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn, or the Rue Bonaparte, where Isabella Blow, above, a sometimes muse to designers, appears as a wind-tossed apparition blown across the old Parisian cobblestones. ''Everything in fashion begins in the street,'' the fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg said. Take cargo pants, one of the most ubiquitous of garments, whose entry into the fashion mainstream was anything but top down. ''That didn't come from anyone in 'fashion,''' said Julie Gilhart, the fashion director of Barneys. ''It came from the street.'' So, too, did buttocks-baring trousers, and preppy plaids worn ironically, and do-rags and belt buckles with one's name spelled out in block letters. None of these notions originated on any designer's sketch pad and yet each turned up on the fall runways of Dolce & Gabbana, Jean Paul Gaultier and Anna Sui. The photo essays Bill Cunningham contributed to The Times -- since 1989 in a column called ''On the Street'' and for years before under other titles -- have played a compelling part in recording the ephemeral nature of self-invention. Positioning himself in the slipstream of urban imagery, Mr. Cunningham has created an almanac of what city dwellers were wearing at various points in the late 20th century and, probably more important, what they were thinking about themselves at the time.",2002-10-27T05:00:00+0000

There weren't rapists and child molesters; there were what I call professional escape artists, high-time burglars, kidnappers. I robbed banks. I got there in November 1953, about a month earlier than Jerie. I saw Jerie at a reunion in the 90's. We've been good friends ever since. I knew him at Alcatraz -- there were only 250-some-odd men out there. But I wasn't a personal friend of his. Actually, we'd had a fight. Jerie was running his mouth in his cell. I said, 'Will you shut your mouth tonight?' He said, 'Tell me to shut up tomorrow.' Next day, coming in from work, I punched him. I had him in a bad position. I'm not saying I won; I'm saying I would have won. The screws broke us up -- that's what we called some officers, screws. After that, I didn't talk to Jerie the rest of the time on Alcatraz.''",2002-10-27T05:00:00+0000

For this purpose he established the Annual Student Symposium at which college student leaders from around the nation and abroad came to interact with government leaders and other senior level specialists on issues instrumental to the American Presidency.

As a child he tapdanced with his Irish-born father and in WWII made Naval training movies. His first professional job was in Harvey. Unsure of show business, he worked as a traffic manager for Pan Am. Actress, Amelia Baines, convinced him to return to theatre. Smitten, he never did anything else. He married Amelia and they had two daughters. Dennis Harrison was one of 1950's television most recognizable faces. He was television's first vampire in a 1951 episode of Stage 13. He won awards for theatrical portrayals in The Life of Father Flannigan and The Life of Thomas Moore. His big break was The Liar, directed by Alfred Drake. Dennis' chiseled good looks, phenomenal charm, and gifted singing voice brought him to Hollywood using his middle name as his last. As Dennis Patrick, he guest-starred in more than 1,000 television shows. In the 1960s, divorced, he returned to New York appearing in several plays including an award-winning Marat Sade. There, in 1970, he met and wed actress Barbara Cason. They were a quintessential show-biz couple working extensively from coast to coast and sharing everything in their lives with family and friends. Lucky were the guests at homey, funny dinner parties of food, music, laughter, and story telling. Dennis was in three series: Bert D'Angelo Superstar with Paul Sorvino, Dallas, as a chief suspect in the shooting of JR, and Dark Shadows, reprising a vampire role. Motion picture credits include, Joe with Peter Boyle, The Air Up There with Kevin Bacon, The House of Dark Shadows, and The Secret of Nikola Tesla with Orson Welles. Dennis continued working following the untimely 1990 death of his wife, Barbara Cason, though he was forever changed. On October 13, in the house Dennis and Barbara had shared, a fire claimed Dennis and his dog, Josh. A word-loving, voracious reader, who enjoyed life, remembered countless stories and jokes, he was proud, funny, sweet, and eternally in love with Barbara Cason.

The Board of Directors and The Members of The University Glee Club of New York City mourn with deep sadness the passing of their Brother in Song and Past President, L. Neiland Gallagher. Neil joined The Glee Club as a second tenor in 1954, shortly after having earned a degree in English from Amherst College in 1951. From the beginning, he participated in many of The Club's activities. One of his greatest successes was playing the hilarious role of ''Adelaide'' in the stag ''Hairy Leg'' rendition of ''Guys and Dolls.'' One critic of his performance said: ''Gallagher was a born Broadway actress with a Bronx accent who sang as sweetly as Vivian Blaine.'' He served on The Board of Directors for many years, eventually becoming Vice President in 1977 and President in 1979. With the establishment of The International Concert Tours, as a Club tradition in 1987, Neil went overseas and sang with The Club in each and every one of those adventurous journeys, including the most recent concert tour to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic this past summer. He is renowned for his conducting of his beloved ''Lord Jeffrey Amherst'' around the world and successfully accomplished this one last time while in Hungary. He was famous for remembering every bit of minutia, detail and trivia that came across his mind. As a result he was appointed Club Historian. Because of his depth of knowledge of The UGC's history, its constitution and traditions, he was regularly asked by The Board to be the speaker at The Induction Ceremony of each new incoming freshman class. Neil was a unique individual, intelligent, a man of action, a loving father and a good friend. In his life he had four great loves: his family, The University Glee Club of New York City, Amherst College, and The United States Marine Corps (he saw action in Okinawa and was part of the Occupation Forces in Tsingtao, China). It was not an option to love one more than the other, he loved them all equally. We shall miss him and he is remembered fondly by all of his Brothers in Song at The University Glee Club of New York City.",2002-10-29T05:00:00+0000

The warning pushed up interest rates in the Philippines, which is struggling to pay for a war on terrorism after a series of bombings in the last six months. The agency now rates the Philippines BB+ for foreign-currency debts, just below investment grade. Standard & Poor's said it expected no change in its comparable rating of Indonesia, already well below investment grade at CCC+, despite the economic harm expected after the bombing in Bali.

''My war is over,'' he said in a television documentary broadcast in Northern Ireland. Since the suspension this month of the Catholic-Protestant power-sharing government, in which Mr. McGuinness served, republicans have been under pressure to move to disarm and disband the I.R.A.

us,Isles Fall Again After Early Lead," What started out as perhaps a minor slide to open the N.H.L. season has turned into a troubling slump for the Islanders. They dropped their third game in a row and fourth in five games, falling to the Carolina Hurricanes, 4-2, last night at the RBC Center in Raleigh, N.C. For the second night in a row, the Islanders took an early 2-0 lead and watched it disappear. On Tuesday, it was Phoenix that rallied from a 2-0 first-period deficit to post a 3-2 victory at Nassau Coliseum. Last night, the Hurricanes did the same, coming back from two goals down with three second-period goals. The Islanders are 1-3 in games in which they led after the first period. More significant, a season after finishing second in the Atlantic Division, the Islanders are last in the division at 3-6-1-0. Power-play goals by Shawn Bates and the rookie Justin Mapletoft gave the Islanders the 2-0 advantage against Carolina. Mapletoft's goal was his first in the N.H.L. But Carolina responded with a three-goal second period, two of the goals coming on power plays. Sami Kapanen closed the score to 2-1 when he took a pass from Bates Battaglia in front of the net and beat Islanders goalie Garth Snow from close range 4 minutes 28 seconds into the period. Then Jeff O'Neill scored on a rebound of a Kapanen shot to tie it at 8:35. When defenseman Niclas Wallin beat Snow between the pads with a low wrist shot from above the left circle pads at 15:46, the Hurricanes had the lead for good. Rod Brind'Amour added an empty-net goal with 26 seconds left. It was the second start in a row for Snow, who replaced the slumping Chris Osgood. It was the first time Snow had started consecutive games with Osgood healthy since last December. ",2002-10-30T05:00:00+0000

That unit, Orange, is France's biggest mobile phone company and is counting on new features to increase sales. In a partnership with Microsoft this month in Britain, it began selling wireless phones that will let users store address books, music and calendars and view e-mail messages.

General Sir Robert Ford, 78, who was responsible for the British Army's day-to-day operations at the time, denied that his recommendations, which were outside the army's rules of engagements, condoned killing. ''The suggestion to shoot a few leaders was not an instruction to kill -- 'shoot' and 'kill' are obviously different words,'' he said.

Net income in the third quarter was $4 million, or 1 cent a share, in contrast to a loss of $27.9 million, or 14 cents a share, in the period a year ago, Broadwing, the parent of the local-phone provider Cincinnati Bell, said in a statement yesterday.

Mooney, who replaced Richard Ellenberger last month, is cutting expenses so the company can meet $1.2 billion in debt payments due in the next two years. Mr. Mooney said on a conference call he would try to persuade Broadwing's banks to extend the maturity on $1 billion in debt due in 2004. Broadwing will cut about 500 jobs, or about 25 percent of the staff, at its Broadwing Communications unit, the company's high-speed Internet network.

us,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Corning Posts Loss And Cuts Jobs,"Corning, the maker of fiber optic cable, posted its sixth consecutive quarterly loss yesterday and said it would cut another 2,200 jobs, or 8.5 percent of its global payroll. Corning has already said it would cut 4,600 jobs this year because of weakness in telecommunications spending. Last year it eliminated 12,000 jobs. The latest round of cuts will bring Corning's work force to about 23,500. Sales in the latest quarter fell 45 percent to $837 million from $1.51 billion a year earlier, and the company reported a loss of $260 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a loss of $220 million, or 24 cents a share, a year ago. Corning plans to take a fourth-quarter charge of $550 million to $650 million to account for the layoffs and the closing of optical fiber plants in Australia and Germany, and the shutdown of a facility in Concord, N.C. Although the company said it would consider future cost-cutting moves, it expected annual savings of at least $165 million from this latest round of cuts.

That is in contrast to net income of $128.6 million in the third quarter of last year. Revenue fell 30 percent, to $340 million, while product revenue fell 42 percent, to $220 million, in large part because of competition from new generic versions of Elan's Zanaflex, a muscle spasm treatment. The chairman, Garo Armen, said that the figures were better than expected and that Elan had made aggressive steps toward completing its recovery plan. ''We're inundated with calls'' from potential buyers for noncore assets, which the company is selling to raise $1.5 billion by December 2003, Mr. Armen said. Elan has made 700 of 1,000 planned job cuts, and will have more than $1 billion in cash when recent product sales are completed. Brian Lavery (NYT)",2002-10-31T05:00:00+0000
