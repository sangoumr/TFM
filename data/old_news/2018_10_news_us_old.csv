But those who have followed the Korean restaurant scene over the years will recognize the update of one of its pioneers, the elegant Woo Lae Oak, which opened in SoHo in 1999 and closed seven years ago. It was founded by Young Sook Choi, the mother of the new Woos present owner, Julie Choi, whose grandmother brought a branch of Woo Lae Oak from Seoul, South Korea, to Midtown Manhattan in 1974. The new restaurant, which can seat up to 150, occupies the multistory brick-walled space that was Fiamma, then Costata. The ground floor, with a bar and an open kitchen counter, is more intimate than the upstairs. There are tabletop grills throughout, not just for the usual beef and pork, but eventually for meats like ostrich and venison, which Ms. Choi plans to introduce. Today, Korean food has become much more familiar, so you dont have to let the seasonings overpower, Ms. Choi said. We are showcasing the ingredients. Appetizers, Korean barbecue, hot-pot stews and some traditional dishes like bo ssam pork belly in a lettuce wrap are on the menu. The chef, Eli Martinez, a native of Honduras who worked up through the ranks, was at the previous SoHo restaurant.

A narrow but soaring space, the restaurant has a fish tank opposite the bar on the ground floor, and two more tanks on a loftlike second floor.

In addition to the freshly caught seafood, the menu offers a vast array of Japanese standbys, mostly seafood, including salads, sushi, hand rolls and rice and noodle dishes.

Hardy, too, was passionate about dance as well as drawing, disciplines he pursued even as he worked toward a teaching degree in plastic arts from the cole Normale Suprieure Paris-Saclay in Cachan. After graduation, he joined a modern dance troupe and drew illustrations for European fashion magazines such as Vanity Fair Italia and Vogue Hommes. In 1987, he took a position styling shoes at Christian Dior, and so began his distinguished career in fashion. Herms was next to notice Hardys talents, naming him creative director of its mens and womens shoes in 1990  and, later, of its haute joaillerie. In 1999, he started his own label, known for its color-blocked saddlebags and mens sneakers. Soon after, Nicolas Ghesquire, then the designer of Balenciaga, asked him to oversee womens shoes for the brand  a decade-long collaboration that resulted in some of Hardys most beloved designs, including his futuristic Lego sandal and platform Oxfords with Formica-tiled heels.",2018-10-12T14:53:02+0000

The British writer Jessie Greengrasss first novel, Sight, can be fit into that group but offers its own distinct philosophical and lyrical pleasures. It is told by an unnamed narrator who recounts struggling with the decision of whether to have children with her partner, Johannes. (In real life, Ms. Greengrass has two young children.) Told in patient, psychologically complex prose, Sight combines the narrators thoughts about her own mother, who died several years earlier, and her remembrances of her grandmother, a psychoanalyst, with her relevant digressions about scientific history. (Real-life figures contemplated in the book include Sigmund Freud; Wilhelm Rntgen, who discovered X-rays; and John Hunter, an 18th-century surgeon and anatomist.) The narrators thoughts about having children undergirds the story, but the novel is also concerned with the nature of grief, selfhood and memory. Below, Ms. Greengrass talks about the early history of psychoanalysis, writing a novel while starting her own family and more.",2018-10-14T15:00:01+0000

They tend, by nature, to be needle-threaders, nonparticipants, mediators. Their current mood is wistful, but also annoyed and sometimes threatened.

When the final was run, it turned out to be the race of their lives.

Now, Reno Christou, who heads the group behind these establishments, has opened another taste of Greece, this time on the Upper West Side. The ground floor has a central bar and seats all around, with a fairly intimate 40-seat dining room off to one side. Its just the beginning, since downstairs, the spacious main dining room can accommodate 130 people with an appetite not just for seafood, as at Kyma, but also for what the director of operations, Joe Ragonese, describes as more traditional, Greek home cooking. The chef, David Perez, was at Estiatorio Milos. There are braised gigantes beans with tomatoes and feta, roasted cauliflower fritters and grilled sausages among the starters, in addition to raw-bar items and the typical spreads like skordalia. Main courses are split about 50-50 meat to fish. We think it will be a different clientele in this location, Mr. Ragonese said. And we also think that what Elea offers would be easier to replicate in other neighborhoods. The room is done in beige accented with white, with vintage pottery accents.",2018-10-16T16:32:42+0000

One of the six cover subjects of Ts 2018 Greats issue, she is among the most radically innovative artists working today. In a career spanning nearly five decades  working across photography, video, installations and public art campaigns  Weems has laid bare the historical biases that guide our own actions and shape our perceptions of others. Take, for example, her series Museums (2006present), in which the artist stares down the pyramidal glass portal to the Louvre, the sinuous curves of the Guggenheim Bilbao, and the august colonnade of the British Museum, as though to challenge the institutions that have long determined what counts as culture and beauty. In this project, and in the dozens more that comprise her practice, Weems addresses questions of power, violence, exclusion, access and authority  especially as they pertain to race and gender  and dares her viewers to do the same. The pathos in all of her works, from intimate photographs of her family to series involving archival images of enslaved Africans, unites her subjects and viewers in a common humanity.",2018-10-17T16:10:20+0000

Modern musks can be filthy, dainty, weighty, wispy; in short, theyre unpredictable. But the distinctive quality all musks share is a certain lushness, a tendency to smell as opulent as cashmere feels. Frdric Malle, the founder of his eponymous French fragrance house, says, Musk conveys different ideas based on what it is paired with.

us,Japanese Beef: Made in America,"Increasingly American ranches have been raising Wagyu, from at least two Japanese breeds of cattle, and there are now many sources making the rich, well-marbled beef available not just to chefs, but also to home cooks. Kurt Beecher Dammeier, the founder of Beechers Handmade Cheese, is the chief executive of Mishima Reserve, a company that contracts with ranches across the West to raise the cattle; he has just started selling the meat retail online. Another source, KC Cattle Company, in Weston, Mo., is run by and employs only veterans. Ten percent of the profits go to veterans causes. The company was started by Patrick Montgomery after his military service and raises all its own cattle. I compared several cuts of Wagyu from both companies. All were delectably tender, but I found that the KC Cattle strip steak had more umami-like complexity than Mishima Reserve, which had a simpler beefy flavor. The Mishima Reserve rib-eye cap, which comes in several grades, could not be beat. KC Cattle offers more big cuts for roasting and braising, while Mishima Reserve is a better source for interesting steaks like the zabuton (Denver steak).
