us,To Market,"In recent years, Americans have made a significant shift in not only what they eat but also how much they know about what they eat. It is no longer unusual for home cooks to drop the name of an heirloom potato and go on to tell you about the soil in which it was grown and the farmer who raised it. They know the provenance of a Meyer lemon, the seasonal peak for apricots and the difference between a watermelon and an icicle radish. But this skill has stopped at meats. We like to know our meat is organic and pasture-raised, but we prefer not to think about the process by which the frisky, mud-hoofed Berkshire pig arrives on our tables as pork chops. It is time to stop being squeamish. It will be better for us (we'll eat healthier animals) and for the animals (they'll be raised with more care). It's the missing piece in Americans' efforts to right the food industry's course and to bring the cycle of life out of the shadows. In this issue, we celebrate the chicken, one of the greatest victims of factory farming. In ""The British Housewife,"" an 18th-century home companion that hews to this cycle of life and to contemporary ideals, Martha Bradley writes that young chickens are at their best this time of year. She suggests roasting them with ham tucked under the skin, instructs us to eat asparagus, radishes and strawberries, and emphasizes the importance of anchovies.

Margulies has encountered only one entertaining disaster to date, dropping a 25-pound Thanksgiving turkey, brine included, on her kitchen floor, an experience that made her realize that she needs ''to have a big, strong man around.'' Pretty soon she'll be whipping up her favorite recipe from class -- sea bass in a Pernod butter sauce on a bed of fennel -- in a newly renovated kitchen. She even donned goggles and gloves to help with the demolition. ''It's quite fun,'' Margulies says of mallet wielding. Could chicken paillard be next?",2005-05-01T05:00:00+0000

us,That's Entertaining,"loom Mona Nerenberg's store in Sag Harbor, N.Y., may be tiny, but it's home to a sizable vision. Occupying the ground floor and courtyard of a charming 19th-century clapboard house at 43 Madison Street, the shop offers a chic hodgepodge of antiques and contemporary home and garden accessories that share a common thread. ''I gravitate toward products made by artisans,'' Nerenberg says. ''I don't like things that look manufactured.'' Her palette? Cream, natural, white and gray, with touches of pale blue.1. After dinner, Nerenberg gives guests a little time to relax before she puts on the ''Summer of Sam'' soundtrack, cranking it up on her Bose 151 SE outdoor speakers (in white, natch); $278. Go to www.bose.com. Like all good party givers, she knows it's not a real party until the dancing begins. 2. She serves them on plates by the British ceramist Brickett Davda. The De Renaudin bamboo cheese knife is $75.3. For seated dinners, Nerenberg sets the table with unusual place mats and napkins. This block-printed napkin, $55 for four, is by John Robshaw Textiles.4. To go with the vegetables, the hostess serves small dishes of salt -- either La Baleine Sel de Mer Gros (around $3 at supermarkets) or My Sag Harbor, an herbal salt made by Rima & Sons. It is $13 at Cavaniola's Gourmet Cheese Shop, 89B Division Street, the best source in the area for artisanal cheeses and a well-edited selection of sundries.5. More cermaics by Brickett Davda. This platter is $95. 6. Nerenberg is obsessed with white straw this season. She places stacks of these big pillows, $375 each, around the courtyard for extra seating. ''I also see them on chaises near the pool.''7. Nerenberg likes to drag an antique dining table outside and place gleaming, silver-plated pitchers of vodka gimlets along its length. To make a gimlet, combine 1 1/2 ounces Grey Goose or Absolut vodka, 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice and 3 tablespoons Rose's lime juice in a shaker. Shake and serve over ice.8. Additional glow is provided by handblown votive holders, which come in clear, white, natural and blue and cost $35 each.9. One of her more offbeat accessory finds is a salt-and-pepper shaker set designed by Marcel Marongiu for Artoria Limoges, $56: ''They're very organic-looking. They could be rocks, and I love rocks on a table.10. Every party at Bloom features ''beautiful-looking bread'' and local handmade cheeses from Cavaniola's, like Shawondasee, Mecox Sunrise and Atlantic Mist from the nearby Mecox Bay Dairy.11. The shop may be called Bloom, but that doesn't mean you'll find flowers on the table. ''I prefer the look of fresh produce as centerpieces or decoration,'' Nerenberg explains. During the summer, she buys fruits and vegetables from Jim Pike's farm stand on Sagg Main Street in Sagaponack, N.Y. Her favorites are, of course, white. ''French icicle radishes look beautiful in a big glass bowl,'' she says. ''Or if your local nursery has extra wooden flats -- the kind hyacinths come in -- those are even better.''12. During the summer, Nerenberg entertains in the shop's pea-grit courtyard. ''I've had more parties there than anywhere else,'' she says. ''It's like the South of France in the middle of Sag Harbor.'' Her soirees are always illuminated by candlelight. ''One of my customers found this nickel-plated lantern'' -- $450 -- ''for me in Mexico. It's about three feet high, which makes it very dramatic. I like to group a few of them together.''13. Her favorite chaise was designed in 1966 by Richard Schultz; it starts at $2,310 at DelGreco & Company, 232 East 59th Street, New York.",2005-05-01T05:00:00+0000

us,On the Cover; Learning the Routes,"IT'S not surprising that ""Riding the Bus With My Sister,"" the 2003 autobiographical book by Rachel Simon that inspired tonight's Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation, is set in a city that is never named. If word got out about the town's terrific bus drivers, the regulars would be standing in the aisles. And Ms. Simon's sister, Beth, the most fanatic of regulars, would be among them. In her book, Ms. Simon describes Beth (near right, with Ms. Simon) as ""a person with mental retardation."" She now prefers ""with a developmental or cognitive disability,"" she said, although Beth likes ""a person with special needs"" -- one of them being the freedom to bus-hop around her city for most of the day. Like the book, the film, shown at 9 on CBS, is about the year Ms. Simon decided to enter her sister's world on wheels, but includes flashbacks to their childhood. During her time en route, Ms. Simon discovered the kindness of strangers (there are 12 bus drivers in her book, reduced to two composites in the movie), as well as the special abilities of the sister she had worried too much about for 38 years. ""I've inadvertently become a national speaker for both the disability community and the public transit industry, and I meet bus drivers all around the country,"" she said. ""They're a type of person that is well represented by the people in the movie -- very giving people, sensitive people, people people."" It was at the house of one of Beth's bus-driving buddies that Ms. Simon and her sister first watched the film, which stars Andie MacDowell as a dewy-eyed Rachel and Rosie O'Donnell as a bouncy, beat-you-to-the-bus-door Beth. ""What Rosie got,"" Ms. Simon said, ""was exactly what she wanted to get: a character who is being portrayed not as a stereotype but as a full person -- someone who isn't going to be pushed around."" Not even to the film's Los Angeles premiere. ""Oh, yeah, she knows what she wants,"" Ms. Simon said of the real Beth. ""She doesn't want to be on an airplane. And what's the fun of sitting in a movie theater with movie stars if you can sit on a bus with your favorite driver?"" JODY ALESANDRO",2005-05-01T05:00:00+0000

In the suit, filed in December in Essex County Superior Court and made public last Monday, the State Division of Youth and Family Services and the Newark school system were accused of negligence in the care of the boy, Faheem Williams. Two of the boy's brothers were also found in the basement of the home of their mother's cousin, Sherry Murphy. The children were in foster care with Ms. Murphy, who with her son, Wesley Murphy, have been charged in Faheem's death. Faheem's brothers and their mother, Melinda Williams, are also plaintiffs in the suit. The brothers were severely emaciated when they were found. They have since been placed in foster care elsewhere. Foster-care authorities had received 11 complaints of abuse and neglect about the children, but the case was closed after a division worker was unable to locate them. The state has countersued Ms. Murphy, saying she was responsible for Faheem's death. Tina Kelley",2005-05-01T05:00:00+0000

Kushner had discovered he was not the university's first choice to speak (Jon Stewart was), and he stepped up to the podium and said: ""I think I should begin by acknowledging your disappointment that I am not Jon Stewart. Think how I feel. Your disappointment that I am not Jon Stewart will last one morning; I am disappointed at not being Jon Stewart every morning of my life."" Funny graduation speeches, alas, are rarely turned into bite-size books to be marketed around the time of later graduations. Earnest speeches frequently are. Anna Quindlen's new book, ""Being Perfect,"" is based on the graduation speech she gave at Mount Holyoke in 1999. And Maria Shriver's new book, ""And One More Thing Before You Go . . . ,"" is expanded from a luncheon speech she delivered not long ago to graduating high school girls and their mothers. (Shriver's bold advice includes ""Learn from your mistakes"" and ""You'll need a lot of courage."") Shriver's book hits the hardcover miscellaneous list this week at No. 3, pushed along by an appearance on ""Oprah,"" during which Oprah introduced her by intoning the 11 words every woman with a new book dreams of hearing from her: ""My old girlfriend, old, old, old, we go so far back.""",2005-05-01T05:00:00+0000

The holders, designed in 1910 by Josef Hoffman, a cofounder of the Wiener Werkst* tte in Vienna and a seminal proto-Modernist, are being reproduced for the design shop of the Neue Galerie, the museum of German and Austrian art on Fifth Avenue at 86th Street. I looked at these two handsome grips ($280 for two pairs), which didn't look much like the plastic ears of corn that I'd grown up eating corn on the cob between, and narrowed my eyes. Hoffman, a contemporary of Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Arthur Schnitzler and Alban Berg, designed corncob picks? In fin-de-sicle Vienna, one of the most sophisticated cities in Europe, where people like Wittgenstein lived and loved on a diet of people like Freud, they ate corn on the cob? Tell me another! Christian Witt-Doerring, a curator of the Neue Galerie, speaking from Vienna, speared my suspicion end to end. ""It was peasant food, but it was also consumed by the well-to-do,"" he said. ""If you understand how court and aristocracy worked, you had money, but you didn't show you had money."" Consequently, Witt-Doerring added, the emperor ate corn with his hands. ""It would have been an affectation by the newly rich to use the Hoffman holders."" I picked up a holder in each hand, admiring them like jewelry, and thought of summer, and the Hamptons' season starting, and the $250,000 rentals, and the sports cars nosed up like sharks to the farm stands, and stacks of field-fresh corn, sheathed in silk and grasshopper-green. How much design can a sweet kernel of truth bear? Hoffman's silver is as cool as shade to the touch. It depends, I decided, on how much butter you want to get on your fingers. WILLIAM L.

us,The Remix; Last Licks,"Real frozen custard -- creamy, dense and so smooth that premium ice cream seems bland and grainy in comparison -- is almost impossible to taste in New York, even though it rose to fame on the Coney Island boardwalk in the 1920's. But Wisconsin is called the Dairy State for a reason, and anyone visiting Madison must go to Michael's Frozen Custard, where dozens of flavors, from butter pecan to mint chip, are dished out at four locations, old-timey shacks in converted gas stations. Madisonians are partial to the sundaes with hot fudge, caramel and toasted, salted pecans, but purists order the vanilla. Fresh tasting, with the heady, eggy perfume of homemade tapioca pudding, it gets its signature pale yellow hue from egg yolks. Michael Dix, 45, who started the business in 1986 with frozen-custard machines from the 1940's, loves the color so much that he had a bedroom painted to match. Now, on a hot summer day, he serves up to 750 gallons (mail order is available from www.ilovemichaels.com). During a short trip two summers ago, I limited myself to a baby cup the first day. By the second I'd upgraded to a medium, which looked as though it might easily be a full pint.

A smattering of radio stations now play their music, but they still consider gas money before committing to a show. Road trips as a way of life have an unexpected benefit, however. Traveling musicians, like truck drivers, develop a keen radar for where to exit for the best food. Which means that any given route might suggest the possibility of jalapeo-topped hamburgers, barbecued black-bean tacos, pork ribs, beef brisket, crispy soft-shell-crab sandwiches and shrimp fajitas loaded with guacamole.",2005-05-01T05:00:00+0000

us,The Plummers' Summer Place,"Attention, theatrical birdwatchers. A couple of rare species will be on view this summer at the Stratford Festival in Canada. ""The Lark,"" Jean Anouilh's rarely seen meditation on the life of Joan of Arc, will land on the festival stage at the end of July. Starring in the production will be another elusive creature, Amanda Plummer, whose infrequent stage appearances are always worth noting. (Ms. Plummer was last seen in New York in Tracy Letts's ""Killer Joe"" back in 1998; she withdrew from his play ""Bug,"" an Off Broadway hit from last year, shortly before it opened.) Although Ms. Plummer will be making her Stratford Festival debut, her arrival is a homecoming of sorts. Now the whole family will have played Stratford. Her parents -- Christopher Plummer and Tammy Grimes -- are both alums. Her father's triumphant performance in ""King Lear"" was a highlight of recent Stratford seasons, and theater buffs may also recall that Mr. Plummer appeared in the original Broadway production of ""The Lark"" in 1955, playing the Earl of Warwick opposite Julie Harris's Joan of Arc. The Stratford production, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, will use the same Lillian Hellman adaptation, but this time, Joan's trial will unfold against the backdrop of Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943.

us,"Don't Tell Anybody, but Des Moines Has Good Opera","""Best Kept Secret"" was an award granted to the Des Moines Metro Opera by a local association a couple of years ago, and it certainly seems appropriate. Working in a part of the country all too few East and West Coasters associate with opera, the company, situated in Indianola, 12 miles south of Des Moines, has been mounting quality productions with young professionals (like Lauren Flanigan before she became famous) for more than 30 years. The theater may be small (488 seats), but the repertory is not: where many small regional companies favor musicals and light opera, this group's past repertory runs to things like ""Aida"" and Strauss's ""Ariadne auf Naxos."" Critics have reacted with accolades: in The Chicago Tribune in 1999, Lawrence A. Johnson called the company's production of ""Street Scene"" by Kurt Weill ""my single most memorable event of the year,"" while Brian Kellow of ""Opera News"" described the 2002 season as something ""any company could be proud of."" Part of the success is attributed to the scrupulous attention to detail of the founding artistic director, Robert L. Larsen. This summer's three productions, taking place from June 24 to July 17, give a good sense of the company's programming, with two works that are familiar but by no means easy, Donizetti's ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" and Offenbach's ""Tales of Hoffmann"" (Dean Elzinga, a bass-baritone familiar from City Opera, plays the villains) and one rarely performed English-language opera, Britten's wonderful and underrated ""Gloriana.""

Born April 16, 1908, his life embodied the American story of the 20th century. The child of immigrants, he had to leave school after the 10th grade to work and help support the family. By his early twenties, he had started a family business, including his father and brother Ben, manufacturing and retailing women's gloves. After becoming glove makers for vaudeville and theater stars, they became a successful retail chain, selling women's accessories. Running his end of the business from White Plains, the glove shops and ""Moe"" were an institution on Mamaroneck Avenue for 50 years. At 75, he decided it was time to try something new. Self educated throughout his life, he became an educator, teaching and mentoring others for the next 21 years. By the time he turned 96, he had been written up in the New York Times and had been formally recognized by the City of White Plains, Westchester County, the State of New York and the SBA for his contributions teaching in local schools and colleges and counseling young entrepreneurs, first at American Women's Economic Development in NYC, where was the head counselor, and until a few months ago, at SCORE in White Plains. A true philanthropist, Murray gave his time, his experience, his wisdom, his considerable knowledge and his caring, helping hundreds of people, many of them immigrants and the children of immigrants, realize their own business dreams.

Gideon Oliver, a lawyer who represents many of the bicyclists, said that all of those arrested were released with desk appearance tickets, which would allow them to appear before a judge at a later time. The ride is ostensibly a demonstration to promote using a means of transportation other than cars, but it has led to an increasingly tense series of standoffs with the police. Since Critical Mass organized a rally that swelled to 5,000 riders during the Republican National Convention last August, the rides have become a point of contention with the police. Arrests have become common, and the bicyclists have sought to evade police officers. On Friday night, more than 400 people gathered in Union Square Park and fanned out to locations in Lower Manhattan, including Tompkins Square Park, in the East Village, and Madison Square Park, in the Flatiron district. The arrests on Friday will not affect future rides, Mr. Oliver said, because ""there aren't organizers such that you can in any consistent way change plans.""

The American Civil Liberties Union, its officers, Board of Directors and staff deeply mourn the passing of a principled, influential and pioneering leader on civil liberties. Dr. Clark was 90. The US Supreme Court cited his study on the effects of racial discrimination as an influence in its historic 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. The ACLU was a friend-of-thecourt participant in the case. A towering figure in the struggle to end legally sanctioned racial discrimination, Dr. Clark was instrumental in developing the strategy to dismantle the system of explicit racism and overturn Jim Crow laws across the country. Even with the success of his efforts, he still understood the continuing effects of systemic discrimination. ""This is probably one of the most dangerous things facing manking today: A use and training of intelligence excluding moral sensitivity"", Dr. Clark once said. Throughout his career, he was always committed to integration because of his larger vision for what a diverse democracy ought to be. Where some civil rights leaders later came to question the value of integration, Dr. Clark defended the premise that an integrated American society would be better for everyone. An educational psychologist whose life work encompassed racial integration and improvement in the education of black children, Clark became a part of the ACLU in 1970, serving as a member of the national Board of Directors for one year. He joined the ACLU's National Advisory Council in 1985. He assumed chairmanship of the council in 1991, a post he retained until his death. ""The ACLU has persisted in meeting the most difficult tests of being the moral conscience of our nation"", Clark said in 1980. ""It has protected the fundamental political and human rights of all Americansindeed of all human beings within our jurisdiction"". Clark is survived by his daughter Kate C. Harris, and son Hilton B.

The family of Ivonne de Lepervanche Aybar sadly announce her peaceful death, in her home, in her sleep, in the early morning of Saturday, April 30. Mrs. Aybar, born June 7, 1919, in Santo Domingo of ancestry both Spanish and French, was for many years in the 1940s singles, doubles, and mixed doubles tennis champion of the Dominican Republic. Her father Rene Mezieres de Lepervanche had founded La Opinion, the leading newspaper in Santo Domingo until 1945 when it was finally discontinued. She moved with her husband Francisco Aybar, also a notable and decorated tennis champion, to New York in the mid-40s, where they soon came to reside in Forest Hills. She is survived, with immense love, gratitude and glorious memories, by her only son Francisco Aybar, the pianist; her grandchildren Samuel Rene Aybar of North Salem, NY, and Elizabeth Dina Aybar of Denver, CO. Also surviving her are Sam's family, Susie Aybar and their child, (Mrs. Aybar's greatgrandson Benjamin). Surviving her as well, are her cousin/almost sister Rebeca Galvan of Forest Hills and her niece Lily Estella of Bloomfield Hills, MI. Her astonishing energy, kindness and utterly wacky personality will be profoundly missed by many who loved her deeply: in both of the large families, spread through several countries, on her side and that of her late distinguished husband, as well as by many friends and associates who were proud to know her anywhere.

Kurt Ebenhoch, a Northwest spokesman, explained the advantage to paying for a confirmed seat on an alternate flight rather than standing by, which is free: ""You're at the airport; the flight is within three hours.

The country posted a record surplus of $3.88 billion last month, up from $1.96 billion a year earlier and $3.35 billion in March, the government said. Exports rose to $9.2 billion in April, while imports totaled $5.33 billion. This year Brazil has run up a trade surplus of $12.19 billion, up from $8.09 billion a year ago. Until recently, most economists were predicting that the trade surplus would narrow in 2005. Now many expect a surplus of about $34 billion, up from a record surplus of $33.7 billion in 2004, according to a central bank survey. Todd Benson (NYT)",2005-05-03T05:00:00+0000

The payment, to the parents of Victoria Snelgrove, a student at Emerson College, is apparently the largest wrongful death settlement ever made by the city. Police Commissioner Kathleen O'Toole said the police investigation had found that Ms. Snelgrove ""was not the target of any police action nor was she engaged in any activity that would have led police to think that she was behaving unlawfully."" She also announced that Deputy Police Superintendent Robert E. O'Toole, who was in charge of operations in the area the night of the riot and fired one of the pellet guns, would retire from the police force after 37 years of service.

Management said that the changes would ensure a resumption of touring and recording contracts. At the root of the problem, as it has been at orchestras across North America in recent years, is a financial crunch.

us,The Listings: May 6-12; JACK GOLDSTEIN,"Goldstein (1945-2003) was revered by the new Pop artists and theorists of the 80's. He manipulated mass media imagery with conceptually savvy elegance, and he was included in the famously influential ""Pictures"" exhibition at Artists Space in SoHo in 1977. In retrospect his achievement seems modest, but the wry lucidity of his sensibility and style is still compelling. Varying in length between 20 seconds and 5 minutes, the films from the early 70's on view at Mitchell-Innes & Nash have a deadpan quality that calls to mind William Wegman's early videos. In one, the MGM lion roars over and over. In ""Shane,"" a trained German shepherd barks repeatedly on cue. In the elegiac ""The Chair,"" colored feathers float down one by one onto a chair covered with sticky tar. On canvas, Goldstein airbrushed expansive, simplified pictures of celestial events -- some meteorological or astronomical, some suggesting fireworks or military gunfire (above). Among the best, examples of which are at Metro Pictures as well as Mitchell-Innes & Nash, are views of lightning storms as much as 12 feet wide in which jagged white lines haloed by intense pinks, greens and blues flare out from fields of nocturnal darkness. With their sensuous eggshell surfaces and visionary atmospherics, the pictures are cinematically thrilling. Like the landscapes of Ed Ruscha to whom they appear much indebted, Goldstein's paintings are a form of postmodern transcendentalism. He had a keen eye for the new, hypermediated sublime.

As they bicker and joke in front of 299 people at the Second Stage Theater, it seems as if the audience is peeping through a keyhole into their room. What the performers manage to do is thoroughly persuade you that they are not the actors Conor Donovan, 14, and Harry Zittel, 18, but 12-year-old Charlie (he of the blue blazer) and 16-year-old Porter (note the vintage Clash T-shirt), who are dragged along for a very bumpy ride in 1987, when their wealthy father is accused of insider trading. Reviewers, mixed on the play, were of one voice in their praise for the young actors. Looking relaxed before last Saturday's matinee, the two talked at the theater about how a pair of strangers can appear as if they've known each other all their lives. Mr. Donovan (above left), a student at New Canaan High School in Connecticut, sounded practical: ""We rehearsed for four weeks."" Mr. Zittel, a senior at LaGuardia High School of the Performing Arts in Manhattan, offered a few details: ""Conor's cool, so I don't mind hanging out with him. But there's something very natural about the writing, and both of us got used to it."" In fact, Mr. Weitz does have a brother, Chris, with whom he sometimes works. For the record, Mr. Donovan, who appeared on Broadway in ""Our Town"" with Paul Newman, has a sister; Mr. Zittel, who played Adam Hughes for three years on ""As the World Turns,"" has a sister and a brother. When the reviews came out, did they read them? Both actors grinned mischievously. Mr. Zittel took the bland route: ""I read a couple, so I have some awareness of them."" Mr. Donovan went further: ""We're really not supposed to. If it's going well, you don't want to change it based on what they might say."" (Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, (212)246-4422.)

King took his name, the Beale Street Blues Boy, from its 1940's entertainment district. ""Home of the blues,"" the city now likes to trumpet, ""birthplace of rock 'n' roll."" But these cultural revolutions, and the African-American milieu that spawned them, got no respect until Elvis died in 1977, and the city was inundated by grieving fans spending green money. Soon, Memphis began the urban-renewed version of Beale Street -- its answer to Bourbon Street, sans the nudie shows -- which over the years has become more like frat row. But deep blues do still exist in Memphis. You just have to dig deep to find them. ROBERT GORDON",2005-05-06T05:00:00+0000

The announcement by 13 bishops and 25 archmandrites said the patriarch was persona non grata, and while Eirinaios remains in his post for now, the move further isolates him. The patriarch has said he had no knowledge of two church buildings that were reportedly sold to the investors. But Palestinians and members of his own church have grown increasingly critical of him and have called for his resignation. The church has large land holdings in East Jerusalem, a part of the city claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians. Greg Myre (NYT)",2005-05-06T05:00:00+0000

She will soon choreograph Mira Nair's new film, ""The Namesake."" Ms. Pulvermacher drew on childhood memories for her 1993 ""Five Beds/Children of the Dream,"" a signature dance that will be presented in a retrospective of her work this month at the Flea Theater. Her Jewish heritage also informs ""Goodbye and Goodluck"" (above), a dance about exhumed legends of the Lower East Side that was a collaboration with the composer Anthony Coleman and his SelfHaters, a band of six violinists. But the lyrical, sweeping physicality of Juilliard schooling has also always been present in her work, here in revivals of ""Vivaldiana,"" a voluptuous yet formal duet for women that is called ""Matildas,""and ""Rainbow Girl,"" set in part to music by Schubert. Uncategorizable, perhaps, are the remaining two dances in the two-program repertory. ""River of Orchids,"" set to music by the British rock band XTC, is an exceedingly whimsical bit of frivolity set in a psychedelic swamp of giant vinyl lily pads. And ""A Song"" was inspired by the vanishing language and heritage of the Tliglit people whom Ms. Pulvermacher met in residencies in Alaska. Of equal interest are the performers, who include the engaging Derry Swan, formerly with Merce Cunningham, and three eloquent founding members of the Pulvermacher company, Ani Udovicki, Stephanie Tooman and Kraig Patterson.

In addition to the Beethoven and Ligeti, Mr. Nott will conduct works by a composer who helps link the two: Gustav Mahler.

At the outbreak of WWII he fought as a combat medic and was taken prisoner at the battle of Dunkirk. After escaping from prison camp he returned to the seminary to complete his studies by special indult of the Holy See. He was ordained a priest in 1942 and served as a battle-field chaplain until the end of the war.

In 1952 he accepted the Chair of Moral Theology in Canon Law at Mt. St. Mary's Seminary in Maryland which he held for 13 years. Between 1962 and 1965 Father DePauw participated in the Second Vatican Council as a personal expert and procurator. During this time he publicly launched the Catholic Traditionalist Movement in 1965. The Holy See placed him under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Tivoli Rome so he could continue his leadership of the Catholic Traditionalist Movement. Father De Pauw has contributed to several well-known publications as well as publishing his own. Most notable among them his 'Quote Unquote' and ""Peace through Strength."" In 1968 he established the Ave Maria Chapel in Westbury, New York which became the first and only publicly functioning Traditionalist Catholic parish in the world.

Although the explosion appeared set to occur after the train had completed its trip and released all its passengers, the court said that the defendants, Gorka Loran, 36, and Garikoitz Arruarte, left, 25, had intentionally put the passengers' lives at ""very grave risk."" Their sentences were 15 years in prison for each of the 184 passengers and rail workers the bomb could have killed, but they are more likely to serve 40 years. The plot was cited by the government of the former prime minister, Jos Mara Aznar, as justification for early declarations that ETA was responsible for the March 11, 2004, train bombings that killed 191 people in Madrid.

Born Natalie Powell Scott in Cedarhurst, NY, she graduated from the Oldfields School in Glencoe, MD, in 1949. She moved to New York City in the 1950's and worked for Jonai, a women's apparel retailer, and then for Saks Fifth Avenue as an assistant buyer. Natalie married Francis Martin, Jr., an advertising executive, in 1964 and they lived in Manhattan for 20 years. After Francis retired, they relocated to Reno, NV, and spent the winters in La Quinta, CA. She was an avid golfer, played bridge and backgammon, participated in community affairs and enjoyed traveling throughout the world. From 1979 to '86 and again in '88, Natalie kept official score cards for amateur, celebrity and professional golfers during the Bob Hope Desert Classic (now called the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic), a stop on the PGA tour. Rebounding from health problems in the early 1990's, Natalie won several tournaments and was named the Most Improved Golfer of 1996 by the La Quinta Country Club. She volunteered her time to several nonprofit associations, including the Braille Institute Associates of the Desert, Palm Springs Pathfinders and the Valley Partners with California State University. Known for her magnetic personality, endless energy, charm and quick wit, Natalie's network of friends was no less than amazing. Francis preceded Natalie in December 2003.

us,'Bad Day at Black Rock',"A few months after the end of World War II, the Southern Pacific Streamliner pulls into a dust pile of a California desert town where it hasn't stopped in four years. A one-armed stranger (Spencer Tracy) gets off the train asking about a local Japanese farmer. The film's 81 minutes, during which the locals try to question, intimidate and kill the stranger, are among the tautest, most expertly directed examples of Hollywood suspense. A hybrid of contemporary western and social problem picture, John Sturges's ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" (1955) is one of the most intelligent examinations of violence in American movies. Tracy's character has seen all the killing he wants to in the war. He resists the efforts of the local thugs, Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin, to needle him. They mistake this for weakness. Sturges uses the conventions of the vigilante picture to make us hungry for Tracy to take his revenge. When he inevitably does, Sturges makes us share Tracy's disgust at having to resort to violence. There's no visceral charge to that violence here, only ugliness and waste. Shooting in CinemaScope, Sturges and his photographer, William Mellor, find the moral darkness in the film's clean, spare, bright compositions (beautifully transferred to DVD). The blast of desert sunlight makes the growing menace feel even more sinister. And as Tracy's main nemesis, that great underrated actor Robert Ryan embodies D.H. Lawrence's characterization of the ""essential American soul"": ""hard, isolate, stoic and a killer."" (Warner Brothers, Tuesday) C.T.",2005-05-08T05:00:00+0000

As a bored, spoiled Sicilian baron looking to do away with his fluttery, fawning wife so he can marry his virginal 16-year-old cousin (Stefania Sandrelli), Mastroianni is an insouciant, sleepy lizard: he saunters through the picture as if he were merely on his way to finding the right sunny rock. Mastroianni is so good-looking it almost hurts (and the velvety black-and-white of this beautifully restored version makes him look that much more scrumptious). But his slicked-back matinee-idol hair and ""Don't hate me because I'm beautiful"" mustache are part of the sendup: the careless elegance of the performance is what makes it so funny. And if the idea behind ""Divorce, Italian Style"" seems broad, the execution is anything but. Pietro Germi keeps the movie's dusky black humor perfectly calibrated and takes impish delight in puncturing old-time Italian macho values. When Mastroianni gazes upon Ms. Sandrelli's luscious, youthfully blank face, we know they're a match made in the shallower reaches ofheaven. (Criterion) S.Z.",2005-05-08T05:00:00+0000

Queen is a former undercover A.T.F. agent whose superbly skanky memoir is about how he infiltrated a West Coast motorcycle gang; Lesh, of course, is the former bassist for the Grateful Dead. They're both first-time authors. ""Assassination Vacation,"" on the other hand, is Vowell's fourth book, and her first to make the hardcover list. (Bruce Handy reviews it on Page 14.) Vowell has built a devoted audience through her performances on public radio's ""This American Life,"" where she declaims her pieces in a scratchy voice that has, as Nick Hornby put it, a certain ""drawly, Boopy, Lisa Simpsonesque quality."" Last year Vowell lent that voice to Violet, the teenage superhero in ""The Incredibles."" It was a job she was prepared to turn down, she told Hornby, until she learned it was a Pixar movie.

us,Up Front,"Last month an era in American literary history came to an end when two important figures died just one day apart. The death, on April 5, of Saul Bellow, a giant of the modern novel, received a great deal of coverage; this newspaper printed, in addition to a long front-page obituary, appreciations by Michiko Kakutani, Ian McEwan, Edward Rothstein, A. O. Scott, Brent Staples and David Brooks. The second death, of Frank Conroy, on April 6, was recorded more quietly. But Conroy, too, was a major presence in American literature -- less through his own writing, though his memoir ""Stop-Time"" is a classic of the genre, than through the contribution he made as the longtime director of the Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa. When a former teacher there, the novelist James Salter, asked the Book Review if he might write an appreciation of Conroy, we encouraged him to go ahead. Salter's essay, ""The Writing Teacher,"" which appears on Page 31, evokes the spirit of Conroy (""tall, unflappable and urbane"") and also of the program he ran, rigorously and lovingly, for 18 years. It helped keep Iowa City, a small Midwestern river town, at the center of the literary universe -- a place where Nobel laureates came to read, and writers like John Cheever, Philip Roth, Kurt Vonnegut and Joy Williams evaluated student work and continued the conversation at local bars. How did Conroy prevent this most venerable of writing programs from becoming a processing plant? To begin with, he kept a close watch on who got in. He ""read every submission and made final decisions himself,"" Salter notes. ""It was the way great cities of Europe were built, not by committee but by royal decree.""

us,'Jules and Jim',"How many films feel this fresh and free more than 40 years after their release? Franois Truffaut's story of love and indissoluble friendship between two men (Oskar Werner's Jules and Henri Serre's Jim) and a woman (Jeanne Moreau) -- based on Henri-Pierre Roch's novel -- is infused with such delicacy of feeling that you can watch it five times, or 20, and still not feel you've fully plumbed it. (This two-disc package comes with a passel of extras, including two audio commentaries, one of them by Jeanne Moreau and Truffaut's biographer Serge Toubiana.) As Catherine, the woman beloved by both men, Ms. Moreau is the movie's thrumming heart: in the most famous and most vivid sequence, the three friends run a footrace across a railroad bridge. She has disguised herself as a boy, with a penciled-on mustache -- in her plaid cap and baggy pants, she is the men's almost-equal. But in the way she's so petulantly and defiantly alive, she's their superior. She wins the race (she cheated, but who cares?), and she has already made us, the audience, her willing captives. Just before that race Mr. Serre, entranced not just by Ms. Moreau but by the fine-grained texture of the day around him, says, ""Either it's raining or I'm dreaming."" She answers, ""It might be both."" ""Jules and Jim"" is about remaking reality via the imagination, about finding the spot where raining and dreaming are one and the same.

Just a few hours earlier, he and some friends were enjoying a raucous, boisterous evening, all but driving out the other diners at a decorous French restaurant. Now, after several drinks at the bar, the lateness of the hour and the increasing proximity of Hatch's plans for the next day seemed to be catching up with him, and his mood took a turn toward the tense.

us,'Love Me or Leave Me',"This backstage biography of the singer Ruth Etting must be the most unusual MGM musical of the 50's. On the surface, ""Love Me or Leave Me"" is a big, satisfying CinemaScope melodrama, with Doris Day starring, about Etting's rise from dime-a-dance girl to headliner. James Cagney is the small-time Chicago hood she uses, marries and then leaves for the man she really loves. But as directed, sharply, by Charles Vidor, the film is awash in the disturbing undercurrents that made Hollywood movies of the 50's both rich and unstable, made them, in Manny Farber's phrase, ""termite art."" In ""Love Me or Leave Me"" it is Ruth Etting we're supposed to root for. We can see how the strong-arm tactics that Cagney's Martin Snyder uses to advance her career hurt her when she moves beyond the speakeasies. Yet the movie shows us the calculation in Etting's obedience to Snyder, her willingness to use his muscle and the way, when he calls the bill due, she settles accounts by marrying him. This is Day, remember, the archetypal sweetheart. As in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much,"" another film about a marriage held together by neuroses and need, Day proves a terrific dramatic actress. And Cagney is amazing, making us feel the naked need, the insecurity behind Snyder's bullying. We're both appalled by Snyder and hurt for him. In his review, Franois Truffaut said the sting of the film was sharpened by the surrounding genre perfection of the movie musical. This DVD transfer is lush. The picture still stings.

us,'Jaws',"For everything that has been said and written about how Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" began the reign of the Hollywood blockbuster and spelled the end of the golden age of American filmmaking in the early 70's, ""Jaws"" belongs more to the adult era that preceded it than to the infantile one that followed. Pauline Kael called the movie a grand joke on masculinity, with Robert Shaw's macho shark hunter Quint set up as the target for Roy Scheider's pragmatic sheriff and Richard Dreyfuss's brainy ichthyologist to score off. ""Jaws"" is the American comedy that grew out of the divisions of the Vietnam years, years in which men who didn't affirm what was considered the traditional masculine role had their manhood questioned. When Robert Shaw starts chewing the scenery, bragging of some fishy exploit, it's easy to hear the braggadocio of some vets who used their own combat experiences to question the bravery of those who opposed the war. Which is why when Quint gets the danger he seeks and is swallowed whole by the shark, it's the funniest consummation in movie history. This 30th-anniversary DVD set includes all the extras you'd expect -- making-of documentary, outtakes, deleted scenes, etc. But the true attraction, as it always has been, is Mr. Spielberg's ingenious, malevolent filmmaking. Without any of the Cuisinart editing, whipping camera movements or computer-generated effects that have rendered today's commercial blockbusters visually incoherent, using only camera placement, perspective and editing, Mr. Spielberg succeeds in completely shredding any sense of safety in the viewer. His craft dovetails beautifully with that of his heroes, who defeat the shark through brains and not brawn. ""Jaws"" is Mr. Spielberg's ""Revenge of the Nerds.""

The patches can be obtained by calling 311 or by going to one of the Health and Hospitals Corporation's stop-smoking clinics. Pfizer donated the patches, valued at $8 million.

The market for attached storage is expected to grow 15 percent a year, to $3.1 billion in 2008, the researcher IDC has estimated. Sun is seeking to increase storage sales amid tougher competition from Dell. Sun is the world's fifth-biggest maker of storage computers and last year its share of that market fell to 6.2 percent, from 6.8 percent, IDC said on March 4. Shares of Sun Microsystems, based in Santa Clara, Calif., fell 1 cent, to $3.85. Shares of Procom, based in Irvine, Calif., rose 65 cents, or 42 percent, to $2.20.",2005-05-10T05:00:00+0000

Elijah Bobby Williams and his son, both Bronx-based drug dealers, were convicted of the Feb. 18, 1996, shootings in Wilkinsburg, Pa., of Timothy Moore, a cousin, Joel Moore, and Robert James. After deliberating for less than two hours, the jury concluded there was persuasive evidence that Michael Williams -- but not his father -- had planned the killings.

The two, Cardinal Roberto Tucci, the former chief of the management committee of Vatican Radio, the broadcasting station of the Holy See, and the Rev. Pasquale Borgomeo, the general director, were given 10-day suspended sentences. They said they would appeal. The convictions came after a trial in 2002 was halted when a judge ruled that the Vatican was a separate nation and that Italian law did not apply. That ruling was later overturned.

The program allowed illegal immigrants already living in Spain to apply for residency papers if they did not have a criminal record and if their employers agreed to provide them with a written contract to work for at least six months. The government said the program was necessary to satisfy the economy's demand for workers and to increase government revenues by adding the migrants to the tax rolls. Illegal immigrants have been pouring into Spain over the last five years, drawn mostly by jobs produced by the country's growing economy. Since 2001, their numbers have more then tripled.

""Desperate Housewives"" had nearly double that, with an audience of 26.2 million. And ""Grey's Anatomy"" (19.34 million) had its best ratings yet. The combination of the two shows resulted in an easy win for ABC in total viewers and among adults 18 to 49 for the night. CBS was second in total viewers, but it trailed Fox among adults 18 to 49. Fox continued to perform well with its animation block, which included new episodes of ""Family Guy"" (9.71 million) and ""American Dad"" (8.23 million). On Saturday, it was No. 1 with its primetime Nascar coverage, while Friday night belonged to the CBS lineup. On Friday, the series finale of NBC's six-year-old ""Third Watch"" placed second behind a ""CSI"" repeat. KATE AURTHUR",2005-05-10T05:00:00+0000

Tallahassee proves the point -- nearly 500 miles from Miami, but only about 20 miles from the Georgia border, it is a city of verandahs and live oaks dripping with Spanish moss. Lately, it has become a backdrop for newscasters reporting on contentious cases (Bush v. Gore and the Terri Schiavo case) but most of the time, the focus is on learning: Florida State University, and Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University bring more than 40,000 students a year to this city of 153,000. Tallahassee is not as thrillingly unspoiled as Charleston, S.C.; it is more like Savannah, Ga. -- where despite some ill-conceived redevelopment, a lot of Southern charm still oozes through. FRED A.

Some techniques create illusions. The gleaming, swelling surfaces of five Yatura ceremonial wedding gourds from Tanzania might be glazed ceramic or worked leather; they have been stained dark red and decorated with staccato incisions and geometric and zoomorphic motifs in black. A tall Gurunsi gourd from Burkina Faso, golden in color and incised with a grid of x's, suggests ivory. Two small Kwere medicine gourds with carved finial heads have matte black surfaces suggestive of basalt. Meanwhile, a rose-tinted tsonga diviner's gourd (above) gets its power not only from its fierce finial head, but also from the gourd's protruding pustule-like bumps. Also made from gourds are the large lightweight bowls, or calabashes made by the nomadic Fulani of the Sahara region and two ceremonial vessels with woven-grass coverings that suggest colossal wine jugs. Closer to its natural state is a bark Fang container that almost might be freshly cut from the trunk of a slender young tree. An unexpected bonus is a scintillating display of snuff containers that reiterates the show's variety and quality in miniature. An invaluable lesson: the prevailing sense of economy and respect for nature, two things in disastrously short supply these days.

He finishes his illustrious run with a production of the Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick musical ""The Apple Tree,"" which was originally directed by Mike Nichols in the 1966 Broadway production. (The respected conductor Paul Gemiginani will take over next season.) The concert stars Kristin Chenoweth, Malcolm Gets and Michael Cerveris and runs through Monday. After 32 productions, Mr. Fisher, 52 (above), who still sounds like a chipper professor eager for his students to love the material he's teaching as much as he does, says he wants to pursue a more diverse variety of projects (although he wouldn't get more specific than that). ""There's still plenty of old shows that people don't know about that I think they will love, and I will continue to find ways to bring them to the public,"" he says. ""That is my lot in life."" Not only has Mr. Fisher rescued shows that have fallen off the radar, but he has reconstructed many of them from fragmentary snatches of sheet music and recordings. Such scholarly persistence has earned him good will from the theater community and enviable attention from the press; Encores! has one of the best rave-to-pan ratios of any company in town. So, if things are going so well, why leave now? ""I'm used to shows closing and then moving on,"" Mr. Fisher says. ""Twelve years is a long time.""

us,The Listings: May 13-May 19; NINE INCH NAILS,"Trent Reznor, the only voting member of the long-running synth-punk act Nine Inch Nails, turns 40 on Tuesday. In the days before his birthday, he is to play a couple of concerts at Hammerstein Ballroom, and if you're expecting him to seem a bit old, a bit rusty, or a bit tired, then you haven't been following his career very closely. Mr. Reznor, above, long ago perfected his own ridiculous (but never tongue-in-cheek) act, and during a recent performance at the Coachella festival, he proved that he hasn't lost a step: he can still grab a microphone and snarl about what he wants to do to you (here's a hint: he wants to do it ""like an animal"") without cracking a smile. The new Nine Inch Nails album is ""With Teeth"" (Interscope), and it's a reminder of just how influential Mr. Reznor has been. His serrated tantrums and menacing ballads inspired some of the 1990's best-selling acts, from Marilyn Manson to Korn, and if Nine Inch Nails has outlasted nearly all of them, that's in large part because Mr. Reznor's rather risible lyrical preoccupations (insects, rotting stuff, things eating other things) don't prevent him from writing big, sturdy songs with big sturdy hooks. For these two concerts, Mr. Reznor will be joined by a well-chosen opening act: the Dresden Dolls, a theatrical piano-and-drums duo (they call their act ""Brechtian punk cabaret"") with a catalog full of clever, angular songs; show up early, if only to see if Mr. Reznor's fans are as broad-minded as he is. ( Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-7740, sold out; returns may be available.) KELEFA SANNEH",2005-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: May 13-May 19; 'CYRANO DE BERGERAC',"You've seen the movie, or the play, or the musical. The tale of the large-nosed hero -- who actually lived in the 17th century -- has been the stuff of adaptation at least since Edmond Rostand wrote his famous play in 1897. Jos Ferrer won a Tony and an Academy Award as Cyrano in 1947 and 1950; Christopher Plummer took a Tony for a Broadway musical version in 1974; and Grard Depardieu's film version won him a best actor at Cannes in 1990. Now, the opera tenors are taking Cyrano on. Franco Alfano, a verismo composer best known for completing Puccini's ""Turandot,"" wrote a ""Cyrano"" opera in 1936; tonight, the Metropolitan Opera is staging it for the first time as a vehicle for Plcido Domingo (above right, with Raymond Very and Sondra Radvanovsky). Meanwhile, this week saw the release of a new DVD of the same opera starring Roberto Alagna (DGG). It may not be great opera -- Alfano tempered his flamboyant verismo tendencies with a soupon of French modernism and a big dash of conservatism -- but it's fun theater, with a big meaty tenor part, and Mr. Domingo's presence has ensured that the run of three performances is already officially sold out. (Tonight and Tuesday, 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; returns may be available at the box office.) ANNE MIDGETTE",2005-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,World Briefing | Asia: Japan: Holiday For Hirohito,"Japanese lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to honor Emperor Hirohito by renaming a national holiday to be celebrated in his honor starting in 2007. Showa Day, as it will be called, will be held on Hirohito's birthday, April 29, which is now a holiday called Green Day. Hirohito, whose rule lasted from 1926 until his death in 1989, is regarded by most Asians and some Japanese as a symbol of Japanese militarism and aggression in Asia, and he is still a revered figure for Japanese nationalists. But most Japanese now associate him with the postwar years of the Showa era, during which Japan rebuilt itself and became the world's No.2 economy. Two previous attempts to rename the holiday, in 2000 and 2002, were shelved in consideration of Asian sensitivities, but growing nationalism allowed the law's enactment this time. The holiday had been known as Emperor's Day before Hirohito's death, but was changed to Green Day to avoid an Asian reaction and to honor the emperor's interest in nature.

us,The Remix; Don't Cry For Me/Oil of Ole,"Malbec isn't the only tasty thing being bottled in Argentina. The country's olive oil has recently come into its own, with boutique versions widely available. Now no restaurant table in Buenos Aires is complete without a bottle of a bright and fruity local aceite de oliva. Olive trees first arrived in Argentina nearly 500 years ago, but the oil was exported until the Spanish Civil War disrupted trade in the 1930's. Afterward, Argentine oil was thought to be iffy stuff. But since the 1990's, quality has skyrocketed, following the same trajectory as the local wines. Many of the oils are organic or biodynamic, with the best coming from small producers in the winemaking regions of Mendoza, San Juan and Catamarca. Connoisseurs differentiate oils by region and by variety. There's fiery farga, peppery frantoio and good, all-purpose arauco. These delicious olive oils can be purchased outside the wine regions, too. In Buenos Aires, most wine shops carry a small selection. Or pick some up at Valenti (www.valenti.com.ar), which is the city's equivalent of Dean & Deluca. OLIVER SCHWANER-ALBRIGHT",2005-05-15T05:00:00+0000

Built in the 1920's and redesigned by the renowned Cuban architect Max Borges Recio in 1953, it is one of the most perfect futuristic constructions in Latin America (despite an uncanny resemblance to Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport). The exquisite portico and vaulted ceiling have survived without a crack. But unfortunately, most Americans will never get to sip mojitos poolside. Those lucky enough to wrangle a visa will run into Castro's recent ban on dollars. (He has imposed a maddening 10 percent surtax on the now-mandatory exchange for ""peso convertibles."")

That was the question Nick Hornby posed in his 1995 novel, ""High Fidelity,"" and a similar argument is raised in ""Alternative Atlanta,"" Boswell's likable but fairly weightless first novel. His narrator, 30-year-old Gerald Brinkman, is a music critic for an alternative weekly newspaper in Atlanta who'd rather stay home cranking his free review copies of CD's than deal with the mess his life has become. ""Alternative Atlanta"" opens with Gerald attending the wedding of his ex-girlfriend, Nora, a k a the One Who Got Away. Gerald broke up with her several years earlier, even though she was perfect for him. That's what happens when your life lessons come to you through your stereo receiver: ""Rock has taught him all he cares to know about integrity, aesthetic form and love. Don't sell out, don't overstay your welcome, don't grow up: those are the three lessons of rock."" Gerald's preprogrammed playlist gets scrambled when his father, a minister turned disillusioned eccentric by the death of Gerald's mother when Gerald was 7, arrives at his doorstep. Then Nora proceeds to drop a bomb of her own, entangling Gerald in her messy marriage. Boswell uses the 1996 Summer Olympic Games as a backdrop, so some actual explosives figure in the plot as well, catapulting Gerald into adult responsibility faster than he can say, ""Hope I die before I get old.""",2005-05-15T05:00:00+0000

The first, called ""Climaxed,"" is a floating fireball hanging in midair that continually explodes. The second originated last fall, when Mr. Oursler was asked by the MUSE D'ORSAY to choose something in its collection and create a work of art in response to it. The result is ""STUDIO: SEVEN MONTHS OF MY AESTHETIC EDUCATION (PLUS SOME,)"" inspired by COURBET'S 1855 painting ""THE ARTIST'S STUDIO: A REAL ALLEGORY OF A SEVEN YEAR PHASE IN MY ARTISTIC AND MORAL LIFE."" ""The tradition of studio paintings has always interested me,"" Mr. Oursler said. So he decided to create an artist's studio for the 21st century, with modern-day trappings like electronics, e-mail and surveillance. Just as Courbet's painting incorporated a host of people, Mr. Oursler's work does as well: A surveillance camera captures museum visitors and puts them in the installation. There are also inspirational objects like a model by the Rotterdam architect REM KOOLHAAS, and works by Mr. Oursler's wife, JACQUELINE HUMPHRIES, who is also an artist. ""Courbet always said his painting was unfinished so he gave me the license to make this organic,"" Mr. Oursler said. ""It keeps growing.""

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   RYAN, DONALD HILLSDON, ''MISTER MINIT''","RYAN -- Donald Hillsdon, ""Mister Minit"". September 23, 1925--May 9, 2005. The co-founder and former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Minit International died at his home in London, England on Monday, May 9. He and his partner virtually invented the rapid-service industry and the idea for the company while at Harvard Business School. They were anxious to do something very challenging commercially and would sit and talk about the ""sleepers"", the small craft industries, which were established businesses providing something everyone needed but without any real organization or capital behind them, and which no one seemed to be trying to industrialize or commercialize. After working five years for Procter and Gamble in the US and Europe, Mr. Ryan co-founded the Minit Corporation in 1957 with the opening of a small ""while-you-wait"" heel repair bar in Brussels' Bon Marche department store. He bought out his partner and built a global network of shops and services in 30 countries. The business provided quick service for everything from the original heel and shoe repair, to key duplication, photo development, watch repair, knife and skate sharpening, engraving, name tapes, rubber stamps, and retailing of travel goods, personalized gifts, cutlery, wigs and jewelry. The company also manufactured key blanks, shoe materials, machinery, fixtures and signs for its shops worldwide. Born in Petersburg, Virginia, Mr. Ryan started his first business at age 12, raising birds and rabbits for sale to small markets and delivering newspapers. He attended the Virginia Military Institute before serving in the Infantry in WWII and in Berlin during the occupation, where he was responsible for the allocation of German transportation assets throughout the US zone. He graduated from The College of William and Mary (AB) where he later funded the Ryan Professorship of Business Policy, and received his MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1952. He received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the American College Of Switzerland and from the College of William and Mary. He was given the prestigious honour of Commander of the Order of Leopold II by the King of Belgium. Mr. Ryan was chairman of the Swiss Romande Harvard Alumni Association for many years, was international senior vicepresident of the Young President's Organization and international chairman of the Chief Executive's Organization.

us,Inside the List,"REBEL ZELL: There was a time when Zell Miller, the former Democratic senator from Georgia, was a uniting kind of guy, not a dividing one. On the cover of his 1997 book, ""Corps Values: Everything You Need to Know I Learned in the Marines,"" there were blurbs by (from the right) Newt Gingrich and Mary Matalin and (from the left) Max Cleland and James Carville. Consensus, however, doesn't sell books. It's only since Miller forcefully spurned his party that he's begun to move units. His 2003 book, ""A National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat,"" made the Times hardcover nonfiction list for nine weeks, rising as high as No. 4. And Miller's new volume, ""A Deficit of Decency,"" which arrives in the wake of his vein-popping keynote address at the 2004 Republican National Convention, enters the hardcover list this week at No. 9. ""A Deficit of Decency"" is a tough book to get a handle on. On the one hand, there's an introduction by Sean Hannity of Fox News, and Miller zeroes in on predictable conservative targets -- the ""useless nuisance"" of the United Nations, the liberal media and hip-hop. (Miller blows a gasket over the Nelly video in which the rapper ""swipes a credit card through a young woman's backside."") On the other hand, he has nice things to say about Hillary Rodham Clinton and her chances in 2008. (Miller calls her a ""warrior."") Miller's literate and often likable book also includes encomiums to Waylon Jennings, the Carter Family, Ray Charles, George Jones and Loretta Lynn -- proving he's still a uniter on one issue: he's got beautiful taste in music.",2005-05-15T05:00:00+0000

It all started with Paris-Plage, an artificial strand along the Seine complete with 3,000 tons of sand, palm trees and umbrellas, which attracted three million visitors the week it opened in 2002. Urban beaches now grace Toulouse, Milan, Hamburg and Brussels, which offers North Sea sand, international food booths, Brazilian dancers and volleyball nets. London isn't yet hip to this trend (though Bob Geldof wants to build one in Potters Fields Park in East London), but some cities boast multiples. In Budapest, there are five sandy locales along the Danube. This year, Berlin will have about 10 (a 2003 photo, above, shows beachcombers at the Oststrand, in front of the old Berlin Wall). The only thing missing from these beaches is a place to swim. For a few lazy laps of freestyle, Berliners turn to the Badeschiff (""bathing ship""), a boat container turned public pool. It floats in the river, a perfect urban bathing metaphor. Sandals and socks optional. GISELA WILLIAMS",2005-05-15T05:00:00+0000

Inside is a red-sauce paradise, the still-beating heart of a lost ethnic pocket in the city, where the waiters are grandfathers and the regulars have a combined age that extends back to the Old World. Marzilli (shown below) opened the Old Canteen in 1956, and today's customers aren't much different from yesterday's. They are and were locals -- press workers and stonecutters from downtown -- and laborers from Boston and New York looking for more dignified work in Rhode Island.This is also where the town's outsize characters have always gone to gossip. Before he wound up in prison in 2002, Mayor Buddy Cianci held court here over veal scaloppini three times a week. The food, which is redolent of garlic, tomatoes and basil, is comfortably familiar. But it's the tradition and conversation that fill the place, not the food. ""Look around you,"" says one regular. ""You think I'm here for the pink doilies? This is my real home.

us,The Remix; Iceland Cometh,"Most visitors to Iceland go there to explore its otherworldly landscape -- glaciers, geysers, volcanoes, lava deserts -- formed by the violent forces of nature. This summer that landscape will be informed by the hand of man. The annual Reykjavik Arts Festival is paying homage to the work of the German-born Swiss artist Dieter Roth (1930-98), who lived in Iceland. Roth was concerned with matters of time and decay and often worked with organic materials: chocolate, sausage, cheese and rabbit droppings. His paintings, graphic works, installations and art books can be seen in the exhibition ""Train,"" curated by his son Bjorn and housed in the Reykjavik Art Museum, the National Gallery of Iceland and other locations. In conjunction, another show, ""Material Time/Work Time/Life Time,"" in venues throughout the country, reflects Roth's interest in the relationship between working and living (a piece by Roth, above, shows him with the artist Arnulf Rainer, at right). The curator Jessica Morgan, of the Tate Modern in London, commissioned artists from the United States, Europe and Latin America -- including Matthew Barney and Bojan Sarcevic -- to muse on this subject. Exhibits will be on view from mid-May through mid-August. Iceland's summer climate is conducive to viewing outdoor installations (or geysers), and the sun never really sets.

us,Puppet Dictatorship,"A bottle opener, a flashlight, maybe even the Bible: these are the practical things to have in your carry-on. A phrase book, stomach medication, perhaps a roll of toilet paper: these are what you think you might need in an emergency. Travel changes your sense of what is practical and causes you to value things in a different way. Seventeen years ago, when my closest companion in Japan gave me a white-tiger hand puppet, it seemed indicative of the whimsy, the love of the cute, for which Japan is famous. It was not the obvious gift for a 31-year-old journalist. But the small animal, with its round head and no legs, became my one invaluable possession. It caused Tibetan chambermaids to squeal with delight. It moved many a customs agent to assume that the only reason a grown man would travel with a child's toy is to hide drugs. Not long after getting my present (given so I could take it places I could not take my companion), a fire swept through my home in Santa Barbara, Calif., and I lost everything. But my friend found me another tiger, and I imagined that my talisman, like the Dalai Lama, was subject to many incarnations. It has gone with me to North Korea, Easter Island, Ethiopia and Osama bin Laden's ancestral neighborhood in Yemen. It does not support me in obvious ways but speaks to something undefended and sweetly hopeful about travel.

This year, the trend is stronger than ever; Paramount Network Television, for example, is producing shows only for CBS and UPN, which like Paramount are owned by Viacom. Is a show's corporate bloodline the best predictor of whether it makes it onto a network's schedule? Looking at the 10-year trend, Steve Sternberg, an analyst at Magna Global USA, said yes. And synergistic favors don't end there. ""An in-house program has a better chance of getting a good time period, and of being given more time if it's not working right away,"" he said.

Mr. Holub spent his entire career in New York City, where he was a founding member of the United Federation of Teachers and by 1967 an assistant principal in the city's public school system. His exuberant teaching and demanding leadership elicited passionate loyalty from generations of teachers and students. Mr. Holub was born on August 23, 1936, in Brooklyn, where he attended Public School 222, Brooklyn Technical High School, and St. John's University School of Education. He studied at New York University, City College of New York, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, did doctoral work at Yeshiva University, and was a Swedish National Fellow at Stockholm University. Mr. Holub worked in both elementary and junior high schools, nearly all in Brooklyn. Extended periods of service included Cunningham and Bildersee junior high schools and P.S. 219 Kennedy-King School, where he finished his career. He helped design New York's Holocaust Studies curriculum, which was a national model and for which he was honored as a ""righteous Christian"" by Jewish organizations. He also taught at Yeshiva College. In San Francisco Mr. Holub volunteered in the public schools, the Fort Mason International Hostel, and the Little Sisters of the Poor's St. Anne's Home for the Aged. He attended and supported the Fromm Institute of the University of San Francisco, was a regular at the city's symphony and ballet, and was a patron of 42nd Street Moon and the New Conservatory Theatre. The city's Board of Supervisors eulogized Mr. Holub's contribution to police-community relations in his Pacific Heights neighborhood.

Mr. Chappelle, below, who fled to South Africa in late April, told Time's Johannesburg bureau chief, Simon Robinson, that he is not holed up in a mental institution but is staying with a family friend and fellow Muslim, Salim Domar. Last week Comedy Central said it was suspending production of Mr. Chappelle's hit sketch show, which was to return for its third season May 31, because of the comedian's unexpected absence. Mr. Chappelle tells Time that he went to South Africa searching for a ""quiet place"" where, ""I can enjoy my own thoughts sometimes -- and I've been doing a lot of thinking here."" In another interview, with a Time senior editor, Christopher John Farley, Mr. Chappelle seemed to doubt the people in his inner circle: ""You have to have people around you that you can trust and aren't just out for a meal ticket."" He also questioned some of his signature race-baiting material: ""Everyone around me says, You're a genius! You're great! That's your voice! But I'm not sure if they're right.""

Since late February, when the circuslike proceedings began, the Nielsen estimates for its all-Michael-all-the-time daytime programming are up 100 percent in households compared with the same period last year. Through last Monday, an average weekday during the trial has brought in an audience of 416,000, which is 146 percent more viewers than the channel drew in those months last year. The numbers for the daily programs of Court TV's stars -- Catherine Crier and Nancy Grace, the table-pounding former prosecutor -- have increased even more strikingly, and in the first two weeks of May, the channel outpaced CNN in viewers. Trying to capitalize on these bumps -- and to overcome advertisers' squeamishness about buying time during anything lurid -- Court TV announced in March that it would separate its daytime programming from its entertainment-focused prime-time shows, renaming its weekdays Court TV News.

Godzilla,"" about the lot of the writer in Hollywood, Mr. Mamet -- who has written many screenplays, including ""The Verdict,"" ""The Untouchables"" and ""Wag the Dog"" -- dips his pen into a reservoir of experience for a jeremiad against Hollywood's tendency to treat writers as one more below-the-line expense, and not a very important one that that. ""In my experience, almost every financial interchange with Hollywood ends with an accusation by the corporation of theft,"" he writes. ""'You didn't do what I wanted; you didn't work hard enough; you intended to defraud me.' These are the recurring plaints of industry. They may be translated as: you forgot to work for nothing."" In a telephone interview, Mr. Mamet said he was not coming off any specific trauma with Hollywood but just felt like sharing his thoughts in the form of an essay. ""Writing for Hollywood is a constant trauma,"" he said. ""This is not an attempt to settle scores or to point fingers. I just wanted to write about how Hollywood takes this simple process of exposing photo-sensitive material to light to capture an image and complicates it into this marvelously byzantine and intricate mechanical, financial and aesthetic hierarchy."" Mr. Mamet said the Hollywood machine would rid itself of the necessity of dealing with and paying for writers if it could.

""Then Delta came through with a larger increase, then American decided to match Delta's increase, and then everybody else fell in line"" among the network carriers, said Terry Trippler of Farefacts.com. As of yesterday, the fare increases -- typically $10 to $20 round trip -- were sticking, Mr. Trippler said. It was not clear whether low-cost carriers like Southwest would respond.

After initially defending the Guard report, CBS said it could no longer vouch for the authenticity of the documents on which it was based. Yesterday, Mr. Rather thanked the CBS producers and executives associated with the prison program, citing their ""hard work"" and ""guts.""

Any further changes would have to be approved by the Landmarks Commission. Modern preservationists who vociferously protested the building's alterations had called for a hearing on the Summit and another Lapidus building, the 1949 Paterson Silks store at Union Square.

In the order, filed yesterday in Illinois, the two men say that Mr. Yalincak placed their money in a bank account he controlled, not in a hedge fund he supposedly ran. The order seeks to freeze about $500,000 that Mr. Yalincak now holds in the bank. Mr. Yalincak, 21, was accused in a federal indictment earlier this month of trying to pass $43 million in bad checks through bank accounts he controls in Greenwich, Conn., and in Switzerland. He remains in custody and has pleaded not guilty. Mr. Yalincak's civil lawyer, Robert Chan, said that Mr. Yalincak would not contest Mr. Meyer's and Mr. Doede's claims and would pay them back as soon as he had access to his accounts.

The regulator accused UBS of sparking a 16 percent drop in the stock market a year ago, which came amid fears that the newly elected government led by the Congress Party would slow the process of opening India's economy. The securities board said that UBS Securities sold derivatives worth 1.88 billion rupees ($43 million) on May 17, 2004. The board also said UBS Securities sold a huge amount of equities for which its parent, UBS, had issued offshore derivatives backed by Indian shares. The ban bars UBS, which is based in Zurich, and its units from issuing offshore derivative instruments with underlying Indian securities against the positions held by UBS in Indian securities.

Mr. Cronick, 27, came up with the idea after working for an entertainment news announcer who loved to wear vintage T-shirts, but only once. He developed a way to fuse the shirts to fabric for pillow covers. Further experiments led to a material stiffened with felt, used for more structured items like bags. Cronick Valentine, 324 East Ninth Street (First Avenue), was designed by Gold Wood & Daisies. Borrowing from the architect Shigeru Ban, the store uses cardboard tubes to frame artists' work, on left.

The envelope was taken to the Health Department for analysis, a police spokesman said.

I don't think or perhaps don't yet know if Hou Hsiao-hsien's ""Three Times"" is a masterpiece, but it's quite wonderful. I've been thinking about the M word a lot recently because critics really tend to lose all sense of perspective at Cannes, especially as the festival wears on. Some critics have complained that there are no masterpieces at the festival (others, meanwhile have found a rather startling number of masterpieces), when there are, in fact, a handful of exceptional films in the program. As one magazine editor said to me today, there are enough films here to carry the cover of his publication several times in the coming year. At the top of my list are the Hou, his best film since ""Flowers of Shanghai,"" along with the Cronenberg, the Dardennes and the Haneke. I like a handful of other titles, as well, and even films I feel mixed about are of a high quality. Nonetheless, a friend who usually admires Mr. Hou doesn't believe that ""Three Times"" rates a ""good,"" which slightly blows my mind. My take on my friend's parsimoniousness is that he's disappointed that Mr. Hou has not made yet another masterpiece. I guess the director's flawless mise-en-scene and ravishing-looking palette, along with his ability to pull wrenching emotions out of seemingly simple situations are just not enough.

Wolf.

With Ambassador Wolf at the helm, JDC was able to capitilize on a host of new opportunities to serve critical Jewish needs in a post Cold War world. Joined by his beloved life partner, the late Roslyn Zehman Wolf, Ambassador Wolf traveled the world on behalf of JDC and the Jewish people, leading our first mission to Cuba, inagurating the first Jewish community welfare center established in the former Soviet Union-the prototype for a Hesed network that now numbers over 170, and presiding over rescue operations from Sarajevo, Syria, and Yemen. Above all, Ambassordor Wolf was determined to help the Jews of the former Soviet Union reclaim their heritage and ""return to the worldwide Jewish people."" ""Future generations will never forgive us"" he said, ""if we neglect to meet this challenge."" A past President of the Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland, an officer and trustee of several distinguished universities and a civic leader, Ambassordor Wolf has been honored for his service to his country, his community, and the Jewish people.

us,Cleveland,"THE Cleveland of ""American Splendor,"" the 2003 Oscar-nominated movie, is a dreary 1980's town of thrift stores and shambling eccentrics, a place where you'd barely care to spend two hours, let alone a weekend. Today, Cleveland hardly feels like the same place. In the 1990's, public-private enterprise replaced center-city blight with new sports stadiums and the lakefront Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Meanwhile, downtown's revival spurred gentrification into forgotten enclaves along the Cuyahoga River. There's a thriving art scene in Tremont, and the retooled Warehouse District has become a place to be, rather than flee, after dark. Clevelanders remain, by nature, a self-deprecating lot. But before long, calling their town hip, cosmopolitan -- even splendid -- won't sound so ironic. MICHAEL GOLLUST",2005-05-20T05:00:00+0000

Also there is a brief Cubist film of a live female nude descending a staircase. (Most works are dated between the late 60's and the early 90's.) Meanwhile, Rubenstein's 24th Street pocket gallery presents a recent seven-channel video, in part of which Sturtevant impersonates Paul McCarthy's demented Abstract Expressionist clown. If you like to philosophize about art and creativity, Sturtevant is for you. (Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-8000, through June 18; free.)

Mr. Amalric, who won a 2005 Csar award for Best Actor for the role, has been called ""the Jean-Pierre Laud of the 90's,"" and just as that actor became Franois Truffaut's nervous muse in a series of films spanning decades, Mr. Amalric seems destined to continue into the 21st century as Mr. Desplechin's filmic alter ego. In their last collaboration, ""My Sex Life, or How I Got Into an Argument"" (1996), Mr. Amalric played a doctoral candidate in philosophy who has a nervous breakdown while writing his thesis; somehow, he managed to make writer's block both suspenseful and slyly funny. Mr. Amalric, like Mr. Laud (with whom he has appeared twice, in ""Diary of a Seducer"" and ""L'Affaire Marcorelle""), specializes in playing a distinctly French kind of hero: an intellectual paralyzed by his own introspection, simultaneously antic and morose. Mr. Amalric, 39, may have a genetic predisposition toward such roles; his father is an editor of the French left-wing newspaper Liberation, while his mother is a literary critic for Le Monde. In addition to writing and directing three films of his own, he's also taught at La Femis, the Parisian film school associated with the so-called New New Wave of French filmmaking (exemplified by such directors as Mr. Desplechin and Oliver Assayas, who cast Mr. Amalric as the irresolute hero of ""Late August, Early September"" in 1998.) Mr. Amalric can currently be seen at Cannes in ""Le Moustache,"" the first feature film directed by the novelist Emmanuel Carrre, in which he again plays opposite Emmanuelle Devos, the formidable female lead of both ""My Sex Life"" and ""Kings and Queen.""

But none grabs it quite as ferociously as Tyler Maynard, above. The whippet-thin, toothy Mr. Maynard plays Mark, the ingratiatingly peppy band member who has a not-so-secret, dogmatically incorrect crush on Matthew, the band's slickly hunky lead singer. Mark's looks of puppyish adoration grow more fierce as the musical proceeds, and his claws come out when Matthew aims a sincere serenade to a girl in the audience. Mark also performs the show's single funniest song, a rousing anthem in which he comes out -- as a Catholic. Mr. Maynard's deliciously overwrought performance is both an affectionate tribute to and a parody of ""American Idol""-style vocal histrionics. It typifies the sly manner in which the musical manages to exploit the appeal of the pop genre it's parodying even as it accentuates its silliness.

Contemporary Australian dance companies are known for their heartiness, and this one from Melbourne is considered especially bold. It's appearing here in the New York premiere of ""Tense Dave"" (above), which promises to be a dance-theater piece that travels through a strange and fractured world of fears, paranoia and unfulfilled fantasies. The journey is being guided by a team headed by Gideon Obarzanek, the company's artistic director; Lucy Guerin, a prominent Australian choreographer; and Michael Kantor, a theater director trained in Melbourne and Paris. ""Tense Dave"" is set on a continually revolving stage in which spaces are revealed and then obscured as the protagonist is drawn into emotional dramas and confusions filled with images of obsession, isolation, manipulation and collisions. Psychological intrigues are rife. Encounters are wild. And what appears to be reality is deceptive. Five dancers create the turbulence, and original music by Franc Tetaz helps make this theatrical odyssey quite a trip. Chunky Move seeks to explore the myriad possibilities of contemporary dance in Australia, and its productions try to be diverse in both form and content. ""Tense Dave"" is considered the most theatrically elaborate work to date by this company founded by Mr. Obarzanek in 1995.

Mr. de Klerk, who won the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela for his role in ending apartheid, said that the name Pretoria had ""a central and honorable place in our history,"" reflecting South Africans' triumph against British colonialism. Pretoria was named for Andries Pretorius, a prominent Afrikaner figure. But he is best known for the 1838 Battle of Blood River, so named because a river ran red with Zulu blood.

Mr. Hazel and another trustee also suggested that the Corcoran's president and director, David C. Levy, resign, The Post reported. Mr. Levy declined but said he would step aside if the dispute became rancorous. After more than two years of design and program development with Mr. Gehry, the Corcoran board approved plans to build a second and final wing in 1999 that would add about 140,000 square feet.

The change comes just a few days after the government said the economy grew at a faster-than-expected annual pace of 5.3 percent in the first quarter, the strongest growth in a year. Some economists said the move could mean the Bank of Japan realizes that a tighter monetary policy is likely in the near future. ""This is very symbolic in a sense that this is a turning point,"" Masaaki Kanno, a former Bank of Japan official and chief economist at JP Morgan Securities Asia, told Reuters. ""At the same time, it will take more than a year to see the end"" of the current policy.

The Victor, which opened in February (with a highly publicized party that drew the ire of animal rights activists protesting the gimmick of having penguins in the hotel pool), bucks that migration by offering a lushly designed haven - the first hotel project in the United States by the Parisian decorator Jacques Garcia, of Htel Costes fame - for guests who want to feel like reverse pioneers.

""Health is it, baby,"" Oprah said at the outset. ""Health is everything. Health beats shoes."" Roizen and Oz are both doctors (Oz is also the host of a medical show on the Discovery Channel), and their book is a jargon-free, if mildly corny, assortment of health advice and trivia. (Typical sentence: ""Gallstones and the Rolling Stones aren't the only stones that can change your life."") ""You: The Owner's Manual"" covers the waterfront, body-wise, but on Oprah's show a good deal of the talk was about keeping your colon healthy -- ""I never thought I'd be discussing this on TV,"" Oprah exclaimed. Oz was involved with the team at New York-Presbyterian Hospital that performed the recent quadruple bypass operation on former President Bill Clinton, and Clinton made a taped guest appearance on the show. ""He's the president of the United States,"" Oz said, ""and he's as well tested as you can be . . . you cannot test for safety. You've got to live to be safe."" Along the way, Oprah tossed out 12 words that put the post-Atkins-diet book industry on full alert.

Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven was a real-life German migr turned baroness; in Steinke's fiction, her adventures begin in 1904 when she's an impoverished naf working as a ""living statue"" at the Wintergarten Cabaret in Berlin. After many lovers, two marriages and a tempestuous union with the penniless Baron von Freytag-Loringhoven, Elsa finds herself alone in a jail cell in Greenwich Village. Undaunted, she goes on to become the Courtney Love of her time: hanging out with Marcel Duchamp, composing poems that are like ""small explosions"" for The Little Review, parading through the streets in outrageous costumes (a car's blinking tail light for a bustle, a dress covered with bits of newspaper) -- and trying not to succumb to the madness that destroyed her mother.

They describe thoughts crowding their minds, nattering at them incessantly -- anxious thoughts, sexual thoughts, violent thoughts, sometimes all at the same time. Is the front door locked? Are there germs on my hands? Am I a murderer if I step on an ant? And they describe increasingly elaborate rituals to assuage those thoughts -- checking and rechecking door locks, washing and rewashing hands, walking carefully, slowly and in bizarre patterns to avoid stepping on anything. They feel driven to do things they know make no sense.",2005-05-22T05:00:00+0000

Valerie Brett, Monmouth Beach, N.J. You are right to shun counterfeit handbags, but you may buy knockoffs, which are not the same thing. A knockoff apes the appearance of the original but does not present itself as other than what it is. It is not built around fraud (and probably not skillfully hand-stitched fine leather either). Nor does a knockoff run afoul of trademark law. Drawing on other people's work -- in fashion, in art, in literature -- is how ideas spread through the culture. (Is Eric Clapton a knockoff Robert Johnson? Is that a bad thing? Would absorbing the styles of three or four additional guitar greats make him more virtuous?) Besides, if absolute originality were the summum bonum, how would we get along without network television? More potent arguments could be made against unlicensed street vendors -- their sometimes lighthearted attitude toward paying taxes, your difficulty getting a refund from a merchant who is vigorously nomadic -- but neither these nor your fear for the well-being of Louis Vuitton compels you to eschew them.",2005-05-22T05:00:00+0000

In the early evening of May 9, 2005, Cheryl Courrege Burguieres, devoted wife and mother, peacefully passed away at home surrounded by her family after a bravely fought 15 year battle with breast cancer. Her memorial service was officiated by Archbishop Joseph Fiorenza at St. Anne Catholic Church in Houston, TX. Burial service took place at St. Helen Cemetery, Florence Plantation, LA. Cheryl was born in New Iberia, LA, on August 23, 1944, the second of four children born to Irene LeBlanc Courrege and Emile John Courrege. She graduated from Our Lady of Mt. Carmel High School in New Iberia, and the University of Louisiana, where she was a member of Alpha Omicron Pi sorority. On August 21, 1965, she married Philip Burguieres, her sweetheart throughout high school and college. The young couple moved to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where Cheryl taught History and Government. After living in Philadelphia where she worked at the University of Pennsylvania, and Edinburgh, Scotland she moved to Houston, TX. In 1999, her book, One Centimeter, was published, relating the autobiographical story of a young woman's interactions with her doctor upon learning that she has breast cancer. The book raised over $100,000, all of which has been donated in support of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Cheryl was a member of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and served on the Board of Directors of the Homes of St. Mark. She was active in her adopted Houston community as a volunteer for the United Way of the Gulf Coast, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Heritage Society, and the Houston Symphony and was dedicated in her support of Baylor Research Advocates for Student Scientists. Cheryl was also an owner of the Houston Texans. Together with her husband in 1999, she was honored as one of the Cancer League's Pacesetter Couples of the Year. In 2004, she was recognized by the Samaritan Center and most recently received, along with her husband Philip, the Smithsonian Institute?s Woodrow Wilson award for Public Service. Beyond the considerable talents Cheryl shared publicly, she was so much more to her family and friends. In addition to being a wonderful wife, mother, daughter, sister and friend, Cheryl was a history lover, a devout Catholic, and wise counsel to those she loved.

Crystal-clear lakes, rapids, streams, and marshes were surrounded by cottonwood trees, sugar maples, black walnuts, elms, and ashes. Meadows overflowed with wildflowers. Sunfish, perch, and bulletheads flourished in the waters. Red squirrels, grey foxes, turkeys, and wild pigeons roamed the thick woods. ",2005-05-22T05:00:00+0000

But Fenton (1819-1869) was a full-service photographer with an instinct for majestic compositions, technical clarity and superb uses of light. His subjects included the Thames, Salisbury Cathedral, the brooding Welsh landscape, sundry stately homes and river views, the royal family and, in one especially abstract instance, Queen Victoria's target -- suggesting startlingly good marksmanship.

In the House in the early 1990's, he fell in with a band of junior Republicans (nicknamed the Gang of Seven) who pushed aggressive investigations of both Democrats and Republicans. Elected to the more mannered Senate in 1994, Santorum took to the floor just months into his tenure displaying a sign for several days that read ""Where's Bill?"" to spotlight what he perceived as President Clinton's lack of leadership on balancing the federal budget. (Senator Robert Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, commented that the young senator's style seemed more appropriate for ""an alehouse or beer tavern."") In a much-publicized interview in 2003, he argued that the Supreme Court should not overturn state sodomy laws that ban homosexual sex and suggested that such a ruling would create a justification for bigamy, polygamy and incest.

But what will the ""Star Wars"" faithful do now that the series is ending? The novels, cartoons and games will continue, and there's talk of a live-action television series, but the films -- the original ""Star Wars"" scripture -- will halt.

Mr. Saillard, 38, who oversees exhibitions at the Muse de la Mode et du Textile in Paris, said, ""I like the idea of placing clothes and products in space."" Professionally, Mr. Saillard lives in fashion flux: He recently staged a Yohji Yamamoto retrospective and before that designed a show on the history of handbags. His own wardrobe is firmly rooted in one era and aesthetic. ""I love the 1950's for men's fashion, and the idea of l'habit du dimanche,"" he said, translating the phrase as roughly ""your Sunday best."" Here he wears khakis and a denim blazer by Dsquared, a vintage shirt and tie, Paul Smith glasses and Helmut Lang shoes. Three chains hang at his waist: one is a gift from his friend Christian Lacroix, and another, in silver leather, is by Mr. Yamamoto. Mr. Saillard's other staples include dark, stiff jeans by A.P.C. and Helmut Lang, which he wears with very wide cuffs.

Founding Director of the Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA, died on April 20, 2005, after a prolonged illness. He was formerly Chair of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Professor and Chief of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven. Dr. Rasmussen is remembered for his many scientific accomplishments and his pivotal role in the establishment of the Institute at MCG. Born on March 1, 1925, Dr. Rasmussen grew up on a dairy farm in Pennsylvania with his five brothers. His young adult years were spent as a soldier on the front lines of the European Theater of Operations. He was twice wounded, earning him a purple heart with oak leaf clusters. Through the G.I. bill, he attended Gettysburg College and graduated Magna cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science in 1948. From there he went to the medical school at Harvard University, again graduating Magna cum Laude in 1952. Dr. Rasmussen completed his post-graduate medical training in Internal Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital before pursuing a research fellowship at University College in London (England). He was among the first to isolate parathyroid hormone before returning to the US and earning a doctoral degree in 1959 in Biochemistry and Physiology from Rockefeller University. He then obtained an Assistant Professorship at Rockefeller, where he remained until 1961, when he accepted a position as Associate Professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He was then recruited as the Benjamin Rush Professor and Chairman of Biochemistry to the University of Pennsylvania. With research focused on parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, calcitonin and aldosterone action, Dr. Rasmussen was one of the first scientists to appreciate the importance of calcium as a signaling molecule at a time when most research concentrated on cyclic AMP as second messenger. In 1976 Dr. Rasmussen accepted a position as Professor of Medicine and Cell Biology and Chief of the Endocrinology and Metabolism section at Yale Medical School. His research in aldosterone and insulin secretion and vascular smooth muscle contraction resulted in hundreds of publications in prestigious scientific journals, large amounts of federal funding, multiple awards and honors. In 1993, Dr. Rasmussen accepted the challenge to establish and direct a new Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics at MCG. He retired in 2000. His wife, Jane Spence, whom he married in 1952 and who remained by his side until her death in 1999, predeceased Dr. Rasmussen. He has four children: Gail, Paul, Jane, and Craig.

They describe thoughts crowding their minds, nattering at them incessantly -- anxious thoughts, sexual thoughts, violent thoughts, sometimes all at the same time. Is the front door locked? Are there germs on my hands? Am I a murderer if I step on an ant? And they describe increasingly elaborate rituals to assuage those thoughts -- checking and rechecking door locks, washing and rewashing hands, walking carefully, slowly and in bizarre patterns to avoid stepping on anything.

After public comment and discussions with the New York Civil Liberties Union, the police considered a partial ban on photos of tunnels, control booths and other areas closed to the public, but decided against it, said Christopher Dunn, the associate legal director of the civil liberties group. ""From the outset, we have believed that a total ban would unnecessarily infringe on First Amendment rights,"" he said. The decision was first reported in The Daily News yesterday. Paul J.

He was a gentleman of great learning and intellect, a patriot who served his country in war and peace, a brilliant businessman, and a philanthropist whose generosity touched the world. Through the American Austrian Foundation, he helped establish the Salzburg Seminar Medical Programs in which the faculty of the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University and leading physicians of the major hospitals in New York, Philadelphia and Duke University, with the support of the Soros Open Society Institute and the Austrian government, have given seminars and extended instruction to over 6,000 doctors from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It has beeen said that these programs are the most important contributions to the health and well being of the peoples of that part of the world since the collapse of the Iron Curtain. Ambassador Wolf established a program for young Austrian journalists in partnership with the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University. The seminar program in his name on Media and Diplomacy has been hailed for its impact by its host, the Vienna Diplomatic Academy. He also initiated an intern program for graduate students at Case Western Reserve University in cooperation with Austrian financial institutions. He welcomed creative ideas, constructive discussion, and never stopped encouraging young people to consider public service as the highest calling. We share the sorrow of his children, Nancy, Caryn, Sherri and Leslie. On July 25, we will dedicate a park in Salzburg, Austria, that Ambassador Wolf gave in memory of his beloved wife, Roslyn. Milton Wolf brought honor to every aspect of his extraordinary life. His memory will be cherished always. Wiliam J. vanden Heuvel Vice Chair Thomas J.

Schumer said yesterday that the State Department of Environmental Conservation should not renew a permit for a hazardous-waste facility in Williamsburg. State environmental regulators have scheduled a public hearing for today on whether the station's owner, Radiac, should receive a renewal of a nuclear storage permit from the state, the senator said. Critics have said that Williamsburg is not an appropriate site for the station, which stores hazardous waste and low-level nuclear waste from medical devices. ""The bottom line is that this facility is not essential and should not be located in a populated, and increasingly popular, Brooklyn community,"" Mr. Schumer said. He said a fire at the site could threaten 130,000 people who live within a mile. Radiac officials said yesterday that the levels of waste at the site were too low to pose a risk even after an accident. John Tekin, Radiac's operations manager, said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had concluded that ""the radioactive materials we store are below areas of concern and a radiological release would have no health and safety consequences.""

She spent her junior year abroad in Aix-en-Provence and graduated from Muskingum with degrees in both French and Psychology. In 1966 Gina joined IBM, where she worked as a marketing representative, a software instructor, and executive consultant. In 1973 Gina entered the doctoral program in counseling psychology at Stanford University. As a doctoral student she began a 20-year collaboration with Meyer Friedman on the study and treatment of Type A Behavior. Gina helped develop the treatment protocol for modifying Type A Behavior in the Recurrent Coronoary Prevention Project (RCPP). The RCPP reduced both Type A Behavior and the rate of recurrent heart attacks in a group of over 1,000 post-coronary men and women. In 1978 Gina married Peter Enemark. That same year she began to study Christian Science. In 1980 Gina's son David Price Enemark was born, and she received her Ph.D. in counseling psychology. In 1982 her son Daniel Price Enemark was born, and Gina published her first book, ""Type A Behavior: A Model for Research and Practice."" Gina led stress-management groups in the RCPP, at the Army War College, in the private sector, and in the Coronary/Cancer Prevention Project (CCPP). She also trained group leaders for the RCPP and for the CCPP. During the Soviet era, Gina traveled to Poland to teach the diagnosis and treatment of Type A Behavior there. She had a small private practice in Palo Alto, CA. Of all her professional activities, leading stress-management groups was the most important to Gina. Her observation that people with different personalities manifest Type A Behavior in different ways led Gina to study the Enneagram theory of personality types. She published her second book, ""The Essential Enneagram: The Definitive Personality Test and Self-Discovery Guide,"" in 2000, which included a self-test (validated on a group of over 900 people) that Gina developed based on her work at the Army War College. Gina traveled to Greece, Latvia, Thailand and Turkey to conduct workshops on the Enneagram. Gina was a businesswoman, a scholar, a research scientist, an author, a therapist, a group leader, a wife and a mother. She always believed that being a mother was her most important role. Gina was a member of Second Church of Christ, Scientist in Palo Alto, CA, and a volunteer chaplain in the San Mateo County jails. A memorial service will be held at Menlo Park Presbyterian Church, on Saturday, May 28, 2005, at 11 am. For information contact Spangler Mortuaries, Mountain View, CA.",2005-05-23T05:00:00+0000

The announcement came on the day of the company's season-opening gala at the Metropolitan Opera House. Although the orchestra had voted last week to authorize a strike, its union, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, said the players would have performed at the gala nonetheless because it is a fund-raiser. The union said the company had agreed in writing not to use a virtual orchestra machine, an issue Local 802 has been pressing at Broadway theaters and small opera houses. David Lennon, the local's president, said the company had been insisting until near the end on its right to use the machine, but it signed off on a ban as part of the agreement. Mr. Lennon said the local was demanding such a ban in all the union's negotiations. Rachel S. Moore, the executive director of American Ballet Theater, said the company had been committed all along to using live music. She said the delay came only because the company wanted to make sure that use of the machine could be negotiated as an exception for nonorchestral sounds, if necessary, in the future. She and Mr. Lennon said they could not comment on specifics of the contract until the membership voted on it tonight. DANIEL J. WAKIN",2005-05-24T05:00:00+0000

Pataki, the Democratic-led State Assembly voted last night to override his veto of a bill to overhaul New York State's budget process and move the budget deadline to May 1 from April 1. The Republican-led Senate overrode the veto earlier this month. By a vote of 112 to 29, well over the two-thirds majority needed, the Assembly adopted the legislation that lawmakers in both parties say is not a power grab but an effort to ensure on-time budgets. It backed up a statewide referendum that would, if it passes in November, give the Legislature more power in writing budgets. Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, above, said the move was a ""giant leap backwards"" in trying to fix Albany's ways and pointed out that some budget watchdogs believed it would lead to ""irresponsible spending.""

The program will allow users to search the contents of books, displaying context-specific ""snippets"" of the texts of copyrighted works. In a letter to Google dated Friday, the details of which were first reported by BusinessWeek on Monday, Peter Givler, executive director of the press association, said that Google Print for Libraries ""appears to involve systematic infringement of copyright on a massive scale."" Mr. Givler said the service has ""the potential for serious financial damage"" to the members of the press association, a collection of largely not-for-profit businesses that typically produce and sell scholarly works of nonfiction that have relatively little commercial potential. In a statement, Google said that it has an ""active dialogue with all of our publishing partners,"" adding that it protects the copyright holders by allowing users of Google Print to view only a few short sentences of protected text.

us,The Listings; ELEPHANT LARRY,"""We pursue understanding beyond the limitations of existing knowledge, ideology and disciplinary structure,"" the mission statement of Cornell University says, and five of its former students seem to have absorbed that methodology, in a fun-house-mirror sort of way. The five, who met at the campus and are now in their mid-20's, constitute the sketch-comedy troupe Elephant Larry, and they have been selling out ""Boom,"" their Saturday night show at the People's Improv Theater, since early April with a hilarious multimedia mix of the deadpan and the maniacal. The sketches call to mind, variously, Monty Python, Kids in the Hall and Second City, yet they don't feel like knockoffs. Perhaps that's because they ricochet fearlessly from subtly savvy to aggressively lowbrow. In the latter category are a sketch in which Frankenstein's monster makes his own monster and another called ""Goblins America"" with the troupe in ridiculous masks, singing a ribald song to the tune of ""God Bless America."" Geoff Haggerty, who founded Elephant Larry three years ago with Chris Principe, Jeff Solomon, Stefan Lawrence and Alexander Zalben, said that ""Goblins,"" like much of the troupe's material, came about through serendipity: somebody made a reference to the patriotic song, somebody else misheard him, and by the time the riffing was done they had a sketch. As for the subtle stuff, Mr. Principe and Mr. Haggerty (above in goggles with Mr. Solomon, left; Mr. Zalben, with bucket; and Mr. Lawrence) show a knack for respecting the audience's intelligence with a droll sketch in which they are 19th-century fellows who can't remember what year it is; the references they drop will wake up all those brain cells that have been dormant since your high school history final. Oh, and don't expect much time to catch your breath during ""Boom"": the quintet covers its costume changes with nutty film clips. (People's Improv Theater, 154 West 29th Street; (212)563-7488.)

us,'KOYAANISQATSI',"It's been more than two decades since the director Godfrey Reggio teamed up with Philip Glass and the cinematographer Ron Fricke to create this sweeping film about runaway technology, modern urban living and the widening chasm that separates us from the natural world. The Hopi title translates as ""life out of balance,"" and there is no dialogue or characters -- just an arresting collage of images that contrasts the pristine beauty of the sky and the wilderness with the chaos of city life, often sped up into a hypnotic swirl. Mr. Glass's score is full of primal chants and restless, churning music that help the visuals reach their emotional mark. Viewed today, ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" above, may seem like a vintage artifact of the early 1980's and of an earlier chapter of the environmental movement, but the film also comes across as eerily prescient. Mr. Reggio, a former monk, later expanded his critique with ""Powaqqatsi"" (1988) and ""Naqoyqatsi"" (2002), and this week brings a rare opportunity to consider the trilogy as a group. Beginning Thursday with ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" probably the best of the trio, Lincoln Center will present all three films on consecutive nights, with a live performance of the scores by the Philip Glass Ensemble, conducted by Michael Riesman.

Manic examples of virtuosic editing, they are rapid-fire successions of changing, pulsating patterns, some geometric, others lava-lamp oozy. One new black-and-white piece, ""Flip Grid Cycle,"" looks like a corporate logo repeatedly forming and breaking apart, while ""Kaleidoscope Feedback I,"" a collaboration with the artists Eamon Brown and Jim Drain, suggests amoebas jostling on a microscope slide. Earlier color videos, made when Mr. Peterson and Mr. Drain were members of Forcefield, are aggressively hypnotic. Later pieces -- ""Energy Fields"" (2003), above, is an example -- are like Op Art on fast-forward and also like flashbacks to the light shows of the 1960's drugs-and-music culture, though there is nothing mellow about them. Their optical assault is a reminder of how unlaid-back and on-the-attack that culture could be. The show's one figurative video, ""UV"" (for Ultra Violence), pieced together from movie clips of people being shot, stabbed and sliced, and seen here in a reduced version, is a killer: a 3-minute, 9-second bad trip coming at you like a spray of machine-gun fire.

Mr. Lamy was approved without the usual regional animosities, as developing countries warmed to his stance that the poorest countries should not have to open their markets as quickly as richer nations. As the trade representative, Mr. Lamy often fought with the United States on issues from steel production to genetically modified crops, but he managed to maintain good relations with Washington in part because of his friendship with Robert B. Zoellick, the former United States trade representative. Mr. Lamy's efforts to get the European Union to cut farm subsidies, which hurt the developing world by depressing prices, also pleased poor nations, though it earned him criticism at home in France.

""You can teach yourself how to write thrillers,"" he once told The Associated Press, ""the same way you can teach yourself how to write journalism."" Yeah, O.K. But keep in mind that Camp was no slacker as a journalist, either. (He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for a series of articles, written for The St. Paul Pioneer Press, about a Minnesota farm family.) His new book as Sandford, ""Broken Prey,"" enters the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 3 -- it's the first of his last six novels not to make its debut at either No. 1 or No. 2. Camp, who is 61, began writing thrillers in the late 1980's after realizing that even a prizewinning journalist might have trouble putting two kids through college. He published ""Rules of Prey,"" the first novel in what would become his Prey series, in 1989. That book introduced his stud-muffin hero, Lucas Davenport, an unconventional Minnesota lawman. ""Lucas is a composite of cops and movie stars, with the emphasis on movie stars,"" Camp said in a recent interview. ""He certainly doesn't resemble any real cop I've ever met.

us,Fiction Chronicle,"BOOGALOO ON 2ND AVENUE: A Novel of Pastry, Guilt, and Music. By Mark Kurlansky. (Ballantine, $24.95.) Loose and jangly, Kurlansky's novel is a joyful celebration of a New York neighborhood in the late 1980's, a time when Darryl Strawberry was hitting, Michael Dukakis had not yet climbed into the tank and East Village residents could almost ignore the encroaching signs of gentrification. Against this backdrop, Nathan Seltzer, Kurlansky's mid-30's, married hero, contemplates selling his copy shop and has an affair with a pastry maker. The neighborhood's lively mix of cultures and languages -- English, Spanish, Italian, Yiddish and German -- pulls him in many directions, encompassing everything from Caribbean black magic to Eastern European minyans. A columnist for Food & Wine magazine, Kurlansky knows how to make food sexy and sex foody -- especially in the scene where Nathan's lover teaches him to make chocolate buttercream frosting. Although the plot of ""Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue"" is impossibly Dickensian, it works because Kurlansky is so clearly in control -- and so clearly enjoying himself. He certainly has a knack for incorporating eccentric detail: who knew that the cost of turning a Puerto Rican into a Dominican, tattoos included, was $987.45?",2005-05-29T05:00:00+0000

us,When Evil Could Be a Rabbit-Loving Grandfather,"IT took daring in 1967 for a young French director to make a warmhearted comedy about wartime anti-Semitism, when the shame of his country under German occupation was still fresh in people's memory. But Claude Berri's first feature, ""The Two of Us"" -- based upon his own experiences as a hidden Jewish child in France during World War II and rereleased on Friday -- also owes its wild charm to two brilliant performers. Alain Cohen was 9 when Mr. Berri cast him as Claude, a Parisian scamp whose parents, fearing for his safety, ship him off to the countryside with only a shaky grasp of the Lord's Prayer and a new, very Gallic last name. The legendary actor Michel Simon, then 72, played the gruff farmer who, unaware of the boy's origins, takes him in; this elderly vegetarian loves his aged dog as much as he hates the ""enemies of France,"" including, and especially, the Jews. An unlikely affection blossoms between the two, a fierce tenderness born of their mutual isolation in a world of encroaching darkness.",2005-05-29T05:00:00+0000

He was a philosopher, musician, poet, director, cinematographer, aerial cinematographer, filmmaker and, most of all, an incredible man. Bob was highly skilled in all these areas. He won many awards including an Emmy for his work. He was a devout Buddhist. Bob was extremely humble and never talked about himself or his accomplishments, but only about the love of his work. Bob did everything in such a unique way that his friends and family referred to his lifestyle as Fultonian, as if he had developed an entirely different culture and way of life. To tell one's story about Bob was never enough, people always wanted to hear more and know more about this fascinating man. To watch Bob fly a plane was like watching a virtuoso playing an instrument. He taught me many things, both in the sky and on the ground. His lessons of ""point of intended touchdown"" is something I will never forget. A wonder with words, Fulton never used profanity; he thought it was an abuse of the English language and demonstrated a lack of a proper vocabulary. I miss my generous mentor and good friend, Bob Fulton, who is in my thoughts every day. Taz Saunders FULTON -- Robert Edison. Dear Bob, hard to believe years have gone by since that fateful night.

Born in Shawnee, OK, on New Year's Eve, 1928, to Lester Thompson, a petroleum engineer, and Eleanor Folz, she pursued a scientific career while raising a family of four children at a time when women in science had to choose between having a family or a career. After graduating from Mount Holyoke College, she met her future husband Karl G. Lark at Cold Spring Harbor, NY, where they were both involved in research. Thereafter, they collaborated frequently over a long and distinguished scientific career that took her from Washington University in St. Louis to Manhattan, Kansas, and ultimately to the University of Utah, in Salt Lake. Before retiring, she was a persistent researcher and teacher, traits she carried into retirement where she devoted her energies to developing an exotic garden full of plants she handpicked from all over the globe. At home, her teaching showed her children the how and why of scholasticism instead of just accepting easy answers. ""Look it up"" was a mantra: learn the tools and you never forget the answers or how to solve difficulties. She stimulated interest in literature by encouraging exploration of local libraries and ignoring those pesky age delimiters that promoted certain books and hid others from curious minds. As her children matured and pursued their own interests, she brought a number of uniquely individual dogs and cats into the home. They provided constant companionship and vitality, often traveling on trips to Colorado, along with her husband. In addition to her husband and four children (Clovis, Ellen, Susie, and Caroline), she is survived by a brother, David Thompson, of Florida. Funeral arrangements are private. An open memorial service is planned for late June or July. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Cynthia's name to Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, 5001 Angel Canyon Drive, Kanab, UT 84741.",2005-05-29T05:00:00+0000

A Duke University surgeon and urologist who combined a career as a leading medical scientist and physician with a passion for the arts and charitable causes, died at his Durham, NC home on April 21, 2005. He was 94. Semans was a pioneer in rehabilitative and urinary surgery who during World War II developed an operation to relieve retained urine due to spinal cord injury. At that time, renal failure was the primary cause of an early death in paralyzed veterans. In addition to his leadership as a medical scholar, Semans, along with his wife of 52 years, Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans, was involved in numerous arts and charitable causes. Semans helped lead the establishment of the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem in the 1960s and served as chairman of the school's board of trustees for the first 17 years. He also served for 48 years on The Mary Duke Biddle Foundation and was chair until his retirement in 2004. The Mary Duke Biddle Foundation funds charitable activities at Duke and other institutions in North Carolina and New York. As leader of the Biddle Foundation, he was asked to assist with the development of arts education and performing components at Duke, and was instrumental in the establishment of the Ciompi Quartet and the Institute of the Arts. Semans served on dozens of nonprofit boards of directors. He was president of the North Carolina Society for Crippled Children and Adults and vice president of the National Paraplegia Foundation and served on the Governor's Committee for Employment of the Handicapped. He was also an active leader in many arts, educational and cultural institutions and organizations. As a member of the North Carolina State Arts Council, Semans suggested establishing an emerging artists program that today provides programs in communities across North Carolina. For years he served on the Advisory Board of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, and on the Advisory Council of the School of American Ballet. Born in 1910 in Uniontown, PA --the youngest of seven boys and one girl --Semans received his bachelor's degree in 1932 from Princeton University. He earned his medical degree in 1936 from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and where he remained on staff as a urologist. During World War II, he served for two-and-a-half years as a major in the Army's medical corps and cared for hundreds of injured soldiers. It was during this time that he developed a deep interest in people with disabilities, a population for whom he was an advocate all of his life. After the war, he entered private practice for six years in Atlanta before joining the Duke medical staff as a surgeon and associate professor of urology. He was promoted to professor of urology in 1961. In 1953, Semans married Mary Duke Biddle Trent, the great-granddaughter of Washington Duke, in whose honor Duke University was named. Together they focused their energies on charitable work, especially involving the arts. At Duke the Semanses and the late Dr. Wayne Rundles established a premiere hospital arts program --now known as The Health Arts Network --at Duke Medical Center. Semans was an advocate for Duke establishing a world - class university museum and was instrumental in the development of the new $23 million Nasher Museum of Art, which is scheduled to open at Duke in the fall. In 1997, the Semanses were awarded the North Carolina Philanthropy Award. In recognition of their leadership in human relations, the Semanses received the first Humanitarian Freedom Award given by the Durham chapter of Hadassah in 1960. Nine years later, they received the National Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews for distinguished service in human relations. Semans also was honored by the North Carolina School of the Arts, Duke University, Duke University Hospital and the North Carolina Association of Arts Councils, among others. In addition to his wife, Semans is survived by seven children: Mary Trent Jones of Abingdon, VA; Sally Trent Harris of Charlotte, NC; Dr. Rebecca Trent Kirkland of Houston; Barbara Trent Kimbrell of Sullivan's Island, SC; Jenny Semans Koortbojian of Durham; James Duke Biddle Trent Semans of Chapel Hill and Beth Semans Hubbard of Los Angeles; 16 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren.

There she sat by her candle, knowing no one and unable to speak the language. The silence, in contrast to London, was eerie. As she looked up from the letter she was writing, eyes glared through a glass door. Looming through the darkness, bloody hands showed themselves and shook at her. She longed for the sound of a footstep; she missed her cat. 'I want to see something alive,' her pen scratched, 'death in so many frightful shapes has taken hold of my fancy.'

Bob did everything in such a unique way that his friends and family referred to his lifestyle as Fultonian, as if he had developed an entirely different culture and way of life. To tell one's story about Bob was never enough, people always wanted to hear more and know more about this fascinating man. To watch Bob fly a plane was like watching a virtuoso playing an instrument. He taught me many things, both in the sky and on the ground. His lessons of ""point of intended touchdown"" is something I will never forget.

A Transport Ministry official told the newspaper that the airline suffered from incompetent managers who had not determined whether the route was economically sustainable before starting it. Shunned by Western travelers, Air Zimbabwe has tried to make money by turning east, serving Beijing and Singapore as well as Dubai. But Zimbabwe's poor economy and the airline's generally creaky planes have dissuaded customers. Not long ago, its in-flight magazine ran an article assuring ticket-holders that rumors that the airline was not safe to fly were unfounded. Michael Wines (NYT)",2005-05-31T05:00:00+0000

Everything else is picking nits: I could explain why 77 percent, not 64 percent, is the right number, but does it really matter? The only significant example was his claim that I blended household and establishment survey data on jobs, in an attempt to score political points. But as I showed in the previous note, I didnt and in the column itself I pointed readers to the correct data. Now Mr. Okrent claims that he was only referring to my assertion that the economy needs to add 140,000 payroll jobs per month, which for some reason he thinks comes from the household survey. (It doesnt.) Sorry, thats an unconvincing evasive maneuver. Mr. Okrent clearly accused me of playing mix and match with the job numbers themselves. In fact, in our correspondence, when I said that it was all payroll data, he declared that your insistence that you relied only on one set of numbers is very puzzling. I dont see how the math works any other way; maybe you could further enlighten me. In other words, the only accusation that could have justified Mr. Okrents attack was completely unfounded.
