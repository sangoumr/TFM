On the third floor of the New Haven police station, Detective Kris Cuddy had just finished interviewing the mother of a young rape victim. After escorting the woman downstairs, she was returning to her office in the Special Victims Unit. Her square-heeled boots made a quick, hard sound as she left the elevators, a tock-tock-tock that could be heard above the ringing phones and cubicle chatter. The detective had an Irish face  blue-eyed, pale-skinned, puckish, her coppery brown hair shorn close at the sides into a fauxhawk. She was one of only four investigators in the S.V.U., and she had 32 cases open at the moment. But during interviews with victims or their family members, she never displayed any sign of the pressure she was under. Her manner was steady and reassuring. So were here to discuss an incident that happened recently, she would begin, making only a vague allusion to the matter at hand before stepping back to allow people to tell the story in their own way. She would offer water, offer a tissue. Let them talk, circling back later to gather more details.

Rick Snyder of Michigan declared a state of emergency for the Flint area on Tuesday as concerns grew about the health effects of lead-tainted water there. His order, which followed emergency declarations by the city and county governments, came on the day federal officials announced an investigation of the contamination. Mr. Snyders administration has been criticized as slow to respond to residents concerns about their water. Last week, he apologized and announced staffing changes at the state agency that oversees environmental quality. Flint, which had long received water from Lake Huron provided by Detroits water utility, began drawing its water from the Flint River in 2014 in an effort to save money while a new pipeline was built. Residents soon complained about rashes and strange odors from the river water, but city and state officials mostly insisted that it was safe to drink. Last year, elevated levels of lead were found in childrens blood, and in October, Flint switched back to Detroits water system. Mr. Snyder, a Republican, said Tuesday that the emergency declaration would allow for more state resources to be used in addressing the effects of the tainted water. ",2016-01-06T00:45:32+0000

The main exhibition, A Constellation, includes the work of 26 artists and focuses on themes of abstraction, the figure and the history of the African diaspora. Black: Color, Material, Concept continues the conversation around blackness initiated by Thelma Golden, director and chief curator of the museum, who introduced the term post-black into the cultural conversation almost 15 years ago with the exhibition Freestyle. In the basement, a sculptural installation by Marc Andre Robinson weaves together formalism with black cultural history, while another, Lorraine OGrady: Art Is   offers a fantastic exhibition of photographs documenting Ms. Gradys performance piece during the 1983 African-American Day Parade, in which she skillfully weaves together art, activism and participation.",2016-01-07T22:53:13+0000

Sometimes we reprint a list from years past. Sometimes we ask best-selling authors for their book-related wish lists or resolutions. This year, we bring you cookies: specifically, Rosanna Pansinos atom cookies, from The Nerdy Nummies Cookbook, at No.5 in its second month on the food and fitness list (available online). Pansino belongs to the growing club of YouTube stars who have crossed over into publishing; her online baking show, also called Nerdy Nummies, has more than three million subscribers who watch her take goofy delight in treats like doughnut waffles. (These are, literally, store-bought glazed doughnuts, heated and pressed in a home waffle iron. Im not sure that qualifies as baking, but it sounds amazing.) If you suspect that Pansinos appeal has as much to do with charm and presentation as with the actual recipes, her book probably wont change your mind. But she is charming, in her way. Heres how she introduces those atom cookies, which are just six-pointed sugar cookies iced and decorated to resemble a science classs atom model, with an M&M nucleus and candy pearl electrons: Atoms are the building blocks of every type of matter in the universe  even you! My grandfather was a nuclear physicist, my uncle followed in his footsteps, and my dads old high school even had an atom on its emblem. I guess you could say we have an atomic bond.

Then there was Wolfgang Hilbig, born in Saxony in 1941, who shoveled coal in a factory boiler room before discovering his true calling.

This statement, and indeed the whole book, can be read as a response to the accusations of sexism that have followed Hickey since the culture wars of the 90s, when he published The Invisible Dragon, a series of cantankerous essays attacking the academic art establishment. According to Hickey, beauty, once the handmaiden of art, had been sacrificed on the altar of political correctness by a censorious ring of tenured apparatchiks. Hickeys antagonists fought back. For the feminist critic Amelia Jones, his revival of an abstract notion of beauty served to validate a particular group of critics (almost all white men) as having access to the truth. For its critics, beauty was hardly innocent or self-evident, but hampered with cultural baggage: the objectification of women, the exclusion of minorities and the meretricious seductions of the marketplace.

Roots, which chronicled Haleys search for his African ancestors (and in doing so created a template for the genealogical boom reflected in popular series like Finding Your Roots, with Henry Louis Gates Jr.), became an international phenomenon that turned the financially insecure Haley into an icon. Yet Haleys newfound celebrity and wealth proved to be a double-edged sword. Allegations of plagiarism and historical inaccuracies scarred him, diminishing his literary reputation, and, argues the historian Robert J.

Hyundai blamed a malfunctioning sensor on the electronic stability control system, which is supposed to detect if the vehicle is sliding in a direction at odds with how the steering wheel is turned. The recall is necessary because the sensor may activate the electronic stability control when it is not needed, increasing the risk of a crash, the automaker told regulators. Hyundai said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect. Some owners began complaining to regulators as early as 2013. It feels as if the auto is driving on flat wheels or on ice, a New Jersey owner wrote in 2013. ",2016-01-08T23:33:06+0000

The summary of the Monday decision posted on the courts website said all decisions made while the three members were incorporated into the Assembly would be void.

Cruz came prepared on both exchanges, and like others I would say that he won the night, though he did disappear for longish stretches later on and took some strafing fire from Marco Rubio (very) late in the evening. But then I also agree with the observerswho think Trump fundamentally had a good night as well: The Donald has learned a lot about debating since this show started, and even when placed on the defensive he was effective and disciplined responding to Cruz on the Canadian issue with more puckishness than bluster and then pivoting smoothly to 9/11 on the New York values issue. And then there was this moment, when a question about Nikki Haleys post-SOTU critique of the partys angriest voices allowed Trump to deliver pretty calmly and evenly what was probably the line of the night, if not of his campaign: She did say there was anger. Im very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.",2016-01-15T16:07:11+0000

It would be good to be able to say that his story is encouraging or uplifting; but Rawlences City of Thorns is a deeply disturbing and depressing portrait of the violence, destitution, fear, sense of hopelessness and neglect in which a large number of the worlds estimated 60 million forcibly displaced people now live.",2016-01-15T16:08:36+0000

Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we dont even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds.

Like other males who populate Hadleys fiction, Roland grew up in a family of vivid, sexually flamboyant women who considered him slightly ridiculous. Today, however, he is a public intellectual, with a gratifying position writing about film for the national newspapers. When he shows up for a summer holiday with his three grown sisters, driving a vintage Jaguar and wearing a white linen suit, accompanied by his glamorous new wife and his lovely 16-year-old daughter by a previous marriage, you might expect Roland to have earned a little domestic peace and adulation. But no. Not only do his sisters, who could remember him in short trousers, when his glasses were mended with sticking plaster, still consider him a buttoned-up puritan, but his sway over his wife and daughter is about to be assailed from the most unexpected quarters. The point about the past, in Hadleys fiction, is that its always there to trip you up. Your parents (whether dead or alive), your siblings (whether successful or resentfully needy) will inevitably threaten to suck you back into that sticky-sweet limbo of childhood myth and trauma.",2016-01-22T10:11:02+0000

It was his book The Conservative Mind (1953) that first used the word conservative to classify various currents of antiprogressive dissidence that ran from the French Revolution to the 20th-century heyday of social democracy. Kirks book was an event. After a recommendation from Whittaker Chambers, Time magazine devoted the entire book review section to it. And Kirk had other gifts. He was a capable writer of ghost and fantasy novels. He founded and edited two prestigious journals. Not just Strauss and Chambers but also T.S. Eliot and Ray Bradbury esteemed him.

From the very beginning, Bryson, an American from Iowa who has lived and worked and established a family on the far side of the Atlantic, has responded to his British surroundings with an irresistible mix of frustration and fascination. That first travelogue was inspired by what turned out to be a temporary move back to the United States. This new one, which begins with Bryson taking a challenging (and, he mischievously observes, not entirely accurate) test to qualify for dual citizenship, has him questioning how much he really understands modern Britain, a country that I dont altogether recognize.

When, however, Thatcher returned to the Kremlin, she removed her own coat and unzipped her fur-lined boots, whereupon Detective Superintendent Parker produced a pair of high-heeled shoes from his pockets. A firearm or a stiletto: Both seemed to have potential in the hands of a leader the Soviets had once christened the Iron Lady.
