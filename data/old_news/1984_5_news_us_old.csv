In music, whether for good reasons or not, this was often taken as a watershed time, a point at which a performer could be expected to show signs of significant growth, if ever that were going to happen. Now, perhaps, we should be content to wait a couple of decades for the onset of artistic maturity. Take Misha Dichter, for instance. The pianist, who now stands at the brink of age 40, first made a dent in the public consciousness by taking a silver medal at the 1966 Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow and quickly established a reputation as a virtuoso for whom nothing was too difficult. Along with his ability to burn up the keyboard in the big, flashy pieces, he also showed an inclination to play the classical literature with patrician poise. For nearly 20 years, Mr. Dichter has played with just this blend of technical brilliance and stylistic elegance, content to refine his achievements rather than to rush off in new directions.",1984-05-02T05:00:00+0000

Then, because of the sculpture's size and weight - it's more than 11 feet long and 8 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds - David J. Nash, Sotheby's director of fine arts, decided it should remain out front until it is auctioned May 15. Mr. Nash had Sotheby's carpenters build a wedge-shape base so that the figure is level on the sloping sidewalk.

But then the audience ratings came in and ''V'' turned out to be the highest- rated NBC mini-series of the year. Obviously, the idea for some sort of continuation would be pursued.

us,"AFTER A MONTH OF HINTS, PARTICIPATION BECOMES 'IMPOSSIBLE'","A series of charges and countercharges preceded the Soviet decision yesterday not to participate in the Los Angeles Olympics. Here is a chronology: April 7. Peter V. Ueberroth, head of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, tells a meeting of United States Olympic Committee delegates that ''if they didn't come it would make the Games smaller and lessen their importance.'' April 9. The Soviet National Olympic Committee, listing complaints previously voiced, requests a special session of the International Olympic Committee and ''demands that the United States side strictly respect the Olympic Charter and take effective measures to guarantee proper security.'' The Russians charge that ''the U.S. Administration is trying to use the Olympic Games on the eve of the elections for its selfish political aims.'' Mr. Ueberroth denies that the charter has been violated, and an Administration official counters by saying that ''the Soviet line toward the Olympics is consistent with the very tough anti-Administration position taken by the Kremlin.'' April 10. A source close to top Soviet sports authorities says the Soviet Union has no intention of not talking part in the Olympics. ''Our argument is with the U.S. Government and the I.O.C.,'' he says, ''not with the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee.'' April 11. Tass, the official Soviet press agency, points to the granting of press credentials to Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty as an effort ''to bring the spirit of psychological war and ideological subversion to the world Olympic movement.''",1984-05-09T05:00:00+0000

Indeed, we should use this election as an occasion to pursue that goal by linking future aid to our best assessDavid Joel Steinberg is the author of ''The Philippines: A Singular and a Plural Place.'' ment of the fairness of this vote. Until the death of Benigno S. Aquino Jr., last Aug. 21, the Reagan Administration and, to a lesser extent, Congress supported President Ferdinand E. Marcos because he was a stable ally and because America wanted to retain the air base at Clark Field and the naval station at Subic Bay. Meanwhile, the restoration of democracy was slighted. Now, Mr. Aquino's martyrdom and Mr. Marcos's ill health have created the worst instability since independence in 1946 and require a policy reappraisal by the United States. Why should we be concerned about democracy in the Philippines? Eighty-five years ago, Americans conquered the Philippines and imposed their will on a mature nationalist movement. We justified our imperialism as altruism, creating a colonial government that was meant to dissolve itself, evolving in time into independence. The Philippines was to be ''a showcase of democracy'' by which the world could judge the efficacy of the American way.",1984-05-09T05:00:00+0000

Mike Bossy (RW, 6-0, 185, 51-67 - 118)For the seventh consecutive season, he finished with better than 50 goals. After a slow start in the playoffs, he collected three of the four game-winning goals against Montreal in the semifinals and is one goal shy of tying Jean Beliveau's career high of 82 playoff goals. He scored 17 last year, best in the playoffs, but only 2 against the Oilers. Bryan Trottier (C, 5-11, 195, 40-71 - 111)Few forwards or defensemen can match his body-checking and his play without the puck. After averaging better than 17 assists in each of the four previous cup years, he has aided on only six goals. His 47 penalty minutes mirror some of his frustration. John Tonelli (LW, 6-1, 197, 27-40 - 67)He has missed four playoff games because of a shoulder injury, but his one goal was the key to overcoming the Rangers in game 4 of the first round. Greg Gilbert (LW, 22, 6-1, 194, 31-35 - 66)He played only one game in last year's playoffs and has not missed one this year. Spent most of the season on the Trottier-Bossy line and scored on more than 25 percent of his shots, best among Islander forwards. Bob Bourne (LW-C, 6-3, 202, 22-34 - 56)His point production was his second highest in eight years, though he spent much time at center rather than left wing, the position he prefers.

us,No Headline,"Among the friends of Walter F. Mondale, nothing arouses as much anxiety as the suggestion that the former Vice President can do everything required of a Presidential nominee except expand his appeal outside hardcore Democrats. Mr. Mondale had just about laid the ''electability'' question to rest by making the most significant comeback from an early reversal by any recent Democratic candidate. Last week, by narrowly losing the Ohio and Indiana primaries to Gary Hart, he gave new life to the old doubts just as he gave new life to Mr. Hart's candidacy. Few Historical Guideposts Moreover, the nomination battle has now entered territory for which there are few historical guideposts. The anomaly is that the Colorado Senator now has a longshot chance at the nomination, even though it is almost a numerical impossibility for him to overtake Mr. Mondale's lead in the delegate count. Of the 1,967 delegate votes needed to nominate, Mr. Mondale's tally last week, according to United Press International, was 1,518, and Mr. Hart's, 886; 829 remain to be selected. Among party leaders, there was grumbling that Mr. Mondale had blown an opportunity to cinch the nomination by falling victim to his old nemeses, caution and overconfidence. He was particularly faulted for campaigning down to the wire in Texas, leaving Ohio to Mr. Hart for a couple of days. ''We made a series of decisions that with 20/20 hindsight we might not have made,'' said James A. Johnson, the Mondale campaign chairman.",1984-05-13T05:00:00+0000

Michelangelo tucked up under the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel may well have been a remarkable sight. To see Jackson Pollock pour paint on canvas, as happens in Hans Namuth's famous documentary movie, is to understand him better. But in the case of almost every other artist, from Giotto down to our own day, there was in theatrical terms no action at all. One man with a sketchbook on his knee is much like another. Great art is not made with histrionic gestures. It is made slowly and in silence with movements of the hand and arm that are more likely to remind us of a watchmaker than of an orchestra conductor at grips with Mahler's Eighth.

There are 12 men who have spent more than 7 months together in pursuit of a goal - the National Basketball Association title. They have sweated, run, lived and traveled together. They have high-fived together after victories, and sulked together after losses. They have also competed against one another. That competition is over for the Nets. They survived the pitfalls of uncertainty and jealousy that haunted them during the regular season, attaining playoff success by eliminating the defending-champion Philadelphia 76ers in the opening round before losing to the veteran Milwaukee Bucks, four games to two, in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Yet, despite the success, there was again an uncomfortable air as the Nets emptied their lockers at Byrne Meadowlands Arena on Friday afternoon, and said goodbye to one another. Was it goodbye for the summer, or for good? ''I always like to get out of there quickly,'' said Buck Williams, who hurried for an appointment. ''I don't know if I'll play with some of these guys again. I know that's the way it always is, but it's still a funny feeling.'' Despite the stability that Coach Stan Albeck brought to a franchise previously wrought with change, it was clear that some changes would have to be made if the Nets were to carry their postseason success through season. Even Otis Birdsong, the guard who returned to his all-star form with his best season as a Net, admitted that it would be a critical summer for the franchise.",1984-05-13T05:00:00+0000

(Atlantic/ Little Brown, $7.95.)","''My book is about the constant endless collusion between good and evil; I believe that human beings are capable of total evil, but no one has ever been totally good: and this gives the edge to evil.'' Thus wrote Katherine Anne Porter about her first and last full-length novel, written over a period of 20 years and published in 1962 when she was 71. Basing the work on a 15th-century moral allegory, the distinguished short story writer drew on her impressions of her first trans-Atlantic voyage in the early 1930's for an analogy with our own times. Though it provoked controversy among the critics, the novel had the full approval of our reviewer, Mark Schorer: ''Her perfectly poised ironical intelligence is constant and in complete authority. . . . As in any great work of art, something larger is in the air and we know we are in another ship as well, another voyage, sailing to another harbor.''",1984-05-13T05:00:00+0000

Even after Walter F. Mondale lost Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday, the labor political director, John Perkins, consoled himself that union voters stayed with the former Vice President by a comfortable margin. The feeling was that union members have by and large delivered for the labor federation's candidate. But one group of union members has not. According to New York Times/CBS News exit polls, black union members have overwhelmingly voted for the Rev. Jesse Jackson. In Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, and now Ohio - union strongholds all - they, like blacks at large, have turned out for Mr. Jackson. In so doing, they have aligned themselves with a candidate who has on occasion poked fun at the organized labor establishment. In a favorite Jackson metaphor, labor is one of the institutional ''old wine skins'' that should be making room for ''new wine.'' He has faulted unions for being slow to pute blacks into leadership positions, saying, ''A black or a woman will clearly be President of this country before one will even be able to run for head of the A.F.L.- C.I.O.'' He has charged that when unions control the gateway to employment - as they do in the building trades, where employers commonly muster their manpower at the union hall for each project - they have protected white workers at the expense of young blacks entering the workforce.",1984-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,No Headline,"The downfall of Russia's Czar Nicholas, the Bolshevik takeover and all the murky, bloody doings in that corner of history are, and probably will remain, as irresistible to novelists as catnip to cats. Duncan Kyle, a British practitioner of the suspense genre, has peeked once again into that corner with convoluted but engaging results. Although the novel is set in the present, it revolves around a plot initiated in 1917 by Britain's King George V and the nefarious Sir Basil Zaharoff to rescue Czar Nicholas from the hands of the Bolsheviks. For their purpose they employed an English naval officer, whose background made him as fluent in Russian as he was in English, to offer $:50-million to the harried Bolsheviks to save the Czar. Mr. Kyle's tale alternates between the details of this plot (revealed through excerpts from the memoirs of the naval officer) and current events in the English banking house that is still paying out $:50,000 a year to an account in a Swiss bank, with no questions asked. This sum has been paid out since 1920 even though Sir Basil died in 1936. The British bank executives, in their inimitable way, have never questioned the practice, but a new American partner does question it and thereby sets into motion events that have been lying dormant for almost 50 years. The mission to Moscow, the Czar's immense gold treasure, the intrigues and passions surrounding the capture of the royal family, and the devilishly clever ruse the English naval officer uses to get both revenge and a final airing of his story are all revealed in rococo detail.",1984-05-20T05:00:00+0000

Some weeks, Vice President George Bush barely seems to have time to refuel, never mind slumber, as he returns from another Presidential mission overseas and flies back out onto the domestic political circuit, where he has raised more than $35 million for the Republican Party. Mr. Bush was scheduled to come home today from such a visit, this time a five-nation tour of the Far East. By the four-year clock that still drives his metabolism, the day could be remembered as the fourth anniversary of the last 1980 primary in which he clearly defeated Ronald Reagan, 57 percent to 32 percent in Michigan. That may seem trivial now, but it wasn't easy for Mr. Bush to concede then that Mr. Reagan was unstoppable. He did so, however. Mr. Bush invited his delegates to turn to his rival and thus spared his party a nasty California primary. George Bush hasn't looked back since then. His strategy in the matter stands in sharp contrast to the current one of Gary Hart, who has launched a last- mile challenge of Walter F. Mondale this year. ''I would have remained an asterisk,'' Mr. Bush says now. Instead, he enjoys his job and a relationship with Mr. Reagan that has evolved as such a model of personal loyalty that the President chose to scotch all talk of a ''dump Bush'' movement among conservative party members early last year.",1984-05-20T05:00:00+0000

Mornings she attended classes at the University of Massachusetts; afternoons she worked as a stripper and bar girl. ''Naked Is the Best Disguise'' is the harrowing cautionary tale of her sojourn in the often violent netherworld of Boston's Combat Zone, where as ''Lolita'' she stripped out of a little-girl costume, using a doll as her prop. Why would a young woman with, presumably, other options choose this way to make a living? Her stated reasons - not enough money from her estranged family, boredom with office and restaurant jobs and fierce sexual competition with her older sister, who was also a stripper - seem too simple. Miss Lewin also alludes to, but unfortunately never expands on, a ''need to put myself in the most hostile environment and wage a struggle for survival there.'' Initially, at least, stripping seemed to offer an affirmation, however crude, of her sexual power and desirability. But the illusion of glamour was harder to sustain while hustling drinks. As time went on, Miss Lewin, who was turning into a feminist, became dependent on cocaine so Lolita could do her job. Ultimately, as the strain of her double life became unbearable and her cocaine habit threatened to get out of control, she pulled back from the abyss. Some of Miss Lewin's feminist insights seem to have been slapped on after the fact, and they have a flattening effect on her narrative.",1984-05-20T05:00:00+0000

us,DEATH IN CYPRUS.IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. THE KING'S COMMISSAR.,"By Fanny Howe. (Fic tion Collective, $12.95.) Set in ''Ashville,'' a small town between Providence and Boston, this ambitious, sad little novel describes the temporary conjunction of four rootless lives. After the rector of the local Episcopalian church commits suicide, Lachlan St. George, a young minister from a prosperous Boston family, arrives as a replacement. He quickly meets the other actors in this quiet drama - the sweet-voiced teen-aged soloist of the church choir, an itinerant auto mechanic and a divorced, college-educated mother living on welfare. All of them are unsure of their desires, unfocused in their ambitions. Born elsewhere, they feel unwelcome in the closed society of the old New England town. As they fumble in their attempts to find solace in love - and direction for their lives - their frustration deepens and becomes volatile. Eventually, one dies an unrecognized martyr's death; two flee south. And St. George, the only one of the four initially convinced of his faith's sturdiness and support, discovers that he, after all, is lost. In the unsettled world of America's middle class, as Fanny Howe protrays it, the unfulfilled promises of 1960's progressive politics, the ''liberation'' of women and the equivocal ''I'm-O.K.-you're-O.K.'' position of the clergy have created a confusion of values and expectations. Her characters suffer acutely from the absence of new systems of guidance and reassurance to replace traditional social structures, and their uncertainty has fatal consequences. Unfortunately, Mrs. Howe stylizes her story with irregularities of format and punctuation that must be intended to evoke in her readers feelings of dislocation comparable to those suffered by her characters.",1984-05-20T05:00:00+0000

us,"UNFORTUNATELY FOR MANY OF US, WE ARE WHAT WE EAT","R ECENT research on cholesterol confirms what has long been suspected: one way to heart disease is through the stomach. That is unfortunate news for many Americans. Although consumption of cholesterol-rich butter and eggs has dropped in the more than 20 years since the American Heart Association sounded a dietary alarm, the typical American still consumes 450 milligrams of cholesterol each day and gets 40 percent of his calories from fats, nearly half of which are saturated fats that boost blood cholesterol even higher. Last week, the association unveiled an aggressive plan to help steer Americans away from red meat, cheese and whole milk and toward poultry, fish, vegetables and grains. The three-step approach starts with a ''prudent diet'' limiting fat to 30 percent of daily calories, no more than a third of it saturated, and cholesterol to 300 milligrams a day. It ends with a regimen of 20 percent fat and just 100 to 150 milligrams of cholesterol. Though designed for people in the top 5 percent in cholesterol levels - for men and women in their early 40's, 260 milligrams per deciliter of blood or higher - the association said the plan would benefit all those above the national mean of 210, the point at which coronary risk rises sharply. But there is still debate about how much cholesterol is too much, and what the best way is to cut down on it. Dr. W. Virgil Brown of New York's Mount Sinai Medical Center, chairman of the heart association's nutrition committee, Dr. William E. Connor of the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland and Nathan Pritikin, founder and director of the Longevity Centers, recently discussed these issues at a symposium at Mount Sinai.",1984-05-20T05:00:00+0000

In fact, other than Government officials, Mr. Rather is at the top of the list. When the influential Americans rated other influential Americans, the first nine people they chose, beginning with Ronald Reagan, were elected or appointed office holders. Mr. Rather was No. 10. This was one place in front of Walter Mondale, seven ahead of Vice President Bush, and a full 19 in front of Henry Kissinger. The same survey in 1982 placed Mr. Rather 19th, while the one last year put him 12th. Apparently, he is growing in influence, or at least in the perception of having influence, and while the significance of this is uncertain, one thing is clear: Mr. Rather is not someone who just gets up and reads the news.",1984-05-27T05:00:00+0000

The problem in staging a revival is to find a tone that's racy in contemporary terms yet faithful in spirit to a frothy score that includes ''Falling in Love With Love,'' ''This Can't Be Love'' and ''Sing for Your Supper.''",1984-05-30T05:00:00+0000
