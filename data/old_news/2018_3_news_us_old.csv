With seemingly infinite skyscrapers nearly blocking out the sun (when its famously overcast skies dont do it first), visitors dont always take to the city instantly. But its treasures lie below the surface: world-class restaurants, Brazil-class music and an ever-ebullient arts scene, from alternative theaters to sparkling new museums. And though Paulistanos are often stereotyped as harried and overworked, thats only compared to other Brazilians; compared to most megacity dwellers they are downright easygoing. Meanwhile, theres ever more  to see, as the slow-cooker of progress  or is it gentrification?  regenerates the once-abandoned historic center, block by block. But downtown is still no hipster paradise. Its as vibrant and culturally alive as it is gritty and pickpockety, enough so that many wealthy residents stick to greener, wealthier areas.

Eight are based on comic books; two more are based on existing properties; one is the long-running stalwart Supernatural and another is a likely-to-be-canceled military drama. Then there are the two quirky, critical beloved genre-benders: Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, a dark-comedy musical, and Jane the Virgin, a sudsy but deeply sincere telenovela. Which brings us to Life Sentence, starting Wednesday, neither superhero nor supernatural nor super bold.

Its also unmoored, though, without a clear anchor or companion, putting the show in the unenviable position of having to stand on its own right from the start. Its enough to crush a mightier, meatier show. But then, Life Sentence is all about surprise survival.",2018-03-06T18:59:41+0000

There is a notable drive toward streamlining, with fewer galleries this year  a total of 198 from 31 countries at Piers 92/94, the contiguous exhibition space. The timeline is being tightened, as well, to create less of a divide between the past and the present, between post-World War II art (usually found on the sleepier Pier 92) and newer work.

Brands as diverse as Vetements, MarquesAlmeida and The Row continually mine his archive for inspiration. The conceptual Belgian designer is being celebrated in two separate exhibitions in Paris this month: a retrospective at the Palais Galliera, which examines his career until he retired in 2009, and another at the Muse des Arts Dcoratifs, which premiered in Antwerp last year and catalogs his six-year tenure designing for Herms.

This season, the Paris-based designer is broadening his offering in a far less expected way: He is launching a community outreach program alongside his fall/winter 2018 collection. Association Ribeyron is a project inspired by the multicultural Paris neighborhood of Couronnes, where Ribeyron has his studio. Its mission, the designer says, is to strengthen relationships between the areas diverse communities through local events like open-invitation lunches in the neighborhoods squares. The idea is just to do something positive for the people around, and those who are often forgotten, Ribeyron told T. The initiative will be funded by a percentage of sales from the brands fall/winter 2018 collection, when it hits SSENSE in July. The pieces  which range from a pink tie-dye T-shirt to a collection of oversize blazers in warm earth tones were similarly inspired by dreams of small-town living. I found myself a bit lost in this workload, so I made time to revisit memories in which my mom and I would go to New Hampshire in the summer and pass by these little villages surrounded by nature, explains Ribeyron, who grew up in Canada.

During its reign, his namesake shop-cum-gallery in SoHo, which opened in 1994 and closed in 2012, defined avant-garde good taste. Moss blurred the lines between art and design and reinvented visual merchandising, displaying everything from an 18th-century Nymphenburg figurine to a kaleidoscopic array of Maarten Baas Clay chairs inside massive vitrines within the immaculate white space. After almost 50 years in Manhattan, the 68-year-old, who now runs his own design and retail consulting firm, moved to a traditional clapboard house in Connecticut last year with his partner in life and business, Franklin Getchell, with whom he has also co-authored a new Rizzoli book, out this April, documenting the cultural influence of the Moss store. But to this day, Moss still considers his childhood growing up in the suburbs of 60s Chicago to be his most formative period. When his father insisted on installing electric hand-dryers and Borax soap dispensers in the bathrooms of their home, his mother agreed, provided their decorator could enamel them in pink and turquoise pastels. To me, that epitomized what Modernism should be, Moss says. Ive been fascinated by the juxtaposition of the industrial and the decorative ever since.",2018-03-13T14:07:09+0000

About a year and a half ago, he said, the operators of the Holiday Inn in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, came to him about opening a restaurant in the hotel. He pitched the name, Brasserie Seoul, and some ideas for a menu of French fare with Korean touches that expanded on what he was serving at his Bistro Petit in Williamsburg. But thats as far as it went; he never cooked at Brasserie Seoul. And despite the name he suggested, the restaurant served what he called ordinary K-Town food like the bibimbap found all over West 32nd Street. Now, a new group runs the hotel, and he was approached again. They asked if I believed in fate, said the veteran chef, who is 47. And they gave me a chance to do my brainchild, my dream. His menu features French techniques with Korean ingredients, reflecting his background and his years in the kitchens of chefs like Wayne Nish, Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Laurent Tourondel. His kimchi bouillabaisse is based on a South Korean fish stew, and his Korean beef bourguignon is similar to the long, slow French braise. Cod comes crusted with fermented black beans, and several dishes are fueled with his homemade kimchi. The spacious dining room is centered on the bar and has a profusion of greenery.

Gordon was 16 when she first saw Jackson onstage, in the 1965 Broadway production of Marat/Sade, a philosophical investigation of the meaning of protest set during and after the French Revolution. In the 70s, Gordon, now 68, graduated from college to a life in letters, and she memorized lines from Sunday Bloody Sunday, a 1971 film directed by John Schlesinger and starring Jackson as Alex, a woman competing with a doctor, played by Peter Finch, for the love of a young male sculptor and coming to terms with free love. As Gordons novels and nonfiction  including an important 1978 essay on abortion rights published in the New York Review of Books  won her increasing acclaim, she watched Jackson, now a two-time Oscar winner, make a turn to a surprising second career as a liberal member of Parliament beginning in 1992. Finally, and just as surprisingly, Jackson returned to acting. Just after turning 80 two years ago, she won raves in London as a gender-blind King Lear. This spring brings Jackson back to Broadway, starring in the revival of Edward Albees 1991 play Three Tall Women, which opens March 29, about a woman recalling her lifes great triumphs and regrets. One morning in January in Manhattan, Gordon finally met her idol for a long conversation, which covered poetry, film and theater, but most significantly the state of feminism today.",2018-03-21T19:51:27+0000

us,The Brass Section Is at the Bar,"There was once a chain of New York restaurants called Brass Rail. But at several new restaurants, the richly glowing golden metal is on the surface of the bar, not just the foot rail. Brass is nudging aside zinc, the traditional metal for bar tops. At Legacy Records near Hudson Yards, the main curved bar and a utility bar are both covered in burnished brass. Robert Bohr, an owner, said he wanted it for warmth and for how well it complemented the midcentury style of the restaurant, designed by Ken Fulk. At Harrys, a venerable steakhouse on Hanover Square that was recently redecorated for about $1 million by Antonio Tadrissi of PDLab in Toronto, the 36-foot bar is covered in brass. Brass ages beautifully and gracefully, just like Harry, Mr. Tadrissi said, referring to Harry Poulakakos, the founder of the 46-year-old restaurant, which is now owned by his son, Peter Poulakakos. At Brasserie Seoul in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, brass is the focus on a bar in the center of the room. Youll also see brass in accents, like the trim throughout the new Simon & the Whale in Gramercy. And its not just a New York trend. Henriettas at the Dewberry in Charleston, S.C., is another room with brass on the bar.",2018-03-26T16:28:43+0000

Coco Pazzo, which opened in 1988 and was forced to close 10 years ago, proved that his Tuscan approach could work with white tablecloths on the Upper East Side. Now with his business partner, Alessandro Bandini, he is opening another Coco Pazzo, in SoHo, in a brightly windowed contemporary take on that Tuscan farmhouse. And he is serving some pasta entrees that he calls piatti unici; they include linguine with clam rag, with clams oreganata alongside; and pappardelle with stracotto braised brisket, the pot roast sharing the plate with pasta dressed in its sauce. Mr. Luongos longtime collaborator, the chef Marta Pulini, is a consultant. By day, the restaurant is Coco Pazzo Kitchen, mainly for salads, sandwiches and pasta. In the evening, it becomes Coco Pazzo Trattoria, offering soups, salads, seafood antipasti, his piatti unici, and main courses meant for sharing like whole roast chicken or a 24-ounce grilled rib-eye. In the rear of the restaurant is a small shop selling food to take out: 160 Prince Street (Thompson Street), 917-261-6321, cocopazzonyc.com. ",2018-03-27T16:59:13+0000

us,Can a Building Message Board Be an Open Forum?,"Q: I live in a large Upper West Side co-op with a BuildingLink online message board. Management approves all posts, without providing guidelines on what might be approved or rejected. This is a private bulletin board, and I dont expect complete freedom of speech. Still, it feels like anything more than an innocuous for sale announcement gets blocked. The moderators have rejected posts about an Upper West Side school rezoning debate; a post questioning what materials would be used for building improvements; and a post from a shareholder asking about a Paris apartment exchange. Should we have a stated policy? Is management being too controlling or is this normal oversight? Can shareholders request that questions not be subject to management approval?",2018-03-31T14:00:04+0000
