Now consider Neil Simon, who also dredges around his past. He exorcises old ghosts; sometimes he wrestles with demons, but for him they come out funny. For him they make us laugh. Him we define by the calcium deposit in his neck. It is an accretion built up by sitting hunched up over a typewriter, five hours a day for 30 years. Is this fair? Is this just?

Soon, more than 1,500 Cuban exiles - secretly trained, armed and directed by the United States Central Intelligence Agency - were moving along the Giron and Larga beaches on the Bay of Pigs. The C.I.A. had assumed that the people of Cuba would rise up against Fidel Castro the moment the exile brigade hit the beaches. In fact, they did nothing of the sort. Within 72 hours, the ships were sunk by a handful of Castro's all-but-obsolete aircraft and the members of the brigade captured or killed.

The variation outlined here is not only delicious, but also keeps well when wrapped in aluminum foil and kept airtight. The preparation of this panettone is slightly intricate, so on this page are step-by-step photographs showing how to go about it.",1981-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,A MASTERPIECE OF MODERN DANCE,"Vaslav Nijinsky's scandalous 1913 production in Paris of Igor Stravinsky's ''Le Sacre du Printemps'' signaled the beginning of dance as a modern art. In 1980, the American modern-dance choreographer Paul Taylor offered his own ''Le Sacre du Printemps (The Rehearsal)'' on Broadway, producing a very different kind of surprise. Taylor took the legendary avant-garde ballet and reduced it to a baffling, cartoon detective story about a young woman whose baby has been kidnapped by Chinatown thugs; intermingled are scenes of a dance rehearsal overseen by a grim Russian ballet mistress. ''The most talked-about dance work in recent years,'' as Anna Kisselgoff of The Times called it, will be repeated during the Paul Taylor Dance Company's three-week appearance at the New York City Center, opening April 14. For all its comic exuberance, Taylor's rites of spring neveretheless end on a disturbing note: the detective, the crooks and the police - even the baby (a doll) - become the victims of a methodical, silent-movie massacre. The corpses revive for a final dance rehearsal. Is this a demonic celebration of American violence or a final apotheosis of the dancer's art?",1981-04-05T05:00:00+0000

A die-hard Yankee fan must be forgiven if his baseball thoughts are virtually totally Yankee thoughts. Herewith are offered 50 thoughts of what a super Yankee fan of a certain age would like to see (or hear) for the first time or again. Readers must realize that nostalgic thoughts of past Yankee glories are fairly sacred to a pinstripe worshipper, and those not so afflicted are asked to offer rebuttal at their own risk. 1. A doubleheader with the St. Louis Browns or Washington Senators; such unabashed pleasure was surely a perversion, a sin. 2. Mel Allen broadcasting an inning of a Yankee-Red Sox game, or a whole Yankee-Red Sox game, or a whole season for that matter. How about that? 3. Mickey Mantle batting right-handed with the bases loaded. Was Hornsby really a better hitter than Mantle batting right-handed? 4. Yogi Berri jumping on Vic Raschi or Allie Reynolds or Don Larsen after a World Series game victory. 5. Eddie Lopat staring at Bill Veeck's black cats in Cleveland's Municipal Stadium - and then pitching a shutout against the Indians. 6. The Yankees' winning five consecutive World Series. 7. Phil Rizzuto making only 14 errors in a full season playing on natural turf in every park, and wearing a glove only as big as - a glove. 8. Only 14 night games (Tuesdays and Fridays) with the first one not until the middle of May, and Sunday doubleheaders to spend six hours or more at Yankee Stadium. 9.",1981-04-05T05:00:00+0000

IT'S A MYSTERY","BALDWIN In this era of big-budget films, when a price tag of $10 million is considered modest, ""The Way Some People Die,"" the current Carl Henry 3rd production, can hardly be called ""typical."" It cost a mere $10,000. But then, Mr. Henry, who prefers just plain Carl Henry for his credits as an actor, director and scenario writer, is not too typical, either. Two years ago, when he started the 60-minute mystery that will be given its premiere at the library here, he was only 19 years old. His collaborator, Rich Carter, was 17. When Mr. Henry and Mr. Carter dedided to transfer Ross McDonald's detective novel to film, they had already created ""Chandler,"" a spoof they filmed in junior high school, and a 20-minute interview with Chuck Scarborough, the WNBC-TV newsman, that won a media contest in high school. Mr. Henry is a video engineer at NBC. When not attending the New York Institute of Technology, Mr. Carter is a cameraman at ABC. ""The Way Some People Die"" was to be their audition film, so to speak, that, according to Mr. Henry, they would show friends and acquaintances at their networks with an eye to getting a foothold on the creative end of the business. ""I've wanted to make movies ever since I was 10,"" Mr. Henry said. ""It was just a coincidence that I was born into a show-business-type family.""

''Few workers go straight to wax, clay, plaster of stone without setting down their initial thoughts in brush, pencil, pen or crayon. So most sculptors first see the form that they will follow initiated on the page.'' Obviously, there is a freedom and velocity of expression to be found in drawing that can never be entirely equalled in the more protracted and inhibiting labors required for the realization of a sculpture. To a drawing an artist is free to confide every sort of flight or fancy of the imagination as well as corrections, afterthoughts and idle notations. In order to carve or model or construct a three-dimensional object in real space, however, the sculpture is obliged to submit the cherished spontaneity and inspired improvisations of drawing to the very different - and more slowly realized - disciplines imposed upon him by the nature of his sculptural materials and the technical challenges they entail.",1981-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Special Shuttle Issue; VOYAGE OF THE SPACESHIP COLUMBIA: AN OVERVIEW OF THE SHUTTLE'S MAIDEN FLIGHT,"MILITARY SIGNIFICANCE Many Defense Department analysts and military strategists, who will be keenly watching the first shuttle flight, believe the re-usable spacecraft will give the nation military superiority in space, especially strengthening its position with respect to the Soviet Union. Futuristic military scenarios for the shuttle include its use in the construction of manned orbital posts for vehicles that can warn of missile attacks; it might also be used in the assembly of unmanned space stations armed with lasers and other sophisticated weapons. The space shuttle would carry satellites into orbit for various purposes, including reconnaissance and navigation. An apparatus known as the ''inertial upper stage'' would be used to boost many satellites to a ''geosynchronous'' or stationary, orbit, 22,300 miles above Earth. Military use of the shuttle is advocated by a civilian group, the Alliance for Peace Through Strength, headed by Daniel O. Graham, a retired general, and a Congressional group headed by Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming. There is opposition from some scientists and academics, many of whom fear an arms race in space. Indeed, many opponents, including Dr. James Van Allen of the University of Iowa and Dr. Eric Chaisson of Harvard University, fear the shuttle will be mainly used as a weapon. Last year, Harold R. Brown, then Secretary of Defense, told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that the space shuttle was essential to the nation's future military planning. The shuttle's military potential contributed to President Carter's decision to increase its funding.",1981-04-07T05:00:00+0000

The novelist's condition is conveyed in agonizing and evocative detail: He toys endlessly with his new manuscript, fondles his fountain pen, buys a new chair, pursues women at cafes, takes on a degrading ghostwriting assignment, and finally - by his childish petulance and self-indulgence -leaves his wife no choice but to kick him out.

To the Greeks, hubris was not the audience's response to dramatic heroes, as Professor Ogilvie suggests, but rather the tragic character's own impiously lofty conception of himself as godlike. Indeed, Greek tragedy was a kind of cautionary tale for the demos, whose responses, according to Aristotle, were pity and fear, and not as Professor Ogilvie seems to imply, the hubris of vindictive rage.",1981-04-12T05:00:00+0000

Academics and businessmen for the most part, they are dissenters from what some call the ''liberal orthodoxy'' of established civil rights leaders. In many respects, their views coincide with Ronald Reagan's and they are likely to be heard from in coming months on issues such as tax credits for private school tuition, a proposal that gained support last week from a new study by Dr. James S. Coleman, the sociologist, who concluded that private high schools provide a better education than public schools. To explore the ideas of the black conservatives and how they contrast with those of the traditional black leadership, Don Wycliff, an editor of The Week in Review, interviewed separately Dr. Walter E. Williams, a professor of economics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and a leading exponent of black conservative views, and Benjamin L.

As usual in any major news story, from assassination plots to moon landings to returning hostages, television became a significant part of the event itself. On a fairly quiet Monday afternoon, ABC was the first to telephone my office about the attempt on Ronald Reagan's life, naturally anxious to announce that it had beat its network competitors to the air. Television had begun its peculiar job of informing and reassuring, of startling and lulling.

History, however, has cast him in a more exacting and perilous role, and recent events thrust him center stage. On the night of Feb. 23, with the Government and Parliament held hostage by a band of rebel Civil Guards, Juan Carlos I almost single-handedly halted a surprise golpe de estado, a coup against the state, its aim nothing less than reimposing the reactionary conditions that existed under the late Francisco Franco and the destruction of the frail democracy instituted by his successor, Juan Carlos, to insure the survival of the restored Bourbon* dynasty.",1981-04-12T05:00:00+0000

However, these items are items of tax preference for purposes of Federal alternative minimum tax (Internal Revenue Code Section 55). Therefore, since adjusted itemized deductions and capital gains are defined as items of tax preference for Federal purposes, they are items of tax preference for New York minimum income tax purposes in accordance with the New York Tax Law.

Hats Come Back Not many women want an elaborate Easter hat these days. Still, hats are fun and young women, rather than dowagers, have taken them up. Two knitwear designers, Sofia Okolwicz and Anne Stillman, both barely in their 30's, believe in the hat's comeback and have made a group of hand-crocheted styles under their Sofia and Anne label. The styles are classic, but not dull; the designers have added ribbon bands, or crocheted berries or cockades to perk them up. They're in various stores around town; the sailor hat shown is $56 at Betsey, Bunky and Nini, 746 Madison Avenue (between 64th and 65th Streets).",1981-04-15T05:00:00+0000

If they did this in New York State, however, they are probably legally married. That is so because in New York State if a couple is married by someone who is in fact a clergy person authorized to perform marriages, the fact that there is no signing of papers, or even the fact that there was no marriage license at all, does not mean that a valid marriage fails to come into effect.

The restriction was set in January 1980 by President Carter in retaliation for the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. The official said lifting the embargo would make good a campaign promise to American farmers, and would reflect the easing of Soviet pressure on Poland. (Page A1, Columns 3-4.) Israel is a greater threat to Saudi Arabia than the Soviet Union, the Saudi Minister of Petroleum, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, said in a speech to the Foreign Policy Association in New York. He said that his country faced two threats: international Communism and Israel, and that the first reinforced ties with the United States but the second was ''a threat to that friendship.''

Results that would be recognized as musical outside the parochial borders of the electronic community have been extremely skimpy. And musical skimpiness characterized the performance of Salvatore Martirano last night at the Cooper Union, where he improvised for 50 minutes on his Sal-Mar Construction, as he calls the electronic instrument that he and others at the University of Illinois have been building since the late 60's. Mr. Martirano claims that the instrument, which resembles a doomsday machine out of a NASA technician's fantasy or something a boy might dream after consuming too many issues of Popular Electronics, is ""the world's first electronic sound generating composing machine."" It embodies computers as well as synthesizing equipment, a pairing that allows the performer to improvise in ""real time""-that is, on the spot, without tape-in tandem with the automated sounds previously programmed into the machine. It is designed to produce more complex textures than are available on ordinary music synthesizers and to permit, in theory, an ""interaction"" between performer and machine. There are 291 touch-sensitive switches, functioning as input devices, and 24 speakers that hang about the hall to to spread the output. A television monitor, apparently conveying some visual messages that could not be made out from the audience, sat on a chair beside the instrument.",1981-04-24T05:00:00+0000

As amended in 1974, the law placed limits on the amount of money individuals and organizations could contribute to Presidential and Congressional candidates. On the ground that the amended law violated free-speech rights, a consortium of plaintiffs that included liberals and conservatives brought suit. The Supreme Court, in a 1976 ruling, let stand the principal of public financing combined with limits on direct contributions. However, it struck down limits on outside expenditures by individuals or organizations on the ground that these restricted free speech. In allowing rich individuals to spend more money to influence elections, it confirmed the essential inferiority of the citizen of modest means in the exercise of one of his most fundamental rights. Short of becoming rich himself, he could never hope to equal the amount of free speech enjoyed by the well-to-do.",1981-04-25T05:00:00+0000

The President's decision, which was announced to the Cabinet in a closed session, also had the effect of lifting President Carter's ban on shipments of phosphate fertilizers to the Soviet Union. (Page 1, Column 6.) The Soviet Union was accused of being ''the greatest source of international insecurity'' by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. in his first public speech since taking office. In outlining the philosophy behind the Reagan Administration's ''new direction'' in foreign policy, Mr. Haig said, ''Let us be plain about it: Soviet promotion of violence as the instrument of change constitutes the greatest danger to the world.''

In 1978, it disinterred ''Don Juan Comes Back From the War'' by the Hungarian dramatist Odon Horvath, a play that transformed the sexual predator into a repentant army veteran, anxious only to rediscover and propitiate the girl he had long ago seduced and abandoned. Earlier this year, the National revived Bernard Shaw's ''Man and Superman,'' complete with the rarely performed dream-debate ''Don Juan in Hell,'' which takes mythological revisionism still further.

us,COLLECTING ON A GRAND SCALE,"There is a very good reason why architecture has never been thrown under the umbrella of that currenly trendy term ""collectibles"": It is no simple matter to collect architecture in the way that one collects bottles or seashells or even Rembrandts. Buildings do not fit very easily into cases or onto shelves, and they cannot be stacked up in garages or basements. Lovers of architecture who have been bitten by the collecting urge thus tend to seek solace in substitutes - in gathering architectural drawings a pastime that has become so fashionable in recent years that it has led to the opening of galleries specializing in the marketing of architects' sketches; in acquiring architectural models, something not as popular as architectural drawings but clearly on the rise; or in collecting architecture books, prints and folios, probably the oldest type of architectural collecting of all. But there have always been a few determined souls who have managed against all odds, to collect real buildings. It is a sport that takes as much money as polo and probably a great more commitment. Buildings cannot be found through a regular, reliable dealer, as prints or toy turtles can, and the buildings a collector may want to collect are not very likely to be found in one convenient location. A building collector must be willing to travel, then, and he or she must also be willing to spend a lot of money, not only to acquire--or to commission--his or her collection, but to keep it up.",1981-04-26T05:00:00+0000

Both men were roughly contemporary, Chopin born in 1810 and Liszt a year later, although Liszt outlived Chopin by 37 years.

us,PLAY ON COSMONAUT LANDS IN SEA OF VACUITY,"If plays were adjudged on topicality alone, ""Heat of Re-entry"" would be a winner. In it, the playwright attempts to explore the life and death of the first cosmonaut. The timing is uncannily right: The play opened at Playwrights Horizons at the Theater-in-the-Park in Queens the night after the space shuttle Columbia's return, and just three nights after the 20the anniversary of man's first space flight. But nearly everything else about ""Heat of Re-entry"" (the title refers to the high temperature of the space capsule during the return to earth) is wrongheaded. Mr. Tetenbaum is writing about a playwright (the fictious Lev Malchikov, a Russian Jewish emigre, living in Brooklyn) who is writing a play about the first man to travel in space (the real Yuri Gargarin). In the play, the playwright comments upon his play in process and converses with this central character, who assumes a life of his own, making demands and intruding upon his creator's domain, playfully, capriciously at first, and then more and more insistently, as the nature of his death is speculated upon. (we have been told that Gagrin dies durong a test flight; the playwright suggests that he invited death by hunting animals from a low-flying jet.) We are led, all too emphatically, into the playwright's struggle to finish his own play, and figure it out: ""I'd say it's turned into a tragedy,"" he concludes. I'd say it never got out of the typewriter. Mr. Tetenbaum types in your basic sitcom style with delusions of tragedy and pretensions toward poetry.",1981-04-26T05:00:00+0000

In fact, many of the designs currently being manufactured are worthy of collecting because of the classic integrity of their design. Many of these objects will probably be desireable in future years as they are now. And because they are intended to be part of a collection that almost everybody has-home furnishings-they do not have to be collected in multiples. Classic design has an inherent quality to it, a quality that is achieved through the intelligent resolution of all its elements, purpose, design inspiration, material, proportion, construction and finish. It is not faddish, and there is little danger that in future years its purchaser will bemoan the fact that he fell for fashion of the moment and is now stuck with it, like an immovable albatross. Some fo these designs, such as handosme tea cart of ALvar Aalto, a Finnish architect, have been in continuous production since the 1930's Others, such as the 1920's smoked-glass and steel table designed by Eileen Gray, have been revived and re beginning to be manufactured again. Still others, such as a portable word processor that fits inside a small attache case, are brand new.

There are more than 30 periodicals, 12 publishing houses and at least 100 books in print offering advice and information on acquiring everything from barbed wire--these enthusiasts even have their own newspaper--to fine art. What are all these people collecting, why do they do it and, perhaps more importantly, once acquired, how do they live with their collections? In America, collectors once meant either the amassers of stamps or coins, or 19th- and early 20th-century millionaires who, with the help of experts such as Bernard Berenson and Lord Duveen, acquired the work of European masters as much for the aura of cultivation it lent their owners as for its beauty and value. Today, while stamps, coins and fine art still enjoy tremendous popularity, the majority of collections are now composed around either more mundane or more exotic themes. In fact, almost anything, it would appear, can be a collectible. By and large, today's collectors do not choose their acquisitions for their potential increase in value through the years. If they do appreciate, their owners say, it is a bonus. Many are motivated by nostalgia for simpler times and gather together sentimental objects such as Victorian valentines, but most seem driven only by a strong fascination for their specialty, whether it is salt-glaze pottery or objects covered shagreen, or shark skin.",1981-04-26T05:00:00+0000

So it is not surprising that, as the phonograph rounds out its first century, old record players of all kinds are being eagerly sought by collectors. After all, for many people, the love of music is one of their strongest and most durable emotional commitments, and if their musicality is matched by a penchant for fine mechanical contrivances, they are likely to find the collection of musical automata most rewarding. Some of these mechanical music makers actually precede the phonograph by yet another century or more. There has been, for example, an an active collector's market for music boxes ever since they gained , popularity among the well-to-do in the latter 1700's. Both the earlier kind, which work with tuned tines plucked by a studded roll, and the later sort, which employ slotted metal disks, now command prices ranging into the thousands of dollars, and several shops are devoted exclusively to these tinkling mementos of yesteryear.

But almost immediately, the music begins to unravel. The singer and horns vanish, leaving only a ghostly, shimmering electronic echo. Bass and drums crunch dutifully onward as snatches of guitars, keyboards and other instruments appear out of nowhere, repeat themselves for a measure or two, and then evaporate. Sometimes the instruments fall in together for part of a verse and the music's texture thickens.

That my family, and those before them were accomplished packrats, and the suburban burrow I grew up in was filled with their accumulations. Four generations of thrifty households run on the principle of ""Save it-- it might just come in handy someday"" made for crowded rooms. No minimal funiture arrangements for us. Dining-room chairs pressed closely against each other; there were more sofas in the living room than floor space. The Steinway upright loomed in the library corner flanked by papiermache whatnots that tripped up the music teacher every Wednesday afternoon. Unless one knew the territory, going about in the house at night was frankly hazardous. Every so often, an unwary guest would try for the bathroom in the dark with predictable collisions.

us,"Students of human behavior have long speculated about why some people seem irresistibly drawn to collecting.  ""The salient characteristic of this mania,"" claims Thomas Wiseman in his book ""The Money Motive"" (Random House, 1974), ""is the bestowal of one's love on something nonliving; it is the deflection of eros from a a human object to an inanimate one."" And who is the archetypal collector?  Freud described him as miserly, pedantic, stubborn and obsessively tidy.  Can these characterizations be true?  Can the child's seemingly harmless stamp collection actually be the object of deflected eros?  Can the reckless specualtor who has just dropped a bundle on a Captain Video lunch pail be gripped by parsimony?  Has the former sportsman who has taken to spending his precious weekends at auctions gone pedantic on us?","Probably the noblest and rarest form of collector is the Patron. A connoisseur, he puts his private gain to enduring public good. Though he is not an artist, he is artistic: His collection is his creation, product of an original and compelling vision. History's classic example of the Patron: the Medicis of 15th- and 16th-century Florence, who enriched Western civilization by indulging their exquisite tastes through enlightened patronage of, among others, Botticelli and Michelangelo. A far more ubiquitous but no less impassioned collector is the Fan. The Fan's enthusiasm for a particular sport or artist exceeds the more usual means of expression, such as attending games or concerts, so he seeks an outlet in collecting allied memorabilia. Often he is a frustrated artist. In his eyes, the next best thing to being a gifted composer owning Beethoven's letters and manuscripts. Or, on a different scale, the next best thing to being able to hit one out of the park is owning the 1954 Topps Chewing Gum card of the Milwaukee Braves' Hank Aaron. The Clutterer is a very different sort of collector, one whom purists, such as Fans, often fault for lacking focus. This sort collects without perceptible effort--objects just seem to attach themselves to him the way barnacles do to ships. He tends to have a bit of this, a bit of that, and, as a consequence, his collection usually lacks depth. The key to the Clutterer conundrum: a tendency to anthropomorphize.",1981-04-26T05:00:00+0000
