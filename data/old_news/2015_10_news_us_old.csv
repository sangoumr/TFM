That left Greg Holland, who has saved 116 games for the Royals over the past three seasons. Hollands responsibility, as Yost saw it, was to finish games  but only when protecting a lead. Yost said repeatedly that he wouldnt use Holland when his team is behind or tied. Dont look for me to do it, he told the beat writers after one game last year.

Losing her early New York friend and roommate, Robert Mapplethorpe, to AIDS in 1989. Her book is about moving from a time when her children were little and the things I touched were living (my husbands fingers, a dandelion, a skinned knee) to a time when she increasingly began to capture and memorialize moments from her life in photos and words  to create, as an artist, talismanic souvenirs of the past.

The Hemingways were fresh off a luxury steamship from Oak Park, Ill., looking to chuck the suburban grind for the seasonal joys of lake country. For $400 they soon had a 20- by 40-foot clapboard cottage built that was short on nearly every amenity except peace and quiet. It wasnt pioneer life  they had brought along a maid  but the surrounding woods were populated by Ojibwe Indians, black bears, lumberjacks and bootleggers.

In her new book, Happy Purim (Shelter Press), the masks and costumes associated with the Jewish holiday serve to universalize Hananias subjects, emphasizing the universality of dressing up rather than the particularity of religious culture. To that end, Hanania visits and documents places that seem as though they could be anywhere  not just the London neighborhood of Stamford Hill where the photos were taken. Uninterested in establishing a specific location, the artist situates children dressed as kings, as elderly people and even as pizzas against generic backgrounds: brick walls, sidewalk blocks. These pictures put a surreal spin on family photographs, teasing out the contrasts between youth and adulthood, childhood and mortality, appearing and disappearing.",2015-10-01T22:08:04+0000

Here she is, for instance, discussing the fact that her first antidepressant led her to fixate on suicide, which is sort of the opposite of what you want: Lots of concerned friends and family felt that the first medications failure was a clear sign that drugs were not the answer; if they were I would have been fixed. Clearly I wasnt as sick as I said I was if the medication didnt work for me. And that sort of makes sense, because when you have cancer the doctor gives you the best medicine, and if it doesnt shrink the tumor immediately then thats a pretty clear sign you were just faking it for attention. Ouch. Later, she complains that there is nothing more annoying than having someone tell you that everything would be fine if you were just a better pray-er, and adds, I can tell you that Just cheer up is almost universally looked at as the most unhelpful depression cure ever. Its pretty much the equivalent of telling someone who just had their legs amputated to just walk it off.

(Encore) A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992) Fly fishing surged in popularity after Robert Redfords visually stunning tale about a ministers sons coming of age in Montana between Prohibition and the Depression  and finding expression for their emotions knee-deep in a rushing river. Craig Sheffer plays the introspective Norman Maclean, on whose 1976 autobiographical story this film is based; Brad Pitt is Paul, his wilder, more magnetic brother.

It is easy to recognize Mr. Redfords reverent film version of this beautifully spare novella as a labor of love, she added. The same thoughts embraced by Mr. Maclean  of family and history, of the unbridgeable distances between men, of a wild natural landscape as a pathway to spiritual grace  are ably reflected on the screen.",2015-10-05T05:00:03+0000

Then he took this trip and realized he had to package himself differently. He dressed in black. He opened the Factory. This was when he became Warhol.",2015-10-06T16:43:31+0000

(HBO Signature) POLLOCK (2000) Ed Harris summons the spirit of the Abstract Expressionist giant Jackson Pollock, standing over an enormous canvas and dripping paint in graceful swooping gestures as the camera dances around him. He also seethes like the surly, violent alcoholic that Pollock was  upending dinner tables; raging at his wife, the painter Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden); and ultimately crashing his car with two female companions in what might have been a deliberate suicide run. Yes, the movie, which Mr. Harris also directed, has flaws and inaccuracies, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. But Pollock is for the most part admirable. It reminds us that great art isnt about creating beauty out of misty-eyed Hallmark moments but about discovering and communicating messy truths that spill all over the place, just like the lives of the artists driven to uncover them.

Like innumerable 19th-century works, this ballet concerns infidelity: Prince Siegfried no sooner finds true love with his one-and-only, Odette, than he betrays it by swearing love for her look-alike, Odile. But this story, set in the Germany of medieval romance, is complicated by aspects of pathos, wildness, doom, tragedy, malice  all of which Tchaikovskys score responds to passionately. By breaking Odettes heart, Siegfried condemns her to an eternity of turning back into swan form by day and only regaining human form, with her female companions, at night.",2015-10-13T21:37:33+0000

The American Civil Liberties Union filed the suit in a federal court in Spokane, Wash., on behalf of the former prisoners: Suleiman Abdullah Salim, Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud and Gul Rahman.

In fact, as the article was later corrected to clarify, the scholarly debate is a narrower one, focused on the precise location on the Temple Mount where the long destroyed temples once stood. All versions of the article should have made clear that the archaeological and historical uncertainties about the site  unlike assertions by some Palestinians that the temples never existed  do not directly challenge Jewish claims to the Temple Mount.",2015-10-14T05:23:37+0000

What the photograph (titled Clearing) showed was not a forest, but a model of a forest. The German artist Thomas Demand had constructed this model from paper and set it in a steel frame 50 feet wide.

This new disc focuses on Mr. Holligers project of transcriptions (2001-09) of pieces by the 14th-century composer Guillaume de Machaut. Machauts ballade Biaute qui toutes autres pere is translated from a cappella voices into airy, sun-shard harmonics for three violas; in Mr. Holligers version of another ballade, the original melody glints behind veils of new dissonances. Machauts Hoquetus David becomes Mr. Holligers sliding, plucking, tapping, ultimately chaotic nach Hoquetus David, and the new arrangement of Machauts seventh lay adds three new, duskily harmonizing vocal lines to the single surviving one. The cycle is capped with two extensive summations; the final Complainte brings together voices and violas in a melancholy outpouring. The transcriptions project has Mr. Holligers customary, total elegance, as well as a tenderness that reaches, composer to composer, across centuries. The performers are attentive and passionate, and the recorded sound vivid enough to capture the violists intakes of breath as they cue each other. (Zachary Woolfe)",2015-10-14T18:01:29+0000

The government of Ecuador sued Roberto and William Isaas, Ecuadorean brothers who fled to Florida after the bank they ran in Ecuador, Filanbanco, failed in 1998. Ecuadors government convicted the men of embezzling bank deposits and sued in Florida to recover the funds. After a trial this summer in Miami, Judge John W. Thornton ruled Thursday that the statute of limitations had expired, and the government had no standing to sue. The Isaas family has contributed large amounts of money to Democratic campaigns, including that of President Obama. The Ecuadorean government has accused the Isaas family of buying political protection from Washington while living comfortably in Miami off the profits of a looted bank. ",2015-10-16T00:02:33+0000

Kia said it had received numerous complaints about the problem, including reports of three injuries. The carmaker said it was caused by drivers who use excessive force to move the gearshift lever, thus damaging the gearshift interlock mechanism. That interlock, mandated by the government, requires the driver to depress the brake before the transmission can be moved out of park. An Ohio man told regulators that his Sorento rolled down his driveway when his 10-year-old son was playing unsupervised in the vehicle. In the complaint, posted in 2014 on the safety regulators website, the man said his son jumped out of the truck and tried to stop it by getting behind it. The child was hospitalized for almost three weeks with injuries including four cracked ribs and a cracked pelvis. ",2015-10-16T01:06:33+0000

From the late 19th century to the early 20th, the icon of choice was not a fountain or an obelisk but a young man in the prime of courage. He is Johnny Reb, staring attentively ahead, at something. One of the few acts at Appomattox that moves so many white Southerners to emotion was the generosity of permitting Gen. Robert E. Lee and his officers to depart with their side arms. It was technically a gallant gesture but arguably Grants unconscious acknowledgment of what we now know: that the war didnt end but would merely be engaged on other battlefields: Klan terrorism, Jim Crow, redlining, housing covenants, voting rights restrictions. The most nuanced expression of this unending war can be seen in these stone faces.

I always felt like Jim was doing more than collaborating with me on a novel, Ellis wrote on his website. He was trying to teach me, too. And it was always about the reader. Its not about winning writing awards (though he has won plenty). Its not about how impressively you display all the research youve amassed. Its not about the number of syllables in your flowery description. The only question is, how will the reader respond? If it heightens the drama for the reader  because it makes you love the protagonist or hate the villain; ... because it tears at your heart; because it turns your expectations upside down  then it belongs in the book. Jim always preaches, never miss an opportunity to maximize the drama. Why speak quietly when you can shout? Why quietly acquiesce to misfortune when you can lash out? Why jab a finger when you can throw a punch? Why throw a punch when you can engage in a high-speed shootout? Why a soft kiss and not a sizzling romp in bed? Turn. Up. The. Heat.

In 1999 worldwide revenue was $27 billion, and it looked like nothing but blue sky ahead. John Seabrooks well-researched new book about the industry covers the sharp downward slope that followed. The people I knew combed the country looking for the next hit makers and chatted with global conglomerates about acquisitions and weekended in the Hamptons, with no idea that the end of the party was right around the corner. That their industry was going to contract so much that in 2014 worldwide revenue would be $15 billion, not much more than half of what it had been at its peak. Theres still a music business, but its a lot less profitable and a lot less arrogant than it used to be.",2015-10-16T16:50:32+0000

Behind him, a crashed plane sends off waves of fire and a pillar of smoke. He might have survived the crash or he might have caused it; he doesnt know.

As a noncontroversial counterpoint to dinner-table hot buttons like religion and politics, weather has probably played analgesic for generations of families. And then, of course, weather turned into climate, which combined all of the above, and suddenly there was nothing less safe in the world. As Lauren Redniss writes in Thunder and Lightning: Weather Past, Present, Future, weather is the state of the atmosphere, whereas climate describes prevailing weather patterns on a larger scale. But changes to climate, by definition, mean changes in the weather. ",2015-10-16T16:50:52+0000

By the time the teacher at our hospital birth class announced that she wouldnt explain how to use formula because it was against hospital regulations, I was pretty fed up. I wasnt sure if it was formula itself or talking about it that was against the rules, but either way I had had enough of the righteous zeal that surrounds breast-feeding.

A waitress in a greasy spoon with a rat problem realizes that her customer is responsible for the demise of her family.

How they end is kind of up to the viewer.

The lavishly illustrated fable of twin orphans growing up in a traveling circus in what Malouf calls a futuristic Dickensian world was inspired by personal touchstones ranging from Charlotte Bront to August Sander to her superstitious grandmother who believed in fortune-telling, and reflects Maloufs distinctive sense of style, which seems vaguely late Victorian but ultimately unmoored to a time or place. A former fashion designer (she co-founded the early-aughts cult label Charlotte Corday) and theater costumer, she favors prim vintage dresses, faded florals and a signature half-pinned hairstyle she describes as messy 1940s. She could easily fit, unadulterated, into a quirky Anderson production, giving Margot Tenenbaum a run for her money, and is the perfect foil for the 46-year-old director, with his bespoke tweeds and Wildean pageboy.",2015-10-19T17:30:04+0000

us,A New San Francisco Boutique for Fashion-Starved Locals,"For a city ostensibly fixated on the future, San Francisco offers a retail fashion scene so safe it can seem retrograde. Sure, there are outposts of casual good taste and the on-trend-enough shops of Hayes Valley, but for women of a certain sartorial spirit  those seeking a world-class source of adventurous, cool-girl clothes by cult designers  the best the city has to offer sometimes feels like the e-commerce software invented here. Now, however, San Francisco has a brick-and-mortar boutique innovating at the same level as the citys tech start-ups and artisanal coffee shrines. Nestled on a leafy residential street near Dolores Park in the Mission district, Anase isnt new, exactly. It has for four years been operating as an online-only store from an even less likely location, San Jose, where its owner  Renee Friedrich, a former pharmacist from Maryland  moved for love, she says. (Friedrichs Bay Area clients had been asking her to open a shop all along, though its perhaps telling that the majority of her online customers are from New York.)",2015-10-19T21:10:41+0000

us,One Nostalgic (and Handsome) Anti-Bling Watch,"Montblanc is best known for its writing implements, but in recent years the company has dived deep into haute horlogerie, or fine watchmaking, especially since its parent company, Richemont, acquired Minerva, the legendary Swiss watchmaker that has manufactured its own movements for more than a hundred years. Montblanc timepieces are now the only watches being made with the famed Minerva components, still manufactured by the several dozen employees of the factory nestled in the mountain village of Villeret. From the new 1858 collection  which harks back to the year that Minerva, which outfitted soldiers during both World Wars, was founded  the Tachymeter Limited Edition sports a manually wound chronograph with subtle and inventive midcentury flourishes. The crisp white numbers stand out against the black dial, cased in rose gold. A refined black alligator strap is attached to vintage-style lugs, and instead of the traditional individual pushers placed at 2 and 4 oclock, they are combined in a single sleek unit within a crown so regal it looks as though it could be trimmed in ermine. The effect? Highly functional anti-bling to make the hearts of watch connoisseurs beat faster.",2015-10-20T06:00:05+0000

Their conclusion, I expect, would be that the single most important decision these inscrutable humans make each year is whether to plant corn, soybeans or wheat. No decision, year after year, transforms more square miles of American land than the choice farmers make about which crops to grow. In some years, those aliens would see huge swaths of tight green rows of soybean; in others, more tall corn with yellow tufts; in others, an unusual abundance of wheat in, well, amber waves. Earlier this month, Rick Stern, who farms 1,500 acres in central New Jersey with his father, told me that he had just spent weeks making this very decision. He carefully studied the global market reports to learn about recent yields in Argentina and Brazil, Americas leading rivals for soybean exports.

Choosing the jury that would decide whether Foster deserved to be executed, the prosecutors sent home four potential black jurors. They gave reasons that they said were unrelated to race, as the Supreme Court requires, but that seem unconvincing. The prosecutors said they struck one black woman from the jury because, at 34, she was too close to Fosters age. They said they excluded a black man because his wife worked at a hospital. But so did a white woman who was asked to sit on the jury, which, in the end, was entirely white.",2015-10-20T11:00:22+0000

Think of yourself as a way-out-there outfielder. Sometimes, Hample is on his feet the whole game, scampering back and forth in the bleachers from left field to right. Dont stay in your ticketed seat unless you have to. Seek out designated standing areas or move to an aisle seat in a sparsely populated row. Lateral mobility is key, Hample says. In the off-season, he writes books about baseball and works at Argosy, his familys Manhattan bookstore. During the season, he traverses the country as a so-called ball hawk, snagging balls that he stores in giant plastic barrels in his mothers basement. (Highlights have included Alex Rodriguezs 3,000th-career-hit ball and the first major-league home run hit by Mike Trout, the reigning American League M.V.P.)",2015-10-23T11:00:07+0000

us,Poetic and Lifelike Botanical Sculptures,"EVERY PLANT NEEDS a system to grow, but there is also that X factor, something wonderful and wild that messes with the symmetry and balance, says the 65-year-old American artist Carmen Almon. That little bit of mystery is whats real to me. It is Almons ability to capture organic quirks that makes her botanical sculptures so remarkably lifelike and at the same time uncanny, existing just beyond the borders of the natural. Delicately rendered from the least delicate of materials (copper sheeting, brass tubing) and colored with enamel paint  theyre an adaptation of the tole style traditionally used to decorate metal lamps and trays. Almons wildflowers, weeds and vegetable plants are inspired by the abundant greenery that surrounds her country home in southwestern France and by her collection of detailed 17th- and 18th-century botanical drawings, as well as her own imaginings. Her unique creations have captivated a small but discerning set of collectors including Deeda Blair, Carolina Herrera and interior designer Howard Slatkin, for whom Almon worked as an art director in the 1980s, painting everything from silk fabrics to furniture. It was during this era that Blair, a client of Slatkins, asked Almon to restore a metal flower sculpture by the late Chicago artist Mary Munnecke  and so introduced her to the world of tole.",2015-10-23T13:00:04+0000

Heads separated from their bodies, bodies relieved of their limbs, unforgettable starving children, pictures burned into the collective retina of the time. In Under the Udala Trees, the first novel by the Nigerian-born writer Chinelo Okparanta (following her story collection, Happiness, Like Water, which was shortlisted for the Caine Prize), the protagonist, Ijeoma, is a child, a bystander to those horrific days. Her father refuses on principle to hide in the family bunker and is killed in an air raid. Her mother, unable to bear this loss, collapses. Not everyone rises to heroism in hard times.

In Marras Kirovsk theres a polluted man-made lake surrounded by a dozen smokestacks that locals have named the Twelve Apostles; more memorable still is the White Forest, a field of metal and plastic birches planted in Soviet times by the local party bosss wife, to combat the citys reputation as an eyesore. Everything about the place reeks of disaster, even the name: Sergei Kirov was a Bolshevik whose assassination  probably on Stalins orders  became a pretext for the show trials of the 1930s.

On Hemlock Joness shelves are glass jars containing pavement and road sweepings and fluff from omnibus and road-car seats. When he thinks, his head shrinks, so much reduced in size by his mental compression that his hat tipped back from his forehead and literally hung on his massive ears. Joness diamond-encrusted cigar case, a present from the Turkish ambassador, has gone missing. There can be only one culprit: the narrator himself!

He had also done some intelligence work at Oxford and, earlier, Bern (tracking students attending left-wing meetings). Few writers have made better use of on-the-job training. The secret service has been source material for a long line of novelists, but it was le Carr who made it a permanent part of the literary landscape, giving us a fictional world so convincingly imagined that even its real-life inhabitants began to confuse the two, adopting his invented argot  the Cousins, scalphunters, lamplighters, mole, etc.  as their own. So blurred did these lines become that the Oxford English Dictionary had to conduct a lengthy usage search before deciding that mole had indeed been popularized in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. His 23 books have sold millions of copies, and 10 have been filmed. Anyone writing about espionage is invariably compared with him.

us,Classical Playlist: Poetry in Music and Gilles Vonsattel,"POETRY IN MUSICThe Sixteen; Harry Christophers, conductor(Coro)In the liner notes for this rewarding album of 14 a cappella vocal works, Harry Christophers, the conductor of the vocal ensemble the Sixteen, wonders what composers would do without poets and dramatists. Usually, he writes, the better the text, the more inspired the composer. But actually, certain great poems resist musical settings. Music has to be able to add something. But the British composers represented here, covering five centuries, all chose distinguished texts and responded with extraordinary music. William Harriss 1925 anthem for double chorus Faire is the Heaven (an Edmund Spenser poem), which opens the album, conveys the text through surging, intensely mystical music with effective back-and-forth exchanges. Tippetts Dance, clarion air (words by Christopher Fry), unfolds with stabbing chords and jumpy repetitions, sounding almost giddy. The program is built around four austerely poignant settings by Tudor- and early-Stuart-era composers (Thomas Weelkes, Robert Ramsey, Michael East and Thomas Tomkins) of When David Heard, from the Biblical story of the slaying of Absalom. Brittens remarkable Hymn to Saint Cecilia (words by Auden) is the longest piece here. There are also exceptional works by Edmund Rubbra, Herbert Howells and others. The performances are beautiful and brilliant. (Anthony Tommasini)",2015-10-28T16:00:38+0000

By leaving the tax in place, Mexico assured that this tax will remain a model for similar measures in the U.S. and around the world, said former Mayor Michael R.

Lu is something of a young elite herself  all five of her novels have been best sellers since her debut, Legend, hit the list in 2013, when Lu was 28. But until she was a teenager, she recently acknowledged, she didnt understand that actual people had written the stories she loved. In my head, I thought books were just spat out of factories somewhere, she told a school in Manila last year, according to The Philippine Daily Inquirer. Lu, who was born in China and immigrated to America with her family shortly after the Tiananmen Square massacre when she was 5, told students at the International School Manila that witnessing the Tiananmen protests had influenced her writing and that she often researched real-life political horrors before turning to her dystopian novels. There is no utopian country, and that is the way the world is, she said.

As Peter Ackroyd shows in his study of a Victorian writer who was a major creator of the detective novel, Wilkie Collins could have taken on all comers. At one point, the author of The Woman in White and The Moonstone consumed, in a single glass, enough laudanum (a potent combination of opium and alcohol) to kill 12 people. He loved cigars, drank heavily  preferably brut Champagne  and usually ate rich French food. With these appetites, its not surprising that he complained of gout of the brain. The wonder is that he wrote at all, let alone that his output was prodigious: novels, short stories, travelogues, essays, plays, even disquisitions on advice columns.",2015-10-30T15:25:30+0000

On the way from their home in Albuquerque to San Francisco, in a motel he has checked into, Aaron prevents an abusive father from killing his son in the next room over by breaking down the door and calling the police. This event will carry intense meaning for Aaron throughout the novel: It seemed he had been waiting his whole life to save this boy. For until Walters arrival in his life, Aaron himself was a child in desperate need of rescue. He remembers imagining his bed as a boat tossed by violent weather: In the midst of the storms, he would throw himself from the bed to the floor, where he pretended that he was swimming, staying afloat and saving his own life because there was nobody else to save him. When he tells Walter hes leaving, Walter says reproachfully, I saved you, Aaron.
