A young Canadian doctor with no nautical training, fresh from an army stint and feeling rudderless, tells of how he refreshed his soul by sailing in a 37-foot boat from British Columbia to Tahiti and back. Patterson, at right, didn't run into any killer sharks or perfect storms, but he came up with ''a delightful, finely written and, in the end, wise book,'' Christopher Buckley wrote here in 2000. Monsters of the Sea, by Richard Ellis (Lyons, $22.95), is a historical survey of mermaids, giant squids, sea serpents and other spooky creatures -- both real and mythological -- that lurk in the deep. In 1994 our reviewer, Janet Lembke, admired Ellis's ''insatiable curiosity'' and ''wry sense of humor.'' In Search of Moby Dick: Quest for the White Whale, by Tim Severin (Da Capo, $13.50), is the colorful account of how the author roamed the South Pacific with whale hunters to determine whether Ahab's nemesis ever existed and whether similar whales exist today.

us,June 24-30; Freelancers' Rights Upheld,"Among a flurry of decisions the Supreme Court released before ending its current session -- including rulings reining in local regulations on tobacco advertising and affirming some immigrants' rights -- was one on the intellectual rights of freelancers. Six such writers took on three major media companies, including The New York Times, over the unauthorized inclusion of their printed work in databases. The justices agreed 7 to 2 that the practice infringed on the freelancers' copyrights. The publishers said they would start removing freelance material from electronic archives, an outcome that could diminish the writers' pleasure in their David and Goliath victory.

us,Edgar's Ordeals,"Brady Udall's rambling and generous first novel, THE MIRACLE LIFE OF EDGAR MINT (Norton, $24.95), begins when its half-Apache protagonist is 7 and a mail carrier drives a Jeep over his head. Edgar survives -- a miracle -- but the ordeals that follow make the travails of Dickens's hard-luck children look easy. Edgar's father decamped before his son was born, and the boy's beer-swilling mother abandons him following the accident. He is sent to a school for Indian delinquents, where he is tortured and nearly killed by other boys; later, he moves in with a dysfunctional Mormon foster family. Throughout, he is pursued by a demon in the shape of the drug-peddling doctor who saved his life. Contemporary fiction is full of cynical, world-weary protagonists. One of the strengths of this big, uneven novel -- it reads at times like a John Irving novel touched up by Roy Blount Jr. -- is the lovely and complex character of Edgar, an innocent whose struggle to survive is at odds with his fundamentally gentle nature. (''Don't go bad, Edgar,'' an aide at the Indian school whispers to him after a fight.) The conflict is never presented as simple; Edgar almost does go bad. But he manages to detach himself from miserable experiences by setting them down on paper. Other characters are less rich, the denouement seems rushed, and the book is too long. But it is also sweet, sad and refreshing. Jennifer Reese",2001-07-01T05:00:00+0000

It cites research from the National Institutes of Health finding that the consumption of blueberries not only prevent some of the problems associated with aging -- O.K., in rats -- but can also reverse them. But what about blueberry champagne? Fernando Velasquez, the winemaker at Renault Winery in Egg Harbor (www.renaultwinery.com), doesn't exactly say his blueberry champagne is what Ponce de Leon was searching for, but he does promote it as a fun drink. ''This is something for a special occasion,'' Mr. Velasquez said. ''It is sweet.'' The Renault Winery is only a few miles up the White Horse Pike from Hammonton, which in 1984 Ronald Reagan proclaimed the Blueberry Capital of the United States. So the fruit in Mr. Velasquez's wine is fresh and local. We tried it twice: once before a barbecue and another shared as an aperitif with old friends from South Jersey. The wine has a rosy tinge, with only a splash of blue, but you can definitely taste the blueberries. It is indeed sweet, but probably no sweeter than your average spumonte. While most of the best champagnes are much dryer, it is hard to compare something with blueberries from New Jersey costing $12.99 a bottle with something from the chalky earth of Rheims going for at least three times that. But as a sometime thing before a barbecue or after a day at the pool or beach, a quick glass of blueberry bubbly might just bring back some youthful tingles. As Mr. Velasquez said, ''It is something to drink any time you are feeling good.'' Which is probably all Seor Ponce was after. ROBERT STRAUSS",2001-07-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Netpliance Fined By F.T.C.,"Netpliance, which sells a small computer called the i-opener as a less expensive alternative to the personal computer for Internet access and e-mail, has settled with the Federal Trade Commission on charges that its advertising, sales and billing practices violated federal laws, agency officials said. The agreement with the commission requires Netpliance, of Austin, Tex., to reimburse an unspecified amount to consumers who were improperly billed and to pay the government a $100,000 civil penalty. Netpliance contended that the i-opener would allow very easy access to the Web, without special software or boot-up delays, for about $199. But the F.T.C. said the company failed to disclose extra costs and restrictions, including monthly Internet service fees and long-distance telephone charges. In addition, the commission said, the company, which still sells i-openers at Circuit City and CompUSA stores, billed some customers' credit cards without their consent.",2001-07-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Clues to Benefits of Fruit and Vegetables," Anew study has found that vegetarians have high blood levels of salicylic acid, the active ingredient in aspirin. Given that aspirin can prevent heart attacks, the new findings may help explain other studies that have found lower levels of heart disease among people who eat a lot of fruit and vegetables. The study, published last week in The Journal of Clinical Pathology, compared the salicylic acid levels of a group of Buddhist monks (who are vegetarians), non- vegetarian residents of the same region and a group of diabetic patients taking 75 milligrams of aspirin daily. One of the researchers, Dr. John Paterson of the Royal Infirmary in Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland, said that he was not surprised to find higher levels of the acid in the blood of the monks than in their neighbors'. He recounted an old joke: What's a Scotsman's favorite vegetable? A sausage. But Dr. Paterson said he was surprised that some of the monks had as much salicylic acid in their blood as some of the diabetics taking aspirin. Eating foods rich in salicylic acid does not provide all the cardiac benefits of taking aspirin, Dr. Paterson said: aspirin helps block the formation of blood clots, while fruits and vegetables do not. But salicylic acid from either source reduces the kind of inflammation that can contribute over years to the hardening and narrowing of the arteries and to certain kinds of cancer, he said. Before aspirin was synthesized in the late 19th century, Dr. Paterson said, doctors gave patients extracts of willow bark and other plants high in salicylic acid. The new study shows that significant levels of the chemical can come in a more palatable form. ",2001-07-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Special Milk May Help Children's Health," Children given milk treated with beneficial bacteria missed less day care because of illness than did those who drank ordinary milk, a study in Finland found. The children who drank the so-called probiotic milk got almost as many infections during a Helsinki winter, but they had fewer complications and slightly fewer ear infections and needed less antibiotics. The bacteria included in the milk, lactobacillus, have been found to stimulate the immune system's response to infections, the researchers reported last month in The British Medical Journal. They said that earlier studies showed that the bacteria could also help reduce the amount of diarrhea that accompanies use of antibiotics. The researchers, from Helsinki University Central Hospital, said that children in day care were more likely to suffer from respiratory and gastric infections than children spending their days at home or in small groups. Having children drink probiotic milk appears to be an easy way to improve health with no adverse effects, they wrote. ""A 10 percent to 20 percent reduction in absences from day care, which our results indicate is possible, could have important clinical, public health and economic consequences,"" the study says.

us,Predicting Chronic Whiplash," Rushing to the courthouse after a car accident does not appear to prolong the symptoms of whiplash, a new study in Denmark concluded. The study, published last month in the journal Neurology, followed 141 patients who suffered whiplash, an injury to the neck and back most commonly caused by the sudden jolt of a car crash. Most whiplash victims recover quickly, but a small number are disabled for years. It has not been clear why some patients do well and others do poorly, leading a number of researchers to suggest that the possibility of awards in lawsuits could lead some patients to hang on to their symptoms. In the new study, researchers from Aarhus University found that people who could not move their necks much after their injuries were more likely to have lingering problems. Neck mobility was a much better predictor of later disability than were reported levels of pain and reductions in strength. Litigation, however, was not. People with whiplash injuries who sued within 30 days after injury were not at higher risk for long-term problems than were other participants, the researchers said. But the researchers noticed that when patients with ankle injuries, in a control group, were questioned repeatedly about neck and shoulder pain, they tended to report whiplash-like aches, too. These findings suggest that focus and attention may play a role in the development of symptoms, the researchers concluded. ",2001-07-03T05:00:00+0000

According to a recent E.P.A. survey of 1,891 beaches, 24 percent had at least one advisory or closing, largely because of unsafe levels of fecal bacteria in the water. On Memorial Day weekend alone, swimming bans were in effect at three Staten Island beaches. Beachgoers aren't to blame. Heavy rains heighten sewage runoff and urban street runoff, contaminating the water. Fecal bacteria is, no surprise, nasty stuff, causing ear, nose and throat infections, stomachaches and staph on open cuts. Bill Clinton's beach bill, signed last October, requires nationwide standards for beach-water-quality monitoring and public notification of unsafe conditions. But you can test the waters yourself if you've got $25 and at least 24 hours with a kit that will give you a coliform bacterial count, offered by the environmental group Surfrider.",2001-07-08T05:00:00+0000

us,GUN PERMITS INCREASE,"New Jersey is one of only three states of the 19 that require background checks for gun purchases that reported an increase last year in the number of applications for gun permits. During 2000, 77,211 applications to buy handguns or rifles were submitted to state or local law enforcement agencies, a 1.1 percent increase over 1999, according to a study released last week by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. Colorado and Maryland also reported increases. In the other states, the F.B.I. rather than state officials does background checks and statistics are not released on a state-by-state basis. Nationally, requests to buy guns dropped 11 percent from 8.6 million to 7.7 million between 1999 and 2000. The number of applications rejected also declined from 204,000 to 153,000.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Shirts of Paradise,"You don't have to be Hawaiian to love Hawaiian shirts. You don't even have to wear one to enjoy THE ALOHA SHIRT: Spirit of the Islands (Beyond Words, $45). Dale Hope and Gregory Tozian write, ''Aloha puts into one word the warm sense of greeting, love and playfulness for which Hawaii is well known,'' a spirit evoked through the tropical colors and Polynesian patterns emblazoned on the classic Hawaiian or Aloha shirt. It began as a novelty souvenir, selling for 95 cents during the early 1930's, when Hawaii was emerging as a tourist paradise. Soon the shirt grew into a major industry with its own master textile designers and printmakers. Profusely illustrated with photographs, drawings, advertisements, tags and labels, the book is a history of the shirt's designers and manufacturers. The illustrations are delightful. Film posters and record covers feature celebrity poster boys like Elvis Presley, Bing Crosby (who lent his name to a shirt label) and Montgomery Clift, who in the 1953 movie ''From Here to Eternity'' takes a fatal bullet in his lovely Aloha. There is also a section on the varieties of coconut buttons sewn onto vintage garments. But the real treat is reproductions of the shirts themselves, more than 100 of them, spread out like wallpaper swatches, with lyrical, weird or kitschy designs like palm trees, sailboats, flying fish, surfboards, exploding volcanoes, hula girls and night-blooming cereus patterns. One favorite, from 1959, is the ''Okole Maluna'' or ''Bottoms Up.'' Steven Heller",2001-07-08T05:00:00+0000

us,QUICK BITE/Montclair; Close-to-Home Cooking,"When we moved to Upper Montclair, we found ourselves spending a large amount of time at the Char-Broil, the diner that has been in its Valley Road home since 1912 -- long before we trudged in nightly, weary from a long day of packing and unpacking, balancing books in one arm and baby in the other. With that baby, my husband and our 7-year-old son, we set upon the Char-Broil as only the hungry can. The food, bountiful as the waitresses' generous greetings, never failed to be satisfying. I nearly sank into the huge Greek salad ($6.75), ripe with chunks of feta and fine slivers of anchovies. Alan, a meat-and-potatoes man, went from burgers ($3.40) to pork chops ($9.95) to pot roast ($9.45). There were enough crayons, too, to keep a boy happy. Paul found delights in the children's menu, choosing the Penguin (hot dog, French fries, ice cream ($5.75). And when Miles wasn't asleep in my arms, he delighted in the scenery, inside and out. The large picture windows on Valley Road were perfect, and we smiled and sighed happily as we ate, watching the families outside as they walked, talked, laughed. After we were more settled in our home, we began to neglect the Char-Broil, treating it like a friend to whom we'd revealed one too many intimacies only to regret our indiscretion. When we thought of the Broil, if we did at all, it was only during our family's evening walks around town. But then the faces of the families in the diner's windows -- smiling, happy -- reminded us of our internship, and lured us back, again and again, smiling and happy as well.",2001-07-08T05:00:00+0000

It divides into four bands of terrain, running from west to east. In the south is desert, broken only by oases along the rivers which run off the mountains along the southern and eastern rims. Then comes steppe, lightly watered country with a thin and variable covering of grasses and scrub, again broken intermittently by oases, gullies, and river valleys. Farther north is a belt of coniferous forest, interspersed toward its southern edge with deciduous trees; only to the west of the Urals does this deciduous belt broaden to become a large and independent ecological zone.

She was born December 30, 1931, in England, to Kathleen Norah and Edward Donaldson Hogg. At age seven, she was evacuated to Canada to escape the German air raids of World War II. At the war's end, she returned to parents and a home she barely remembered. At eighteen, she took her first job as secretary to the colorful Ian Robert Maxwell. Six years later she left England to work her way around the world, working for KCBS in San Francisco before becoming Executive Assistant to Edward R. Murrow at CBS News in New York. On March 14, 1959, she married Paul Garrigue, whom she had met aboard the ship that brought her from England to the United States. Mrs. Garrigue published three acclaimed children's novels, each of which was translated into several languages: ''All the Children Were Sent Away,'' ''Between Friends'' and ''The Eternal Spring of Mr. Ito.'' The first and third books were based on her own wartime experiences. She was a sought-after speaker at schools throughout the eastern U.S., and corresponded with many children who had read her books. She spent many happy hours over more than two decades with the Chappaqua Drama Group, performing every function from acting and producing to selecting plays and serving as the group's president. An accomplished linguist, she loved reading, writing poetry, telling stories, painting and gardening, and was known for her creativity and dry wit. Above all, she was devoted to her family.

The Standard Lounge, on the ground level of the Standard Hotel on Sunset Boulevard, is reminiscent of the Danish designer Verner Panton's playful 1960's period, with potato-chip-shaped hammocks, spaceship chrome and walls lined with undulating purple Lucite rods. The waitresses, wearing Courrges-style red minidresses, match the dcor perfectly. But the music, instead of ambient lounge, is hard-rock party anthems by metal groups like Black Sabbath and Van Halen. Already the womblike space has become a must-squeeze-into for Hollywood's tattooed and spiked elite -- among them Tommy Lee, Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, the band Korn and youth pop stars like Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys.",2001-07-08T05:00:00+0000

The jaunty male flight attendant brings our drinks: a two percent milk with one ice cube for me, a Wild Turkey for you. It's wet outside, the runways streaked and dark. Late afternoon. The first-class cabin fills with other businessmen who switch on their laptops and call up lengthy spreadsheets or use the last few moments before takeoff to punch in cell-phone calls to wives and clients. Their voices are bright but shallow, no diaphragms, their sentences kept short to save on tolls, and when they hang up they face the windows, sigh, and reset their watches from Central time to Mountain. For some of them this means a longer day, for others it means eating supper before they're hungry. One fellow lowers his plastic window shade and wedges his head between two skimpy pillows, while another unlatches his briefcase, looks inside, then shuts his eyes and rubs his jaw, exhausted.

Pines' father, Isadore Pinkowitz, a Romanian immigrant, founded the Hebrew National Kosher Sausage Factory in 1905, producing kosher frankfurters and selling them from a wagon on Manhattan's Lower East Side until his death in 1936. Pinkowitz's eldest son, Leonard, took over the company and built it into the largest kosher brand in America, whose many famous products included hot dogs, salami, corned beef, pastrami, and deli condiments. The company's success proved there was a market for kosher beyond Jewish consumers. Pines was married for 48 years to Mary Zucker, who died in 1981. He lost his second wife, Jeanette Weinstein, in 1999. Pines is survived by four children: Myrna, Isadore (''Skip''), Paula, and Kenneth. He has 13 grandchildren and 10 greatgrandchildren. His is also survived by a sister Pauline Goldstein and brother Max Pines, and sister-inlaw Dottie Pines and his favorite girls Virginia and Sybil.

Just Toys filed for Chapter 11 protection in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, listing $57,000 in assets and $2.7 million in debts. The company revealed in March that it was unable to pay its creditors and vendors. It said it had fired most employees not needed to fill orders and was discussing selling its assets. Calls seeking comment from company officials were not immediately returned. Founded in 1988 by Allan Rigberg and Rose Evangelista, Just Toys went public in 1992, raising about $13.6 million. By 1993, its shares, initially offered at $10.50, had risen to $42.78. In 1995, Just Toys settled a lawsuit filed by Mr. Rigberg and Ms. Evangelista after they were fired. They said the company had violated their employment contracts and made them scapegoats for its financial troubles. Company sales peaked in 1997 at $23.2 million and have fallen steadily since. Shares of Just Toys were unchanged at 1 cent. The shares fell 87 percent in 2000 and have fallen more than 98 percent this year. ",2001-07-12T05:00:00+0000

For $1,500 per trip, the couriers smuggled more than one million Ecstasy tablets from Europe to the United States in 1998 and 1999. Mr. Erez used Hasidim in religious garb because they drew less scrutiny in customs, prosecutors said. &#0160;&#0160;Alan Feuer (NYT) ",2001-07-12T05:00:00+0000

Albulescu in Romania; and several grand-nephews and grand-nieces. His wife, Nelicia, predeceased him several years ago. Henry Haimovici was born in rural Romania in 1907 and, after graduating from college, attended and graduated from the Marseille Medical School in France in 1937 and became a French citizen. He was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship at Harvard Medical School in 1938-1939. Although World War II had already started in Europe, Henry Haimovici returned to France and was drafted into the French army in 1940 as an army surgeon in Montpellier, but by July, 1940, with the war escalating, he thought he should try to return to the United States, which he was able to do with the help of Marshal Petain. It took two years for him to get an exit visa out of France to North Africa and into the U.S. Practicing medicine in the U.S. since 1942, Dr. Haimovici was with Mt. Sinai Hospital from 1944-1954, was Chief of Vascular Surgery at Montefiore Hospital from 1945-1972 and Chief of Surgery Emeritus thereafter.

He was the founder in 1950 of the International Society of Cardiovascular Surgery and published over 200 articles and books in French and English, including his book The Metabolic Complications of Acute Arterial Occlusions and Related Conditions in 1988 and his treatise, Haimovici's Vascular Surgery, Principles and Technologies, which is currently in its fourth edition.

The ruling, by a five-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, takes the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association further toward its goal of having its contract dispute with the city arbitrated by the State Public Employment Relations Board rather than the city's Office of Collective Bargaining. The state board takes into account the salaries of officers and firefighters in suburban communities, which pay as much as 35 percent more than the city does.

But Gluck himself, as sensitive to the demands of his audience as the next composer, revised the piece extensively for its Paris premiere in 1774, adapting it to French tastes by eliminating the castrato, beefing up the ballets, and adding an Act I aria for Orfeo featuring the kind of florid singing he purported to be reacting against in the first place.",2001-07-14T05:00:00+0000

Even the concept of nuclear deterrence is not immune to this desire to clean house. In mid-June President Bush stated his intention to move away from the logic of mutually assured destruction -- ''the capacity of each of us, each country, to blow each other up,'' as he said -- in favor of a new framework based on some combination of strategic offensive and defensive systems.",2001-07-15T05:00:00+0000

The action, coming on top of the worst drought the Pacific Northwest has seen in many years, has left 1,400 farmers without water, ruined crops on about 200,000 acres and inspired isolated acts of civil disobedience in which angry farmers have tried to reopen headgates blocking the water.

Of 12 copies that were made, two were sold to Ron Rohrenbacher of Pomona, Calif., who in turn donated one to the museum last week.

us,"""Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars"""," The great Shawnee chief Tecumseh let out a terrifying whoop. Six Shawnees, six Kickapoos, and six Winnebagos responded with similar cries. Together, with two Creek warriors as guides, they boarded canoes and headed down the Wabash to the Ohio River on their way south to the country of the Five Civilized Nations: Creeks, Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Seminoles. They were beginning a momentous journey that would change the course of American history in ways they never intended. Tecumseh expected to persuade the southern tribes into joining a stupendous confederation of Native Americans reaching from the Canadian frontier to the Gulf of Mexico with which he would launch a massive Indian attack against white settlements. With such an alliance he expected to sweep the white devils back into the ocean whence they had come and restore the continent to its rightful owners. ",2001-07-15T05:00:00+0000

us,The Silence of the Earps,"Wyatt Earp might be the best known of Old West lawmen, but despite his frequent depiction in movies he's appeared somewhat rarely in novels. Maybe the problem has been deciding whether Earp was a hero or a villain. Robert B. Parker, the creator of the Spenser detective series, has taken the refreshing view that Earp was a man long before he was a symbol and has written GUNMAN'S RHAPSODY (Putnam, $22.95), a swift-moving, satisfying novel about Earp's controversial two years in Arizona. It's a novel that shows surprising fidelity to most of the known facts without letting them get in the way of a good story. Parker's strengths here, as in his crime novels, are plot and dialogue. In ''Gunman's Rhapsody'' he has a terrific ready-made story in the events that led to the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and its bloody aftermath of revenge, and he creates a spare Western vernacular that gets to the truth in a hurry. Wyatt and his older brother Virgil converse in a kind of shorthand in which silences are as meaningful as words. ''She ain't much,'' Virgil says of Wyatt's common-law wife, the doomed, alcoholic Mattie. ''No,'' Wyatt says, ''she ain't.'' ''Still, you took up with her.'' ''Yep.'' Parker's Wyatt knows more than he says and seldom says all he knows; only Josephine Marcus, the beautiful young Jewish actress from San Francisco (and Sheriff John Behan's fiance) has his number. ''Did you plan to collar me?'' asks the seductive Josephine when Wyatt drops by, ostensibly looking for suspects. ''Well, yes,'' replies Wyatt, ''in a manner of speaking.'' Then, we read, ''She walked right up to him and put her body against his and raised her face and said in the softest voice imaginable, 'I'll go peacefully.' '' Allen Barra",2001-07-15T05:00:00+0000

But for Mr. Humphreys, summer days at the Jersey Shore have been a busboy's holiday. The business management professor becomes a businessman, the owner of Springer's Homemade Ice Cream in Stone Harbor. The lines along Third Avenue into the clapboard building jammed between a convenience store and an Italian restaurant sometimes stretch for a block. But few complain, since the end result is the ice cream Mr. Humphreys, his wife, Barbara, and their three adult children make by hand daily. From recipes for 65 flavors, the Humphreys choose as many as four dozen to offer each day. For $2 a generous scoop, the creamy Springer's version is a bit lighter than the ultra-butterfatted vogue of recent years. The Humphreys all live the rest of the year in Virginia, where Mr. Humphreys has taught at Virginia Commonwealth University and Longwood College. ''But we're here in Stone Harbor by choice,'' said Mary Humphreys, who has scooped at Springer's since age 7, when her parents bought Springer's and its recipes from Jack Fitzpatrick. ''Dad constantly said he wanted to buy it if he was selling, and finally, he did.'' The business, they believe, started during Prohibition, as one proprietor's change from the bar trade. A favorite flavor, Springer Chip, comes from the Fitzpatrick's era. ''Oh, that was a mistake,'' Mary Humphreys said. ''Someone put chocolate chips in coffee instead of vanilla. But it's been a huge hit ever since, so we don't change back.'' Robert Strauss",2001-07-15T05:00:00+0000

Finally, Mr. Lewis lionizes the chicken who valiantly tried to save her brood of chicks from an attacking hawk. ''I wanted to show how you could never call a chicken a coward,'' said Mr. Lewis, who grew up on a farm in Australia. ''In spite of the fact that the chicken has been domesticated, it still has a natural history like any other animal.

The store buyers dismissed his offering as a flash in the pan, when in fact it was a visionary look at what would happen 40 years later. Givenchy soon fell under the spell of Balenciaga and Audrey Hepburn, and abandoned his separates. Today, designers have revived variations on the Bettina blouse, often in diaphanous organdy.

This was not an ordinary operation. As director of Moscow's State Jewish Theater and chairman of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC), which played a prominent role in Soviet propaganda efforts against Hitler during World War II, Mikhoels had earned an international reputation. But with the onset of the Cold War and the impending creation of Israel, Stalin came to suspect Mikhoels's loyalties. Dispatched to Minsk ostensibly to review a play for the Stalin Prize, Mikhoels was lured from his hotel and taken to the country house of Lavrenti Tsanava, head of the Belorussian security services, where he was summarily killed. His body was left in the snow along a quiet street, where, in the morning, workers discovered him. Mikhoels's death was declared the result of a traffic accident. To complete the camouflage, he was honored with a state funeral. ",2001-07-15T05:00:00+0000

us,The Wound and the Historian,"The historian Joseph J. Ellis's chief accomplishment to date is restoring John Adams to his rightful status as America's most human founding father. Adams, before Ellis, had been relegated for nearly two centuries to the sidelines, a fat and unlikable conservative overshadowed by George Washington, a god; Benjamin Franklin, a wit; and Thomas Jefferson, a visionary. The fault was largely Adams's. As Ellis explains in ''Passionate Sage: The Character and Legacy of John Adams'' (1993), our second president was a man of enormous wisdom and ingrained skepticism who grasped better than any other American the need for checks and balances in government and the likely horrors of the French Revolution. He was also abrasive, tempestuous, candid to the point of obnoxiousness, touchy about his place in history, paranoid and unstatesmanlike. He had a way of undercutting his presidential persona with sarcastic self-deprecation or temper tantrums. A proud descendant of Puritans, he thought public relations were corrupt, so instead he did himself harm. But Ellis managed to dig Adams most of the way out from under dirt he'd heaped upon his own head -- enough, anyway, so that David McCullough, America's best-selling presidential hagiographer, read ''Passionate Sage'' and was moved to write his own Adams book.",2001-07-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Metro Briefing," NEW YORK MINEOLA: EVICTION CODE LIKELY TO BE SOFTENED The Nassau County Legislature has approved a bill that would soften what critics say is an overly harsh eviction code. In the past, landlords placed evicted tenants' possessions on the sidewalk, a practice that the village of Hempstead challenged on the ground that it violated a local anti-littering law. The new bill, which the Legislature passed Monday and which the county executive is expected to sign, would require that landlords move tenants' belongings into storage and pay for 30 days of storage. Martin A. Shlufman, a lawyer for the Apartment House Council of Nassau County, a coalition of apartment building owners, said many of his members were unhappy with the measure but were not likely to fight it. &#0160;&#0160;Elissa Gootman (NYT) ALBANY: PESTICIDE USE DECLINES The use of chemicals by businesses, excluding farms, to kill insects and weeds was down significantly in New York State in 1999, according to final figures for the year released by the State Department of Environmental Conservation. About 20.9 million pounds and 2.4 million gallons of pesticides and herbicides were applied in 1999, down from 23.9 million pounds and 3.6 million gallons in 1998. Leading users were Suffolk County, with 2.1 million pounds and 373,000 gallons, and Brooklyn, with nearly 2.1 million pounds and 97,000 gallons. The state health commissioner, Dr. Antonia Novello, said the reduction would help protect drinking-water supplies. &#0160;&#0160;(AP) QUEENS: TRANSIT WORKER ELECTROCUTED A transit worker died early yesterday after he tripped and fell onto the electrified third rail of a subway track in Queens, New York City Transit said.

The design by Gary Shoemaker Architects of Manhattan calls for walls of luminous channel glass. Mr. McCarthy's company will join 200 businesses, 52 of them design related, at the yard. Ice Stone will be produced in polished panels that are as large as 4 by 8 feet, or in smaller tile sizes. It is made of bits of glass that have been reclaimed from the tons of glass destined for landfills each year in this country. They are then added to a cement-based mixture engineered not to crack. A computer-controlled pigment system offers thousands of colors. Mr. McCarthy expects Ice Stone to be available this fall starting at $25 a square foot. ''New York developers will be very keen on this,'' he said. ''Building with locally manufactured, sustainable materials gets them tax credits from the state.''

Yesterday's ruling, by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, clears the way for Napster to resume service, but people close to the company said it had not yet decided when to go back online. The Redwood City, Calif., company took the service down on July 1 to upgrade technology used to filter files of copyrighted music. Napster had planned to resume service last week, asserting in court that it could filter at 99 percent effectiveness, but Judge Marilyn Patel of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ruled that the service must remain down until it proved it could be more effective still. In appealing the ruling, Napster asserted that the standard set by Judge Patel was impossible to meet. The Ninth Circuit granted a temporary stay, and said it would review Napster's appeal further before issuing a final order later, meaning the court could still uphold Judge Patel's ruling.

us,The Invisible Grand Central,"Grand Central Terminal is celebrated for its Beaux-Arts style, but Kurt C. Schlichting looks behind the facade to see the hidden engineering marvels in GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL: Railroads, Engineering, and Architecture in New York City (Johns Hopkins, $26.50). Completed in 1913 at a cost of about $42 million (the equivalent of more than $750 million today), the terminal had more functions than a Swiss Army knife, seamlessly combining subways, commuter rail and long-distance rail lines. Grand Central's story is also one of cover-ups and conspiracies. William J. Wilgus, the chief engineer of the New York Central Railroad, was responsible for the station's innovative double-level system and for electrifying the trains, but left under a cloud after destroying evidence that the railroad company knew of an engine problem that led to a disastrous crash in the Bronx in 1907, in which 25 passengers were killed. Whitney Warren, the architect who designed Grand Central's celebrated Grand Concourse and facade, schemed to have the commission taken away from the firm of Reed & Stern, which was a partner in the project, and was ultimately booted out of the American Institute of Architects. Schlichting, a sociologist at Fairfield University, has a better feel for the engineering of the station than its architecture, and his prose is often as stultifying as reading a timetable, but the book will deepen anyone's appreciation for New York's most magnificent interior space.

For the state's vegetable crops, such as peppers, corn, tomatoes and lima beans, the year started slow with dry, cold weather but has improved since then.

This month, Dover Publications is releasing two new collections of paper dolls, which engage in sartorial satire of the 60's and 70's and are intended for grown-ups who never quite kicked the snip-and-fit habit. In ''Rock 'n' Pop Stars of the 60's,'' music and fashion buffs can choose from 16 dolls, including representations of James Brown, Roy Orbison, Joan Baez, Diana Ross, Mick Jagger and Cher (with and without Sonny). Film enthusiasts can slice into ''Glamorous Movie Stars of the 70's,'' outfitting the likes of Faye Dunaway, Goldie Hawn, Ann-Margret, Meryl Streep, Sally Field and Susan Sarandon. Each movie star comes dressed in her skivvies and can be changed into two outfits, plus accessories: for instance, vests and ties for Diane Keaton's ''Annie Hall'' look and a bowler hat for Liza Minnelli's ''Cabaret'' act. The dolls may be slightly more kitschy than chic, but from a fashion standpoint it's hard not to wish that Dover had printed Ms. Dunaway, Ms. Hawn and Ann-Margret, and called it a day (or, for that matter, a decade). The cutout books are $5.95 each at www.doverpublications.com.",2001-07-22T05:00:00+0000

An expert in the commercial paper field, he led the marketing of German dollar bonds in the 1930's. Contacts Mr. Sherman made during this period provided the base of his aggressive help to the German Jewish community. He was personally involved in helping the escape of innumerable Jews and funneling funds to those in need. He was forced to end these activities in 1939, but his commitment to the Jewish community continued for the balance of his business career. At the start of WWII, he was recruited for the OSS, and after the war was involved in the reestablishment of the German banking system. Irv Sherman is survived by his loving wife of close to 60 years, Marie Vandeputte Sherman; two stepchildren, Richard Barzin of Marco Island, FL and Lora Childs of Spring Island, SC; a niece, Dr. Ruth Pike of State College, PA; a grand-nephew, Dr. Carl Pike; 7 grandchildren; 7 greatgrandchildren; and 2 great greatgrandchildren. A memorial service will be held at the Cornell Club-NY on July 30 at 5 PM. Gifts may be made to the Sherman Scholarship Fund at Cornell University, 55 Brown Rd., Ithaca, NY 14850, or United Jewish Appeal.",2001-07-24T05:00:00+0000

Of Blue Hill, ME, a retired advertising agency executive, former weekly newspaper publisher and avid fisherman-not necessarily in that order-died Saturday, July 21, at the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor of complications from a stroke. He was stricken a month earlier while on a fishing trip to Canada. Jim was born in New York City on May 15, 1922, the son of John and Marie McCaffrey of Scarsdale, N.Y. He was educated at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., & was enrolled at Princeton University when he as stricken with polio at the age of 19. Despite surviving with only limited mobility in his left leg and none at all in his right, McCaffrey nevertheless completed his education at Princeton, graduating with honors in 1944, and was headed for law school at Harvard University when he took a summer job in the mailroom of Young and Rubicam, then the second largest advertising agency in the world. He was bitten by the advertising bug and told Harvard ''the law will have to do without me.'' In 1945, Jim met a young woman named Virginia (''Geegee'') Given on the beach of Fire Island and the two were marrid the following year. While she continued working as an editor for ''Glamour Magazine'' and ''House Garden Magazine'', he quickly worked his way up the advertising ladder to become an account executive, first at Young and Rubicam and then at Ogilvy and Mather. In 1962, he joined forces with David B. McCall to purchase an agency called C.J. LaRoche and Co. Thus was born the firm of McCaffrey and McCall, Inc. The company became one of New York's preeminent advertising agencies over the next two decades. Over his career, Jim worked with such clients as Rolls Royce, J.C. Penney, Bacardi Rum, Helena Rubenstein, Pepperidge Farm, Hathaway Shirt, Norelco and ABC Television. Jim served as the agency's chairman of the board for the next 10 years, also ascending to the presidency of the 4A's (American Association of Advertising Agencies). He retired in 1973 at the age of 50 to move with Geegee to a Castine, ME farm overlooking the Bagaduce River. Once in Castine, Jim quickly became involved in the community. He was an active member of Our Lady of Holy Hope Catholic Church and a founder of the volunteer Bagaduce Ambulance Corps, which continues to serve Castine and surrounding towns today. Jim also played a major role in Castine's ''revolt'' against a state uniform property tax, helping lead a successful statewide effort to repeal the unpopular tax. In 1976, he made an aggressive bid to represent Hancock County in the Main Senate. Opting to run as an independent, without party affiliation or support, Jim nevertheless garnered more than 4,000 votes in a four-way race that was won by the Republican incumbent. In 1980, he embarked on a career as a newspaper publisher, teaming with editor Hugh Bowden to launch the weekly Castine Patriot, serving the towns of Castine, Orland, Penobscot and Brooksville. Jim's strong and thoughtful viewpoints appeared each week in well-crafted editorials, each carefully written in longhand, that became the talk of the community. Though the newspaper has seen several owners since Jim sold it in 1982, it continues to flourish today. Jim had a keen mind and fiery temper and did not suffer fools gladly. But he was also sensitive, articulate and could be loyal almost to a fault. Partner David McCall said of him on his retirement, ''Jim has never hurt a fellow human being in his life. Jim not only treats everyone equally, he literally can't see any difference between the president of General Motors and the window washer-unless one of them is an ass.'' The McCaffrey's sold their Castine farm in 1997 and became residents of Parker Ridge, a retirement community in Blue Hill, ME. For more than 50 years, Jim was an avid fisherman in Maine, Canada and the Bahamas. His fishing partner and 55-year partner in life was always his wife. Regarding his stroke and ultimate death, Geegee commented to friends about their most recent trip to Canada: ''Jim caught a 10pound salmon before he had other things to do.'' And no one knows his no-holds-barred dedication to tomorrow better than she. In addition to his wife, Jim is survived by a daughter, Anne (''Nancy'') McCaffrey Rathmell of Belfast; and three granddaughters, Meghan Rathmell of Hollis, Erin Rathmell of West Tisbury, Mass., and Katharine Rathmell of Exeter, N.H. A funeral mass will be held Friday, July 27, at 10 A.M. at Our Lady of Holy Hope Catholic Church in Castine. Following interment in the Castine Cemetery, a celebration of Jim's life will be held in the dining room at Parker Ridge from noon to 4 P.M.

Officials at the American Civil Liberties Union, which joined her in the lawsuit and announced the outcome, said they strongly disagreed with the finding. The home receives financing from Kentucky, and the A.C.L.U. had argued that religious organizations that receive taxpayer financing should not be allowed to discriminate.

In essence, that's what the French architect Rgis Pan told the chemists when he was developing a new display material for the MAC SoHo experimental store, inset below, set to open next month. ''I asked myself, 'How can we incorporate skin and body into architecture?' '' he said. His answer was a stabilized polyurethane that quivers like Jell-O but has a pleasant skinlike texture. The resulting free-standing displays, on modular cabinets, have been shaped into sensuous ridges, mountains, swales and terraces to hold lipsticks, eye shadows, brushes and powders. Molds for the displays were created by two computer-controlled laser beams, a process known as stereolithography. Mr. Pan, 32 (inset far right), is executive director of store design for all 400 MAC stores. For this experimental store (another will be built in Japan), he created mirrors, above, which look like half grapefruits, and he used Globlow Lamps by the Swedish company Snowcraft, which inflate to give a soft, white light. He also designed a display floor ''sink'': a square with a nib in the center, which releases a steady stream of water. Customers who have been fingering the lip gloss can wash their hands by wiping them against the wiggly block. ''It's a couture way to look at a store,'' said James Gager, creative director worldwide for MAC. ''It's not a concept for everybody. We wouldn't be putting this in the Midwest.''

Whether in fanatic support of her Yankees or in political debate, Joan was an indefatigable champion of whom and what she loved. Joan was smart funny-and you challenged her positions at your own risk. Her physical and mental energy and her love of language led to a distinguished career in journalism. She began her writing and producing career at the NBC Washington Bureau, followed by WRC Radio, and then moved to New York to join ABC Radio, followed by ABCTV's World News Tonight and World News Now. Since 1997, she worked as a senior writer for Tom Brokaw at NBC Nightly News. Ultimately Joan's fine sense memory and love of reading called her to shift her focus to fiction. In the last two years she was writing a novel based loosely on the life of her maternal grandparents. Her family and friends will forever miss her humor, smile, passion, loyalty and inexhaustible love.

The church bought the property, on the corner of Wilson and Reservoir Streets, for $67,500 (it did not buy the bar's liquor license) and immediately closed the bar's doors. Union Baptist is negotiating with the City of Trenton and one private property owner to acquire several properties adjacent to the former bar, hoping to renovate all of them and reopen them as a youth services center. The Rev. Simeon D. Spencer, Union Baptist Church's Pastor, recently spoke in the now quiet lounge.",2001-07-29T05:00:00+0000

''He has a reporter's eye, an affectionate ear for everyday speech and . . . a Dickensian storyteller's facility,'' Timothy Foote wrote here last year. Touchstone has also reissued Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen: Reflections at Sixty and Beyond ($12), a collection of personal essays in which McMurtry recalls his Texas childhood and laments what he sees as his failure to ''subvert'' some grand fallacies about the West.

us,Wolfgang's Sister,"The subject of Sharon Chmielarz's virtuoso new poetry collection, THE OTHER MOZART (Ontario Review Press/Norton, $21.95), was a classical music prodigy, called ''a little master'' of the art, who performed for royal 18th-century audiences. But this Mozart -- Maria Anna, nicknamed Nannerl -- is remembered mostly for being the older sister, by four years, of Wolfgang Amadeus. Nannerl was a budding composer as well as a performer; her own extraordinary career ended at 18, when the children's ambitious father, Leopold, foresaw that Wolfgang, as a boy, would enjoy a far more lucrative career, and poured all the family resources into making him a star. Drawing heavily from the Mozart family's letters, Chmielarz creates a marvelously effective fusion of biography and poetry: 65 lyric poems tell an engrossing chronological story while standing on their own for their elegant language and lending rich musicality and imaginative license to their subject. In an array of free verse styles, a chorus of distinctive voices speak: from patriarch Leopold, with his gruff odes to wealth (''Money is / the point of music'') to boyish, headstrong Wolfgang (''what else, Nannerl . . . could I have done?''). But Nannerl's deftly modulating voice is the lead, by turns funny, frustrated, ribald, joyous and bitter, as she plainly recognizes that, for Wolfgang, she is ''a tax on his conscience.'' She ultimately teaches music (''A note is a shard / Of a thought''), falls in love and adapts to an unhappy marriage of convenience (''my first-born planted like a talent''). Ultimately, the collection's scope and sophisticated artistry resemble a symphony's, and the tone struck is movingly elegiac. Megan Harlan",2001-07-29T05:00:00+0000

Today it is worth about $11 billion. Most of its competitors -- including such giants as Agilent, Alcatel, Corning, Lucent and Nortel -- have also plunged in value. The excessive optimism that boosted share prices is only partly to blame. A slow-developing, less-than-competitive market for consumer communications also blocked the way.

It is a store to which he and his family -- his wife, Maria; his sons, John Jr. and Sal; and his daughter, Anna Maria -- commute each day from Staten Island.

When it opened in the summer of 1963, the film was as notorious for its extravagant production costs as for the tumultuous affair between Burton and Ms. Taylor that had begun on the set. On screen, the machinations in Roman and Egyptian high places had their moments, but artistically ""Cleopatra"" was swallowed by its gilded pavilions.

Wynn as public-private partnership that would provide a direct auto route to a proposed casino in Atlantic City's Marina District.

A few weeks ago, on April 23, 1932, Madame lay dying in an obscure hotel in Amsterdam, asking for her swan costume. &quot;Play the last measure softly,&quot; she whispered to the friends who stood around her, the newspaper headlines quoted. No sooner did she pass away, as she lay still warm in her coffin, than her husband, Victor Dandr&#233;, was speeding toward London in search of the marriage license which would assure him of his inheritance: magnificent Ivy House, the mansion surrounded by English gardens and a lake full of swans that once belonged to the painter William Turner and which Madame had purchased with her savings. But I knew he'd never find it. I had destroyed the license, a yellowed parchment written in Cyrillic characters, years before. When I read the article I was overwhelmed with recollections.

The album was, among other things, a Beatles post-mortem; its title and stark black-and-white cover photograph of Mr. Harrison -- long hair, long face, a solitary figure in the garden of a country estate -- sent a clear message: the Beatles are gone, the 60's are over, the vibes are bad.",2001-07-29T05:00:00+0000

''We are ending tobacco growing, but beginning a new era of farming that will produce new life-sustaining crops,'' Gov. Parris N. Glendening said. Each year for a decade, the program will offer farmers who agree not to grow tobacco $1 for each pound they grew in 1998.
