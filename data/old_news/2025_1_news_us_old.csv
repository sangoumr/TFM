We Want What Were Due for a Delay.,"Last March, my daughter and I were headed from Berlin, where she was studying, to Italy for her spring break. Our 8:50 p.m. Ryanair flight to Rome was delayed for several hours and eventually postponed to the next morning at 6 a.m. We were given the address of a hotel and told we would be reimbursed for it, as well as transportation and meals, according to European air passenger protections. The hotel was full, so we found an alternative nearby for 61 euros. As a backup plan in case our flight was canceled, I reserved a second Flexi Plus Ryanair flight for the next evening, for $908 total, that would allow us to postpone for a future date as long as we rescheduled up to 2.5 hours before departure. Our original flight did take off at around 9 a.m., so when we finally got to Rome, we tried and tried for two hours to rebook the backup flight for another trip in May on the Ryanair app, but the confirm changes button just wouldnt work. So I got in line for customer service chat  I was number 200  but the app eventually quit on me. I then called Ryanair, but the agent told me that to reschedule the flight by phone would cost 180 euros. I declined and decided take it up with the airline again  and file for expenses  when I got home. Neither went well. I got what appeared to be an automated (nonsensical) response about the app fiasco. And the reimbursement form Ryanair has online required I submit my bank account information with an IBAN code  which American banks dont have. When I wrote in to ask about alternatives, what also must have been an automated response ignored what I wrote and directed me back to the same form, twice. I believe Ryanair owes me about 100 euros for the hotel, taxi and meal, plus a flight for two from Berlin to Rome. Can you help? Tere, Wellesley, Mass.",2025-01-03T10:00:47+0000

British Airways Destroyed Our Guitar and Wont Pay Up.,"Im a co-owner of Luaka Bop, a New York-based record label, and last June was accompanying the Staples Jr. Singers, a gospel group from Aberdeen, Miss., on a European tour. For a British Airways flight from London to Paris, three musicians were required to check their guitars, but only one instrument arrived in Paris with us. We filled out the forms and tried to impress upon the employee the importance of getting the guitars before the groups show the next night. One of the two lost guitars did make it to Paris the next day, but British Airways couldnt or wouldnt deliver it, so our tour manager took a cab to the airport only to find it had closed. When the group returned to Britain by train, it was still down two guitars. We got one back a few shows later, and eventually found the other one at Heathrow Airport lost and found  with its neck snapped off and its case destroyed. We ended up with over $5,000 in expenses, which included renting guitars for a dozen shows and purchasing a guitar and case (both used) for Arceola Brown, the musician whose instrument was destroyed. We submitted most receipts with the original claim to British Airways on July 25, then added a few more on Aug. 7 and Sept. 11, for a total of $3,331. (We didnt keep receipts for the rest.)

us,New Takes on a Classic Taiwanese Treat,"In Domestic Bliss, a tenderly realized portrait of American life in the 1990s at Alexander Berggruen gallery in New York, the artist Stephanie Shih draws us into a fraught family narrative. The ceramic objects on view play various roles in the interior drama: Cigarette butts and a crushed beer can signal temptations acquiesced to; the complete Buns of Steel workout series on VHS and Suzanne Somerss ThighMaster offer proof of an investment in personal improvement. Viagra tablets point to lust, perhaps hope. Frozen dinners  one for each member of the titular Nuclear Family  sit atop a white Panasonic microwave oven, suggesting an uneasy coexistence. On an ironing board, an iron keeps company with the paperback bodice-ripper Prisoner of My Desire. The book that inspired this body of work? 1998s Divorce for Dummies, which Shih has rendered here as part of a self-help library. The artist builds the pieces by hand, using a fine brush to decorate their surfaces. There are subtle signs that each object is handmade, evoking the crafted pop sensibility of Corita Kent or Liza Lou  a slightly dappled finish here, a hint of hand lettering there. The net result is the uncanny feeling that the whole room has been seen, recorded, lost, then lovingly recreated, each element conjured by a human being with a memory that aches. Stephanie H. Shih: Domestic Bliss is on view at Alexander Berggruen, New York, from Jan. 22 through Feb. 26, alexanderberggruen.com.",2025-01-23T11:03:48+0000
