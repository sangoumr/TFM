us,The BP-Spill Baby-Turtle Brigade," Loggerhead nesting season started this year, as usual, in May. Across the northeastern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, female sea turtles began plodding out of the water and up the beach, each burying a clutch of a hundred or more leathery eggs beneath the sand. The eggs incubate for about 60 days. Then a throng of tiny black loggerhead hatchlings, each only about two inches long, frantically boils out of the ground, all paddling clumsily with their outsize, winglike flippers. They scuttle down the beach en masse, capitalizing on a one-time frenzy of energy to rush into the water and push past the breakers into offshore currents. Once they make it there  if they make it there  they typically find their way onto mats of seaweed called sargassum. The hatchlings will drift passively around the ocean on this sargassum for the first several years of their lives, like children inner-tubing in a swimming pool.

And it has been in print ever since, becoming at one point a fixture in the office of architects like Richard Meier, whose books and Web site are also designed by the legendary Vignelli. I wouldnt do anything without Massimo, Meier insisted. We both resolve ideas with a grid. For Vignelli  who, with his wife and partner in Vignelli Associates, Lella, is also known for designs like New York Citys 1972 subway map and stacked plastic dinnerware for Heller, and who co-designed the just-opened Vignelli Center for Design Studies at the Rochester Institute of Technology  the calendar is an exercise in white space (or black; random pages of the calendars are reverse-printed). For us, the space outside the type is more important than the type itself, he said. Vignelli also designed a smaller version of the calendar, which he wishes were still in production. Some people dont have room for the large one, he explained. But no matter: even if Vignelli doesnt receive royalties for it, hes happy that the big calendar is still in print.

His subject matter is the built environment of urban alienation: underground passageways, chain-link fencing, the sterile Modernist high-rise buildings that are home to so many immigrants in European cities. Ouadahis almost pretty color palette makes his screen-like, gridded high-rise facades seem seductive, until you realize that beyond them is a barren, depopulated landscape. His precisely rendered, claustrophobic tiled passages would make Kafka break out in a sweat, and his delicate depictions of chain link cover the canvas to its edges, suggesting a net that leaves no way out.

Florida, while undefeated, has looked a little sluggish in the first few weeks of the post-Tim Tebow era; Texas appeared lethargic in losing to a seemingly unimposing U.C.L.A. team in Austin last week; and Stanford has developed into a top-10 team behind an explosive offense led by quarterback Andrew Luck. All that means that Stanford at Oregon has become perhaps the most intriguing game of the weekend, with the Cardinal traveling to the always raucous atmosphere of Autzen Stadium to try to prove that they belong in the top tier of the Pac-10. As for Florida, every team in college football wishes they could struggle as well as the Gators. Still, Alabama has been No. 1 since the seasons start and the return of Mark Ingram two weeks ago has made a terrific running game that much more formidable. These teams have been the class of the Southeastern Conference for several years and there is always a chance for an epic game when they play each other. ",2010-10-01T22:17:18+0000

That result, while easily enough for No. 1, put the film, directed by David Fincher from a script by Aaron Sorkin, on par with recent releases like The Town, which opened with significantly less attention from the news media. Even though it didnt break any records, The Social Network is going to maintain healthy receipts in the weeks to come, said Phil Contrino, editor of BoxOffice.com. The Social Network, which received positive reviews but a slightly less rapturous response in audience exit polls, is considered an early Oscar favorite. Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of GaHoole (Warner Brothers) was second with $10.9 million for a new total of $30 million. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (20th Century Fox) was third with $10.1 million for a total of $35.9 million. The Town (Warner) was fourth with $10 million, bringing its total to $64.3 million.

In 2009, faced with a $40 billion shortfall in the budget through mid-2010, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger put in place three days a month of mandatory, unpaid furlough for some 200,000 state workers. Employee unions quickly filed multiple lawsuits contending that the governor did not have authority to issue involuntary furloughs. On Monday, the states highest court unanimously upheld the governors legal right to furlough workers through June 30 of this year, saying that the State Legislature had approved such cost-saving measures in last years budget legislation. The ruling comes as legislators and the governor say they have reached an agreement on a budget that is three months overdue, the longest budget impasse in the states history. Until details of the deal are released, which is expected to be Wednesday, it is unclear if this years budget will permit state worker furloughs to continue.",2010-10-05T04:34:16+0000

But these molecules are highly reactive and capricious, sometimes attacking other cells and damaging tissue. Wilding free radicals have been linked with a number of diseases and with aging. Exercise, because it requires increased oxygen consumption, also increases the production of free radicals. So, many experts began urging the fitness-minded to pop large doses of antioxidant vitamin supplements, like vitamins C and E, to counteract the presumed damaging effects of the free radicals. Food alone would not supply sufficient levels of the necessary antioxidants, it was thought. The exercising body needed help from vitamins.",2010-10-06T04:01:06+0000

The main ingredients: one whole goat from the McCormack Ranch in Rio Vista, Calif.; several crates of seasonal produce (and a case of olive oil) from Hudson Ranch in Napa; a basket of morels and porcini gathered near Mount Shasta; an assortment of spices from Boulettes Larder in San Francisco; and a couple of cases of wine from Kermit Lynch in Berkeley. The setting: a shady backyard in Napa (but picture suburban subdivision, not vineyard estate), where a big country table stretches out beneath the canopy of a mulberry tree. The cast: three accomplished Bay Area chefs (Mike and Jenny Emanuel  whose kitchen and backyard weve commandeered for the weekend  and Melissa Fernandez), one gifted baker (Chad Robertson), one jack of all culinary trades (Anthony Tassinello) and two amateurs (me and my 17-year-old son, Isaac). The guests: all of the above, plus a rotating crew of spouses, children, friends and neighbors. The fire: almond, oak and mulberry logs burning in a cob oven that Mike Emanuel built with the help of some friends in 2006. A cob, or earth, oven is a primitive, domed cooking device that can be made from layers of mud, clay, straw, stucco, even manure; the earthy mixture, the cob, can endure much higher heat, and hold it much longer, than an indoor oven can.

Inspired by a porcelain pot of lip stain used for kabuki actors that Nars found in Japan 10 years ago, the set of two cups of hand-poured color comes in a handsome wooden box with a wisteria-handled lip brush. Ive always been fascinated with the concept of kabuki makeup, Nars says. Its about symbolism and using color to create drama. The lipstick application is as seductive as its presentation. You dip the brush into the cup, around the perimeter, to pick up product, and simply paint, he says. Its a beautiful process. Unless you want to look like a Japanese theater character, however, Nars recommends using a little restraint: Its highly pigmented, so I suggest starting out light and building for desired intensity. It seems intimidating, but the texture is creamy and light and will move easily. The set will be available for $125 beginning November 1 at Saks Fifth Avenue and Barneys New York, or go to narscosmetics.com/bento to pre-order. ",2010-10-07T16:23:30+0000

us,"In Relief, Yankees Bullpen Lines Up Just Right","MINNEAPOLIS  As he so often has in the past, Mariano Rivera recorded the most important out in the Yankees Game 1 victory Wednesday night. Getting Denard Span to ground out with two on and two out in the eighth inning improved the Yankees win probability by 13 percent, according to baseball-reference.com, to 92 percent over all.Their second most important out came from someone whose brightest career postseason moment also came against the Twins in last years American League division series. Derek Jeter started calling Dave Robertson Houdini last year after he escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the 11th inning of Game 2.This time, Robertson was asked to get only one out, but what an out it was, striking out Jim Thome and thwarting a two-on, two-out rally in the seventh. Robertson threw three straight curve balls to Thome. The second dropped over the plate for a called second strike. The third bounced in front of the plate and drew a feeble swing.That was a beautiful sequence, Alex Rodriguez said. He came with the fastball then threw him three nasty breaking balls.Omitting a second left-handed reliever was a calculated risk by Joe Girardi, who, with left-handed starters set to pitch in four of five games, figured that Boone Logan would be sufficient to navigate through Joe Mauer, Thome and Jason Kubel. To start the seventh, Girardi went with Logan, who got two outs but gave way to Robertson after Mauer singled.The Yankees had seven more outs to get, but the bullpen was set up almost perfectly. Kerry Wood matched up well with the bottom of the Twins order, which had right-handed hitters in three of four slots, and the Yankees never have to worry about matchups when Rivera came in. Every one is in Riveras favor.If a save situation arises again Thursday, Girardi will obviously turn to Rivera again, though he was uncertain whether he would ask him to pitch multiple innings for a second straight night. Riveras struggles last month began on Sept. 11, when he surrendered two ninth-inning runs in Texas, the night after working two innings, and Girardi said he was cognizant of a possible link.I would prefer not to do it tonight, but I said that last night, Girardi said.",2010-10-07T20:43:15+0000

Brennan granted more than 60 recorded interviews in chambers and gave Wermiel access to tens of thousands of pages of records, including case files, correspondence and the coveted case histories his clerks had prepared each term. Wermiel completed part of the book before Brennans death in 1997, then, as he explains, put the project aside. He came under criticism, most notably from Jeffrey Toobin of The New Yorker, for his unparalleled access to documents closed to other researchers and for what little he has managed to make of it. That was in 2004. In 2006, Wermiel brought Stern, of Congressional Quarterly, to the project and, their note continues, it was Stern who reorganized the vast amounts of material and drafted most of the chapters.",2010-10-08T15:56:42+0000

Sympathetic characters rock, a news release said, but we dig the nasty ones as well. Tonga cannot pony up the big bucks, the release also said. All advances will be in the four figures. Ms. Sebold, who has never been a book editor, said in a telephone interview that she was still a little stunned that she had agreed to the proposal from Sandro Ferri and his wife, Sandra, the founders and owners of Europa. She added that she hoped to attract first novelists as well as veteran writers who are having trouble getting published these days because their books dont sell a gazillion copies.

This year Warner was criticized by fans, media types and industry executives for releasing Clash of the Titans in a 3-D version that did not measure up to the expectations of some.

us,Secretariat Horses Learn Hollywoods Ways,"Its not easy being an innocent young horse in Hollywood. Just ask the five creatures who collectively played the title character in Secretariat. To film that drama, which arrived in theaters on Friday, Walt Disney Studios used a group of horses. One was better for close-ups. One was better for racing sequences. You get the idea. But none of them made it into the credits of the film. And while Disney divulged the names of two of the horses to reporters  Trolley Boy, a 6-year-old from Kentucky, and Longshot Max, a 7-year-old from Oklahoma  the studio refused to identify the other three. A case of equine inequality? Disney didnt put any of the horses in the credits, a studio spokeswoman explained, in the interest of time. It had been decided that the scroll could last only 4 minutes 30 seconds and there wasnt room for them. It sounds as if some horses needed better agents. As for the three mystery horses, the somewhat fuzzy explanation involves control. While a professional animal trainer, Rusty Hendrickson, has custody of Trolley Boy and Longshot Max, the other three  used primarily as racing doubles  were sold after filming. Disney, thinking only of the animals, perhaps, did not want the new owners to be able to exploit the horses potential celebrity for personal gain.",2010-10-08T22:18:23+0000

us,Nightclub Tradition Gets a Jolt Of Youth,"Stately grandeur and youthful intensity: the annual New York Cabaret Convention at the Rose Theater has never lacked for great ladies and refined gentlemen. But as for youth (performers under 50), it has always struggled to forge a credible connection between a nightclub tradition nearly done in by rock n roll and television and the idea of a future. This year was different. All it takes to demonstrate that somehow or other the tradition goes on is a couple of exceptional rising talents. And at the conventions opening-night gala on Thursday, two singers  T. Oliver Reid and Amanda King  leapt out from the pack. ",2010-10-08T22:54:06+0000

us,Weekly Pick Em: The Grind,"Last Saturday brought a wealth of marquee matchups, including Florida-Alabama, Stanford-Oregon and Texas-Oklahoma. At first glance, this weekend doesnt look as glitzy. But thats only because teams are now into the grind of conference play, where each week brings a familiar opponent and the chance to be lulled into complacency. Alabama has one of the more absurd conference schedules in recent memory, with South Carolina the first of six SEC opponents that will be coming off a bye week when they face the Tide. That will make the Tides road through the league that much more difficult. Florida will try to bounce back from being handled easily by Alabama when it faces Louisiana State in the Swamp. The Tigers, through a combination of good defense and horrendous clock management, are 5-0 but being treated like they are underachievers. A win against the Gators could give them some credibility. Elsewhere in Florida, Florida State and Miami will play the latest installment of a rivalry that was one of the best in college football over the last quarter century. While that rivalry has lost some of its luster, Michigan-Michigan State has gained some glitz thanks to the outsize performance of Denard Robinson this season. Coach Mark Dantonio is expected to return to the Spartans after missing two games after having a mild heart attack. In the Pac-10, Stanford is coming off a loss to Oregon and Southern California is hoping to prove that it still deserves to be considered one of the conferences top teams. There is plenty to be excited about now that conference play has started in earnest and the history and familiarity between teams always makes prognosticating that much more difficult. As always, if you agree, disagree or simply find the picks laughable, feel free to let us know. ",2010-10-08T22:57:17+0000

The artist, who died this year at the age of 98, accumulated all manner of tablecloths, napkins, clothing and bed linens  a lifetimes worth of material, really  which she began to cut up and reassemble into drawings in the mid-1990s.

In this context, the more than 70 pieces in Louise Bourgeois: The Fabric Works, an exhibition that aptly christens Hauser & Wirths new space on Savile Row in London, are as poignant as they are vibrant.

It can hold a 12- to 14-inch pizza in the oven, on a grill or on a stove top. It is glazed to make removing the pizza easy and, with its handles, can go to the table (on a trivet). All that is without discussing the designer colors: fig, black, red and olive. The technology is said to leave a certain porosity in the material so dough moisture is absorbed, making for a crisper crust. At 425 degrees in the oven, the crust browns nicely without overcooking the topping. The stone even doubles as a plancha on the grill, withstanding up to about 700 degrees. The maker says the pizza can be cut directly on it without damaging the surface. With some hesitation, I tried it. Not a scratch.",2010-10-12T22:44:35+0000

Fat, round golden zucchini? The goods are from local farms, notably from Brooklyn Grange in Queens, and Cato Corner Farm in Colchester, Conn., which also supplies cheeses and veal. Free-range eggs come by the half-dozen in mixed colors. The shelves hold a well-edited selection of staples and condiments, including decidedly unlocal but delicious chocolate bars from Montreal. Some prepared foods  from the kitchen that supplies the raw bar, salads and sandwiches for the informal dining area beyond the retail store  are also sold. Whos Jeffrey? Its Mr. Stulmans father.

The owners of the 110-story Willis Tower, formerly the Sears Tower, want to keep the sculpture, The Universe, in the lobby, and are asking a Cook County Circuit Court judge to block the buildings former owner, Sears, Roebuck & Company, from buying it. The two sides disagreed about whether a 1994 option agreement that would allow Sears to purchase the art for half its appraised value was still valid in July, when Sears notified the current owners, 233 S. Wacker LLC, of its intent to buy. (The original agreement includes a clause terminating the option to buy upon the sale or transfer of the legal title to the tower property.) The Universe is 33 feet tall, 55 feet wide and weighs about 16,000 pounds; the plaintiffs lawyer, George B. Collins, said it would cost around $250,000 to move the sculpture. But we dont plan to move it, Mr. Collins said. We plan to win the case. Kim Freely, a spokeswoman for Sears, declined to comment.",2010-10-13T22:33:22+0000

Right now, the world is evenly divided between those under 28 and those over 28. By midcentury, the median age will have risen to 40. Demographers also use another measure, in addition to median age, to determine whether populations are aging: elder share. If the share, or proportion, of people over 60 (or sometimes 65) is growing, the population is aging. By that yardstick too, the world is quickly becoming older. Pick any age cohort above the median age of 28 and youll find its share of the global population rising faster than that of any segment below the median. By 2018, 65-year-olds, for example, will outnumber those under 5  a historic first. In 2050, developed countries are on track to have half as many people under 15 as they do over 60. In short, the age mix of the world is turning upside down and at unprecedented rates.",2010-10-14T04:01:30+0000

In spite of the depth of the attachment that I feel to the city in which I have built my career, I am always aware that Milan does have its shortcomings and that it lies at times in thrall to a prevailing mood of melancholy, which has perhaps altered its character and diminished its sense of optimism, its capacity to think big and retain the confidence to accomplish its ambitions. As the Italian capital of financial activity and the world capital of fashion, design and opera, Milan derives its unique strength, I believe, from its capacity to promote a continuous flow of creative ideas and harness them into successful commercial ventures. I love this city most when its sense of discipline is evident, expressed through its citizens work ethic and ability to plan on a large scale. I also love its rational approach  one driven by passion and generosity. (Its no coincidence that Milan is the center of the nations charitable sector.) I hope that the optimism and the characteristic determination of the Milanese will provide a much-needed stimulus to the public sector, because the greater ones love for a city, the more one expects from it.

All of our designs refer back to 18th-century French and Italian furniture traditions, and to patterns and shapes found in nature. And so a slab of industrial iron becomes a filigreed room divider that is as intricate as it is commanding, and a hunk of maple found in an abandoned sawmill has a second life as a Baroque cabinet.

(I avoid stories set in prison for the same reason: guaranteed nightmares, often involving ferrets, a small cage and me.) In this case, however, I neednt have worried. Despite a surfeit of the genres requisite trappings (food rationing, secret police, universal surveillance, dopey government acronyms), Chalcot Crescent might be the least depressing  certainly its the most cheerful  dystopian fiction Ive ever come across, thanks to Weldons slashing wit and her refusal to suffer fools gladly, no matter how despotic. Even in a world without reliable electricity or real coffee, life worth living goes bumbling on.

Whether Bernhard Schlink, a lawyer as well as a novelist, found the right tone in The Reader, his best-selling 1995 novel about the love affair between an illiterate war criminal and an adolescent boy, is open to question.

How does it work, and is it a good idea?DISALVO: You can only add radiant heat if you intend to renovate your bathroom or at least replace the floor. Once you have the floor up, however, radiant-heat systems are easy to install. You have them on a thermostat, and they heat up and heat the floor, which is very comfortable. The downside is that it takes several hours for the floor to warm up, but once it does it eliminates the need for a radiator. WIENER: There are two kinds of systems. The water system uses plastic tubing with warm water. The electrical uses mats of electrical coils. Water is mostly not allowed in apartment buildings because of the potential for leaks. Both systems are good. DARDICK: I havent done a master bathroom in the last three years that did not have a heated floor. Everybody loves them. I dont know anyone who doesnt like them. But if you live in a cold-weather climate, a heated floor may not be the entire solution for heating a whole room.",2010-10-15T18:05:31+0000

In his 14 years as a lawyer, he worked first in Prague for Il Assicurazioni Generali (a Jewish-founded insurance company based in Trieste that featured a menorah in its lobby), the insurer for Workers Compensation in Austria-Hungary before World War I. Before and after the war, he toiled in the same field for the Workers Accident Insurance Institute, the government agency administering benefits for work injuries (no occupational diseases then). Kafkas projection of what Max Weber called the iron cage of bureaucracy was literally lifted from the admittedly boring and unsatisfying work at the compensation agency.

Im no great admirer of Barack Obamas policies, but some of the discontent swirling around the White House at the moment is the usual cult-of-the-presidency nonsense, in which the occupant of the Oval Office is held responsible for forces and events beyond his control, and everyone pretends that the world would be perfect if he werent so incompetent, so cowardly, or so evil.",2010-10-15T18:55:58+0000

The real new No. 1 is Ohio State, which faces its first true road test tomorrow night at Wisconsin. Camp Randall is always an intimidating atmosphere, but the Buckeyes hope Terrelle Pryor and a tough defense will be enough to overcome the Badgers stout running game. Auburn is one of the last two undefeated teams in the Southeastern Conference (Louisiana State is the other), but the Tigers looked shaky in beating Kentucky last week. They face a stiff challenge from Arkansas on Saturday. Nebraska knows what it feels like to fall from the heights of the Big 12, so the Cornhuskers could have some empathy for struggling Texas if they choose to. They probably wont though. Michigan is trying to bounce back from a loss to Michigan State, but is running right into an Iowa squad that would like to fight it out with Ohio State for Big Ten supremacy. Meanwhile, in the Pac-10, Oregon State is quietly looking to assert itself as one of the conferences top teams. It beat Arizona last week and will try to knock off a Washington squad that has already defeated Southern California. There is plenty to watch this week and much to predict.

us,A Revolutionary of Arabic Verse,"ANN ARBOR, Mich.  Every year around this time the name of the Syrian poet Adonis pops up in newspapers and in betting shops. Adonis (pronounced ah-doh-NEES), a pseudonym adopted by Ali Ahmad Said Esber in his teens as an attention getter, is a perennial favorite to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. This year Ladbrokes, the British bookmaking firm, had his chances at 8-1, which made him seem a surer bet than the eventual winner, Mario Vargas Llosa, a 25-1 long shot. Why Adonis appeals to the oddsmakers, presumably, is that hes a poet, and poets have been under-represented among Nobelists lately; that he writes in Arabic, the language of only one Nobel winner, Naguib Mahfouz; and that as is the case with so many recent winners, most Americans have never heard of him.",2010-10-17T22:04:04+0000

Jackass 3D, left, produced for $20 million by Paramount Pictures, surpassed expectations to sell an estimated $50 million at the weekend box office. As the third installment in the franchise, this picture was helped by premium-priced 3-D tickets. But it also benefited from an enormous promotional effort by MTV, Paramounts corporate sibling and the home of the Jackass television series. Jackass: The Movie, made in 2002 for $5 million, opened to about $28 million (after adjusting for inflation). Jackass Number Two, made for $12 million 2006, opened to an adjusted $31.4 million. Finishing second this weekend was the sharply more expensive RED, with John Malkovich, an adaptation of an obscure graphic novel. Summit Entertainment spent about $60 million to make RED, which took in about $22.5 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. The Social Network (Sony Pictures Entertainment) ranked third in its third weekend, selling about $11 million for a new total of $63 million. Secretariat (Walt Disney Studios) was fourth with $9.5 million ($27.5 million total). The romantic comedy Life as We Know It (Warner Brothers) was fifth with $9.2 million ($28.9 million total).",2010-10-17T22:21:10+0000
us,Orpheus Announces Commission Winners,"The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, which takes the populist view that musical interpretations can be shaped by the ensemble rather than by a conductor, has expanded on that concept in a commissioning program, Project 440. The orchestras goal was to commission four composers to help celebrate its 40th anniversary. Intent on getting its audience involved, it joined forces with WQXR, the New York classical radio station, which opened the process to its listeners. Orpheus and WQXR assembled a panel of more than 30 performers, composers and music executives, who nominated 60 composers. Listeners were invited to peruse the composers biographies, to listen to music clips on WQXRs Web site, wqxr.org, and to comment. The selection committee, taking listener comments into account, chose 30 semifinalists whose music was streamed for 24 hours on Q2, WQXRs Internet station. That marathon yielded 12 finalists, and 4 winners were announced at Orpheuss first New York concert of the season, on Thursday at Carnegie Hall. They are Alex Mincek, a New York composer; Clint Needham, who recently completed his doctorate at Indiana University; Andrew Norman of California; and Cynthia Lee Wong, who completed studies at Juilliard. At the concert Orpheus also introduced its new executive director, Ayden Adler.

us,Now Reading | The Finest Rooms,"Thomas Jayne, the New York decorator, has always brought both a scholarly knowledge of design history and a quirky sense of the modern to his work, creating rooms that bridge the old and the new. And even though there is none of Jaynes own work in his new book, The Finest Rooms in America (The Monacelli Press), his sensibility is evident in his choice of what the books subtitle calls fifty influential interiors from the 18th century to the present. (Full disclosure: I am mentioned in the books acknowledgments, along with a number of other magazine editors, but was not involved in the book.) Any conversation with Jayne on the subject of decorating invariably touches on his passion for great interiors of the past, and indeed, nearly half the rooms in this book are historic, although Jayne includes 20th-century interiors  like the living room of Frank Lloyd Wrights Hollyhock House and that of Charles and Ray Eamess house  in this category, along with 18th-century spaces like the Tea Room at Monticello or the Large Dining Room at Mount Vernon. But seeing his broad-ranging eye at work is part of the pleasure of reading Jaynes book. His selection of contemporary rooms wont please every decorator  particularly given the books somewhat loaded title, an homage to the famous 1964 volume The Finest Rooms by Americas Great Decorators, which included interiors by now-departed greats like Rose Cumming, Sister Parish and Billy Baldwin  but it is as catholic as his tastes. So youll find the more-is-more drawing room of the jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane and Robert Couturiers classically inspired dining room sharing the books pages with an elegantly spare living room by David Kleinberg and an edgy studio by Christopher Coleman. While many of the rooms are fairly grand in scale and furnishings, it is one of the smallest that that makes your heart beat faster: Albert Hadleys Manhattan intimate sitting room, an object lesson in understated chic, which Jayne rightly saves for last.

The inventor, a short, thick-set man, with grimy hands, led the way through his workshop, and willingly explained the distinctive features of what he and many others look upon as an apparatus which will soon cause gas-light to be a thing of the past. The lamp which Mr. Edison regards as a crowning triumph is a model of simplicity and economy. In the lamp the light is emitted by a horseshoe of carbonized paper about two and a half inches long and the width of a thread. This horseshoe is in a glass globe, from which the air has been as thoroughly exhausted as science is able to do. So good a vacuum is produced that it is estimated that at the utmost no more than a one-millionth part of the air remains. The operation of pumping lasts one hour and a quarter. At the ends of the carbon horseshoe are two platinum clamps, from which platinum wires run outwardly through a small glass tube contained within a larger one leading out of the glass globe. The small tube contains air. Within it the platinum wires are met by two copper wires connecting with the conductors of the electricity. The air is left in the small tube, because otherwise the copper wires would be fused by the electric current. The carbonized paper is capable of being made incandescent by a current of electricity, and while it allows the current to pass over it, its resistance to the heat is strong enough to prevent it from fusing.",2010-10-18T16:59:07+0000

The renowned fashion photographer, architect, clothing designer and musician has composed an opera, Anima, which will be performed on Tuesday in Naples at the Teatro di San Carlo (Europes oldest opera house, dating from 1737). Ferri was initially contacted by Rosanna Purchia, the theaters newly appointed sovrintendente, to create evocative imagery for the coming seasons performances. For the theaters first ever promotional campaign Ferri shot dance students from the Teatros school in the volcanic surroundings of Mt. Vesuvius, above. Ferri, who had also been working for almost a decade writing, orchestrating and recording the score for a musical film, happened to play a selection of songs for Purchia, who convinced him to turn his film-to-be into an opera for the newly revived theater. Anima, which means soul, tells the story of North African immigrants who left their homelands behind for a better life in Europe. The music envelops the people like the sea, Ferrisays, sometimes soothing, like a mother or father, and sometimes angry and dangerous. An 80-person choir, a 50-person childrens choir and an 80-piece orchestra will be joined by some gifted friends of Ferri: the trumpeter Chris Botti, who also contributed recordings for the original score; Andrea Griminelli, a world-famous flautist; and Gil Goldstein, an orchestrator. (A surprise appearance by Sting, a longtime friend, is also anticipated.) Ferri credits the creation of this extraordinary event to Purchia and to the power of this theater, in a moment of crisis, to have the guts and strength to create the necessary energy so artists come to Naples to play this music, to raise their eyelids, to look ahead.",2010-10-18T17:08:58+0000

(Sounds like your typical fashionisto.) These words appeared in the first issue of Womens Wear (the Daily came later), from June 1910, in a mission statement titled Our Excuse for Being. The defensive pose actually makes some sense: its not easy to prove, as W.W.D. has, that you can write about an essentially frivolous enterprise without indulging in frivolity.

The Obama administration has defended the law, arguing that change should come from Congress, not the courts; last week the Department of Justice gave notice that if the request for a stay was denied or not resolved by Monday at noon, it intended to appeal to the Ninth Circuit to allow the orderly litigation of the stay request before that court.

The study concludes that The Simpsons is among the few TV programs for kids in which Christian faith, religion and questions about God are recurrent themes.

Texas knocked Nebraska from the ranks of the unbeaten last week. Will the Cornhuskers be able to bounce back from that loss and do the same to Oklahoma State? Oklahoma travels to Missouri as the No. 1 team in the Bowl Championship Series standings, and the Tigers would love to prove their legitimacy by knocking off the Sooners. Speaking of legitimacy, Texas Christian does not seem as if it will get a legitimate chance at the national title, even if it keeps dominating opponents. The Horned Frogs face Air Force, which had been ranked until a loss last week. In the SEC, Louisiana State and Auburn are undefeated and in the top 10, but both seem to be searching for respect. Many think it is simply luck that has kept Les Miless bunch undefeated, while Cam Newton has kept Auburn winning despite a woeful defense. In the Big Ten, Wisconsin is coming off a huge win over Ohio State. Now the Badgers travel to Iowa, where they hope the running back duo of John Clay and James White will continue their productivity.

Traditional holidays and reunions still serve for short visits, although youre probably sick to death of those predictable flare-ups over the Thanksgiving turkey. But extended stays demand something more dramatic in the way of a plot. While the death of an elderly parent or an ailing sibling works in theory, it shifts the attention away from the prodigal child. And that can be a real problem when the writers primary interest is in sending the protagonist back to revisit his or her younger self, not to fuss over funeral arrangements and be upstaged by the dearly departed.",2010-10-22T16:26:02+0000

The Times regularly reminds us that our food choices not only affect our physical health but also shape our social, environmental, economic and cultural identities. I thus find it paradoxical that the magazines Food Issue features a recipe for veal. This issue advocates taking a more holistic perspective on eating and food, and Amanda Hessers Recipe Redux extols the impact of The Timess classic recipes over the years. Yet by featuring a 1962 recipe for veal chops beau sjour, The Times fails to heed its own advice. The veal industry, which the ethicist Peter Singer calls the most morally repugnant of all factory farming, involves tethering calves in pens not wider than two feet so they are unable to stretch their legs from birth until slaughter, and deliberately feeding them a diet lacking in iron, so that their meat reaches a desired tenderness and complexion.

But Paranormal Activity 2 was produced by Paramount Pictures for just $3 million and given a cheaper-than-usual marketing campaign that relied heavily on Web chatter. Paramount was doing cartwheels on Sunday, partly because it also had the second-place movie: Jackass 3D took in about $21.6 million for a two-week total of $87.1 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticket statistics. The ensemble action picture Red (Summit Entertainment) was third with $15 million for a new total of $43.5 million. Clint Eastwoods Hereafter (Warner Brothers) was fourth in its first wide-release weekend with $12 million. And The Social Network (Sony Pictures Entertainment) continued to show strong audience interest in fifth place, selling $7.3 million for a total of about $73 million.",2010-10-24T21:02:45+0000

As the exhibition demonstrates, Jongerius has never had trouble finding sympathy for her ideas in the design industry, where companies like Vitra, Ikea and Maharam hired her to introduce beautiful inconsistencies into their sofas, vases and upholstery fabrics. As it turns out, the only people who ever took convincing were the craftspeople themselves. Royal Tichelaar Makkums artisans cringed when they were told to fire her 1997 B-Set pottery (above) at too high a temperature, while Nymphenburgs worried that her 2004 Sketches plates looked half-finished. Craft has a tradition of trying to make perfect things, says Louise Schouwenberg, the shows curator. Hella told them to stop trying, because industry can do that better, whereas their appeal is more humane. Jongerius persisted, and these days, evidence of the hand of the maker seems completely natural. The misfits have become the mainstream. ",2010-10-26T14:30:21+0000

us,Think Ink,"Cynics, or perhaps graphic designers, might argue that your average perfume is 99 percent packaging. Maybe more. A perfume is an image that you cannot see with your eyes, says Mathias Augustyniak, who, as one half of the design firm M/M (Paris), has worked on scent identities for Balenciaga and Narciso Rodriguez. When he and his partner, Michal Amzalag, approached Ben Gorham of Byredo Parfums with an idea for a fragrance, they were not following their noses. They gave Gorham three inspirations: a block of solid ink they bought in Korea, a photograph of a Japanese friend who is a calligraphy master and an oversized absurd formula that Augustyniak drew with ink on a piece of handmade Korean paper. We spoke about ink with Ben, who is properly inked since hes covered with tattoos, which added a layer of resonance, Amzalag says. The result, M/MINK Eau de Parfum, is represented by a sort of smear campaign  artworks made from existing images, by the photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, that Amzalag and Augustyniak obscured with slicks of thick black ink. What the fragrance smells like is even more ambiguous. The artist Wolfgang Tillmans, a friend of the designers, described it to them as very manly, while a female friend declared that it reminded her of her grandmother, a comment that left Amzalag wondering if the friend had a manly grandmother. To me it feels like a roller coaster ride, he says, because it keeps changing once it is on your skin. ",2010-10-26T16:05:44+0000

But Ill confine myself to just one objection. To make his scenario work, Heilemann envisions Bloomberg winning states like New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, behind a combination of moderate Republicans, centrist Democrats and progressives disappointed with Obama. In a vacuum, these might be plausible constituencies for Hizzoner  but not in an election where Sarah Palin is the Republican nominee! How many northeastern progressives (or Lincoln Chafee Republicans, for that matter) would contemplate casting a vote for a third-party candidate knowing that it might deliver the White House to the woman they fear and loathe above all others? Not many, Id say. Nothing would be guaranteed to rally the Obama coalition quite like the specter of a Palin presidency: For months before the election, the drumbeat that a vote for Bloomberg is a vote for Palin would be well-nigh deafening, and Im pretty sure that even a weakened Obama wouldnt have that much trouble holding serve in that scenario, relegating Bloomberg to exactly the kind of John Anderson-esque performance that would be his most likely fate in any case.",2010-10-26T18:28:44+0000

That assures a lot of fantasy-filled Decembers, as Peter Jackson has already scheduled a pair of Hobbit films for Warner Brothers and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in that month in the years 2012 and 2013. Avatar was released on Dec. 18 of last year and became the highest-grossing film in history, with almost $2.8 billion in worldwide ticket sales. Mr. Cameron and the top Fox film executives, Jim Gianopulos and Tom Rothman, jointly said they aimed to begin production next year on the first sequel.

So when the creative director John Skelton and his partner, Dan Mitchell, approached him to design the interiors of LN-CC, a new concept store (think meticulously curated avant-garde fashion, rare books and vintage vinyl) in the scrappy east London neighborhood of Dalston, Card jumped at the chance to create something permanent. He used his surrealist sensibility to transform the space, a former boxing gym, into a hipster fun house. To enter the store, visitors navigate Cards deconstructed forest, only to find themselves in the belly of a beast  a wooden tunnel that resembles a crudely assembled whale skeleton. The rest of the 6,000-square foot-space is divided into individual rooms, like a gallery hung with mannequins (above) and a library lined with asymmetrical shelving. Every room needed a distinct atmosphere, tone and temperature, Card says. The idea was to move from organic to industrial, from warm to cold. And always keep it open to change. The main attraction is the private club space, with its sound system by the legendary sound guru Mickey Boyle. For Cards sake, we hope the parties dont get too out of hand. ",2010-10-27T14:35:23+0000

Questions of class and of East and West, raised by the narrators position as a wealthy Turk, make this, as Pamuk writes, not simply a story of lovers, but of the entire realm, that is, of Istanbul.",2010-10-29T17:18:07+0000

In 1946, the Truman administration presented the United Nations with the Baruch Plan for international control of nuclear weapons, which Stalin, working on his own bomb, rejected. Four decades later, Ronald Reagan almost signed a deal with Mikhail Gorbachev to eliminate nuclear weapons, but this time missile defense proved an insuperable stumbling block.

us,Dream Sequence,"This absorbing novel  the first from the distinguished Spanish author to be translated into English  is full of mild sensations. Mild humor (bacalao soaked for dinner in the toilet tank) gives way to mild horror (a woman bends over anothers baby with the posture of certain all-consuming insects), which in turn yields to mild philosophizing (on the admiration that denizens of the rural world feel for folding things). At times, the mildness turns to provocation, as when the main character, a simple yet baffling woman named Mara Antonia Etxarri, watches a troop of soldiers and has a feeling that one of those soldiers, if not more than one, was going to rape her. The placidity with which she faces this prospect is galvanic. But de Lopes languid sentences, artfully translated by John Cullen, continue to unfurl, and you find yourself sinking back into the narrative as if it were quicksand.",2010-10-29T17:37:10+0000

Whereas Thoreau made so much of his precious solitude in a shack only a couple of miles from his home in Concord, Slocum actually put himself at risk. In his 50s, pistol-whipped by fate, he set out in a largely self-built 36-foot sailboat and somehow managed to circumnavigate the earth. He might have been without a crew, but he was hardly alone; he had the magical Spray for a companion: a vessel that could literally steer herself for hundreds of miles at a time while he reclined contentedly in his book-lined cabin eating salt cod and reading Don Quixote. For a landlocked teenager who had both nautical and literary ambitions, Slocum was almost too good to be true.",2010-10-29T17:37:51+0000

In the long run, their greatest engineering triumph may not have been the construction of an atomic bomb in 1949 (based on stolen Western secrets) or the lofting of the first satellite into orbit (1957) or even the first man in space (1961).
