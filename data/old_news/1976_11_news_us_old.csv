us,"'Dirty Hands,' a Chabrol Film, Little More Than Soap Opera","The peculiar state in which its American distributor has seen fit to release Claude Chabrol's ""Dirty Hands"" in New York prompts me to wonder whether I should review it or search for its pulse. It's alive but unwell, having been cut from its original 120 minutes to 102 and as poorly dubbed into English as anything I can remember seeing, though I do have a short memory for botch-jobs.When it opened in Paris in March 1975, it was called ""Les Innocents aux Mains Sales,"" literally ""Innocents With Dirty Hands,"" which has now been shortened to confuse it with the Jean-Paul Sartre play, which is another thing entirely.The film is set mostly in an elegant house just outside St. Tropez and is about an alcoholic husband (Rod Steiger), his younger wife (Romy Schneider) and the wife's lover (Paolo Giusti), who persuades the wife to join him in putting the old boy out of his misery, for their own fun and profit.When you watch Romy calmly (and idiotically, if you know your crime stories) bludgeon her husband's blanketed form in the bed, without checking to see if he's actually in the bed, you may correctly suspect that Mr. Chabrol is having an off-day and probably an off-picture.Mr. Chabrol's best films are never exactly what they seem. They have elaborately intellectual superstructures that illuminate the action below and are there for consideration if one cares to climb. ""Dirty Hands"" (at least in this version) has nothing upstairs, but more plot and, long before the twists start coming, one has stopped being interested in even who is doing what to whom. Forget why.The performances are of a pieceuniformly atrocious. Mr. Steiger surpasses his own earlier records for lumbering busyness. Within his first few minutes on screen he (1) gets drunk, (2) whines, (3) pleads for understanding, (4) weeps and (5) goes to bed alone. Going to bed alone is no big deal in most films, but when Mr. Steiger goes to bed alone, it's Napoleon the night after Waterloo.Miss Schneider, who was apparently filmed speaking English part of the time and French part of the time, is a beautiful woman, but even her beauty looks faked in this picture, as if she'd been preserved with wax.I have no idea how much the English dubbing and editing have damaged the original, but the ""Dirty Hands"" that opened yesterday at the Forum and other theaters is a junk movie.",1976-11-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Glass Slipper Into Sow's Ear,"There've been times of tranquility and ease, without pressures, when I've thought to myself how pleasant it would be anticipating a new Hitchock film, or a new Bunel, or an Astaire-Rogers revival, or a classy new stage production of ""The Importance of Being Earnest."" Familiarity can breed fondness with expectation.But neverexcept possibly during a fever dreamhave I ever thought how great it would be to see an all-new, very lengthy, very elaborate musical version of the story of Cinderella, a movie with music and lyrics by Robert B. and Richard M. Sherman, the songwriting brothers who did ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks,"" with Richard Chamberlain as the Prince, Gemma Craven as Cinderella and the late Edith Evans shoehorned in as the Prince's old granny. This is not idle talk. It's something every parent should consider before accompanying the children to see the film that opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall. Kids, we know, will sit through almost anything, from awful made-in-Yugoslavia cartoons shown on Saturday morning television to the classic ""Wizard of Oz"" and, if they have to, ""Claire's Knee."" If there's an image moving on the screen, children will continue to stare at it. It's adults who need to be protected.""The Slipper and the Rose: The Story of Cinderella"" is a movie to turn a prince into a frog.There aren't that many films one can take small children to these days that ""The Slipper and the Rose"" should be dismissed. It's harmless, I guess, but it goes on so long  128 minuteswith so little suspensethere's only so much that can be done about that unwearable glass slipper  that it may well outlast the staying power of children who stuff themselves with popcorn and then drink to excess.""The Slipper and the Rose,"" a collaboration of the Shermans and Bryan Forbes, the director, was filmed partially in and around the ""Sound of Music"" country of Salzburg, Austria, an association that comes naturally enough during the film as one begins to long for a bit of Julie Andrews's chic and sophistication.The castles are pretty, the costumes are suitably candy-colored and the supporting actors excellent, including Michael Hordern, as the Prince's bubble-headed father; Annette Crosbie, as a most practical fairy godmother, and Margaret Lockwood, as the wicked stepmother.As the young lovers, Mr. Chamberlain and Miss Craven have impossible roles that are less like characters in a fairy tale than pictures on a jar of peanut butter.Mr. Forbes and Robert Sherman, authors of the screenplay, have stretched the fable without mercy, largely to accommodate a whole bunch of forgettable songs by the Shermans, who did very well by ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Tom Sawyer,"" but who, when off stride, as here, sound as if they're parodying the worst of the Broadway musical theater of the 50's. Like Ross Hunter, they're devoted to an earlier tradition they've worn out.",1976-11-05T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Maitresse' In Uniform,"One night while burglarizing a Paris apartment he thinks is empty, Olivier (Grard Dpardieu), a healthy young man with no scruples about breaking and entering, is caught by Ariane (Bulle Ogier), the apartment's mistress, a sweet, gentle thing who runs a high-class parlor devoted to the needs of well-heeled masochists. It's the sort of place a fellow goes after a difficult day at the office, where he can rid himself of the tensions of being happy and successful by hanging from a cross, being put into a cage, beaten or having his penis nailed to a plank.Olivier is a modern youthbasically unflappable. When Ariane presses him, figuratively, of course, into helping with one of her customers, he goes along with the game. The truth is, he is falling in love with her. He admires the way Ariane goes about her tasks with the spunky dedication of a modern-day, whip-toting, leather-clad Florence Nightingale. She is indefatigable. For Ariane, it's work, work, work. When Olivier suggests it must be exhausting, she says, ""Not at all . . . it's fabulous to be able to get into people's craziness, especially in such an intimate way.""Because other people's hang-ups always are balmy to someone who doesn't share them, Barbel Schroeders ""Maitresse,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet, is likely to seem either unintentionally hilarious or disgusting to audiences who are not themselves into fancy S-M. Mr. Schroeder is a serious film maker (""More,"" ""Idi Amin Dada"") but I'm not sure it's possible to be serious about sado-masochism in a medium as graphic as film.The explicitness of the scenes of flagellation and nailing (performed, says a program note, by a ""professional 'maitresse'"") are so bizarre that their place in a metaphor about all love relationships is completely forgotten. The shock effect prevents the film from being about anything more than what we see on the screen, which is a pretty little hustler who makes good money catering to the nutty fantasies of people who can afford to pay.It may be, as Mr. Schroeder suggests in another program note, that there's some S-M in all of us, but there's a big difference between people who must act out their fantasies in elaborately contrived theatrics and those who simply want to torment a cab driver or who make an important appointment they know they can't keep.Mr. Dpardieu and Miss Ogier are two of France's most appealing young performers. Each also suggests a level-headed intelligence and comic self-awareness that are completely out of place in ""Maitresse"" except in those sequences that have to do with their own love affair. The ecstasy, anger, suspicion and helplessness of that affair makes the ritualized torture scenes seem not a projection of extreme psychological needs but clips from a different movie.",1976-11-05T05:00:00+0000

us,"Incredible Sarah,' Film on Bernhardt","""The Incredible Sarah,"" which opened yesterday at the Festival Theater, is a foolishly romantic movie about the young Sarah Bernhardt as played by Glenda Jackson, who isn't foolish, romantic or remarkably young. Other things being equal, this might have damaged the film, but they aren't.Miss Jackson, striding about the screen in that firm, authoritative, brainy way that can sometimes be quite sexy, finding readings for unreadable lines that may be unexpectedly funny, is the only reason to put up with the cliched lunacies of ""The Incredible Sarah"" for more than five minutes. In every other respect, the movie is a disaster seemingly calculated to send women back to the kitchen forever.Women were apparently in charge of this movie and all they have shown is that, given the opportunity, they can make movies as rottenly as any group of men. ""The Incredible Sarah"" was produced by Helen M. Strauss, who, I assume, didn't have to have her arm twisted to hire Richard Fleischer as the director or to accept Ruth Wolff's screenplay. This is no more than a series of talking tableaux that begin when Miss Jackson, impersonating a stage-struck teen-ager circa 1860, wins a Comdie Franaise audition, vowing, ""I shall be the greatest actress who ever lived.""Thereafter the movie records without comment some of the more bizarre details of the legendary careerhow Sarah had a nobleman's son out of wedlock, slept in a coffin, had temper tantrums and insisted on being paid after every performance in gold. There are ups and downs in her career and Mr. Fleischer and Miss Jackson, without offering us tangible proof, ask us to believe the divine Sarah was the greatest actress of her century. Most publicized, maybe, but greatest? We have only the words of the screenplay to go on.We are shown bits and pieces of Bernhardt performances in ""Le Passant,"" ""Phdre,"" ""La Dame aux Camlias"" and ""King Lear,"" in all of which Miss Jackson behaves more like Miss Jackson doing educational television than the most startling, most galvanizing actress of her age. No one makes any attempt to recapture the particular Bernhardt style that, some years later, prompted George Bernard Shaw to write several of his most scathing notices as he compared Bernhardt with Dusevery unfavorably.""The Incredible Sarah"" is an incredibly low-brow variation on the story of the actress who must make horrendous personal sacrifices in the name of her art. Considering the lightweight dopiness of the men around Sarah, though, the sacrifices are not all that great. Daniel Massey plays the admiring Sardou, less as a successful playwright than as the hair-dressing member of an actress's entourage. John Castle, who is the fellow Sarah marries, plays a very bad actor badly. Without exception, all the men in the cast are awful.Miss Jackson is never uninteresting to watch, but her best moments  and I'm not kidding  are her curtain calls, when, exhausted, somewhat dazed, she stands in front of the curtain to acknowledge her audience. One recognizes a real actress even if the bows, considering the movie that contains them, are unseemly.",1976-11-06T05:00:00+0000

us,'Next Man' Plays on Paranoia,"""The Next Man,"" which opened at the Rivoli and other theaters yesterday, is a suspense melodrama made by people whose talent for filmmaking and knowledge of international affairs would both fit comfortably into the left nostril of a small bee.It's about a visionary Saudi Arabian minister of state named Khalil Abdul-Muhsen, played by the very Scots-sounding Sean Connery, who proposes to defuse the Middle East by signing a mutual assistance pact with Israel and by making petroleum and petroleum by-products available virtually at cost to poor nations.""The Next Man"" is the story of the attempt by various vested interests in this country, the Soviet Union and the Middle East, acting separately, to put an end to this dreadful scheme by putting an end to Khalil.Like a lot of other films these days, ""The Next Man"" is obsessed with political assassination but it never really identifies its villains, preferring, instead, to cop out by playing on natural paranoia that assumes that everyone everywhere is on the take from someone somewhere. This attitude is too easy to represent true cynicism. It's simple laziness.In ""The Next Man"" the forces of reaction are represented entirely by a mysterious, exceedingly well-dressed young woman named Nicole Scott, said to be the daughter of a former American ambassador to Great Britain, a Bryn Mawr graduate, and a girl who apparently slays not for pay but for thrills of a sort you don't get in the Junior League.This character is played by Cornelia Sharpe, a new actress who is well on her way to becoming the actress producers will hire when they can't get Faye Dun-away. Miss Sharpe is stunning looking and model-skinny, and you don't for a minute believe her to be an international assassin any more than you believe Mr. Connery to be an Arab anything.The movie appears to agree. As if to take our minds off such matters, ""The Next Man"" moves rootlessly around the world like a fretful tourist, from New York to the Middle East, the south of France, London, Ireland, Bavaria, and the Bahamas, though nothing much happens in any one of these places that couldn't as easily happen somewhere else.The characters are always getting in and out of jets and coming upon colorful local festivals (including the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York), and if there's no parade to look at, the script will arbitrarily have someone decide to climb into a helicopter to go sight-seeing. ""The Next Man"" is the first film I've ever seen that is so acutely bored with itself that it tries to go away.Who is responsible for mindless movie-making of this magnitude I've no idea, though it was produced by Martin Bregman, who also shares credit for the film's ""original story"" with Alan Trustman, who himself shares the screenplay credit with Mort Fine, David M. Wolf and Richard C. Sarafian, who directed the film. It looks as if too many people got into the act.There have been more expensive films this year, and more foolish ones, but ""The Next Man"" must be the most foolish film of such expense.",1976-11-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'A Child Is a Wild Young Thing',"THERE are television commercials that take perfectly lovely shots of children running across fields, all tangled up in light. But we aren't moved. The intention cancels the beauty.Peter Skinner's ""A Child Is a Wild Young Thing"" is often quite beautiful to look at. Considering it is his first moviehe wrote, directed, produced and photographed itit is made with some skill. But it is a dreadful and wrongheaded vision of its subject, a wrenched picture of childhood.Set on a Brittany island, the movie centers upon Adam, a curly haired 2-year-old. Ostensibly  the level of reality shifts somewhat at the endit is a record made by the narrator, a psychologist who is Adam's father, of the child and the child's mother.To be exact, the form isn't precisely narration. As the camera shows Adam moving about, playing, eating, crying, prancing, and the mother and three teen-age girls who have come along as vacation baby sitters, what we hear is an interminable argument.It is the psychologist and his wife tearing at each other. She resents his project, his cold and hidden stance behind the camera in an effort to try out theses about animal behavior on his son. Beyond that, she appears to resent his position as a male, his domination, his philandering.For his part, he is jealous of her total absorption in the child, her insistence on letting him run around naked and do whatever he pleases, her continual fondling and nuzzling of him.At one point, the mother lies naked on the beach and holds Adam on top of her in a posture of simulated intercourse. It is not especially shocking, but it isn't healthily natural, either. It is, simply, inappropriate: One more instance of the film's projecting adult ideas of childhood onto this child.The language of the parents is stilted and exaggerated. They hurl clichs about child development at each other. Each filmed sequence of Adam calls up a stream of the most banal and irritating comment. Occasionallyin one of the film's most depressing deviceswhat are presumed to be Adam's thoughts are rendered by songs.In some sense, it seems to be an attempt at psychodramareal or fictional or a mixture of bothto try to purge the tensions between husband and wife. At one paint, Adam is represented as dying, and one of the movie's genuinely charming bits comes when he refuses to stay out of camera range and is seen skipping about at his own ""funeral.""But what ultimately is least real in this movie is what should be most real: the child himself. He is an instrument, an occasion for the interminable acrimony of the parents.The camera virtually never leaves him, and the movie virtually never thinks of him. Children are not meant to be watched so persistently, so intensely. If they are, they are not seen. They change, they act up, they are distorted by the eye and thoughts of the person who watches them. The only way to look at children is with peripheral vision. Adam, so beautiful, so expressive, is virtually invisible in ""A Child Is a Wild Young Thing."" It opened yesterday at the Quad Cinema.",1976-11-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Early, Exuberant Fassbinder","IN 1969, when he was 23, Rainer Werner Fassbinder made his first feature film, ""Love Is Colder Than Death,"" and three more besides that one. In 1970, he stopped fooling around. He made seven features, including ""The American Soldier"" and ""Recruits in Ingolstadt,"" both of which have already been seen in this country. He also made ""Beware of a Holy Whore"" (Warnung vor Einer Heiligen Nutte), which opened yesterday at the Film Forum and is as fascinating and dissonant as might be wished by anyone who admires this young German film maker as I do.""Beware of a Holy Whore"" has the informal manner of a practice exercise but it leaves the kind of wounds one receives in a knife fight.""Beware of a Holy Whore"" is Mr. Fassbinder's comic, self-consciously absurd, slightly dizzy ""Contempt,"" ""Day for Night"" and ""The Last Tycoon,"" made in the manner of the post-""Eat,"" pre-""Trash"" Andy Warhol.A dozen people, including Eddie Constantine as Eddie Constantine, are hanging around the lobby of a none-too-posh Spanish seaside hotel waiting to start a film. Until the director of the film shows up, the production manager, played by Mr. Fassbinder, is in charge, which means he can be rude and sarcastic and more or less removed from the small intrigues that take place at the bar.The virile speech coach makes a tentative play for the director's young boyfriend. A young German actress is wrapped up in a German technician until Eddie Constantine looks her way. Another German crew member drinks so many Cuba libres he becomes confused about the love he is drinking to forget. When the director finally arrives, he treats the production manager as badly as the production manager has treated everyone else, and makes his point by taking the production manager's wife away from him. The director is bored with his boyfriend.""Beware of a Holy Whore"" is not really about movie making at all. It's about connections and disconnections. The members of Mr. Fassbinder's movie company spend most of the time moving about the large, gloomy hotel lobby like people trying to make trans-Atlantic calls to one another when the atmospheric condictions are terrible. No sooner has contact been made than there is an inexplicable interruption. Sentences are arbitrarily splintered. Syllables are lost. Wires are crossed.The Fassbinder view of the world is very special. His images contain not reflections of vital reality but of psychological stress. Mr. Fassbinder's characters are never fully revealed. They are hinted at. The movie, thus, is impossible to enjoy in the conventional sense of a narrative film that has an easily recognzable beginning, middle and end. All of the images are part of a single image, which, in this case, has a number of uproarious funny details though the overall tone is one of despair.""Beware of a Holy Whore"" is the work of a very young, very gifted film maker. In a movie by a director of lesser talent and natural exuberance, some of Mr. Fassbinder's showy, often Godardian effects would be impediments we look around or beyond to appreciate a major career that is erupting with the force of a natural phenomenon.",1976-11-12T05:00:00+0000

Dr. Olds said his decision had not been easy, but then nothing about my tenure at Kent State from the day I arrived has been easy. Advances had been made, he said, despite the tragedy of 1970, loss of funding to higher education in Ohio, a reduced enrollment and a close faculty vote in favor of unionization.

But today Brown has an opportunity to share, and possibly win, its first Ivy League championship. If the Bruins defeat Columbia at Baker Field, they are assured of at least a share of first place with Yale; if the Bruins win while Yale loses to or ties Harvard, they will win the title for the first time since the Ivy schools were twined together formally in 1956. Not that John Anderson is surprised by the imminence of immortality.

Something terrible is happening, that is, and will somebody stop it, and how are we going to get out of here? And, by contrast, it makes any of themeven ""Hindenburg""look like cinematic poetry.It assembles its characters in a familiar series of cameos. There is the killer, or rather bits of him: hands, feet, eyeballwe only see all of him once, blurredly, near the very end. He shoots a passing cyclist for practice before placing himself in the top tower of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.There are the police, or rather there are two groups of the police. The first is the good guysgood, but ineffective, that isled by a captain, Charlton Heston, who worries about people getting hurt and is dubious about the methods of the second police. These, in overalls and looking like homicidal plumbers, are a tactical commando group. They are mean, violent and messy.Finally, there are the selected spectatorsa quarrelsome middle-age noncouple, a gambler who will be dropped out of a high window if Los Angeles doesn't beat Baltimore, a girl switching boyfriends in midpass, as it were, a harried young father with wife and children, a pickpocket and so on.Except for the gambler, who is played with comic but touching desperation by Jack Klugman, none of them have the slightest dimension. They could be placards. Some of them, it's obvious, will die, and the spectator is mildly sorry and mildly curious but that's all.Curiosity is not suspense. For suspense, some involvement is required. Through almost the whole length of the movie we know nothing about the threatwho he is, what he wantsand nothing about who is threatened or why. It is an abstract threatat some point somebody is going to begin shooting and some people will be killed and that's all we have.And because it is all so unspecific, the efforts of the police to catch the sniperall their ladder-climbing and maneuveringare no more exciting than watching a group of linesmen at work up a telephone pole.The movie is a blank, in other words, until the end. And then, suddenly, a lot of people are killed very gorily; and there is a mass stampede, and the football crowd becomes a panicked, murderous mob. And even the panic lacks emotion. It has momentumlots of feet stepping on facesand viciousness. Nothing more.",1976-11-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Moments of Being,"Often when I have been writing one of my socalled novels I have been baffled by this same problem: that is, how to describe what I call in my private shorthand nonbeing. Every day includes much more nonbeing than being. Yesterday for example, Tuesday the 18th of April, was [as] it happened a good day; above the average in being. It was fine; I enjoyed welting these first pages; my head was relieved of the pressure of writing about Roger; I walked over Mount Misery and along the river; and save that the tide was out, the country, which I notice very closely always, was coloured and shaded as I likethere were the willows, I remember, all plumy and soft green and purple against the blue. I also read Chaucer with pleasure; and began a bookthe memoirs of Madame de la Fayettewhich interested me. These separate moments of being were however embedded in many more moments of nonbeing. I have already forgotten what Leonard and I talked about at lunch; and at tea; although it was a good day the goodness was embedded in a kind of nondescript cotton wool. This is always so. A great part of every day is not lived consciously. One walks, eats, sees things, deals with what has to be done; the broken vacuum cleaner; ordering dinner; writing orders to Mabel; washing; cooking dinner; bookbinding. When it is a bad day the proportion of nonbeing is much larger. I had a slight temperature last week; almost the whole day was nonbeing. The real novelist can somehow convey both sorts of being. I think Jane Austen can; and Trollope; perhaps Thackeray and Dickens and Tolstoy. I have never been able to do both. I triedin Nights and Days; and in The Years.

According to Mr. Bulpitt, the trick to forcing lilies is to obtain prechilled bulbs from bulb suppliers specializing in bulbs for forcing. (Prechilling allows bulbs to cure.) Pot lily bulbs individually in compostenriched soil, water and store at temperatures of 32 degrees for four weeks to root. Pots can he stored in a coldframe or buried in the ground and protected so they do not freeze. After roots form, bring into temperatures of 50 degrees for a week or so, then 60 degrees to grow. Lilies planted by the end of this month should bloom around midFebruary.

us,The Demon,"His friends called him Harry the Lover. . . . It had to be . . . a married woman. These solemn words begin Hubert Selby's third novel, by all odds his most ludicrous to date. Ambitious young Harry White is not your ordinary cocksure hero, but possessed of a Major Sexual Urge. These things, as we know, are parceled out unfairly at birth. When Harry exchanges glances with a woman, the game is up. His every seduction is instant, hasslefree and assemblyline dull. In bed of course he outperforms all imaginable husbands. Faithful followers of Playboy will recognize the archetype. But there's a grand surprise in store for the thoughtful reader: Harry becomes the victim of his awesome urge, get it? Poor Harry must leave his baseball game, after scoring what proves to be the winning run, so that his demon can score another in bed. How's that for an original donnee?",1976-11-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"Jeanne Moreau's 'Lumier' Is Dazzling:Film on Women Written and Directed by the Actress, Who Stars","It's a mark of the quality of Jeanne Moreau's ""Lumire"" that its defects are exaggerations of virtues. There is no fumbling or uncertainty in the first movie that she has written and directed and in which she gives, additionally, a splendid performance.On the contrary, there is great control. Often it leads to marvelous perceptions. Sometimes, in the too-studied dcor of a scene or the overly purposeful marshaling of a character or a dramatic sequence, it gives a sense of contrivance amd airlessness.""Lumire,"" which opened yesterday at the Beekman Theater, is Miss Moreau's own penetrating vision of what it means to be a woman. It is as autobiographical and personal as a first novel, and as deliberately limited in scope. Miss Moreau's women are not farmers or office workers or sociologists. They are four actresses of different ages, inhabiting a particular, affected, high-pressured world.If the narrow focus seems precious, it is made up for by the insight with which we are shown the four women's relations with men, with their careers, with timethe almost visible enemy  and with one another. At its best, ""Lumire"" is subtle, funny and moving. And its ending is so powerful as to make an extraordinarily good movie seem, for these last minutes, close to a perfect one.The form of the picture is something like one of those traditional tales where four characters come out of a storm and into a quiet inn. In this case the meeting is at the country house of Sarah (Miss Moreau), the eldest of the four and the film's central figure. The women swim, sing snatches of childhood songs, lie in hammocks, fly kites, talk.It is an interval of peace and Miss Moreau uses it to establish her vision of feminine intimacy. It is composed of affection and a simultaneous understanding and restraint. The women see one another's loneliness and tend it with small attentions: presents, caresses, a kind of mutual adornment. They are soldiers resting before setting out for solitary campaigns. All they can do for one another is help with the bandages, not the fighting; and talk around, not through, one another's suffering.The movie then shifts to the four lives. Each is torn in some different way between the traditional feminine needsstability, the nurture of some fixed situationand the compulsion to appear and move in the light. This light, the ""lumire"" of the title, is limelight, the world's attention, the regard not of one person or family but of a series of strangers. Lovers, an audience: for these actresses they are aspects of the same compulsion. ""To dream on the stage and to take your audience with you,"" says Julienne (Francine Racette), one of the younger women.It is Sarah who is most firmly in the light. Aging  Miss Moreau displays her sagging lines as if they were rewards given for beauty  she is at the height of her career, with a string of younger lovers Yet she clings to a loving friendship with Gregoire, an older man, a medical researcher who lives quietly and could, perhaps, have been her mate. ""There is nothing I like so well as talking with you and being silent with you,"" she tells him. He is the stability she loves and cannot accept.Laura has gone a different way. A successful Italian actress  played by Lucia Bose, she recalls Sophia Loreh  she has married a rich man and thinks of herself mainly as a wife and mother. She has lost the ""light"" in favor of normality, and the loss gnaws at her strength and serenity.Julienne is a young star, new to success. She seems feather-headed and flighty, but that is largely because she has only recently arrived from the other side, The other side is her estranged husband and child. When she goes to visit, her clothes and her demeanor suddenly recall the young matron she was on the point of becoming.For Caroline, the youngest, the light is still a glimmer. She nibbles at itdinner with a producer, the offer of a bit part without clothesbut is held back by the spoiled young man she lives with. They quarrel continually, but quarreling is a form of stability that she is not prepared to cut away from.The film cuts from life to life. Sarah is discarding a petulant young film worker and acquiring a German writer. The reject is explosive, funny and futile; the writerwell-played by Bruno Ganzis tentative and dreamy. Laura, staying with Sarah, is shaken by the discovery that her husband may leave her. Julienne is comically interviewed by a mawkish woman reporter who asks her about her feelings, and comically seduced by a young American film star.Amid all this, Gregoire discovers he is dying of cancer. He goes to Sarah, possiblyit is only suggestedto ask some act of real if temporary commitment from her. But she is too distracted to give him a chance to talk; he swallows pills and dies quietly.The movie's climax comes when Laura wakes Sarah with breakfast and word of Gregoire's suicide. ""I must go there at once,"" Sarah says, and huddles in bed. ""I should take a bath,"" she says, and then: ""There is too much light."" She dresses and goesto work. We see her surrounded by technicians, posing, performing, using herself as a photographer uses his camera or a carpenter his tools.At an age when life for most people is cherishing the living and burying the dead, Sarah remains fixed in her world of light. Miss Moreau neither praises the choice nor condemns it, but the achievement of ""Lumire""'s extraordinarily moving finale is to make us see its rigor.",1976-11-15T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: After the Prom, the Horror","CARRIE is an elegant box lunch that got dropped. The wine is all over the rolls. Caviar is embedded in the turkey, and there is lettuce in the mousse. It is a mess, with bits of salvage floating usefully around in it.The newest film by Brian de Palma, who is often wrong but not dull, ""Carrie"" is billed as a horror movie. But it is sometimes funny in a puzzling kind of way, it is generally overwrought in an irritating kind of way, and once in a while it is inappropriately touching. It isn't frightening at all until the very end, and then it is briefly and extremely frightening.CarrieSissy Spacekis a Charles Addams-like teen-ager who lives with her mother in a Charles Addams-like house. The mother, played as a cracked belle by Piper Laurie, is a religious maniac. She hangs a picture of ""The Last Supper"" over the dining room table, and fills the house with candles and hysterical prayers.Carrie turns out friendly but strange. Her schoolmates loathe her strangeness. When she menstruates for the first time in the locker room and becomes hystericalthe only advice she gets from her mother is that menstruation is a sign of sexual impuritythe other girls shriek and mock her and pelt her with Tampax. They turn hysteria into something close to an epileptic seizure.In the process, however, Carrie discovers that, by concentrating, she can break ashtrays, make people fall off bicycles and worse. It's telekinesis, the movie explains.Well, this changes things. In a pretty funny scene, Carrie tells her mother, who had been shutting her in closets and tries to slop her from going to the prom, that she's in charge now. To underline the point, she makes all the windows in the house hang shut.The prom is a trick, however. Carrie's classmates have been punished for harassing her; to get even, they make a grisly plan whereby shethe wallfloweris taken to the prom by the class football star, elected beauty queen and then doused in pigs' blood. Her reprisals, via telekinesis, are as violent and devastating as an air raid. And there is one final bitthe movie's one real frightwhen she gets even with one of the girls who instigated the prom trick.Until this last bit, our reactions are in a constant state of short-circuitry. Mr. de Palma is our only pre-Raphaelite director. His apocalyptic scenes, bloody as they theoretically are, are too mannered and elegantly draped to be scary. It's Burne-Jones illustrating Dracula, and the result hovers between being ridiculous and making us smile because it is ridiculous.Mr. de Palma has ordered universal overacting. Piper Laurie does it with considerable gracethe wicked witch in a children's pantomime. The marvel, though, is Sissy Spacek. She makes us perfectly aware that she is overacting, and yet she is very effective. Her hysteria is far too hysterical. Her delight in being taken to the prom is far too radiant. But it moves us; and, in truth, the main horror in Carrie isn't the real bloodshed but our apprehension that her pleasure as well as her dress will be ruined by that bucket of pig blood.""Carrie"" opened yesterday at the Criterion and other theaters.",1976-11-17T05:00:00+0000

us,'Tycoon' Echoes 30's Hollywood,"""Not half a dozen men have been able to keep the whole equation of pictures in their heads,"" says the narrator of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Last Tycoon.""For a brief period in the late 20's and 30's, Irving Thalberg could. Thalberg, the production chief at M-G-M, a ""boy genius"" until his death at the age of 37 in 1936, appeared to be able to divine successful films as mysteriously as other people found water with a forked stick of witch hazel.The equation he held in his head told him how much a certain kind of picture would gross, which, in turn, told him how much could be profitably spent on its production. He knew whose brains to rent. The capacities of directors, writers and actors were as apparent to him as labeled contents. He could cut four minutes from a dreary 100-minute movie in such a way to make it seem a single, breathless experience of 60 minutes. In those days, moviespicturesdidn't waste time getting to points.Thalberg was responsible for good films and bad. Though his genius was made possible by the period, when Hollywood and its public were one, he was regarded with awe, as if he possessed not simply a knack for pictures but the secret of life.All of these things are contained in the muted and thoughtful, sad but unsentimental film version of ""The Last Tycoon"" about Fitzgerald's Thalberg-like hero named Monroe Stahr. Written by Harold Pinter, and directed by Elia Kazan, the movie attempts to take Hollywood seriously, without hoopla and grotesqueries, and especially to take Thalberg-Stahr seriously.Fitzgerald didn't live to finish ""The Last Tycoon,"" so that the version published in 1941, edited by Edmund Wilson with Fitzgerald's notes, is technically a fragment, yet it's a very complete satisfying fragment, a quality that the film preserves through an abrupt kind of editing style and a narrative that's without conventional shape.Thalberg died before being overtaken by defeat. In the film, Monroe Stahr does not. Stahr, who is played with reticent passion by Robert De Niro, whose lean, dark good looks seem an idealization of Thalberg's, becomes a casualty of the ""new"" Hollywood of Wall Street investors, bankers and union organizers that Fitzgerald could see in the future.""The Last Tycoon,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema I, is a very low-key movie, and so full of associationsto Thalberg, to the stories one knows of Hollywood in the 30's, to Fitzgerald's own life and careerthat it's difficult to differentiate between what one is seeing on the screen and what one is bringing to it.""The Last Tycoon"" doesn't really build to any climax. We follow it horizontally, as if it were a landscape being surveyed by a camera in a long pan-shot. The background is Hollywood in the Golden Thirties, when studios turned out 30 to 40 pictures a year and every backlot could simultaneously contain pictures set in New York, Africa, the South Pole and Montmartre.In the foreground are scenes from the curious life of Monroe Stahr as he edits several films at once, deals with neurotic actors and directors, maneuvers in corporate battles, and carries on an affair with a mysterious English girl whom he loves and loses.In one of his final notes for ""The Last Tycoon,"" Fitzgerald wrote in capital letters, ""Action Is Character."" It is one of the achievements of Messrs. Kazan, Pinter and De Niro that so much of Monroe Stahr succeeds in coming through in the film. Other characters that are so vivid in the book simply don't have enough time on screen, though both Robert Mitchumas Stahr's studio adversaryand Jack Nicholsonas the union organizerare extremely effective. Jeanne Moreau and Tony Curtis make brief, flashy appearances as idols of the old-time silver screen.Ingrid Boulting, who plays Stahr's mysterious English love, is beautiful in an eccentrically large-eyed way, and there are times when she doesn't seem to know how to read a line or where to put her hands. At other moments she is totally, serenely sure of herself, which may or may not be acting but does suggest the odd quality that drew Stahr to her. I also liked another new actress, Theresa Russell, who plays the Hollywood-born, Bennington-educated girl who narrates the novel but is simply a supporting character in the film.None of the changes that Mr. Pinter has made in the novel seem to me to damage the style or mood of the book. More than any other screen adaptation of a Fitzgerald workwith the exception of Joan Micklin Silver's fine adaptation of the short story ""Bernice Bobs Her Hair""""The Last Tycoon"" preserves original feeling and intelligence. The movie is full of echoes. We watch it as if at a far remove from what's happening, but that too is appropriate: Fitzgerald was writing history as it happened.",1976-11-18T05:00:00+0000

In Carnegie Hall, where the Boston Symphony played the Bartok Wednesday night under Seiji Ozawa's firm guidance, the score was heard in a softer focus that cost it some of its customary brilliance. Mr. Ozawa also underplayed the febrile, clangorous style that often is identified with Bartok, in favor of smooth, flowing performance that threw the score into interesting perspectives.

So John Keegan has turned to military history to discover and convey to his students what being in a battle is really like. And, in so doing, he has discovered an interesting point. Most traditional military historians, don't tell very much about what being in a battle is really like. They tell who won. They puff up the winner or rationalize why the loser lost. They offer the perspective of the generals and staff officers. But they don't individualize the experience of the average man in the line. And so, Mr. Keegan concludes in The Face of Battle, what is needed is a new approach to military historyan inquisitional approach in place of an accusatorial one (to parallel the distinction between the French and English judicial systems); or one that seeks to inquire what exactly happened instead of pronouncing verdicts on the final outcome.",1976-11-22T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Rocky,' Pure 30's Make-Believe","NOT SINCE ""The Great Gatsby"" two years ago has any film come into town more absurdly oversold than ""Rocky,"" the sentimental little slum movie that opened yesterday at the Cinema II. As a former head of Paramount Pictures said to me with some irritation at the time ""Gatsby"" came out, movies shouldn't be penalized for being effectively promoted. That's true. Yet the sort of highpowered publicity (most of it free, it seems) that's been attending the birth of ""Rocky"" must, in turn, subject the movie to impossible expectations that can boomerang. Be warned.Sylvester Stallone, who had a role in ""The Lords of Flatbush,"" another ""sleeper"" that never quite measured up as a hit, both wrote the original screenplay and plays the title role. Rocky is a young man who, by day, is a small-time Mafia collector, the sort of fellow who shows his heart of gold by hesitating to break a client's thumbs, and at night pursues a third-rate boxing career in fleabag sporting arenas.Under the none too decisive direction of John G. Avildsen (""Joe,"" ""Save the Tiger""), Mr. Stallone is all over ""Rocky"" to such an extent it begins to look like a vanity production. His brother composed one of the film's songs and appears briefly, as does his father, while his dog, a cheerful mastiff named Butkus, plays Rocky's dog. It's as if Mr. Stallone had studied the careers of Martin Scorcese and Francis Ford Coppola and then set out to copy the wrong things.The screenplay of ""Rocky"" is purest Hollywood make-believe of the 1930's, but there would be nothing wrong with that, had the film been executed with any verve.It's the story of Rocky and his girlfriend Adrian (Talia Shire), when Rocky, due to circumstances too foolish to go into, is granted the opportunity of his lifetime. He is given a chance to fight the heavyweight champion of the world, a black fighter named Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), modeled on Muhammad Ali so superficially as to be an almost criminal waste of character. It's not good enough to be libelous, though by making the Alilike fighter such a dope, the film explores areas of latent racism that just may not be all that latent.That Mr. Weathers is no actor doesn't help things, though there are some very good actors in other supporting roles, and they don't help in any significant way. Burt Young is effective as Rocky's best friend, a beer-guzzling mug, as is Burgess Meredith as Rocky's ancient trainer.The person who comes off best is Miss Shire, Mr. Coppola's sister who made brief, effective appearances in the two ""Godfather"" films. She's a real actress, genuinely touching and funny as an incipient spinster who comes late to sexual life. She's so good, in fact, that she almost gives weight to Mr. Stallone's performance, which is the large hole in the center of the film.Mr. Stallone's Rocky is less a performance than an impersonation. It's all superficial mannerisms and movements, reminding me of Rodney Dangerfield doing a nightclub monologue. The speech patterns sound right and what he says is occasionally lifelike, but it's a studied routine, not a character.It's the sort of performance that could have been put together by watching other actors on television. Most of the film was photographed on location in seedy, Philadelphia neighborhoods, and it's one of the film's ironies that a production that has put such emphasis on realism should seem so fraudulent.The problem, I think, comes back to Mr. Stallone. Throughout the movie we are asked to believe that his Rocky is compassionate, interesting, even heroic, though the character we see is simply an unconvincing actor imitating a lug.""Rocky,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains some barroom language and a climactic boxing match that is effectively brutal.",1976-11-22T05:00:00+0000

us,'Shout' Whispers on Screen,"At the start of ""Shout at the Devil"" the viewers, who are about to see a lot of elephant hunting, are told that ""not a single animal was injured."" The collapsing beasts were shot with stupefying darts.The audience at ""Shout,"" an adventure film that opened yesterday at showcase theaters, is treated with similar humaneness. No injuries, a thorough use of stupefying darts and some mild entertainment. There are about 60 minutes of mild entertainment, along with a few first-rate effects, in a film that is an incredible 128 minutes long.The movie is set in East Africaalthough, in fact, it was shot in South Africajust before and during World War I. It is divided into fairly distinct parts. In the first, we follow the adventures of Flynn (Lee Marvin), an alcoholic ivory poacher who lives on a plantation in Mozambique with his daughter, Rosa (Barbara Parkins), and does his ivory hunting across the border in Tanganyika, then held by the Germans.Flynn, joined by an expatriate Englishman, Sebastian, has some rough encounters with the local German district commissioner, Fleischer, who likes to shoot and hang people. In between sorties, Sebastian marries Rosa after a protracted and mock-comic fistfight with her father.In the second part, war is declared and Fleischer crosses the border, sets fire to Flynn's house, and kills Sebastian and Rosa's baby. This turns Rosa into a woman with the single obsession of killing Fleischer; meanwhile the three are sent by the British Navy to scout out a German battle-cruiser hidden up a river, and then to blow it up. These things are eventually accomplished.The movie has too much plot. All that action, conducted by characters without characterexcept for Fleischer, whose childlike joy in hurting people is almost appealing  produces lethargy. Roger Moore is rather good as Sebastian, a muted Errol Flynn type, but Miss Parkins plays her part with the verve of a damp rope. And Lee Marvin, who does toughness well enough, is insufferable when he is trying to be the comic Irishman. His doubletakes come like delayed mail.All this said, the movie has its compensations. Rene Kolldehoff, as Fleischer, manages to be entertaining in his exaggerated villainy, and there is a lovely slow chase when, in an ancient paddle-boat steamer, he pursues Marvin, in a sailing dhow, down a winding jungle river. There is a good head-on charge by a crocodile, and the blowing-up of the warship has moments of interest and excitement. The movie is a passable midget in absurdly long pants.""Shout"" has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). There are some fairly graphic scenes of natives being shot, and one that depicts, although we don't actually see it, a baby being thrown into a fire. Nevertheless, the film seems suitable for all but very young children.",1976-11-25T05:00:00+0000

us,The Sweet Science in Small Sizes,"Ask any reader of Eastern sports pages to name the world's outstanding fistfighters and he will start with Muhammad Ali, hesitate, and then if he is more knowledgeable than most, add the names of George Foreman, Ken Norton and perhaps Joe Frazier, who has retired. Almost 13 years have passed since Ali first succeeded to the heavyweight championship, which means that few people under 25 can remember champions who preceded him and, if some do remember, they certainly never saw any of them. A whole generation has grown up believing that All invented boxing and that the game will die when and if he retires for the last time. Most letters to the editor describing Ali positively as the greatest fighter of all time turn out to be from undergraduates. Anyhow, the point this paragraph set out to make is that the average fan in the East, called upon to name fighters off the top of his head, will mention only heavyweights. This isn't true in places like Southern California, where the large MexicanAmerican population makes boxoffice idols of little guys like Alfonso Zamora, Carlos Zarate, Rafael Limon and Danny Lopez, but on the Atlantic Seaboard if you tell somebody about great fights between little fellows you encounter expectant silence as he waits for the laugh.",1976-11-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: A Surprise From Germany,"ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, moving and exhilarating films available in New York this weekend and next is most certainly Werner Herzog's ""The Great Ecstasy of the Sculptor Steiner,"" a 45-minute documentary on Walter Steiner, the champion German ski jumper who describes what he does as ski-flying, which it is.The film occupies the major part of the current program at the Film Forum, 15 Vandam Street, where it may be seen tonight through Sunday evening at 7:30, and at the same time next week, Thursday through Sunday. Making up the rest of the program are two other shorts by Mr. Herzog, ""Precautions Against Fanatics"" and ""Last Words"" (each 12 minutes) and Jean-Marie Straub's ""Introduction to an Accompaniment to a Cinematic Scene by Arnold Schoenberg"" (15 minutes), which was first shown at the 1975 New York Film Festival with Mr. Straub's screen adaptation of Schoenberg's ""Moses and Aaron.""On the evidence of such feature films as ""Signs of Life,"" ""Even Dwarfs Started Small"" and ""Every Man for Himself and God Against All"" (titled ""The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser"" for its commercial release here), Werner Herzog is one of West Germany's most vital young film makers. Yet as original as those films have been, they've also suffered from acute over-intellectualism, a disease that has denatured so many young European film makers.Ideas are all very well and good, but a film maker who doesn't also have an instinctive passion, something not quite understood or predictable, might as successfully write textbooks.""The Great Ecstacy of the Sculptor Steiner,"" made in 1974, reveals for the first time that passion in Mr. Herzog, and in so doing it becomes a kind of key to the three feature films that have already been seen here. Mr. Steiner, who sculpts wood part-time and most of the time is obsessed by ski jumping, is a real-life Herzog hero, a fellow whose particular circumstances set him apart from everyone else.Most of Mr. Herzog's heroes appear to have been gifted by being deprived of somethingnormal height or intelligence, for examplethe rest of us take for granted. Mr. Steiner is deprived of an ordinary man's peace of mind by being possessed by his talent the demonstrations of which in this film are as spectacular as anything I've seen on the screen.""The Great Ecstasy of the Sculptor Steiner"" has the shape and manner of a sport film as it records the preparations that Mr. Steiner makes for a competition in Yugoslavia, and then records the competition itself. The things that separate it from other films are the personality of the ski jumper himself and Mr. Herzog's extraordinary slow-motion footage of the ski jumper at work. You have the feeling that on any one of these jumps. Mr. Steiner is going to take off and never again set foot on earth. At least, not alive.As a ski jumper, Mr. Setiner is an artist, and though specific jumps can be measured, those measurements have as little to do with his art as do the measurements of a painter's canvas. ""The Great Ecstasy of the Sculptor Steiner"" is, like ""Edvard Munch,"" really concerned with the mystery of the creative impulse.The two other Herzog shorts on the Film Forum program are the kind of avant-garde practice films that look as if they had been made for the principal appreciation of the film maker's friends and associates.",1976-11-26T05:00:00+0000
