(St. Martin's, $22.95), an absorbing, panoramic novel set in the waning Wild West days of British Columbia. It's that good: intricately plotted, meticulously researched and shaded with nuance. In ""Shoot!"" the Canadian poet and novelist George Bowering tells the story of four young men whose Indian mothers and white fathers earn them the dismissive status of half-breeds. Caught between two cultures that neither understand nor accept them, the boys tumble self-destructively from petty thievery to murder. With page after page of thundering hoofbeats, shoot-outs and blood-red sunsets, Shoot! does the western genre proud. But what truly distinguishes this novel is Mr. Bowering's unflinching examination of bigotry and intolerance, which seems as relevant to today's world as to that of the 1870's. Steady doses of wit and adventure help his brusque prose recover from occasional didactic detours, and a spiraling narrative structure gives the old-fashioned setting some post-modern flair. If nothing else, discovering the source of its deceptively hee-haw title is reason enough to tempt plenty of curious readers. Liam Callahan",1996-02-04T05:00:00+0000

It's a tale told by a spectrum of influential figures -- conservatives like Steve Forbes, the neo-Reaganite candidate, and Robert Bartley, editor of The Wall Street Journal, and liberal luminaries like the economist Lester Thurow and the financier-pundit Felix Rohatyn, who has recently been mentioned as a candidate for vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Like most good fairy tales, this one features a horrible monster who is blocking the path to eternal happiness. That would be Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, which controls the nation's money supply. The evil Greenspan and his colleagues, blinded by their obsession with inflation, cannot see that the economic terrain has shifted, that the economy can now grow much faster than previously without risking more inflation. Thus, to slay the inflation dragon, the Fed is keeping interest rates unnecessarily high, in a pointless war against a phantom enemy.",1996-02-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Intimate Expressionism,"In the appropriately titled essay ""A Long View"" in HOWARD HODGKIN PAINTINGS (Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth/Abrams, $39.95), Michael Auping, the chief curator at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, traces the development of Mr. Hodgkin's career, asserting that the English artist's earliest work established the essential elements that have preoccupied him for some 40 years -- the representation of figures in an interior space and the depiction of memory, for example. A brilliant colorist whose work is often seen as falling somewhere between representation and abstraction, Mr. Hodgkin ""does not allow illustration to interfere with the making of a painting,"" Mr. Auping writes. ""Memory and metaphor are his preferred terrain."" Mr. Auping finds that Mr. Hodgkin's paintings of the last two decades have forged the unlikely pairing of Intimism and Expressionism from wildly diverse influences like Henri Matisse, douard Vuillard, Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns and Willem de Kooning. Or as the cultural critic Susan Sontag puts it in her illuminating meditation: ""Hodgkin has understood that if the pictures are dense enough, they can go in two directions, doing justice to intimate textures as well as to emotions of a large expressiveness. (Both Vuillard and opera, so to speak.)"" Along with 80 color illustrations are an erudite and informative epistolary exchange between Mr. Hodgkin and John Elderfield, the chief curator at large at the Museum of Modern Art, and the first catalogue raisonn of Mr. Hodgkin's oil paintings, compiled by Marla Price, the director of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Magnum Opus,"It was time,"" says the octogenarian photographer Eve Arnold, ""to make an archive . . . to make order out of the chaotic files that have been my life."" For a photojournalist who has published eight previous books and accumulated more than 40 years' worth of slides, negatives and prints, that is a tall order. EVE ARNOLD: In Retrospect (Knopf, $50) is a chronological memoir of Ms. Arnold's professional life along with the photographs by which she wants to be remembered. From images of Malcolm X, Marilyn Monroe and Margaret Thatcher to those of anonymous veiled Afghan women and of toddlers in a Chinese nursery, the shots she has chosen show not only the high points but also the broad sweep of her undertakings. Throughout her career, she has worked for Magnum, the photographers' cooperative founded by Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger and David Seymour, usually on assignment for publications like Life and London's Sunday Times. Her style, despite her confession to ""dithering and nerves,"" is authoritative and humanist -- energized, as she says, by the unfamiliar. Being there is paramount to a photojournalist's success, and Ms. Arnold gives a lively account of the obstacles she surmounted -- rough terrain, illness, intractable bureaucrats. Although few of the book's images hold the transcendent power of her color picture of an old Chinese woman whose beautifully lined face emerges from the textured black of her clothes and the surrounding shadow, all attest to her enterprise and tenacity, along with her ability to establish rapport with her subjects. As Ms. Arnold looks back, she seems justifiably pleased with her accomplishments and wonders about her next project. Now that she has achieved order, she might try another kind of memoir, a distillation of her memories that brings more of the woman herself into focus. Rosemary Ranck",1996-02-11T05:00:00+0000

Dolgoruky transformed into the Slavic equivalent of garden gnomes; the eccentric bachelor, recalled by Baron Vrangel, who built a half-dozen houses on his country property, each in a different international style, fitted them out with appropriately attired harems and installed living statues outside, frozen in poses as Roman gods. Unfortunately for him, Venus and Hercules conspired: while she threw sand in his face, Hercules leaped down and clubbed him to death. The Bolshevik Revolution performed roughly the same function for the aristocracy as a whole, and with it disappeared a society that had become, in just over 200 years, what Ms. Roosevelt (a fellow of the Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies at George Washington University) describes as ""the crucible of Russian high culture."" She takes pains to avoid turning her lushly illustrated exploration of that culture into Merchant-Ivory in sables, including enough talk of serfs, small landowners and members of the intelligentsia to remind us that the labors of a very great many enabled a very lucky few to sample hothouse pineapples in the dead of winter and enjoy private 40-man horn orchestras, in which each musician produced just a single note. For the rulers of Russia's rural fiefdoms, Ms. Roosevelt writes, life was ""a study in contrasts, paradoxes and extremes."" Small wonder, then, that in the 1750's, when Prince Nikita Trubetskoy commissioned his Baroque mansion in the hills above the Moscow River, he chose to call it Neskuchnoe -- ""not boring.""

About a dozen homemade bird feeders, fashioned from gallon-size spring water containers, Kitty Litter jugs, dog food cans -- one with a chopstick for a perch -- hang from branches near the Central Park tennis courts between West 93d and West 96th Streets. They are the avian buzz of the park, drawing purple finches, cardinals and sparrows delighted by the free lunch. No one seems certain who put them up, but the Parks Department is not pleased. ""It compromises the birds' ability to hunt and forage on their own,"" insisted Marc Matsil, chief of natural resources. But Norman Stotz, an Audubon Society member familiar with other homemade feeders near East 74th Street, called them a much-needed boon to the birds.

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Inner Children,"Jackie Wullschlger's INVENTING WONDERLAND: The Lives and Fantasies of Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear, J. M. Barrie, Kenneth Grahame and A. A. Milne (Free Press, $24) briskly examines the authors of five classics of British children's literature and offers shrewd assessments of those profoundly eccentric men and their great works. Each of the writers, Ms. Wullschlger says, ""needed a child as muse to trigger the adult imagination into creating an extraordinary fantasy. Once locked into this magical world, however, each drew on his own peculiarly strong affinity with childhood."" The key there is ""peculiarly,"" because, as she discreetly puts it, ""all shared a reluctance to engage in conventional behavior and relationships."" The creation of those fantasy lands, she argues, was made possible by, and in turn reflected, ""the confidence and prosperity of Britain between 1860 and 1914."" It was a confidence that ""lasted until the First World War, when to die ceased to be the awfully big adventure that Peter Pan had expected."" Ms. Wullschlger, a literary critic and feature writer at The Financial Times in London, thinks that A. A. Milne's work from the 1920's belongs with the others because it was ""a throwback"" and ""nostalgically desperate"" for what had been lost. While she is insightful and clear about all five writers, she is particularly good on Edward Lear. She does not hesitate to address Lear's homosexuality, but she insightfully notes that his relationships with children ""had none of the anguished, knowing intensity of Carroll's or Barrie's."" Lear, she says, ""made child-friends and then let them go, as easily and carelessly as a child on holiday would."" ""The Owl and the Pussycat,"" that most beloved nonsense lyric about ""two odd, sexless, cozy lovers,"" was written shortly after Lear was talked out of making a proposal of marriage to a much younger woman, she observes, and it is a poem of ""hopeful escape.""

Writing in 1975 at the age of 80, the narrator of THE EDUCATION OF OSCAR FAIRFAX (Houghton Mifflin, $22.95) describes his own coming of age with the same ironic detachment. With one grandfather the Episcopal Bishop of New York and the other the founder of an eminent Wall Street law firm, Oscar receives an education that is less sentimental than perfectly decorous, its lessons encouraging Social Register virtues: tact, compromise, genteel humility, excellent manners. After Yale and Columbia Law School, he abandons his dreams of a literary career to join the family legal practice, following his father's advice that it provides the best arena for his ""constant preoccupation,"" people watching. (""He said it didn't matter in which I took the greater interest: the clients or the law."") And there are plenty of opportunities for social observation: a Supreme Court Justice whose opinions on torts and contracts ""read like short stories by Henry James""; a gossipy Hungarian princess who hobnobbed with Proust; a talented bounder who wins a partnership in the Fairfax law firm, marriage to Oscar's sister and national prominence in World War II. There is even a cameo appearance by Edith Wharton, Mr. Auchincloss's literary progenitor, showing off the roses in her garden in France. More a series of vignettes than a novel, the book has a few weak spots: the dialogue can be too starched and frilly, and a Spanish daughter-in-law seems to exist only so that Oscar can deliver opinions on Franco. Yet Mr. Auchincloss's own voice remains a seductive one -- crisp, stately and wonderfully controlled. Donna Rifkind",1996-02-18T05:00:00+0000

In Jerusalem malls at night, even carousing kids wear yarmulkes, and people on the street stare at you if you're a grown woman walking around in pants. Compared with all this piety, the mood in Tel Aviv is stunningly secular. In this city, which variously calls itself the Big Orange, the City That Never Stops, and the City That Never Takes a Break (who writes their p.r., I wonder?), it's hard to imagine anyone looking at you askance about anything. This is the contemporary version of the vision that Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, had of a cosmopolitan city on the sea: Tel Aviv -- literally a hill (man-made) of spring (new life). Where once there was absolutely nothing, there is now an urban sprawl of about 350,000 people -- nearly two million if you count suburbs -- and a lot of awful architecture that springs up from a flat terrain with nowhere to hide. I suppose that depending on whether you come here first or last on a trip to Israel, you say, ""Look what they've accomplished,"" or ""My God,what have they done?"" ",1996-02-18T05:00:00+0000

It's not that you can't look forward anymore to new films that you can admire. But such films not only have to be exceptions -- that's true of great achievements in any art. They have to be actual violations of the norms and practices that now govern movie making everywhere in the capitalist and would-be capitalist world -- which is to say, everywhere. And ordinary films, films made purely for entertainment (that is, commercial) purposes, are astonishingly witless; the vast majority fail resoundingly to appeal to their cynically targeted audiences. While the point of a great film is now, more than ever, to be a one-of-a-kind achievement, the commercial cinema has settled for a policy of bloated, derivative film-making, a brazen combinatory or recombinatory art, in the hope of reproducing past successes. Cinema, once heralded as the art of the 20th century, seems now, as the century closes numerically, to be a decadent art.",1996-02-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Focus on Weston,"Fascination with Edward Weston's tangled personal life, and especially his affair with Tina Modotti, the Italian revolutionary whose own photos now fetch record prices, has threatened to obscure his achievements as a photographer. But the beautiful and thoughtful EDWARD WESTON: Forms of Passion (Abrams, $65) brings the emphasis back where it belongs, to his carefully wrought, searingly direct images. Drawn from two major archives of Weston material -- those of the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson, Ariz., and the Lane Collection at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts -- this lavishly produced book offers a diverse selection of images. These range from the soft-focus pictorialist images of the 1910's that first made Weston's reputation to the pristine close-ups of natural objects of the 1920's and 30's in which he sought to bring out the abstract forms underlying reality. The book closes with the Surrealist-inspired landscapes and somber, death-tinged photographs he made at the end of his career. Essays by leading photographic historians (including Terence Pitts and Trudy Wilner Stack of the Center for Creative Photography and Gilles Mora, a French historian of photography, who edited the book) pay special attention to the interaction between his life and his art, particularly his early work as a portraitist, his trip to Mexico with Modotti and the painful last years before his death at the age of 71 in 1958. The real strength of the book, though, lies in the wealth of little-known images it presents alongside such iconic works as Weston's close-ups of peppers, seashells and cypress roots.

us,Defining Evil,"A HISTORY OF FASCISM, 1914-1945 By Stanley G. Payne. Illustrated. 613 pp. Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press. $39.95. IS fascism a thing of the past? The question has both a theoretical and a practical interest. On the theoretical side we are curious whether fascist movements and regimes are so linked to the conditions of Europe between the world wars that nothing having their peculiar combination of features can be found in other historical contexts -- such as our own. Practically, we are anxious about the future of liberal democracy. We wonder if the increase in economic insecurity that affects almost all of us -- but particularly the middle classes, for whom it remains in some ways a novel experience -- may not provoke a revival of movements of the kind that swept away fragile democracies in the 1930's. Looking at the world around us, it seems that powerful fascist movements do belong to the interwar period and pose no major danger to us now. Except perhaps for Russia, where Vladimir Zhirinovsky's bizarrely misnamed Liberal Democratic Party has evoked comparisons with Hitler's National Socialists in Weimar Germany, no democratic state faces anything that could reasonably be described as a fascist threat. Most democracies contain small groups that are estranged from democratic institutions, some of them -- like those who inspired the Oklahoma bombing or those who daubed European synagogues with anti-Semitic slogans -- willing to resort to terrorist violence. Yet none of these groups are in a position to mount a challenge to a democratic state. Can we then safely write off fascism as largely banished from the world?",1996-02-25T05:00:00+0000

And who can say him nay, especially after seeing the uninhibited figure from Genoa's Staglieno cemetery, passed out backward in apparent ecstasy, barely draped and with a posy of roses tucked in her armpit? Ecstatic, too, is the fully draped maiden in Pre Lachaise in Paris, about to be raised to heaven by a well-muscled angel who is hovering above her with a display of more than brotherly (or perhaps sisterly -- it's hard to tell) interest. But the high-relief carving of a kneeling nude in the Staglieno, roses held strategically in her lap, is as unemotional and non-erotic as could be. And how about the figure of the draped young girl in Paris's Passy cemetery who looks not only demure but totally unconcerned about such matters as love and death? No roses, but her attributes include a Greco-Etruscan helmet and a carved replica of a Bernard Palissy ceramic platter, which leads one to wonder whose monument this is, and why these particular artifacts are to the point. But why quibble? The photographs are beautiful, and beautifully reproduced. Sarah Ferrell",1996-02-25T05:00:00+0000

The menus are eclectic, though most serve some kind of yoshoku, or Western-style, cuisine. From the turn of this century on, the Japanese have been smitten with Western cooking, although many of the dishes that have evolved from this love affair, such as korokke (croquettes) or omuraisu (soft omelets filled with ketchup-flavored pilaf), may not slide easily down an American throat.

At the simplest level, the Fed's choice comes down to this: create jobs and risk inflation, or keep things cool and make the financial markets happy. President Clinton at first wanted a Fed vice chairman, Felix Rohatyn, who would come down on the side of jobs. But Republicans balked, so last week the ever-flexible Mr. Clinton reverted to the slow-and-steady approach. He gave Alan Greenspan a third term as chairman; picked Alice Rivlin, his budget director, as vice chairman, and named Laurence Meyer, an economic consultant, to fill a vacant slot.
