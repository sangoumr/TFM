The delay will enable Russian importers to identify alternative suppliers, he said. Officials are not considering a ban on industrial imports at this time, said Igor Shuvalov, another deputy prime minister. The list of banned items might be expanded in the future, officials said. Among the measures already announced are limits on travel and tourism between the two countries. Russia has spent almost $750 million on importing Turkish fruits and vegetables so far this year, according to government statistics, and Turkey accounted for about 4 percent of all foodstuffs purchased abroad in 2014. About 90 percent of all lemons sold in Russia come from Turkey, as well as significant amounts of tomatoes, grapes and apricots. About 1,250 Turkish trucks are now stacked up along Russias southern border, Interfax reported. ",2015-12-01T03:46:42+0000

Ever since the Babylonians scratched two parallel lines and a circle  representing the Euphrates River and their walled capital  on a clay tablet almost 3,000 years ago, we humans have been producing flat spatial imagery to locate our place in the world. Maps anchor us, give coherence to our environment, help make visual sense of otherwise intangible realities. The most skillfully done maps, moreover, can be thrilling to look at, elevating cartography into art. Renaissance mapmakers filled the borders of their works with beautifully rendered dragons and wind-puffing gods; the modernist painter Jasper Johns playfully reimagined the standard road-atlas depiction of the continental United States in his 1961 work Map. Maps can solidify national identity, expose societal problems, illuminate trends and whip up jingoistic emotions in wartime. The map as a concept is complex and ever changing, the Library of Congress cartography expert John Hessler writes in his introduction to Map: Exploring the World.

Jerry Brown. Residents reduced their water used in October by 22.2 percent compared with 2013, the states lowest conservation rate since mandatory water reductions began in the summer. Over all, residents remain on a pace to meet the 25 percent goal, having saved 27.1 percent over 2013 in the five months from June to October. State water officials have said saving water will be more difficult during the winter because Californians used less water during the winter in years past. They said they expected conservation rates to remain lower during the colder months. I was relieved at the numbers, Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, said of Octobers 22 percent figure. The emergency drought regulations will be in effect through February, but officials are considering a new set of emergency regulations if the drought continues. ",2015-12-02T02:20:40+0000

The only reports of the attack on the convoy were pieced together from distress signals.

Murray Abraham in Gallileo). So its fitting that one of his last productions at the intimate gem of a theater pairs Tonya Pinkins with one of the mightiest roles in the canon, the title character in Brechts Mother Courage and Her Children. In playing the canny survivor ground down by a war-torn world, Ms. Pinkins will be following the likes of Fiona Shaw and Meryl Streep. Ms. Pinkins often seems to elevate her material, but when she sinks into a complex role worthy of her gifts  Caroline, or Change is perhaps the best example  the results can be thrilling. Thats what makes this show such a downtown event. Duncan Sheik, the composer behind Spring Awakening, wrote new music. Mr. Kulick directs.

But I guess no one really did then either. The perfectly preserved, chronologically organized volumes begin soon after 1966, the year the California-born Schlesinger, then 18, met the British painter David Hockney, who was teaching a summer course at U.C.L.A. This was the beginning of a love affair that would take Schlesinger to London, straight into the eye of a twister of bohemian glamour and creativity. While studying painting at the Slade School of Fine Art, he began to capture the most magnetic personalities in the couples social circle with his Pentax camera. There was the fashion designer Ossie Clark and his partner Celia Birtwell, the model Amanda Lear, Manolo Blahnik, Paloma Picasso, Cecil Beaton and the man who would eventually become Schlesingers lifelong partner, the Swedish-born photographer Eric Boman. With a natural, snapshot-like aesthetic, Schlesinger managed to conjure happy, blink-and-theyre-gone moments in time. There were weekend trips to Beatons country house, wine-drenched lunches by the pool at Tony Richardsons in the South of France and late-night dancing at everyones favorite underground club in London, Yours or Mine. These effervescent images became the basis of his first book: Checkered Past, published in 2003. Schlesinger recently released a second volume, Peter Schlesinger: A Photographic Memory 1968-1989 ($50, Damiani), which includes some of his greatest (and formerly unseen) hits from the London years plus images from his life after he and Boman moved to Manhattan 37 years ago. Schlesinger, now a ceramic artist, has lived and worked with Boman in the same former girdle factory in the Flatiron district for these past decades. Four months a year they decamp to their house in Bellport, N.Y., where Boman bakes and Schlesinger tends the garden. These days I take more pictures of my plants than anything else, he says.

She also appeared as a bobblehead doll, a tattoo on a bicep, a decal on a fingernail, and a baby wearing a huge pair of glasses. ",2015-12-04T05:33:12+0000

Hugh Fraser and, later, wife of the playwright Harold Pinter  made the startling discovery that she was not really a girl. That is, having just spent four years learning Greek and Latin at a school for boys (mostly) called the Dragon, next door to her familys home in Oxford, England, she excelled at ancient languages and at the knock-em-sock-em sport of rugby, but was completely unschooled in conventional girlish behavior.

Her parents had just split up, and whenever her dad would send Wilson on a train back to her mothers house, hed buy her a magazine and a box of chocolate-coated malted milk balls, something that, before her parents divorce, would have been deemed a special-occasion treat. She felt powerless to refuse the candy, even as she was struggling with a disconcerting weight gain. It took Wilson years to realize that her fathers gesture was as much about making him feel like the generous provider as it was to reward her with a happy sugar high. She writes: To give a child the things she loves to eat bestows a heroic glow. It feels almost as wonderful as eating.",2015-12-04T06:14:00+0000

One wakes her in the morning by throwing up on the edge of her pillow. Her drug of choice is black coffee.

Always use a sharp blade, says Eddy, who prefers a carbon steel scalpel. Peel the skin back as you would an orange. Trim carefully around the paws, mouth, nose and eyes.

The population, amounting to 183,000, reached this morning to 400,000 by the influx of foreign Princes and their suites, crowds of Belgians, Germans, Luxemburgers and Dutch provincials; 25,000 visitors came from Amsterdam alone, and many spent the night in the streets, finding no lodgings. Many of the streets were decked with tricolor flags, and the balconies and windows were decorated with black hangings. Wooden stands for sightseers were erected in all the streets, in the shop fronts and even on the decks of the barges on the canals, and places were paid for at extraordinary prices.

You know how it works: A restaurant moves into an underserved area, attracts attention, then a crowd, and then other restaurants and larger crowds. Before you know it, the original restaurant can no longer afford to remain in the very neighborhood it helped create. Thats exactly what happened to Union Square Cafe, Danny Meyers flagship bistro. After 30 years, the restaurant is relocating from its perch on East 16th Street to the other side of Union Square. In celebration of the move, Mr. Meyer created the 12 Nights of Union Square Cafe, a three-course menu for $85 available through Dec. 12.",2015-12-04T18:48:20+0000
us,"In Miami, a Trio of Minimalist Paintings","Its undeniable that figuration stands tall in todays art market  bodies of all shapes and sizes are in evidence throughout the Miami art fairs and are the subject of one of the most buzzed-about pop-up exhibitions in town, Unrealism, at the Design Districts Moore Building, curated by the heavyweight double bill of Jeffrey Deitch and Larry Gagosian. However, as soon as a trend hits a saturation point, the window opens wide for a counterpoint. Throughout Art Basel Miami Beach, there are a number of strikingly spare paintings whose minimal, monochromatic brushstrokes bear uncanny superficial resemblances, despite originating from very different times and places. The 78-year-old Swiss painter Niele Toroni is known for applying short, squarish acrylic streaks of a prescribed size in strict patterns; he has new works on offer at a number of booths, including Alfonso Artiaco. On offer at Greene Naftali is a historical work by the recently deceased German painter Gunther Forg  who, though prolific like Toroni, is known for constant variation rather than repetition. Finally, the Paris-based South Korean artist Lee Ufans canvas of two blocky gray smears at Galerie Nchst St. Stephan Rosemarie Schwarzwlder is discreetly rooted in the natural origin of its materials, which combine oil with pigments of stone.",2015-12-04T19:00:15+0000

The motive for the attack and the identity of the attackers were not clear on Saturday. The fair, which has been held in the district for years, includes secular cultural events and often has many non-Hindu attendees, Mr. Iltutmish said. The Hindu population in Bangladesh has been dwindling for decades, down to about 8 percent of the total population of the largely Muslim country in 2011. The government has denied that the Islamic State is carrying out attacks in the country, instead identifying suspects associated with the Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party associated with the political opposition. No group has yet claimed responsibility for Saturdays attack. Mohammad Ruhul Amin, the police superintendent in Dinajpur, said that at least four people had been detained for questioning in connection with the attack, but that no arrests had been made.

Its organization, however, is slow, and its intervention cannot be regarded as imminent.

It is asserted among German officers in Constantinople that the expedition against Egypt will set out about the beginning of next month.

Calvin insisted that divine wisdom was one such given, perceived only within radical limits.

The body of work he made over the next two years, eventually exhibited and published as American Surfaces, feels oddly familiar now. With its flatness and indiscriminate subject matter, it looks just like the stuff people put on Instagram.

The thing about music is that its so democratic, and art isnt, Kass said when T visited her studio last month. Throughout the show, the artist alludes to popular song lyrics from a wide swath of eras, from the 1895 waltz The Band Played On to Fats Wallers 1929 (What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue to Katy Perrys 2010 Teenage Dream. The references are diverse, but taken as a whole, their message is clear: a deep-seated, and deeply droll, cynicism about the present political and artistic climate, and about our capacity to fiddle while Rome burns.

The virus then spread from Liberia back into Guinea, where the current epidemic was first identified. Scientists analyzed genomic sequences from 140 blood samples, nearly 2 percent of all reported cases in Liberia, collected over 11 months, after a smaller outbreak had been controlled. Liberia had no new Ebola cases last week, and a recent cluster was most likely linked to a rare case of transmission from a survivor, officials said Wednesday. ",2015-12-10T01:56:17+0000

With her Honesty Pictures series, the artist Alice Cazenave aims to find out, by capturing the delicate inner workings of leaves and stems. Inspired by her background in molecular science as well as her family history of craftspeople (her relatives have included cabinetmakers and draftswomen), Cazenave employs experimental, camera-free techniques to get at the essence of plants. She strips the leaves of pigment by washing them in chemical solutions that transform them into translucent, glassy structures, then uses them directly as negatives, placing them onto photosensitive paper and then exposing them to light. She doesnt use lenses or screens, in an effort to create images as a direct consequence of an interaction between light and object, she says. This series is intended to capture a sense of shadows peeled off the real  and to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to a medium that has become almost universally accessible. Much of my work comments on the growing disengagement with the natural world, and aims to re-establish a sense of magic and alchemy to photography, which I feel in recent times has been lost.",2015-12-10T18:33:30+0000

The mother telegraphed to an undertaker in that town ordering an elaborate coffin, and requesting that the remains should be sent home for burial. Just before the funeral on Sunday the mother had the coffin opened, and found that it contained, not her child, but the body of an old officer in Russian uniform. On making inquiries she learned by telegram from Nice that the bodies had been accidentally exchanged. Her daughters body had been forwarded to Smolensk in Russia instead of that of the officer. On telegraphing to the Russian authorities Madame Wachterhausen was informed that the body of her daughter had just been buried with great ceremony and military honors.

But with around 250 gas wells drilled within Dentons city limits, the subject was thrust upon his consciousness. A member of the City Council asked him to form a citizens advisory group for gas-well regulations, and Briggle became a field philosopher, running across highways, helping collect air samples from backyards, consulting not only Mary Shelley and the theologian Duns Scotus to help guide him along the arduous trail that is thinking but also scientists, engineers, mayors, neighbors and his daughter, Lulu, a 2-year-old rogue impervious to propaganda.",2015-12-11T16:06:16+0000

It doesnt matter whether you are having trouble moving forward from the wrongs that were done to you, or whether you need the courage to admit the wrongs you have done, he writes in the introduction. Forgiveness is nothing less than the way we heal the world. We heal the world by healing each and every one of our hearts. If that kind of talk triggers flashbacks to your last cardiologist visit  the best way to heal our hearts is probably to eat less bacon  it remains true that Tutu writes with undeniable moral force. And given his experiences leading the Truth and Reconciliation Commission after apartheids fall, his prescription is not just simple but consistent and radical. In South Africa, we chose to seek forgiveness rather than revenge, he writes. That choice averted a blood bath. For every injustice, there is a choice. ... You can choose forgiveness or revenge, but revenge is always costly. Choosing forgiveness rather than retaliation ultimately serves to make you a stronger and freer person. As it happens, your cardiologist might agree. According to the Johns Hopkins Medicine website, Studies have found that the act of forgiveness can reap huge rewards for your health, lowering the risk of heart attack; improving cholesterol levels and sleep; and reducing pain, blood pressure and levels of anxiety, depression and stress.",2015-12-11T16:42:52+0000

us,William H. Gasss Eyes and John Barths Collected Stories,"Every so often a magazine with curatorial or prophetic aspirations  say, Granta or The New Yorker  produces a list of the best writers under 40 from a particular nation state. The underlying principle isnt much more than the logic of the marketplace  the search for the new commodity, explicitly applied to literature. But these lists are haunted by a cluster of unspoken questions about writings relationship to longevity. Are writers so short of material that they need to be anointed before midlife? Is novelistic craft not perfected over time? If the answers to these questions arent obvious, why not imagine a shadow list that gathers the best American fiction by writers over 80? William H. Gass  91 years old at the time of writing  would certainly benefit from such a list, since his work typically gestates across decades. He labored on his central achievement, The Tunnel (1995), for longer than some acclaimed young novelists have been alive, while his latest volume, Eyes, has similarly been in the pipeline at least since the turn of the millennium.",2015-12-11T17:18:35+0000

Hualianceratops and another dinosaur from the region, named Yinlong downsi, are the two oldest known ceratopsians, so-called horned dinosaurs, although neither the Hualianceratops nor Yinlong had horns. There were dozens of species of ceratopsians, but Triceratops, which lived in North America about 65 million years ago, is the best known. These small dinosaurs were related to Triceratops, but very distantly, said Catherine A. Forster, a paleontologist at George Washington University and one of the team who discovered Hualianceratops. She and her colleagues recovered a partial skull and hind leg, and described their findings in the journal PLOS One.",2015-12-11T18:18:19+0000

Mr. DeWine said that sending aborted fetuses to a landfill was callous and completely inhumane and violated a state administrative code requirement that fetuses be disposed of in a humane manner. He referred his findings to the Ohio Department of Health, which oversees abortion clinics. Stephanie Kight, the president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, issued a statement calling the accusations inflammatory and baseless. She said Planned Parenthood handles medical tissue like any other quality health care provider. Our agreements with vendors all require them to follow state law, and dispose of tissue accordingly. If they are not, then I will take swift action. Ms. Kight said she was concerned that the attorney generals report was not the result of meaningful investigation, but instead yet another attack on womens access to health care in the state of Ohio.

From twenty-five to fifty Indians were killed in the struggle. This report is confirmed by friendly Indians who escaped to the Agency during the fight. The depredations of the Indians now extend to the foot of the Black Hills. It is thought to be useless to talk of peace at present. There has been no attempt by the hostile Indians to move out of their entrenchments since the peace council was held. Official despatches received at Washington state that the situation in the Indian territories is favorable, and that the display of troops has demoralized the hostile Indians.

In modern business, thinking strategically has become a clich entirely devoid of meaning. But in the military, its meaning remains quite precise.

A hard-to-classify volume of prose poems, or lyrical essays, about daily encounters with racism  I wanted to replicate the sense of having these stories come at you, Rankine told The New Statesman  the book has also spent time on the paperback nonfiction list and, more counterintuitively, the monthly relationships list. (One place it hasnt appeared yet is the monthly politics list, although that may change now that a young woman in Illinois was spotted reading it at a Trump rally.) The people who compile the Times lists arent the only ones who have struggled to define Rankines book. Last winter, Citizen became the first title ever nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award in two categories: A finalist in criticism, it won in poetry. So what is this book, exactly? And how does Rankine feel about efforts to pin it down? If we leave the structural hybridity of Citizen aside, she told me via email, I want to believe there is a recognized veracity of experience for the people categorizing the book. Each feels Citizen satisfies some truth or intention for their category. I am a poet, and I didnt fictionalize the accounts told to me or taken from my life or from the news; I simply submerged my thinking into the ethical loneliness (a phrase taken from the title of Jill Stauffers excellent book) that the sentences accumulated. The lyrical reflection of lives struggling to negotiate racism in our culture apparently feels authentic to many categories. That seems right.

It is a phrase that promotes its author as an arbiter of grace, a lofty perch indeed from which to view us mere clumsy mortals. And so, Sarah L. Kaufman, in her first book, sets the stakes perilously high, particularly since her subject is not exactly origami but grace, that fragile, exquisite, transient entity of unparalleled depth, breadth, complexity and profundity. She has taken on, perhaps to her credit, the Sisyphean task of persuading us to choose grace over ego and so revisits that epic battle where grace loses every time  though ego never wins.

He and his colleagues compared the genome sequences of 19 wolves, 25 village dogs descended from indigenous dogs, and 46 domesticated dogs belonging to 34 breeds. Village dogs were more genetically diverse than domesticated dogs, and wolves were the most diverse of all. Domesticated dogs had roughly 115 more deleterious genetic variants that altered proteins than wolves. Dr. Lohmueller and his colleagues reported their findings in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",2015-12-21T20:00:22+0000

Im not sure exactly how long this has been going on. Last year, for instance, the nation formed from the 1707 Act of Union between the English and Scottish crowns very nearly tore itself apart de jure, holding a nervous and fractured referendum on Scottish independence. The vote was eventually won by the No camp, preserving Britain as a political entity, but it was clear the moral victory had been lost regardless. The Yes campaign made an exciting and convincing case for an independent Scotland, to which people could be proud to belong. The No campaign, by contrast, utterly failed to make anything like a case for Britain as a concept  only a case that it was safer financially to preserve it. (For the time being, anyway: With our government apparently engaged in the project of extracting as much short-term value from the nations assets as possible, you worry that the very ground beneath your feet might vanish the moment it ceases to help some banker in Londons spreadsheet add up.)",2015-12-21T20:31:57+0000

So Paulos governor, Geraldo Alckmin, told reporters that the firefighter, Ronaldo Pereira da Cruz, had died at a hospital. The museum is closed on Mondays, a fact that probably averted additional casualties. The museum, in a building in the historic city center that is more than 100 years old, is considered a trove of information on the history and evolution of the Portuguese language. Early signs suggest that the cultural loss may be minimized. We probably have many things backed up, Isa Ferraz, a curator at the museum, told the Brazilian television station Globo.

The plot this time has something to do with genetically engineered superhumans and the Apollo 11 moon landing and the supposed remains of Adam and Eve, which gives you an idea why Rollins sells so many copies; hes what you might end up with if you tossed Michael Crichton and Dan Brown into a particle accelerator together. Rollins has long been an unabashed book nerd  in high school, he wore a Keep On Tolkien T-shirt  but he didnt try his hand at writing novels until he had worked for some years as a veterinarian. That career influenced his thinking in this book, he told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, especially about evolution and intelligence: I wanted to explore one of the big anthropological mysteries: How come, even though the human brain has remained about the same size for the past 200,000 years, there was a sudden explosion of ingenuity and creativity about 50,000 years ago? Anthropologists call it the Great Leap Forward, and it has baffled them as to what exactly the trigger for it was. Why did human intelligence suddenly surge ahead? I also had a file on Neanderthals. I found it curious that, at roughly the same time, 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals and modern man started to interact and breed, passing Neanderthal DNA into our lineage. No one has addressed the possibility that maybe this was the trigger. I have a background as a veterinarian, so Im familiar with the fact that if you cross a donkey and a horse to get a mule, the mule has been shown to be a more intelligent animal than the donkey or the horse. I started thinking, What if this kind of crossbreeding is the source of the Great Leap Forward? Thats how my stories build.

His work is singular in American poetry for marrying goofball humor and childish jouissance to a lyricism that never seems cheap or self-serious  an unusual achievement. Now we have his 17th book of verse, Dome of the Hidden Pavilion, which, like many of his recent books, is composed of prose-poem-like narratives about surreal small-town encounters.

Yet, it was only with his 1936 feature Osaka Elegy that, by some accounts, Mr. Mizoguchi felt he had finally found his artistic footing. Chrysanthemum, set in late 19th-century Japan, tells the story of Kikunosuke (Shotaro Hanayagi), an egotistic Kabuki actor, and Otoku (Kakuko Mori), who sacrifices her own happiness to help him achieve greatness.",2015-12-24T21:00:19+0000

The hunters, who included some senior members of Qatars royalty, were seized by unidentified gunmen, and there has been no word on their whereabouts or the demands  if any  made by the kidnappers. In a statement reported by Qatars official news agency, the Arab League foreign ministers, meeting in Cairo, expressed full solidarity with Qatars government in efforts to secure the release of the hunters, who had entered Iraq legally. Their uncertain fate has strained relations between Sunni-dominated Qatar and the Shiite-led government of Iraq, amid speculation that Shiite militia members in southern Iraq may have been responsible. Iraqs foreign minister, Ibrahim al-Jafari, has denied suggestions that his government had anything to do with the abduction.

The defendants, Mohammed Rehman, 25, and Sana Ahmed Khan, 24, were sentenced by Judge Jeremy Baker one day after their conviction in a trial known as the 7/7 bombers case, named for the date in 2005 when suicide bombers in the transit system killed 52 people in London. Under British law, Mr. Rehman must serve at least 27 years and Ms. Khan 25 years. Mr. Rehman, who had referred to himself as the Silent Bomber on social media, was arrested in May after having posted a message that asked: Westfield shopping centre or London underground? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. According to evidence and testimony presented in court, the police seized explosives and bomb-making chemicals from Mr. Rehmans house in the city of Reading, west of London. In sentencing the defendants, Judge Baker was quoted by the BBC as saying their intended actions included a suicide bombing, an act which envisaged martyrdom, a notion specifically resurrected by Islamic State in order to encourage this type of venture.

Washington","One hundred and sixty odd years ago, Ignaz Semmelweis realized that physicians who didnt wash their hands were carrying tiny germs from bedside to bedside and causing the childbed fever that killed many women. After doctors began washing their hands, fewer women died. The series of realizations in the 19th century that germs  bacteria and viruses  caused diseases like cholera and tuberculosis and influenza ushered in modern medicine. Mortality rates declined; children lived longer. Germ theory had a dramatic clarity to it. It pushed medicine away from holistic conceptions of illness as imbalance toward conceptions of illness as a specific entity. You get the germ, you fall sick, you take antibiotics or fight it off (or die). Ironically, though, the tidiness of this relationship helped obscure cases where germs may have less direct but still devastating effects  a complex reality we are now beginning to understand better.",2015-12-31T16:32:03+0000
