us,A Housing House of Cards,"Financial innovations by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have contributed to sucessful growth of homeownership and largely contributed positively to the housing boom of the past five years. But more than a few critics have said that the innovations are little more than a housing version of gambling in Las Vegas. According to Dudley Baker at www.preciousmetalswarrants.com and subscriber postings to the site, Fannie and Freddie have set up the market for a finanical meltdown should the Federal Reserve increase interest rates. Baker says the meltdown could come as soon as this year with more interest rate increases expected. Amid growing concerns, Freddie Mac CEO and Chairman Richard Syron has defended the company saying it posed no special risk to finanical markets. RON NIXON",2006-02-01T00:38:48+0000

Ralph was a life long resident of NYC, born of immigrant parents, Benjamin and Sophie, in 1915. His childhood was immersed with the joys of dance, opera, the Yiddish Theater, and a precious friendship with Manny Dichter. He was blessed to find his true love, Elsie, at 16 and spent the next 73 years with her at his side through all life's joys and travails. He had a long creative career as a marketing executive holding senior positions at Bulova, Lucien Piccard, including Vice President and Secretary at Gruen. A talented tennis player since childhood, he competed in many tournaments including winning the Sears Tennis Tournament in his 70's beating competitors 30 years his junior.

A Shakespeare enthusiast, he often quoted from his work to make points and entertain friends and family. After his retirement he volunteered at LIJ Hospital where he organized educational conferences and read to seriously ill children. He was appointed by the Governor to the Board of Visitors of Queens Children's Psychiatric Center & was its Secretary. He was a fearless fighter for children against the political powers favoring funding cuts for the disadvantaged. He sponsored dance therapy programs and donated musical equipment through the Ralph and Elsie Somerfield Arts Enrichment Fund. He attended every class conducted by the Ailey dance teachers. He enjoyed lively debates at Temple Beth-El Torah study. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Elsie.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   SUESHOLTZ, HENRICK DANIEL ''HERB''","SUESHOLTZ--Henrick Daniel ""Herb"". 91, Pioneer in TV and Picture - framing industries. Herb Suesholtz was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn in 1914. In 1935 he received a degree in chemical engineering from prestigious Cooper Union. During the war years he worked for RCA under an important government contract. Mr. Suesholtz was among the lead engineers in developing the radar tubes utilized by American navel vessels. This experience led him to a similar position with RCA following the war's conclusion. In 1946 Mr. Suesholtz left RCA to join tiny Transvision of New Rochelle, NY. He would eventually become president of the company and under his stewardship Transvision became the nation's third leading manufacturer of TV sets, trailing only Zenith and RCA. In addition, Mr. Suesholtz's leadership enabled Transvision to accomplish some firsts in the industry. Such innovations that are now taken for granted -remote control units, cable systems, and ""educational TV"" were introduced by Transvision. During the 1950's Transvision established a picturetube plant in Cuba only to have it ""nationalized"" by Cuba's communist regime. In fact, Mr. Suesholtz was in Cuba at the time Castro and his pary seized power. Though he lost his factory, Mr. Suesholtz did make friends among his Cuban employees, helping several to escape to the U.S. Though he left the television industry in the early 60's, Mr. Suesholtz carried his innovative spirit with him to his next endeavor. In 1969 he acquired the Gaines picture frame moulding factory, renamed it Gaines-American Moulding Corp., and introduced perhaps the greatest change in that industry with the introduction of ""chop service."" This enabled many entrepreneurs with little money to establish their own businesses. First met with almost unanimous opposition from the industry, ""chop service"" is now such a staple of the framing industry that it is more or less taken for granted. From 1982 until his death Mr. Suesholtz worked as an independent sales rep., but never lost his zeal for innovation and invention, evidenced by his registration of four U.S. patents that continue to shape the picture-framing industry. He was noted for stating, many times, that the only disappointment of his life was the loss of his son, Jay B., to leukemia in 1990. However, Mr. Suesholtz is survived by his wife, Florence Monaco Suesholtz of Harrison, NY, son William Suesholtz of Harrison, daughters Wendy Chazin and Amy Cooper of Manhattan, step-son Robert Miraglia of Arizona, and grandson Christipher Chazin of Manhattan. Mr. Suesholtz's family will be receiving friends on Friday between 12 noon and 1PM. Interment to follow at the Greenwood Union Cemetery, Rye, NY.

On Feb. 20, Mr. Roberts becomes senior national correspondent at CNN, a posting that enables him to contribute to programs across that cable channel's lineup, Jon Klein, president of CNN's domestic operations, said in a statement. Mr. Roberts, who joined CBS in 1992 as anchor of the ""CBS Morning News"" and has covered the White House for the network for more than six years, becomes one of the more recognizable reporters on the CNN roster. Any chance that Mr. Roberts had of succeeding Mr. Rather -- a plan favored by several senior CBS News executives -- effectively evaporated after Mr. Rather stepped down as anchor amid the fallout of a disputed ""60 Minutes Wednesday"" segment about President Bush's Vietnam-era National Guard service. At the time, Leslie Moonves, chairman of CBS, said he hoped the news division would consider scrapping a single anchor format. Sean McManus, the new president of CBS News, said at a gathering of television critics last month that he expected to name a solo anchor -- and preferably an outsider -- as a permanent successor to Mr. Rather.

Televisa, which is based in Mexico City, owns about 11 percent of Univision and has been openly critical of Univision's chairman, A. Jerrold Perenchio.

She was an inspiring champion of racial and economic justice, peace and the rights of working women. She was a lifelong foe of racism, poverty and violence. She lived a life of strength, grace, principle, sacrifice and beauty. Mrs. King first met 1199ers through her husband, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s close association with our union. After his tragic death in 1968 she became a regular at 1199 rallies, picketlines and cultural events. Members from Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore to Hahneman Hospital in Philadelphia to St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan remember meeting her at rallies outside their workplaces. At 1199 conventions and Black History month celebrations she repeatedly called for justice for working mothers. But her most enduring association with 1199 hospital workers came in 1969 during the 100-day strike of 400 black women at two Charleston, South Carolina hospitals. Mrs. King marched, led prayer vigils, spoke in churches and buoyed the spirits of Charleston strikers in an inspiring display of leadership that fused soul power and union power.

Myers defends the creation of chimeras as legitimate and useful scientific research, such as when scientists insert human genes into mice to create an animal model of Down syndrome, so that, for example, we could figure out exactly what gene overdose is causing the immune system problems or the heart defects, and develop better treatments for them.  The New Republics Ryan Lizza says President Bushs SOTU isolationist-bashing was really aimed at the growing ranks of Buchananite Republicans, not antiwar Democrats.  Matthew Yglesias says even if Lizza is right, Bush is misappropriating the term: If by isolationist we mean opposed to preventative warfare against potential WMD proliferators then every president in American history except George W. Bush was an isolationist. If by isolationist we mean doesnt want to use military force to halt genocides then every president except Bill Clinton is an isolationist. I would suggest that definitions of the term that lead to the conclusion that presidents Truman, Kennedy, and Reagan were all leading isolationists is pretty obviously mistaken.

Spevok, of Kenilworth, IL, on Sunday, January 29, 2006 in an auto accident. Beloved husband of Elisabeth (nee Pratt), loving father of Katherine, Eleanor, and Phillip, loved son of Stanley and Catherine. Greg was a Managing Director of the Corporate and Real Estate Capital Markets Groups at LaSalle Bank Corporation. He enjoyed an outstanding reputation at the forefront of the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities business. Not only was Greg a charismatic and compelling leader, but he possessed an impressive technical command of the real estate lending business. In spite of his professional success, Greg was always humble and approachable. Competitors routinely sought his counsel, and, like those who worked with him, considered Greg to be a steadfast friend. His real estate lending career was extensive. Prior to LaSalle, he was the Director of Originations for Bear Stearns' CMBS unit, where he built the firm's nationwide source network as a member of the senior management team that repeatedly set the CMBS industry's record subordination levels. Previously, he established FINOVA Capital's East Coast commercial real estate lending practice. He also created and led the real estate lending program for Dai Ichi Kangyo Bank's Tokyo Leasing (USA). He began his career as an Analyst in the Financial Institutions Group of First National Bank of Chicago, for which he served in both Chicago and New York. His integrity, acumen and reputation, led to LaSalle Bank hiring Greg to head its CMBS operation out of Chicago. Under Greg's leadership, LaSalle Bank's CMBS unit met with great success. Greg oversaw the unit's growth from a nominal regional player to one of the dominant forces in real estate loan securitization. Greg also served as the driving force behind the emergence of the Bank's Multifamily Finance Group as a ""top 3"" provider of capital to the apartment and manufactured housing sectors. In 1992, he was the principal founder of the Real Estate Lender's Association, Inc., the largest lenders-only commercial real estate organization in the U.S. Other involvements include Sustaining Fellow of the Art Institute of Chicago; the Founder's Council of the Field Museum; the Real Estate Roundtable's Capital Advisory Policy committee; and the Board of Directors of the National Multi Housing Council. Services will be held Friday, 2:00 at the Holy Comforter Church, 222 Kenilworth Avenue, Kenilworth, Illinois.

us,IN THE COUNTRY,"The pianist Morten Qvenild has had a hand in some of Norway's most expressive postmodern jazz ensembles, including the electronic juggernaut Jaga Jazzist, the powder-keg outfit known as Shining and a supergroup called the National Bank. Left to his own devices, Mr. Qvenild seems to favor a more intimate sensibility: In the Country, his acoustic trio with the bassist Roger Arntzen and the drummer Pal Hausken (above center, with Mr. Arntzen, left and Mr. Qvenild), wrings dramatic suspense out of slender quietude and shimmering abstraction. Last year the group issued a gorgeous debut album -- aptly titled ""This Was the Pace of My Heartbeat"" (Rune Grammofon) -- which occasionally invokes the supple pointillism of the pianist Paul Bley and the drummer Paul Motian. (At other times, its monumental dynamic range and stately thematic development can bring the Bad Plus to mind.) More than anything, the album underscores a collective reverence for melody; Mr. Qvenild's songs have the simplicity of folk lullabies, and he takes virtually no liberties with the two songs he didn't compose, the Handel aria ""Lascia ch'io pianga"" and the Ryan Adams ballad ""In My Time of Need."" There's no telling whether the dynamic will mutate with the addition of the guitarist Marc Ribot, who joins In the Country for the group's United States debut at Tonic next week. Adding another layer of mystery, the evening will also include a set by Lars Horntveth, the charismatic saxophonist, guitarist and keyboardist who leads Jaga Jazzist. Mr. Horntveth's most recent solo effort, ""Pooka"" (Smalltown Supersound), reimagines a Gil Evans-style orchestration for a nine-piece string ensemble, with electronic percussion; this will be his United States debut, too.

us,NILAJA SUN,"If there were an award for best performance in the worst role, Nilaja Sun would be a leading candidate, since she manages to brighten an otherwise dim formula comedy in ""Huck & Holden."" This ditsy cross-cultural romance about an awkward Indian student who falls for an African-American librarian includes several characters who appear in dream sequences, including Ms. Sun's Kali, the Indian goddess. Any talented actor can shine in a great play, but it takes a true professional to make weak material look good. To be fair, the comedy is good for a few laughs if you like the kind of humor practiced by the writers of the ""American Pie"" movies. If not, you can admire the performance of Ms. Sun (above right), who arrives late in a screamingly loud costume with four arms and delivers her admonishments with so much comic energy and conviction that she forces you to pay attention. It almost seems as if she's acting in her own show, which makes sense, since Ms. Sun -- whose performance in her homage to Spalding Gray, ""Blues for a Gray Sun,"" proved that she can be both subtle and broad -- has written and starred in several one-woman shows. Her next one, ""No Child,"" opens in May at the Beckett Theater and is directed by Hal Brooks (""Thom Pain""). Best to keep a close eye on her.

This ditsy cross-cultural romance about an awkward Indian student who falls for an African-American librarian includes several characters who appear in dream sequences, including Ms. Sun's Kali, the Indian goddess. Any talented actor can shine in a great play, but it takes a true professional to make weak material look good. To be fair, the comedy is good for a few laughs if you like the kind of humor practiced by the writers of the ""American Pie"" movies. If not, you can admire the performance of Ms. Sun (above right), who arrives late in a screamingly loud costume with four arms and delivers her admonishments with so much comic energy and conviction that she forces you to pay attention. It almost seems as if she's acting in her own show, which makes sense, since Ms. Sun A whose performance in her homage to Spalding Gray, ""Blues for a Gray Sun,"" proved that she can be both subtle and broad A has written and starred in several one-woman shows. Her next one, ""No Child,"" opens in May at the Beckett Theater and is directed by Hal Brooks (""Thom Pain""). Best to keep a close eye on her.

But ""American Idol"" was new, and slaughtered everything in its path, giving Fox another victory for the night. The talent competition, which apparently found few good singers in its auditions in Austin, Tex., delivered an estimated audience of 30.15 million. At 9 p.m. on Fox, an episode of ""Bones"" again lost a significant portion of ""Idol"" viewers, bringing in 12.61 million. Though the bantering procedural placed first among adults 18 to 49 for the hour, a rerun of CBS's ""Criminal Minds"" attracted a larger audience (13.28 million). The cable-news broadcast of the State of the Union address on Tuesday resulted in the usual pecking order: Fox News (6.46 million), CNN (2.22 million), MSNBC (707,000). Fox News and CNN brought in more viewers for the speech than they did for last year's low-rated address: CNN nearly doubled its 2005 audience, while Fox News had an 8 percent increase.

Weekly said that a memoirist calling himself Nasdijj, whose three books under that name are about the troubled life of an American Indian man, is actually Timothy Barrus, left, a white man who has written gay pornography. In the three Nasdijj books, he says he was born on a Navajo reservation and was raped by his white father, and describes in hyperpoetic style a life of hardship and loss. One book, ""The Boy and the Dog Are Sleeping,"" was one of five winners of the 2004 PEN/Beyond Margins Awards for writers of color, and another, ""The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams,"" was a finalist for a PEN memoir award. Michael Roberts, the executive director of PEN, said the center would not rescind the Margins prize since it did not come with any money, but he added that from now on publishers and individuals who nominate writers will be asked to confirm the writers' eligibility. According to L.A. Weekly, Nasdijj posted a statement on his Web site (www.nasdijj.typepad.com) using his real name; the name has since been removed. DINITIA SMITH",2006-02-04T05:00:00+0000

It's also one that Isaacson, who is the president and C.E.O. of the Aspen Institute, a public policy center, finds hard to answer. As a former managing editor of Time magazine and chairman of CNN, Isaacson is aware of how the press can and should function, but he is also the author of a biography of Henry Kissinger and the co-author, with Evan Thomas, of ""The Wise Men,"" a study of six policy makers who helped guide the country through the early years of the cold war. ""During my years as a journalist,"" he wrote in an e-mail message, ""one of the most sensitive issues was balancing security concerns with our instinct to report everything we knew. Now, given the terrorist threat, it's even more difficult. I would be inclined these days to hold back information if it could help terrorists. Yet at a certain point, in a constitutional democracy, you need to debate policies that might lead to torture or unauthorized wiretapping.

It felt free. Icarus caught tremendous air, as the saying goes, and launched himself through the sky. He could sense the temperature rising.

The administration, trustees and staff of St. Francis Hospital, The Heart Center in Roslyn, New York, mourn the passing of Sister Jean M. Pignone of the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary. Sister Jean served St. Francis Hospital in a number of different capacities for over 50 years and was a living and spiritual bridge from the hospital's early days as a summer camp for children to its position today as one of the nation's leading heart centers. Sister Jean was a much beloved member of the St. Francis family. She began her service in 1941 as one of 55 nuns caring for 200 underprivileged children with rheumatic heart disease who lived at the St. Francis Sanatorium. In addition to cooking, cleaning, and providing nursing care, her work included traveling to local farms and asking for contributions of produce to help feed the children. Later, when the institution opened its doors to adult patients and became St. Francis Hospital, Sister Jean directed the volunteers at the information desk and was always a welcoming and cheering presence. Throughout her service, Sister Jean's steadfast commitment to philanthropy became legendary. We will be forever grateful to Sister Jean for her selfless dedication to St. Francis Hospital and her love for all the members of our family. We will cherish her legacy and always be inspired by her example. We extend our deepest sympathies to Sister Jean's family and to the many friends who were touched by her devoted, caring and generous spirit.",2006-02-05T05:00:00+0000

Bergsjon resembles the places Swedes love to retreat to in midsummer -- quiet, pristine, speckled with lakes and smelling of evergreen trees -- but it is only a short tram ride away from the city's giant SKF ball-bearing plant. The center has no cars. Its 14,500 people live in apartments set within a lasso-shaped ring road, on grassy hills that climb toward the country's rustic uplands.

His children Jodi, Marc and Robin, his grandson Morgan, and a loving extended family survive him. David was a graduate of Stamford High, Class of 1940. After graduation he served as an officer and fighter pilot in the United States Air Force. His passion for all things cars, especially racecars, led him to a highly accomplished career in the automotive world. He was a regular and distinguished competitor at Sebring, America's premier race. Between 1952 and 1957, David earned the title of ""Mr. MG"" as the only driver to start and finish five twelve-hour-long endurance races at Sebring in five tries. He also set numerous ""land speed"" records on the Bonneville Salt Flats in 1957. David later pursued a career in automotive journalism. His pieces appeared in ""The New York Times,"" ""Argosy Magazine"" and ""Esquire Magazine."" He also served as publisher and editor of ""Sports Car Magazine,"" and from 1966-1977 authored and published ""Automobile Almanac."" An avid sports fan, he ""Loved the Yankees, and never, ever gave up on the NY Giants."" His most cherished times were spent with his children on Fire Island, fishing, swimming and glassing.

Road flares, bonfires and huge banners, fans surging over crowd-control barriers and throwing things: it's a perfect maelstrom of danger, passion and fun, often accented by a drifting pall of colored smoke that obscures the field for the game's first 20 minutes.",2006-02-05T05:00:00+0000

us,The Way We Eat: Schnitzel on the Brain,"Fifty-odd years ago, the journalist Joseph Wechsberg introduced many Americans to the pleasures of Austro-Hungarian food, but somehow the cuisine faded in the shadow of French cooking. Such fare may not quite be trendy these days, but it has at last gained a certain gravity and visibility, thanks largely to Kurt Gutenbrunner, the New York City chef and restaurateur. He recently added Blaue Gans, a fifth, more casual restaurant with German leanings, to his collection of Walls, Caf Sabarsky, Caf Fledermaus and Thor. Unlike David Bouley, whose well-regarded Danube plays with certain Austro-Hungarian dishes, Gutenbrunner makes it his mission to introduce fusion-minded customers to such unadulterated classics as kavalierspitz (boiled beef served with apple horseradish, potatoes and creamed spinach). ""I cook it the same way every single day,"" he said. ""This is what classical musicians do: they play a classic well, doing it over and over again the right way."" The truth is, Americans might not recognize his masterly technique. They need a little tutorial in the Austro-Hungarian culinary canon -- the schnitzels, spaetzles, goulashes and all those astounding pastries.

Curry, it turns out, is a British classification, a catchall based on a term used by Portuguese colonists, ""who described as 'caril' or 'carree' the broths that the Indians 'made with butter, the pulp of Indian nuts . . . and all sorts of spices.' "" Indeed, the poor British come in for frequent roastings by Collingham: as gluttons during their colonial rule over India (loading their tables with ""turkeys that you could not see over""); culinary philistines (""there was virtually nothing that the British would not stew in curry sauce""); and bigots (""the consumption of large quantities of curry has not necessarily made the British any less racist""). Collingham, a historian by training, builds her book dish by dish, starting with chicken tikka masala. As the cuisine changes with new ingredients like the chili pepper (which arrived in India in the early 1500's from South America) and the importation of foreign eating and cooking habits, you feel selfishly grateful it came to travel the world, yet also fearful of the losses the globalization of food can bring.",2006-02-05T05:00:00+0000

At the moment, the thorniest dispute over the issue concerns a male-circumcision ritual practiced by some Hasidic Jews in New York. The ritual is called oral suction, or metzitzah b'peh. After removing the foreskin, the mohel, who conducts the circumcision, cleans the wound by sucking blood from it. According to city health officials, the ritual may have caused three infants circumcised by the same mohel in 2003 and 2004 to contract neonatal herpes (one of the infants subsequently died). New York's city health commissioner recently issued a warning about the dangers of oral suction, leading some Orthodox Jewish leaders to complain that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had reneged on promises to let religious authorities handle the issue. Meanwhile, secularists like the writer Christopher Hitchens have attacked the mayor for banning smoking in restaurants while failing to protect helpless children from diseases transmitted by ""religious fanatics.""",2006-02-05T05:00:00+0000

The book begs comparisons to Nick Hornby's $(3$)Fever Pitch$(2$) but owes its debt more than anything to maybe the greatest sports novel of all time, Frederick Exley's ""A Fan's Notes."" Blythe knows a thing or two about bitterness and longing, but tempers these twin emotions with intelligence and humor and even generosity. It goes without saying that if you hate Duke you should read this book. But if you love Duke, or you love basketball, or you just love the kind of sportswriting that comes along so rarely you can count the classics on one hand, you should read this book.

Ralph was a life long resident of NYC, born of immigrant parents, Benjamin and Sophie, in 1915. His childhood was immersed with the joys of dance, opera, the Yiddish Theater, and a precious friendship with Manny Dichter. He was blessed to find his true love, Elsie, at 16 and spent the next 73 years with her at his side through all life's joys and travails. He had a long creative career as a marketing executive holding senior positions at Bulova, Lucien Piccard, including Vice President and Secretary at Gruen. A talented tennis player since childhood, he competed in many tournaments including winning the Sears Tennis Tournament in his 70's beating competitors 30 years his junior. His love of tennis was only exceeded by his love of chocolate to which he attributed his long life. A Shakespeare enthusiast, he often quoted from his work to make points and entertain friends and family. After his retirement he volunteered at LIJ Hospital where he organized educational conferences and read to seriously ill children. He was appointed by the Governor to the Board of Visitors of Queens Children's Psychiatric Center & was its Secretary. He was a fearless fighter for children against the political powers favoring funding cuts for the disadvantaged. He sponsored dance therapy programs and donated musical equipment through the Ralph and Elsie Somerfield Arts Enrichment Fund. He attended every class conducted by the Ailey dance teachers. He enjoyed lively debates at Temple Beth-El Torah study. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Elsie. He is deeply mourned by his daughters, Barbara and Benita; his son in law, John; Joan and Bill; his cousins, Bonnie and Sven and his devoted friend, Clem.

Directed by Simon West (""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider""), the PG-13 film -- about a babysitter who receives mysterious, threatening phone calls -- set a record as the first to exceed $20 million in box office receipts over a Super Bowl weekend, according to a studio executive. (Last year during the same weekend, ""Boogeyman,"" another horror film from Screen Gems, took in $19 million.) ""Big Momma's House 2"" (Fox), last week's top film, dropped to No. 2 with $13.3 million, and ""Nanny McPhee"" (Universal), with Emma Thompson, dropped one spot to No. 3 with $9.9 million. ""Brokeback Mountain"" (Focus Features) rose two spots, to No. 4, with $5.6 million; it expanded to more than 2,000 theaters after receiving eight Oscar nominations last week, and its total gross after nine weeks now stands at nearly $60 million. ""Hoodwinked"" (Weinstein Company) held at No. 5 with $5.3 million, bringing its total to $44 million.

It is breathtaking in its comprehensiveness, which means that you will need to have some serious time on your hands, but the Bagger reads so you dont have to. Among the revelations, Jake Gyllenhaal said Brokeback Mountain wasnt really about sex between two guys  it was about love between two human beings. Who just happened to be guys  get it? Dan Futterman, the writer of Capote who warmed up by reading Janet Malcolms The Journalist and the Murderer and Gerald Clarkes exquisite biography of Capote, comes straight at the truth of the movie (and perhaps why it resonates so much with people in showbiz and media): Anybody in this kind of business  whether acting, writing, or directing  who denies that ambition, public recognition, and respect drive them is lying to themselves. The Bagger makes no such claim  still, he sees no reason to type unless his name is at the top  and wrote, way back when, about the cravenness that lies at the heart of Capote. On the acting front, one noted film observer points out that in playing Transamericas Bree, Felicity Huffman acts the bejeezus out of this. O.K., so its William H. Macy, who happens to be married to her, but the Bagger watched the movie again this weekend  nothing like a little transsexual drama to leaven Super Bowl weekend, right?  and hes right. Keira Knightly looks like an angel and swears like a sailor in describing her turn as Elizabeth in Pride & Prejudice.

us,The Rugrats Know More than We Do,"If youre looking for actual wisdom, you could do a lot worse than skipping the Baggers post on Friday and getting into the comments section, where many people who actually know what they are talking about weighed in with some rather impressive Oscar historical deconstruction. Steve4992 points out that the correlate between editing and best picture breaks down when it comes to a film actually winning best picture, and offers a nice little bit of algebra instead: DGA plus Golden Globe for best pic drama or musical/comedy plus most Oscar noms or tied for most Oscar noms equals victory, always. He concludes Brokeback Mountain is a shoe-in because it meets all these various and sundry criteria. Another rugrat, if the Bagger may be so bold, pointed out that BBMs eight nominations is a pretty small number in the context of Oscar history. In the modern era, Hugo points out, only three films, The Greatest Show on Earth, (five noms) Annie Hall (five noms), and Ordinary People (five noms), have won the big magilla after receiving fewer than seven nominations, which is a hurdle BBM got over, but not by much. The Bagger obviously needs all the help he can get and is beginning to see the comments section as a large network of serially linked computers, with a reigning deity named Zimmergirl, See for yourself. (Although one industry maven, whose predictions the Bagger has come to rely on but cant cite by name, has suggested that there is a real, actual fight for best picture between BBM and Crash, with BBM ahead by a nose for the time being.)",2006-02-06T11:51:25+0000

For example, what straight male do you know who would consider being clad head-to-toe in gold to be proper evening wear? And even though Oscar is 78 years old or so, he is incredibly buff, a tribute either to a moderate lifestyle or endless trips to the gym. Factor in the fact that Oscar spends his time adjacent to big stars, a constant familiar who is petted and stroked, and there are reasons to think that Oscar, if not an avowed homosexual, certainly has his moments, and may be more flexible than he appears to be.

""It is a very big deal, but there are a lot of other issues remaining,"" said Michael McKee, who runs a tenant political action committee. ""People are constantly saying, 'but if I take the landlord to court, I might end up on the black list.' It has had a tremendous chilling effect."" In the past, the screening agency, now known as First Advantage SafeRent, simply reported the filing of suits for eviction or nonpayment of rent and not the final disposition of cases. The draft agreement, which must be approved by a judge, requires the screening agency to update its files regularly with information on the outcome of cases, and to expunge records of suits when tenants show that the court found a case to be without merit or filed in error. A spokesman for First Advantage declined to comment on the agreement before the judge's hearing. JOSH BARBANEL (NYT)",2006-02-08T05:00:00+0000

Its just that the Bagger did not want to participate in the objectification of two of the more promising young actors of our time  hes got three daughters to think about, after all. But last night he found a much more chaste link  Reuters via Yahoo  with a postage-size picture that renders its more naughty bits in miniature. Turns out Rachel McAdams decided not to go there at the last minute and bowed out, and that the issue includes George Clooney as well, although he kept his clothes on, perhaps because he didnt want to reveal some of the stretch marks he picked up by beefing up for his role in Syriana.

us,The Sensitive-Artist Type,"The Bagger has been neglecting his bookmarks of late and they have been neglecting hm him back. One of the nicer bits he missed was the Hollywood Reporters roundtable with the writers nominated for the Writers Guild of America awards. (Crash and Brokeback Mountain won for original and scripted screenplay, respectively.) Everybody in the gang chat did their bit and played to type, with writer-director Stephen Gaghan making sure he put across the undue burden of not only writing a film, but directing it as well. Directors, he explained, are called on to make 10,000 decisions a day, any one of which could change the movie irrevocably. Thats anxiety. The writer of The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Judd Apatow, suggested they had the bong-wielding contingent of writers locked up. Its nice to know that writers still smoke reefer, he said, by way of explaining how the comedy he wrote got some play from the writers guild while it was ignored everywhere else during the award season. And Diana Ossana opened up a vein on those things that troubled her sleep: The tagline gay cowboy movie really annoyed us. Gosh, shes right  that is SO unfair. Paul Haggis, who wrote, directed, produced  and for all we know, worked in craft services on  Crash, said hes all for someone abjectly loving or loathing his film. Id much rather have that than have someone say, Nice film, man. Thats a stake through your heart. Yeah, and thats mighty ugly to contemplate as well.

Over at Fox411, Roger Friedman speculates that when the feds get to the bottom of the intrigue and double-cross, they might find someone who looks a lot like Michael Ovitz.

us,Splitsville,"The Bagger stopped by the Bruce Wasserstein/Carl Icahn investor road show at the St. Regis yesterday. Mr. Wasserstein spent 30 minutes explaining why breaking Time Warner into a million little pieces  well, at least four  makes inescapable business sense. Not your great Oscar story, but pickings are slim this time of the season, and the Bagger will do what he can with what hes got. In this instance, if the pressure from Icahn were to force a de-merger, Warner Brothers, one of Hollywoods most reliable producers of tentpoles, would end up as its own darn thing, more or less. If things go that way, Warner might think about commissioning a movie called, It Came from Another Part of the Boardroom, a thinly veiled biopic of Mr. Icahn, who managed to mangle Shakespeare and misidentify his would-be compatriot Mr. Wasserstein as Ken. Mr. Wasserstein expressed significant admiration for News Corporation and Rupert Murdoch, but the gooey feeling is far from mutual. In an interview, Mr. Murdoch pointed out that Viacom Inc., another major media conglomerate, has so far achieved little or nothing for its shareholders in deciding to break up into two entities at the beginning of this year.",2006-02-08T14:00:24+0000

A frequent motif is dinner guests pretending to listen to each other but actually just rehearsing to come up with a sassy bit to top the person sitting to their left.

Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles is captioned, ""Who is this colossal goddess?"" The question asked in a Rome courtroom yesterday was, ""Where does she come from?"" The fifth-century-B.C. statue, believed to be of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, may be the most important ancient artifact at the core of the trial of Marion True, the Getty's former curator of antiquities, who is accused of acquiring objects illegally excavated from Italian soil. The Getty bought the statue in 1988 for a reported $18 million from the London-based dealer Robin Symes. Salvatore Morando, an investigator testifying at yesterday's hearing, asserted that it came from an illegal excavation at Morgantina in central Sicily. Mr. Morando said tests on the statue and on fragments found at Morgantina indicated that ""they came from the same archaeological site."" Italian officials have asked for more tests, but Maurizio Fiorilli, a lawyer for the state, charged in court that the Getty Museum was uncooperative. Lawyers for Mrs. True countered that many experts, including Malcolm Bell, a director of the excavations at the Sicilian site, say that no proof of the statue's origins is known. Italian officials have contended since 1988 that it was illegally taken from Sicily. ELISABETTA POVOLEDO",2006-02-09T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Buttitta, who could not be reached for comment, is among dozens of evacuees living at hotels in New York City who have been denied housing extensions by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a representative of the evacuees. On Tuesday, the agency stopped issuing housing subsidies for thousands of evacuees across the country. Marc Leffman, the chief executive of the company that owns the Radisson, said yesterday that the hotel managers had locked out Mr. Buttitta because he refused to seek a FEMA extension. Mr. Leffman added that the hotel let Mr. Buttitta back into his room before the court order was received. NICHOLAS CONFESSORE (NYT)",2006-02-09T05:00:00+0000

us,"Munich, Reconsidered and Repackaged","By now, the Bagger thinks we can all agree that Munich was rolled out with all the grace and beauty of a ship that started to sink after it was christened with a bottle of champagne. Bad P.R., bad ads, and bad vibe, all rolled into one. And yet, and yet, it was nominated as one of the five best pictures of the year. So, the folks behind the film, having been granted some oxygen by the nomination, are going to give selling Steven Spielbergs movie another whack. There are new print ads that could not help but be an improvement over the original ad, left: The silhouette of a lone figure certainly brought a lot of mood to bear, a mood that suggests the guy might be about to cut his own wrists. As Rachel Abramowitz of the Los Angeles Times pointed out, marketing the movie as a SERIOUS, IMPORTANT FILM probably wounded its prospects a lot more than the ack-ack it picked up from people on either side of the Middle East debate. The new ads show some beefy, trained-to-maim dudes that would not be out of place in, ah, an action-packed thriller. The marketplace, and by proxy, Hollywood, is a place where do-overs arent usually handed out, but Munichs substantial appeal with members of the Academy  whether it is mostly homage to Mr. Spielbergs storied career or not  has given this movie another shot.",2006-02-09T14:07:46+0000

Look at the male version of the ad, which can be seen on billboards around L.A. right now. You have a suited male, face unseen, rendered in black and white. The only color in the picture comes from the golden guy himself. You dont have to squint your eyes too much to start thinking the classically attired male torso might be that of David Strathairn, George Clooney, or even Edward R. Murrow. Perhaps the Baggers blood sugar is running a bit high and muddling his thinking, but now that he has put that little thought in your head, see if you ever look at the ad the same way again.",2006-02-09T14:14:30+0000

Fer instance, a while back we did a story about the scrum over credits, and now that the ballots are shipping, its worth revisiting. On one level, the fight over who gets credit for Crash is all of the worst of Hollywood  pettiness, ego, avarice  in one untidy multi-car pileup. On another, very real issues are at stake. On one side is the Producers Guild of Anerica and, by proxy, the Academy, seeking to control credit creep, in which everybody and his brother can say they produced a film. On the other, you have people like Bob Yari and Mark Harris, two of the guys who got stiffed in the new process of determining who gets actual credit come Oscar time, wondering who appointed these guys as arbiters of all that is good and holy in the production process. As indie productions grow and become a mainstay of the both the business and the aesthetic of the industry, movies are going to continue to come together in a complicated way. Mr. Yari has already sued one of his former production partners on Crash, not just over the credit issue, but that certainly is one of the salient issues. Mr. Yari has made noises about actually going ahead and suing the Producers Guild, but that brings up a rather delicate issue. Mr. Yari continues to be financially staked in Crash, and will benefit significantly if the movie ends up sneaking in as best picture. So, with that broader objective in mind, he and anybody else involved in Crash wants to get the Academys attention. And suing the hand that feeds them, while it will accomplish that goal, will not endear the membership when Crash needs all the friends it can get.",2006-02-09T14:22:12+0000

They will make a valiant effort, churning their way through several films, but eventually, they will succumb to reality and pull the trigger in some categories they know very little about.

Shes working hard and its early, he said. Some have suggested that Ari Emmanuel of the Endeavor agency will be brought in to help run the place in Ms. Bermans stead.

us,"36 Hours in Grand Forks, N.D.","NORTH DAKOTA in the winter -- cold, you betcha. But in Grand Forks, a town of about 50,000 closer to Winnipeg than it is to Minneapolis, winter is not a forbidding season. There's plenty to do outdoors if you're up for it, but because Grand Forks is home to the University of North Dakota and its more than 13,000 students, there's a surprising number of things to do indoors as well. The people are remarkably friendly, perhaps the result of working together to hold back the Red River of the North, which last flooded in 1997 and would have destroyed the city were it not for the legions of hyperorganized volunteer sandbaggers. And while a majority of the inhabitants trace their ancestry to Norway or Germany, the Forks has grown more diverse with the increasing number of university students from overseas. Finally, consider the joke that Grand Forks played on Dave Barry when he ridiculed the city's efforts to promote tourism. Lured to the Forks by a postcard-writing campaign, he was the guest of honor at an official ceremony in 2002-- in which a municipal sewage pump station was named after him.

us,The Listings: Feb. 10 - Feb. 16; 'PITTSBURGH: FROM THE HEART OF STEELTOWN',"It's a happy accident that this Jazz at Lincoln Center minifestival arrives in the lingering afterglow of Super Bowl XL, which yielded the first Pittsburgh Steelers championship since their glory days a quarter-century ago. ""Pittsburgh: From the Heart of Steeltown"" is the latest in a series of concert events celebrating the jazz legacy of American cities, by way of Wynton Marsalis, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra and a handful of special guests. It's a simple and effective premise for the kind of repertory work that the Lincoln Center orchestra does best; performing at the Rose Theater, it will tackle crisp, serious arrangements united by theme rather than style. The evening's Pittsburgh-reared guest stars will be Steve Nelson, a patiently exploratory vibraphonist, and Jeff Watts, known as Tain, a brilliantly locomotive drummer. Some of the Steel City's more famous jazz heroes, like the pianist Earl Hines, nicknamed Fatha, and the composer and pianist Billy Strayhorn, will be represented in the program's repertory. (The absence of living legends like the guitarist George Benson and the pianist Ahmad Jamal is a shortcoming that Mr. Marsalis, in his capacity as M.C., should manage to overcome.) A smaller and more single-minded tribute, in memory of another Pittsburgh native, the tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine (above), who died in 2000, will run simultaneously in the Allen Room. Eric Alexander and Robert Stewart will handle tenor saxophone duties, and the rhythm section will consist of Gene Ludwig on Hammond B3 organ, Dave Stryker on guitar and Grady Tate on drums. Appropriately, the music will recall a time just before the Steelers reigned supreme. (Thursday through Feb. 18 at 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, www.jalc.org; $30 to $130.)",2006-02-10T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Fallen Idol',"Graham Greene liked to say that he preferred ""The Fallen Idol"" (1948) to the more famous ""The Third Man"" (1949) because it was more a writer's film than a director's. It's hard not to wonder if he actually favored ""The Fallen Idol,"" which he adapted from his story ""The Basement Room"" and was, like ""The Third Man,"" directed by Carol Reed, because Orson Welles wasn't on hand, grabbing the spotlight. Whatever the case, while Greene is probably in a minority in preferring ""The Fallen Idol,"" this eccentric curio certainly has its appeal. The streamlined plot involves a young boy, his family's butler and the butler's secrets, and follows the original story in outline, deviating in detail (the boy in the film has a pet snake), if not dark tone. Ralph Richardson plays Baines, a butler for an embassy family in London who works alongside his wife (the ferocious Sonia Dresdel), but loves another (Michle Morgan). The film opens just as the ambassador departs on a short trip, leaving his only son, Phillipe (Bobby Henrey, above), alone with the Baineses and their violently unhappy marriage. Beautifully shot by the French cinematographer Georges Prinal (whose credits include Cocteau's ""Blood of a Poet""), the film soon evolves from a claustrophobic domestic affair into a mordantly discomfiting look at the betrayal of innocence. In his story, Greene writes that the boy ""didn't understand a thing; he was caught up in other people's darkness."" Reed captures both the writer's intentions and the child's panicked isolation in a scene that finds Phillipe fleeing through city streets as steeped in shadow and dread as those in the noirs of Anthony Mann. As the film's putatively happy (and strange) windup makes it clear, when childhood ends, there really is no place left to run. (""The Fallen Idol"" runs today through Feb. 23 at Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110.)",2006-02-10T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: Feb. 10 - Feb. 16; 'FRIANDISES',"Choreographers are often drawn to the same pieces of music -- the Bach solo cello suites and Stravinsky's ""Sacre du Printemps"" are just two examples among many -- but it's hard to think of a musical commission that has been specifically made to be used by more than one choreographer. That's the case with a new composition, ""Friandises,"" (French for sweets) by Christopher Rouse, commissioned by the Juilliard School and the New York City Ballet, which will perform Peter Martins's ballet -- named after the score -- for the first time tonight. (Adam Houghland's ""Watershed,"" to the same score, will be performed by the Juilliard Dance Ensemble, beginning on Feb. 22.) ""I think it was cheaper for everyone that way,"" said Mr. Rouse (above right, with Mr. Martins), an acclaimed composer who also teaches at Juilliard. Mr. Rouse had long wanted to write a piece of music specifically for dance, after seeing a number of his works used by choreographers. He knew Mr. Martins, who had made a powerful duo, ""The Infernal Machine,"" to his score of the same title, in 2002, and they began to talk about the possibility just as Juilliard raised the idea of a commission for its centenary celebration. ""We agreed that it would be interesting to have a co-commission,"" Mr. Martins said. ""Although quite frankly, I wasn't thrilled at the idea of having Adam and myself doing pieces at the same time, because it makes it competitive. But then I decided not to worry about it."" Although Mr. Rouse has subsequently seen rehearsals, he had little contact with the choreographers while creating the score; he simply told them that it would contain five movements of around five minutes each. City Ballet's musical director, Andrea Quinn, is conducting both the City Ballet and Juilliard performances, and Mr. Rouse is leaving issues of tempo up to her. ""I'm staying out of it,"" he said. ""I did my thing, and now they will do theirs.""

She attended City and Country School and Washington Irving High School and graduated from Bennington College. After college she worked as a commercial sculptor and was actively involved in real estate and local politics. She later worked for the Manhattan office of the Board of Elections.

""American Idol,"" which delivered an estimated 28.29 million viewers, fueled Fox's victory. During the 8 p.m. time period, ""Idol"" beat the Grammys' first hour by more than 13 million viewers. And at 9 p.m., the awards ceremony was challenged by ABC's ""Lost"" (18.78 million). The island mystery featured a power play by Sawyer (Josh Holloway), who turned the testosterone tables on Jack (Matthew Fox) and Locke (Terry O'Quinn).

But in Grand Forks, a town of about 50,000 closer to Winnipeg than it is to Minneapolis, winter is not a forbidding season. There's plenty to do outdoors if you're up for it, but because Grand Forks is home to the University of North Dakota and its more than 13,000 students, there's a surprising number of things to do indoors as well. The people are remarkably friendly, perhaps the result of working together to hold back the Red River of the North, which last flooded in 1997 and would have destroyed the city were it not for the legions of hyperorganized volunteer sandbaggers. And while a majority of the inhabitants trace their ancestry to Norway or Germany, the Forks has grown more diverse with the increasing number of university students from overseas. Finally, consider the joke that Grand Forks played on Dave Barry when he ridiculed the city's efforts to promote tourism. Lured to the Forks by a postcard-writing campaign, he was the guest of honor at an official ceremony in 2002 in which a municipal sewage pump station was named after him.

It is also worth noting that contests may be trumping awards in the minds of the American viewer. When a game show full of no-name performers (American Idol) doubles up the audience on the recording industrys night of stars, glamour and hardware, the Bagger has to wonder if people are just plain turned off by the routine. Maybe its good that the Academy is switching it up this year because the same old, same old does not appear to be cutting it. And as the night wore on, the Grammys offered an object lesson in the illusion of momentum, something that is breathlessly invoked come Oscar time. Early in the night, it was all Mariah and Mimi, making it appear as if the divas comeback would include a sweep of the Grammys. But by the end of the night, the smoke had cleared and it was U2 hauling away the most hardware.

The Bush administrations rationale for war, Pillar writes, was based not on weapons of mass destruction but by the desire to shake up the sclerotic power structures of the Middle East and hasten the spread of more liberal politics and economics in the region. Therefore, focusing on the intelligence communitys mistaken belief that Saddam Hussein possessed W.M.D. misses the point, because the intelligence of Iraqi weapons programs did not drive [the administrations] decision to go to war.

us,BUSINESS BRIEFS,"Visteon Posts a Fourth-Quarter Profit, Helped by the Sale of Assets to Ford The auto parts maker Visteon Corporation posted a quarterly net profit yesterday after recognizing a gain of $1.83 billion on the sale of plants and other facilities to its former parent, the Ford Motor Company. Visteon reported net income of $1.34 billion, or $10.25 a share, for the fourth quarter, in contrast to a net loss of $138 million, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier. Fourth-quarter sales fell to $2.87 billion, from $4.68 billion a year earlier, mainly because of the sale of operations to Ford. Excluding the gain and other one-time items, Visteon reported a loss of $102 million in the quarter. The deal with Ford helped Visteon avoid falling into bankruptcy. Production cuts and price reductions in North America hurt quarterly results for Visteon, which was spun off by Ford in 2000. The Ford bailout is partly financing Visteon's latest three-year restructuring plan. Visteon expects the plan to cost about $650 million, down from its previous estimate of $800 million, the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday. Visteon also raised its 2006 outlook and said it expected the improvement to continue in 2007. (REUTERS)",2006-02-11T05:00:00+0000

In E. B. Lewis's exuberant watercolors, shop scenes in shades of brown are juxtaposed with the wild, blue-toned dance floor, where dresses and suits swirl and blur. An author's note explains that the Savoy -- which closed in 1958 -- was among the first integrated ballrooms, and brief biographies shed light on famous Lindy Hoppers mentioned in the story, like ""Long-Legged George"" Grenidge, known for the Long-Legged Charleston, and six-foot-tall Big Bea, who liked to flip her partner, Shorty George.

What the senator said in public was milder than what he said in private conversations with foreign-policy gurus like Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser in another Bush administration, or his friend Colin Powell, the secretary of state, who thought he still had a chance to steer the administration on a diplomatic course. The Nebraskan wanted to believe Powell but, deep down, felt the White House wasn't going to be diverted from its drive to topple Saddam Hussein. When he rose on the Senate floor that October to explain his vote in favor of the resolution authorizing force -- he'd persuaded himself that his vote might strengthen Powell's hand -- he gave a speech that would have required no editing had he decided to vote against it. What sounded then to the venture's true believers like the scolding of a Cassandra sounds fairly obvious three and a half years later, which is to say that Hagel's words can reasonably be read as prescient: ""How many of us really know and understand Iraq, its country, history, people and role in the Arab world?. . .The American people must be told of the long-term commitment, risk and cost of this undertaking. We should not be seduced by the expectations of dancing in the streets."" The president had said ""precious little"" about post-Saddam Iraq, which could prove costly, Hagel warned, ""in both American blood and treasure.""",2006-02-12T05:00:00+0000

Fruit trees were induced to bloom earlier or later, their fruit sweeter or different in size, smell, and shape from the typical. In the island's parks and enclosed pastures, all sorts of beasts and birds resided for purposes more experimental than ornamental: ""We make them greater or taller than their kind,"" stated the great ""Father"" scientist in charge. ""We find means to make commixtures and copulations of different kinds; which have produced many new kinds."" Yet despite the marvelous specificity of his vision, Bacon did not offer a date for the actual start of these transformative practices. For when The New Atlantis was published in 1627, a year after Bacon's death, making one plant or animal turn into another was still the stuff of imaginary islands and magically endowed inhabitants.

Last year, mink production was close to 1980's peak levels again.

Much of ""The Inheritance of Loss"" takes place in a town near Mount Kanchenjunga that Mishra recognized from his own travels. But Desai's Kalimpong is ""much bigger and more diverse"" than the village of Mashobra, where Mishra first settled in 1992 and where he has returned every year for long spells of reading and writing and, he confessed, ""worrying about writing."" In Mashobra, he began the work of memoir, history and philosophy that would become ""An End to Suffering: The Buddha in the World"" (2004) and worked on his novel, ""The Romantics"" (2000), about a young Indian's encounters with Westerners studying his country's ancient culture. His next book will be ""Temptations of the West: How to Be Modern in India, Pakistan, Tibet, and Beyond."" As for the complex view of modernity in Desai's novel, Mishra drew a comparison with the film ""Syriana,"" since both works, although very different, vividly depict what he called ""the multilayered interdependent world we live in,"" a place ""where individual lives very far apart in space and time impact upon one another,"" sometimes with tragic results.",2006-02-12T05:00:00+0000

Adored ""Pop"" to grandchildren Hilary, Matthew, Gwen, Keshia and Jonathan. Sadly missed by Millie. Jim was born in Montreal on March 17, 1935 but grew up in New Rochelle, New York where his father Alex was Administrator of New Rochelle Hospital. A 1957 graduate of Williams College, Jim returned to Canada where he was an economist with the Government of Canada, an International Representative for the United Steelworkers and Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics at Brock University. Following his election to North York Council and the Metropolitan Toronto Council, Jim embarked on a consulting career that bridged both sides of the border and spanned over thirty years. A specialist in the field of managed healthcare, Jim left his mark on the industry and those within it, as both a visionary and a friend. Upon retirement, Jim established his own consulting company, aptly titled, Kris Kringle. As candidate, active campaigner and vigilant supporter of The New Democratic Party Jim remained a life-long crusader for social Justice. A rare mix of success and generosity, Jim regularly volunteered at the ""Out of the Cold"" soup kitchen. Jim Norton was many things to many people: a husband, a father, a grandfather, a teacher, a colleague and a friend.

What the senator said in public was milder than what he said in private conversations with foreign-policy gurus like Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser in another Bush administration, or his friend Colin Powell, the secretary of state, who thought he still had a chance to steer the administration on a diplomatic course. The Nebraskan wanted to believe Powell but, deep down, felt the White House wasn't going to be diverted from its drive to topple Saddam Hussein. When he rose on the Senate floor that October to explain his vote in favor of the resolution authorizing force  he'd persuaded himself that his vote might strengthen Powell's hand  he gave a speech that would have required no editing had he decided to vote against it. What sounded then to the venture's true believers like the scolding of a Cassandra sounds fairly obvious three and a half years later, which is to say that Hagel's words can reasonably be read as prescient: ""How many of us really know and understand Iraq, its country, history, people and role in the Arab world?. . .The American people must be told of the long-term commitment, risk and cost of this undertaking. We should not be seduced by the expectations of dancing in the streets.""

The Buccaneers scored in the final minute and needed only to kick the extra point to tie the game and send it into overtime. But when an offside penalty negated a block kick and nudged his team to the 1-yard line from the 2, head coach Jon Gruden went for the 2-point conversion, a rare move under normal circumstances and almost unheard of late in a game. (Only once before had a N.F.L. game been won by a last-minute 2-point conversion.) Gruden's decision was successful - his team won, 36-35 - and significant for both teams. It kept the Bucs in playoff contention and sent the ""Skins into a tailspin: they lost two more games and had to win their last five to make the playoffs (where they exacted revenge on the Bucs in the first round).

Normally, horseshoe crabs are used for bait or fertilizer and are found primarily along the Delaware Bay and the southern New Jersey shore. The ruling by the D.E.P. allows for horseshoe crabs to be captured for medical uses. Some researchers think that horseshoe crab blood helps keep vaccines and other drugs free of contamination.

John Horn writes that last Thursday, the Academy rejected an appeal by Mr. Yari, who had claimed that he was unfairly denied credit for his role in making the film. The Academy was following recommendations of the Producers Guild, which has sought to reduce the number of listed producers on various projects. The guild believes that handing out production credits as deal points devalues the contributions of people who actually did the work. Mr. Yari and Mark Harris, who was also denied a credit, believe the Producers Guild has little knowledge of how independent movies actually come together in the modern era of film-making. All of the fuss is an attempt to avoid the kind of traffic jam that occurred when Shakespeare in Love won at the 1999 ceremony, with a total of five producers heading up to the stage to make a grab for the Oscar and the limelight. Mr. Horn points out that Crash was not the only movie in which credits were an issue; under the Producers Guilds more vigorously enforced standards, Colin Wilson was cut as a producer for Munich.

The airport had some of the highest average fares in the nation before Independence Air began operating there in 2004, forcing competitors to lower ticket prices. Over all, fares have not gone up much since Independence Air closed on Jan. 5, industry analysts say. But on flights in which passengers depart and return on the same day, once a staple of Independence Air's short-haul network, ticket prices have risen significantly, said Terry Trippler, the airfare analyst at Cheapseats.com. When Independence Air folded, he found, the round-trip fare for same-day flights between Dulles and Buffalo on United Airlines was $158. A month later, it had risen to $618.

The agreement came in a settlement of a federal lawsuit by the city against CSX. The 60-car train derailed in a tunnel in July 2001, igniting a chemical fire that burned for days. It forced businesses to close, put downtown traffic in gridlock, delayed East Coast freight shipments and canceled Orioles baseball games. The city and CSX also agreed to improve communications about rail shipments and to ask the federal and state authorities to inspect the tunnel. The settlement blames neither the city nor CSX for the accident. GARY GATELY (NYT)",2006-02-14T05:00:00+0000

Iraq's move is certain to please American wheat farmers. U.S. Wheat Associates, a trade association representing American wheat growers, had urged the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq to take similar action after Mr. Hussein was toppled in 2003, and has led an effort to have AWB investigated.

Under the plan, energy exports would be blocked, energy imports would be stepped up and gas supplies could be cut off to some major customers, he said.

It could be that Universal is just doing what it should for a film it backed, but there may be a subplot. Focus Features, which has the prohibitive favorite in Brokeback Mountain, is a division of Universal, so it would seem odd for a company to spend money competing with itself. But perhaps studio execs are unimpressed by Brokebacks homestretch and want to hedge a bit. And they may be miffed that so many specialty divisions and indies are ruling what has been a historically a big party of the big guys.

Mr. Tsvangirai had argued that the election was flawed by vote fraud and intimidation, a judgment shared by many outside election monitors at the time. The court's five-judge panel said in a 20-page opinion that the charge was without merit. Mr. Tsvangirai's party, Movement for Democratic Change, has since been riven by internal bickering; its two factions will hold separate conventions in a few weeks to elect new leaders. Mr. Mugabe, who turns 82 this month and has ruled Zimbabwe for 25 years, recently said he might run for president again if his country needed him. MICHAEL WINES (NYT)",2006-02-15T05:00:00+0000

The so-called Oscar bump can be good for $5 million or $10 million, or even more, a windfall of cash at the box office that rewards those who made good films and ran good campaigns behind them. But the Bagger has been spending some quality time on Box Office Mojo and, more worrisome, with his own calculator. And what hes found is that this year, there will be no Oscar bump  far from it. The tale of the box office tape suggests that the Oscar sparkle will do little for the long-term business outlook of this years best picture nominees. True enough, the four still in theatrical release  Brokeback Mountain, Munich, Good Night, and Good Luck, and Capote  got a bit of a push the week after nominations were announced. They went from a collective weekend gross of $8.9 million before the announcements to $11.5 million the weekend after. But then they went right off the cliff. Last weekend, the carnage was everywhere. The four films (Crash came out earlier in the year and is only on DVD) were down a collective 43.4 percent from the previous weekend and took in just about $6.9 million. In other words, they were worse off than before the Oscars. Brokeback is still in almost 2,000 theaters and took in a robust $4 million, but Munich lost 600 screens, better than half its theaters, and took in a miserable $783,510. Given the level of heat and promotion behind the movie, it is clear that not many besides Academy members are taking Steven Spielberg up on his suggestion that people ignore the partisans and see the movie for themselves. Capote, which recently crept over the $20 million mark, took in $1.27 million while Good Night, and Good Luck, did $872,000.

Gross domestic product expanded 2.7 percent in the quarter from a year ago after growing a revised 3.4 percent in the third quarter, the government said. For the full year, Mexico expanded 3 percent, down from a revised growth rate of 4.2 percent in 2004. ""The economy is just kind of treading water,"" said Neil Dougall, chief of emerging markets research for Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London. Sluggish growth among manufacturers that sell primarily in the domestic market suggests that consumption has yet to pick up after six interest-rate cuts by the central bank, Mr. Dougall said. That will most likely prompt central bankers to keep cutting the benchmark lending rate, bringing it down to 7 percent by year-end from a 15-month low of 7.75 percent now, he said. The Finance Ministry forecasts growth will quicken to 3.6 percent this year as the interest-rate reductions bolster demand.",2006-02-16T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: Feb. 17 - Feb. 23; JOE BRADLEY: 'KURGAN WAVES',"In art, pretending to be dumber, more juvenile or less rational than you are usually serves an advanced sophistication. It certainly does in the surprisingly sweet and mysteriously resonant exhibition by Joe Bradley, a young New York-based painter having his third solo show. Mr. Bradley's multipanel paintings consist of flimsy, store-bought canvases brusquely painted single colors and arranged to create the much simplified images of armless, big-shouldered figures resembling primitive video game characters. Standing almost nine feet, with their legs abutting the floor, these ""big blocky guys,"" as the sculptor Dike Blair calls them in an essay written for the exhibition, seem to have gathered for some kind of tribal ceremony. A sky-blue canvas called ""Mirror,"" lying on the stone floor in the center of the gallery, glows like a reflecting pool; a large, squarish canvas on the wall, painted all brown, evokes the earth (above from left ""Trans,"" ""Mirror"" and ""Machine Hash""). (That Kurgan is the name of an evil, immortal warrior in the cult movie ""Highlander"" may or may not be relevant.) To use a Minimalist vocabulary for such unabashedly anthropomorphic purposes is somehow comical. Joel Shapiro's blocky, puppetlike figures are similarly funny. Mr. Bradley's show might be a joke about what the critic Michael Fried saw as the essentially theatrical nature of Minimalist art. But it also vividly demonstrates how we may experience even the most abstract artworks as animated by life-like or supernatural energies. We may not be as sophisticated as we think.

us,The Listings: Feb. 17 - Feb. 23; GARY WILMES,"Ever since he croaked out an indie-rock song in the middle of Richard Maxwell's deadpan epic ""House"" in 1998, Gary Wilmes has been cursed with the label of avant-garde star -- which is a little like being called a tall midget. The lanky Mr. Wilmes has stolen scenes in a handful of plays by Mr. Maxwell, with whom he went to high school, and was also hailed by critics for his twitchy turn as the title character in Richard Foreman's ""Bad Boy Nietzsche."" His forays into more traditional theater, like his cameo role in ""More Lies About Jerzy"" at the Vineyard Theater, were mostly ignored. But that's not the case with his devilish performance as a self-absorbed and cruel Manhattan editor in Adam Rapp's ""Red Light Winter,"" an involving play that nicely captures the casually misogynistic banter of overeducated postgraduate dudes. Mr. Wilmes (above, with Lisa Joyce), an athletic presence whose jangly limbs seem to follow the rest of his body across the stage, looks a little old for the part, but his laid-back adolescent arrogance is just right. And while this turn is in a realistic style, look closely enough and you'll notice something oddly unpredictable and ominous about his line readings. He pauses for longer than you expect, and when he cracks a mean joke, he never cracks a smile, as if he's still performing the distinctively flat dialogue of Mr. Maxwell. Mr. Wilmes may have crossed over to more conventional theater, but he has smuggled a bit of the avant-garde with him.

us,'Worldy Desires',"The young Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul knows better than most one of the trickiest parts of his art: how much to impose his imaginative design on the world, and when to let life flow, raw and unmediated, full of all its quirks and longueurs, into his camera. His sly feature debut, ""Mysterious Object at Noon"" (2001), was a documentary about rural Thailand that played like a surrealist folktale. ""Blissfully Yours"" (2002) led a group of nonprofessionals into the jungle for an avant-garde picnic, fixing naturalistic actions into highly self-conscious structures. His deliriously inventive ""Tropical Malady"" (2005) developed this hybrid instinct to such a degree that it spoke with equal authority on the textures of everyday life in Thailand and the desires of a lovesick, shape-shifting tiger shaman. Each of Mr. Weerasethakul's films is an exploration of storytelling, a (head) trip into uncharted narrative terrain. His latest work, the digital short ""Worldly Desires"" (above), is the most meta of his movies, and perhaps the most enigmatic. The story is once again set in a Thai jungle thick with vegetation and metamorphic energies -- but precisely what sort of story is as ambiguous as ever. There is a film shoot in progress, and the staging of a peppy musical number, but the camera keeps wandering off to stare at the trees or look at a stray dog or linger near some casual talk.(""The only foreigner I like is Keanu."") Is this an experimental documentary on the making of Mr. Weerasethakul's new feature? Or has the whole crazy, unclassifiable thing -- imagine a cross between ""Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take 1"" and a painting by Henri Rousseau -- been invented from scratch? ""Worldly Desires"" is another mysterious object, blissfully ours.

The Bagger noticed a trussed-up Peter Sarsgaard, a VERY relaxed Sienna Miller, the ever-freakish old soul/new kid on the block Dakota Fanning, and lots of nekkid people. The Bagger is the kind of guy who showers with his shirt on, so he admires the courage of people who are willing to do all sorts of sharing with their public. But the most impressive picture for the Bagger was one entitled The Warriors. The image is not available online, so the Bagger, through precision use of his craft and well-chosen words, will do his best. There is a picture of Harvey Weinstein. Harvey looks good. Its not the fake Harvey, the jolly smile that he gets just before he is about to devour your soul. This was Harvey looking tough, smart, and yes, down to his fighting weight. Harvey was flanked by a very debonair businessman, a handsome guy whose face was writ with intelligence, a kind of executive warmth, and quiet resolve. The Bagger stared and stared at the picture and then finally looked at the caption. The guy in the jillion dollar suit next to Harvey was  his brother Bob. The Bagger does not know Bob well, but he has been in a few meetings with him. And Bob, surely a man who knows his way around his business and genre films in particular, is no threat to serve as the rack for the next fashion shoot in Esquire. Man, the Bagger knows Vanity Fair makes people look better than they are in real life and all, but the other brother looked amazing. The Bagger, who specializes in rumpled suits and untucked shirts, is a doughy white guy who covets the new Bob Weinstein look. He would do anything to look like that.

The St. Mary County Democrat ,who represents Calvert, Charles and St. Mary counties, said he introduced the bill after talking with representatives of the U.S. Navy. It seems the Navy was getting a lot of calls about noise from homeowners on Marylands Eastern Shore where the Patuxent River Naval Air Station is located.

Their elegant figures are shored up by trusses or corsets-synthetic exoskeletons fortified with whalebone. If any members of this audience make a connection between their own underclothes and the presence onstage of a child from the Arctic whaling grounds, they don't let on. They are effusive in their praise of the little Esquimau. She is clearly a prodigy. She is only ten years of age! She has been playing the piano for only three years! How charming she looks in her cream cotton dress with the puffed sleeves, the ends of her braids joined at the small of her back with a red ribbon bow. As they whisper and nod, a lush welling of self-appreciation and security warms their chests. ",2006-02-19T05:00:00+0000

Wire services may have trained one generation of journalists -- the foreign correspondent Ryszard Kapuscinski among them -- to write tersely. But a younger generation of journalists learned the art of brevity by toiling away in the trenches of magazine margins. Cases in point: Kamp, a contributor to Vanity Fair and GQ, and Levi, who is on the staff of the editorial page at The New York Times, both once worked at Spy and, over the years, have burnished the 28-word-and-under profile to a sheen. (Kamp was also a co-author of ""The Rock Snob's Dictionary."") In a guide to cinematic terms, actors and more, here's how they describe Robert Evans's life in the 1980's: ""a cocaine bust, a link to a murder case, a spotty record as an independent producer, an ever more frightening array of tinted eyeglasses."" On Peter Greenaway: ""Arguably the perviest of the Brit-perv director set that includes Nicolas Roeg, Ken Russell and Derek Jarman."" And the critic Stanley Kauffmann: ""An unblurbable iconoclast in a Peter Travers age, Kauffmann perseveres in a time-warped intellectualist cocoon, conveying carnal excitement only when his crush, Emma Thompson, appears in a film."" Aside from skewering various indie heroes, Kamp and Levi define genres frequently cited by film snobs, like ""chop-socky"" (""identified with the latter-day Hong Kong film industry that begat Jackie Chan, Chow Yun-Fat and John Woo""), ""grindhouse"" (as in, for example, ""I Dismember Mama"") and ""W.I.P.""

PETER WATKINS's 1976 masterpiece ""EDVARD MUNCH"" may not be the greatest of all biopics -- although a strong case can be made -- but it surely ranks with the most innovative and lucid. Here is a true life and times, both scholarly and poetic, in which the painter's everyday travails are fused with incisive cultural analysis. Mr. Watkins was way ahead of the curve in his blurring of documentary and fiction, scoring his material with an art-historical voice-over while a nonprofessional cast (headed by GEIR WESTBY in the title role) pantomime in period costumes on historically accurate sets. They have been instructed to stare into the camera in nearly every scene, obliterating the fourth wall in extended homage to Munch's ""Death in the Sickroom.""

But what's surprising about the show is the creative range of the works, which were produced between 1916 and 1924: from HANNAH HCH's wonderfully bizarre photomontages to the more politically edgy work of JOHN HEARTFIELD. The show traces the wanderings of Dada's principal actors from Zurich to Cologne, Hanover, Berlin, Paris and New York, and in the process reveals a movement that is as fresh -- and relevant -- today as it was in a Europe edging toward World War II.

us,Great Performers,"Around this time of year, acting in movies starts to feel like a kind of athletic event, with prizes awarded to the winners while the losers are reduced to being glamorous extras on televised award show after televised award show. By the time of the Academy Awards, which this year will take place on March 5, the spirit of the contest seems to take precedence over artistic achievement. This year, as in the previous two, The New York Times Magazine has tried to eschew this notion of competition by saluting the performances that moved, surprised and thrilled us, regardless of whether they were nominated for awards. Some -- like Reese Witherspoon's in ""Walk the Line"" -- have been acknowledged by Oscar, while others -- like Penlope Cruz's in the Italian film ""Don't Move"" -- were barely seen in America. And while it's very likely that you've caught Heath Ledger's heartbreaking turn in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" you may have easily missed the explosive German film ""Head-On,"" which starred Sibel Kekilli and Birol nel. In 2005, George Clooney may have had the most diverse year in film: he packed on weight to play a wary, melancholic C.I.A. agent in the largely overlooked ""Syriana"" and then masterminded and starred in ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" the story of Edward R. Murrow's clash with Senator Joseph McCarthy. Performances as enthralling and complex as those by (the nominated) Philip Seymour Hoffman in ""Capote"" or (the unnominated) Jeff Daniels in ""The Squid and the Whale"" should not be overshadowed by the suspense of who will and who won't receive a statuette. Once again, the photography team of Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin has beautifully composed and captured the variety of characters who resonated with us this year and distilled the essence of what makes great movie acting great.",2006-02-19T05:00:00+0000

There could be no dispute that Vanderbilt gold was a powerful chemical element at work in St Thomas Church on 6 November 1895. It had given the bride her singular aura; it had drawn a duke from England; and without it, Alva would not now be waiting anxiously for her daughter to arrive. Scintillae of Vanderbilt gold dust brushed everything on the morning of Consuelo's wedding, from the fronds of asparagus fern to the glinting lorgnettes in the crowd outside. It was remarkable, therefore, that apart from the father-of-the bride, its chief purveyors should be so conspicuously absent; and even more striking that this scarcely mattered because of the force of character of the bride's Vanderbilt great-grandfather, whose ancestral shade still hovered over the players in the morning's drama as if he were alive.

us,'A Plea for Eros'," My father once asked me if I knew where yonder was. I said I thought yonder was another word for there. He smiled and said, ""No, yonder is between here and there."" This little story has stayed with me for years as an example of linguistic magic: It identified a new space-a middle region that was neither here nor there-a place that simply didn't exist for me until it was given a name. During my father's brief explanation of the meaning of yonder, and every time I've thought of it since, a landscape appears in my mind: I am standing at the crest of a small hill looking down into an open valley where there is a single tree, and beyond it lies the horizon defined by a series of low mountains or hills. This dull but serviceable image returns when I think of yonder, one of those wonderful words I later discovered linguists call ""shifters""-words distinct from others because they are animated by the speaker and move accordingly. In linguistic terms this means that you can never really find yourself yonder. Once you arrive at yonder tree, it becomes here and recedes forever into that imaginary horizon. Words that wobble attract me. The fact that here and there slide and slip depending on where I am is somehow poignant, revealing both the tenuous relation between words and things and the miraculous flexibility of language.

The United States still has a chance of creating a Shiite-dominated democratic Iraq, but the new government will be very weak for years to come; the resulting power vacuum will invite outside influence from all of Iraq's neighbors, including Iran. There are clear benefits to the Iraqi people from the removal of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship, and perhaps some positive spillover effects in Lebanon and Syria.

About 600,000 state residents have been enrolled in the program, and it is estimated that half live in New York City. Mr. Stringer said 311 should help older residents appeal denials of drug requests and inform them about subsidies to pay out-of-pocket costs. Several social service groups, including the Community Service Society of New York and the Medicare Rights Center, support the proposal. Stu Loeser, a spokesman for the mayor, said 311 callers are referred to a federal hot line, 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), and to 40 walk-in centers run by the city's Department for the Aging.

And when ""Grey's Anatomy"" took over on ABC at 10, that hospital soap opera became the night's most-watched program, with 24.35 million viewers (versus 18.58 million for the Olympics).

The film was inspired by a Japanese expedition in 1957 in which a severe storm forced the men to leave their dogs for six months, and all but two of the animals perished. (The film, which follows the dogs as they fend for themselves, has a happier ending.) ""Date Movie"" (Fox), a spoof of romantic comedies like ""Hitch"" and ""Meet the Parents,"" opened at No. 2 with $22.3 million from Friday through Monday, followed closely by last weekend's top film, ""The Pink Panther"" (Sony), which took in $21 million for a two-week gross of $46.6 million. ""Curious George"" (Universal) dropped one spot, to No. 4, with $15.3 million in four-day ticket sales, and the thriller ""Final Destination 3"" (New Line), also in its second week, rounded out the Top 5 with $12.5 million.

It is with deep regret and sadness that the family of the legendary Ray Barretto announces that the acclaimed Conga Maestro died Friday, February 17, 2006. Mr. Barretto died at the Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, NJ at 5 AM EST. His family was at his bedside. A leading force in both the Salsa and Latin Jazz worlds, Ray was one of the most prolific, influential and recorded Latin percussionists in the history of jazz and a pioneer in the world of salsa. His salsa aficionados and fans are represented throughout the world. The man popularly known as ""Hard Hands"" (Manos Duras) was raised in East Harlem and the Bronx, but was enthralled by the big band sounds of Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey. During his military tour through Europe, the musical influence of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie claimed his attention at a GI jazz club. His world and his eventual global impact were never quite the same again. Just this past January, he received a most prestigious award from the National Endowment for the Arts for his legendary contributions to jazz. This is the highest honor that our nation bestows upon jazz musicians in recognition that this magnificent art form, so profoundly based in American culture, is one of America's greatest gifts to the world. Mr. Barretto is survived by his wife, Annette, their son, Chris (age 20), and Raun, Ray and Kelly from a former marriage. A public viewing will be held Wednesday, February 22nd, from 11 AM to 5 PM, 6 PM to 10 PM, at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave.",2006-02-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Achievement Squared,"Last summer, the Bagger had a chance to sit on a golf cart with Robert Altman talking about film. The Bagger had the common sense to do a lot of listening, but it was a gas to watch Mr. Altman shoot A Prairie Home Companion, with director Paul Thomas Anderson, of all people, hanging in the wings. Terrence Rafferty performs a whopper of a retrospective in a little local daily that shows that Mr. Altman has not lost the vinegar that made him such a tangy delight for decades of filmgoers. Now the Academy, which has always managed to step past Mr. Altmans work briskly, is pausing to acknowledge a lifetime of work. With his son manning the camera at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul to film Garrison Keillors script, Mr. Altman did not mess around. As soon as a shot was set up, he would yell, Lets boogie! and the camera would roll. Mr. Altman, who is hardly hypnotized by the commercial prospects of his films, told the Bagger he thought Prairie Home might find an audience. Garrisons audience is like the Mel Gibson Jesus audience, he said. This movie is going to play for two weeks in places like Chicken Switch, Arizona, because the program has such strong rural appeal. The Bagger has spent a lot of time, metaphorically speaking, in Chicken Switch, and there isnt a lot of competition there for the disposable entertainment dollar. But then there probably isnt a movie theater either.",2006-02-21T11:28:40+0000

To not talk about Brokeback Mountain at the Oscars would be like going to the White House correspondents dinner and not talking about the president, Ben Karlin tells Jacques Steinberg.

us,Mid-Atlantic Awards,"The British Academy of Film and Television Arts swooned and swooned hard for Brokeback, loading up its bulging saddlebags with the picture, director and screenplay awards, plus an acting kudo. Jake Gyllenhaal, who through a fluke of marketing and contest machinations has been something of a forgotten man this awards season  the Bagger thinks he should get some kind of recognition for his Santa hat dance in Jarhead  acted genuinely surprised when the supporting actor award came his way. The best supporting award on the distaff side went to Thandie Newtown for her role in Crash  she may have been born in Zambia, but the British claim her as their own. Reese Witherspoon won best actress in a walk, but then, Felicity Huffman was not even up in that category. It will be fascinating to see whether Ms. Witherspoons demure approach to Oscar campaigning  she isnt doing it  will trump Ms. Huffmans willingness to show up just about anywhere there is a podium. The Bagger is not suggesting that there is something craven in Ms. Huffmans approach; it looks less like she wants it than that she is going to enjoy every single minute of her day in the sun. And the Academy could do worse than having a 43-year-old actress at the microphone who counted a good audition as one in which her bicycle was not stolen while she was taking her turn. Awards for screenplay, adapted and original, went to Brokeback and Crash respectively and it would be hard to envision BAFTAs American analogs doing it any differently. ",2006-02-21T12:00:16+0000

But thats changing. The Bagger listened to an animated discussion between Brokeback Mountain vs. Crash loyalists, and managed, with a tremendous amount of personal effort, to keep his piehole shut: Nothing can bring a nice party chat to a screeching halt more quickly than some dweeby know-it-all who has been sitting in his basement checking Oscar-related bookmarks for two months now. But now that the Academy Awards are just around the corner, normal people who have no idea who won best cinematographer in 1976 are starting to take an interest. ",2006-02-21T12:10:06+0000

He was the Founder of the Heart Rythm Society (HRS), a professional organization, and long-time editor of its journal, PACE.

He trained in surgery at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, then served in the U.S. Navy Medical Corps. After training as a heart surgeon, he returned to Montefiore, with progressive emphasis on pacemakers, so that much of his career was spent with the cardiology division. He remained at Montefiore and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine where he became professor of both medicine and surgery. Dr. Furman was predeceased in 2002 by his wife, the former Evelyn Katz.

Mr. McCreevy, left, the commissioner for the internal market, said moves by France and Luxembourg to shield the steel group Arcelor from a takeover by Mittal Steel were out of step with European law. At the same time, he threatened Poland with a lawsuit over its attempts to protect a domestic banking group. Poland has held firm in its decision to block the acquisition of Bank BPH by UniCredito, the last obstacle to Unicredito's $25 billion purchase of the HVB Group of Germany, which owns BPH. Protectionism is ""the wrong message to be sending about the openness of the European Union to new investment,"" he said in a news briefing in Brussels. Mr. McCreevy's broadside came the same day that Thierry Breton, the finance minister of France, proposed legislation limiting unsolicited takeovers.

The actor nominated in a film that was the lowest-grossing of the group has never won the ultimate prize.

Though the rest of her music may not break much new ground, Ms. Tunstall's debut album, ""Eye to the Telescope,"" is happily occupied with grown-up concerns. Having paid her dues in bands in the United States, Ms. Tunstall has just won a Brit Award for best British female solo artist. There is lots of promise to her album, with some songs suggesting a bouncier Fiona Apple and others, less interestingly, conjuring a pricklier Dido or Nellie Furtado. Ms. Tunstall is touring here now amid buzz generated by the rainbow suspenders she sports over a sparkling shirt on her album's cover shot, interpreted by some fans as a lesbian symbol. Ms. Tunstall has said that she didn't know of the connection, but for a rising star, at this point, you assume any chatter is welcome chatter.

Hevesi, left. The projected figure is $500 million more than previously forecast. Mr. Hevesi praised Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for proposing to transfer $1 billion from this year's surplus toward the cost of retiree health benefits in response to new accounting rules; another $200 million will be set aside to pay for capital projects now rather than incurring the costs of debt in the future. Mr. Hevesi attributed the city's fiscal health to the economic recovery, conservative revenue forecasts and ""Mayor Bloomberg's steady stewardship,"" but also warned that job and wage growth had been weaker than in past recoveries and that the city faced risks from a softening real estate market, higher energy costs and weak consumer spending.

In 1976, the Yale-educated Beinfield founded the first community-based Surgical Residency program for Physician Assistants (PAs) in conjunction with the Yale School of Medicine and Norwalk Hospital. He remained director for 20 years. Beinfield was widely published in medical journals. One article proposed shortening lengthy post-operative hospital stays, leading to early discharge and ambulatory surgery. Beinfield became an early advocate for breast-conserving surgery in the management of malignancy, initiating clinical lumpectomy trials at Yale. Beinfield was Chief of Surgery at Norwalk Hospital, which he joined as an attending surgeon in 1951. Beinfield taught at Yale as an Associate Clinical Professor of Surgery. Along with his wife, Marjorie, Beinfield was a lifelong advocate of social justice. In addition to his beloved wife Marjorie of 60 years, Beinfield is survived by his children. They are Harriet Beinfield, Lynn Beinfield, Elizabeth Falsey, Bruce Beinfield AIA, and an adoptive son, John Edoga, a vascular surgeon, originally from Nigeria. He has eight grandchildren. A memorial service is scheduled for Friday at 2 P.M. at the Unitarian Church, 10 Lyons Plains Road, Westport.

One of the few true contraltos singing today, with a dusky voice and profoundly expressive artistry, Ms. Podles is the opposite of the stereotype of a pretty singer; this is not a voice to play in the background at brunch, but one that has the power to move you to the tips of your toes as it rises from inky depths through a husky center to ringing top notes. And where many singers are limited to a few kinds of music, Ms. Podles has a huge range of repertory, some of which she will demonstrate in this concert, which takes her from a Rossini cantata, ""Joan of Arc"" (orchestrated by the contemporary Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino), to one of her showpieces, Mussorgsky's ""Songs and Dances of Death"" (orchestrated by Shostakovich). The concert is not actually a recital, but the 50th-anniversary celebration of the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, which under its music director, Constantine Orbelian, will also play orchestral arrangements of Prokofiev's ""Visions Fugitives,"" Shostakovich's Chamber Symphony in C minor and Haydn's Symphony No. 49. Well and good, but since the event represents Ms. Podles's only New York appearance this season, it's likely to attract a disproportionate number of opera lovers. Peter Gelb, are you listening?

us,The Listings: Feb. 24 - March 2; HUMAN FEEL,"During the first half of the 1990's, the ensemble known as Human Feel, above, was several things at once: a workshop for unruly improvisational tactics, a self-styled alternative to neo-conservatism, and a delivery system for some of the era's most unclassifiable new talent. Its founding core consisted of the multireedists Chris Speed and Andrew D'Angelo and the drummer Jim Black, a trio of Seattle natives transplanted via music school to Boston, where they shared an apartment as well as an aesthetic. Various others floated in and out of the group before the arrival of the guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel, which proved definitive. As a bass-less quartet, Human Feel strained toward the ragged-edge postmodernism established by a previous generation of downtown avatars like John Zorn and Tim Berne, but with an emotional directness more closely derived from underground rock. It was energy music, plugged into the spirit of the age. Arriving in New York, the band's members were quickly absorbed into one scene or another: Mr. Speed and Mr. Black became one half of Mr. Berne's raucous Bloodcount, Mr. D'Angelo dug in with the drummer Matt Wilson, and Mr. Rosenwinkel became a mainstay at Smalls. The musicians have hardly been strangers since, but the last proper Human Feel album, ""Speak to It"" (Songlines), was released in 1996. This reunion -- the first in years -- comes amid reports of a new recording. And it offers a good measure of the ways in which the musicians, separately and in collaboration, have exceeded their early promise.

It was in the 8 p.m. hour when the four networks really collided. The results show of Fox's ""American Idol,"" during which 4 contestants of the top 24 got the boot, was the clear winner, with an audience of 23.07 million. Competing against it were CBS's ""Survivor"" (14.85 million) and the first hour of ABC's ""Dancing With the Stars"" (14.78 million), as well as the Olympics (17.74 million). The three non-Olympic programs cannibalized one another, as ""Idol"" didn't perform at its usual heights, and ""Survivor"" had its lowest-rated original episode ever. (""Dancing"" did rebound in its second hour, lifting its total audience to 17.68 million.) Between 10 p.m. and 11:30 p.m., skating took over, with an audience of more than 30 million tuning in to NBC.

In November, Unity Marketing reported that purchases of luxury apparel had dipped 27 percent from the previous year among luxury-goods shoppers in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Harriet Miers's Supreme Court debacle and the indictment of I. Lewis Libby. A month later, that hell-in-a-handbasket feeling was alleviated as lower gas prices and increased hiring boosted consumer confidence. Here are our predictions for how high-end goods would fare based on realpolitik hypotheticals. CHRISTINE MUHLKE",2006-02-26T05:00:00+0000
us,The High Cost of Breaking Even,"""Bug,"" the blood-drenched thriller by Tracy Letts, had all the hallmarks of a runaway success: fawning reviews, a young, hip cast and a movie deal. Despite running for 11 months at the Barrow Street Theater, though, the $200,000 production barely broke even, only collecting its first dollars in the black -- and there weren't many of them -- in its closing weeks in January 2005. It's a phenomenon that is all too familiar to commercial producers Off Broadway, which has been in a protracted slump in the last couple of years. ""It's a constant struggle to justify the business,"" said Scott Morfee, one of the ""Bug"" producers. But what exactly makes the business so tough? Well, expenses, which keep growing, and audiences, which don't. ""Bug"" cost about $34,000 a week to run; some Off Broadway productions cost twice that. Mr. Morfee and his partners kept expenses down a number of ways, including managing the show themselves and staging it at the Barrow, where Mr. Morfee holds the lease. To show how hard it can be to make a go of it, Mr. Morfee took the rare step of opening his books on ""Bug""; the figures at right are averages taken from several different weeks during the run. They include some one-time costs -- like the opening-night cast party -- amortized over the show's 11-month run. And while this is an average week, ""Bug"" broke even with the help of some sell-out weeks, when the profits were greater than those shown here. In the end, ""Bug"" sold about $2 million worth of tickets and cost about $2 million to run. All of which leaves Mr. Morfee a little bemused. ""If we pop the Champagne every time we break even,"" he said, ""I don't know what kind of business we're in.""",2006-02-26T05:00:00+0000

After winning re-election in a landslide in 1936, the seemingly invincible Franklin Roosevelt stumbled badly with his plan to pack the Supreme Court. Richard Nixon had Watergate, Ronald Reagan Iran-contra. Bill Clinton coasted to victory in 1996, then saw the name Monica enter the history books. Is George W. Bush, not yet halfway through his second term, heading down the same road? Two reviews in this issue suggest that the president is facing problems not only with Democrats but with members of his own camp. In his review of ""My Year in Iraq,"" the memoir by L. Paul Bremer III (Page 8), Dexter Filkins recounts ""a jaw-dropping scene"" in which Bremer, who ran Iraq for 14 months, indicates that he knew what reporters like Filkins were seeing around them -- the White House had failed to provide sufficient troops to do the job they were sent to Iraq to do. On the domestic front, meanwhile, deep divisions have emerged among Republicans whom the administration had successfully kept united until now. Discussing Jeffrey Hart's ""Making of the Conservative Mind"" and Bruce Bartlett's ""Impostor"" (Page 9), George Will describes ""conservatives at daggers drawn with one another,"" as tensions rise between religious populists and Goldwater libertarians. Indeed, as Will suggests, with Republicans of every stripe criticizing the president for one thing or another, the very meaning of the word ""conservative"" may now be up for grabs.",2006-02-26T05:00:00+0000

The items in question were a characteristically whimsical Marni evening pouch that had cost this side of $800 -- and that I had originally planned to wear to a nephew's bar mitzvah to offset a stark, synagogue-appropriate St. John Knits ensemble but in the end decided against in favor of a borrowed and less contrapuntal Lambertson Truex lizard clutch -- and an uncharacteristically unconstructed Jil Sander bag ($670) that had briefly spoken to me in my continuing search for an Edenic black bag.

Into the void steps ""The Fugitive Wife,"" an enormously satisfying first novel about the dreamers and schemers who flocked to Alaska at the turn of the 20th century. The heroine, Essie Crummey, is a spunky Minnesota farm girl who has finally given up on her alcoholic husband after the death of their child.

Here is a look at the long program jumps of previous winners and this year's medalists. One caveat when comparing skaters from different eras: the maximum number of jumping passes has changed over the years. Baiul and Yamaguchi had eight jumping passes, while Lipinski and Hughes had six. Current rules allow seven jumping passes. ARCHIE TSE",2006-02-26T05:00:00+0000

My garments are totally based around what the print can do -- the print creating all the shape. I think of myself as a print designer who became a fashion designer. Do you take the view, like Chanel and Lagerfeld, that it is a compliment to be copied? Copying is always going to happen, so it is better to be copied and noted as mine. Are the patterns drawn from life or the imagination? The pattern is drawn from whatever I am inspired by, be it travel to China or knitting stitches on a sweater in Wales. The source of all my inspiration is my sketchbook. I travel everywhere with it. The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is doing a show about British style in May. Do you feel you were part of a movement in the 60's? My 60's contribution comes from my English roots, but reinterpreting Warhol and Lichtenstein: light bulbs, comics, lipstick advertisements by Guy Bourdin in Vogue. I think most remarkable are the chic hippie looks of the late 60's and early 70's and the flowing caftans. Tell me about your museum in London. I founded the Fashion and Textile Museum because I believe British fashion and the U.K. art-school system have had a groundbreaking effect on world fashion. I felt people like Ossie Clark, Jean Muir and Bill Gibb have never had the recognition they deserve. I have found the museum an uphill task. Most of the money I have managed to raise has come from the American Friends of the Zandra Rhodes Museum. Do you feel helped by the Pucci revival and the change of mood or, for you, is it prints now and forever? I feel very positive by the way fashion has chosen to revamp old brands.

At the age of forty, she followed Walter to Germany. Although not speaking a word of German, she eventually became fluent and established a home for her family and a large circle of friends. Her insight was invaluable in moments of family crisis. She understood what was happening and had love for all. The loss of her wisdom and sense of fun leaves a void in our hearts. Molly died at home surrounded by her family on February 20th. The last two years were not kind to her. It was her time to go.. She had a clear and constant courage; we see the best of her in our families and in the hope for our future. We will miss her. She is survived by her husband Walter, her five children, 11 grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. In addition to living overseas Molly has been a resident of Greenwich, CT since the late '40s. For those who knew Molly the family requests a contributions to a memory book. In lieu of flowers we ask that a donation be made in her name either to the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park, 345-43rd Street, Brooklyn, NY 11232 or The October Fund Arthritis Foundation, 222 East 42nd Street, 18th Floor, New York, NY 10168-1898.",2006-02-26T05:00:00+0000

Schwartz, a grocer's son from the Bronx who had acquired a serviceable education hanging around pool halls and racetracks, gave his boyhood friend Calvin Klein $10,000 to start a coat business. Since then, hundreds of designers, when faced with the terrible odds of going solo in the fashion business, have said to themselves, ""What I need is a Barry Schwartz."" A Schwartz at your back was proof against shutdown, a guarantee of unending loyalty. Three years ago, Klein and Schwartz sold Calvin Klein Inc. to Phillips-Van Heusen in a deal worth about $730 million. Klein has kept a hand in the company's advertising. He also travels a lot; Brazil is apparently a favorite destination. Schwartz, a gambler at bottom, devotes himself to his horse-racing operations, a sideline developed in the first gold-rush days of designer denim and underwear. Horses bred on his 741-acre farm in Westchester County run at the country's top tracks, and Schwartz stepped down as the chairman of the New York Racing Association at the end of 2004. Although Wall Street was skeptical that Phillips-Van Heusen could manage a designer label -- it was better known for brands like Izod and Bass -- Calvin Klein has apparently thrived under PVH. Its runway collections, by Klein's chosen successor, Francisco Costa, have received some of the best reviews in the company's history, and PVH's stock price has risen from $11.50 in January 2003 to nearly $37 as of mid-January.",2006-02-26T05:00:00+0000

But in a business often associated with name-brand stars, diva-wrangling directors and picky playwrights, these are the people who help bring those characters' talents to a paying audience. They range from Tara Rubin, an unsuccessful actress turned very successful casting director (she has accounts with six musicals now running on Broadway) to Freddie Gershon, a smooth-talking show salesman whose work on the road keeps royalties rolling in for cash-poor creative types back in town. While much of the power on Broadway remains in the hands of the producers, the theater owners and the critics -- and much of the business's day-to-day is handled by camera-shy tribes of press agents and general managers -- many of this assembled cast are valuable specialists in an increasingly complex industry. Armed with talents like negotiation (see The Lawyers, The Labor Leaders), sales (The Licensers, The Group Seller), buzz (The Marketers) or taste (The Agents, The Casting Agents), each has a niche, if not a big name. Here is a selective look at some of the behind-the-scenes players on Broadway, what they do, and why.

That's a question we're sometimes asked, and it's a question we tend to leave to the book industry's gods, philosophers and publicists. But most writers will tell you they'll take the bad review -- better to take a pounding than be ignored entirely. Bernard-Henri Lvy, the French writer whose book ""American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville"" was eaten alive on our cover recently by Garrison Keillor (""Don't let the door hit you on the way out"" was one of the kinder lines), agrees with that sentiment. ""My belief is that controversy is always good,"" Lvy said good-naturedly in a recent telephone interview. ""I've always thought controversy is the best thing that can happen -- well, one of the best things."" Keillor's review doesn't seem to have hurt sales of ""American Vertigo."" The book appeared on the hardcover nonfiction list last week at No. 15, though this week it drops to No. 28. On his book tour in the United States, Lvy said, he is always asked about Keillor's review. ""Everybody talks to me about it,"" he said, adding that the review has brought him waves of support and sympathy. While ""American Vertigo"" is Lvy's first best seller in the United States, he has published some 30 books in France, and nearly all the major ones have made the best-seller lists there. Lvy said he was ""surprised and pleased"" to see his book on the Times list. ""I've felt so at home in America,"" he added. ""Now I feel even more at home."" Back in France, Lvy sometimes reviews books. ""But like Garrison Keillor,"" he said, ""I am not a professional reviewer."" Has he panned many writers?

us,The Remix; Viva BibaIn,"1971, the British boutique Biba was so successful that an anarchist group called the Angry Brigade bombed it as a symbol of the establishment. Four years later, however, this lavish emporium of cool, where flamingos once strolled and hippie chicks preened whenever Mick and Bianca breezed in, was on the auction block. One of its founders, Barbara Hulanicki, up and left London, and a label (below) that once defined a generation died a rock-star death. Fast-forward 30 years. After a few failed resuscitation attempts, Biba is back. Last fall Michael Pearce, who acquired the rights to Biba International Ltd., previewed a range of bags and shoes, which use the original lasts. This month, just as they hit stores like Browns, a Biba ready-to-wear line made its debut during London Fashion Week. The collection, which is designed by Bella Freud, mixes contemporary looks with tweaked Biba classics. Elsewhere, two books and a CD retrace the label's glory days, while a Biba museum exhibition and Biba Ball are in the works for later this year. Hulanicki is also working on what she says is ""the final book on Biba."" But her involvement ends there. She has distanced herself from the label since the 70's and is unimpressed by fashion's fixation with the past: ""Every house is chasing its own tail. Aren't there enough hip brands already?""

Little Edie, as she was known, has been a fashion antiheroine since she wrapped a skirt upside-down around her hips and called it ""the best costume for the day"" in Albert and David Maysles's 1975 cult documentary, ""Grey Gardens."" ""I can't count the number of times I've been at a fashion shoot where someone says, 'Let's tie a sweater on her head and do an Edie Beale,""' says Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York. This spring, Beale, who died at age 84 in 2002, inspires a new generation through three projects: an off-Broadway musical based on Edie, her mother and their condemned mansion in East Hampton, N.Y.; a DVD with unseen ""Grey Gardens"" footage; and a scrapbook of Little Edie's photos and letters compiled by the New Yorker writer Hilton Als. Already there is buzz. ""What is so intriguing about Little Edie is her belief in her own beauty,"" says John Bartlett, whose fall 2000 collection used ""Grey Gardens"" as a leitmotif.

The tattoo is a reminder to have guts, take chances and throw yourself into what's scary and hard. ""It's very difficult to get great roles,"" Weisz said in early January, over a late-afternoon tea of yogurt and orange juice (she was five months pregnant) at a coffee shop near her Manhattan home in SoHo. Weisz can look smoky and irresistibly alluring on film, which seems to bring out the dark lushness of her hair and eyes, but in person she has a lovely, fresh-scrubbed quality. On the day we met, this was accentuated by a white wool sailor cap and an oversize blue-and-white-striped nautical sweater. Although she had just returned from a Christmas holiday in sunny Jamaica with her fianc, the director Darren Aronofsky (""I'm in charge of the wedding,"" she explained about the reverse order of baby first and ceremony later, ""and I haven't figured all that out yet""), Weisz was alabaster pale and looked less like a siren and more like a radiant English schoolgirl, home from university.",2006-02-26T05:00:00+0000

Make that dozens of white shirts. ""I think I was born in a white shirt,"" she says, laughing. ""And I'm constantly finding new ones, because you know, you can't keep them for very long. Once they lose their crispness, they must be retired."" Herrera has a couple other rules when it comes to button-downs, whether they hail from Banana Republic or her own design studio (like the one above): ""Collar height is crucial. I like it a little bit higher, so you don't have to turn it up. And the shirt must be cotton, so it stays crisp. Silk doesn't work."" Herrera's look travels well, too. ""Whether I'm going to South America in the summer or Europe in the winter, I always pack at least six white shirts,"" she says. ""I'll take different cuts, some with French cuffs, some with regular cuffs."" Much of the white shirt's appeal lies in its blank-slate versatility. Herrera is as likely to wear one to a formal occasion as she is to the beach. ""White shirts can be demure, elegant, mysterious or romantic,"" she says. ""I love the idea of wearing one with a ball gown. Or over a bustier with the buttons open -- very 18th century."" Or, better yet, by itself.

Bloomberg. The agreement will be announced today, according to Make the Road by Walking, an immigrant advocacy group that took part in the negotiations. The new services are an attempt to address a dispute over the Education Equity Act passed by the Council, which required the department to provide interpretation services at large meetings at which at least 10 percent of those likely to attend would be unable to speak English. Another requirement was that documents intended for parents, like report cards and important notices, had to be available in the nine languages most widely used in the city. The Council passed the act in December, on a 35-to-11 vote, but the mayor vetoed the measure in January, saying that, though he agreed with the substance of the proposal, only the state government could legislate on education matters. The agreement will have many of the same features as the Education Equity Act. JENNIFER 8. LEE (NYT)",2006-02-27T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   SCHERZER, IRWIN S.","SCHERZER--Irwin S. Passed away at the age of 73 on February 24, 2006. Beloved son of the late Hyman and Bertha Scherzer. Irwin grew up in Lynn, Massachusetts and was an honors graduate of Harvard College Class of 1954 and Harvard Business School Class of 1956. He served for two years as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy. He began his business career with west coast based RamoWooldridge Corp., but soon moved to New York and shifted his focus to the management of musical organizations. He got his start managing classical music bookings for Columbia Artists. Thereafter, he held several positions including Vice President of Grey Advertising with responsibility for the RCA classical musical label. In 1969, he became the founding administrative director of the newly formed Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. His management skills contributed mightily to the success of the fledgling effort, now one of the city's musical institutions. He worked closely with the directors of the Society including philanthropist Alice Tully. He subsequently became business manager and trusted adviser to Miss Tully who relied upon his many talents as she pursued her diverse activities in the arts and music. Irwin can only be described with superlatives. He was truly an example of the sui generis personality. Luminous intelligence, brilliant wit and raconteur, striking linguistic ability, generosity of spirit, a keen social conscience and indomitable courage in the face of adversity, these were the qualities that endeared him to his legion of friends. His knowledge of opera, classical music and the culinary arts was encyclopedic. His wit gushed forth in a seemingly unending flow of quips and jaunty apercus. He spoke six languages fluently and had a working knowledge of a half dozen more. He was never satisfied unless his friends shared fully in the realms that gave him pleasure, and thus did he enrich all who knew him. His social consciousness was manifested in his support of the battle against an outmoded social value. His zest for life never flagged despite daunting health issues. He lived a life filled with love and caring. Irwin is survived by his beloved partner, Chien Cho (JJ) Liu, and his devoted cousins Alicia, Babs, Harry, Gloria and Bobby. He will be sorely missed by his many friends who will forever cherish his memory and will find comfort in the warm remembrances of the good times spent with him. His memory can be honored by donations to Tannery Pond Concerts, P.O. Box 446, New Lebanon, NY 12125. A date for a memorial concert will be announced.",2006-02-28T05:00:00+0000

The $420 million budget for the renovation project, starting in 2011 and expected to continue for about 15 years, was cleared unanimously after a yearlong struggle in the German legislature, representatives of the museum said yesterday. A fourth wing will permit the art of major civilizations from Mesopotamia, Egypt and Greece to be displayed on one level. Once the renovation is finished, the museum's director said, each collection will have its own wing with a separate entrance. The project is part of a $1.8 billion project to renovate Museum Island, the site of the Pergamon and other museums, which attracted 800,00 visitors last year. The Pergamon will remain partly open during construction. SARAH PLASS",2006-02-28T05:00:00+0000

The new council would replace the discredited Human Rights Commission, where seats are often held by well-documented human rights abusers.
