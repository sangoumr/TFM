Born in Park Chester, the Bronx, daughter of Frank and Johanna Leff, Naomi attended the High School of Music and Art in NYC, earned a BS from Cortland State University, an MA in Sociology at the University of Wisconsin, and an MFA in Environmental Design with a minor in Architecture from Pratt Institute. Naomi began her career at JC Warnecke, designing interiors for Nieman-Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman and from 1975-80 as a senior designer at Bloomingdales. She opened her namesake firm in 1980, concentrating on retail and residential design. Leff's skills became widely admired in 1986 when she transformed the 1898 Rhinelander Mansion at Madison and 72nd into the flagship store for Polo Ralph Lauren. Other retail clients in the U.S. included Saks Fifth Avenue, Ferragamo, Gucci, Giorgio Armani, and Helena Rubenstein, and in Canada a series of stores for Holt Renfrew. In 1991 she designed Shearson Lehman American Express' 25,000 sq/ ft Saddle Ridge Conf. Center in Beaver Creek, Colorado. She designed homes, planes, and yachts for some of the most prominent bicoastal entertainment and business people of today. Naomi was truly a star among stars. Leff was given the Mayor's Award by John Lindsay for her design of youth centers in NY and won ""Store of the Year"" for many of her designs. In 1990 she received the Distinguished Alumni Award from Pratt Institute, joined its board in 1991 and in 2000 received its ""Living Legends"" award. She was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Fashion Group. In 1991 she was inducted into the Interior Design Magazine Hall of Fame. She was perennially included in Architectural Digest's listings as one of the world's 100 top designers and recently was chosen by them as one of the top 30 in the country.

The Rockefeller University community mourns with deep sadness the loss of our beloved colleague and friend, William Trager, a world renowned authority on parasitic diseases, insect physiology and tropical medicine who served the university with distinction for more than 70 years. A member of the US National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Trager was best known for his seminal contributions to our understanding of the malaria parasite. Dr. Trager opened the way to the cellular and molecular analysis of the malaria parasite through his breakthrough techniques for culturing the parasite in the test tube. He was a passionate collector of parasite strains and was deeply interested in genetic variation of the malaria parasite and the mechanisms that generated parasite diversity. He trained generations of parasitologists and his impact on malaria research is immeasurable. Dr. Trager loved the lab, loved doing experiments and was active at the bench into his late '80's. He was truly one of the seminal figures in malaria research of the twentieth century. He will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family.

Bloomberg said yesterday. The change follows criticism by the firefighters union that smaller crews, which save the city money, posed a danger to firefighters and the public. But Mr. Bloomberg said the decision was made because fewer firefighters are on sick leave. Under the contract with the union, the city can remove the fifth firefighter if more than 7.5 percent of city firefighters are on medical leave. The mayor said the percentage has fallen below that threshold. Mike McIntire (NYT)",2005-02-02T05:00:00+0000

On Tuesday, King Gyanendra dismissed Nepal's government, imposed a state of emergency and curtailed constitutional guarantees, including the right of assembly. Rights groups said they had reports of media censorship and of a substantial number of arrests. The king had announced that he would attend the summit meeting in place of the prime minister he had just fired, and India clearly intended to send strong messages not only to Nepal, but also to Bangladesh, plagued by increasing lawlessness and political violence. Last week, a former finance minister was killed in a grenade attack. Indian officials said there were concerns about how safe Mr. Singh would be in Dhaka.

The company, which is based in Tokyo, was the latest Japanese electronics company to cut profit forecasts because of declines in the prices of semiconductors, DVD recorders and other electronics products. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Hitachi said its net income rose to 26.6 billion yen, from 2.5 billion yen a year earlier, mostly because of a decline in reorganization charges.

For years, Mr. Urbaniak, above, who specializes in portrayals of sensitive outsiders racked by angst, obsession or artistic genius, has been a star in hipster circles because of his oddball roles in black-box theaters (he played the French theorist Guy Debord in the stage adaptation of ""Lipstick Traces""), Hal Hartley movies (the shy poet/garbage man in ""Henry Fool"") and the occasional television cameo (the foot fetishist in ""Sex and the City""). But lately, he has begun to branch out, making his Broadway debut earlier this season in a scene-stealing turn as a gossipy servant in the revival of the 18th-century comedy ""The Rivals."" And he is currently starring in a commercial Off Broadway production as the jumpy title character in Will Eno's one-man-show ""Thom Pain (based on nothing),"" a teasing play that might remind audiences of one of Edward Albee's more abstract dramas. Mr. Urbaniak, whose angular face and slender body gives him the look of a hungry bird, delivers an astonishing performance of a vacant, yet somehow charming, man who rambles in an almost stream of consciousness style for 60 minutes. The script is willfully inscrutable, full of jokes without punch lines and magic tricks that peter out. But what is consistent throughout is the alert and icy gaze of Mr. Urbaniak, who keeps your attention totally transfixed, generating suspense with hardly any plot to assist him. He may be performing above 14th street, but Mr. Urbaniak remains as cool as ever.

You were always willing to compromise on every point in order to achieve harmony because you respected other people and felt that was the way to move forward in a spirit of cooperation. But you fought with all your heart for an extended life. And Dad, thankfully, you won that battle. You won it for yourself and you won it for us, your family. You gave us the gift of being here for so long. I thank you for being the man you were and for teaching all of us the real value of life and for loving each one of us so individually. In your own words, ""one is as precious to me as the next."" I know you are at peace. You will always be alive in my heart.

He was a Professor Emeritus and former Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at SUNY Health Science Center, Director of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Kings County Hospital and former Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Brookdale Medical Center, all of Brooklyn. The only twice elected President of the Alumni Association-College of Medicine, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, he was a recipient of the Frank L. Babbott Memorial Award for Excellence in Teaching, a Diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery and Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, and the author of numerous publications on plastic and reconstructive surgery. Born on the fourth of July in 1922, Leon was a 1942 graduate of Rutgers University. He left medical school in 1943 to enter the U.S. Navy, and was skipper (Lt. J.G., USN) of an LCT in the Pacific theatre during WWII. He was present at the invasions of Okinawa and Iwo Jima and was a witness to the raising of the US flag on Mt. Surabachi. Returning to medical school after the War, Leon earned a medical degree at Long Island College Hospital (now SUNY Medical School) in 1949, and a graduate degree in history from New York University in 1980. Leon's life was dedicated to the practice of plastic surgery, imparting his knowledge and modesty to his beloved medical residence, and to enhancing the quality of life for his patients. An avid cyclist and accomplished pianist, from Chopin to the golden oldies, Leon's enthusiastic ""bravos"" at the opera and ballet will be missed. His enthusiasm, curiosity and appetite for life made him an interesting and great conversationalist and enabled him to bear the infirmities of aging with dignity, courage and humor. Many thanks to his doctors, whose support and affection for him was unflagging, to his nurses Elaine, Brigid and Eileen, who cared for him with professionalism and love and to loving and faithful Virginia and Dora. Eternal gratitude to his friends who gave care, love and compassion. Leon is survived by his beloved wife Josephine L. Berger-Nadler, his children Michael, Jonathan, Jenny and Eliott from his former marriage, his sisters Emma and Rachal and three grandchildren, Julia, Lily, and Melissa and is predeceased by his son William.

The 252-year-old Athenaeum, in Rhode Island, is one of the nation's oldest private lending libraries, established before public libraries were the norm. In 2002, financial pressures and sagging beams led its board to authorize a sale of the library's large-size copy of John James Audubon's ""Birds of America."" Dozens of library users sued, and the infighting was one factor in last year's resignation of the previous executive director, Jonathan Bengtson. Richard A.

Ms. Maxell, who has master's degrees in library science and business administration, has run the Consortium of Rhode Island Academic and Research Libraries and the Richards Memorial Library in North Attleboro, Mass.

After nearly 24 years in power, he appears ready to add 6 more in a single-candidate referendum this fall, all the while grooming his son Gamal for an eventual Pharaonic succession.

us,The Listings; SHERMAN DREXLER: 'ART PARADISE: 50 YEARS OF PAINTING',"That things primitive and archaic should have been such compelling points of orientation for forward-thinking Modernists is one of the more fruitful paradoxes of 20th-century art. Sherman Drexler, 80, is a case in point. Mr. Drexler, who has been heard from little since a solo exhibition at P.S. 1 in 1984, has followed his own slightly eccentric path for more than five decades, but his paintings of generalized female nudes (based on his wife, the Pop painter and writer Rosalyn Drexler), horses or deer in the midst of broad, flat areas of paint combine the primordial and the abstract in a way that is close to the center of a Modernist mainstream running from Matisse to Susan Rothenberg. The large canvases featured in this small retrospective show have a scruffy, raw appearance; they are not beautiful but they exude a persuasive urgency of purpose. That Mr. Drexler thinks of himself at least in part as a kind of modern cave painter is affirmed by a remarkable installation of about 120 small paintings and objects imported from his Newark studio. Distributed over a plywood table, above, are scores of stones and fragments of construction debris on which the artist has roughly painted little dancing female nudes as though to evoke the timeless, pantheistic soul of the modern material world.

But he has had an impact on his field through decades of performances and recordings, especially of the Viennese classical repertory, and also through his important scholarly contributions, including valued editions of works by Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. Mr. Badura-Skoda, above, whose last name is a combination of his father's and stepfather's given names (both of Czech heritage), will give an all-Schubert recital at the Austrian Cultural Forum tonight. The recital comes just after the release by Kleos Classics of a seven-CD set, ""Paul Badura-Skoda: A Man and His Music,"" that chronicles his long career. It includes private recordings from his teenage years that may startle those who know of him only as an urbane musician and scholar. There are, for example, his performances of some Rossini overtures played on the accordion in his own transcriptions. The accordion was his stepfather's passion, and young Paul was essentially compelled to learn it. In the extensive liner notes to the recording Mr. Badura-Skoda charmingly recalls how he used to sneak into the standing-room section of the Vienna State Opera through an obscure entry. He also vividly describes some formative experiences, like taking master classes with the great pianist Edwin Fischer, performing a Mozart concerto with Furtwngler just 18 months before the conductor's death, and working with Herbert von Karajan. The last CD documents Mr. Badura-Skoda's 75th birthday concert in 2002 in Vienna, a program of Schubert, Brahms and Ravel played with poise, style and insight. His all-Schubert recital tonight offers 13 waltzes, four impromptus and the Sonata in A (D. 959). (Tonight at 8, Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)772-1132.

The 1985 movie ""A Time to Live and a Time to Die,"" screening tonight at 7, is an autobiographical account of Mr. Hou's childhood that seems to consist almost entirely of incidental details -- tops spinning in the dirt of a village square, a towel fluttering in the wind -- which eventually add up to a full, vibrant portrait of a provincial city. Mr. Hou has the great gift of being able to stand back from the characters he has created, observing them from a careful distance while they go about their apparently autonomous lives. Mr. Hou's great subject has always been Taiwan, the island outpost to which his family fled after the Communist takeover of mainland China. The early films focus on social problems -- alienated youth in ""The Boys From Fengkuei"" (1983), unemployment in ""Dust in the Wind"" (1987) -- while the later work, like ""The Puppetmaster"" (1993), ""Good Men, Good Women"" (1995) and ""Goodbye South, Goodbye"" (1996), above, takes a more historical and cultural approach, observing contemporary Taiwan through a cloud of cigarette smoke and a jangle of cellphones. (All of these titles will be screened this week at Anthology, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, in the East Village; for a complete schedule, check www.anthologyfilmarchives.org or call (212)505-5181.

Thursdays are generally a feeble night for ABC, but the power of the Fonz and Richie Cunningham (Henry Winkler, left, and Ron Howard) put it in a strong position for the night. The program was nearly three times as popular as the network's regular lineup, ""Life as We Know It"" and ""Extreme Makeover."" But CBS's dominance on Thursdays is entrenched, and new episodes of ""CSI"" and ""Without a Trace"" brought the No. 1 network a victory in both total viewers and households.

He was a Professor Emeritus and former Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at SUNY Health Science Center, Director of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Kings County Hospital and former Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Brookdale Medical Center, all of Brooklyn. The only twice elected President of the Alumni Association-College of Medicine, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, he was a recipient of the Frank L. Babbott Memorial Award for Excellence in Teaching, a Diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery and Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, and the author of numerous publications on plastic and reconstructive surgery. Born on the fourth of July in 1922, Leon was a 1942 graduate of Rutgers University. He left medical school in 1943 to enter the U.S. Navy, and was skipper (Lt. J.G., USN) of an LCT in the Pacific theatre during WWII. He was present at the invasions of Okinawa and Iwo Jima and was a witness to the raising of the US flag on Mt. Surabachi. Returning to medical school after the War, Leon earned a medical degree at Long Island College Hospital (now SUNY Medical School) in 1949, and a graduate degree in history from New York University in 1980. Leon's life was dedicated to the practice of plastic surgery, imparting his knowledge and modesty to his beloved medical residence, and to enhancing the quality of life for his patients. An avid cyclist and accomplished pianist, from Chopin to the golden oldies, Leon's enthusiastic ""bravos"" at the opera and ballet will be missed. His enthusiasm, curiosity and appetite for life made him an interesting and great conversationalist and enabled him to bear the infirmities of aging with dignity, courage and humor. Many thanks to his doctors, whose support and affection for him was unflagging, to his nurses Elaine, Brigid and Eileen, who cared for him with professionalism and love and to loving and faithful Virginia and Dora. Eternal gratitude to his friends who gave care, love and compassion. Leon is survived by his beloved wife Josephine L.

If the exchange were acquired and merged with one run from outside Britain, British listing rules would not necessarily govern companies listed on the exchange, said Callum McCarthy, chairman of the authority. ""The attractiveness of the U.K. financial markets, and ultimately the competitiveness of the E.U. capital markets, depends in part on a system of corporate governance and of regulation which is of a high standard,"" Mr. McCarthy said.

us,Shabby Chic,"Muslin is the cheap friend of cottage curtains. But in haute couture, it's the handmaiden to the evening gown. No designer worthy of being called a couturier would risk spoiling 30 yards of Lyons silk to make a prototype that will be stuck with pins, stained with ink and even garishly daubed with Post-its. That's what humble muslin is for. It's the R.E.M. phase of the couture dream cycle, when designers transfer each sketch to a plain raiment they call a toile. They actually spend more time with the toiles than they do the finished dresses, since couture workrooms don't begin to assemble all the various parts of a garment -- the jacket front that may be at Lesage for embroidery, a collar that may be waiting for its hand-dyed ribbon trim -- until a few days before the show. This gives the toiles a certain influence beyond their quiet ability to impart a sense of line and silhouette to the designer as he sits in his studio refreshing himself with a Diet Pepsi (here you think of Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel) or another Marlboro (that would be John Galliano at Dior). That the toiles are as ghostly as they are beautifully made is not surprising; they serve as the patterns for the atelier when it's time to roll out the silk and organdy. And that's why they're embellished not with beads but with photocopies of beads and words like ""droit"" and ""grosgrain."" But the toiles are deceptive. A coat from Chanel looks wholesomely sweet in muslin, but when the needles are done, it may be in smoky shades of gray mohair embroidered on tulle and cost a pretty penny. And when you see Dior's Directoire-inspired dresses in white chiffon under coats worthy of Empress Josephine herself, the muslin loses its temporal power and returns to the cottage windows. After all, it's just a dream. Cathy Horyn",2005-02-06T05:00:00+0000

Consider the hardy book at No. 6 this week, the British writer Lynne Truss's ""Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation."" Truss's book has sat on the nonfiction list for 42 weeks, much longer than any other current title. Her book also happens to have withstood one of the most withering reviews in recent memory, Louis Menand's acid account, in The New Yorker, of the book's own grammatical errors. (""Either Truss needed a copy editor or her copy editor needed a copy editor,"" Menand cracked.) Truss's editor reacted; he called Menand a name that's not printable here. And in the London newspapers, at least one writer rushed patriotically to Truss's defense, describing Menand as humorless and observing that many of his criticisms are matters ""of taste and not correctness."" American readers, in love with Truss's breezily outraged tone, haven't seemed to care either way. Her new book, ""Talk to the Hand,"" will be published in November. It is about manners.

The only twice elected President of the Alumni Association-College of Medicine, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, he was a recipient of the Frank L. Babbott Memorial Award for Excellence in Teaching, a Diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery and Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, and the author of numerous publications on plastic and reconstructive surgery. Born on the fourth of July in 1922, Leon was a 1942 graduate of Rutgers University. He left medical school in 1943 to enter the U.S. Navy, and was skipper (Lt. J.G., USN) of an LCT in the Pacific theatre during WWII. He was present at the invasions of Okinawa and Iwo Jima and was a witness to the raising of the US flag on Mt. Surabachi. Returning to medical school after the War, Leon earned a medical degree at Long Island College Hospital (now SUNY Medical School) in 1949, and a graduate degree in history from New York University in 1980. Leon's life was dedicated to the practice of plastic surgery, imparting his knowledge and modesty to his beloved medical residents, and to enhancing the quality of life for his patients. An avid cyclist and accomplished pianist, from Chopin to the golden oldies, Leon's enthusiastic ""bravos"" at the opera and ballet will be missed.

A wellknown figure in the consumer goods world and heralded as an innovator who was formative in shaping the ice cream and frozen dessert industry, passed away on Saturday, January 29, at the age of 62. Descended from three generations of New York City purveyors of ice cream, Richard was Co-Chairman and CoChief Executive of CoolBrands International Inc., the Canadian ice cream maker which owns Chipwich, Eskimo Pie and the license for many branded frozen desserts, including Godiva Ice Cream and Tropicana fruit bars. He led the company from Ronkonkoma, New York, and was a resident of Southampton, New York. It was said that ice cream was in Richard's blood. His grandfather started Smith Brothers Ice Cream in the early 1900's, one of the first distributors of ice cream in the New York metropolitan area that made deliveries using horse drawn carriage. His father, Lester Smith, founder of Duvall French Ice Cream, owned and operated the last ice cream manufacturing plant in Manhattan, located at 92nd and 2nd Avenue. Richard Smith, however, built his own business from the ground up. In his mid-20's, he bought a partnership interest in Calip Dairies, Inc., and created what is today one of the largest distributors of ice cream in the tri-state region and the manufacturer of such ice cream brands as Dolly Madison, Schrafft's and Sedutto. In 1980 he created FrsenGladj, the super premium ice cream with the memorable name and the futuristic white, sculptured container that he later sold to Kraft Foods in 1995. That same year he bought Steve's Ice Cream of Boston, which he took public in 1986 as Steve's Homemade Ice Cream, Inc. The company then acquired Swensen's Ice Cream and grew to be a major ice cream manufacturer and franchisor. He merged his company (then called Integrated Brands, Inc.) with Yogen Frz World-Wide Inc. to create CoolBrands International Inc. in 1998. Under Richard's leadership, CoolBrands acquired The Eskimo Pie Corporaton in 2000, then Fruit-A-Freeze and Chipwich in 2002. In 2003, the company also bought Nestle's U.S. ice cream distribution operations; Dreyer's super premium brands Dreamery Ice Cream and Whole Fruit Sorbet; and the license for Godiva Ice Cream. Most recently, CoolBrands entered into an agreement to acquire Breyer's Yogurt from Kraft Foods. Richard was seen as the consummate entrepreneur whom many have called a ""larger than life"" figure. His colleagues and competitors remember him as a passionate and tireless worker who was remarkable for his creative intelligence, detailed knowledge of the business, and tremendous determination and persistence. He was also known for his deep devotion to his family and for his unpretentious demeanor and generous spirit. He was active in raising money for philanthropic causes, including the Diabetes Research Institute and many other charities. Richard Smith was born in 1942 in the Bronx, and attended Great Neck North High School on Long Island. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Ohio University and attended Syracuse Law School. Richard is survived by his mother, Fay; his loving wife of 39 years, Susan; his son, David; his two grandsons, Jared and James; and three godchildren, Ben, Hannah and Juliana Stein.

In addition to teaching finance, money and banking, and accounting to Hamilton undergraduates as the McEwen Professor of Economics, Dr. Wertimer served at various junctures of his career as economics department chairman, associate dean of the college, provost and college marshal. For half a century he was a volunteer firefighter for the Village of Clinton and kept a department radio crackling in his kitchen 24 hours a day. Born in Buffalo, New York, on October 28, 1920, Sidney Wertimer graduated in 1942 from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, then reported for active duty as an Ensign aboard the Navy destroyer William D. Porter. Following WWII, Lieutenant Wertimer returned to the University of Buffalo to obtain an M.A. degree in economics and went from there abroad to study at the London School of Economics where he earned a Ph.D. in 1952. Via transatlantic telephone, he was offered an assistant professorship at Hamilton, where he remained a conspicuous and highly energetic presence on campus for the next five decades. He is the author of ""Economics and Man,"" a college textbook used nationally. Professor Wertimer is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Eleanor M.

The outlawed billboard portrays John, the only man in the picture, in a provocative half-naked pose being embraced by a female apostle, and the municipal advertising ethics committee decided that this ""made the imitation more offensive.""

Stephen J. Selk, an investigator with the United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, said that the presence of an open-flame heater near an acetylene production site could be a violation of federal fire-safety codes, and that if it were not, the rules might need to be rewritten.

Last week the promoters Jammins and Apollo Entertainment, and the labels VP, Greensleeves and Jet Star pledged to stop promoting existing songs and albums with lyrics that the advocates find offensive, and have promised not to produce any new albums with such lyrics. In return, gay groups including OutRage! and the Black Gay Men's Advisory Group have agreed to suspend their Stop Murder Music campaign, which has successfully lobbied many concert halls in Europe to drop some reggae acts. The advocates have also suspended a campaign to have previously produced albums that contain antigay lyrics withdrawn from the market. HEATHER TIMMONS",2005-02-07T05:00:00+0000

He was a Professor Emeritus and former Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at SUNY Health Science Center, Director of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Kings County Hospital and former Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Brookdale Medical Center, all of Brooklyn. The only twice elected President of the Alumni Association-College of Medicine, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, he was a recipient of the Frank L. Babbott Memorial Award for Excellence in Teaching, a Diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery and Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, and the author of numerous publications on plastic and reconstructive surgery. Born on the fourth of July in 1922, Leon was a 1942 graduate of Rutgers University. He left medical school in 1943 to enter the U.S. Navy, and was skipper (Lt. J.G., USN) of an LCT in the Pacific theatre during WWII. He was present at the invasions of Okinawa and Iwo Jima and was a witness to the raising of the US flag on Mt. Surabachi. Returning to medical school after the War, Leon earned a medical degree at Long Island College Hospital (now SUNY Medical School) in 1949, and a graduate degree in history from New York University in 1980. Leon's life was dedicated to the practice of plastic surgery, imparting his knowledge and modesty to his beloved medical residents, and to enhancing the quality of life for his patients. An avid cyclist and accomplished pianist, from Chopin to the golden oldies, Leon's enthusiastic ""bravos"" at the opera and ballet will be missed. His enthusiasm, curiosity and appetite for life made him an interesting and great conversationalist and enabled him to bear the infirmities of aging with dignity, courage and humor. Many thanks to his doctors, whose support and affection for him was unflagging, to his nurses Elaine, Brigid and Eileen, who cared for him with professionalism and love and to loving and faithful Virginia and Dora. Eternal gratitude to his friends who gave care, love and compassion. Leon is survived by his beloved wife Josephine L.

Vodafone Japan said that Mr. Tsuda would become chairman and would share management responsibility with Mr. Morrow. The appointment of Mr. Morrow, above, who is currently chief executive of Vodafone Britain, comes as Vodafone struggles to turn around its operation in Japan. Vodafone lost 58,700 subscribers in January, falling further behind DoCoMo, the market leader, and KDDI, the No. 2 company, in the highly competitive Japanese mobile phone market. Vodafone has failed to match the feature-laden phones offered by its rivals. Mr. Morrow was formerly president of Japan Telecom, the fixed-line carrier that Vodafone sold two years ago.

us,A Transcontinental Challenge,"A TRANSCONTINENTAL CHALLENGE -- The troubled carrier Independence Air said yesterday that it would start low-fare nonstop flights to the West Coast this spring, plunging into transcontinental routes, the most fiercely competitive market in the domestic airline industry. Independence said that it would begin flying between its hub at Washington Dulles International Airport and San Diego on April 4 and to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and San Jose, Calif., on May 1, using new 132-passenger Airbus A319 aircraft. The low-fare carrier, which began independent service in November 2003 after operating as a regional jet service for United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, has been struggling financially. Last month, its load factor -- the average percentage of seats sold on each flight -- was 45.7 percent, well below the average of 70 percent to 80 percent of competitors. Transcontinental flights have ""always been part of the plan for Independence Air,"" said Rick DeLisi, a spokesman. He said the strategy was to promote low-fare transcontinental flights to passengers connecting to Dulles from airports on the East Coast. Another low-fare carrier, America West, recently abandoned the transcontinental flights that it introduced in 2003, citing intense price-cutting by competitors. Since it dropped out of that market, America West said, some of its competitors' transcontinental fares have gone up by as much as 130 percent. It is not clear if Independence Air's plans will set off more fare wars.",2005-02-08T05:00:00+0000

The change is possible because of Intel's move over the last few years to more advanced manufacturing processes that permit more circuitry to be squeezed into a given area. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said last year that by 2006 about half the company's chips will be based on the dual-core design, and last summer it scrapped plans for a faster Pentium 4 chip in favor of the new design.

Her books and articles on Abraham Lincoln, emancipation, and Reconstruction had a profound impact on historical scholarship and became classics that are read by historians in the twenty-first century. She had also resided many years in Bethel, CT. Born in Hoquim, Washington, on September 24, 1909, LaWanda Fenlason earned her B.A. at the University of Oregon in 1931, a masters from Smith College in 1934, and her Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1941. At Smith, she studied with Merle Curti, the pioneering social historian whose commitment to social justice deeply influenced her. Curti became a lifelong friend. In 1940, Cox came to New York City, where her husband, John Cox, accepted a teaching position at City College and she a position at Hunter College. Except for a brief stint at Goucher College in Baltimore (1944-46), she was a member of the history faculty at Hunter and the City University of New York's Graduate Center until her retirement in 1971. She was a legendary teacher at Hunter, influencing two generations of students there. As a doctoral student at Berkeley, Cox studied with John Schuster Taylor, the economist who collaborated with the great documentary photographer Dorthea Lang to study of the plight of the impoverished agricultural workers who migrated to California to escape the ravages of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. Taking up Taylor's challenge, Cox completed a pioneering study of agricultural labor in the United States as her dissertation. Cox's work on agricultural labor led her to study the plight of former slaves in the post-Civil War South and, ultimately, Reconstruction policy and politics. Her scholarly writing dramatically revised understanding of Reconstruction. Civil rights was the era's defining issue, she demonstrated, not merely a product of Republican vindictiveness toward the South or a smoke screen to obscure the party's efforts to advance the interests of big business. The most complete and eloquent statement of her position came in Politics, Principle, and Prejudice, 1865-1866: Dilemma of Reconstruction America, which was published in 1963 by the Free Press and won the American Historical Association's John H. Dunning Prize. Subsequent work, including Reconstruction, the Negro, and the New South, published by Harper & Row in 1971, extended the argument to emphasize the farreaching--if hotly contested--changes Reconstruction era civil rights policy effected. Cox was also a highly influential Lincoln scholar. In Lincoln and Black Freedom, which appeared in 1981, she boldly challenged the reigning scholarly consensus that held that Lincoln was, at best, a reluctant emancipator. Cox argued that Lincoln's circumspect and indirect style of leadership--while highly effective in advancing the cause of black freedom--had misled historians about his commitment to emancipation and critical role in achieving it. While acknowledging the role African Americans themselves played in ending slavery, her characteristically meticulous research and careful reading of the sources made a compelling case for Lincoln's pivotal role in emancipation and commitment to civil rights for the former slaves. Throughout the 1980s, Cox remained an active scholar, conducting research and publishing essays that examined the demise of Reconstruction and the nation's failure to achieve substantive freedom for former slaves. She also conceived and guided the Symposium on Emancipation and Its Aftermath, which met annually in New York City from 1979 to 1989. A lively forum, it offered an opportunity for scholars to present workin-progress and served as an incubator for a number of important studies that appeared in the 1980s and 1990s. Failing vision brought an end to Cox's historical research and writing in 1989. Nevertheless, in a career that spanned almost fifty years, she left an indelible imprint on the field of Reconstruction, Lincoln studies, and American history more generally. While some of her contemporaries published more, few produced scholarship that equaled hers in its originality, depth of research, analytical power, and enduring significance. Few historians of any generation can equal the crisp lucidity of her writing and analysis. And perhaps no historian was as generous in nurturing the work of young scholars. She was preceded in death by her husband, John Cox, and is survived by her niece, Joan Mason of Los Angeles.

On the first Monday of the February sweeps period, CBS won the night in total viewers and among adults 18 to 49. And indeed, ""CSI: Miami"" brought in the most viewers of all the prime-time offerings. During its fall run, ""CSI: Miami"" regularly attracted more than 20 million viewers for its original episodes, but the audience for Monday's show, in which Horatio Caine (David Caruso) and the gang tracked down counterfeiters in one case and a murderous swinger in another, drew an estimated 18.44 million. During the same hour, ABC's ""Supernanny"" continued its run as a solid new performer, bringing in an estimated 11.4 million viewers. And also in the 10 p.m. period, NBC's ""Medium,"" the show that poses the biggest challenge to ""CSI: Miami"" because it, too, is a crime series, drew an audience estimated at 14.01 million.

Ramseur, a retired partner of the Firm. Tom Ramseur was a member of White & Case for 30 years until his retirement in 1986. He was an outstanding lawyer in the Firm's corporate department, renowned for his dedication to his clients. For a generation of White & Case lawyers who followed him, Tom was the embodiment of a mentor. He sought out young partners and associates, took an abiding interest in their work and careers, and imparted wisdom and knowledge about the law, serving clients and the community of lawyers who comprise this firm. Today, the ranks of White & Case are filled with those who recall affectionately the lessons, values and friendship he extended so generously to others at every rank and position. Clients regarded Tom as a trusted adviser intensely devoted to them. Practicing in an era of generalists, Tom epitomized the ""renaissance"" corporate lawyer, handling all manner of complex financial transactions: tender offers, refinancings, mergers and acquisitions, all with equal authority. For three years in the late-1960s, Tom headed the White & Case office in Paris. In leading the Firm's original non-US office, he was one of those who laid the foundation for what would become White & Case's global mission. Tom Ramseur also made a lasting mark beyond his profession. He served his nation with valor as an Army lieutenant in World War II, performing the perilous duty of target-spotting in light aircraft behind enemy lines to guide artillery strikes against enemy positions. He was an accomplished steeplechaser, having ridden at age sixteen in the Maryland Hunt Cup, the most venerable of American timber races. He excelled as a student at The Hill School, Princeton University and the Columbia University School of Law. For all his accomplishments, Tom Ramseur is best remembered at White & Case for his generous and genial spirit and his unwavering devotion to his colleagues. The values and principles he imbued will remain part of the fabric of White & Case for years to come.

They either canoed, or they walked. If they canoed, they might be able to land at Hanakapi'ai or Kalalau Beaches, two of the spots on the steep Na Pali Coast where white sand and blue water actually meet. But if the water gods were restless, as they often are, far more distance might need to be covered before a safe harbor could be reached. Thus, over generations, the ancients carved out an astonishing 11-mile-long ribbon of red dirt called the Kalalau Trail.",2005-02-11T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings; CAROLYN DORFMAN DANCE COMPANY,"Manhattan dance fans are notorious for their lack of curiosity about what goes on west of the Hudson River. But choreographers are working there, too, and sometimes that distance from the hectic world of New York dance can be a very healthy thing. Carolyn Dorfman, who is based in Union, N. J., seems to have benefited from the distance, for her work glows with the quiet authority of someone who burrows comfortably into material that interests her, whether fashionable or not. Trained at the University of Michigan and the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, Ms. Dorfman does a lot of teaching, some of it as a guest at the Limon Institute in Manhattan. She has also worked to develop dance in New Jersey institutions. She is probably best known these days for dances that explore Jewish lives and legacies. A humanist, she offers her audiences the dance equivalent of a cherished book of family photographs. There will be other kinds of pieces on the program presented by the 23-year-old Carolyn Dorfman Dance Company this weekend, one of them by Aidan Treays, a guest choreographer from England. But Ms. Dorfman's new ""Odisea"" will chronicle the journey of 23 Jews fleeing persecution in mid-17th century Brazil for the unfamiliar world of New Amsterdam (New York City). Her 2002 ""Echad (One)"" examines ideas about humanity and individuality in the light of writings on pre-biblical life, the Jewish liturgy and evolving theology and philosophy. The dancers' bodies, above, will very likely look sculptured, as a group forming a flow of images that directly communicate emotions like hope, resignation, uncertainty and joy with the chewy simplicity of good bread. (Tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 2 p.m. , the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, west of Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 65+.)

us,The Listings; BRIAN STOKES MITCHELL,"With his heroic baritone and dashing stage presence, Brian Stokes Mitchell has been called Broadway's last leading man in the tradition of Alfred Drake and John Raitt. His performances in the revivals of ""Kiss Me Kate"" and ""Man of La Mancha,"" and in City Center's Encores series (""Do Re Mi""), as well as assorted Gershwin tributes, have lent the swashbuckling archetype a modern slant. Glinting through all the heavy lifting are an innate ebullience, a sense of humor and a strain of tenderness. In ""Love/Life,"" his cabaret debut at Feinstein's at the Regency, traditional Broadway chest-beating is kept to a minimum, except in a commanding version of ""The Impossible Dream"" at the end of the show that rolls through the club like a clap of thunder echoing in the mountains. Backed by a quartet whose reed player, Lou Marini, adds moody urban brush strokes to the pop-jazz arrangements, Mr. Mitchell, above, explores his jazzier inclinations. The singer adapts an Al Jarreau-influenced vocal playfulness into his intense character-driven performances, forging his own style of Broadway jazz singing with improvisatory fills. Slipping in and out of various characters, he becomes a pimp (an ominous version of Cole Porter's ""Love for Sale""), a child (Joe Raposo's ""Bein' Green"") and a joyful new father (Maury Yeston's ""New Words""). His club appearance, which continues through Feb. 19, just might be the cabaret debut of the decade. (Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212)339-4095. Cover: $60; $40 minimum at the early shows, $30 at the late shows.)

All are quite aware that sports today is a global industry reflecting the pressures and politics of contemporary life. And their art ranges from spoof to deadly serious as they explore its impact on participants, fans and the world at large. The competitive hustle of sports today is amusingly sent up by Lee Walton, a conceptual artist, who pits himself against the basketball superstar Shaquille O'Neal. For every free throw attempted by Shaq in the course of the current N.B.A. season, Mr. Walton tries one himself -- at a special basketball hoop set up in the gallery -- hoping to beat Shaq's percentage. The results are carried on Mr. Walton's Web site (viewable in the gallery). Basketball is also the topic in ""He Got Game,"" above, a fool-the-eye photograph by the performance artist Robin Rhode. Having made a crude chalk drawing of a basketball hoop on the flat pavement, he accomplishes a slam dunk  la Michael Jordan while lying down; that is, he's arranged himself on the pavement next to the drawing so that it seems he's putting the ball right through the hoop. The most chilling of the entries is ""Black September,"" a video made by the Swiss-born artist Christoph Draeger. A reconstruction of the hostage-holding and murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich by Palestinian terrorists, it focuses on a dorm room where the action took place, interspersed with real cuts from the television reportage. ""Upon Further Review"" (a title taken from a football referee's mandate to reconsider a controversial call after watching its instant replay on television) makes a refreshing change from the rah rah of much sports depiction.

He cited a long-dormant 1954 provision and free services provided by the West. In a letter to members this week, Mr. Petrie wrote, ""Between the misdirected dues and the free help, we are subsidizing W.G.A. East to the tune of more than $1 million a year."" Outraged, the East Coast union rejected the demand and this week took its complaints public. ""It's extortion,"" said Warren Leight, the East Coast guild vice president. ""And you don't negotiate with extortionists."" The matter will be mediated by April 10 and, if no resolution is reached, will proceed to more formal arbitration.

Dr. Kraker was a brilliant, creative Psychologist whose informal style and biting sense of humor earned her a devout following among her clients, many of whom traveled great distances to conduct their sessions with her in the hospital during her long illness. A keeper of professional confidences, the extent of good work she did will never fully be known, except by those whose lives she touched. She will be missed more than words can say by her son Daniel, her daughter Susan, and friends and clients whose lives she transformed. A private service for family and friends was held on February 5, but condolences can be sent to Daniel at ostapledon@ yahoo.com and Susan at piware@pacbell.net",2005-02-13T05:00:00+0000

us,THE TRENTON GAS PARTY?,"As New Jersey residents and elected officials brace themselves for an ugly budget season of deficits, spending cuts and tax increases, another problem is looming: growing pressure to raise its gasoline tax this year. The Transportation Trust Fund, which uses the state's 14.5 cent-per-gallon gas tax to build and maintain New Jersey's overloaded system of roads, bridges and rail lines, is expected to run out of money in June 2006. During the past five years, a succession of governors and legislative leaders from both parties have considered -- and scuttled -- plans to replenish the fund either by increasing the gas tax or by devoting revenue from other parts of the budget. But with the fund teetering toward insolvency, state officials must find a solution or risk losing $1 billion in federal transportation aid that is allocated to match state contributions. All those years of deferring the problem mean that by next year, New Jersey drivers could face sticker shock at the gas pump: as much as a 15-cent-per-gallon increase proposed by some transportation experts and commuters groups.

For nearly 40 years, he was a dealer in American and Old Master paintings, having served as president of the Old Master Division of M. Knoedler & Co. in New York from January 1971-February 1985 where he produced many important exhibitions. Born in the Bronx, he combined his love of art and sports since childhood. He graduated from Evander Childs High School, worked as a cartoonist for Walt Disney in California, drew cartoons for the Long Island Daily Advocate, and in 1942 became the sports editor of the Northside News. He served as a cryptographer in the U.S. Army, later returning to New York. He joined Art Flynn Associates, a public relations firm, where he handled clients including the New York Giants and became the 18-year-old Willy Mays' legal guardian. Later, he did public relations for ABC-TV's ""Wednesday Night Fights."" In 1966, he returned to his primary interest in the fine arts; in 1967 he formed a partnership with the Boston art dealer Warren Adelson. It was from that time that Jack Tanzer went on to establish an exceptional career in the art world commencing with his first important client and subsequent personal friend, Walter P. Chrysler, Jr., whose great and varied art collection later became the core of the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Va. Tanzer later gave his collection of Pre-Columbian art and his Warhol portrait to that institution. He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Audrey; his daughter, Tara; son, Edward; two grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and a sister, Lilian Campo. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to New York City Division of the American Cancer Society, 19 W. 56th Street, NY, NY 10019.",2005-02-13T05:00:00+0000

For one thing, it's an engaging piece of writing. For another, the questions Jacobs asks get at issues that authors, publishers and readers often put to us about our choice of reviewers. Jacobs humorously proposes that reviewers ""be vetted like candidates for a Homeland Security post."" As it happens, the Book Review does take precautions before making assignments. Has the reviewer written previously about the author -- or vice versa? Have the two had personal or professional dealings? Occasionally we get burned, but in most cases reviewers are forthright about volunteering information they suspect may be compromising. One writer recently turned us down because she'd lunched with the author once, and he had picked up the tab. Another passed because she feared her friendship with the editor who acquired a particular book might cloud her judgment. As is clear from Jacobs's essay, he and the reviewer, Joe Queenan, had no prior history. Queenan simply disliked Jacobs's book, which was his prerogative; strong reactions are the prerogative of every reviewer who writes for us.",2005-02-13T05:00:00+0000

(Her books are No. 2 in a combined ranking on the children's series list, which appears this week on Page 18.) Brashares's novels are about four close friends who negotiate the final years of high school with the help of some slightly magical jeans. (What's magical about them? They fit each of the girls, who have different body sizes, perfectly.) The third novel in this series, ""Girls in Pants,"" is just out. It includes a list of the rules the girls have concocted to govern the use of their empowering pants, and it's a list that captures a bit of Brashares's crisp comic tone. Rule No. 2 reads: ""You must never double-cuff the Pants. It's tacky. There will never be a time when this will not be tacky."" Yet these books don't shy away from weightier issues, among them sex. Here is Rule No. 4: ""You must never let a boy take off the Pants (although you may take them off yourself in his presence)."" Brashares, who worked in publishing before writing her first book, is the product of a pretty good education: she attended the Sidwell Friends School in Washington and was a philosophy major at Barnard.

In a sport devoted to selling sneakers, the dunk is a marketing tour de force, the money shot at the end of every worthy basketball sequence.

Next weekend in Denver, the cultural moment that is the N.B.A. All-Star Game will take place, an event set annually amid a weekend of concerts, lavish parties and showy displays of fashion. On such a big stage (and with defensive standards momentarily relaxed), the game itself is sure to be a veritable dunkathon, a string of self-satisfied throw-downs by the league's biggest stars.

It's a fresh and lively perspective.""

He briefly served as director of development for Paramount in the early 1990's. Reached by phone, Ms. Schindler said: ""Our mandate is to create our own entity, unlike New York offices have been in the past. We're going to make films, not just develop them.""

Net income climbed to $103 million, or 21 cents a share, in the period that ended Jan. 31, from $71 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue at the company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., rose less than 1 percent, to $1.66 billion, from $1.64 billion. The chief executive, Edward W. Barnholt, relied on the company's life sciences and chemical analysis businesses to help Agilent post its sixth consecutive period of net income after seven quarterly losses. Agilent's chip-making clients pared orders last year to work off inventory gluts, Mr. Barnholt said in December. Agilent said it expected second-quarter revenue of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and operating profit, or earnings before interest and taxes, of 18 cents to 23 cents a share. Excluding some costs, first-quarter profit would have been 20 cents a share, topping 19 cents, the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Shares of Agilent rose 30 cents, to $24.02. Mr. Barnholt, who oversaw Agilent's spinoff from the Hewlett-Packard Company in 1999 and 2000, will retire March 1. William P.

With good reason, apparently: more than a third believe it is either ""somewhat"" or ""quite"" common for business travelers to submit expense accounts with ""one or more completely false or bogus charges."" But most road warriors also disapprove of such fraud. Those in the United States expressed the strongest support (77 percent) for careful audits of expense reports and receipts, while 72 percent in Britain agreed, as did 70 percent in Germany and 64 percent in France. For all their stepped-up vigilance, companies do seem to be loosening up on restrictions against traveling in style. In a survey conducted by the National Business Travel Association and the Travel Industry Association of America, the proportion of corporate travelers who reported their employers restricted the class they could travel on fell to 50 percent last year from 56 percent in 2002.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   WOLF, HENRY","WOLF--Henry. The Trustees, faculty, staff, and students of New School University and Parsons School of Design express their deep sadness at the sudden loss of Henry Wolf. An influential designer, photographer, and art director, Henry Wolf was among the shapers of twentieth century publication design. He had a long and rich association with Parsons, first as a beloved teacher and mentor in the Communication Design Department, and later as a member of the Parsons Board of Governors from 1998 to 2001. In 1996, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University for his outstanding contributions to the field of design, and in 1998 Parsons proudly celebrated his life and work with a retrospective exhibition and lecture series. Henry Wolf was also a philanthropist whose generosity was guided by a passionate interest in the School's past and future. He established a scholarship program that allowed some of the most talented students the privilege of a Parsons education. In every avenue of his engagement with Parsons, he maintained a close interest in the life of students and the academic standards for programs. This kind of broad and deep history with an institution is rare, and Henry Wolf's high standards and determined ideals will continue to have profound influence at Parsons and throughout New School University. We convey our heartfelt condolences to his sister Joan Slawson.

Born in 1925 in Vienna, Henry studied art in Austria and France, before arriving in the United States in 1941. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he returned to New York City where he became the art director of Esquire Magazine in 1952. In 1958, he left Esquire to succeed Alexey Brodovitch as the art director of Harper's Bazaar. Henry was also the art director of Show Magazine and at McCann-Erickson. In 1958 he became Executive Vice President/Creative Director of The Trahey/ Wolf Agency. From 1971 until now Henry worked as a designer and photographer. He taught at Cooper Union, The School of Visual Arts, and Parsons School of Design. During the course of a long and illustrious career, Henry was the recipient of awards from The Society of Illustrators, The Art Directors Club of New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Los Angeles, as well as the recipient of medals from The AIGA, and The Society of Publications. In 1980, Henry was inducted into The Art Directors Hall of Fame, and into The Royal Society of Arts. Henry is survived by his sister, Joan Slawson, of Manhattan. Throughout a long life, Henry was steadfast in his love of girls, cars, painting and photography, and in his distaste for computers and cell phones. We will miss him very much.

Judge Eugene R. Wedoff will hear the association's motion on Friday. Last week, United said that it would suspend nonqualified payments to about 3,000 retired pilots. The payments are in addition to the pilots' basic pension benefits. In some cases, the nonqualified benefits are as much as one-third of a pilot's retirement compensation. The airline's move last week came after the Pension Guaranty Benefit Corporation said it would seize control of the pension plan for United's pilots, rather than allow the airline to terminate the plan. United, which filed for bankruptcy in December 2002, wants to terminate four employee pension plans and replace them with 401(k)-style retirement programs, a move that would save millions of dollars annually.

The dead, one identified as a leader in the Sinaloa-based drug cartel and the others as mostly low-level gang members, were found in three different places along an 80-mile stretch of highway between the state capital, Culiacn, and the beach resort of Mazatln. ""We are assuming this was a shootout between gangs,"" the Sinaloa attorney general, Luis Antonio Crdenas, told reporters. The killings appeared to mark an expansion of a war between the Sinaloa cartel, led by the reputed drug lord Joaqun (El Chapo) Guzmn Loera in alliance with Ismael (El Mayo) Zambada and Mexico's Gulf and Tijuana drug cartels. Until now, most of the killings have taken place along the Mexico-Texas border. James C. McKinley Jr. (NYT)",2005-02-17T05:00:00+0000

On Jan. 14, Mr. Soo had been brought to the county jail, where he confronted guards, banged his head and bit himself, officials said.

On Jan. 20, he had tried to hang himself with material from his jail mattress, Mr. Maer said. Mr. Soo was later sent to Ann Klein Forensic hospital for evaluation but discharged after 19 days, and sent back to the county jail, where he died less than a week later. A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that Mr. Soo had been arrested for overstaying his tourist visa, but was also a suspect in a series of sexual assaults in South Korea.

us,The Listings; 'SHOCKHEADED PETER',"Sucking your thumb may not seem like such a terrible offense. But in ""Shockheaded Peter,"" the gloriously ghoulish pocket musical that has returned to New York after a short -- but much talked-about -- run in 1999, the punishment (always death) never really fits the crime (meanness, not eating your soup). So when Conrad, played by a puppet, disobeyed his mother, a sinister man with big scissors paid him a visit and chopped his thumbs off. Performed on a booby-trapped doll's house of a set, the slyly ironic show, which has the highest body count of any production in the theater district, is filled with the kind of gothic tales that will delight kids while scaring them witless. A broken-down master of ceremonies (played by Julian Bleach) from the Boris Karloff finishing school of charm narrates the imaginative musical, introducing himself with typical understatement: ""I am the greatest actooor who ever existed,"" he bellows. The slyly self-parodic show, which has already gained a cult following in London, is based on the sing-songy verse of the 19th-century doctor Henrich Hoffman, an influence on other writers of twisted tales for kids like Edward Gorey and Roald Dahl. This stylish adaptation -- which features the seductive songs of the Tiger Lillies, whose grimacing falsetto-voiced front man Martyn Jacques (above right with Mr. Bleach) plays a mournful accordion -- provides an antidote to the bland and benign family-friendly entertainments on Broadway that are about as fun as eating your spinach. Which, by the way, is highly recommended for children looking to make it to adulthood.

But this concert will probably attract a roomful of fans hoping to hear songs by his other band, Sun Kil Moon, which released a gorgeous debut CD in 2003 called, ""Ghosts of the Great Highway"" (Jetset). It might be the best album of Mr. Kozelek's career: a calm but fierce collection of slow-building Neil-Young-ish ballads, populated with stubborn fighters and stubborner lovers. These mysterious songs grow bigger and sadder the more you listen to them, thanks partly to the mesmerizing guitar figures lovingly wrapped around his intonations. One of the best songs, a dead-boxer ode called ""Salvador Sanchez,"" appears twice: first loud and frayed, then, at the end, in a hushed acoustic version under the title ""Pancho Villa."" At this President's Day concert, expect Mr. Kozelek to respond to all the requests and shouted praise and unsolicited commentary with mumbled insults: the last time he visited the Bowery Ballroom, he offered to show one fan the inside of his guitar, although it sounded like an offer likely to leave neither the fan nor the guitar intact.

What did register was a dark-haired, slightly built but sinewy male who tore through the dance with spendthrift abandon and a dazzling technique. The choreographer might have been Mark Dendy. The wildness of the solo rules out the cooler art of John Jasperse and Ben Munisteri, with whom Mr. Keigwin has also performed. Then came his eerie portrayal of a vulpine Nijinsky in Mr. Dendy's ""Dream Analysis,"" and the dance, yearning and pyrotechnical, that he created and performed in Mr. Dendy's ""I'm Going to My Room to Be Cool Now, and I Don't Want to Be Disturbed."" Today, Mr. Keigwin and his choreography seem to be everywhere, in programs by Keigwin + Company and in his witty burlesque-style Keigwin Kabaret. So it is no surprise that he is opening the five-week 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Project festival at the Duke on 42nd Street. Mr. Keigwin injects a revivifying dose of blithe high spirits into an often rather solemn art. His festival program includes the New York premiere of ""Natural Selection"" (above with Mr. Keigwin and Nicole Wolcott) and his signature ""Mattress Suite,"" a duet whose blend of wry humor and the immense sadness of dashed hope is typical of Mr. Keigwin's humane approach to dance.

There are other more fantastic elements, too, like the giant ears of corn and the many tire swings hanging from high branches in ""Imperial Trees"" (above). There is something Medieval and a little fanatical about Mr. Spangler's work, as though its author were a backwoods prophet carving his own Book of Revelations. Drawing closer, you search for narrative clues about what has caused these disastrous scenarios, but few if any are forthcoming. What you do discover are many more details and a more immediate sense of the sculptor's hand. Mr. Spangler is not a fussy finisher; he leaves things a bit rough and this creates a magical tension between the raw material and the epic fantasy.

Channel 4 said that its program was a serious scientific investigation of what happens inside the brain during an exorcism, and cited a new field of research called neurotheology, which examines brain activity during religious experiences. The exorcism is to be performed by a nondenominational minister with a man he has been working with for some years, and the station said the man had been cleared by two psychologists. But the Bishop of Monmouth, a spokesman for the Episcopal Church in Britain, said: ""This is not the kind of ministry that should be done on TV. Anglican rules specify that it should take place with the minimum publicity. In these cases you are often dealing with very vulnerable and disturbed people who need to be in a safe environment.

He was identified after the police traced a fingerprint to an arrest for possession of marijuana, the only arrest on his record. Investigators could not say whether Mr. Brazell had been reported missing before the discovery of the remains, or how long they had been at the tracks. Another bag, containing tools, drill bits and what appeared to be blood, was found near the remains, investigators said, but it was unclear whether the two discoveries were connected. Neighbors at Mr. Brazell's apartment building said that he worked at a clothing store in Manhattan and lived with his mother and stepfather. He was last seen by his family on Monday, a neighbor said.

Throughout the natural world, they say, there is evidence of deliberate design. Is it not reasonable, then, to infer the existence of an intelligent designer? To evade the charge that intelligent design is a religious theory -- creationism dressed up as science -- its advocates make no explicit claims about who or what this designer might be.

In the 1974 classic, which presented a pseudo-intellectual agenda of sexual liberation that was part Simone de Beauvoir, part Heidi Fleiss, Emmanuelle explored interests as diverse as squash, skinny-dipping and under-age lesbianism and posed searing questions like, Does it count with a girl? Thirty years later, her spirited romps have aged about as well as Beta tapes. Her come-hither sense of bourgeois style, however, has stood the test of time. In a season filled with innuendo and flirty femininity, her garden-party dresses, A-line skirts and sheer halter tops feel remarkably up to date. Derek Lam's lychee prints are parfait for a Bangkok soiree; ditto for Proenza Schouler's palm-frond chemises and flowing gowns with peekaboo bras. But Veronique Branquinho truly captures the sensuous essence with slinky dresses, loose knits, fringed wraps and gold maillots. Branquinho's show was bookended by a tableau of long-haired girls on rattan peacock chairs (above), which our heroine favored for lounging in various stages of undress.

The problems these self-styled ""foxymorons"" have with diction (""I look a hundred bucks!"" or ""She's the bain-marie of my existence!"") are compounded by their ripped-from-the-tabloids looks, which run from 1980's Coogi sweaters and poodle perms (on Kath) to midriff-baring contempo flimsy (on Kim). As the corpulent Kim explains, in an accent that could cut through steel (pronounced ""stoil""): ""Mum likes to team with the theme -- she's classic, like Papilloma Picasso, with a perm. I have a foxier figure, like Rachel Hunter, so I love bumster jeans, diamante-studded G-strings and clacky moooles.""

Born in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Dr. Goudsmit earned his M.D, there in 1931. In 1933 he and his wife Hellen came to the US, where each earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry at Cornell Medical College (1936). His training in Internal Medicine was at the Mayo Clinic. Beginning in 1939 he was Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania; and during WWII he was a medical officer on Iwo Jima with the Army Air Corps. He practiced medicine in Youngstown, OH, taught at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School, and served as the first president of the Ohio chapter of the American Society of Internal Medicine. His vision and leadership led to the founding of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 1964 (for which he was honored last June). In the late '60's he left private practice to assume a role as Oncologist at the Dearborn VA Hospital. Later he became Chief of Surgical Oncology at the Minneapolis VA Hospital. At age 70, Noldus enrolled in Divinity School. For a time he was Associate Minister at the First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis. He then combined his love of medicine and theology by becoming a hospital chaplain. He was a wonderful pianist, an avid hiker, an active cyclist and cross-country skier.

""I think one cuff is beautiful, but two make twice the statement,"" says Wyatt in her honeyed drawl. The longtime couture client would almost be derelict not to own a pair. Verdura's founder, Duke Fulco di Verdura, designed the originals in 1936 for Coco Chanel, who loved them so much that she rarely removed them. Like Chanel, Wyatt wears hers day and night. ""They look as wonderful with a black cashmere sweater and trousers as they do with a white gown or cocktail dress,"" Wyatt says.The Maltese crosses on her bracelets are detachable, so she can wear the gold, pearl and coral ones either on the cocholong cuffs shown here (cocholong is a white stone exclusive to Russia) or on a pair she owns in carnelian. ""At the end of the day I'm just a very practical girl. I take off the Maltese centers with a little screwdriver that came with the cuffs. In the summer I usually wear the white pair. In winter, the coral and gold on the carnelian is a knockout.""Verdura fits each cuff (prices start at $12,000) to its owner's wrist and lets her decide where on the wrist she'd like to wear it. ""I like mine to be a bit looser,"" Wyatt says, ""so I can wear them under a sweater."" The famously svelte socialite adds with a chuckle, ""My waist size might change, but hopefully my wrists will stay the same."" SANDRA BALLENTINE",2005-02-20T05:00:00+0000

Granted, this was hot stuff back in 1964, when the mini was starting to revolutionize fashion, and decades before the little Brazilian stringy thingy became the norm. Carolina Herrera's boy-cut has pinup appeal, while Yohji Yamamoto's for Y-3 is more befitting the figure of the swimmer Jenny Thompson.

Of all her pieces, which have names like Kept Woman and the Heiress, Lane's best-seller is her cashmere jersey panties, which she was prompted to design after reading that Coco Chanel was the first designer to use cashmere wool jersey for outerwear (it was considered suitable only for undergarments at the time). Cut from a knit that's made exclusively for her by Loro Piana, Lane's whisper-soft briefs, which range from $78 to $135, come in a thong, a boy short and what she calls ""the big-girl panty.""

The novel, about a Midwestern girl's experiences at an elite East Coast boarding school, makes its first appearance this week at No. 11 on the hardcover fiction list. Sittenfeld, who is 29, says she wasn't prepared for the book's reception. ""I saw 'Prep' as an underdog book,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""There wasn't exactly a bidding war for it. My agent sent it to 15 publishers before Lee Boudreaux, an editor who was then at Random House, loved it and bought it."" There are a lot of reasons ""Prep"" is resonating with readers, says Daniel Menaker, Random House's executive editor in chief -- he cites the book's eye-catching cover, and the fact that the novel addresses timely and complicated class and race issues. ""But most important,"" he says, ""the book happens to be terrific."" After a first printing of 16,000 copies, there are now some 70,000 copies of ""Prep"" in print; Paramount recently bought the film rights. Sittenfeld's original title for her novel was ""Cipher,"" and she is now glad she was talked out of it. ""People thought it must be a murder mystery,"" she said. Before publication, she came up with a long list of other potential titles -- including ""Class Day"" and ""The Privilege Thief"" -- before settling on ""Prep.""

Then she noticed something weird -- among the listings for the dolls, she recalls, were ""all these pictures of babies."" Of course, these were not actual babies being auctioned. They were reborn dolls. ""Reborning"" is the name that has emerged for a curious process of altering and enhancing a baby doll to look and even to feel as much like a human baby as possible. Gernand decided she had to buy one. Once she got it, she decided she had to make one. Soon she started selling her reborn dolls through eBay as well as her own Web site. (Occasionally the dolls are sold at fairs and the like, but the market is mostly online.) Recently she listed a doll that she named Alexandra, and the highest of the 21 bids was for $510. ""This whole reborn-doll thing is like this secret society,"" Gernand says. ""People don't find it unless they stumble upon it.""",2005-02-20T05:00:00+0000

Even women who would never consider wearing a full skirt -- oh, no, no, no, moi? -- are surprised at how easy it is with Elbaz. That's the secret to Lanvin's rebirth: he's putthe chic back in French fashion and made clothes you can actually wear. Now there's a concept.

One such is Liesl Schillinger, who has written 16 reviews for us in the past year, on books ranging from a history of the chess queen to the new novel by Larry McMurtry and the latest manifesto by Ann Coulter. A voracious reader since childhood, Schillinger is the daughter of academics -- her father taught Russian, her mother taught journalism. ""I grew up in university towns in the Midwest, mostly West Lafayette, Ind. and Stillwater, Okla.,"" she wrote in an e-mail message. ""I had a reading list my mother drew up, from the time I was 5, a book a week. I never thought to question the list."" Her reading wasn't confined to English. At age 10, she began studying French alongside college students at Purdue, and later added Spanish, German, Italian and Russian. It was good training for fact checking at The New Yorker, the job she landed after she graduated from Yale in 1988. She has been at the magazine ever since -- she's now an arts editor there -- apart from a brief stint in Russia editing the English supplement of Moscow magazine. Schillinger went over in the spring of 1993 and stayed, she recalled, ""till the end of the summer, living in workers' apartments in a far-flung district on Moscow's eastern periphery, in the middle of a grove of apple trees"" -- digs as exotic in their way as the five-star establishment she writes about this week in ""Hotel Confidential"" (Page 23).

In 1996, he received the Christy Matthewson Award as Bucknell's outstanding male athlete. Tim was born October 23, 1974, in Santa Monica, CA, and attended the Greenwich, CT, public schools, graduating from Greenwich High School in 1992. He was a four year varsity letterman in swimming and won Connecticut All-State swimming honors in two events. He captained the Greenwich High water polo team and won Eastern Interscholastic and High School All America recognition.

The package laid out in the president's budget proposal touches on many of the right issues, but it is underfinanced and poorly conceived -- and dead on arrival in Congress, which has signaled its intent to ignore crucial provisions of Mr. Bush's proposal. The White House, which failed to push for adequate funds for its last big education initiative, the No Child Left Behind Act, has only itself to blame for failing to do the necessary preparation before unveiling this big idea. Nevertheless, Congress should understand what's at stake here. As school reform grinds to a halt in Washington, American students are falling further and further behind their peers in Asia and Europe, where universally accessible quality schools are producing highly skilled workers at a rate that far outstrips schools in the United States.",2005-02-23T05:00:00+0000

So as always when ""Idol"" is on, Monday night's Nielsen overnight ratings favored Fox in every key measure. Monday's show, in which the top 12 male performers sang before the judges, was the first ""Idol"" show this season that gave viewers a chance to vote; that constituency came from an estimated audience of 23.2 million. By separating the male and female contestants, above, during this semi-final round, the talent show has changed its structure to fix the voting irregularities that plagued last spring's installment, when some of the more talented contestants exited early. Tonight's results will show how well the fixes are working. CBS, usually the winner on Mondays, was No. 1 at both 9 and 10 p.m. in the Nielsen overnight ratings, with ""Two and a Half Men"" and a 90-minute ""CSI: Miami."" But on an ""Idol"" night, that was only enough for a second-place finish in total viewers and among 18-to-49-year-olds. KATE AURTHUR",2005-02-23T05:00:00+0000

The band leader, Andrea Volpe, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of a 19-year-old woman, also a member of the band, apparently on the belief that she personified the Virgin Mary, and her 16-year-old boyfriend. Mr. Volpe, who confessed to the crimes and led the police last year to the long-missing bodies, was also convicted for killing his 27-year-old girlfriend last year. Another band member, Pietro Guerrieri, received 16 years in prison for the 1998 killing, while a third man was acquitted. Ian Fisher (NYT)",2005-02-23T05:00:00+0000

Hevesi. The report analyzes Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposed budget for the year that begins in July. It said education financing is one of several issues that could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the city's budget. Gov. George E. Pataki had proposed that the city cover 40 percent of the extra school financing. The city insists the state should cover all of the additional costs. The state is appealing the court's ruling, which determined that the city needs an extra $5.6 billion a year, but left it to the Legislature to determine how to divide the costs.

us,"Arts, Briefly; Trouble for UPN Comedies","It's been a tough season for UPN's comedies. The network's sitcoms on Monday and Tuesday nights, geared toward an African-American audience, have sharply declined over all since last year, whether because Nielsen Media Research undercounts minority viewers -- a complaint that UPN and CBS have raised, and Nielsen announced this week it is trying to address -- or because the shows have simply become less popular. But what is undeniable is that two of them, ""All of Us"" and ""Eve,"" have been doing even worse in recent weeks because they are in direct competition with the Tuesday installment of ""American Idol."" This week's ""All of Us"" brought in about 2.3 million viewers, and ""Eve"" attracted about 2.2 million. Comparing those numbers to ""Idol"" in the same time period (28.10 million) is absurd, but the sitcoms' closest competition, WB's ""Gilmore Girls,"" more than doubled their ratings in both viewers and households. Because of the steamroller that is ""Idol,"" Fox won Tuesday's Nielsen race in all important measures by a wide margin. KATE AURTHUR",2005-02-24T05:00:00+0000

The move does not affect the corporate debt of each airline. Standard & Poor's airline analyst, Philip A. Baggaley, said that holders of aircraft debt could face difficulty demanding repayment if a terrorist attack occurred, if fuel prices spiked from their record levels or if the airlines were forced to shed their pension liabilities.

us,The Listings; SHANNON HUMMEL AND CORA,"I was startled, the first time I saw the choreography of Shannon Hummel, by how completely the dancers in her all-female company, CORA, seemed to own the pieces that they performed. And what they performed was often like a vivid, true short story, a mix, perhaps, of Eudora Welty and Elizabeth Bowen. Her pieces, whether solos or group dances, evoke whole small universes of emotions and relationships, both simple and complex. Ms. Hummel's new ""Elsewhere,"" which will be performed by CORA this weekend, addresses the dilemma caused by hope and its propensity for both sustaining and destroying. ""Elsewhere"" (featuring Julie Betts, above, with Anna Smith) might be a barren wasteland, a lush forest, an ocean or a desert, she has written. The piece itself delves ""into the lives we live or fail to live when we focus on what may happen rather than what is."" Ms. Hummel began her career performing with companies in Washington and Atlanta before receiving a degree in dance from James Madison University. She formed CORA in 1997 and has helped develop, and worked in, programs intended to bring dance to isolated, often rural communities where exposure to the arts is often limited. In her finely wrought dances, you seem to hear the voices of the anonymous women in those communities, and they are indistinguishable from the big-city voices of her dancers and their New York audiences.

And the Irish government wants to keep it that way. A new agency, Culture Ireland, will spend $2.6 million this year, with greater sums promised, to promote the national culture abroad by handing out grants and making sure the Emerald Isle is always on the map. ""This is an opportunity for Ireland to celebrate its many voices across many countries and continents, to lift up its own diaspora in that celebration,"" said the agency's chairman, Micheal O Suilleabhain, who is also a composer and academic. The agency's board includes poets and musicians alongside professional arts administrators, but it also has an ulterior purpose: helping trade bodies lure foreign investors to Ireland. The country's cultural exchange with China last year, when dozens of artists and performers visited each partner country, was soon followed by a huge trade mission, and several Irish businesses won lucrative Chinese contracts.

Yesterday, the board of the Teatro della Scala Foundation fired Carlo Fontana, the company's general manager for more than a decade, and named its current artistic director, Mauro Meli, in his place. The move prompted Milan's culture commissioner, Salvatore Carrubba, to resign in protest, and La Scala's labor unions have threatened new strikes after forcing cancellation of Tuesday's opening of a new production of Tchaikovsky's ""Queen of Spades."" The crisis, however, was not unexpected. Mr. Fontana had long been in conflict with Riccardo Muti, above, La Scala's all-powerful music director, over programming. He has also been blamed for the company's financial problems. Officials have estimated its current deficit at $2.6 million, but other reports put it much higher. Last week, board members said they hoped to reach agreement with Mr. Fontana on his early departure; when no agreement emerged yesterday, he was summarily dismissed.

It's hard to imagine a more appropriate work with which to break fresh ground than ""Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-Jesus"" by Oliver Messiaen (above), the remarkable French composer whose music, like the stained glass windows of a cathedral, reflects a deep Catholic faith through an often dazzling array of colors. Messiaen wrote the monumental ""Vingt Regards"" in 1944, reflecting a new interest in the piano spurred by his contact with Yvonne Loriod, a brilliant young pianist at the Paris Conservatory who would later become his wife. At once Catholic in its faith and catholic in its appeal, the two-hour work consists of 20 brief ""gazes"" of the infant Jesus, viewed from theological perspectives (the Father, the Cross, the Virgin) and mystical ones (time, the heights, the spirit of joy). It offers a glorious compendium of Messiaen's musical world: chords that pulse with an inner radiance, ecstatic emotions transcribed with the same fidelity as the famous birdsongs that pierce the music's fabric. Most of all there is a deeply sensual (and deeply French) feel for instrumental color. Tonight, the pianist Paul Kim, a specialist in Messiaen, will perform the work in its entirety. He is not widely known in New York, but his bio includes an impressive endorsement from Ms. Loriod herself, who purportedly praised his playing as ""perfect in every way.""

In the letters, written while Shelley was a student at Oxford, he pretends to be a clergyman as he elaborates on his theories of atheism, which became a tenet of his career as a rebel poet. In one letter he wrote, ""Christ never existed. The fall of man, the whole fabric indeed of superstition which it supports can no longer obtain the credit of Philosophers."" Shelley and Hogg were subsequently expelled from Oxford after distributing a pamphlet titled ""The Necessity of Atheism"" to bishops and heads of colleges. Mr. Jackson said, ""The owner, who was left the trunk of manuscripts by her next-door neighbors, had thought of selling them in a garage sale before contacting Christie's."" The letters are expected to fetch $38,200 to $57,300 when they go on sale June 8 in London as part of a sale of valuable printed books and manuscripts, which will also include a copy of Christopher Columbus's letter announcing his discovery of the New World, printed in 1494, and a copy of Galileo's ""Siderius Nuncius"" (1610), including the first account of astronomical discoveries made with the telescope.

For his first gallery show two years ago, he cut a gigantic ellipse out of the back wall of the Gavin Brown gallery, then on West 15th Street, and leaned it against an adjacent wall as if it were a monumental blank thought balloon. For his second show at Mr. Brown's gallery, now on Greenwich Street in the West Village, Mr. Fischer began in a more constructive mode, building a modest but life-size alpine cabin out of sourdough bread, using different kinds of loaves as cobblestone walls, half timbers and shingles, plus expanding foam, screws and a wood infrastructure. Set on a large patch of Oriental carpets, ""Bread House,"" above, was definitely startling. It inserted a slightly barbed bit of Old World sentimentality, wholesomeness and craft into the pristine confines of the art gallery; Heidi's grandfather lived here. But Mr. Fischer wasn't finished. Two weeks after the opening, with the focaccio shingles drying and curling away from their beams, he simply knocked off the entire roof and left it strewn about, like so much sawdust. He also added, as a bit of wildlife, four parakeets that, too young to fly, hop around the interior. The perky tribute to tradition has become a half-ruin in a crunchy desert, a monument to ephemeralness and artistic license, and a disruption of business-as-usual in the art world. After all, even though it is made of the staff of life, ""Bread House"" is, in the parlance of the 1960's, also made of money, as in ""dough"" or ""bread."" Two large inkjet paintings further contrast the Old and New Worlds with montaged images of a tough-looking street in Long Island City and a classic Swiss beer hall, replete with wood paneling, bulls-eye glass and a ceramic stove. The titles -- ""A Shovel and a Hole"" and ""A Novel and Its Novelist"" -- seem to sum up Mr. Fischer's basic approach, which is to get beneath the surface of things. Appropriately, tunnel-like networks of thick black lines edged in searing red burrow across both paintings.

Mr. Burroughs, the Beat Generation writer and a presence in Lawrence the last 16 years of his life, is the uncontested symbol of its bohemian and creative set. And Mr. Chamberlain, a product of the university's legendary basketball program, remains among the most towering figures in a sport that has obsessed and defined Lawrence for a century.

The reversal followed an appeal mounted by Michael Tucker, who directed the film with his wife, Petra Epperlein, and Andy Robbins, Palm's head of theatrical marketing, after the association rated ""Gunner Palace"" R for profanity in January. An appeals board composed of exhibitors and studio representatives voted 9 to 3 to overturn the decision after a presentation in which Mr. Tucker and Mr. Robbins argued that the profanity was not gratuitous in the film's wartime context and that teenagers approaching recruitment age should be allowed an unvarnished view of war's realities. Reached by telephone yesterday in Los Angeles, the two hailed the decision.

us,Inside the List,"JUICED: If you want to sell an addiction memoir these days, the conventional wisdom holds, you'd better be prepared to lay out the lurid details -- the more gruesome the better. (James Frey's book, ""A Million Little Pieces,"" published in 2003, may be the one to beat for a while. It opens with the author missing four front teeth, wanted in three states and covered with ""a colorful mixture of spit, snot, urine, vomit and blood."") Koren Zailckas has cannily taken the opposite tack. Her new memoir, ""Smashed: Story of a Drunken Girlhood,"" which enters the hardcover nonfiction list this week at No. 10, is so poised and elegiac that she comes off as the Norah Jones of her plastered generation. No crime sprees, strip club jobs or spooky detox centers here. ""Smashed"" goes down with a slow, genteel burn. Zailckas, who is 24 and grew up in one of Boston's middle-class suburbs, coolly explains how she began drinking at 14, had her stomach pumped a few years later, threw up a lot, lost her virginity while blacked out and finally got sober at 22. Not a pretty story, but not a Belushi-level meltdown, either. Zailckas's failure to flame out in a more spectacular fashion has bugged some critics. As Rebecca Traister put it recently in Salon: ""A reader could easily close the book and say, 'That was her big drunken girlhood? I got drunker than her! Where's my book deal?' "" Zailckas got her $150,000 book deal, I suspect, because she is often a terrific writer, and one who knows how to frighten parents. ""I haven't met a girl yet who hasn't been interested in drinking,"" she writes in her memoir. ""Every time I've seen a bottle emerge, girls have followed it the way children follow Browning's Pied Piper of Hamelin: with small feet pattering, wooden shoes clattering, little hands clapping and little tongues chattering.""",2005-02-27T05:00:00+0000

Although Edith disliked Lawrence for having, she thought, caricatured her brother Sir Osbert in the novel, as the gin took its effect on each of us, I boldly assured her that the offending book was not actually the work of Lawrence but of Truman Capote. The red-rimmed eyes atop the long Gothic face narrowed: ''Surely the dates are not right.'' ",2005-02-27T05:00:00+0000

And although Kerry emerged as the safer, consensus choice for president, it was Dean, alone among Democrats, who retained the personal loyalty of street-level activists and millionaire donors.

An audience of 2.01 million viewers watched Jay McCarroll, below, win the fashion design contest, beating both the favorite, Kara Saun, and the reviled villain of the show, Wendy Pepper. The judging was based on the three contestants' runway shows during New York's fashion week. Among the three, Ms. Pepper, the scheming dressmaker from Virginia, was abolished first by Heidi Klum, the host. ""You're out -- auf wiedersehen,"" said the deadpan Ms. Klum, using her standard elimination tagline. Mr. McCarroll will receive $100,000 to start his own fashion line, along with a spread in Elle magazine. The show began in December and became a word-of-mouth hit: the number of viewers who saw the finale was almost five times the number of those who watched its premiere. Whether there will be a second season of ""Project Runway"" is unclear: because of the expected split between Disney and Miramax, the show's producer, its renewal is still being negotiated, Mediaweek reported.
