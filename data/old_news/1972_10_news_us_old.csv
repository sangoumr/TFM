To someone like Marian Engel's nonheroine (antiheroine is too strong), disappointment comes not as an adversary but as a sour, helpful mother who was expected all along.

But most of the time they manage to be only frenetic, rather than funny.Rod Amateau, who was co-author of the book from which this picture was made, and served as the film's director, proceeded on the theory that speed, gags, explicit cracks and sex were sufficient to make life at ""Vista Vue Hospital"" hilarious. Unfortunately, the basically thin story line is overcomplicated by a plethora of plotting. And the film is not enhanced by the merely athletic performances.As the conniving hospital administrator. Peter Sellers blackmails his doctors and technicians into robbing patients blind, keeps a step ahead of a suspicious, hospital commissioner, dallies with willing nurses in linen closets and even steals from the Pepsi machine. But despite all the activity, Sellers gives the bland impression of simply walking through a pedestrian role.Rick Lenz is pleasantly confused as a young construction worker suddenly caught in this expensive, sterile trap. Jo Ann Pflug and Eve Bruce raucously compete for Sellers's favors, while Pat Morita, Paul Lambert and Harold Gould are among the men in white laboring for laughs.In one of the rare, inventive bits in an otherwise lackluster lampoon, Kathleen Freeman plays a no-nonsense-type dowager dickering to pay for a prospective hysterectomy with a valise full of green Stamps. Frustrated by Sellers's machinations, she decides, instead, to get a color TV set with those supermarket dividends.

The future could hold other living structures in store that needn't be all sharp angles and rectangles. Two prototype designs for housing of the future forsee a radically different urban environment. Both projects, not yet built, explore the technology of our time and make use of products and materials already at hand. The Apartapak system, shown above, is a versatile building made up entirely of standardized components. Interior and exterior partitions are stacked and rearranged to provide outdoor terraces with privacy from neighbors; curved windows of glass give light, airy interiors; the setback steps of each floor eliminate the dark tunnellike rooms of lower levels so they, too, are as desirable a living space as apartments up top. Apartapak was designed by architect Richard Aldiedge of Los Angeles who talks in terms of people ordering their apartment or house from a mail order catalog of components to create their own design. The partial list of components includes interior and exterior wall panels, premolded or prefabricated kitchen and bath room units, sun protection shields, and storage units. Kitchen and bath room units would slip into the structural utility core with the plumbing, mechanical and electrical hookups sandwiched in floor panels.",1972-10-01T05:00:00+0000

Muller's new book makes an interesting case for her as a nonorthodox but nonetheless religious writer who made artistic use of the Catholic grotesque. Quoting from her letters and her lec tures, he shows how her stories are all grounded in a belief in original sin, mercy and reve lation and how they are in volved with death, judgment and grace. But because she knew how divisive grace is and because she knew how to make the external world in her stories vivid and concrete, there was no conventional Christian piety in her work. In acknowledging the spiritual core of her fiction, Mr. Muller does not overlook her literary excellence. His book adds a new dimension to a complex and invidualistic writer.

us,Miklos Jansco's 'Red Psalm' Screened,"Miklos Jansco's ""Red Psalm"" takes place at an indeterminate time on an open field where a group of peasants confront and, in the long run, symbolically conquer a group of soldiers and landed aristocrats. Thus there are political issues at stakethough for Hungary of the 1970's, I should think, exceptionally safe onesbut I'm not sure they matter much. In ""Red Psalm,"" as in Jansco's movies generally (""The Round-up,"" ""The Red and the White,"" etc.), the point is not what things are, but what they look like.On one level things look pretty good. The cast is made up mostly of handsome young men and beautiful young women, and some of the young women undress from time to time in a kind of solemn masque of eroticism. The color is lush, the movements are graceful and the camera work  a Jansco trademarkis spectacular.According to the current issue of the film magazine, Sight and Sound, ""Red Psalm"" contains only 26 shots. An ordinary movie of this length (88 minutes) would contain several hundred shots. To make up the difference, the camera moves and people move back and forth and in large or small circles, and I suppose it is right to sayas everybody saysthat a Jansco film is not so much directed as choreographed. Actually, it looks to me less like choreography than a cross between eurythmics and close-order drill.It is difficult to pinpoint the reasons for the incredible monotony of so much vigorous activity, but surely one reason is that nothing happens in ""Red Psalm"" except for the benefit of the camera. That may sound like any movie, but actually it is like no movie (except another Jansco movie) and is virtually a negation of the whole, necessary relation of cinema to life.Nothing could be further, say, from the great fluid camera movements of a Max Ophuls than the elaborate cycles and epicycles of the Jansco world, where everybody  open fields notwithstandingis imprisoned within rigid limits of the director's rage for abstract patterns.""Red Psalm"" was the late Sunday evening offering of the New York Film Festival.",1972-10-02T05:00:00+0000

us,' Summer Soldiers' Studies War-Weary G.I. in Japan,"""The summer soldier,"" wrote Tom Paine in 1776, and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.""The hero of ""Summer Soldiers,"" Hiroshi Teshigahara's new Japanese film, is an American G.I. named Jim, a dark-haired, sad-eyed, exhausted, young Vietnam veteran who, while on leave in Japan, tries to desert from the Army and winds up, weeks later, back where he started in a state of controlled despair.""Summer Soldiers"" is an intelligent, level-headed movie that refusesbravely, I thinkto deal in the sort of hysteria that denies the intention of other antiwar films. Mr. Teshigahara, the director whose ""Woman in the Dunes"" was seen here eight years ago, and John Nathan, the American who wrote the screenplay, have made an antiwar film thousands of miles from any battlefront, in terms of culture shocks, the psychology of loneliness and people working at cross-purposes with the best of intentions. Which may be why ""Summer Soldiers"" is more witty than moving, and less tragic than Jim's eventual fate would lead you to believe.The soldier is first taken in by a good-hearted, not particularly bright B-girl. ""You gonna give me a hard time?"" she says to cheer him up. He smiles, and she says it again and again and again, which are a few times too many. She, in turn, puts Jim in touch with the Deserters' Aid Committee, a group of liberal-to-radical Japanese do-gooders who ask Jim why he's deserted, then argue passionately among themselves about whether or not Jim's lack of ideology is important.""Summer Soldiers"" describes no special dramatic parabola. It moves horizontally, as Jim does, in one-night stands, from family to family, most of whom treat the soldier as an exotic object. Jim, played by Keith Sykes, remains almost as mysterious to us, essentially decent and mostly inarticulate, Mr. Teshigahara, however, has a lovely time studying the attitudes of what a Japanese radical manual (""How to Resist Arrest"") calls the ""host families.""The director has as much sympathy for these people when they are being silly or smug or insensitive as when they are being selfless and understanding. One of Jim's hosts attempts to teach him Japanese and is shocked when the American prefers to spend the night with the bar girl. The G.I. spends another night planted in front of the TV set watching a Japanese-dubbed Lucille Ball show. He can't understand a word, but the faces are as familiar as the intensity of the canned laughter.On still another night in another middle-class household, he plays a guitar and sings some songs he has written. Says the father: ""You could go on television as 'The Singing Deserter,' wearing dark glasses. You could give the money to The Movement."" ""Yes,"" says Jim, though he realizes he has no real interest in any movements.From time to time, Mr. Teshigahara cuts from the narrative to an interview with a Spanish-American deserter, Miguel (Greg Antonacci), who, unlike Jim, knows exactly what he's doing, which is preparing for revolution. Miguel jogs, he studies, he disciplines himself. ""Life is beautiful,"" he says in that glum way of someone trying to convince himself.These interludes are out of keeping with the rest of the film, which actually has less to do with specific issues than with loneliness of such desperate degree that it becomes a type of humiliation. Toward the end of the film, two Japanese school girls, members of The Movement, try to pick up the soldier in a bar in order to help him. He turns on them: ""What if I were just an ordinary guy? Would you be interested then?"" They wouldn't. It is not, perhaps, a fair question, but it makes one of the film's most sorrowful, even Buuelian points: to recognize charity is to accept insult.""Summer Soldiers"" was shown last night at the New York Film Festival.",1972-10-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: 'We Won't Grow Old',"Since its emotions are exposed nakedly and honestly, ""We Won't Grow Old Together"" (translated simplistically by the producers as ""Break-Up"" from the original, ""Nous Ne Viellierons Pas Ensemble"") cleaves to memory like a fond embrace of long ago or an unpaid debt. The writer-director, Maurice Pialat, in the French import that was screened Saturday night at the New York Film Festival, projects starkly beautiful truths but his devotion to details of an affair on its last legs finally becomes redundant and painfully obvious.Pialat, who was represented at the 1968 festival by his first feature, ""Naked Childhood"" (shown here commercially in 1970 as ""Me""), is concerned with the final months of the disintegrating, six-year liaison between a fortyish, married movie cameraman and his 25-year-old mistress. If he has developed a story line that could be summarized in a simple sentence, Pialat nevertheless delves deeply and sensitively into nuances of his principals' feelings and actions to make them strikingly three-dimensional human beings.A compassionate viewer may not be entirely certain as to the compulsions that drive Pialat's often choleric hero, or his anguished mistress, or their parents and friends, or his estranged wife, who hasn't left his bed and board but who is devoted enough to try to help him out of his romantic mess. But the over-all effect of an essentially tragic triangle is made incisively real and tender.Marlene Jobert, chic and comely in bikini, blue jeans or miniskirts, is confused and terrified as the abused mistress. Although she finally opts for marriage to another man, she's completely convincing when she says, wistfully, ""after all we've had, I can't believe it's over.""As the equally ill-used wife, Macha Meril, who also sadly reminds her husband of his selfishness, elicits compassion in a somewhat vaguely written role. And wisps of character emanate from Christine Fabrega, Jacques Galland and Muse Dalbray, as Miss Jobert's sullenly, protective parents and grandmother.But Jean Yanne (remembered here for portrayals in Chabrol's ""Le Boucher"" and Godard's ""Weekend""), as the burly, domineering antihero who discovers love too late, gives a naturalistic, forceful performance. Before winning the best actor's award for his portrayal in the recent Cannes Festival, Mr. Yanne castigated the film. ""I think it's a lousy story,"" he said, in part, noting also, ""If I'm any good in the part, believe me, it was completely involuntary.""From this vantage point, Mr. Yanne protests too much. ""We Won't Grow Old Together"" does have some repetitious, soap opera-like faults but more often it poignantly touches the heart and mind.",1972-10-02T05:00:00+0000

But it backfired somehow. And finally it takes the police, the Army, the railroad and the power company (but not the Air Force or the Marines) to vanquish the big-eared monsters who neigh like horses, stampede like cattle, roar like lions and breathe very heavilyespecially when they are going to do something awful, like chew up the keeper of the general store, so as to get at the lettuce in the back room.Several friends have asked how you can make a rabbit seem scary, and I must confess that ""Night of the Lepus"" in no way answers their question. It doesn't even reasonably try.Except for a few tired clichs of monsterdom (rabbits rearing up on their hind legs, blood dripping from their two front teeth), the film relies almost entirely on slow-motion shots of ordinary rabbits running through miniaturized settings or in front of scaled-down back projections.It is this technical laziness as much as the stupid story or the dumb direction that leaves the film in limbo and places it in neither one camp nor the other  neither with ""Attack of the 50-Foot Woman"" nor with Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail.",1972-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Saga of a Homecoming:Mekas Brothers View Lithuanian Journey,"In his open-ended, autobiographical film, ""Diaries, Notebooks and Sketches,"" Jonas Mekas says at one point: ""They tell me that I should always be searching, but I celebrate what I see."" Although the photographed diaries are indeed a celebrationof friends, of enemies, of fine meals eaten, of beautiful weather enjoyed, of streets walked, downthey also document a search for an unhackneyed use of the autobiographical motion-picture camera as an instrument of self-understanding. ""Diaries"" is the ""War and Peace"" of a type of home movie that is more familiar when it's called ""Daddy's New Car,"" ""Susan's Wedding"" or ""Our Summer Vacation, 1971.""Mr. Mekas's newest film, ""Reminiscences of a Journey to Lithuania,"" is the 88-minute record of the trip he took last summer with his younger brother, Adolfas, and Adolfas's wife, Pola Chapelle, to the home in Lithuania the Mekases left during World War II, thinking they were going to the University of Vienna, although, instead, they landed in a slave-labor camp outside Hamburg. It was shown last night at the New York Film Festival on a program with ""Going Home,"" Adolfas Mekas's 61-minute record of the same trip.The program makes for an evening rather more brimful of Mekases than one might ordinarily seek out, yet it's also successively moving, indulgent, beautiful, poetic, banal, repetitious and bravely, heedlessly personal. Although ""Reminiscences"" can stand by itself well enough, it is a continuation of the ""Diaries"" in style and mood.The action is speeded up, as if to extract the essence of an event. There are parenthetical inserts referring to other places and times. And over all of it there is the same feeling of passion, affection and wonder that marks Jonas Mekas as a film critic and a champion of underground filmmakers, even when he is being most rude and outrageous about the idiocies of nonbelievers. Although I'm told that neither brother was allowed to see the other's film until it was completed, Adolfas's ""Going Home"" serves as a rather homey (a little too homey, I'm afraid) curtain-raiser to Jonas's film. It is Adolfas and Pola putting on the home movie, but not quite far enough: saying good-by to their cats, sitting in the plane, buying a poncho in Dublin for Pola and mugging the way people do in home movies. Turn a camera on Pola, even in Moscow, and she's likely to do a ""Shuffle Off to Buffalo"" routine.""Going Home,"" for all that, does supply a lot of straight information that makes ""Reminiscences"" more easily comprehensible. The brothers, however, seem to disagree on whether it was 27 or 25 years since they'd seen their birthplace.""Reminiscences"" is an especially appealing film, and a good deal more than a record of Jonas Mekas's summer vacation. It is a testament to all persons displaced, geographically, as the Mekas brothers were, and spiritually. Without sentimentality, Jonas recalls meetings in the early 1950's of displaced persons at Stony Brook, L. I., and ""somewhere at the end of Atlantic Avenue."" They were cheerful gatherings of people who seemed doomed, sentenced forever to be out of touch.There is something of this same feeling about his treatment of the family's reunion in Lithuania. The great familial love is still there. The joy of reconciliation is real. Yet the years have created a gulf that no amount of touching and eating and drinking and singing together will ever quite bridge. ""Reminiscences"" is about growingaway as well as up.",1972-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,'Nathalie':French Work by Duras Proves Minimal,"The most insidious thing about the nouveau movie, which is a polite way of describing Marguerite Duras's newest, most minimal film, ""Nathalie Granger,"" is that it traps you in its own time, unlike the nouveau roman, which can be skipped through or read at leisure in an afternoon or a year.You can't skip through ""Nathalie Granger."" To see it you are forced to watch it for as long as it lasts, while, in turn, it watches its characters, rather as if the camera were a Siamese cat whose feelings had been hurt.Without betraying the slightest interest, the camera records the physical appearance of two expressionless women who look a lot like Jeanne Moreau and Lucia Bose. They share a house with their two children, one of whom, Nathalie, is apparently a problem. ""She wants to kill everyone,"" says one of the women, who seem to be interchangeable. ""She wants to be an orphan, or a Portuguese maid.""Nathalie, however, remains docilethis being a minimal movie.The camera paces through the house, looking into mirrors, down hallways, through windows. There is a report on the radio about a murder and a police manhunt. The telephone rings. Wrong number. ""There is no telephone here, madame,"" Miss Moreau says into the receiver."" Funny? Not really. It's too pretty and solemn. A salesman calls. He tries desperately to sell a Vedetta Tambour OO8 washing machine that comes in three colors. For a brief moment, the ghost of Pinter's wit walks over the grave of the film. Miss Bose goes into the garden, again. Miss Moreau falls asleep. A cat saunters through. The camera just stares. When a person or a cat leaves a room, Miss Duras seems to say, that room is empty. Such are the discoveries of ""Nathalie Granger,"" a dead-end movie that, I confidently hope, few of us are ready for.""Nathalie Granger"" was shown last night at the New York Film Festival and is a dismal follow-up to ""La Musica"" and ""Destroy, She Said,"" the two earlier directorial efforts by the novelist turned filmmaker.",1972-10-07T05:00:00+0000

An avant-garde filmmaker who began directing movies while still in his teens, he was only 22 in 1970, when he made ""Inner Scar,"" which played last night in Alice Tully Hall.""Inner Scar"" features Pierre Clementi (nude) and the Andy Warhol superstar Nico (dressed in a loose robe) and a few others, including Phillippe Garrel. Clementi speaks French; Nico sometimes complains in English and sometimes declaims in German verse, and sometimes sings for musical background on the soundtrack. There are no subtitles.The people, never more than two at a time, move through a variety of landscapes from glacial to nearly tropicalbut that are always, in some manner, desert. The people may walk or run or ride a horse, or drive a flock of sheep or even sail a little boatbut almost always they are in movement. At some level I suspect there is a story in which Clementi, carrying bow and arrows and wielding a sword, comes as king or savior or avenging angel to Nico in the wilderness, and then disappears without satisfying her complaint. But the story is very obscure.Much of the time the landscape seems reducedeven self-consciously reducedto the four elements of earth, air, fire and water. It conveys the feeling of a space unreal in the way, say, that the landscape of the Krazy Kat comic strip was unreal. And as if it were in a comic strip or cartoon, the landscape supports images and gestures of great stylishness and wit.""Inner Scar"" is sometimes very funny, and it is a humorusually concerning the indignities suffered by an unhappy Nico spurned  that grows out of, and depends upon, the incongruity of human finiteness seen against the vast perspectives of the film's natural world.In such stark, unyielding simplicity there is surely a good deal of pretension. But I think there is also some achievement, and irony, and an implicit appreciation of the ridiculousness of sticking a couple of people out in the middle of nowhere (in fact, several strange locations, including Iceland) to perform symbolic drama.Compared with the desert journeys of Alexandro Jodorowsky""Fando and Lis,"" ""El Topo""  ""Inner Scar"" seems downright civilized. Not a movie you can exactly warm up to, and no startling breakthrough in screen art eitherbut a very interesting and restrained experiment in visual rhetoric, in minimal gesture, in setting some highly abstract patterns of human behavior in the midst of a curiously agreeable wilderness.",1972-10-07T05:00:00+0000

Two of its owners, one in the 17th century and another a century or so later, had gone bankrupt while living there. By 1971, the mansion was vacant (but for three amiable ghosts) and the estate went on the auction block. I had never seen a house like it, said its new owner, Robert Carrier, the food critic, author and restaurateur, whose Carrier Cook Shops introduced many Britons and Americans to gour met cookery. The building combined everything in one marvelous house a stately front, Tudor back and Queen. Anne interiors that are almost Fed eral. Nowadays Carrier is busy re storing the galleries, staircases (the one below dates from 1680), and the huge columned hall, right, to their 18th century magnificence. The second story will house his own apartments. One of its features is the gallery, left, that is both study and informal dining room. But to defray the maintenance costs of this architectural white elephant, Carrier will open part of the house as a private dining club where the em phasis will be on dining in an intimate homelike setting (vignette above). He also hopes to reinstate the summer arts festival which had once been an event at the mansion. The transplanted American from Tarrytown, N.

The constant necessity of postponing the completion date was occasioned by its unusual design; by a dispute between the architect, Jorn Ut zon, and building authorities so that he walked out on the job, and by the increasing costs, some of which were met by lotteries. Despite its spectacular exterior and location, the constantly inprogress opera house became a stand ing joke in music circles. Even people from Sydney would take a kind of wry pride in their infamous problem child and would tell with relish about the latest miscalculation in planning or construction.

The following season he was the Negro Slave in Schehdra zade, and Carl van Vechten wrote: This strange, curious, headwagging simian creature, scarce human, wrig gled through the play, leaving a long streak of lust and terror in his wake. Then he was the Petrushka whom Cyril Beaumont described as a pup pet that sometimes aped a human being; and as the Harlequin in Car naval he was again a headwagging creature, but a sprite: by most ac counts sly, feline, the very soul of mischief.

By the time when it came to be written it was obvious that there would be great difficulty in getting it pub lished (in spite of the present book shortage, which ensures that anything describable as a book will sell), and in the event it was refused by four publishers. Only one of these had any ideological motive. Two had been publishing antiRussian books for years, and the other had no noticeable political color. One publisher actually started by accepting the book, but after making the prelim inary arrangements he decided to consult the Ministry of Information, who appear to have warned him, or at any rate strongly advised him, against publishing it. Here is an extract from his letter:",1972-10-08T05:00:00+0000

The Russians withdrew behind their borders, and hopes that the Red Army would be the agent of revolution in Europe were dropped in favor of Lenin's New Economic Policy. Mr. Davies says that the war con tributed to the replacing of Trotsky's International Com munism by Stalin's brand of Russiafirst.

us,Susannah York Plays Disturbed Woman,"As for ""Images,"" save the pieces. Also the housea house fronting a lake and a magnificent, craggy sweep of Ireland  where most of the action (confusion) takes place.This clanging, pretentious, tricked-up exercise, shown last night at the New York Film Festival, is almost a model of how not to dramatize the plight of a schizoid. Then how do you? Simply, clearly, with some sort of progressive story line minus a technical smoke screen. Above all, don't let the camera have a nervous breakdown ahead of the heroine.Finally, since she's tentatively a normally behaving woman, with a loving, if short-sighted husband, why stir in a musical score befitting ""Dracula Rises From the Grace""?As played by Susannah York, our girl is also some sort of writer, scribbing away furiously in a diary or journal that sounds like Emily Bront on pot.After a prologue, crammed with opening doors, hallucinations and jangling telephones, Miss York and her spouse, Rene Auberjonois, slip away to that country retreat, where a dead lover starts reappearing (walking in and out of the film) and a lecherous neighbor closes in.If the middle portion of the picture, in which the heroine is shown amorously grappling with the two men and her husband tossed in, is supposed to be unhinging Miss York, include us. Either she can't count or she can't cope. That's her Waterloo. An inevitable murder sets off such a teasing, exasperating whodunit postscript that the corpseand the pictureare left ice-cold.As for why Robert Altman, the brilliant director of the comedy, ""M*A*S*H,"" elected to write and direct this mish-mash, that's his own business. It just doesn't work. Miss York, confined mainly to sly petulance and a few yowls, has also done better, as in ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" The rest of the small cast does well enough, more or less as trickery props.We'll hold out for clarity, credibility, at least some kind of audience stance in the study of a schizoid about to crack, such as in the brilliant, French ""Life Upside Down."" Or Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion."" Forget ""Images.""",1972-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: 'Merchant of Four Seasons' and 'Bad Company',"Her lips are cherry red, and when she smiles, they uncover even rows of pearly teeth. Beneath the soft swirls of her upswept blonde hair, her face all but radiates perfection. She is supernaturally beautifullike an angel, or the goddess of some 1940's movie. Kind, clear-eyed, compassionate; she is Erna, the good sister of Hans, the fruit peddler. And she figuresnot too prominentlyin Rainer Werner Fassbinder's new movie, ""Merchant of Four Seasons.""I am interested more in her beauty than in her character (she is played by an actress named Hanna Schygulla, who, in fairness, deserves some of the credit) because it is a beauty that belongs neither to our time nor quite to our life.Partly, it is from another time, the late 40's, which suggests the style adopted by all the women who have any style in ""Merchant of Four Seasons."" And partly it is another life, a life that is at once too bright, too warm, too vibrant; and at the same time too alien and artificial to be real.If you can form a picture of Erna's face you will have some notion of the style that pervades this film about Hans, who disgraces his middle-class Munich family by peddling fruit, whose big scrawny wife, Irmgard, is highly attractive to other men, and whose existence is a series of minor shocks and grinding disappointments. He suffers a heart attack, and changes his way of business and begins to succeed and to become a credit to his family.And then his despondency really matures, and in the course of one sociable evening, knowing just what he is doing, he drinks himself to death  with toasts to everyone: family, buddies, wife, daughter and even to the love of his life.When somebody at Hans's funeral notices a woman standing off to one side carrying a bouquet of red roses and asks Irmgard who she is, Irmgard rather casually answers: ""The love of Hans's life  I phoned her . . ."" Thus she acknowledges the most extravagant dream of her late husband in a commonplace courtesy.The extraordinary range of interaction between the stolidly commonplace and the extravagantly romantic is one aspect of the imaginative freedom of ""Merchant of Four Seasons."" And it is such freedom that allows the film its intellectual playfulness, its seriousness, its furtive ecstasy, its spare realism, its cruelty and its sometimes unnerving decency.Mr. Fassbinder, born in 1945, is still very young, and incredibly prolific and probably the surest talent in the new German cinema. He makes movies that look like nobody else's, but that look like the discovery of a wonderfully idiomatic way to make movies. His work is neiher easy nor ingratiating, but it is very exciting, and sometimesas in the manifestations of the sublime Erna  moving beyond all expectation.""Merchant of Four Seasons,"" a movie I like very much, played early yesterday evening at the New York Film Festival.",1972-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,An Indian 'Adversary':Satyajit Ray Work Is A Moving Comedy An Ex-Medical Student Seethes at Injustices,"If it weren't for the New York Film Festival, few of Satyajit Ray's post-Apu trilogy films would ever have been seen in this country, a fact that the great Indian director acknowledged Saturday evening in a short speech before the current festival's screening of ""The Adversary"" at Alice Tully Hall. This is a comment on the American public's moviegoing tastes, which are actually no worse than anybody else's. It also says a great deal about the kind of films that Ray makes.For a number of reasons, a Ray film doesn't demand our immediate attention in the way that a Buuel or a Bergman or a Godard does. A Ray film carries no guarantee to shock. Its characters are too involved in one form or another of daily survival to fret about metaphysical matters. It won't outrage us. Regarded in India as the most un-Indian of Indian films directors, he is, to us, quintessentially Indian.This has to do with the rhythm of his films, which is so regular as almost to lull us to sleep in a place (a movie theater) where custom has taught us to expect a continuing succession of alarms of varying tones and volumes. It also has to do with Ray's vision of Indian life, which is anything but exotic or sensuous. His male characters, especially, seem at first somewhat timid, dressed in their occidental clothes that hang on them like the hand-me-downs from someone else's civilization.""The Adversary"" is about such a man, a former medical student named Siddhartha who shares a crowded Calcutta flat with his widowed mother, an uncle, a pretty younger sister with a fairly well-paying job, and a younger brother, who is supposed to be a student but who apparently spends most of his time working for revolutionary causes.Siddhartha is caught betwixt and between. He seethes with rage about social injustices, about economic corruption, but he is powerless to express it. The best he can do is act rudely at job interviews. ""Do you like flowers?"" he is asked by a prospective employer at the botanical gardens. ""Not unconditionally,"" says Siddhartha. ""Who was Prime Minister at the time of independence?"" the employer goes on. ""Whose independence?"" the young man answers.""The Adversary"" is about Siddhartha's taking hold of himself when he falls in love and after he has endured a series of small but awful humiliations. These have the effect of making him accept his individuality, and of increasing his awareness of the fact that to be a part of a generalization, as humanity is a generalization, is not necessarily defeat.""All people are the same,"" he tells his girl at one point, meaning that one body is much like another as far as bones, muscles, nerves and arteries are concerned. ""Not exactly alike,"" says the girl. Men and women are different. Temperaments are different.""The Adversary"" moves so quietly, with such seeming politeness to jaded film senses, that it takes a while to realize that for all its somberness it's a particularly moving comedy. The methods are so conventional, they seem reserved, but the director's sensibility is profoundly compassionate.A Ray film is worth attending to, even during lapses that are not his. The English subtitles on the festival print translate not only the Bengali dialogue, but also the the English dialogue. ""I don't smoke"" says a young man in English. ""I don't smoke,"" says the English subtitle. That, however, is the most mysterious thing about an otherwise clear and beautiful movie.",1972-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: A Gem From Truffaut,"Franois Truffaut's ""Two English Girls"" is a film of such beautiful, charming and comic discretion that it isn't until the end that one realizes it's also immensely sad and even brutal, though in the nonbrutalizing way that truth can sometimes be.The film was shown last night at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall and opens its commercial engagement Sunday at the Fine Arts Theater, where, I trust, it will remain through Thanksgiving, Christmas and beyond.The source material is ""Les Deux Anglaises et Le Continent,"" the second novel by Henri-Pierre Roch, who didn't get around to writing his first until he was 74. That was ""Jules et Jim,"" which Truffaut adapted into his finest film in 1961.A bit too much will probably be made of the fact that ""Two English Girls"" reverses the central situation of ""Jules and Jim,"" in which the two heroes spend their lives being turned on and off by the liberated Catherine.The new film, like the earlier one, is set largely in an undefined past  that is, sometime in pre-World War I Paris, though the exact time is left fuzzy, as times usually are in fables. Instead of two young men, the victims (who are in great measure the mistresses of their fates) are two proper English girls, sisters, who share a profound attachment for the same young Frenchman.In many ways, however, ""Two English Girls"" is more closely linked to such later (and dissimilar) Truffaut films as ""The Soft Skin,"" ""Mississippi Mermaid"" and ""Stolen Kisses,"" each a variation on the conflict between a love that is obsessive (sometimes called pure) and a mortal one that is always aware of compromise.""Jules and Jim"" touches on this. ""Two English Girls"" is about nothing else. ""Jules and Jim"" also has to do with a number of other things, including social satire, and is and ambitious work of a much younger director. ""Two English Girls"" is less lyric, more spare, completely preoccupied by not only the the extremely complicated moral barriers to love, but also by the physical impediments.In no other film he has made has Tuffaut ever expressed the ruthless ecstasy of the scene in ""Two English Girls"" in which Claude (Jean-Pierre Laud) finally takes the virginity of the pure Muriel (Stacey Tendeter). Unlike her sister Anne (Kika Markham, who accepts her sexuality, though with scarcely more happy results, Muriel, who manages to look like both Queen Elizabeth and Catherine Deneuve, behaves like a princess in a fairy tale. She hides behind dark glasses, as if she had suffered a wicked enchantment, and says such things as ""I want all of Claude or nothing. If it's no, let it be like death.""The film covers seven years in the lives of the curious trio, much of it as if the film were the daily journal that was Roch's favorite literary form. The scenes are sometimes so short they are almost subliminal, with the voice of the narrator (Truffaut) often supplying a text. Purists, I expect, will again object to this tampering with the accepted relationship between image, which the purists think is paramount, and word, which has always been thought to be a lesser tool of cinema.The effect, nevertheless, is lovely, and even appropriate, since fables begin with spoken words. The performances are fine. Laud may well beas Truffaut calls himthe greatest French actor of his generation. At least I think that explains why he seemed so off-puttingwhich he was supposed toin ""Bed and Board"" and here, as the earnestly free-loving rake, so appealing.The film is filled with wonderful things, but I especially remember the sequence in which Anne and Claude spend a week in a cabin on a lake in Switzerland. ""They were more resolute than in love,"" says the narrator. ""Their program was simple: live first and define it later."" At the end of the week, we see them in a long-shot, rowing away from the islandin separate rowboats.",1972-10-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Double Bill of Horror Arrives,"Wise horror fans will skip ""Vampire Circus"" and settle for ""Countess Dracula"" on the new double bill at the Forum. Both are Hammer Productions, England's scream factory, but the first was dealt a quick, careless anvil. With some care and attention, the Countess fares considerably better.How's this for a new vampire gimmick? She's a doddering old palace crone, restored as a ravishing, lusty young blonde each time her servants deliver her a new, village blood victim. Meanwhile her sexual quarry is a handsome young Hussar officer next door. Add, for good measure, an Iago-like steward, as the countess's paramour.Until the two-thirds mark, it all works very well indeed. Peter Sasdy's direction is smooth and pointed and the dialogue has a crisp, cutting edge. The dcor and the costumes, given a nice Balkan-Turkish flavoring, are beautiful and so is the music. The horror uncoils steadily, cushioned by a kind of stylish relish on all sides, including the acting.Furthermore for all the thematic gore, the story has a cool, built-in poignancy in the scenes of the desperate old countess grasping at youth and beauty. One minute she creaks like parchment, the next she's a Playboy centerfold. Ingrid Pitt, as both, is truly a sight.But the picture runs out of gas, along with the desperate old woman. An intriguing set-up, ripe for a slam-bang finale, slackens disappointingly, with much prolonged milling around. Hammer lets things flap instead of socking a home-run clout, leaving Miss Pitt and such capable veterans as Nigel Green and Maurice Denham more or less on their own.""Countess Dracula"" is better than most in a sea of trashy competition.

us,'The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie',"As in a dream things go fearfully wrong for the characters in Luis Buuel's brilliant (and brilliantly titled) new comedy, ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,"" but the Ambassador of Miranda and his Parisian friends, the Snchals and the Thevenots, and Mrs. Thevenot's sister, Florence, always manage to cope gracefully. On second thought, Florence is not quite as consistent as the others.One martini and Florence is inclined to throw uplooking beautiful one minute and like a dead goose the next, her head dangling out the Ambassador's Cadillac window.For the most part, however, the Ambassador, the Snchals, the Thevenots and Florence survive a series of magnificently bewildering circumstances, employing the kind of elegance, self-interest, delicacy, intelligence, rudeness and short attention spans that Buuel apparently finds to be the power, the curse and the appeal of the European upper middle class.The world of ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" is one of absolutely everything interrupted.For some peculiar reason, every time the friends sit down to dine, odd things happen. An Army arrives or, just as the food is being served, a curtain goes up and the friends find themselves on a stage playing to an audience. ""I don't know my lines,"" M. Snchal (Jean-Pierre Cassel) says with wild-eyed, middle-of-the-night fright.When Mme. Thevenot (Delphine Seyrig) is at the flat of the Ambassador (Fernando Rey) for an afternoon tryst, her husband (Paul Frankeur) stops byand you haven't seen such a flurry of garter belts and little white gloves in 40 years of moviegoing. Things get so bad that fate even conspires to interrupt (though not permanently) the very profitable heroin smuggling operation that the Ambassador conducts with the help of M. Snchal and M. Thevenot.One must, I suppose, talk about ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" rather gravely. It is, after all, Buuel's 28th feature since ""L'Age D'Or"" in 1929 but, except for ""The Exterminating Angel"" and ""Belle de Jour,"" he has never since employed the special freedom of Surrealism for such astonishing and lucid results.Several years ago, Buuel said of ""The Exterminating Angel"" that ""its images, like the images in a dream, do not reflect reality, but create it."" A lot of ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" is made up of dreamsat times, of dreams within dreams, at other times, dreams that one person has dreamed that another dreamed. Sometimes they are just the dreams of a passer-by. You've never seen so many wish fulfillments. However, much of it is not a dream, and all of it is real  the unique creation of a director who, at 72, has never been more fully in control of his talents, as a filmmaker, a moralist, social critic and humorist.One must talk about these things; yet they tend to flatten the special exhilaration that ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" inspires when you see it. That exhilaration has to do with the awareness that you're watching a genius at work through any number of indications, some almost minuscule.Take, for example, the sort of small to-do that ensues when Mme. Snchal (Stphane Audran) and Mme. Thevenot, with Florence (Bulle Ogier), go for afternoon tea at a fancy Paris hotel. Florence asks to change her seat. She can't stand looking at the cellist. ""I hate cellos,"" she pouts. ""Most orchestras have dropped them."" Like others in her class, Florence is a woman in the thrall of cockeyed fashion.Or take the character of the clergyman (Julien Bertheau). ""You've heard of the worker priests?"" he asks the astonished Mme. Snchal as he applies for the job of gardener. ""Well, I'm a worker bishop.""In addition to being extraordinarily funny and perfectly acted, ""The Discreet Charm"" moves with the breathtaking speed and self-assurance that only a man of Buuel's experience can achieve without resorting to awkward ellipsis. It was shown last night at the New York Film Festival and opens Sunday, Oct. 22 at the Little Carnegie. As I have not said in several years: Don't miss it.",1972-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Fete: 'Assassination of Trotsky',"Joseph Losey's career in recent years has vacillated with quite wonderful agility between distinguished motion pictures, like ""Accident"" and ""The Go-Between,"" and odd-ball movies, starring one or more of the Burtons: ""Secret Ceremony"" and ""Boom."" I'm sure that any student of Losey could argue for the thematic continuity of all his work (even the failed allegory of ""Figures in a Landscape""), but for their audacity and imaginative density I prefer the odd-ball movies. And among these I would place ""The Assassination of Trotsky,"" which stars Richard Burton as Leon Trotsky, and is a very odd project indeed.The movie deals with Trotsky's last months, mainly from May, 1940, when a night-time raid on Trotsky's Mexican compound failed; until August of the same year, when an incredibly clumsy assassination attempt by a man known as Frank Jacson succeeded. Jacson (Alain Delon) was a secretive, even shy man, who gained his access to the compound through Sylvia Ageloff (Romy Schneider), an intimate of the family; and much of the film is given to developing not a motive, but a private world-view, for the assassin.As you might expect, history weighs heavy over such a movie, not least in a performance by Burton that almost looks historical. Much of the dialogue is taken from journals or accurate accounts of Trotsky's life, and it sounds as if he spent his life polishing up speeches for the movies.Thus, a nostalgic Wordsworthian Trotsky, to his grandson: ""You should have been with us in the old days. What happiness it was to be alive! Storming the Winter Palace. . ."" Or, in a hopeful mood: ""Ah! It's a long time since I felt so well. . . Today I could climb mountains. . .""this is, of course, the morning of his assassination.The mere fact that Trotsky may have said such things doesn't excuse them in a movie. There is a lot more not to be excused in ""The Assassination of Trotsky,"" but to be borne with by anybody who cares about the often beautiful things that Losey does with his camera, his always superb feeling for dcor, his ways of placing his characters in a time scheme that is not simply historical.I suspect that what goes on beneath the narrative in ""The Assassination of Trotsky"" is very complex. I can only say at this point that it has to do with a fantastic use of corridors, with continually shifting levels of reality, with a penchant for turning mirrors into muralsthe murals of Orozco and Rivera, the very structure of Losey's Mexico City and of the agony he is dramatizing.All the actors are made up to resemble their originals with extraordinary accuracy, and none seems more accurate than Valentina Cortese as Natalia Sedov, Trotsky's wife. Her role is comparatively small, but I think it is the loveliest performance in the movie.""The Assassination of Trotsky"" played last night in the New York Film Festival, and it opens Sunday at the Coronet Theater.",1972-10-14T05:00:00+0000

A plump, pleasant-faced woman sits in a chair and tells the camera about an incident of her earlier years, the purchase of a special party dress that somehow got lost.She tells the story twice, the first time with girlish delight. The second time, analyzing her ""strange kind of special feeling"" at the memory, she wistfully concludes that ""it was the first time anybody ever told me I looked beautiful.""And the last time, too, would be a safe guess by one viewer. Never mind, dear lady. Your prosaically detailed story, including a nagging repetition of ""ya know,"" is material with which Dorothy Parker could have made a classic short story about the human heart.Martha Coolidge's ""David: Off and On"" is an impressively trim, probing record of her troubled brother, a youthful dope addict and dropout. Miss Coolidge has used family-album stills, a crisscross interview format with her 21-year-old subject and a prowling camera to suggest his four years in and out of mental institutions.The shanty bohemians of North Vancouver in ""Livin' on the Mud"" are more interesting as a happy, self-sustained community of independent people. Sean Malone winningly evokes a seedy utopia, threatened and finally destroyed by urban development (bulldozers).

He issued an earlier report, passionate and often vivid, on Movement events in The Wedding Within the War (1971). Now, in On Learning and Social Change, he has provided part of an answer to the question of what transformations sixties activism must undergo as we move into the seventiesand the activists into their thirties. The book is in fact shaped by an underlying concern with the passage from an age in which change seemed within our grasp, into the decade when it begins to get hard, after the easy dreams of the sixties: when Amerika's true resistance to change, and for each of us our own, begins to come into the open.",1972-10-15T05:00:00+0000

I have used a simple method suggested to me by a professional associate who is a specialist in this field. About 30 minutes before descent, it as suggested that the nose be sprayed several times with a decongestant such as neosynephrine, or similar medication. This apparently permits enough shrinking of the nasal passage and opening of the Eustachian tubes to neutralize the differences in air pressure as the plane descends. I have found that this has almost always prevented the severe pain that I had previcmsly observed in members of my family.

It is  a chaotic mixture that awaits some larger redemptive effort; so that despite The Armies of the Night and Why Are We in Vietnam?

us,Screen: 'Fellini's Roma',"""Fellini's Roma"" is perhaps three-quarters Fellini and one-quarter Rome; a very good proportion for a movie. Although an appreciation of the city informs every part of the movie, Rome is not so much the subject as the occasion for a film that is not quite fiction and surely not fact, but rather the celebration of an imaginative collaboration full of love and awe, suspicion, admiration, exasperation and a measure of well-qualified respect.It is also, for me, the most enjoyable Fellini in a dozen years, the most surprising, the most exuberant, the most beautiful, the most extravagantly theatrical. The audience I saw it with kept interrupting the film with applause. This isn't something you normally do at the movies, but it seems proper enough for ""Fellini's Roma.""It is altogether typical of Fellini that he should film his ""Roma,"" his tribute to a great city, mostly indoors on a sound stage. When he does go outside, he treats the very streets as a sound stage, with unreal lights and shadows playing over the facades.Or he turns to the process of his own filmmaking, to introduce a further element of the fantastic into a landscape that might already seem fantastic enough. Thus, in a sequence showing the Raccordo Anulare, a great highway skirting Rome, jammed with traffic in a stormy twilight, the subject becomes the camera crane itself, with its spotlights, its plastic rainshield flapping wildly in the wind, like some extraordinary, swooping, probing monster.""Fellini's Roma"" begins with the young Fellini in the north, in Rimini, first learning about Rome in school, from friends or from conversations overheard in taverns. It follows Fellini as a young man (played by Peter Gonzales) in his introduction to the city at the beginning of World War II, and then it continues in more or less self-contained sequences, shifting back and forth between the present and the not-so-distant past. Fellini, the real Fellini, makes a brief appearance, and there are celebrity spots for Gore Vidal and Anna Magnani (a bad idea), but mostly we are in the presence of what excites the director's imagination and his mind.That mind, whether you portant phenomenon of contemporary filmmaking, and ""Roma"" gives it a kind of freedom I have seen in no other Fellini movie. Its capacities for pleasure and terror, for sympathy and irony, are all perfectly met in ""Roma,"" where, for example, a strange conceit called an Ecclesiastical Fashion Show begins with roller-skating priests (""They move faster to Paradise"") and ends with a marvelously delicate, intricate, heraldic float constructed of human skeletons; or where the waiting room of any brothel (there are two, a fancy one and a poor one) seems a teeming antechamber to heaven's portal or hell's gate. It is as if Rome in the 20th century were the last great expression of the late Middle Ages.But there is also the ancient world and its modern counterparts, and perhaps no other image in the film really matches one brief glimpse of a monumental Fellini whore standing in the midst of fallen stone heads and torsos, no more permanent or wonderful than she, in a rain-driven field outside Rome.Yet there is another image, a face, a fresco at the bottom of a shallow pool of clear water, parl of an ancient Roman villa uncovered in subway excavations (this is all artifice) explored by the Fellini production crew.What matters is not the face itself, but the sense of wonder that Fellini not only offers but also shares, as if that were why he makes movies in the first place. I suspect that is why there are so many journeys of discoverya short ride, a walk into the past or another world  in Fellini's work; and why ""Roma,"" which is almost wholly a journey of discovery, seems so richly to epitomize his career.""Fellini's Roma"" opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld Theater.",1972-10-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Billie Holiday:'Lady Sings the Blues' Stars Diana Ross,"""Lady Sings the Blues,"" the first of what threatens to be a series of so-called entertainments based on the life and hard times of the late, truly great Billie Holiday, poses a tough question: How is it possible for a movie that is otherwise so dreadful to contain such a singularly attractive performance in the title role?It's not as if Diana Ross floats above the film, always remaining somehow disconnected from it, in that superior way that some actors affect when they find themselves in the vicinity of garbage. The former lead singer of the Supremes is on-screen from start to finish, which is to say almost endlessly, but her only apparent limitations are those imposed on her by a screenplay and direction seemingly designed to turn a legitimate legend into a whopper of a clich.Sidney J. Furie, the director and the three people credited with the screenplay, cannot use the basic truth of their facts as a defense of the film, although the facts have been generalized to protect the innocent (and the people who wouldn't give releases to the producers). They've made trite and meaningless such things as the child rape, indentured servitude in a Harlem whorehouse and an addiction to drugs that eventually contributed to Lady Day's death at age 44. It all becomes ridiculous.Witness the way they introduce one of Miss Holiday's most successful songs. Time: late 1930's. Place: somewhere in the South, though the terrain looks like Lake Tahoe. Miss Holiday is on a big-band bus tour when she suddenly finds herself witnessing a lynching. She staggers back in terror. On the soundtrack we hearcan it be?it sounds familiar, but yetyes, it is! The opening bars of ""Strange Fruit!"" This Billie Holiday has what might be called a prescient ear.Under such imbecilic circumstances, it's not yet possible to tell whether Miss Ross is a good actress, but she's an actress of exceptional beauty and wit, who is very much involved in trying to make a bad movie work.Most important, her singing of the more than a dozen songs once sung by Miss Holiday is a talented, very intelligent singer's homage to a jazz style of a sophistication never, since matched by anyone. ""Them There Eyes,"" ""What a Little Moonlight Can Do,"" ""Fine and Mellow""almost all of the great Holiday numbers are there (except, if I remember correctly. ""Billie's Blues"") and they are about as good as you can get, barring the real things.At times, they may even match the real things, at least some of those numbers Billie recorded late in her career when the phrasing was all that was left of a voice that had once had the kind of purity and assurance that could turn the seedy old Onyx Club on 52d Street into a shoe-box shaped center of the performing arts.""Lady Sings the Blues"" opened yesterday at the Loew's State 1 and Loew's Orpheum Theaters.",1972-10-19T05:00:00+0000

Finally he gave up altogether campaigning on the issues (which had admittedly grown very blurred and amorphous), and has now turned to a straightout personal assault on Mr. Nixon. Using the most extreme and emotional rhetoric, McGovern is concentrating all his anger on the person of the President, rather than on his record.

When he's orphaned at age 14, the Indian boy is taken out of the Colorado mountains, where he was born and reared, and sent to school on the Southern Ute reservation. For his own good he's asked to diagram sentences that seem to have been composed in Pennsylvania Dutch: ""The crowd after the thrilling finish applauded enthusiastically the act.""Years later, when he shows promise as a bronco rider. Tom (Frederic Forrest) is adopted by a canny, hard-drinking former rodeo rider named Red Dillon (Richard Widmark), who teaches Tom the tricks of the tradeboth how to ride well and how to appear to ride badly, that is, how to throw a contestthe better for Red to hustle bets on the side. It's for Tom's own good and not much else, since Red wastes most of their winnings on broads and booze.""When Legends Die,"" the first film to be directed by Stuart Millar, the producer (""Little Big Man,"" ""Paper Lion,"" etc.), is an intelligent, gentle, almost reticent film about the education of Tom Black Bull to the point where he can decide for himself what is, after all, for his own good. It's also about Indian pride and identity, but it doesn't slug you over the head with these things in the manner of a movie like ""Journey Through Rosebud.""In fact, ""When Legends Die"" may be too intelligent, too gentle and too reticent for its own good, especially in a market increasingly geared to the labeling of films as either hits or flops, which is more easily done when films deal in large, melodramatic gestures. ""When Legends Die"" does not. It deals in small betrayals, hurt feelings and interior resolutions, the sorts of things more likely to send you out of the theater talking about good taste than feeling any particular elation.Widmark is tough and funny as the grizzled old hustler. He is genuinely baffled when the younger man suggests there may be something more to life than going From one tank town rodeo to another, riding in endless Main Street parades behind knobby-kneed majorettes, putting on good shows, getting drunk, often getting rolled. Frederic Forrest, comparatively new to films, seems equally good.

us,"Screen: 'You'll Like My Mother,' a Thriller, Opens","""You'll Like My Mother,"" the ads tell you, is a thrilleras if with a title like that you needed to be toldand it is a thriller of a fairly conventional, comfortably old-fashioned sort.Filmed in the dead of winter in a marvelous old mansion with cluttered firelit rooms, carved wood staircases, a secret attic hideaway, an ancient family Bible in the library, a coach house full of carriages and sleighs, it all but immerses you in castoffs from a rich and deeply rooted past that most of us can only dream of remembering. It also fails as a movie, but not dishonorably, and not without scoring some local successes along the way.The heroine is the young, very pregnant widow of a flier killed in Vietnam, who goes to visit her husband's mother, whom she has never seen, on a call of obligatory sympathy. She gets a lessthan-cordial reception from the mother, and discovers a miserable simple-minded teen-age sister-in-law she never knew existed. But it is only when, faced with a deepening blizzard, she is forced to spend the night and realizes with sleepy horror that someone has drugged her bedtime cocoa, that she is in present danger  and from more than just a hardhearted mother-in-law.The story that follows is full of holes and not too full of surprises, and it is all developed in a screenplay that might most charitably be described as awkward. There is a schematic simplicity to the plot that feels more like television than the movies.But there is also a visual density that is genuinely cinematic and that makes location shooting (in a real turn-of-the-century mansion in Minnesota) seem worthwhile. And the almost complete absence of false leads and tricky terror tactics suggests the kind of ground-level faith in situations and events that is the beginning of true morality in the movies.Along with its several virtues of omission, ""You'll Like My Mother"" shares in the respect for character and performance typical in Lamont Johnson's movies ""(The McKenzie Break,"" ""The Groundstar Conspiracy,"" etc.)of which this is, in my experience, the worst. Patty Duke is expressive and surprisingly restrained as the young widow who must keep her wits about her. As her mother-in-law, Rosemary Murphy portrays a somewhat attractive villainess with an intelligent competence that is probably the best thing in the film.But I especially admired a new, rather lovely actress namedtoo perfectlySian Barbara Allen, who plays the simple-minded girl with more direct sympathy and less nonsense than you might expect in a movie the aim of which is to scare you.""You'll Like My Mother"" opened yesterday at several local theaters.",1972-10-21T05:00:00+0000

Not that Updike presents us with an American suburbia tenanted by untidy misers (though some of his characters are deep in clutter). On the contrary, he is astute enough to detect that a distaste for litter is one of the fostering emotions in much American suburban life.

It took him seven years to put it all together, picking up items that he liked here and there as he chanced upon themand never worrying about conflicting styles or periods. Nevertheless, the whole look hangs together. The secret is two part. First, the designer's dramatic sense of scale. For an example, just glance at the huge baroque console in front of the living room window (bottom of facing page). And second, his sense of color. The whole house has an unusually fresh color palette. The living room, for instance, combines Chinese yellow draperies with a softer yellow carpet, rose sofa and walls lacquered in wine plaid.

Paradoxically, Meany was not fond of Humphrey either, as Joseph Goulden points out, Meany's nickname for H.H.H. was Mushhead.

Ground for divorce? Not at all. Frank, who's trying to work, displays only a mild irritation with this sort of wisdom. It may be, of course, that he suspects that Faye is a bit nutty and should be humored.At least the audience is led to think that Faye is nutty, but then any mother with two children as noisy and willful as hers might well be ready for a straitjacket. Even when the kids jump around and block her vision while she's driving the car, the patient Faye just laughsand smashes into the rear end of a truck.Two writers, Sidney Buchman and Eleanor Perry, are given official credit for the screenplay, but I've been told that three other people also worked on it at one time or anotherRing Lardner Jr., Daniel Boulanger and Clement himself. Which may explain some of the screenplay's ludicrous inconsistencies (is the film being told from Faye's point of view, from Frank's, from Clement's?) and the way in which vital information is stitched into the dialogue, in patches, like desperate afterthoughts designed to make the story hold up.Nothing really works, though. Not the performances (including a walk-on by the usually fine Maurice Ronet), nor the direction by a man who once made interesting films (""Forbidden Games,"" ""Purple Noon"").

The basic quirks and prerequisites of such a story are very familiar, and ""Beware of the Brethren"" offers no surprises beyond the surprise of how a young man (Tony Beckley) brought up in such a bath of standard stage diction from Ann Todd (his mother) and Patrick Magee (the preacher) could come out of it all speaking so much Cockney.Normally, I abhor superlatives, but at the very least ""Beware of the Brethren"" is the worst film I have seen all month. A failure even in promoting sex and violence, it is a veritable textbook example of how not to work for suspense, or terror, or titillation, or whatever unspeakable pleasure drives you to the movies.Several special-interest groups will have complaints against the film, all of them valid. Feminists will hate it because it demeans women. Believers will deplore it because it degrades religion. And movie lovers will despise it because the ineptitude of its technique pushes the art or cinema back a good 20 years before D. W.

What dark power threatens them all? Bradbury celebrates Halloween: revels in gloom and doom, then disappointingly backs off to lay the splendid ghosts of man's imaginings with an uncharacteristic burst of sentimentality.

us,' Play It as It Lays' Comes to the Screen,"At the age of 30, Maria (pronounced Mar-EYE-ah) Wyeth is driving her Camaro toward disaster on that great Southern California freeway called Life. Her daughter is retarded. Her mother and father, not seen for years, have died in the desert, searching for rainbows that now end in missile ranges. Her marriage to Carter Lang, one of Hollywood's most promising young directors, is on the rocks. Carter won fame directing Maria in ""Angel Beach,"" but now he's less interested in Maria's moods than in his career, and in giving interviews about the geography of the human heart.Maria's only friend is B. Z., Carter's producer, a man who has found incontrovertible evidence that life means zero. When B. Z. decides to take an overdose of Seconals, Maria refuses to fetch him the necessary glass of water, but, with understanding and sorrow, she holds him as he drifts into death. Why does Maria go on? Why not? she says.Joan Didion's highly regarded novel, ""Play It as It Lays,"" is so full of accurately observed details, and it's so relentlessly single-minded and tough as it charts the breakdown of its heroine, that I, for one, am not particularly bothered by this maraschino cherry of wisdom that one finally finds at the bottom. Getting to it has been more than half of the fun.This is not quite true with Frank Perry's film version, based on a screenplay by Miss Didion and John Gregory Dunne (Miss Didion's husband). The film is beautifully performed by Tuesday Weld as Maria and Anthony Perkins as B.Z., but the whole thing has turned soft, for reasons that I should have thought Miss Didion might have considered when she was working on the screenplay.The novel is nothing if not leanChapter 78 is 28 words long. Physical things and people are seldom described except in terms of feelings and effects. Which is the kind of novel it is. Even the layout of the book reflects the state of Maria's mindthere is something shocking about all of that white space on pages that otherwise contain only two or three lines of type.Movies, however, are different from novels, and Mr. Perry and his screenwriters have found no visual equivalent to Miss Didion's prose. There are no blank spaces in the film, and the images we see on the screen are not the banal images of Miss Didion's prose. They are banal images that have been transformed by the camera eye into terribly fancy art.The eye is dazzled in all the wrong ways. The dreadful Los Angeles freeway becomes, on screen, when seen from a helicopter, a magnificent op art design  graceful gray loops on which tiny spots of red, yellow and aquamarine zoom in mindless motion.We never have much time to get inside Maria's mind because we're so busy reacting in our own ways to everything Maria pays no attention to  to the meals uneaten, to the heated swimming pool unswum in, to the magnificent desert sunsets and sunrises unnoticed, to the glamorous parties that are supposed to be boring, to the expensive cars that are driven so badly I wonder how they last a week.Going to pieces this way doesn't seem all that terrifying, just extravagant. ""Play It as It Lays"" is so chic and elegant looking (Roy Lichtenstein was a visual consultant) that it reminds me of a charity ball for mental health. The cause is a good one, but it seems to be the last thing on anybody's mind at the moment. Unlike the novel, which evokes pity, the film is more likely to evoke pure, unadulterated envy.In addition to Miss Weld and Mr. Perkins, the cast includes Tammy Grimes, Adam Roarke and Ruth Ford. The film opened yesterday at the Beekman.",1972-10-30T05:00:00+0000
