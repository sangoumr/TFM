He or she does not spit back at you the venom that keeps you in your state of oppression and ignorance. Q-Tip, of the rap group Tribe Called Quest, has a rap called ""Sucka' Nigga,"" which speaks of the derivation of the term ""nigga,"" how it is now used and the implications of its employment. He talks about how the term prevents growth and admits the trouble he has in removing the word from his own vocabulary. But he is not validating or perpetrating its use and, in fact, gives it a new meaning. That is education. I'm not saying that all rap should preach, but calling Ice Cube a teacher is misrepresentation. He may in fact be ""growing"" and I'm happy to see his ""evolution,"" but the term teacher connotes so much more. ZUHAIRAH KHALDUN New York, N.Y.",1994-05-01T05:00:00+0000

us,The Art of Being There,"Robert Irwin belongs to that small corps of artists, scientists and philosophers who aspire to change the way we see the world. His subjects are time and the experience of perception. His materials are light, sound, scrim, string, dirt and space -- what he calls the incidental phenomena of the everyday. Like the work of many of his contemporaries in the late 1950's, Mr. Irwin's early canvases were gestural and abstract, though they rapidly evolved, by the early 1960's, into minimal paintings of subtle optical effect. It was not until the early 1970's, having grown discontented with the material limitations of painting, that he changed his course. Forswearing canvas and frame, studio and the gallery system, Mr. Irwin retreated to the desert, where he began to conceive of the ephemeral, site-specific works that would drive his imagination for the next two decades. Now the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles has mounted a traveling exhibition of Mr. Irwin's art, for which it has produced an ambitious catalogue, ROBERT IRWIN (Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles/Rizzoli, paper, $40). The entire project is not without a certain irony, however. After all, as the journalist Lawrence Weschler points out in his evocative essay, Mr. Irwin's art is all about the experience of being there, of seeing the work in situ, which is impossible given the secondary nature of photographs. Indeed, because of the ineffable quality of Mr. Irwin's art, it is hardly surprising that the book's photographs tell the reader little about the essence of the artist's vision. Happily, however, the seven supporting essays more than compensate. With one exception -- a droning, jargon-filled piece by the painter Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe -- all are well written and brimming with insight, offering an invaluable record of this visionary artist's evolution.

Back when a plane ticket was a luxury item, not a well-worn commodity like a pair of jeans, airlines used to make a lot of money. But then came rough-and-tumble upstarts like Southwest, and travelers discovered they could save money. Other airlines have attacked costs to some extent -- whether giving workers part ownership in return for concessions, or creating separate no-frills mini-airlines. But last week Delta -- which has few union workers -- said, in effect, that it was starting from scratch, announcing a drastic cutback of up to 15,000 workers, 20 percent of its force. The goal: cut costs by $2 billion a year -- to get its crucial cost for a ""seat mile"" way down from among the industry's highest.

The markets hate job numbers that are too strong, because they're afraid the inflation bells will go off -- though no one's actually seen any inflation -- and the Federal Reserve will clamp down again. So on Friday's surprising report that unemployment fell to 6.4 percent and 267,000 payroll jobs were added in April (to top it off, without the truckers' strike that would have been 73,000 higher), the stock and bond markets went into mourning. The Dow industrials, off more than 50 at one point, lost 26, while 30-year Treasury bond yields hit 7.54 percent, an 18-month high. . . . Even as the job numbers soar, though, there are dark spots: New York State has lost 97,000 jobs in 12 months, a worse performance even than California.

What Manet Saw","From the austerity of ""Portrait of M. and Mme.

In her very pleasant EDOUARD MANET (Bucknell University, $95), Vivien Perutz explains that barely a decade later, the new avant-garde of Monet, Degas and Impressionism forever changed the treatment of outdoor light and of the significant detail of modern life. Ms. Perutz's generous scholarship shares knowledge and pleasure. The author, an English art historian, enrolls critics from Charles Baudelaire to T. J. Clark to assess the extent of Manet's realistic and modernistic canvases. Above all, Manet's ""exceptionally acute visual judgment"" explodes with astonishing detail in more than 50 gorgeous color reproductions. In ""Argenteuil"" (1874), for instance, a young couple spend Sunday outside the city; Manet conveys the day's sweetness, luminosity and breeziness without a trace of effort.

Instead of having tourists drive from the airport in rented cars, would it not make sense for the hotels to provide bus service from the airport to the hotel for people traveling from Europe, in particular? If the hotels do not provide this service, then the airports or the tourist office might take up the slack. Thus, travelers could be protected in a large and even a secured vehicle, which would insure their arrival in safety to their destination, be it even 50 miles or more from the airport. Individual drivers in rented cars being such targets, it makes sense to decrease this mode of travel.",1994-05-08T05:00:00+0000

But the traders cited optimism that the dollar had stopped falling against the yen, as the result of support from many nations' central banks, saying they expected this to help stabilize stock prices.",1994-05-09T05:00:00+0000

The band's set also followed no fixed path as it meandered from folksiness to blare, then abandoned any momentum while Mr. Gelb decided on the next song.

us,NEWS SUMMARY,"International A2-7 DETAILS ON NEW HAITI POLICY President Clinton named a new envoy to Haiti, a well-known black Democrat, and discussed details of the new policy of allowing asylum hearings for Haitian refugees. A1 HAITI ABUSES QUESTIONED President Clinton reaffirmed his support for the exiled President of Haiti, but a cable from the American Ambassador there has charged that the President's supporters exaggerated human rights abuses. A7 A fast over Haiti policy was worth it, an activist said. A7 THE TOLL OF WAR IN ANGOLA In Angola's rebel stronghold, life is a struggle, with no electricity or running water and little food or medicine, but the potential wealth of the country allows one of Africa's longest civil wars to continue. A1 IMPATIENCE IN JERICHO The Israeli occupation is supposed to end in Jericho, but so far little has changed. The first contingent of the Palestinian police force was just six miles away, though, awaiting the signal to enter the area. A1 An international force went to Hebron to keep order. A3 SOUTH AFRICA'S CHALLENGE Two men with very different backgrounds have responsibility in South Africa's new Cabinet for a complex task: improving the lives of the new electorate while protecting the stability of the economy. A6 THE BASIC ISSUE IN BOSNIA News Analysis: the town of Brcko, seen as the next flash point of Bosnian conflict, is also a sign of why the war is unlikely to end soon: Muslims are fighting to go home to areas cleared by the Serbs. A2 HEADING FOR BRAZIL American business people are flocking to Brazil in a new display of confidence that economic ties between the two nations will revolve around trade and investment. D1 Ex-Communists were ahead in Hungary's elections. A5 A businessman was winning Panama's presidential elections. A5 Seoul Journal: In North's shadow, picnics, not panic. A4 National A8-14 PRESSURE ON THE FED The Federal Reserve is preparing to raise short-term rates for the fourth time in four months, but it is under pressure to act more quickly and more sharply this time. A1 LOOKING OUT FOR ONE'S INTERESTS The underlying story of why the Clinton Administration backed away from a proposed gambling tax to pay for part of the welfare plan illustrates the way the capital is patrolled by vigilant, organized interest groups. A1 CRITICISM BY GAY SERVICEMEN The ""don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue"" policy may have made life worse for homosexuals in the military, polarizing attitudes toward homosexuals and shifting the burden of proof to service members accused of engaging in homosexual acts. A1 SETBACK FOR DOMESTIC PARTNERS Voters in Austin, Tex., have repealed a policy granting health benefits for the partners of homosexual and unmarried city employees, making the city the first of roughly 20 communities in the nation with such benefits to repeal its program. A8 NEW BATTLE WAGED AT GETTYSBURG A dispute over the loss of part of the Gettysburg battlefield is the outgrowth of a long-running debate over just how much land should be set aside in the shrine to thousands of Union and Confederate dead. A8 DESEGREGATING HIGHER EDUCATION At issue in a Federal trial in Oxford, Miss., is how the historically black public institutions of higher learning will be treated as their formerly all-white counterparts are often attracting the cream of the crop of black students. A10 REACTION TO ASSAULT WEAPON BAN One freshman Republican Congressman and his staff in mostly Democratic Long Beach, Calif., found little passion over the assault weapons bill, and most constituents, worried above all about crime, seemed to support the ban. A12 SEXUAL HARASSMENT RE-EXAMINED America has again been plunged into a national seminar on sexual harassment, a migraine issue full of gray areas and her-word-against-his contentions, with Prof. Anita Hill and Senator Bob Packwood now providing commentary. A12 EMERGING FORCE IN HEALTH CARE Robert Reischauer's Congressional Budget Office has no vote on health care legislation, but he and his team of analysts have emerged as a crucial voice in the current debate, with more influence at the moment than many lawmakers.

Powers, the Deputy Mayor for operations, is the strongest second-in-command at City Hall in years. He is the point man on both policy and on politics, roles traditionally split.

Agassi, committing an unusual number of unforced errors, was beaten by unseeded Stefano Pescosolido of Italy, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3. Agassi, who returned to action this year after a five-month layoff with a wrist injury, was hoping to round into form in time for the French Open, which begins later this month.

Look at last week's numbers: consumer prices rose just 0.1 percent in April, while at the producer level inflation vanished altogether, with prices actually falling 0.1 percent. In addition, retail sales were down for the month, and initial jobless claims took an unexpected turn upward. But is all this going to stop the Federal Reserve from raising rates yet again when it meets on Tuesday? The financial markets don't seem to think so, for even though bond rates fell a bit and stocks rose on the price reports, there was no euphoria.

Yonville is in ""a bastard region whose speech is without accentuation as its scenery is without character."" There is little to do there, and less to see -- hence Emma's fatal ennui.

He tries to use plain language and everyday examples, for instance using the need to fill a car with gas to make an argument of logic. He makes few appeals to emotion, but he is passionate about making the law available to people and cites a need for flexibility from the bench.

But after eight seasons of cruising -- and 15 Emmy Awards -- the keys are being taken out of the ignition. The last episode of will be broadacst on Thursday. That means no more evolution of the struggles for power within McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney & Becker, no more courtroom dramas over trendy issues, no more intra-office sexual politics. For those who like to speculate on what might have been, The New York Times asked several actors who had starred in the series to envision what would have happened to their characters. SUZANNE O'CONNOR Richard Dysart, who played Leland McKenzie, the fatherly senior partner and sometimes peacemaker in office struggles ""Leland will retire, but actively. He'll take over as the chief justice of the California State Supreme Court. He'll find and marry a younger lady - but not as young as the recent law school graduate he was linked with - perhaps an attorney, since the law is so much of his life. He'll still socialize with Kelsey and Markowitz. And because of Rosalind Shays, he'll stay away from elevators."" Alan Rachins, who played Douglas Brackman, Jr., the stuffy, vain, sometimes insufferable partner ""The first thing Douglas will do is fight to save the firm. After that's stabilized, either successfully or in failure, he'll take time to restock and rethink. With Leland gone, he'll have a new sense of freedom, and come into his own. He and Sheila will go on safari in Africa. Then, to cement their relationship, they'll take tango lessons. He'll coach his son's basketball team, and continue to fight for the rights of people."" Corbin Bernsen, who played Arnie Becker, the philandering specialist in divorce law. ""It all depends on whether he stays in the firm or not. Arnie is a little boy in search of what it means to be a ""man"" -- wife, children and so forth...and be pained by not getting it. So he'll probably always have his cars and his women, unless something major happens to make him face his deepest rooted fear of death, like the death of his mother."" Susan Ruttan, who played Roxanne Melman, the long-suffering, motherly receptionist ""She went on to have a set of twins. She and David work together on direct-mail, environmentally correct baby items. They've worked it all out, and she's still using her secretarial skills, but as her own boss now. You never really, really get over your first love, and she'll never really get over Arnie. David knows and accepts this -- he's changed, he's a really nice guy now."" A Martinez, who played David Morales, a heart-throb litigator ""David traded in his Volvo for a Jeep, all the Armani for blue jeans and boots, and moved to Texas to start a rock and roll band with former members of the Sir Douglas Quintet."" Larry Drake, who played Benny Stulwicz, the gentle, retarded office messenger. ""Benny's future will be more of the same. He may be looking for a job -- although he's more limited than most people -- and he'll do his damnedest to stay employed. He's just made the biggest purchase he's ever made (a racehorse), and it'll be interesting to see how he and his wife deal with winning. He'll be fine.

us,Graphically Absurd,"For a nation whose art was dominated by turgid Socialist Realism, Poland during the 1950's and 60's was the wellspring of modern posters. The Polish school of graphic art was noteworthy for its reprise and synthesis of Dada and Surrealism into a symbolic language that was at once playful and subversive. Roman Cieslewicz, a master of the Polish school, reinvigorated prewar Surrealism through his wit and humor. His eclectic typography, at various times influenced by Russian Constructivism, the Bauhaus, Art Nouveau and Art Moderne, and absurdist conceptual collages reminiscent of Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp, helped revitalize a moribund visual culture. Perhaps he was too influential, for Poland allowed him to emigrate to Paris in 1963, where he first took a job as a layout designer and illustrator for Elle, and was soon sought after as a freelance designer of book jackets, posters, advertisements and screen prints. Mr. Cieslewicz did not invent the photo-collage, but judging from his late Polish and later French work he was certainly its pre-eminent modern practitioner. Margo Rouard-Snowman's ROMAN CIESLEWICZ (Thames and Hudson, paper, $29.95) is an extensive catalogue of his best-known pieces -- from the sarcastic covers of the magazine Opus International to the haunting collages about human cruelty that illustrate a 1988 edition of Anatole France's novel ""The Gods Are Thirsty."" The brief texts at the beginning of each chronological section and an interview with the artist by Ms. Rouard-Snowman, who teaches graphic design at the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, tersely explain motives and methods, but the book would be valuable if only for the extraordinary record (from 1955 to the present) of Mr. Cieslewicz's impressive output.

""I was hoping for more rain, or more hot weather, or wind,"" said Unser, whose wishes came true yesterday as warm, humid and windy weather kept his teammate and chief rival, Emerson Fittipaldi, from knocking him off the pole for the 78th Indianapolis 500. ""The difference is the weather,"" said Unser, whose four-lap, 10-mile average of 228.011 miles an hour on Saturday held up for his first Indy pole. Fittipaldi came up short at 227.303 yesterday, good for the outside of the front row for the May 29 race. Fittipaldi, the two-time and defending Indy winner, and the 1969 winner Mario Andretti were among seven drivers who made qualifying attempts yesterday during an extension of the first of four days of time trials, made necessary because of rain on Saturday. Each of the entries that drew for a position in the first-day qualifying order was guaranteed one shot at the pole when track activity resumed Sunday. Fittipaldi had been favored to beat Unser, his Marlboro Team Penske teammate, for the coveted pole, worth more than $130,000 in cash and prizes. Raul Boesel of Brazil, driving one of the five Dick Simon-owned cars that made successful attempts on the first day, wound up between Unser and Fittipaldi at 227.618. By the end of yesterday's session, 30 of the 33 positions were filled, with additional qualifications scheduled next Saturday and Sunday. Once the field is full, faster cars can bump out the slowest qualifiers until the end of the time trials.

But last week it moved decisively, not only raising the Federal funds rate by half a point, but also lifting the discount rate the same amount after leaving it unchanged for nearly two years, and banks quickly lifted prime rates, too. The markets loved this decisiveness, with the Dow industrials soaring 95 points in four days and long-bond yields falling. Perverse? Not really. If short-term rates reach a level the markets can live with, the thinking goes, then investors won't worry about long-term inflation.

us,Face to Face With Bergman,"Ingmar Bergman once described to the critic Charles Thomas Samuels a passion ""to create light: light and faces surrounded by shadows."" The great director told John Simon that he wanted audiences just ""to sit down and look at the human face."" Many of these all-too-human faces -- often tragic, sometimes comic; often tormented, sometimes at peace -- are on display in INGMAR BERGMAN: Film and Stage (Abrams, $45). The subtitle is misleading: Robert Emmet Long's sensible text briefly summarizes and analyzes every film Mr. Bergman has written or directed, but only those stage productions that have traveled to New York in recent years receive more than a polite nod. The book contains plenty of shots of Mr. Bergman at work, though most of the more than 200 photographs are taken from his movies. ""Fanny and Alexander"" and ""The Magic Flute"" are amply illustrated, in color as well as in black and white, while masterpieces like ""Winter Light"" and ""The Passion of Anna"" are slighted. There is a splendid two-page reproduction of the dance of death from ""The Seventh Seal,"" yet turn the page to ""Wild Strawberries"" and you won't find a single image from the opening dream sequence. ""Now About These Women,"" which Mr. Long says ""is commonly considered Bergman's worst film,"" gets more picture space than ""Persona,"" which is possibly his best. The captions are occasionally instructive and occasionally erroneous (if that's Erland Josephson on page 119, I'm August Strindberg). Mr. Long, the author of ""The Films of Merchant Ivory,"" writes about Mr. Bergman's ""intense preoccupation with women, perceived with a ripe sensuousness."" Thus it is no surprise that the stars of this book are remarkable actresses like Liv Ullmann and the magnificent Anderssons, Harriet and Bibi. Ingmar Bergman's God may be silent, but those three deities are pure eloquence. DAVID KELLY",1994-05-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Joined at the Hip,"Monday. I am going to have hip replacement surgery. Elizabeth Taylor is also going to have a hip replacement. Like Liz, I will not divulge the date of the operation. Like Liz, I am going to have the surgery in an undisclosed hospital. Perhaps we will have our surgery on the same undisclosed date in the same undisclosed hospital. Liz and I have so much in common: an early, girlish enthusiasm for collies and horses; and we're both Jewish, of course. Now this -- identical prostheses. Tuesday. I hope Liz and I won't have to have any bone grafts. In the pamphlet the hospital sent me, it says they sometimes take bone for bone graft from some part of your own body, which sounds counterproductive; or they ""harvest it from other sources."" Harvest has a nice folksy autumn ring to it. But I think the other sources from which they harvest it are cadavers. Wednesday. Had to give blood to be stored up in case I need it during the operation. I was asked a lot of personal questions. A funny nurse told me about the time she swallowed her contact lenses in college, couldn't afford a new pair and had to retrieve them. I ate some Oreos and it was over. If I don't use the blood, it goes into the blood bank. What if Liz ended up with my blood? We'd be linked for life, though I would never presume to mention it. I would remain anonymous. Thursday A.M. It said in the paper that patients with living wills, who leave instructions to have the plug pulled when they're brain dead, have lower hospital bills. I have a living will, and was very excited about this at first. Then I realized they probably had lower hospital bills because they died earlier than people who don't have living wills. I'm sure Liz has a living will. I read a biography about her that said she'd had 32 operations, and that was years ago. Who knows how many she's had by now? She's a pro. Was Liz given a packet of Betadine and told to wash herself with it at home the night before her operation, the way I was? What about the Fleets? It gives the whole experience a nice do-it-yourself feeling. My bathroom smells like Betadine now, just like the hospital. I saw an ad for Elizabeth Taylor's perfume. ""Fragrant Jewels,"" it said. When you buy a bottle, there's a bonus: a pair of 3.2-carat cubic zirconia earrings. I don't have zirconia earrings of that size, or any size, yet. I do have a little cabochon emerald ring that I bought from Christopher Walling before he became a jeweler to sheiks and movie stars. It doesn't seem to have a fragrance, actually. I love jewelry; and if I had a lot of it, I'd have that in common with Liz, too. I once read in The New York Post that Liz might have been the anonymous bidder who paid $104,000 for Christopher's rose diamond earrings. The resemblance is getting uncanny. P.M. Better start packing. Tomorrow is the big day. What do you wear in the hospital? More to the point -- what will Liz wear? Probably her 3.2 zirconia studs. I think I will pack nothing. The hospital provides suitable attire, and you get those plastic basins and a personal bottle of mouthwash. Towels are included. Green foam-rubber slippers with a happy face embossed on the front. It will be a relief, actually, not to have think to about how I'm dressed. A vacation. Liz must feel the same way -- even more so. For a moment I find it difficult to picture her. Then I see her beautiful shoulders draped with the thin cotton gown, the hospital's undisclosed name printed across the front, and, pinned proudly above it, a bright red AIDS ribbon. Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Thirty-two of these? I can't keep up. I don't want to keep up. I think 32 operations is showing off. Isn't it enough to have the biggest eyes, the biggest diamonds, the most husbands? She has more husbands than Tonya Harding's mother. Why does she have to be so competitive? And my friend who lives in L.A. called to tell me she read that Larry Fortensky (No. 8 for Ms. Matrimony Maven) has not picked up $684.37 in vacation pay. The rich are so careless. He worked 555 hours last year driving a water truck at constructon sites and watering down the dirt. The rich are so thoughtless. He took that work away from someone who might actually need it. And about those perfume bottles with the rhinestone bows -- tacky, tacky, tacky. I hate perfume anyway. I'm allergic to it. It should be against the law in public places and magazines. Elizabeth Taylor is a public menace and a health hazard. And when my collie got lost in New Hampshire, he never came home. And she didn't even star in ""Lassie Come Home."" She had a minor role. Monday. I woke up this morning thinking Elizabeth Taylor was married to Arthur Miller. Then I remembered that was the other one -- the tragic, self-destructive icon. Liz is the indestructible survivor icon. Can't remember much from the last few days. Must have been a little dopey. I have a computerized pump that releases just the right amount of morphine whenever I need it.I'm feeling much better now. I'm really feeling like myself. I did have a bone graft.

On Thursday night at CBGB, the Knack was all of the above. On the one hand, the main reason the band reunited for the first time in four years was to profit from renewed interest in its 1979 No. 1 hit, ""My Sharona,"" which was featured in the recent film ""Reality Bites."" On the other hand, the Knack tried to make fun of its status as a nostalgia band.",1994-05-23T05:00:00+0000

Foyt's decision to stick with the earlier qualifying speed of his driver, Bryan Herta, paid off yesterday at the Indianapolis 500 trials. The car survived four last-minute attempts to bump it out of the 33-car lineup for the race next Sunday. With 25 minutes left in qualifying, Marco Greco bumped Scott Goodyear with a four-lap, 10-mile run of 221.216 miles an hour in a Lola-Cosworth. After Greco qualified, Herta, Foyt's rookie driver, was the top man on the bump list as the slowest remaining car. Geoff Brabham then called off his run after three laps because he was going too slow. Mark Smith then spun and crashed in the first turn of his first lap. Gary Bettenhausen then ran two laps but called off the run as too slow. At that point, Foyt could have sent Herta out in a faster spare car, but he thought that Willy T. Ribbs, the only challenger left, did not have enough laps in his car to go fast enough. Foyt's decision worked, as Ribbs quit after two laps that were too slow.

Ocean Producer is a floating production, storage and offloading system.The remainder of the earnings decline was primarily attributable to a reduction in demand for its oilfield marine services which occurred in the last six months, the company said. Revenues for these services were down 4 percent for the year and 27 percent during the fourth quarter as compared to last year, the company said.These reductions were due in part to oil company project delays caused by the steep drop in oil prices which started in November 1993. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, the company also incurred about $ 1.5 million of pretax charges due to legal costs, receivable write-downs and what it said was ''a particularly unprofitable performance on a job.''",1994-05-24T05:00:00+0000

A hummingbird drinks with a W-shape tongue, licking nectar up as a cat might (but faster). Like a tiny drum roll, its heart beats at 500 times a minute. Frighten a hummingbird and its heart can race to over 1,200 times a minute. Feasting and flying, courting and dueling, hummingbirds consume life at a fever pitch. No warm-blooded animal on earth uses more energy, for its size. But that puts them at great peril. By day's end, wrung-out and exhausted, a hummingbird rests near collapse.",1994-05-29T05:00:00+0000

They're a favorite of Rollerbladers, who in warm weather are known to make them into cutoffs. Their popularity has much to do with comfort, function and inexpensive price (there's no celebrity designer label on the back pockets). The fashion industry has been trying since the 1960's to design a one-piece garment that doesn't inconvenience women when they have to go to the bathroom and that isn't limited to a one-size-fits-all crotch. With overalls, at least, they don't have to struggle out of sleeves, and adjustable suspenders allow the wearer to establish a comfortable crotch.

And the Beats Go On","In his brief introduction to SNAPSHOT POETICS: A Photographic Memoir of the Beat Era (Chronicle, paper, $12.95), a collection of nearly 100 black-and-white photographs by the poet Allen Ginsberg, the German writer Michael Kohler characterizes these pictures as ""intimate snapshots with the quality of Joycean epiphanies, preserving those instants that express something of the sublimity or sanctity of our experience."" Mr. Kohler's claim is not hyperbole; sublimely recorded here is a group, the Beats, and a time, the 1950's. Mr. Ginsberg was not then, in his words, ""a big picture taker"": he produced only 30 rolls of film between 1953 and 1963. Explaining why he took the pictures at all, Mr. Ginsberg writes that he simply ""had a sacramental sense of these friends."" Encouraged and taught by such renowned photographers as Robert Frank and Berenice Abbott, Mr. Ginsberg developed into a gifted pictorial chronicler. Among the most appealing of these photographs (each accompanied by a caption handwritten by the photographer) is the ""heroic portrait"" of Jack Kerouac smoking a cigarette on a fire escape in New York City. Another shot shows Neal Cassady and Natalie Jackson embracing beneath a movie marquee advertising Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One."" The book also features the now-famous photograph of Lawrence Ferlinghetti and his dog, Whitman, in San Francisco's City Lights Bookstore; portraits of such usual suspects as William Burroughs and Gregory Corso; and several fine, unflinching self-portraits. Snappily designed, ""Snapshot Poetics"" is an evocative riff on a specific slice of time in American literary history.ROBIN LIPPINCOTT",1994-05-29T05:00:00+0000

Price's 8-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole at the Colonial Country club capped a comeback from a seven-shot deficit in the final round and made him the PGA Tour's first double winner of the year. He earlier won the Honda Classic. When play was halted on Sunday, Simpson led at 14 under par with seven holes left. He finished off a no-birdie round of 71 for a 266 total. Price birdied the first two holes he played en route to a 64-266. In the playoff, Simpson hit his approach to about 20 feet, then left his birdie putt short. Price boldly went at the flag with an 8-iron from 153 yards out and later made the 8-foot birdie. (AP) Olazabal Makes Up Ground: Jose Maria Olazabal made up a three-stroke, final-round deficit with five birdies on the last eight holes to win the European PGA Championship in Virginia Water, England.
