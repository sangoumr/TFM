The avantgarde leaders of the midfifties, Beckett, Ionesco, Genet, Pinter, Albee, are today settled into a cultural mainstream which is amazingly unruffled by newer tributaries. In England, despite a rash of under30 playwrights, I can think of only oneHeathcote Williamswho would be properly classified as avantgarde. In Germany, there are Peter Handke and Rainer Fass binder. In America, an avantgarde writer is more often than not, a young man still working off the influences of Beckett or Genet, but in most cases, the more interesting new writers (John Guare, Israel Horovitz, Jason Miller) are traditionally, rather than experimentally, based.",1972-12-03T05:00:00+0000

Of the 11 films on the program, the longest (""You Do."" made in 1971) runs for only 12 minutes. But it is always valuable to see what has been going on in an artist's mind over a long period of great productivity. In this case, I only wish that more had been going on.Stan Vanderbeek, born in 1931, belongs in the middle generation of the independent American cinema, and he has long been one of its best-known film makers. I suspect that a good many New York moviegoers who may never have heard of underground film know something of collage animation solely through a slightly famous and very funny ""no smoking"" trailer that Vanderbeek did about 10 years ago for the Bleecker Street Cinema.Collage animation, an animation of previously drawn or photographed pictures, is probably Vanderbeek's most widely seen specialty. But he is a very active experimentalist in film-making (and film projection, as in his bubble-shaped Movie-Drome, built at Stony Point, N.Y.), and the Film Forum show includes various kinds of computerized animation, as well as two films, ""Summit"" (1963) and ""Video Space"" (1972), that combine live actors and dancers with animation.The problem is that, for all the experimentation, there seems to have been relatively little growth in personal vision. Despite its exploitation of new electronic technology, ""Who Ho Rays,"" made in 1972, is if anything safer and less inventive than ""Mankinda,"" made in 1957, very nearly at the start of Vanderbeek's career.But at least one of the recent films, ""Symmetricks,"" an elaboration of brilliant white lines and flashes against a black background, made in collaboration with Wade Shaw at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is very good. And ""Poem Field #8,"" one of several films made together with the computer scientist Ken Knowlton in the mid-1960's, has an agreeable decorative agility that suggests considerable delight in the medium.My favorite, however, is an early film, ""See Saw Seems"" (1962). It is full of graceful transformations by which, for example, a footbridge becomes an eye that opens to a path that leads to a glowing flower that becomes a body that becomes a gentle landscape, and so on and on. It is all like a pleasant footnote to surrealist art. And it is perhaps in such a minor, by no means dishonorable, position that Stan Vanderbeek belongs.",1972-12-09T05:00:00+0000

This device has been used in the tourist industry in various ways, one being the prepayment of leases on vacation apartments, but now the principle has been given a new twist something called the vacation license. The sponsors of this paynowgolater plan, who say they are the only people offering such a service, invite vacation ers to pay, say, $2,500 and receive re sort accommodations for one week each year for a minimum of 40 years at a stipulated resort. What makes their idea different, the promoters say, is that no investment is involved; the customer is merely buying the right to his vaca tion accommodations.

Meadows for the Club of Rome's Project on the Predicament of Mankind.

In taking excep tion to this conclusion, those who are optimistic about future economic and population growth point out what Meadows's team had already ad mitted: the lack of hard data, the difficulty of modeling the effects of technological innovation and the impossibility of modeling changes in human value systems. In addition, some progrowth ad herents emphasize the potentially disastrous eco nomic consequences of a nogrowth policy; for in stance, Peter Passell and Leonard Ross, writing in this magazine last March 5, conclude: Quite simply, growth is the only way in which America will ever reduce poverty.",1972-12-10T05:00:00+0000

us,"A superhawk remembers, explains and defends himself","W. W. Rostow has written some good books. This is not one of them. Rostow, who served as an adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, 196169, proposes to write the his tory of the years 195772, as one who has had a hand in making it. This is a perfectly legitimate under taking whose ancestry stretches from Thucydides and Julius Caesar to Churchill and Eisenhower. Others, such as Bismarck, have left us a kind of political autobiography by record ing their part in the events and re flecting upon it. Rostow has done neither but has combined the two.The hybrid form, of which this book is neither the first nor likely to be the last example, is bound to make for bad history. For the discipline of the historians' craft within which the historian must labor is vitiated by the author's concern to make sure that the reader does not miss the role he has played, and to justify it. Thus the perspective from which his tory is viewed becomes distorted. What ought to be at the periphery is moved into the center, and what is placed in the center could not pos sibly have been so central as it is made to appear. Much that deserves mention in a work of history is not mentioned at all, and some in formation is so trivial as to be out of place even in an autobiography.Thus we are told that the author was in his bath when President John son called him, and that President elect Kennedy came out of his bath when Rostow called upon him. I do not doubt that these are facts, but they certainly are not historic facts because they are of no interest to posterity. Twice Rostow quotes from remarks he made at a Pugwash Con ference, and he tells us what he said at the debriefing and that he was invited to dinner by one of the Rus sian participants. Many of us have had repeatedly similar experiences without being conscious of their his toric or even autobiographical signif icance. With Vietnam on his mind, Rostow tells us: I left the White House just before noon on Jan. 2, 1969 with the hope that Nixon would decide to stay the course.

De signs inspired by the Orient again cap tured the imagination of the West in the early 19thcentury after the Prince of Wales built the Brighton Pavilion, that fantasy palace and princely sum mer residence. Today's thaw in com munications between East and West has again spawned an interest in Oriental designs, interpreted in a rash of patterns for wallcoverings and fab rics. As in earlier revivals, the quali ties that make these new designs so fresh and vital are the Eastern themes, the mythical dragon and phoenix, stylized blossoms, waves and clouds coupled with the Western flair for composition and color.

us,"Screen: 'Poseidon Adventure' Arrives:Liner Disaster Opens the National Theater Hackman, as Minister, Leads Group to Safety","Someone else's disaster is nearly always fascinating from a reassuring distance. And the maritime cataclysm in ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" which last night opened Broadway's newest showcase, the National Theater (the film is also at the Beekman), is that kind of comforting catastrophe. Most of us are happily far removed from the rare personal experience of having been trapped in a capsized liner. But though tensions slacken and credibility is strained here, realistic technical effects make the stricken ship and the efforts of its survivors to escape a fairly spellbinding adventure.If the likes of ""Titanic"" and ""Airport"" come to mind, it's due to Ronald Neame's workmanlike direction, which accents the script's physical aspects. The ""Poseidon,"" headed for Greece and a wrecking yard on her final, trans-Atlantic voyage is obviously a doomed, seagoing Grand Hotel. And, even when she's overturned by that 90-foot wave, the ship is just as interesting as the terrified, sodden few who desperately struggle upward through a vast, mechanical labyrinth toward her exposed hull and freedom.The authentic opulence of a stately liner has been caught in scenes shot abroad the Queen Mary now permanently berthed in Long Beach, Calif. But the film's constructions of an 'inverted' main dining room, a barber shop, a bathroom and flooded staterooms and engine rooms are equally striking. And simulated terror is given impact by such sequences as the overturning of that dining room and the beleaguered survivors' scrambling and swimming through frighteningly claustrophobic, burning or flooded interiors.The script's simplistic message about the necessity of clinging to life is somewhat less than original, but Gene Hackman is fairly convincing as the stridently physical, militantly liberated minister who forcibly leads the group to safety. An amazingly fat Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson, as a couple en route to Israel, and their grandchildren, contribute a touching vignetta or two in a big cast largely seen in bit roles.Ernest Borgnine, constantly at odds with Hackman, is muscular and earthy as a detective married to Stella Stevens, who plays a refreshingly outspoken, decorative exprostitute.They dominate the merely adequate portrayals of the others clutching for life, including Carol Lynley, as a fear-chilled pop singer; Red Buttons, as a bachelor haber-dasher who aids her; Roddy McDowall, as a wounded steward; and a teen-ager. Pamela Sue Martin, and Eric Shea as her self-sufficient kid brother.Who does or doesn't survive here is, in short, a good deal less gripping than the graphic way it's done.",1972-12-13T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:Museum Opens 'Here Comes Every Body',"The group encounter documentary called ""Here Comes Every Body"" is by far the most interesting feature of this kind I have seen. Some of these soul-baring talk sessions on film have been candid, crashing bores, in the name of truth and cinma vrit (alert the camera and shoot). As the first movie of an English director-producer, John Whitmore, the California-made project does credit to him and to the Whitney Museum, which unveiled the film yesterday for a seven-day run.For one thing, these people have something to say about themselves and one another. They are generally personable and intelligent. Their revelations and confessed hang-ups are tactfully prodded by a wise group director as they gather in a room and relax on the pool terrace of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur. Finally, as Mr. Whitmore's unobtrusive camera concentrates on seven or eight case historiesout of 16 participantsthey seem people worth knowing. Their tears, when they flow, matter. So do the exploding tensions and fears. Finally, they speak plain English, with explicit, obscene shortcuts.The one we especially liked was a fading, 44-year-old woman  warm-hearted, fatwho yearns for children, we learn, and ""was once young and beautiful."" In the most touching moment she wails, ""Where has it all gone?""One genial young man, a frank homosexual, berates his hypersensitivity with a directness that is downright manly. An older, baldish man learns to cushion his strikeout hostility. Of the troubled couples, two attractive youngsters are as winning as they are candid.The whole thing leaves a frank, stimulating taste.

us,Screen: A Love Triangle:Montand Starred With Schneider in 'Cesar',"There has never been anything in the furiously energetic course of American movie-making to match the settled materialism of that particularly French phenomenon, an upper-bourgeois cinema, manifested in such films as Louis Malle's ""Murmur of the Heart"" or, much, less anarchically, in the work of Claude Sautet.Sautet is known here through some screenwriting credits but mainly through his own movie, ""The Things of Life"" (1969). Yesterday, his ""Cesar and Rosalie,"" which comes billed as the rage of Paris opened at the Paris Theater in New York.""Cesar and Rosalie"" is a love triangle, with complications. Rosalie, formerly married to Antoine (her child's father), was actually in love with David, who let her marry Antoine and then disappeared.Now, after five years, David mysteriously reappears. But Rosalie is in love with Cesar, a middle-aged man whom she does not live with but often visits. Unavoidably, Rosalie is drawn back to David, then back to Cesar and so onand we have, in fairly rapid succession, arrangements of Cesar and Rosalie; David and Rosalie; Cesar, David and Rosalie; and even Cesar and David for a period when Rosalie figures that self-exile in Switzerland might be more sanitary.Cesar (Yves Montand) is a scrap-metal dealer, but with such success and on such a scale that his junkyard sounds like international finance. He is always calling on Rosalie to do translations. He is a self-made man: lean, cigar-smoking, fast-car driving, poker-playing, cognac-drinking, Bach-lovinga well-rounded diamond in the rough.David (Sami Frey) is a handsome young cartoonist, not rich (and not poor), but terribly well known.Everybody adores Rosalie (Romy Schneider), who is beautiful, wistful, agreeable, multilingual, moderately rich and very useful. No emotional crisis can keep Rosalie out of the kitchen, brewing up another pot of coffee or adding a last thoughtful dab of butter to the lobster amricaine. The lobster, of course, has been fresh caught.People live in decent, sometimes terrific apartments. When they are sad, they have good bars to drink in. There are pleasant townhouses and marvelous country houses. And at an important level, surroundings, backgrounds, familiesthe decent appurtenances of living with the upper middle classare what ""Cesar and Rosalie"" is all about.The love story is told with much lyricism, some passion and several bows to the style of ""Jules and Jim"" and ""Two English Girls."" But experiencing it all is somehow like exposure to very good, even subtle, table mannersimpressive but not too involving.There are real virtues in the film. Romy Schneider, for one, who has never been more calmly beautiful; and the exciting, fast country-driving sequences, of which there are several. As a director, Sautet is his best with automobiles, less good with small boats (apparently an interest of his), and with people fairly indifferent.The much-praised performance of Yves Montand seems less a characterization than a construction, carefully considered but very external. ""Cesar and Rosalie"" generally remains on the surface, catching clues and missing sources, like the type of slick magazine fiction to which it belongs.",1972-12-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Tati's Terrific 'Traffic':Tati's Terrific 'Traffic',"IN ""Traffic,"" Jacques Tati's splendidly funny new film at the 68th Street Playhouse, Mr. Hulot exists almost entirely in the middle distance of the screen as a full-length silhouette. From ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" (1954) and ""My Uncle"" (1958), we recognize the figure, tall and a little stooped in the way of some tall men who make posture a form of apology. We recognize the pipe, the jaunty hat, the raincoat of the sort that was popular on American campuses in the 1950s, and the pants that seem to reach only to slightly below mid-calf. Tati has never acted with his face and seldom used close-ups of himself, but in ""Traffic"" the face, which is now 64, is even more vaguely seen than in the earlier filmsits cheerfully bland expression being of less importance and less interest than the outline and movements of the total silhouette.In addition to being exuberantly entertaining (for children, I should think, as well as their generational predecessors), ""Traffic"" explains the essential comedy of Tati as well as the role played in it by Mr. Hulot, sometimes described rather lamely as an average Frenchman coping with an increasingly dehumanized society. Such a description ascribes a lovability to Mr. Hulot that, I suspect, misses the point. In the past, Mr. Hulot has been made lovable by his association with the free-roaming, tail-wagging dogs of Paris, with garrulous street cleaners, and with little boys whose hearts are abrim with fine, practical jokes.There is no such attempt to impose arbitrary lovability on the figure of Mr. Hulot in ""Traffic."" We don't see things through his eyes, nor is there any chance for identification with him, as there always is with Chaplin and Keaton characters. Mr. Hulot, instead, exists as a kind of fixed point in a view finder with which we are able to put the rest of the world into properly hiliarious focus. ""Traffic"" is a very merry sort of film, but the amusement we share is Tati's, not Hulot's, a fact that may seem cold and unsettling to those who insist on mixing two parts of tears with every 10 parts of laughter.It may even be successfully argued that the Mr. Hulot of ""Traffic"" is quite a different character from the Mr. Hulot of ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" and ""My Uncle."" The figure is the same, as are the walk (a kind of broad jumper's stride) and the abrupt way in which Mr. Hulot stops to think, as if he'd suddenly found himself at the edge of an Alp. He's still a certified eccentric, but the character who in ""My Uncle"" seemed to celebrate the joys of nature has become, in ""Traffic,"" an inventor whose product puts him in more or less the same league with the unseen architect who designed the mechanized house in ""My Uncle.""The product is a fantastically accommodating camper car, a collection of marvelous gadgets that do everything but cut bait and fish. It's the sort of camper, in fact, that might possibly lure M. and Mme. Arpels of ""My Uncle"" away from their sanitized modern house  all corners, edges, foot paths and electric eyesto spend a weekend in the country polluting with comfort.All of this can be successfully argued, but to do so is to give more importance to the character of Mr. Hulot than is warranted. Tati's later films are not about little guys. They are amazed, amused, even somewhat loving looks at the absurdities produced during the last days of the consumer revolution.""Traffic"" is about the efforts of Mr. Hulot and his fellow workers at the Altra Company, including a pushy but fondly observed American public relations girl, to get their camper car from the factory in Paris to the International Automobile Show in Amsterdam. Everything goes wrong. They run out of gas. They have flat tires. At one point they must spend a couple of days getting repairs in a small country garage set in the midst of a gigantic auto dump, which is as reassuring as going to a hospital in the middle of a cemetery.These events, however, are just the frames on which Tati places his magnificent gags, some of the funniest of which are simply observations of the great highway community. It's often said that dogs and cats come to look like their masters. In Tati's film, an automobile's windshield wipers take on the properties of the automobile's owner. A tycoon's wipers make positive, decisive thwacks. Those belonging to an elderly driver never quite manage to complete a full sweep. The wipers totter up to a due-north position, then fall back, exhausted.The world Tati sees is slightly mad, full of mimetic rhythms which say less about the dehumanization of society than about the resilience of its members. There is a lovely sequence involving a filling station that insists on giving out big plaster busts of famous personages on the order of Napoleon and Beethoven, even when the cars are packed with parents, children, luggage and pets. Drivers old, young, even-tempered and cranky rise to unexpected heights of politeness when they happen to pile up in a spectacular, multi-car collision. ""Is this your hub-cap?"" ""Oh, thank you. You're too kind.""Which, for reasons I need not go into, cues in one of Tati's most imaginative gags, when Mr. Hulot, trying to scale the wall of a house, loosens the ivy so that it all slips a few feet down in one piece, as if it were a hat pulled over the eyes.""Traffic"" is Tati's fifth feature film, the first being ""Jour de Fete (1948), and it is the fourth to be seen here. ""Playtime,"" made in 1967, has, for some reason, never been released in this country. ""Traffic"" is the very special work of a filmmaker with a unique gift for visual comedy. Like Godard, Tati is also remarkably appreciative of the odd beauty that can be revealed in the shapes, patterns and colors created by the technology of planned obsolescence. For all of the laughter in ""Traffic,"" there are moments when the banal utilitarianism of the super-highway is seen as a work of extraordinary art.",1972-12-17T05:00:00+0000

us,The Age Of Kipling,"In The Age of Kipling, edited by John Gross, there are 20 essays dealing with the life and publications of the writer, from his first days to the post mortems pronounced on the body of his literary work after his death. As with all collections pro duced by different hands, this one is uneven in quality and checkered with contradictory judgments. There are some shamefaced confessions of boyhood devotion; some carefully cal culated middle ground positions (very nearly [lifted] out of the minor rank); and some braver as sertions about the moralist who was a very great artist to be com pared with Ben Jonson, Conrad, Yeats, and on to the great bard him self. Such differences of opinion are, to be sure, one of the merits of this book, for the work of Kipling has always received a mixed response. The greater virtue of this volume, however, is that, in five or six essays, the confusion of judgments is pene tratedto get at what Kipling was actually saying beneath the distract ing dazzle of the way he put words together.",1972-12-17T05:00:00+0000

us,'Heartbreak Kid':Elaine May's 2d Effort as Director Arrives,"Elaine May's ""A New Leaf,"" her first film as a director, was a charming, slightly nutty film with some awkward moments in it. ""The Heartbreak Kid,"" her second, is a first-class American comedy, as startling in its way as was ""The Graduate."" It's a movie that manages the marvelous and very peculiar trick of blending the mechanisms and the cruelties of Neil Simon's comedy with the sense and sensibility of F. Scott Fitzgerald.It begins as a rather familiar New York Jewish comedy about the marriage of Lenny (Charles Grodin), a wide-eyed, completely self-absorbed young man who sells sporting goods, and Lila (Jeannie Berlin), who makes the (it turns out to be) terrible mistake of saving herself for Lenny until their wedding night. ""Was it as good as you'd thought?"" Lila asks in the dark of their Virginia motel room. ""Exactly,"" says Lenny. ""Exactly or better?"" Lila insists. ""Better!"" he cries in desperation.As Lenny recalls their wedding trip later: ""I had my doubts in Virginia. . . . I was pretty sure in Georgia.""Most of their honeymoon takes place in Miami Beach, where Lenny, wearing his matching swimming trunks and beach shirt, meets and falls wildly in love with a beautiful blond WASP from Minnesota named Kelly (Cybill Shepherd). Lila, who has gotten fearfully sunburned their first day, stays in their hotel rooma loud, reproachful voice inside a mound of Solarcaine.""The Heartbreak Kid,"" which opened yesterday at the Sutton, is the story of Lenny's efforts to unload Lila and to pursue Kelly to Minnesota. It suggests Fitzgerald's ""Winter Dreams"" updated to 1972, but now the poor boy from the wrong side of the tracks is a New York Jew, and the unattainable Judy Jones is, ironically and perhaps tragically, all too attainable.The film succeeds in being equally merciless to the unfortunate Lila, who eats Milky Ways in her wedding bed and dribbles egg salad down her chin at breakfast, and to the magnificent-looking Kelly, whose idea of wit is the snarling retort: ""How do you expect me to think when I'm listening?"" Not even Fitzgerald, I think, would have had the chutzpah to have his Judy Jones say to a man who'd just divorced his wife for her: ""Gee! I'm really flattered!""The film, adapted by Neil Simon from a story by Bruce Jay Friedman, is full of more recent echoes, especially in the performance of Jeannie Berlin, Miss May's daughter, who looks, sounds and acts exactly as her mother did as recently as yesterday. It recalls the great performing years of Nichols and May, as does so much of the dialogue, especially when Lenny, dining with Kelly's parents in their huge, clapboard ice palace in Minnesota, tries to say nice things about the ""plain"" food. Food in New York, he expains, ""is exotic but not honest. There's nothing dishonest about these potatoes. There's no deceit in that cauliflower. . .""Charles Grodin inevitably recalls Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate,"" but I hope he won't be faulted for it. It's a perfpmance of completely controlled enthusiasms and puzzlements. As the object, of his unreasonable passion, Miss Shepherd succeeds in the fairly unusual feat of being lovely, bitchy and funny, all more or less simultaneously, and Eddie Albert in the comparatively small role of her father, is a model of superbly comic, quite understandable outrage.""The Heartbreak Kid"" occasionally goes for laughs without shame (which is what has always bothered me about Simon's brand of New York comedy), but behind the laughs there is, for a change, a real understanding of character  which is something that I suspect, can be attribued to Miss May. The film is an unequivocal hit.",1972-12-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Pete 'n' Tillie,' Comedy, Opens at Baronet","Is anybody getting a little tired of Carol Burnett and Walter Matthau? The television queen is all over the home box and has been for some time. Matthau,expertise included, is certainly coming at us thick and fast.Expecting an obvious, strictly-for-laughs showcase in ""Pete 'n' Tillie,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet, one viewer received the jolt of his Christmas season. This is the wittiest, warmest and most ingratiating movie to appear in a long time, with a beautifully sustained and muted edge of sadness.A happy suspicion is that the producer-scenarist, Julius J. Epstein, having latched onto a novel (""Witch's Milk"") by Peter De Vries, a proven humorist, has stuck closely to the dialogue, which is priceless, and the theme, togetherness.Pete 'n' Tillie (miserable title) are two wryly unyouthful San Francisco realists who meet at a party and like each other almost in spite of themselves. They bed down, wed, raise a fine little boy and undergo a numbing family crisis whose restrained, touching treatment is the most admirable thing about the film.For once, a basic comedy absorbs tragedy without an embarrassing ripple. There are more surprises, such as the graceful direction of Martin Ritt, usually plloting much grittier stuffastutely, of course. Then there is Geraldine Page, as Miss Burnett's Iah-de-dah chum, whose brief, mortified pantomime inside a police station is the funniest thing we have seen on film all year. In other roles, Ren Auberjonois, Barry Nelson and little Lee H. Montgomery are also excellent.You won't believe Miss Burnett, with no television mugging and those chipmunk teeth either swallowed or in full retreat. She is grand, even in one bit of tearful ferocity that would tax a Bernhardt. Matthau has given weightier performances but none more disarming. To one viewer, Christmas is already merrier with ""Pete 'n' Tillie"" and company on the scene.",1972-12-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Avanti!,' Another Billy Wilder Farce, Stars Jack Lemmon","For nuance-loving Italians, ""Avanti!"" means, among other meanings, ""Come In!"" ""Let's Go!"" and ""Forward!"" As the latest comedy directed by Billy Wilder and starring Jack Lemmon, which opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and 85th Street, it also translates as intermittently funny, charming, cute and, unfortunately, over-long.In transporting Samuel Taylor's short-lived, 1968 Broadway farce about an American tycoon's entanglement with amore and bureaucracy in Italy, Wilder, Lemmon and I.A.L. Diamond, Wilder's long-time writing teammate on such superb antics as ""Some Like It Hot,"" fitfully charm us but they haven't moved forward at any great comic clip.They have warped some parts of the playwright's plot to give us a fairly reasonable flow of giggles and an occasional guffaw about Mr. Lemmon and Juliet Millsthe tycoon and the plump British lasswho have come to Italy to reclaim the bodies of his father and her mother. And, they've switched the scene from Rome to Ischia, the sunny spa where it was shot in colors warm enough to enchant anyone enslaved to frozen winters and the workaday world.But a viewer is aware almost from the start that the seemingly proper deceased pair, killed in a car accident, were more than casual acquaintances. And it takes an awfully long time for the principals to discover that fact, do their filial duty and finally arrive at a similar, discreet, amorous understanding.There is enough red tape here to handcuff even as powerful a conglomerate king as Jack Lemmon, who thinks he'll be flying back to Baltimore, business, golf and his wife and kids in a jiffy. He handles it all in satisfyingly familiar, confused, frenetic style, despite lead coffins and ransom for the bodies snatched by a local vintner, who knows a good touch when he sees one. And there's a blackmailing photographer who also gums things up by being shot by his Sicilian girl friend.Of course, there's the wise, blond, decorative Miss Mills, whose weight worries don't keep her from getting him to take more than a moment to dine with wine and candlelight, indulge in a moonlight, nude dip and, eventually, a boudoir interlude.Above all, there's a fine job turned in by Clive Revill, as the suave, knowledgeable, carefree hotel manager, who's as helpful with cadavers as he is with lovers, bureaucrats, blackmailers and body snatchers.""Italy is not a country,"" Miss Mills says ecstatically, ""it's an emotion."" But emotion wears thin fairly quickly in ""Avanti!"" despite its share of shtick, zany local color and flip cracks.",1972-12-18T05:00:00+0000

Of the important veteran Hollywood directors, only Hitchcock remains as active, or nearly as active, and perhaps no one has remained so intelligently, so decently in touch with the ongoing enterprise of commercial movie-making.""Travels With My Aunt,"" the newest Cukor, opened yesterday at the Plaza Theater, and it is anything but a valedictory work. Indeed, it is specifically about the necessity of living through and beyond ""the accumulation of memories"" (a phrase from the movie), no matter how comfortably pious or wickedly romantic or falsely alluring they may be.""Travels With My Aunt"" takes its title, much of its dialogue, many of its situations and almost all its characters from a fine Graham Greene novel that, in the long run, it does not so closely resemble. The characters include Henry Rulling, a retiring London bank manager; his exuberant Aunt Augusta, well into her '70's, with passions modified but unextinguished; Zachary Wordsworth, Augusta's black and very loyal lover, and Tooley, an affectionate American hippie traveling east on the Orient Express.East is where everyone else is travelingto the aid of the kidnapped Mr. Visconti, the charming unspeakable love of Aunt Augusta's youth. Of Visconti we see very little, except in Aunt Augusta's memories and in the small parts of him (an amputated finger here, an ear there) that show up along the route.In type, the film is a comedy adventure-mystery, and ostensibly its aim is to save Mr. Visconti, while there is still some of him left. But its real aim is the revitalization of Henry, sunk deep into his dahlias and conventional middle age. This is achieved, but not so simply as you might imagine. And the great charm of ""Travels With My Aunt"" is the surprising emotional complexity it manages in terms of its light tone and its nutty, endlessly involved plotting.Such emotional complexity depends a good deal on richness of characterization and delicacy of human contact, and in this the film sometimes succeeds and Sometimes doesn't. Alec McCowen does marvelous things as Henry, a man of hopeful, untapped resources, and his scenes with Tooley (Cindy Williams, not the world's greatest actress) suggest exactly the quality of tender awe that seem the film's most viable feeling.Maggie Smith, playing a woman twice her age, seems to have surrounded her character rather than to have inhabited it.

us,"Newman Stars in Huston's Yarn, 'Judge Roy Bean'","The passage of time, if not actual circumstances, has thrust the mantle of freebooting greatness upon Roy Bean, the Kentucky-born (circa 1825) scalawag who, in the 1880's, settled in what was then Vinegaroon, Tex. Bean immediately styled himself pudge and then set about to being law and order to the lands west of the Pecos, principally by hanging those passers-by (a lot of whom were outlaws) who had any money or property to bequeath him.At least that's the legend that John Huston, the director; John Milius, the screenwriter, and Paul Newman, the star, Have turned into the elaborate, tall-tale Western that opened here yesterday. ""The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean"" is six parts movie carnical, complete with a performing bear, and one part somber chronicle about the promise and disillusion of an especially giddy American Dream.Any movie that dares cover so much ground and draw attention to its historical significance, has to be out of its mind in this day and age. It leaves itself wide open to charges of pretentiousness. Yet ""The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean"" is so entertaining and so vigorously performed, especially by Newman in the title role, that its pretensions become part of its robust, knock-about style.Although the real-life Roy Bean died in 1903, Mr. Milius's screenplay is purposefully vague about dates and eras. The film seems to cover the entire history of Texas as reflected in the growth of Vinegaroon, which we see first as a single barroom-whorehouse for outlaws, set in a wasteland of almost comic bleakness, then as a prosperous frontier town, a booming oil community and, finally, after the literally catacylsmic fall of Roy Beau (who takes the town with him) as a dusty museum in a way-station now known as Langtry, Tex., named for the Judge's most famous pen pal, Lily Langtry.Mr. Huston himself shows up in one of the many loosely connected episodes that make up the film's structureplaying (over-acting might be more accurate) a mountain man whose chief purpose in the film is to present Bean with the grizzly bear who is a major character. That is, until the night the bear, who cadges drinks at the bar, makes a mistake of breathing what Bean describes as his ""bear-foul breath"" on a portrait of the idolized Miss Langtry.Some of the other characters who pass through the film, rather like specialty acts, include Bad Bob the Albino, played by Stacy Keach in a platinum wig that makes him look like Carroll Baker in ""Harlow"" and the Reverend LaSalle (Anthony Perkins), an itinerant preacher who, on the soundtrack, tells us why he made Judge Bean bury the outlaws the Judge had just shot ("". . . because Christ died for all. It was His choice, not mine."").Tab Hunter turns up as one of the judge's first victims, an outlaw with a terrible stutter and just the slightest sense of injustice in the face of his imminent hanging. ""I'm no worse and probably better than the men who are doing this to me,"" he tells us in voice-over narration. Ava Gardner, looking beautifully worn by life, appears in the film's curious epilogue in which the fabulous Jersey Lily stops by to see the whistlestop that has come to bear her name.There are times when it seems as if the film wanted to imitate Newman's extremely successful (at the boxoffice) ""Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kid."" Stuck smack in the center, in a sequence of ersatz lyricism, is a schmaltzy song sung by Andy Williams for no particular purpose other than to give the movie a song to be advertised by. Most of the time, however, ""Roy Bean"" is a series of improbably genial adventures, to be interpreted only as solemnly as one sees fit.",1972-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Racial Violence Is the Theme of 'Across 110th Street',"A few years ago Barry Shear made a movie about the generation gap. It was called ""Wild in the Streets,"" and it managed at once to be unfair to kids, vicious towards adults and insulting to anyone concerned with the problems (real enough) of reconciling the anxieties and interests of young and old.Yesterday a new Barry Shear movie opened at neighborhood theaters. It is called ""Across 110th Street,"" and it deals withor inviolence between New York City blacks and whites. It manages at once to be unfair to blacks, vicious towards whites and insulting to anyone who feels that race relations might consist of something better than improvised genocide.The film concerns a band of Harlem toughs who hold up a transfer of drug money to the mob downtown, steal a few hundred thousand dollars and shoot everyone involved. The mob, led by Anthony Franciosa, seeks revenge. And the police, led by Anthony Quinn and Yaphet Kotto (one old, the other young; one white, the other black; one about to retire, the other bucking for his job), begin an investigation. By the time it is over virtually everybody has been killedby various means, but mostly by a machine gun that makes lots of noise and splatters lots of blood and probably serves as the nearest substitute for an identifiable hero.People don't fare so well. When they aren't being killed, they are being torturedeither by the rest of the cast or by the director, who tends to observe life as if through a distorting lens or in extreme close-ups that reduce faces to nervous twitches, tense lips, and the like. Shear's style runs very close to genre parody. But about personal violence it is almost hysterically serious, and audiences for whom hatred is enough may turn ""Across 110th Street"" into a very popular movie indeed.So much, and so much nonsense, has been written about the black exploitation film, that I hesitate to point out what may be the one perfect example of the type. But ""Across 110th Street"" (produced, written, and directed by whites) really does exploit its situations and its actors and even its violence, in a desperate rip-off of the latest news about the death of our cities.Such filmmaking goes where current events take it. A new Barry Shear project has been announced for the Middle East: A violent band of Arab terrorists is being hunted by a force led by an Arab and and Israeli police officer. Anthony Quinn will play the Arab police officer. I don't know whether anyone is bucking for his job.",1972-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Thief and Wife in 'Getaway',"Some movies, like Elaine May's ""The Heartbreak Kid,"" are about confusion. Some movies exploit confusion to their advantage and our amusement. Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ""Sleuth,"" for example. Then there are films that are simply lost in confusion  aimless enterprises that run on and on, sometimes with the sort of dazed looks you might expect, but often with expressions of deceptively intense purpose.The last pretty well describes Sam Peckinpah's new film, ""The Getaway,"" the story of an Ivy League-looking ex-con (Steve McQueen), his remarkably chic wife (Ali McGraw) and some double- and triple-crossing associates who, early on, hold up a bank in San Antonio and then spend the rest of the film trying to get away from the cops and from one another. More or less.That qualification is necessary because if you take the characters at face valuewhich is what one usually does in this kind of filmthen certain key decisions they make reflect on their sanity, which is otherwise unquestioned. From where any critic sits, it's impossible to tell whether this confusion is the result of the writing, the direction or the editing.In concentrated bursts, ""The Getaway"" occasionally comes to vivid, melodramatic life, as in a sequence in which McQueen hunts down a small-time thief who has stolen his valise containing $500,000, probably under the notion that it contains some hockable jewelry or traveler's checks.A subplot (actually more interesting than the main plot) details the easy decline and fall into whoredom of a veterinarian's dim-witted wife (enthusiastically played by Sally Struthers of ""All in the Family""), when she and her husband are kidnapped by one of the bank robbers.The film depends mostly on simpler, stickier sorts of sensation, such as the curious spectacle of Steve and Ali surviving inside the stuffed bowels of a garbage truck. Upon emerging, or being dumped, Ali does have one small scratch on her forehead and some smudges on her frock, but I doubt whether she'd be turned away from the door of ""21.""For all his reputation as a director of action and violence (""The Straw Dogs""), Peckinpah is most effective and most eloquent when dealing with themes of love and loss, which are as apparent in the super-bloody ""The Wild Bunch"" as in the quieter ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"" and this year's ruefully comic ""Junior Bonner."" The action and the violence of ""The Getaway"" are supported by no particular themes whatsoever. The movie just unravels.",1972-12-20T05:00:00+0000

But despite the occasional rationalizations of Jim Brown, its tough titular star and others, ""Black Gunn"" ultimately is no more constructive sociologically than its frequent fireworks and bloodletting.Gunn, you see, owns Gunn's Club, a money-making castle of a black nightclub in Los Angeles's high-rent district. He drives a white Rolls-Royce and has an adoring girl friend and, as a man well aware of the power of money, a cool disdain of the white Establishment Until, that is, his young brother (Herbert Jefferson Jr.) is rubbed out after he and his Black Action Group rob the syndicate of its loot and incriminating payoff records.But the ensuing chases, fights and carnage through slums and affluent Los Angeles sites are also interspersed with a confusion of points of view. Gary Conway, as a bland white Congressman, finally disavows the mob after appearing to be its man all along. Jim Watkins, as a black detective, is hated by the militants and Jim Brown, who suddenly switches to acceptance of the black, harried cop's brand of law and order when the shooting stops.Jim Brown's search-and-destroy tactics often destroy his shirt to expose him as a fine figure of a man. He's as tough as the legendary football star he was, laconically certain of his views on black power and tender with his decorative, if fearful, girl, Brenda Sykes.Martin Landau, Keefe Brasselle and Bruce Glover, as the white syndicate's top strongarms he mows down, are simply one-dimensional goons, as is Stephen McNally, their chief. Only physically impressive are Luciana Paluzzi, as a fancy moll; Timothy Brown, as Jim Brown's aide; Bernie Casey, as an activist leader, and baseball's Vida Blue.Robert Hartford-Davis, the British director and author of the original idea for the story, with which he's making his American debut, has concentrated on speed and violence.

us,Hit Man' Life Styles Vie for Spotlight,"A friend of mine who saw ""Hit Man"" at a screening the other night had the curious experience of finding that although the plot was very complex and virtually incomprehensible, he nevertheless always knew what was going to happen next. Later, he realized that he had seen it all before, in a film called ""Get Carter,"" which starred Michael Caine and played here last year.""Get Carter,"" set in Newcastle, was a murder mystery having to do with the seamier insides of the pornographic movie business. ""Hit Man,"" which opened yesterday at several local theaters, keeps the murders and the dirty movies, but the action is now in Los Angeles, and everybody's skin is black.I shan't go into the story, which I could describe completely and still leave you unenlightened. But it obviously owes a lot to the Raymond Chandler tradition of detective fiction. In ""Get Carter"" (which I have not seen) the debt is apparently well paid by way of explicit nostalgic allusion. In ""Hit Man"" the debt is simply ignored. Its interest is life style rather than literary style, and as it turns out, that is interest enough.There have been very few recent movies quite so pleasantly involved with their locationsfrom improbable mansions to seedy cottages, from skyscrapers to one-man (or one-woman) motels, from the home-made surrealism of Watts Towers to a suburban game preserve full of sullen lions and tigersand very few movies so aware of the kinds of unpretentious entertainment that merely being on location can offer. The dialogue, equally divided between inuendo and insult, and almost wholly unrepeatable in this newspaper, is a kind of personality play of great resourcefulness and skill. And the personalities, highly individualized and often lovely, seem the creation of people actively concerned with making themselves interesting.Everybody in ""Hit Man"" is fairly sexy, but the women are sexier than the men (thank God) and the sexiest of all is Pamela Grier, who plays Gozelda, a skin-flick actress of evil ambitions and overwhelming presence, until she is consumed by a hungry tiger in the game preserve. As her more worthy antagonist, Bernie Casey keeps enough cool for half a dozen movie heroes. The rest of the cast is good, and a few, Lisa Moore as the motel keeper Laural Garfoot and Sam Laws as the used-car dealer Sherwood Epps, are pretty close to wonderful.George Armitage's direction is often sloppy around the edges, but precise and well observed with whatever matters. A student in the Roger Corman on-the-job-training film school, he has made such unreviewed glories as ""Private - Duty Nurses"" and ""Night Call Nurses."" He seems a real film maker, with a fine sense of excitement and of relaxation in the medium, and I hope he goes far.",1972-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"For 'Gamma Rays,' Another Opening . . .","Beatrice Hunsdorfer (Joanne Woodward) is the classic gum-chewing, chain-smoking, whisky-swilling, snappy retorting American mother-frump, equally beloved by certain playwrights and by actresses, especially actresses who like to get their hands, feet, hair, body and teeth into a role.Beatrice is a mess. When we first see her in Paul Newman's film version of Paul Zindel's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, ""The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the Moon Marigolds,"" she's at the local variety store trying on wigs. Should she buy a black Gina Lollobrigida type, perhaps? A red Afro? She finally picks a spectacularly ill-fitting platinum-blond one that recalls the life and times of Carole Landis.It's difficult to believe that Beatrice, even as dumb as she's supposed to be, could have anything in mind but laughs when she puts it on. Which is one of the basic problems with frump plays as serious drama. How much of the time do we laugh at the frumps, and how much of the time with them?Mr. Zindel's play, it seemed to me, never quite made up its mind. Beatrice never stopped talking and much of what she said was funny in the manner of the insults of a quick-witted drag queen. The play wanted us to be shocked by Beatrice's various cruelties to others as well as to herself; yet it also wanted us to feel pity. For me, however, Beatrice, has always been less a character than a theatrical clich.It isn't life that's stacked the cards against her, but, first, the playwright and now the film-makers.Beatrice lives in a rundown neighborhood in a rundown city (actually Bridgeport, Conn., which isn't all that run down) and keeps her rundown car in the rundown driveway. When she walks through her house, she's up to her hips in domestic debris, including rabbit droppings. She dreams of putting her family, as she describes it, back on the map by opening a tearoom specializing in cheese cake.Beatrice, as is usually the case in this sort of drama (which might better be called domestic disappointment than domestic tragedy), inhabits a world abandoned by men. Her husband is dead, and the men she does come upon are unfeeling creeps, though Beatrice is not the sort of woman to evoke more than passing lust.She has two teen-age daughters, one of whom, Ruthie (Roberta Wallach), is run down to the point of apparently being an epileptic. The other daughter, Matilda (Nell Potts), is the surprising mutant suggested by the title, a sweet, inquiring intelligence, whose winning of the highschool science prize prompts what dramatic development there is in the film.""The Effect of Gamma Rays"" is not a stupid film. The talents of everyone connected with it are unmistakable, including those of Mr. Newman, a director of plain, straight style. It's just that the basic material calls for a kind of second-rate bravura performance from everyone, from the production designer to the actors. There's no way to underplay it.At times I had the feeling that Miss Woodward was auditioning for the role of Sadie Thompson, and that Miss Wallach was occasionally in competition. Only Nell Potts (in private life, the daughter of Miss Woodward and Mr. Newman) is allowed to perform at something like a reasonable pace. It's a lovely, solemn performance in a film that otherwise succeeds in being simultaneously too barren and too busy, like Beatrice herself.",1972-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Jeremiah Johnson':Robert Redford Stars as Man of Legend,"""Ride due west as the sun sets; turn left at the Rocky Mountains . . ."" And following these directions, young Jeremiah Johnson begins his search for ""bear, beaver and other critters worth cash for trapping."" It is to become a lifetime journey, a total redefinition of the man. It takes him into a beautiful, awesome, often terrifying wilderness  a wilderness that is curiously full of people, many of them dead.Jeremiah achieves his own position in the wilderness. He loses track of time. He gets a wife, a squaw, and loses her too  slaughtered by Crow Indians. He makes a kind of spiritual contact with the mountains that surround him (there is no making peace with them), though he lives in such intimacy with trouble that he no longer knows what trouble is. Eventually he wins fame in defending himself from Crows, and his very enemies come to revere himthough whether as one of the immortals or as a man they consider already dead, nobody can say. Thus he becomes a legend in his own time.The quality of legend pervades Sydney Pollack's ""Jeremiah Johnson,"" which stars Robert Redford in a role that must be very real to his own mind and feelings. It is a very attractive role, and Redford plays it with a reticence and directness that also seem as much a part of the man as of the performance. That it does not succeed entirely is perhaps less the fault of the actor or of the conception than of a screenplay that tends to be ponderous about its imponderables and that every so often sounds as if it might have been written by the authors of the Bible.The action takes place some time in the 19th century, though after which war, it is difficult to say. To replace the more usual affairs of men, the film concentrates on the power of nature, or the powers that simple men can wrest from nature, and, almost unavoidably, it keeps giving the impression of a literary interpretation of its materials. This is not the only impression, but it is the one underlined by the rhetoric of Pollack's film-making  by his heavy montage, his treatment of landscape, his calculated merging of people and places through interminable lap dissolves.But for all its involvement with academic cinema art, ""Jeremiah Johnson"" is full of compensations. There are momoments of great beauty and terror and deeply earned pathos. There are as well such not-so-incidental pleasures as John Rubinstein's lovely and serviceable musical score, and a cast of excellent supporting actors.And at a rather important level I can only honor a movie that introduces a French-speaking Indian chief named Two-Tongues Lebeaux (Richard Angarola), or that offers one old trapper (Will Geer) a chance to reverse Shakespeare's most famous stage direction, as he enters, pursued by a bear.""Jeremiah Johnson"" opened yesterday at Loew's Tower East Theater.",1972-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:Borodin's 'Prince Igor' Comes From Soviet,"The dichotomy between movies and opera is obvious, but let's cheerfully note that the different media have been effectively welded in the 1969 Soviet-made ""Prince Igor,"" which had its local premiere yesterday at the Regency. The Borodin opera, a staple onu the Russian boards but rarely done here, evolves as an eye-catching, event-filling, vintage folk adventure in film term that neatly complements the music, singers and dancers.The libretto of the opera (last staged here in 1969) basically may be a stylized, certainly unfamiliar mlange of battles between 12th-century Russian and Oriental chieftains and of court intrigue and romance. But with stilted, archaic English lyrics and a workmanlike script, the opera is projected in fairly cohesive sequences on screen.The acting principals are attractive professionals, who are only rarely hammy, even in closeups. And the use of what to untrained ears are fine vocalists to do their singing off-screen seems natural and logical, especially with the expert help of the Kirov Opera chorus, ballet and orchestra to back them up.Contributing lively, if serious, portrayals are Boris Khmelnitsky, as the proud, unconquerable Prince Igor, Bimbibulat Valayev, as his generous captor; I. Morgoyeva, as that Oriental chieftain's pretty daughter who falls in love with Igor's son; and Nelly Pshennaya, as Igor's steadfast princess.Under the direction of Roman Tikhomirov (he also filmed ""Eugene Onegin"" and ""Pique Dame""), Borodin's score (themes of which were used in Broadway's ""Kismet"") and the Polovtsian Dances, come across tunefully and vividly. In using an imposing array of athletic Oriental dancers, as well as the ballet, it becomes an especially vigorous, strikingly exotic display.The camera, or course, is not bound by the confines of an opera house proscenium. And the varied action, filmed in pastel shades, is sweeping and colorful against backgrounds of steppes, rivers, a primitive town and clashing horsemen.As a movie, ""Prince Igor"" naturally is not standard screen fare. But it entertainingly succeeds in avoiding the static, stagy look of many previously filmed operas.",1972-12-22T05:00:00+0000

What's the harm in a little round-the-clock fantasizing, with the ties to a loving husband, the nursery and the kitchen loosened but not unbroken? No harm, and ""Up the Sandbox"" is a joy.Even with a few arid patches and fantasies that unwind a bit methodically at times, Barbra Streisand's sixth film is her sixth hit. Yes, think of it. An hour after seeing the new one, which is ripe, yeasty fun, it's hard not to think of this extraordinary young woman, perfectly wedded to the camera with her instant Modigliani face and timing.She's the picture, true, but the teamwork is admirable. Nearly everything works and meshes, starting with an adroit script by Paul Zindel, the playwright, based on Anne Richardson Roiphe's novel. Fortunately and even when they're way out, the vignette musings generally miss blandness and strain because our heroine is a bright, likable girl, not a pinhead.Furthermore, Irvin Kershner has paced the picturein which Miss Streisand plays a nonsinging role  with a kind of take-it-or-leave-it verve that nimbly enhances the sharp dialogue, the more thoughtful passages and the performances. As Miss Streisand's college-professor husband, a young film newcomer named David Selby is excellent.My favorite episode is a happily cacaphonous family dinner, an anniversary celebration of the heroine's parents, that the daydreamer shifts into a catfight with her smothering mother, nicely played by Jane Hoffman This is by far the funniest thing in the picture. Another one, off to a good, brash start, gets a bit bulky, as Miss Streisand and some black activists invade the Statue of Liberty with dynamite.Another, which lands the star and an anthropologist squarely in the middle of Africa and some hostile Africans, seems forced  unless you watch Miss Streisand closely.The slyest portion, certainly with the star at her gamiest, is her verbal squelching of visiting Fidel Castro at a local rally, with a bold postscript that reportedly earned the film, which is as harmless as buttermilk, its ""R"" rating. As for taste, neither is there anything jarring about her imagined check-in at a hospital for an abortion as her young spouse lunges in, protesting.Finally, cementing the occasional lapses and gaps is a striking, luscious score by Billy Goldenberg that is the real pulse of the movie.

These are dramatizations based loosely on events which are not so outrageously beyond the realm of reality as to be totally impossible yet are not meant, on the other hand, to present things strictly as they are. Things as they really are, from what Mr. Daley tells us of the policeman's world, are often boring, repetitive and full of drudgery. These are not the ideal qualities of an en tertainment program. I do not propose to defend the cop shows as good entertainment, but rather only to point out that this is their category.

No wonder: Harry Truman consistently defied the nos trums of the liberal intellectuals. He did not have charisma and prob ably would not have wanted it. More over, Harry Truman believed in the public, not a congenial sentiment for those who (as Janet Smith recently put it) see majority rule as distinct ly in bad taste. If Harry Truman had lost in 1948 it is hard to imagine his bemoaning the failure of the peo ple to reach his height of moral grandeur. He would more likely have criticized himself with some com ment like if the student failed to learn, the teacher failed to teach.

Mr. Mallin favors a present tense, cinematographic style, and gets in some heavy symbolism by jump cutting from things like a toilet bowl to a bishop's ring, and back again. Hmmm No. 3.

Waldemar Hansen's primary concern is the life and times of Shah Jahan (1592 1666), the fourth of the dynas ty, who achieved immorality by building the Taj Mahal. A sensitive, hardworking man, a conscientious ruler and a de vout Moslem, Shah Jahan loved only one of his three wives: Mumtaz Mahal, over whose corpse he built the white mar ble mausoleum. Mr. Hansen does not point out that the edi fice was as much an expression of its creator's megalomania, a translation of his extreme pride and contempt for all, as it was of affection for his wife. This may be because Hansen has struck such a priceless lode of history unfamiliar to English language readers that he had neither the space nor inclina tion to analyze what he has found. The result, however, is a shining piece of expository craftsmanship.",1972-12-31T05:00:00+0000
