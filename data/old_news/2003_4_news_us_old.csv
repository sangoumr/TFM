In February, sales fell sequentially in all geographic markets, but year-over-year sales rose 17 percent in Europe, 35 percent in Japan and 26 percent in the Asia-Pacific market. In the Americas, sales dropped to $2.41 billion, down 4.5 percent from $2.52 billion a year earlier, because of continued outsourcing of electronic equipment production and component purchases to Asia, particularly China. &#0160;&#0160;(Dow Jones/AP) ",2003-04-01T05:00:00+0000

The following month, Mr. Lin and his girlfriend, Ying Li, arrived at the gambler's home in Queens, telling him he could win the rest of the money gambling in Atlantic City. Instead, they drove him to a house in Atlantic City, where Mr. Lin and another man, Kui Li, who is believed to be Ms. Li's brother, threatened to kill him, prosecutors said. Mr. Lin was sentenced on Friday. Ms. Li, who is in custody, and Mr. Li, a fugitive, have been indicted on charges of kidnapping and extortion. Stacy Albin (NYT)",2003-04-01T05:00:00+0000

Growth in the farm sector, which accounts for about a quarter of the country's gross domestic product, diminished to 5.9 percent from 7.9 percent a year ago as a result of insufficient rain. The industrial sector grew at 6.3 percent, and finance, insurance, real estate and business services at 8.1 percent.

Earnings were hurt by a $67 million loss at its subsidiary Musicland, which it is trying to sell. Sales at its non-Musicland business rose after price reductions and no-interest financing enticed shoppers. Sales at its electronics stores open at least 14 months fell 3 percent in March as consumers stayed home to watch television coverage of the war in Iraq.

us,Technology Briefing: Telecommunications," DIRECTV WINS DISMISSAL OF SUIT ON PIRACY LETTERS DirecTV, the nation's largest satellite television service, has won dismissal of a lawsuit filed by people who contended that the company accused them of piracy in letters and tried to extort money. Judge Charles W. McCoy Jr. of California Superior Court in Los Angeles ruled that DirecTV's letters were sent in connection with litigation, which is constitutionally protected speech. The letters were sent to people whose names turned up on invoices of raided companies as purchasers of piracy equipment. DirecTV, owned by the Hughes Electronics Corporation, has filed 2,000 federal lawsuits against people who failed to respond to the letters. The court action preserves DirecTV's ability to pursue a tactic it says it needs to protect its proprietary interests. Signal pirates cost DirecTV millions in revenue last year, the company says, and it cut off service to at least 50,000 viewers who were improperly receiving its programming. The court found sufficient evidence ""to show DirecTV sent its demand letters in serious contemplation of litigation,"" Judge McCoy wrote in a four-page ruling dated Tuesday. ""I guarantee this will be appealed,"" said Jeff Wilens, a lawyer for the letter recipients who sued the company. &#0160;&#0160;(Bloomberg News) ",2003-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: DirecTV Wins Dismissal Of Suit On Piracy Letters,"DirecTV, the nation's largest satellite television service, has won dismissal of a lawsuit filed by people who contended that the company accused them of piracy in letters and tried to extort money. Judge Charles W. McCoy Jr. of California Superior Court in Los Angeles ruled that DirecTV's letters were sent in connection with litigation, which is constitutionally protected speech. The letters were sent to people whose names turned up on invoices of raided companies as purchasers of piracy equipment. DirecTV, owned by the Hughes Electronics Corporation, has filed 2,000 federal lawsuits against people who failed to respond to the letters. The court action preserves DirecTV's ability to pursue a tactic it says it needs to protect its proprietary interests. Signal pirates cost DirecTV millions in revenue last year, the company says, and it cut off service to at least 50,000 viewers who were improperly receiving its programming. The court found sufficient evidence ''to show DirecTV sent its demand letters in serious contemplation of litigation,'' Judge McCoy wrote in a four-page ruling dated Tuesday.

The boy, Anthony Vazquez, was at his home in Oakdale with another 14-year-old boy, whose identity was not disclosed, when the shooting took place about 2:30 p.m., the Suffolk police said. They said both boys had been holding the gun to pose for a picture when the friend pulled the trigger, apparently assuming that the gun was not loaded. The bullet struck Anthony in the head. Anthony's friend was charged with manslaughter because his behavior was reckless, the police said. The handgun belonged to Anthony's father, Officer Jose Vazquez of the New York City police, who was not at home when the shooting occurred, the authorities said. Thomas J.

After the announcement, stock of the company, a bar code maker, shot up nearly 30 percent to its highest in more than two years, before closing up nearly 25 percent as the No. 5 percentage gainer on Nasdaq. Metrologic said it now expected to report first-quarter net income of 30 cents a share, up 5 cents from the previously estimated 25 cents a share. It earned $22,000, or break even on a per share basis, a year earlier. Metrologic said sales for the quarter increased 16 percent, to $32 million, about 7 percent above its earlier estimate of $30 million in sales. Metrologic said stronger sales were driven by demand for bar code scanners and other products, mostly in Europe and America. Metrologic said its first-quarter results were helped by the euro's big run-up this year. As of March 31, when Metrologic's quarter ended, the euro had gained 25 percent against the dollar from the year before.

Judge Alvin Hellerstein of United States District Court in Manhattan refused to grant an injunction sought by the satellite broadcaster EchoStar Communications that would have prevented an affiliate of the network, Azteca America, from sending programs to local cable and satellite systems. EchoStar claimed that Azteca's distribution agreements violated a contract giving EchoStar exclusive rights to carry programs from Azteca's Channel 13 in Mexico on its American direct broadcast satellite service. The judge's decision allows the Azteca affiliates to sign deals with local cable operators. EchoStar said it still expected to prevail when the case goes to trial.

It had an advertisement, sold by Google, for a Web site selling concert tickets. Companies not in the alliance cannot use this as a back door onto Amazon's site.

Nixon, a man not known for his relaxation skills, used to hang out with his friend Bebe Rebozo. It is easy to imagine the appeal of this quiet island, a few minutes' drive from downtown Miami, for a busy and eventually beleaguered president. (Nixon was on Key Biscayne on the weekend in 1972 when burglars were arrested inside the Democratic Party's national headquarters at the Watergate complex.) Presidential helicopters have not come by for a long time now; the house the Nixons lived in no longer exists. The island is still a quiet haven -- a bedroom community for Miami; a second-home spot for the well-heeled, including many whose primary homes are in Latin America; and a serene alternative to South Beach for vacationers. Life remains casual and slow: a 20-mile-per-hour speed limit and a number of speed bumps help keep it that way.

''This ritual, her son coming home from school, was all wrong,'' Meg thinks, and boards the bus to encounter a child whose face is ''fuller, firmer, more grown into itself.'' This isn't her son, she decides. Even the boy's father, returning home late and checking on him in his sleep, can affirm only that he ''sure looks enough'' like Charlie. (''Enough?'' Meg asks, never losing her gift for dry comedy.) It would seem to drain the story of its complexity to suggest that people vanish as they grow, but Deborah Schupack's strange, unsettling, lyrical novel defies simple paraphrase. Driven by rage -- at her perpetually absent husband, at the willfulness of her teenage daughter, at her formerly asthmatic son (or, rather, his replacement), who seems not to need her -- Meg journeys through a sort of psychological fifth dimension, the internal world being the one she sees. Motherhood with all its contradictions has rarely been shown so nakedly. Schupack gives us Meg's view and everyone else's in overlapping layers, delineating domestic life in a small Vermont town where even the attentive sheriff and the friendly pediatrician whom you address by first name take on a potentially threatening edge.

us,'The Crisis of Islam'," It is difficult to generalize about Islam. To begin with, the word itself is commonly used with two related but distinct meanings, as the equivalents both of Christianity and of Christendom. In the one sense it denotes a religion, a system of belief and worship; in the other, the civilization that grew up and flourished under the aegis of that religion. The word Islam thus denotes more than fourteen centuries of history, a billion and a third people, and a religious and cultural tradition of enormous diversity. Christianity and Christendom represent a greater number and a longer period-more than 2 billion people, more than twenty centuries, and even greater diversity. Nevertheless, certain generalizations can be and are made about what is variously called Christian, Judeo-Christian, post-Christian, and-more simply-Western civilization. While generalizing about Islamic civilization may be difficult and at times in a sense dangerous, it is not impossible and may in some ways be useful. ",2003-04-06T05:00:00+0000

us,"'It's tentative, amorphous folk and folk rock for people and a moment...too unsettled for the certainty of anthems.'","''Big shot guns with no guns/big shot army with no army at all,'' Cat Power sings in her affectingly benumbed way. Drums lope. A bass line climbs to the upper frets, retreats, repeats. A guitar emits a soft cloud of fuzz-tone and feedback. ''I don't know what is worse,'' she continues, ''and I can't tell what is the best.'' The song is called ''Shaking Paper,'' and it is not a protest song. ''Shaking Paper,'' like most every other song on Cat Power's new album, ''You Are Free,'' is about inquietude, balkiness, dread. Since its release in late February, ''You Are Free'' has topped the playlists of the country's left-of-the-dial college radio stations. It has a pared-down sound -- a couple of grave minor chords, a muffled guitar, a piano with bare-room echoes: the sound of a sleepless night. It has lyrics that tend toward the dreamy and mystic and even biblical: faint visions, quiet supplications, muted lamentations. It's tentative, amorphous folk and folk rock for people -- and a moment -- too unsettled for the certainty of anthems.",2003-04-06T05:00:00+0000

The woman, Jessica Morgan, 21, of Burlington City, confessed to knowing that her boyfriend beat the 7-month-old boy, Sage Morgan-Abrahams, in a drug-induced rage. She also admitted that she watched the child slowly die over the next 24 hours, then let the boyfriend, Kevin Abrahams, 25, burn the body in a fireplace. Ms. Morgan's mother became suspicious in June when the couple visited her without the baby. She alerted the police, who found the baby's remains, prosecutors said. The couple, who had fled to Florida, were arrested in July. Ms. Morgan will testify against Mr. Abrahams, who faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murder. Ms. Morgan will receive a sentence of 13 years and 6 months. Hope Reeves (NYT)",2003-04-08T05:00:00+0000

For 30 years Andr Breton's widow and daughter found little support for their efforts to find a permanent home for the Surrealist leader's art, manuscript and book collection. As the vast collection went on sale, however, artists and intellectuals were ready to protest the dispersal of the principal record of the interwar Surrealist movement. Gathered outside the Htel Drouot, the main Paris auction house, they distributed pamphlets, chanted slogans and blocked bidders trying to enter the building. Finally, calm was restored as the first of 22 auction sessions through April 18 went ahead with the sale of books from Breton's collection, many of them dedicated to him. Among the 4,100 lots in the auction are 3,500 books, 800 manuscripts, 500 photographs, 400 paintings and drawings and 150 American Indian and Oceanic art objects. The estimated value of the sale is $30 million to $40 million. In France the preferred scapegoat is always the government. Successive governments showed no interest in creating a foundation or museum for the works preserved in Breton's tiny apartment at 42, rue Fontaine in the Pigalle district. In reality, the best of the collection may still stay in France. Over the last three decades, the Breton estate sold a number of paintings to government-owned museums. After the death of Breton's widow, Elisa, ''Breton's Wall'' -- the 250 works of art on the wall behind his desk -- was given to the Georges Pompidou Center in lieu of estate taxes. During the current auction, the government is also expected to exercise its right to buy prized objects at the price they have been sold to a bidder. ALAN RIDING",2003-04-08T05:00:00+0000

us,They Can Run but They Can't Fly,"The question of whether elephants run has been a biomechanical puzzle. To see how the great creatures move, Dr. John R. Hutchinson of Stanford and his colleagues videotaped Asian elephants as they chugged along at speeds up to 13 miles an hour. They found that elephants don't change the pattern of footfall as they run, as horses and other animals do when they go faster. But the researchers noted, in a paper in the current issue of Nature, there are different definitions of running. If you are standing in front of a charging elephant, it is running, whatever its gait, although the scientists did not mention this fact. But they did report that elephants' feet touch the ground only briefly and that their hind legs display a motion characteristic of running, although the front legs move more as if they were walking. This is unusual. In most animals if the back runs the front does too. So more research is needed. One thing seems clear, however, and can be seen in the picture sequence above. Unlike Dumbo, real elephants don't leave the ground. Although the elephant in the second photo of the sequence has only one leg touching the ground, briefly, that's as close to airborne as they get. More data is needed, the researchers say, ''to understand why elephants avoid using an aerial phase.''",2003-04-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Broadcom Will Have 2nd-Quarter  Expense,"The Broadcom Corporation, the maker of cable modem chips, will have a second-quarter expense of as much as $238 million for letting employees exchange stock options that are currently worthless. The amount of the noncash expense depends on the number of options exchanged, Broadcom said yesterday. Workers holding options with exercise prices of at least $23.58 can swap them for a fewer number of Class A shares or options with lower strike prices, the company said. The shares trade at less than $14. The swap is aimed at retaining key employees, said Broadcom, which traditionally caps salaries at $110,000. The company has posted 10 straight quarterly net losses and its shares have fallen 58 percent in the last year. The former chief executive, Henry T. Nicholas III, quit in January citing family reasons, and the head of the company's server-chip business, Raju Vegesna, was replaced last month. Less than 10 percent of the 57 million options eligible for exchange belong to top-level executives, said Bill Blanning, a company spokesman. Broadcom shares rose 36 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $13.49. They traded as high as $274.75 in August 2000.",2003-04-08T05:00:00+0000

Shares declined $3.45, or about 21 percent, to $13.05. They dropped as low as $11.65, after gaining 5.6 percent in the last year.

Analysts expected the company to earn 21 cents on sales of $259.9 million, according to a Thomson Financial survey. Customers canceled purchases because of the war in Iraq and slow economic growth, the company said. The chief financial officer, Robert S. Bloom, did not return a call seeking comment.

us,Technology Briefing: Telecommunications," APPEALS COURT RESCINDS FINE AGAINST AT&T A federal appeals court yesterday struck down a fine the Federal Communications Commission had imposed on AT&T for unauthorized switching of long-distance phone service, and said part of the commission's ""anti-slamming"" regulations exceeded its authority. The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the commission was overstepping its authority by requiring carriers to guarantee that the person authorizing a change of service is the customer. The court said federal law required only that carriers get ""verification"" of a customer's decision to switch, usually through a call back to the customer's number by a third-party service. A representative of the F.C.C. was not immediately available for comment. The case stems from a 2000 ruling by the commission, which found AT&T liable for 11 incidents of slamming and levied fines totaling $520,000, the court said. AT&T opposed the sanctions in two of the cases, which accounted for $80,000 in fines. The company argued that it had complied with F.C.C. rules that require ""independent third-party verification"" that the customers had ordered a change in long-distance service, the appeals court said. The commission had rejected the company's argument. The two customers at issue complained that they did not even know the people who had verified the change on their behalf. But the appeals court disagreed, ruling that the F.C.C.'s regulations ""go beyond the anti-slamming statute's express terms."" An AT&T spokeswoman, Claudia Jones, said the company has ""a zero-tolerance policy for slamming."" ",2003-04-09T05:00:00+0000

The state has sidestepped the requirement by establishing authorities and making contracts with them to repay their bonds. The court's 4-to-3 decision approved that method, reasoning that the state does not guarantee the debt and thus does not obligate taxpayers. Laura Mansnerus (NYT)",2003-04-10T05:00:00+0000

In response, Thailand shut its borders with Cambodia, withdrew its ambassador -- who had fled the embassy -- and ordered the Cambodian envoy in Bangkok to leave. Cambodia later paid Thailand $5.9 million for the destruction of the embassy. Thai business owners are seeking $46.8 million for damages to their properties. The riot was sparked by rumors that a Thai actress had said the Angkor temples, which have been contested over the centuries, belonged to Thailand. The announcement that relations were being resumed was made near the temples, in Siem Reap, which means ''victory over Siam,'' the historical name for Thailand.

Wife of Amory Houghton, former Chairman of Corning Glass Works and American Ambassador to France under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mrs. Houghton was born in Providence, RI. A graduate of Milton Academy in Milton, MA, she moved to Corning with her husband in 1921. Their marriage lasted six months shy of sixty years. In the late 1950's, The Herald Tribune bestowed the name ''L'Ambassadrice Souriante'' (the Smiling Ambassadress) to Mrs. Houghton. The paper also referred to her as ''the undisputed First Lady of the Diplomatic Corps and of the American Colony in Paris.'' ''I would say she was the most gracious woman I ever knew,'' said Thomas Buechner, former Director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Corning Museum of Glass. She served on the Boards of national institutions such as the Girl Scouts of America, Project Hope and Hobart and William Smith College; and numerous local charities. She received two Honorary Degrees. Once asked to become President of the Girl Scouts of America, she declined citing the need to be near her family. Several years later, she accepted the Vice-Chairmanship. ''She possessed deep personal beliefs which brooked no shoddy behavior,'' said her son, Congressman Amory Houghton, Jr. (R-NY). ''She had the endearing capacity for laughter in happy times, contagious; in times of stress, lightening the load.'' ''When someone of her stature passes away, we have to say a generation is going,'' said Thomas P. Dimitroff, a noted Corning historian. ''She was a lady in the best sense of the word.'' Mrs. Houghton is survived by four children: Elizabeth H. Weinberg, Congressman Amory Houghton, Jr., James R. Houghton, Chairman and CEO of Corning Inc., and the Reverend Alanson R. Houghton II, 18 grandchildren, and 32 great-grandchildren. She was predeceased by daughter, Laura H. Beer, on September 22, 2000.

The court, voting 4 to 3, rejected an argument that the method violated the constitutional requirement that long-term borrowing be approved by the voters. The state has sidestepped the requirement by establishing authorities and making contracts with them to repay their bonds. The court reasoned that the state thereby does not guarantee the debt and thus does not obligate taxpayers. Laura Mansnerus",2003-04-13T05:00:00+0000

Even one would just be, like, way generous. Seizing him by the neck with both hands, she raises her shins from the carpet and presses her full dead weight onto his rib cage and solar plexus, forcing more air from his lungs. How's that feel? As she rocks back and forth, they lock eyes. ""You like that?"" she asks, flirty as ever. ""How come?"" Her name is Sandra Murphy. When she wears clothes, her taste runs to Gucci, Victoria's Secret, Versace. Her latest ride is the SL 500, in black. She used to work at a high-end sports car emporium in Long Beach, so she knows what the good stuff is. After that gig she moved to Las Vegas and danced topless professionally, but she hasn't had to work in three years-not since she danced for the guy she is currently laying her hands on. ""My old man,"" she calls him sometimes, or ""my husband,"" especially since she moved in. And she would sort of like to get married. Settle down, kids, that whole deal. Not right now, though. Because you, you've got time , as Liz Phair advises in ""Polyester Bride,"" one of Sandy's all-time favorite songs. Time to get rich, see the world, party hearty. And lately she's been having the time of her used-to-be-not-so-great life. Million-dollar mansion, cute boyfriend, bionic sex, Benz, plus she's keeping her looks, above all. That's the key. In 1989 she was runner-up for the title of Miss Bellflower, a south-central suburb of Los Angeles. That was nine years ago, when Sandy was seventeen, but she maintains her dancer's physique by working out five days a week, and she still keeps the sash in her closet.

Line drawings of conventional rooms on transparent acetate pages allowed readers to insert samples of their own fabrics and wallpapers to get an idea of how their own rooms might look. The book's fundamental flaw -- the misleading discrepancy between the scale of actual fabric and wallpaper patterns and that of the rooms -- didn't matter to Simmons. Instead, the collage aspect of the book inspired her to break the confines of the doll-house rooms she was used to working with and to introduce furniture and figures clipped from magazines and comic books, as well as three-dimensional objects, into her domestic universe.

When I asked Shashi Tharoor, the under secretary general for communications and a U.N. lifer, whether he feared that the body was about to become irrelevant, as President Bush and other administration officials have threatened, he said: ''We've been here before. Look at Suez in 1956, look at the Congo in the early 60's, look at Kosovo in 1999'' -- all cases in which the Security Council was hamstrung by disagreements among the great powers, all accompanied by dire predictions about the body's future.

Scarcely a speech, briefing or interview was being given that failed to mention the laws of war.

us,'The Devil Wears Prada'," The light hadn't even officially turned green at the intersection of 17th and Broadway before an army of overconfident yellow cabs roared past the tiny deathtrap I was attempting to navigate around the city streets. Clutch, gas, shift (neutral to first? Or first to second?), release clutch, I repeated over and over in my head, the mantra offering little comfort and even less direction amid the screeching midday traffic. The little car bucked wildly twice before it lurched forward through the intersection. My heart flip-flopped in my chest. Without warning, the lurching evened out and I began to pick up speed. Lots of speed. I glanced down to confirm visually that I was only in second gear, but the rear end of a cab loomed so large in the windshield that I could do nothing but jam my foot on the brake pedal so hard that my heel snapped off. Shit! Another pair of seven-hundred-dollar shoes sacrificed to my complete and utter lack of grace under pressure: this clocked in as my third such breakage this month. It was almost a relief when the car stalled (I'd obviously forgotten to press the clutch when attempting to brake for my life). I had a few seconds-peaceful seconds if one could overlook the angry honking and varied forms of the word ""fuck"" being hurled at me from all directions-to pull off my Manolos and toss them into the passenger seat. There was nowhere to wipe my sweaty hands except for the suede Gucci pants that hugged my thighs and hips so tightly they'd both begun to tingle within minutes of my securing the final button. My fingers left wet streaks across the supple suede that swathed the tops of my now numb thighs. Attempting to drive this $84,000 stick-shift convertible through the obstacle-fraught streets of midtown at lunchtime pretty much demanded that I smoke a cigarette. ",2003-04-13T05:00:00+0000

She hated the greystone gauntness of the building, and when it became a nursing home said she'd rather take an overdose than `end up there'. In the event, when she became too ill to manage at home, it seemed the only sensible option. She resented the indignity but accepted the logic. Friends and neighbours could drop by.

The students' work is collected in book form; ''Peace Diaries Volume 2,'' due out in May, represents 13 countries. Children collaborate on a constitution of student rights, nominate candidates for ''peace president,'' design ''peace totems'' (at left) and describe lives defined by terror. An Azerbaijani teenager tells of being forced from home: ''Now we live in the kindergarten. We have one room and members of the family live in one room.'' A student in Queens describes the World Trade Center site: ''It looks like a graveyard over there now.'' An Israeli girl talks about bombings: ''My mother doesn't let me go because she afraid that something bad will happens to me.'' But she, as others, ends with a note of hope.

The Sargent family was living in Rome that winter, and the 12-year-old Sargent spent hours in the chilly Vatican galleries, honing his drawing skills by sketching works from antiquity.+Sargent (1856-1925) became one of the most international American artists of his day, shuttling around Italy, France, England and the United States, but he knew Italy most intimately. His Italian connections, from his birth in Florence to the Italian Renaissance influences in his murals, are the subject of the essays in SARGENT AND ITALY (Los Angeles County Museum/Princeton University, $49.95). Sargent hated the dull routine of society portraiture, and his Italian trips -- painting peasants in Capri, Venetian bead stringers, Alpine brooks -- refreshed him. Particularly interesting is Jane Dini's essay, ''Boston's Michelangelo,'' which discusses the Boston murals that Sargent considered his most important work. He relished the chance to bring his considerable knowledge of history and literature to his painting, and to work in the style of the Renaissance artists he had idolized as a child. In 1917, the art critic Frederick William Coburn reported on the progress of Sargent's murals at the Boston Public Library: ''Given perhaps five years more, one mind, one pair of hands will have presided over the creation of an American Sistine Chapel.''

''It left an impression on me even then,'' he said. ''It was a very classic midcentury design, with delicate detailing and proportions -- open to the landscape and very optimistic.'' Thirty-odd years passed, and Kundig became an architect like his dad and started building weekend getaways for his own clients. Five years ago, he was on a Coeur d'Alene building site when a flashback made him wander down the road a bit. In a perfect bit of coincidence, there stood the McClure cabin.

So it's all the more surprising, after you've traveled some long, winding roads and come to the edge of a lake, to see an arresting house of concrete block. You enter through a 19-foot-high vaultlike steel front door and make your way along bare concrete floors around a massive wooden stair (which leads up to the master bedroom), and suddenly the space explodes into a double-height living area, with an enormous steel window that flips up, like some larger-than-life garage door, the better to showcase the spectacular view beyond.",2003-04-13T05:00:00+0000

Charles Keil is the kind of endangered-species scholar who believes that music is something played and shared and lived with, not studied at a remove. So he went with his Greek-born wife, Angeliki Keil, to live among the Roma musicians (some call them Gypsies) of northern Greece. This book attempts a kaleidoscopic report: he wrote about the musicians, the music and the gigs (at marches, weddings, baptisms, wrestling matches); she wrote about the people and their history; Dick Blau took high-contrast black-and-white photographs; Steven Feld made recordings for an enclosed CD. The result is a remarkable work on the ''layering'' (in their words) of culture within the Roma people. Because of a long history of invasions and colonizations, Roma language and music have been shaped by Indians, medieval Greeks, Huns, Persians, Bulgarians, Turks, Albanians, Americans. What can we take from it? That few people are defined by a single culture. Anyone interested in popular music could use more exposure to this idea. Which leads us to . . .",2003-04-13T05:00:00+0000

The signature protects people against the group of neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein elements known as prions. Because prions don't jump easily from one species to another, the researchers say the protective effect probably arose from frequent eating of human flesh, rather than of infected animals. Some anthropologists believe cannibalism is just a slogan to demonize enemies and rarely occurs in practice. The new genetic evidence suggests it was ubiquitous.

He could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.

MmO2, formerly the mobile unit of British Telecom, said it would take a charge of $2.2 billion on the sale.

The price of Altria's 7.65 percent bond due in 2008 rose sharply as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.73 percent, from 7.61 percent on Monday. S.& P. said it would not now consider a credit downgrading because the reduction in the size of the appeal bond for Philip Morris ''has averted the possibility of its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the very near term.''

First Energy said the move would reduce its second-quarter profit by $63 million, or 21 cents a share.

GPU Argentina was spun off by FirstEnergy and is now controlled by a director, John T. Banigan, who will decide what to do with Emdersa, a FirstEnergy spokeswoman, Kristen Baird, said. FirstEnergy acquired Emdersa as part of its $10.8 billion purchase of GPU Inc. in 2001.

Senior Partner of Fuchsberg & Fuchsberg, a New York City plaintiff's personal injury firm, passed away on April 15, 2003, at the age of 87. He was one of five siblings (including the late Honorable Jacob D. Fuchsberg, a former Court of Appeals Judge), all of whom had worked together at the firm at one time or another. Abraham served the firm as its Senior Partner for over 25 years. After graduating Magna Cum Laude at the College of the City of New York, Mr. Fuchsberg (pronounced Fyooks-berg) served his country in the U.S. Army and was made an instructor at the Philippine Institute of Armed Forces. After his service Abraham obtained his law degree from St. John's University (1950), when he then joined his brother Jacob in establishing the firm of Fuchsberg & Fuchsberg. The firm became nationally recognized for its representation of the injured, and was the first firm in the United States to ever obtain a million dollar verdict for a personal injury victim. Mr. Fuchsberg devoted his life to the preservation of victims' rights. He served as President of the American Trial Lawyers Civil Justice Foundation, President of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association and President of the Big Apple Pothole Corporation. He was an active member of the Board of Governors for the American Trial Lawyers Association for 35 years, and was selected as a Charter Member of Atla's Presidents Club in 1999. Mr. Fuchsberg was a Patron Founder of the Trial Lawyers for Public Justice. Abraham Fuchsberg was Editor-InChief of the Trial Lawyers Quarterly until 2002, having served in an editorial capacity since 1964. He is the author of ''Modern New York Discovery,'' ''New York Evidence'' and ''Poetic Justice,'' a book of his poetry and insights. He also wrote numerous articles for the New York Law Journal. Mr. Fuchsberg was Associate Editor of the National Trial Lawyer, New York, and a Contributing Editor for Medical Malpractice Law and Strategy. As a public speaker he has addressed tens of thousands of listeners. Through the Abraham Fuchsberg Family Foundation, Mr. Fuchsberg provided over a quarter century's support for consumers, the injured, the needy, and many Jewish philanthropies, including the United Jewish Appeal. Abraham Fuchsberg was widely considered a brilliant legal strategist, a tough negotiator and a tireless supporter of the underpriviliged. In his own verse: ''We do not toil for fatted calves, but for the have-nots, not the haves. We speak for the lost, the lame, the dying, All who come to us for justice crying. To raise up all who may be falling-That indeed is our proud calling.'' He is survived by his loving wife Shirley Fuchsberg, daughters Irene Minkoff and Rita Fuchsberg, his grandson Jonathan Minkoff, and his granddaughter Sarah Minkoff. A memorial service is being planned, the details of which will be announced on the website: www.thenewyorkfirm.com In lieu of flowers, friends are asked to make a tax deductable donation to the Abraham Fuchsberg Family Foundation, 100 Church St, Suite 1800, NY, NY 10007.",2003-04-20T05:00:00+0000

Born in New York City to Josephine and D.D. Vincent, Gina was an artist by training, with a gifted eye for color and pattern. Gina did volunteer work for many years and assisted her husband in his business affairs. As a young woman, Gina spent a number of years in Italy, where she was wined and dined by the sons and daughters of the ruling class. With a keen sense of adventure, and first hand experience of ''la dolce vita'', Gina escaped with her father through Casablanca back to America when World War II broke out. At the end of the war Gina met and married Noeth B. Gillette; a young naval aviator from the great western state of Montana. Gina's interests included the fine arts, needle point, reading, traveling, gardening, sports shopping, Etruscan culture, and her many cats. Gina loved her ritual evening swim followed by a hot bath and a glass of one of her favorite California white wines. This ritual was always followed by an Italian dinner prepared by her beloved husband Noeth; a man of great intelligence, generosity and humor, who preceded her in death by 10 years. Gina leaves behind many good friends; two daughters, Maria and Lisa; a son-in-law, John Manzo; a granddaughter, Alisa; and two cousins, Grace Mungiole and Lucille Archer; who were both like sisters to her.

The Third Battalion, Fourth Marines was one of the rawest expressions of that might. Based in Twentynine Palms, Calif., it specializes in desert warfare, and its forces number about 1,500 troops, equipped during the war in Iraq with about 30 Abrams tanks and 60 armored assault vehicles, backed up with whatever artillery and aircraft were required for its missions, like 155-millimeter howitzers and Cobra gunships and fighter jets. The battalion made the ground shake, quite literally, as it rumbled north from Kuwait through Iraq, beginning its march by seizing the Basra airport, continuing on past Nasiriya, into the desert and through a sandstorm that turned the sky red and became, at its worst moments, a hurricane of sand that rocked armored vehicles like plastic toys nudged by a child's finger.

Instead, Mr. McGreevey named John E. Wallace, a judge from Gloucester County, to replace Justice James H. Coleman Jr., the first black on the court. Administration officials have said that Mr. McGreevey's support for Ms. Farber, who was born in Cuba, waned after he learned that a bench warrant had been issued for her arrest when she did not appear in court for a traffic ticket. Ms. Farber says she never received notice of the hearing, and she accused the governor's spokesmen of making ''defamatory statements'' about her. The nomination will require the Senate's approval.

A smart, ambitious employee would never sign up for the afternoon of fly-fishing, for instance, because you couldn't lose the smell of fish in time for the evening cocktail party, and because you could wind up wasting your afternoon with guys who worked in the once crucial but now irrelevant pipeline division.

Recognized by the Collector's Club as the foremost philatelist of the latter half of the 20th Century, specializing in the fields of German States and U.S. Locals and U.S. Pre-cancels, John Boker has earned many of the field's highest awards, including the Smithsonian Institution's Lifetime Achievement Award (2002), the Robson Lowe Memorial Medal (2000), the Philatelic Foundation's ''Meritorious Service'' Medal, the Luff Award, the Berlin Philatelic Club's Lindenberg Medal (1981), the Collector's Club Medal (1970), the Lichtenstein Award (1967). and the Tilleard Medal (1967). He was a member ''Honoris Causa'' of the International Jury at CAPEX (1978). Chairman of the Expert Committee of the Philatelic Foundation, Chairman of the special Anphilex Invitational Exhibition of Classic Stamps (1971), Signer of the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists (1964), member of the International Juries since 1956, President of the Pre-cancel Stamp Society, President of the New York Pre-cancel Club, and twenty-five year member and former President and Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Collector's Club of New York. Boker traces his involvement in precancels back to age 10 when he came into possession of a box of stamps that were primarily New York and New Jersey Precancels. Being, at the time, unable to afford collecting both states, he opted to concentrate on NY and so began what was ultimately to become the finest aggregation of precancels ever put together in one album of any description. John Boker, a U.S. infantry Major and recipient of the Bronze Star, played a significant role working with the American and British Intelligence Service during, and particularly at the close of, World War II. He is best known for his work in interrogation and early ''Cold-War'' activities. Elected in 1990 to the ''Hall of Fame of Military Intelligence Service,'' Boker concluded his involvement with U.S. Intelligence as a post-War consultant for the newly established CIA. His contributions to World War II military intelligence history is documented in a number of books on the subject, notably ''The Service: The Memoirs of General Reinhard Gehlen,'' and Mary Ellen Reese's ''General Reinhard Gehlen: The CIA Connection,'' a dramatic account of the close connections between the chief of German Intelligence and U.S. spy units after World War II. Well-known by antique dealers and knife collectors, Boker, or ''Treebrand,'' superior quality pocketknives are foremost among the various types of cutlery and hand tools manufactured by H. Boker & Co. (Est. 1837) until the merger of the company with New Britain Machine in 1965. Boker's extensive business career also included his role as Director of Burnham Corporation from 1972 to 1988, Director and Vice President of the Nelson Fund Securities Company from 1958 to 1975, and Director of New Britain Machine from 1965 until its merger into Litton Industries in 1968. John Boker was born in 1913 in New York City, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale University in 1933. He is predeceased by his wife of 52 years, Polly Lupie Boker, and is survived by his two daughters, Pamela Boker and Joan Shisler, and six grandchildren.",2003-04-20T05:00:00+0000

us,A Story That Still Chills,"Something possessed six young people on that night in 1963. The Angel Lounge, a run-down bar in Lodi, in Bergen County, certainly held few saints. The account of the brutal shooting of two policemen continues to draw shivers and speculation, even after four decades. In ''Night of the Devil: The Untold Story of Thomas Trantino and the Angel Lounge Killings'' (Camino Books), David Stout, a Washington reporter for The New York Times, sifts through the accounts once again, bringing focus to a barroom haze. What remains clear is that two men and four women loitered together around end-of-the-night drinks. Minutes later, the revelers were gone and two police officers, who had been checking for underage drinkers, lay in blood, stripped to their underwear. In the hunt for the shooters, one of the men, Frank Falco, was shot dead when the police confronted him in a Manhattan hotel room. The second man, Thomas Trantino, surrendered and was ultimately convicted after one of the most celebrated criminal trials in state history. Mr. Stout unravels the conflicting stories and patiently peels away the improbable. The author has his own motives and his own demons from the strangling murder of an aunt, and his approach to violent crime is unsentimental. And Thomas Trantino? Only in his 20's at the time, he was saved from execution. And he became the longest-serving prisoner on record before being released to a Camden halfway house in 2001.

us,"Questions of Assent, Questions of Belief","It is a bit hard to understand why Stanley Moss is not more famous. Maybe it's because he is so happily rather than haplessly predictable. A HISTORY OF COLOR: New and Collected Poems (Seven Stories, paper, $17.95) covers four decades of his work, starting with ''The Wrong Angel'' (1966), and reveals an astonishingly intact intellect and sensibility. In a sense Moss has been writing the same poem for more than 40 years -- elliptical meditations that take the self as a starting point of intellectual autobiography. There are debts to modernism here, but they show up as subtle homages, as a line pastiched from Eliot (''I should be grateful for another louse,'' he writes in ''The Louse'') or a loving echo of Marianne Moore (''What are years? Not a herd of cattle,'' we read in ''The Falcon''). Moss is constantly talking to the past. Yet the most repeated word in these 250 pages is God, and the fact that Moss's God is the God of the dis- or the unbeliever suggests that the best religious poetry still comes out of longing rather than conviction: ''I do not believe the spirits of the dead / are closer to God than the living,'' he writes in ''Creed.'' Even when religion is not the overt subject, as in a poem like ''2002, Alas,'' clearly written in response to Sept. 11, he is framing questions of assent, consent and belief. As neither a sentimentalist nor an ironist but a Shelleyan humanist, Stanley Moss is very much an acquired taste and deserves much more critical attention. J. T. Barbarese",2003-04-20T05:00:00+0000

NextMedia Outdoor of Denver, which now owns the sign, filed suit for financial damages after the township cut electricity to the sign. The township argues that the sign was built without a public hearing or zoning board approval. In June 2001, Mr. Levinsohn, a representative for the now-defunct Philcor Media, met with several township officials and decided that the billboard was exempt from local zoning laws because it would be on state land, a township spokeswoman said. At the time, Mr. Levinsohn and Mr. Taffet, who was also working with Philcor, were running Mr. McGreevey's gubernatorial campaign. When Mr. McGreevey took office, he named Mr. Levinsohn chief counsel and Mr. Taffet chief of staff. They have since resigned. Michael J. Grabell",2003-04-20T05:00:00+0000
us,Pursued by Bears,"Generations of children have taken the Berenstain Bears of Jan and Stan Berenstain into their hearts. Many a 4-year-old has found comfort in the archetypal characters: the bumbling father, the intelligent, all-knowing mother, the universal brother and sister. In Bear Country, youngsters safely approach common issues: the world of family (''The Berenstain Bears' New Baby'') and friendship (their ''No Girls Allowed''), fears (their ''Afraid of the Dark'') and anxieties (their ''Go to School''). The Berenstains' success is measured by over 260 million copies of hundreds of titles sold. DOWN A SUNNY DIRT ROAD: An Autobiography (Random House, $20; ages 8 and up) is a dual memoir by the artists, both born in Philadelphia in 1923. It is told in alternating chapters, using a heavily illustrated procedure much like that of another narrative cartoonist in ''Bill Peet: An Autobiography.'' The Berenstains met at art school in 1941, but soon Stan was a medical artist in the Army, and Jan was taking classes while working as an aircraft riveter. The authors effectively mix narrative cartoons, photographs and their early schoolwork in this part of their story. Their marriage and commercial success as magazine illustrators are moderately interesting, but the real core of their autobiography describes the birth of their first children's book. They were fans of Dr. Seuss, and felt a similar presentation would work with their cartooning style, sense of humor and family adventures. The Berenstains traveled from Philadelphia to New York to meet with their editor for the Random House ''Beginner Books'' series, Theodor Geisel (also known as Dr. Seuss). Geisel used brutally blunt terms to describe the editorial changes he wanted. The Berenstains were crushed, but struggled to understand. The collaboration that transformed ''Freddy Bear's Spanking'' into ''The Big Honey Hunt,'' published in 1962 and still in print, is a primer in how picture books can be made to work. Gradually the Berenstains developed a kind of protocol for their stories: ''easy words, short sentences, word/picture clues, rollicking rhythm, resolute rhyme . . . shameless slapstick and outrageous jokes.'' Alas, the text of their memoir was not edited so rigorously. The sentences are often convoluted, and the book conveys little insight into how the Berenstains work today or what techniques they use now that the Bears have grown to a business that includes their sons Leo and Michael, producing paperback picture books, chapter books, videos, television cartoons and, of course, a Web site.

Drinks had already been served before takeoff, and we were both frankly bombed, our mouths half open, our heads tipped back.

us,Helen Overcomes Bad Men and Bad Press,"LIKE Eve before her and Guinevere after, Helen of Troy survived war and disaster only to take the blame for causing them. Homer and Virgil paint her as a wanton, fickle princess whose desertion of her royal husband, Menelaus, led to the Trojan War. In classic drama, Helen fares equally badly: Shakespeare cast her as a vain and rather silly woman in ''Troilus and Cressida.'' Euripides tries to rehabilitate her, but to do so he has to divide her in two: a phantom Helen who elopes to Troy and her real self, who hides out in Egypt, craving redemption. Helen has received more favorable treatment in her pop culture appearances (she got some sympathy from Xena, Warrior Princess, who happened to be a childhood pal). But in general she's been assigned to the darker side of history. In the ''Oresteia,'' Aeschylus makes her name into a curse: she's ''hell to cities, hell to ships and hell to men.''",2003-04-20T05:00:00+0000

He then entered Columbia University, but left to serve in the 7th Fleet in WW II. He was a true patriot and loved his country dearly.

His story-telling is legendary. Mr. Cole was President of Igoe Brothers, Inc., a wire and steel manufacturer, where he was in the forefront in dealing in the Eastern European open market in the trading of steel rods. He traveled extensively in his work. He served on the Manpower Commission of the State of New Jersey under Governor Hughes, and was a Director of Carteret Savings and Loan, among others. Mr. Cole was a man of diverse tastes from caviar to Tootsie Rolls. He felt equally at home at the Stork Club and the Point Pleasant Boardwalk, dining at the Four Seasons or eating at the diner.

The ruling was issued last month in a child-pornography case involving a Bronx man. The charge of possessing child pornography will be dismissed against the defendant, Harvey Perez, his lawyer said. Prosecutors had no comment yesterday. The judge, Denny Chin, ruled that F.B.I. agents ""acted with reckless disregard for the truth"" in preparing an affidavit used to get a search warrant for Mr. Perez's computer. Mr. Perez was accused of joining an Internet group and possessing pornography e-mailed from other members. But Judge Chin noted that not all members of the group chose to be on the e-mail list. The government has also decided not to appeal a similar ruling in St. Louis and has dropped charges against that defendant, his lawyer said. &#0160;&#0160;Benjamin Weiser (NYT) ",2003-04-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Sprint's First-Quarter Net Income Rose,"The Sprint Corporation said yesterday that first-quarter net income rose to $1.67 billion from $140 million in the year-earlier period on a gain from the sale of its directories business. The directory sale added $1.31 billion to earnings. Total sales fell 4.5 percent, to $6.34 billion from $6.64 billion. Sprint is relying on expense reductions to generate profit amid declining sales at its main phone business and slowing wireless revenue. The new chief executive, Gary Forsee, has less room to slash costs than his predecessor, William Esrey, who eliminated about 15,000 jobs in the last two years, analysts said. The company lowered its forecast for 2003 per-share profits at the local and long-distance phone unit by 10 cents a share, to $1.30 to $1.35. It also expects a sales decline of as much as 7 percent. That compares with a previous sales estimate of a low single-digit-rate decline. Sprint PCS's 2003 loss-forecast range was widened by 5 cents a share to 45 cents to 50 cents a share. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Sprint's main phone unit rose 22 cents, to $11.27 a share. The company released results after the close of regular trading. In after-hours trading, the shares slipped 62 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $10.65.",2003-04-22T05:00:00+0000

Prosecutors had no comment yesterday. The judge, Denny Chin, ruled that F.B.I. agents ''acted with reckless disregard for the truth'' in preparing an affidavit used to get a search warrant for Mr. Perez's computer. Mr. Perez was accused of joining an Internet group and possessing pornography e-mailed from other members. But Judge Chin noted that not all members of the group chose to be on the e-mail list.

The company posted a first-quarter loss tied to continued weak spending in the telecommunications market and its previously announced settlement of asbestos claims. It forecast second-quarter results in line with expectations. Corning's shares rose 10 cents, to $6.21. ""Putting aside the strength of our fiber and cable business in Asia last quarter, we are not seeing a lift in our telecommunications businesses, but this does not surprise us,"" the company's chief financial officer, James Flaws, said. Corning has been battered by the slump in the telecommunications sector, which accounts for half its sales. The company had previously said that cost controls, growth in its technologies segment and stable sales volume in optical fiber and cable would increase results. Corning reported a net loss for the first quarter of $205 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of $90 million, or 10 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding one-time items, the company posted break-even results. Analysts had been expecting Corning to post a first-quarter loss, excluding one-time items, of 3 cents a share, according to a survey conducted by Thomson First Call. &#0160;&#0160; ( Reuters ) ",2003-04-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Qualcomm Says Income More Than Doubled,"Qualcomm Inc., whose mobile-telephone technology is used by 135 million people, said yesterday that second-quarter net income more than doubled amid higher demand for handsets containing the company's software and chips. Qualcomm increased its fiscal 2003 profit forecast and said in a statement that it planned to sell its Vesper phone unit in Brazil. The company, which makes cell-phone chips and software and receives a royalty on every handset that uses its patented code-division multiple access, or C.D.M.A., technology, has benefited from rising demand in the United States and Asia for phones that include color screens, cameras and games. Second-quarter net income was $103 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with $43.9 million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier, Qualcomm said. Results include $160 million in asset impairment expenses for Vesper, the company said. Revenue increased 50 percent to $1.04 billion from $696.1 million. The company said profit in the year ending Sept. 30, excluding wireless investments, was expected to be $1.38 to $1.41 a share. Qualcomm had previously forecast profit of $1.34 to $1.39. Excluding the company's QSI investment segment, which contains the Vesper assets, second-quarter profit would have been $314 million, or 38 cents a share, Qualcomm said. That compares with analyst forecasts of 36 cents on that basis. Shares of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, rose to $34.15 in after-hours late trading after falling 23 cents, to $32.98 in regular trading.

In ''Room 606: The SAS House and the World of Arne Jacobsen'' (Phaidon, $69.95), the architect Michael Sheridan chronicles the life of a room at what is now the SAS Royal Hotel in Copenhagen. Built in the 1960's, a breakthrough decade for free-spirited design, it was envisioned as a groovy pit stop for travelers. Some of Jacobsen's most eloquently economical designs -- the Egg and Butterfly chairs -- were created for the hotel, and Room 606 still oozes a cool modernism, from the spaceship-shape hanging lamps to the wenge built-in bed stand (albeit with pass twin beds). The room, available for $598 a night, is maintained in pristine condition. In just one room (and 270 pages) the book explores Jacobsen's career as an architect of glass houses, zoomy restaurants and complex textiles. JULIE V. IOVINE",2003-04-24T05:00:00+0000

Perhaps the best known of these is Buckhead, a semi-urban sprawl of strip malls, mansions (both old and new), world-class shopping and dining and a night-life scene with something for every kind of frat boy.

us,Technology Briefing: Telecommunications," COURT SAYS VERIZON MUST IDENTIFY DOWNLOADERS A federal court said yesterday that Verizon Communications must reveal the names of customers suspected of downloading copyrighted songs from the Internet without permission even as it appeals the decision to a higher court. Judge John Bates of the United States District Court in Washington said Verizon must reveal the names of the two reported copyright infringers within two weeks unless the appeals court says otherwise. Judge Bates originally ordered Verizon to reveal the customers' names in January, but Verizon had argued that their identities should be protected as it pursues an appeal. The ruling is another legal victory for the recording industry as it tries to stamp out the unauthorized Internet song-swapping it says is partly responsible for a decline in CD sales. The Recording Industry Association of America took Verizon to court last summer in an effort to get the company to help crack down on online song-swapping. The association argued that Verizon is obligated under the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act to help its members protect their copyrights. Verizon says it is willing to help, but argued that the law applies only to Web pages stored on its computers, not traffic on the peer-to-peer networks that merely travel across its wires. After Judge Bates rejected that argument in January, Verizon said that the law also violated free-speech and due-process rights protected by the Constitution. ( Reuters ) ",2003-04-25T05:00:00+0000

Nobody was injured in the incident. The police said they did not believe that the youth had any connection to terrorist groups. The hijacking began in the northern city of Bremen when the teenager, a naturalized German citizen, seized a bus and its 14 passengers. He demanded the release of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who was arrested in Pakistan last year.

It's not as if we weren't bringing in some culture of our own to fill that unfortunate vacuum. It was on April 10 as well, by happy coincidence, that the United States announced the imminent arrival of nightly newscasts from Dan Rather, Jim Lehrer and Brit Hume on newly liberated Iraqi TV.

An antiwar sitcom that blossomed during wartime, ''M*A*S*H'' ran for 11 years, and it was explicitly intended as a commentary on Vietnam. But the show's setting was the Korean War of the 1950's, a chronological remove that gave the show's creators a perverse freedom, as well as a stamp of universality. To watch it now is to gaze back at an era of angry skepticism, personified by the prankster antihero Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda). In the bleak universe of ''M*A*S*H,'' spokespeople are liars, generals are bullies and anyone who mouths patriotic slogans is a dupe or a hypocrite. ''By the time we waded in, by the time we came on the air, people really wanted to get the hell out of Vietnam,'' recalled Larry Gelbart, one of the producers.

I was informed that I must pack up completely and move out while the work is being done. They said they would cover the cost of moving my furniture to storage but would not cover the cost of my alternative accommodations.

us,"Cupid, Circe and Jesus","''Nothing quite like these photographs had been attempted before,'' Julian Cox, assistant curator of photographs at the J. Paul Getty Museum, writes in JULIA MARGARET CAMERON: The Complete Photographs (Getty, $150). Perhaps the most celebrated photographer in Victorian England, Cameron (1815-79) ''proposed her own radical brand of photographic truth, one that dissolved the boundaries between fact and fiction and image and life.'' She created the bulk of her major work in a seaside village on the Isle of Wight, near Emily and Alfred Tennyson. When painters, writers, musicians, scientists and politicians came to pay homage to the poet laureate, they were invariably met by Cameron imploring them for a portrait session. This complete collection of Cameron's reveals the profound bipolarities of her production: extravagantly mannered yet psychologically intimate, wildly ambitious yet intensely devotional, unabashedly painterly yet enraptured with the written word. Her gallery of portraiture ranges from Charles Darwin to Anthony Trollope, the literary references of her narrative tableaus run from Milton to Byron, her spectral ''Annunciations'' and ''Salutations'' transform domestic servants into exalted Madonnas. Her images of children are delightful and disturbing. As models for Cupid or Circe or the baby Jesus, they emanate ethereal anxiety. The wet-collodion process Cameron employed was time-consuming, technically demanding and dangerous (the cyanide vapors and silver nitrates could cause blindness or worse). But such details did not matter to her. ''From the first moment I handled my lens with a tender ardor,'' she wrote; ''and it has become to me as a living thing, with voice and memory and creative vigor.''

His vision was news. But before becoming that Robert Frank, he was already an auspicious artist revolutionizing straight photography. After emigrating as a young man from Switzerland, the son of a middle-class family, he went to work as a fashion photographer for Harper's Bazaar. Though he was good at it, it boxed him in. So in the early 1950's, this 27-year-old, driven by reckless curiosity and intuition, took off for London and Wales to work entirely without restraints. Frank has published only a scant selection of pictures from that journey. Many stunning, never-before-seen images of that time are now finally available to us in the exhibition ''Robert Frank: London/Wales,'' which opens May 10 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington.

Except when he's making a movie on location, Malkovich and his family live here, near Provence, year round. But lately he has been involved in a dispute with the French government -- one he'd rather not go into detail about -- and now Malkovich may have to look for another home. ''I'll probably have to leave,'' Malkovich, who is 49, says softly, sitting in the enormous kitchen that took him two years to get just right. Hours ago, Malkovich returned on the train from Paris, where he was discussing a play he recently directed, and he is wearing a black suit of his own design and a pale blue shirt. He has a look of elegant scruffiness -- he is big-boned, and his curly gray-blond hair and beard seem to circle his face. Nicole Peyran, the mother of his son and daughter, is with the kids at the family apartment in Aix-en-Provence, an hour away, where the children attend a bilingual school. Solo for the afternoon, Malkovich is preparing lunch, carving thin slices off a huge piece of prosciutto that has its hairy hoof still attached. The leg of the pig is secured by a metal rod attached to a small vise. ''Oh,'' Malkovich explains, ''I had this built. There's a butcher in town that will do that for you.'' Malkovich pauses.

us,"For MetroStars Magee, Saturday Was Quite a Day"," BOB BRADLEYs first victory as the MetroStars coach, 1-0 over Columbus, was also his 83rd in Major League Soccer, a league record. The rookie MIKE MAGEE set a team record when he became the youngest player (18 years 236 days) to score a goal, his first as a professional. Magee, an early replacement for striker JAIME MORENO, who left the match with a hamstring injury, was later replaced by JACOB LeBLANC. Magee needed to fly home to Chicago to attend his girlfriends senior prom. I got my first goal and it takes a lot of pressure off the next game, Magee said. There is a lot of pressure with both the prom and M.L.S. Ah, the problems of youth. Magee had started the MetroStars first two games of the season, looking a bit tentative and getting pushed around by the defense. There are times when he will start and there are days when he will be a reserve, Bradley said. For young guys growing there are always ups and downs. The same cannot be said for the clubs other top rookie, midfielder RICARDO CLARK. Clark looked comfortable and confident in all three games. Against Columbus (the last eight matches between the teams have been decided by a goal), he made a 50-yard dash in the second half that ended with a blistering shot on goal from nearly 30 yards out. After a disastrous 2002 season in which the teams central defense struggled, EDDIE POPE and STEVE JOLLEY have been solid in front of goalkeeper TIM HOWARD. CLINT MATHIS has been assertive in midfield after coming back from a hernia operation, but he has yet to regain the form that made him one of the most dangerous players in the league. On Saturday in the first half, he buried a free kick into the defensive wall. In the second half, he set himself up for a left-footed shot from the top of the area, which he pushed over the goal.

This time, he was at the Rockefeller Center ice rink in Manhattan, hitting a few lobs, smiling for the cameras and playing the role of ambassador for the United States Tennis Associations kickoff of USA Tennis Month. Roddick, who arrived in New York shortly after midnight, was on a makeshift court built on the rink to play doubles with Alexandra Stevenson against Jim Courier and Zina Garrison. Despite the loss to Agassi, who is now the worlds top-ranked mens player, Roddick said he felt good heading into the European clay-court season, which culminates with the French Open next month. Ive had a couple of knick-and-knack injuries, and so its been kind of spotty: one good week, one bad week, Roddick said. I still have to come into my own, but I had a good week in Houston and pushed Andre to the ropes. Roddick, who lost in the first round at the French Open last year, said he planned to prepare this year by playing outdoors on clay in Hamburg, Germany; St. Polten, Austria; and Rome. James Blake, another rising American talent who was on hand yesterday, also plans to play in Rome and Hamburg as warm-ups to the French Open. To see if Americans can prove once again, we can play on clay, Blake said. I hope Andy and me can show that. Yesterday, Blake, 23, and Roddick, 20, wanted to show a future generation the fun side of the game. People just walking by may see us, Roddick said as passersby looked on. They may never have picked up a racket, but thats the point of this. To show people how cool tennis is. ",2003-04-28T05:00:00+0000

He also said some schoolchildren could miss the opening of school because of cutbacks in a program that offers required vaccinations. Dr. Benjamin K. Chu, president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, said proposed cuts in Medicaid would reduce the agency's revenue by $200 million, forcing layoffs and service cutbacks. The proposed cuts are intended to help close a budget gap of some $11.5 billion, in the state's $90.8 billion budget. Randal C. Archibold (NYT)",2003-04-29T05:00:00+0000

The verdict came after a different jury in the same court said last month that Corvis products used technology protected by another Ciena patent, but did not infringe two other patents. Damages will be determined at a separate trial before Judge Joseph Farnan Jr. after appeals, according to court papers. Both companies were founded by the inventor David R. Huber, Ciena in 1992 and Corvis in 1997, lawyers said during the three-day trial. Ciena reported $361.1 million in fiscal 2002 sales and a $1.59 billion loss, while Corvis reported $20.2 million in 2002 sales and a $507.7 million loss, as the industry struggles through a worldwide slowdown. While Mr. Huber is listed as one of four inventors on the 1996 Ciena patent, he did not have a license when he left to form Corvis, and ''it's wrong to take somebody else's technology,'' Ciena's lawyer, Ruffin Cordell, told jurors in Federal District Court in Wilmington, Del. Company officials did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. Shares of Ciena rose 24 cents, or about 5.8 percent, to $4.46.

He was 93 years old and had been living at St. Paul's Towers in Oakland, CA for the past 16 years. A graduate of Yale, class of '30, and of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia, class of '34, Dr. Nayer was an internist who specialized in pulmonary medicine. He practiced at his office on 86th Street and at the NY Veterans Administration, Montefiore and Beth Israel Hospitals over a career that spanned 53 years and which included being a founding member and Medical Director of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (HIP), a president of the New York Lung Association and a Medical Officer with the New York City Fire Department. During WW II, Dr. Nayer served in the Army as a Captain and Chief of Medical Services as part of the European African Middle Eastern Campaign in Persia. A Renaissance man of extraordinary intelligence, he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Al Phi (medical honor society). An avid reader and scholar, he was a lover of Shakespeare, Freud and mathemathics and his curiosity ranged from politics to poetry. Herman Nayer was beloved by his patients for his kindness, expertise and sense of humor and will be sorely missed by his daughters, Anne of Davis, CA and Louise, of San Francisco, son-in-law Jim and granddaughters Sarah, Laura and Lily.

us,Technology Briefing: Telecommunications," CORVIS INFRINGED CIENA PATENT, JURY SAYS The Corvis Cor- poration, which makes equipment for fiber optic telecommunications systems, infringed a patent owned by its rival, the Ciena Corporation, a federal court jury decided yesterday. The verdict came after a different jury in the same court said last month that Corvis products used technology protected by another Ciena patent, but did not infringe two other patents. Damages will be determined at a separate trial before Judge Joseph Farnan Jr. after appeals, according to court papers. Both companies were founded by the inventor David R. Huber, Ciena in 1992 and Corvis in 1997, lawyers said during the three-day trial. Ciena reported $361.1 million in fiscal 2002 sales and a $1.59 billion loss, while Corvis reported $20.2 million in 2002 sales and a $507.7 million loss, as the industry struggles through a worldwide slowdown. While Mr. Huber is listed as one of four inventors on the 1996 Ciena patent, he did not have a license when he left to form Corvis, and ""it's wrong to take somebody else's technology,"" Ciena's lawyer, Ruffin Cordell, told jurors in Federal District Court in Wilmington, Del. Company officials did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. Shares of Ciena rose 24 cents, or about 5.8 percent, to $4.46. Shares of Corvis dropped 8 cents, to 73 cents. &#0160; (Bloomberg News) ",2003-04-29T05:00:00+0000

All of the attacks occurred in Hollis. On April 7 at 5:45 a.m., a 57-year-old woman was waiting for a bus at 193rd Street and Jamaica Avenue, when the suspect, who had a gun, took her to an isolated location, where he raped and robbed her, the police said. On April 23 at 5:50 a.m., the armed suspect tried to drag a 61-year-old woman into a driveway near the corner of Liberty Avenue and 187th Street. She yelled for help, and he fled. Two days later, a 60-year-old woman was waiting for a bus at the corner of Liberty and Camden Avenues when the armed suspect took her to an isolated location and robbed and raped her. DNA obtained after the attacks matched DNA obtained after an unsolved rape in 1998, in which a 46-year-old woman was sexually assaulted near 102nd Avenue and 186th Street, the police said.

Profit from continuing operations this year is expected to be 27 cents to 42 cents a share, Goodrich said. Its previous forecast was for $1.45 to $1.60 a share. Costs this year for write-downs, job cuts and plant closings will be more than five times what was expected, Goodrich said.

He had taken a leave as chief executive and resigned as chairman March 13 after his two-count federal indictment. The chief financial officer, William Murphy, will succeed Mr. Cassese as chief executive. A board member, Thomas Berry, was appointed chairman last month. Computer Horizons, a provider of computer services to companies, is fighting an unsolicited takeover offer from Aquent, a Boston-based information-technology consulting company. Computer Horizons has urged shareholders to reject Aquent's proposal to nominate two directors. Aquent, saying Computer Horizons is too small to compete on its own, offered $5 a share, or $146 million, on April 14. Aquent owns about 1.1 million, or 4 percent, of Computer Horizons shares. Computer Horizons has ignored the takeover offer, Aquent has said. Computer Horizons sued Aquent in Federal District Court in New Jersey yesterday, asking Aquent to ''correct its misleading proxy materials and invalidate any proxies received prior to such correction,'' according to a Computer Horizons statement.
