us,Top Dogs,"The English are a nation of animal lovers, and the new edition of THE ENGLISH DOG AT HOME (Chatto & Windus/Trafalgar Square/David and Charles, Paper, $11.95) focuses on all manner of dogs: dogs with pedigrees reaching back to Queen Victoria's dachshunds, corgis raised by Queen Elizabeth II and the Queen Mother, as well as mongrels of all shapes and sizes. As the authors, the English dog lover Felicity Wigan and the London journalist Victoria Mather, point out, these dogs have a distinct advantage in that they belong to the landed gentry; they live in fine houses (some dating back hundreds of years) and some eat off fine china and sprawl on antique sofas. They hunt in Scotland and on country estates, they attend charity events and they are greatly adored -- even to the point of excess. Caroline Keith reports that her husband, David, was so besotted with their long-haired dachshund, Phoebe (a descendant of one of Queen Victoria's pets), that he could not bear to let the dog reproduce. ""He felt there was always a great danger in childbirth,"" Mrs. Keith says. ""He wasn't worried about me having children, but Phoebe was quite different."" Pat Menzies says that she and her husband, John, ""agreed about how to bring up the children, but not the dogs."" Geoffrey Shakerley's photographs are excellent, showing wonderful views of the countryside and interiors of magnificent Edwardian, Georgian and Jacobean houses and castles. That these dogs live blessedly indulged lives is obvious.

The panel said last week that the New York Republican had acted ""in an improper and inappropriate manner"" in allowing his brother, Armand, to use the Senator's office to lobby for a Long Island defense contractor, but the committee found no proof that the Senator had broken the law or Senate rules. Mr. D'Amato said that he was unaware that his brother had used his signature and letterhead to make inquiries on behalf of the contractor. Some other charges of wrongdoing were dropped for lack of evidence after nearly three dozen witnesses refused to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds. Mark Green, who brought the charges after his unsuccessful attempt to unseat Mr. D'Amato in 1988, accused the ethics panel of being reluctant ""to punish fellow politicians.""",1991-08-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Nobody's Paris but His Own,"""Let me say right away,"" writes Julian Green in his short, dreamlike book, PARIS (Marion Boyars/Rizzoli, $21.95), ""that I shall be making no mention of the great monuments or any of the places you would expect to find duly described."" Fair warning. His Paris is probably not your Paris -- or anything like it. Mr. Green, the author of more than 60 books and plays and a member of the Academie Francaise, was born in Paris in 1900, the son of American parents. He has spent most of his life in the French capital. His books deal broadly with man's futile search to comprehend his destiny. ""We're people in a book,"" he has written, ""who don't always know what the author wants."" So it's not surprising that Mr. Green's book of photographs and text -- in a bilingual edition, very ably translated by J. A. Underwood -- is full of philosophical speculations, moody reveries, flights into the past and future. From time to time the familiar Paris makes an appearance, but it is usually because Mr. Green has reason to lament or rail. He mourns the loss of trees, of bird sellers. He even loathes the Eiffel Tower. Mostly, though, Julian Green's Paris is mysterious and phantom-filled. ""Come with me down this street,"" he writes, ""and meet the ghosts of our earliest years."" Walking through the Palais-Royal is like ""entering an enchanted forest."" This is the Paris of a searcher who through the years has seemingly looked in every Parisian window, doorway, side street and alley for some sort of answer.",1991-08-11T05:00:00+0000

After the lifeboats were gone, 225 people waited to be rescued by helicopter as the listing vessel was tossed by 30-foot swells. One of the passengers, Irene Smith, said, ""We were so angry with the captain that we wanted to throw stones at him."" A captain's behavior in such circumstances is governed more by tradition than law, but one expert urged that he be prosecuted for ""betraying the responsibilities of a ship's master."" Captain Avranas, meanwhile, was unapologetic, saying he left early to help direct the rescue. ""When I give the order abandon ship, it doesn't matter what time I leave,"" he said. ""If some people want to stay, they can stay.""",1991-08-11T05:00:00+0000

They recommend a ""laddering technique"" so the securities come due in consecutive years or at other regular intervals. Buying directly from the Treasury saves commission fees. Auction dates are announced in many newspapers and in phone messages at Federal Reserve Banks and branches. Here are the securities available at auction and the most recent average yield. Bills: Maturities are 3 months (5.3%), 6 months (5.39%) and 1 year (5.88%). Minimum purchase $10,000. Notes: Maturities are 2 years (6.94%) to 10 years (7.94%); 2- and 3-year notes can be purchased for $5,000 or for multiples of $5,000; 4- to 10-year notes, for $1,000 or multiples of $1,000.

A music venue since 1961, the aging building on St. Peter Street in the French Quarter contains a small, dimly lighted room, serving no alcohol, with wooden benches a few feet from where the musicians play. PRESERVATION HALL: Music From the Heart (Norton, $29.95) is a social history of the musical institution that served as catalyst for the New Orleans revival of the last two decades and a chronicle of how the traditional idiom has endured more than three decades of lean times. ""Preservation Hall was invented and run by transplanted northerners,"" writes William Carter, a California writer and photographer who also plays jazz clarinet. The venue was originally an art gallery. After several years of informal gatherings at which jazz devotees passed the hat for musicians, the hall supplanted the gallery. Preservation Hall and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival were major forces in the city's cultural awakening. It is no accident that as New Orleans emerged from its segregation shackles, a succession of remarkable musicians -- the Neville Brothers, Dr. John, the Marsalis family, Harry Connick Jr. and Marlon Jordan, among others -- achieved national recognition, thereby broadening what Mr. Carter calls ""an untouchably pure form handed down from a golden age.""",1991-08-18T05:00:00+0000

Time Warner, which broadcast the concert to HBO cable subscribers around the country, picked up the tab for putting it all together and cleaning up afterward, and even people who had to sit a quarter-mile from the 158-foot-wide stage got to watch it all on a 15-by-30-foot television monitor.

Sandra Bernhard wasn't glimpsed, though it turned out that she had a role so prominent and so abrasive it must have sent at least a few viewers cowering under their seats in horror. Instead, the preview offered a pleasant buddy-movie caper with Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello, a film that was actually witty about its genre. When the two men were about to jump off a high ledge, the Aiello character quoted Butch Cassidy's line to Sundance: ""The fall will probably kill you.""

Teaching Bicycle Safety","While some schools offer classes in bicycle riding, it is still primarily up to parents and guardians to introduce children to bicycling and safe cycling skills. Here are some tips on bicycle safety from the Bicycle Institute of America, a Washington trade group.Buy a Bike That FitsBicycles that are too big are hard to control. Standing, a child should be able to straddle a bike with about an inch of clearance over the horizontal bar between the seat and handlebars. If the bike has no horizontal bar, use a yardstick to simulate one. Adjust the seat so that with the ball of the foot in the middle of the pedal, the leg is slightly bent when the pedal is all the way down. For maximum control, the handlebars should be more or less even with the seat. Wear a HelmetIf all cyclists wore helmets, 85 percent of fatalities and most permanent brain injuries could be prevented. Acceptable helmets carry stickers indicating approval by the Snell Memorial Foundation or the American National Standards Institute. Different Rules for Different AgesChildren age 6 and under should ride under adult supervision, even on sidewalks, which also have hazards, like driveway crossings. Children 7 to 8 may ride unsupervised but not in the street. With training, children 9 and older may ride on their own but should avoid busy streets until they show sound judgment. Know the BasicsChildren ready for street riding should be taught to ride with traffic, to walk a bike to the street before starting out, to differentiate among traffic signals, and to know that left turns can be made more safely by walking the bike across.",1991-08-24T05:00:00+0000

Their reasons have been different -- in Mr. Gore's case it was the desire to spend more time with his family -- but it is probably fair to say that none cares to risk having a lopsided loss on his Presidential Contender resume.

us,The Top 20: The Rose Bowl May Decide Who's No. 1,"The 1991 version of The New York Times Top 20 was compiled by Times staffer Michael Sisak, who put out a special issue of the student paper when Temple and Bill Cosby ended a 21-game losing streak. Sisak, who has been editing college football for 30 years, put Virginia No. 3 but ignored the tri-champion Georgia Tech in his 1990 pre-season top 20. Coaches' records are for careers. Since 28 games match ranked teams in a quasi-playoff, the Top 20 weighs those games, which are in boldface type. 1. WASHINGTON COACH: Don James (155-75-3, 20 years). 1990 RECORD: 10-2. STRENGTHS: The defense, with seven starters back, will dominate, with Lincoln Kennedy leading the nation's best line. The Huskies led the nation last year in allowing 1.9 yards a carry. WEAKNESSES: The defense must compensate until Billy Joe Hobert of Puyallup, Wash., adjusts at quarterback. He is replacing Mark Brunell, who suffered a spring-practice knee injury. OUTLOOK: Several analysts had picked Washington No. 1 before Brunell was hurt. The toughest games are Sept. 21 at Nebraska and, when Brunnell is expected back, Nov. 9 at Southern Cal. 2. MICHIGAN COACH: Gary Moeller (15-27-3, 4 years). 1990 RECORD: 9-3. STRENGTHS: The offensive line may be the best in the nation. Place-kicker J. D. Carlson is 47 of 47 on extra points. WEAKNESSES: Three secondary starters will be new, putting early pressure on the defensive line and linebackers. OUTLOOK: Two tough games (Sept. 14, Notre Dame, and Sept. 28, Florida State) are on the new grass home field, which will slow teams with turf fields. The other tough game is at Iowa Oct. 5. 3. FLORIDA STATE COACH: Bobby Bowden (205-74-3, 25 years). 1990 RECORD: 10-2. STRENGTHS: The Seminoles are the popular No. 1 choice because of their experience and the best freshman recruits. Casey Weldon was No. 2 in efficiency to Heisman Trophy winner Ty Detmer. WEAKNESSES: Can Florida State beat opponents with big defensive fronts? Last year, the Seminoles could not control Miami and Auburn, and were almost overcome by Penn State. OUTLOOK: In 1988, Florida State was a consensus No. 1 and lost its 1988 opener to Miami, 31-0. Brigham Young (Thursday) could be troublesome for a green safety, and tough games loom at Michigan (Sept. 28), with Miami (Nov. 16) and at Florida (Nov. 30). 4. PENN STATE COACH: Joe Paterno (229-60-3, 25 years). 1990 RECORD: 9-3. STRENGTHS: ""The wideouts are the best three we've had at Penn State,"" said Paterno, who is 10 victories from fourth place behind Bear Bryant, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Pop Warner. The defense is as talented as the No. 1 teams of 1982 and 1986. WEAKNESSES: Depth for the rebuilt offensive line and at quarterback is uncertain. ""We can't afford to lose Tony Sacca early,"" Paterno said of his quarterback. OUTLOOK: The players voted against Paterno to open with Georgia Tech on Wednesday, knowing other tough games are at Southern Cal (Sept. 14), B.Y.U. (Sept. 21), at Miami (Oct. 12) and Notre Dame (Nov. 16). 5. OKLAHOMA COACH: Gary Gibbs (15-7-0, 2 years). 1990 RECORD: 8-3. STRENGTHS: The Sooners are favored to win their first Big Eight title since 1987, and they are the best Oklahoma team since Barry Switzer resigned in 1989. WEAKNESSES: Having Cale Gundy pass more will add risks. OUTLOOK: Oklahoma will be the best of the three teams coming off probation and again eligible for all polls. Houston and Florida are the others. The tough games are Texas (Oct. 12), Colorado (Oct. 19) and at Nebraska (Nov. 29). 6. NOTRE DAME COACH: Lou Holtz (162-79-5, 21 years). 1990 RECORD: 9-3. STRENGTHS: The Irish have the nation's quickest and deepest team as a result of the superb recruiting class in 1990. Freshman Mike Miller is 3 inches shorter and 15 pounds lighter than Raghib (Rocket) Ismail but will be just as versatile. WEAKNESSES: Ten starters went to the pros. The defensive line has one returning starter, tackle George Williams, but he may miss the season, Notre Dame said, due to ""personal problems."" OUTLOOK: Miami is gone from the schedule, but tough games are at Michigan (Sept. 14), Southern Cal (Oct. 26), Tennessee (Nov. 9) and at Penn State (Nov. 16). Don't forget Hawaii (Nov. 30)! 7. FLORIDA COACH: Steve Spurrier (29-15-1, 4 years). 1990 RECORD: 9-2. STRENGTHS: Shane Matthews is a clone of his coach, the 1966 Heisman winner, at quarterback. WEAKNESSES: The defense lost six starters after having limited opponents to 85.5 yards a game. Overall depth could suffer because of the limits probation placed on recruiting. OUTLOOK: Florida should be 5-0 going into the first big test against Tennessee (Oct. 12). The other challenges are at Auburn (Nov. 2) and Florida State (Nov. 30). 8. MIAMI COACH: Dennis Erickson (71-34-1, 9 years). 1990 RECORD: 10-2. STRENGTHS: Junior Gino Torretta continues the line of quarterback succession. ""He perceives the game better than any quarterback I've had,"" said Coach Dennis Erickson. WEAKNESSES: Seven offensive starters are gone. The line is green except for fifth-year senior tackle Leon Searcy. OUTLOOK: The Times computer ranking picked Miami No. 1 for 1990. Two tough games are at home, where the last 36 have been victories, against Houston (Sept. 12) and Penn State (Oct. 12). The other challenge is at Florida State (Nov. 16). 9. CLEMSON COACH: Ken Hatfield (91-51-2, 12 years). 1990 RECORD: 9-3. STRENGTHS: The Tigers will have the best running attack in the Atlantic Coast Conference, led by sophomore tailback Ronald Williams and junior fullback Rudy Harris. WEAKNESSES: Six starters are gone from the defense that was the best in the nation last year. OUTLOOK: The two toughest games are Georgia Tech (Sept. 28) and at Georgia (Oct. 5). 10. IOWA COACH: Hayden Fry (179-139-8, 29 years). 1990 RECORD: 8-4. STRENGTHS: Seven starters return on offense and seven on defense. Last year, Matt Rodgers passed for 2,228 yards and 15 touchdowns and had a 60 percent completion rate. WEAKNESSES: The running backs are inexperienced with Big Ten most valuable player Nick Bell and Tony Stewart gone. They combined for 1,853 rushing yards and 462 passing yards last year. OUTLOOK: Success could hang on punt protection because blocked kicks cost Iowa three games last year. A favorable schedule has the Hawkeyes playing Michigan (Oct. 5) at home. 11. GEORGIA TECH COACH: Bobby Ross (86-71-2, 14 years). 1990 RECORD: 11-0-1. STRENGTHS: Junior Shawn Jones is a Don McPherson-type scrambler and a Heisman candidate. Three first-round prospects play defense. WEAKNESSES: The backfield had to be rebuilt when tailback William Bell, the top rusher last year as a sophomore, and fullback James Reese were suspended for stealing books. In a scrimmage, soph tailback Jeff Wright was hurt. OUTLOOK: Ross could successfully launch United Press International's defending national champion against Penn State on Wednesday. The other tough games will be at Clemson (Sept. 28) and Georgia (Nov. 30). 12. TENNESSEE COACH: Johnny Majors (159-99-10, 23 years). 1990 RECORD: 9-2-2. STRENGTHS: All the defensive starters are seniors. Dale Carter is a threat as a safety and returner. WEAKNESSES: Nine offensive players were drafted by National Football League teams last spring, including three in the first round. The backfield has four converted defensive players. OUTLOOK: The National Collegiate Athletic Association investigation into alleged recruiting and summer-camp violations could be a costly distraction. The big games are Auburn (Sept. 28), at Florida (Oct. 12) and at Notre Dame (Nov. 9). 13. COLORADO COACH: Bill McCartney (57-46-2, 9 years). 1990 RECORD: 11-1-1. STRENGTHS: The defense will dominate as superb recruiting classes hasten the replacement of 13 starters on the offense, which lost tailback Eric Bienemy, and on the defense. WEAKNESSES: Quarterback Darian Hagan is expected to start after a knee injury, but he will be vulnerable as a punt returner, which he wants to be as a pro. OUTLOOK: The schedule for The Associated Press defending national champion is easier. The Buffaloes could be 5-0 before the tough games at Oklahoma (Oct. 19) and Nebraska (Nov. 2). 14. AUBURN COACH: Pat Dye (143-51-4, 17 years). 1990 RECORD: 8-3-1. STRENGTHS: As a freshman last year, Stan White threw for 2,242 yards and 14 touchdowns, and now the Tigers will emphasize passing. WEAKNESSES: The Tigers lost 11 starters. The offensive line lacks a dominant starter. OUTLOOK: Games at Texas (Sept. 21) and at Tennessee (Sept. 28) will determine whether Auburn is a contender. The last two big games are at home: Florida (Nov. 2) and Alabama (Nov. 30). 15. NEBRASKA COACH: Tom Osborne (177-41-2, 18 years). 1990 RECORD: 9-3. STRENGTHS: Nebraska is upgrading its passing to make the I-back offense less predictable, but Mickey Joseph is only a 43 percent passer and walk-on Tom Haase could start. WEAKNESSES: Six defensive players went to the N.F.L. Tailback Leotis Flowers, 15th in the nation in rushing last year, quit the team. OUTLOOK: The first big test is Washington (Sept. 21). The next ones are at Colorado (Nov. 2) and Oklahoma (Nov. 29). 16. TEXAS A&M COACH: R. C. Slocum (17-7-1, 2 years). 1990 RECORD: 9-3-1. STRENGTHS: Senior option quarterback Bucky Richardson averaged 6.9 yards a carry. Senior Kevin Smith needs 11 interceptions for an N.C.A.A. career record. The secondary could be the best in the Southwest Conference. WEAKNESSES: Tailback Darren Lewis is gone. The offensive line is inexperienced with only one starter back. OUTLOOK: A favorable schedule brings home the biggest challenges: Houston (Oct. 19) and Texas (Nov. 26). 17. SOUTHERN CAL COACH: Larry Smith (101-67-5, 15 years). 1990 RECORD: 8-4-1. STRENGTHS: Junior Mazio Royster, the Pacific-10's top returning rusher with 1,168 yards last season, could be one of the top tailbacks in the nation. WEAKNESSES: The secondary needs to be rebuilt. The quarterbacks will alternate, creating risks, with scrambling Reggie Perry and Curtis Conway, who is also a flanker and receiver. OUTLOOK: Todd Marinovich's departure to the Raiders was a plus in removing a distraction, but a minus in representing the loss of a quarterback who could have won the Heisman. The challenges are Penn State (Sept. 14), at Notre Dame (Oct. 26) and Washington (Nov. 9). 18. HOUSTON COACH: John Jenkins (10-1-0, 1 year). 1990 RECORD: 10-1. STRENGTHS: With the run-and-shoot offense led by David Klingler, the Cougars set or tied 33 N.C.A.A. records last season. Klingler could win the Heisman with a repeat performance. WEAKNESSES: Can the defense do better than last year's, which allowed 690 passing yards in one game and 27.5 points a game? OUTLOOK: The tough games are at Miami (Sept. 12), at Texas A&M (Oct. 26) and Texas (Nov. 9). Texas A&M coach R. C. Slocum accused Jenkins of running up scores. 19. TEXAS COACH: David McWilliams (33-24-0, 5 years). 1990 RECORD: 10-2. STRENGTHS: Eight starters return on defense. Butch Hadnot is the third Longhorn in 14 years to gain 1,000 yards. WEAKNESSES: Steve Clements, the backup to quarterback Peter Gardere, left for B.Y.U. Three gifted wide receivers went to the N.F.L. OUTLOOK: Will the Longhorns be scarred by Miami's taunting humilation last Jan. 1? The challenges are Oklahoma (Oct. 12), at Houston (Nov. 9) and at Texas A&M (Nov. 28). 20. BRIGHAM YOUNG COACH: LaVell Edwards (175-59-1, 19 years). 1990 RECORD: 10-3. STRENGTHS: In two seasons, Ty Detmer has set 24 N.C.A.A. passing records. He won the Heisman with 5,188 passing yards and 41 touchdowns. But he ended 1990 with two separated shoulders. WEAKNESSES: The line that allowed Hawaii (59-28) and Texas A&M (65-14) to manhandle Detmer had to be rebuilt. Can it keep him healthy in the first three games, all on the road? OUTLOOK: After Florida State on Thursday, Detmer has showdowns with Tommy Maddox at U.C.L.A. (Sept. 7) and Tony Sacca at Penn State (Sept. 21), who beat Detmer in 1989. B.Y.U. could be 0-3 and Detmer could be a Heisman also-ran.",1991-08-25T05:00:00+0000

The judge who issued the original sentence, which was thrown out in February, said that Mr. Bakker lacked remorse. Last week, he showed considerable contrition.

It's second-skin dressing, in a variety of stretch bodysuits, unitards, tights and leotards that reduce fashion to the bare bones of simplicity. The women shown here exude self-confidence as they stroll Fifth or Park Avenue. All-black designs are a perfect foil for gold jewelry, a decorative belt or, for the more modest, a matching stretch hip-wrapper from Chanel, securely held with four of those expensive signature gold buttons, at far right. Some of the one-piece cat suits with flower prints are worn without other embellishment. Still others are topped with a transparent flowered flyaway shirt.

Carved Out of Darkness","The Polish writer Bruno Schulz, perhaps best known for his story collection ""Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass,"" began drawing as a child, a pursuit he continued throughout his relatively short life (a Jew, he was shot to death by a Nazi officer in 1942 at the age of 50). Essentially realistic, Schulz's art derives from both Viennese Expressionism and the old masters; his nightmarish figures carved out of darkness evoke comparisons to Munch and Goya. Jerzy Ficowski, a poet and the editor of ""The Letters and Drawings of Bruno Schulz,"" has arranged a complete collection of the writer's artwork in THE DRAWINGS OF BRUNO SCHULZ (Northwestern University, Cloth, $59.95; Paper, $24.95). In a series of engravings called ""The Book of Idolatry,"" women are depicted as towering over men and debasing them. Another series, ""At the Table,"" portrays Schulz's idea of the table as a symbol of human contact. Other sections include ""Book Covers"" and ""Illustrations,"" mostly for his own work. Schulz ""had an eye for detecting threats to human integrity in escapist and sadomasochistic tendencies,"" writes the art historian Ewa Kuryluk in an accompanying essay. Mr. Ficowski is to be commended for his attempt to fill in the ""blank spots and question marks"" of Schulz's life, a process the editor likens to ""a reading of ashes.""",1991-08-25T05:00:00+0000

Writing about it in The Wall Street Journal, the American reporter Amy Gamerman said: ""Expo watchers are laughing up their sleeves at the cheapo hybrid pavilion, dubbing it 'Twin Peaks.' It will look especially mingy on the enormous U.S. site.""",1991-08-25T05:00:00+0000

Afterward, a yearly visit for booster shots and a checkup is usually sufficient, unless the pet is chronically ill or very old. A checkup should include a dental exam, a stool sample for parasites and, for dogs, a blood test for heartworms. SHOTS AND PILLS Cats should have a single shot that protects against feline panleukopenia, rhinotracheitis and calicivirus, and a rabies vaccination. Some also need shots against feline leukemia virus or pneumonitis. Dogs should have a shot that protects against distemper, hepatitis and parainfluenza, and parvovirus and rabies vaccinations. Most dogs should take heart-worm prevention pills during the mosquito season. Some need shots against coronavirus, bordetella, leptospirosis or Lyme disease.
