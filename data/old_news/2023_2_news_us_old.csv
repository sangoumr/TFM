Usually they included an elephant or perhaps a tiger or a woman in a shimmering sari.

Yet there alongside her we find the funk powerhouse Chaka Khan, who first recorded the song in 1978; the songs co-composer Valerie Simpson; Houstons mother and mentor, Cissy Houston; a dance team of young Black girls; and the trio TLC. Houston recorded Im Every Woman for the soundtrack of The Bodyguard (1992), which she co-executive produced, and which secured her megastardom such that the wonderment of her talent and her career impacted everyone, as her sister-in-law and estate executor, Pat Houston, puts it.

Ill use minence Monoi Age Corrective Exfoliating Cleanser, followed by Dior Capture Totale Le Srum and Dior Prestige La Crme. I try to slather myself in those, and then another big slather of Kiehls Avocado Eye Cream and Carmex Classic Lip Balm. I dont wash my hair every day but, when I do, I use Alba Botanica So Smooth Gardenia Conditioner. (I dont use shampoo.) I always scrunch Kiehls Creme With Silk Groom into wet hair and then wind it up with these discontinued Scunci Clips to set  Ive resorted to buying them on eBay. I started pinning my hair up to control the curl, and now its become my signature. It is pretty healthy because its tucked away all the time but, when it starts to feel gangly, Ill snip it myself. I almost never wear makeup because my day starts so early. If I do, Ill do a cat eye with Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner, Diorshow Mascara and, sometimes, Rouge Dior 999 lipstick. Other lipsticks I rotate in are Stila Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick and Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey. Ill use Weleda Gentle Cleansing Milk to wash it off at night and, sometimes, I use this Borghese Purifying Mud Mask  Ive had a jar of that forever. I dont get massages enough, but I need to. I threw out my back recently, and a massage at Element spa in Brooklyn helped me get back on my feet. A lot of my team has favorite hand creams that are around the studio, one being Aesop Reverence Aromatique Hand Balm, so Ill use those. One thing I use often is this hand wash that is used to remove sap and resin. The filth if we dont wear gloves is incredible, it just gets into your pores, and this really removes it. Working with flowers and sometimes rotting flowers, I like to be aware of smells, so I dont wear fragrance very often. What I do love to wear is Herms Eau dOrange Verte.

The 45-year-old Venezuelan, whos now based in Porto Alegre, Brazil, started making colorful patterned pasta in 2019 in homage to his favorite artist, Carlos Cruz-Diez, a Venezuelan known for his chromatic relief murals who died that year at the age of 95. Putting his Ph.D. in chemistry to good use, Rivillo experimented with natural dyes (such as spirulina and paprika) to find those that would maintain their hue even when dried or cooked and posted his work on Instagram. Now, Rivillo, who recently left his job as a nanotechnology researcher to pursue the project full time, sells his creations (from $40 for 2.1 ounces, plus shipping). And he isnt the only noodle maker playing with psychedelic designs. The Sydney, Australia-based artist Jennifer Tran, 39, makes candy-striped rigatoni and checkerboard tortellini, as well as floral-print pasta sheets that look more like textiles than food. And in California, Fiona Afshar, 57, takes visual inspiration from her local farmers market and from her Malibu garden, adorning paccheri with yellow and purple blooms and ravioli with tiny images of lemons and limes. Employing highly pigmented ingredients like beet powder, activated charcoal and harissa, she sells multivariety gift boxes (from $95) through her website. The only problem with these Technicolor carbs? Theyre almost too pretty to eat. Says Rivillo of his pasta: People take a long time to get the courage to cook it. @david_rivillo; @_papetal_; fionaspasta.com.  Ella Riley-Adams",2023-02-15T12:00:10+0000

When Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has barred the new Advanced Placement course in African American studies from the states public schools. When legislatures are passing so-called divisive concept laws that further marginalize already marginalized histories, mandating that educators cannot teach about systemic racism or hold discussions about race that might cause students to feel discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress. With my own work often at the center of the legislative bans, Ive thought a lot about how the word white in front of students is implied in these laws. What about the discomfort of Black children that results from what isnt taught, the distress Black children experience when searching for themselves in an American story from which their people are largely absent, a story in which they learn about the great white men who lived in the White House but not the enslaved Africans who built it?",2023-02-16T10:00:18+0000

Located in Columbus, Ind., the midcentury modern home features a single-story open layout ideal for communal gatherings, as well as details meant to enhance the individual dwellers day-to-day lives. I love the idea of this house being a space that is intensely personal, but is also a really beautiful home for entertaining, says Giardina. Similarly, the wardrobe she created is for both private and public moments. (An organic Supima cotton track pant and matching tunic work just as well for lounging at home as they do under the brands blazers for the office.) The cushions that adorn the houses famous conversation pit provided a palette of saturated reds, creams and pinks, while the garden, designed by Dan Kiley, offered a range of fern, olive and sage greens and lilac-tinted blues for Giardina to draw from. (Saarinen and Kiley also collaborated on the St. Louis Arch, in Giardinas hometown.) Another aim of the spring collection was to expand Another Tomorrows range of textures  Giardina added new materials like hemp linen and even cruelty-free silk. anothertomorrow.co",2023-02-23T14:00:07+0000

Irina Georgescu, a Romanian food writer based in the U.K., begins the book with this: How we bake in Eastern Europe, and especially in Romania, is largely unknown. (I second that.) Then she leads you to discover a panoply of tastes and techniques, including rectangular slab pies filled with fruit or cheese; folded yeast-raised plum pastries made with lard and butter; pear cake scented with sage; and pull-apart buns, like monkey bread. More familiar are Austrian and Hungarian items, including strudels, and some entries from the Jewish repertoire: Jewish cookies with plum butter, a.k.a. hamantaschen for Purim (starting on March 6), and perhaps the best noodle kugel youre likely to try, a recipe from Transylvania crackling with phyllo. The histories of the many nationalities that inhabit the region and that have contributed to the table are outlined in rich detail. Shortcomings?
