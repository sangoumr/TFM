us,Twisty Path to a Shutdown,"Since last spring, when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo announced an agreement to close the Shoreham nuclear power plant, hopes for an end to the stalemate have repeatedly risen, only to fall again. These are some of the important dates in this saga of reversals: May 26, 1988: Two months after the Long Island Lighting Company rebuffed a $7.45 billion takeover offer by the Long Island Power Authority, Mr. Cuomo and the utility announce an agreement in principle to close Shoreham and help Lilco regain financial health. Dec. 1: After months of debate, including a brief session in September, the Legislature fails to endorse the settlement, declaring it too expensive for Lilco customers. Lawmakers insist that they are being forced to ratify the agreement just so the Governor can share political responsibility. Mr. Cuomo declares the deal to be dead. Dec. 5: A Federal jury finds that Lilco lied to state regulators to obtain rate increases and awards Suffolk $22.9 million in damages. Dec. 9: Mr. Cuomo and Suffolk County officials announce they are trying to fashion a new settlement. Any new accord, they say, would build on Mr. Cuomo's settlement and use the racketeering verdict to bring Lilco back to the table. Dec. 21: The judge in the racketeering case, Jack B. Weinstein, raises the stakes by bringing in a mediator, Kenneth R. Feinberg. Mr. Feinberg, a Washington lawyer, was instrumental in settling the Agent Orange herbicide case for Judge Weinstein. Jan. 31, 1989: Mr. Cuomo, apparently in a reversal, says he no longer insists that the Legislature agree to a deal to close Shoreham, except for a reduction in Lilco's gross-receipts tax. Legislative leaders refuse to guarantee passage. Feb. 11: Judge Weinstein dismisses the racketeering case, ruling that Suffolk's contention that Lilco had lied to obtain rate increases should have never been tried under Federal law. Mr. Feinberg outlines a proposed settlement. Feb. 23: Negotiations between Suffolk and Lilco to settle the racketeering suit collapse. The talks had been seen as important because an accord would have brought great pressure on Mr. Cuomo to find a way to close the plant. Feb. 28: Mr. Cuomo and Lilco sign an agreement to close Shoreham permanently. No legislative approval is needed, but the accord is contingent on approval by the Lilco board.",1989-03-01T05:00:00+0000

us,How Tower Responds,"Following are excerpts from a question-and-answer session with John G. Tower held after he addressed the National Press Club: Q. Senator Mitchell of Maine this morning announced his opposition to your nomination. The majority leader's vote carries a great deal of weight. Can your nomination make it in light of it? A. I believe that the majority leader also said that individual senators should make up their own minds, or words to that effect. So, I don't believe that he's trying to put the hammer on anyone . . . Q. Senator Hollings this morning said you had made pledges to abstain from alcohol before and broken them. Can we believe the latest one? A. I don't know what Senator Hollings is referring to. I don't recall any such. But the fact is this is not a pledge, it is an oath that I have taken - have taken for, to, and before the American people. And I regard such oaths as sacred. And I can assure you I will abide by it. Q. You said Sunday you've never broken a pledge in your life. Does this include wedding vows? A. As a matter of fact, I have broken wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone in that connection. Q. As head of the Tower Commission investigating the Iran-Contra affair, you gave George Bush a clean bill of health. Some say your nomination is a payoff for that and that's why he is sticking with you in the face of strong opposition. Your comment? A. I think that when you consider the fact that the commission was made up of three people, Brent Scowcroft and Ed Muskie in addition to myself, that that would be sort of impugning the integrity of Brent Scowcroft and Ed Muskie. . . . We found nothing to implicate the Vice President. I might add that the joint Congressional committee found nothing to implicate the Vice President. I wonder what kind of payoff they're going to get. Q. . . . Do you think that the lack of affection of your former colleagues is playing an inordinate role in your current crisis? A. I have heard various commentators say that some of my old colleagues had some scores to settle with me and were prepared to settle those scores. I don't believe that's true. . . . I believe it might be true that I'm not universally popular with all of them, but I don't think that would be considered a motivation for their vote for or against me . . . Q. Do you believe, as some apparently do, that the opposition to you is mostly partisan? . . . A. I think it remains to be seen whether or not the opposition turns out to be totally partisan. . . . I think if it turns out that way, that it's a significant development in American politics. I think it raises the question: Is character assassination a legitimate and acceptable means of the exercise of political power? If that question is answered in the affirmative, we have ushered in a new and rather ugly phase in American politics. Q. Senator, what has angered you most about the way your nomination is being considered? A. . . . I suppose one thing that I think engenders some resentment is the fact that there was no clearly defined standard against which I should be judged. The standard seemed to be developed and seemed to evolve to fit the situation. Now, several senators have said that the Secretary of State must adhere to a higher standard than members of the United States Senate. I accept that. I accept that the Secretary of Defense must adhere to a higher standard than members of the United States Senate. But my question is, how much lower an acceptable standard is there for members of the Senate? Is it an acceptable standard for senators late in the evening who've had a few drinks in the hideaways and offices of the Capitol, a few steps away from the Senate chamber, to come onto the floor late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear deterrence? Is it an acceptable standard for senators to accept honoraria, PAC contributions, and paid vacations from special interests who have a vested interest in the legislative process? I think, in the course of formulating a standard for the Secretary of Defense or indeed for any other Cabinet officer, that it is time that the Congress articulated what its own standards are.",1989-03-02T05:00:00+0000

us,RESULTS PLUS,"TENNIS Agassi Withdraws to McEnroe: Andre Agassi withdrew during the second set of his quarterfinal match against John McEnroe last night, saying later that he aggravated a muscle pull on the upper portion of his left leg during their match in Dallas. Agassi won the first set, 6-4, after breaking McEnroe's serve in the match's opening game. But after falling behind by 3-0 in the second set, Agassi informed Umpire Gerry Armstrong he had had enough, gathered his equipment and walked off to the boos of the Reunion Arena crowd. Agassi was not limping noticeably during the match. He said that he incurred the injury during the United States Pro Indoors in Philadelphia last weekend and had considered defaulting before last night's match. ''I'd been icing it, hoping it would go away,'' said Agassi, who ranked fourth by the A.T.P. computer. ''Bill Norris warmed it up. But then slowly it started to get stiff and I couldn't change direction or move well.'' McEnroe went off to loud cheers. He first waved to the crowd, then threw up his hands in a gesture of confusion and frustration. 'It's very bizarre. It's unbelievable,'' said McEnroe, who does not count the 19-year-old Agassi among his closest friends on the tour. ''If we have anyone standing by the finals, it'll be a plus.'' McEnroe suggested that Agassi should have tried to continue in what was expected to be the most interesting of yesterday's two quarterfinals. Top-seeded Ivan Lendl met Jakob Hlasek in the late match last night.(AP) N.H.L. Kings 5, Sabres 4: Steve Kasper scored twice in the third period last night in Buffalo and Luc Robitaille had the game-winning goal as the Kings broke a four-game streak without a victory. Kasper and Robitaille beat the goalie, Jacques Cloutier, during a 67-second span late in the final period as the Kings rallied from a 4-2 deficit in the third period to win. Kasper's first of the night made it 4-3 early in the third period, his second tied, 4-4, at 15:16 and then Robitaille finished the rally at 16 minutes 23 seconds when he banked a shot from behind the net off Cloutier's legs. (AP) Flyers 4, Jets 4: Rick Tocchet scored his second goal of the game with 1:58 remaining in regulation time for the tie. Thomas Steen had the goal for Winnipeg at 5:35 of the third period.The Flyers swarmed the rookie goalie Bob Essensa and outshot the Jets, 18-7, in the third period.(AP) N.B.A. Celtics 104, Hawks 90: Kevin McHale and Robert Parish led a fourth-quarter charge last night that enabled the host Celtics to end the Hawks' four-game winning streak. In the final period, McHale had 14 of his 23 points, and Parish had 9 of his 23. Boston's lead, which reached 13 points late in the third quarter, fell to 80-78 on a fallaway jumper by Moses Malone with 7 minutes 46 seconds to play. McHale scored the next 4 points, but Atlanta's Reggie Theus got the next 4, making it 84-82. A free throw by Parish started a 7-0 run in which McHale followed with two foul shots, Parish dunked and Reggie Lewis hit a jumper, increasing the lead to 91-82 with 3:54 to go. Atlanta was led by Dominique Wilkins with 23 points. Boston hit 67 percent of its first-half shots, and Atlanta made 39 percent. (AP) Pistons 96, Jazz 85: Vinnie Johnson set a club record by scoring 19 consecutive Detroit points in the second quarter at Auburn Hills, Mich. Johnson, who finished with a season-high 34 points, was 8 for 10 from the field in the second period and hit 6 straight shots in one stretch. The 19 straight points broke the team record of 16 set by Isiah Thomas against the Knicks in the 1984 playoffs. Mark Aguirre added 16 points for Detroit, all in the first period, and Bill Laimbeer had 14 points and 13 rebounds. Karl Malone led Utah with 27 points. The Pistons improved their record to 24-2 when opponents score less than 100 points. (AP)",1989-03-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q. In periods of high humidity, our toilet sweats a lot on the outside - so much so that I have to put towels on the floor to catch the dripping water. Is there some way we can solve this problem? A. When you talk of the toilet sweating, I assume you are referring to the toilet tank behind the bowl. What happens in humid weather is that cold water entering the tank chills the outside of the tank so that when warm moist air in the room contacts the chilled surface, condensation forms - much in the way that a glass of ice water ''sweats'' on a summer day. The best way to prevent this is to install a mixing valve that will add a very small amount of hot water into the cold water line before it enters the tank (a plumber can install such piping). A less expensive method that often works is to line the inside of the tank with one-inch-thick pieces of plastic foam insulating board. This will keep the outside of the tank from getting so chilled and will thus reduce condensation problems. Incidentally, anything you can do to lower humidity inside the house will also help (for example, make sure there is an exhaust fan in the kitchen and bath). Q. We have lived 10 years in our brick-veneer house and now I find cracks in three different places in our foundation, with some of the cracks continuing up into the brick coursing on the walls above. I can find no evidence of cracks in the footings, nor does there seem to be any evidence of shifting or movement. Since these cracks just occurred for the first time, could the recent drought and consequent change in soil conditions be the cause of this problem, and can you suggest any way to correct this problem? A. Even though you can see no visible signs of movement in the footings, it is possible that extreme drying out of the soil or other ground conditions could have caused some settling. The main thing now is to see if the cracks continue to spread or grow larger. In most cases of this kind they will stabilize so that all you have to do is fill them with patching cement or hydraulic cement. If the cracks continue to get worse, it may be a good idea to call in an engineer to check the structure.",1989-03-02T05:00:00+0000

Sanders also requested that he continue to be unavailable to reporters until a later date, said Steve Buzzard, sports information director. ''My responsibility will continue to be in the best interests of the youngster and his family,'' Jones said. Sanders, a junior who rushed for 2,628 yards and scored 39 touchdowns last season, both National Collegiate Athletic Association records, said previously that he had decided on whether to apply for the N.F.L. draft. But he has not disclosed his decision. His father, William, visited with N.F.L. officials last month to discuss his son's options. But he told The Associated Press last night that he was surprised his son was not going through spring drills. ''I talked to Barry on Monday night and he said he was going out for spring football,'' Williams Sanders said from his home in Wichita, Kan. ''He said he was going to be out running with everyone else.'' Sanders could become the first third-year college player ever allowed to participate in the regular N.F.L. draft. Since Sanders has never been redshirted, he would not be eligible for the regular N.F.L. draft this spring unless he decided to challenge the legality of the draft in the courts or unless the league changes its longstanding policy of not drafting underclassmen. In January, the N.C.A.A. placed Oklahoma State on four years' probation, barring the Cowboys from bowl games for the next three years and live television for the next two years.(AP)",1989-03-02T05:00:00+0000

Among those who finished, Tom Byrum had the best score with a seven-under-par 65 on the Tournament Players Club at Eagle Trace in Coral Springs, Fla. The storm hit in midafternoon after all was calm on a course noted for windy conditions. ''It's a shock to play here with no wind,'' said Fred Couples, after he came in with a 66, scores later matched by Ted Schulz and Fulton Allem. Sandy Lyle, the Scot who won the Masters last year, was two shots behind Byrum at 67 and Curtis Strange, the 1988 United States Open champion, was at 68. The 72 golfers with incomplete rounds will return at 7:15 A.M. today to finish their first rounds before the second round can be played. Charles Leads Seniors: Bob Charles, the Seniors Tour Player of the Year for 1988, turned to his trusty putter yesterday to shoot a four-under-par 68 over the windswept Mountain Course and take a two-stroke lead over Miller Barber in the first round of the Vintage Invitational in Indian Wells, Calif.

The Flames, who have lost only four games at home, have 96 points compared to Montreal's 95. The teams engaged in scuffles in front of their benches in the game's final minutes.

us,FICTION,"FIFTY YEARS OF ETERNAL VIGILANCE: And Other Stories. By Carolyn Thorman. (Peachtree, $14.95.) The characters in Carolyn Thorman's first collection of stories are quirky Lithuanian- and Polish-Americans with varying attitudes about the benefits, and costs, of assimilation. They wouldn't understand the word, but they know everything about the idea. In ''Society for the Benefit of the Daughters of Vilnius,'' Valiute Kalaikas watches dumbfounded as the name of her organization is changed to the Southeastern Baltimore Women's Club. Valiute, however, gathers up her courage when, a few minutes later, she is appointed secretary. ''It just so happens I don't read or write English,'' she tells the shocked social climbers, ''so I'll be doing Daughter business in Lithuanian.'' Ms. Thorman's interest in the Old World's uneasy peace with the new is most gracefully expressed in the title story. Its heroine, an old woman named Aldonna, is upset at the thought of being buried under a synthetic urn and plastic lilies. So she contracts for candles, pine branches, flowers and ribbons on her grave. She wants them provided for eternity. ''I don't contract for eternity,'' replies Radas, the Polish landscaper who does maintenance work at the cemetery. So they compromise on 50 years. In person, Ms. Thorman's characters would probably be prickly, even unappealing. But she makes them intriguing and sympathetic. Unfortunately, the disjointedness of the immigrant theme often makes ''Fifty Years of Eternal Vigilance'' difficult for the reader; just when we're comfortable with one set of eccentricities, we're presented with a whole new one. My guess is that Ms. Thorman's characters would do better if they were given the elbowroom of a novel.",1989-03-05T05:00:00+0000

From 1942, when the Philippines fell to the Japanese, until Douglas MacArthur led the liberating invasion in 1944, America's principal colony lay under harsh, often brutal occupation. Ralph Graves, Time Inc.'s former editorial director, who grew up in Manila as the stepson of the United States High Commissioner and took part in the liberation of the islands as an Army Air Forces sergeant, uses the occupation as the framework for his first novel, ''Share of Honor.'' This fast-paced and wide-ranging story follows the fortunes of both Filipinos and Americans as they resist the enemy as spies, guerrillas and prisoners of war - or accept it. The Japanese are also brought in, as well as an American intelligence officer on MacArthur's staff, who acts as a chorus to Mr. Graves's well-researched portrayal of the imperious and imperial MacArthur. Mr. Graves also skillfully reminds the reader that the prewar Philippines were for many Americans a lovely, cheap tropical haven from the stresses and storms of Depression-era America. Mr. Graves's good guys may be a trifle too good and oversimplified, but this very readable novel contains graphic, detailed and dramatic descriptions of prison camps, battles, the urban and rural occupation conditions and, of course, that enduring scar on United States-Japanese relations, the Bataan Death March.",1989-03-05T05:00:00+0000
us,England's Rothschild Chateau,"MY first great architectural encounter beyond American shores took place on an autumnal weekend in the Loire Valley in France. Silhouetted against a gray sky was the majestic roof line of the 16th-century Chateau of Chambord, with its symmetrically massed turrets, towers and cupolas. It made a lasting impression on someone reared on the simplicity of American Colonial architecture. Not long ago, a similar image surfaced in England on another autumn day as I looked down an avenue of oaks near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire to the grand roof patterns of Waddesdon Manor. Here the exhuberant stacking of high-pitched roofs, cupolas, decorated chimneys and pedimented dormers read like a compendium of best ingredients from the French Renaissance chateaus of Francois I. Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, who built Waddesdon between 1874 and 1889, wrote in a memoir about his own formative experience in seeing the old chateaus of the Valois, and he had the good fortune to be able to act upon it. In a sense, the Rothschilds are Europe's most European family. Having intermarried and moved from city to city, the family has always subscribed to European culture as a whole rather than that of one country. These descendants of a Frankfurt banker, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, who established the original family banking firm in five European cities, have been statesmen in their own countries. As collectors, and scientists, their family homes became repositories of culture and knowledge, so much so that in the world of interior design, one may even refer to le style Rothschild, a timeless period, but with roots in 17th- and 18th-century France.",1989-03-05T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"WE'RE NOT HERE. By Tim Mahoney. (Delta, Paper, $7.95.) Many Vietnam novels stagger out of the souls of American soldiers who can describe their suffering but have trouble getting beyond it. Tim Mahoney's second novel is a compelling exception - a Vietnam story so good that it rivals what is still probably the best Vietnam novel, Graham Greene's 1955 work, ''The Quiet American.'' Greene's American was an idealistic meddler working for democracy just as France was quitting Vietnam and the United States was beginning to take its place. In both novels the same fortified watchtowers are manned, waiting for the Communists to attack, but in Mr. Mahoney's book the sentinels are mostly stuffed dummies. American soldiers, under the Henry Kissinger-Le Duc Tho peace agreement of 1973, are not supposed to be in combat areas, but a few, like Sgt. Bill Lemmen, are still fighting the war. Lemmen loves Hoa, a Vietnamese woman, and loves the simplicity of life in the soft, wet, green Mekong Delta. He realizes that in Vietnam he is somebody, whereas ''in America,'' he tells Hoa, ''we would be poor. We'd end up in a trailer court.'' Gradually Lemmen admits that his side is losing the war, that he must try to leave and take Hoa with him. Graham Greene wrote that there would be Vietnamese carrying buckets on the ends of poles after there was no longer a London or a New York. In the same spirit, Tim Mahoney's Sergeant Lemmen thinks about ''the kind of kid who grew up to be VC. A kid who would walk barefoot through smelly, leech-ridden, snake-infested water, grab a snake, throw it in a bucket, eat it for breakfast. Whatever gave Americans the idea they could defeat such people?''",1989-03-05T05:00:00+0000

Two other world marks also fell: Elly van Hulst of the Netherlands slashed nearly six seconds off the women's 3,000-meter best and Kerry Saxby of Australia lowered the mark in the women's 3,000-meter walk.

Jerry Tarkanian is, according to his fellow coach Abe Lemons, ''the most misunderstood coach in the country.'' The reputation that has dogged Mr. Tarkanian from his early days at Long Beach State through his present stint at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, is that he is not above using shady recruiting practices. In fact, the National Collegiate Athletic Association has investigated Mr. Tarkanian twice and in 1977 ruled that he be suspended from coaching for two years - a decision that Mr. Tarkanian appealed all the way to the United States Supreme Court. With the able help of Terry Pluto, co-author of ''48 Minutes: A Night in the Life of the NBA,'' Mr. Tarkanian gives his side of the story. The result is ''Tark,'' an informative, entertaining, eminently readable book that offers a look at the real Tark: his successes as a high school and junior college coach; his years at Nevada, where he has produced teams consistently in the Top 10, resulting in a program that ''usually clears about $3 million annually''; his close, familial relationship with his players; his personal struggles against the N.C.A.A. (including tips on how to reform it); and a primer of how to successfully recruit and coach a team of players of sometimes limited ability. Mr. Tarkanian is not afraid to tackle controversial subjects, like illegal recruiting, telling of the time Sidney Green, now with the New York Knicks, was offered $15,000 in cash to attend a particular school. As Mr. Tarkanian notes: ''The biggest problem in college basketball is that too many kids are being bought. The coaches know it, the kids know it, and I'm sure the NCAA knows it.''",1989-03-05T05:00:00+0000

In 1987, as the scandal unfolded, he attempted suicide because of a sense, he said later, ''of having failed the country.'' Last week, he became the first figure in the affair to be punished. He received two years' probation, instead of a possible four-year prison term, and a $20,000 fine. He pleaded guilty last year to misleading Congress with assurances that Oliver L. North was obeying its ban on aiding the Nicaraguan rebels. Mr. McFarlane, who is expected to be a prosecution witness at Mr. North's trial, said, ''I'm proud to have served my country.''",1989-03-05T05:00:00+0000

Late-19th-century notions of Central Africa, revealed to us in Joseph Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness'' and in journals and popular accounts of such explorers as Stanley and Livingstone, have attached themselves to the Western imagination with all the tenacity of myth. Central Africa, one of the last question marks on the colonial map, was the continent's mysterious core, symbol of the bleakest chambers of the Western heart. Inspired by such notions, the British poet and travel writer Paul Hyland and his wife, Noelle, embarked on a journey up the Congo River (known in Zaire as the Zaire River), retracing the steps of 19th-century adventurers. Traveling by riverboat and dugout, the Hylands struggled up the Congo to Lubunga, site of Conrad's ''Inner Station,'' now an ''undistinguished tin-roofed town.'' They then journeyed to the Lake Mweru region, where Mr. Hyland's great-uncle, a missionary, had dived into the local culture with an anthropologist's zeal. Throughout his account, Mr. Hyland summons the spirits of those who preceded him, often in choppy, disjointed evocations that confuse rather than enlighten. He is at his best when he describes the Zaire of today: remote villages rich in tradition, teeming, discordant cities and the Zairian people themselves, who seem alternately enthralled and amused by the visitors. Occasionally Mr. Hyland glimpses the absurdities of ''the old white myths'' he has set out to examine. In light of Zaire's current problems, including poverty and AIDS, the heart of darkness becomes a much less romantic concept.",1989-03-05T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"KILL THE POOR. By Joel Rose. (Atlantic Monthly, Paper, $8.95.) Sharp, savage and extremely well written, this provocative first novel examines a politically troublesome and ethically troubling issue - the gentrification of impoverished urban neighborhoods - with the stylistic flair and easy nihilism characteristic of New York's downtown scene. Joel Rose, editor of the literary magazine Between C & D, brings an interesting historical perspective to his tale of conflict between middle-class whites and the poor (but not necessarily virtuous) people they're squeezing out of the Lower East Side. His protagonist, Jo-Jo Peltz, knows the area intimately: his grandmother came there from Hungary in 1903; his mother was born on the very block where he and his pregnant wife buy an apartment; the synagogue he attended as a boy is across the street, though now a looted ruin. Jo-Jo's family can't believe he would go back to the slum they spent most of their lives working to get out of. And indeed little seems to have changed, except that now young professional couples compete with drug dealers and muggers for control of the streets - and vie with welfare families for possession of the area's crumbling buildings. Mr. Rose vividly captures the volatile atmosphere of this bizarre and intriguing neighborhood, where gossipy street-corner camaraderie and random violence coexist and, on occasion, overlap. There's not a lot of depth to his characters, nor to his social philosophy; he seems to accept dog-eat-dog as the natural rule of human existence and never considers the possibility that blame might be assigned and solutions found for the tensions of the Lower East Side. Still, he uses his biting humor to compel the reader to consider the nasty particulars of a contemporary problem, and that's no small achievement.",1989-03-05T05:00:00+0000

This posthumous collection of unpublished fiction includes the title piece, a novel written in 1936, about an exotic Hungarian whose arrival shakes up a quiet Shropshire village. ''What we value most in Barbara Pym - her humor, her love of detail, the pleasure she took in what she called the 'trivial round and common task' - is all here, in writing that is at once restrained and fluent,'' Patricia T. O'Conner said in The Book Review last year. SEASON TICKET: A Baseball Companion, by Roger Angell. (Ballantine, $4.95.) In his pieces for The New Yorker, Roger Angell writes so well about baseball thatJU his prose is savored even by people who don't like the game. ''The next best thing to being at a baseball game is reading Roger Angell, our laureate of the pastime,'' Joel Conarroe said here last year. In this collection, ''he creates a sense of baseball's 'elegant and arduous complexity, its layered substrata of nuance and lesson and accumulated experience.' '' The publisher has also reissued Mr. Angell's earlier book, LATE INNINGS: A Baseball Companion ($4.50). When it was published in 1982 our reviewer, Mark Harris, said the author ''never draws upon the stock of jargon that has been gathering for a century. He sees things by looking at them, not by remembering what has been so often said about them.'' SHAME, by Salman Rushdie. (Vintage International, $9.95.) In a country that is ''not quite Pakistan,'' the author of ''The Satanic Verses'' tells ''a sort of modern fairy tale'' about a warrior who seems a lot like Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and his rival, a fictional stand-in for Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In 1983 our reviewer, Robert Towers, said Mr. Rushdie's style is ''a source of delight, a bright stream of words that lifted me happily past the most threatening snags and whirlpools of this impossible tale.'' DANGEROUS DOSSIERS: Exposing the Secret War Against America's Greatest Authors, by Herbert Mitgang. (Ballantine, $4.95.) Using the Freedom of Information Act, Herbert Mitgang, a Times cultural correspondent, obtained secret files the Federal Bureau of Investigation kept on Sinclair Lewis, William Faulkner, Thomas Mann, Dorothy Parker and some 30 other literary suspects. ''If Susan Sontag meets with writers in Eastern Europe, or if William Styron shows up with Daniel Ortega Saavedra in Costa Rica, can the F.B.I. really be far behind?'' Elinor Langer wrote here last year. ''The great importance of [ this book ] is that it makes it impossible not to ask such questions.'' LAST LETTERS FROM HAV, by Jan Morris. (Vintage, $6.95.) A veteran travel writer visits a strange Arabian city that exists only within the geography of her mind. ''Jan Morris is to other travel writers what John le Carre is to other spy novelists,'' Thomas M. Disch said here in 1985. ''She has the knack of her fellow masters . . . of being able to barge in on strangeness and feel immediately at home.'' THE ZURICH AXIOMS, by Max Gunther. (Signet/New American Library, $4.50.) Diversification is not always good, writes the author of this book on secrets of the Swiss bankers, and one should never take long-range plans too seriously. In 1985 our reviewer, Jan M. Rosen, called this investment guide ''an amusing and useful counterpoint to the conventional wisdom.'' THE IDEAL, GENUINE MAN, by Don Robertson. (Signet/New American Library, $4.50.) A good ole boy from Houston whose wife is dying of cancer becomes a mass murderer. In 1987 our reviewer, Christopher Shaw, said this novel is ''rendered largely in the drawl of low-life Texans, with occasional flashes of vivid language. The prose has whiffs of Charles Bukowski and Stephen King.'' HOUSE OF DREAMS: The Collapse of an American Dynasty, by Marie Brenner. (Avon, $4.95.) If the members of the Bingham family had been able to communicate with one another as well as their newspaper, The Louisville Courier-Journal, communicated with the people of Kentucky, then perhaps one of the great journalistic dynasties would not have fallen apart. ''Without question there are all the dramatic ingredients here to make one reflect on fatal flaws and the working out of divine retribution,'' The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said when this story of the family's decline was published last year. JAPANESE TALES. Edited and translated by Royall Tyler. (Pantheon, $12.95.) When these stories from medieval Japan were published in 1987, our reviewer, Marian Ury, said, ''Few readers who start the book will be able to resist going through to the end. The Grimms' tales have become English classics, and it is quite possible that Mr. Tyler has created something similar.'' SHORES OF REFUGE: A Hundred Years of Jewish Emigration, by Ronald Sanders. (Schocken, $14.95.) From the pogroms of czarist Russia and the Holocaust to the era of the Soviet refuseniks, Ronald Sanders tells the story of Jews who successfully fled persecution. This is a ''fascinating and in many ways comforting book,'' Martin Gilbert said here in 1988. THE BEAN TREES, by Barbara Kingsolver. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95) When the rear tires of her Volkswagen blow out, Taylor Greer finds her calling. She decides to settle in Tucson, Ariz., working at Jesus Is Lord Used Tires, which doubles as a sanctuary for Central American refugees.

When her trendy television-director husband leaves her for another woman, Joan Battram finds, to her surprise, that she likes living alone. Her problem is that no one will leave her alone. Though this London schoolteacher strives mightily to discourage them, her neighbors and acquaintances insistently invite her out, her parents fret and phone, a muscular young colleague pursues her slavishly, her ex-husband changes his mind and, finally, the famous, meltingly handsome West End actor Finbar Flynn stumbles into her life. This series of unwanted attentions - and Joan's efforts to fend them off - form the fragile comedic skeleton of the British writer Mavis Cheek's first novel. Unfortunately, the skeleton soon collapses under a heap of quickly accumulating annoyances. The dark sarcasm of Joan's first-person narration becomes tedious, and the single metaphor she uses to depict her emotional state (ice) recurs so often that it wears very thin indeed. Most important, the world she sketches is quite unrecognizable. What bitter, recently divorced woman ever found herself plagued by too much attention? What kind of teacher never meets a student or spends an evening grading exams?

Nicholas Jr., the president of Time Inc. since July 1986. He would succeed the chairman of Time, J. Richard Munro, in 18 months and the chairman of Warner, Steven J. Ross, in five years. [ D9. ] The path to the merger pact was fraught with problems during the two years it took to bring it about, but in the end it was a recognition that the opportunity to form the company was passing quickly that led the management of both companies to act. [ D9. ] The deal lays the foundation for another publishing empire, one that will be better able to compete with the foreign giants. [ D8. ] Will this marriage be a success? Wall Street wonders.

Susan Butcher, a three-time champion, arrived at 5:22 A.M., and DeeDee Jonrow of Bethel arrived four minutes later. None of the four leaders has taken the 24-hour layover required during the race. Three other mushers were on the trail from Finger Lake to Rainy Pass, which is 226 miles into the race and at 3,400 feet elevation. Martin Buser, who was out front when the first mushers pulled into Finger Lake late Sunday, declared his 24-hour layover and had not moved by early yesterday. Under the rules of the race, mushers are required to make a 24-hour stop at one of the race's 24 checkpoints; at the others, they take whatever length of rest they believe they and the dogs need. However, mushers are allowed to use the strategy of declaring a 24-hour layover, then leaving after a couple of hours, in hopes of getting a jump on their competitors.

us,Inside Story: Doc Dusts Rickey,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. rrThe rivalry between the Mets and the Yankees resumed yesterday with a Dwight Gooden fastball aimed in the direction of Rickey Henderson's chin. It was all a misunderstanding, but a rather emphatic way of resuming the New York series, dormant since 1985. Like superpowers unable to decide on the shape of a peace-conference table, the Mets and Yankees did not meet at all for three seasons. The Mets' resurgence just might have had something to do with Yankee recalcitrance, but George Steinbrenner had not wanted his pitchers batting in exhibitions if they would not be hitting during the regular season. When the Texas Rangers moved away from Pompano Beach, a huge gap was left in the Yankee schedule, just as the Mets announced plans to move to the east coast of Florida. Lou Piniella, in his brief term as nominal Yankee general manager, worked with Joe McIlvaine of the Mets to get the teams together again. The teams resumed with a 6-4 Yankee victory yesterday, and they will meet five more times, including twice in New York just before the regular season. Spring training had been quiet up to now, with Henderson claiming that drinking had damaged the Yankees last year, and Keith Hernandez and Darryl Strawberry working on their slugging percentage during the taking of the team picture. The first game between the Mets and Yankees in four years was not important enough for Strawberry or Gary Carter to be in the lineup. Steinbrenner was said to be in Pittsburgh. And the Yankees did not bring Don Mattingly and three other weary or gimpy regulars on the hour-and-half haul to the Mets' camp in the middle of nowhere. The developers who paid for the new Prima Vista interchange on Interstate 95 couldn't come up with the last $4.98 for a sign indicating it goes to the Mets' complex. One of the Yankee buses overshot the exit yesterday morning, and the driver tried to turn on the grassy embankment and got stuck. The other bus rescued the players, and deposited them at the ball park. The sellout crowd was settling into its seats as Gooden started his windup and Henderson stepped away from the plate and called time out. ""Knowing Rickey, you don't know what he's thinking at any time,"" Gooden said later. Somehow, Gooden gained the impression that Henderson was trying to unsettle him, as if this were the first game of the Subway World Series. Henderson got back into the box and had to scramble away from a fastball. ""I tried to go low and away,"" Gooden said with a straight face. Henderson limbered up and got back into the box and spanked a fastball for a base hit, went to second on a balk, stole third and later scored. His manager, Dallas Green, liked Henderson's response to the brushback. By then, Gooden had learned that Henderson had stepped out because his bat had made contact with the glove of Mackey Sasser, the catcher. But it was more fun this way. Actually, Gooden said, the inside pitch to Henderson was just another drill in his spring-training regimen, like running and hitting and fielding practice. In his first few years in the major leagues, Gooden said, he had pitched inside just often enough to throw 95-m.p.h. fear into the batters. ""You've got to pitch inside,"" Gooden said. ""Not knock the guy down. If you let the batters know, they'll take advantage of it."" Gooden had been looking forward to pitching to Mattingly, but the slugger had played nine innings twice already, and was spared the trek. So Gooden had to pitch to Mattingly in his mind. ""Fastball, right down the middle, first pitch,"" Gooden said. ""Hopefully, he'll be taking it. Fastball away. Then, it depends whether he hits the first pitch."" Gooden's out pitch? ""I might have gone for a curve."" Sometime in the next five games, we may have Gooden against Mattingly, like the old days when Newcombe pitched to DiMaggio, Reynolds pitched to Campanella, as the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Yankees played a home-and-home series. One year, the Yankee manager, Casey Stengel, led young Mickey Mantle out to the right-field wall in Ebbets Field and tried to tell him how to play the bizarre caroms. Mantle looked at Stengel as if he were nuts, not believing the Old Man had once patrolled that very turf as a National League outfielder. ""He must think I was born old,"" Stengel quipped. Met fans don't seem to despise Yankee fans, and vice versa, the way Dodger fans and Yankee fans used to feel about each other. But with five games in the next month, that could change. - SPORTS OF THE TIMES",1989-03-07T05:00:00+0000

Lucky Stores Inc. had a negative impact on earnings per common share of $1.97 for the year and 71 cents in the fourth quarter. This reduction is due to the interest expense relating to the financing of the purchase and the amortization of the write-up of Lucky's assets. The negative impact is less than anticipated as the Lucky operating results continue to exceed budgeted levels. The company also said the LIFO inventory adjustment reduced earnings per common share by $1.03 in the current year, versus 48 cents in the prior year. For the quarter, the LIFO impact was 27 cents per common share, compared with 9 cents last year. The increased expense is due to the greater inflation in the cost of product in the current year than was experienced in 1987.",1989-03-07T05:00:00+0000

Here were his coach, Al Arbour, and his predecessor and advisor, Billy Smith, congratulating him on yet another job well done, yet for a losing cause. It was hard for Hackett to decide whether he should be downhearted about the stream of losses or encouraged by the appreciation of his teammates and superiors. In the end, he was both. ''I've got to keep forgetting about my record,'' said Hackett. ''I've got to look at my other stats and not worry. There's only been one game, in Buffalo, where I felt I didn't play well. If I can just keep playing like this, the win will come, and it'll be that much sweeter when it comes. But I hope it comes soon.'' Tonight, Hackett, despite stopping 26 of Boston's 28 shots, found himself on the losing end of a goaltenders' duel with the seasoned Rejean Lemelin, who stopped all but one of the 24 shots sent his way by the Islanders.

Austin, 26 years old, battled seventh-seeded Nicole Provis of Australia gamely through the first two sets before losing, 7-5, 5-7, 6-1. Austin, the United States Open champion in 1979 and 1981, gave up competitive tennis after being bothered by recurring neck and back problems. Her last previous singles competition had been in February 1984. Austin took the opening four games of the match. But, suddenly having trouble getting her second serve in, she dropped the next four games and wound up losing the set, during which she had five double faults. Austin came back to take the second set, using well-placed groundstrokes. Provis took command in the third set after losing the first game. Chris Evert, the tournament's top-seeded player, begins play today, meeting Hana Mandlikova of Australia. Mandlikova defeated Akiko Kijimuta of Japan, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, yesterday.(AP) HORSE RACING Mi Selecto Romps: Mi Selecto splashed through the slop to score an 11-length victory at Gulfstream Park yesterday in the $300,000 Pan American Handicap, a race that lost much of its significance when it was switched from the grass to the dirt and Sunshine Forever was scratched. The Pan American is usually the year's first Grade I grass race, and the early entries drew Sunshine Forever, last year's champion grass horse. In mid-afternoon, though, Gulfstream management pulled the race off the grass, even though this was the closing day of the meeting. Safety considerations were cited.The change in surface made a Grade I winner of Mi Selecto, who had not won a race on the dirt since a maiden victory a year ago. Pay the Butler finished second in his first career start on the dirt. Fabulous Indian, who was overtaken by the winner after six furlongs, held third, and Green Barb, the 9-to-5 favorite, was fourth. Mi Selecto paid $11.40 for $2 to win and ran the mile and a quarter in a very respectable 2:01 3/5 under Jose Santos. Mi Selecto, owned by William Agusti Jr., has won 6 of 21 career starts and has earned $485,855.",1989-03-08T05:00:00+0000

(The performance survives, appropriately enough, on a pirated recording.) Otherwise, ''Il Pirata'' does not have much recent history hereabouts, partly because it is the work of a composer who, at age 25, was only beginning to find the flowing but dramatic style that would ripen into ''I Puritani,'' ''La Sonnambula'' and ''Norma.'' Then, too, there is the libretto, with its band of happy-go-lucky pirates, confused lovers and ensemble numbers that might have been shanghaied by Gilbert and Sullivan. The final pages are given over to an extended mad scene by the heroine, Imogene. She loves a pirate but, to provide the plot with the necessary complexity, marries his deadly foe and bears a child. There is nothing left for her but to fire off a cabaletta and fall into a fatal swoon.",1989-03-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q. My bathroom is next to the bathroom in the next apartment, and we hear noise through the wall. A soundproofing company said I would be wasting money on soundproofing and suggested putting a radio in the bathroom. Have you any other suggestion? A.I'm afraid the soundproofing contractor was right. Short of major alterations (tearing out the wall and rebuilding it for greater acoustical insulation) there is little you can do. Q.We burn wood in our brick fireplace and use a little coal as a fire base. The wood, mostly from gum trees, is seasoned outdoors for a year. This year in damp weather we have gotten an unpleasant aroma from the fireplace, like half-burned wood. I always let the fire burn out completely and then push the ashes and fire remains into the ash pit under the fireplace. Even though I clean the pit, the smell comes out on rainy days. What can I do? A.Have a professional chimney cleaner thoroughly clean the chimney, firebox and ash pit. An accumulation of soot and ashes inside the fireplace or the chimney is the most likely cause of the odor. A good cleaning should take care of this. Burning coal with the wood, incidentally, may contribute to the problem. Q.The ceiling in my dry basement room has blistered badly, in my opinion because a poor-quality primer was used when the house was built 30 years ago. I am chipping away the blistered paint and will use dry wall compound to fill in the chipped areas for a smooth surface. Before painting I want to apply a primer to hold the resurfaced areas in place and keep the unblemished paint from blistering. Paint stores have recommended water-based primers, oil-based primers and varnish. Which is best? A.You expect a lot from a coat of primer. No paint primer will hold resurfaced areas in place, nor keep paint from blistering. Primers are for sealing a surface and insuring a good bond for succeeding coats of paint; they are not adhesives or binders that will hold plaster or patching compounds in place. Oil-base or water-base primers will work, but I don't advise varnish or shellac. Incidentally, dry wall compound is fine for patching dry wall, but not if the ceiling is plaster; if it is, use spackling compound or patching plaster for smoothing in the low spots. Q.The contractor refinishing our parquet hardwood floors with two coats of polyurethane said there was no need for a coat of wax to prevent scratches. Previously our floors lasted for over 20 years, but they had a coat of wax over the polyurethane. What do you advise? A.Many manufacturers of polyurethane finishes say waxing is not needed, because a good polyurethane forms such a hard finish. But I think waxing helps prevent scratches, especially where people walk in from outdoors with dirt on their shoes. A light coat of wax, thoroughly buffed, helps prevent scratches and makes the floor easier to clean.",1989-03-09T05:00:00+0000

us,NEWS SUMMARY,"International 3-6, 28 Skepticism over a European market to be unified in 1992 is growing among Western European politicians and citizens as hard decisions loom on pivotal issues, like a European central bank. Page 1 Jonas Savimbi has ordered torture and murder of high-ranking Angolan dissenters for many years within the ranks of his U.S.-backed guerrilla movement, former supporters asserted. 1 Apartheid was flatly condemned in South Africa by the main Afrikaner church for the first time. It occurred during a landmark five-day meeting with the church's mixed-race and black counterparts. 1 Sudan agrees to food relief but skepticism persists 4 An airport in a strategic Afghan city was reopened by the Government just days after guerrilla forces said they had taken it, the Kabul Government said. 3 The Soviet military is restructuring itself in the most sweeping manner since the 1920's, a Soviet arms control expert told Congress, providing some details about the effort. 6 Pope names three Bishops for Lithuania 6 News analysis: The move in Poland to restore the upper house of Parliament has raised questions about the Communist Party: Is it unwittingly preparing its political demise, or just cleverly co-opting Solidarity? 5 A West Berlin power-sharing pact was reached by Social Democrats and environmentalist Greens, clearing the way for the first ''Red-Green'' coalition to rule the city. 28 Israel's Foreign Minister visits the United States with a schedule of high-level meetings and a mandate to find out if Washington expects a serious peace initiative next month. 3 Egypt denies Swiss machinery was aquired for poison gas 6 An Air Ontario jetliner crashed just after taking off in heavy snow from Dryden, Ontario. At least 45 survivors were reported among the 69 passengers. 5 The U.N. body for human rights ended its annual session without making provision to review human rights abuses by Cuba again next year, as Bush officials had wanted. 5 National 7-10, 32 President Bush's Defense nominee is Representative Cheney of Wyoming, Mr. Bush said, moving swiftly after the Senate's defeat of John Tower. 1 News analysis: The new nominee is, unlike John Tower, universally liked and admired. The quick announcement represents the President's bid to regain momentum. 10 Man in the news: Dick Cheney is a respected politician with a straight-arrow image, a reputation for toughness and a heavy resume. But he has had little direct involvement in military affairs. 10 Eastern Airlines has permission from a Federal bankruptcy judge to continue paying non-striking employees, the airline said. That permits it to continue limited flights. 1 Will that ticket for Eastern fly? Thousands of ticket-holders are asking what to do, and officials are finally providing some answers. But hopes for immediate refunds are dim. 8 Shuttle flight bargain draws thousands 8 Eastern and union struggling for loyalty of pilots 8 February unemployment dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point to 5.1 percent, the Government said, and joblessness of more than six months was at a nine-year low. 1 New York jobless rate passes 5% 32 Interest rates rise on reports of job growth 38 Robert McFarlane in the North trial testified that President Reagan told him not to tell Congress about the $1 million that a third country contributed monthly for the Nicaraguan rebels. 1 A captian's wife escaped a bombing of her car that the F.B.I. suspects was a terrorist attack. She is married to the captain whose ship mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner last July. 1 Programs to give addicts needles to stem AIDS spread have touched off conflict between Health Secretary Sullivan (for Federal aid) and the new anti-drug chief, William Bennett (against it). 7 A Bush ethics panel recommended several ways to tighten ethics rules, including a uniform limit on outside income and the use of special prosecutors to investigations. 7 A program to detain immigrants from Central America was defended by the immigration commissioner, who dimissed Congressional concerns that the plan was unfair. 9 Countdown for a shuttle launching began. The 28th shuttle mission's liftoff is scheduled for 8:07 A.M. Monday. It is the third flight since the Challenger disaster. 7 Warrant officer gets 40 years for spying 9 Regional 29-32 Governor Cuomo told an ethics panel that he deplored asking special interests for money but felt forced to do so to win re-election. New York State's Attorney General, Robert Abrams, testified likewise. 29 A Broadway subway train crashed into a parked train on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, jolting hundreds of passengers and transit workers, derailing both trains and halting subway service for much of the day. 29 Alison Gertz has never injected drugs or had a blood transfusion. She is a 23-year-old professional who describes herself as ''not at all promiscuous.'' She has AIDS and is going public about it. 29 News analysis: A Federal ruling that unlimited punitive damages for the same wrongdoing are unconstitutional is important, lawyers said. The issue is already before the United States Supreme Court. 30 ''Tilted Arc'' is to be removed today from a lower Manhattan plaza. The vast sculptural expanse that provoked heated artistic controversy will be stored in Brooklyn. 29 City Council President Andrew Stein of New York City abandoned his mayoral ambitions this year but is laying the groundwork for a mayoral candidacy in four years. 31 Ward takes steps to improve services for Latinos 31",1989-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Guidepost; Preparing for Planting,"Cabin fever ends. Gardening begins again. What to do first? The yard needs a thorough spring cleanup: remove dead grass, leaves and twigs, dropped tree fruits and other debris of winter. Cut back overgrown hedges, shrubs and small trees. All this gives you a head start before planting, which won't start until next month after the soil dries out. Don't throw all those trimmings out; if they're small enough to decompose easily, add them to the compost pile. Here are the tools you'll need for the basic cleanup. Rakes: Steel tines are strongest; bamboo is gentler on the turf, but won't clean dead grass out as well. Rubber tines are new and have a wide swath but are clumsier to handle. Bent handles are easier on your back and less awkward to maneuver. Pruners: Folding saws with steel blades and wooden handles cut branches and small trees and store easily. Long-handled loppers reach easily into shrubs to grip and cut branches. Short-handled snippers trim twigs and some shrubbery. Gloves: Heavy-duty material with latex coating offers the most protection. For lighter work, goatskin is more comfortable and washable. Cloth is not practical for yard work.",1989-03-11T05:00:00+0000

How does a young boy attain manhood - or learn what it is all about - in a society where there are no formal rituals to facilitate his passage? Ray Raphael, the author of ''The Teacher's Voice,'' explores this question in ''The Men From the Boys: Rites of Passage in Male America.'' He conducted in-depth interviews with 100 American men from various walks of life who had set out to test their virility by joining the Army, competing in sports, enduring the indignities of fraternity hazing, sleeping with as many women as possible, climbing mountains or working arduous hours in the emergency rooms of hospitals. We hear both the triumph and the anguish of these men as Mr. Raphael re-creates their personal tales and concludes remorsefully that these rituals simply do not do the job. Unlike primitive rites of passage that made it possible for every boy to achieve a heightened sense of self-worth, our rituals are too idiosyncratic, too restrictive and too competitive to really work. Too often they are designed as tests rather than rites of passage, and only a few men can pass them. As a result, Mr. Raphael sums up, we have turned into a nation of ''makeshift'' males: ''Some young males find ways to manage the transition successfully, while others try but do not succeed. . . . Our pluralistic culture gives only a loose and pluralistic response to the problems faced by developing young men.'' This is not an entirely new argument, but Mr. Raphael's book is provocative and well researched, his anecdotes are often compelling and we cannot dispute his recommendation that we have to redefine manhood as a state of maturity, rather than a display of power, and negotiate new rituals that will be accessible to all young boys.",1989-03-12T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"A MATTER OF DAYS. By Albert Lebowitz. (Louisiana State University, $15.95.) Albert Lebowitz, an attorney who lives in St. Louis, has applied much ingenuity to fashioning an intertwined series of nine stories, each with the word ''day'' in the title, in which a small pool of characters make repeat appearances. Phyllis Stein and her dog Uriah deal with a squirrel in the attic in the first story, ''Mother's Day.'' We meet Phyllis's husband, David, a lawyer in his 30's, ill at ease in body and mind, in the second story, ''Day Labour.'' Unattractive, painfully conscious of his Jewishness in an oppressively gentile world, David struggles with tormenting questions of love and identity in subsequent narratives. In ''His Days Are as Grass,'' Phyllis's cold and loveless brother, Solon Pepper, obsessively palpates a small tumor in his neck and, emotionally paralyzed by the prospect of cancer, refuses his sister the sympathy she seeks from him. He watches his fiancee's passion turn to madness in the epistolary exchange that makes up ''Dear Days.'' And both dog and God have their days in the final two stories of the collection. ''A Matter of Days'' is the sort of work that gives experimental fiction a bad name. The characters exist only as an excuse for labored word play, purposely stilted dialogue and clotted ruminations - not to mention obtrusive alliteration, unattractive neologisms and gimmicky shifts of tense. Like solipsistic Solon Pepper, the book makes an art out of repelling friendly attention.",1989-03-12T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"CANNIBALS IN SICILY and THE BATHING HUTS. By Monique Lange. Translated by Barbara Beaumont. (Marion Boyars, $18.95.) Two dramatic situations - a death and an illness - account for the basic plots in these two short novels by the French writer Monique Lange, both smoothly translated by Barbara Beaumont. The first, ''Cannibals in Sicily,'' was published in France in 1967 and, as the author herself explains in the preface, describes how ''a couple in crisis is re-made when confronted with the pain of a mother's death.'' The story is episodic in nature, jumping suddenly, like a film, from brief scene to brief scene. But the effect in this case is jarring. Instead of experiencing the emotional duel between wife and husband firsthand, one finds oneself on the outside looking in, frustrated by the author's emphasis on technique. ''The Bathing Huts,'' published 15 years later, is much more successful. It too is short and episodic, but the transitions between scenes are much more felicitously and logically wrought. The novel concerns a woman in her 50's, suffering from an unnamed illness, who is sent by her doctor to Brittany in order to recuperate. There, solitary and reticent, she ruminates with a captivating honesty about her past loves, her two husbands, her daughter and her granddaughter. She also meets a much older man, who befriends her and with whom she gradually and somewhat reluctantly forms a relationship. The story is very nostalgic but without a maudlin note. The narrator sits on the beach, recalling all the mistakes she's made in her life, all the false loves and bad choices - along with the many intensely lived moments - and ultimately one gets the impression she wouldn't change a thing. That in itself is a breath of fresh air.",1989-03-12T05:00:00+0000

They had objected to what they described as the racist overtones in his management of President Bush's election campaign.

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/VIDEO: NEW VIDEO RELEASES,"Clean and Sober 1988. Warner. 2 hours, 4 minutes. $89.95. Rated R. With his alcohol and cocaine problems out of hand, Daryl (Michael Keaton) checks into a rehabilitation center and gradually turns his denial and self-centeredness into understanding and compassion. The film, directed by Glenn Gordon Caron, follows his progress from ''one tiny increment to another, the best way to capture such a giant step forward.'' (Janet Maslin) Imagine: John Lennon 1988. Warner. 1:46. $89.95. Closed captioned (CC). Laser disk. $24.98. R. This film ''has things no Beatles biographer has yet captured: the pure euphoria of the music, the sad spectacle of the group's dissolution and Lennon's defiant, somehow poignant effort to strike out on his own.'' It's not ''terribly penetrating about Lennon's inner makeup, but it doesn't have to be. His resilient talent and his endlessly changeable nature come through.'' (Maslin) The Year My Voice Broke 1987. International Video Entertainment. 1:40. $89.95. PG-13. In this unpretentious Australian coming-of-age film, Danny, 15, falls for Freya, 16, whose involvement with an older fellow leads to pregnancy. A magnanimous lad, Danny helps Freya through her trials, maturing markedly himself and proving ''there is some life in coming-of-age stories after all.'' (Caryn James) The White Sheik 1952. Connoisseur. 1:26. $59.95. Not rated. It seems a fitting scenario for the directing debut of young Federico Fellini: a bride strays from her husband on their Roman honeymoon and falls for a plump ex-barber modeling as a desert prince for photographs in a lurid adventure magazine. When it opened, the film was hailed as surprisingly broad and ingenious. Variety Lights 1951. Connoisseur. 1:33. $59.95. Black and white. Not rated. Mr. Fellini co-directs his wife, Giulietta Masina, in this comedy-drama about a traveling vaudeville troupe. The director focuses on the ordinary faces that light up and enhance the dialogue (he also wrote the screenplay), depicting little people in a tough world. The Eclipse 1962. Connoisseur. 2:03. $79.95. Black and white. Not rated. Michelangelo Antonioni's orchestration of graphic detail records the moody, drawn-out surrender of a capricious young woman (Monica Vitti) to the bland advances of a stockbroker (Alain Delon) who seems more interested in bulls and bears. Antonioni is so selective and sensitive with his use of camera that what might be tedious is fascinating. Big Business 1988. Touchstone. 1:37. $89.95. CC. LD. $34.95. PG. Identical twins, Sadie (Bette Midler) and Rose (Lily Tomlin) get accidentally mismatched with another set of twins at birth, setting off a breezy farce played to the hilt by two ''splendidly comic actors.'' Ms. Midler is a ''fiendish delight'' and Ms. Tomlin is ''reserved but no less funny'' in a film that remains ''good fun even when the invention wears thin.'' (Vincent Canby) Spike of Bensonhurst 1988. Virgin. 1:41. $89.95. R. LD. $39.95. Dispensing with myriad multiethnic complications and romantic pitfalls, Spike Fumo (Sasha Mitchell) skips through a gauntlet of Mafia operatives and petty crooks in Paul Morrissey's comedy, set in Brooklyn. The film, spiced by jaunty Italian bubble-gum pop songs, ''doesn't have the sharpest satirical edge, but it does have personality.'' (Maslin)",1989-03-12T05:00:00+0000

Will Weaver has followed his acclaimed first novel, ''Red Earth, White Earth,'' with a collection of 12 stories unified by a compelling sense of place. These stories rise, with an equal balance of pathos and humor, from the farmland of the American Middle West. While not all are completely successful - the endings of ''Dispersal'' and ''Gabriel's Feathers'' could each, in different ways, use more restraint - most are excellent and all are effective. Mr. Weaver shows his range and inventiveness in ''You Are What You Drive,'' which traces the history of several lives that are linked by their successive ownership of the same Buick LeSabre, and in ''The Bread-Truck Driver,'' a rock-and-roll lark with a haunting finish. Particularly affecting are the title story and ''Heart of the Fields,'' warm narratives about abiding loves that show up more clearly for the wide-open spaces of their settings. Mr. Weaver finds sources of affirmation in unlikely places. The title story, for example, tells of Olaf Torvik's resolve to bury his wife on their farm, defying a state ordinance against home burial by interring her in a field and covering the grave in earth richly fertilized so the wheat will forever grow ''greener, taller, and more golden than all the rest.''

us,Question of the Week; Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?,"For equal, or nearly equal value, yes. Despite being a feared hitter, he does have significant failings. His defense is suspect, if not downright poor. He catches the ball off-balance and is then in a poor position to throw. His powerful arm is more than negated by the number of extra steps he takes to release the ball. Offensively, any raw speed he has is offset by ignorance of baserunning technique. His looping swing, which he uses to generate towering home run power from his arms, makes him susceptible to droughts. Lastly, and most importantly, Strawberry is not a heads-up ballplayer, nor is he a team man. Give me a Kirby Puckett, Andy Van Slyke, Kevin McReynolds, or Dave Winfield anytime.

us,Rome's Venerable Ghetto,"FROM A BELVEDERE ON THE JANICULUM -that most verdant of Rome's hills, bounded on one side by St. Peter's and on the other by Rome and the world - the eye picks out, from among the gorgeous clutter of Roman roofs, two declarative edifices: the Pantheon, its gray rotunda looking from this perspective like a hovering spacecraft; and the great dome of the Temple, Rome's eclectic neo-Byzantine synagogue. The Pantheon (a temple of all the ancient gods, later elevated, consecrated and dedicated to Mary) was built by Hadrian 18 centuries ago; the synagogue was consecrated in 1904. These two buildings, so antithetical in history and design, coexist happily; they seem to have been there, amid umbrella pine and cypress, forever. And this is as it should be; for the genius of Rome is that, sophisticated, tolerant, the motherly repository of human folly and human learning, she accommodates all things: nothing human is alien to this bountiful city.",1989-03-12T05:00:00+0000

Schneider won the race, the season final, with a two-run clocking of 1 minute 25.67 seconds. That was more than 1 second faster than Monika Maierhofer of Austria, who was timed in 1:26.71. Schneider, 24 years old, swept all seven slalom races this season, with her winning streak beginning at Altenmarkt, Austria, on Dec. 16. She won six giant slaloms, losing only last week at Furano in northern Japan, when she finished third. She also took one combined crown for a total of 14 victories.

McColgan, the 1988 Olympic silver medalist at 10,000 meters, was timed in 30 minutes 38 seconds for the 6.2-mile loop course, erasing the world mark of 30:59 she set in this race last year.

Joe Falcon of Arkansas won the men's mile for the second straight year, clocking 3:58.06.

us,NONFICTION,"THE PLEASURES OF JAPANESE LITERATURE. By Donald Keene. (Columbia University, $19.) These graceful essays by Donald Keene, the Shincho Professor of Japanese Literature at Columbia University and a master literary translator, answer many questions Western readers may have about pre-modern Japanese poetry, fiction, theater and esthetics. How comforting to know, for example, that even the Japanese may find the subtleties of traditional Noh theater tedious. Mr. Keene explains the religious origins of Noh and says that even a Noh play ''that ends happily is performed today with the deliberation and gravity reserved in most parts of the world for funeral rites'' and that ''many in the audience doze, somehow able to awaken at key moments.'' In a chapter on esthetics, Mr. Keene considers the distinctively Japanese appreciation for suggestion, irregularity, simplicity and perishability; he quotes the 14th-century Buddhist priest Kenko, who wrote, ''The most precious thing in life is its uncertainty.'' Anyone familiar with the hurly-burly of modern-day Japan may wonder where ''suggestion'' and ''simplicity'' exist; Mr. Keene acknowledges this, but maintains that ''the past survives in aesthetic preferences that often find surprising outlets for expression - a box of sushi, a display of lacquered zori, branches of artificial maple leaves along a commercial street.'' Although Mr. Keene intended these essays, originally presented as lectures, for a general audience, I question how well they would be understood by someone who knows nothing of Japanese poetry, fiction or theater. Instead, ''The Pleasures of Japanese Literature'' is an excellent summing up for those familiar with Japanese literature and will entice those with some knowledge to read more.",1989-03-12T05:00:00+0000

Born in South Africa, the black singer Miriam Makeba has drawn on her Swazi culture to endure a career in political exile. Her autobiography is the story of ''life lived as communal dialectic, a matter of African creative will set against bureaucratized repression,'' Robert Farris Thompson said here last year. THE TENANTS OF TIME, by Thomas Flanagan. (Warner, $5.95.) After the failed Fenian uprising of 1867, one young Irishman becomes a terrorist, one becomes aJU politician and one becomes a schoolmaster, who tries to make sense of it all. Last year our reviewer, George Garrett, said this novel ''is about the making of history, the confusion and complexity of motives and events (and Irish history is breathlessly complicated), the selectivity and fallibility of memory, the constantly changing nature of all past time. . . . Mr. Flanagan evokes a country, its countryside, its weathers and seasons, its earth and old stones, and the long, dark shadows of its history. And the writing is so clear and clean; every sentence seems to shine.'' A HISTORY OF WESTERN ASTROLOGY, by S. J. Tester. (Ballantine, $9.95.) Compared with astronomy, astrology is pure pseudoscience, but back in ancient times it was one of the more rational world views around. In 1988 our reviewer, Anthony Grafton, said S. J. Tester's ''lucid, well-informed and concise book tells a coherent story that until now had to be pieced together from primary and secondary sources of diverse age, aim and value. In doing this, his book fills a large and rather surprising gap.'' FOR THE RECORD: From Wall Street to Washington, by Donald T. Regan. (St. Martin's, $4.95.) This is the book in which Nancy Reagan was unmasked as a devotee of the zodiacal arts. Donald T. Regan, her husband's star-crossed chief of staff, tells ''a riveting tale of political downfall and human agony,'' Morton Kondracke said in The Book Review last year. Avon has reprinted the book that cost Larry Speakes, Ronald Reagan's former press secretary, his job on Wall Street. In SPEAKING OUT: The Reagan Presidency From Inside the White House ($4.95), written with Robert Pack, Mr. Speakes confessed that he had fabricated quotations for the President. BLACK BOX, by Amos Oz. Translated by Nicholas de Lange with the author. (Vintage International, $8.95.) His excessively adulterous ex-wife marries a religious zealot, but an Israeli expert on fanaticism shows that he might be the most fanatical one of them all. Last year our reviewer, Mary Gordon, said that Amos Oz ''creates a prose whose tensions almost force the reader to a richer understanding of his complex world.'' SACRED BOND: The Legacy of Baby M, by Phyllis Chesler. (Vintage, $7.95.) The controversy over surrogacy, or ''industrialized pregnancy,'' is in many ways a class struggle, the author writes. Those with enough money hire less advantaged breeders to bear the children they cannot have. The book is ''a powerful critique of the way many of us were inclined to think as we read'' about the Baby M case, Robert Coles said in these pages last year. ''The smugly self-serving sociological and psychological generalizations that pass for truth today simply fail to do justice to the range and complexity of human feeling.'' THE HEARTS AND LIVES OF MEN, by Fay Weldon. (Dell, $4.95.) In a surrealistic parody of a Dickens serial, a young waif named Little Nell escapes a nasty custody battle and embarks upon cliffhanging adventures - including a stint in an oppressive English boarding school. ''This novel delivers what its ambitious title promises: a dazzling, kaleidoscopic view of the love-hate core of men's (and women's) lives,'' James Wilcox said in The Book Review last year. It is ''a beguiling romance that makes the aches and pains of today's somewhat muddled relationships seem well worth the effort.'' THE NATURE OF TIME, edited by Raymond Flood and Michael Lockwood. (Basil Blackwell, $11.95.) If the expanding universe runs out of steam and begins to collapse into a Big Crunch, will time start running backward? This collection of essays ''is filled with such provocative ruminations,'' Michael Talbot said here in 1987. ''In an age that often seems to thrive on the vapid, [ it ] provides some heady and challenging relief.'' MAN WITH A GUN, by Robert Daley. (Pocket Books, $4.95.) In his crusade against crime, an idealistic New York City police administrator runs afoul of department politics and finds the Mayor, his fellow officers and the black community ganging up against him. ''What matters most in this sort of novel is the ride,'' Richard Lourie said here last year. ''Mr. Daley's roller coaster gives us our money's worth - a long, slow climb to the top, a heart-in-your-throat plunge and then a last quick corner at the end.'' NO TELEPHONE TO HEAVEN, by Michelle Cliff. (Vintage International, $8.95.) A family of Jamaicans finds itself torn between island culture and the allure of the United States. In 1987 The Times's Michiko Kakutani said Michelle Cliff's artful use of Jamaican slang and her ''lyrical evocation of the land . . . possess the incantatory power of poetry.'' BLACK HEARTS AND SLOW DANCING, by Earl W. Emerson. (Penguin, $3.95.) On his first day as acting sheriff of a small town in Washington, a fire chief named Mac Fontana is called on to solve the murder of a fellow fireman. ''This is an expert, readable job with a likable hero,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year.",1989-03-12T05:00:00+0000

''Family Erupts in Violence: One Dead, One Injured, as Tot Looks On,'' the headline might read. And inside the story, one might read: ''The killer only wanted to be 'a gentle person, a good boy.' '' In her first novel, ''The Book of Ruth,'' Jane Hamilton explores the life behind this lurid story through the eyes of Ruth, the young mother who is the only person left to put it together. The underachiever of an underachieving family, Ruth lives in a tiny Illinois town where nothing is fancy except ''the iron gate around the church and the pigeons with their purple breasts.'' Ruth's low self-esteem is confirmed by her frustrated mother, May, who practices her own oppressive style of parenthood. Barely into her adult years, Ruth finds herself trapped between her mean-spirited mother and her sweet, dopey husband, who's as thirsty for praise as he is for alcohol. The domestic violence that finally rips Ruth's world apart is horrifying, but in many ways it's as ordinary as her life. ''Killing is the easiest thing in the world,'' Ruth thinks, and it's as true as anything she's been taught. In recounting her sad story, Ms. Hamilton gives Ruth a humble dignity and allows her hope - but it's not a heavenly hope. It's a common one, caked with mud and held with gritted teeth. And it's probably the only kind that's worth reading about.",1989-03-12T05:00:00+0000

Verlaine, Rimbaud, Toulouse-Lautrec, van Gogh, Daumier, Baudelaire - all took ''inspiration'' from absinthe, the cloudy green aperitif made from wormwood, a strong-smelling perennial herb. Barnaby Conrad 3d, in ABSINTHE: History in a Bottle (Chronicle Books, Cloth, $29.95; Paper, $18.95), views, through the bottle, as it were, 19th-century France, its mores, art, culture and politics. Absinthe divided France, with doctors, poets and politicians either extolling its virtues or decrying its baleful influence. So important did the drink become to daily life that even the hour of drinking it had a name: l'heure verte. When Manet and Degas painted their versions of cafe denizens during l'heure verte, in ''The Absinthe Drinker'' and ''L'Absinthe,'' respectively, their works became scandals in the art world as well as representations politicians could point to for evidence of society's descent into hell. Absinthe rose to prominence during a time of great political and social upheaval, when, to political reactionaries like Leon Daudet, Mr. Conrad records, wine stood for tradition and absinthe, revolution. Mr. Conrad, a writer on art and travel, has compiled an absinthe catalogue raisonne, with information, witty quotations and illustrations that track the Green Fairy on its march from cafes into the streets and galleries and into the French National Assembly. As in our Congress today, rhetoric then was dramatic, hysterical. Absinthe was going to destroy France. One can't help comparing today's antidrug hysteria with that 100 years ago - and wish that Mr. Conrad had analyzed more thoroughly how outrage against the likes of absinthe may mask other social and political problems.",1989-03-12T05:00:00+0000

Charles S. Locke, the company's chairman and chief executive, recently discussed the move and the prospects for the company's non-aerospace business. Q: Why did you want to spin off the commercial operations from the aerospace group? A: The stock of our company hasn't done much in a long time. We were considered undervalued, even though the performance of our commercial business has been outstanding. By separating those businesses, so they can be clearly visible, we should be able to enhance shareholder value. Q. Is the restructuring also an attempt to separate Thiokol's assets from its liabilities? A: The liabilities that grew out of the shuttle disaster were all covered by insurance. Those cases have long since been settled. Only a few nuisance suits are left. Legal liabilities are not a problem. Q. In the broader sense, the damage to the company's image as a result of the shuttle disaster has lingered. Is the restructuring an attempt to separate that problem from your other businesses? A: It seems to me that our public relations problems from the crash are pretty much behind us. I don't read a lot of articles rehashing the shuttle thing. The more important consideration was that Morton has been followed by specialty chemical analysts for many years. Those analysts were never interested in following our aerospace business in the first place, and after our difficulties, their level of dissatisfaction rose considerably. That's one of the things that depressed our stock for quite a while. By separating these two stocks, we will make it possible for those who are interested in a pure specialty chemical play to invest. Q: Had you come under pressure to split the company in two? A: The analysts who follow us made it clear that they have wanted us to do something for a long time. They always visualized that we'd end up selling the aerospace division. Q: Why didn't you? A: Unless we could get a very good price for aerospace, we were better off spinning it off. Q: The aerospace profit fell from $96.3 million in 1986, the year of the shuttle crash, to $80.7 million in the fiscal year ended last June 30. Why did the group decline like that, and how do you plan to revive it? A: One of the things we decided shortly after the shuttle disaster was that we were not going to decide what to do with the aerospace unit until we had redesigned the entire solid rocket motor. We agreed to do all that at no profit even though we had a specific contract with the Government spelling out what we were supposed to do and how much we were supposed to be paid for it. That explains why the profit of the aerospace unit was lower than it was supposed to be and explains why it will rebound to levels above 1986 in the not-too-distant future. The aerospace business that will carry on under the name of the Thiokol Corporation will be a very economically viable business. Q: In retrospect, do you regret having purchased the Thiokol Corporation in 1982? A: We picked up some premier specialty chemical properties when we bought Thiokol. We became the only producer of polysulfide chemicals in the world. These are used for caulking buildings and for insulating glass. We also acquired Dynachem, which is one of the largest electronic chemical manufacturers as well as sodium borohydride and the technology for air bags. The answer is a resounding no. I'd do it exactly the same way again. Q. What are the prospects for your specialty chemical area? A: Very good. That business has grown 12 to 15 percent over a number of years, and we think it will continue to grow at that rate. We expect more strategic acquisitions in that area. Q: What effect would a recession have on that business? A: Historically, the last two recessions have had a minimal impact on our specialty chemical business. It is not correct to say that our specialty chemical business has been recession-proof because our growth has slowed, but it has certainly been recession-resistant. Q: Many of the major commodity chemical makers plan to add new production capacity.",1989-03-14T05:00:00+0000

But right on their heels were Chris Bowman of the United States and Kurt Browning of Canada. In the pairs, Yekaterina Gordeyeva and Sergei Grinkov, the Olympic champions, performed flawlessly to outskate their rivals in the original program. Their variety and co-ordination were unmatched by any of their rivals and made them solid favorites for their third world title in four years.

us,Q&A,"Worn Shingles Q. Our house is about 38 years old and we are about to have the complete roof reshingled. The roof has already had a layer of shingles placed on top of the original ones, but the shingles on the south side have curled and warped and are quite brittle. Should the worn shingles be removed before new ones are applied, and can a third layer be placed on top of the two that are there? A. The warped and brittle shingles should definitely be removed before new shingles are applied. As far as the rest of the roof is concerned, it is never a good idea to apply a third layer of shingles. I would advise removing the shingles on the entire roof before installing a new layer. Touching Up Oak Floors Q. My oak floors were coated with polyurethane over seven years ago. They are still in relatively good condition, but over the years the finish has been blemished by scratches and paint spatters. I would like to restore these floors to their original unblemished condition. What should I do? A. As a rule, polyurethane finishes cannot be easily touched up -you have to sand them down and refinish. But mild scratches can sometimes be covered with a thin coat of paste wax buffed well with lamb's wool. The paint smears can usually be removed by rubbing with a waterless hand cleaner, and sometimes by rubbing with cold cream till the paint liquifies. Wipe off the smear with a clean cloth as soon as it softens. If these measures don't help, then the floor will have to be sanded and refinished. Painting Radiators Q. Our painted radiators look awful and we are ready to strip and repaint them. How is a radiator stripped and what kind of paint is best? Or can the radiators be left in their natural state, without paint? A. Strip the radiators when they are cold, using a semi-paste chemical paint remover. It's messy, so if possible remove the radiators and work in the garage. Otherwise, make sure you cover the floor under and near the radiators. If you use a water-wash remover you can scrub off the goo with a stiff brush dipped in water or a detergent solution. Radiators do not have to be painted, but they might rust if you don't. If you do, use a flat paint, not gloss or aluminum paint. Questions about home repair should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

Bowman and Kurt Browning of Canada burst into contention for the men's gold medal in a three-way battle with the Soviet veteran Aleksandr Fadeyev. Gordeyeva and Grinkov, the Olympic champions, won the world pairs title in 1986 and 1987, but were upset last year and then passed up the European championships in Birmingham, England, last January because of an injury to Gordeyeva.They sailed through the free-dance routine yesterday with a performance of style and grace to take the first gold medal of the championships. All their marks for technical merit and artistic impression were 5.8's or 5.9's. Bowman, trying to keep America's grip on the men's title after the success last year of Brian Boitano, now retired, moved up from fourth to third over all after the original program.(AP) N.B.A. Cavaliers 115, Bulls 91: Mark Price scored 21 points and Cleveland took advantage of Michael Jordan's early foul trouble by going on a decisive 17-2 first-quarter run last night as the Cavaliers won for only the third time in its last eight games.

us,Dining Out Guide: With Children,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication; restaurants mentioned in Diner's Journal do not have stars. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. Contrapunto * (Nov. 23, 1984), 200 East 60th Street (751-8616) - Even before they can properly pronounce it, many junior diners want pasta. Contrapunto serves 20 varieties in an upbeat glass-walled dining room above street level. Among those recommended are angel-hair pasta with dried tomatoes, shallots, leeks, basil and littleneck clams, and fusilli tossed with greens, Parmesan, tomato, garlic and hot peppers. There is light homemade sorbet to finish the feast. Entrees are $11.75 to $18.75. Open noon to 11:45 P.M. Friday to Sunday. El Rio Grande * (April 20, 1984), 160 East 38th Street (867-0922) - Children may like the Tex-Mex decor and menu at this two-room restaurant divided by an imaginary Rio Grande (actually a passage through the kitchen). The menu includes several dishes in which the ingredients are rolled into soft tortillas; both chicken and steak fajitas are available. An appetizer that might suffice for a child's entree, queso fundido, is a Mexican cheese casserole (with chicken, seafood or vegetables) that is tucked into the tortilla by the waiter at tableside. Entrees are $8.95 to $19.50. Open noon to midnight Friday through Sunday; brunch noon to 3:30 P.M. Saturday and Sunday. Exterminator Chili Diner's Journal (Aug. 2, 1985), 305 Church Street (219-3070) - A campy 1950's diner theme amuses children and grown-ups alike, particularly when the menu features good chili and hamburgers. Patrons sitting in worn vintage booths are surrounded by pop icons, Howdy Doody and Elvis Presley prominent among them. A hefty, fresh bowl of chili (mild, medium, hot or vegetarian) is topped with sour cream, onions and cheddar. Homemade desserts include fruit cobblers and chocolate mud pie. Lunch is $3.95 to $6.95, dinner $6.95 to $11.95. Open 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. and 6 P.M. to midnight Friday, 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. and 6 P.M. to midnight Saturday and 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. and 6 P.M. to 11 P.M. Sunday. Pig Heaven ** (Dec. 28, 1984), 1540 Second Avenue, at 80th Street (744-4333) - The capricious barnyard motif, from the giant wooden piglet holding the menu card at the door to the frieze of illuminated pigs all around the dining room, belies some serious Chinese cooking in the kitchen. You can start with the excellent dumplings - steamed, fried, or boiled. A winning entree is crisp-skinned Cantonese-style suckling pig. Other dishes include three-glass chicken and skillfully prepared fish. Desserts are American-style; young diners should be impressed with the Peking snowball, whipped cream surrounding a rich chocolate core, accompanied by silly-face cookies. Appetizers are $3.75 to $8.50, entrees $7.95 to $19.95. Open noon to 1 A.M. Friday and Saturday, noon to midnight Sunday. Pizzico Diner's Journal (Sept. 20, 1985), 1445 First Avenue, at 75th Street (737-3328) - Eleven kinds of individual pizza are the main attraction at this cafe. Toppings run from the complex to the simply traditional. One combines grilled peppers, two cheeses, red onions, sun-dried tomatoes, basil and roasted garlic; another has spicy eggplant, lamb sausage, basil and marinara sauce. For the purist, there is the New York pizza - red sauce, mozzarella, Parmesan, oregano and garlic. A full menu of salads, pastas and grilled entrees are also available. Pizzas are $9 to $11, pastas and grilled dishes $12 to $23. Lunch is noon to 4 P.M. and dinner 6 P.M. to 1 A.M. Friday and Saturday; Sunday brunch is noon to 3:30 P.M., dinner 5 to 11:30 P.M.

Ready-to-eatt hams are usually labeled as such. Unless the ham is fully cooked, it must be soaked in several changes of cold water to remove excess salt and scrubbed to remove any mold on the rind. It must then be cooked before the final glazing. Hams should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 to 165 degrees. Fresh ham is the uncooked, uncured upper hind leg of pork and should be cooked like a regular pork roast. $ Type of Ham Soaking Cooking Glazing Canned None None 10 minutes a pound ''Ready to eat'' None None 10 minutes or ''fully cooked'' a pound smoked or unsmoked Air-dried 12-24 hours Simmer or 10 minutes country ham bake in a pound or smoked water country ham 20 minutes a pound Smithfield 24-36 hours Simmer or 10 minutes style bake in a pound in water 20 minutes a pound Fresh, None Roast 18-20 None uncured minutes a pound at 350 degrees",1989-03-18T05:00:00+0000

Power is a recurring theme in this intriguing, frequently haunting collection of stories by Blair Fuller, a former editor of The Paris Review and the author of the novels ''A Far Place'' and ''Zebina's Mountain.'' There is hardly a story in ''A Butterfly Net and a Kingdom'' that does not explore issues of dominance and control, whether they arise between nations, races, lovers or, in several instances, one man and his addictions. What makes Mr. Fuller's writing exceptional, however, is the way he demonstrates how the subtlest shifts in one of these relationships can push it inevitably toward tragedy. In the title novella, for example, two men live in an odd kind of symbiosis. One is a trader who has established for himself what amounts to a dictatorship in a small African territory, the other an eccentric who collects animal specimens for museums. Each profits from the other's presence until a moment of envy tips the delicate balance, and numerous lives are irrevocably changed. Although a few of the stories seem almost autobiographical exercises - even the O. Henry Award-winning ''All Right,'' a wrenching saga of familial alcoholism in which the narrator bears the author's name, comes to a glib conclusion - ''A Butterfly Net and a Kingdom'' is a strong and disquieting collection.

First, he's the best technical coach around. He has devised a passing offense that still stupifies coaches whose teams have tried to defend it for years. Witnessing Princeton's back-door play can make even the most subdued fan dance for joy at the spectacle of supreme basketball choreography. Second, he adapts so well to changing players and rules. When blessed with a big man, his teams concentrate on getting the ball inside and interior passing; with the advent of the 3-point shot, Princeton's focus has shifted to perimeter passing for the open jumper. Third, Carril always gets the most out of his players. Carril recruits players of less physical prowess, but shapes them into a real team, strong on fundamentals, unselfishness, and competitive fire, one whose individual members always play within themselves and together.

Ito earned five 6.0's for technical merit for a program that included seven triple jumps. About 50 seconds into her routine she did a triple axel, the first time one had been completed by a woman in the world championships. In addition to the 6.0's, Ito received four 5.9's for technical merit. Her artistic-impression scores were all 5.8's except for one 5.9. She was third entering the free-skating segment, which counts for 50 percent of the total score. Claudia Leistner of West Germany edged Jill Trenary of the United States for second place. Trenary's teammate Kristi Yamaguchi, skating in her first world championships, put on a strong performance to climb one place to sixth. (AP) Golf Garbacz Takes Lead: Lori Garbacz came from two strokes back to tie Martha Nause on the 15th hole yesterday, then birdied No. 16 and No. 18 and took a two-stroke lead after three rounds of the Tucson Open.

Gore Vidal once called John Simon a ''literary gangster,'' adding that there was nothing Mr. Simon - best known for his trenchant theater reviews in New York magazine - could not ''find to hate.'' Yet as ''The Sheep From the Goats,'' a discerning, highly idiosyncratic collection of literary essays, attests, within the gangster lies an equally ferocious, uncompromising champion of literature. Here are consistently close, irreverent readings of Roland Barthes, Norman Mailer, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Joan Didion, Lillian Hellman and Vladimir Nabokov, as well as enthusiastic and insightful pieces about Milan Kundera, Randall Jarrell and Gunter Grass. Each is meticulously detailed, unflinchingly honest and, most of all, entertaining. Granted, sometimes the entertainment is at the expense of the author under scrutiny. Yet it is hard not to admire these terse, highly polished essays, even at their most vitriolic. Mr. Simon seems to have read everything, allowing him to make thoughtful literary comparisons; he appears as familiar with the literature of Latin America, France, England and Germany as he is with that of the United States. And though his caustic wit can sometimes sound more personally vindictive than objectively critical, it allows him to plow through a lot of literary pretentiousness. Mr. Simon is not without certain pretensions of his own, however. A master stylist as well as a stickler for detail, he manages to find factual and grammatical errors in everyone from Susan Sontag to John Updike. And he has an off-putting way of sprinkling French and German phrases into his pieces - usually without providing translations - as well as using long, obscure words like ''tergiversate'' or ''gallimaufry.''

us,FICTION,"THE EDGE OF THE WORLD. By Janusz Anderman. Translated by Nina Taylor. (Readers International, Cloth, $14.95; Paper, $7.95.) As in his previous volume of short stories, ''Poland Under Black Light,'' Janusz Anderman has, in this new collection, used the voice of the crowd to express the anguish and confusion of contemporary Poland. It's a pity that the flavor of the original is somewhat lost in translation (Polish working-class accents and rhythms have been reduced to English cockney slang), but the power and intensity remain. Mr. Anderman employs a cinematic style, juxtaposing sardonic visual images: as the National Theater burns down, a Japanese cameraman hopefully calls out the names of Solidarity leaders while the crowd taunts him with the words ''shogun, shogun''; as amateur gardeners huddle around their allotments, trying to protect their seeds from Chernobyl's radioactive dust, a crowd gathers in hopes of seeing miraculous apparitions that are supposed to have taken place nearby; as a military ceremony proceeds, its chilly pomp is broken by a man in a sheepskin jacket who cheekily writes the word ''Victory'' on a nearby bus shelter. The vision Mr. Anderman presents of life for the working poor is grim. Gullible and ignorant (at one point a little boy asks his grandfather, ''What was it like in Walesa's time?'' and the old man is unable to respond), they're sure nonetheless that something, even if they don't know quite what, is going on - and they're determined to be a part of it. This mute vision is interpreted by the thoughts and commentary of two intellectuals, writers who appear in the first and last stories of the collection and who give a gentle and ironic frame to the book. Unlike most of the Polish writers who were shaped by the politics of the 1960's, Mr. Anderman has not picked poetry as his medium. Nor has he shied away from the double burden of the writer as reporter and spokesman in a censored society. His vision is often grotesque, but never derivative.",1989-03-19T05:00:00+0000

The fungus among us in the British writer Stephen Gregory's second novel is a slimy, smelly, grotesquely phallic bottom-grower called a stinkhorn. It becomes an object of obsession for Andrew Pinkney, an English solicitor's clerk who has clobbered his girlfriend because she laughed at his impotence. Fleeing the scandal, he finds refuge in a dank cottage in the Welsh hills, where the erect and stinking stinkhorn, or woodwitch, as the locals know it, becomes symbolic of all that he cannot attain. Pinkney, a daft but pleasant fellow when we first meet him, decides to cultivate these disgusting growths, trusting that they'll make a dandy reconciliation gift for his girlfriend. Mr. Gregory, whose first novel, ''The Cormorant,'' earned him comparisons to Edgar Allan Poe and won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1987, describes Pinkney's adventures in amateur mycology in such nauseating detail that the book becomes an unrelenting gross-out of rotting animal corpses, wiggling larvae, buzzing flies and malignant imagery. He also gives us a plot whose elements never quite cohere. Shadings of supernatural evil go unexplained (we never learn, for example, why the big bad black sheep gives Pinkney such dirty looks).

us,NONFICTION,"REFLECTING ON THINGS PAST: The Memoirs of Peter Lord Carrington. (Cornelia and Michael Bessie/Harper & Row, $22.95.) Oh, to be an Englishman! Or rather, to write like one. Peter Lord Carrington is a man of his class and times - an aristocrat whose line began in the mid-17th century with one Thomas Smith of Nottingham, a draper who kept accounts for farmers. He was born and educated (at Eton, then Sandhurst) before the Great War. His class and times provide him with more than accomplished diction and an occasionally self-deprecating wit. One way to describe his record is as he does: that of ''a fairly public life''; another is as Henry Kissinger does, in an admiring preface, as the incarnation of ''matter-of-fact commitment to service.'' For his class, Lord Carrington is short on dotty relatives, but enormously long on offices served - from First Lord of the Admiralty to Secretary General of NATO - and he held them, and tells about them in ''Reflecting on Things Past,'' in a period that saw the decline of Britain from first among equals among the Great Powers to just another European country. A soldier in both world wars, he considers it the triumph of his time that such war is no longer possible, a political transformation, he says, that ''my generation regards . . . with astonishment and gratitude.'' As for the accompanying changes in social attitudes, he is too much a gent to deplore them. But that may be because although the world has much changed, he has not: ''We are, or should be, a family,'' he writes at the end, just before he celebrates the reduction of material hardship among the people. ''I don't find paternal an offensive word.''",1989-03-19T05:00:00+0000

We recognize them after a few notes, that's all.

The debate so far has focused on the cost to taxpayers, but new alarms are sounding over the insurance agency's unprecedented latitude to decide banking issues without consulting Congress or other regulators. [ Page D1. ] COMPANIES The struggle for Eastern Airlines enters a crucial phase in Federal Bankruptcy Court this week. A committee of creditors is to be formed, and a judge plans to hold a hearing on the airline's request that he appoint an examiner in the case rather than the trustee the pilots' union requested. The decision could be vital to the direction of the case in the months to come. [ B5. ] Eastern has started advertising for pilots to replace the pilots honoring the strike. The pilots' union said it would not be intimidated. [ B5. ] The seven regional phone companies will have more freedom to set long-distance connection fees under a Federal Communications Commission plan. The proposal is expected to face opposition. [ D1. ] Barneys New York and Isetan of Japan announced a venture in which stores would be opened in the U.S. and Asia under the Barneys name. About $250 million will be spent in the venture. [ D1. ] Ford will pay for nonmedical custodial care for severely impaired workers and their dependents at two factories in Kentucky. Ford said the experiment is the first employer-financed program in a major industry. [ D2. ] THE MEDIA BUSINESS The stakes are high in the bidding war for Connie Chung between NBC and CBS.

[ D8. ] Chrysler and Sears have decided not to advertise on an NBC show about student nurses. Viewers have complained that the show, ''Nightingales,'' exploits women. [ D8. ] Vintage Books is beginning a series of foreign classics of the 20th century. Its architects call it a first. [ D8. ] One of India's largest newspapers is being denounced for buying a substantial share of a smaller newspaper. Critics say the issue is editorial freedom. [ D8. ] Penchina, Selkowitz created a campaign of ''outrageousness'' for NBC to differentiate the network's new cable television news service from its competitors. Advertising.

Horizon Corp., a majority-owned subsidiary of Maxxam, recorded a provision to reduce certain of its real estate and related assets to estimated net realizable value during the latest fourth quarter. This resulted in a fourth quarter charge to Maxxam's consolidated results of operations of $28.4 million before income taxes and minority interests.

Judge Edward R. Neaher is assigned the case. Dec. 1, 1982: Judge Neaher rules that because members are not directly elected to the board, its ''legislative character'' is limited and not subject to the one-person-one-vote requirement. May 17, 1983: The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reverses Judge Neaher, saying that the board's makeup is subject to the constitutional requirement but makes no determination as to whether the provision is violated. Aug. 21, 1984: Judge Neaher issues a preliminary decision, saying the board's structure ''would appear to be unconstitutional.'' Nov. 19, 1986: Judge Neaher rules the structure violates the equal-protection clause of the Constitution by not providing equal representation based on population differences of the five boroughs. He orders the city to change the board's method of voting. Nov. 20, 1986: Mayor Edward I. Koch announces his decision to create a Charter Revision Commission to revise the board. Membership of the 15-member review panel is completed on Dec. 8, 1986. Oct. 8, 1987: The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upholds Judge Neaher's ruling and says changes in the board should be made within one year.

She was more right than she realized. Our place isn't like a museum, it is a museum, and some day I propose to schedule a walk-through for her and her sister. How else will they know what to keep and what to get rid of when I am gone? ''Do what you will with the mattresses,'' I'll tell them, ''but everything else here is priceless.'' Priceless, that is, if one knows their stories. For instance, the clay pot handle on the shelf where I keep travel books. It doesn't look like much; in fact, it looks like something that broke off yesterday. But 20 years ago in Jerusalem, I watched while workmen excavated a trench near the Temple of Solomon. A bearded man uncovered the handle, one of many, and threw it up to me. Perhaps I should tag it ''Pot handle, Jerusalem, 1969.'' Perhaps I should tag everything in this museum. ''Staffordshire goat bought in memory of a day spent touring goat farm in northeastern Connecticut, 1964.'' ''Couches purchased from L. R. after her divorce because they wouldn't fit into the elevator of her new building, 1979.'' ''Mirror picked up from gutter on East 12th Street, 1969. Said to have belonged to Peaches Browning.''

us,NEW SUMMARY,"International A2-10 A policy toward Central America, including more aid for the Nicaraguan contras, was tentatively accepted by Bush officials and Congressional leaders. Page A1 The Palestinian diaspora retains a strong attachment to the land and people under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. But these days that relationship has been challenged. A1 Moscow's recent Middle East efforts may be explained by its growing concern that Israel, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt either have or are developing missiles that can hit Soviet territory, experts say. A2 A new hijacking warning to airlines in Europe again raised the issue of public access to security information. Bush Administration officials expressed distress that the warning had been made public. A3 Afghan efforts to defend Jalalabad appeared to have suffered a setback with the disclosure that a bridge between Kabul and Jalalabad had been blown up by guerrillas. A8 The rebel's failure to take a city and the continued supply of Soviet military equipment to the Afghan Government has led Bush Administration officials to reassess their optimism that the Government will fall soon. A8 The confrontation in South Africa between President P. W. Botha and the National Party leader, F. W. de Klerk, which has paralyzed South Africa's governing white party, appears to have been resolved. A3 The operator of a Japanese tanker that collided with an overloaded fishing boat, apparently drowning about 130 Vietnamese refugees, said that three other ships ignored calls to help save the victims. A6 Vote is another survival test for Turkish Premier A8 A lawyer attracts Poland's radical youth A10 National A11-17 In the inquiry into Pentagon fraud, a Navy engineer and a California military contractor pleaded guilty to Federal conspiracy charges, the third round of guilty pleas in the case since indictments were issued. A1 Raising the minimum wage to $4.55 an hour from $3.35, was approved by the House of Representatives, defying a veto threat by President Bush. It is the first increase in eight years. A1 To end Eastern's strike quickly, the Federal bankruptcy judge overseeing the case ordered the appointment of an examiner with a broad mandate to get the airline's planes back in the air. A1 In Miami's war on drugs, a citizen who waged a dangerous and lonely fight against pushers was shot to death this week in a hail of up to 30 bullets in the doorway of his store. A1 The idea of huge remote airfields that are almost exclusively transfer points rather than a place for people to start or end journeys is supported by a growing number of aviation planners. A13 Has home rule failed in Washington? Some Congressional Republicans, angered by the District's murder rate and drug trade, are proposing to strip away some of the city government's powers. A12 If Republicans fan partisan warfare, House Democratic leaders warned the Bush Administration that biparti-san cooperation between Congress and the White House could be jeopardized. A17 To modernize the nuclear arsenal on land, the Secretary of Defense should support a compromise that would mix competing missile programs, military officials say. A14 Fawn Hall was tearful and angry as she testified that Oliver L. North's dismissal from the national security council distressed her because she had ''never met a man who worked harder for his country.'' A12 Washington Talk A14 To push the savings and loan bailout through Congress, the White House is counting on Senator Jake Garn, former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. But the Utahan has a problem with the Bush plan. Regional B1-5 New York City's new government is likely to include a stronger City Council with full power to approve a multibillion dollar budget, members of the charter commission said. A1 News analysis: The redesigning of city government seems likely to focus on a relationship that dates to the turn of the century and drives much of city politics: the balance between City Hall and the boroughs. B4 Staten Islanders mourned their loss of power in reaction to the United States Supreme Court ruling that New York City's Board of Estimate was unconstitutional. There was anger and calls for secession. B4 A municipal law was overturned by a New York court. The law barred four unrelated people from living together in a single-family home. The ruling has implications for zoning. A1 In Mineola, L.I., a man was charged with the murder of his 13-year-old Valley Stream neighbor, Kelly Tinyes. The 21-year-old suspect, who is unemployed and lives with his parents, surrendered voluntarily. B1 Eviction can lead to homelessness in New York City, where there is an almost nonexistent vacancy rate. The percentage of homeless people who have lost their apartments that way is estimated at 26 percent. A1 To preserve the Upper West Side, a committee recommended that builders of luxury towers provide housing for the poor and that a zoning device used to create extra large buildings be curtailed. B1 How much can the state spend? With New York facing its worst financial problems since the mid-1970's, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders remained divided as the state's budget deadline approached. B3",1989-03-24T05:00:00+0000

People who hold I.R.A.'s but do not have qualified pension plans at work are not affected. Some experts believe that I.R.A. certificates of deposit still offer the best returns among types of C.D.'s, whether or not you get a tax deduction. In addition to fixed-rate I.R.A. C.D.'s, banks also offer them with variable rates, which are most common on certificates with an 18-month maturity. Individuals can roll over their I.R.A. money from one institution to another without bank penalty, but beware: some places are charging a fee for that privilege. Check to find out if there is a fee and if that fee still makes a transfer worthwhile. Here are some yields on I.R.A.

''Morgan's Cake'' adopts his point of view and reflects his bewilderment in sly, fresh, unexpectedly comic ways.",1989-03-25T05:00:00+0000

Koontz's latest novel, ''Midnight,'' takes the theme of demonic possession a giant step beyond mere aliens from outer space. A set of mysterious disappearances and suspicious deaths in the northern California town of Moonlight Cove brings together an undercover F.B.I. agent named Sam Booker and Tessa Lockland, a documentary film producer who suspects that the local police report of her sister's suicide has been falsified. They discover that someone has been turning the town's citizens into humanoids. So far, this sounds like pretty ordinary horror-movie stuff. But Mr. Koontz's characters - even the zombies - are fallible, complex and human. (For example, one woman who has been ''converted'' into a ''New Person'' bitterly misses sleep, even though her husband assures her she no longer requires it.) Sam and Tessa ally themselves with Harry Talbot, a disabled Vietnam veteran who, despite his dependence on a wheelchair, enjoys many of life's amenities thanks to his Labrador, Moose, who performs such tasks as fetching cold Coors from the fridge. The plot develops more by an eerie, foglike osmosis than by the march of events, and the skillfully drawn characters are lifelike and sympathetic.

us,NONFICTION,"DEAF IN AMERICA: Voices From a Culture. By Carol Padden and Tom Humphries. (Harvard University, $17.95.) Deafness means a great deal more than simply being unable to hear. In ''Deaf in America,'' Carol Padden and Tom Humphries - themselves deaf - argue that the deaf have developed a distinct culture that includes sign language, shared experiences and ideas that often set them apart from the hearing world. (Ms. Padden, who teaches communications at the University of California, San Diego, and Mr. Humphries, who is associate dean of the San Diego Community College District, describe this culture with the upper-case ''Deaf.'') The authors' most persuasive arguments are anecdotes about deaf families, and in particular about how deaf children see the world. One boy who grew up in a large family had been frustrated in his attempts to communicate with a girl next door. He did not realize quite what the problem was, however, until one day at the girl's home ''her mother walked up to them and animatedly began to move her mouth. As if by magic, the girl picked up a dollhouse and moved it to another place.'' The puzzled boy immediately ran home to ask his mother about the poor girl's affliction. The book becomes far less accessible to the uninitiated reader when the authors analyze the poetry and theater of the deaf. Tragically, however, the community does not reach the lives of all deaf people, particularly the uneducated. ''Deaf in America'' is a fascinating glimpse into a world unfamiliar to most of us.",1989-03-26T05:00:00+0000

Inside a hollowed-out mountain, a Japanese beggar assembles a community of outcasts intent on surviving nuclear war. Last year our reviewer, Edmund White, said this novel is ''highly cinematic [ with its ] psychological observation that is suggested through close-ups; lots of punchy dialogue; a convincing sense of place; a building of suspense; and a pervasive atmosphere of sexuality and violence.'' WINFIELD: A Player's Life, by Dave Winfield with Tom Parker. (Avon, $4.50.) Dave Winfield's book hasJU been updated to include the latest skirmishes in his legendary war with George Steinbrenner. But this story of life with the New York Yankees is not the broadside it is often made out to be, Allen Barra said here last year. ''After all the torment and public humiliation Mr. Steinbrenner has put Mr. Winfield through, this book is a very light revenge indeed,'' he said. ''What 'Winfield' does offer is a straightforward account of how the life of a baseball player worth $23 million is different from everyone else's.'' LONG DISTANCES, by Fabienne Marsh. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $6.95.) When Michael takes a sabbatical in London to finish a book of poetry, his wife, Kate, a producer of television documentaries, starts feeling less and less like a woman in love. By telling the story as a modern-day version of an 18th-century epistolary novel, Fabienne Marsh ''puts a fresh spin'' on the tale, Bethami Probst said here last year. GATES OF EDEN: American Culture in the Sixties, by Morris Dickstein. (Penguin, $8.95.) Many of those who went through the 60's remember the era more for its music and literature than for its politics. In 1977 our reviewer, Christopher Lasch, praised Morris Dickstein's book for considering both the failures and the triumphs of the cultural upheaval: ''His book makes the unqualified opposition of such critics as Philip Rahv, Saul Bellow and Daniel Bell seem flat and uninformative by comparison.'' THE STORY OF MY WIFE: The Reminiscences of Captain Storr, by Milan Fust. Translated by Ivan Sanders. (Vintage International, $8.95.) In a book-length monologue, an obsessively jealous husband rages against his wife's supposed infidelities - but are they real or imaginary? Written four decades ago by the Hungarian poet Milan Fust, this translation has appeared ''not a minute too soon,'' Amy Edith Johnson said last year in The Book Review. ''Literary fashion has just caught up with it.'' AGNES SMEDLEY: The Life and Times of an American Radical, by Janice R. MacKinnon and Stephen R. MacKinnon. (University of California, $12.95.) During China's Communist revolution, Agnes Smedley, an expatriate American journalist, traveled with the forces of Mao Zedong and is now buried outside Beijing. This is a ''first-rate'' biography of a woman who might be described as John Reed's counterpart in China, John Patrick Diggins said here in 1987. It is ''rich in detail, lucid in expression and judicious in interpretation.'' TRUST, by Mary Flanagan. (Pantheon, $8.95.) A very decent London lawyer becomes obsessed with the self-destructive mistress of an unsuccessful artist. ''The art world background against which much of the action takes place - some of it in London and some in New York - is rendered with crisp and telling strokes,'' Calvin Tomkins said in reviewing the novel here in 1988. FOR A NEW NOVEL: Essays on Fiction, by Alain Robbe-Grillet. Translated by Richard Howard. (Northwestern University, $9.95.) With their hard surface textures, the so-called new novels written by the likes of Alain Robbe-Grillet are hard for many readers to penetrate. In these essays, he explains why he writes that way. In 1966 Eliot Fremont-Smith said in The Times that the book ''shows the possibilities of the novel, and possible ways of thinking about the novel; and it shows how little most of us, writers, readers, critics, have dared to think.'' DEATHWATCH, by Ray Harrison. (Berkley, $3.50.) The body of an undercover policeman is found impaled on the railing of a London church, setting off a search for a murderer that climaxes with a chase in a hot-air balloon. ''It is all quite entertaining, in an easygoing way,'' John Gross said in The Times in 1986. A WOMAN OF EGYPT, by Jehan Sadat. (Pocket Books, $8.95.) As the wife of President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, the author of these memoirs fought Islamic fundamentalists to promote women's rights. ''The book is most believable when it concentrates on Mrs. Sadat's own area of achievement - work to raise the consciousness and legal rights of Egyptian women,'' Barbara Slavin said here in 1987. A BOAT OFF THE COAST, by Stephen Dobyns. (Penguin, $3.95.) A Vietnam veteran named Tucker Morgan figures that his best ticket out of Belfast, Me., is a quick, one-time-only cocaine deal. Then Lowell Perry, a dockworker who sells information to the Feds, gets wind of the scheme. ''The author delves into his scene, and cares about his characters,'' Mark Childress said here in 1987. ''His tale of friendships, betrayal and greed has a dark and complex undercurrent.'' THE BELARUS SECRET: The Nazi Connection in America, by John Loftus. Edited by Nathan Miller. (Paragon House, $12.95.) Intent on fighting Communism, our Government recruited thousands of former Nazis, the author argues, later allowing them to settle in the United States. In 1982 The Times's Ralph Blumenthal said the book seems overstated but makes ''a persuasive case.''",1989-03-26T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THE RISING. By Edgar White. (Marion Boyars/Kampmann, $18.95.) ''West Indians,'' we are told in this first novel of a projected trilogy, ''never say no.'' Instead they slide around the negative with suggestion and innuendo, but God help those who misread the signals. Mother Frances rules the society of a small Caribbean island, manipulating her way unscathed through the prevailing hurricanes of sex and (usually) psychic violence. Hers is an unruly realm, a place where being part of ''the long-established elite . . . meant merely having come from two generations of money instead of one.'' A dynamism of self-creation pervades the island, but it's a dynamism that often goes wrong, as when Mother Frances' interminable maneuvers to shape the future unexpectedly end in the arrival of a great-grandson, Legion, the illegitimate offspring of her granddaughter Desmie and Carlton Wade, a local no-account. The story of what happens because of this disrupting event is given fine shape and color by Edgar White, a well-regarded dramatist born in Montserrat. With a flawless ear for local dialect and an equally discerning eye for island custom, Mr. White juices up an occasionally thin plot line with a bouncy calypso beat. Here the idly victimized women who routinely ''disappear from girlhood into woman,'' the men in whom ''desire and hatred moved together'' and the children who are trapped in an endemic boredom meet under the indifferent tropical sun, all wanting to escape their little island, but none quite knowing how. So when the bewildered Legion finally exits, he takes much of the place with him: a weight of memory, unfocused sexuality and a vague guilt, all of which promise to crowd the next volume of his story with the same strange and compelling energy that's on such fine display here.",1989-03-26T05:00:00+0000

CLEAN AND SOBER - With his alcohol and cocaine problems out of hand, Daryl (Michael Keaton) checks into a rehabilitation center and gradually turns his denial and self-centeredness into understanding and compassion.

MIDNIGHT RUN - Robert De Niro is a wise-cracking but soft-hearted bounty hunter who collects Charles Grodin, as a hapless but wily white-collar criminal, and dashes cross country with the Mafia in pursuit.

A danger in retelling the life of a national hero is that the subject's virtues often are inflated and his shortcomings diminished. Thus, in ''Lord Nelson,'' an unguardedly affectionate biography of Britain's most notable mythologized naval hero, conspicuous character deficits - cynicism, vanity, decadence, infantilism and cruelty - are largely dismissed, defended or recast as attributes. Nelson's notorious abandonment of his wife, Fanny, and his fathering of a child with the beautiful and flattering Emma Hamilton (as her husband slept nearby) were hardly admirable deeds. And it must be remembered that much of what is known of Nelson's charity was recorded by Nelson himself in self-conscious letters and journals, in hopes of gaining posterity's adulation. The authors, the military historian David Howarth and his son, Stephen Howarth, compensate most responsibly by providing anecdotes from which the reader may reach a balanced - and, finally, no less warm - appraisal. Nelson's appetite for battle and his passion for Lady Hamilton are revealed in theatrical, often droll, detail. The authors' sensitive dissection of his marital failure, as well as Nelson's own emotional self-exposure in every aspect of his life, give the book its humanity. Like its subject, who came to life only in pursuit of glory, the book gains momentum toward the end, in the taut final six chapters that build to Nelson's mortal wounds on the quarterdeck of his flagship, Victory, while trouncing the French at Trafalgar in 1805.",1989-03-26T05:00:00+0000

We were among the thousands in the crowd in St. Peter's Square after the Pope's Sunday noon balcony appearance and blessing. As we walked away from the square a wisp of a young, blond girl sidled up to us and said, ''Am I wrong or are you Americans?'' Seeing no harm in admitting a fact about which we were rather proud, we said Yes. She then asked ''How would you like a free guided bus tour of Rome tomorrow morning, followed by an exquisite free luncheon at the Hilton?'' In response to our question about the quid pro quo, she answered: ''All you have to do is watch a 20-minute film presented by your host, Gulf American.''

Oxford finished the four and a half miles along the Thames River in 18 minutes 28 seconds, almost 2 minutes slower than the record of 16:45 it set in 1984. Cambridge had a time of 18:35 in calm water and clear weather. Since 1976, the Dark Blues of Oxford have lost only in 1986. The Light Blues of Cambridge still hold an overall 69-65-1 lead in the race that began in 1829. The winning coxswain was Alison Norrish of England, while a Harvard University graduate, Leigh Weiss, a former member of the United States national lightweight crew, was the coxswain for Cambridge. Oxford opened a six-second lead halfway through the race and never was seriously challenged.(AP) Golf Norman Gains Lead on Third 68 in Row: Greg Norman, fully recovered from a wrist injury that hampered him last year, shot his third straight 68 yesterday to take the lead after three rounds of the USF&G Classic in New Orleans. His 54-hole score of 12-under-par 204 put him one shot ahead of Tim Simpson, who entered the day tied for the lead with Dan Forsman and shot a 70. Forsman had a 71 and was tied with Hal Sutton at 206. Sutton shot a 67. Tom Kite, seeking a third straight tournament victory, shot a 74 and was at 213. Norman had six birdies and two bogeys. He two-putted from 10 feet on No. 5 for a bogey and two-putted from 12 feet on No. 18. The tournament is the first professional event at the 7,106-yard, par-72 course at English Turn, a course dredged from a swamp under the direction of Jack Nicklaus.(AP) Charles Takes 3-Shot Lead: Bob Charles of New Zealand, the defender, shot a one-under-par 71 yesterday to take a three-stroke lead after the second round of the $370,000 Fuji Electric Grand Slam golf tournament - an official PGA Seniors Tour event, in Katori, Japan. Charles had a six-under-par 138 over the 6,660-yard Oak Hills Country Club course. Larry Mowry of the United States shot a 72 and was three strokes back in second place at 141. Tommy Aaron and Don January, both of the United States, shot 71's to share third place at 142.(AP) Bowling Soper Beats Miller in Kansas Final: Butch Soper downed Hugh Miller, 216-174, in the championship game yesterday to capture his first Professional Bowlers Association crown in five years at the $150,000 King Louie Open at Overland Park, Kan. Soper earned $27,000 for his third career victory. The victory also qualifies Soper for the prestigious 52-man field in the 1989 Tournament of Champions, which begins April 19 in Akron, Ohio. Miller earned his berth in the final by eliminating Jon O'Drobinak, 259-233. O'Drobinak had won his first two matches, beating Walter Ray Williams Jr., 235-234, and Chris Warren, 202-184.(AP) Tennis Sabatini Has Easy Victory: Gabriela Sabatini cruised past Belinda Cordwell of New Zealand, 6-2, 6-1, yesterday to reach the fourth round of the Lipton International Players championships at Key Biscayne, Fla.

Helena Sukova and Lori McNeil, seeded third and 10th, also advanced, but sixth-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria and No. 12 Arantxa Sanchez of Spain lost in straight sets. Maleeva was hampered by a pair of sore ankles and lost by 6-2, 6-2 to Isabelle Demongeot of France. Maleeva hurt her left ankle in a tournament at Indian Wells, Calif., three weeks ago and injured her right ankle in a second-round triumph over Gigi Fernandez.(AP) Dog Show Norfolk Terrier Is Best: A Norfolk terrier, Ch.

You circle an antique table laden with Limoges until you find your name on a place card in a silver holder. By the light of a crystal chandelier, you sup on smoked salmon and oysters. Welcome to the world of Danielle Steel, but watch your step! It's not all Patek Philippe and Rolls-Royce, a world where ''the only crisis'' is ''being a guest short for dinner.'' It's also a world of rape, murder, adultery, greed and spite. ''Star,'' Ms. Steel's 24th novel, has all the lust and luster you'd expect. It's the vintage Steel her fans thirst for. It's full of nice characters who are too nice, evil ones who are too evil and, of course, ambivalent lovers who are too ambivalent. More frustrating than frustrated, her lovers drive you crazy. After a while you want to pick up a polo mallet and whack a little sense into them. Crystal, a rancher's daughter, and Spencer, the son of a judge, meet at a wedding early in the novel. It's love at first sight, but Ms. Steel spends the next 400 or so pages finding ways to keep them apart and make them miserable. Crystal's father dies, her mother hates her, her brother-in-law rapes her, her dreams of stardom seduce her. Spencer's parents want too much for him, his senses get the better of his sense, his wife doesn't understand him and won't let him go. Will the star-crossed lovers get it all together and stroll off into the happily ever after? Not to give away too much, it's safe to say Ms. Steel's fans won't be disappointed.",1989-03-26T05:00:00+0000

Not that simple! Digging at Tell es-Sultan (the site of ancient Jericho), 1907 to 1909, Sellin and Watzinger found two concentric rings of fortifications made of sun-dried bricks. The inner wall surrounding the ridge of the tell (hill) is about 12 feet thick. The outer wall, running along the foot of the tell, is about six feet thick and must have been 25 to 30 feet high.

us,"Recycling Law's Mechanics: Symphony of Sorting, Maybe","With New York City facing a garbage crisis, the City Council is expected to approve a bill tomorrow that would make the recycling of newspapers, magazines, cardboard, glass bottles and metal cans mandatory. Under the bill, each household would be required to sort the recyclable materials. The bill raises questions as to how a city as large as New York will coordinate and enforce such a law. Here is an attempt at some answers: Q. What happens under the proposed recycling bill? A. All households would be required to separate trash into three categories: regular garbage, paper products such as newspapers, magazines and cardboard, and glass bottles and cans. In private houses, residents would have to bundle newspapers and place bottles and cans in a separate blue container for pick up. In apartment houses, building owners and managers must establish the procedures for collecting the materials in the buildings and placing them out for sanitation workers. Q. Where will the garbage go? A. Regular garbage would still go to the city's landfills and incinerators. Recyclable items would be taken to processing centers. Newspapers would go to dealers for baling and shipping to mills that recycle or export them. Glass bottles and metal cans would go to a city-owned center in East Harlem for sorting and shipping. Q. Is there enough capacity to handle everything collected? A. No. The city plans to build five new processing centers as it collects more recyclable material. Q. When would the new law go into effect? A. If approved tomorrow by the City Council and promptly signed by the Mayor, it could take effect on about July 1. The Sanitation Commissioner is developing regulations and intends to have a six-month education period before imposing fines. Q. How will it be enforced? A. Sanitation police would inspect buildings and issue summonses similar to traffic tickets. Violators would be fined $25 for the first infraction, $50 for the second and $100 for the third. A person or building deemed a persistent violator could be fined from $500 for a single household to $10,000 for a large building. Persistent violation is defined as four infractions in a six-month period. Fines would be mailed to the Environmental Control Board and summonses challenged there. Q. Where would it start? A. Recycling would begin in neighborhoods already in the department's voluntary pilot program, including: Clinton, Chelsea, Greenwhich Village and the West Village in Manhattan; Throgs Neck in the Bronx; the Brooklyn Heights, Dyker Heights and Fort Greene sections of Brooklyn; Forest Hills, Rego Park and Bayside in Queens, and the southern end of Staten Island. The program would be expanded to new areas over five years. Q. How much waste is collected by New York City a year? A. More than five million tons of solid watse is collected from households by the Sanitation Department. Private carters dump almost three million tons that they collect from buinesses. Q. Why do we need to recycle? A. The city's principal dumping site, the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, is filling up rapidly and expected to be full by the turn of the century. A smaller landfill, Edgemere in Rockaway, Queens, is expected to close in 1991. Q. Does the city have other plans for the garbage crisis? A. The city, which already has three incinerators, hopes to build one at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But incinerators cannot handle the vast amounts of garbage collected, and environmentalists object to them as sources of pollution. Q. Will other materials be collected under the recycling plan? A. The Sanitation Department is developing programs to collect leaves and cut grass for composting. The department also hopes to begin collecting Christmas trees each January for chipping into mulch for gardens and parks, and to develop separate locations for disposing old tires and batteries. Q. What about private businesses and institutions? A. The Sanitation Commissioner is businesses and offices, under which private carters would collect the material, most of it paper.",1989-03-27T05:00:00+0000

Peering through his telescope toward the horizon behind America, the captain said, ''There is no second, your majesty.'' Now there is no first. Also, no class. In a 14-page decision, a New York State Supreme Court justice, Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick, has ruled that for sailing a catamaran, the San Diego Yacht Club must forfeit the cup it had retained against the giant monohull, New Zealand, in last September's two-race sweep off the southern California coast.

us,Dining Out Guide: Business Entertaining,"This is a summary of restaurant reviews that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. Bouley **(Nov. 20, 1987), 165 Duane Street (608-3852) - Combining a meal with a business meeting calls for the appropriate setting. Bouley, near the center of the financial district, provides a splendid French country atmosphere, well-spaced tables and a proficient and businesslike service staff. On the current menu are an appetizer of cured gravlax of tuna, entrees of roasted pigeon in puff pastry with spring vegetables and bass braised with baby spring greens and garnished with ''scales'' of paper-thin pickled cucumber slices. Soft-shell crabs will be added to the menu in about two weeks. Five-course lunch is $32 prix fixe; nine-course tasting menu at dinner is $65. A la carte prices at dinner: $6 to $16 for appetizers, $19 to $27 for entrees. Open noon to 3 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M. Friday; 6 to 11 P.M. Saturday. Closed Sunday. Lavin's *(June 20, 1986), 23 West 39th Street (921-1288) - Lavin's dining room, paneled in carved golden oak, has a stylish cafe ambiance. In the front of the house is a convivial wine bar with a Cruvinet and an ever-changing selection of by-the-glass offerings. Mesquite carpaccio of beef and grilled shiitake mushrooms with garlic, lemon and fresh herbs are two choices from the appetizer menu. Entrees include fettuccine Provencal, grilled yellowfin tuna with scallion crepes, and the recommended grilled veal chop and the cold poached salmon. Homemade ice cream (a choice of 10 flavors) is scooped into the profiteroles, a recommended dessert. Appetizers at both lunch and dinner $6 to $9; entrees $14 to $24. Friday from noon to 2:30 P.M. and 5:30 to 9 P.M. Closed Saturday and Sunday. Manhattan Ocean Club * (June 10, 1988), 57 West 58th Street (371-7777) - Neither a club nor restaurant heavy on maritime decor, this midtown seafood house is a stylish, sophisticated spot for a business lunch or dinner. Niches in the cream-colored walls showcase limited-edition ceramic pieces by Picasso; a twisting stairway leads to a second-story dining area. Recommended to start are the crab cakes or a dish of five oysters baked five ways (with Pernod, curry, peppers, pesto and oregano). Choices for an entree include halibut with beurre blanc; farm-raised striped bass with soy and ginger sauce and mahi-mahi with citrus butter. Appetizers $7.50 to $12.50 at lunch, $9.50 to $13.50 at dinner. Entrees $18.50 to $25.50 at lunch, $19.50 to $28.50 at dinner. Open noon to midnight on Friday, 5 P.M. to midnight Saturday and Sunday. Prunelle **(May 23, 1986), 18 East 54th Street (759-6410) - Here is a handsome midtown restaurant with a lavish amount of burled woodwork and etched-glass Art Deco partitions. Classic French cuisine and nouvelle-style touches are combined in the menu. Dishes include appetizers of steamed shrimp wrapped in spinach, and seared foie gras. Among the entrees are tarragon-flavored crab salad (at lunch); smoked lobster served on homemade pasta; veal and beef medallions with two sauces, and sauteed shrimp with angel-hair pasta. Lunch is prix fixe at $38; dinner prix fixe at $58. Friday lunch noon to 3 P.M., dinner Friday through Sunday 5:30 to 11 P.M. The Polo **(Sept. 2, 1988), Westbury Hotel, Madison Avenue and 69th Street (535-9141 and 535-9142) - The theme is distinctively equestrian at this restaurant in the Westbury. Patrons are greeted by a portrait of Prince Charles dressed for a polo match, and the mahogany walls of the clubby dining room are hung with prints of equine subjects. Good starters include smoked quail with an herby potato salad, and pepper-coated slices of seared tuna over greens. Among the recommended main courses are roasted guinea hen and salmon with horseradish crust. Maine lobster with couscous and warm curry vinaigrette is a new addition. Appetizers at lunch $8 to $11.50; entrees $20 to $26. Appetizers at dinner $8 to $19; entrees $26 to $29. Lunch served noon to 2:30 P.M. daily; dinner 6 to 10 P.M. daily.
