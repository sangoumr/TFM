White's ''America in Search of Itself: The Making of the President, 1956-1980,'' which will be published this month by Harper & Row. A Cornelia and Michael Bessie Book. By Theodore H. White By 1980, the Democratic Party as the nation had known it for half a century had collapsed. The Democrats had always happily worked both sides of many streets: They were pragmatic yet idealistic; they were for full employment at home and free trade abroad; they were for peace everywhere and for a bold foreign policy; they were for black and white, for women and youth, for the workingman, the farmer, the small-business man. But now the Democrats were split, as if they hadlost their nerve or sensed a growing loss of public faith in their leadership, in Washington and in community life. And abroad, America had been humiliated by the Moslem tyrant of Iran. All that bound together the interlocking power groups as they approached the election of 1980 was their common belief that the purpose of Government was to govern. But none of their three candidates could agree on how that Government should conduct the affairs of the nation.",1982-05-02T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Graziano got little of interest out of the three instruments that made up his chamber ensemble, and his settings were not particularly memorable.

This topic has been a staple of critical discussion ever since the company's inception in 1944, but has become an obsession with analysts since the City Opera moved from West 55th Street to Lincoln Center in 1966. The original idea was to provide moderate-priced opera for the mythic character that politicians in the euphoric 40's called the Common Man. To a surprising extent, the plan worked, too. However, keeping the democratic flame burning brightly has become increasingly more difficult in the marbled precincts of Lincoln Center. With the comparatively wealthy and socially upscale neighbor, the Metropolitan Opera, only a few yards away across the plaza, the temptation on the City Opera's part has been to try to compete, both artistically and financially, with the grande dame. And the temptation for critics to compare the two companies, almost invariably to the detriment of the one with the smaller budget, has not been resisted.

But these are not dark days for Blinka, who has been the starting middle linebacker in every game since 1979, his rookie year. ''It crossed my mind that they might have drafted Crable because it went back to last year and my contract,'' he said yesterday at the middle session of the three-day camp for veterans. ''But when you think about it, there are a couple of third-round linebackers on this team and some free agents, and this upgrades the linebackers.'' Last summer, Blinka asked to be traded. He was sulking during training camp, when the team refused to renegotiate a five-year deal he had signed as a fifth-round draft choice out of Sam Houston State. He contended that he would get less than $50,000 for the season, the third year of his contract. But now he spoke optimistically about his future with the club. ''They told me that if I had a good season in 1981, they would give me a new contract at figures close to what I wanted,'' he said. The Jets say they do not renegotiate contracts, which technically may be true. But they could extend Blinka's contract, starting with 1983, his option year, and give him a substantial signing bonus. ...

However, this diversity is also the source of the greatest dilemma in their use - the need for careful planning prior to planting. Only the most knowlegeable perennial specialist would plant a border without first sketching out a plan. Even then, most would make changes from year to year to obtain the desired balance and overall effect.",1982-05-09T05:00:00+0000

There was a time, around the turn of the century, when women took every precaution to keep the sun off their faces, wearing wide-brimmed hats and shouldering parasols. Then in the 1920's, Coco Chanel, the legendary Paris designer, launched sunbathing as an ''in'' - that is to say, acceptable - sport as she exposed her face and figure to the sun for hours. And thus, starting with a few fashionable imitators, the pursuit of suntanned bodies proliferated into an international mania. Later, in the 1950's, the bikini also started to gain acceptability, appearing more and more frequently on public beaches. After that, it was only a matter of time before topless beaches sprang up all over Europe and the United States. As swimwear covered less and less, the yearning for deep, dark tanned bodies increased more and more.",1982-05-09T05:00:00+0000

It would initially call for both sides to reduce by onethird their nuclear warheads on land-and sea-based ballistic missiles. This would reduce to about 5,000 the number of warheads possessed by each country, the first step toward their acceptance of an ''equal ceiling'' on the ''throw weight'' or total payload of nuclear weapons of all kinds, the President said. He said that he has written to Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, suggesting that formal negotiations start at the end of June. (Page A1, Column 6.) Soviet leaders will not approve any strategic arms reduction deal that requires a ''unilateral reduction by the Soviet Union while permitting a buildup by the United States,'' the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said. The article appeared before President Reagan's speech in Illinois proposing that the United States and the Soviet Union reduce nuclear warheads by one-third. (A15:2-5.)",1982-05-10T05:00:00+0000

For one thing, the prevailing skepticism of his outlook renders Billy Wilder an unusual subject for dewy-eyed testimonial treatment, as does the scope of his career.

The two ships were believed to be supplying food to the Argentine troops on West Falkland, the more sparsely populated of the two islands. (Page A1, Column 6.) The U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires denied that it was guilty of any ''inappropriate conduct'' in the Falklands crisis. The unusual statement followed Argentine newspaper reports that Ambassador Harry W. Shlaudeman and other embassy officials had met with opposition political leaders in an attempt to ''destabilize'' the military junta lead by Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri. The newspaper reports had cited unidentified sources high in the Government. Argentine journalists and Western diplomats said the sources for the accusations were leading officers in the junta.

(Page A1, Columns 3-6.) Argentina braced for a possible attack by Britain on the Falkland Islands, while Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez insisted that Argentina still considered the United Nations mediation effort to be alive.

The iron dice are rolling again.  Britain and Argentina are lurching toward war. Is there hope left for an interim solution? There is, in the opinion of several senior United Nations officials. The time is ripe, they believe, for creation of a small United Nations peace force. Such a presence in the Falkland Islands could buy time and save lives. Both sides could agree to the stationing of the soldier-administrators there while they resolved their differences diplomatically. Moreover, history provides a striking analogy: the West New Guinea crisis of 1962.","West New Guinea, a Pacific island, had been a Dutch colony since the 19th century. But when Indonesia achieved independence in 1949, President Sukarno claimed the territory. The Dutch refused to give it up, and a decade of negotiations yielded no solution. In 1962, fighting erupted between Dutch and Indonesian forces. The United States was caught in the middle between a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member and a third-world country. The Soviet Union took President Sukarno's side and provided Indonesia with critical intelligence. War seemed inevitable then, as it does now in the South Atlantic.",1982-05-21T05:00:00+0000

Nimitz - a need of which the Reagan Administration is keenly aware. Its fiscal 1983 budget request to Congress included funds for construction of two Nimitz-class vessels - the Navy now has three - which cost at least $2.5 billion each.","For many years, budget-conscious Senators and Representatives have argued that the day of the big flattop is nearing an end. They envision a need for several smaller mini-carriers, and when arguing for them cite both the cost and decreased vulnerability of such ships. But would smaller vessels be cost-effective?

Manager Dick Williams is angered by a decision of Ballard Smith, the Padres' president. Smith, in turn, refuses to budge. And caught in the middle is Tim Flannery, a 24-year-old second baseman. The problems began last week when Juan Bonilla, the Padres' regular second baseman, broke a bone in his wrist, an injury that is expected to keep him out for the rest of the season. Flannery, who batted .254 in 37 games with San Diego last season, was available to fill in, but Williams thought he had a better idea: Why not sign Rodney Scott? Scott is a weak hitter but was one of the National League's leading base-stealing threats until let go by Montreal recently after three seasons there, and he had played for Williams, whom the Expos dismissed as manager last season. Smith did not think much of the idea, though, saying that Williams and General Manager Jack McKeon could have the last say on decisions about players unless ''one might have a negative impact on the rest of the club and what we're trying to accomplish here.'' Scott had left Montreal with a reputation as a player who was perenially unhappy, and Smith did not think he would fit in. Now it is Williams who is unhappy, and on several occasions since Smith rejected the idea of signing Scott, the manager has been publicly critical of Flannery, who won the job by default.",1982-05-29T05:00:00+0000

Yet, ''even the parasites of the Australian and South American marsupials are the same,'' he wrote.

As there is no verbatim record of the occasion, I have ventured to surmise from what we know of each man what he might have said. For purely dramatic reasons and without a shred of evidence, I've assumed that Pound showed Eliot a clean copy of the revised version. *",1982-05-30T05:00:00+0000
